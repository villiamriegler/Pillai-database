1.  Background information on the renewal 
1.1.  Conditional Marketing Authorisation 
On  21  September  2009,  the  European  Commission  issued  a  conditional  Marketing  Authorisation  (MA) 
for  Cayston  based  on  a  positive  Opinion  adopted  by  the  CHMP  on  25  June  2009.  This  implied  that, 
pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) had to complete 
ongoing  studies,  or  to  conduct  new  studies,  as  listed  in  Annex  II.C  of  the  MA,  the  so-called  Specific 
Obligations (SOs). These data form the basis of the renewal of the conditional MA.  
On 26 August 2010 the European Commission issued a Decision on the first Renewal of the Conditional 
Marketing Authorisation, following a positive CHMP Opinion on 24 June 2010. 
A conditional MA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the MAH. 
Therefore, the Marketing Authorisation Holder Gilead Sciences International Ltd. submitted to the EMA 
on  16  March  2011  an  application  for  the  second  renewal  of  the  conditional  MA  for  Cayston,  which 
expires on 22 September 2011. 
1.2.  Steps taken during the renewal of the conditional MA assessment 
procedure 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted an application for renewal of the Conditional Marketing 
Authorisation on: 16 March 2011 
The procedure started on: 20 March 2011 
The Rapporteur’s assessment report was circulated to all CHMP Members on: 27 April 2011 
The Rapporteur’s updated assessment report was circulated to all CHMP Members on: 17 June 2011 
The  CHMP,  during  its  June  2011  plenary  meeting,  issued  a  positive  Opinion  on  the  switching  of  the 
Conditional Marketing Authorisation to a full one. 
2.  Background information on the medicinal product 
The present submission pertains to the second (annual) renewal application of the conditional 
marketing authorisation for Cayston 75 mg, powder and solvent for nebuliser solution. The CHMP 
issued a final positive Opinion for granting a conditional MA to Cayston on 25 June 2009. The 
conditional marketing authorisation was renewed on 26 August 2010. 
The expiry date of the current authorisation is 22 September 2011. 
The product was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/04/204 on 21 June 2004. 
The product is currently marketed in the following EU countries:  
 
 
 
 
from 1 April 2010 onwards: United Kingdom, Austria and Germany. 
from 10 May 2010: France 
from 20 September 2010: Denmark 
from 1 March 2011: Portugal

 
from 28 March 2011: Greece 
from 1 August 2011: Luxembourg and The Netherlands 
from 1 September 2011: Spain 
Currently approved indication(s): Cayston is indicated for the suppressive therapy of chronic 
pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 
18 years and older. 
The primary support for this indication is based on two single 28-day course placebo-controlled 
studies.  The data to support the sustainability of the observed short term benefit over subsequent 
courses of treatment are limited (see section 5.1).  Consideration should be given to official guidance 
on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
Posology: The currently recommended standard dosage of Cayston is limited to adults. The 
recommended dose is 75 mg three times per 24 hours for 28 days. Doses should be taken at least 
4 hours apart. 
Multiple course, controlled efficacy data are not yet available (see section 5.1). Additional courses, 
beyond the initial 28-day course, should be considered only at the discretion of the physician.  If 
additional courses are prescribed, a minimum of 28 days without Cayston is recommended. 
Inspection 
On 28 September 2010, Gilead informed the European Medicines Agency of receipt of a Warning Letter 
from the FDA subsequent to a GMP inspection conducted at Gilead’s manufacturing facility located at 
650 Cliffside Drive in San Dimas, California from 25 January to 12 February 2010. Gilead stated that 
the room under consideration is not used for the manufacture of Cayston. Gilead also confirms that the 
aseptic processing areas for Cayston met and continue to meet ISO 5 conditions.  
PIP submissions 
EMEA-000827-PIP01-09 (completed) 
On 29 October 2010 the decision of an agreed PIP was issued by the EMA. 
Indications targeted by the PIP: 
1.  Treatment of initial Pseudomonas aeroginosa pulmonary infection/colonisation in patients with 
cystic fybrosis. 
2.  Treatment of chronic Pseudomonas aeroginosa pulmonary infection/colonisation in patients with 
cystic fybrosis. 
Subsets of the paediatric population from 3 months to less than 18 years of age 
EMEA-000827-PIP01-09-MO1 (completed) 
On 20 May 2011 the modification of an agreed PIP was issued by the EMA. The modification pertained 
the amendment of timelines as outlined in the initial PIP. 
Hence the MAH requested a partial compliance check on 24 May 2011 in order to prepare a type II 
variation.

Issue 
C-cell adenoma were observed in the carcinogenicity study. Its relevance needed to be 
discussed. It was shown that no dose-related increase was observed in combined pre-
neoplastic  and  neoplastic  lesions  and  that  the  occurrence  of  C-cell  adenoma  was  still 
within the historical control range.  
Impurities were no qualified regarding genotoxicity. The MAH provided structural alert 
analysis, an Ames test, a chromosome aberration assay and a mouse lymphoma assay 
to qualify the impurities. 
Information  on  safety  pharmacology  was  not  completed  during  the  registration 
procedure.  A  study  on  the  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  systems  needed  to  be 
submitted post-authorisation. A dog study was provided. 
No  information  on  the  genotoxicity  of  aztreonam  was  provided  during  registration. 
Genotoxicity  studies  with  aztreonam  needed  to  be  submitted  post-authorisation.  The 
MAH provided an Ames test, a chromosome aberration assay and a mouse lymphoma 
assay. 
The  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  was  not  completed  during  the  registration 
procedure. The ERA needed to be completed post-authorisation. The MAH provided the 
studies with tests that needed to be performed to complete the ERA.

GS-US-205-0110 
Study GS-US-205-0110 is a Phase 3, open-label, multi-centre, randomized, parallel group study 
comparing the safety and efficacy of Cayston and TNS in adult and paediatric patients with CF aged 6 
years or older with pulmonary PA infection. The study protocol was amended (communicated earlier to 
the European Medicines Agency) to accommodate additional requirements asked by the US FDA as 
outlined below: 
1.  The analysis plan was revised to include co-primary endpoints. The non-inferiority endpoint 
requested by the EMA from the original analysis was maintained. A superiority co-primary endpoint 
was added, as requested by the FDA. 
2.  Secondary endpoints were revised based on an updated analysis plan. 
3.  The sample size was increased to 240 patients in order to adequately power the co-primary and 
secondary analyses. 
Enrolment was closed on 23 October 2009. A total of 273 patients were randomised in the study. 
Therefore, additional time was requested to enable the extra recruited patients to complete the study 
and permit supplementary analysis of the final study data. The final CSR has been submitted to the 
CHMP on 29 September 2010.  
The final study report for Study GS-US-205-0110 was submitted on 29 September 2010 as in the 
context of Specific Obligation 2 (SO 2).  
A total of 91 sites participated in this study, across the European Union (62 sites in the EU) and the 
United States (29 sites in the US). Study ended in May 2010 (last subject visit).  
The study design consisted of two treatment arms of 28-day intermittent, repeating-treatment 
regimens: Aztreonam lysine (AZLI) or Tobi (TNS, Tobramycin Nebuliser Solution) according to the 
following scheme.  
The total study period was to be 26 weeks. 
AZLI 75 mg (1 ml) was administered TID via the PARI Investigational eFlow Nebulizer System. 
TNS 300 mg (5ml) was administered BID via the PARI LC PLUS™ Nebulizer with Compressor in 
accordance with the approved labelling. 
A short acting bronchodilator was administered before every AZLI or TNS dose. The first dose of AZLI 
or TNS was administered at the clinic during Visit 2. After the first dose, patients self-administered 
each AZLI or TNS course of treatment at home for a total of 28 days. 
Randomisation was done via an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/Interactive Web Response 
System (IWRS) with equal allocation to one of two treatment regimens. 
Assessment report 
Page 16/40
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If at any time after randomisation, the physician determined that a subject required anti-PA antibiotics 
in addition to the study-provided AZLI or TNS, the subject was required to come to the clinic for an 
unscheduled visit. In addition to the unscheduled visit procedures, the reason for need of additional 
anti-PA antibiotics was to be documented. Reasons for administering additional antibiotics could 
include one or more of the following clinical symptoms associated with development of an acute 
pulmonary exacerbation: 
  Decreased exercise tolerance 
 
 
Increased cough 
Increased sputum/chest congestion 
  Decreased appetite 
The subject was allowed to continue study participation. 
Patients receiving AZLI were instructed to administer a BD prior to taking each dose of AZLI at home. 
Beginning at Visit 2, all patients administered a short-acting BD in the clinic prior to spirometry. 
Main inclusion criteria were: Male or female CF patients aged ≥ 6 years with CF, FEV1 < 75% 
predicted at screening, and PA present in expectorated sputum or throat swab culture within the 3 
months prior to screening. Patients must have received previous treatment with aerosolized antibiotics 
without demonstration of drug intolerance. Patients must have not initiated or changed azithromycin 
treatment within 28 days of screening. 
Main exclusion criteria were: 
  History of sputum or throat swab culture yielding B. cepacia in the previous 2 years 
  Current use of oral corticosteroids in doses exceeding the equivalent of 10 mg prednisone a day or 
20 mg prednisone every other day 
  Current requirement for daily continuous oxygen supplementation or requirement for more than 2 
l/minute at night 
  Administration of any investigational drug or device within 28 days of Visit 1 or within 6 half-lives 
of the investigational drug (whichever is longer) 
  Known local or systemic hypersensitivity to monobactam antibiotics 
  Changes in or initiation of chronic azithromycin treatment within 28 days prior to Visit 1 
  Administration of anti-PA antibiotics by inhalation, intravenous or oral routes within the 14 days 
prior to Randomization/Visit 2 
  Changes in antimicrobial, bronchodilator (BD), dornase alfa, or corticosteroid medications within 7 
days prior to Visit 1 
  Changes in physiotherapy technique or schedule within 7 days prior to Visit 1 
  History of lung transplantation 
  Abnormal renal or hepatic function or serum chemistry at Visit 1 
At Visit 1, concurrent medications and therapies including airway clearance techniques were recorded. 
All medications and treatments, including any changes during the course of the study, were recorded 
on the Concomitant Medications and Therapies electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).

Patients were to be assessed at Days 14 and 28 during the first course of treatment, then every 28 
days for the remainder of the study. 
Eligible patients were stratified by disease severity (FEV1 ≤ 50% or > 50% predicted at Visit 1) and 
inhaled tobramycin use in the previous 12 months (≥ 84 days or < 84 days) and randomized with 
equal allocation to AZLI or TNS. Patients must have received ≥ 84 days (3 courses) of inhaled 
tobramycin in the previous 12 months. The criterion < 84 days (3 courses) of inhaled tobramycin 
stratum was closed by the time US sites were open. The target for randomized patients was 
approximately 240 with no more than 40 patients having < 84 days use of inhaled tobramycin in the 
previous 12 months. 
A total of 268 patients were randomized and treated (136 AZLI, 132 TNS) in the study. 
The following Co-primary efficacy endpoints were used: 
  Relative change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted at Day 28 among all patients (non-
inferiority analysis) 
  Actual change from baseline in FEV1 percent of predicted across 3 treatment courses among all 
patients (superiority analysis). 
The following Secondary efficacy endpoints were used: 
  Relative change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted at Day 28 in patients who received 
inhaled tobramycin for ≥ 84 days in the 12 months prior to randomization (non-inferiority analysis) 
  Actual change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted across 3 treatment courses in patients who 
received inhaled tobramycin for ≥ 84 days in the 12 months prior to randomization (superiority 
analysis) 
 
Time to need for IV anti-PA antibiotic for respiratory events among all patients (superiority 
analysis) 
 
Time to first respiratory hospitalization among all patients (superiority analysis) Tertiary endpoints: 
  Change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted at each study visit (exclusive of Day 28) 
  Change from baseline in FEV1, FVC, and FEF25-75 at each study visit 
  Change from baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Quality of Life – Revised (CFQR) Respiratory 
Symptoms Scale (RSS) score at each study visit 
  Change from baseline in other domains as assessed by the CFQ-R at each study visit 
  Hospitalizations, Days 0 to 168 
  Use of additional anti-PA antibiotics (other than randomized treatment), Days 0 to 168 
  Change in weight/body mass index (BMI) at Week 20 
  Missed school/work days, Days 0 to 168 
 
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) at Day 28 and either Day 140 or Early 
Termination (ET) 
  Change in PA CFUs in sputum at the end of each on-drug cycle 
Additional microbiology assessments included (1) change in PA CFUs in sputum over 3 courses of study 
drug treatment; (2) disappearance or appearance of other respiratory pathogens (S. aureus, B. 
Assessment report 
Page 18/40
 
 
 
 
cepacia, S. maltophilia, A. xylosoxidans, Aspergillus spp.) at each study visit; and (3) change in MIC of 
aztreonam, tobramycin, and other antibiotics for PA at each study visit. 
Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines at each visit and 
FEV1, FVC, and FEF25-75 were recorded. Participants performed at least 3 spirometry manoeuvres 
that achieved ATS standards. The best FEV1 and FVC were recorded, even if from different efforts. The 
value recorded for FEF25-75 was taken from the effort that produced the highest sum of FVC plus 
FEV1 values. 
At Visit 2, spirometry was repeated at 30 minutes post-AZLI or TNS treatment. If a subject 
experienced a decrease in FEV1 (L) of 15 % or more from the pre-treatment value, spirometry was 
repeated at 60 minutes post-treatment, and every 30 minutes thereafter until the investigator felt it 
was safe to discharge the subject. 
CFQ-R: All patients, and parents of children 6 to 13 years of age, were asked to complete the CFQ-R at 
Visits 2 through 9 and ET. The same parent completed the CFQ-R at every visit. The CFQ-R is a CF-
specific quality of life measure encompassing both generic and CF-specific domains. The translations of 
the questionnaire into the languages of all participating countries were validated prior to the study. The 
questionnaire domains include physical functioning, role limitations/school performance, vitality, 
emotional functioning, social functioning, body image, eating disturbances, treatment burden, health 
perceptions, weight, respiratory symptoms, and digestive symptoms. The number of domains varies 
depending on the CFQ-R version being used. The four versions include: 
The safety evaluation included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), airway reactivity (pre- and post 
study drug spirometry), vital signs, serum chemistry, and haematology were evaluated. 
The Per Protocol (PP) analysis set included patients who: 
1.  Were randomized into the study, and 
2.  Received at least one dose of study medication, and 
3.  Did not violate any major entry criteria (inclusion criteria 1-6 and exclusion criteria 8-9), and 
4.  Did not take any other investigational drug or device and with a relative treatment compliance 
of at least 50% between Day 0 and Day 28. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoints were performed on the per-protocol analysis set. 
The protocol-specified co-primary ANCOVA analysis of arithmetic average across 3 treatment periods 
based on predicted values was performed as a sensitivity analysis for the ITT population. This analysis 
used an ANCOVA model including terms for treatment, FEV1 percent predicted at Visit 2 (as a 
continuous variable), and inhaled tobramycin use in the previous 12 months (≥ 84 days or < 84 days) 
to test for treatment differences in the average actual change in FEV1 percent predicted across 3 
treatment courses. The arithmetic average was calculated based on predicted values of actual change 
inFEV1 percent predicted at Visits 4, 6, and 8. 
The actual change values at each post-baseline visit (Visit 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) from baseline were 
fitted into this model to obtain predicted values. 
As additional sensitivity analyses, in order to evaluate the long-term overall performance of AZLI 
against TNS for the primary superiority endpoint on the ITT population, statistical comparisons based 
on LS means at each of the post baseline visits (Visit 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) from the primary MMRM 
model were performed. For these analyses, it was expected that AZLI should be at least numerically 
superior to TNS at the end of each treatment course (Visits 4, 6, and 8 respectively).

The last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was used to impute missing post-baseline data 
values for spirometry and CFQ-R data. As an example of the LOCF method, if a subject had a missing 
value at Day 28, then the latest available value among Day 0, Day 14 and ET was used; if a subject 
had a missing value at Week 20, then the latest available value including ET from Day 0 up to Week 16 
was used; if a subject had a missing value at Week 24, then the latest available value including ET 
from Day 0 up to Week 20 was used. The LOCF method was also used for weight and body mass index 
(BMI) data; however, only missing values at Week 24 were imputed. 
As a supportive analysis of the change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted, the less favourable of 
two group means method (LF) was used to impute missing post-baseline data for the visit at which the 
data was missing. For example, if a subject had a missing value at Day 8, then the smaller value of the 
two group means was assigned to this subject regardless of the treatment. 
As an exploratory analysis, the potential for interaction between treatment group and previous inhaled 
tobramycin use was examined for spirometry, CFQ-R, and CFU data. The descriptive statistics for AZLI 
and TNS treatment groups under previous inhaled tobramycin use was visually evaluated. 
For the time to need for IV anti-PA antibiotics for respiratory events a sponsor-independent, blinded 
review committee reviewed the IV anti-PA antibiotics and identified the subset used for respiratory 
events. The committee adjudicated events based on AE/SAE reports, concomitant medications, 
baseline characteristics and demographics, and other relevant data as determined necessary by the 
committee. This independent committee approach was performed also for the evaluation of time to 
first respiratory hospitalization 
There were 22 amendments to the original EU protocol (Version 1.0, dated 07 September 2007), and 3 
amendments to the original US protocol (Version 4.4, dated 07 April 2009). 
The majority of these amendments/versions were country-specific variations of amendments to the 
initial protocol. 
GCP: The study report mentions that the trial was conducted in accordance with the GCP guideline. 
CRO was Chiltern International Ltd (UK).  
Compliance: Patients were required to use at least 50% of each of the allocated treatments. Patients 
who used less than 50% of any one course were discontinued from the study.  
RESULTS 
Disposition of patients 
Twenty-five TNS-treated patients discontinued the study (12 withdrew consent), and 25 discontinued 
study drug (12 withdrew consent). Three patients in the AZLI group and 5 patients in the TNS group 
discontinued the study drug for safety or tolerability reasons.  
A total of 62 important protocol deviations involving 55 patients occurred during the study. 
Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Patients ranged in age from 6 to 69 years, with a mean (SD) age of 25.5 (9.0) years. One hundred 
thirty-four (50.0%) patients were female. Two hundred sixty-one (97.4%) patients were white. Ninety-
four patients (35.1%) were enrolled at US sites. One hundred seventeen patients (43.7%) had a 
baseline disease severity of FEV1 ≤ 50% predicted. Overall mean (SD) baseline FEV1 % predicted, 
CFQ-R RSS score, and log10 PA CFUs were 52.27 (15.06), 60.44 (20.69), and 6.16 (2.41), 
respectively. See further the following table.  
Assessment report 
Page 20/40
 
 
 
 
 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally balanced between treatment groups. 
CFQ-R RSS score and log10 CFUs: The mean (SD) CFQ-R RSS score for patients treated with AZLI was 
62.87 (20.42) compared to 58.02 (20.76) for those treated with TNS which approached statistical 
significance (p = 0.057). The mean (SD) log10 CFUs for patients treated with AZLI was 6.39 (2.07) 
compared to 5.93 (2.70) for those treated with TNS (p = 0.175). 
Demographic and baseline characteristics for patients by previous inhaled tobramycin use were similar 
to the overall population. 
Compliance results 
The overall mean percent of vials used greater than 90% for both treatment groups for all courses No 
differences were noted across treatment courses with the. 
Efficacy results 
The results for the (co-)primary endpoints i.e. the adjusted mean relative change from baseline in 
FEV1 % predicted at Day 28 show that AZLI was at least as efficacious as TNS after 1 or 3 cycles:  
 
relative change FEV1 after 28 days (non inferiority): 8.35 vs 0.55 (-7.8 difference therefore AZLI 
non-inferior using a 4% non-inferiority margin) 
  Actual change from baseline in FEV1 percent of predicted across 3 treatment courses: 2.05 vs -
0.66.

Figure 2: Percent Change in FEV1 % Predicted from Baseline on Observed Case Data (ITT 
Population) 
Similar patterns have also been observed for LOCF analysis (percent change, actual change), and LF 
analysis as documented in the study report. 
This attenuation is considered by the MAH to be unlikely due to the development of resistance, as no 
concerning changes in PA susceptibility to aztreonam or tobramycin were observed among patients in 
either treatment group in this study (see section on Additional microbiological results). Rather, 
seasonality provides a possible explanation, as the majority of the patients in both treatment groups 
enrolled during the summer months and received their second and third treatment courses during the 
fall and winter months. The diminished improvements in lung function among patients receiving 
treatment during the fall and winter months might be attributed to concomitant viral infections. Similar 
seasonality effects have been observed in the AZLI Study CP-AI-007 provided in the original MAA, as 
well as in studies of other inhaled antibiotics. 
Secondary and tertiary endpoints 
Significant improvement in CFQ-R RSS (Quality of life score), fewer hospitalizations (40 vs 58, 
p=0.04), fewer requirements for anti-pseudomonas inhalation or intravenous antibiotic therapy (84 vs 
121, p=0.004) and longer time to need for these antibiotics. 
Change in CFU was non-significant (-0.55log vs -0.32log, p=0.3). No significant differences in adverse 
events in this open label study were observed. 
This study demonstrated an improvement of FEV1 predicted at the end of each AZLI treatment course 
with less hospitalizations and requirements for additional anti-pseudomonal treatment in cystic fibrosis 
patients, but also that: 
 
In Tobramycin-naïve patients (less than 84 days of Tobramycin inhalation in the previous 12 
months) better lung function as measured by FEV1 was achieved with Tobramycin than with AZLI:  
  primary endpoint at day 28: 2.45 vs. 4.65 relative change in FEV1 
  primary endpoint as average of actual change across 3 courses: -1.33 vs. 0.51 
  Also in this group of Tobramycin-naïve patients numerically less hospitalizations and requirements 
for IV or inhaled anti-pseudomonal antibiotics for respiratory events were recorded in the AZLI 
treated patients. 
Assessment report 
Page 23/40
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In strains exposed to Aztreonam MIC to Aztreonam increased > 4-fold whereas Tobramycin MIC90 
did not increase and in more AZLI-treated subjects strains were isolated with MIC for the study 
drug that increased 4 fold during the study time and did not reverse in off-treatment periods in the 
AZLI treated subjects than in TNS-treated patients. 
 
In the AZLI-treated patients more frequent occurrence of decreased susceptibility to beta-lactam 
antibiotics was demonstrated with increases in MIC90 of cefepime and piperacillin. Also 
demonstrated was an increase of resistance to all 6 beta-lactam antibiotics (cefepime, ceftazidime, 
piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, and meropenem ) in at least one 
isolate of Pseudomonas from baseline to week 24 from 13.0 to 18.4%, while this proportion in 
Tobramycin treated patients remained stable (17.3-18.8%).  
 
increase in occurrence of Pseudomonas strains with Aztreonam MIC>8 mg/L from 0 to 24 weeks 
during treatment: 34% to 49% in AZLI treated patients (again no reversal of MIC  during off-
treatment periods), whereas the proportion of 35% in Tobramycin-treated patients at week 0 
remained always below baseline (max. 32% at end of treatment).  
  Resistance to aminoglycosides of Pseudomonas isolates in Tobramycin treated patients increased 
over 24 weeks: 29.1 to 33.3% 
Increase in treatment-emergent isolation of intermittent and persistent MRSA and MSSA : treatment-
emergent isolation of MSSA occurred in more AZLI-treated subjects (17% [n=22]) compared to TNS-
treated subjects (12% [n=15]). Treatment-emergent isolation of MRSA occurred in more AZLI-treated 
subjects (10% [n=13]) compared to TNS-treated subjects (1% [n=1]). 
Conclusion on study 0110 
 
In tobramycin experienced patients AZLI improves FEV1 during treatment periods compared to 
TNS 
  No sustained effect is achieved in lung function improvement because at week 24 patients return 
to baseline FEV1 values comparable to TNS, but non-inferiority at the 6 months evaluation point 
was demonstrated. 
 
In tobramycin experienced patients, AZLI reduces significantly the need for additional antibiotic 
treatment and hospitalization during on-treatment and off-treatment periods 
 
In tobramycin experienced patients, AZLI achieves improvement in lung function also in case of 
increased Aztreonam MICs or beta-lactam resistance and preserves lung function in case of MDR 
PA during treatment, but data is not provided whether this improvement or preservation also 
required additional antibiotics in the AZLI group. 
 
In the tobramycin naïve patients, AZLI does not significantly improve lung function compared to 
TNS and data on the reduction of the need for additional antibiotic treatment are not provided, but 
considering the small sample size of this subgroup in this study the identification of significant 
findings that can be extrapolated to all tobramycin naïve patients is unlikely.

3.3.4.  Clinical Safety 
The safety of Cayston was described in the original Assessment Reports and supports the conditionally 
approved dose of 75 mg Cayston TID. Nine adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were considered to be 
reasonably associated with the use of Cayston: cough, nasal congestion, wheezing, pharyngolaryngeal 
pain, pyrexia, chest discomfort, rhinorrhea, non-allergic bronchospasm, and rash. All of the ADRs were 
typical for patients with CF lung disease.  
Subsequent to submitting the Cayston Marketing Authorisation Application, 3 studies that evaluated 
the safety of Cayston have been completed (CP-AI-006, GS-US-205-0117 and GS-US-205-0110) 
and 2 studies are currently on-going (EA-US-205-0111 and EA-US-205-0122). 
GS-US-205-0110 (completed) 
In the aztreonam lysine (AZLI) group, 130 subjects (95.6%) experienced a total of 1360 Adverse 
Events (AEs). In the Tobi (TNS) group, 128 subjects (97%) reported a total of 1341 AEs. Respiratory 
AEs were the most frequently reported AEs. Most commonly cough was reported (AZLI 96 subjects, 
TNS 104 subjects), followed by productive cough (AZLI 70 subjects, TNS 104 subjects), oropharyngeal 
pain (AZLI 36 subjects, TNS 37 subjects) and dyspnoea (AZLI 32 subjects, TNS 36 subjects). 
Hemoptysis occurred more frequently among AZLI-treated subjects (31) as compared to TNS-treated 
subjects (21). 
Thirty-one (31) subjects in the AZLI group and 17 subjects in the TNS group experienced AEs that 
were assessed as related to study drug, with the majority of these subjects experiencing respiratory 
AEs. 
Three subjects in the AZLI group experienced drug-related serious adverse events (compared to none 
in the TNS group). All 3 cases reported respiratory events. Two subjects experienced wheezing and 1 
subject experienced productive cough, dyspnoea, hemoptysis and discoloured sputum.  
Nine subjects treated with AZLI discontinued due to an AE. 6 subjects treated with AZLI and 1 subject 
treated with TNS discontinued due to respiratory AEs. The most frequent AEs leading to discontinuation 
were cough and hemoptysis (each 3 subjects). 
The MAH concludes that in study GS-US-205-0110 AZLI was well tolerated over 3 treatment courses 
with an AE profile consistent with the previously established experience for AZLI. 
Ongoing Safety Studies (EA-US-205-0111; EA-US-205-0122) 
In addition to the completed studies, the safety of AZLI is being evaluated in 2 expanded access 
programmes, EA-US-205-0111 and EA-US-205-0122.  
The combined safety results as of the last data analysis cut-off of 03 May 2010 are presented here. In 
study EA-US-205-0111 a total of 570 subjects had enrolled and 544 subjects had received at least 1 
dose of AZLI. Study EA-US-205-0122 is currently enrolling with 34 subjects enrolled as of 31 January 
2011. 
A total of 44 subjects have discontinued due to SAE (35 with a pulmonary exacerbation or end-stage 
CF lung disease, 5 with pneumothorax, and 4 with hemoptysis). Additionally there have been 24 
deaths. Reported causes of death included respiratory failure, lung disorder, cystic fibrosis, cardio-
Assessment report

respiratory arrest, pneumonia, pneumothorax, cystic fibrosis lung, acute respiratory failure, 
hemoptysis, arterial hemrorrhage, pneumonia necrotising, sepsis, multi-organ failure, shock and 
cardiac arrest. None of the deaths were judged to be related to treatment by the investigators.  
307 subjects experienced a total of 793 severe adverse events (SAEs). Three were considered drug 
related by the investigator (pulmonary exacerbation, hemoptysis, and spontaneous abortion). The 
most commonly reported SAEs (> 1% of the subjects) were consistent with the underlying disease and 
consisted of the following: Lung disorder (264 subjects), hemoptysis (22 subjects), cystic fibrosis lung 
(12 subjects), pneumonia (9 subjects), pneumothorax (9 subjects) and small intestinal obstruction (6 
subjects).  
3.3.5.  Post-Marketing Experience 
Postmarketing safety data are available from the second PSUR (reporting period from 12 Mar 2010- 11 
Sep 2010). 
Summary of PSUR 2 
Marketing exposure 
Since first approval, cumulative post-marketing exposure in US, Canada and EU is estimated to be 
6,048 patient-months of treatment and exposure to AZLI was estimated as 5,701 patient-months 
during the period of the PSUR. The exposure in the EU is 585 patient-months. 
Indication 
Differences exist in indications between different countries world-wide: 
 
In the EU, Cayston is indicated for the suppressive therapy of chronic pulmonary infections due to 
PA in patients with CF aged 18 years and older. 
 
In Australia, Cayston is indicated for control of gram-negative bacteria, particularly PA, in the 
respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) 6 years and older. 
 
In Canada, Cayston is indicated for the management of CF patients with chronic pulmonary PA 
infections in patients aged 6 years and older. 
 
In the US, Cayston is indicated to improve respiratory symptoms in CF patients with PA aged 7 
years and older. 
AZLI is also currently in a clinical development program investigating the following: 
 
Improvement in respiratory symptoms in patients with bronchiectasis and pulmonary gram 
negative bacteria in patients aged 18 years and older. 
  Safety and efficacy of AZLI for suppressive therapy of chronic pulmonary infections due to PA in 
patients with CF aged 6 years and older. 
  Safety and efficacy of continuous AZLI therapy in CF subjects with Burkholderia species infection in 
the airways. 
Adverse events 
Twenty-one medically confirmed case reports (20 spontaneous, 1 from clinical trial) were received

During the period covered by this PSUR the following topics of special interest for AZLI were assessed: 
  Hemoptysis: During the period under review by the PSUR, four medically confirmed cases of 
hemoptysis were received. Three of the cases were spontaneous cases (2 serious, 1 non-serious), 
and the remaining case was a serious adverse event from a clinical trial that was considered 
related to AZLI by the investigator. All four cases were confounded by progression of the 
underlying lung disease and in two of the four cases there was a history of hemoptysis prior to 
AZLI therapy. Also, two of the cases reported a negative rechallenge, which suggests an 
alternative aetiology. 
  Bronchospasm in Patients with Severe Lung Disease: During the PSUR period, 2 cases were 
reported (1 serious, 1 non-serious). Bronchospasm in patients with severe lung disease is an 
identified risk in the RMP for AZLI. Bronchospasm is a labelled event in the SmPC. 
  Hypersensitivity: During the period under review by the PSUR two cases were received describing 
allergic type reactions (tongue swelling and generalised rash in one case and hives and joint pain 
Assessment report 
Page 27/40
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the other case). Both cases were considered unrelated to AZLI due to lack of information or due 
to the reporting physician’s causality assessment (not related). 
 
Pregnancy  and  Lactation:  A  total  of  five  pregnancy  cases  involving  AZLI  exposure  have  been 
reported  up  to  11  September  2010.  During  the  period  under  review  by  the  second  PSUR  one 
pregnancy  outcome  for  a  previously  reported  case  was  received.  The  patient  gave  birth  to  a 
premature  female  neonate  at  34  weeks  of  gestation.  The  neonate  was  noted  to  have 
hyperbilirubinemia secondary to premature birth and was admitted to rule out sepsis. The neonate 
was  noted  to  have  congenital  abnormalities  including  mild  congenital  hypothyroidism  and 
congenital  adrenal  hyperplasia.  The  neonate  was  discharged  11  days  later.  The  investigator 
assessed  the  pregnancy  outcome  as  unrelated  to  the  study  drug  as  well  as  unrelated  to  the 
concomitant  medications  and  stated  that  the  patient’s  medical  condition  of  pre-eclampsia  had 
contributed to this outcome. 
  Special patient groups – Children (aged less than 18 years): During the period under review by the 
PSUR there were two spontaneous reports involving the use of AZLI in patients less than 18 years 
of age. Both cases originated form the US where AZLi is indicated for use in patients aged 7 years 
and older. No new safety issue was identified. 
Other conclusions 
No  new  safety  data  was  identified  regarding:  Drug  Interactions;  Overdose;  Drug  Abuse  or  Misuse; 
Prescription  or  Medication  Errors;  Partner  Pregnancies;  Lactation;  Elderly  patients;  Off-Label  Use; 
Effects of Long-Term treatment Patient/consumer and other non-healthcare professional reports. 
  CHMP comments: 
PSUR2  did  not  reveal  major  new  safety  issues  for  AZLI  at  the  recommended  dosage.  The  following 
issues should be continued to be closely monitored: Bonchospasm in patients with severe lung disease; 
hypersensitivity;  severe  allergic  reactions;  reports  of  the  use  of  AZLI  during  pregnancy/lactation.  
Haemoptysis remains a point of concern. 
PSUR 3 was submitted by MAH during April 2011.  Assessment of RMP 3 is ongoing.

Bronchospasm 
Bronchospasm is a complication 
associated with nebulised therapies.  
Patients were pre-treated with a 
bronchodilator before dosing with study 
therapy.  An acute reduction of ≥ 15% 
in forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV 1) following administration of study 
therapy was observed in 3% of patients 
treated with Cayston and 4% of patients 
receiving placebo despite pre-treatment 
with a bronchodilator before dosing with 
study therapy.  Patients should use a 
bronchodilator before each dose of 
Cayston.  If a case of bronchospasm is 
suspected to be part of an allergic 
reaction appropriate measures should 
be taken (see “allergic reactions” 
paragraph above).

Allergic Reactions 
If an allergic reaction to Cayston does 
occur, stop administration of the 
medicinal product and initiate 
treatment as appropriate. The 
occurrence of rash may be indicative 
of an allergic reaction to Cayston. 
Cross-reactivity may occur in patients 
with a history of allergy to beta 
lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins, 
cephalosporins, and/or carbapenems. 
Animal and human data demonstrate 
low risk of cross-reactivity between 
aztreonam and beta-lactam 
antibiotics. Aztreonam, a 
monobactam, is only weakly 
immunogenic.  Caution is advised 
when administering Cayston to 
patients if they have a history of 
beta-lactam allergy. 
The following rare and severe adverse 
reactions, although these have not 
been observed to date with Cayston, 
have been reported after parenteral 
use of other aztreonam containing 
products: toxic epidermal necrolysis,

The development of antibiotic-resistant 
P. aeruginosa and superinfection with 
other pathogens represent potential 
risks associated with antibiotic 
therapy.  Development of resistance 
during inhaled aztreonam therapy 
could limit treatment options during 
acute exacerbations.  In clinical 
studies of Cayston, no increases of 
clinical significance were observed in 
the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant 
P. aeruginosa or other bacterial 
respiratory pathogens among 
patients treated three times daily 
with Cayston. Among patients with 
multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, 
improvements in respiratory 
symptoms and pulmonary function 
were observed following treatment 
with Cayston.  An increased 
prevalence of Aspergillus and 
Candida species were observed over 
time in patients treated with several 
Cayston treatment courses.  The 
clinical significance of this finding is 
unknown.

Section 5.1 
Mechanisms of resistance 
Loss of susceptibility to aztreonam in CF 
patients with P. aeruginosa occurs 
either through selection of strains 
with mutations located on the 
chromosome or rarely through 
acquisition of plasmid/integrin 
mediated genes. 
Known mechanisms of resistance to 
aztreonam mediated by mutation of 
chromosomal genes include: 
hyperexpression of the Class C beta-
lactamase AmpC and up-regulation of 
the efflux pump MexAB OprM.  The 
known mechanism of resistance to 
aztreonam mediated by acquisition of 
genes involves acquisition of 
extended spectrum beta-lactam 
enzymes (ESBLs) that hydrolyse the 
four-member, nitrogen-containing 
ring of aztreonam. 
ESBLs from Class A, B and D beta-
lactamases generally have little or no 
activity against aztreonam. Class A 
beta-lactamases reported to 
hydrolyse aztreonam include the VEB 
type (primarily Southeast Asia), PER 
type (Turkey), and GES and IBC 
types (France, Greece, and S. 
Africa).  There are rare reports of 
organisms with metallo-beta-
lactamases (MBLs), Class B, that are 
resistant to aztreonam, VIM 5 (K. 
pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa - 
Turkey), VIM 6 (P. putida - 
Singapore) and VIM 7 (P. aeruginosa 
- United States), however, it is 
possible that these organisms were 
expressing multiple resistance 
mechanisms and thus a MBL was not 
responsible for the observed 
resistance to aztreonam. There are 
rare reports of Class D beta-
lactamases from clinical isolates of  
P. aeruginosa, OXA 11 (Turkey) and 
OXA 45 (United States) that 
hydrolyse aztreonam. 
Microbiology 
A single sputum sample from a CF 
patient may contain multiple isolates 
of P. aeruginosa and each isolate 
may have a different level of in vitro 
susceptibility to aztreonam. The in 
vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test

aztreonam therapy can be used to 
monitor the susceptibility of P. 
aeruginosa isolated from CF patients. 
In the Phase 3 placebo-controlled 
studies of Cayston, local aztreonam 
concentrations generally exceeded 
aztreonam MIC values for P. 
aeruginosa, regardless of the level of 
P. aeruginosa susceptibility. 
Treatment with a 28-day course of 75 
mg 3 times a day Cayston therapy 
resulted in clinically important 
improvements in respiratory 
symptoms, pulmonary function, and 
sputum P. aeruginosa CFU density, 
regardless of whether the highest 
aztreonam MIC for P. aeruginosa was 
above or below the established 
susceptibility breakpoint for 
intravenous aztreonam 
administration (8 µg/ml).  Based on 
categorical analyses of the 
relationship between MIC and 
treatment response, a susceptibility 
breakpoint for Cayston cannot be 
established. Over 6 courses of 
Cayston therapy, P. aeruginosa 
MIC 50 and MIC90 did not change

theoretical risk that patients treated 
with Cayston may develop P.

A review of all pediatric data 
from controlled clinical 
studies  
The RMP Version 2 (April 2010) was updated to Version 3 (submission: April 2011). 
The most relevant change noted in the update was as follows: 
 
The AZLI EU-RMP was updated with new safety data from the randomised phase of Study GS-US-
205-0110 where the safety and efficacy of 3 repeated 28-day cycles of AZLI therapy compared to 
tobramycin nebuliser solution (TNS) were evaluated. A total of 136 patients received AZLI in the 
study including 28 children aged 6 to 17 years. No new safety concerns for AZLI in adult and 
pediatric subjects were identified and there were no reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions, 
anaphylaxis or toxic epidermal necrolysis. There was also no evidence of superinfection or the 
development of resistance, with clinical sequelae, to aztreonam or other antibiotics. One patient 
developed an acute decrease of > 15% in FEV1 30 minutes following dosing with AZLI; however, 
no symptoms or adverse events associated with this episode of airway reactivity were reported and 
the patient was not withdrawn from the study. 
Other significant changes to the Cayston-RMP include the following: 
 
Paediatric summary: In Phase 2 and Phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical studies of AZLI, pyrexia 
was observed at a higher incidence rate in paediatric subjects aged 6 to 17 years (18%) compared 
to adults (8%). The EU-RMP was updated to include a review of all paediatric data from controlled 
Assessment report 
Page 34/40
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical studies including the randomised phase of the active controlled study GS-US-205-0110. In 
this study, the incidence of pyrexia was higher in paediatric subjects than adults and similar in 
paediatric subjects who received AZLI and those who received TNS. No new safety concerns for 
AZLI in pediatric subjects aged 6 to 17 years were identified. 
  AZLI Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP): The Cayston EU-RMP was updated in line with the AZLI 
PIP that was approved by the Agency on 29 October 2010. The approved Cayston PIP includes an 
exploratory Phase 2 study (GS-US-205-XXX1 [GS-US-205-0162]) and a deferral to conduct a 
subsequent Phase 3 study (GS-US-205-XXX2) to evaluate initial PA infection in pediatric subjects 
(aged 3 months to 17 years), and a Phase 3 study (GS-US-205-XXX3 [GS-US-205-0160]) to 
evaluate long-term safety in paediatric subjects (aged less than 13 years) with chronic PA 
infection/colonization, and study GS-US-205-0110, which included children with CF 6 years or 
older. These studies will provide additional safety data in children. 
The assessment report on RMP 3 will be adopted by CHMP during its July 2011 meeting.

“Non-clinical data for aztreonam for injection about fertility do not indicate any adverse effects.” 
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
The MAH proposes the following changes to update section 4.8: 
a. Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of Cayston was evaluated in three Phase 3 studies in 344 predominantly adult 
patients (77%) with chronic P. aeruginosa. In two Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies 
patients received Cayston 75 mg 2 times (69 patients) or 3 times a day (146 patients) for 28 
days. In one Phase 3 open-label follow-on study 274 CF patients received up to nine 28-day 
treatment courses of Cayston 75 mg 2 times or 3 times a day. 
In the two Phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials, the most frequently occurring adverse 
reactions to Cayston were cough (58%), nasal congestion (18%), wheezing (15%), 
pharyngolaryngeal pain (13.0%), and pyrexia (12%). 
An acute reduction of ≥ 15% in FEV1 is a complication associated with nebulised therapies, 
including Cayston (see section 4.4).

c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
Bronchospasm: 
Nebulised therapies, including Cayston, may be associated with bronchospasm (an acute 
reduction of ≥ 15% in FEV1). In placebo-controlled studies, bronchospasm was observed in 
3% of patients treated with Cayston versus 4% of patients treated with placebo, despite pre-
treatment with a bronchodilator before dosing with study treatment (see section 4.4). 
Allergic reactions: 
Rash has been reported with the use of Cayston and may be indicative of an allergic reaction 
to Cayston (see section 4.4). 
The following rare and severe adverse reactions, although these have not been observed to date with 
Cayston, have been reported after parenteral use of other aztreonam containing products: toxic 
epidermal necrolysis, anaphylaxis, purpura, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, urticaria, 
petechiae, pruritus, diaphoresis. 
CHMP’s comment: The proposed changes are accepted. 
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
The MAH includes a reference to paediatric studies and deleted the text regarding the “conditional 
approval”. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Cayston in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis patients with 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infection/colonisation (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called “conditional approval” scheme. 
This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. 
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on the product every year and this SmPC 
will be updated as necessary. 
CHMP’s comment:  
The  PDCO  provided  an  opinion,  including  a  deferral  and  a  waiver  for  Cayston,  (EMEA-
000827-PIP01-09 on 29 October 2010). Inclusion of the proposed text is agreed. 
As  the  MAH  has  fulfilled  all  specific  obligations,  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  the 
conditional  marketing  authorisation  can  be  converted  in  a  marketing  authorisation  not 
subject to specific obligation. The proposed deletion in section 5.1 of SmPC is agreed.

4.  Overall conclusion and benefit/risk assessment 
Benefit 
For a more definitive conclusion of the benefit of Cayston in comparison with a standard comparator in 
the same target group (including paediatric patients) the assessment of the responses for study GS-
US-205-0110 recently became available (study GS-US-205-0110 assessment reports adopted by 
CHMP, Annexes 4-6). 
Study GS-US-205-0110 has shown that based on the submitted efficacy (and safety data) in 
tobramycin experienced CF patients with chronic PA infection, aztreonam lysine provides significant 
lung function improvement during treatment compared to continuation of Tobi (TNS- Tobramycin 
nebuliser solution) with additional significant effects of decreased need of additional antibiotic 
treatment and hospitalization and non-inferiority during off-treatment periods including at the 6 
months evaluation point. 
Risk 
The overall adverse events profile for Cayston in CF patients with the approved indication at the 
recommended dose in the present overall analysis was not different from that reported in the original 
Marketing Authorisation Application. Study GS-US-205-0110 AZLI did not reveal new or unexpected 
safety issues.  However, in study GS-US-205-0110, an emerging trend was noted of increased 
resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates to aztreonam and to other beta lactams. 
Regarding hemoptysis, the MAH’s conclusion and proposal of a targeted questionnaire are agreed. 
Although hemoptysis itself may not be drug related, there is the potential for exacerbation of 
hemoptysis due to the cough or bronchospasm associated with inhaled therapies like AZLI. This is 
recognised in the AZLI EU Risk Management Plan (RMP): bronchospasm in patients with severe lung 
disease is cited as an important identified risk. The MAH’s commitment to continue closely monitor 
cases of hemoptysis is noted. 
No SmPC safety amendments are warranted at this moment provided the MAH will continue monitoring 
(in PSUR): 
  Hemoptysis 
  Bronchospasm in Patients with Severe Lung Disease 
 
Immune System disorders – Hypersensitivity. 
  Severe allergic reactions. 
  Reports of the use of AZLI during pregnancy/lactation

Benefit/ Risk Conclusion 
Discussion on B/R 
Study GS-US-205-0110 presents a significant contribution in confirming the positive benefit risk ratio 
of Cayston (AZLI) within the context of the conditionally approved indication in adult cystic fibrosis 
patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection of the lungs.  In this open-label non-
inferiority study of AZLI versus TNS, Cayston demonstrated favourable efficacy as judged by the 
improvement of the lung function parameter FEV1% predicted across 3 treatment courses of 28 days 
in adult tobramycin-experienced patients during treatment periods. Also for the required six months 
evaluation period in CF, Cayston showed non-inferiority in the primary endpoint. In addition, Cayston 
showed a favourable effect in prolonging time to need for IV anti-PA antibiotics for a respiratory event, 
total number of respiratory hospitalizations and total number of respiratory events requiring the use of 
IV or inhaled anti-PA antibiotics during the 6-month study period. In the small subgroup of CF patients 
who were tobramycin-naïve, lung function at day 28 and week 20 was better with TNS compared to 
AZLI although not significantly due to the small sample size, but also these patients required more 
additional anti-pseudomonal antibiotic treatment and admissions than AZLI-treated patients. An 
increase in PA isolates with decreased susceptibility and resistance to aztreonam, more frequent 
isolation of S.aureus in AZLI-treated subjects and appearance of cross-resistance to beta-lactam 
antibiotics is noted.  This has the potential to impact on future treatment strategies in these patients. 
However, the increase in aztreonam MIC and appearance of cross-resistance in AZLI-treated patients 
did not result in a decrease of the favourable efficacy of AZLI in improvement of lung function in those 
patients during the 6 month study period. 
Good monitoring of the emergence of PA resistance to aztreonam after AZLI treatment and the 
anticipation of the consequences for the treatment of systemic infections warrants future inclusion of 
appropriate information in section 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC, because: 
 
the initiation of AZLI in chronic PA infection will increase the number of PA strains with increased 
Aztreonam MIC > 8 and resistance to beta lactam antibiotics. 
 
an increase in isolation rates of other bacterial microorganisms, especially S.aureus, could be 
associated with AZLI. 
Conclusion 
The presently expanded efficacy and safety database does not change the favourable benefit/risk ratio 
for Cayston at the recommended dose in the approved indication for the suppressive therapy of chronic 
pulmonary infections due to P. aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis aged 18 years and older.  
The recently available assessment of the completed open-label, randomised, Phase 3 study, GS-US-
205-0110 reconfirmed the favourable benefit/risk.  
The Marketing Authorisation Holder has provided a revised draft letter of undertaking addressing the 
timeframes for the submission of FUM 5 and 6. 
As the applicant has fulfilled all specific obligations, the CHMP is of the opinion that the conditional 
marketing authorisation can be converted in a marketing authorisation not subject to specific 
obligation. 
The MAH should continue to submit 6 monthly PSURs (for the next two years).

5.  Outcome of the conditional renewal procedure 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  the  available  information  on  the  status  of  the  fulfilment  of  Specific 
Obligations and having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
quality,  safety  and  efficacy  of  this  medicinal  product  continues  to  be  adequately  and  sufficiently 
demonstrated. 
In addition, the CHMP concludes that all Specific Obligations as laid down in Annex II.C to the Opinion 
of the last Renewal are fulfilled and therefore recommends that a Marketing Authorisation not “subject 
to specific obligations” be granted. 
The opinion requires amendments to the terms of the Community Marketing Authorisation. 
The following annexes have been amended: Annexes I, II and IIIB.

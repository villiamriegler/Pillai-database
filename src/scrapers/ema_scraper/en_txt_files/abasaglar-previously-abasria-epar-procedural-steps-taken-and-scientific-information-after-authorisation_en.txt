are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

C.I.Z (Type II): Update of section 4.4 and 4.6 of the

To reduce the risk of nocturnal and early morning 
Labelling and 
From other twice daily NPH insulin to ABASAGLAR 
SmPC of the cartridge presentations 
(EU/1/44/94/001-4,9) to only recommend the use of 
cartridges in Lilly reusable pens and to remove the 
suggestion to withdraw insulin from a syringe.   
C.I.2 (Type IB): Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC 
in order to align the wording on switching from 3000 
U/ml to 100 U/ml with the reference product, Lantus.  
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to replace U/ml by 
hypoglycaemia, patients who are changing their basal 
insulin regimen from a twice daily NPH insulin to a once 
daily regimen with ABASAGLAR should reduce their daily 
dose of basal insulin by 20-30 % during the first weeks of 
treatment.  
Switch from insulin glargine 300 units/ml to ABASAGLAR 
ABASAGLAR and Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 units/ml) are 
not bioequivalent and are not directly interchangeable. To 
reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, patients who are changing

units/ml, to amend the details of the Polish affiliate, 
to correct the image of the KwikPen and to bring the 
PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0. 
C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and 
Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation 
C.I.2.a - Change in the SPC, Labelling or PL of a 
generic/hybrid/biosimilar products following 
assessment of the same change for the reference 
product - Implementation of change(s) for which NO 
new additional data is required to be submitted by 
the MAH 
their basal insulin regimen from an insulin regimen with 
once daily insulin glargine 300 units/ml to a once daily 
regimen with ABASAGLAR should reduce their dose by 
approximately 20%. 
During the first weeks the reduction should, at least 
partially, be compensated by an increase in mealtime 
insulin, after this period the regimen should be adjusted 
individually.  
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Pens to be used with ABASAGLAR cartridges  
The cartridges should only be used in conjunction with a 
Lilly reusable insulin pen and should not be used with any 
other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has not been 
established with other pens.  
6.6  
Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Insulin pen 
The ABASAGLAR cartridges are to be used only in 
conjunction with a Lilly reusable insulin pen (see section 
4.4).  
The pen should be used as recommended in the 
information provided with the device.  
The manufacturer's instructions for using the pen must be 
Page 7/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the 
needle, and administering the insulin injection.  
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due 
to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded, and a new 
insulin pen has to be used.

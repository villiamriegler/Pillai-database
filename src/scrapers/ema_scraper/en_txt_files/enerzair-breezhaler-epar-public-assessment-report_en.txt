2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
2.1.1.  Disease or condition
Treatment of asthma in adults not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a long-
acting beta2-agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid. This includes patients with difficult-to-treat asthma 
and severe asthma. According to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guide, asthma can be defined 
as;
 Difficult-to-treat- poor symptom control and/or exacerbations despite high dose preventer 
treatment (GINA treatment step 4-5) 

Severe poor symptom control and/or exacerbations despite maximal optimised therapy (GINA 
step 5 +- add on therapy) and treatment of contributory factors and good adherence and 
inhaler technique.
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways associated with airways inflammation and 
hyper-responsiveness. 
Asthma is a common disease affecting an estimated 340 million people worldwide. The Global Asthma 
Report estimates that 23.7 million disability-adjusted life years are lost annually due to asthma, 
representing 1% of the total global burden. The prevalence in Europe is up to 10%. 
It is estimated in Europe that 17% of patients have difficulty to treat asthma and 3-4% have severe 
asthma. (GINA)
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 9/142
2.1.2.  Aetiology and pathogenesis
The pathophysiology of asthma is characterised by inflammation and intermittent obstruction of the 
airways and bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Inflammation in asthma generally involves the same cells 
involved in the allergic response in the nasal passages and skin, (atopy) and includes mast cells, 
eosinophils and Th2 lymphocytes.  
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis
Asthma causes symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath and cough that vary in frequency and 
intensity and symptoms are associated with variability in airflow. Symptoms occur particularly at night 
or in the early morning. Patients with asthma can experience exacerbations that may be life 
threatening.
Factors that may trigger or worsen symptoms include; allergens (e.g. dust mite, pollen), viral 
infections, tobacco smoke, exercise, stress and some drugs including beta-blockers and NSAIDs.
Diagnosis is based on two key features:
•
•
A history of variable respiratory symptoms
variable expiratory airflow limitation and reversibility
Patient scan be classified as mild, moderate and severe based on symptom control and treatment 
requirements. 
2.1.4.  Management
The long-term treatment goals are symptom control and risk reduction. Symptom control aims to have 
only occasional daytime symptoms without sleep disturbance or exercise limitation. Risk reduction 
involves preventing exacerbations, preserving lung function and avoiding asthma deaths. 
Patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a LABA and ICS at GINA step 4 
or 5 (depending on the dose of ICS) have the following treatment options in addition to optimising 
treatment compliance and modifying risk factors;



Increase to high dose ICS
Add on LAMA -tiotropium
Add on leukotriene receptor antagonists
 Oral corticosteroids at step 5

Phenotyping for eosinphillic asthma (type 2 inflammation) and considering biological therapy if 
confirmed.
Unmet need: It is recognised that inadequate asthma control due to severity or poor compliance is 
present in up to 50% of asthma patients and that therapeutic options are limited at GINA step 5.
About the product



Each low-strength capsule contains 150 µg of indacaterol (as acetate), 50 µg of glycopyrronium (as 
bromide) and 80 µg of mometasone furoate; this provides a delivered dose of indacaterol (as 
acetate) 114 µg, glycopyrronium (as bromide) 46 µg, and mometasone furoate 68 µg.
Each high-strength capsule contains 150 µg of indacaterol (as acetate), 50 µg of glycopyrronium 
(as bromide) and 160 µg of mometasone furoate; this provides a delivered dose of indacaterol (as 
acetate) 114 µg, glycopyrronium (as bromide) 46 µg, and mometasone furoate 136 µg.
Claimed indication and recommendation for use
 ‘indicated as a once-daily maintenance treatment of asthma, and to reduce asthma exacerbations, in 
adults not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and an 
inhaled corticosteroid’
The maximum recommended dose is Enerzair Breezhaler 114 mcg/46 mcg/136 mcg once daily.
No dose adjustment is proposed for renal or hepatic impairment or for patients over 65.
Pharmacological classification.
Proposed ATC code R03AL12
Therapeutic subgroup:  Drugs for obstructive airway diseases
The applicant applied to the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre (WHOCC) for an ATC code. 
The WHO proposed the ATC code R03AL12, for approval by the WHO International Working Group for 
Drug Statistics Methodology during the March 2019 meeting. Upon absence of objection following its 
subsequent publishing on the WHO website, the code will be considered final and implemented in the 
ATC Index as of January 2020.
Mode of action
Indacaterol is a long acting beta agonist. It is a partial agonist at the human beta2-adrenoceptor. 
Indacaterol acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. It has a rapid onset of action and a long 
duration of action.
Glycopyrronium is an inhaled long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (anticholinergic) which works 
by blocking the bronchoconstrictor action of acetylcholine on airway smooth muscle cells, thereby 
dilating the airways.
Mometasone furoate is a synthetic corticosteroid with high affinity for glucocorticoid receptors and anti-
inflammatory properties
Type of Application and aspects on development
The clinical development program for QVM149 consisted of efficacy and safety data from a pivotal, 
multi-center, Phase III study in asthma patients (GINA step 4 and 5): Study CQVM149B2302.
For Study CQVM149B2302, 2 separate clinical study reports (CSRs) were planned: a primary analysis 
CSR I and the final CSR II:
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 11/142

 CSR I included all patients who completed Week 26 (V207) assessments or withdrew from the 
study. It includes primary and key secondary endpoints as well as other prespecified endpoints 
at Week 26. The endpoints evaluated after Week 26 were treated as exploratory.

 CSR II will be written after the last patient has completed the 52-week treatment period, plus 
30 day follow-up or prematurely discontinued from the study.
The initial MA submission is performed on the basis of CSR I. 
QVM149 was also investigated in two Phase II lung function studies [Study CQVM149B2208] and 
[Study CQVM149B2209] to investigate its pharmacodynamics in asthma and two studies in healthy 
volunteers [Study CQVM149B1101] and [Study CQVM149B2102] to investigate different aspects of its 
pharmacokinetics.
The clinical development programme of QVM149 was conducted according to the following guidance:

Active substances
The product contains three established active substances: indacaterol (as acetate), glycopyrronium 
bromide and mometasone furoate. 
2.2.2.  Active substance – Indacaterol acetate
General information
The chemical name of indacaterol acetate is 5,6-Diethyl-N-[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-
dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethyl]-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-aminium acetate corresponding to the molecular 
formula (C24H29N2O3)(C2H3O2). It has a relative molecular mass of 452.55 g/mol and the following 
structure:
Figure 1: Indacaterol acetate structure
The chemical structure of indacaterol acetate was elucidated by elemental analysis, UV and IR 
spectroscopy, proton NMR, carbon NMR and mass spectroscopy. The solid state properties of the active 
substance were measured by x-ray crystallography (XPRD) and differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC).
Indacaterol acetate is a non-solvated, slightly hygroscopic, crystalline micronised white to yellow or 
beige powder. 
Indacaterol acetate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The chirality is 
controlled in the first step of the synthesis with levels of S-isomer controlled as an impurity by normal 
phase HPLC with UV detection in subsequent intermediates and in the final active substance. 
Polymorphism has been observed for indacaterol acetate. Several crystalline forms were identified 
during polymorphism studies performed during development. Only Form A is manufactured using the 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 13/142
proposed manufacturing process; the presence of other crystalline forms has never been observed 
during development and batch release testing. Stability studies confirmed that Form A is stable during 
long term and accelerated storage conditions in the selected packaging materials. The identity of Form 
A is controlled as release specification via XPRD analysis.
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
The manufacturing process, including the relevant in process controls (IPCs), is the same as the 
approved commercial manufacturing process of indacaterol maleate used in Ultibro Breezhaler 
(EMEA/H/C/002679) with additional steps added to produce the acetate salt. Indacaterol acetate is 
synthesized in six main steps with isolated intermediates followed by micronisation. The synthesis uses 
well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 14/142
Several critical process parameters (CPPs) and related operating ranges  have been identified. 
Adequate IPCs are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents are satisfactory. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances.
Potential and actual impurities from the starting material, intermediates and active substance were 
identified and assessed for mutagenic potential in line with ICH M7. All mutagenic impurities identified 
are controlled in either the relevant intermediate or in the active substance specifications. The purge 
and fate of residual solvents has been discussed and several residual solvents are controlled in the 
active substance specifications, including benzene which may be introduced as a solvent impurity.
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. Three manufacturing processes were applied during development which 
differed in the selection of starting materials (initially indacaterol maleate was used) and 
implementation of variations in the final micronisation and deamorphisation steps. Changes introduced 
have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. The quality of the active substance 
used in the various phases of the development is considered to be comparable with that produced by 
the proposed commercial process.
Specification
The specification of indacaterol acetate includes tests for appearance, clarity and colour of the solution 
(Ph. Eur.), particle size (laser light diffraction), identity (IR and XRPD), enantiomer (HPLC), related 
substances (HPLC), assay of salt forming agent (titration), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (Headspace 
GC), water content (KF), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), amorphous content (microcalorimetry) and 
microbiology (Ph. Eur.).
The proposed specification is in line with ICH Q6A. Impurities present at higher than the qualification 
threshold, according to ICH Q3A, were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate 
specifications have been set. Specifications limits have been set based on regulatory requirements and 
batch analysis data. The specification for particle size and amorphous content is based on the finished 
product requirements and is considered adequate for this inhalation product. The residual solvents 
specification has been set in line with ICH Q3C in light of the experience gained during development 
and the manufacture of commercial scale batches of indacaterol acetate. There are 7 potential solvents 
controlled in the final active substance 4 of which are specified. The sum of the residual solvents refers 
to the specified residual solvents and 3 other unspecified solvents. .
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standard used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

EMA/271332/2020 
Page 15/142
Batch analysis data (18 batches, including clinical, stability and commercial manufactured at a scale up 
to commercial scale) of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch.
Stability
Stability data from 3 batches of indacaterol acetate from the proposed manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate 
(30 ºC / 65% RH) conditions and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The parameters tested are the same as for release, with the exception of assay of salt forming agent 
and residual solvents which were not tested. This is acceptable as these parameters are not stability 
indicating. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications at long term storage conditions, with no significant 
increase in impurities or decrease in assay observed. Under accelerated conditions, discolouration has 
been observed for the tests ‘appearance by visual examination’ and ‘colour of solution’. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The storage 
conditions recommend protection from light. 
Forced degradation studies (high temperature on dry matter, 100°C, and high temperature in water, 
acid and oxidative conditions in solution for three days and in basic conditions for 4 hours) were 
performed on one batch. Results on stress conditions in the solid state (1-month open storage under 
dry and humid conditions at 50°C and 60°C), influence of oxygen, nitrogen and water for 1 week at 
80°C and forced decomposition (3 days at 100°C in the solid state) were also provided on one batch. A 
racemisation and an hygroscopicity study were also performed on one batch. 
The degradation pathways of the active substance have been identified and the analytical methods 
have been demonstrated to be stability indicating. In the racemisation study concluded that at 37°C in 
an aqueous solution, at pH close to neutral, only slight racemisation was observed. However, at 50°C, 
significant racemisation was observed in all solutions with highest levels observed in basic solution. 
The hygroscopicity study concluded that the active substance is only slightly hygroscopic.
The stability results justify the proposed retest period for the active substance of 24 months when 
stored as ‘do not store above 25°C, protect from light’ in the proposed container.
2.2.3.  Active substance – Glycopyrronium bromide
General information

phenylacetyl]oxy}-1,1-dimethylpyrrolidin-1-ium bromide corresponding to the molecular formula 
C19H28NO3.Br. It has a relative molecular mass of 398.335 g/mol and the following structure:
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 16/142
Figure 2: Glycopirronum bromide structure
The chemical structure of glycopyrronium bromide was elucidated by elemental analysis, UV, Infrared, 
NMR and mass spectrometry. 
The active substance is a non hygroscopic micronised white powder, freely soluble in water. 
The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and x-ray crystallography (XPRD). The active substance has 
2 asymmetric carbon atoms and is a racemic mixture of the 2S, 3R and 2R, 3S configurations. The 
racemic mixture RS/SR is separated from the RR/SS diasteromers by repeated crystallisation during 
the manufacture of the active substance. Glycopyrronium bromide does not isomerise in water, acidic 
and slightly basic consitions, as described under stability studies.
Polymorphism has not been observed for glycopyrronium bromide. Glycopyrronium bromide consists of 
a single non-hygroscopic polymorphic form, Form A. No forms other than form A were observed by 
crystallisation or equilibration studies with different solvents. No other form was found in the 
performed compression and granulation experiments. No polymorphic form change has been found by 
micronisation and no amorphous active substance could be detected after micronisation. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
Glycopyrronium bromide is synthesized in two main steps. The synthesis uses well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances.
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. The manufacturing process has undergone two changes which have 
been included to improve yield and increase safety and handling of the material during process 
development. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. The 
quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process.

Specification
The specification of glycopyrronium bromide includes tests for appearance, identity (IR,XRPD, RP-HPLC), 
related  substances  (RP-HPLC),  R,R  &  S,S  pair  of  stereoisomers  (HPLC), 
loss  on  drying 
(thermogravimetry),  residual  solvents  (GC),  sulphated  ash  (Ph.  Eur.),  heavy  metals  (DCP/ICP-OES), 
acidity or alkalinity (Ph. Eur.), clarity of the solution (Ph. Eur.), colour of the solution (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(RP-HPLC  and  titration),  assay  of  salt  forming  agent  (titration),  assay  (HPLC)  and  microbiology  (Ph. 
Eur.).The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. 
Eur. monograph. Additional specifications have been set for residual solvents, heavy metals and R,R and 
S,S pair of stereoisomers. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.
Batch analysis data from 7 commercial batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.
Stability
Stability data from 6 pilot batches of glycopyrronium bromide from the proposed manufacturer stored 
in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) 
and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH), according to the ICH 
guidelines, were provided. 
The parameters tested are the same as for release, with the exception of residual solvents, sulphated 
ash, heavy metals, acidity or alkalinity, assay and assay of salt forming agent by titration, which were 
not tested. This is acceptable as these parameters are not stability indicating. The analytical methods 
used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. All tested parameters were within the 
specifications at long term and accelerated storage conditions and no degradation was observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on two batches. All tests 
remained within specification after exposure to light, as per ICH QIB; no changes were observed in the 
tested parameters. 
Stress testing and forced degradation studies were also performed on two batches of the finished 
product. For the stress testing, samples were stored for 1 month at 50ºC and 60ºC, each at <30% RH 
and at 75% RH and for 1 month at 80ºC under nitrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen with 2% water. After 1 
month at 50°C and 60°C under dry atmosphere (< 30% RH) and humid conditions (75% RH) no 
degradation or isomerization was observed and there were no significant changes in any other quality 
parameters the active substance. In the solid state in the absence of water the active substance is 
stable in inert (nitrogen) and oxygen atmospheres for 1 month at 80°C and does not show any 
change; when stored under nitrogen with 2% water at 80°C 
Forced degradation studies (high temperature, 100°C, on dry matter and in water, acidic, basic and 
oxidative conditions in solution for three days and in basic conditions for 4 hours) were performed on 
two batches. Results on stress conditions indicate that glycopyrronium bromide is stable at 100°C for 
three days in the dry solid state whilst in the aqueous media shows discolouration and different 
significant degrees of degradation, which was highest in strong basic conditions. The degradation 
pathways have been investigated and satisfactorily described. 
Two batches were tested in the isomerisation study and hygroscopicity study. Glycopyrronium bromide 
does not isomerise in water, acidic and slightly basic conditions. At room temperature the water uptake 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 18/142
is less than 0.05% after 1 day at 80% and 93% relative humidity and also after 1 week at 58% and 
75% relative humidity. Therefore, glycopyrronium bromide active substance can be classified as non 
hygroscopic.
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is stable. 
The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months when stored in the proposed 
container.
2.2.4.  Active substance – Mometasone furoate
General information
The chemical name of mometasone furoate is [(8S,9R,10S,11S,13S,14S,16R,17R)-9-chloro-17-(2-
chloroacetyl)-11-hydroxy-10,13,16-trimethyl-3-oxo-6,7,8,11,12,14,15,16-
octahydrocyclopenta[a]phenanthren-17-yl] furan-2-carboxylate, corresponding to the molecular 
formula C27H30Cl2O6. It has a relative molecular mass of 521.43 g/mol and the following structure:
Figure 3: Mometasone furoate structure
The chemical structure of mometasone furoate was elucidated using elemental analysis, UV, IR, proton 
NMR, carbon NMR, electron ionisation mass spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment mass 
spectrometry. The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by optical rotation, 
circular dichroism, XPRD and DSC.
The active substance is a micronised white powder with low solubility in water. 
Mometasone furoate has eight chiral centres; however, it does not exhibit isomerism since the 
stereochemistry is determined by the starting material, derived from a natural product, and ensured 
throughout the synthesis. The optically pure starting material leads to optically pure mometasone 
furoate, in which the configuration at each of the chiral centres is the same as in the starting material, 
with the exception of that at carbon-9, which has been inverted. Enantiomeric purity is also controlled 
routinely by optical rotation in the active substance specification. Mometasone furoate exhibits 
pseudopolymorphism in the form of the monohydrate, which can be formed when the active substance 
is crystallised from organic-aqueous solvent systems. Only a single polymorphic form of anhydrous 
mometasone furoate is produced by the commercial synthetic process as verified by infrared and X-ray 
diffraction analyses.
Momentasone furoate subject to this application is supported by the same quality information as 
Asmanex Twisthaler, marketed in Europe.
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020

specification for particle size is based on the finished product requirements and is considered adequate 
for this inhalation product. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-
compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented.
Batch analysis data (six clinical batches and four commercial batches) of the active substance are 
provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.
Stability

temperature, and photolytic conditions under fluorescent light) solid stress studies (thermal stress at 
170 ºC/3 hours and accelerated stability conditions - 30 ºC/70% RH and 40 ºC/75% RH). The 
degradation impurities observed under various stressed conditions have been identified and include 
impurities listed in the Ph. Eur. Monograph and two additional compounds. The analytical methods 
have been demonstrated to be stability indicating.
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when stored at 
25 °C, with excursions from 15-30 °C, in the proposed container.
2.2.5.  Finished medicinal product
Description of the product
Enerzair Breezhaler is presented as a single-dose inhalation powder in a hard capsule, intended for 
administration using the co-packed ‘Concept 1’ dry-powder inhaler. One strength of the finished 
product is recommended for marketing: each capsule contains 150 µg of indacaterol (as the acetate), 
50 µg of glycopyrronium (as the bromide) and 160 µg of mometasone furoate.
The inhalation powders consist of the three active substances (indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium 
bromide and mometasone furoate), lactose monohydrate as a carrier and magnesium stearate as a 
lubricant. The hypromellose capsule shells are printed with printing ink. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards, when applicable. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph Error! Reference source not found.of this report.
The composition of Enerzair Breezhaler was presented including the composition of the capsule shells 
and the qualitative compositions of printing inks. The imprinting inks, which are used on the outer side 
of the capsule for product identification, are not in direct contact with the inhalation powder 
formulation. The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing.
Enerzair  Breezhaler  is  administered  using  the  ‘Concept1’  dry-powder  inhaler,  a  CE-marked  Class  I 
medical device that is used for other ‘Breezehaler’ medicinal products currently authorised in the EU.
Optionally, the product may be supplied with an electronic sensor device which attaches externally to 
the base of the ‘Concept1’ inhaler. The electronic sensor is a Class I medical device and is meant to be 
used with a mobile and webbased application; sensors and app form a system. The system is 
CE-marked and a declaration of conformity has been provided.
Two strengths were initially developed and proposed for marketing: 
A middle strength: Enerzair Breezhaler 114 micrograms/46 micrograms/68 micrograms inhalation 
powder, hard capsules, each capsule containing 150 mcg of indacaterol (as acetate), 63 mcg of 
glycopyrronium bromide equivalent to 50 mcg of glycopyrronium and 80 mcg of mometasone furoate; 
each single inhalation providing a delivered dose (the dose that leaves the mouthpiece of the inhaler) 
of 114 micrograms of indacaterol (as acetate), 58 micrograms of glycopyrronium bromide equivalent 
to 46 micrograms of glycopyrronium and 68 micrograms of mometasone furoate.
A high strength: Enerzair Breezhaler 114 micrograms/46 micrograms/136 micrograms inhalation 
powder, hard capsules, each capsule containing 150 mcg of indacaterol (as acetate), 63 mcg of 
glycopyrronium bromide equivalent to 50 mcg of glycopyrronium and 160 mcg of mometasone furoate;  
Each single inhalation provides a delivered dose (the dose that leaves the mouthpiece of the inhaler) of

114 micrograms of indacaterol (as acetate), 58 micrograms of glycopyrronium bromide equivalent to 
46 micrograms of glycopyrronium and 136 micrograms of mometasone furoate.
The high strength is the only product presentation recommended for approval based on the rationale 
described in the clinical sections of the assessment report.
Pharmaceutical development
No incompatibilities have been found between the active substances (indacaterol acetate, 
glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate) and the excipients used (lactose monohydrate (Ph. 
Eur.), magnesium stearate (Ph. Eur.) and hypromellose capsule at the selected composition during 
development and registration stability studies. The three active substances loosely bind to the lactose 
carrier. The powder is filled into unit-dose hard capsules composed of hypromellose. 
The pharmaceutical development contains QbD elements. The quality target product profile (QTPP) was 
defined as an oral inhalation dosage form which would deliver a range of doses to meet the needs of 
the target patient population. The formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated 
using design of experiments (DoE) and standalone experiments; material attributes and process 
parameters were evaluated in a failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA). The critical variables (critical 
material attributes (CMAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs)) were identified and proven 
acceptable ranges (PAR) for CMAs, CPPs and non-critical process parameters were derived thereof.
As the optimal aerodynamic particle size range to achieve lung deposition is considered to be 1-5 μm, 
the three active substances are micronised. Indacaterol acetate and mometasone furoate are 
micronised to set specifications. 
The impact of the particle size distribution (PSD) of the active substances, lactose and magnesium 
stearate on the finished product pharmaceutical performance has been investigated by means of the 
fine particle mass (FPM). DoE using pilot and production scale batches produced using manufacturing 
equipment that have the same operating principle were performed. Some of batches used were also 
clinical batches. 
Indacaterol acetate X90, glycopyrronium bromide PI X90, mometasone furoate % <0.5 μm, lactose X10, 
X50 and X90 and magnesium stearate X10, X50 and X90 were considered as factor variables in the DoE 
study. 
Based on development data, the PSD specifications for the active substances and the excipients used 
in the powder blend were confirmed.
The impact of the amorphous content of indacaterol acetate on FPM was investigated; the outcome of 
the study confirmed no significant impact on FPM of the three actives. However, amorphous content 
specification for indacaterol acetate were established to ensure adequate quality of the finished 
product. No detectable amorphous content was found in glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone 
furoate, hence no specification limits were set. 
The potential influence of the hypromellose capsules water content (measured by loss on drying 
(LOD)) on the finished product pharmaceutical performance was assessed by means of FPM with 
finished product batches produced at the designated production site at production scale. Based on the 
development data, the Hypromellose capsule specification for LOD was established to ensure adequate 
control of the finished product performance.
The active substances strength was based on authorised products (Onbrez Breezhaler, Seebri 
Breezhaler and Asmanex Twisthaler) containing the respective active substances as mono-
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 22/142
components. FPM in vitro comparability for indactarol and glycopyrronium in the proposed product with 
the respective mono components marketed products has been successfully demonstrated. 
The formulation of the clinical trial batches is identical to the formulation proposed for marketing.
The manufacturing process was developed based on the process currently used for authorised 
products.  It consists of two main manufacturing steps: blending and encapsulation.
During manufacturing process development, studies were conducted to investigate several 
manufacturing process parameters.
The CPP have been adequately identified and proven acceptable ranges (PAR) for CPP and additional 
non-critical process parameters have been derived. The robustness of the manufacturing process 
within the PARs was confirmed for the production scale during process verification. 
The finished product is administered using a unit-dose dry-powder inhaler, the ‘Concept1’ inhaler which 
is currently used with the marketed products Onbrez Breezhaler (indacaterol maleate), Seebri 
Breezhaler (glycopyrronium bromide), Ultibro Breezhaler (indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium 
bromide) and the recently approved Atectura Breezhaler. The Concept1 inhaler is a CE-marked Class I 
medical device and a declaration of conformity has been submitted.
Optionally, the product may be supplied with an electronic sensor device which attaches to the base of 
the ‘Concept1’ inhaler. The electronic sensor records the actuations of the inhaler and it is intended to 
be used with a mobile application. 
The sensor is an electromechanical modular unit which attaches externally to the base of the inhaler 
body of the Concept1 inhaler via a plastic clip. For illustration the sensor has been shaded in blue in 
Figure 4 below. From the outset, the sensor was developed to prevent any interference with the 
performance of the product. The sensor does not come into contact with any of the critical inhaler 
components. 
During the procedure, comparative data for APSD, FPM and DDU generated when the inhaler is used 
with and without an attached sensor have been provided together with a robustness study and a 
handling/usability evaluation. The data generated confirm that the sensor does not impact the 
performance and usability of the product.

Pharmaceutical performance characterisation studies were conducted with the Concept 1 inhaler and 
meet the requirements outlined in the ‘Guideline on the pharmaceutical quality of inhalation and nasal 
products’ (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005) for pre-metered dry-powder inhalers and the 
pharmacopoeial requirements described in the Inhalanda monograph monograph in “Preparations for 
Inhalation” Ph. Eur. (monograph 0671). 
The pharmaceutical development is considered satisfactory and robustly supported by the experience 
of the applicant. 
The primary packaging is a PA/Alu/PVC – Alu perforated unit dose blister. The material complies with 
Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls
The manufacturing process of the finished product involves a preparation of a Pharmaceutical 
Intermediate (PI). In the next steps the PI is blended with active substances and excipients, and the 
powder blend is filled into hard capsules.
As the product is a specialised pharmaceutical dose form in which the contents of active substances 
are less than 2 % of the formulation, the process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing 
process.
The effect of vibration during transport of the product by air and road was assessed; no significant 
differences were observed for either DDU or FPM between transported and control samples.
Process validation was performed using three consecutive commercial scale batches for each product 
strength manufactured by the proposed manufacturing site, using the same process and equipment for 
commercial manufacture. All six batches met the proposed specification. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification 
The combined finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form:  Appearance of contents and capsule shell, FPM of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone 
(NGI-RPHPLC), degradation products of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone (RPHPLC), 
indacaterol S-enantiomer (‘enantiomer C’, relative to declared content of indacaterol by chiral HPLC-
UV), loss on drying (halogen drying), DDU of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone (NGI and 
RPHPLC-UV), average delivered dose of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone (Ph.Eur.), 
uniformity of dosage units of mometasone, glycopyrronium  and mometasone (RPHPLC-UV), identity 
and assay of indacaterol,  glycopyrronium and mometasone (RPHPLC-UV), microbiology (Ph.Eur.).
The specification tests and acceptance criteria have been set in line with the requirement described in 
the ‘Guideline on the pharmaceutical quality of inhalation and nasal products’ 
(EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005) for pre-metered dry-powder inhalers and with the requirements for 
inhalation powders in “Preparations for Inhalation” Ph. Eur. (monograph 0671). Additional tests to 
ensure the quality of the finished product have also been included. 
The acceptance criteria for FPM (aerodynamic diameter ≤ 5.0 µm) are based on the release and 
stability data for clinical batches and representative technical batches. 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 24/142
The acceptance criteria for any unspecified related substances related to indacaterol at release and 
throughout the shelf life were set. The acceptance criterion for any unspecified related substances 
related to glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone at both release and throughout the shelf life were 
set. The acceptance criteria for a potential mutagen are below the threshold of toxicological concern 
specified in the ‘Guideline on the limits of genotoxic impurities’ (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/251344/2006). 
These limits comply with ICH Q3B ‘Impurities in new drug products’, which specifies a qualification 
threshold of 1.0 %.
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 8 
batches (2 of 125/62.5 µg, 3 of 125/127.5 µg and 3 of 125/260 µg) using a validated ICP-MS method 
was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of 
the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded 
that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory.
The potential risk for the presence of nitrosamines has been assessed and a risk evaluation has been 
provided and no risk has been identified.
The specification tests and limits are considered adequate for this type of pharmaceutical product.
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. The same reference standards used for the controls of the active 
substances are used for the finished product.
Batch analysis results are provided for nine commercial scale batches of the product strength 
recommended for approval (including three clinical batches), manufactured at the proposed 
manufacturing site with the proposed manufacturing method. Some analytical methods were modified 
during product development; however, this does not affect the validity of the results. The appearance 
of the capsule shells used in clinical batches differed from those proposed for the marketed product. 
The identification test by UV was not performed on the clinical batches. With these exceptions, the 
batches complied with the proposed chemical and physical release specifications and showed good 
batch-to-batch consistency, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Container closure system and medical devices
The primary packaging consists of PA/AL/PVC perforated unit-dose blister. Each blister contains 10 
hard capsules. 
The packaging was chosen to provide protection from moisture and light, as discussed in the stability 
section. The primary packaging material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The primary 
packaging is commonly used for inhalation powder, hard capsule, and has been previously approved 
for products marketed by the applicant. The choice of the container closure system has been validated 
by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
The product is administered using the same ‘Concept1’ inhalation device. The Concept1 inhaler is co-
packed with the finished product. The Concept1 inhaler is a CE-marked Class I medical device. An EC 
declaration of conformity has been provided. 
A sensor device is optionally co-packed with the finished product. The sensor is an electromechanical 
modular unit which attaches externally to the base of the inhaler body of the Concept1 inhaler via a 
plastic clip. The electronic sensor is intended to be used with a mobile application (App), iOS/Android,

and webware App. The sensor and the App are part of the same medical device system. The system is a 
CE-marked Class I medical device. An EC declaration of conformity has been provided for the system. 
The sensor confirms the inhalation and use of the Concept1 inhaler by monitoring the capsule piercing 
and detecting the whirring noise of the spinning capsule during the inhalation by recording a date/time 
stamp. The sensor stores Concept1 inhaler inhalation events within its internal microprocessor memory 
over the sensor’s use life. Information is then transmitted from the sensor to the mobile App via 
Bluetooth, which in turn transmits the data to the webware App. The mobile App displays information 
such as weekly dosing trends, tracking of rescue medication, FAQs. Additionally, it reminds patients via 
a programmable acoustic signal to take their medication and informs the patients when the sensor 
reaches the end of its shelf-life. The mobile App also generates a report on the inhaler usage to share 
with a Health Care Practitioner (HCP). 
An illustration overview of the Enerzair Breezhaler medical device system is provided in Figure 5.

Satisfactory information has been provided confirming that the functionality of the medical device 
system is ensured under the Quality Assurance Agreement between the applicant and the supplier of 
the sensor. The sensors are subjected to a functionality test performed by the device manufacturer as 
part of each batch release procedure, prior to tamper-evident packaging and shipment to the 
applicant. An example of the Certificate of Analysis of the sensor has been provided and it is 
satisfactory.
Stability of the product
Stability data from three commercial scale batches for both strengths, which were initially proposed, of 
the  finished  product,  stored  for  up  to  18  months  under  long  term  conditions  (25ºC  /  60%  RH)  and 
intermediate conditions (30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical 
to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance of the contents and of shell, fine particle mass, degradation products, 
enantiomer, loss on drying, UDD, assay and microbial enumeration tests. The analytical procedures used 
are stability indicating. In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability  Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products  and  to  freeze  and  thaw  cycle  test  (four 
complete cycles of -20°C/ambient RH for 6 days, followed by 1 day at 25°C/60% RH).
All results for all batches of the three strengths complied with the proposed shelf-life specifications after 
storage  for  18  months  at  25°C/60%  RH  and  30°C/75%  RH.  Slight  increases  in  the  contents  of 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 26/142
degradation products, and slight decreases in the assays of indacaterol and mometasone were observed 
at both long-term and intermediate storage conditions. No other significant changes or trends are noted 
for the product on storage. The finished product is not sensitive to refrigeration or freezing but it shows 
sensitivity  towards  light.  No  microbial  growth  was  observed  at  any  of  the  storage  conditions  and 
durations.
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months and “Store in the original 
package in order to protect from light and moisture. This medicinal product does not require any 
special temperature storage conditions”, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), are acceptable.

2.2.6.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. Full satisfactory information has been provided in the 
application for the three active substances; additionally, the applicant has a long standing established 
experience for all the active substances as indacaterol acetate is manufactured using indacaterol 
maleate, the active substance in Onbrez Breezhaler, as intermediate, glycopyrronium bromide is the 
active substance used in Seebri and Ultibro Breezhaler and mometasone furoate is the active 
substance in Asmanex Twisthaler; all the named products are authorised in EU member states. The 
finished product is formulated as a powder for inhalation which is pre-dispensed into hard capsules and 
is administered using the ‘Concept1’ inhalation device, a CE-marked Class I medical device. An 
electronic sensor device is optionally co-packed with the finished product and it is intended to be used 
with a mobile application and webware App. The sensor and the App are part of the same medical 
device system; the system is a CE-marked Class I medical device. The information provided on the 
formulation, pharmaceutical development, manufacture, control, container closure system, including 
medical devices, and stability is satisfactory and in accordance with European guidelines. The results of 
tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and 
these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform 
performance in clinical use. 
2.2.7.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
The combination of indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium and mometasone furoate is covered by section 
4.2.1 of the EMAs ‘guideline on the non-clinical development of fixed combinations of medicinal products’ 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005) since it is a fixed combination containing compounds from the same 
classes, as other compounds in well-established combinations. Thus, non-clinical studies conducted with 
the combination are per se not warranted if no pharmacokinetic interactions have been identified. This 
approach is also in line with scientific advice received from CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/629337/2014). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
A  brief  description  of  the  mechanisms  of  action  of  indacaterol,  glycopyrronium  and  mometasone  has 
been submitted by the Applicant. The pharmacology of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone is 
well known, since these substances are in wide and long-term human use, both as monocomponents or 
in  combination.  Each  of  individual  components  are  known  to  have  different  mechanism  of  action. 
Literature references were supplied for LABA/LAMA combination, LABA/ICS combination and LAMA/ICS 
combination.  The  active  components  of  QVM149  are  safely  used  clinically  as  free  or  fixed-dose 
combinations.
Indacaterol
Indacaterol is a potent and near full agonist of the human β2-adrenoceptor. It is a weak partial agonist 
at the β1-adrenoceptor and a full agonist at the β3-adrenoceptor, with selectivity ratios based on 
receptor affinities comparable to other clinically used β2-agonists.
Mometasone 
Mometasone is an ICS with high in vitro binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. While the 
relative receptor affinity of MF is greater than fluticasone propionate and slightly less than fluticasone 
furoate, all three ICS show comparable potencies for functional effects such as inhibition of NF-κB. 
Glycopyrronium
Glycopyrronium  is  a  potent  antagonist  at  human  muscarinic  M1  and  M3  receptors,  displaying  modest 
selectivity for the human M3 over the human M2 receptor with a rapid onset and relatively long duration 
of action.
Indacaterol/Mometasone/ Glycopyrronium
No additional studies for QVM149 were performed.
Secondary and pharmacodynamic studies
Indacaterol

EMA/271332/2020 
Page 28/142
Indacaterol, in addition to the affinity for β1- and β3-adrenoceptors noted above, shows weak affinity 
for α1-adrenoceptors. 
Mometasone
Mometasone in common with other clinically used ICS, has affinity for other nuclear hormone receptors 
including the progesterone receptor.
Glycopyrronium
Glycopyrronium shows weak affinity for the σ1 receptor.
Indacaterol/Mometasone/ Glycopyrronium
No additional studies for QVM149 were performed.
Safety pharmacology programme
Indacaterol/mometasone /Glycopyrronium
Safety pharmacology studies were not conducted with QVM149 as potential effects on the central nervous 
system, cardiovascular system and respiratory function were fully assessed as part of the indacaterol, 
MF and Glycopyrronium monotherapy development programs. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions
The pharmacodynamic interactions of indacaterol, mometasone and Glycopyrronium monotherapy 
were fully evaluated as part of the indacaterol maleate, MF and Glycopyrronium monotherapy 
development programs. No additional studies for QVM 149 were performed.
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics
No  dedicated  non-clinical  PK  studies  with  QVM149  have  been  performed.  Pharmacokinetics  of 
indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone have been investigated in animals and humans, in vitro 
and in vivo. No dedicated distribution, metabolism or excretion studies for the combination or for the 
individual  drug  substances  have  been  submitted.  Instead,  reference  is  made  to  previously  conducted 
studies and bibliographic data on the distribution of these actives. The data presented below were mostly 
obtained from studies conducted after separate administration of indacaterol, MF or glycopyrronium. 
No differences in absorption, bioavailability, tissue distribution and metabolism of indacaterol, 
mometasone furoate (MF) and glycopyrronium were expected between treatments with individual 
components and with the combination product QVM149. A lack of clinical PK interaction was confirmed 
in a healthy volunteer study. 
The summary of methods of analysis used for the assessment of drug substance concentrations in non-
clinical species  matrices is  limited.  Bioanalytical  data  reports  are included as appendices to the study 
reports  of  the  13-week  repeat-dose  inhalation  studies  in  rats  and  dog  for  the  methods  used  for  the 
quantification  of  indacaterol  maleate  in  rat  and  dog  plasma  and  mometasone  furoate  in  rat  and  dog 
plasma. Full method validation reports have also been submitted. Methods were appropriately validated 
in line with the EMAs guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev.1 
Corr. 2**). Not all method validations were conducted to GLP but were conducted to the principles of 
GLP, this is considered acceptable. Some samples were found outside the acceptance criteria for various

validation parameters. In general, it is accepted that deviations noted are unlikely to have a significant 
impact on the interpretation of data generated. 
Absorption and bioavailability 
Indacaterol
Indacaterol was rapidly absorbed following oral (p.o.) administration with Tmax ranging from 0.5 to 
2.3 hours in the various species. 
Based on radioactivity data, absorption was observed to be low to moderate for oral dosing (~ 20-34% 
in rats, 58% in mice, 72% in dog and 33-46% in human) and significantly increased (~ 78-90% in 
rats) for intratracheal (i.t.) dosing. Oral bioavailability of indacaterol was extremely low in mouse (1%) 
and rat (0%, plasma concentrations were undetectable) and moderate in dog (33%). 
The results indicate a moderate to large first-pass effect (about 54% in dog and 99-100% in rodents). 
After i.t. application to rats, bioavailability was high and similar to the extent of pulmonary absorption 
indicating no or only limited lung first-pass. In rat and dog, the absolute inhaled bioavailability of 
indacaterol can be roughly estimated to be about 12% and 14%, respectively.
Mometasone furoate
Glycopyrronium
In all species investigated, glycopyrronium absorption was fast, with Cmax between 0.083 hours and 2 
hours following oral, intratracheal and inhalation administration. Oral absorption and absolute oral 
bioavailability of glycopyrronium were low in rodents (Fa ~ 10-20%, Fabs ~ 1-2%) and humans (Fa ~ 
20-30%, Fabs ~ 4%). After i.t. application the pulmonary bioavailability was assessed at about 96% in 
the rat. Absolute inhaled bioavailability of glycopyrronium was 35% to 50% in rats and 30% to 40% in 
humans. First-pass effect after oral application was > 80% in all species as suggested by the 
comparison of the extent of oral absorption and the bioavailability of glycopyrronium. No significant 
lung first-pass effect occurs in rat though. In human, assuming that 100% of glycopyrronium absorbed 
via the lungs reaches the systemic circulation as unchanged drug, the fraction of an inhaled dose that 
was deposited and absorbed via the lungs was assessed with about 35%. Consequently, assuming 
100% ex-mouthpiece delivery of the dose, the swallowed dose portion after inhalation in human is 
about 65%.
Distribution 
Indacaterol
The binding of indacaterol to plasma proteins was high in all species, with bound fractions between 91 
and 95% . The distribution to red blood cells was moderate, as the drug fraction associated with red 
blood cells was 69-74% in the rat, 53-60% in the dog, and 50-58% in human. Volume of distribution 
(Vss) was generally high (13 L/kg in dog, 26 L/kg in rat and 34 L/kg in mouse) and somewhat lower in 
rabbit (5.3 L/kg). Following administration of radiolabelled indacaterol, drug-related radioactivity was 
widely distributed to most rat tissues with the notable exception of the brain, spinal cord, and testis.
Mometasone furoate
The volume of distribution after i.v. administration in humans was 332L. Based on in vitro findings, the 
drug is highly bound to human plasma proteins (98 to 99%) in the concentration range of 5 to 500 
ng/mL.
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 30/142
Glycopyrronium
Glycopyrronium was mainly present in plasma (92% to 100%) and was bound to plasma proteins to a 
low extent (fraction in plasma 23% to 44%) in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human. Vss of 
glycopyrronium was low in human (0.4 L/kg to 1.2 L/kg) and was moderate in animals (5.4 L/kg in 
dog, 4.5 L/kg in mouse and 11.9 L/kg in rat). Uptake of glycopyrronium-related radioactivity into and 
elimination from the organs and tissues was fast in mice and rats (T1/2 < 24 hours). Glycopyrronium 
and its metabolites did not penetrate the brain of mice, rats or dogs.
Metabolism
Indacaterol
The metabolism of indacaterol in vitro (mouse, rat, dog, human) and in vivo (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, 
human) following i.v., p.o. and i.t. dosing, involved monohydroxylation, O- and Nglucuronidation, and 
both C- and N-dealkylation. No appreciable metabolism was observed in incubations of either human 
pulmonary microsomes or human lung slices.
Parent and monohydroxylated indacaterol or glucuronides were the most prominent drug related 
components observed in plasma and excreta of mice, rat, rabbit, dog and human after p.o., i.v. and i.t. 
(rat only) dosing. Following i.v. application, metabolites in the feces of intact rats accounted for less 
than 2%. However, in bile duct-cannulated rats about 68% of an i.v. dose was excreted as glucuronide 
metabolites via the bile. Based on these results, an integrated metabolism picture of indacaterol can be 
derived: In humans, indacaterol becomes systemically available from the lung, likely without 
pulmonary metabolism.
Independent of the species, systematically available drug undergoes hepatic metabolism by 
hydroxylation and glucuronidation followed by hepatobiliary transport (likely via multidrug resistance 
associated protein 2 (MRP2)) and possibly subsequent hydrolysis by gut bacteria to parent indacaterol.
Metabolism, at least in rats, is likely the main clearance pathway of indacaterol.
Mometasone furoate
After administration of a single 1mg inhaled dose of radio-labeled MF in healthy adult male volunteers, 
MF was extensively metabolized. The drug is primarily metabolized in the liver, at least in part by 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4.
Metabolic pathways include the enzymatic cleavage of the furoate ester (resulting in the formation of 
mometasone) as well as hydroxylation at C-6 and C-21 of mometasone furoate and/or mometasone. 
Mometasone furoate showed little metabolic conversion in vitro in human plasma and S9 fractions of 
homogenized human lung tissue.
Glycopyrronium
Both in vitro (mouse, rat, dog, human) and in vivo (mouse, rat) following i.v., p.o. and i.t. dosing, the 
main biotransformation pathways were hydroxylations with subsequent dehydrogenation. Additionally, 
ester hydrolysis was observed to form the corresponding carboxylic acid metabolite CJL603 (M9). 
Phase II metabolism was demonstrated to play a minor role if any. In human, dog and rat lung 
microsomes unquantifiable metabolism was observed. Following i.v. administration, glycopyrronium 
was metabolized to a high extent in mice and rats (60% to 70% of the dose applied). In humans, the 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 31/142
contribution of metabolism to total clearance after i.v. administration was estimated with maximally 
30% to 40%. Following oral administration, metabolism was the major clearance pathway (around 
90%) in mice and rats. Glycopyrronium and CJL603 (M9) were the most prominent drug-related 
components observed in plasma and excreta following i.v. and i.t. (rat only) dosing in rodents and 
humans. Following p.o. administration, CJL603 was the most prominent drug-related material in 
plasma of rodents and humans indicating quantitatively different metabolism pathways after i.v and 
p.o. dosing in these species. 
Elimination/Excretion
Indacaterol
Similar to human, the fecal route was the predominant route of excretion in all investigated animal 
species (mouse, rat, dog, rabbit) regardless of the route of administration. After an i.v. dose, 
unchanged indacaterol was excreted in both urine and feces (~ 38% in mouse, ~ 40% in dog, ~ 58% 
in rabbit and ~ 60% in rat). In all species, unchanged indacaterol in urine accounted for less than 2% 
of the dose, further indicating that the major route of excretion of indacaterol was via the feces. In rat, 
about 68% of an i.v. dose recovered within 24 hours was excreted via bile in form of glucuronide 
metabolites. 
T1/2 of indacaterol following i.v. administration was about 6 hours in mouse, about 8 hours in rat, 
about 11 hours in rabbit and 20 hours in dog. Following i.t. dosing in rat, T1/2 values of indacaterol 
were in the same range as observed after i.v. administration. In humans, indacaterol serum 
concentrations declined in a multi-phasic manner with an average terminal half-life ranging from 45.5 
to 126 hours. The effective half-life, calculated from the accumulation of indacaterol after repeated 
dosing, ranged from 40 to 52 hours (Onbrez Breezhaler SmPC). Clearance of indacaterol following an 
i.v. dose was high in the mouse (9.4 L/h/kg) and rat (3.7 L/h/kg) and moderate in the rabbit (1.3 
L/h/kg) and dog (1 L/h/kg).
Mometasone
In healthy volunteers administered radio-labeled MF by the Twisthaler device, 74% of the dose was 
recovered in the feces, mostly derived from the proportion of the dose that was deposited in the 
oropharynx and swallowed. Mean urinary recovery was 8% of the dose, while 0–14% was exhaled.
The elimination half-life of MF after intravenous administration in healthy male volunteers was 4.5 
hours and the clearance was 53.5 L/ h. 
Glycopyrronium 
In accordance with the high clearance, excretion of glycopyrronium-related radioactivity into urine and 
feces was fast and complete in all species, generally within 7 days, and with a main radioactive dose 
fraction recovered within 0-24 hours. Following an i.v. dose, glycopyrronium and its metabolites were 
mainly excreted with urine (~ 70% in rodents, > 80% in human). However, following oral application 
drug-related radioactivity was mainly excreted via the fecal route in rodents (> 90%) which is in line 
with the low oral absorption. After i.t. dosing in rat, about 28% and 56% of the administered 
radioactivity was recovered in urine and feces, respectively. In all species investigated, independent of 
the route of administration, unchanged glycopyrronium was predominant in feces and urine. Biliary 
clearance of glycopyrronium was negligible in rats and humans.
The apparent systemic elimination half-lives (T1/2) of glycopyrronium in mice, dog and human 
following i.v., i.t. and/or oral (p.o.) dosing were short (≤ 6 hours). Prolonged T1/2 values were 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 32/142
determined after i.v. administration in rat (up to 23 hours) and following inhaled application in human 
(30 hours and more). The observed difference in T1/2 between intravenous dosing and inhalation in 
human, results from a slower elimination from the lung than from the systemic compartment, most 
likely due to sustained lung absorption as also observed in rats (Study R1070398). The estimated 
systemic blood clearances were generally equal to or above the hepatic blood flow (15.5 L/h/kg in 
mouse, 5.4 L/h/kg in rat, 3.2 L/h/kg in dog and 0.7 L/h/kg in human) indicating the involvement of an 
extra-hepatic elimination pathway.
Indacaterol/mometasone
As part of QVM149 development, the terminal half-life was similar following inhalation via the 
Twisthaler or the Concept1 devices (mean T1/2: 12-13 h).
Pregnant animals and lactation
Indacaterol
Indacaterol and/or its metabolites passed the placenta-blood-barrier in pregnant rats and were 
transferred rapidly into the milk of lactating rats.
Mometasone 
Mometasone furoate was excreted in low doses in the milk of suckling rats.
Glycopyrronium 
Glycopyrronium and its metabolites did not cross the placental barrier of pregnant rats, dogs, rabbits 
and humans to a substantial degree. Glycopyrronium and its metabolites passed into the milk of 
lactating rats.
Toxicokinetics 
A bridging toxicology program was completed for the fixed-dose combination of indacaterol maleate 
and mometasone furoate.  
The applicant has presented a dedicated single dose inhalation PK study in rats and a 4-week repeat-
dose inhalation toxicity study in dogs to bridge the acetate salt of indacaterol proposed for use in this 
combination to the maleate form which was previously characterised in non-clinical studies conducted to 
support the development of the monocomponent product (Onbrez) and the licenced combination product 
with glycopyrronium (Ultibro). In the single dose rat PK study, some minor differences in systemic and 
local (lung) exposures are evident between maleate and acetate salt treated groups with acetate treated 
groups consistently exhibiting higher dose normalised systemic exposures in terms of AUC and Cmax. A 
similar (though less pronounced) trend was observed in the dog study. No statistical analyses of these 
data have been performed. 
TK  parameters  for  indacaterol  maleate  and  mometasone  furoate  following  combination  inhalation 
administration  were  acquired  in  rat  and  dog  in  GLP-compliant  13-week  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies. 
Combination  administration  was  not  associated  with  any  difference  in  exposure  relative  to 
monocomponent administration in either species.
The applicant has submitted an assessment of the potential for DDI between the three actives based on 
data sourced from the dossiers for marketed indacaterol and glycopyrronium products. This includes a 
summary of their activity as inhibitors/inducers or substrates for metabolic enzymes and/or transporters. 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 33/142
These actives are  not predicted to inhibit/induce metabolic enzymes or drug transporters at systemic 
exposures predicted following clinical administration. Indacaterol is identified as being metabolised via 
CYP3A4 and as a p-gp substrate and thus co-administration of inhibitors of these enzymes/transporters 
may  result  in  an  increase  in  systemic  exposure  (≈ 2  fold).  As  glycopyrronium  is  primarily  eliminated 
unchanged, co-administration of inhibitors/inducers of CYPs involved in glycopyrronium metabolism is 
considered unlikely to result in a clinically meaningful change in exposure.
The available preclinical information does not suggest any potential for mutual interactions that would 
warrant  further  investigations.  A  clinical  pharmacokinetic  component  interaction  study  in  healthy 
volunteers [Study CQVM149B2102] demonstrated that the exposure to the individual components after 
administering  the  fixed  dose  combination  QVM149  was  comparable  to  exposure  obtained  after 
administration of the individual monotherapy components alone.
TK  acquired  in  non-clinical  species  do  not  indicated  any  direct  DDI  following  co-administration  of 
glycopyrronium/indacaterol  or  indacaterol/mometasone  furoate.  The  presented  pharmacokinetic  and 
toxicokinetic data do not indicate that indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone combination carry 
any new risk of pharmacokinetic drug interactions.
2.3.4.  Toxicology
The nonclinical safety evaluation of QVM149 is based upon the complete toxicology programs conducted 
for the individual monotherapy components that included chronic toxicity, reproductive and development 
toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies. Bridging toxicology programs were performed for the 
fixed-dose combinations of indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium (QVA149) and indacaterol maleate 
and mometasone furoate (QMF149).
The applicant has submitted a brief summary of the toxicological information from individual agents 
sourced from literature and the original submission dossiers. The data are summarised below: 
Indacaterol 
Inhalation toxicity studies in dogs show the typical alterations expected for inhaled β2-adrenergic 
agonists where high systemic exposure has been achieved (e.g. increased heart rate at most doses, 
heart lesions at higher doses and/or glycogen mediated periportal hepatocellular vacuolation). These 
changes are in-line with the known exaggerated pharmacological response to β2-adrenergic agonists 
due to systemic exposure and are not a result of direct toxicity. β2-adrenergic receptor mediated 
vasodilation and hypotension is associated with reflex tachycardia which, when excessive, causes 
ischemic damage in the heart. Heart rate increase is the most sensitive parameter indicating systemic 
exposure to indacaterol and it occurred in the absence of pathological changes in the heart and the 
physiological response in the liver. Alterations observed in the upper respiratory tract of rats were 
consistent with mild local irritation. 
Embryo-fetal development studies by subcutaneous administration in rats and rabbits showed no 
evidence of teratogenicity. No effects were observed during a fertility and early embryonic 
development study or a pre- and post-natal development study in rats by subcutaneous 
administration. 
In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies did not indicate any genotoxic potential. Indacaterol was not 
carcinogenic at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in a 26-week oral study in CB6F1/TgrasH2 hemizygous 
mice. Neoplastic findings associated with indacaterol treatment during a 104-week inhalation rat 
carcinogenicity study were not considered relevant for humans during therapeutic use. Increased 
incidences of ovarian leiomyoma and focal hyperplasia of the ovarian smooth muscle in females are 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 34/142
consistent with the known response of rodents to treatment with high doses of β2-adrenergic agonists 
and are considered a consequence of an exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect.
Mometasone furoate
Extensive nonclinical toxicology studies have been conducted in support of the various formulations of 
MF. These studies included chronic, reproductive, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity studies. No 
toxicological effects unique to MF exposure have been demonstrated during the course of preclinical 
testing. All findings were typical of glucocorticoid class effects and followed the well-established dose-
response and dose-duration relationships for systemic pharmacologic effects of glucocorticoids. 
Expected exposure-related glucocorticoid effects included alterations in hematology parameters, as 
well as alopecia/hypotrichosis, growth retardation, adrenal suppression, decreased tracheal globular 
leukocytes, and increased adipose tissue in bone marrow. There were expected changes in 
carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism, and on skin and wound healing. Expected changes in 
serum liver enzyme levels and urine volumes and osmolalities also occurred. MF also caused typical 
glucocorticoid lympholytic and immunosuppressive effects. 
Like other glucocorticoids, MF is a teratogen in rodents and rabbits. 
There was no effect on fertility in nonclinical studies of reproductive function. Preclinical studies 
demonstrate that MF is devoid of androgenic, antiandrogenic, estrogenic, or anti-estrogenic activity 
but, like other glucocorticoids, exhibits some anti-uterotrophic activity and delays vaginal opening in 
animal models (rodent) at high concentrations. MF demonstrated a clastogenic potential in vitro at high 
concentrations as is shown with other glucocorticoids. MF was non-mutagenic in a number of genetic 
toxicity studies, including the mouse lymphoma assay, the Salmonella/E. coli/mammalian microsome 
bioassay, the chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the mouse micronucleus 
assay, and the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. The carcinogenicity potential of inhaled MF (aerosol 
with CFC propellant and surfactant) was investigated in 24-month studies in mice and rats. No 
statistically significant dose-response relationship was detected for any of the tumor types.
Glycopyrronium 
Pathology changes during 4-, 13- and 26-week inhalation toxicity studies in rats included increased 
porphyrin deposition in the Harderian glands consistent with an expected pharmacologic effect on 
glandular secretion and epithelial changes in the nasal cavity and larynx suggestive of mild local 
irritation which is frequently observed in rodent inhalation studies. Minimal epithelial hypertrophy at 
the bronchioloalveolar junction of the lung during the 13- and 26-week inhalation toxicity studies in 
rats is regarded as a non-specific adaptive response. The 26-week inhalation toxicity study in rats also 
revealed lenticular changes during ophthalmoscopy evaluations. Similar findings have been described 
for other muscarinic antagonists (Durand et al 2002). These changes are considered to be associated 
with the nose-only inhalation administration procedure in rodents which may result in high local 
concentrations in the eye following direct exposure to the test article aerosols and are therefore of 
limited relevance for therapeutic use in patients. Four- and 39-week inhalation toxicity studies in dogs 
revealed a number of reversible changes that were attributable to the expected pharmacological action 
of glycopyrronium. These included mucoid ocular discharge, conjunctival hyperemia and faint corneal 
opacities and minimal to slight hypertrophy of the lacrimal gland that correlated with decreased 
lacrimal gland secretions. Minimal to slight ectasia of the ducts and/or alveoli and minimal 
inflammation of the submucosal glands of the pharynx and hypertrophy of the salivary gland secretory 
cells were also apparent. A positive chronotropic effect of glycopyrronium was noted as mild to 
moderate increases in mean heart rate. Glycopyrronium was not mutagenic or teratogenic, nor did it 
have any effects on male or female fertility or on post-natal development in standard preclinical 
models at high systemic exposures. No evidence of carcinogenic potential was seen during a 2-year 
inhalation study in rats and a 26-week oral study in transgenic mice.

Repeat dose toxicity
No repeat dose toxicity studies on the combination of the three agents have been submitted. The 
applicant has justified this approach on the basis that the safety of all three mono-components has 
been characterised non-clinically and clinically in the development programs of the respective single 
active [Indacaterol;Onbrez Breezhaler (EMEA/H/C/001114), Glycopyrronium;Seebri Breezhaler 
(EMEA/H/C/002430) and mometasone; Asmanex Twisthaler (SE/H/1822/001- 002)] and combination 
products [Indacaterol and glycopyrronium; Ultibro Breezhaler (EMEA/H/C/002679)] administered via 
the same route of administration. Furthermore, safety data is available from their use in free 
combination and similar combination inhalation products (i.e. LABA, LAMA, GC) have previously been 
authorised (of note, to date for the treatment of COPD only). 
To complete the non-clinical safety package, the applicant has submitted further GLP-compliant 13-week 
repeat-dose inhalation toxicity bridging studies of a combination of indacaterol maleate and mometasone 
furoate.  The  primary  results  of  these  studies  are  in  line  with  the  known  pharmacology  of  the  mono-
components.  No  NOAEL  defined  due  to  the  adverse  effects  of  organ  weights,  pathology  and 
haematological  measures  related  to  the  glucocorticoid  activity  of  mometasone  furoate.  These  effects 
included adrenal atrophy, decreased in plasma lymphocyte counts, lymphoid tissue depletion. In general, 
these effects were comparable between all groups dosed with mometasone with no significant synergistic 
toxicities evident following co-administration with Indacaterol maleate. 
A single dose inhalation study in rats did not reveal significant differences between indacaterol salts in 
terms of lung weights or macroscopic findings. Minor differences in PK were observed with a trend for 
acetate salt treated animals exhibiting an increase in systemic exposure relative to maleate salt treated 
animals. 
In the 4-week repeat dose toxicity study in dog there was a more pronounced treatment related increase 
in  HR  and  increased  severity  of  cardiac  fibrosis  in  acetate  relative  to  maleate  salt  treated  animals. 
Ventricular premature complexes (VPC) were reported in two acetate treated males and females, but in 
no maleate treated animals. These effects were considered (acetate salt) treatment related. There was 
a slight trend for an increase in dose normalised systemic exposures in the acetate treated groups, but 
this was relatively minor. 
Genotoxicity
No  new  genotoxicity  studies  have  been  conducted.  The  genotoxic  potential  of  indacaterol, 
glycopyrronium  and  MF  were  fully  evaluated  as  part  of  their  individual  development  programs  and 
described below: 
 Standard tests of indacaterol and glycopyrronium did not indicate any genotoxic potential. 
Mometasone furoate demonstrates clastogenicity at high concentrations in-vitro, a known class related 
effect  of  glucocorticoids  and  was  not  mutagenic  in  a  number  of  other  assays.  It  is  accepted  that  no 
mutagenic  effects  are  anticipated  at  clinically  relevant  exposures,  and  therefore  the  absence  of  this 
information from the proposed SmPC is accepted.
Carcinogenicity
In accordance with ICH guidance ICH M3 (R2) (2009), no carcinogenicity have been conducted with 
the QVM149 combination. The carcinogenic potential of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and MF were 
assessed as part of their individual development programs and the results are summarized below.
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 36/142
Indacaterol
Carcinogenicity was assessed in a two-year rat study and a six-month transgenic mouse study. 
Increased incidences of benign ovarian leiomyoma and focal hyperplasia of ovarian smooth muscle in 
rats were consistent with similar findings reported for other beta2-adrenergic agonists. No evidence of 
carcinogenicity was seen in mice.
All these findings occurred at exposures sufficiently in excess of those anticipated in humans.
Glycopyrronium
Carcinogenicity studies in transgenic mice using oral administration and in rats using inhalation 
administration revealed no evidence of carcinogenicity.
Mometasone furoate
In carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, inhaled mometasone furoate demonstrated no statistically 
significant increase in the incidence of tumours.
Reproduction Toxicity
In  accordance  with  ICH  guidance  ICH  M3  (R2)  (2009),  reproductive  toxicity  studies  have  not  been 
conducted  with  the  QVM149  combination.  This  is  acceptable  and  information  on  findings  from  the 
individual components is included in the SmPC. Of note, mometasone furoate was found to be teratogenic 
in rodents and rabbits.
Indacaterol
Following subcutaneous administration in a rabbit study, adverse effects of indacaterol with respect to 
pregnancy and embryonal/foetal development could only be demonstrated at doses more than 
500-fold those achieved following daily inhalation of 150 mcg in humans (based on AUC0-24 h).
Although indacaterol did not affect general reproductive performance in a rat fertility study, a decrease 
in the number of pregnant F1 offspring was observed in the peri- and post-natal developmental rat 
study at an exposure 14-fold higher than in humans treated with indacaterol. Indacaterol was not 
embryotoxic or teratogenic in rats or rabbits.
Glycopyrronium
Glycopyrronium was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits following inhalation administration. 
Glycopyrronium and its metabolites did not significantly cross the placental barrier of pregnant mice, 
rabbits and dogs. Published data for glycopyrronium in animals do not indicate any reproductive 
toxicity issues. Fertility and pre- and post-natal development were not affected in rats.
Mometasone furoate
Like other glucocorticoids, mometasone furoate is a teratogen in rodents and rabbits. Effects noted 
were umbilical hernia in rats, cleft palate in mice and gallbladder agenesis, umbilical hernia and flexed 
front paws in rabbits. There were also reductions in maternal body weight gains, effects on foetal 
growth (lower foetal body weight and/or delayed ossification) in rats, rabbits and mice, and reduced 
offspring survival in mice. In studies of reproductive function, subcutaneous mometasone furoate at 
15 mcg/kg prolonged gestation and difficult labour occurred, with a reduction in offspring survival and 
body weight.

Toxicokinetic data and Local Tolerance 
Local tolerance was assessed via the intended clinical route of administration during the repeated-dose 
inhalation toxicity studies in rats and dogs for each monotherapy and the QVA149 and QMF149 
combinations  (indacaterol/mometasone)
Other toxicity studies
The applicant has submitted two reports summarising the in-silico assessment of potential 
mutagenicity of impurities in glycopyrronium and indacaterol (Study 1870450 and 1970134 
respectively) in line with ICH M7 guidance. For glycopyrronium one impurity was identified as having a 
mutagenic structural alert (5-Nitroisophthalic acid), this was defined as an ICH M7 class 3 impurity as 
no AMEs test was performed. This is controlled as an unspecified impurity in the drug substance at less 
than 0.1% and hence below the TTC. For indacaterol (maleate) Several class 2 and 3 impurities were 
identified and are controlled below the TTC. No information on the assessment of the mutagenic 
potential of mometasone furoate related impurities has been submitted. However, as the maximum 
daily dose of 160 µg means that with all impurities (other than the Ph. Eur. impurity J (NMT 0.15%)) 
controlled at NMT 0.10% any potential or actual mutagenic impurity would be present below an 
exposure level of 0.24 µg per day which would be below the TTC.
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
PEC calculations for all three components of the proposed FDC were below the action limit. The log 
Kow for indacaterol and glycopyrronium are below the action limit for PBT screening and adequate 
study reports detailing how these were calculated (based on the quotient of the solubility of the agents 
in both phases) submitted, this approach was previously accepted as part of previous assessments and 
therefore phase II assessment for these agents is not required. 
For mometasone, Log Kow was assessed in a GLP compliant OECD 107 study via the shake flask 
method. Log Kow was assessed over a range of pH values and found not to be dependent on pH. Log 
Kow was above the trigger value thus requiring the initiation of a full PBT assessment. To assess 
potential bioaccumulation the applicant conducted a fish (Lepomis macrochirus) bioaccumulation study 
in accordance to OECD 305 an in compliance with GLP. The bioaccumulation factors reported (see 
summary table below) are below the relevant trigger value and indicate that mometasone is not 
bioaccumulative or very bioaccumulative. 
Adsorption/desorption study was evaluated in an OECD 106 study. This included an assessment of Koc 
in five soils and one sludge. As the sludge Koc was below the relevant trigger value no terrestrial risk 
assessment is required. The applicant has also submitted a study assessing the biodegradability of 
mometasone in activated sludge in accordance with OECD 314B. As the sludge Koc was below the 
relevant trigger value no terrestrial risk assessment is required. The applicant has also submitted a 
study assessing the biodegradability of mometasone in activated sludge in accordance with OECD 
314B. In this study mometasone underwent primary biodegradation into two transformation products 
over the course of 28-days in activated sludge solution with a calculated t1/2 of 31 days. In contrast, 
in abiotic solution no significant degradation was noted. The applicant has also conducted an 
assessment of aerobic transformation in aquatic sediment systems in accordance with OECD 308.
The applicant has also conducted a phase IIa effect analysis including OECD 201, 209, 210 and 211 
studies. Phase II aquatic toxicity studies met validity criteria. PEC/PNEC for the most sensitive species

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
Pharmacology
An  abridged  non-clinical  data  package  has  been  submitted  in  support  of  this  Marketing  Authorisation 
Application. No new pharmacology studies have been conducted, this is considered acceptable and in 
line  with 
the 
EMAs 
guideline 
on 
the 
development 
of 
fixed 
dose 
combinations 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005).  A  basic  literature  review  of  the  pharmacology  of  the  individual 
components has been presented and is considered acceptable by the CHMP.
Pharmacokinetics
Method  validation  reports  have  been  submitted  for  the  methods  used  for  the  quantification  of 
mometasone  and  indacaterol  in  PK/Tox  studies.  In  general,  these  are  considered  acceptable  by  the 
CHMP.
The applicant has submitted TK data from the 13-week QMF149 mometasone furoate and indacaterol 
maleate combination toxicity studies conducted in rat and dog. Furthermore, comparative single dose 
study in rats and 4-week repeat dose inhalation study in dogs has been submitted to bridge the existing 
toxicological and clinical data available for the maleate salt of indacaterol to the acetate salt proposed 
for use in the current product. There are consistent differences in dose normalised exposures between 
the  two  salts  evident  in  the  single  dose  rat  study.  However,  the  applicant’s  justification  that  this  is 
unlikely to be clinically relevant is accepted. TK data from the QMF and QVA development programs do 
not indicate any significant PK DDI between MF/indacaterol and glycopyrronium/indacterol combinations 
respectively. 
Toxicology
No toxicity study assessing the triple combination has been submitted, this is considered acceptable due 
to  the  extensive  clinical  experience  with  the  administration  of  combinations  of  compounds  in  these 
classes. A summary of the known toxicology of the individual components is presented. 
Combination  toxicity  studies  on  glycopyronium/indacaterol  have  previously  been  performed  and 
assessed and reports for 13-week studies assessing indacaterol/mometasone combination toxicity are 
submitted  in  this  application.  These  studies  do  not  indicate  significant  synergistic  toxicity  with  target 
organs  identified  (lymphatic  system,  adrenals,  heart)  in  line  with  the  known  toxicity  of  the  individual 
agents.  Although  no  margins  of  exposure  from  NOAELs  identified  in  pre-clinical  studies  with  the 
combination  and  anticipated  clinical  exposures  have  been  provided,  given  the  extensive  clinical 
experience  with  similar  combinations  this  is  considered  acceptable  (NOAELS  were  not  defined  in 
MF/indacaterol  combination  toxicity  studies  due  to  MF  mediated  effects).  The  4-week  bridging  study 
comparing  the  relative  toxicity  of  acetate  and  maleate  salts  of  indacaterol  suggested  some  minor 
differences with the acetate salt treated animals exhibiting a mild increase in severity of cardiac toxicity 
relative to maleate treated groups. There are limitations in this study design that render a conclusive 
interpretation  of  the  data  presented  problematic,  it  is  not  clear  that  any  additional  discussion  of  the 
results of this study will provide any more clarity as to the clinical relevance of these data. Therefore, 
the clinical comparability exercise is of more relevance. 
Environmental risk assessment
The  applicant  has  submitted  an  ERA  in  line  with  the  EMAs  ‘guideline  on  the  environmental  risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use’ (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). This includes a 
full phase II and PBT assessment of the potential environmental risk of mometasone. A full assessment 
of  transformation  products  was  not  undertaken  in  the  submitted  OECD  308  study,  but  as  this  was 
performed according to guidance at the time, it can be considered acceptable. The endpoint chosen for 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020

the assessment of potential glucocorticoid induced toxicity is not considered the most sensitive and the 
applicant has committed to performing an OECD 234 fish study and submit post marketing to address 
this issue. This will be submitted by Q4 2020.
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
The results of the non-clinical data are appropriately described in the SmPC section 5.3. No non-clinical 
issues  are  identified  which  would  preclude  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  for  Enerzair 
Breezhaler.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics
The clinical PK program for QVM149 was based on the completed clinical programs conducted for the 
authorized individual components reported in previous registration dossiers (Onbrez Breezhaler SmPC, 
Asmanex Twisthaler SmPC, Seebri Breezhaler SmPC).
New information was based on the evaluation of PK interactions between indacaterol acetate, 
glycopyrronium, and MF administered as QVM149 [Study CQVM149B2102], the indacaterol salt 
bridging study [Study CQVM149B2203], the Japanese ethnic sensitivity study [Study CQVM149B1101], 
and population PK analyses based on Phase III studies for QVM149 and QMF149. 
Bioanalytical Methods
Pre-Study Bioanalytical Method Validation
The validations of the bioanalytical methods for the determination of indacaterol (QAB), 
glycopyrronium (NVA) and mometasome furoate (MF) were performed across multiple investigative 
sites using different bioanalytical methodologies. 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 44/142
The analytical methods for all analytes involved liquid chromatography (LC) combined with MS/MS 
detection and solid or liquid phase extraction. A linear, 1/concentration squared weighted, least-
squares regression algorithm was used to plot the peak area ratio of the analyte to its internal 
standard (IS) versus concentration. Linear responses in the analyte and IS ratios were observed in 
spiked calibration standards (CS) and quality control (QC) samples, respectively. Each bioanalytical 
method validation report provides data pertaining to specificity; lower limit of quantification (LLOQ); 
characterisation of potential matrix interference; calibration curve performance; intra- and inter-assay 
accuracy and precision; carry-over and analyte stability.
The specificity of each bioanalytical method was assessed by analysing six different batches of blank 
human plasma for interfering substances. Specificity was determined by the assessment of blank 
samples, with and without the inclusion of a suitable IS, prepared from control human plasma. No 
chromatographic interference from the blank samples (i.e. mean signal detection ≤5 and 20% of LLOQ 
for the IS and analyte, respectively) was observed at the retention times of QAB, NVA, MF or the 
internal standards, respectively. 
Back calculated CS were within ±20% of the nominal value at the LLOQ, and ±15% for all other 
concentration levels above the LLOQ, using a minimum of 6 non-zero concentration levels. Within- and 
between-run precision (%CV) was acceptable for the QC sample concentrations presented (i.e. %CV 
for low, medium and high QC samples <15%, respectively). The intra- and inter-assay accuracy for 
each method based on low, medium and high QC samples were within ±15% of the nominal values 
assessed.
Within-In Study Validation
During the analysis of participant samples, spiked CS and QC standards were extracted to permit the 
determination of the concentration of QAB, NVA and MF, in addition to the assessment of intra- and 
inter-run accuracy and precision. Each analytical run included QC, blank and zero samples, 
respectively. Method reproducibility was assessed via incurred sample reanalysis. Participant samples 
for pivotal trials CQVM149B2301 and CQVM149B2302 were analysed across separate investigative 
sites using different bioanalytical methods. Cross-method validation studies were conducted to 
investigate concordance between analytical techniques and investigative sites for the detection of each 
analyte using back-up incurred samples. 
Population PK analyses
The popPK analyses focused on PK data from asthma patients enrolled in the two phase III studies 
[CQVM149B2301 and CQVM149B2302] for whom PK data were retained in the analysis. The phase III 
study [Study CQVM149B2303] and the phase II study [Study CQMF149E2201] provided 
supplementary data. 
Separate population PK models were developed for indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone 
furoate (MF). For MF, where depending on the formulation, a different nominal dose is required to 
deliver the same lung dose, a multiplicative factor on bioavailability was introduced to correct for this.
Indacaterol
The final popPK model for indacaterol was a two-compartment disposition model with a short zero-
order absorption of a fraction of the drug followed by a rapid first-order absorption of the rest of the 
drug and first-order elimination. To account for differences in Cmax concentrations between study 
CQVM149B2301 and CQVM149B2302, a study effect was estimated on Vc/F. Based on simulations, no 
difference in the PK of indacaterol was identified with different formulations. Covariates included in the 
final model were body weight on CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F and Vp/F, and grouped race (Caucasian/White, 
Japanese, Other) on Vc/F. The effects of these covariates on indacaterol PK following inhalation of

QMF149 or QVM149 in patients with asthma were small in magnitude and not clinically relevant. Age, 
sex, smoking status, baseline eGFR and FEV1 at baseline were not statistically significant covariates.
Glycopyrronium
The final popPK model for glycopyrronium was a two-compartment model with bolus administration 
and first-order elimination. No study effects were included in the final model for glycopyrronium. Based 
on simulations, no difference in the PK of glycopyrronium was identified with different formulations. 
Covariates included in the final model were body weight on CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F and Vp/F with fixed, 
default allometric scaling factors, and an effect of grouped race (Caucasian/White, Japanese, Other) on 
Vc/F. The applicant considered that the effects of these covariates on glycopyrronium PK were small in 
magnitude and not clinically relevant. Age, sex, smoking status, baseline eGFR and FEV1 at baseline 
were not statistically significant covariates. 
Mometasone furoate
The final popPK model for MF was a linear two-compartment disposition model with mixed zero/first 
order absorption and first-order elimination. The mixed zero-order/first-order absorption process 
describes an initial very rapid absorption of a fraction of the drug overlaid by slower first-order 
absorption. Formulation effects were introduced on relative bioavailability, central volume and 
peripheral volume, and a study effect on central volume. Covariates included in the final model were 
body weight on CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F and Vp/F, and baseline FEV1 on CL/F and Vc/F. The effects of these 
covariates on MF PK following inhalation of QMF149 or QVM149 in patients with asthma were small in 
magnitude and not clinically relevant. Age, sex, Japanese ethnicity, smoking status and baseline eGFR 
were not statistically significant covariates.

Indacaterol salt bridging
Study CQVM149B2203 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period cross-over 
study to assess the pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of two orally inhaled 
indacaterol salts (maleate and acetate) delivered via the Concept1 inhalation device in patients with 
asthma.
On Day 14, upon comparison of indacaterol acetate with indacaterol maleate when including body 
weight as covariate, the geometric mean ratio for AUC0-24h,ss was 0.897 (90% CI: 0.854, 0.942) and 
for Cmax,ss was 0.891 (90% CI: 0.847, 0.939). Thus, both AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax fell within the 
bioequivalence limits (90% CI: 0.80-1.25) indicating comparable exposure from both salts (Table 11-
10). The inclusion/exclusion of bodyweight as a covariate had no impact on the conclusion of the 
study.

Table 5 Geometric mean ratio (test/reference) and 90% confidence intervals for indacaterol 
PK parameters on Day 14 when including body weight as covariate (PK analysis set)
Study CQAB149D2301 was a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-
dose, 4-way cross-over study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 
orally inhaled indacaterol salts (maleate, xinafoate and acetate) in patients with persistent asthma.
The results showed that indacaterol exposure (AUC0-24h and Cmax) was similar for the three different 
indacaterol salts. Indacaterol was rapidly absorbed following inhalation administration and peak plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) were achieved in less than 0.5 hours post-inhalation for all three salts. Linear 
and semi-logarithmic graphical displays of the arithmetic mean concentration over time curves per 
treatment demonstrate the similarity of the mean concentration time profiles for the three indacaterol 
salts. The results of the statistical analysis of PK parameters AUC0-24h and Cmax on day 7, are shown 
in Table 7. The AUC0-24h treatment ratios acetate to maleate and xinafoate to maleate were close to 
one and the 90% confidence intervals contained one. The same applies to the Cmax ratio acetate to 
maleate. The Cmax ratio xinafoate to maleate was 0.885 with a confidence interval of 0.802 to 0.976.

 Mometasone device bridging
MF Twisthaler and MF Concept1 are different with regards to both the inhalation device and the 
formulations they deliver. Therefore, a 3-step bridging approach was used to identify doses of MF in 
the Concept1 device that were comparable to the corresponding doses of MF in the Twisthaler device. 
Step 1: In a single dose PK study [CQMF149E2101], the estimated average dose of MF in the Concept1 
device expected to provide systemic exposures comparable to the MF dose of 400 μg delivered via the 
Twisthaler device was 195 μg (medium dose ICS). Since the absolute oral bioavailability of MF is low, 
systemic exposure was considered to be an appropriate surrogate for pulmonary exposure to MF, as a 
starting point for the bridging approach.
Step 2: Due to a drug substance coating effect following the first delivered dose from the Concept1 
device, a slightly increased delivered dose and fine particle mass was observed for the second and 
subsequent doses. The relative difference in FPM for MF 50 μg between the first and second dose was 
0.8 μg, i.e. a relative increase in FPM of 8% following the initial capsule actuation. 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 47/142
Since in Study CQMF149E2101 each capsule was delivered using a fresh Concept1 device, the first 
dose effect resulting in an increase of FPM on the second dose was incorporated in the in vitro dose 
adjustment. Following in vitro dose adjustment for the first dose effect, the dose of MF in Concept1 
determined to be comparable to the MF Twisthaler 2x200 μg dose was adjusted from 195 to 160 μg.
The doses selected for development were based on the linear relationship between the MF AUClast and 
in vitro FPM corresponding to the doses of MF Concept1 device used in Study CQMF149E2101. Applying 
this approach, the 400 μg medium dose of MF from the Twisthaler was defined as 160 μg from 
Concept1 device. By taking half and double of this defined dose, the doses of MF 80 μg and 320 μg in 
the Concept1 device were selected, as corresponding to MF 200 μg and 800 μg in the Twisthaler 
device.
Step 3: A clinical bridging study [Study CQMF149E2201] in patients with asthma confirmed that the MF 
doses of 80 μg and 320 μg delivered via the Concept1 device were comparable to MF doses of 200 μg 
and 800 μg delivered via the Twisthaler device, respectively, in terms of PD effects and systemic 
exposure.
Study CQMF149E2101 was an open-label, single-dose, two-part study to compare systemic exposure 
to mometasone furoate when delivered by oral inhalation via the Concept1 and Twisthaler® devices 
and to determine the effect of activated charcoal on the absorption of mometasone furoate delivered 
via the Concept1 device in healthy subjects.
Part 1 - MF was absorbed following oral inhalation with maximum concentrations occurring within 3 
hours in all subjects following oral inhalation via both Twisthaler® and Concept1 devices. Median Tmax 
occurred earlier with all doses following inhalation via Concept1 (0.375 to 2 hours) compared to 
inhalation via Twisthaler® (3 hours). The terminal half-life of MF was similar following all treatments 
(approximately 12-13 hours). Variability of MF PK parameters was lower following administration via 
Concept1 compared to Twisthaler® with CVs for Cmax and AUC parameters ranging from 20.5% to 
26.7% (Concept1) compared to 47.3% to 49.8% (Twisthaler®). Summary statistics of primary PK 
parameters following single orally inhaled MF via Twisthaler or Concept1 are provided in Table 8.
Table 7 Summary of PK parameters of primary interest of MF following single orally inhaled 
MF via Twisthaler or Concept1 (Part 1)
Based on primary statistical analysis, the estimated average dose of MF in Concept1 expected to 
provide systemic exposure comparable to Twisthaler® 400 μg was 195 μg [90% CI: (175 μg, 215 μg), 
CV% 9.03%] based on AUClast. 
Part 2 - Measurable concentrations of MF were noted following both treatments (i.e. administration of 
MF with or without activated charcoal), allowing for complete characterization of the PK profile and 
estimation of relevant PK parameters. Absorption of MF was slow and variable following oral dosing 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 48/142
without activated charcoal, with peak concentrations being achieved between 2 and 24 hours after 
dosing. Tmax was generally earlier when MF was administered with activated charcoal (1 to 6 hours). 
Terminal half-life was similar with and without activated charcoal (19-22 hours). Activated charcoal 
reduced the systemic exposure (AUClast) of MF in all subjects. Similar results were also noted for 
AUCinf and AUC0-24h. Oral absorption of MF was suppressed by 74% in the presence of activated 
charcoal (based on AUClast). However, at least 85% suppression was required in the protocol for 
validation of the charcoal-block method and, hence, Treatments H and I (MF via Concept1 with and 
without activated charcoal) were not administered.
Study CQMF149E2201 was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 4-week treatment, parallel-
group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of mometasone furoate delivered via 
Concept1 or Twisthaler® in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma.
Mean plasma MF concentrations rose rapidly after inhalation dosing via both devices, and reached a 
peak at ~1 hour post-dose. Mean MF systemic exposure (AUClast, AUC0-23h35min and Cmax) on Day 
1 and Day 28 was slightly lower for the MF Concept1 doses (80μg or 320 μg) vs. corresponding MF TH 
doses (200 μg or 800 μg), respectively. Slightly less than proportional increase in exposure (AUClast 
and Cmax) was observed for the high dose groups vs. the low dose groups for both devices on Day 1 
and Day 28 (Table 9).

Component interaction within the QMF149 FDC
Study CQMF149E2102 was a randomized, open-labeled, four-period complete crossover, 
confirmatory study in healthy volunteers to evaluate the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction 
following multiple inhaled doses of indacaterol acetate and mometasone furoate delivered in free or in 
fixed combination (QMF149) via the Concept1 device in healthy subjects. 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 49/142
Mean indacaterol concentrations rose rapidly after oral inhalation via Concept1 and reached a peak at 
0.25 hour post-dose. The profiles of the indacaterol acetate 150 μg (mono), free combination and FDC 
QMF149 150/320 μg treatments appeared to be similar. Mean exposure PK parameters AUC0-24h,ss 
and Cmax,ss were similar for the indacaterol alone (monotherapy) and the free combination but 
slightly higher for QMF149. The mean relative bioavailability ratios were slightly higher for the FDC vs. 
mono comparison (Table 2-13). 
Mean MF concentrations rose after inhalation dosing and reached a peak at ~1 hour post-dose. 
Following administration of the free combination or the FDC QMF149, the concentrations of MF were 
slightly higher than the concentrations observed following administration of MF alone. Mean exposure 
PK parameters AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss were slightly higher for the free combination and QMF149 as 
compared to the MF alone treatment. The mean relative bioavailability ratios were slightly higher for 
the free combination vs. mono comparison (Table 10). 
The 90% confidence intervals for all comparisons were within the bioequivalence limits of 0.80-1.25, 
except for MF Cmax,ss (FDC vs. mono comparison), where the 90% confidence interval was [1.13-
1.26] (Table 10).


Component interaction within the QVM149 FDC
Study CQVM149B2102 was an open-label, randomized, four-period (each of 14 days duration), four-
sequence crossover study to compare the steady state systemic exposure of multiple inhaled doses of 
indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate when administered alone, or in 
fixed combination QVM149 as a lactose blend formulation via the Concept1 device in 36 healthy 
subjects.
The adjusted geometric mean AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss for indacaterol were approximately 7.8% 
lower and 2% higher, respectively, when administered as the QVM149 FDC versus indacaterol 
monotherapy. The adjusted geometric mean AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss for glycopyrronium were 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 50/142
approximately 1.4% lower and 21% higher, respectively, when administered as the QVM149 FDC 
versus glycopyrronium monotherapy. The adjusted geometric mean AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss for MF 
were approximately 16% and 17% higher, respectively, when administered as the QVM149 FDC versus 
MF monotherapy.
Comparing the relative bioavailability for indacaterol and MF following administration of QVM149 FDC 
versus their respective monotherapy revealed that the geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence 
intervals for AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss both fell within the bioequivalence limits of 0.80–1.25. For 
glycopyrronium, the geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals for AUC0-24h,ss fell within 
the bioequivalence limits of 0.80–1.25 while for Cmax,ss the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval 
of 1.34 marginally fell outside of the bioequivalence limits of 0.80-1.25 (Table 11). However, the 
marginally higher exposure is not considered clinically relevant with respect to the established systemic 
safety profile of glycopyrronium. Once daily inhaled doses up to 200 μg o.d. for glycopyrronium were 
safe and well tolerated in prior studies.
Table 10 Study CQVM149B2102: Summary of the relative bioavailability analysis of fixed 
dose combination (QVM149) versus monotherapy
In conclusion, there was no clinically relevant PK interaction between indacaterol acetate, 
glycopyrronium bromide, and MF when administered together as the QVM149 FDC. The data from this 
study support development of QVM149 without dose adjustment for indacaterol (150 μg) or 
glycopyrronium (50 μg) and the use of an MF Concept1 dose of 160 μg as part of the highest planned 
QVM149 dose of 150/50/160 μg.
Distribution and Elimination
The blood distribution and plasma protein binding of the individual components of QVM149 have been 
previously investigated as part of the monotherapy programs. The distribution and plasma protein 
binding properties were not expected to be different for the FDC product. Therefore, no additional in 
vitro studies have been performed with the combination drug QVM149.
Similarly, no additional in vitro and in vivo excretion/metabolism studies have been conducted with 
QVM149. The elimination of each component is not expected to be different for the FDC compared to 
monotherapy.

Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism
Systemic exposure to indacaterol is not significantly affected by the low activity UGT1A1 genotypic 
variation (Gilbert’s syndrome genotype) (Onbrez Breezhaler SmPC). No data were provided for 
glycopyrronium or mometasone.

Dose proportionality
Healthy subjects
In Study CQMF149E2101, systemic exposure (AUClast) of MF increased in a dose proportional 
manner over the dose range of 50 to 400 μg following oral inhalation via Concept1. Similar results 
were also noted for AUCinf and AUC0-24h. Cmax for MF also increased in an approximately dose 
proportional manner; however, the confidence interval for the slope estimate did not include 1 and 
therefore the increase in Cmax was not statistically dose proportional (Table 12). 
Table 11 Primary statistical analysis of dose proportionality (Part 1)
In Study CQM149B1101, after oral inhalation of QVM149 150/50/80 μg and QVM149 150/50/160 μg 
via Concept1, a 2-fold increase in dose of MF from 80 μg to 160 μg led to an approximately 2-fold 
increase in MF systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24h) in both Japanese and Caucasian healthy male 
subjects (Table 13).

μg) vs low dose (80 μg) on Day 1 and Day 14 (PK analysis set)
Patients with asthma
Dose proportionality information for MF after QVM149 administration in patients with asthma is based 
on pooled population PK analysis [QVM149B-PopPK-Report] of studies CQVM149B2301 and 
CQVM149B2302 in patients with asthma. Data for QVM149 are based on Study CQVM149B2302 which 
included the QVM149 150/50/80 µg o.d. and QVM149 150/50/160 µg o.d. treatments.

Simulated mean AUC0-24h,ss was 1.7-fold higher following administration of high dose 
QVM149 150/50/160 µg (1593 pg×h/mL) compared to medium dose QVM149 150/50/80 µg 
(957 pg×h/mL).

Time dependency
The trough plasma concentrations of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and MF were stable from Day 12 to 
Day 14 when administered as QVM149 FDC or as monotherapy indicating that PK steady state was 
reached by Day 12.
The indacaterol accumulation ratios (Racc) after once-daily dosing of QVM149 FDC for 14 days were 
3.09-3.32 for AUC0-24h and 1.57-1.76 for Cmax in healthy subjects (Study CQVM149B1101).
The glycopyrronium accumulation ratios (Racc) after once-daily dosing of QVM149 FDC for 14 days 
were 2.74-2.86 for AUC0-24h and 1.68-1.90 for Cmax in healthy subjects (Study CQVM149B1101).
The MF accumulation ratios (Racc) after once-daily dosing of QVM149 FDC for 14 days were 1.33-1.50 
for AUC0-24h and 1.28-1.38 for Cmax in healthy subjects (Study CQVM149B1101).
Inter- and intra-individual variability
The inter- and intra-individual variability in Cmax (steady-state) and AUC0-24h (steady-state) for 
QVM149 components in healthby subjects is presented in Table 14.
Table 13 Inter- and intra-subject variability (CV of geometric mean) and intraclass 
correlation coefficient of AUCO-24h and Cmax at steady state for QVM149 components 
In the popPK model for indacaterol, between subject variability on the PK parameters CL/F and Vc/F 
was 0.43 and 0.40 (base model) and from 0.48 and 0.38 (final model), respectively.
In the popPK model for glycopyrronium, between subject variability on the PK parameters CL/F and 
Vc/F was 0.39 and 0.56 (base model) and 0.39 and 0.53 (final model), respectively.
In the popPK model for mometasone, between subject variability on the PK parameters CL/F and Vc/F 
was 0.49 and 0.42 (base model) and 0.49 and 0.39 (final model), respectively.
Pharmacokinetics in the target population
Study CQVM149B2301 was a multi-center, randomized, 52 week treatment, double blind, triple-
dummy, parallel-group study to assess the efficacy and safety of QMF149 compared with mometasone 
furoate in patients with asthma. Approximately 12.8% of patients were included in the PK 
subpopulation for exploratory PK analysis. A total of 284 patients participated in the PK sub-study. 
Similar indacaterol PK profiles between QMF149 150/160 µg and QMF149 150/320 µg were observed. 
The MF PK profiles, however, showed some differences depending on how MF was administered – as 
mono-component via Twisthaler device vs. as FDC via Concept1 device at a high dose or at a medium 
dose.
Study CQVM149B2302 was a multicenter, randomized, 52-week, double-blind, parallel group, active 
controlled study to compare the efficacy and safety of QVM149 with QMF149 in patients with asthma. 
Approximately 8.7% of patients were included in the PK subpopulation for exploratory PK analysis. A

total of 270 patients participated in the PK sub-study. Similar indacaterol PK profiles between QMF149 
150/160 µg, QMF149 150/320 µg, QVM149 150/50/160 µg, and QVM149 150/50/80 µg were 
observed. The glycopyrronium PK profiles were similar QVM149 150/50/80 µg, and QVM149 
150/50/160 µg. The MF PK profiles were similar between QMF149 150/160 µg and QVM149 
150/50/80 µg, and between QMF149 150/320 µg and QVM149 150/50/160 µg.
Study CQVM149B2303 was a multi-center, randomized, 12-week treatment, double blind study to 
assess the efficacy and safety of QMF149 (150/80 μg) compared with mometasone furoate (MF) 
Twisthaler® (200μg) in adult and adolescent patients with asthma. Approximately 12.1% of patients 
were included in the PK subpopulation for exploratory PK analysis. A total of 97 patients participated in 
the PK sub-study; 50 patients received QMF149 and 47 subjects received MF. 
The mean (SD) plasma indacaterol concentrations at pre-dose and 15 min post-dose, at steady state 
on Day 84, were 85 (27) pg/mL and 304 (109) pg/mL, respectively. Similar concentrations were noted 
on Day 30. These concentrations were consistent with prior data reported for indacaterol maleate 150 
μg administered via the Concept1 device in COPD patients (Demin et al 2016). The mean (SD) plasma 
MF concentrations at pre-dose, at steady state on Day 84, were comparable between the QMF149 
150/80 μg o.d. (7.2 (7.44) pg/mL) and MF Twisthaler 200 μg o.d. (19.6 (39.28) pg/mL) treatment 
groups, considering the overall variability. Similar observations were noted at the 15 min and 1 hour 
post-dose time points. Steady state plasma MF concentrations were also comparable between the 
QMF149 and MF Twisthaler treatment at the corresponding time-points on Day 30. Summary statistics 
of PK parameters for indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone across the three phase III studies 
are provided in Table 15, Table 16 and Table 17, respectively.

Study QMF149E2203 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week 
treatment, parallel-group study to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of indacaterol 
acetate (75 and 150 µg o.d.) in patients with persistent asthma.
Mean plasma indacaterol concentrations rose rapidly after inhalation at both dose levels and reached a 
peak between 0.250 to 0.309 hours post-dose (median Tmax). Approximately dose dependent 
increase in exposure (AUC0-23h35min, AUClast and Cmax) was observed for the indacaterol acetate 
150 μg dose group vs. the indacaterol acetate 75 μg dose group on Day 1 and Day 14. Summary 
statistics of PK parameters AUClast, AUC0-23h35min, Cmax and Tmax for all patients in the 24 h PK 
subgroup are presented in Table 18.

For the arithmetic mean (SD) indacaterol trough concentrations (pre-dose or 23h 35 min postdose) for 
the sparse PK samples collected on various occasions throughout the study, indacaterol trough 
concentrations were approximately similar between Day 14 and Day 84 and were approximately 2-fold 
higher for the indacaterol acetate 150 μg dose group vs. the indacaterol acetate 75 μg dose group.

Special populations

Impaired renal function
Systemic exposure of indacaterol, glycopyrronium, and MF following QVM149 administration has not 
been characterized in subjects with renal impairment. Systemic exposure between the FDC and 
monotherapy products was comparable based on the results of the PK component interaction study 
[Study CQVM149B2102] and PK data from Phase III studies [QVM149B-PopPK-Report]. In the popPk 
analyses, eGFR normalised to body surface area, was not found to be a statistically significant 
covariate for indacaterol, glycopyrronium or MF PK. Based on these data, dosing recommendations for 
patients with renal impairment can be extrapolated from the monotherapy products to QVM149.No 
dose adjustment is required based on the information for the mono-components. 

Impaired hepatic function
Systemic exposure of indacaterol, glycopyrronium, and MF following QVM149 administration has not 
been characterized in subjects with hepatic impairment. Systemic exposure between the FDC and 
monotherapy products was comparable based on the results of the PK component interaction study 
[Study CQVM149B2102] and PK data from Phase III studies [QVM149B-PopPK-Report]. Based on these 
data, dosing recommendations for patients with hepatic impairment can be extrapolated from the 
monotherapy products to QVM149. No dose adjustment is required based on the information for the 
mono-components. 
 Gender
In the popPk analyses, gender was not found to be a statistically significant covariate for indacaterol, 
glycopyrronium or MF PK.

QMF149 via Concept1.
Table 11-4 presents geometric mean ratios (Japanese/Caucasian) and 90% confidence intervals for 
Cmax and AUC0-24h of indacaterol by treatment. Following multiple doses of QMF149, the geometric

150/80 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg treatment groups were 1.23 (1.11-1.38) and 1.19 (1.07-1.33), 
respectively. Those for AUC0- 24h on Day 14 in QMF149 150/80 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg 
treatment groups were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) and 1.19 (1.06-1.33), respectively. Based on the results of 
exploratory statistical analysis including age and body weight as covariates, the geometric mean ratios 
(90% CIs) of Japanese to Caucasian for Cmax on Day 14 in QMF149 150/80 μg and QMF149 
150/320 μg treatment groups were 1.13 (1.00-1.28) and 1.09 (0.96-1.24), respectively. Those for 
AUC0-24h on Day 14 in QMF149 150/80 μg and QMF149 150/320 μg groups were 1.13 (1.00-1.28) 
and 1.10 (0.97-1.25), respectively. As mean body weight was approximately 14% higher for Caucasian 
vs. Japanese subjects, this was considered to be one of the factors that contributed to the slightly 
higher exposure in Japanese subjects.

Study CQVM149B1101 was a non-confirmatory, single centre, open-label, randomised, two 
treatment cross-over study to assess the pharmacokinetics of indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium 
bromide and mometasone furoate (MF) in 33 healthy male subjects (16 Japanese and 17 Caucasian 
subjects) following multiple inhaled doses of QVM149 via the Concept 1 device. Each Caucasian subject 
was matched with a Japanese subject by age (± 10 years) and weight (± 20% kg). PK samples were 
collected up to 24 h after dosing.
In both Japanese and Caucasian subjects, indacaterol, glycopyrronium, and MF were systemically 
available shortly after inhaling single and multiple doses of QVM149 150/50/80 μg and QVM149 
150/50/160 μg. Median Tmax was 0.25 h for indacaterol, 0.0833 h for glycopyrronium, and 1 to 2 h 
for MF on Days 1 and 14.
After a single dose of QVM149 150/50/80 μg and QVM149 150/50/160 μg, Japanese subjects showed 
higher exposures than Caucasian subjects to all analytes. On Day 14, values of Cmax,ss for 
indacaterol, glycopyrronium, and MF in Japanese subjects were elevated by 30%, 54%, and 15%, 
respectively, compared to Caucasian subjects. A similar trend was noted for AUC0-24h,ss, but the 
differences were smaller (Table 20).

(Japanese vs Caucasian) on Day 1 and Day 14
Population PK analyses
Based on simulations using the final popPK model for indacaterol, AUC0-24h was the same between 
races. Simulated Cmax values varied with race. Japanese patients had a 20% higher mean Cmax than 
Caucasian patients; patients of other ethnicities and races had a 5% higher mean Cmax than 
Caucasian patients.
Based on simulations using the final popPK model for glycopyrronium, AUC0-24h was the same 
between races. Simulated Cmax values varied with race. Japanese patients had a 60% higher mean 
Cmax than Caucasian patients; patients of other ethnicities and races had a 5% higher mean Cmax 
than Caucasian patients. Ctrough was reduced by 8% for Japanese patients relative to Caucasian 
patients.
Race was not found to be a statistically significant covariate on MF PK.

Body weight
Based on simulations using the final popPK model for indacaterol, AUC0-24h varied with body weight. 
Compared to population mean AUC0-24h in patients with 75 kg body weight in study CQVM149B2301, 
the AUC0-24h in 35 kg and in 115 kg patients was 25% higher and 12% lower, respectively. Simulated 
Cmax values varied with body weight. Compared to population mean Cmax in patients with 75 kg body 
weight in study CQVM149B2301, the Cmax in 35 kg and in 115 kg patients was 32% higher and 14% 
lower, respectively.
Based on simulations using the final popPK model for glycopyrronium, AUC0-24h varied with body 
weight. Compared to population mean AUC0-24h in patients with 75 kg body weight in study 
CQVM149B2301, the AUC0-24h in 35 kg and in 115 kg patients was 77% higher and 27% lower, 
respectively. Simulated Cmax values varied with body weight. Compared to population mean Cmax in 
patients with 75 kg body weight in study CQVM149B2301, the Cmax in 35 kg and in 115 kg patients 
was 103% higher and 33% lower, respectively.
Based on simulations using the final popPK model for MF, AUC0-24h varied with body weight. 
Compared to population mean AUC0-24h in patients with 75 kg body weight, the AUC0-24h in 35 kg 
and in 115 kg patients was 31% higher and 14% lower, respectively. Simulated Cmax values varied 
with body weight. Compared to population mean Cmax in patients with 75 kg body weight, the mean 
Cmax in 35 kg and in 115 kg patients was 29% higher and 14% lower, respectively.

Elderly
The target patient population for asthma includes elderly patients. In the popPK analyses, age was not 
found to be a statistically significant covariate for indacaterol, glycopyrronium or MF PK.

Children
QVM149 has not been evaluated in patients below 18 years of age. QVM149 is indicated for the 
treatment of asthma in adult patients.

Interactions
No new data on in vitro or in vivo drug interactions of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone 
furoate were provided. 
In vitro studies for individual components of QVM149 demonstrated that indacaterol, glycopyrronium, 
and MF are unlikely to alter the clearance of drugs that are mainly eliminated through metabolism by 
the major cytochrome P450 enzymes and/or of drugs whose absorption or disposition is affected by 
clinically relevant drug transporters. All mRNA, as well as activity data in primary human hepatocytes, 
suggest that there would be no clinically relevant induction of any metabolic and active transport 
process by indacaterol or glycopyrronium at therapeutic concentrations. Except for strong inhibitors of 
active renal cation transport processes, which may reduce glycopyrronium clearance, CYP3A4 inhibitors 
that may modulate indacaterol or mometasone furoate metabolism, or P-gp inhibitors which may affect 
indacaterol disposition, co-medications are unlikely to alter the PK of QVM149 components.
The potential for systemic PK interaction between indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide, and 
MF is low, based on in vitro data and clinical drug interaction studies conducted for the indacaterol 
maleate (Onbrez Breezhaler SmPC), glycopyrronium bromide (Seebri Breezhaler SmPC) and MF 
(Asmanex Twisthaler SmPC) monotherapy development programs.
In the development programs for the dual combinations, there was no PK interaction following 
concomitant administration of indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium (Ultibro Breezhaler SmPC) or 
following concomitant administration of indacaterol acetate and MF via the Concept1 device. The 
potential for a PK component interaction between glycopyrronium and MF is also considered low as 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 60/142
glycopyrronium and MF are predominantly metabolized by different CYP enzymes (glycopyrronium is 
predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and MF is metabolized by CYP3A4), and both are not known to 
be an inhibitor or an inducer of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4.
Thus, the clearance mechanisms of indacaterol, glycopyrronium, and MF are not anticipated to 
interfere with each other and the compounds are unlikely to act as inhibitors and/or inducers. 
Consequently, no drug-drug interactions between the individual components of QVM149 are 
anticipated.
In Study CQVM149B2102 (detailed above) the steady-state systemic exposure (AUC0-24h,ss; 
Cmax,ss) to indacaterol, glycopyrronium, and MF was similar after once-daily administration of FDC as 
QVM149 150/50/160 µg as compared to the once daily administration of indacaterol acetate 150 µg, 
glycopyrronium bromide 50 µg and MF 190 µg when administered alone, respectively.
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics
The PD profile of QVM149 was characterised in studies CQVM149B2302, CQVM149B2208, and 
CQVM149B2209. These studies are detailed in Clinical Efficacy.
The pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of QVM149 reflect the complementary mechanisms of action of the 
individual components of QVM149; the bronchodilatory action achieved with the LABA indacaterol and 
the LAMA glycopyrronium, and the anti-inflammatory effects of the ICS mometasone furoate (MF), an 
established controller medication in asthma. The bronchodilators in QVM149 target different receptors 
and pathways. When administered together, more comprehensive bronchodilation is seen with co-
administration of LABA plus LAMA in asthma (Kerstjens et al 2012). 
The PD response profile of QVM149 is summarised below.


Fast onset of action: clinically relevant bronchodilation from 5 min post-dose on Day 1 (Study 
CQVM149B22302) 
Sustained bronchodilation in 24-h FEV1 profile: 24 h post-dose trough FEV1 improvements 
were demonstrated when compared to salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d [Study 
CQVM149B2208], [Study CQVM149B2302] and QMF149 (FDC of indacaterol/MF at 
corresponding ICS doses [Study CQVM149B2302]. 

Increased FEV1 vs standard of care: Statistically significant increase in mean peak FEV1 
(highest bronchodilator (FEV1) effect during the period of 5 min to 4 hours after the last 
evening dose of each treatment period) following QVM149 high and medium dose of 0.172 L 
and 0.159 L compared to salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg b.i.d., respectively [Study 
CQVM149B2208].

Trend of dose-ordering for QVM149 at medium (150/50/80 µg o.d.) and high ICS 
(150/50/160 µg o.d.) doses as assessed by rescue medication use, lung function benefit and 
reduction of asthma exacerbation risk [Study CQVM149B2208, Study CQVM149B2302].

Flexible dosing schedule: QVM149 can be dosed irrespective of the time of day as it shows 
similar lung function benefit when dosed in the morning or in the evening [Study 
CQVM149B2209]. 

No evidence for tachyphylaxis to the effect of QVM149 over time (up to 52 weeks) when 
compared to its monotherapy components [Study CQVM149B2302]. 
No studies of the secondary PD effects of QVM149 or any of its constituents were conducted because of 
the available data for each compound, as well as the data allowing the bridging between QVM149 and

approved monotherapies for indacaterol, glycopyrronium, and MF. However, a previous TQT study of 
QVA149 was included in the current application (Study CQVA149A2109).
Study CQVA149A2109 was a randomized, partially-blinded, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) 
controlled 3-period cross-over study to evaluate the effects of supratherapeutic dose of QVA149 on 
(440 μg indacaterol/400 μg glycopyrronium) on the placebo- and baseline-corrected QTcF (ΔΔQTcF) 
interval in 84 healthy male and female volunteers. The main results are summarized below.


The estimated mean maximal ddQTcF of 9.18 ms was observed at 30 minutes post-dose. The 
respective upper bound of the two-sided 90% CI was 10.46 ms. At all other time-points the 
upper confidence limit was below 10 ms.
In the context of a transient increase in heart rate with a mean maximal change from baseline 
vs. placebo of 5.03 bpm at 15 min post dose following QVA149 inhalation, additional beat-to-
beat (and QTcI) analysis of the QT interval in line with protocol specifications was performed. 
The mean maximal change from baseline was >5 ms from 15 minutes to 1 h after dosing but 
the upper bound of the two sided 90% confidence interval never exceeded 10 ms at any time-
point. Additionally, the examination of the % of outlier beats exceeding the 97.5% reference 
bounds for QT intervals over an entire 24 hour baseline showed only a mean maximal increase 
from pre-dose baseline of 3.8% of beats following QVA149 compared to 23.4% with 
moxifloxacin.

Assay sensitivity was established by showing that all four Bonferroni corrected one-sided p-
values for the comparison of moxifloxacin to placebo for change from baseline in QTcF at the 
protocol-specified time-points 1, 2, 3, and 4 h post dose were less than 0.0125. The lower 
bounds of the two-sided 90% CI for comparison of moxifloxacin to placebo for change from 
baseline in QTcF were >5 ms at all pre-specified time-points (1, 2, 3 and 4 h post-dose).
 QVA149 did not have any relevant effect on the PR interval and QRS duration. Similarly there 
was no relevant effect on ECG morphology following QVA149.

Small effects on QT-intervals were associated with high drug concentrations of indacaterol and 
glycopyrronium as shown by linear regression analysis of the concentration-QT relationship. 
The effect is likely mediated by the beta-2 agonist class-effects of indacaterol. However, since 
QVA149 is a fixed-dose combination of both indacaterol and glycopyrronium and the 
concentration peaks of both drugs were observed at similar time-points, intrinsic effects of 
either component cannot be distinguished.

No relevant exposure-response relationship was observed between the exposure to either 
indacaterol or glycopyrronium and the changes in uncorrected QT. Similarly, no relevant 
exposure-response relationship was observed between the exposure to either indacaterol or 
glycopyrronium and the HR changes. 
No interaction studies have been conducted with QVM149. The proposed SmPC (Section 4.5) provides 
information regarding the potential interactions, based on approved products containing one or more of 
these components, as follows:



Co-administration of QVM149 with other anticholinergic and/or long-acting β2-adrenergic 
agonist containing medicinal products has not been studied and is not recommended as it may 
potentiate known inhaled muscarinic antagonist or β2-adrenergic agonist adverse reactions.
Possible hypokalaemia may be potentiated by concomitant medications, including non-
potassium sparing diuretics.
β-adrenergic blockers (including eye drops) can weaken or inhibit the effect of indacaterol. 
Concurrent use of β-adrenergic blockers should be avoided unless there are compelling reasons 
for their use. If β-adrenergic blockers are required, cardio-selective β-adrenergic blockers are 
preferred.

 QVM149 should be administered with caution to patients being treated with medicinal products 
known to prolong the QTc interval.
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Pharmacokinetics
Bioanalytical Methods 
Pre-Study Bioanalytical Method Validation
Each pre-study bioanalytical method validation report provided sufficient data to confirm calibration 
curve performance, specificity and the absence of significant carry-over between sample injections. 
The data presented for the QC samples used to determine accuracy and precision were acceptable (i.e. 
±15% of nominal concentration). While some of the QC samples used during validation did not 
sufficiently cover the entire calibration range, data from within-study validation provided sufficient 
evidence for accuracy and precision of methods across the curve. 
Within Study Validation 
The within-study validation data demonstrates acceptable accuracy and precision for the QC samples 
across the calibration curve for each method. 
Cross Method Validation Between Investigative Sites
The applicant provides cross validation data for pivotal studies CQVM149B2301 and CQVM149B2302, in 
an attempt to show suitable concordance between analytical methods used to determine specific 
analytes. Cross-method validation failed for samples collected during pivotal study CQVM149B2302. 
The calibration curve used during cross-validation studies for QAB149 was systematically high due to 
an error in preparation. The applicant has taken appropriate action to identify, discard and replace 
erroneous calibration standards prior to the analysis of participant samples from study.
Population PK analyses
For the popPK analyses, standard methods were generally used and considered acceptable. One 
population PK model was developed for each compound.
Indacaterol
The final popPK model for indacaterol was a two-compartment disposition model with a short zero-
order absorption of a fraction of the drug followed by a rapid first-order absorption of the rest of the 
drug and first-order elimination. To account for differences in Cmax concentrations between study 
CQVM149B2301 and CQVM149B2302, a study effect was estimated on Vc/F. Based on simulations, no 
difference in the PK of indacaterol was identified with different formulations. Covariates included were 
body weight on CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F and Vp/F, and grouped race (Caucasian/White, Japanese, Other) on 
Vc/F. The effects of these covariates on indacaterol PK following inhalation of QMF149 or QVM149 in 
patients with asthma, were considered by the applicant to be small in magnitude and not clinically 
relevant, which is agreed. Age, sex, smoking status, baseline eGFR and FEV1 at baseline were not 
statistically significant covariates.
Overall, the final popPK model described the indacaterol plasma concentrations with reasonable 
precision. 
Glycopyrronium
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 63/142
The final popPK model for glycopyrronium was a two-compartment model with bolus administration 
and first-order elimination. No study effects were included in the final model for glycopyrronium. Based 
on simulations, no difference in the PK of glycopyrronium was identified with different formulations. 
Covariates included in the final model were body weight on CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F and Vp/F with fixed, 
default allometric scaling factors, and an effect of grouped race (Caucasian/White, Japanese, Other) on 
Vc/F. Age, sex, smoking status, baseline eGFR and FEV1 at baseline were not statistically significant 
covariates. The applicant considered that the effects of covariates on glycopyrronium PK were small in 
magnitude and not clinically relevant. 
Overall, the final popPK model described the glycopyrronium plasma concentrations adequately. The 
model included the absorption process being implemented as an IV bolus input, since the available PK 
data did not allow estimating the high absorption rate reliably. Model parameters were estimated with 
reasonable precision (RSE<35%) except for the effect of non-Caucasian/Japanese patients (RSE 
320%), which was maintained in the model to enable estimation of the effect of Japanese patients 
relative to Caucasian patients. 
Mometasone furoate
The final popPK model for MF was a linear two-compartment disposition model with mixed zero/first 
order absorption and first-order elimination. Formulation effects were introduced on relative 
bioavailability, central volume and peripheral volume, and a study effect on central volume. Covariates 
included were body weight on CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F and Vp/F, and baseline FEV1 on CL/F and Vc/F. 
Covariate effects on MF PK following inhalation of QMF149 or QVM149 in patients with asthma, were 
considered by the applicant to be small in magnitude and not clinically relevant, which is agreed. Age, 
sex, Japanese ethnicity, smoking status and baseline eGFR were not statistically significant covariates.
Overall, the final popPK model describes the MF plasma concentrations reasonably well. Model 
parameters were estimated with reasonable precision overall. There was a tendency for over-prediction 
of the variability, particularly in the phase II study. 
Absorption (bioavailability and bioequivalence)

Indacaterol salt bridging
In Study CQVM149B2203, AUC0-24,ss and Cmax0-24,ss values were similar regardless of the 
indacaterol salt used. Bioequivalence analysis demonstrated the 90% CI to be contained with the 
80-125% equivalence margins. This study suggests the choice of either indacaterol acetate or 
maleate salt does not have any substantial effect on plasma concentration levels of monotherapy 
indacaterol.
In study CQAB149D2301 AUC0-24 and Cmax values were similar regardless of the indacaterol salt 
that was used. Bioequivalence analysis demonstrated the 90% CI to be contained with the 80-
125% equivalence margins. This study suggests the choice of acetate, maleate or xinafoate 
indacaterol salt does not have a substantial effect on plasma concentration levels of indacaterol. 
These results are consistent with study CQVM149B2203, however this study used a different dose 
(400ug v 150ug) and examined PK on a different day (day 7 v day 15). 
The applicant has provided in vitro data to support similar fine particle mass (FPM) between the 
maleate and acetate salts, suggesting the portion of the drug reaching the lungs to be similar. 
Differences in larger particle sizes could potentially have resulted in differences in clinical safety 
and efficacy amongst the different salt forms. The DDI study CQMF149E2102 confirms equivalence 
between the proposed FDC with acetate salt and indacaterol monotherapy with acetate salt. 
The clinical studies CQVM149B2203 and CQAB149D2301 confirm the bioequivalence between 
indacaterol monotherapy acetate and maleate salts. However, there is no direct comparison 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020

between the proposed FDC with acetate salt and the indacaterol monotherapy with maleate salt. As 
study CQVM149B2203 demonstrates similar efficacy and safety results between the different salts, 
this issue is not pursued further. 
 Mometasone device bridging
MF Twisthaler and MF Concept1 are different with regards to both the inhalation device and the 
formulations they deliver. A 3-step bridging approach was used to identify doses of MF in the 
Concept1 device that were comparable to the corresponding doses of MF in the Twisthaler device 
as part of QVM149 development. The comparable dose of MF in the Concept1 device compared to 
MF in the licenced Twisthaler device was 195 ug (study CQMF149E2101). This dose was then 
adjusted to 160 µg, based on the increased delivery of MF subsequent to the first actuation (i.e. 
the second dose) and tested in study CQMF149E2201. Study CQMF149E2101 was an open-label, 
single-dose, two-part study in healthy volunteers to compare systemic exposure of mometasone 
furoate when delivered by oral inhalation via the proposed Concept1 device and the licenced MF 
Twisthaler device, and to determine the effect of activated charcoal on the absorption of MF 
delivered via the Concept1 device. 
Results suggested that 195ug of MF with the Concept1/Breezhaler device produces similar plasma 
concentrations to 400ug of MF with the Twisthaler device. These results are in agreement with the 
preliminary in-vitro technical evaluation cascade impaction data that suggested that a 2- to 4-fold 
lower dose of MF in the Concept1 would be required to provide a lung dose equivalent to that from 
2×200 μg MF in the Twisthaler device. 
Part 2 of this study aimed to examine oral availability of MF in relation to pulmonary availability by 
performing a charcoal study. Insufficient oral absorption of MF blocked by charcoal (74% reduction 
in oral AUC; protocol required at least 85% reduction) therefore the study was discontinued and 
only systemic MF exposure was measured. Therefore, comparable exposure could be accepted as a 
surrogate for similar safety between products but not as supportive of similar efficacy.
Study CQMF149E2201 results suggest that systemic exposure after 80ug of MF delivered by the 
Concept1/Breezhaler device is lower compared to 200ug of MF delivered by the Twisthaler device. 
Therefore, asthma patients may receive lower levels of MF in the proposed FDC than the equivalent 
licenced MF Twisthaler. These results are in contrast to the increased efficacy results reported for 
this study (described in efficacy section) after 80ug of MF was delivered with the Concept1 device 
compared with MF delivered with the Twisthaler device. Further analysis demonstrated that the 
degree of ICS sensitivity was by chance not evenly distributed between treatment groups at 
randomisation. Re-analysing the PD data to include a covariate of ICS sensitivity demonstrated 
that the difference between the inhalers is reduced at the corresponding dose levels. 
Overall, there were 4 studies which compared the MF exposure via Concept1 and Twisthaler 
devices: the two bioequivalence studies discussed above, and 2 pivotal phase 3 studies. A direct 
comparison between all 4 studies comparing the Concept1 and Twisthaler devices is difficult 
[different doses used, different populations (healthy volunteer’s v patients), and different assays]. 
The results are not consistent for all device studies. Bioequivalence between MF in Twisthaler and 
Concept1 inhalers was demonstrated for study CQMF149E2101 in healthy volunteers and similar 
results were observed for pivotal study CQVM149B2303. In study CQMF149E2201, lower plasma 
levels were obtained for low dose MF in the Concept1 device compared to low dose MF in the 
Twisthaler device, while in study CQVM149B2301 higher plasma levels were obtained for MF in the 
Concept1 compared to MF in the Twisthaler. As the PK data are not sufficient to determine the 
equivalent exposure for mometasone in the Concept1 inhaler, safety and efficacy data must be

Component interaction within the QMF149 FDC and the QVM149 FDC
Study CQMF149E2102 evaluated indacaterol and MF delivered in free or in fixed combination 
(QMF149) via the Concept1 device. While the mean PK parameters (AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss) for 
both actives appear higher in the FDC compared to the monotherapy treatments, the ratio of 
adjusted geometric means of 90% CIs was contained within the bioequivalence margins of 80 -
125% for all pairwise comparisons, with the exception of MF FDC versus MF monotherapy where 
the 90% CI for Cmax was 1.13 to 1.26. As this is only slightly above the threshold of 1.25 for a 
single comparison, it is agreed that there is no apparent DDI between the active components in 
QMF149. Despite demonstrating comparable systemic exposure, this doesn’t rule out potential PD 
interactions in patients where bronchodilation may enhance lung deposition, since bronchodilation 
may not occur to the same extent in healthy volunteers. Therefore, studies in patients are also 
required to examine PD. 
Study CQVM149B2102 evaluated the potential PK DDI between the active components in QVM149, 
delivered via the Concept1 device, by comparing the PK of these three drugs after oral inhalation 
as a fixed dose combination versus oral inhalation of each of the drugs alone via the Concept1 
device. The design and methodology of this study is considered acceptable. The dose chosen for 
the fixed dose combination QVM149 150/50/160 μg represented the highest dose to be tested at 
steady state in the global Phase III asthma program. This is acceptable because MF exhibits dose-
proportional PK between QVM149 150/50/80 µg and QVM149 150/50/160 µg in healthy subjects.
The results do not fully demonstrate a lack of DDI between the active components of QVM149. The 
geometric mean ratios and 90% CIs for AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss both fell within the 
bioequivalence limits of 0.80-1.25 for indacaterol and MF. For glycopyrronium, the geometric mean 
ratios and 90% CIs for AUC0-24h,ss fell within the bioequivalence limits of 0.80–1.25, while for 
Cmax,ss the upper limit of the 90% CI was 1.34. Therefore, the possibility of safety concerns of 
the glycopyrronium component of QVM149 compared to glycopyrronium monotherapy will need to 
be addressed adequately in the clinical studies.
Distribution and Elimination
No new studies have been conducted for QVM149. This is acceptable since distribution, metabolism 
and excretion of each component are not expected to be different for the FDC compared to 
monotherapy.
For glycopyrronium, genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 as well as in the transporters (OCT2 and 
MATE1) involved in the renal elimination is considered unlikely to have clinically relevant 
implications. Genetic polymorphism related variability is not expected to affect MF systemic 
exposure or have any clinically relevant consequences.
Dose proportionality
MF exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased dose proportionally between QVM149 150/50/80 μg and 
QVM149 150/50/160 μg in both Japanese and Caucasian healthy male subjects (Study 
CQVM149B1101). Slightly less than dose proportional increase in MF systemic exposure was noted 
following QVM149 administration in patients with asthma (Study QVM149B2302). Formal dose 
proportionality assessments were not performed for indacaterol and glycopyrronium as only one 
dose was used for both monocomponents (i.e. 150 μg for indacaterol and 50 μg for 
glycopyrronium). This is acceptable by CHMP.
Pharmacokinetics in the target population
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 66/142
Indacaterol plasma concentrations across all 3 pivotal efficacy trials (CQVM149B2301, 
CQVM149B2302 and CQVM149B2303) were similar.
PK sub-studies results from CQVM149B2301 indicate that 160 ug of MF in Concept1 results in 
higher plasma concentrations than 400 ug of MF in the Twisthaler device. Results from 
CQVM149B2303 indicate that 80 ug of MF in Concept1 results in similar plasma concentrations to 
200 ug of MF in the Twisthaler device.
The pivotal efficacy study CQVM149B2302 did not involve MF in the Twisthaler device, only MF in 
the Concept1 device. Results indicated a difference in plasma levels between MF in the double 
therapy compared to the triple therapy. Comparable doses between the double and triple therapy 
were supposed to be 320 ug QMF149 and 160 ug QVM149, and 160 ug QMF149 and 80 ug 
QVM149. However, the MF in the triple therapy QVM149 resulted in higher plasma concentrations 
compared to the ‘equivalent’ doses in the double therapy QMF149 (e.g. at day 30, the MF high 
dose of QVM149 resulted in a Ctrough of 146 pg/mL, while for QMF149 it was 118 pg/mL). 
It is noted that for QMF149 80 µg, the delivered dose of MF is 62.5 µg, while for QVM149 it is 68 
µg. Similarly, for QMF149 160 µg, the delivered dose of MF is 127.5 µg, while for QVM149 it is 136 
µg. 
24 hour PK data was presented for a sub-set of patients, of study QMF149E2203 while sparse 
sampling data and Ctrough measurements were presented for all patients. Results indicate an 
approximate doubling of plasma concentrations at day 14 between 75 and 150 ug. This trend is 
confirmed after sensitivity analysis. It is noted that a large percentage of samples were excluded 
due to plasma levels below LLOQ or due to high pre-dose levels. 
Special populations
 Renal impairment
Based on the information for monotherapy components, no significant differences in indacaterol and 
MF PK are expected in patients with renal impairment. 
The covariate tested for an effect of renal function was BSA-normalised GFR. In line with the EMA 
guideline on the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products in patients with decreased 
renal function (EMA/83874/2014), the applicant has since re-analysed using absolute GFR (mL/min) 
and the SmPC has been updated with acceptable information. 
 Hepatic impairment
The findings for the monotherapy components of hepatically impaired subjects/patients are considered 
valid for QVM149. The proposed SmPC for QVM149 states “No dose adjustment is required in patients 
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available for the use of Enerzair Breezhaler in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment, therefore Enerzair Breezhaler should be used in these 
patients only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk’. 
 Gender
Based on the popPK analysis, there was no relevant effect of gender on the PK of either indacaterol, 
glycopyrronium or MF following QVM149 administration.
 Race
Study QMF149E1101 assessed PK of indacaterol acetate and mometasone furoate in Japanese and 
Caucasian healthy subjects following multiple inhaled doses of QMF149 via Concept1. When comparing 
plasma levels on day 12, 13 and 14, the ratio of adjusted geometric means 90% CIs for both actives 
were contained within the bioequivalence margins of 80 -125%, indicating steady state had been 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 67/142
reached. This is also in agreement with the Hirobriz Breezhaler SmPC, indicating a steady state with 
indacaterol reached within 12 to 14 days. Results demonstrated that 90% CI for AUC and Cmax values 
for indacaterol were higher for Japanese subjects compared to Caucasian subjects by approximately 
20% for both concentrations 80 and 320ug. As a result none of the 90% CI for any pairwise 
comparison was contained within the standard bioequivalence limits of 80-125%. As an example, for 
AUC0-24h,ss with 320ug MF, the upper limit of the 90% CI reached 1.45. Similar results were 
observed for mometasone. 
Study CQVM149B1101 was an exploratory study to assess ethnic sensitivity based on the steady state 
systemic exposure of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and MF in Japanese and Caucasian healthy male 
subjects. It is agreed that the observed differences in exposure are unlikely to be due to an ethnic 
difference in metabolic processes since no ethnic variation has been reported for the expression and 
polymorphisms of enzymes involved in the metabolism of these compounds. The exploratory analyses 
suggested that body weight may be a contributing factor to the observed difference in indacaterol, 
glycopyrronium and MF exposure between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. 
In the popPK analysis, the effect of race on indacaterol PK following inhalation of QMF149 or QVM149 
in patients with asthma was negligible for AUC0-24 and relatively small in magnitude for Cmax in a 
patient with a body weight of 75 kg. It is agreed that this effect is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. 
Race was not found to be a statistically significant covariate on MF PK. For glycopyrronium, following 
inhalation of QMF149 or QVM149 in patients with asthma, population mean AUC0-24h in Japanese and 
Caucasian patients of the same body weight was identical. Population mean Cmax in Japanese patients 
was 60% higher than in Caucasian patients of the same body weight.  In simulations of Japanese 
patients with low body weight (35kg), AUC and Cmax were increased by 77% and 219%, respectively. 

Body weight
Based on the popPK analyses, the effect of body weight on both indacaterol and MF PK following 
inhalation of QMF149 or QVM149 in patients with asthma was relatively small in magnitude. It is 
agreed that this effect is unlikely to be of clinically relevance for both of these compounds. The 
applicant considered that the effect of weight on glycopyrronium PK was not clinically relevant. 
However, simulations based on the popPK model estimated that patients with low body weight (35-
55 kg) had between 26-77% higher glycopyrronium AUC0-24, and between 33-103% higher Cmax.
The applicant presented the results of simulations to predict exposure in low body weight (53 kg) and 
renally impaired (GFR 62 mL/min) Caucasian and Japanese subjects. The wording for section 5.2 is 
acceptable by CHMP and adequately reflects the data.

Elderly
In the popPk analyses, age was not found to be a statistically significant covariate for either 
indacaterol, glycopyrronium or MF PK. In line with the Asmanax Twisthaler, Seebri Breezhaler and 
Onbrez Breezhaler SmPCs, the following text is proposed to the SmPC: “No dose adjustment is 
required in elderly patients (65 years of age or older)”. 
Only 2 patients 75-84 years of age were included in the phase III studies. Higher values of 
glycopyyrronium and mometasone furoate Cmax were shown in patients 65-74 years of age, compared 
to younger patients. Contrary, mometasone furoate Cmax was significantly lower in 75-84 years of 
age, compared to younger patients. Post marketing data do not indicate any clinically relevant issues, 
therefore, no clinically relevant differences in efficacy and safety should be expected.

Table 21 Number of elderly patients who participated in PK sub-studies

Children
QVM149 has not been evaluated in patients <18 years of age. This is acceptable since QVM149 is 
indicated for the treatment of asthma in adult patients.
Interactions
No new data on in vitro or in vivo drug interactions of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone 
furoate were provided. 
In vitro studies for individual components of QVM149 demonstrated that indacaterol, glycopyrronium, 
and MF are unlikely to alter the clearance of drugs that are mainly eliminated through metabolism by 
the major cytochrome P450 enzymes and/or of drugs whose absorption or disposition is affected by 
clinically relevant drug transporters. Except for strong inhibitors of active renal cation transport 
processes, which may reduce glycopyrronium clearance, CYP3A4 inhibitors that may modulate 
indacaterol or mometasone furoate metabolism, or P-gp inhibitors which may affect indacaterol 
disposition, co-medications are unlikely to alter the PK of QVM149 components.
The potential for systemic PK interaction between indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide, and 
MF is low, based on in vitro data and clinical drug interaction studies conducted for the indacaterol 
maleate, glycopyrronium bromide and MF monotherapy development programs.
In the development programs for the dual combinations, there was no PK interaction following 
concomitant administration of indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium or following concomitant 
administration of indacaterol acetate and MF via the Concept1 device. The potential for a PK 
component interaction between glycopyrronium and MF is also considered low as glycopyrronium and 
MF are predominantly metabolized by different CYP enzymes (glycopyrronium is predominantly 
metabolized by CYP2D6 and MF is metabolized by CYP3A4), and both are not known to be an inhibitor 
or an inducer of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4.
Thus, the clearance mechanisms of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and MF are not anticipated to interfere 
with each other and the compounds are unlikely to act as inhibitors and/or inducers. Consequently, no 
drug-drug interactions between the individual components of QVM149 are anticipated.
In Study CQVM149B2102 the steady-state systemic exposure (AUC0-24h,ss; Cmax,ss) to indacaterol, 
glycopyrronium, and MF was similar after once-daily administration of FDC as QVM149 150/50/160 µg 
as compared to the once daily administration of indacaterol acetate 150 µg, glycopyrronium bromide 
50 µg and MF 190 µg when administered alone, respectively.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
Concerns were raised during the assessment which have now been resolved. Overall, the clinical 
pharmacology properties of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone with QVM149 have been 
adequately studied and are adequately described in the SmPC.
2.5.  Clinical efficacy
2.5.1.  Dose response studies
Two dose strengths of QVM149 are proposed; the strengths differ in the dose of inhaled corticosteroid 
(MF). The doses of the individual components of the QVM149 FDC are based on the approved doses of 
monotherapy products. 
The applicant submitted 5 studies in asthma patients to support dose selection for the monotherapy 
components in the triple combination QVM149. These studies are presented briefly below and in the 
discussion on clinical efficacy and focus on primary and secondary efficacy endpoints most closely 
aligned to endpoints in the pivotal studies. 
 Mometasone studies to support dose selection for the Concept 1 device
The applicant has developed their double (LABA/ICS) and triple (LABA/LAMA/ICS) combination using 
the Concept 1 device. The MF Twisthaler and MF Concept1 differ with regards to the inhalation device 
and the formulations delivered. 
The applicant used a 3-step bridging approach to identify doses of MF via the Concept1 device that 
were comparable to the corresponding doses of MF in the Twisthaler device.
In this 3-step MF bridging approach, the results of MF PK study CQMF149E2101 were step 1, the 
application of in-vitro data correlations was step 2 and study CQMF149E2201 was step 3.  The overall 
aim was to support the selection of low, mid and high dose MF Concept 1 doses (80, 160 and 320 µg) 
to be combined with indacaterol acetate in the QMF149 FDC (Atectura Breezhaler) and with 
glycopyrronium bromide in the QVM149 FDC, for the Phase III COPD and asthma programmes. 
Study CQMF149E2201 
Trial title: A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 4-week treatment, parallel-group 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of mometasone furoate delivered via 
Concept1 or Twisthaler in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma
Study participants 
A total of 739 patients were randomized and 735 included in the FAS.
Primary objectives and primary endpoint
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of treatment with MF 80 μg 
and 320 μg od via Concept1 to MF 200 μg and 800 μg od via Twisthaler in terms of 24 h post-dose 
trough FEV1 after 4 weeks of treatment.

Primary endpoint: Trough FEV1 at 4 weeks
Table 22 Trough FEV1(L) at Week 4: Between-treatment comparisons for non-inferiority of 
Concept1 to Twisthaler devices (FAS)
The study met its primary endpoints and was consistent on secondary endpoints. For the primary 
efficacy endpoint, the difference in LS mean trough FEV1 at Week 4 between MF 80 μg in Concept1 
and MF 200 μg in Twisthaler groups was 68 mL (p<0.001) with the lower limit of the 97.5% CI of 0 
mL. 
The difference in LS mean trough FEV1 at Week 4 between MF 320 μg in Concept1 and MF 800 μg in 
Twisthaler groups was 25 mL (p<0.001) with the lower limit of the 97.5% CI of -42.7 mL.
Overall the study demonstrated non-inferiority based on the primary efficacy endpoint for MF 
delivered via the Concept1 device compared to the previously approved MF doses in the Twisthaler and 
therefore supports the dose range used in the pivotal studies.

Indacaterol studies to support dose selection for the Concept 1 device
1. Study CQMF149E2203
Trial title: A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, 12-week treatment, parallel-
group study to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of indacaterol acetate (75 and 150 
micrograms o.d.) in patients with persistent asthma.
Study participants 
A total of 335 patients were randomized and 317 completed the study.
Primary objectives and primary endpoint
To demonstrate superiority of indacaterol acetate 75 or 150 μg to placebo with respect to 24 h post-
dose trough FEV1 after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with persistent asthma.
2. Study QVA149A2210
Trial title: A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate 
the efficacy, safety and tolerability of five different doses of inhaled indacaterol (QAB149) delivered via 
the single dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI) in patients with persistent asthma.
Study participants 
A total of 91 patients were randomized and 84 completed the study.
Primary objectives and primary endpoint
The primary objective of this study was to assess the acute (24-hour) bronchodilator effects of 5 
different doses of indacaterol maleate (27.5 μg b.i.d., 37.5 μg o.d., 55 μg o.d. 75 μg o.d., and 150 μg 
o.d.) versus placebo on FEV1 AUC(0-24h) in patients with asthma.
Key secondary endpoint Trough FEV1
3. Study CQAB149B2357
Trial title: A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo controlled, parallel-group study to 
assess the efficacy and safety of different doses of indacaterol in adult patients with persistent asthma, 
using salmeterol as an active control
Study participants A total of 511 patients were randomized and 483 completed the study.
Primary objectives and primary endpoint
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the dose response relationship among four doses 
of indacaterol (18.75, 37.5, 75, and 150 μg o.d.), placebo and salmeterol 50 μg twice a day (b.i.d.) as 
measured by trough FEV1 at day 15.
Primary efficacy results
Study CQMF149E2203 met its primary endpoint.  Both 75 μg and 150 μg indacaterol acetate groups 
demonstrated statistically significant improvement in trough FEV1 at 12 weeks compared with placebo 
(0.106L and 0.080L) There was a numerically greater improvement in the indacaterol acetate 150 μg 
group compared with the indacaterol acetate 75 μg group (The study was not powered to detect a 
statistically significant difference). The applicant chose 0.17L for a MCID change from baseline. 
(Santanello 1999) This was achieved by the 150 μg group (0.183L) but not the 75 μg (0.157L) or 
placebo groups (0.077L) it is acknowledged there is no well-established minimal important difference 
(MID) in asthma for improvement in trough FEV1 from baseline or between active treatment and 
placebo and between active treatments.

Study QVA149A2210 met its primary endpoint. After one day of treatment, all 5 indacaterol maleate 
treatments showed a clinically meaningful effect throughout the 24-hours compared to placebo. 
Estimated treatment differences of change from period baseline in FEV1 AUC(0-24h) for indacaterol 
37.5 μg o.d.(0.09L), 75 μg o.d.(0.137L) and 150 μg o.d.(0.183L) treatments were statistically 
significant compared to placebo. A dose-ordered response was demonstrated. 
For the secondary endpoint, change from baseline in trough FEV1, all 5 indacaterol treatments showed 
a statistically significant change from period baseline in trough FEV1 compared to placebo, with 
clinically important difference in the 150 dose.
Study CQAB149B2357 
The primary endpoint of Trough FEV1 day 15 reflects the 14-day time to reach PK steady state.  The 
applicant chose 0.2L (Pellegrino 2005) as a pre-specified MCID for a treatment difference against 
placebo. This was not observed for any dose of indacaterol or salmeterol although it is acknowledged 
that a lower value could be an acceptable MCID for LABA on ICS background.
The greatest treatment difference between an active treatment group (indacaterol or salmeterol) and 
the placebo group was achieved in the indacaterol 75 μg treatment group (0.17 L). The treatment 
differences compared with the placebo group were the same in the indacaterol 150 μg and salmeterol 
treatment groups (both 0.13 L). The smallest treatment differences compared with the placebo group 
were observed in the indacaterol 18.75 and 37.5 μg treatment groups (both 0.10 L).

Indacaterol salt bridging studies to support the acetate formulation for the Concept 1 
device
Indacaterol is approved for use in COPD in the maleate salt form. The applicant used the acetate salt 
form in the development of QVM149 and performed two studies (CQVM149B2203 and 
CQAB149D2301) to demonstrate comparable efficacy between the maleate and acetate salts.
In study CQVM149B2203 both indacaterol salts showed significant and clinically relevant 
improvements in trough FEV1 at day 14 compared to placebo (0.186L and 0.146L). The treatment 
difference between the maleate and acetate was 0.04L. 
In study CQAB149D2301 all three indacaterol salt treatments demonstrated a clinically relevant 
increase in trough FEV1 at day 7 compared to placebo and the differences between each form (acetate, 
maleate, xinofoate) were close to zero. 
 Glycopyrronium study to support dose selection for the Concept 1 device
Study CQVM149B2204
Trial title: A multicentre, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 3-period complete 
cross-over study to assess the bronchodilator effects and safety of glycopyrronium bromide

Study participants 
A total of 148 patients were randomized and 144 completed the study.
Primary objectives and primary endpoint
To evaluate the bronchodilator effects of NVA237 delivered by the Concept1 inhaler in patients with 
asthma in terms of trough FEV1 following one week of treatment.

The primary endpoint was met. The treatment differences in trough FEV1 after one week of treatment 
between NVA237 50 μg and placebo (0.089L) and between NVA237 25 μg (0.090L) and placebo were 
statistically significant. There was no demonstrated treatment difference between the 25 μg and 50 μg 
doses for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
There was also no treatment difference seen consistently across secondary endpoints (FEV1 AUCs 
across different time intervals).
The applicant proposes the 50 μg OD dose for the QVM triple combination.
2.5.2.  Main study
The  applicant  submitted  one  pivotal  study  supporting  the  use  of  triple  combination  (medium  dose 
QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. and high dose QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. both delivered via Concept1) in 
patients with asthma. 
This marketing authorization application was submitted under the scope of Article 10b and the proposed 
fixed combination medicinal products are intended for use in patients who are insufficiently responding 
to existing therapy (‘add-on indication’).
Study CQVM149B2302
Study title: A multicentre, randomized, 52-week, double-blind, parallel group, active controlled study 
to compare the efficacy and safety of QVM149 with QMF149 in patients with asthma. 
Methods/ Study design 
This study used a 52-week treatment, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group design. 
The  study  consisted  of  4  Epochs:  Screening  Epoch  (2  weeks),  Run-In  Epoch  (2  weeks),  double-blind 
Treatment Epoch (52 weeks: from randomization to Week 52), and Follow-up Epoch (30 days).
All patients should have used inhaled LABA/ICS for at least 3 months and been on stable medium or high 
dose LABA/ICS for at least 1 month prior to Visit 1.
The Run-In Epoch was 2 weeks in duration and was used to assess eligibility of the patients to enter the 
treatment Epoch and to collect baseline values for some variables.
At Visit 101 all patients received an open-label “medium” dose of ICS combined with LABA, salmeterol 
xinafoate/fluticasone  propionate  50/250  μg  b.i.d.,  which  was  used  throughout  the  Run-In  Epoch  and 
stopped at Visit 102.
The Treatment Epoch is the period from randomization (baseline) through Week 52. At the start of the 
treatment Epoch (Visit 201), eligible patients were randomized to 1 of the 5 treatment groups with an 
equal (1:1:1:1:1) randomization ratio:
1. QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1
2. QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1
3. QMF149 150/160 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1
4. QMF149 150/320 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1
5. Salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d. delivered via Accuhaler.
Follow-up Epoch : A final telephone contact was scheduled to be conducted at 30-days after last 
treatment date (telephone visit 301 or unscheduled visit safety call for patients who discontinue 
treatment earlier than 52 weeks).

Outcomes/endpoints

Trough FEV1 (primary endpoint after 26 weeks)
The primary variable was trough FEV1 after 26 weeks of treatment in patients with asthma.
Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of the 2 FEV1 measurements taken 23 hours 15 min and 23 
hours 45 min post-evening dose. Trough FEV1 measurements were done at Day 2, Day 184 (Week 26, 
the primary endpoint) and Day 365.
 Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) 
In this study, the ACQ-7 was used to assess improvements in asthma symptom control. The ACQ-7  is 
a 7-item, disease-specific instrument developed and validated to assess asthma control in patients in 
clinical trials as well as in individuals in clinical practice. ACQ-7 was provided to the site. All 7 items 
were then scored on a 7-point Likert scale, with 0 indicating total control and 6 indicating poor control.
The questions were equally weighted and the total score was the mean of the 7 items. Change from 
baseline in ACQ-7 scores of ≥ 0.5 ((i.e., a decrease of ACQ-7 score of at least 0.5 from baseline) is 
generally accepted as MCID
 Other secondary endpoints

FEV1, FVC, and Forced Expiratory Flow (FEF) between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF25-75) over 52 
weeks
Morning and Evening Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEF) over 26 and 52 weeks
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 78/142
An electronic Peak Flow Meter was given to each patient at Visit 1 for the measurement of morning and 
evening PEF from Visit 101 until the end of the treatment period. At each time point, the patient was 
instructed to perform 3 consecutive maneuvers within 10 minutes. These PEF values were captured in 
the e-PEF/diary. The best of 3 values are used.
Percent of patients achieving the minimal important difference (MID) in ACQ-7 (defined as ACQ 
≥ 0.5)
Percentage of days with no symptoms, the percentage of days with no awakenings and the 
percentage of mornings with no symptoms on rising over 52 weeks of treatment
The night-time symptom score consisted of one question 'How did you sleep last night?' which has to 
be answered with scores from 0 to up to 4. The morning score consisted of the question 'Did you have 
asthma symptoms upon awakening in the morning?' There are 5 questions including the today's 
severity of shortness of breath, wheeze, cough, and chest tightness during the past 12 hours, and 'Did 
your respiratory symptoms stop you from performing your usual daily activities?' which are part of the 
daytime symptom score.
Percentage of days without rescue medication usage (salbutamol/albuterol) as recorded by 
e-diary over 26 and 52 weeks of treatment
Percent of rescue medication free days over 26 and 52 weeks of treatment
The use of rescue salbutamol/albuterol was recorded by patients in their e-Diary 2 times each day in 
the morning and evening prior to taking study medication. In the morning patients recorded the 
number of puffs of rescue medication they had taken during the night and since the last diary entry, 
and in the evening patients record the number of puffs of rescue medication they have taken during 
the day since the morning diary entry.
Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)
AQLQ is a 32-item disease specific questionnaire designed to measure functional impairments that were 
most  important  to  patients  with  asthma,  with  a  recall  time  of  two  weeks  and  each  question  to  be 
answered on a 7-point scale
Exacerbations
A severe asthma exacerbation was defined as an aggravation of asthma symptoms (like shortness 
of breath, cough, wheezing, or chest tightness) that requires systemic corticosteroids (SCS) for at least 
three consecutive days and/or a need for an ER visit (or local equivalent structure), hospitalization due 
to asthma or death due to asthma.
A moderate asthma exacerbation was defined as the occurrence of 2 or more of the following:



Progressive increase of at least one of the asthma symptoms like shortness of breath, cough, 
wheezing, or chest tightness. The symptoms should have been outside the patient’s usual 
range of day-to-day asthma and should last at least 2 consecutive days.
Increased use of “rescue” inhaled bronchodilators
Deterioration in lung function, which last for 2 days or more but usually not severe enough to 
warrant systemic corticosteroids for more than 2 days or hospitalization
A mild asthma exacerbation was defined as the occurrence of one of the following criteria:




 Deterioration of at least one asthma symptoms like shortness of breath, cough, wheezing or 
chest tightness.
Increased use of “rescue” inhaled bronchodilators 
Deterioration in lung function, which last for 2 days or more but usually not severe enough to 
warrant systemic corticosteroids or hospitalization. This deterioration was defined by:
20% decrease in FEV1 from baseline value Or
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 79/142


≥ 20% decrease in am or pm PEF from baseline on 2 out of any 3 consecutive days compared 
to baseline
< 60% of PEF compared to baseline
“Start and end dates” of each reported event
If a second exacerbation was reported less than 7 days after the end date of a previous episode, then 
this was assumed to be one continuous exacerbation with the start date taken from the first episode 
and the end date from the second or last episode. If 2 events were merged based on this “7 day rule”, 
the highest reported severity was used to describe the overall severity of the prolonged event.
Sample size
The initial sample size calculation for the CQVM149B2302 study was updated in Protocol Amendment 5 
(dated 08 FEB 2017) based on the re-estimation of drop-out rate at week 26 at which time the primary 
and key secondary objectives were to be evaluated.  
The sample size calculation took into account the following consideration:
1. To achieve at least 90% power (with multiplicity adjustment) for primary endpoint trough FEV1 
with a treatment difference of 90mL between QVM149 versus QMF149 at the corresponding 
doses, assuming standard deviation of 380 mL based on studies QMF149A2210, QMF149E2201 
and QMF149E2203, and Kerstjens et al (2012).
2. To achieve at least 80% power (with multiplicity adjustment) for key secondary endpoint ACQ-
7 with a treatment difference of 0.15 between QVM149 versus QMF149 at the corresponding 
doses, assuming standard deviation of 0.80 based on studies QMF149A2210, QMF149E2201 
and MF149E2203 and Kerstjens et al (2012).
If 10% dropout rate was assumed, then calculation showed that the sample size of 2980 patients (i.e 
596/group) would provide 97% power for item 1 and 82% power for item 2, with multiplicity 
adjustment as described in the protocol.
The sample size and power calculations were performed in R 3.1.2 with package gMCP.
Randomisation
At  Visit  201,  all  eligible  patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  one  of  the  5  treatment  groups  by  using 
Interactive  Response  Technology  (IRT).  The  Investigator  or  his/her  delegate  contacted  the  IRT  after 
confirming  that  the  patient  fulfils  all  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria.  Randomisation  was  stratified  by 
region.

Blinding (masking)
The study was unblinded for CSR I ‘primary’ analysis. The CSR II (final results at 52 weeks) was provided 
upon request by CHMP. 
A  limited  number  of  pre-specified  members  of  the  program  team  from  Novartis  were  unblended  in  a 
phasic manner. In order to maintain the integrity of the study data, the blinded team members did not 
have access to any of the unblinded data.
Statistical methods
Statistical Analysis Plan
The statistical analyses of the CQVM149B2302 study were conducted according to Clinical Trial Protocol 
Amendment 6, dated 18 DEC 2017. The applicant stated that a statistical analysis plan was prepared 
and documented prior to database lock.
Protocol amendment 6 provided for conduct of the primary analysis after the last patient has 
completed at least 26 weeks treatment or prematurely discontinued:
Two separate CSRs were planned primary analysis CSR (CSR I) and the final CSR (CSR II). CSR I is 
based on the primary database freeze (cut-off date: 27 OCT 2018), which includes all patients who 
complete Week 26 (V207) assessments or withdraw from the study. The CSR I includes primary and 
key secondary endpoints as well as other pre-specified endpoints at Week 26. The endpoints to be 
evaluated after Week 26 were treated as exploratory.
Protocol Amendment 5, dated 08 FEB 2017 included a revision of the sample size based on the re-
estimation of drop-out rate at Week 26 at which time the primary and key secondary objectives are 
evaluated and the addition of efficacy analysis for pooling two doses of QVM149 and QMF149 in the 
exploratory objective.
Deviations from the pre-specified statistical analysis plan in the CSR
In consideration of the GCP non-compliance at 2 clinical sites, a sensitivity analysis was performed by 
assessing for primary, key secondary endpoints and AEs/SAEs both with and without patient data from 
the two sites in order to evaluate whether the data from these sites have an impact on overall results.
Analysis Sets
The randomized (RAN) set consisted of all patients who were assigned a randomization number, 
regardless of whether or not they actually received study medication. Patients in RAN were to be 
analyzed according to the treatment they were randomized to.
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all patients in the RAN set who received at least one dose of 
study medication. Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were to be analyzed according to the 
treatment they were assigned to at randomization.
The Per-Protocol set (PPS) included all patients in the FAS who did not have any major protocol 
deviations. Major protocol deviations were/will be defined in the validation nalysis plan prior to 
database lock and the un-blinding of the study. Patients were to be analysed according to the 
treatment they received.
The Safety Set consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study medication including 
non-randomized patients who received study drug in error. Patients were to be analysed according to 
the treatment they received.
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 81/142
The PK profiling subset included all randomized patients who consented to participate in the additional 
PK sampling and had at least one PK measurement. Patients were to be analysed according to the 
treatment they received
The FAS was used in the analysis of all efficacy variables. Patients in the RAN set was used for a 
summary of patient disposition, demographics and baseline characteristics. The safety set was used in 
the analysis of all safety variables. The PPS was used for supportive analysis of the primary analysis 
only. If patients switched double-blind treatment during the study, they were counted and analyzed 
only once according to their initial treatment.
Statistical hypotheses for primary and key secondary endpoints
The comparisons of QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. versus QMF149 150/160 μg o.d. and QVM149 
150/50/160 μg o.d. versus QMF149 150/320 μg o.d. were evaluated by testing the following null 
hypotheses (H0) versus the alternative hypotheses (Ha) for both the primary variable and key 
secondary variable:
H01: QVM149 150/50/80 μg is equal to QMF149 150/160 μg versus 
Ha1: QVM149 150/50/80 μg is not equal to QMF149 150/160 μg
and
H02: QVM149 150/50/160 μg is equal to QMF149 150/320 μg versus 
Ha2: QVM149 150/50/160 μg is not equal to QMF149 150/320 μg
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint – Trough FEV1
The primary efficacy analyses were conducted in the FAS. 
The following (mixed model repeated measures) MMRM ANCOVA was used for trough FEV1, ACQ-7 and 
other data (if not stated otherwise):
Dependent variable = intercept + treatment + region + baseline value + FEV1 prior to inhalation + 
FEV1 15 to 30 min post inhalation + visit + treatment*visit + baseline value*visit + random effect of 
center nested within region + error
The within-patient correlation was modeled using an unstructured covariance matrix in the mixed 
model. The Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom 
(Kenward and Roger, 1997).
Each between-treatment comparison was carried out using the adjusted mean (least-squares mean) 
difference based on the treatment main effect and the coefficient for the treatment-byvisit interaction 
factor corresponding to Week 26. The estimated adjusted treatment difference (QVM149 – QMF149) 
was displayed along with the associated standard error (SE), 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI), and 
p-value (2-sided). In addition, to estimate the add-on effect of glycopyrronium to QMF149, the 
average of QVM149 doses (150/50/80 μg and 150/50/160 μg) versus the average of QMF149 doses 
(150/160 μg and 150/320 μg) will be computed in terms of FEV1. QVM149 and QMF149 doses were 
pooled using appropriate contrasts within the MMRM specified above.

Sensitivity analyses for Primary Efficacy Endpoint - Trough FEV1
As a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of missing data, a tipping point analysis was performed 
for the primary endpoint trough FEV1 at Week 26. The delta-adjusting approach described in Ratitch et 
al (2013) was used to find the tipping point, in a spectrum of conservative missing not at random 
(MNAR) assumptions, at which conclusions change from being favorable to QVM149 to being 
unfavorable. Different delta values were possible for QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. versus QMF149 
150/160 μg o.d. and QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. versus QMF149 150/320 μg o.d.
The same MMRM used in the primary analysis in the FAS was also performed on the PPS.
Analysis of Key Secondary Efficacy endpoints – ACQ-7
The key secondary variable was ACQ-7 after 26 weeks of treatment, and it was analyzed using the 
same MMRM (including all scheduled visits with ACQ-7 data) on the FAS as used for the primary 
endpoint but includes baseline ACQ-7 score instead of baseline FEV1.
The proportions of patients who achieved a clinically relevant improvement in ACQ-7 score (i.e., 
decrease of ACQ-7 score of at least 0.5 from baseline) at the scheduled post-baseline visits was 
analyzed using a logistic regression GEE model following multiple imputation of missing ACQ-7 values 
under MAR.
Analysis of Other Secondary Efficacy endpoints – Asthma Exacerbations
The following asthma exacerbation-related parameters over the 52 weeks were summarized by 
treatment. The analysis was performed by exacerbation category wherever specified. The exacerbation 
categories were: All (mild, moderate, severe), and the combination of moderate or severe, and severe.




Time to first asthma exacerbation by exacerbation category
Time to first hospitalization for asthma exacerbation
The annual rate of asthma exacerbations by exacerbation category
The annual rate of asthma exacerbation excluding measurements in patients requiring 
corticosteroid use after an exacerbation (beyond permitted steroid taper for exacerbation) by 
exacerbation category.
 Duration of asthma exacerbations in days by exacerbation category




The percentage of patients with at least 1 asthma exacerbation by exacerbation category
Time to permanent study drug discontinuation due to asthma exacerbation
The percentage of patients who permanently discontinued study drug due to asthma 
exacerbation
Total amounts (in doses) of oral corticosteroids used to treat asthma exacerbations
Time-to-event variables were analyzed using a Cox regression model stratified by region. The model 
included treatment and history of asthma exacerbation in the 12 months prior to screening (the 
number of asthma exacerbations in the 12 months prior to screening) as fixed-effect factors and FEV1 
prior to inhalation and FEV1 15 to 30 min post inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol (components of SABA 
reversibility) as covariates. The estimated adjusted hazard ratio for QVM149 over QMF149 were 
displayed along with the associated two-sided 95% confidence interval and corresponding p-value.
Kaplan-Meier analysis stratified by treatment group was also presented and displayed graphically.
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 83/142
The number of the asthma exacerbation were analyzed using a generalized linear model assuming a 
negative binomial distribution. The model included terms for treatment, region and history of asthma 
exacerbation in the 12 months prior to screening (the number of asthma exacerbations in the 12 
months prior to screening), FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 15 to 30 min post inhalation of 
salbutamol/albuterol (components of SABA reversibility).
The log exposure in years was included as an offset variable in the model. The time at risk for a patient 
was defined as the duration of exposure in days + 1 day and the log(time at risk in years) was used as 
the offset variable in the model. No sensitivity analyses were planned for this endpoint.
The duration of asthma exacerbation was defined as the sum of the duration of days recorded as an 
exacerbation for all exacerbations recorded per patient. This was analyzed for treatment group 
differences using the van Elteren test stratified for region and history of asthma exacerbation in the 12 
months prior to screening (1, 2, ≥ 3). Total amount (in prednisone equivalent doses) of oral 
corticosteroid used to treat asthma exacerbation during the 52 weeks.
treatment period was summarized descriptively (i.e., n, mean, standard deviation, median, first and 
third quartile, minimum and maximum) by treatment group.
To estimate the add-on effect of glycopyrronium over QMF149 in terms of exacerbations, the average 
of following treatment contrasts was computed:
 QVM149 (150/50/80 μg) versus QMF149 (150/160 μg)
 QVM149 (150/50/160 μg) versus QMF149 (150/320 μg)
All inferential analyses mentioned above for exacerbation will be repeated to explore the overall 
efficacy of QVM149 compared with QMF149. QVM149 and QMF149 doses will be pooled using 
appropriate contrasts within the analysis models.
Subgroup analysis
The following exploratory subgroup analyses for trough FEV1 at Week 26 using MMRM were performed 
(using the appropriate interaction term in the model and additional covariate as a fixed effect if 
necessary) for the FAS to explore the treatment effect in:






Race (Caucasian, Asian, Black and other)
Sex (male, female)
History of asthma exacerbation in the 12 months prior to screening (1, 2, 3, ≥ 4)
Patients’ prior therapies before run-in period (medium and high dose ICS/LABA)
Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 in % of predicted FEV1 at run-in visit 101 (< 40%, 40% to < 60%, 
60% to < 80%)
ACQ-7 at baseline (1.5 to < 2, 2 to < 2.5, ≥ 2.5)
The subgroup analyses for patient's prior therapies before run-in period (medium and high dose 
ICS/LABA) were performed for endpoints ACQ-7 and AQLQ at Week 26.
Multiplicity adjustment
To control the family-wise type-I error rate at the two-sided 5% significance level, a graphical testing 
procedure based on the generalized Simes test as described in Maurer et al (2011) was used. 
The family for the overall type-I error rate control contains four hypotheses: two hypotheses for the 
primary endpoint trough FEV1 and two hypotheses for the key secondary endpoint ACQ-7.
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 84/142
Denote the two hypotheses for the primary endpoint as H1 and H2 for comparing QVM149 150/50/80 
μg vs. QMF149 150/160 μg and QVM149 150/50/160 μg vs. QMF149 150/320 μg respectively. 
Similarly, denote the two hypotheses for the key secondary endpoint ACQ-7 as H3 and H4, for 
comparing QVM149 150/50/80 μg vs. QMF149 150/160 μg and QVM149 150/50/160 μg vs. QMF149 
150/320 μg respectively. The testing scheme is shown in the graph below:
Other than the 4 analyses mentioned above for the primary and the key secondary endpoint, all other 
analyses were to be performed at the nominal 2-sided 0.05 level without multiplicity adjustment.
Interim analysis
The primary analysis was performed once all patients have completed 26 weeks of treatment (Visit 
207) or prematurely withdrawn from the study. The study continues as planned in a blinded manner 
for full 52 weeks period (plus 30 days of safety follow-up).
The applicant argues that since the analysis of primary and key secondary objectives are performed 
only for the primary analysis CSR, the analyses of these endpoints does not require any adjustment to 
the overall type I error rate. No adjustment to the overall type I error rate is proposed for any of the 
remaining endpoints to be evaluated over 52 weeks that are to be reported in both the primary and 
final CSR, i.e. tested twice. 
Results 
•
Participant flow 
A total of 4851 patients were screened, of whom 3092 were randomized to receive high and medium 
doses of QVM149, QMF149, or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. The patient population was 
balanced across treatment groups.
All randomized patients who received study treatment (3092 minus 24 who did not receive treatment) 
completed 26 weeks of treatment (the time point of both primary and key secondary endpoints for CSR 
I) or prematurely discontinued. Of these 1884 (60.9%) patients had also completed 52 weeks of 
treatment and 302 (9.8%) permanently discontinued the study treatment prematurely.

Recruitment
Study initiation date: 08-Dec-2015 (first patient first visit).
Study completion date: The last patient last visit included in CSR I analysis is 27 Oct-2018. CSR II 
(final study report) was provided during assessment. 
Conduct of the study
There were 6 protocol amendments. Amendment 5 is described earlier in the statistical part. As a part 
of the last amendment (amendment 6) it was decided to perform the primary analysis when all 
patients completed the 26 weeks of treatment. The remaining analysis was planned to be performed 
once the study is ended. 
Two study sites were closed due to GCP related deviations with potential to affect data integrity. 
Sensitivity analysis for primary and key secondary endpoints excluding data from these sites were 
performed. 
A total of 304 (9.8%) patients were excluded from the PPS due to major protocol deviations. For 
further details please refer to the clinical assessment report.

Baseline disease characteristics
The asthma disease characteristics were comparable across 5 treatment groups.
The mean (SD) duration of asthma in all patients was 18.1 (15.30) years with > 60% of the patients 
having had asthma for > 10 years. In the previous 12 months, approximately 80% of the patients had 
a history of 1 asthma exacerbation and 19.7% of the patients had a history of 2 or more asthma 
exacerbations. The mean (SD) ACQ-7 score was 2.51 (0.567).

Outcomes and estimation
Primary efficacy results (Trough FEV1 at Week 26)
The primary efficacy objective of the study was met, with both high and medium doses of QVM149 
demonstrating superiority over the respective doses of QMF149, in terms of trough FEV1 at Week 26 in 
patients with poorly controlled asthma. At Week 26, the LS mean treatment difference for trough FEV1 
was 0.065 L (95% CI 0.027 to 0.103, adjusted p=0.002) for QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. versus 
QMF149 150/320 μg o.d. and 0.074 L (95% CI 0.036 to 0.112, adjusted p<0.001) for QVM149 
150/50/80 μg o.d. versus QMF149 150/160 μg o.d. These treatment differences were statistically 
significant.

QMF149 for change from baseline in trough FEV1 (L) after 26 weeks of treatment (Full 
analysis set)
Supportive analyses for the primary efficacy results (trough FEV1)
To assess the treatment effects in PPS a supportive analysis was performed for change from baseline 
in trough FEV1. The results at Week 26 were consistent with the primary analysis results. The LS 
means treatment differences for trough FEV1 were 0.054 L (95% CI 0.014 to 0.094) with high dose 
and 0.079 L (95% CI 0.039 to 0.120) with medium dose of QVM149 versus the respective doses of 
QMF149.
Sensitivity analysis
In consideration of the GCP non-compliance at 2 sites (Site 1271 in India and Site 1760 in 
Switzerland), a sensitivity analysis was conducted excluding the patients from these 2 sites for trough

FEV1 at Week 26. The results indicated consistent benefit of both QVM149 high and medium doses 
versus respective doses of QMF149 in terms of trough FEV1.
A sensitivity analysis, to evaluate the impact of a deviation from the MAR assumption of missing data 
for was performed for the primary endpoint (trough FEV1) at Day 184 (Week 26) was performed.
The tipping point for high dose QVM149 versus high dose QMF149 in trough FEV1 occurred with a delta 
of 0.21 L. This implied that the average of the Day 184 trough FEV1 values among patients from the 
high dose QVM149 treatment group with a missing Day 184 measurement would need to be 0.21 L 
lower than that of the high dose QVM149 treatment completers in order for the study conclusion on 
high dose QVM149 vs high dose QMF149 to be reversed. For medium dose QVM149 versus medium 
dose QMF149, the tipping point occurred with a delta of 0.31 L.
Key secondary efficacy results (ACQ-7 score after 26 weeks of treatment)
The key secondary objective was not met. There was no meaningful difference in the LS mean ACQ-7 
score at Week 26 for high and medium doses of QVM149 versus the respective doses of QMF149.
Table 28 Least squares (LS) mean treatment difference between doses of QVM149 versus 
QMF149 for ACQ-7 score after 26 weeks of treatment (Full analysis set)
Other secondary efficacy results
QVM149 demonstrated improvement as compared to the corresponding QMF149 doses in trough 
FEV1(by visit), pre-dose, FVC as well as peak expiratory flow, although the difference between these 
treatment groups for PEF at week 26 was below the MCID (defined as 25 L/min).
An additional secondary comparison was performed on QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. and QVM149 
150/50/160 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1 compared with salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 
50/500 μg b.i.d. via Accuhaler.
At Week 26, the LS mean treatment difference for trough FEV1 was 119 ml (95% CI 81 to 157 ml, 
p<0.001) for QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. versus salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 
μg b.i.d. and 98ml (95% CI 60 to 136 ml, p<0.001) for QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. versus salmeterol 
xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d.
In comparison to salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg the high and medium QVM149 doses improved 
morning and evening PEF (L/min). 
There were no differences between treatment groups for the mean daily number of puffs of rescue 
medication. 
In relation to ACQ-7 responder rate, at Week 26, there were no meaningful differences in the 
proportion of patients achieving the MCID between any of the treatment groups. For the high QVM149 
dose versus salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg comparison more responders were seen in in the 
QVM149 group at week 4 and 12 however there was no statistically significant differences at week 26 
between these groups.  There were no meaningful treatment differences between the QVM149 versus

Questionnaire (AQLQ-S) scores. 
Asthma exacerbations
The proportion of patients with asthma exacerbations on study treatment was lower in the QVM149 
and QMF149 treatment groups than in salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. treatment group. Lower 
proportion of patients in the QVM149 and QMF149 groups had moderate or severe, severe, and all 
asthma exacerbations than in the salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. group. Overall, few patients 
had asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalization or exacerbations causing permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment across all treatment groups. 
Table 29 Overview of the number of patients with asthma exacerbations, by exacerbation 
category – 52 weeks data (Full analysis set)
Annualized rate
Over 52 weeks, there was a 15% reduction (rate ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.04) in moderate to 
severe exacerbations and a 22% reduction (rate ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.00) in severe 
exacerbations for high dose QVM149 versus high dose QMF149. Clinically meaningful reductions of 
36% (rate ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.78) in moderate to severe exacerbations and a 42% reduction 
(rate ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.73) in severe exacerbations were observed with high dose QVM149 
compared with salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d.
For all exacerbations (mild, moderate and severe) over 52 weeks, there was a reduction of 21% (rate 
ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96) with high dose QVM149 versus high dose QMF149. High dose 
QVM149 also reduced all asthma exacerbations (mild, moderate and severe) by 40% (rate ratio 0.60, 
95% CI 0.50 to 0.72) versus salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d.
For medium dose QVM149 over 52 weeks, a 13% reduction in moderate or severe exacerbations was 
observed compared to medium dose QMF149 (rate ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.06) and a 7% 
reduction for severe exacerbations (rate ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.17), respectively. Compared to 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d., medium dose QVM149 demonstrated a reduction in the rate of 
moderate to severe exacerbations by 19% (rate ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.99) and the rate of 
severe exacerbations by 16% (rate ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.05).

For all exacerbations over 52 weeks, a 13% reduction was observed for medium dose QVM149 compared 
to medium dose QMF149 (rate ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.06). Medium dose QVM149 demonstrated a 
reduction in the rate of all exacerbations by 30% (rate ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.84) compared to 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d.

Time to first asthma exacerbation
The Cox regression analysis of time to first asthma exacerbation showed that there was no difference 
between the QVM149 doses versus QMF149 doses in reducing the risk of asthma exacerbations 
(moderate or severe, severe, and all).
However,  both  high  and  medium  doses  of  QVM149  reduced  the  risk  of  experiencing  an  asthma 
exacerbation (moderate or severe, severe, and all) versus salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d.

Supportive studies 
Efficacy: Dose timing
The pivotal study for QVM149 was based on evening dosing. The applicant submitted one study in 
support of a flexible once daily dose timing (AM or PM) CQVM149B2209.
Study CQVM149B2209 was a randomized, double-blind, repeat dose cross-over study in 35 patients 
with asthma to assess the bronchodilator effects of once daily QVM149 following morning or evening 
dosing for 14 days compared to placebo in patients with asthma. Aa clinically significant increase in 
FEV1(AUC 0-24h) was demonstrated for QVM149 150/50/80 μg dosed in the morning (0.6096L) or 
evening (0.6152L) with no clinically relevant difference between timing of dosing.

EMA/271332/2020 
Page 101/142
Efficacy: Dose Interval
The applicant submitted one phase II study in support of efficacy and dose interval (OD) for the triple 
combination CQVM149B2208 
Study CQVM149B2208 was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, 3-period 
complete crossover study in 116 patients to assess the bronchodilator effect and safety of two doses of 
QVM149 compared to a fixed dose combination of salmeterol/fluticasone in patients with asthma.
The study met its primary endpoints. Both doses of once daily QVM149 showed a statistically 
significant and a clinically meaningful improvement in peak FEV1 over twice daily salmeterol/fluticasone 
50/500 μg after three weeks of treatment. Mean treatment difference in peak FEV1 was 0.172L for 
QVM 150/50/160 μg OD and 0.159L for QVM 150/50/160 μg OD. 
For secondary endpoint trough FEV1, both QVM149 once daily doses showed a superior treatment 
effect compared to salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Dose response studies
The study design, subject disposition and recruitment criteria were appropriate in the studies 
submitted in support of dose selection for the monotherapy components in the applied for triple FDC 
QVM149. The studied populations were relevant to the enrolled populations in pivotal studies and the 
efficacy endpoints (trough FEV1) were clinically relevant. 
Indacaterol
The indacaterol 150 μg dose was selected based on the approved dose in COPD and supported by 
studies CQMF149E2203, CQVA149A2210 and CQAB149B2357. Indacaterol as maleate salt form is 
approved in COPD. The applicant developed the acetate salt form for the asthma combination product. 
Two salt bridging studies CQVM149B2203 and CQAB149D2301 demonstrated comparable efficacy 
between the acetate and maleate salt forms. A dose-response was demonstrated from low to higher 
doses although the superiority between indacaterol 75 μg and 150 μg was not statistically persuasive. 
In total, these studies are supportive of indacaterol efficacy in asthma It was discussed in a scientific 
advice  in 2011 that 150 μg was an acceptable dose but studies with higher or lower doses could be 
considered. Considering the intended treatment population ranges from moderate to severe asthma 
(GINA 3-5), the applicant provided adequate justification for not pursuing doses lower or higher than 
150 μg indacaterol in their triple combination QVM149. 
Glycopyrronium
The glycopyrronium 50 μg dose was selected based on the approved dose in COPD and supported by 
study CQVM149B2204. Significant improvements in trough FEV1 were demonstrated for both 25 μg 
and 50 μg doses compared to placebo in patients with moderate to severe asthma.  There was no 
demonstrated treatment difference between the 25 μg and 50 μg doses for the primary efficacy 
endpoint.  The applicant proposes the 50 μg OD dose for the QVM triple combination. This is the 
approved dose used in COPD patients and it is acknowledged that tiotropium is approved at the same 
dose in COPD and asthma. Glycopyrronium is not authorised in asthma and the dose response in COPD 
may differ in asthma. This was acknowledged in the CHMP SA in 2014 where the applicant was 
informed that acceptability of the proposed LAMA dose would depend on emerging results. The 
applicant justified using the 50 μg dose for the pivotal studies.

EMA/271332/2020 
Page 102/142
Mometasone
The mometasone (MF) dose selected for QVM149 was supported by study CQMF149E2201. The 
objective of the study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of treatment with MF 80 μg and 320 μg od 
via Concept1 to the already approved MF 200 μg and 800 μg od via Twisthaler. Overall the study 
demonstrated non-inferiority based on the primary efficacy endpoint for MF delivered via the Concept1 
device compared to the previously approved MF doses in the Twisthaler and therefore supports the 
dose range used in the pivotal studies.
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the difference in LS mean trough FEV1 at Week 4 between MF 80 μg 
in Concept1 and MF 200 μg in Twisthaler groups was 68 mL (p<0.001) with the lower limit of the 
97.5% CI of 0 mL. However, whilst the applicant’s chosen non-inferiority margin of 90ml is in line with 
criteria previously agreed with SA (June 2012) the applicant was requested to further justify the 
chosen non-inferiority margin based on clinical relevance. The applicant provided a satisfactory 
response based on literature data and the CHMP agreed the non-inferiority margin chosen was 
conservative and acceptable. 
Furthermore, although pre-specified non-inferiority was met, there was a trend towards superiority in 
the MF 80 μg dose via Concept1 compared to MF doses of 200 μg delivered by Twisthaler. This 
combined with PK and PD results from MF bridging studies raises uncertainties as to whether doses of 
MF delivered from the applicant’s Concept 1 inhaler are equivalent to those delivered from Twisthaler, 
summarised as follows;
PK data
Although, the applicant used 3-step bridging approach to determine these doses, which in principle 
could be agreed, the PK data collected in phase II and III studies show differences in the exposure. In 
some studies, exposure of mometasone from Concept 1 was lower than from Twisthaler. In other 
studies, opposite results were reported. 

For example, in phase 2 study (2201) Mean MF systemic exposure (AUC last, AUC 0-23h35min 
and Cmax) on Day 1 and Day 28 was lower in both the low and high dose of MF Concept1 
groups compared with the corresponding low and high dose of MF Twisthaler groups.
 On the other hand, Pop PK simulations for mometasone showed higher MF exposure in QMF149 
or QVM149 (up to 37 % increase in AUC0-24h) compared with the MF Twisthaler device, 
despite using a multiplicative factor on bioavailability to adjust for different MF doses in 
different formulations.  
PD data
Uncertainty in relation to the equivalence of MF dose delivered by Concept 1 versus Twisthaler also 
arises from the PD data. 
In study 2201, MF doses of 80 μg o.d. in QMF149 delivered by Concept1 could be considered superior 
in respect to trough FEV1 as compared to MF doses of 200 μg o.d. and delivered by Twisthaler. 
It needs to be noted that due to low bioavailability of MF, systemic exposure was considered by the 
applicant as an appropriate surrogate for pulmonary exposure, although charcoal study was not 
performed. These uncertainties have implication for the efficacy and safety assessment:
In relation to efficacy, as required by the guideline on clinical development of fixed combination 
medicinal products (EMA/CHMP/158268/2017), the contribution of a new component included in a FDC 
needs to be quantified. In addition, for fair comparison the doses of ICS in FDC product and in 
Twisthaler should be equivalent. 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 103/142
While the FDC has been compared to mometasone monotherapy in the 2 pivotal studies, the 
assessment of contribution of indacaterol in a FDC (QMF149) compared with MF monotherapy is 
confounded by the fact that mometasone used in QMF149 combination cannot be considered as 
therapeutically equivalent to mometasone delivered as a monotherapy through Twisthaler. Therefore, 
it is not possible to conclude that additional benefits seen in are solely attributable to the LABA 
component (indacaterol). It is possible that some proportion of the observed additional benefit is 
attributable to the mometasone used in the combination.  In this case, the role of indacaterol cannot 
be appropriately quantified. 
In relation to safety, the potential for higher mometasone exposure from Concept1 (Pop PK) could limit 
the ability to extrapolate from the safety data from authorised mometasone formulations.  
Upon request by CHMP, the applicant further justified the equivalence of MF doses and CHMP agreed 
there are no clinically important differences between MF delivered by Concept1 and Twisthaler , thus 
they could be considered equivalent.
Dose timing 
Study CQVM149B2209 supports the applied posology of once daily dosing, dosed in the morning or 
evening. No efficacy or safety concerns are raised.
Dose interval 
Study CQVM149B2208 demonstrated superior short-term efficacy in both strengths of QVM149 
compared to a FDC of salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. in patients eligible for GINA treatment 
steps 4 & 5. No efficacy or safety concerns are raised.
Pivotal studies
The applicant submitted one pivotal study (Study 2302) supporting the use of medium and high dose 
of triple combination of indacaterol, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate (medium dose 
QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. and high dose QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. both delivered via Concept1) in 
patients with asthma. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies
This pivotal study consisted of 4 Epochs: Screening Epoch (2 weeks), Run-In Epoch (2 weeks), double 
blind Treatment Epoch (52 weeks: from randomization to Week 52), and Follow-up Epoch (30 days). 
In this study patients were randomized to 1 of 5 treatment groups and received either QVM149 
150/50/80, QVM149 150/50/160, QMF149 150/160, QMF149 150/320 or an active ICS /LABA 
comparator (salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d. via Accuhaler).  
This marketing authorization application was submitted under the scope of Article 10b and the 
proposed fixed combination medicinal products are intended for use in patients who are insufficiently 
responding to existing therapy (‘add-on indication’). 
In line with the guideline on clinical development of fixed combination medicinal products 
(EMA/CHMP/158268/2017) it is required to demonstrate that each active substance in FDC contributes 
to efficacy and/or benefit-risk balance. In addition, the add-on effect of the additional active substance 
needs to be quantified.
Therefore, as required by the guideline (EMA/CHMP/158268/2017), the objective of this study was to 
establish the contribution of glycopyrronium in this triple fixed dose combination (QVM 149) as 
compared to the dual fixed dose combination  indacaterol/fluticasone (QMF149). In this study, QVM149 
150/50/80 was compared to QMF149 150/160 and QVM149 150/50/160 was compared to QMF149 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 104/142
150/320. For a fair comparison, the dose of ICS and LABA should be the same in both FDC products. 
The dose of indacaterol was the same (i.e. 150 mcg) across four inhalers (QMF149 and QVM149). The 
dose of mometasone was different however, the applicant claims that these doses are equivalent as 
they have the same fine particle mass. Therefore, 160 ug dose of mometasone in QMF149 is claimed 
to be equivalent to 80 μg dose in QVM149 and 320 ug dose of mometasone in QMF149 is claimed 
equivalent to 160 μg dose in QVM149 to which the CHMP agreed.
In line with the fixed dose combination guideline, the superiority in benefit of any fixed dose 
combination would be expected to be demonstrated against each of the valid treatment combinations. 
The applicant compared its triple fixed dose combination (ICS/LABA/LAMA) to ICS/LABA combination 
only. It is agreed that LABA/LAMA combination is not a valid comparator in patients with asthma as 
LABA’s cannot be taken without an ICS. The combination of ICS/LAMA is theoretically possible for the 
treatment of patients GINA step 4 or 5 (GINA 2019 guidelines includes this option); however, it is 
acknowledged that this combination is not being used frequently in practice. 
Phase III studies were conducted to establish the efficacy and safety of QMF149 and these studies are 
discussed in detail in the assessment report for Atectura Breezhaler.

Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria
Study 2302 enrolled adult patients only with inadequately controlled asthma (defined as ACQ-7 score 
≥ 1.5 at randomisation) despite treatments with medium or high dose of LABA/ICS combinations. 
These patients in line with GINA 2019 are within step 4 (on medium dose ICS/LABA at baseline) or 
within GINA step 5 (on high dose ICS/LABA at baseline). It is acknowledged that at the time when this 
study was started all patients enrolled were within the same GINA 2015 disease severity category 
(step 4). However, GINA recommendations were amended significantly in 2019 and currently GINA 
step 4 includes medium dose ICS-LABA whereas high dose ICS/LABAs have been moved to GINA step 
5. Therefore, the trial design and used treatment escalation strategy did not reflect current treatment 
recommendations. All enrolled patients must have had a history of ≥ 1 asthma exacerbation which 
required medical care from a physician, emergency room (ER) visit (or local equivalent structure) or 
hospitalization in the 12 months prior to Visit 1 and required oral corticosteroid treatment. In addition, 
there was requirement to show reversibility (increase in FEV1 of 12% and 200 mL) either at enrolment 
or historically. 
It is noted that current smokers and patients with a significant smoking history were excluded from the 
study. Patients with significant heart disease and those with the risk for QT prolongation were excluded 
(please see safety discussion). Patients with COPD were also excluded.
Run-in period 
During the run-in period (2 weeks) all patients received open-label “medium” dose of ICS combined 
with LABA. For some patients, i.e. those on high dose ICS/LABA, this was a de-escalation of therapy. 
Further discussion in relation to the run- in period was required and provided responses were 
considered as satisfactory.
Treatments
In the study patients received either QVM149 150/50/80, QVM149 150/50/160, QMF149 150/160, 
QMF149 150/320 or an active ICS /LABA comparator (salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 
50/500 μg b.i.d. via Accuhaler). The use of rescue medication was allowed (SABA (100 μg 
salbutamol/90 μg albuterol). 
While other types of ICS, LABA and LAMA medication were prohibited in the study, other types of 
asthma controller medications were allowed provided that the dose was stable for at least 4 weeks 
prior to enrolment. This included leukotriene antagonists/leukotriene inhibitors, short and long-acting 
theophylline, oral corticosteroids (at prednisone equivalent dose of 5 mg daily to 10 mg every other 
day). Monoclonal antibodies approved for the treatment of severe asthma were also allowed. 
Endpoints and analysis 
The main objective of this study was to establish the contribution of glycopyrronium in this triple fixed 
dose combination (QVM 149) as compared to the dual fixed dose combination (QMF149).
In this pivotal study, the assessment of trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) after 26 
weeks of treatment was selected as a primary endpoint. The primary objective of study 2302 was to 
demonstrate the superiority in terms of trough FEV1of either QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. as compared 
to QMF149 150/160 μg o.d. or QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. as compared to QMF149 150/320 μg o.d. 
In line with the asthma guideline (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1) measurement of lung function 
parameters alone is considered insufficient for an assessment of the therapeutic effect. Therefore, the 
applicant selected the assessment of “asthma control” as a key secondary endpoint. Asthma Control 
Questionnaire (ACQ)-7 was assessed after 26 weeks of treatment. 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 106/142
To control the family-wise type-I error rate at the two-sided 5% significance level, a graphical testing 
procedure based on the generalized Simes test was used. The family for the overall type-I error rate 
control contains total 4 hypotheses including: 2 hypotheses for the primary endpoint trough FEV1 (one 
for each dose level) and 2 hypotheses for the key secondary endpoint ACQ-7 (one for each dose level). 
This approach was considered acceptable. 
The applicant selected the 7-point Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) to assess improvements in 
asthma symptoms control. It is noted that this version of questionnaire includes the assessment of 
pre-bronchodilator FEV1%.
 An additional secondary comparison was performed on QVM149 150/50/80 o.d. and QVM149 
150/50/160 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1 compared with salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 
50/500 μg b.i.d. via Accuhaler (authorised ICS/LABA combination). However, these comparisons were 
not included in the confirmatory testing strategy and therefore are considered as supportive only. In 
addition, in the comparison of QVM149 with salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate the add-on 
effect of glycopyrronium cannot be fully quantified as it is not possible to conclude that additional 
benefits seen in the QVM149 groups are solely attributable to glycopyrronium. It is possible that some 
proportion of the observed additional benefit is attributable to differences in the efficacy of ICS and 
LABA components which are different in QVM149 and salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 
inhaler. 
Exacerbations (definition and proposed time for assessment) 
The effect on exacerbations (including the assessment of time to first asthma exacerbation by 
exacerbation category and annual rate of asthma exacerbations by exacerbation category) was 
analysed as a secondary endpoint without adjustment for multiplicity. The assessment of the effect on 
exacerbation is considered to be particularly important. This is reflected in the CHMP guidelines which 
states: for a new long-acting bronchodilator drug to be administered as concomitant medication with 
inhaled corticosteroids, an effect on both lung function and exacerbations should be demonstrated. For 
a new controller treatment, the preferred primary endpoint is exacerbations. 
In line with the study objective the effect on exacerbation is to be assessed at week 52. The applicant 
defined a severe asthma exacerbation as requirement for systemic corticosteroids for at least three 
days and/or a need for an emergency visit, hospitalization or death due to asthma.  In line with the 
CHMP guidelines, an increase of the maintenance dose of oral corticosteroids for at least three days 
should be a part of the definition for severe exacerbations. It was clarified that the data for these 
patients were also captured. 
The definition of mild exacerbation is not well established and it is not recommended by the CHMP 
guidelines. Therefore, the data on mild exacerbations are considered as supportive only.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics
3092 patients were randomized to study 2302 to receive high dose of QVM149 (619 patients), medium 
dose of QVM149 (620 patients), high dose of QMF149 (618 patients), medium dose of QMF149 (617 
patients), or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d (618 patients).
The mean age of randomised patients was 52.2 years. Only 18.4% of the randomized patients were 
aged 65 years or older. The majority of enrolled patients were Caucasian (74.0%) or Asian (21.7%) 
and there were more females (62.0%).
This pivotal study enrolled patients with uncontrolled asthma with the baseline mean ACQ-7 score of 
2.51.  The majority of patients (>78%) had never smoked. As required by the trial protocol all patients 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 107/142
must have at least one exacerbation in the previous year. Most patients (80%) had one exacerbation, 
16% had 2 exacerbations in the previous year. 
The majority of enrolled patients (62.6%) received medium dose ICS/LABA at baseline whereas 36.7% 
received high dose ICS/LABA. 
During the study, other concomitant asthma medications were used by up to 47.2% of patients. These 
included oral corticosteroids (up to 25.9% of patients) followed by leukotriene modifiers (up to 16.9% 
patients) and antibiotics (up to 13.8%). The applicant was requested to discuss in what percentage 
these medications were used outside of treatment of acute exacerbation (e.g. used chronically) and 
discuss how the use of these medications influenced the study results. The responses provided by the 
applicant were considered satisfactory. 
Results of the study endpoints 
The primary efficacy objective of the study was met, with both high and medium doses of QVM149 
demonstrating superiority over the respective doses of QMF149. At Week 26, the LS mean treatment 
difference for trough FEV1 was 0.065 L (95% CI 0.027 to 0.103, adjusted p=0.002) for QVM149 
150/50/160 μg o.d. versus QMF149 150/320 μg o.d. and 0.074 L (95% CI 0.036 to 0.112, adjusted 
p<0.001) for QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. versus QMF149 150/160 μg o.d. These treatment differences 
were statistically significant. Sensitivity analysis results supported the primary analysis results. The 
minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in FEV1 has not been rigorously established for asthma, 
but it is likely that changes of 100–200 mL in FEV1 are clinically important.  However, MCID for 
improvements in trough FEV1 in patients already receiving medium or high dose LABA/ICS could be 
lower as patients already receiving bronchodilator may have less room for lung function improvement.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the reported improvements in lung function was not large but on 
balance and could be considered as borderline clinically relevant in comparison to the results reported 
for other medicinal products.
In line with the asthma guideline (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1), however measurement of lung function 
parameters alone is considered to be insufficient in the assessment of therapeutic effect and lung 
function should be measured either as a co-primary or a key secondary endpoint. The applicant 
selected changes in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-7 after 26 weeks of treatment as a key 
secondary endpoint. 
This key secondary objective was not met. There was no meaningful difference in the LS mean ACQ-7 
score at Week 26 for high and medium doses of QVM149 versus the respective doses of QMF149. 
There were also no statistically significant differences in the ACQ-7 responder rate between treatment 
groups at week 26. 
Results of the other secondary endpoints which investigated changes in lung function, in general 
support the results of the primary endpoint. QVM149 demonstrated improvement as compared to the 
corresponding QMF149 doses in trough FEV1(by visit), pre-dose, FVC as well as peak expiratory flow, 
although the difference between these treatment groups for PEF at week 26 was below the MCID 
(defined as 25 L/min).
In relation to ACQ-7 responder rate, at Week 26, there were no meaningful differences in the 
proportion of patients achieving the MCID between any of the treatment groups. 
Exacerbations
50% of patients experienced any exacerbation at 52 weeks and less than 40% of patients experienced 
moderate to severe exacerbation. Therefore, the annualized rate of exacerbations reported in all 
treatment groups was small in absolute terms.
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 108/142
For both moderate and severe or severe exacerbations for both strengths of QVM149 there was a trend 
toward a reduction in exacerbations.
The  best  results  were  reported  for  the  higher  dose  of  QVM149  (150/50/160μg)  for  the  reduction  of 
severe exacerbation as in this case 22% reduction in the rate of exacerbations (which is considered as 
clinically relevant) almost reached a statistical significance – rate ratio 0.78 (95% CI 0.61,1.00 p =0.05)
There were no statistically significant differences in the annualized rate of exacerbations between the 
QVM149 groups as compared to the QMF149 groups for moderate or severe exacerbations. The Cox 
regression analysis of time to first asthma exacerbation showed that there was no difference between 
the QVM149 doses versus QMF149 doses in reducing the risk of asthma exacerbations (moderate or 
severe, severe, and all). 
Comparisons with salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 μg 
An additional secondary comparison was performed on QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. and QVM149 
150/50/160 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1 compared with salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 
50/500 μg b.i.d. via Accuhaler.
It is agreed that the data on the efficacy as compared to this authorised product are important 
however the comparison of Enerzair/Zimbus to the authorised ICS /LABA comparator (salmeterol 
xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d. via Accuhaler) cannot be accepted as pivotal as this 
was not included in confirmatory testing strategy.
In general, QVM149 was more efficacious as compared to salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 
50/500 μg than as compared to QMF149 and the observed differences between QVM149 and 
salmeterol/fluticasone were both statistically significant and clinically relevant.
At Week 26, the LS mean treatment difference for trough FEV1 was 119 ml (95% CI 81 to 157 ml, 
p<0.001) for QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. versus salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 
μg b.i.d. and 98ml (95% CI 60 to 136 ml, p<0.001) for QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. versus salmeterol 
xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d.
In comparison to salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg, the high and medium QVM149 dose improved 
morning and evening PEF and the observed differences are considered to be clinically relevant.
For the high QVM149 dose versus salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg comparison more responders were 
seen in the QVM149 group at week 4 and 12 however there was no statistically significant differences 
at week 26 between these groups.  
A statistically significant difference in the rate of exacerbations was reported for the higher dose 
(QVM149 150/50/160) as compared to salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500. Again, the clinical interpretation 
of these results is challenging as it cannot be definitely concluded which component of the combination 
contributed to these positive results.  A 36% relative reduction (rate ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.52, 0.78 ) 
was reported for moderate to severe exacerbations and 42% relative reduction (rate ratio 0.58, 95% 
CI 0.45 to 0.73) was reported for severe exacerbations in QVM149 150/50/160 versus 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 b.i.d comparison and these differences could be considered as clinically 
relevant.  
The medium dose QVM149 showed a reduction in moderate to severe exacerbations of 19% 
(p=0.041) vs. salmeterol/fluticasone and a favorable trend to reduction in severe exacerbations of 
16% (p=0.117).
However, it needs to be noted that the doses of corticosteroid were not equivalent between QVM149 
150/50/80ug and salmeterol/fluticasone i.e. the dose of ICS was higher in salmeterol/fluticasone 
combination than in QVM149 150/50/80ug and could have impacted the results.

Summary 
Major Objection related to the magnitude of the effect, the robustness of the efficacy demonstrated for 
the lower strength (medium dose) and to a lesser extent the higher strength were raised during the 
procedure. An oral Explanation took place in March 2020 at CHMP. 
Following the Oral Explanation, the CHMP by majority agreed that an additional benefit was 
demonstrated for the higher strength when glycopyrronium was added to QMF149 (dual, 
mometasone/indacaterol combination), therefore only this strength is considered approvable. 
For QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. versus QMF149 150/320 μg o.d. comparison there was an 
improvement in lung function and there was a reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations. At Week 
26, the LS mean treatment difference for trough FEV1 was 0.065 L (95% CI 0.027 to 0.103, adjusted 
p=0.002). At week 52, 22% reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations was reported with the rate 
ratio 0.78 (95% CI 0.61,1.00 p =0.05). This reduction in the severe exacerbations rate can be 
considered as clinically relevant. For the higher strength further supporting evidence comes from the 
comparison with salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500. A statistically significant difference in the rate of 
exacerbations was reported for the higher dose (QVM149 150/50/160) as compared to 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500. A 36% relative reduction (rate ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.52, 0.78) was 
reported for moderate to severe exacerbations and 42% relative reduction (rate ratio 0.58, 95% CI 
0.45 to 0.73) was reported for severe exacerbations in QVM149 150/50/160 versus 
salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 b.i.d comparison and these differences are considered as clinically 
relevant. 
The efficacy data are less pronounced for QVM149 medium dose. The CHMP considered that for the 
QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. versus QMF149 150/160 μg o.d.  comparison, statistical significance was 
not reached for any exacerbation related endpoint. In addition, QVM149 medium dose was not 
compared to the medium dose of salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (although 19 % reduction 
in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was seen in comparison to the high dose salmeterol 
xinafoate/fluticasone propionate).
The lower strength is therefore not considered approvable as efficacy is not satisfactorily 
demonstrated. The Applicant agreed to withdraw its application for the lower strength after the Oral 
Explanation. 
Proposed indication
For Enerzair Breezhaler the following indications was proposed by the applicant:
Enerzair Breezhaler is indicated as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adults not adequately 
controlled with a maintenance combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and a medium or high dose 
of an inhaled corticosteroid, and who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous 
year. 
As only the higher strength is recommended for approval, the indication was amended to patients on 
high dose ICS in line with the data provided and also in keeping with stepwise treatment approach. It 
is detailed below:
Enerzair Breezhaler is indicated as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adults not adequately 
controlled with a maintenance combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and high dose of an inhaled 
corticosteroid, and who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year. 
User of an electronic sensor device and app 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 110/142
The applicant proposed to include the option of a sensor device in the package containing Enerzair 
Breezhaler (QVM149) to be used via bluetooth with compatible software. The aim would be to to 
improve treatment adherence. 
The CHMP is supportive of efforts to improve adherence to treatment in patients. However no data on 
the use of the sensor device in the target population has been presented in the application. 
The use of such a device when administering the Enerzair Breezhaler may be included in the SmPC 
provided therapeutic equivalence is conclusively demonstrated between the device and Breezhaler and 
Breezhaler alone. The applicant has provided evidence that testing has been performed to confirm the 
sensor device and app do not impact on drug delivery or robustness of the inhaler which is acceptable. 
However, it should be demonstrated that the device has been fully user tested by the full range of 
patients in the intended treatment population without any issues to allow specific information to be 
included in section 4.2. 
The inclusion of information on the sensor device in the QVM149 package is only described in the 
SmPC as an optional feature for patients and in the Package Leaflet.
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy
Although the effects on lung function and exacerbations are considered modest, the CHMP overall 
considered that there is favourable clinical effect demonstrated for the higher strength in this severe 
asthma population.
2.5.5.  Clinical safety
Patient exposure
For the pivotal study, the analysis includes 26-week data for all patients (except for patients who 
discontinued prior to Week 26), plus a variable exposure period in a subset of patients between 26 and 
52 weeks. Duration of exposure is the number of days on study drug, starting from the day of initiation 
of randomized study medication up to and inclusive the day of last dose.
Table 33 Exposure to double-blind study treatment (Safety set)
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 111/142
The mean number of days of exposure was between 311 and 316 days across the 5 treatment groups. 
The proportion of patients with exposure of > 365 days was 36.7% to 40.0% across the 5 treatment 
groups. In addition, the patients who completed 1year treatment were included in the exposure 
category of 255 to 365 days because some of patients visited the clinic to perform the end of study 
completion visit at Week 52, few days early. 60.9% patients (n=1884, approximately 370 
patients/group) completed the 52 weeks of study treatment.
Overall, the total study treatment exposure in CSR I is 2644 patient-years (PY), which is 85% of the 
total expected exposure at study completion. The total expected exposure (3092 PY) is based on the 
assumption that all randomized patients would complete the 52 weeks of treatment. Overall exposure 
with the study drugs, at data lock point 27th October 2018, is summarized in Table 12-1.
CSR II exposure data dated 16th September 2019
Disposition
The total number of patients randomized remains unchanged at 3092, since all patients had been 
randomized at the time of data cut-off for CSR I. Overall, 10.4% of patients prematurely discontinued 
double-blind study treatment in CSR II, which is consistent with that observed in CSR I (9.8%). The 
most common reasons for discontinuation of double-blind treatment were the same for both CSR I and 
CSR II (subject/guardian decision, adverse event and physician’s decision). The mean exposure ranged 
from 340.2 to 246.2 across treatment group and the median exposure (day) was 366 days in all 
treatment groups.
Duration of treatment
CSR II includes all patients who have completed a 52 week treatment period, plus a 30 day follow-up 
or who have prematurely discontinued from the study.
Extent of exposure
For CSR II, all patients have completed the planned 52 weeks treatment (or prematurely 
discontinued). A summary of the overall number of patients exposed and the duration of exposure is 
presented in Table 12.1 below. Duration of exposure is the number of days on study drug, starting 
from the day of initiation of randomized study medication up to and inclusive the day of last dose.
Patient exposure
The mean number of days of exposure was between 340 and 346 days across treatment groups. The 
median number of days of exposure was 366 days across treatment groups. The proportion of patients 
with exposure of > 365 days was 53.2% to 56.0% across the 5 treatment groups. In addition, some of 
the patients who completed 52 weeks of treatment were included in the exposure category of 255 to 
365 days because some of the patients visited the clinic to perform the end of study completion visit at 
Week 52, a few days early.

The exposure and total patient years are overall balanced between the 5 arms. 
The applicant presents the safety data as either an occurrence rate (OccR) in 100 patient years in the 
Summary of Clinical Safety (SCS) report and/or as an incidence rate (IR) per 100 patient years in CSR 
for the pivotal study QVM2302 taking into account the variable exposure period. This method 
(occurrence rate calculated with episode by 100 PY) accounted for the length of follow-up time under 
the assumption that events occurred with the same frequency at any point in time. The applicant 
justifies this method because the study was ongoing at the time of CSR data lock point and the 
duration of exposure varied among patients. For the safety database, the number of episodes per 100 
patient-years were calculated as 100*(the total number of AE episodes from all patients in the 
population divided by the total number of patient-years). Total patient-years were computed as (the 
sum of the duration of exposure over patients, in days)/365.25
Adverse events
The exposure period was variable between the 5 groups therefore the applicant presents AEs in tables 
by incidence rate (IR). For each treatment group, patient years of exposure were calculated as the 
sum of the number of days on study drug for all patients in the group divided by 365.25.
At Visit 1 (Screening), all patients were issued an electronic diary to record asthma symptoms.
The following types of AEs were analysed:
•
•

All recorded AEs
SAEs
AEs leading to permanent drug discontinuation
AEs of special interest adjudicated events (i.e., deaths, serious asthma outcomes, serious CCV

a)
b)
c)

e)
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders
infections and infestations
gastrointestinal disorders
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders
nervous system disorders
The Incidence rate of AEs in respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, and infections and 
infestations SOCs were comparable in the QVM149 dose groups versus QMF149 dose groups; however, 
they were lower compared to salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d.
The applicant presented adverse events by primary system organ class (Table 35) and preferred term 
(Table 12.3). 
The majority of AEs were mild to moderate in severity and their occurrence was similar between the 
treatment groups. The occurrence rates of severe AEs (episodes in 100 PY) were lower in the QVM149 
pooled group compared to the QMF149 pooled group (OccR 45.2 vs 51.9 in 100 PY). The occurrence 
rate of severe AEs in the QVM149 high dose group is lower than that in the control group (OccR 39.9 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 114/142
vs 63.1 in 100 PY). The most commonly observed SOCs with severe AEs were respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders, infections and infestations disorders, and cardiac disorders.
Asthma exacerbations occurred less frequently in the two triple combination doses compared to the 
two double doses; [IR 52.9 v 53.2 and 55.2 v 62.3]. This is in contrast to the AE’s dysphonia and 
cough which were more frequent in the triple combinations. Known AEs associated with these IMPs 
such as nasopharyngitis and bronchitis were comparable across the 5 groups. There were no dose 
differences with regard to the ICS doses (medium dose vs high dose) of QVM149 groups for the events 
of pneumonia and oral candidiasis. 
In terms of respiratory tracts infections, the applicant presents them across 5 PTs: upper respiratory 
tract infection (URTI), viral URTI, bacterial UTRI, respiratory tract infection and lower respiratory tract 
infections (LRTI). Pneumonia specifically is not listed. The highest IR of LRTI occurred in the control 
group. 
There was a trend for more cardiac disorders occurring in both triple QVM groups compared to both 
double QMF doses and the control arms (Table 12.2). However, these events were low and cardiac AEs 
by Preferred Terms were not listed as the most frequently observed AEs in Table 12-3.
Overall, adverse events considered to be study drug related by the investigator were quite low across 
treatment groups. Dysphonia is reported as the most common AE suspected to be drug related 
(investigator reported) across all 5 groups with the highest IR in the QVM high dose group (Table 
12.4). Suspected drug related asthma exacerbations were low across the 5 groups with the highest IR 
in the control group. 
In relation to the selection of ADRs the applicant states that “the remaining pre-qualified ADR 
candidates were not considered ADRs of QVM149 at this time due to lack of adequate statistical or 
medical evidence of causality in the current pivotal trials in asthma.”

Table 35 Adverse events of special interest by risk category (Safety set)
Cardiac or cerebrovascular events as an AESI in Table 33 occurred more frequently in the 4 QVM/QMF 
inhaler groups compared to the control with the highest IR in the high dose triple QVM inhaler. The 
types of specific CCV events that occurred varied amongst the 4 QVM/QMF inhalers with no discernible 
pattern due to low numbers of events recorded.
Hypersensitivity – The applicant explains the high rates of hypersensitivity as an AESI was due to the 
inclusion of asthma exacerbations and allergic rhinitis excluding theses as PTs, the IR were much lower 
< 1.7/100 PY. There was a lower IR in the QVM149 and QMF149 groups (IR: 0.2 to 0.6/100 PY) for 
urticaria compared to the salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. group (IR 1.7/100 PY). Angioedema 
was reported in 2 patients (IR: 0.4/100 PY) and 1 patient (IR: 0.2/100 PY) in the high QMF149 dose 
and the salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. groups, respectively. No anaphylactic reaction was 
reported in any of the 5 treatment groups.
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 116/142
Immunosuppression – Events that would be considered as related to steroid use were included in this 
category. Bronchitis constituted the majority of cases and given that this is a common AE seen in 
patients with asthma, the applicant has justified the high rates of immunosuppression evident as an 
AESI amongst all 5 treatment groups.
Hospitalisation and intubation due to asthma exacerbation – the group with the highest IRs of hospital 
presentations was in the medium dose triple inhaler QVM149 group compared to the double inhaler 
medium dose and the control groups. 1 intubation was required in this triple medium dose QVM group 
and no asthma-related death was reported in this study. The applicant does not provide further 
discussion in relation to these results. A similar pattern is seen in the adjudicated serious asthma 
outcomes. 
Hyperglycaemia – Table 12-10 the incidence of diabetes mellitus/hyperglycaemia, in the high QVM149 
and QMF149 dose groups (IR 2.1 and 2.5/100 PY) was higher than that in the medium QVM149 and 
QMF149 dose groups (IR 1.1 and 1.9/100 PY). This is in contrast to the AEs presented in Table 14.3.1-
1.10 whereby diabetes mellitus and hyperglycaemia are reported less frequently amongst all treatment 
groups. The exclusion criteria did not allow enrolment of patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus or 
uncontrolled Type 2 DM. 
Hypokalemia -  No decrease from baseline of serum potassium value in mean and median were 
observed in any treatment group. In addition, the notable low potassium value (< 3.0 mmol/L) was 
reported only in the control arm. However, there were handling issues with the hyperkalaemic results.
There were no discernible trends seen relating to steroid effects on the bone mineral density (BMD) in 
relation to the triple inhaler however there was a slight trend for bone fractures in the double inhaler 
compared to salmeterol/fluticasone.
Serious adverse events and deaths
The most frequently reported SAEs (IR > 2.5/100 PY) were related to the respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders, and infections and infestations SOCs. Asthma (exacerbation) was the most 
frequently occurring SAEs (by preferred term), with no trends observed across the treatment groups 
(Table 12-8). Other SAEs (reported in at least 3 patients in any group) were pneumonia, cholelithiasis, 
pulmonary embolism and lower respiratory tract infection.
Overall, the SAEs that occurred in the triple QVM both groups were comparable to the other groups. 
The triple QVM medium dose and the double QMF high dose had the most asthma SAEs. The 3 cases of 
cholelithiasis that occurred in the triple QVM high dose were classified as serious. The group with the 
highest rate of pneumonia was in the control group, 5 episodes. In addition, there was no dose 
dependency in pneumonia in the high and medium dose of QVM149 groups.

Page 117/142
Table 12-11 details the adjudicated serious asthma outcomes assessed by an independent adjudication 
committee. The group with the most asthma related hospitalisations was the medium dose QVM149 
group [IR 2.5] of which 1 patient required intubation. There were no asthma-related deaths reported. 
Rate ratio and rate difference for adjudicated serious asthma outcomes are presented comparing QVM 
and QMF pooled doses, medium doses and high doses. Compared to the control and QMF149 medium 
dose, the group with the highest occurrence rate was the medium dose QVM149 triple inhaler [OccR 
2.8 versus 1.3 in the control arm and 1.5 in QMF medium dose double inhaler]. Comparing both high 
dose QVM & QMF inhalers, the opposite was evident with higher OccR in the double inhaler compared 
to the triple [OccR 2.6 v 1.5].

Table 37 Serious cardio- or cerebrovascular (CCV) adverse events adjudicated by MACE 
outcome (Safety set)
Serious cardio or cerebrovascular adverse events were adjudicated by an independent committee (see 
above table). 
The applicant defines MACE as coronary revascularisation (CABG or PCI), heart failure requiring 
hospitalisation along with the standard MACE non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke. 
These additional cardiovascular outcomes or composite “MACE-plus” endpoint have now been justified 
by the applicant. 
In terms of serious cardiovascular events including MACE, Table 12-12 details the events by treatment 
group and the corresponding forest plot presents the key cardiovascular risks as exposure adjusted 
occurrence rates in the asthma safety database. There is a trend for more serious CCV events in both 
medium & high dose double inhaler QMF compared to the control arm [IR 2.3 v 0.6] in Table 12-12. 
The forest plot demonstrates that atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction as key risks favours QVM 
at both doses compared to the double inhalers. However for ischaemic heart disease, there is trend 
favouring QMF medium dose. 
The majority of patients with adjudicated serious MACE had underlying confounding factors which could 
have potentially contributed to the CV events, however, there appears to be an imbalance trend 
occurring in both QMF149 treated groups compared to the control arm. Compared to both double 
inhaler doses, there were less patients in both triple doses with an adjudicated serious CCV AE and 
non-MACE. 
An independent adjudication committee determined the causes of death. 7 deaths occurred during the 
study and including 30 days post treatment; all were considered unrelated to the study drugs. No 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 119/142
deaths occurred in the control arm. 2 deaths were due to an accident and lymphoma each. The 
remaining 5 deaths were adjudicated as sudden/cardiovascular deaths and occurred in the both QVM 
doses and QMF high dose. 2/5 sudden/cardiovascular deaths had an autopsy performed as they 
presented to hospital unwell. The autopsies confirmed ruptured aortic dissection De Bakey Type I and 
cardiac tamponade respectively. All 5 sudden/cardiovascular deaths occurred in patients >60 years. 
Upon review of the death narratives, no autopsy was performed in 3 of the cardiac related deaths, all 3 
occurred at home and therefore the exact cause of death cannot be established. 
Table 38 Death by adjudicated primary cause (Safety set)
Taking the above into account, the deaths that were considered cardiovascular events are not captured 
in Table 12-2 as part of the definition of MACE. 
Laboratory findings
The EMA guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of asthma states 
that: the assessment of the systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids should include an appropriate 
sensitive measure of hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis function and the preferred 
pharmacodynamic method of assessing the HPA axis is the repeated assessment of the change from 
baseline in 24-hour plasma cortisol. Systemic effects of corticosteroids on bone mineral density and 
the eyes should also be assessed. The clinical assessment of systemic effects should be carried out at 
steady state.
Evening plasma cortisol levels were performed 20 minutes prior to administration of the inhaler in the 
evening at baseline visit 201, week 26 visit 207 and week 52 study completion visit 214, day 1 & day 
2.
Analysis of laboratory tests, including plasma cortisol, did not show any of patterns or trends across 
the QVM149 and QMF149 treatment groups. Based on the results presented, there does not appear to 
be any evidence of adrenal suppression. However, it is acknowledged that study duration was 52 
weeks and ths the long term effects on HPA axis, a known steroid side effect, may not be fully 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 120/142
characterised especially for the high dose QMF149. The applicant subsequently updated the SmPC 
highlighting the systemic effects of corticosteroids.
The changes in QTc values in the QVM high dose group are too low to conclude a safety issue. 
Section 4.5 of the proposed SmPC states that: “Clinically relevant prolongations of the QTc interval 
have not been observed in clinical studies of Enerzair Breezhaler at recommended therapeutic doses.” 
which is acceptable. 
Hyperglycaemia or increased blood glucose as an AE occurred in low numbers between the 5 treatment 
groups. Hyperglycaemia is a known side effect of corticosteroid use and is adequately characterised in 
section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC.
Safety in special populations
The clinical pharmacology program for QVM149 was based on data from the authorized individual 
components. The results of the component interaction study CQVM149B2102 and the population PK 
analyses [QVM149B-PopPK-Report] showed comparable systemic exposure between QVM149 
components and corresponding monotherapy products. These data support extrapolation of dosing 
recommendations in special populations, such as patients with renal or hepatic impairment from 
authorized monotherapies to QVM149.
No specific studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment were performed. However, data from 
the authorised individual components are available and a population PK analysis is presented in the 
application. 
In relation to the elderly, there was a higher occurrence rate of any CCV events for the subgroup of 
patients ≥ 65 years compared to the subgroup of patients 18-64 years in the pivotal study QVM2302 
for all 4 IMPS in contrast to the comparable control arms.
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 121/142
QVM149 pooled high and medium dose group: OccR 11.6 versus 3.5 in 100 PY
QMF149 pooled high and medium dose group: OccR 13.1 versus 3.6 in 100 PY
Salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. group: OccR 3.8 versus 2.8 in 100 PY
However, for each age category the occurrence rate was lower in the QVM149 pooled high and medium 
dose group than for the QMF149 pooled high and medium dose group.
Cardiac disorders as both an AE and an AESI adjusted for exposure by age also demonstrated this 
imbalance whereby there are more cardiac disorders occurring as an adverse event in all 4 IMP arms 
compared to the placebo for the elderly population especially in both QVM and QMF high dose groups; 
OccR 14.9 in QVM high dose, OccR 17.5 in QMF high dose versus OccR 6.6 in the control arm.
Focussing on CCV events, there is a trend for higher occurrences adverse events of special interest in 
all 4 QVM/QMF arms in the elderly>65 years compared to the control arm. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
No specific interaction studies were conducted with QVM149. Information on the potential for 
interactions is based on the potential for each of the monotherapy components. This approach is 
acceptable. Section 4.5 of the SmPC captures the main potential interactions with other medicinal 
products. 
Clinically significant drug interactions mediated by QVM149 at clinical doses are considered unlikely 
due to the low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing.
Concomitant administration of orally inhaled indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone furoate 
under steady-state conditions did not affect the pharmacokinetics of any of the active substances.
Discontinuation due to AES
The incidence of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug adjusted for exposure by 
preferred term, with an occurrence rate of at least 0.4 episodes in 100 patient years in any treatment 
group are summarized in Table 2-9.
The most common AE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was asthma (exacerbation) 
with similar distribution across the treatment groups.
Table 39 Adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug adjusted for 
exposure by preferred term, with an occurrence rate of at least 0.4 episodes in 100 patient 
years in any treatment group (Asthma S-db)
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 122/142
The main cause of discontinuation is asthma, where the rate is lower in both triple combination QVM 
groups compared to the corresponding double QMF combination groups and control.
Overall between the 5 groups the numbers of patients leading to permanent discontinuation due to 
adverse events including asthma exacerbations were low. The group with the highest number of 
patients discontinuing was the medium dose triple combination QVM group [IR 4.3 versus IR 4.2 in the 
control group and IR 3.6 in the medium dose double combination QMF group].
The complete table is presented in the SCS appendix Table 2.1.4-2QVMS. Cardiac disorders as a SOC, 
the numbers were low with no obvious trend. The highest discontinuation rates were in the two QMF 
double inhaler doses, both 3 episodes each and OccR of 0.6.

2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical safety
At the time of submission, the pivotal study 2302 was still ongoing but has now completed with a 
global end of trial declaration circulated to regulatory authorities on the 18th July 2019. The last 
subject last visit in all participating countries occurred on 14th June 2019. With the response dossier, 
the applicant discusses the safety findings from the now completed 52 week’s pivotal study, 
(QVM2302) CSR II dated 16th September 2019. A “Summary of changes” document for CSR I and CSR 
II dated 21st August has also been provided with statistical outputs of CSR II in the appendix. 
The 3 active substances are already authorised in the EU either as monotherapies or as fixed dose 
combinations for COPD mainly.  Glycopyrronium has not been approved for asthma to date and 
indacaterol was approved in March 2020 by CHMP as part of a FDC (Atectura). Tiotropium is the 
currently the only approved LAMA for the treatment of asthma.
Exposure
The focus of the safety data presented and analysed by the applicant is from the pivotal study 
QVM2302. While the data analysis was performed after 26 weeks of treatment as per the primary 
endpoint, 60.9% of the patients had completed the 52 weeks of study treatment. Overall, the total 
study treatment exposure in CSR I was 2644 patient-years at the time of submission, which is 85% of 
the total expected exposure at study completion.  Additional data from CSR II did not highlight any 
additional safety concerns
Demographics
The majority of the participants were aged between 18-64 years >80% with approximately >60% of 
female participants across all 5 arms. While the arms appear well balanced, less elderly patients were 
represented overall. The number of patients who were ≥65 years on QVM149 across 7 studies was 
more than 700 patients and aligned with ICH E7 – Note for guidance on studies in support of special 
populations: geriatrics. While the population PK analysis did not demonstrate an age effect, the 
applicant was requested to discuss whether the SmPC should reflect the lower number of elderly 
participants represented in the pivotal study. In conclusion, it is agreed that no dose adjustment is 
required for the elderly population. 
There is also a clear underrepresentation of particular races across the board, namely black race 
(African American & Caribbean not specified) with no Hispanics at all. The applicant was requested to 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 123/142
discuss this further given the established poorer outcomes for the black population. The applicant 
provided an adequate response and no dose adjustments are implemented. 
Disease characteristics were mainly well balanced between the 5 groups with the majority of 
participants being never smokers and having 1 asthma exacerbation in the 12 months prior to start of 
study. More than 60% of participants had received LABA/ICS medium dose as their prior asthma 
treatment. The applicant also presented cardiovascular risk factors based on the presence of selected 
diseases (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2, age 
≥ 65 years and former smoker) at baseline. The majority of patients had 1-2 CV risk factors at 
baseline (46-49%), 35%-38% with hypertension and 30-35% had a BMI >30kg/m2.
Adverse Events
Known AEs associated with the 3 active substances such as nasopharyngitis, bronchitis and headache 
were comparable across the 5 groups. The AE’s dysphonia and cough were more frequent in the triple 
combination groups and this is implemented in the SmPC section 4.8 accordingly. Dysphonia is the 
most common AE suspected to be drug related (investigator reported) across all 5 groups with the 
highest IR in the QVM high dose group. Suspected drug related asthma exacerbations were low across 
the 5 groups with the highest incidence rate in the control group. 
As expected from the pharmacological profile of QVM149, symptoms compatible with either the beta-
adrenergic or anticholinergic effect such as urinary retention and CCV events have been observed, but 
in general the event rates were low and most of them are not listed in the most frequently occurring 
AE table by PT.
The main cause of treatment discontinuation was due to asthma exacerbation, where the rate is lower 
in both triple combination QVM groups compared to the corresponding double QMF combination groups 
and control. Overall between the 5 groups the numbers of patients leading to permanent 
discontinuation due to any adverse events including asthma exacerbations were low. 
A limitation of the AEs presented is the lack of discussion by the applicant in relation to the duration 
and reversibility of the AEs. Moreover, the applicant does not specifically address how the AEs have 
impacted the patient’s quality of life. The applicant provided an acceptable response to these issues 
raised by CHMP. Overall the mean duration of the five most common AEs was comparable across the 
groups and the majority of patients recovered.
Serious Adverse Events
Overall, the SAEs that occurred in both triple QVM groups were comparable to the other groups. The 
triple QVM medium dose and the double QMF high dose had the most asthma exacerbations as SAEs 
but the incidence rates are too low to conclude. The group with the highest rate of pneumonia was in 
the control group (5 episodes). In addition, there was no dose dependency in pneumonia in the high 
and medium dose of QVM149 groups. 
Referring to the Article 31 EMA/330021/2016 concluded in 2016 in relation to the risk of pneumonia 
with inhaled steroids in patients with COPD, the submitted data does not imply a trend for an increased 
risk of pneumonia in the asthma population. 
Among the SAEs considered to be drug related (SADRs), drug hypersensitivity was the only SADR that 
occurred once in the high dose QVM group and was categorised as life threatening.
Upon request of CHMP, a discussion on the duration, recovery and/or reversibility of the adverse 
events or the serious adverse events was provided, which allowed complete assessment of the events.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 124/142
According to the EMA guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of 
asthma, the assessment of the systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids should include an appropriate 
sensitive measure of hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis function (repeated assessment 
of the change from baseline in 24-hour plasma cortisol). Systemic effects of corticosteroids on bone 
mineral density and the eyes should also be assessed and at steady state.
The applicant performed evening plasma cortisol levels 20 minutes prior to administration of the 
inhaler in the evening at baseline visit 201, week 26 visit 207 and week 52 study completion visit 214, 
day 1 & day 2.
There were no discernible trends seen relating to steroid effects on the bone mineral density (BMD) 
(defined as osteoporosis and osteopenia) however the applicant did not provide details of how exactly 
BMD was assessed for example if DEXA scanning was performed and at what intervals. Upon review of 
the responses, objective measures such as DEXA scanning were not performed to assess BMD. 
Reduced BMD was identified as an AESI only. The applicant subsequently inserted the steroid effects in 
the SmPC which includes reduced BMD and will monitor for bone fractures in the PSUR since long term 
safety is needed to assess these effects.
Analysis of laboratory tests, including plasma cortisol, did not show any of patterns or trends across 
the QVM149 and QMF149 treatment groups, therefore no evidence of adrenal suppression is observed. 
Nevertheless, in relation to safety, the potential for higher mometasone exposure from Concept1 
discussed in the clinical pharmacology section could limit the ability to extrapolate from the safety data 
from authorised mometasone formulations. This was raised by CHMP and upon review, no safety 
concerns regarding the higher exposures using the newer device could be observed. 
No newly occurring or worsening clinically notable QTc prolongation were observed. However, the 
changes in QTc values in the QVM high dose group are too low to conclude a safety issue. Section 4.5 
of the agreed SmPC states that: 
“Enerzair Breezhaler, like other medicinal products containing a beta2-adrenergic agonist, should be 
administered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic 
antidepressants, or medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval, as any effect of these on the 
QT interval may be potentiated. Medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval may increase the 
risk of ventricular arrhythmia (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).”
As previously discussed in the clinical pharmacology section, a TQT study CQVA149A2109 was 
submitted in this application. This study is also part of the Ultibro (QVA149) dossier and it’s findings 
have been reported during Ultibro’s PSURs. For consistency with the Ultibro Breezhaler SmPC, CHMP 
agreed not to include further details on study CQVA149A2109 as part of the Enerzair Breezhaler SmPC 
and to reflect information as follows in the SmPC: 
Section 4.4 
Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) or LABA-containing combination products such as 
Enerzair Breezhaler should therefore be used with caution in patients with known or suspected 
prolongation of the QT interval or who are being treated with medicinal products affecting the QT 
interval.
Section 5.1 
QTc interval
The effect of Enerzair Breezhaler on the QTc interval has not been evaluated in a thorough QT (TQT) 
study. For mometasone furoate, no QTc prolonging properties are known.
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 125/142
The deaths that occurred on QVM149 and QMF149 were not suspected by the investigators to be 
related to the study drug. None of these patients had any abnormal QTc findings during the duration of 
the study. Moreover, the QTc risk for QAB149 (Indacaterol) and NVA237 (Glycopyrronium) have 
already been characterised by dedicated QTc monitoring studies (CQAB149B2339 and 
CNVA237A2110), which did not show evidence of meaningful QTc prolongation. Therefore, the absence 
of a TQT study is accepted in view of the risk considered well characterised and addressed adequately 
in the SmPC. 
Respiratory Adverse Events
Suspected drug related asthma exacerbations as an adverse effect (by the investigator) were low 
across the 5 groups with the highest IR in the control group. Asthma exacerbations occurred less 
frequently in the two triple combination doses compared to the two double combination doses. This is 
in contrast to the AE’s dysphonia and cough which were more frequent in the triple combinations. 
Known AEs associated with these active substances such as nasopharyngitis and bronchitis were 
comparable across the 5 groups. There were no dose differences in term of frequency with regards to 
the ICS doses (medium dose vs high dose) of QVM149 groups for the events of pneumonia and oral 
candidiasis.
In terms of respiratory tracts infections, the applicant presents them across 5 PTs: upper respiratory 
tract infection (URTI), viral URTI, bacterial UTRI, respiratory tract infection and lower respiratory tract 
infections (LRTI). Pneumonia specifically is not listed. The highest IR of LRTI occurred in the control 
group.
Asthma exacerbations as an adverse event occurred less frequently in the triple combination inhalers 
compared to the corresponding double combination inhaler and the S/F control arm. However, when 
reported as an SAE, there was a trend for more exacerbations in the QVM medium dose and QMF high 
dose compared to the control. These results are limited by low numbers.
Serious asthma outcomes assessed by an independent adjudication committee demonstrated that the 
group with the most asthma related hospitalisations was the medium dose QVM149 group of which one 
patient required intubation. While no asthma-related deaths reported, the applicant was requested to 
discuss this further given that the incidence rate almost doubled compared to the control arm [IR 2.5 v 
IR 1.3].  In summary it is agreed that in light of the small number of events, an increased risk cannot 
be reliably confirmed.
When looking at the rate ratio and rate difference for adjudicated serious asthma outcomes comparing 
QVM and QMF pooled doses, medium doses and high doses to the control and QMF medium dose, the 
group with the highest occurrence rate was the medium dose QVM triple inhaler [OccR 2.8 versus 1.3 
in the control arm and 1.5 in QMF medium dose double inhaler]. 
Comparing both high dose QVM & QMF inhalers, the opposite was evident with higher OccR in the 
double inhaler compared to the triple [OccR 2.6 v 1.5]. No possible mechanistic reason can explain the 
differences and due to small event rates, thus the interpretation of RR and rate differences needs to be 
done with caution. Additionally, the incidence of severe asthma exacerbation was lower in the high and 
medium dose of QVM149 compared to the corresponding doses of QMF149.
Cardiac Events
Cardiovascular risks of LABA and LAMA are an important focus of the safety assessment for the 3 
active components of the fixed dose combination.
A Major Objection was raised on cardiac safety but finally solved as explained below. 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 126/142
There was a trend for more cardiac disorders as an adverse event occurring in both triple QVM groups 
compared to both double QMF doses and the control arms. However, these events were low and 
cardiac AEs by Preferred Terms were not listed as the most frequently observed AEs. Given the known 
cardiac toxicity profile of both the LAMA and LABA, the applicant was requested to provide the 
completed safety data in the final CSR (CSRII).
Two additional MACE cases (1 each in the medium dose QVM149 group and medium dose QMF149 
group) were reported in CSR II (both patients had coronary revascularization and nonfatal myocardial 
infarction). However, the IR of MACE remains low and the difference among the treatment group was 
small. In both cases, the investigator did not suspect a causal relationship of the events to the study 
drug.
Serious cardio- and cerebrovascular (CCV) adverse events (AEs) adjudication into MACE or non-MACE 
events were performed for study QVM149B2302. The blinded adjudication process consisted of a 
review of serious composite CCV events. The types of MACE defined by the applicant in the 
adjudication outcome form were: coronary revascularisation, heart failure requiring hospitalisation, 
non-fatal unstable angina, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke. The exact definition of 
MACE (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke) has not been 
included as an endpoint specifically in the protocol nor has the applicant submitted a dedicated 
cardiovascular safety study despite the risks associated with both the LABA and LAMA as per the 
reflection paper on assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal products. The applicant 
was therefore requested to discuss further in more detail.
In terms of serious cardiovascular events including MACE, there is a trend for more serious CCV events 
in both medium & high dose double inhaler QMF compared to the control arm. Compared to both 
double doses, there were less patients in both triple doses with an adjudicated serious CCV AE and 
non-MACE. The applicant clarified that none of the presented MACE outcomes were considered by the 
reporting investigator to be related to the study treatment. 
Seven deaths occurred during the study including 30days post treatment; all were considered 
unrelated to the study drugs. No deaths occurred in the control arm. Two deaths were due to an 
accident and lymphoma. The remaining 5 deaths were adjudicated as sudden/cardiovascular deaths 
and occurred in the both QVM doses and QMF high dose. Two of these deaths had an autopsy 
performed as they presented to hospital unwell. The autopsies confirmed ruptured aortic dissection De 
Bakey Type I and cardiac tamponade respectively. All 5 sudden/cardiovascular deaths occurred in 
patients above 60 years. Upon review of the death narratives, for which no autopsy was available, all 3 
occurred at home and therefore the exact cause of death cannot be established. No additional deaths 
were observed upon completion of the 52week study and the applicant concludes that there is no 
evidence of increased risk of mortality associated with the triple inhaler QVM149 due to a) causality 
assessment of the 3 deaths b) no deaths occurred in the triple inhaler arm in study 2306 and c) 
current knowledge of CV risks and mortality in the COPD population who are the same age group.
The applicant compares the QVM149 high dose versus the control arm salmeterol/fluticasone of study 
QVM2302 and concludes that the differences in all-cause mortality and CV events were small in 
magnitude and attributable to chance. Additionally, the applicant also presents a comparison between 
the key cardiovascular findings from the pivotal study QVM2302 and the 24 week, QVM2306 study, 
which could further support that the results observed in the pivotal study could be due to chance.
In terms of biological plausibility, the applicant stated that the doses of the LABA and LAMA are the 
same as the authorised inhalers for COPD indications (Seebri, Onbrez and Ultibro) and steroids are not 
traditionally associated with CV risks or CV adverse events in either the COPD or asthma population 
which is acknowledged and accepted. 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 127/142
The applicant presented evidence on LABA class effects in patients with asthma and highlighted that 
given the younger age profile of patients with asthma in clinical trials (compared to COPD), SAEs are 
usually not stratified by CV versus other causes. A meta-analysis of LABA/ICS v ICS published in 2008 
noted that the difference of the 0.03% magnitude was attributable to chance. 
Data provided from 13 clinical asthma trials, did not support the hypothesis that LABAs as a class 
increase all-cause mortality, of note this review didnot include the proposed LABA, indacaterol. The 
applicant also referenced the FDA triggered review of LABA safety in 2017 where the results of 4 large 
RCTs in asthma patients were pooled (Busse et al 2018). No safety signal was reported for all-cause 
asthma related mortality. 
Comparing the 2 QVM149 doses with both QMF149 doses, there was no increased CV risks or all-cause 
mortality attributable to glycopyrronium in the presence of indacaterol and MF.
In conclusion, the higher occurrence rate of CCV events for the subgroup of patients ≥ 65 years 
compared to the subgroup of patients 18-64 years observed in the pivotal study QVM2302, the CHMP 
agreed that this could be attributable to chance and acknowledge low biological plausibility of steroids 
and CV risk. 
CQVM149B2306 is an open label ongoing Phase 3 non-inferiority study which compares the triple QVM 
combination of both doses with a “free” triple arm of salmeterol, fluticasone and tiotropium. Given that 
this is the only study comparing glycopyrronium directly to another LAMA, review of this study is 
essential for a complete safety assessment of this issue and definite conclusions. No patients had a 
MACE event in the 2 QVM149 doses and there were no deaths in this QVM2306 study. No patients had 
a QTC value >500ms and one patient in each IMP arm had an increase from baseline >60ms compared 
to 2 in the sal/flu + tio arm. There appears to be a trend for pneumonia in QVM149 compared to the 
control arm which will need to be further clarified by the applicant. From a cardiac perspective, the 
preliminary results presented are supportive to the result above described from the pivotal studies.
In relation to the CV risks associated with LAMAs in the asthma population specifically, the applicant 
stated that “the biological plausibility of an additive LAMA effect is very low” however this is based on 
data in COPD patients only. While it is acknowledged that the safety of LAMAs in the COPD population 
who are known to have CV risks & comorbidities is established, glycopyrronium has not been approved 
for asthma patients to date. Tiotropium is the only approved LAMA for the treatment of asthma. 
Further clarification was provided  on the LAMA CV risks in the asthmatic population which addressed 
the concerns raised appropriately.
No formal TQT study has been performed for QVM149 specifically. A TQT study CQVA149A2109 was 
submitted and assessed in the clinical pharmacology section of this clinical report. This study is also 
part of the Ultibro (QVA149) dossier and its findings have been reported during Ultibro’s PSURs. 
Overall the data suggest that there may be a small risk for prolongation of the QTc interval at the 
proposed dose of indacaterol in QVM149 (150 µg). 
Hypokalaemia which is a known ADR with LABAs was not listed as an AE in any of the 4 arms tested. 
However, the SmPC adequately reflects this risk in section 4.4.
Hypokalaemia with beta agonists
Beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalaemia in some patients, which has the 
potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually 
transient, not requiring supplementation. In patients with severe asthma, hypokalaemia may be 
potentiated by hypoxia and concomitant treatment, which may increase the susceptibility to cardiac 
arrhythmias (see section 4.5).
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 128/142
Clinically relevant hypokalaemia has not been observed in clinical studies of 
indacaterol/glycopyrronium/mometasone furoate at the recommended therapeutic dose.
No specific studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment were performed. However, data from 
the authorised individual components are available and a population PK analysis is presented in the 
application. This is acceptable by CHMP and the SmPC adequately reflects information for this patient 
population.
2.5.7.  Conclusions on clinical safety
The safety concerns and major objections raised during the assessment have been addressed for the 
high dose. Overall, the clinical safety assessment of QVM149 is now considered comprehensive and 
adequate to support an approval for the higher strength. 
2.6.  Risk Management Plan
Safety concerns
Important identified risks
None
Important potential risks
Serious cardiovascular risks
Missing information
None
Serious cardiovascular events are considered an important potential risk of QVM149 based on the 
mechanism of action of beta2-adrenergic agonists, known or suspected class effects, the serious nature 
of these adverse events, and the potential of new data on these events to impact the benefit-risk 
profile of QVM149 in the future.
This risk includes the following events:
- Ischemic heart disease
- Myocardial infarction 
- Cardiac failure 
- Atrial fibrillation 
- Tachyarrhythmia 
- Cardiac arrhythmias (nonspecific cardiac arrhythmia, conduction abnormalities, ectopies and sudden 
death and sudden cardiac death)
- Cerebrovascular events
Pharmacovigilance plan
Beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection, the routine pharmacovigilance activities 
comprise specific AE follow-up checklists which will be used to collect further data to help further 
characterize and/or closely monitor the serious cardiovascular events using the following checklists:
•

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways associated with airways inflammation and 
hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, 
and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with 
widespread but variable airflow obstruction. Patients with asthma can experience exacerbations that 
may be life threatening and carry a significant burden to patients and the community (GINA 2019).
Asthma is a common disease affecting an estimated 340 million people worldwide and despite existing 
therapies, there are still significant unmet medical needs. The Global Burden of Asthma Report 
estimates that 23.7 million disability-adjusted life years are lost annually due to asthma, representing 
1% of the total global burden (Global Asthma Network 2018). According to the World Health 
Organization (WHO) estimates, there were 383,000 deaths due to asthma in 2015 (WHO 2017).
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
The goals of asthma management are to achieve and maintain symptom control and improve and 
maintain respiratory function in order to retain normal activity levels, to prevent the development of 
irreversible airway narrowing, and to reduce future risk of exacerbations and treatment side effects. 
The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guideline recommends a stepwise approach to the use of 
treatments to achieve this
Patients with asthma not adequately controlled on medium/or high LABA/ICS, the preferred treatment 
option in patients ≥ GINA Step 4, have airway obstruction as reflected by objective spirometry 
assessment of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (e.g. <80%), are symptomatic and are at 
risk to develop exacerbations.
The other option therapy for the patients at GINA Step 4 include the addition of tiotropium (LAMA) to 
high dose LABA/ICS or the addition of LTRA (leukotriene receptor antagonist) or low dose sustained-
release theophylline to medium or high ICS (which is less efficacious than the addition of LABA) (GINA 
2018). At GINA Step 5, therapeutic alternatives are even more limited and include addition of 
tiotropium, referral to a specialist and addition of biologic therapy (e.g. anti IgE, anti Il-5) that is 
specifically recommended for severe allergic asthma or addition of low dose oral corticosteroids (OCS), 
often associated with substantial side effects (GINA 2018).

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
The applicant submitted one pivotal study supporting the use of triple combination (medium dose 
QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. and high dose QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. both delivered via Concept1) in 
patients with asthma. 
Study CQVM149B2302 : A multicenter, randomized, 52-week, double-blind, parallel group, active 
controlled study to compare the efficacy and safety of QVM149 with QMF149 in patients with asthma. 
The primary endpoint was trough FEV1 at week 26 and the key secondary EP measurement of ACQ-7 at 
Week 26.
The applicant submitted also a number of supporting studies.
3.2.  Favourable effects
The primary objective of study CQVM149B2302 (2302) was to demonstrate the superiority in terms of 
trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) of either QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. as compared 
to QMF149 150/160 μg o.d. or QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. as compared to QMF149 150/320 μg o.d.
The primary efficacy objective of the study was met, with both high and medium doses of QVM149 
demonstrating superiority over the respective doses of QMF149. At Week 26, the LS mean treatment 
difference for trough FEV1 was 0.065 L (95% CI 0.027 to 0.103, adjusted p=0.002) for QVM149 
150/50/160 μg o.d. versus QMF149 150/320 μg o.d. and 0.074 L (95% CI 0.036 to 0.112, adjusted 
p<0.001) for QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. versus QMF149 150/160 μg o.d. These treatment differences 
were statistically significant. Sensitivity analysis results supported the primary analysis results. 
It can be concluded that the reported improvements in lung function were not large but on balance, 
and in comparison to the results reported for other medicinal products, could be considered as 
borderline clinically relevant.
Results of the other secondary endpoints which investigated changes in lung function, support the 
results of the primary endpoint. QVM149 demonstrated improvement as compared to the 
corresponding QMF149 doses in trough FEV1(by visit), pre-dose, FVC as well as peak expiratory flow, 
although the difference between these treatment groups for PEF at week 26 was below the MCID 
(defined as 25 L/min).
An additional secondary comparison was performed on QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. and QVM149 
150/50/160 μg o.d. delivered via Concept1 compared with salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 
50/500 μg b.i.d. via Accuhaler.
At Week 26, the LS mean treatment difference for trough FEV1 was 119 ml (95% CI 81 to 157 ml, 
p<0.001) for QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. versus salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 
μg b.i.d. and 98ml (95% CI 60 to 136 ml, p<0.001) for QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. versus salmeterol 
xinafoate /fluticasone propionate 50/500 μg b.i.d. In comparison to salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg 
the high and medium QVM149 dose improved morning and evening PEF and the observed differences 
are considered to be clinically relevant.
The assessment of the effect on exacerbation is considered to be particularly important to measure 
clinical relevance in Asthma. 
For QVM149 versus QMF149 comparison, there was only a trend for the reduction in exacerbations. 
The best results were reported for the higher dose of QVM149 (150/50/160μg) for the reduction of 
severe exacerbation as in this case 22% reduction in the rate of exacerbations (which would be 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 132/142
considered as clinically relevant) almost reached a statistical significance – rate ratio 0.78 (95% 
CI0.61,1.00 p =0.05)
In a double blinded analysis significant and clinically relevant reduction of the rate of exacerbations 
was reported for higher dose (based on full 52-week data) as compared to salmeterol xinafoate 
/fluticasone, however this comparison cannot be considered as pivotal, based on the design and 
statistical pre-defined analysis from the pivotal study. For higher dose of QVM149, there was 36 % 
reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations and 48% reduction in the rate of severe 
exacerbations. 
In comparison to salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d, for the medium dose of QVM149 there was 19 
% reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations and 16 % reduction in the rate of severe 
exacerbations, and in this case the statistical significance was not reached. 
It needs also to be noted that the doses of corticosteroid were not equivalent between QVM149 
150/50/80ug and salmeterol/fluticasone i.e the dose of ICS was higher in salmeterol/fluticasone 
combination than in QVM149 150/50/80ug. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
An additional benefit was seen when glycopyrronium was added to QMF149 (dual, 
mometasone/indacaterol combination) however better efficacy results were reported for the higher 
strength investigated in the study and therefore only this strength is considered approvable. The effect 
observed is considered borderline clinically significant but relevant for the intended population.
For the QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. versus QMF149 150/160 μg o.d comparison, statistical significance 
was not reached for any exacerbation related endpoint. In addition, the QVM149 medium dose was not 
compared to the medium dose of salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (although a 19 % 
reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was seen in comparison to the high dose 
salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate).
Proposed indication
For Enerzair Breezhaler the following indication was proposed by the applicant during the oral 
explanation:
Enerzair Breezhaler is indicated as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adults not adequately 
controlled with a maintenance combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and a medium or high dose 
of an inhaled corticosteroid, and who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous 
year.
As only the higher ICS strength is recommended for approval by CHMP, the applicant agreed to amend 
the indication only to patients on high dose ICS in line with the data provided and also in keeping with 
stepwise treatment approach. The indication agreed with CHMP is as follows : 
Enerzair Breezhaler is indicated as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adults not adequately 
controlled with a maintenance combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and a high dose of an 
inhaled corticosteroid, and who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year.

EMA/271332/2020 
Page 133/142
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
The safety profile of the individual active substances MF, glycopyrronium and indacaterol, are generally 
well characterised within their licensed indications as monotherapy and/or double fixed dose 
combinations. The safety assessment for the triple FDC therapy QVM149 thus seeks to understand the 
safety profile of the combination of the 3 active substances in an asthmatic setting.
Known AEs associated with these active substances such as nasopharyngitis, bronchitis and headache 
were comparable across the 5 groups. The AE’s dysphonia and cough were more frequent in the triple 
combination groups. Dysphonia is considered the most common AE suspected to be drug related 
(investigator reported) across all 5 groups with the highest incidence rate in the QVM high dose group. 
As expected from the pharmacological profile of QVM149, symptoms compatible with either the beta-
adrenergic or anticholinergic effect such as urinary retention and cardiocerebrovascular events have 
been observed, but in general the event rates were low.
The most frequent AEs by SOC were as expected, respiratory disorders and infections with the highest 
incidence rates of AEs in the control arm for both disorders. Gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal 
disorders occurred more frequently next on the list but there was no trend across the 5 groups for 
these AEs. Of note there was a trend for more cardiac disorders as an adverse event occurring in both 
triple QVM groups compared to both double QMF doses and the control arms. However, these events 
were low and cardiac AEs by Preferred Terms were not listed as the most frequently observed AEs.
The cardiovascular major objection initially raised was addressed adequately by the applicant in terms 
of the low number of events, supportive literature, the mandated assessment of LABAs in asthma 
safety trials from the FDA and lack of biological plausibility for the steroids. 
Overall, the SAEs that occurred in both triple QVM groups were comparable to the other groups and 
occurred at low frequencies across the 5 groups. Asthma exacerbation was the SAE with the highest 
incidence rate and both the triple QVM medium dose and the double QMF high dose had the most 
asthma exacerbations as an SAE but the incidence rates are too low for definite conclusions. However, 
they are listed adequately in the SmPC section 4.8.
Following further discussion with CHMP, a warning is introduced in the SmPC in relation to prolongation 
of the QT interval, systemic effects of steroids and added cataracts as an adverse drug reaction. The 
applicant will also monitor bone fracture as part of regular PSUR and perform close monitoring of 
conduction abnormalities in the PSUR.
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
At the time of submission, the pivotal study QVM2302 was still ongoing with incomplete safety data 
submitted which was considered a limitation. During the procedure, the applicant discussed the safety 
findings from the now completed 52 week’s pivotal study, (QVM2302) CSR II dated 16th September 
2019. A “Summary of changes” document for CSR I and CSR II dated 21st August has also been 
provided with statistical outputs of CSR II in the appendix.
The changes in QTc values in the QVM high dose group were too low to conclude a safety issue and 
completed data was requested. The numbers still remained low in CSR II with no newly occurring or 
worsening clinically notable QTc prolongation. The applicant has justified why additional QT monitoring 
and further characterisation is not required but has agreed to include an appropriate warning in the 
labelling. The deaths that occurred on QVM149 and QMF149 were not suspected by the investigators to 
be related to the study drug. None of these patients had any abnormal QTc findings during the 
duration of the study. However, a warning is introduced in the SmPC.
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 134/142
No discernible trends were observed relating to steroid effects on the bone mineral density (BMD) 
(defined as osteoporosis and osteopenia) however objective measures of bone mineral density (e.g. 
DEXA scanning) were not assessed as part of the protocol defined procedures in the QMF149/QVM149 
program and long term data would be more relevant for this potential issue. However, the warning of 
systemic steroid effects have been added to the SmPC and the applicant will monitor bone fracture in 
the PSURs post approval.
The applicant did not submit a dedicated cardiovascular safety study despite the risks associated with 
both the LABA and LAMA as per the reflection paper on assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of 
medicinal products.  Exclusion of patients with recent significant CV events or risk of QTc prolongation 
were not allowed in the pivotal trial on grounds of safety but the enrolled population may be 
considered representative of a real world population with asthma considering a number of patients had 
baseline CV risk factors including hypertension or smoking history.  Given the small numbers of 
adjudicated MACE events observed with its random distribution between the different treatment arms 
in study B2302, a dedicated cardiovascular safety study was not considered necessary. While the risks 
of QT prolongation have been captured in the SmPC, close monitoring for AE conduction abnormality is 
required and will be reported in PSURs.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d. and QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. are targeting patients with inadequately 
controlled asthma (defined as ACQ-7 score ≥ 1.5 at randomisation) despite treatments with medium or 
high dose of LABA/ICS combinations. These patients (in line with GINA 2019) are within GINA step 4 
or within GINA step 5. Treatment of these patients could be challenging however other therapies exists 
for this stage of the disease including addition of tiotropium (LAMA) to high dose LABA/ICS or the 
addition of LTRA (leukotriene receptor antagonist) or low dose sustained-release theophilline to 
medium or high ICS. For patients at GINA Step 5, therapeutic alternatives include addition of 
tiotropium, addition of biologic therapy or addition of low dose oral corticosteroids (OCS). 
The primary objective of pivotal study provided in support of this application was to demonstrate the 
superiority in terms of trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) of either QVM149 
150/50/80 μg o.d. as compared to QMF149 150/160 μg o.d. or QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. as 
compared to QMF149 150/320 μg o.d.
The primary efficacy objective was met, with both high and medium doses of QVM149 demonstrating 
superiority over the respective doses of QMF149. At Week 26, the LS mean treatment difference for 
trough FEV1 was 0.065 L (95% CI 0.027 to 0.103, adjusted p=0.002) for QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. 
versus QMF149 150/320 μg o.d. and 0.074 L (95% CI 0.036 to 0.112, adjusted p<0.001) for QVM149 
150/50/80 μg o.d. versus QMF149 150/160 μg o.d. 
The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in FEV1 has not been rigorously established for 
asthma, but it is likely that changes of 100–200 mL in FEV1 are clinically important.  However, MCID 
for improvements in trough FEV1 in patients already receiving medium or high dose LABA/ICS could be 
lower as patients already receiving bronchodilator may have less room for lung function improvement.
The reported improvements in lung function was statistically significantly higher however was not large 
but on balance could be considered as clinically relevant in comparison to the results reported for other 
medicinal products.
In line with the asthma guideline (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1), measurement of lung function 
parameters alone is considered insufficient for the assessment of therapeutic effect and lung function 
should be measured either as a co-primary or a key secondary endpoint. The applicant selected the 
assessment of “asthma control” as a key secondary endpoint (Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-7 
was assessed after 26 weeks of treatment). However, this key secondary objective was not met. In 
addition, there were also no statistically significant differences in the ACQ-7 responder rate between 
treatment groups at week 26.
Effect on exacerbation is considered to be particularly important to assess clinical relevance of the 
treatment. However, in the pivotal study, the effect on exacerbations was analysed as a secondary 
endpoint without adjustment for multiplicity. 
Assessment report 
EMA/271332/2020 
Page 138/142
For QVM149 versus QMF149 comparison, there was only a trend for the reduction in exacerbations.  
The best results were reported for the higher dose of QVM149 (150/50/160μg) for the reduction of 
severe exacerbation as in this case 22% reduction in the rate of exacerbations (which is considered as 
clinically relevant) almost reached a statistical significance – rate ratio 0.78 (95% CI0.6-,1.00 p 
=0.05). Further the oral explanation held in March 2020, the CHMP considered that only the higher 
dose could be approved. The benefit risk balance for QVM149 150/50/80 μg o.d was considered 
negative by CHMP. Consequently, the applicant withdrew its application for the medium dose strength.
Significant and clinically relevant reduction of the rate of exacerbations was reported for higher dose 
based on full 52-week data as compared to salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone. However, this 
comparison cannot be considered as pivotal as it was not under testing strategy but was considered 
relevant and supportive for the proposed indication. For the higher dose of QVM149 there was 36 % 
reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations and 48% reduction in the rate of severe 
exacerbations. 
For expected class effects of combination inhaler therapy, occurrence rates of more common AEs are 
relatively comparable between treatment arms. Serious CV events have been identified in the RMP as a 
potential risk. The applicant will monitor all these events closely using routine pharmacovigilance 
activity and will provide regular updates to the regulatory authorities via PSURs submissions.
3.7.1.  Balance of benefits and risks
The benefit risk balance for QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d is positive in patients on high dose ICS in line 
with the data provided and also in keeping with stepwise treatment approach.

4.  Recommendations
Outcome
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Enerzair Breezhaler is favourable in the following indication:
Enerzair Breezhaler is indicated as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adult patients not adequately 
controlled with a maintenance combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and a high dose of an inhaled 
corticosteroid who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year.
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 28 April 2020
Enerzair Breezhaler and Zimbus Breezhaler 
EMEA/H/C/001110/II/0049
The undersigned member of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion 
recommending the approval of the granting of the marketing authorisation of Enerzair Breezhaler 
and Zimbus Breezhaler for the following indication:
Maintenance treatment of asthma in adults not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination 
of a long-acting beta2-agonist and a high dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, and who experienced one 
or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following:
In the single pivotal trial CQVM149B2302 trough FEV1 was predefined to be followed by ACQ-7 in a 
hierarchical testing procedure. The ACQ-7 endpoint failed to achieve statistical significance. While the 
importance of asthma exacerbations to patients is undisputed, it is however not agreed that a 
treatment effect of Enerzair Breezhaler (Zimbus Breezhaler) fixed dose triple combination of 
indacaterol/glycopyrronium/mometasone furoate 150/50/160 μg (QVM149) can be concluded on based 
on the data from this clinical study. 
Exacerbations had been defined as secondary endpoint amongst other endpoints, and several types of 
statistical analyses and severity definitions had been defined. The key secondary endpoint ACQ-7 has 
failed, and further testing or switching to exacerbations is obviated. The post-hoc selection of the 
exacerbation endpoint increases the probability of erroneous conclusion of efficacy and picking a 
favourable result as post-hoc analysis also renders the estimates biased. In the present case, this 
concerns not only the switch from the pre-defined key secondary endpoint, but also the specific 
selection of the type of exacerbation comparison. Based on this, it is not agreed that a treatment effect 
of the triple combination compared to the dual combination is demonstrated with respect to 
exacerbations.
As a result, the benefit risk of the fixed dose combination of indacaterol/glycopyrronium/ mometasone 
furoate 150/50/160 μg (QVM149) is considered negative for the above indication.

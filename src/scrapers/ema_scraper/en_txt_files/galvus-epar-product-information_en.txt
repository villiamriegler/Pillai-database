CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Vildagliptin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
• 
as monotherapy in patients in whom metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or 
intolerance. 
in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, including insulin, 
when these do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for 
available data on different combinations). 
• 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults 
When used as monotherapy, in combination with metformin, in combination with thiazolidinedione, in 
combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea, or in combination with insulin (with or without 
metformin), the recommended daily dose of vildagliptin is 100 mg, administered as one dose of 50 mg 
in the morning and one dose of 50 mg in the evening. 
When used in dual combination with a sulphonylurea, the recommended dose of vildagliptin is 50 mg 
once daily administered in the morning. In this patient population, vildagliptin 100 mg daily was no 
more effective than vildagliptin 50 mg once daily. 
When used in combination with a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be considered 
to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Doses higher than 100 mg are not recommended.

If a dose of Galvus is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. A double dose 
should not be taken on the same day. 
The safety and efficacy of vildagliptin as triple oral therapy in combination with metformin and a 
thiazolidinedione have not been established. 
Additional information on special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
No dose adjustments are necessary in elderly patients (see also sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
≥ 50 ml/min). In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or with end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD), the recommended dose of Galvus is 50 mg once daily (see also sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Galvus should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment, including patients with pre-treatment 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3x the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) (see also sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
Galvus is not recommended for use in children and adolescents (< 18 years). The safety and efficacy 
of Galvus in children and adolescents (< 18 years) have not been established. No data are available 
(see also section 5.1). 
Method of administration 
Oral use 
Galvus can be administered with or without a meal (see also section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Galvus is not a substitute for insulin in insulin-requiring patients. Galvus should not be used in 
patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. 
Renal impairment 
There is limited experience in patients with ESRD on haemodialysis. Therefore Galvus should be used 
with caution in these patients (see also sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Galvus should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment, including patients with pre-treatment 
ALT or AST > 3x ULN (see also sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Liver enzyme monitoring 
Rare cases of hepatic dysfunction (including hepatitis) have been reported. In these cases, the patients 
were generally asymptomatic without clinical sequelae and liver function test results returned to 
normal after discontinuation of treatment. Liver function tests should be performed prior to the 
initiation of treatment with Galvus in order to know the patient’s baseline value. Liver function should 
be monitored during treatment with Galvus at three-month intervals during the first year and 
periodically thereafter. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored with a 
second liver function evaluation to confirm the finding and be followed thereafter with frequent liver 
function tests until the abnormality(ies) return(s) to normal. Should an increase in AST or ALT of 3x 
ULN or greater persist, withdrawal of Galvus therapy is recommended. 
Patients who develop jaundice or other signs suggestive of liver dysfunction should discontinue 
Galvus. 
Following withdrawal of treatment with Galvus and LFT normalisation, treatment with Galvus should 
not be reinitiated. 
Cardiac failure 
A clinical trial of vildagliptin in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional 
class I-III showed that treatment with vildagliptin was not associated with a change in left-ventricular 
function or worsening of pre-existing congestive heart failure (CHF) versus placebo. Clinical 
experience in patients with NYHA functional class III treated with vildagliptin is still limited and 
results are inconclusive (see section 5.1). 
There is no experience of vildagliptin use in clinical trials in patients with NYHA functional class IV 
and therefore use is not recommended in these patients. 
Skin disorders 
Skin lesions, including blistering and ulceration have been reported in extremities of monkeys in non-
clinical toxicology studies (see section 5.3). Although skin lesions were not observed at an increased 
incidence in clinical trials, there was limited experience in patients with diabetic skin complications. 
Furthermore, there have been post-marketing reports of bullous and exfoliative skin lesions. 
Therefore, in keeping with routine care of the diabetic patient, monitoring for skin disorders, such as 
blistering or ulceration, is recommended. 
Acute pancreatitis 
Use of vildagliptin has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Patients should be 
informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis. 
If pancreatitis is suspected, vildagliptin should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, 
vildagliptin should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of acute 
pancreatitis. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Sulphonylureas are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Patients receiving vildagliptin in combination 
with a sulphonylurea may be at risk for hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of sulphonylurea may 
be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.

Excipients 
This medicine contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance,  total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Vildagliptin has a low potential for interactions with co-administered medicinal products. Since 
vildagliptin is not a cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzyme substrate and does not inhibit or induce CYP 
450 enzymes, it is not likely to interact with active substances that are substrates, inhibitors or inducers 
of these enzymes. 
Combination with pioglitazone, metformin and glyburide 
Results from studies conducted with these oral antidiabetics have shown no clinically relevant 
pharmacokinetic interactions. 
Digoxin (Pgp substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) 
Clinical studies performed with healthy subjects have shown no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic 
interactions. However, this has not been established in the target population. 
Combination with amlodipine, ramipril, valsartan or simvastatin 
Drug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects were conducted with amlodipine, ramipril, valsartan 
and simvastatin. In these studies, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed 
after co-administration with vildagliptin. 
Combination with ACE-inhibitors 
There may be an increased risk of angioedema in patients concomitantly taking ACE-inhibitors.(see 
section 4.8). 
As with other oral antidiabetic medicinal products the hypoglycaemic effect of vildagliptin may be 
reduced by certain active substances, including thiazides, corticosteroids, thyroid products and 
sympathomimetics. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of vildagliptin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity at high doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Due to lack of human data, Galvus should not be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether vildagliptin is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown excretion of 
vildagliptin in milk. Galvus should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for Galvus (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Patients who 
experience dizziness as an adverse reaction should avoid driving vehicles or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Safety data were obtained from a total of 5 451 patients exposed to vildagliptin at a daily dose of 
100 mg (50 mg twice daily) in randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trials of at least 12 weeks 
duration. Of these patients, 4 622 patients received vildagliptin as monotherapy and 829 patients 
received placebo. 
The majority of adverse reactions in these trials were mild and transient, not requiring treatment 
discontinuations. No association was found between adverse reactions and age, ethnicity, duration of 
exposure or daily dose. Hypoglycaemia has been reported in patients receiving vildagliptin 
concomitantly with sulphonylurea and insulin. The risk of acute pancreatitis has been reported with 
the use of vildagliptin (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hepatic impairment 
Rare cases of hepatic dysfunction (including hepatitis) have been reported. In these cases, the patients 
were generally asymptomatic without clinical sequelae and liver function returned to normal after 
discontinuation of treatment. In data from controlled monotherapy and add-on therapy trials of up to 
24 weeks in duration, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations  3x ULN (classified as present on at 
least 2 consecutive measurements or at the final on-treatment visit) was 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.2% for 
vildagliptin 50 mg once daily, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily and all comparators, respectively. These 
elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic, non-progressive in nature and not 
associated with cholestasis or jaundice. 
Angioedema 
Rare cases of angioedema have been reported on vildagliptin at a similar rate to controls. A greater 
proportion of cases were reported when vildagliptin was administered in combination with an 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-Inhibitor). The majority of events were mild in 
severity and resolved with ongoing vildagliptin treatment. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia was uncommon when vildagliptin (0.4%) was used as monotherapy in comparative 
controlled monotherapy studies with an active comparator or placebo (0.2%). No severe or serious 
events of hypoglycaemia were reported. When used as add-on to metformin, hypoglycaemia occurred 
in 1% of vildagliptin-treated patients and in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients. When pioglitazone was 
added, hypoglycaemia occurred in 0.6% of vildagliptin-treated patients and in 1.9% of placebo-treated 
patients. When sulphonylurea was added, hypoglycaemia occurred in 1.2% of vildagliptin treated 
patients and in 0.6% of placebo-treated patients. When sulphonylurea and metformin were added, 
hypoglycaemia occurred in 5.1% of vildagliptin treated patients and in 1.9% of placebo treated 
patients. In patients taking vildagliptin in combination with insulin, the incidence of hypoglycaemia 
was 14% for vildagliptin and 16% for placebo. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Information regarding overdose with vildagliptin is limited. 
Symptoms 
Information on the likely symptoms of overdose was taken from a rising dose tolerability study in 
healthy subjects given Galvus for 10 days. At 400 mg, there were three cases of muscle pain, and 
individual cases of mild and transient paraesthesia, fever, oedema and a transient increase in lipase 
levels. At 600 mg, one subject experienced oedema of the feet and hands, and increases in creatine 
phosphokinase (CPK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), C-reactive protein (CRP) and myoglobin 
levels. Three other subjects experienced oedema of the feet, with paraesthesia in two cases. All 
symptoms and laboratory abnormalities resolved without treatment after discontinuation of the study 
medicinal product. 
Management 
In the event of an overdose, supportive management is recommended. Vildagliptin cannot be removed 
by haemodialysis. However, the major hydrolysis metabolite (LAY 151) can be removed by 
haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, ATC 
code: A10BH02 
Vildagliptin, a member of the islet enhancer class, is a potent and selective DPP-4 inhibitor. 
Mechanism of action 
The administration of vildagliptin results in a rapid and complete inhibition of DPP-4 activity, 
resulting in increased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels of the incretin hormones GLP-1 
(glucagon-like peptide 1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
By increasing the endogenous levels of these incretin hormones, vildagliptin enhances the sensitivity 
of beta cells to glucose, resulting in improved glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Treatment with 
vildagliptin 50-100 mg daily in patients with type 2 diabetes significantly improved markers of beta 
cell function including HOMA- (Homeostasis Model Assessment–), proinsulin to insulin ratio and 
measures of beta cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance test. In non-diabetic 
(normal glycaemic) individuals, vildagliptin does not stimulate insulin secretion or reduce glucose 
levels. 
By increasing endogenous GLP-1 levels, vildagliptin also enhances the sensitivity of alpha cells to 
glucose, resulting in more glucose-appropriate glucagon secretion. 
The enhanced increase in the insulin/glucagon ratio during hyperglycaemia due to increased incretin 
hormone levels results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production, leading to 
reduced glycaemia. 
The known effect of increased GLP-1 levels delaying gastric emptying is not observed with 
vildagliptin treatment. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
More than 15 000 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in double-blind placebo- or active-
controlled clinical trials of up to more than 2 years’ treatment duration. In these studies, vildagliptin 
was administered to more than 9 000 patients at daily doses of 50 mg once daily, 50 mg twice daily or 
100 mg once daily. More than 5 000 male and more than 4 000 female patients received vildagliptin 
50 mg once daily or 100 mg daily. More than 1 900 patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg once daily or 
100 mg daily were ≥ 65 years. In these trials, vildagliptin was administered as monotherapy in drug-
naïve patients with type 2 diabetes or in combination in patients not adequately controlled by other 
antidiabetic medicinal products. 
Overall, vildagliptin improved glycaemic control when given as monotherapy or when used in 
combination with metformin, a sulphonylurea, and a thiazolidinedione, as measured by clinically 
relevant reductions in HbA1c from baseline at study endpoint (see Table 2). 
In clinical trials, the magnitude of HbA1c reductions with vildagliptin was greater in patients with 
higher baseline HbA1c. 
In a 52-week double-blind controlled trial, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) reduced baseline HbA1c 
by -1% compared to -1.6% for metformin (titrated to 2 g/day) statistical non-inferiority was not 
achieved. Patients treated with vildagliptin reported significantly lower incidences of gastrointestinal 
adverse reactions versus those treated with metformin.

In a 24-week double-blind controlled trial, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to 
rosiglitazone (8 mg once daily). Mean reductions were -1.20% with vildagliptin and -1.48% with 
rosiglitazone in patients with mean baseline HbA1c of 8.7%. Patients receiving rosiglitazone 
experienced a mean increase in weight (+1.6 kg) while those receiving vildagliptin experienced no 
weight gain (-0.3 kg). The incidence of peripheral oedema was lower in the vildagliptin group than in 
the rosiglitazone group (2.1% vs. 4.1% respectively). 
In a clinical trial of 2 years’ duration, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to gliclazide (up 
to 320 mg/day). After two years, mean reduction in HbA1c was -0.5% for vildagliptin and -0.6% for 
gliclazide, from a mean baseline HBA1c of 8.6%. Statistical non-inferiority was not achieved. 
Vildagliptin was associated with fewer hypoglycaemic events (0.7%) than gliclazide (1.7%). 
In a 24-week trial, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to pioglitazone (30 mg once daily) 
in patients inadequately controlled with metformin (mean daily dose: 2020 mg). Mean reductions from 
baseline HbA1c of 8.4% were -0.9% with vildagliptin added to metformin and -1.0% with pioglitazone 
added to metformin. A mean weight gain of +1.9 kg was observed in patients receiving pioglitazone 
added to metformin compared to +0.3 kg in those receiving vildagliptin added to metformin. 
In a clinical trial of 2 years’ duration, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to glimepiride 
(up to 6 mg/day – mean dose at 2 years: 4.6 mg) in patients treated with metformin (mean daily dose: 
1894 mg). After 1 year mean reductions in HbA1c were -0.4% with vildagliptin added to metformin 
and -0.5% with glimepiride added to metformin, from a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.3%. Body weight 
change with vildagliptin was -0.2 kg vs +1.6 kg with glimepiride. The incidence of hypoglycaemia 
was significantly lower in the vildagliptin group (1.7%) than in the glimepiride group (16.2%). At 
study endpoint (2 years), the HbA1c was similar to baseline values in both treatment groups and the 
body weight changes and hypoglycaemia differences were maintained. 
In a 52-week trial, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to gliclazide (mean daily dose: 
229.5 mg) in patients inadequately controlled with metformin (metformin dose at baseline 
1928 mg/day). After 1 year, mean reductions in HbA1c were -0.81% with vildagliptin added to 
metformin (mean baseline HbA1c 8.4%) and -0.85% with gliclazide added to metformin (mean 
baseline HbA1c 8.5%); statistical non-inferiority was achieved (95% CI -0.11 – 0.20). Body weight 
change with vildagliptin was +0.1 kg compared to a weight gain of +1.4 kg with gliclazide. 
In a 24-week trial the efficacy of the fixed dose combination of vildagliptin and metformin (gradually 
titrated to a dose of 50 mg/500 mg twice daily or 50 mg/1000 mg twice daily) as initial therapy in 
drug-naïve patients was evaluated. Vildagliptin/metformin 50 mg/1000 mg twice daily reduced HbA1c 
by -1.82%, vildagliptin/metformin 50 mg/500 mg twice daily by -1.61%, metformin 1000 mg twice 
daily by -1.36% and vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily by -1.09% from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.6%. 
The decrease in HbA1c observed in patients with a baseline ≥10.0% was greater. 
A 24-week, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate 
the treatment effect of vildagliptin 50 mg once daily compared to placebo in 515 patients with type 2 
diabetes and moderate renal impairment (N=294) or severe renal impairment (N=221). 68.8% and 
80.5% of the patients with moderate and severe renal impairment respectively were treated with 
insulin (mean daily dose of 56 units and 51.6 units respectively) at baseline. In patients with moderate 
renal impairment vildagliptin significantly decreased HbA1c compared with placebo (difference 
of -0.53%) from a mean baseline of 7.9%. In patients with severe renal impairment, vildagliptin 
significantly decreased HbA1c compared with placebo (difference of -0.56%) from a mean baseline of 
7.7%. 
A 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 318 patients to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) in combination with metformin 
(≥1500 mg daily) and glimepiride (≥4 mg daily). Vildagliptin in combination with metformin and 
glimepiride significantly decreased HbA1c compared with placebo.The placebo-adjusted mean 
reduction from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.8% was -0.76%. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 449 patients to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) in combination with a stable dose 
of basal or premixed insulin (mean daily dose 41 units), with concomitant use of metformin (N=276) 
or without concomitant metformin (N=173). Vildagliptin in combination with insulin significantly 
decreased HbA1c compared with placebo. In the overall population, the placebo-adjusted mean 
reduction from a mean baseline HbA1c 8.8% was -0.72%. In the subgroups treated with insulin with or 
without concomitant metformin the placebo-adjusted mean reduction in HbA1c was -0.63% 
and -0.84%, respectively. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the overall population was 8.4% and 
7.2% in the vildagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. Patients receiving vildagliptin experienced 
no weight gain (+0.2 kg) while those receiving placebo experienced weight reduction (-0.7 kg). 
In another 24-week study in patients with more advanced type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on 
insulin (short and longer acting, average insulin dose 80 IU/day), the mean reduction in HbA1c when 
vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was added to insulin was statistically significantly greater than with 
placebo plus insulin (0.5% vs. 0.2%). The incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower in the vildagliptin 
group than in the placebo group (22.9% vs. 29.6%). 
A 52-week multi-centre, randomised, double-blind trial was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes 
and congestive heart failure (NYHA functional class I-III) to evaluate the effect of vildagliptin 50 mg 
twice daily (N=128) compared to placebo (N=126) on left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 
Vildagliptin was not associated with a change in left-ventricular function or worsening of pre-existing 
CHF. Adjudicated cardiovascular events were balanced overall. There were more cardiac events in 
vildagliptin treated patients with NYHA class III heart failure compared to placebo. However, there 
were imbalances in baseline cardiovascular risk favouring placebo and the number of events was low, 
precluding firm conclusions. Vildagliptin significantly decreased HbA1c compared with placebo 
(difference of 0.6%) from a mean baseline of 7.8% at week 16. In the subgroup with NYHA class III, 
the decrease in HbA1c compared to placebo was lower (difference 0.3%) but this conclusion is limited 
by the small number of patients (n=44). The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the overall population was 
4.7% and 5.6% in the vildagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. 
A five-year multi-centre, randomised, double-blind study (VERIFY) was conducted in patients with 
type 2 diabetes to evaluate the effect of an early combination therapy with vildagliptin and metformin 
(N = 998) against standard-of-care initial metformin monotherapy followed by combination with 
vildagliptin (sequential treatment group) (N = 1 003) in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes. 
The combination regimen of vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily plus metformin resulted in a statistically 
and clinically significant relative reduction in hazard for “time to confirmed initial treatment failure” 
(HbA1c value ≥7%) vs metformin monotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes over 
the 5-year study duration (HR [95%CI]: 0.51 [0.45, 0.58]; p<0.001). The incidence of initial treatment 
failure (HbA1c value ≥7%) was 429 (43.6%) patients in the combination treatment group and 
614 (62.1%) patients in the sequential treatment group. 
Cardiovascular risk 
A meta-analysis of independently and prospectively adjudicated cardiovascular events from 37 phase 
III and IV monotherapy and combination therapy clinical studies of up to more than 2 years duration 
(mean exposure 50 weeks for vildagliptin and 49 weeks for comparators) was performed and showed 
that vildagliptin treatment was not associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk versus 
comparators. The composite endpoint of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
including acute myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death was similar for vildagliptin 
versus combined active and placebo comparators [Mantel–Haenszel risk ratio (M-H RR) 0.82 (95% CI 
0.61-1.11)]. A MACE occurred in 83 out of 9 599 (0.86%) vildagliptin-treated patients and in 85 out 
of 7 102 (1.20%) comparator-treated patients. Assessment of each individual MACE component 
showed no increased risk (similar M-H RR). Confirmed heart failure (HF) events defined as HF 
requiring hospitalisation or new onset of HF were reported in 41 (0.43%) vildagliptin-treated patients 
and 32 (0.45%) comparator-treated patients with M-H RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.68-1.70).

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
vildagliptin in all subsets of the paediatric population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration in the fasting state, vildagliptin is rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma 
concentrations observed at 1.7 hours. Food slightly delays the time to peak plasma concentration to 
2.5 hours, but does not alter the overall exposure (AUC). Administration of vildagliptin with food 
resulted in a decreased Cmax (19%). However, the magnitude of change is not clinically significant, so 
that Galvus can be given with or without food. The absolute bioavailability is 85%. 
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding of vildagliptin is low (9.3%) and vildagliptin distributes equally between 
plasma and red blood cells. The mean volume of distribution of vildagliptin at steady-state after 
intravenous administration (Vss) is 71 litres, suggesting extravascular distribution. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Metabolism is the major elimination pathway for vildagliptin in humans, accounting for 69% of the 
dose. The major metabolite (LAY 151) is pharmacologically inactive and is the hydrolysis product of 
the cyano moiety, accounting for 57% of the dose, followed by the glucuronide (BQS867) and the 
amide hydrolysis products (4% of dose). In vitro data in human kidney microsomes suggest that the 
kidney may be one of the major organs contributing to the hydrolysis of vildagliptin to its major 
inactive metabolite, LAY151. DPP-4 contributes partially to the hydrolysis of vildagliptin based on an 
in vivo study using DPP-4 deficient rats. Vildagliptin is not metabolised by CYP 450 enzymes to any 
quantifiable extent. Accordingly, the metabolic clearance of vildagliptin is not anticipated to be 
affected by co-medications that are CYP 450 inhibitors and/or inducers. In vitro studies demonstrated 
that vildagliptin does not inhibit/induce CYP 450 enzymes. Therefore, vildagliptin is not likely to 
affect metabolic clearance of co-medications metabolised by CYP 1A2, CYP 2C8, CYP 2C9, CYP 
2C19, CYP 2D6, CYP 2E1 or CYP 3A4/5. 
Elimination 
Following oral administration of [14C] vildagliptin, approximately 85% of the dose was excreted into 
the urine and 15% of the dose is recovered in the faeces. Renal excretion of the unchanged vildagliptin 
accounted for 23% of the dose after oral administration. After intravenous administration to healthy 
subjects, the total plasma and renal clearances of vildagliptin are 41 and 13 l/h, respectively. The mean 
elimination half-life after intravenous administration is approximately 2 hours. The elimination half-
life after oral administration is approximately 3 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The Cmax for vildagliptin and the area under the plasma concentrations versus time curves (AUC) 
increased in an approximately dose proportional manner over the therapeutic dose range. 
Characteristics in specific groups of patients 
Gender 
No clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin were observed between male 
and female healthy subjects within a wide range of age and body mass index (BMI). DPP-4 inhibition 
by vildagliptin is not affected by gender. 
Elderly 
In healthy elderly subjects (≥ 70 years), the overall exposure of vildagliptin (100 mg once daily) was 
increased by 32%, with an 18% increase in peak plasma concentration as compared to young healthy 
subjects (18-40 years). These changes are, however, not considered to be clinically relevant. DPP-4 
inhibition by vildagliptin is not affected by age. 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of impaired hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin was studied in patients 
with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment based on the Child-Pugh scores (ranging from 6 
for mild to 12 for severe) in comparison with healthy subjects. The exposure to vildagliptin after a 
single dose in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment was decreased (20% and 8%, 
respectively), while the exposure to vildagliptin for patients with severe impairment was increased by 
22%. The maximum change (increase or decrease) in the exposure to vildagliptin is ~30%, which is 
not considered to be clinically relevant. There was no correlation between the severity of the hepatic 
disease and changes in the exposure to vildagliptin. 
Renal impairment 
A multiple-dose, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the lower 
therapeutic dose of vildagliptin (50 mg once daily) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal 
impairment defined by creatinine clearance (mild: 50 to <80 ml/min, moderate: 30 to <50 ml/min and 
severe: <30 ml/min) compared to normal healthy control subjects. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vildagliptin AUC increased on average 1.4, 1.7 and 2-fold in patients with mild, moderate and severe 
renal impairment, respectively, compared to normal healthy subjects. AUC of the metabolites 
LAY151 and BQS867 increased on average about 1.5, 3 and 7-fold in patients with mild, moderate 
and severe renal impairment, respectively. Limited data from patients with end stage renal disease 
(ESRD) indicate that vildagliptin exposure is similar to that in patients with severe renal impairment. 
LAY151 concentrations were approximately 2-3-fold higher than in patients with severe renal 
impairment. 
Vildagliptin was removed by haemodialysis to a limited extent (3% over a 3-4 hour haemodialysis 
session starting 4 hours post dose). 
Ethnic group 
Limited data suggest that race does not have any major influence on vildagliptin pharmacokinetics. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Intra-cardiac impulse conduction delays were observed in dogs with a no-effect dose of 15 mg/kg (7-
fold human exposure based on Cmax). 
Accumulation of foamy alveolar macrophages in the lung was observed in rats and mice. The no-
effect dose in rats was 25 mg/kg (5-fold human exposure based on AUC) and in mice 750 mg/kg (142-
fold human exposure). 
Gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly soft faeces, mucoid faeces, diarrhoea and, at higher doses, 
faecal blood were observed in dogs. A no-effect level was not established. 
Vildagliptin was not mutagenic in conventional in vitro and in vivo tests for genotoxicity. 
A fertility and early embryonic development study in rats revealed no evidence of impaired fertility, 
reproductive performance or early embryonic development due to vildagliptin. Embryo-foetal toxicity 
was evaluated in rats and rabbits. An increased incidence of wavy ribs was observed in rats in 
association with reduced maternal body weight parameters, with a no-effect dose of 75 mg/kg (10-fold 
human exposure). In rabbits, decreased foetal weight and skeletal variations indicative of 
developmental delays were noted only in the presence of severe maternal toxicity, with a no-effect 
dose of 50 mg/kg (9-fold human exposure). A pre- and postnatal development study was performed in 
rats. Findings were only observed in association with maternal toxicity at ≥ 150 mg/kg and included a 
transient decrease in body weight and reduced motor activity in the F1 generation. 
A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats at oral doses up to 900 mg/kg (approximately 
200 times human exposure at the maximum recommended dose). No increases in tumour incidence 
attributable to vildagliptin were observed. Another two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in 
mice at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas and 
haemangiosarcomas was observed with a no-effect dose of 500 mg/kg (59-fold human exposure) and 
100 mg/kg (16-fold human exposure), respectively. The increased incidence of these tumours in mice 
is considered not to represent a significant risk to humans based on the lack of genotoxicity of 
vildagliptin and its principal metabolite, the occurrence of tumours only in one species and the high 
systemic exposure ratios at which tumours were observed. 
In a 13-week toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, skin lesions have been recorded at doses 
≥ 5 mg/kg/day. These were consistently located on the extremities (hands, feet, ears and tail). At 
5 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to human AUC exposure at the 100 mg dose), only blisters 
were observed. They were reversible despite continued treatment and were not associated with 
histopathological abnormalities. Flaking skin, peeling skin, scabs and tail sores with correlating 
histopathological changes were noted at doses ≥ 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times human AUC 
exposure at the 100 mg dose). Necrotic lesions of the tail were observed at ≥ 80 mg/kg/day. Skin 
lesions were not reversible in the monkeys treated at 160 mg/kg/day during a 4-week recovery period.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Galvus is and what it is used for 
The active substance of Galvus, vildagliptin, belongs to a group of medicines called “oral 
antidiabetics”. 
Galvus is used to treat adult patients with type 2 diabetes. It is used when diabetes cannot be 
controlled by diet and exercise alone. It helps to control the level of sugar in the blood. Your doctor 
will prescribe Galvus either alone or together with certain other antidiabetic medicines which you will 
already be taking, if these have not proved sufficiently effective to control diabetes. 
Type 2 diabetes develops if the body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin that the body 
makes does not work as well as it should. It can also develop if the body produces too much glucagon. 
Insulin is a substance which helps to lower the level of sugar in the blood, especially after meals. 
Glucagon is a substance which triggers the production of sugar by the liver, causing the blood sugar 
level to rise. The pancreas makes both of these substances. 
How Galvus works 
Galvus works by making the pancreas produce more insulin and less glucagon. This helps to control 
the blood sugar level. This medicine has been shown to reduce blood sugar, which may help to prevent 
complications from your diabetes. Even though you are now starting a medicine for your diabetes, it is 
important that you continue to follow the diet and/or exercise which has been recommended for you.

2.  What you need to know before you take Galvus 
Do not take Galvus: 
• 
if you are allergic to vildagliptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic to vildagliptin or any of the other ingredients of 
Galvus, do not take this medicine and talk to your doctor. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Galvus 
• 
if you have type 1 diabetes (i.e. your body does not produce insulin) or if you have a condition 
called diabetic ketoacidosis. 
if you are taking an anti-diabetic medicine known as a sulphonylurea (your doctor may want to 
reduce your dose of the sulphonylurea when you take it together with Galvus in order to avoid 
low blood glucose [hypoglycaemia]). 
if you have moderate or severe kidney disease (you will need to take a lower dose of Galvus). 
if you are on dialysis. 
if you have liver disease. 
if you suffer from heart failure. 
if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you have previously taken vildagliptin but had to stop taking it because of liver disease, you should 
not take this medicine. 
Diabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. You are advised to follow the 
recommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse. You are also

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed therapeutic indication is: 
“Tepkinly as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.’’ 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Malignant lymphoma represents a disease entity characterized by malignant transformation of the cells 
from lymphoid tissue. Non–Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) are a heterogeneous group of 
lymphoproliferative disorders originating in B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes or natural killer cells. 
Approximately 80% are of B-cell origin (B-NHL) (Cheson et al., 2021). Clinically, NHL can be divided 
into aggressive NHL (aNHL; around 30%) and indolent NHL (iNHL). The applicant refers to aggressive 
B-NHL as large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) in this submission, however formally this category also 
includes other subtypes besides LBCLs, such as Burkitt lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. 
LBCL represents almost 30% of all cases of NHL. The most common histologic subtype is DLBCL NOS, 
which represents the majority (80%) of all cases of LBCL (Sehn and Salles, 2021). The annual 
incidence of DLBCL is estimated to be 5.6 per 100,000 in the US (SEER, 2022) and 7.4 per 100,000 in 
Europe (calculated from the proportion of DLBCL NOS in NHL [40.6%] from ECIS) (HMRN, 2020). 
Other LBCL entities are more rare and include primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL; 
around 6% of LBCL cases), high-grade B-cell lymphoma with double or triple hits (HBCL; 4–8% of 
LBCL cases), T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL), EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma, and more (Alaggio 2022, Swerdlow 2016). The incidence of PMBCL is 0.04 per 100,000 per 
year, respectively (Scott et al., 2018; SEER, 2022; Yu et al., 2021). In 2022 a new edition of the 
classification has been published, i.e. the 5th edition of the World Health Organization classification of 
the haematolymphoid neoplasms. In this edition, the entity of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with dual 
rearrangements of MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 has been renamed to high grade B-cell lymphoma with 
MYC and BCL2 rearrangements. The classification of high-grade B-cell lymphoma NOS remains the 
same with the updated classification (Alaggio et al., 2022). 
Follicular lymphoma (FL) comprises a group of malignant lymphomas consisting of follicle center cells. 
In the WHO classification, follicular lymphoma is a separate disease entity that is not included in the  
large B-cell lymphoma entity, but both fall under the category mature B-cell neoplasms (Sehn et al., 
2021). Notably, the rare subtype FL grade 3B (FL3B) is traditionally treated as DLBCL due to 
similarities in biology (see below) and behaviour, and is often grouped as an aggressive NHL (aNHL).  
The incidence of FL grade 3B is 0.26 per 100,000 per year, respectively (Scott et al., 2018; SEER, 
2022; Yu et al., 2021). For (D)LBCL the median age at presentation is 64 years for patients and there 
is a male predominance with approximately 55 percent of cases occurring in men (Morton 2006). For 
PMBCL there is a female predominance and a median age at diagnosis in the third to fourth decade.

2.1.3.  Biologic features 
DLBCL not otherwise specified (DLBCL, NOS) represents the most common entity, and is defined by 
large-cell morphology as above, mature B-cell phenotype, and lack of criteria defining specific large B-
cell lymphoma entities. Two main subtypes are recognized based on gene expression profile (GEP); the 
germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) subtype and the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype. In total, 10 to 
15% of the DLBCL cases are unclassifiable (Swerdlow 2016).  
HGBCL is characterized by dual rearrangements of MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 (Swerdlow 2016). Note 
that this entity is renamed in the updated 5th WHO edition as described above to high grade B-cell 
lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements. The classification of high-grade B-cell lymphoma NOS 
remains the same with the updated classification (Alaggio et al., 2022). PMBCL is thought to arise from 
thymic (medullary) B cells. FL3B consists of follicle center cells and is characterized by the exclusive 
presence of centroblasts. The sole distinguishing feature of FL3B (follicular growth) and DLBCL (diffuse 
growth) is the growth pattern (Koch 2021, Horn 2011). DLBCL and FL3B do not differ significantly with 
regard to genetics and immunohistochemistry, however rearrangements of the BCL6 gene locus may 
be less frequent in FL3B compared to DLBCL (Horn 2011). 
The pan-B lymphocyte markers include CD20, CD19 and CD79a. CD20 negative NHLs are rare, with a 
rate of 1–2% of all B cell NHLs. The most common CD20 negative types include plasmablastic 
lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, LBCL arising from HHV8-associated multicentric Castleman’s 
disease, and ALK+ LBCL. However, CD20 positive lymphoma can relapse as CD20 negative lymphoma 
after CD20 antibody therapy (i.e. rituximab; Hiraga 2009). The frequency of occurrence is unknown. In 
the literature rates range from 8% till 26% (Marshalek 2022, Prevodnik 2011, Hiraga 2009, Rasheed 
2018). In addition, low CD20 expression can also be observed in a part of the newly diagnosed DLBCL 
patients (11-42%; Johnson et al., 2009; Tokunaga et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2016; Boltežar et al., 
2018). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Patients with DLBCL present with a rapidly enlarging symptomatic mass, most usually nodal 
enlargement in the neck or abdomen, or, in the case of PMBCL, the mediastinum. Extranodal 
involvement is common among those presenting with stage I/II disease. Systemic "B" symptoms (i.e., 
fever, weight loss, drenching night sweats) are observed in approximately 30 percent of patients, and 
the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is elevated in over 50% (UpToDate). For prognostic purposes, 
the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and age-adjusted IPI (aaIPI) should be calculated (Tilly 2015). 
DLBCL is diagnosed by a surgical excision biopsy, usually in a lymph node. Pathologic diagnosis is 
made based on morphology and immunophenotyping. GEP can be used to classify DLBCL in GCB or 
ABC and cytogenetics to detect abnormalities involving for instance MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 (UpToDate). 
DLBCL is curable in approximately half of cases with current therapy, particularly in those who achieve 
a complete remission with first-line treatment (Crump et al., 2017). Prognosis in DLBCL is highly 
associated with the International Prognostic Index (IPI) score (Ziepert 2010, Salles 2011) and 
pathological features (see above). HGBL with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements has a more 
aggressive clinical course compared to DLBCL and a poor response to therapy (Green 2012, Johnson 
2012, Rosenthal 2017). PMBCL and FL3B do not differ in clinical course and prognosis from DLBCL 
(Koch 2021, Lazzarino 1997).

2.1.5.  Management 
The standard first-line therapy for LBCL and DLBCL as per the recommendations of NCCN and ESMO is 
R-CHOP (or dose-adjusted R-EPOCH). Substituting vincristine for Polivy leads to a superior PFS in 
patients with an intermediate- or high-risk prognosis by IPI (Tilly 2021). Although approximately two-
thirds of patients survive for 5 years after first line treatment, up to 50% of the patients become 
refractory to treatment or relapse (Crump et al., 2017). For patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) 
DLBCL, standard therapy currently entails salvage chemotherapy with non-cross resistant 
chemotherapy in second line, followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in 
medically fit patients (Philip et al., 1995). About half of the patients will have a response sufficient to 
proceed to ASCT (Gisselbrecht et al 2010, Crump et al 2014). 
For DLBCL patients after two or more lines of systemic therapy several therapies are available.  
•  Chemo-immunotherapy have been a long-standing treatment choice with regimes such as R-
GemOX and BR, however these regimens are not associated with long-term disease control/cure. 
For R-GemOX, responses range between 38% and 66% with a CR rate of 33 till 44% (Cazelles et 
al., 2021, Mounier 2013, Lopez 2007) and for BR the ORR is 25% with a CR rate of 23%. The 
duration of response was 17 months till not estimated (NE). 
•  CAR T-cell therapies, all of which directed at CD19: Yescarta, Kymriah and Breyanzi. ORRs for all 
treated patients between 54% and 74% have been reported with CR rates between 41% and 54% 
for all CAR T-cell treated patients. When looking specifically to all patients who were leukapheresed 
ORR was between 37% and 68% and CR between 28% and 50%. DoRs were observed between 17 
to 20 months for Breyanzi at a median follow up (FU) 20 months or were not reached for Yescarta 
and Kymriah (63 and 24 months FU respectively).For patients not eligible for ASCT the following 
therapies are approved: Polivy is an anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). In combination 
with BR a CR rate of 57%, an ORR of 70% and DOR of 10 months were observed with a median FU 
of 28 months. A median OS 12 (vs 5 months with BR) has been reported. Minjuvi is a monocloncal 
antibody against CD19. In combination with lenalidomide, an ORR of 57%, a CR rate of 40% and a 
DoR 44 months was observed at a median FU time of 35 months.  
•  Zynlonta is an ADC targeting CD19 authorised by the EC in December 2022. The ORR is 48% with 
25% of the patients in CR and a DoR of 10.3 months at a median FU of 7.8 months. 
• 
Pixantrone is a cytotoxic aza-anthracenedione approved for multiply relapsed or refractry aNHL (3rd 
and 4th line of treatment). The ORR and CR rate at the end of the trial were 40% and 16%. 
Patients treated with Pixuvri roughly had a 2.5 month longer progression free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) compared to single-agent chemotherapy. 
Therapies specifically approved for other types of LBCL:  
• 
• 
• 
For HGBL Zynlonta is approved. The ORR was 45% in these patients. 
For PMBCL Breyanzi (ORR 78.6%) and Yescarta (ORR 88%) are approved. 
For FL3B Breyanzi is approved and responses of 66.7% were reported. 
There is an unmet need in LBCL patients after two or more lines of systemic therapy to improve 
treatment outcomes in terms of increasing (duration of) ORR and CR, overcoming resistance to 
existing therapies and improving safety or providing a different safety profile compared to existing 
therapies. There is a similar degree of unmet medical need across the disease entities in aggressive 
NHL, including for patients with HGBL and PMBCL, as well as for patients with FL3B, in which therapies 
in the relapsed and refractory used are overall similar to those used for DLBCL.

2.2.  About the product 
Epcoritamab is a humanized IgG1 bispecific antibody that binds to a specific extracellular epitope of 
CD20 on B cells and to CD3 on T cells. The activity of epcoritamab is dependent upon simultaneous 
engagement of CD20-expressing cancer cells and CD3-expressing endogenous T cells by epcoritamab 
that induces specific T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated killing of CD20-expressing cells. Epcoritamab 
Fc region is silenced for direct immune effector mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody-dependent 
cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).  
The pharmacotherapeutic group is antineoplastic agents, Other Antineoplastic agents. The ATC code: 
not yet assigned. 
The claimed indication is “Tepkinly as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic 
therapy.” 
The proposed posology is epcoritamab (SC) in an initial priming dose of 0.16 mg (Cycle [C]1 Day [D]1), 
an intermediate dose of 0.8 mg (C1D8), and a full dose of 48 mg at C1D15, C1D22, and thereafter. 
Then once weekly (QW) during Cycles 2 to 3, once every 2 weeks (Q2W) during Cycles 4 to 9, and 
once every 4 weeks (Q4W) during Cycle 10 and beyond (until unacceptable toxicity, progressive 
disease [PD]). The length of one treatment cycle was 4 weeks, i.e. 28 days. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
The applicant proposed the following specific obligation: In order to confirm the efficacy of 
epcoritamab in the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL, the MAH should submit the results 
of the primary efficacy analysis for study GCT3013-05. 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as a high unmet medical need still exists for additional 
novel, effective, and widely available treatment options that can provide meaningful benefit 
(i.e., improved response rates, manageable/less toxicity) particularly for those who have 
primary refractory disease and/or disease refractory to multiple lines of therapies (including 
CAR T-cell therapy), patients with disease transformed from indolent lymphomas, or patients 
with DH/TH disease, disease with certain chromosomal rearrangements or genetic profiles, and 
epcoritamab would provide meaningful improvement in efficacy over approved therapies.  
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.

water for injections. 
The product is available in a 2 mL clear type I glass vial, a fluoropolymer-coated rubber stopper and an 
aluminum cap with flip-off top. 
The active substance epcoritamab (INN) is a bi-specific antibody (bsAb) generated by a process called 
controlled Fab
arm exchange of the two parental antibodies, intermediates 3001d and 3005a. The 
parental antibodies, 3001d and 3005a, are separately produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells 
‑
by recombinant DNA technology and purified as biological intermediates (BIs). 
2.4.2.  Intermediates – 3001d and 3005a 
2.4.2.1.  General Information 
The intermediate 3001d (IgG1-CD20-FEAR) is a human IgG1κ antibody targeting B cell antigen CD20, 
and composed of two heavy chains (HC) and two light chains (LC) with a combined weight of 149 kDa. 
The two heavy chains are bound to each other by two interchain disulfide bonds, and one light chain is 
attached to one heavy chain by a single interchain disulfide bond. Each light chain has two intrachain 
disulfide bonds, and the heavy chains have four intrachain disulfide bonds. 
The intermediate 3005a (IgG1-CD3-FEAL) is a humanized IgG1λ antibody targeting T cell antigen CD3, 
and composed of two heavy chains and two light chains with a combined weight of 149 kDa. The two 
heavy chains are bound to each other by two interchain disulfide bonds, and one light chain is attached 
to one heavy chain by a single interchain disulfide bond. Each light chain has two intrachain disulfide 
bonds, and the heavy chains have four intrachain disulfide bonds.  
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
3001d and 3005a biological intermediates are manufactured, tested and released in accordance with 
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The intermediates 3001d and 3005a are expressed in Chinese 
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The manufacturing process for the 3001d and 3005a BIs follows the same 
major steps. Minor differences can be identified with regard to process settings, these are all supported 
by process characterisation data that are specific for the 3001d and 3005a processes. Cells from a vial 
of the working cell bank (WCB) are thawed and progressively expanded prior to inoculation of the 
production bioreactor. Upon completion of the production bioreactor culture, unprocessed bulk is 
clarified. At the end of cultivation, the unprocessed bulk is tested.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 14/209 
 
 
 
The purification process consists of steps such as chromatography, filtration and removal and 
inactivation of potential viral contaminants. The processes are designed to capture 3001d and 3005a 
from the respective clarified harvests, reduce process and product-related impurities, and to produce 
3001d and 3005a of the appropriate purity and concentration in the formulation buffer for further 
manufacture.  
A batch of 3001d/3005a biological intermediate is derived from a working cell bank (WCB) vial, 
production bioreactor and a downstream purification.  
Microbial control limits are in place and virus safety was designed into the 3001d/3005a purification 
processes by including dedicated steps that provide inactivation and removal of potential viruses. 
Process parameter (PP) ranges and in-process controls (IPCs) are defined and justified as part of the 
overall control strategy. Reprocessing is allowed in the event of a post-use filter integrity test failure or 
a breach of system integrity.  
Control of materials 
Raw materials used in the manufacture of 3001d and 3005a intermediates are either of compendial 
grade or controlled to ensure the quality and safety of the BI and to maintain the consistency of the 
manufacturing processand the compositions of media, buffers and solutions are provided in sufficient 
detail and the applicant is notified in case of changes. The materials are animal and human component 
free.  
The 3001d and 3005a cell banking systems are two-tiered CHO cell bank systems, where the master 
cell banks (MCB) were used to generate the current and future WCBs. Both cell banks were generated 
in accordance with GMP requirements using no raw materials of animal or human origin.  
The MCBs and WCBs for 3001d and 3005a were tested and characterized including virus testing. Both 
have been shown to be free from microbial organisms and mycoplasma, confirmed to be of Chinese 
hamster origin, and suitable for the generation of future WCBs and for manufacturing purposes. The 
limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) is defined from thaw of the 3001d and 3005a MCBs. The generation 
and qualification of future WCBs has been presented and found adequate.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Classifications of attributes, controls, parameters and ranges used in the dossier are defined. Critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) were identified. Process characterization has identified that certain process 
steps can impact the CQAs of the product. The control of these critical steps is important for the 
control of the CQAs. A critical step is defined as a process step that contains critical process 
parameters (CPPs) or critical in-process controls (IPCs). The overall control strategy is considered 
adequate for control of the manufacturing process. 
Process validation 
The process validation strategy encompasses three stages: process design, process performance 
qualification (PPQ), and ongoing process verification. The PPQ campaign consisted of multiple 
consecutive batches and a contingency batch manufactured at the commercial scale and site. The PPQ 
protocols included prospectively defined acceptance criteria consisting of numerical limits for process 
parameters and process controls and excursions from the acceptance criteria were evaluated for their 
impact on product quality.  
Data from the PPQ batches and the contingency batch confirm that the manufacturing processes of 
3001d and 3005a are in a validated state at the commercial manufacturing site and scale. 
The set of supportive process validation includes studies regarding: impurity clearance, in-process 
product pool hold times, reuse of Protein A resin, and batch uniformity.

An ongoing process verification program will monitor process performance using statistical analysis and 
trending and limits will be defined when enough data are available; the applicant is reminded that any 
changes should be applied in accordance with the variation regulation. 
Manufacturing process development 
During development,  3001d and 3005a both had two versions of processes developed, Process 1 and 
Process 2. Process 2 is the commercial manufacturing process for 3001d and 3005a. The 
manufacturing Process 1 was transferred to commercial site (Process 2) to support commercial 
manufacturing. 
Process 1 materials produced under non-GMP and GMP manufacturing conditions for 3001d and 3005a 
are generally considered comparable. Comparability studies were designed to assess the transfers from 
the respective Process 1 to Process 2, this is considered adequately demonstrated. The analytical 
method transfers coinciding with the process transfers are considered adequately performed.  
For both intermediates, process characterization was performed to provide process understanding by 
establishing process parameter criticality, and setting appropriate acceptable ranges for process 
parameters and acceptance criteria for IPCs using qualified scale-down models. Individual process 
steps were characterized to determine acceptable ranges for process parameters. Process parameters 
that impact a CQA are scored to determine the classification (CPP or non-CPP) based on a pre-defined 
criterion. Overall, the proposed acceptable ranges and process parameter classifications can be 
considered well supported by development data. The control strategy is considered approvable.  
Comparability 
An analytical comparability was performed to assess the potential impact on product quality of 3001d 
and 3005a between Process 1 and Process 2. The comparability study included evaluation of release 
data, head-to-head analytical testing by selected release tests, extended physicochemical and 
biological characterization as well as stability study of Process 1 and Process 2 batches. It is concluded 
that the product quality attributes of 3001d and 3005a are not significantly impacted by the process 
changes from Process 1 to Process 2. Therefore, the 3001d and 3005a from Process 2 were 
comparable to that from Process 1. Comparability is considered sufficiently addressed. 
Characterization 
Characterization of 3001d and 3005a were performed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the 
biochemical, biophysical, and biological properties of the proteins and a precise description of their 
quality attributes. State-of-the-art methods were used to evaluate properties that relate to the 
molecular primary, secondary, tertiary and higher order structures, molar absorption, post-
translational modification, size and charge heterogeneity, functional characteristics, immunological 
properties, and thermal stability. The analytical results from multiple 3001d and 3005a BI batches are 
consistent with the proposed structures.  
Consistent and efficient clearance of process-related impurities is demonstrated.  
Size variants of 3001d and of 3005a, high molecular weight species (HMWS) and low molecular weight 
species (LMWS), have been classified as the product-related impurities. This can be supported. In 
addition, specific acidic variants of 3005a have been assessed to be product-related impurities due to 
their impact on the biological activity.

2.4.2.3.  Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and 
container closure 
Tests were selected based on a detailed understanding of the CQAs of 3001d and 3005a BIs. Identity, 
purity, protein concentration, and safety of each batch of 3001d and 3005a BIs is assessed and 
confirmed according to the proposed specification. The BI specification does not include general tests.    
Multiple commercial scale batches for both intermediates have been taken into consideration for 
specification setting and justification, stability data are used to set shelf life limits. The acceptance 
criteria for purity-indicating attributes, i.e. mass, charge and size heterogeneity, are acceptably set.  
Method descriptions for all non-compendial analytical procedures are provided and validations are 
performed according to ICH Q2(R1). The compendial methods have been verified to demonstrate the 
suitability for the intended purpose. Analytical procedures are described and validated according to the 
relevant guidelines.  
Batch information for all 3001d BI batches is provided. All batch data were in line with the acceptance 
criteria at the time of testing except for one. The results for batch release demonstrate a sufficient 
level of batch-to-batch consistency. 
Batch information for all 3005a BI batches is provided. All batch data were in line with the acceptance 
criteria at the time of testing, except for a Process 1 batch which had out-of-specification results at 
release. The results for batch release demonstrate a sufficient level of batch-to-batch consistency.  
The compendial test methods have been verified in accordance with current editions of pharmacopeias. 
The non-compendial analytical test methods have been developed and appropriately validated for the 
release and stability testing of 3001d and 3005a BIs. 
Reference standards or materials 
The 3001d and 3005a BIs reference standards (RSs) follow a two-tiered approach with a primary RS 
(PRS) and a working RS (WRS), where the PRS is used to (re)qualify (new) WRSs. The RSs are 
adequately qualified and considered representative of the commercial product. The PRS and WRS are 
requalified biannually through the lifetime of the reference standard. Protocols for (re)qualification are 
provided and considered acceptable.  
Container closure system 
3001d and 3005a BIs are stored in single use sterile bags. The bags meet the relevant requirements 
with regard to biological activity, microbial aspects, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) 
and compatibility.  
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability studies are being conducted on all 3001d and 3005a BIs Process 1 and Process 2 GMP batches 
manufactured to date in accordance with ICH stability guidelines. The stability studies are performed 
using containers from the same materials as the 3001d /3005a BI container closure system but 
downscaled in size. At the proposed long-term storage conditions, the stability-indicating parameters 
show no significant effect. Under the accelerated and stressed storage conditions, the 3001d and the 
3005a BIs shows partial degradation, which is not unexpected for proteins under these storage 
conditions. Analytical comparability has been established between 3001d / 3005a batches 
manufactured by Process 1 and Process 2 and the Process 1 batches are therefore used as supportive 
data for defining the shelf life of 3001d / 3005a BIs.

2.4.3.  Active substance 
2.4.3.1.  General information 
The active substance, epcoritamab (INN), is a bi-specific IgG1λκ antibody (bsAb) generated by a 
process called controlled Fab
arm exchange of the two parental antibodies, 3001d and 3005a. It is 
composed of two heavy chains and two light chains with a combined weight of 149 kDa. The two heavy 
‑
chains are bound to each other by two interchain disulfide bonds, and one light chain is attached to 
one heavy chain by a single interchain disulfide bond. Each light chain has two intrachain disulfide 
bonds, and the heavy chains have four intrachain disulfide bonds.  
Epcoritamab carries inertness mutations to silence Fc-mediated effector functions. It has 
characteristics typical of a human IgG1 antibody, including normal neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding 
and in vivo stability. 
Epcoritamab simultaneously binds to CD3 on T-cells and CD20 on malignant B-cells, inducing CD20-
specific T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Epcoritamab active substance is manufactured by Rentschler Biopharma Inc. (Milford, MA, USA) in 
accordance with GMP. Epcoritamab active substance manufacturing consists of thawing and pooling the 
biological intermediates, 3001d and 3005a, reduction and re-oxidation as well as a purification step. 
Multiple ultra/diafiltratration (UF/DF) steps are included in the process to remove process-related 
impurities and to concentrate the protein. Polysorbate 80 (PS80) is then added and the protein 
concentration is adjusted prior to filling into bags and freezing. All steps are performed at ambient 
temperature (18°C to 25°C), unless specified otherwise. All UF/DF membranes are single use. 
The scale of the manufacturing process is defined by the combined amounts of biological intermediates 
3001d and 3005a that goes into each batch of epcoritamab active substance. For one epcoritamab 
active substance batch, multiple batches of the individual BIs, 3001d and 3005a can be used. All BI 
batches used for epcoritamab active substance manufacturing must comply with the acceptance 
criteria for release. 
One filtered intermediate with a hold time is defined as justified by a stability assessment. Microbial 
control limits are in place for the in-process intermediates are tested (pre-filtration) for bioburden and 
bacterial endotoxins. Virus safety is controlled at the level of the BI’s as no cells are used for the 
manufacture of epcoritamab active substance. Lifecycles of the chromatography resin is qualified, all 
membranes and filters are single-use. Process parameter (PP) ranges and in-process controls (IPCs) 
are defined and justified as part of the overall control strategy. Reprocessing is allowed in the form of 
refiltration exclusively in the event of a post-use filter integrity test failure or a breach of system 
integrity.  
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Raw materials used in the manufacture of epcoritamab active substance are either of 
compendial grade or controlled to ensure the quality and safety of the active substance and to 
maintain the consistency of the manufacturing process. No human or animal derived materials are 
used in the active substance manufacturing process.

Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Classifications of attributes, controls, parameters and ranges used in the dossier are defined. Critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) were identified. Process characterization has identified that certain process 
steps can impact the CQAs of the product. The control of these critical steps is important for the 
control of the CQAs. A critical step is defined as a process step that contains critical process 
parameters (CPPs) or critical in-process controls (IPCs). If the acceptable criteria for a CPP or critical 
IPC are exceeded, a non-conformance is initiated, an investigation is performed and a batch could be 
rejected. The overall control strategy is considered adequate for control of the manufacturing process. 
Process validation 
The process validation strategy encompasses three stages: process design, process performance 
qualification (PPQ), and ongoing process verification. The PPQ campaign consisted of multiple 
consecutive batches manufactured at the commercial scale and process. The PPQ protocols included 
prospectively defined acceptance criteria consisting of numerical limits for process parameters and 
process controls and excursions from the acceptance criteria were evaluated for their impact on 
product quality. All PPQ lots met the proposed commercial active substance release specification 
acceptance criteria and demonstrated consistent performance of the active substance manufacturing 
process. The set of supportive process validation includes studies regarding: impurity clearance, in-
process product pool hold times, reuse of resin, and batch uniformity.  
An ongoing process verification program will monitor process performance using statistical analysis and 
trending and limits will be defined when enough data are available. 
Manufacturing process development 
During development, epcoritamab active substance was initially produced at smaller scale at clinical 
manufacturing site (Process 1) for clinical use. Polysorbate 80 (PS80) was added to the active 
substance formulation from Process 1 batches and onwards for GMP batches manufactured with both 
Process 1 and Process 2. The manufacturing process was later transferred to the commercial 
manufacturing site (Process 2). In addition, it was decided to manufacture the 5 mg/mL as part of the 
finished product process. The analytical methods were also transferred along with the process transfer 
from Process 1 to Process 2. 
Process 1 material and Process 2 are generally considered comparable. A comparability study was 
designed to assess the transfer from Process 1 to Process 2, this is considered adequately 
demonstrated. The analytical method transfer coinciding with the process transfer is considered 
adequately performed. 
Process characterization was performed to provide process understanding by establishing process 
parameter criticality, and setting appropriate acceptable ranges for process parameters and acceptance 
criteria for IPCs using qualified scale-down models, while the reduction and re-oxidation step are 
considered scale-independent. Individual process steps were characterized to determine acceptable 
ranges for process parameters with a combination of a multivariate approach using Design of 
Experiments (DoE), univariate experiments, or worst-case experiments. Process parameters that 
impact a CQA are scored to determine the classification (CPP or non-CPP) based on a pre-defined 
criterion. Overall, the proposed acceptable ranges and process parameter classifications can be 
considered well supported by development data. Worst-case studies confirm the criteria set during 
process characterization. Studies are presented that demonstrate the adequacy of refiltration and resin

Characterization 
Characterization of epcoritamab was performed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the 
biochemical, biophysical, and biological properties of the protein and a precise description of its quality 
attributes. State-of-the-art methods were used to evaluate properties that relate to the molecular 
primary, secondary, tertiary and higher order structures, molar absorption, post-translational 
modification, size and charge heterogeneity, functional characteristics, immunological properties, and 
thermal stability. The analytical results from multiple Process 2 batches are consistent with the 
proposed structure.  
The biological function of epcoritamab is binding to both CD3 and CD20, which has been characterized 
for batch 1079437. Co-engagement by epcoritamab of CD3 on T cells and CD20 on malignant B cells 
and resulting (CD4- and CD8-positive) T cell activation, and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity of CD20-
expressing B cells is demonstrated by three different bioassays. 
A deeper understanding of epcoritamab and the identification of CQAs has been obtained by isolation 
and characterization of size and charge variants, and forced degradation studies. Epcoritamab can be 
considered relatively stable, and significant reductions in biological activity are obtained for material 
that was subjected to testing.  
Consistent and efficient clearance of process-related impurities is demonstrated, which are present at 
low levels and consistent between batches. The process-related impurities in the biological 
intermediates 3001d and 3005a that can be carried into the epcoritamab active substance are 
controlled at the 3001d and 3005a manufacturing stage. 
The batch analysis results indicated the levels of product-related impurities are consistent across 
commercial process batches and the process is well controlled and robust. 
A summary of the risk evaluation for introducing leachables into epcoritamab finished product has been 
provided. The theoretical extractable concentrations are not a concern for patient safety. The 
information provided is sufficient and does not raise any further issues.  
2.4.3.3.  Specification 
Identity, quality and purity of each batch of epcoritamab active substance is assessed and confirmed 
according to the proposed specification. The following tests are included in the active substance 
specification: general tests, identity, purity, potency, protein, and safety. Tests were selected based on 
a detailed understanding of the CQAs of epcoritamab active substance. The active substance 
specification does not include a general test for osmolality, tests for process-related impurities, and 
oligosaccharide profiling. Osmolality is sufficiently controlled at the level of the finished product and the 
process-related impurities are consistently present at sufficiently low levels. Residual host cell proteins 
(HCP) is considered sufficiently controlled at the level of the BI’s and additional testing the active 
substance level is not necessary. A replacement of the current method for charge heterogeneity for 
release and stability testing of epcoritamab active substance will be implemented (recommendation).  
Commercial scale epcoritamab active substance batches have been taken into consideration for 
specification setting and justification, and stability data are used to set shelf life limits. The calculated 
clinical coverage of the proposed epcoritamab active substance specification acceptance criteria has 
been acceptably assessed.  
Analytical methods 
Method descriptions for all non-compendial analytical procedures are provided and validations are 
performed according to ICH Q2(R1). The compendial methods have been verified to demonstrate the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 20/209 
 
 
 
suitability for the intended purpose. Analytical procedures are described and validated according to the 
relevant guidelines.  
The biological activity of epcoritamab is determined in a surrogate T-cell activation assay and the 
biological activity of epcoritamab is reported as % relative potency relative to a reference standard. 
Batch analysis 
Batch information for all epcoritamab active substance 60 mg/mL batches is provided. All batch data 
were in line with the acceptance criteria at the time of testing. The results for batch release 
demonstrate a sufficient level of batch-to-batch consistency. 
Reference materials 
The epcoritamab active substance reference standards (RSs) follow a two-tiered approach with a 
primary RS (PRS) and a working RS (WRS), where the PRS is used to (re)qualify (new) WRSs. The RSs 
are adequately qualified and considered representative of the commercial product. The PRS and WRS 
are requalified biannually through the lifetime of the reference standard. Protocols for (re)qualification 
are provided and considered acceptable. 
Container closure system 
Epcoritamab active substance is stored in single use sterile bags. The bags meet the relevant 
requirements with regard to biological reactivity, microbial aspects, TSE and compatibility.  
2.4.3.4.  Stability 
Stability studies are being conducted on epcoritamab active substance batches manufactured to date in 
accordance with ICH stability guidelines. The stability studies are performed using containers from the 
same materials as the epcoritamab active substance container closure system but downscaled in size. 
Analytical comparability has been established between batches produced by Process 1 and by Process 
2 at the commercial facility. At the proposed long-term storage conditions, the stability-indicating 
parameters show no significant effect for 48 months. Under accelerated condition, little to no notable 
change was observed. Under stressed storage conditions, the epcoritamab active substance shows 
partial degradation, which is not unexpected for proteins under these storage conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed 
shelf life in the proposed container.  
2.4.4.  Finished medicinal product 
2.4.4.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Epcoritamab finished product is a sterile, preservative-free liquid supplied in a single dose vial.  
The epcoritamab finished product 5 mg/mL is a concentrate for solution for injection. Each vial contains 
4 mg of epcoritamab in 0.8 mL. It is diluted in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride to a final solution for 
subcutaneous injection.  
The epcoritamab finished product 60 mg/mL is a solution for subcutaneous injection. Each vial contains 
48 mg of epcoritamab in 0.8 mL. Other ingredients are: sodium acetate trihydrate, acetic acid, sorbitol 
(E420), polysorbate 80, and water for injections. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 21/209 
 
 
 
Each vial contains an overfill ensuring an extractable volume of ≥0.8 mL/vial. Epcoritamab finished 
product of both presentations have a pH of 5.5. 
The container closure system consists of a 2 mL clear type I glass vial, a fluoropolymer-coated rubber 
stopper and an aluminium cap with flip-off top. 
There are no overages included in the manufacture of the finished product. An overfill volume was 
applied to ensure that 0.8 mL can be extracted from the vial. Supportive data for the proposed overfill 
has been provided.  
Both presentations of epcoritamab finished product are intended for subcutaneous injection. The 
quality target product profile (QTPP) includes the criteria for identity, potency, purity, and 
physicochemical properties as these may affect the efficacy and safety of the finished product.  
The applicant presented the formulation development of the finished product, as well as results of a 
formulation screening study using a Design of Experiment (DoE) approach, a formulation robustness 
study also using a DOE approach, a DOE study to address the impact from freeze-thaw and a DOE 
study to address the impact from agitation stress. The robustness of the commercial formulation has 
sufficiently been shown. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles and agitation stress studies did not reveal any 
impact on epcoritamab physicochemical quality attributes. Photostability studies demonstrate that the 
finished product is light sensitive under ICH light conditions. Therefore, the finished product should be 
stored protected from light. 
The initial clinical manufacturing process for epcoritamab finished product was developed, described as 
Process 1. During development, the finished product manufacturing process was transferred to the 
commercial manufacturing facility and scaled up, described as Process 2. Finished product batches 
manufactured using Process 1 as well as a number of finished product batches using the full scale 
(commercial) process were used in the clinical studies GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04. Process changes 
to support commercial manufacturing (Process 2) have been adequately justified. To assess potential 
impact on product quality, release data and stability profiles of finished product batches manufactured 
with Process 1 and Process 2 were compared. All release results were comparable and met the 
comparability acceptance criteria. Overall, the stability profiles after storage for Process 2 batches are 
comparable to what has been observed for historical batches. On request, the applicant provided also 
results of additional characterization tests. These results further substantiate that process 1 and 
process 2 finished product batches are highly comparable.   
The finished product control strategy is based on CQA assessment and the manufacturing process 
impact on epcoritamab CQAs controlled during finished product manufacturing. In accordance with ICH 
guidelines the criticality of each attribute was evaluated based on impact and uncertainty level. The 
impact level was determined based on the potential impact on safety and efficacy of the product while 
the uncertainty level was determined based on the information and product understanding available at 
the time of the risk analysis (e.g., prior knowledge, analytical characterization and available literature). 
The finished product control strategy is part of an integrated control strategy which summarizes the 
complete list of epcoritamab CQAs and the stage where each CQA is controlled, including the 3001d 
and 3005a biological intermediates as well as epcoritamab active substance stages. Within each stage 
of manufacture, the CQAs potentially impacted by that stage were evaluated in a process impact 
assessment. Control ranges for process parameters were derived from process characterization studies 
or based on historical data and/or experience with comparable development programs. The identified 
critical process parameters (CPPs) and their control within established control ranges are one 
important control element of the control strategy. Overall, the approach of the applicant can be 
endorsed.

The primary packaging components used for epcoritamab finished product have been selected to 
ensure overall quality throughout the shelf life. The vial is a 2R type I glass vial suitable for liquid 
injectables. The stopper is made of bromobutyl rubber with a fluoropolymer foil. The closed vials are 
sealed with an aluminum/plastic flip-off cap. The compatibility of the container closure system has 
been demonstrated by long term stability studies of representative finished product batches.  
It was determined that the (diluted) finished product is compatible with a range of non-polar and 
weakly polar materials, representing commonly used ancillaries for preparation, dilution and 
subcutaneous administration of epcoritamab finished product.  Filtration of the product is not needed.  
The in-use stability study supported the in-use storage (24 hours at 2-8°C, whereof up to 12 hours 
may be at room temperature) when the preparation of the finished product is taking place in controlled 
and validated aseptic conditions. 
2.4.4.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Batch release of the finished product is performed by AbbVie S.r.l. (Campoverde, Italy) in accordance 
with GMP. 
The exact batch size is defined by the volume of the active substance available at the time of 
manufacture. Finished product manufacturing process consists of the thawing of active substance, 
compounding of bulk finished product, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, and visual inspection, All steps 
have been described in sufficient detail and acceptable ranges for CPPs and non-CPPS are provided. 
Process parameters and associated ranges are sufficiently justified by the studies described in the 
section on manufacturing process development section. Hold times and process times are defined and 
have been justified by validation studies performed during process development. 
A critical step is defined as a process step that contains CPPs or critical in-process controls IPCs. The 
data in the development section support the CPPs and critical IPCs or the CPPs/CIPCs are in line with 
current guidance and common practice. 
Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) was performed by manufacturing consecutive finished product 
batches at commercial scale. A bracketing approach was used. This is to conform to the EMA scientific 
advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/521927/2020) provided in October 2020. Process and hold times were not 
challenged, which is acceptable as these were already validated during manufacture of the primary 
(pre-PPQ) batches. Homogeneity of the formulation solution, formulated finished product solution and 
during filling (begin, middle, end of fill) were verified. Relevant quality attributes were determined in 
various steps of the manufacturing process and no changes were observed. In conclusion, multiple 
consecutive PPQ finished product batches were successfully manufactured. All process parameters 
were applied within the validation limits, and the pre-determined criteria for in-process controls and 
release specification were met for all batches. It is therefore demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of consistent production of epcoritamab finished product that meets the expected 
quality. 
2.4.4.3.  Product specification  
Finished Product specifications include tests for appearance, identity, purity and impurities, potency, 
content, general characteristics, and safety. The proposed panel of release tests is considered 
adequate to confirm the quality of the finished product provided. The applicant has adequately justified 
the absence of a test for protein oxidation.  
Assessment report

Analytical methods 
The analytical procedures include both compendial and non-compendial methods. The compendial 
methods were verified for their intended use in accordance with current editions of pharmacopeia’s. 
The non-compendial methods used for finished product are the same methods as those for the active 
substance release testing and the description and validation of these methods is provided in the active 
substance section. Proposed acceptance criteria are based on published limits (e.g. Pharmacopeia), a 
target limit approach based on the design or formulation robustness studies, a stability limit approach 
based on tolerance interval statistical analysis of release data in combination with prediction of shelf 
life changes, or an empirical limit approach. On request, the shelf-life limits for mass heterogeneity 
and charge heterogeneity have also been clinically justified. In addition, the applicant is recommended 
to implement a method for release and stability testing of finished product for charge heterogeneity 
(recommendation). 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data for epcoritamab finished product are provided for 5 mg/ml batches and 60 mg/ml 
batches. All batch analysis data comply with the specification at time of release and are considered 
sufficiently consistent.  
A risk assessment was performed to evaluate the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the 
finished product. The assessment concluded that the finished product manufacturing process is not at 
risk for the formation or introduction of nitrosamine impurities.  
A risk evaluation according to the ICH Q3D guideline was performed to assess the risks for introducing 
elemental impurities in epcoritamab finished product. To support the elemental impurities risk 
assessment, multiple batches were screened for a total of 10 elements. None of the elements were 
detected above the practical detection limit. 
Reference materials 
The reference standard used for epcoritamab finished product testing is the same as used for the 
epcoritamab active substance. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system for both presentations consists of a 2 mL clear type I glass vial, a 
fluoropolymer-coated rubber stopper and an aluminium cap with flip-off top. Vial and stopper comply 
with Ph. Eur. quality standards. 
2.4.4.4.  Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 24 months at 2°C to 8°C is proposed. This is supported by long term data (2 – 8°C) of a 
number of 5 mg/ml and 60 mg/ml batches from Process 1 and Process 2.  Stability data were supplied 
for both vials stored in the upright position and vials stored in the inverted position. 
During long term storage (2-8°C) no notable changes were observed for appearance, mass, charge 
and size heterogeneity, biological activity, protein concentration, pH, polysorbate 80 and subvisible 
particles. Container closure integrity met the acceptance criteria. 
At accelerated condition slight change in the mass, size and charge heterogeneity was observed. At 
stress condition these changes were more pronounced and a decrease of potency was also observed at 
this condition. No notable changes were observed for the other attributes under accelerated or stress 
condition.

Photostability studies demonstrate that the finished product is light sensitive under ICH light 
conditions. Therefore, the product should be stored protected from light. 
In conclusion, real-time/real temperature data are available for multiple 5 mg/ml batches and 60 
mg/ml batches (process 1). These batches are considered sufficiently representative of that will be 
used for commercial manufacturing (process 2) and show comparable stability trends at long term 
storage condition as primary (process 2) stability batches. Sufficient results are now available in 
support of the proposed storage conditions and expiration dating period.  
The proposed finished product shelf life of 2 years at 2-8°C is considered acceptable.   
The SmPC states the in-use stability requirements according to the guideline text: Chemical and 
physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2-8°C including up to 12 hours at room 
temperature (20-25°C). 
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer 
than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic 
conditions. 
2.4.4.5.  Adventitious agents 
The intermediates 3001d and 3005a are produced using CHO host cell lines. No animal-derived raw 
materials are used in the manufacture. 
The adventitious agent safety evaluation for the 3001d and 3005a biological intermediates 
manufacturing process covers non-viral and viral adventitious agents. An integrated approach including 
prevention, detection, and removal is followed to ensure viral safety. The prevention aspect involves 
careful sourcing of raw materials to prevent adventitious agents and BSE/TSE agents from entering 
upstream processes. Virus and other adventitious agents were tested for unprocessed bulk harvest and 
the MCB, WCB, and End of Production Cells (EPC) at the limit of in vitro cell age for both 3001d and 
3005a in accordance with the ICH Guideline Q5A(R1). The virus clearance study demonstrated that the 
3001d and 3005a manufacturing processes employ a robust and orthogonal virus clearance for a wide 
range of viruses. 
The effectiveness of the 3001d and 3005a purification process to remove or inactivate viruses has 
been studied, which provided a quantitative estimate of the level of virus reduction or inactivation 
across different steps of the purification process.  
Overall, an integrated approach to ensure adventitious agent safety was demonstrated for the 
manufacture processes of 3001d, 3005a and epcoritamab active substance. 
The applicant has calculated the estimated retrovirus particles per dose of 48 mg 3001d or 3005a 
based on the cumulative minimum reduction factors.  
2.4.5.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023

During the procedure questions were identified (relating to intermediate and active substance process 
descriptions, comparability, characterisation, and active substance/finished product process validation 
specification and stability) which have been adequately addressed.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, a minor unresolved quality issue remains. This issue has no impact 
on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product and concerns the replacement of the current method for charge 
heterogeneity with a method for release and stability testing of active substance and finished product. 
This point is put forward and agreed as recommendation for future quality development.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.7.  Recommendation for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following point for investigation: 
• 
to implement a method for release and stability testing of active substance and finished 
product for charge heterogeneity. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Epcoritamab is a full-length IgG1 bispecific antibody recognizing CD3 and CD20. It triggers potent T-
cell-mediated killing of CD20-expressing cells and is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of 
adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Mutations were 
introduced in the Fc domain of the parental antibodies to obtain a silenced Fc region that does not bind 
to IgG Fc receptors (FcγR) and the complement component C1q leading to reduced CDC, and to retain 
the binding to FcRn in order to maintain a relatively long plasma half-life. Research grade batches of 
epcoritamab (DuoBody-CD3xCD20) used in non-clinical pharmacology studies were comparable to 
clinical grade batch (NBL0190-29-01) used in the pivotal GLP toxicity study. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
 In vitro studies showed that epcoritamab binds in a concentration-dependent manner to cell surface-
expressed CD3 on freshly isolated, CD20-negative, human healthy donor T cells with EC50 of 4.73 nM. 
EC50  values  were  in  the  same  range  for  CD4+  or  CD8+  primary  T  cells.  The  affinity  (dissociation 
constant,  KD)  of  epcoritamab  for  soluble  CD3ε  was  12.5  nM.  Epcoritamab  was  shown  to  bind  in  a 
concentration-dependent  manner  to  cell  surface-expressed  CD20  on  human  Burkitt´s  lymphoma  B 
cells  (Daudi  cells)  with  the  EC50  of  10.40  nM.  EC50  values  of  the  same  range  were  observed  using 
CD20-transfected,  CD3-negative  HEK-CD20  cells.  Epcoritamab  was  capable  of  simultaneously  binding 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 26/209 
 
 
 
to  CD3-expressing  T  cells  (both  CD4+  and  CD8+)  and  CD20-expressing  B  cells  in  whole  blood  in 
concentration-dependent  manner.  Concentrations  at  which  T-cell  activation  and  cytotoxicity  by 
epcoritamab were first observed (EC20) were in the very low picomolar range and those at which half-
maximal  T-cell  activation  and  cytotoxicity  were  observed  (EC50)  were  in  the  low  picomolar  range 
(Table 14). Epcoritamab could induce potent cytotoxicity when binding was suboptimal.

In vitro cross-reactivity of epcoritamab to CD20 from non-human species has been evaluated by using 
HEK293F cell lines transfected with human, cynomolgus monkey, dog, rabbit, pig, rat or mouse CD20. 
Human expressed CD20 was used as positive control. Only CD20 from cynomolgus monkeys and 
rabbits interacted with epcoritamab, showing dose-dependent binding. The binding EC50 values of 
epcoritamab to cynomolgus monkey and human CD20 were comparable. Similarly, comparable binding 
affinities were determined for human and cynomolgus monkey CD3 using T-cell lines (Jurkat [human] 
and HSC-F [cynomolgus monkey]). No cross-reactivity to CD3 from other non-human species is 
expected according to submitted literature data (Conrad 2007, Cytometry). It is acceptable that 
epcoritamab is not likely to bind to CD3 of other species than cynomolgus monkeys. Based on this, it is 
considered well justified that cynomolgus monkey is the only relevant nonclinical species to predict 
epcoritamab PD/PK response when tested in humans. 
Three mutations were introduced into the Fc region to abrogate Fc-mediated effector functions in order 
to render epcoritamab highly selective towards cytotoxic CD3-expressing T-cells. The inertness of the 
Fc region of the epcoritamab was demonstrated in in vitro binding and functional assays. In vitro 
binding studies showed that epcoritamab did not bind to human FcγRI, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIa-131H/R and 
FcγRIIIa-158F/V constructs, in contrast to IgG1-ctrl and IgG1-CD20-K409R, which do not contain the 
inertness mutations in the Fc region. Epcoritamab showed in vitro minimal C1q binding and reduced 
capacity to induce CDC in CD20-positive cells at clinically relevant concentrations (7% relative to IgG1-
CD20). 
Binding to FcRn is not affected by the mutations in the Fc region. Epcoritamab showed dose-dependent 
binding to human FcRn at pH 6.0 (Kd 36.7 nM) that was comparable to wild type IgG1, whereas no 
Assessment report

binding was observed at pH 7.4. In support to this, plasma concentrations over a timeframe of 21 days 
and plasma clearance rate of surrogate test compounds, IgG1-CD3*-F405L-FEA and IgG1-CD3*-F405L, 
were comparable in immunodeficient tumour-free mice, indicating that target independent plasma 
clearance of antibodies is not affected by the Fc inertness mutations. 
Cytotoxicity 
The capacity of epcoritamab to induce target mediated T-cell activation, T-cell proliferation and T-cell 
mediated cytotoxicity was investigated in several in vitro studies in the presence of CD20-expressing 
cells (endogenous human B cells and several cell lines derived from different types of B-cell lymphoma, 
including DLBCL subtype). CD20-expressing cells were cultivated with CD3+ T cells (Jurkat T cells or 
freshly isolated human peripheral blood T cells) and different concentrations of epcoritamab. It was 
shown that epcoritamab mediated dose-dependent activation of CD4+and CD8+ T cells in the presence 
of CD20-expressing Daudi cells as well as potent dose-dependent T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity towards 
Daudi cells, with the CD8+ T cells apparently more potent than CD4+ T cells (Table 1). Moreover, 
CD8+T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity was reached after 3 h, whereas cytotoxicity mediated by CD4+ T 
cells was observed only after 24 h. Similar results were obtained in the panel of CD20+ cell lines 
derived from different subtypes types of B-cell lymphoma origin, including activated B-cell-diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), germinal center B-cell-diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL). There was no relation between CD20 cell surface expression and cytotoxicity. 
Epcoritamab could induce potent cytotoxicity when binding was suboptimal. Further, in co-cultures of 
T- and B-cells or in PBMCs containing T- and B-cells, the B-cell killing was completely dependent on the 
binding of both CD3 and CD20 by the epcoritamab, because the absence of a CD20-binding arm 
(DuoBody-CD3xctrl) or absence of a CD3 binding arm (DuoBody-ctrlxCD20) abrogated T-cell-mediated 
killing of CD20 expressing B cells. Target dependent cytotoxicity was confirmed by using target cells 
not expressing CD20 such as SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. The viability of SK-BR-3 cells not expressing 
CD20 remained unaffected at epcoritamab concentrations up to 1mg/ml. Further, the capacity of 
epcoritamab to induce cytotoxicity in primary malignant cells was analysed ex-vivo in a panel of lymph 
node and bone marrow biopsies (total of 37 samples) obtained from patients with different 
malignancies, including DLBCL, FL and MCL, in the presence of healthy donor- or patient-derived 
PBMCs. Epcoritamab induced dose-dependent response of DLBCL, FL and MCL patient samples, in the 
presence of healthy donor PBMCs while patient-derived T cells were functionally able to mediate 
epcoritamab-induced cytotoxicity but was dependent on the number of T cells present in the samples.  
Epcoritamab was functionally active in PBMC populations of cynomolgus monkey origin, where dose-
dependent induction of T-cell activation (EC50 values of 0.1273 pM for CD4+ and 0.0347 pM for CD8+ 
T-cells) and cytotoxicity (EC50 value of 0.0093 pM) were observed. Based on comparable binding of 
epcoritamab to human and cynomolgus monkey CD3 and CD20 and comparable in vitro pharmacology 
of epcoritamab in human and cynomolgus monkey PBMC populations, cynomolgus monkey was 
selected as the relevant species for nonclinical safety evaluation of epcoritamab. 
The influence of the standard first-line therapies (R-CHOP- rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin and prednisone) in DLBCL on the efficacy of epcoritamab was studied in 
vitro (CHOP) as well as ex-vivo and in vivo (rituximab). In vitro T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity assays were performed after pre-incubation of T cells (isolated from healthy donors) or B 
cells (human NHL B-cell line SU-DHL-4) with the CHOP components. The results showed that 
doxorubicin dose-dependently reduced T-cell viability and strongly affected epcoritamab-induced CD4+ 
and CD8+ T-cell activation while oncovin and prednisone slightly affected T-cell activation. 
Nevertheless, epcoritamab-induced T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity of B cells was not strongly affected in 
the presence of CHOP, except at high doxorubicin concentration. An in vivo study was performed in 
NOD-SCID mice inoculated with a mixture of human unstimulated PBMCs and Raji-luc cells. The 
presence of up to 10 mg/kg circulating rituximab (IgG1-RTX-FEAR with silenced Fc-mediated effector

functions to ensure that anti-tumour activity observed in this study could be attributed to epcoritamab 
and not rituximab), did not hamper anti-tumour activity of epcoritamab towards malignant B cells in 
vivo. This was also confirmed by studies ex-vivo using biopsies derived from B-NHL patients previously 
treated by rituximab. In conclusion, in the experimental set-up reported by the applicant, no clinically 
relevant effect of first-line therapeutics on the effect of epcoritamab were seen. However, if these 
experiments are representative of the clinical situation is not completely clear, as long lasting effects 
on B-cells and bone marrow are possible after treatment with R-CHOP, even when the components are 
no longer in circulation. 
In vivo efficacy 
The anti-tumour activity of IV administered epcoritamab was assessed in vivo using three different B-
cell lymphoma xenograft (CDX) models and one DLBCL PDX model and different types of humanized 
mice. Epcoritamab delayed growth of CD20+ tumour in all tested mouse models, however not always 
in a dose-dependent manner. Epcoritamab also delayed tumour growth in mice with a human immune 
system (HIS) inoculated IV with Daudi- and SC with Raji cells, respectively, whereas bsAb-CD3xctrl, 
that lacks the CD20-specific arm, did not. Further, epcoritamab, but not bsAb-CD3xctrl, also 
significantly reduced the number of human B cells in the peripheral blood of mice, as was determined 
on day 9. Interestingly, bsAb-ctrlxCD20 that lacks the CD3-specific arm, induced some anti-tumour 
activity and some human B-cell depletion in peripheral blood in Raji-luc xenograft model using BRGS-
HIS mice, however this treatment did not significantly prolong survival of the mice compared to PBS 
group. Peripheral blood human T-cell numbers were affected by epcoritamab treatment, but not by 
treatment with DuoBody-CD3xctrl or DuoBody-ctrlxCD20. On day 4 (one day after the first 
administration of epcoritamab), T-cell numbers appeared to be decreased compared to the PBS-treated 
group at the same day, an observation that was significant for CD4+ T cells in mice treated with 0.1 or 
1 mg/kg. Five days later, on day 9, T-cell numbers were increased compared to the PBS-treated group, 
an observation that was significant for CD8+ T cells in mice treated with 1 mg/kg epcoritamab. After 
day 9, T-cell numbers returned to pre-treatment values, and did not change in response to the later 
administrations of epcoritamab. In Burkitt’s lymphoma CDX model (Raji cells) using NSG mice with 
human immune system, low doses (0.05 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg) appear to have a delayed but strong 
effect, whereas high dose (5 mg/kg) has an immediate but less strong effect. 
The anti-tumour activity of IV administered epcoritamab was also evaluated in vivo in HIS mice that 
were implanted SC human tumour biopsy material (DLBCL patient-derived xenograft model). The 
model closely relates the target indication. Epcoritamab effectively delayed tumour growth only at the 
highest tested dose (5 mg/kg) which was reflected in prolonged progression-free survival. Efficacy 
appears to be transient however, as tumour volume increases before the last dose is given. There were 
three sudden deaths in mice treated with 5 mg/kg epcoritamab. The early deaths were associated with 
body weight loss > 20%, and the relationship to epcoritamab treatment remained unclear but is likely, 
and could be related to cytokine release. 
Pharmacologic effects consistent with the mode of action of epcoritamab, including depletion of 
peripheral blood B cells and cytokine release were also observed in the toxicity study in cynomolgus 
monkeys in vivo. Single injection of epcoritamab, administered IV or SC, induced a dose-dependent 
depletion of B cells from peripheral blood and lymph nodes. B-cell depletion was reversible at all dose 
levels. The high SC single dose of 10 mg/kg showed longer recovery time of the B cells in comparison 
to the lower dose of 1 mg/kg. Efficiency of B-cell depletion was comparable after SC and IV 
administration of epcoritamab (see toxicology section).

2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The immunogenicity of humanised CD3-specific Fab arm and the Fc region of epcoritamab has been 
evaluated by in silico and in vitro cell-based modelling approaches, i.e. in silico EpiMatrix system and in 
vitro EpiScreen cell-based assay. The immunogenicity of the CD3 arm and Fc region of IgG1-CD3-FEAL 
is predicted to be low and in the range of other therapeutic antibodies that have been found in the 
clinic to be non-immunogenic. The use of in silico EpiMatrix system and in vitro EpiScreen cell-based 
assay is considered of high impact for the estimation of risk for clinical immunogenicity since the 
predictivity of animal studies for evaluation of immunogenicity in humans is considered low 
[EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1]. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No specific safety pharmacology studies have been conducted with epcoritamab. Effects on the central 
nervous, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems were evaluated in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity 
study in cynomolgus monkeys. Heart rate and RR, PR, QRS and QT intervals on Day 8 and 22 
(repeated IV dosing) or Day 1 (single IV or SC dosing) were unaffected by treatment. Slightly 
uncoordinated movements observed after SC dosing, were transient and were considered related to 
elevated cytokine concentrations and were consistent with other clinical findings, such as decreased 
activity and hunched posture (see toxicology section). 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No dedicated PD drug interaction studies were performed with epcoritamab. The potential interaction 
between epcoritamab and first-line therapy compounds (R-CHOP, i.e. R-CHOP- rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin and prednisone), in case the patients who fail to 
respond to first-line therapies would still have these medicines present in the circulation, has been 
assessed as part of the primary pharmacology. It was determined that there was a low risk for 
pharmacodynamic interaction with first-line therapeutics of DLBCL. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicokinetics (TK) of epcoritamab were assessed as part of the 
exploratory, dose-range finding (DRF) and GLP single- and repeat-dose toxicology studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys with epcoritamab. Epcoritamab binds comparably to both, human and 
cynomolgus monkey CD3 and CD20, is pharmacologically active in cynomolgus monkey cells in vitro, 
and does not cross-react with rodent, pig, dog CD3 and CD20, thus confirming suitability of 
cynomolgus monkeys as the most reliable in vivo model for the in vivo toxicology studies, including 
PK/TK evaluations of epcoritamab. The studies were performed by the intravenous and subcutaneous 
route of administration and the latter is the intended clinical route of epcoritamab administration. 
Method validation 
Various analytical methods were developed and validated or qualified for detection of either 
epcoritamab or anti-epcoritamab antibodies in non-clinical studies. Initial non-GLP exploratory and 
dose-finding toxicology studies were supported by fit-for-purpose exploratory/qualified bioanalytical 
methods, while the bioanalytical methods supporting GLP-compliant toxicology study (Study No. 
503484) were conducted in compliance with the OECD principles of GLP. The methods developed to 
measure epcoritamab and anti-epcoritamab antibodies in cynomolgus monkey plasma in the pivotal 
GLP toxicology study have been validated in accordance with relevant guidance documents 
(EMA/CHMP/ICH/172948/2019, EMEA/CHMP/114720/09, EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/06). The single

molecule counting (SMC) method for detection of epcoritamab in cynomolgus monkey plasma was 
validated across a calibration range of 0.100 ng/ml to 50 ng/mL with an additional validated dilution 
factor of 1:2000, thus samples with a concentration up to 100 000 ng/mL in neat plasma could be 
quantified with this method. Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) using SMC method was investigated in 
the GLP-compliant study (Study No. 503484). Overall ISR results were well within criteria (81.4% of 
the samples had the absolute relative difference ≤30.0%) which is in line with relevant guidance 
(EMA/CHMP/ICH/172948/2019) for ligand-binding assays. The stability of epcoritamab at QC levels in 
frozen matrix (-70°C) was demonstrated for up to 196 days. The maximum storage period between 
first blood sampling and last sample preparation was 189 days. 
Levels of ADA in plasma samples of cynomolgus monkeys in the GLP 5-week toxicity study were 
assessed based on validated bridging ECLIA assay. The validated anti-epcoritamab bridging ECLIA 
assay had sensitivity of 31.9 ng/mL for CD20 and 78.1 ng/ml for CD3. Positive control CD20 was used 
in bioanalysis. In this assay it was possible to detect low positive control CD20 (100 ng/mL) in the 
presence of up to 15.6 mg/ml of epcoritamab. In the GLP pilot study (Study No. 503484), plasma 
concentrations of epcoritamab at the time of ADA determination were below this drug tolerance 
threshold. 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics in cynomolgus monkeys following subcutaneous administration of epcoritamab 
was described by dose-dependent kinetics, target-mediated drug elimination, delayed Tmax (3-7 days) 
and concentration dependent half-life of epcoritamab which is comparable to that observed in adult 
LBCL patients. 
Single IV/SC dose 
In the pivotal GLP toxicity study (Study No. 503484) in cynomolgus monkeys, the bioavailability of 
epcoritamab based on mean AUC(0-inf) was 85% and 49% in males and females, respectively, after 
single SC dose compared to single IV dosing at 1 mg/kg. At this dose, the peak plasma concentration 
was 10- to 17-fold lower after SC compared to IV dosing. The exposure AUC(0-t) was comparable after 
SC and IV. As expected, Tmax was delayed and occurred approximately 3 days in males and 3-7 days 
in females after SC-dosing compared to IV-dosing with Tmax 30 min after dosing. Following IV infusion, 
concentrations increased up to the end of the 30-minute dosing period and then decreased in a 
generally bi-phasic manner (Figure 3). After SC dosing, a more prolonged increase was observed up to 
a peak approximately 72 hours post dose and the concentration remained at a relatively steady level 
up to 168 hours and thereafter concentrations decreased in a mono-phasic manner up to the end of 
the 4-week sampling period (Figure 4). No consistent sex related differences in systemic exposure 
were noted following IV administration. However, exposure to epcoritamab was greater in males than 
females at 0.1 mg/kg and comparable at 1 and 10 mg/kg following SC administration.

Figure 1: Mean plasma concentrations (±SD) against time after a single IV dose of 
epcoritamab at 0.1 or 1 mg/kg 
Figure 2: Mean plasma concentrations (±SD) against time after a single SC dose of 
epcoritamab at 0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg 
Epcoritamab displayed dose-dependent kinetics either following IV or SC single-dose administration to 
male and female cynomolgus monkeys. Systemic exposure to epcoritamab increased in a generally 
greater than dose-proportional manner between 0.1 and 1 mg/kg following IV administration, and 
between 0.1 and 10 mg/kg following SC administration, in both males and females. Accordingly, 
clearance appeared to decrease with higher dose as estimated in single dose study with IV 
administration of epcoritamab: clearance estimates were 518±442 ml/day/kg and 578±124 ml/day/kg 
in male and female animals dosed at 0.1 mg/kg, but 39.1±1.42 ml/day/kg and 29.0 ml/day/kg for 
male and female animals dosed at 1 mg/kg. These differences in clearance levels at different dose 
levels after IV administration could be attributed to differences in impact of target-mediated clearance 
and ADA-formation observed (i.e. higher ADA-formation and TMDD clearance at low dose (0.1 
mg/kg)). Further, t1/2 of IV administered epcoritamab was estimated to be 2.0±1.1 days and 
1.4±0.18 days for male and female animals when dosed at 0.1 mg/kg, and 4.1±1.1 days and 5.2 days 
for male and female animals when dosed at 1 mg/kg. Following SC single-dose administration to 
cynomolgus monkeys, t1/2 estimated to be 2.6±1.4 and 2.3±1.1 days in male and female animals at 1 
mg/kg, and 4.3±2.7 and 6.0±1.0 days in male and female animals at 10 mg/kg dose. These data 
confirm a relatively long half-life of epcoritamab. Volume of distribution (Vss) was determined from IV 
single-dose study with epcoritamab and was estimated 1060±700 ml/kg and 1160±397 ml/kg in male 
and female animals dosed at 0.1 mg/kg, and 233±71.9 ml/kg and 226 ml/kg in male and female 
animals dosed at 1 mg/kg. Vss-values were greater than estimated plasma volume of cynomolgus 
monkeys, most likely due to specific binding of epcoritamab to its target cells (Table 15, Table 16).

Repeat IV dose 
The PK/TK evaluations in repeat dose study were performed only after intravenous administration of 
epcoritamab. In the pivotal 5-week GLP toxicity study (Study No. 503484: IV administration once 
weekly for 5 weeks at dose levels of 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg, n=6-10/group), ADA-formation was 
observed in all animals dosed at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg on Days 15 and 29 which greatly impacted 
plasma exposure, thus PK parameters could not be determined beyond the second dose. When animals 
were dosed at 1 mg/kg, ADA was detected in only 1 of 10 animals on day 15, and in 3 of 10 animals 
on day 22 and onward. At 1 mg/kg repeat IV dose, exposure was maintained for the duration of the 
study in the majority of animals and it was comparable between males and females. Systemic 
exposure to epcoritamab was greater after weekly dosing on days 15 and 29 compared to that after a 
single dose in males and females. A moderate accumulation of the drug was observed after multiple 
dosing resulting in day 29/day 1 accumulation ratios of 3.5 and 2.6 for males and females, respectively, 
which suggests less impact of target-mediated clearance over time. No significant change in Cmax was 
noted with repeat dosing; Days 15 and 29/Day 1 ratios of Cmax ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 (Table 17).

Table 4: Summary of epcoritamab TK parameters 
ADA-formation and impact on non-clinical exposure parameters 
Generally, across PK/TK studies in cynomolgus monkeys, ADA were formed following single- and 
repeat-dosing of epcoritamab which in some animals affected exposure, especially at doses ≤ 0.1 
mg/kg following IV administration or at doses ≤ 1 mg/kg following s.c. administration. As such, it 
appeared that a dose of 1 mg/kg (IV) or higher (SC) was needed to prevent high frequency ADA 
development and thereby maintain drug exposure in long-term studies (up to 43 days). In the 
presence of ADA exposure levels of epcoritamab plasma concentrations from low dose groups (0.01 
and 0.1 mg/mL) were appreciably low or non-quantifiable from day 15 or 22 onward, indicating faster 
clearance of test item due to ADAs. Therefore, animals which were ADA positive following repeat 
dosing were excluded from the PK/TK evaluation. Thus, ADA formation did not have impact on the 
interpretation of the PK data derived from 5-week IV repeat-dose toxicity study. 
Distribution, metabolism, excretion 
No  distribution,  metabolism  or  excretion  studies  were  performed  with  epcoritamab.  Specifically,  IgG 
monoclonal  antibody  is  expected  to  be  degraded  to  small  peptides  and  individual  amino  acids  which 
are  then  used  by  the  body  or  excreted  in  urine,  and  no  urinary  or  renal  excretion  of  monoclonal 
antibody is anticipated due to its molecular size. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Non-clinical PK drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab. This is 
acceptable since catabolic pathways of mAb are not likely to be impacted by co-administered small-
molecule medications. However, elevation of certain proinflammatory cytokines by epcoritamab may 
suppress CYP450 enzyme activities and should be taken into consideration

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
In cynomolgus monkeys, single-dose IV and SC exploratory studies of epcoritamab were conducted to 
evaluate toxicokinetics (TK), tolerability, and reversibility of any potential toxicity. All findings following 
single dosing in the non-GLP studies in cynomolgus monkeys were reversible and were associated with 
the pharmacological action of epcoritamab, specifically related to acute phase reaction due to cytokine 
release and the depletion of lymphocyte B cell populations. All animals in the single dose studies 
developed ADA. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
 The potential toxicity and toxicokinetics of epcoritamab when administered to cynomolgus monkeys by 
single (0.1, 1 mg/kg) or 5 weekly (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1 mg/kg) IV infusions or two monthly SC (0.1, 1.0, 10 
mg/kg) injection was addressed in the pivotal GLP study (503484). Reversibility after 6 weeks recovery 
was evaluated at 1 mg/kg IV repeat dose.  
In the non-GLP DRF study (501775), there were two unscheduled euthanasias in the SC dose groups. 
One female in the 1 mg/kg group had diarrhoea, dehydration, decreased lymphoid cellularity in thymus 
and spleen and was in poor general condition (sacrificed on Day 135). Second female in 20 mg/kg 
group had severe anaemia and was sacrificed on Day 57. Based on the findings, dose levels of 1 mg/kg 
IV and 10 mg/kg SC were chosen as high doses for repeated administration in the GLP study. Cytokine 
analyses indicated increases in TNF α, and IL-15 plasma concentrations, with dose-dependent 
increases in IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IFN γ following either intravenous or subcutaneous 
administration. Cytokine release was observed at all dose levels, occurring primarily after the first dose, 
and returning to baseline levels within 24 hours postdose. Notably, IV administration of a priming dose 
(0.01 mg/kg) on Day 1 followed by a dose of 1 mg/kg on Day 2 was associated with much lower levels 
of cytokine release. Also, peak levels for most cytokines at a comparable dose were generally lower 
following SC administration relative to IV administration. 
In the pivotal study, the IV administration of epcoritamab once weekly for 5 weeks at dose levels of 
0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg to cynomolgus monkeys was associated with changes in haematology and 
alterations in lymphocyte B-cell subpopulations at all dose levels. Overall, toxicity findings are 
consistent with T-cell activation and cytokine release, as well as findings secondary to cytokine release 
like clinical signs (decreased activity, hunched posture, emesis), acute phase reactions, and changes in 
leukocyte trafficking (activation and redistribution). Decreased lymphoid cellularity was recorded in the 
white pulp follicles of the spleen, lymph node follicles and GALT at ≥0.1 mg/kg. There was evidence of 
ongoing recovery of findings during the 6-week post dose observation period. One animal was 
euthanized at 1 mg/kg, due to poor general condition associated with elevated cytokines. A monthly 
SC administration of epcoritamab at dose levels of up to 10 mg/kg was well tolerated and associated 
with haematology changes and alterations in lymphocyte subpopulations observed at all dose levels. 
Decreased lymphoid cellularity was recorded in the white pulp follicles of the spleen, lymph node 
follicles and GALT at 1 or 10 mg/kg. There were no local injection reactions. 
One female in 1 mg/kg IV dose group was euthanized 13 hours after a single dose. The symptoms 
(decreased activity, hunched posture, subdued and weak) were considered to be related to elevated 
cytokines and were regarded as an adverse reaction to the treatment. Vomiting, hunched posture and 
decreased activity were observed after the first IV and SC doses and generally resolved after 12-24 
hours. After SC dosing, isolated cases of generalized reddened skin on the body surface were reported 
4-12 hours post dose in males at all dose levels and females at 0.1 or 1 mg/kg. Slightly uncoordinated

movements were observed at 6 or 12 hours post dose in males at 0.1 or 10 mg/kg and in females at 
1.0 or 10 mg/kg. No similar sign was observed in IV groups. These signs were not observed at dosing 
Day 29 and resolved without intervention after 12 hours. 
Heart rate and RR, PR, QRS and QT intervals on Day 8 and 22 (repeated IV dosing) or Day 1 (single IV 
or SC dosing), and body weights were unaffected by treatment. 
Single IV administration performed in the same pivotal repeat dose study, showed high total leukocyte, 
lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil counts on Day 8 in males at 0.1 or 1 mg/kg. Similarly, 
high total leukocyte and lymphocyte counts on Days 15 and 22 in males and females at 0.1 or 1 mg/kg 
and eosinophil counts on Day 15 in males and females at 0.1 or 1 mg/kg. Counts were considered 
similar to pretreatment values on Days 29 and 36. Slightly lower haemoglobin concentrations and 
haematocrits were observed on Days 8 and 15 in males at 1 mg/kg. 
There were no epcoritamab-related gross findings or organ weight changes. Histopathology evaluation 
identified decreased lymphoid cellularity observed in the spleen, lymph nodes and GALT. Both IV and 
SC routes of administration were well tolerated with no epcoritamab-related histopathological changes 
at the sites of administration. 
The highest cytokine levels were observed after the first dose, and cytokine release was dose 
dependent. However, two individual animals’ responses in the repeat intermediate dose group 
appeared to be different from the other group responses for several analytes (IL-12p40, IL-15, IL-1β, 
IL-4 and TNF-α), with cytokine release happening only after the second weekly dose. The reasons for 
that are unclear but might point to variations in cytokine release in monkeys. 
Interspecies comparison 
In the pivotal 5-week study (503484), the NOAEL in the IV repeat dosing group was 0.1 mg/kg, while 
the NOAEL in the SC dosing group was 10 mg/kg. At the highest IV dose of 1 mg/kg, the exposure in 
males and females was the same as the clinical AUC0-t at steady state. At the highest SC dose of 10 
mg/kg, the exposure margins in males and females were 5x the clinical AUC0-t at steady state. At the 
highest IV dose of 1 mg/kg, the exposure margins in males and females were 8x to 6x the clinical 
Cmax at steady state, respectively. At the highest SC dose of 10 mg/kg, the exposure margins in 
males and females were 8x and 7x the clinical Cmax at steady state (see Table 18).

2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
In accordance with ICH S6 (R1) and ICH S9 guideline no information has been submitted on the 
genotoxic potential of epcoritamab. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
In accordance with ICH S6 (R1) and ICH S9 guideline no information has been submitted on the 
carcinogenic potential of epcoritamab. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
 Male and female fertility was investigated as part of the 5-week GLP study in sexually mature 
cynomolgus monkeys. There were no epcoritamab-related macroscopic or microscopic pathologic 
findings in the male or female reproductive organs. In line with the ICH S9 guideline, no dedicated 
studies investigating the effect of epcoritamab on fertility and early embryonic development (FEED) or 
pre- and postnatal toxicology (PPND) were performed. Human IgG1 antibodies are known to cross the 
placenta through binding to the FcRn. Animal studies with other agents targeting CD20 (rituximab, 
ofatumumab) have shown non-teratogenic effects on offspring (immunosuppression, perinatal death 
due to infections). Furthermore, cytokines are important for establishing and maintaining pregnancy in 
a stage-dependent fashion, therefore the CD3+ T-cell-dependent effects of epcoritamab may further 
contribute to foetal losses. Additionally, aberrant B-cell numbers and functions have been associated 
with obstetric complications, including growth restriction, pre-eclampsia and pregnancy induced 
hypertension. It can therefore be considered that epcoritamab has the potential to be transmitted from 
the pregnant mother to the developing foetus, and that foetal exposure to epcoritamab may cause 
adverse developmental outcomes, such as B-cell lymphocytopenia and alterations in normal immune 
responses in infants exposed in utero. Based on the above information, an EFD study can be waived. 
It is not known whether or to what extent epcoritamab is excreted in human milk. Because IgGs are 
known to be present in milk prevailingly during the first few days after birth and can be transferred to 
neonates in this time period, it is also likely that neonatal exposure to epcoritamab may occur via 
lactational transfer only in the first few days after birth. However, due to the long half-life of 
epcoritamab and potential local GI tract effects in the suckling child, a waiting period of 4 months is 
justified. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data collected during the pivotal toxicity study is described in the section on 
Pharmacokinetics. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 37/209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was evaluated as part of the single or repeat dose studies following IV or SC 
administration in cynomolgus monkeys. No changes were observed that would indicate local 
intolerance. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
The potential for generation of antibodies to epcoritamab was assessed in the single- and repeat-dose 
studies, and epcoritamab had high potential for immunogenicity in cynomolgus monkeys. However, in 
the  pivotal  study,  only  few  animals  in  the  high  IV  and  SC  dose  groups  (1  mg/kg  IV;  10  mg/kg  SC) 
developed ADA by the end of the study. In these dose groups, high exposures were maintained in most 
animals until Day 29. 
In the cytokine release assay, the cytokines released with the clearest trend in concentration-response 
included IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFNγ, and TNFα. 
Epcoritamab was non-haemolytic in a human whole blood assay in vitro at concentrations of 1.0 μg/mL 
and 20 μg/mL. No red blood cell clumping or plasma precipitation was observed in human whole blood 
at the concentrations tested. 
Tissue cross-reactivity (TCR) studies were conducted to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of 
epcoritamab with a comprehensive panel of normal human and cynomolgus monkey tissues. 
Epcoritimab was shown to bind specifically to mononuclear cells (B/T lymphocytes) in human and 
cynomolgus monkey lymphoid tissues. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Monoclonal antibodies are expected to be readily biodegradable and of low ecotoxicity. The active 
substance is a monoclonal antibody, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of 
the substance in the environment. Based on these considerations, epcoritamab is not expected to pose 
a risk to the environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Epcoritamab is a bispecific antibody recognising the T-cell antigen CD3 and the B-cell antigen CD20. 
Epcoritamab has a regular IgG1 structure and biochemical characteristics typical of a human 
IgG1antibody. It has been developed as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent for the treatment of a diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), expressing CD20.  
The pharmacology of epcoritamab has been thoroughly described in the provided non-clinical package. 
The nonclinical studies have been conducted in accordance with EMA and international (ICH) regulatory 
guidelines. Non-clinical pharmacology studies and initial toxicology studies have been performed with 
research grade batches representative of the material used in the clinical trials, while pivotal GLP 
toxicology study has been performed by clinical grade batch. The batches behaved similar with respect 
to pharmacological activity. 
A preclinical data demonstrated the potency and mechanism of epcoritamab in in vitro and ex vivo 
studies using human cells and tissues, as well as in in vivo studies using three different human cell-
derived xenograft models or patient derived xenograft model in different types of humanised mice. 
Non-clinical tumour models used in the non-clinical pharmacology program are representative of Non-
Hodgkin lymphomas, including target indication DLBCL. Epcoritamab showed potent killing of CD20- 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 38/209 
 
 
 
positive cells by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo. Concentrations at which T-cell 
activation and cytotoxicity by epcoritamab were first observed (EC20) were in the very low pM range 
and those at which half-maximal T-cell activation and cytotoxicity were observed (EC50) were in the 
low pM range. Activation and cytotoxicity of T cells induced by epcoritamab were dependent on the 
simultaneous binding of Fab arms to both CD3-positive T cells and CD20-positive B cells or tumour 
cells. While EC50 values for T-cell activation and T-cell mediated cytotoxicity in cell lines were in the 
pM range, the EC50 values for binding to CD20 were in the nM range. This indicates that low target 
occupancy is sufficient to achieve substantial cytotoxicity. This is further supported by lack of 
correlation between EC50 for activation and cytotoxicity and expression levels of CD20 per cell in 
tumour cell lines, and more than 40% tumour cell kill in patient samples even when the last anti-CD20 
treatment had been administered only two weeks prior to sampling, suggesting that epcoritamab can 
have pharmacodynamic effects shortly after discontinuing treatment with a CD20 mAb. 
For three DLBCL cell lines in study report GMB3013-032, however, the EC50 values for cytotoxicity was 
high although the EC50 for T-cell activation was rather low. And in two DLBCL samples from newly 
diagnosed patients no epcoritamab-induced cytotoxicity was observed (study report GMB3013-072). It 
is suggested by the applicant that there may be some characteristics other than T-activation or CD20 
expression that makes them less sensitive, and exploratory biomarkers will be evaluated as part of the 
expansion phase in clinical study GCT3013-01.  
Fc domain was silenced by introduction of mutations L234F L235E D265A which resulted in inability of 
epcoritamab to bind human receptor subtypes FcγRI, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIa-131H/R and FcγRIIIa-158F/V to 
elicit effector functions. However, receptor subtypes FcγRIIc (expressed on NK cells) and FcyRIIIb 
(expressed on neutrophils and eosinophils) have not been evaluated. The applicant justified the 
omission of these data by identical or very similar extracellular domains of FcγRIIb vs. FcγRIIc and 
FcγRIIIa vs. FcγRIIIb receptors, considering Fc interacting region. Thus, binding data generated for 
FcγRIIb and FcγRIIIa are applicable for FcγRIIc and FcγRIIIb. Epcoritamab showed minimal C1q 
binding and reduced capacity to induce CDC in CD20-positive cells at clinically relevant concentrations 
(7 % relative to IgG1-CD20). Based on the applicant´s explanation, it is reasonable to assume that 
observed minimal CDC activity of epcoritamab is not expected to have significant impact on clinical AEs. 
The proposed text in SmPC- section 5.1 with regard to MoA, is supported. 
The potential interaction between epcoritamab and first-line therapy compounds (R-CHOP, i.e R-CHOP- 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin and prednisone), has been assessed as 
part of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo pharmacology studies. It was demonstrated that there is a low risk 
for pharmacodynamic interaction of epcoritamab in the experimental set-up of the study with first-line 
therapeutics of DLBCL. 
The immunogenicity of humanized CD3-specific Fab arm and the Fc region of epcoritamab has been 
evaluated by in silico and in vitro cell-based modelling approaches and the immunogenic potential in 
human was predicted to be low which is line with clinical observations. 
In vivo, using B-cell lymphoma cell-derived xenograft models (CDX) or DLBCL patient-derived 
xenograft (PDX) model in mice with or with human immune system (HIS), epcoritamab delayed the 
growth of CD20+ tumour in all tested mouse models. Epcoritamab delayed the growth of CD20+ 
tumour in presence of T-cells, whereas bsAb-CD3xctrl which lacks the CD20-specific arm, did not. 
Interestingly, bsAb-ctrlxCD20 that lacks the CD3-specific arm, induced some anti-tumour activity and 
peripheral blood human B-cell depletion in Raji-luc xenograft model using BRGS-HIS mice, however, 
this treatment did not significantly prolong survival of the mice compared to PBS group. In Burkitt’s 
lymphoma CDX model (Raji cells) using NSG mice with HIS, low doses (0.05 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg) 
appear to have a delayed but strong effect, whereas high dose (5 mg/kg) has an immediate but less 
strong effect. As suggested by the applicant, the effect observed is primarily due to the model used, 
Assessment report

Page 39/209 
 
 
 
having limited number of available CD3 expressing T-cells, which consequently could limit dose-
dependent effect. Explanation that this phenomenon is restricted specifically to this preclinical model 
and the observation with the stronger anti-tumor effects at a lower dose is not clinically translatable, 
can be followed. In HIS mice that were implanted SC human tumour biopsy material (DLBCL patient-
derived xenograft model), epcoritamab effectively delayed tumour growth only at the highest tested 
dose (5 mg/kg) which was reflected in prolonged progression-free survival. However, efficacy appears 
to be transient, as tumour volume increases before the last dose is given.  
To identify a relevant non-human species to assess the nonclinical safety of epcoritamab, cross-
reactivity of epcoritamab was evaluated with CD20 and CD3 of non-human origin. The cynomolgus 
monkey was the only evaluated non-human species, for which binding of epcoritamab to both CD3 and 
CD20 was highly comparable with its binding to human CD3 and CD20. Moreover, CD3 and CD20 
expression levels were comparable between human and cynomolgus monkey cells and epcoritamab 
showed comparable pharmacology in human and cynomolgus monkey PBMCs. As part of toxicology 
studies, pharmacologic effects including cytokine release, depletion of peripheral blood B cells and 
decreased lymphoid cellularity in lymphoid tissues were observed by IV and SC administered 
epcoritamab in cynomolgus monkeys with normal B-cells. 
The bioanalytical methods were developed and validated or qualified for detection of either 
epcoritamab or anti-epcoritamab antibodies in plasma sample of cynomolgus monkeys. Initial non-GLP 
exploratory and dose-finding toxicology studies were supported by fit-for-purpose exploratory/qualified 
bioanalytical methods, while the bioanalytical methods supporting GLP-compliant toxicology study 
(Study No. 503484) were conducted in compliance with the OECD principles of GLP. The single 
molecule counting (SMC) method for detection of epcoritamab in cynomolgus monkey plasma from 
pilot GLP toxicity study was validated according to the relevant guideline on Bioanalytical method 
validation and study sample analysis for ligand binding assays (EMA/CHMP/ICH/172948/2019). The 
missing validation report of long-term stability for epcoritamab in frozen cynomolgus monkey plasma 
samples (-70°C) has been submitted upon request. The stability results of sample storage up to 196 
days are acceptable. 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of IV administered epcoritamab in cynomolgus monkeys showed a 
target-mediated drug disposition. A super-proportional increase in exposure was observed with 
increased IV and SC dose, as well as accumulation with weekly IV dosing. The SC profile in comparison 
to IV administration showed lower Cmax (10-17-fold), longer Tmax (3-7 days), shorter T1/2 (1.6-2.3-
fold), and 50-85% bioavailability. The applicant has confirmed that the apparent discrepancies in T1/2 
values in the submitted dossier was due to an incorrect statement in the study report.    
In female monkeys, a substantial range of bioavailability was observed between studies. Following 
single SC doses of 1 mg/kg, bioavailability ranged from more than 100% in females in the dose range-
finding toxicity study to approximately 49% in the pivotal toxicity study. The applicant informed that in 
the DRF study bioavailability was calculated using values from different groups (single SC dose and QW 
repeated IV dose), whereas in the GLP toxicity study both routes of administration had a dedicated 
single dose arm. Overall, it is agreed that the exposure data and sample size varied between 
toxicology studies and therefore the comparison of the results from different studies is challenging. 
Moreover, in the pivotal GLP toxicology study SC bioavailability differed between female (49%) and 
male cynomolgus monkeys (85%), consistent with the different median Tmax values at 1 mg/kg dose 
(up to 7 days in females and 3 days in males). The applicant explained that observed differences in 
bioavailability between males and females could partly be attributed to ADA formation towards the 
later time points in the TK profiles. In addition, variable number of females were included in IV and SC 
dose groups affecting the calculations of the group average AUC0-inf which may introduce bias 
between sexes. Taken together, there is no reason to assume significant gender differences in 
bioavailability.

No dedicated PD drug interaction studies were performed with epcoritamab according to 
CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev.1. This is acceptable because epcoritamab showed high binding specificity 
toward human CD20-expressing B-cells and CD3-expressing T-cells. 
No distribution, metabolism or excretion studies were performed with epcoritamab. This is acceptable 
according to ICHS6(R1) since no tissue distribution studies are considered necessary as epcoritamab is 
expected to be metabolised and excreted in the same manner as endogenous antibodies.  
ADA responses occurred in animals from D15 treated IV or SC. ADA were formed following single- and 
repeat-dosing of epcoritamab which in some animals affected exposure to significantly low or non-
quantifiable levels, especially at doses ≤ 0.1 mg/kg following IV administration or at doses ≤ 1 mg/kg 
following s.c administration. ADA had significant effect on exposure levels in these animals, therefore, 
animals which were ADA positive following repeat dosing were excluded from the PK/TK evaluation. 
Thus, ADA formation did not have impact on the interpretation of the PK data derived from IV repeat-
dose toxicity study. 
The nonclinical safety assessment of epcoritamab consisted of in vitro studies in human cells and 
tissues (cytokine release assay, plasma compatibility assays and tissue cross reactivity evaluation), 
and in vivo toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys. Repeat dose toxicology studies with once 
weekly IV administration up to five weeks duration, as well as single dose SC and monthly (two doses 
a month apart) SC administration have been conducted in the cynomolgus monkey. The proposed 
regimen for humans, with priming and intermediate dose, was not addressed in monkeys, however a 
regimen with priming dose followed by a full dose was used in the DRF monkey study, which is deemed 
sufficient. 
Only short-term studies of up to 5 weeks for repeated dosing of epcoritamab were performed. Since no 
unexpected findings were observed with epcoritamab in the repeat-dose toxicity studies and since a 
large proportion of animals developed ADA following repeat IV dosing, a 13-week toxicity study would 
be of limited value for the safety of epcoritamab, and can be waived. 
The primary findings in the repeat dose toxicology studies included adverse clinical signs, such as 
vomiting, skin reddening and mortality at ≥ 1 mg/kg after the first dose. These findings were 
associated with elevated cytokines. Additional epcoritamab findings included reversible changes in 
leukocytes and lymphocytes, reversible B-cell depletion in peripheral blood and reversible decrease in 
lymphoid cellularity in lymphoid tissues (spleen, various lymph nodes, and GALT), all of which were 
considered related to the pharmacological activity of epcoritamab. Slightly lower haemoglobin 
concentrations and haematocrits were also observed. There were no local injection reactions after SC 
administration. The potential for generation of antibodies to epcoritamab was assessed in single- and 
repeat-dose studies, and across all doses and routes. Epcoritamab had high potential for 
immunogenicity in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Due to the mode of action of epcoritamab and the evolutionary proximity to humans, doses used in the 
pivotal study were not much higher than the clinical dose. At the highest IV dose of 1 mg/kg, the 
exposure in males and females was the same as the clinical AUC0-t at steady state. At the highest SC 
dose of 1mg/kg, the exposure margins in males and females were 5x the clinical AUC0-t at steady 
state. At the highest IV dose of 1 mg/kg, the exposure margins in males and females were 8x to 6x 
the clinical Cmax at steady state, respectively. At the highest SC dose of 10 mg/kg, the exposure 
margins in males and females were 8x and 7x the clinical Cmax at steady state. 
The findings in cynomolgus monkeys were well described and correlated with the identified risk of 
cytokine release syndrome in humans. Information on cytokine release has been included in the SmPC.  
Cytokine release in monkeys was dose dependent and usually the highest after the first dose. SC 
administration resulted in lower cytokine levels than IV administration of equivalent dose. In the non-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 41/209 
 
 
 
GLP study in monkeys, a regimen of priming and single full dose on the subsequent day elicited a 
lower cytokine release than the regimen with repeat full dose of 1 mg/kg. 
Although non-clinical data does not directly support the proposed dosing regimen in humans, the 
toxicology data indicate that the highest levels of cytokines were associated with the first epcoritamab 
application and with the higher doses. Therefore, the severe cytokine release can be avoided with the 
use of a low starting, followed by intermediate dose (see Clinical part). 
In accordance with ICH S6 (R1) and ICH S9 guideline no information has been submitted on the 
genotoxic or carcinogenic potential of epcoritamab. 
Reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted for epcoritamab due to the high potential for 
immunogenicity in cynomolgus monkeys as well as limited tolerability due to its mode of action. The 
applicant has presented an adequate literature review to justify the absence of EFD toxicity study. 
Animal studies with other agents targeting CD20 (rituximab, ofatumumab) have shown non-
teratogenic effects on offspring (immunosuppression, perinatal death due to infections). Furthermore, 
cytokines are important for establishing and maintaining pregnancy in a stage-dependent fashion, 
therefore the CD3+ T-cell-dependent effects of epcoritamab may further contribute to foetal losses. 
Additionally, aberrant B-cell numbers and functions have been associated with obstetric complications, 
including growth restriction, pre-eclampsia and pregnancy induced hypertension. It can therefore be 
considered that epcoritamab has the potential to be transmitted from the pregnant mother to the 
developing foetus, and that foetal exposure to epcoritamab may cause adverse developmental 
outcomes. This information is included in the SmPC. The waiting period after dosing recommended for 
pregnancy is considered adequate. 
It is not known whether or to what extent epcoritamab is excreted in human milk, but based on the 
available data, local GI tract adverse effects cannot be ruled out, and a waiting time of 4 months -as 
recommended under section 4.6 of the SmPC- is justified. 
The results of the in vitro cytokine release assay were consistent with the anticipated pharmacology of 
epcoritamab, as well as findings in cynomolgus monkeys administered epcoritamab. They confirm the 
well-characterised risk of cytokine release associated with T cell activation in immunotherapy. 
Epcoritamab was non-haemolytic in a human whole blood assay in vitro and no plasma precipitation 
was observed in human whole blood at the concentrations tested. In the tissue cross-reactivity testing 
(TCR), epcoritamab was shown to bind specifically to mononuclear cells in human and cynomolgus 
monkey lymphoid tissues. The staining pattern of epcoritamab in the TCR studies was consistent with 
the expected tissue distribution of B/T lymphocytes in normal human and cynomolgus monkey tissues. 
The proof of concept for epcoritamab is considered sufficiently demonstrated. Epcoritamab was shown 
to be cross reactive with both, CD20 and CD3, only in human and cynomolgus monkeys, which support 
the use of cynomolgus monkey as an in vivo model in PK/TK and toxicity studies. Pharmacologic 
effects observed in cynomolgus monkeys are consistent with the mode of action of epcoritamab. 
Pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic profile of epcoritamab is well described. Effects of epcoritamab observed 
in cynomolgus monkeys included cytokine release and consequent clinical signs (vomiting, hunched 
posture, subdued behaviour), depletion of peripheral blood B cells, and decreased lymphoid cellularity 
in lymphoid tissues (spleen, various lymph nodes, and GALT) and lower haemoglobin concentrations 
and haematocrit. The findings considered associated with elevated cytokine levels were observed 
primarily following the first and the high dose. 
The active substance is a monoclonal antibody and as such it can be considered in the same way as a 
natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of the substance in 
the environment. Therefore, epcoritamab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacology data are available from two ongoing clinical trials (Table 19) to support the use 
of epcoritamab monotherapy in LBCL and DLBCL: global phase 1/2 trial GCT3013-01 (Dose Escalation 
and Expansion LBCL, iNHL, and MCL cohorts) and supportive Japanese phase 1/2 trial GCT3013-04 
(Dose Escalation, Expansion DLBCL and FL cohorts). The epcoritamab clinical pharmacology program 
included the evaluation of single dose PK, multiple dose PK, effects of relevant intrinsic and extrinsic 
covariates on epcoritamab exposure evaluated by a popPK approach, QT prolongation potential, 
immunogenicity, B cell/T cell counts, and cytokine release. Pharmacology of epcoritamab has not been 
evaluated in healthy subjects, only in cancer patients. 
Methods 
Bioanalytical methods. To quantify epcoritamab in human plasma for PK evaluation, two bioanalytical 
assays were used. SMCIA-139 method was a sandwich immunoassay with fluorescence detection (60 
pg/mL-500 pg/mL) developed and validated for samples with expected low concentrations from the 
Escalation Part of GCT3013-01. The ECLIA-139 sandwich immunoassay with electrochemiluminescence 
detection (10.0 ng/mL and the ULOQ at 1,000 ng/mL) was used for the vast majority of the PK 
samples (88.7%) from the GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04 studies. Because cross-validation showed 
that the two methods do not sufficiently produce comparable results in the overlapping assay range, 
only data with the ECLIA-139 method were reported.  
Immunogenicity assessment of anti epcoritamab antibodies (ADA) in plasma (study GCT3013-01) or 
serum (GCT3013-04) was evaluated following a tiered approach that included screening, confirmation, 
and titer analysis. In study GCT3013-04, in addition a domain binding method was also applied to 
determine the ADA titers for the separate arms of epcoritamab. No neutralising ADA assay was 
submitted. 
PopPK analysis. PopPK analysis was used to characterise the pharmacokinetics, to assess the impact of 
covariates on the PK of epcoritamab and to estimate individual post hoc pharmacokinetic parameters 
for use in exposure-response analysis. The data cut-off date was 30-Nov-2021 for PK and 31-Jan-2022 
for the clinical data. 
The PopPK analysis was based on 6819 quantifiable PK samples from 327 subjects (including 300 
subjects who were administered the full dose of 48 mg). The analysis was conducted using nonlinear 
mixed-effects modelling with the NONMEM software, Version 7.5.0 (ICON Development Solutions). 
FOCEI was used for NONMEM model runs of the primary analysis and LAPLACIAN estimation method 
was used for sensitivity analysis. 953 postdose concentrations that were below the limit of 
quantification (BLQ) were included in a BQL sensitivity analysis; 87.7% of BQL observations followed 
priming, intermediate, or full doses that were below 1 mg. The likelihood-based M3 method for 
handling BQL data was used. Furthermore, 921 quantifiable samples analysed by SMCIA were included

in another sensitive analysis. 392 postdose observations that were analysed outside of stability window, 
all from study GCT3013-01 dose escalating part, were not included in the popPK analysis. 
Pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab was described by a 2-compartment model with a non-specific linear 
clearance and a target mediated drug clearance (TMDD, a QSS approximation) with the first order SC 
absorption (Figure 5). 
Figure 3: Schematics of the base population PK model 
Model development, performance evaluation and reporting of the popPK model was good and in line 
with the guideline. Pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab was described by a 2-compartment model with a 
non-specific linear clearance and a target mediated drug clearance (TMDD, a QSS approximation) with 
the first order SC absorption (Figure 5). The model described the pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab 
dosed 48 mg sufficiently well. 
Only body-weight (CL/F, Vc/F) and age (ka) were covariates for the non-specific linear clearance, 
distribution and absorption of epcoritamab. After adjusting for body-weight and age effects, Asian race, 
sex, tumour size, ALB, trial effect (04 vs. 01), lymphoma subtypes (iNHL vs. LBCL and MCL vs. LBCL) 
did not have significant impact on the PK of epcoritamab. Parameter estimates of the final popPK 
model are given in Table 20. Base model CV% for CL and Vc were 34.6% and 39.6%, respectively.

Absorption  
Epcoritamab has been administered only subcutaneously. Absolute bioavailability has not been 
determined. At the proposed dose regimen (0.16 mg/0.8 mg/48 mg), the peak concentration of 
epcoritamab occurred around 3 to 4 days after the first 48 mg epcoritamab SC dose on C1D15 (Figure 
6). Plasma concentrations were in general < BLQ for the priming and intermediate dose.

PopPK estimated that epcoritamab concentrations appeared to reach steady-state by approximately 2 
to 3 months after start of each dosing interval (QW, Q2W, or Q4W). PopPK exposure estimates for the 
48 mg dose in the target population are summarised in Table 21. Pharmacokinetic results were similar

Bioequivalence. Initial batches were manufactured via DP process 1. Product manufacturing was 
successfully scaled up and transferred to the EU manufacturing site DP Process 2. 
The commercial product was introduced during the conduct of the Expansion Part of the GCT3013-01 
and GCT3013-04 trials during re-supply. Therefore, PK, efficacy, and safety data from the commercial 
formulation of epcoritamab are included as part of the overall clinical data package. 
Distribution 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 47/209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The population PK gMean estimate for the apparent volume of distribution was 23.4 L (81%). 
Elimination 
PopPK model-based predictions of epcoritamab concentrations, TMDD saturation, and total clearance 
following the proposed dosing regimen (0.16 mg/0.8 mg/48 mg) are illustrated in Figure 7. Total 
clearance decreased with increasing concentrations over time following the prime and intermediate 
doses. After the first full dose of 48 mg epcoritamab on C1D15, mean total clearance approached the 
linear clearance, suggesting saturation of target-mediated clearance. Despite a decrease in exposures 
associated with less frequent dosing regimens, such as Q2W and Q4W, target saturation was estimated 
to be maintained and the total clearance remains close to the linear clearance. 
Elimination half-life of epcoritamab was similar following QW, Q2W and Q4W dosing frequency, 22 
days (58%), 24 days (72%), and 22 days (75%), respectively. 
The population mean estimate for the CL/F was 0.481 L/day (27.3%). 
No mass balance and traditional metabolism studies have been conducted because epcoritamab is a 
IgG1 antibody and as such is mainly metabolised and eliminated through proteolytic degradation into 
small peptide fragments or amino acids that are ready for renal excretion or recycling into protein 
synthesis. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality was evaluated using the intensive PK data from the GCT3013-01 Escalation Part 
and by popPK analysis. Epcoritamab elimination showed nonlinear characteristics when evaluated using 
population PK. Exposure increases greater than dose-proportional for dosing regimens with the full 
dose <24 mg, and approximately dose-proportionally for dosing regimens with the full dose ≥24 mg. 
The final popPK model does not include time dependency of PK parameters. The time dependency of 
epcoritamab PK was mainly driven by the target mediated drug disposition through time-varying 
concentration levels at low doses. 
Special populations 
Special population PK was evaluated by popPK analysis. The initial covariate model included major 
covariates that usually affect PK of mAbs: body-weight on clearance and volume parameters and age 
on SC absorption rate constant. When compared to the AUC in subjects with weight 65 to <85 kg, the 
average AUC during Cycle 1 was 10.6% lower in subjects with weight ≥85 kg and 47.6% higher in 
subjects with weight <65 kg. Age was a statistically significant covariate on the absorption rate 
constant but did not influence other PK parameters. Further covariate analysis (Figure 8) indicated 
that, after adjusting for body weight and age effects, Asian race, sex, tumour size, ALB, trial effect (04 
vs. 01), lymphoma subtypes (iNHL vs. LBCL and MCL vs. LBCL) did not have significant impact on the 
PK of epcoritamab.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal clinical drug-drug interaction studies were performed. As an IgG1 bispecific antibody with a 
regular IgG1 structure and biochemical characteristics, epcoritamab is expected to be degraded into 
small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
N/A 
Immunogenicity 
 A total of 14 (4.3%) of 327 PK-evaluable subjects were ADA-positive across all dose levels, and 
among those, only 4 (1.2%) had titer ≥1 (1:80 after accounting for dilutions). Among 300 PK-
evaluable subjects who received the full dose of 48 mg, only 10 subjects (3.3%) were ADA positive. 
The onset of immunogenicity was usually after C1D22. 
ADA status was not formally investigated as a covariate in the popPK analysis. No meaningful 
differences in PK were detected between ADA positive and ADA negative subjects based on comparison 
of eta plots and simulated exposures using the final model. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Epcoritamab is a bispecific antibody, recognising the T-cell antigen CD3 and the B-cell antigen CD20. 
Epcoritamab’s mechanism of action is induction of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity of CD20-expressing 
cells, and associated T-cell activation and proliferation, upon simultaneous binding to CD20 on target 
cells and CD3 on T cells. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In the subset of subjects with detectable B cells at treatment initiation (23% of the patients from the 
escalation part and 21% from the expansion part of study GCT3012-01), epcoritamab induced 
sustained depletion of peripheral B cells (defined as CD19 B-cell counts <10 cells/μL) by C1D15. This 
was measured based on the presence of the common B cell marker CD19 by flow cytometry in blood. 
Subjects were considered positive for circulating B cells if more than 10 CD19-positive cells were 
detected per microliter blood. Transient reductions in total T-cell counts were observed 6 to 14 hours 
after administration of the priming (C1D1) intermediate (C1D8), and first full dose (C1D15) at all dose 
levels tested, including the 48 mg full dose level, total T-cell counts recovered before next epcoritamab 
dosing. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Cytokines 
Epcoritamab step-up dosing resulted in transient elevations of circulating levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, and 
Assessment report

TNF-α following administration of the proposed epcoritamab dose regimen (0.16 mg/0.8 mg/48 mg), 
mostly occurring 1 to 4 days after the first full dose with levels returning to baseline. This is illustrated 
in Figure 9 for median levels of IL-6 in peripheral blood over time in the aNHL cohort of GCT3013-01 
Expansion Part. For IFN-γ IL-10, and TNF-α similar figures can be seen (data not shown). 
Figure 6: Median IL-6 Levels in peripheral blood over time in subjects in aNHL Cohort – 
GCT3013-01 Expansion Part (0.16 mg/0.8 mg/48 mg) 
Within the tested range for priming and intermediate doses in GCT3013-01 Escalation Part, peak IL-6 
concentrations were independent of dose for priming and intermediate doses. There appeared an 
increasing trend of IL-6 peak concentrations with dose after the first full dose. However, the selected 
48 mg full dose (RP2D) produced similar IL-6 peak concentrations compared to lower full doses within 
the dose range of 6 to 60 mg. Frequency of CRS events was generally the highest following the first 
full dose and the lowest during the priming dose (C1D1) and the second full dose (C1D22). 
Electrocardiograms and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics of QTc intervals 
Using the pooled data from both GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04 the applicant examined the relationship 
between the baseline-adjusted/corrected change in QTcF intervals and time-matched plasma 
concentrations of epcoritamab (927 time-matched observations from n=176). The analysis, using a 
linear mixed effects modelling and to predict 95% CI of QTcF prolongation at mean Cmax values 
achieved at 48 mg, is adequate. No significant association between epcoritamab concentrations and 
QTcF was observed in this pooled analysis (P=0.103). At the arithmetic mean predicted Cmax value of 
11.7 µg/mL following the proposed dosing regimen of QW doses, QTcF prolongation was predicted to 
be 0.76 msec, with the 95% CI upper bound of 3.40 msec.  
The review of the QTcF data and the PK/pharmacodynamic relationship for epcoritamab revealed no 
effect of epcoritamab on ΔQTcF. Please refer to the safety section for the assessment of ECGs and 
clinically significant cardiac AEs.

Exposure-response analyses 
Exposure-response analyses were performed to assess the relationships between epcoritamab 
exposure and efficacy and safety in subjects with (D)LBCL and to support the selected dosing regimen. 
The relationship between exposure and ORR and CR rate was analysed with a logistic regression. For 
PFS and OS, Kaplan-Meier plots were used to compare the survival probability over time for subjects 
with low and high exposure categorised by the median value of Cycle 1 AUC. 
Across the full dose range studied (0.004 to 60 mg), statistically significant (p<0.05) relationships 
between key efficacy endpoints (ORR, CR rate, PFS, and OS) and epcoritamab exposure were 
observed, ie, higher epcoritamab exposures provided higher ORR/CR rate and longer PFS/OS.  
At the proposed 48 mg full dose (i.e., analysis using data only from 48 mg full dose level), the 
relationships were no longer significant for most efficacy endpoints, but a numerical trend was 
observed for all the key efficacy endpoints including ORR. Since the logistic regression was no longer 
statistically significant no multivariate analysis has been conducted. 
Exposure-safety analyses were conducted for ≥ grade 3 TEAEs, serious TEAEs, ≥ grade 3 neutropenia, 
≥ grade 3 infections, injection site reactions, TEAEs leading to dose delay, TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation, all grade CRS, ≥ grade 2 CRS, CRS requiring tocilizumab, ICANS, and CTLS.  
Across the dose range studied (0.004 to 60 mg), no increase in incidence of any TEAE category tested 
was seen with increasing epcoritamab exposure. Importantly, increased epcoritamab exposure did not 
result in higher incidence of all grade CRS, ≥ grade 2 CRS, CRS requiring tocilizumab, ICANS, and 
CTLS across the doses and exposures evaluated. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology data are available from 2 ongoing clinical trials to support the use of 
epcoritamab monotherapy in LBCL and DLBCL. The epcoritamab clinical pharmacology program 
included the evaluation of multiple dose PK, effects of relevant intrinsic and extrinsic covariates on 
epcoritamab exposure evaluated by a popPK approach, exposure-response analysis, biomarker 
analyses, QT prolongation potential, and immunogenicity. 
No dedicated studies have been conducted to evaluate metabolism, in patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment, drug interactions and QT prolongation. This is considered acceptable because epcoritamab 
is a IgG1 therapeutic protein and no direct effects on these populations/issues are to be expected. QTc 
prolongation potential was investigated using time-matched PK and ADA/ECG measurements in the 
clinical studies to confirm the absence of an effect. 
RP2D was investigated in the dose escalation phase of the pivotal study GCT3013-01.For further 
considerations regarding posology, please see section 3.3.5 Discussion on clinical efficacy. 
Methods Both PK and immunogenicity assays are adequately validated, and the provided validation 
documentation and principle of the employed methods are considered appropriate and in accordance 
with relevant guidelines.  
Two bioanalytical assays SMCIA-139 and ECLIA-139 were used to analyse epcoritamab in human 
plasma in the dose escalating part of study GCT3013-01. SMCIA-139 method was used early in the 
study to evaluate low dose epcoritamab plasma concentrations. Cross-validation showed differences 
between the two bioanalytical methods, with on average higher concentration for the ECLIA-139 
method. In this dossier only data with bioanalytical ECLIA-139 method have been presented. It is 
agreed that only these data can be used for the popPK analysis, however, there is no PK info with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 52/209 
 
 
 
ECLIA-139 method on the priming and intermediate doses. In addition, there is some uncertainty 
about the ability of the popPK model to describe the dose dependency adequately. For these reasons, 
the applicant is requested to present the non-compartmental PK results of the SMCIA-139 method. 
However, there was no apparent dose response over the dose range 1.5 – 48 mg with the SMCIA-139 
and these data cannot be used to strengthen the sparse data available at lower doses than ≤ 12 mg 
for the ECLIA-139 method. Since only one full dose of 48 mg is proposed and there is no clear 
exposure-response relationship for both efficacy and safety, the additional information that could have 
been obtained with the SMCIA-139 method is not pivotal. 
popPK analysis Model development, performance evaluation and reporting of the popPK model was 
good and in line with the guideline. Data on absorption rate were mainly based on the PK sampling 
during the first cycle, because at later cycles PK sampling was confined to predose sampling and 1h 
after SC administration. Since the absorption rate and the elimination rate are long, the values for 
predose and 1h after SC are very similar. Therefore, there is some uncertainty with the estimation of 
Cmax values at steady-state. Further, some clarification is requested regarding incorporation in the 
analyses of blood transfusions, subjects with interfering plasma levels and whether impact of CRS 
grade>2 has been evaluated.  It was shown that the pharmacokinetic data in subjects with blood 
transfusion (N=58) overlapped with those who had no blood transfusion (N=269), which can be 
expected since the transfusion volume was less than one tenth of the estimated Volume of distribution. 
In addition, it was shown that CRS ≥ Grade 2, had no impact on the pharmacokinetics: subjects with 
CRS ≥ Grade 2 (N=83) had similar pharmacokinetics as subjects with CSR<grade 2 (N=244). 
Plasma concentrations of epcoritamab dosed 48 mg were adequately described by a two-compartment 
target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) model with the first order SC absorption. However shrinkage 
of various parameters such as clearance was rather high i.e. 34% in the final model, which indicate 
that the PK data are less informative at the individual level. There was a trend of underestimation of 
epcoritamab concentrations at doses ≤12 mg suggesting that TMDD might be overestimated. This was 
further strengthened that the sensitivity analysis for samples <BLQ method changed the TMDD 
parameters Base and Kss with 30-90%. Therefore, there is uncertainty concerning the population 
predictions of the final model for the low doses <12 mg used in the exposure-efficacy analysis. Since 
the impact of TMDD at a dose of 48 mg epcoritamab is low compared to the non-specific clearance, 
popPK model is fit for purpose to predict epcoritamab exposures for 48 mg dose and no adjustment of 
the popPK model is needed. The popPK model is considered fit for purpose to describe the 
pharmacokinetics following the 48 mg dose and to assess the impact of covariates on the PK of 
epcoritamab.  
Drug product During development, epcoritamab was manufactured at two different sites. No dedicated 
PK comparison has been conducted between the batches produced at the different sites. The 
commercial product has been used in the clinical studies. As estimated by popPK the bioavailability is 9% 
less for process B and the clearance is 6% higher. The two process batches result in fully overlapping 
epcoritamab concentrations, indicating no impact of manufacturing site on the PK. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic results were similar for the LBCL and DLBCL populations.  
In patients, the PK profile of SC epcoritamab was characterised by slow absorption and linear non-
specific elimination and target mediated elimination. At the 48 mg dose, the non-specific elimination 
mediated by FcRn receptor is predominant. At lower doses, target mediated clearance might be more 
predominant. Elimination half-life of epcoritamab as estimated by popPK analysis was 22-24 days for 
QW, Q2W and Q4W dosing regimens with 48 mg. The population PK gMean estimate for the apparent 
volume of distribution was 24.3 L (81%), which is somewhat higher than usual for human IgG1 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 53/209 
 
 
 
antibody but the uncertainty in the estimate was high. Overall, the pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab 
are in line with other therapeutic IgG1 antibodies. 
Absorption rate with the geometric mean tmax ranged from approximately 3 to 4 days across doses. 
This is an absorption rate commonly seen for IgG molecules administered subcutaneously. Absorption 
rate declined with age, as would be expected for SC administration of mAbs. In younger (33.3 years 
old, the 2.5th percentile) and older (82 years old, the 97.5th percentile) subjects, ka was 39.9% 
higher and 11.0% lower compared to 65 years old subjects, respectively. However, the predicted 
epcoritamab AUC exposures in older subjects are similar to those for younger subjects. 
Absolute bioavailability of epcoritamab SC has not been determined, but in general absolute 
bioavailability of antibodies following the SC route is high (~70%, Sánchez-Félix et al., Advanced Drug 
Delivery Reviews 2020). High absolute bioavailability was also indicated in monkeys (see non-clinical 
AR). There was no relevant difference in epcoritamab exposure following injection in the abdomen and 
thigh. Therefore, the text in the SmPC that epcoritamab can be administered in the abdomen or thigh, 
is acceptable. Overall, pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab can be characterised sufficiently without 
precise estimation on the absolute bioavailability.  
Similar to other therapeutic antibodies, body weight was a significant covariate affecting the PK of 
epcoritamab. For the extreme values of weight (44.7 kg and 110 kg, defined as 2.5th and 97.5th 
percentiles of weight distribution in the analysis population) AUC at week 12 was 60% higher and 30% 
lower, respectively compared to subjects weighing 75 kg. Response rate was similar over the dose 
range 12-60 mg and also no dose response for safety was apparent; efficacy and safety was generally 
consistent across these studied body weight categories. Therefore, the difference in exposures among 
different weight groups are considered not clinically meaningful. 
None of the other covariates, including sex, race (White, Asian, and Other), laboratory values, renal 
and hepatic function, ECOG score, tumour size and lymphoma subtypes, and geographic region (Asia 
and North America versus Europe) had a statistically significant effect on epcoritamab PK after 
accounting for the body weight. The effects on epcoritamab exposure measures were <25% difference 
with the average exposure. Potential impact of ADAs on PK was only investigated by popPK model 
exercises, no impact on the pharmacokinetics was apparent but the dataset with ADA positive samples 
was low. 
No formal clinical drug-drug interaction studies were performed. Epcoritamab causes a transient 
release of cytokines and thus may reduce enzyme activity of several CYP enzymes. Treatment of CRS 
grade >2 with tocilizumab counteracts the potential effects of elevated levels of IL-6. Given the 
transient character of the IL-6 elevations and the poor predictability when these elevations occur, it is 
agreed that a clinical study to evaluate the potential interaction is difficult to conduct. Moreover, the 
impact of elevated IL-6 /cytokines on metabolism of other medicines are generally modest < 2-fold 
(Gatti, Clinical Pharmacokinetics (2022)). This might be relevant for co-administered medicines with a 
narrow therapeutic exposure range. The text in the SmPC section 4.5 is considered acceptable. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Epcoritamab’s mechanism of action is induction of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity of CD20-expressing 
cells, and associated T-cell activation and proliferation, upon simultaneous binding to CD20 on target 
cells and CD3 on T cells. The MoA is considered relevant for the therapeutic setting. The primary and 
secondary pharmacology was analysed by measuring B-cell detection, T-cell counts and cytokine levels 
and by assessing the potential of epcoritamab to impact cardiac repolarization. 
B-cells / T-cells. Circulating B cell counts was assessed based on the presence of the common B cell 
marker CD19 by flow cytometry in blood. Subjects were considered positive for circulating B cells if 
more than 10 CD19-positive cells were detected per microliter blood. There is clinical evidence that 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 54/209 
 
 
 
epcoritamab induces and maintains B-cell depletion, however only a very small sample of patients 
were available for evaluation (GCT3013-01 escalation part N=18/65 patients (28%) and expansion 
part N=33 (21.0%)). Epcoritamab is also associated with transient reductions in T-cell count 
margination followed by an increase in T cell counts in circulation. 
For both GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04, further exploratory tumour/bone marrow biomarker analyses 
are under consideration in order to identify potential biomarkers predictive of response or resistance, 
and mechanisms of tumour response and/or treatment-induced changes in the immune 
microenvironment. The results will be presented for review when finalised. 
Cytokines. A transient elevation in circulating levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-10, and TNF-α was observed. 
CRS may be seen with epcoritamab treatment, mainly after the first full dose, but thereafter is also 
possible. Between effective doses (12-60 mg) the occurrence of CRS based on the IL-6 peak 
concentration is comparable between doses. The role of the priming and intermediate dose has not 
elucidated and neither the adequacy of the height of these doses could be confirmed. 
QTcF- It is agreed with the applicant that a thorough QT/QTc study is in principle not necessary, as 
large monoclonal antibodies have a low likelihood of direct ion channel interactions (ICH guideline 
E14/S7B: clinical and Nonclinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic 
Potential - questions and answers EMA/CHMP/ICH/415588/2020). The review of the QTcF data and the 
PK/pharmacodynamic relationship for epcoritamab revealed no effect of epcoritamab on ΔQTcF. 
Exposure-response. The objectives for exposure-response analysis were descriptive, so no high impact 
analyses. The exposure-response analyses identified exposure as a significant factor when including 
the full dose range studied (0.004 to 60 mg) but not when considering the proposed dosing regimen 
with 48 mg full dose. Dose response data indicated that ORR and CR were similar in the dose range 
12-60 mg. Exposure-response for safety across the full dose range did not identify statistically 
significant relationships. These exposure-response analyses support the 48 mg as a dose with 
acceptable efficacy and safety, but also indicates that other doses might be equally effective/safe (see 
also comments at dose finding in efficacy part of AR). The applicant is encouraged to further 
explore/investigate potential epcoritamab exposure-response relationships when other dosing regimen 
are evaluated. 
Immunogenicity. Using the proposed dosing regimen, 11/361 subjects with LBCL/DLBCL were ADA 
positive on treatment in studies GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04. Neutralising antibodies have not been 
evaluated but considering the low incidence of ADAs <5% of patients having (transiently) ADA 
expression, this is considered acceptable, but the absence of measurement is acknowledged in the 
SmPC section5.1.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Characterisation of clinical pharmacology of epcoritamab is based on data from two ongoing clinical 
trials in subjects with LBCL/DLBCL. The pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab are in line with other 
therapeutic IgG1 antibodies. Overall, the information provided can be considered satisfactory and has 
been reflected in the SmPC section 5.2.  
Further, immunogenicity needs to be continued to be evaluated in (future) clinical studies.

GCT3013-01 Trial – dose escalation part 
Methods 
This is a First-in-human (FIH), open-label, phase 1/2 trial in subjects aged 18 years or older with 
relapsed, progressive and/or refractory (R/R) mature B-cell lymphoma. The trial includes 2 parts: a 
Dose Escalation Part and an Expansion Part. The trial design is illustrated in Figure 10. 
Figure 7: Overview of GCT3013-01 Trial Design 
Abbreviations: aNHL = aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes; CRS = cytokine release syndrome graded according to 
(Lee et al., 2019); DL = dose level; iNHL = indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes; MCL = mantle cell lymphoma; MTD = 
maximum tolerated dose; RP2D = recommended phase 2 dose; X = the dose level where the trigger (grade 2 non hematological 
toxicity etc.) is observed: switch from single subject cohort to 3 subject cohort 
The aim of the Dose Escalation Part of this trial was to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of epcoritamab. The primary endpoint was the incidence 
of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and safety to determine the MTD and RP2D in subjects with R/R B-cell 
non Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Secondary efficacy endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), 
complete response (CR), partial response (PR), duration of response (DOR), progression free survival 
(PFS), time to next (anti-lymphoma) treatment (TTNT), and overall survival (OS). Responses were 
assessed by the investigator only according to the Lugano criteria. 
Doses were administered in 2 titration parts: an accelerated titration part and a standard titration part. 
The accelerated titration part consisted of single patient cohorts which could be expanded by up to 
2 additional subjects (at each investigated dose) for the purpose of obtaining additional PK and 
pharmacodynamic biomarker data. Once non-hematologic toxicity grade ≥2 according to NCI-CTCAE 
version 5.0 or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grade ≥2 according to the grading by Lee et al. was 
observed at a dose level, the cohort was expanded with an additional 2 patients and the cohort sizes 
for the remaining dose levels were 3 patients. After that the standard titration part followed, where 
cohorts were allowed to include only 2 patients who were DLT-evaluable, provided that neither of the 2 
patients experienced any grade ≥2 toxicity during the DLT evaluation period, which was defined as the 
first 4 weeks (i.e., 28 days after the first dose of epcoritamab). Over-recruitment by 1 subject was

allowed, so that each 3-patient cohort could consist of 2 to 4 DLT-evaluable patients. The Dose 
Escalation Part of the trial was performed following a modified approach from the Bayesian Optimal 
Interval BOIN design (Yuan et al., 2016). 
The priming dose was investigated in ‘parallel evaluation’ cohorts (up to 10 additional patients) where 
the new priming dose was assessed following a previously declared safe full dose by the data 
monitoring committee (DMC) and Safety Committee. This continued until the new priming dose was 
declared safe based on the ‘priming dose escalation’ stopping criteria: if ≥2 out of 6 patients with CRS 
Grade 2 or any CRS Grade 3 or 4 were observed in the ‘parallel evaluation’ cohorts, that further 
escalation of the priming dose was stopped. 
The MTD was defined as the highest dose level with an observed DLT rate lower than the target 
toxicity level of 30%. Selection of the RP2D was based on review of the available efficacy and safety 
information (including adverse events (AEs) and safety laboratory values, and observations made after 
the end of the DLT evaluation period) and was allowed to be lower than the MTD. 
During the Dose Escalation Part of the trial, epcoritamab was administered in 28-day cycles as follows: 
•  Cycles 1 and 2: Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 per week (QW) 
•  Cycles 3 to 6: Days 1 and 15 per 2 weeks (Q2W) 
•  Cycles 7 and beyond until unacceptable toxicity, PD, or withdrawal of consent: Day 1 (Q4W) 
DLTs were defined as Grade 5 toxicity, CRS Grade 4 and 3 (if not improved within 48 hours), 
neutropenia Grade 4 lasting > 7 days, febrile neutropenia grade ≥ 3 lasting > 2 days, 
thrombocytopenia grade 4 lasting > 7 days and non-hematological toxicity grade 3 or higher excluding 
certain events which resolved in time/ respond to therapy, CRS, fatigue if present at baseline and 
alopecia. 
The patient population enrolled in the escalation part of the GCT3013-01 trial were aged 18 years or 
older with an ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2, and had documented evidence of CD20-positive 
mature B-cell neoplasm according to WHO classification 2016 or 2008. Non-Hodgkin (NHL) subtypes 
allowed were DLBCL, high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma 
(PMBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), small lymphocytic lymphoma 
(SLL), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL; nodal, extranodal or mucosa associated). Subjects had 
relapsed, progressive and/or refractory disease following treatment with an anti-CD20 monoclonal 
antibody (mAb; e.g., rituximab) potentially in combination with chemotherapy and/or relapsed after 
autologous stem cell rescue and had exhausted or were ineligible for all standard therapeutic options. 
Subjects had at least 1 measurable site of disease based on CT/MRI. 
During the Dose Escalation Part of the trial, epcoritamab priming doses ranging from 0.004 (MABEL) to 
0.16 mg, intermediate doses ranging from 0.25 to 1.6 mg, and full doses ranging from 0.0128 to 60 
mg doses were explored in subjects with R/R B-NHL. In total 17 cohorts (12 cohorts, 5 parallel 
evaluations) with different priming/intermediate and full doses were evaluated (Table 22).

Notes: To bridge the gap between priming and continuously escalating full doses, an intermediate dose of epcoritamab was added 
prior to dosing at the 1.5 mg full dose level (beginning with Cohort 6). The last dose in Cycle 1 (ie, full dose) was continued in Cycle 
2 and onwards. 
Cohorts ending with ‘a’ were intended for parallel evaluation. 
Data cutoff date: 31 Jan 2022 
Source: Table 14.1.11 
An integrated, model-based approach was implemented to support the selected RP2D. This approach 
relied on the safety, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamic data from the Dose Escalation Part in 
combination with preliminary population-PK modeling, PK/ pharmacodynamic modeling, 
exposure-response analysis, and exposure-safety analysis. 
Of note, a dose optimisation part was added to the GCT3013-01 protocol to evaluate additional priming 
and intermediate dosing regimens to explore the potential for further reduction in incidence and/or 
severity of CRS; this part of the trial has not yet been initiated and no data are available. 
The rationale for the SC route of epcoritamab administration was based on its lower Cmax value and 
lower peak cytokine levels, but comparable B-cell depletion compared to IV administration at the same 
doses (mg/kg) in the nonclinical studies. For the initial treatment cycles, more frequent (QW) dosing of 
Assessment report

Page 58/209 
 
 
 
 
 
epcoritamab was selected due to the potential for higher target-mediated clearance due to higher 
tumor burden. The rationale for decreasing the dose frequency to Q2W in Cycles 3 to 6 and Q4W 
thereafter, is based on the assumption that tumor burden will decrease over time, similar to the B-cell 
depletion observed in peripheral blood and lymph nodes of cynomolgus monkeys. 
Per the original protocol (15 Nov 2017), subjects were premedicated with corticosteroids (one day), 
antihistamines, and antipyretics 30 to 120 minutes prior to the first 4 doses of epcoritamab. For later 
doses of epcoritamab, premedication and CRS prophylaxis were optional. Beginning with Protocol 
Amendment 3 (dated 15 Apr 2019), corticosteroids were administered following epcoritamab 
administration on Days 1, 2, and 3 for the 1st and/or 2nd epcoritamab dose in Cycle 1. Beginning with 
Amendment 5 (dated 04 Nov 2019) starting with cohort 7, corticosteroids were given for each of the 4 
doses of epcoritamab in Cycle 1 (i.e., Days 1, 8, 15 and 22) with the goal of further mitigating the 
incidence and severity of CRS. In Protocol Amendment 06, Version 8.0 (dated 08 Jun 2020; only 
applicable to expansion cohort) the corticosteroid prophylactic plan was increased from 3 consecutive 
days to 4 consecutive days (i.e., days 1 to 4) in Cycle 1. If CRS ≥ grade 2 occurred following the 4th 
epcoritamab administration on C1D22, consecutive corticosteroids continued in Cycle 2 until CRS was 
resolved. 
Results 
The first subject signed informed consent on 26 Jun 2018. At the data cut-off of 31 Jan 2022 a total of 
73 subjects were enrolled (subjects who signed informed consent) and 68 subjects were treated with 
epcoritamab at full doses ranging from 0.0128 mg to 60 mg in the Dose Escalation Part. Of the 68 
treated subjects, 60 (88.2%) subjects had discontinued treatment. The most frequent reasons for 
treatment discontinuation were disease progression (51 [75.0%] subjects) and decision to proceed 
with transplant following a response to epcoritamab (6 [8.8%] subjects). Protocol deviations were 
reported in 8 (11.8%) subjects. These deviations were related to dosing (of concurrent medication and 
priming dose) and enrollment criteria (4 [5.9%] subjects each).  
In the overall group, 45 [66.2%] subjects were male. The median age was 67.5 years (range: 21, 84). 
Forty-six (67.6%) had DLBCL, 3 (4.4%) HGBL, 1 (1.5%) PMBCL, 12 (17.6%) with FL and other in 6 
(8.9%).

After a median follow-up of 12.2 months, the median DOR was 18.1 months (95% CI: 4.2, NR). For 
the 48 mg dose level (N=12), after a median follow-up of 12.4 months, the median DOR was 6.0 
months (range: 1.3, NR).  
After a median follow-up of 12.2 months, the median PFS was 2.6 months (95% CI: 1.6, 4.0). For the 
48 mg dose level (N=12), after a median follow-up of 12.4 months, the median PFS was 2.8 months 
(95% CI: 1.0, 11.8). The median OS was 12.2 (4.3, 18.5) months (median follow up not provided).  
Safety 
In total, 29 subjects were included in the dose determining analysis set (DDS). The priming dose was 
escalated from 0.004 mg to 0.16 mg, the intermediate dose was escalated from 0.25 mg to 1.6 mg, 
and the full dose level was escalated from 0.0128 mg to 60 mg. None of the subjects in the DDS 
experienced DLTs in any of the dose levels tested (0.0128 mg to 60 mg) and the MTD was not 
identified. 
A review of data from Cohorts 1 through 11 indicated the proposed priming/intermediate/full dosing 
regimen of 0.16 mg/0.8 mg/48 mg regimen had similar or numerically lower rates of CRS (compared 
to other dosing regimens (e.g., comprising full doses of 24 mg and 60 mg). Results from the 
PK/pharmacodynamic evaluation of cytokine (IL-6) data and modeling analysis suggested further 
escalation of the priming and intermediate doses beyond the current priming/intermediate doses 
(0.16 mg/0.8 mg) could have potentially led to an increased risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

The most frequently reported (≥20% subjects overall) treatment emerging AEs (TEAEs) by preferred 
term (PT) during the Dose Escalation Part were CRS (40 [58.8%] subjects), injection-site reaction (33 
[48.5%] subjects), fatigue (32 [47.1%] subjects), pyrexia (excluding the events reported as a 
symptom of concurrent CRS; 20 [29.4%] subjects), and diarrhea (18 [26.5%] subjects). No Grade 3 
or higher CRS events were reported. Overall, 9 (13.6%) subjects had positive anti-drug antibodies 
(ADA) at baseline and 12 (18.2%) subjects had positive ADA on treatment. Presence of neutralizing

Pharmacodynamics 
Refer to section 2.10. Of note, In N=18 (28%) patients B-cells (identified based on CD19 expression) 
were detected (>10 cells/µL). In these patients epcoritamab induced rapid, sustained B-cell depletion 
at all doses tested.

2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
GCT3013-01- A phase 1/2, open-label, dose-escalation trial of GEN3013 in patients with 
relapsed, progressive or refractory B-Cell lymphoma – aNHL cohort 
Methods 
GCT3013-01 is an FIH, phase 1/2, multicenter, dose escalation/expansion, multi cohort, single arm 
trial in subjects aged 18 years or older who had relapsed, progressive and/or refractory mature B-cell 
lymphoma. The trial includes a Dose Escalation Part and an Expansion Part. The expansion part is 
considered to be the pivotal study by the applicant. 
The aim of the Expansion Part of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of epcoritamab using 
the RP2D regimen in subjects with relapsed or refractory (R/R) aggressive NHL (aNHL), indolent NHL 
(iNHL), or MCL who had limited therapeutic options (Figure 10). 
The Expansion Part was conducted in 2 stages for each cohort, as illustrated in Figure 12. In Stage 1, 
subjects with R/R DLBCL, FL grade 1-3A, and MCL were enrolled in each cohort and response data 
were collected. Following separate interim futility analyses in each cohort, conducted in the aNHL 
cohort when approximately 28 subjects had sufficient data (up to 12 weeks of follow up) to be 
evaluable for response, the protocol allowed additional subjects with aNHL, iNHL, or MCL to be enrolled 
for Stage 2 of each cohort to reach the required sample size for statistical analysis. In the aNHL 
expansion cohort, additional subjects with DLBCL were enrolled to reach a total of 139 subjects with 
DLBCL in this cohort. In addition, subjects with other types of LBCL (i.e., HGBCL, PMBCL, and FL 3B) 
were enrolled.

aNHL = aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma; DLBCL = diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; FL = follicular lymphoma; 
iNHL = indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma; MCL = mantle cell lymphoma; ORR = overall response rate; RP2D = recommended 
phase 2 dose. 
 
For the interim analysis, response was determined by Lugano criteria and assessed by the investigator and sponsor based 
on available data (eg, efficacy, safety, pharmacodynamics, biomarkers). The denominator for the interim analysis 
accounted for a 10% dropout rate. 
  Other LBCL subtypes include high grade B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and FL grade 3B. 
  Other iNHL subtypes include marginal zone lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma. 
 
For primary analysis, response was determined by Lugano criteria and assessed by IRC.

•  Treatments 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 67/209 
 
 
 
 
Epcoritamab was administered by SC injection in treatment cycles of 4 weeks, ie, 28 days. A priming 
dose of 0.16 mg (C1D1), an intermediate dose of 0.8 mg (C1D8), and a full dose of 48 mg (C1D15, 
C1D22, and thereafter), was administered according to the following schedule: 
•  Cycles 1 to 3: Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (QW) 
•  Cycles 4 to 9: Days 1 and 15 (Q2W) 
•  Cycle 10 and beyond until unacceptable toxicity, PD, or withdrawal of consent: Day 1 (Q4W) 
During the Expansion Part, hospitalization was only required for a minimum of 24 hours after the first 
full dose of epcoritamab in C1.  
Subject’s treatment was to be discontinued if they had an unacceptable AE, became pregnant, 
withdrew consent, or if the investigator or sponsor believed discontinuation was in the best interest of 
the subject (eg, in case of AEs) or trial (eg, in case of eligibility criteria violation or noncompliance with 
the protocol). Treatment discontinuation was also intended if the subject experienced clinical 
progression or disease progression after factoring in LYRIC for assessment of indeterminate response 
(Cheson et al., 2016).  
During clinical development, the manufacturing processes of the 3001d and 3005a biological 
intermediates, epcoritamab drug substance and drug product were transferred to new manufacturing 
sites to support commercial manufacturing. The manufacturing processes were further developed and 
scaled up. The commercial product was introduced during the conduct of the Expansion Part of the 
GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04 trials during re-supply; therefore, some subjects have received 
epcoritamab drug product manufactured with the 2 different processes. 
Medication Prior to Epcoritamab Administration  
Subjects were premedicated 30 to 120 minutes prior to the first 4 doses of epcoritamab with the 
following in Cycle 1: 
Prednisolone (100 mg oral or IV) or equivalent on D1-D4, D8-D11, D15-18 and D22-D25. 
• 
•  Diphenhydramine (50 mg oral or IV) or equivalent and Acetaminophen (650 to 1000 mg oral) on 
D1, D8, D15 and D22  
For subsequent doses of epcoritamab, premedication and CRS prophylaxis were optional. With regard 
to corticosteroids if CRS≥ Grade 2 occurred following the 4th epcoritamab administration, the 4 day 
consecutive corticosteroids must also be repeated for CRS prophylaxis with each epcoritamab dose 
until 1 full epcoritamab dose is administered without subsequent occurrence of if CRS≥ Grade 2. 
Concomitant Therapy 
For treatment of CRS, subjects were recommended to receive supportive care, including infusion of 
saline, systemic glucocorticosteroids, antihistamines, antipyretics, support for blood pressure 
(vasopressin, vasopressors), support for low-flow and high-flow oxygen and positive pressure 
ventilation and/or mAbs against IL-6R (eg, intravenous administration of tocilizumab). 
Subjects considered to have an increased risk for CTLS were recommended to receive hydration and 
prophylactic treatment with a uric acid lowering agent. If signs of CTLS occurred, supportive therapy, 
including rasburicase, was allowed. The use of growth factors for neutropenia such as granulocyte 
colony stimulating factor was allowed during treatment with epcoritamab. In case of recurring ≥ grade 
3 neutropenia, use of growth factors was mandated. Prophylactic antibiotic, antiviral and antifungal 
therapies were allowed. For patients who are considered to have an increased risk for herpes and/or 
pneumocystis jiroveci infections, prophylaxis is recommended, unless medically contraindicated. For 
patients who are considered to have an increased risk for other infections, prophylactic therapy is 
recommended, unless medically contraindicated.

24 weeks thereafter, physical examination (including constitutional symptoms), ECOG performance 
status, MRD status, and other procedures as necessary. 
•  Sample size 
The Expansion Part of the trial was carried out within 3 cohorts in a 2-stage design. In the aNHL 
expansion cohort, 28 subjects with DLBCL were enrolled in Stage 1. The interim analysis for the aNHL 
cohort was based on ORR as assessed by the investigator and was to be conducted when 
approximately 25 patients with DLBCL had sufficient data (up to 12 weeks of follow-up) to be evaluable 
for response. If the futility criteria were met (no more than 7 responders out of 25 response evaluable 
subjects with up to 12 weeks of follow up), no further expansion was planned. Based on results from 
the interim futility analysis, an additional 100 subjects with DLBCL were to be enrolled to Stage 2, 
along with up to 30 subjects with other types of aNHL (HGBCL, PMBCL, and FL3B). In total, up to 158 
subjects were to be enrolled in the aNHL expansion cohort.  
Assuming a non-evaluable rate of 10%, a sample size of 128 subjects in DLBCL group was estimated 
to provide approximately 90% power to detect the alternative hypothesis of at least 50% ORR while 
ensuring a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 using one-sample exact binomial test under the null 
hypothesis of at most 35% ORR. The probability of futility at the end of Stage 1 was approximately 
30% under the null and 2.1% under the alternative hypothesis

Efficacy Analyses 
Primary endpoint analyses 
Primary analysis for the Expansion Part of this trial was based on IRC-assessed ORR determined by 
Lugano criteria in the FAS. ORR is defined as proportion of subjects who achieved Best Overall 
Response (BOR) of complete response or partial response in an analysis set. The BOR prior to initiation 
of subsequent anti-lymphoma therapy per response criteria was summarized. Number and frequency 
of BOR was presented for response categories per Lugano criteria (Cheson et al., 2014). The ORR, 
disease control rate (BOR of SD and better) and the corresponding 95% exact CI were provided for 
subjects with DLBCL, other LBCL subtypes, and LBCL. Sensitivity analyses of ORR were performed in a 
similar manner as the primary analysis for the following. 
• 
• 
• 
IRC-assessed ORR per Lugano criteria in the PP, RES, and mRES 
IRC-assessed CT-based ORR per Lugano criteria in the FAS and RES 
Investigator-assessed ORR per Lugano criteria in the FAS, PP, RES, and mRES 
Supplemental analyses included subgroup analysis of ORR and concordance between IRC- and 
investigator-assessed BOR based on Lugano criteria in the FAS. 
Secondary endpoints 
Key secondary endpoint of IRC-assessed ORR by LYRIC were provided in the FAS along with 
corresponding 95% exact CI. Additional response category by LYRIC included indeterminate response 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023

(IR). Sensitivity analyses for IRC-assessed ORR by LYRIC were conducted for RES population. Similar 
analyses were also performed for investigator assessed ORR by LYRIC in the FAS. CR rate analyses will 
be performed with a similar manner as ORR. 
TTR and DOR will be derived for subjects who achieved BOR of PR or CR. TTR is defined as the time 
from Day 1 of Cycle 1 to first documentation of objective tumor response (PR or better). DOR is 
defined as the time from the first documentation of response (CR or PR) to the date of PD or death, 
whichever occurs earlier. Date of PD is defined as the earliest date of documented progression after 
which there is no more PR or CR assessment. The DOR will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) 
product-limit method. Similar analysis methods will be used for TTCR and DOCR. DoCR is defined as 
the time from the first documentation of CR to the date of PD or death, whichever occurs earlier. DoCR 
will be derived for subjects reaching CR. 
PFS is defined as the time from Day 1 of Cycle 1 to the date of PD or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs earlier. Date of PD is defined as the earliest date of documented progression after 
which there is no more PR or CR assessment. PFS will be derived for all subjects and analyzed using 
similar methods as DOR. The duration of disease follow-up, defined as the time between Day 1 of 
Cycle 1 to the date of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier, will be calculated based 
on reverse Kaplan-Meier method. 
Clinical progression without documented radiographical progression per Lugano or LYRIC criteria will 
not be considered progression for determination of PFS. Main analysis of PFS will be based on IRC 
disease assessment per Lugano and LYRIC criteria using primary definition in the FAS. Similar analyses 
based on investigator disease assessment in the FAS will also be conducted. 
OS is defined as the time from Day 1 of Cycle 1 to death from any cause. If a patient is not known to 
have died, then OS will be censored at the latest date the patient was known to be alive. Survival 
status will be assessed at least every 3 months after last administration of epocoritamab and continues 
until the patient dies or withdraws from the trial. OS will be derived for all subjects and analyzed in the 
FAS using similar methods as DOR. 
TTNT is defined as the time from Day 1 of Cycle 1 to first recorded administration of subsequent anti-
lymphoma therapy with curative intent or death, whichever occurs earlier. Subjects died due to disease 
progression will be considered an event. Death due to other reasons will be censored at the death 
date. The subsequent anti-lymphoma therapies for TTNT events will in general consist of systemic anti-
lymphoma therapy, and curative intent radiotherapy for one and only target lesion. The exception is 
censoring subject without disease progression while receiving subsequent stem cell transplant after 
responding to epcoritamab to be consistent with the intent to measure duration of clinical benefit using 
TTNT. Subjects alive and without initiation of subsequent anti-lymphoma therapy will be censored at 
the last known alive date. TTNT will be derived for all subjects and analyzed in the FAS using similar 
methods as DOR. 
MRD negativity in PBMCs is defined as  less than 1 tumour clone in 10-6 leukocytes at any on-
treatment time point. MRD assessment in ctDNA (i.e., plasma) was also done (MRD negative defined 
as the absence of any detectable clone sequence per ml volume at any on-treatment time point). For 
evaluation of MRD negativity rate, subjects are considered MRD negative if there is at least one on-
treatment MRD negative whole blood sample; all remaining subjects in the FAS are considered MRD 
positive (e.g. those who only have MRD positive test results or those who have no MRD assessment 
data). Duration of MRD negativity is defined as the number of days from the first documentation of 
MRD- to the date of MRD status change (not MRD-). The primary MRD- threshold is selected as of 10-
5. Other thresholds, including 10-4 and 10-6, may also be explored. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 71/209 
 
 
 
Exploratory analysis of MRD negativity will also be performed in plasma (ctDNA) samples. MRD- 
threshold will be determined by the limit of detection (LOD) of ctDNA in the sample and may be 
reported as either MRD-, MRD+ or not determined for samples that did not pass preanalytical QC by 
the vendor. For evaluation of MRD negativity rate, subjects are considered MRD negative if there is at 
least one on-treatment MRD negative plasma sample; all remaining subjects in the FAS are considered 
MRD positive. 
MRD- rate analyses will be performed in the FAS with a similar manner as ORR, and duration of MRD- 
analyses will be conducted in similar methods for DOR. 
Descriptive statistics for FACT-Lym and EQ-5D-3L assessment along with changes from baseline at 
each assessment time point will be presented for FACT-Lym TOI, FACT-G total score, FACT-Lym total 
scores, subscale scores, and 6-items of special interest and EQ-5D-3L. A line graph summarizing the 
mean change from baseline with standard error bar, with a reference line on the MID will also be 
produced for FACT-Lym TOI, FACT-G total score, FACT-Lym total scores, FACT-LymS and EQ-5D-3L. A 
change from baseline of 11 for the FACT-Lym TOI, of 7 for the FACT-G total score, of 11.2 for the 
FACT-Lym total scores, and of 5.4 for the FACT-LymS are considered minimally importance difference 
(MID) (Webster et. al., 2003). A change from baseline of 0.08 for the EQ- 5D-3L utility index score and 
of 7 for the EQ VAS are considered MID for the EQ-5D-3L (Pickard AS, et. al., 2007). 
Exploratory endpoints 
All biomarker assessments will be performed at a central laboratory. Biomarker assessments that are 
intended to evaluate potential pharmacodynamic markers and to identify markers predictive of 
response or resistance to GEN3013 are exploratory in nature. 
ORR, CR rate based on IRC-assessment per Lugano criteria in the FAS will be summarized within 
subgroups listed along with 95% exact CI in a forest plot for DLBCL and aNHL. In the case a subgroup 
includes less than 20 subjects, the analysis for the given subgroup will not be carried out or combining 
subgroups may be considered. The following analyses have been prespecified: Age (<65 years, 65 to 
<75 years, ≥75 years); Gender (male, female); Race (White, Asian, Black, or Other); Region (North 
America, Europe, other); Baseline ECOG performance score (0, 1, 2 or plus); Baseline weight (< 65 
kg, 65 to < 85 kg, ≥ 85 kg); Number of prior anti-lymphoma therapies (2, 3, 4+); Time from last anti-
CD20 therapy till first dose of GEN3013 (<median, ≥median); Prior CAR-T experience (yes, no); Prior 
ASCT (yes, no); Prior anti-lymphoma therapy status (primary refractory, other); Most recent prior 
anti-CD20 containing therapy (refractory, relapse); Chromosomal abnormality (double-hit, triple-hit, 
other); Ann Arbor staging (I/II, III/IV); IPI (0-2, ≥3); DLBCL disease state (De novo, transformed);  
Molecular classification (GCB, non-GCB); Molecular classification (ABC); Overall presence of ADAs 
(Positive/Non-Positive). 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
As of the data cutoff date of 31 Jan 2022, a total of 219 subjects were screened and 157 subjects 
received at least one dose of epcoritamab in the aNHL expansion cohort. A diagram showing the 
disposition of the 219 subjects screened in the aNHL expansion cohort is provided in Figure 15. 
In total, 62 (28.3%) subjects enrolled (i.e. signed the informed consent form) in the study, but were 
not treated with epcoritamab. These were considered screen failures as the primary reason for not 
being treated was due to ineligibility in 61 subjects and for an otherwise uncategorised reason 
(bridging therapy prior to CAR T-cell therapy) in 1 subject. The latter was an error. This subject was on

Day 26 of washout from previous antineoplastic therapy (post treatment) at the time of screening and 
therefore did not meet the inclusion criteria.

Amendment 5 was prepared to provide details regarding the Expansion Part of the trial. 
Rationale, trial design, objectives/endpoints, inclusion/exclusion criteria, dose schedule 
and administration, objectives/endpoints, statistical analysis (including sample size), 
safety and other relevant sections in the protocol were updated to include information for 
the Expansion Part. 
Definition of end-of-trial was updated. 
Clarified that, in the Dose Escalation Part of the trial, dose escalation could continue as 
planned with the Modified Bayesian optimal interval design if a maximum tolerated dose 
was not reached. 
Clarifications on the end of treatment visit and safety follow-up visit were separate visits.  
Clarified that, in addition to prior cancer therapy, prior cancer surgery, radiotherapy, 
chemo-radiation, systemic treatment regimens, etc. from the time of diagnosis until 
enrollment in this trial were to be reported in the appropriate section of the eCRF at 
screening. 
In response to Health Authority feedback, the safety reporting period after last dose of

epcoritamab was increased to 60 days for the Expansion Part of the trial. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were revised for the Expansion Part of the trial for clarity 
(it was specified that patients needed to have R/R disease) based on Health Authority 
feedback. 
Based on the assessment of the CRS incidence in the Dose Escalation Part of the ongoing 
trial, the steroid prophylaxis period was increased from 3 consecutive days to 
4 consecutive days (Days 1 to 4) for the first 4 doses of epcoritamab 
For the Expansion Part, a bone marrow biopsy was mandated at screening to assess bone 
marrow involvement. 
Rationale for the R2PD to be used in the Expansion Part was added. 
Qualitative interviews (PRO assessment) were added to the PROs in the Expansion Part. 
A cohort of subjects with MCL was added to the Expansion Part of the trial. As a result, 
the trial design was updated in relation to the MCL cohort. 
The inclusion criteria were amended to include a definition of relapsed and refractory 
disease. 
Other key changes made to the protocol were: 
Added ‘duration of CR (DOCR)’ to the secondary endpoints to support the objective of: 
“To further evaluate clinical efficacy as determined by Lugano criteria.” 
Added ‘CR rate determined by LYRIC as assessed by IRC’ and ‘DOCR determined by 
LYRIC as assessed by IRC’ to the secondary endpoints to support the objective of: “To 
evaluate the clinical efficacy as determined by LYRIC”. 
The endpoint of ‘MRD status by detection of cancer cell gene sequences’ was changed to 
‘rate of MRD negativity’. 
Dose modification (dose delay and discontinuation) criteria for the Expansion Part were 
updated to incorporate findings from the ongoing trial. 
Added appendix for grading and management of ICANS. 
Abbreviations: CR = complete response; DOCR = duration of complete response; eCRF = electronic case report form; ICANS = immune effector cell-associated 
neurotoxicity syndrome; IRC = Independent Review Committee; LYRIC = Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria; MCL = mantle cell 
lymphoma; MRD = minimal residual disease; PRO = patient-reported outcome; RP2D = recommended phase 2 dose. 
Changes to the Planned Statistical Analyses - Forest plots were not produced for PFS or OS. Instead, 
results for the subgroup analysis of PFS and OS were presented in table format for this single-arm 
aNHL expansion cohort. Due to missing baseline tumor biopsies, subject consent preference, and/or 
unevaluable assay results, all exploratory MRD analyses were performed using the MRD-evaluable 
subset, which included subjects who had ≥1 baseline or on treatment MRD sample and were either 
MRD positive or not evaluated at baseline. A retrospective, central FISH analysis was performed on 
available diagnostic baseline tumor tissue sections to identify MYC, BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements 
(i.e., HGBCL by FISH) with a consistent method. A FISH Analysis Set was defined for these analyses. 
Protocol Deviations 
A summary of all protocol deviations in the aNHL cohort (N = 157) of the GCT3013-01 trial expansion 
part grouped by deviation type is presented in Table 21 and important protocol deviations are 
summarized in Table 28. At least one important protocol deviation occurred in 6 (3.8%) subjects in the 
aNHL expansion cohort. None of the important protocol deviations were deemed to have had a 
meaningful impact on the interpretation of the trial results.

Other includes 9 subjects with high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL), 5 subjects with follicular lymphoma (FL) grade 3B 
Important protocol deviations included the following: 
•  Enrollment criteria (3 subjects):  
o  Subject who did not meet inclusion criterion No. 6, local laboratories pre-C1D1 platelet level 
was 47 × 109/L, under the required level of 50 × 109/L, and also did not meet inclusion 
criterion No. 7, local laboratories pre-C1D1 neutrophil level was 0.5 × 109/L, under the 
required level of ≥1.0 × 109  
o  Subject’s CR for clear cell renal cell carcinoma was maintained <2 years prior to first dose, a 
violation of exclusion criterion No. 21 in the Expansion Part of the trial 
o  Subject had received prior allogeneic HSCT. 
•  Dosing (2 subjects): 
o 
Prophylactic medication administered 3 days instead of 4 days for C1D1  
o  Mandatory prophylactic corticosteroids were not administered at C1D17 
Informed consent: subject was incorrectly consented to the wrong trial (a different trial with 
epcoritamab being conducted at the same site); however, the correct informed consent form was 
signed prior to study drug administration. 
A request for a routine GCP inspection has been adopted for the escalation part of the GCT3013-01 
study. Overall it is the recommendation of the inspectors that the data of the escalation part of the 
GCT3013-01 clinical trial can be used for evaluation and assessment of the application 
(EMA/IN/0000118168). 
In general the conduct of the escalation part of the GCT3013-01 clinical trial was not fully ICH-GCP 
compliant, based on the critical and major deviations mentioned in the integrated inspection report. 
The observed findings, however, were unlikely to have a significant impact on data integrity within the 
inspected escalation part of the GCT3013-01 clinical trial according to the inspectors. The inspection 
team did not identify any restrictions on the usability of the reported trial data. The escalation part of 
GCT3013-01 clinical trial is still considered to be conducted within internationally accepted ethical 
standards. Although critical and major findings were reported that could have affected the integrity of 
the collected and reported data, the inspectors consider the data of the escalation part of the 
GCT3013-01 clinical trial, as reported in the corresponding CSR, to be acceptable. The responses to the 
inspection report including the timely implementations of the actions for ongoing (if applicable) and 
future clinical studies, as set out in the CAPA plan, will further enhance the quality of clinical trials 
performed by Genmab.

A normal baseline renal function was observed in 67 (42.7%) patients in the aNHL cohort, 63 (40.1%) 
patients had a mildly impaired renal function. In total 24 (15.3%) subjects (had moderately impaired 
renal function and no subjects had severely impaired renal function. These numbers were 57 (41.0%), 
59 (42.4%) and 21 (15.1%) and 0 in DLBCL patients. 
Baseline hepatic function was normal in 122 (77.7%) of the patients in the aNHL cohort, mild 
dysfunction was seen in 30 (19.1%) of the patients and moderate dysfunction in 1 (0.6%) patient. In 
DLBCL patients these numbers were 109 (78.4%); 26 (18.7%) and 1 (0.7%) respectively. Baseline 
renal function calculated based on estimate creatine clearance using the Cockcroft Gault method. 
Approximately two-thirds of patients with LBCL (97 [61.8%] subjects) had Ann Arbor stage IV

allogeneic HSCT, which was identified as an important protocol deviation. Of the 31 (19.7%) subjects 
with LBCL who had prior ASCT, more than half of those subjects (18 of 31 subjects) relapsed within 12 
months of ASCT treatment. The primary reason that subjects with DLBCL (N=139) were considered 
ineligible for ASCT included insufficient response to prior treatment (60 [43.2%] subjects), age 
38 [27.3%] subjects), prior transplant (28 [20.1%] subjects), comorbidities (11 [7.9%] subjects), and 
ECOG performance status (2 [1.4%] subjects). Prior CAR T therapy was seen in 53 (38.1%) of the 
DLBCL patients and in 61 (38.9%) of the LBCL patients. 
Over half of the subjects (96 [61.1%] subjects) with LBCL had primary refractory disease and three-
quarters (119 [75.8%] subjects) were refractory to ≥2 consecutive prior lines of anti-lymphoma 
therapy. Prior systemic therapy given to iNHL subjects prior to transformation was included in the 
calculation of number of prior LOT.

•  Numbers analysed 
All efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS. The FAS population included 157 LBCL patients: 139 
patients with DLBCL and 18 with other subtypes. 
Sensitivity analyses were also performed for the PP set (N=150; subjects in the FAS with measurable 
disease at baseline and no important protocol deviations), RES (N=153; subjects who had measurable 
disease at baseline, and either at least 1 postbaseline disease evaluation or died within 60 days of first 
dose without postbaseline disease assessment), and the mRES (N=144; all subjects in the RES who 
had received at least 1 full dose of epcoritamab). The post-hoc retrospective central FISH analysis was 
performed in the FISH analysis set (n=88). 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
As of the data cutoff date of 31 Jan 2022, median duration of follow-up was 10.7 months (range: 0.3, 
17.9) and 11.0 months (range: 0.3, 17.9) for subjects with LBCL and DLBCL, respectively. In subjects 
with LBCL or DLBCL, the median number of cycles initiated was 5.0 (range: 1, 20) and the median 
duration of treatment was 4.1 months (range: 0, 18).

Sensitivity analyses primary endpoint 
The sensitivity analyses for were consistent with the primary analyses. Except the CT based ORR on 
IRC Assessment (Lugano Criteria) were a lower number of CRs was seen (21.6%; 95%CI: 15.3%, 
28.9%) in LBCL patients (FAS). 
Sensitivity analysis in PPS, RES and mRES were largely consistent with the results in the main primary 
endpoint efficacy analysis, with an ORR of 62.1% (95% CI: 53.3, 70.4) and CRR of 38.6% (95%CI: 
30.3, 47.5) in the DLBCL PPS population (n=132), an ORR of 63.0% (95%CI: 54.2, 71.1) and CRR of 
40.0% (95%CI: 31.7, 48.8) in the DLBCL RES population (n=135), an ORR of 66.9% (95%CI: 58.0, 
75.0) and CRR of 42.5% (95%CI: 33.8, 51.6%) in the DLBCL mRES population (n=127). 
While not explicitly stated in the endpoint definitions (statistical methods), the ORR, CRR, DOR and 
DOCR reported in the study results include patients that achieve PR/CR following previous PD (by 
Lugano) or IR (by LYRIC). 
During the review, updated efficacy data were provided from the clinical DCO of 30 June 2022. At this 
DCO, the primary efficacy endpoint of ORR as assessed by the IRC using Lugano criteria was 
unchanged in DLBCL and LBCL patients. The CR rate as assessed by the IRC was also unchanged. 
Secondary endpoints 
Duration of response 
In subjects with LBCL who had achieved PR or CR (n=99), the median DOR was 12.0 months (95% CI: 
6.6, NR). The estimated percentage of subjects remaining in response at 3, 6, and 9 months was 
74.6%, 62.2%, and 60.6%, respectively (Figure 16).

In a sensitivity analysis which regarded start of new therapy as an event the updated median DOR in 
DLBCL patients was 12.0 months (95% CI: 5.6, NR). 
Duration of complete response 
In subjects with LBCL, the median DOCR was 12.0 months (95% CI: 9.7, NR). The estimated 
percentage of subjects remaining in response at 3, 6, and 9 months was 96.0%, 86.3%, and 86.3%, 
respectively.  
In the DLBCL cohort, the median DOCR was 12.0 months (95% CI: 9.7, NR). The estimated 
percentage of subjects remaining in response at 3, 6, and 9 months was 95.7%, 85.3%, and 85.3%, 
respectively. 
As of the 30 June 2022 DCO, the updated median DOCR (as assessed by the IRC using Lugano criteria) 
was not yet reached (95% CI: 14.3, NR) in DLBCL patients (with a median DOCR follow-up time of 9.7 
months). The median duration was the same in LBCL patients. Using the secondary definition (see DOR) 
the median DOCR was NR (95%CI: 12.0, NR) in DLBCL patients. In a sensitivity analysis which 
regarded start of new therapy as an event the updated median DOCR was NR (95%CI: 10.4, NR) in 
DLBCL patients. 
PFS 
Table 35 presents the PFS based on IRC assessment (Lugano criteria) per the primary definition for 
subjects in the aNHL expansion cohort. A Kaplan-Meier plot of PFS (primary definition) based on IRC 
assessment is presented in Table 35 and Figure 17 for subjects in the aNHL expansion cohort. PFS 
according to the secondary definition is in line with the primary definition. The median PFS in subjects 
with DLBCL was essentially unchanged at the Jun-30-2022 DCO, with a median PFS of 4.4 months 
(95% CI: 3.0, 8.8) at the 30-Jun-2022 DCO.

TTR 
For subjects with LBCL (based on 99 responders) and for subjects with DLBCL (based on 
86 responders), median TTR based on IRC assessment was 1.4 months (range: 1.0, 8.4). For both 
subjects with LBCL (based on 61 responders) and subjects with DLBCL (based on 54 responders), 
median TTCR based on IRC assessment was 2.7 months (range: 1.2, 11.1). 
LYRIC 
Using LYRIC the ORR was 63.1% (N=99 [95%CI 53.3%, 70.0%]) with a CR in 38.9% (N=61 [95%CI 
30.7%, 47.5%] in LBCL patients. The TTR and TTCR were identical for Lugano criteria and LYRIC. Both 
the median DOR and median DOCR were NR (9.7, NR) months and the median PFS was 8.3 (4.4, NR) 
months in LBCL patients.

TTNT 
The median TTNT was 7.4 months (95% CI: 5.9, 10.8) with 82 (52.2%) LBLC subjects experiencing a 
TTNT event. Median TTNT was 8.2 months (95% CI: 6.0, 13.9) among subjects with DLBCL. 
MRD 
The overall number of subjects with MRD results per PBMC assay (using clonoSEQ next-generation 
sequencing assay) was low (n=55). The incidence of overall MRD negativity per PBMC assay using the 
10-5 cutoff is N= 37 (67.3%; 95% CI 53.3%, 79.3%) in LBCL patients and N=32 ( 68.1%; 95% CI 
52.9%, 80.9%) in 47 evaluable DLBCL patients. There are no very large differences in frequencies of 
MRD negativity when the 10-4 or 10-6 threshold are used. A low correlation of MRD with clinical 
response was observed, as evidenced by a high rate of subjects with PD who were assessed as 
MRD-negative.

For the ctDNA assay, the overall MRD negativity rate (at any time point) among subjects with LBCL 
who were MRD-evaluable (N=107) was 45.8% (95% CI: 36.1, 55.7) using the clonoSEQ next-
generation sequencing assay. Median duration of MRD negativity was not reached, and an estimated 
78.7% of subjects (95% CI: 62.4, 88.5) were remaining in MRD negativity at 6 months. Subjects who 
achieved MRD-negative status had improved PFS compared with subjects who were MRD-positive, see 
Figure 19 DOR per MRD and response status is shown in Figure 20.

ORR in HGBL subjects with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements 
Efficacy analysis based on FISH results were performed post-hoc. Based on central laboratory FISH 
analysis of screening tumor tissue available from 88 subjects enrolled in the DLBCL cohort, 12 (13.6%) 
subjects had tumors with MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 rearrangements. The ORR (CR + PR) in subjects 
with HGBCL by FISH (N=12) was 50.0% (95% CI: 21.1, 78.9), with 4 (33.3%) and 2 (16.7%) subjects 
achieving best response of CR and PR, respectively. For subjects with HGBCL by FISH (N=12), the 
median DOR among all responders was 12.0 months (95% CI: 1.1, NR), with 83.3% of subjects 
remaining in response at 6 and 9 months. 
Four additional subjects enrolled as having DLBCL, who did not have central FISH results available, 
were classified as having DH/TH disease (HGBL with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL2 rearrangements) 
based on local FISH analysis. Two of these 4 subjects achieved a best response of CR based on IRC 
assessment as determined by Lugano criteria. In addition, there were 2 subjects with DH per central or 
local FISH analysis among the 9 HGBCL subjects. In these 18 subjects with  DLBCL/HGBCL DH/TH

CD20 expression 
Per the local laboratory analyses 146 (93.0%) subjects with LBCL were positive for CD20 at baseline. 
Baseline CD20 expression based on CD20 single-plex IHC is plotted per response group in Figure 24. 
Per these central laboratory analyses, the median baseline CD20 was 100.0% (range 0% to 100%). 
Overall, high expression of CD20 was observed in almost all IHC-evaluable subjects, in spite of prior 
CD20 treatments, and patients with low CD20 expression represent a minor proportion of the heavily 
pre-treated patient population. Expression levels below 50% were observed in 8 out of 113 central 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) evaluable and response evaluable patients. Low levels of expression were 
observed in some of the non- responders (PD), but one low expression was also observed in a subject 
with PR.

The applicant has presented the DLBCL expansion cohort (N=36) of the GCT3013-04 phase 1/2 clinical 
trial in Japanese subjects with R/R B-NHL, as a supportive study. This is an open-label, single-country, 
interventional, multicohort, phase 1/2 trial in Japanese subjects with R/R B-NHL. The trial consists of 
2 parts: a Dose Escalation Part and an Expansion Part. Treatment in the expansion part was the same

as in the pivotal GCT3013-01 trial. The Monotherapy Expansion Part of the trial was conducted in 2 
cohorts of subjects with R/R DLBCL or FL patients. The eligibility criteria were comparable to the 
GCT3013-01 trial except that patients were to be of Asian race and Japanese ethnicity. In the DLBCL 
cohort, patients with DLBCL, including DLBCL DH/TH disease (formally HGBCL with MYC and BCL2 
and/or BCL6 according to the 2016 WHO classifications), were recruited. 
As of the data cutoff date of 31 Jan 2022, a total of 36 subjects were enrolled and received ≥1 dose of 
epcoritamab in the DLBCL expansion cohort. In total 19 (52.8%) patients were female. The median 
age was 68.5 years (range: 44, 89). Most subjects had a baseline ECOG performance status of 
0 (58.3%) or 1 (36.1%). Subjects who had not received a prior ASCT were required to be ineligible for 
transplant; reasons for ineligibility included age (66.7%), ECOG performance status (2.8%), prior 
transplant (16.7%), and other (13.9%; ie, lymphoma in peripheral blood, refractory, resistant or 
refractory to chemotherapy, and not applicable). The median number of prior lines of anti-lymphoma 
therapy was 3.0 (range: 2, 8), with 44.4% having received 2 prior lines of therapy, 25.0% having 
received 3 prior lines of therapy and 30.6% having received ≥4 prior lines of therapy. 
As of the data cutoff date of 31 Jan 2022, the median duration of follow up was 8.4 months (range: 
1.5, 12.0) for the DLBCL expansion cohort. Based on IRC assessment determined by Lugano criteria, 
the ORR (CR + PR) was 55.6% (95% CI: 38.1, 72.1). The CR rate was 44.4% (95% CI: 27.9, 61.9). 
Based on IRC assessment, the median DOR was not reached. The estimated percentage of subjects 
remaining in response at 6 months was 69.3% (all responders) and at 9 months was 59.4% (all 
responders); for those achieving CR, 61.9% remained in CR at both 6 and 9 months. The median PFS 
was 4.1 months (95% CI: 1.2, not reached). The median OS was not reached. The estimated 
percentage of subjects who remained alive at 9 months was 59.8% (95% CI: 38.5, 75.8). 
Real word evidence study 
The applicant provided a real word evidence (retrospective cohort) study to characterize the ORR, CR 
and DOR among patients with R/R DLBCL treated with chemotherapy, single agent 
rituximab/obinutuzumab, single-agent lenalidomide, or combinations of these agents in the R/R 
treatment setting. Other time to event endpoints were also collected but these are not reflected here.  
This retrospective observational study was conducted using data from multiple clinical centers 
(academic, for-profit, community, and hospital systems) in the US and housed in the COTA EHR 
database. Longitudinal patient-level data were used to describe clinical endpoints and patient 
characteristics. The design of the study is displayed in Figure 25.

The index date for a given line of treatment was defined as the initiation date of the first treatment for 
each relevant line of treatment. To characterize each specific line of treatment, patients’ demographic 
and baseline clinical characteristics were assessed during the pre-index period. When multiple 
observations of the demographic or clinical characteristics were available, the observation closest to 
the index date was used. 
The overall COTA EHR database included an estimated 5,000 adult patients with DLBCL with a 
treatment record and diagnosis between January 1, 1994 to March 31, 2022. Patients selected for this 
analysis had a record of treatment and diagnosis of DLBCL between 01 January 2010 and March 31st 
2022. A diagnosis of DLBCL was based on a record of pathological confirmation of an initial DLBCL 
diagnosis. Some main eligibility criteria were comparable to the pivotal study, however patients in this 
study had R/R disease previously treated with ≥1 line of systemic therapy instead of 2 lines and 
patients in this study did not have to be ineligible to HSCT/had received prior HSCT contrary to the 
pivotal study. 
The total number of patients treated with a regimen of interest in the R/R treatment setting (i.e., with 
≥1 prior line of treatment) and included in the study was 573; of these, 179 (31.1%) patients had ≥2 
prior lines of treatment, and 77 patients (13.4%) ≥3 and 35 (6.1%) ≥4. The year of diagnosis was 
between2010-2015 for 52.5% and between 2016-2021 for 47.5% of the patients.  
Baseline characteristics of the real-world study population differed from the pivotal study population 
among others in less lines of treatment, more ECOG 2 patients, lower IPI scores, and different types of 
prior therapies compared to the pivotal study population. 
In the real-world study population (ie, patients with ≥1 prior LOT, N=573); the ORR was 52% (95% 
CI:48%-56%), the CR rate was 23% (95% CI: 19%-27%). In the subgroup of patients with ≥2 prior 
lines of therapy (n=179); the ORR and CR rate were 40% (95% CI: 33%- 48%) and 13% (95% CI: 
8%-19%), respectively. The DOR and DOCR in the overall study population (i.e., patients with ≥1 prior 
LOT) were 3.5 (95%CI:3.0-4.7) months and 18.4 (95%CI:11.8-32.7) months, respectively. In the 
subgroup of patients with ≥2 prior lines of therapy these numbers were 2.7 (95%CI: 1.9-3.4) months 
and 9.6 (95%CI: 4.9-28) months, respectively. 
Limitations to this study as indicated in the report are amongst others, differences in tumor response 
data or the timing of response assessment, the use of COTA’s proprietary algorithm to define what 
constituted a line of treatment may differ from a physicians intentions. Incomplete records and 
documentation of information, variability in the quality of information recorded by physicians, difficulty 
verifying information found in the database, and differences in clinical practices across study sites are 
also limitations. Finally, the study findings may not be generalizable to the general patient population 
with R/R DLBCL in the US.

In response to the 1st LoQ the applicant provided additional data comparing polatuzumab vedotin in 
combination with BR (polatuzumab + BR) with epcoritamab (DCO: 30 June 2022), see Table 48. The 
efficacy and safety of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with BR (polatuzumab + BR) was evaluated 
in a pivotal, global, multicentre, open-label trial (GO29365) which included a randomized cohort of 80 
subjects with previously treated DLBCL (40 subjects each in the polatuzumab + BR arm or BR arm), 
using results as publication by Sehn 2020 at a median follow-up of 37.6 months. In this article the IRC 
response assessment is used instead of investigator assessed ORR and longer follow up is provided 
compared to the data in the SmPC which was used for Table 45. See Table 47, Table 48 and Table 49.

At the request of the CHMP the applicant provided additional data comparing Columvi (glofitamab) with 
epcoritamab. Glofitamab is a CD20-CD3 T-cell engaging, bispecific antibody, for the treatment of adult 
patients with R/R DLBCL, after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy and received a positive CHMP 
opinion and EC decision for a CMA within this procedure. To demonstrate that epcoritamab addresses 
the unmet medical need to at least a similar extent to glofitamab, the applicant has conducted a cross-
trial comparison. Baseline disease characteristics were largely comparable between the GCT3013-01 
(epcoritamab) and NP30179 (glofitamab) trials.

MAIC Analysis of Epcoritamab vs Glofitamab 
Unanchored matching adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (MAIC) were conducted to estimate the 
comparative efficacy of epcoritamab for the treatment of R/R DLBCL (in patients with at least 2 prior 
LOT) from the GCT3013-01 trial vs the glofitamab NP30179 trial. As the subject populations of both 
trials are similar, with both trials including subjects with prior CAR T therapy 1, all 139 subjects within 
the GCT3013-01 trial were included in the comparison: subject-level data from the GCT3013-01 trial 
(epcoritamab) and published data from the glofitamab NP30179 trial.  
Following minor adjustments in the baseline characteristics, including age, sex, disease stage, prior 
CAR T, primary refractoriness, ECOG status, prior ASCT, and refractoriness to the last anti-CD20 
agent, an effective sample size of 127 subjects from the GCT3013-01 trial was compared to the 154 
subjects in the NP30179 trial. The unadjusted and adjusted ORR were 61.9% and 61.9%, respectively 
with epcoritamab and 51.6% with glofitamab (p = 0.0761 and p = 0.075, respectively). 
The unadjusted and adjusted CRR were comparable between epcoritamab (38.3% and 38.4%) and 
glofitamab (39.6%) (p = 0.929 and p = 0.863, respectively).

Subjects treated with epcoritamab vs glofitamab showed comparable OS, with HR = 0.798 in the 
unadjusted population (p = 0.188) and HR = 0.803 in the adjusted population (p = 0.209) and had 
comparable PFS. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study population in this application is the aNHL cohort of the expansion phase of the 
GCT3013-01 study. The escalation phase of this study was used for dose finding. The DLBCL cohort of 
the GCT3013-04 study in Japanese subjects and a real world evidence study are presented as 
supportive studies.  
GCT3013-01 study is an FIH, phase 1/2, single arm trial in subjects aged 18 years or older who had 
relapsed, progressive and/or refractory mature B-cell lymphoma including an expansion part with a 
(so-called) aNHL cohort, an iNHL cohort and a MCL cohort. The expansion part of the aNHL cohort, also 
referred to as LBCL cohort, is considered to be the pivotal study. In general the design is considered 
appropriate for an exploratory study. However, the single arm trial design introduces inherent 
limitations as the therapeutic effect might be subject to various sources of bias. In addition, efficacy 
may be overestimated in such a study design. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with 
caution. The incidence of LBCL/DLBCL may have allowed for an (underpowered) comparative trial, 
however, this application is interpreted in light of the CMA requested by the applicant. Scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/4478/2/2020/III) was requested for the pivotal study and proposed confirmatory study. 
The applicant largely adhered to the advice. 
There is no hypothesis or otherwise a-priori specification of success criterion for the primary endpoint 
as is expected of a clinical trial submitted as pivotal evidence for MA (ICH E9 Statistical Principles for 
Clinical Trials, CPMP/ICH/363/96). The applicant states hypotheses for sample size calculation, but 
they are not carried on as success criteria under statistical methods. Moreover, the hypotheses were 
criticised in SA (EMEA/H/SA/4478/2/2020/III) for being less conservative than e.g. the one selected 
for tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah). As such, the sample size hypotheses are not adequate in defining 
success in the sought therapeutic context. The applicant received scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/4478/2/2020/III) where challenges for undertaking a two-arm trial was acknowledged, 
but it was stated that even an underpowered RCT would have been preferable. No statistical 
hypothesis or clear success criterion was prespecified for the primary endpoint, as is expected of 
clinical trials submitted as pivotal evidence for an MA.  
A study population of certain LBCL types namely DLBCL patients plus ≤30 patients with PMBCL, HGBL 
and FL3B with relapsed or refractory (R/R) disease after at least 2 lines of systemic therapy including 
at least 1 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody-containing therapy were included. CD20-positivity was based 
on a representative pathology report but histopathological testing to confirm CD20-positive DLBCL was 
not requested. This is considered unfortunate considering the nature of therapy and the fact that 
patients may be CD20 negative after having received anti CD20 therapy. Patients measured CD20 
negative during the study were therefore not reported as protocol violations. According to the inclusion 
criteria (as specified in amendment 7), patients with DH/TH DLBCL (technically HGBL with MYC and 
BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements according to the 2016 WHO classification), were also included in 
the DLBCL group. Patients needed to either have failed prior HSCT, or be ineligible for autologous 
HSCT. The eligibility criteria are considered appropriate to select the target population and thus 
considered acceptable.  
The posology was investigated in the escalation part of the GCT3013-01 study (see below) and 
premedication/CRS prophylaxis consisted of prednisolone, diphenhydramine and acetaminophen. This 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 111/209 
 
 
 
is adequately reflected by section 4.2 in the SmPC. Epcoritamab is to be given until unacceptable 
toxicity, PD, or withdrawal of consent. No adequate justification for continued treatment in those 
responding to therapy is provided. As the continued dosing was part of the studied regimen, it will not 
be possible to propose another regimen without clinical data. During the Expansion Part of the 
GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04 trials some subjects have received epcoritamab drug product 
manufactured with the 2 different processes. 
The primary endpoint of the study is ORR, which is considered an objective measure of tumour burden 
and an appropriate endpoint in a single-arm trial, if supported by DoR, which is included as a 
secondary endpoint in the study. It is noted that the ORR, CRR, DoR and DoCR reported includes 
patients who achieved PR/CR following previous PD (by Lugano) or IR (by LYRIC). The inclusion of 
these patients is acceptable, as it is thought to be reflective of pseudo-progression or delayed response 
upon start of epcoritamab therapy. This is also reflected in the SmPC section 5.1. For the response 
evaluations after 24 weeks, the time between assessments is increased from every 6 weeks to every 
12 weeks. Because the true time of progression between the two timepoints is unknown, a long period 
between assessments may bias the estimated duration of response upwards. Sensitivity analyses were 
provided to evaluate the extent of any bias due to interval censoring, the results from these suggest 
that the results are not overly influenced by the longer period between assessments. The single arm-
nature of study GCT3013-01 means that in particular time-to-event endpoints such as PFS and OS 
should be interpreted with caution. 
The study was separated in two stages, with an interim analyses to be performed when approximately 
25 patients with DLBCL had sufficient data (up to 12 weeks of follow-up) to be evaluable for response. 
The study was to proceed if more than seven patients had an ORR based on investigator assessment. 
The results for ORR and DoR were provided  separately for Stage 1 and 2, with separate results also 
for those patients reported in the interim analyses report. The ORR is comparable between the stage 1 
and stage 2 cohorts for the IRC assessment. This provides reassurance that the decision to continue 
the study was not based on over-optimistic early results and that the patient population was similar in 
both stages. The sample size for Stage 2 is prespecified for DLBCL only and this sample size was 
increased by 8% after interim analysis. The sample size of the other subtypes of aNHL than DLBCL is 
small and makes it challenging to evaluate treatment effect across these other subtypes. The results 
for the full aNHL cohort are therefore driven by DLBCL.  
The amendments and deviations are not expected to have a significant impact on the study, however it 
should be noted that the amendments on the design of the expansion part were made while the 
escalation part was going, thus with possible knowledge of the outcomes. Thus, a data driven design of 
the expansion phase cannot be excluded. The last protocol amendment for the expansion part took 
place after the first subject signed informed consent for the expansion part. Amendment 7 was dated 
23-Sep-2020, which is after the date at which the first subject signed informed consent (19-Jun-2020). 
Some patients had likely already been enrolled at the time of protocol amendment 7, as the data 
monitoring committee noted that on Oct-19-2020, 31 aNHL patients had been enrolled, 13 patients 
were in screening and 13 patients had had screening failures. In light of the exploratory nature of the 
study and the request for CMA, this is considered acceptable. 
The dose escalation part of study GCT3013-01 was used for dose finding. In general, the design of this 
study is considered acceptable, however there are some issues identified. Determining of the optimal 
biological dose rather than determining the MTD would have been preferred, moreover the design and 
sample size do not allow to compare all the different posologies. There is some evidence from non-
clinical and clinical E-R data from the dose escalation study supporting the rationale for a type of step 
up dosing, as well as relevant literature from other bispecific antibodies indicating that the use of step 
up dosing would reduce CRS, however such data to directly confirm this are missing as CRS rates 
without priming/intermediate dosing are not known. Considering that this regimen was used in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 112/209 
 
 
 
pivotal clinical study this issue is not pursued. A dose optimisation cohort of Study GCT3013 01 is to 
investigate a different step up regimen in addition to hydration recommendations in DLBCL patients.  
Based on PD and efficacy doses between 12 mg and 60 mg would have been acceptable. The 
occurrence of CRS is numerically higher in the 24 mg group (reason for this is not understood), but 
more or less comparable between the other doses between 12-60 mg. The applicant stated that the 
posology was selected based on modeling of the CRS rates, however this is not evident from the safety 
data alone. Therefore, the choice of 0.16 mg/0.8 mg/48 mg as the RP2D based on the available safety 
is not objected, however it is uncertain whether the most optimal dose has been selected. Of note, no 
formal dose response study was conducted.  
In addition, during the study strategies to mitigate CRS were amended from cohort 7 onwards and 
again for the expansion cohort. It does appear that less CRS events were seen starting from cohort 7 
compared to the previous cohorts, however this may also be influenced by changes in (step) up dose. 
Some support for the pivotal study may also derive from this study in terms of efficacy, but it should 
be considered that different B-NHL patients were included in the study and different posologies were 
used. 
A routine GCP inspection has been performed for the escalation part of the GCT3013-01 study 
(EMA/IN/0000118168). Inconsistencies regarding the safety listings and the registration of AEs were 
identified (see Clinical Safety discussion). An update of the CSR is requested post-authorisation (see 
Annex II). In general the conduct of the escalation part of the GCT3013-01 clinical trial was not fully 
ICH-GCP compliant, based on the critical and major deviations mentioned in the integrated inspection 
report. The observed findings, however, were unlikely to have a significant impact on data integrity 
within the inspected escalation part of the GCT3013-01 clinical trial according to the inspectors. The 
inspection team did not identify any restrictions on the usability of the reported trial data and consider 
that the data of the escalation part of the GCT3013-01 clinical trial, as reported in the corresponding 
CSR, can be used for evaluation and assessment of the application. The escalation part of GCT3013-01 
clinical trial is still considered to be conducted within internationally accepted ethical standards. The 
responses to the inspection report including the timely implementations of the actions for ongoing (if 
applicable) and future clinical studies, as set out in the CAPA plan, will further enhance the quality of 
clinical trials performed by Genmab (see also discussion on Clinical Safety). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
As of the data cutoff date of 31 Jan 2022, a total of 219 subjects were screened. In total 157 subjects 
received at least one dose of epcoritamab in the aNHL expansion cohort and 62 (28.3%) patients were 
screen failures and thus the FAS may be considered similar to the ITT in this study. In total, 13 
subjects did not meet the inclusion criterion 2.a.i.1, according to Amendment 7 (CD20+ DLBCL per 
WHO 2016 or 2008 classification). The applicant did not collect details on the pathology report. This 
means that patients did not have a CD20+ biopsy, or that diagnosis was found to be a disease entity 
other than DLBCL (de novo/transformed) and DH/TH HGBL (prior to opening of stage 2). This is not 
further pursued considering the requested indication. 
The trial is ongoing and the date of last observation for last subject recorded as part of the database 
for this analysis has not yet been reached. 
The baseline data reflect a R/R LBCL population after multiple systemic therapies (at least 2); 29.3% 
had 2 prior therapies, 31.8% had 3 prior therapies and 38.9% had 4 or more prior therapies. In total 
88.5% (N=139) DLBCL patients, 5.7% (N=9) HGBL patients, 2.5% (N=4) PMBCL patients and 3.2% 
(N=5) FL3B patients are included (by local laboratory). However, the DLBCL group included at least 16 
patients with high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 113/209 
 
 
 
(according to the 2016 WHO classification; see below). Despite that most patients were ineligible for 
ASCT very few patients with ECOG 2 were included. Incorrect identification of patients having prior 
transplant was found at one site. The applicant clarified that no additional misunderstandings of this 
nature occurred. 
The median duration of follow-up was 10.7 months (range: 0.3, 17.9) for patients with LBCL and 11.0 
months (range: 0.3, 17.9) for patients with DLBCL. The primary endpoint ORR was 63.1% (95% CI: 
55.0, 70.6) in LBCL patients with 38.9% (95%CI: 31.2, 46.9) of the patients in CR. In the subgroup of 
DLBCL patients these numbers are comparable with an ORR of 61.9% (95%CI: 53.3, 70.0) and CR 
rate of 38.8% (95%CI: 30.7, 47.5). The median DOR was 12.0 months (95% CI: 6.6, NR) in LBCL and 
DLBCL patients. There is extensive censoring in the DoR curve. The majority of patients who were 
censored were censored due to “clinical cutoff”, the applicant confirmed that these patients were alive, 
progression free and still actively in follow up at DCO. In the secondary censoring definition of DOR 
(according to treatment policy strategy) patients who received anti-cancer medication are continued to 
be followed up until progression or death (or censored at the DCO date). The estimated median DOR 
for the secondary definition is consistent with the estimated DOR for the primary definition (using the 
hypothetical strategy). In addition, the sensitivity analysis where start of new therapy is considered an 
event is a more conservative analysis, and as expected, a certain reduction in DOR, DOCR and PFS was 
observed. Overall, the provided sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the efficacy results 
provided.  
The median DOCR was 12.0 months (95% CI: 9.7, NR) in LBLC and DLBCL patients. Acknowledging 
the uncertainties associated with the study design, the response rates in combination with the duration 
of response are considered to be clinically relevant and indicate anti-disease activity of epcoritamab in 
the study population. Updated efficacy analyses from a data cut-off (DCO: 30 June 2022; median 
study duration follow-up of 15.7 months) indicate similar response rates compared to the primary 
analyses. The median DOR in subjects with LBLC is 15.5 (9.7, NR) months and 15.6 months (95% CI: 
9.7, NR) in DLBCL patients. The DOR for epcoritamab at the DCO date of 18 November 2022 is based 
on 86 DLBCL responders. The point estimate and the 95% confidence intervals for the median DOR are 
15.5 months (9.7 months, 20.8 months). 
No meaningful information is available regarding treatment of immunosuppressed patients. This 
information is adequately reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
In the other LBCL entities response were seen in all five FL3B (3 patients in CR), in all four PMBCL 
patients (2 patients in CR) and in 44% (N=4/9) HGBL patients with 2 in CR. The DoR data from the 
other LBCL entities appear in range with the DoR from DLBCL patients. 
Regarding FISH results at trial entry, 36 patients with DLBCL had local laboratory results to assess 
genetic rearrangements. Of these, 16 patients had MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 rearrangements, classified 
as HGBCL with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements according to WHO 2016 criteria (Swerdlow 
et al., 2016). Based on central laboratory FISH analysis of screening tumor tissue available from 88 
patients enrolled in the DLBCL cohort, 12 (13.6%) had tumors with MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 
rearrangements. Of the 51 subjects with DLBCL that did not have central FISH testing, 4 subjects had 
local FISH testing results indicating 2 were DH and 2 were TH. Combined with the above this indicates 
that DH/TH patients were among the DLBCL population. Among the 9 HGBCL subjects in the study, 
specimens from 4 HGBCL subjects were available for central FISH testing. Of these, 1 HGBCL subject 
was DH. Of the 5 HGBCL subjects without central FISH testing, 1 HGBCL subject had local FISH testing 
results of DH. In total, 18 subjects from the DLBCL and “other aggressive B-NHL” groups had DH/TH 
arrangement by either central or local FISH testing. Efficacy analysis based on central FISH results 
were performed post-hoc. The ORR (CR + PR) in subjects with DH/TH HGBL by central FISH (N=12) 
was 50.0% (95% CI: 21.1, 78.9), with 4 (33.3%) and 2 (16.7%) subjects achieving best response of 
Assessment report

Page 114/209 
 
 
 
CR and PR, respectively. For subjects with DH/TH HGBCL by FISH (N=12), the median DOR among all 
responders was 12.0 months (95% CI: 1.1, NR). In the 18 subjects with DLBCL/HGBCL DH/TH 
lymphomas the ORR =50.0% [95% CI: 26.0, 74.0] and CRR=33.3% [95% CI: 13.3, 59.0)]. A slightly 
lower efficacy is observed in these patients compared to the LBCL population, which may be explained 
by the poorer prognosis in these patients. Nonetheless these numbers are considered clinically 
relevant. 
Clinically relevant results have also been observed in patients with PMBCL, and FL3B disease. Although 
the number of patients within these disease entities were small, based on the MoA of epcoritamab and 
similarities in disease and biology from the LBCL entities to DLBCL, benefit could also be expected in 
these disease entities.  
PFS and OS appear in support of the primary endpoint; the median PFS was 4.4 months (95%CI: 3.0, 
7.9) in LBCL patients and 4.4 months (95%CI: 3.0, 8.2) in DLBCL patients. The median OS was NR 
(95%CI: 11.3, NR) in both LBCL and DLBCL patients. The other secondary endpoints (TTNT, TTR) also 
support the ORR. Time to response (TTR) was 1.4 months in the DLBCL population, which was close to 
first postbaseline disease assessment. Time to complete response (TTCR) was 2.7 months for DLBCL, 
which was close to the second postbaseline assessment. The results for this endpoint indicate a 
relatively rapid response, which is considered beneficial in a population with aggressive and rapidly 
progressing disease. It needs to be considered that time-dependent endpoints cannot be reliably 
assessed in single arm trials and that it is uncertain whether responses translate into OS benefit. As 
such confirmatory data is needed.   
A total of 7 (4.5%) subjects received a subsequent allogeneic HSCT, and 1 (0.6%) subject received a 
subsequent ASCT. Each of these subjects had a BOR of PR (1 subject) or CR (7 subjects, including the 
subject who received ASCT) per IRC using Lugano criteria. 
With regard to the exploratory analyses, PROs are difficult to interpret in a single arm trial. Of the 157 
patients in the study, in total 146 (93.0%) were CD20 positive per local lab and N=8 (5.1%) of the 
patients were CD20 negative (level of expression of CD20<50%). All but one of these patients did not 
respond to treatment. Of note, the responding subject had an expression level of approximately 20% 
and expression of CD20 <20% as a cut-off was not discussed by the applicant. The applicant indicated 
that expression levels below 50% were observed in 8 out of 113 central immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
evaluable and response evaluable LBCL patients. All but one of these patients had PD as BOR. One 
patient had a PR as BOR.  The label reports that there are limited data available on patients with 
CD20-negative DLBCL treated with epcoritamab and that these patients may have less benefit 
compared to patients with CD20-positive DLBCL. It was noted in subgroup analysis that DLBCL 
patients with less than median (5.1 months) time between the last dose of anti-CD20 therapy and the 
first dose of epcoritamab, had lower ORR (46%, 95%CI: 34, 59%) than those with longer than the 
median time (ORR 77%, 95%CI: 66, 86%). This cut-off is, however, arbitrary, and not clinically 
relevant. This variation can likely be attributed to different baseline disease characteristics and prior 
treatment history including shorter time from diagnosis to first dose, with more aggressive disease in 
the patient groups with poorer results. A comparison was requested of epcoritamab efficacy (ORR and 
CR-rate) in patients with low B-cell counts at baseline vs those with normal/increased B-cell counts (B-
cell depletion in this instance acting as a surrogate marker of residual functional effects of prior anti-
CD20 treatment). The responses observed in the subgroup of patients with low B-cell count (< 100 
Cells/uL) were lower compared to those with normal/increase B-cell count (≥ 100 Cells/uL) at baseline. 
However the responses are still considered clinically relevant, and the subgroup with low B-cell count 
constituted the majority of the study population (126/139 DLBCL patients), thus restrictions on the 
indication based on B-cell counts are not considered justified based on these data.  
GCT3013-04 is a phase 1/2 clinical trial in Japanese subjects with R/R B-NHL and the DLBCL cohort

(N=36) of this study is presented as an supportive study. In a similar population to the GCT3013-01 
study the ORR based on IRC assessment by Lugano criteria was 55.6% (95% CI: 38.1, 72.1) with a 
CR rate of 44.4% (95% CI: 27.9, 61.9). The median DOR was not reached at a median follow up of 
8.4 months. Thus, these data support the pivotal study. Real world study data was also provided as 
supportive evidence, however there were several limitations and uncertainties that limit the 
interpretation of these data, including differences in the pivotal study population and the real world 
study population, differences in timing of response analyses, the response criteria used and not 
including more recently approved therapies into the real world data set. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The applicant has requested a conditional marketing approval. As stated, the single arm, dose 
escalation - expansion design introduces uncertainties to the observed therapeutic effect and 
confirmation of efficacy in the R/R DLBCL population is required for a full approval. The phase 3 
GCT3013-05 trial is proposed as a confirmatory study. This ongoing trial compares treatment with 
epcoritamab to standard-of-care immunochemotherapy (i.e., R-GemOx or BR) in subjects with R/R 
DLBCL and HGBL, with the primary endpoint of OS. While the study population of the GCT3013-05 is 
not the same as the pivotal study population in terms of lines of treatment and included LBCL 
subtypes, the results of the GCT3013-05 study are considered to be relevant to confirm the B/R of the 
epcoritamab in the treatment of R/R DLBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The design of 
this trial as a confirmatory study was considered acceptable in scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/4478/2/2020/III) which is agreed. The applicant updated the sample size calculations, 
such as the expected HR and the number of events needed. With the updated design the applicant has 
mitigated some of the main concerns expressed by the CHMP at the time of scientific advice. Some 
concerns remain regarding the potential for inconclusive results, particularly in the subgroups. Given 
the open label nature of the study, it is also important to ensure that the treatment decisions of 
patients remaining in follow up will not be impacted by the interim results. A submission of a type II 
variation in the EU will take place after the final OS analysis (due date Q4 2024). A 5-year follow-up 
for safety is planned and will be part of the amended protocol. The applicant will provide the final CSR 
of study GCT3013-01, the pivotal study for this application, as specific obligation.  
For the purpose to discuss the MTA the applicant provided an inter-trial comparison of efficacy and 
safety data. Limitations associated with inter-trial comparisons should be noted, particularly when 
there are (small) differences in study population and differences in methods to measure response 
duration. Compared to Minjuvi, Zynlonta and Columvi, available therapies with a CMA, comparable or 
higher ORR and CR rates are observed for epcoritamab, thus indicating that epcoritamab addresses the 
unmet medical need to at least a similar extent than Minjuvi, Zynlonta and Columvi. Compared to 
available therapies for the target population with a full approval, epcoritamab has numerically higher 
rates in terms of ORR and CR rate compared to R-Gem-OX, BR, Pixuvri and Kymriah, but numerically 
similar or lower rates in terms of ORR and CR rate compared to Yescarta and Breyanzi. However, an 
advantage of epcoritamab versus the CAR-T cell therapies Yescarta and Breyanzi is that epcoritamab is 
immediately available (off-the-shelf), and that epcoritamab does not require administration in a 
specialized centre. This is considered to constitute a MTA over the CAR T-cell therapies. Compared to 
Polivy+ BR in terms of ORR and CR rate it cannot be concluded that epcoritamab has numerically 
higher rates. When considering the median DOR cross study comparison seems to favor epcoritamab 
over polatuzumab + BR, but potential differences in analysis methods should be taken into account. 
Compared to polatuzumab + BR, epcoritamab has shown evidence of activity in patients who have 
failed prior CAR t cell therapy (CR/ORR/DoR) while polatuzumab + BR has yet to demonstrate effect in 
this setting. DOR results also appear to support an MTA. Therefore, it is considered that epcoritamab 
will provide meaningful clinical effects in patients with R/R DLBCL and thus constitute an additional 
treatment option in this non-curative 3L+ setting.

The applicant claims overcoming drug resistance associated with the current available therapies 
approved in the EU, but a population resistant to approved therapies was not explicitly targeted. The 
included population nonetheless included a substantial portion of patients refractory to their last line of 
therapy, as well as to specific defined therapies, such as CAR-T cell products. The applicant considers 
that that the patient population enrolled in the epcoritamab study (GCT3013-01) was more refractory, 
had higher risk, and poorer prognosis compared to other available therapies, however subgroups of 
these patients have also been included in clinical studies which led to approvals in the target 
population and therefore it cannot be stated that this justifies an MTA. The route of administration as 
subcutaneous (SC) is considered to be of ease by the applicant, however it is uncertain if this led to 
advantages for patients such as decreased hospitalisation, and reduced treatment burden and does not 
constitute a MTA. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinically relevant responses and duration of response were observed in the study population of LBCL 
subtypes DLBCL NOS, HGBL, PMBCL as well as in FL3B who are R/R after two or more lines of systemic 
therapy.  
The single arm trial phase 1/2 design introduces inherent limitations as the observed therapeutic effect 
might be subject to various sources of bias. In addition, efficacy may be overestimated in such a study 
design. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution and confirmation of efficacy in the R/R 
DLBCL population is required for a full approval. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
• 
• 
In order to confirm the safety and efficacy of epcoritamab in the treatment of R/R DLBCL after 
two or more lines of systemic therapy, the results of the primary (including final OS analysis) 
and final safety and efficacy analyses for study GCT3013-05 should be submitted.  
In order to confirm the safety and efficacy of epcoritamab in the treatment of R/R DLBCL after 
two or more lines of systemic therapy, the final CSR for study GCT3013-01 should be 
submitted. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
• 
The provision of the updated CSR of GCT3013-01-ESC CSR (see Annex II).  
The applicant accepted a recommendation from the CHMP to provide the results of a dose optimisation 
cohort of Study GCT3013-01 investigating a different step up regimen (0.32/1.6/48mg versus 
0.16/0.8/48mg) in addition to hydration recommendations in DLBCL patients.  
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
Mechanism of action 
Epcoritamab is a bispecific antibody recognizing the T-cell antigen CD3 and the B-cell antigen CD20. 
The mechanism of action of epcoritamab is induction of T cell-mediated killing of CD20-positive cells by 
co-engaging CD3 on T cells and CD20-expressing B cells. As a result, epcoritamab induces cytolytic 
synapse formation and kills CD20-positive target cells, independent of ligation of a peptide-MHC 
complex by the T cell receptor. Epcoritamab can induce cytotoxic activity in both CD4+ and CD8+ 
T-cells. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 117/209 
 
 
 
The safety profile of CD3-binding bispecific antibodies share features with that of CAR T-cells, both 
being T-cell-redirecting treatments associated with a risk of unique complications such as cytokine 
release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) and tumour 
flare. However, adverse events commonly seen with conventional chemotherapy are also reported with 
bispecific antibodies including fatigue, cytopenias, infections, diarrhoea and elevated liver enzymes. 
Tumour lysis syndrome has also been reported (Salvaris et al., 2021). 
Preclinical safety 
Effects of epcoritamab observed in cynomolgus monkeys included cytokine release and consequent 
clinical signs (vomiting, hunched posture, subdued behaviour), depletion of peripheral blood B cells, 
and decreased lymphoid cellularity in lymphoid tissues. Slightly lower haemoglobin concentrations and 
haematocrits were also observed. The findings considered associated with elevated cytokine levels 
were observed primarily following the first dose (please refer to the non-clinical assessment). 
In the current assessment safety data of epcoritamab in LBCL are presented from the pivotal 
Study GCT3013-01 and the supportive study GCT3013-04 (Table 51)

Data pooling 
In total, data were evaluated from the 374 subjects with various B-cell lymphomas assigned to the 
48 mg epcoritamab full dose from the two clinical trials GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04 (Table 51). The 
data for subjects treated at the proposed dosing regimen were combined into 2 safety pools and then 
divided into 5 safety analysis groups as follows: 
•  Safety Pool 01 [GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)]: Combines subject data from the Escalation and 
Expansion Parts of the global GCT3013-01 trial. The following groups were analysed in Safety 
Pool 01: 
o 
LBCL group (N=167) includes subjects with DLBCL (de novo or transformed), PMBCL, HGBCL, 
and FL grade 3b [Primary safety analysis pool]  
o  DLBCL group (N=148) includes subjects with DLBCL (de novo or transformed)

1.  Safety Pool 01+04 [GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP)]: Combines subject 
data from the Escalation and Expansion Parts of GCT3013-01 with subject data from the Escalation 
and Expansion Parts of the GCT3013-04 trial conducted in Japan. The following groups were 
analysed in Safety Pool 01+04: 
2.  LBCL group (N=208) includes subjects with DLBCL (de novo or transformed), PMBCL, HGBCL, 
and FL grade 3b. 
3.  DLBCL group (N=188) includes subjects with DLBCL (de novo or transformed) 
4.  All B-NHL group (N=374) includes subjects with LBCL, iNHL (128 subjects), and MCL (38 
subjects) [Supportive safety analysis pool] 
The on-treatment period (treatment-emergent) was defined as the time from day of first dose of trial 
medication to 60 days (28 days for GCT3013-01 dose escalation) after last dose of trial medication, or 
initiation of new anti-lymphoma therapy, whichever comes first. 
Updated safety analyses 
As requested by the CHMP in the D120 LOQ, the applicant presented updated safety analyses based on 
a more recent data cut-off date (30 June 2022 versus the previous 31 Jan 2022) providing 5 additional 
months of safety information from the pivotal trial GCT3013-01 and the supportive trial GCT3013-04. 
The updated safety analyses included no new subjects in the primary safety pool 01 LBCL group 
(N=167), but 57 additional subjects in the supportive safety pool 01 + 04 All B-NHL group (N=431). 
The safety evaluation strategy applied to the new data was identical to that used in the initial safety 
analyses. 
The safety profile of epcoritamab reported in the updated analyses was generally consistent with the 
reporting in the original submission, and the data presented in this overview are mainly those derived 
from the initial safety analyses based on the DCO date of 31 Jan 2022. However, findings from the 
updated analyses are also included where considered relevant. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Exposure 
The used posology was epcoritamab administered as a SC injection in 28-day cycles (4 weeks) starting 
with a QW dosing regimen, followed by administration Q2W and then Q4W (Figure 26). To mitigate the 
potential for CRS, the first 2 doses of epcoritamab administered on C1D1 (priming dose [0.16 mg]) 
and C1D8 (intermediate dose [0.8 mg]) were lower than the subsequent full 48-mg dose administered 
on C1D15, C1D22, and thereafter. Subjects received epcoritamab according to the proposed dosing 
regimen of 0.16 mg priming dose on C1D1 (except for of 3 subjects in the GCT3013-01 Dose 
Escalation Part who were in the 0.08 priming cohort), 0.8 mg intermediate dose on C1D8, 48 mg full 
dose on C1D15, C1D22, and thereafter until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

No dose reduction of epcoritamab on an individual subject level was allowed. A re-priming cycle was 
necessary if dose was delayed at certain time points (eg, >6 weeks between full doses during 
GCT3013-01 expansion). A re-priming cycle consisted of a weekly schedule of a priming dose, 
intermediate dose, and 2 full doses. 
The recommendations for re-priming were based on PK considerations. Using popPK model estimated 
individual concentrations, the “safe re-priming window” (i.e. time interval since last dose where no re-
priming is considered necessary) was defined as the time required for the epcoritamab concentration 
to drop below priming dose Ctrough in maximum 5% of patients. Consequently, the time interval 
varies depending on the last dose given (priming dose, intermediate dose, first/second full dose, 
QW/Q2W/Q4W full dose).  
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), median duration of treatment was 3.7 months (range: 0, 
20) and median number of cycles of treatment administered per subject was 5.0 (range 1, 22). The 
majority of subjects (69.5%) received 3 or more cycles of treatment. A total of 99 (59.3%) subjects 
initiated C4 treatment, providing a conservative estimation of subjects who received 3 months of 
treatment. Similarly, 69 (41.3%) subjects initiated C7, approximating 6 months of treatment; 59 
(31.5%) subjects initiated C10, approximating 9 months of treatment; 30 (18.0%) subjects initiated 
C13 treatment, approximating 12 months of treatment. As the data cutoff, 53 (31.7%) subjects were 
still on treatment (Table 53). 
Median RDI was 100.0% during the QW, Q2W, and Q4W dosing schedules. Overall, 62 (37.1%) 
subjects required a dose delay, including 46 (27.5%) subjects due to an AE and 20 (12.0%) subjects 
who required a dose delay for another reason, including COVID-19 control measures (Table 52). No 
subjects required epcoritamab re-priming due to the dose delay.  
Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), median duration of treatment was 3.7 months 
(range: 0, 20) and median number of cycles of treatment administered per subject was 5.0 (range 1, 
22). The majority of subjects (71.1%) received 3 or more cycles of treatment. A total of 220 (58.8%) 
subjects initiated C4 treatment, providing a conservative estimation of subjects who received 3 months 
of treatment. Similarly, 143 (38.2%) subjects initiated C7, approximating 6 months of treatment; 87 
(23.3%) subjects initiated C10, approximating 9 months of treatment; 45 (12.0%) subjects initiated 
C13 treatment, approximating 12 months of treatment. As the data cutoff, 175 (46.8%) subjects were 
still on treatment (Table 53).

Median RDI was 100.0% during the QW, Q2W, and Q4W dosing schedules. Overall, 152 (40.6%) 
subjects required a dose delay, including 124 (33.2%) subjects due to an AE and 42 (11.2%) subjects 
who required a dose delay for another reason, including COVID-19 control measures (Table 52). Three 
(0.5%) subjects required epcoritamab re-priming due to a dose delay: 1 LBCL subject (from GCT3013-
04) and 2 iNHL subjects. The subject with LBCL required epcoritamab re-priming due to a dose delay 
of approximately 4 weeks in the receipt of C1D22 dosing due to a TEAE of UTI reactivation. One iNHL 
subject with SLL had a dose delay due to COVID-19 of approximately 12 weeks following the C5D1 full 
dose (48 mg) and then had their re-priming dose (0.16 mg) just prior to the data cutoff date. The 
other iNHL subject with FL had a dose delay of approximately 8 weeks due to serious TEAEs of 
pneumonia (grade 3) and Bell’s palsy (grade 3) and then received 3 additional doses of epcoritamab 
(0.16 mg priming/0.8 mg intermediate/48 mg full) before the subject withdrew from treatment. The 
pneumonia was considered related to epcoritamab by the investigator.

Subject disposition 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), 114 (68.3%) subjects discontinued treatment, mostly for 
the primary reason of disease progression in 87 (52.1%) subjects (Table 53). There were 53 (31.7%) 
subjects who continued to receive epcoritamab treatment as of the data cutoff. Overall, 12 (7.2%) 
subjects discontinued study treatment due to a TEAE; these events were assessed by the investigator 
as unrelated to treatment in 9 of 167 subjects (5.4%) and as treatment-related in 3 of 167 subjects 
(1.8%) (ICANS, CRS, and CLIPPERS). For 1 (0.6%) subject, the primary reason for discontinuation 
from study treatment was death, a fatal TEAE of impaired general physical health deterioration in the 
context of disease progression that was assessed by the investigator as unrelated to treatment. 
Additional reasons for discontinuation from study treatment included decision to proceed with 
transplant for 7 (4.2%) subjects, subject withdrawal for 4 (2.4%) subjects, and other for 3 (1.8%) 
subjects (i.e., physician decision, initiation of new anti-lymphoma treatment, and bridging therapy 
prior to CAR-T therapy).  
Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), 199 (53.2%) subjects discontinued treatment, 
mostly for the primary reason of disease progression in 147 (39.3%) subjects (Table 53). There were 
175 (46.8%) subjects who continued to receive epcoritamab treatment as of the data cutoff.  
A higher percentage of subjects remain ongoing in the All B-NHL group (46.8%) compared to the LBCL 
groups in Safety Pools 01 and 01+04 (31.7% and 33.2%, respectively). This is driven by the 
GCT3013-01 iNHL expansion cohort (N=105) in the All B-NHL group wherein 67 (63.8%) subjects 
remained on treatment as of the data cutoff and enrolment is still ongoing. As expected, 
discontinuation due to disease progression was less in subjects in the iNHL expansion cohort (19.0%) 
than in the LBCL groups in Safety Pools 01 and 01+04 (52.1% and 52.9%, respectively) due to less 
aggressive disease. 
Overall, 19 (5.1%) subjects discontinued study treatment due to a TEAE; 12 of the subjects were in 
Safety Pool 01 and are described above. In the other 7 subjects who discontinued study treatment due 
to a TEAE, the events were assessed by the investigator as unrelated to treatment in 6 of the subjects 
and as treatment-related in 1 subject with MCL (CRS and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in the 
same subject). For 5 (1.3%) subjects in the All B-NHL group (N=374), the primary reason for 
discontinuation from study treatment was death, either due to fatal TEAEs assessed by the investigator 
as not related to treatment (general physical health deterioration [described above], pneumonia, lung 
opacity, or COVID-19 pneumonia) or disease progression. Additional reasons for treatment 
discontinuation included decision to proceed with transplant for 12 (3.2%) subjects, subject withdrawal 
for 9 (2.4%) subjects, and other for 7 (1.9%) subjects (i.e., physician decision for 5 subjects, and 
initiation of new anti-lymphoma treatment and bridging therapy prior to CAR-T therapy in 1 subject 
each).

2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
 Overview of adverse events 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), as of the data cutoff date, 166 (99.4%) subjects 
experienced at least 1 TEAE (Table 54). Of these, 140 (83.8%) subjects experienced TEAEs considered 
related to epcoritamab by the investigator. A total of 105 (62.9%) subjects experienced at least 1 
grade 3 or higher TEAE, and 47 (28.1%) subjects had grade 3 or higher TEAEs considered related to 
epcoritamab by the investigator. Serious TEAEs were reported in 97 (58.1%) subjects and were 
considered related to epcoritamab in 61 (36.5%) subjects.  
Fatal TEAEs were reported for 12 (7.2%) subjects; 1 fatal TEAE was assessed as related to 
epcoritamab by the investigator (a grade 5 ICANS event). TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation 
were reported in 13 (7.8%) subjects and to dose delay in 60 (35.9%) subjects. AESIs of CRS were 
reported for 84 (50.3%) subjects, ICANS in 10 (6.0%) subjects, and CTLS in 2 (1.2%) subjects. Grade 
3 or higher AESIs of CRS were reported for 4 (2.4%) subjects, of ICANS for 1 (0.6%) subject, and of 
CTLS for 2 (1.2%) subjects.

Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
TEAE profiles were similar that reported above for Safety Pool 01, except for: 
• 
• 
The incidence of CRS in LBCL subjects (N=208) was higher in Safety Pool 01+04 (57.2%) than in 
Safety Pool 01 (50.3%) (Table 54), which was driven by the CRS rates reported in GCT3013-04 
Escalation Part (83.3%; 5/6 subjects) and Expansion Part (83.3%; 30/36 subjects). 
The incidence of CRS in All B-NHL subjects (N=374) was higher in Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL 
subjects (61.5%) compared to LBCL subjects in Safety Pools 01 and 01+04 (50.3% and 57.2%, 
respectively) (Table 54), which reflects higher rates of CRS reported in the GCT3013-01 iNHL 
Expansion Cohort (66.7%; 70/105 subjects) and MCL Expansion Cohort (54.1%; 20/37 subjects); 
as well as in GCT3013-04 in LBCL (as above) and the GCT3013-04 iNHL (FL) Expansion cohort 
(90.5%; 19/21 subjects). Grade 3 or 4 CRS in the GCT3013-01 MCL expansion cohort (10.8%; 
4/37 subjects) was higher than in Safety Pool 01+04 (4.3%). 
Based upon the activity of epcoritamab as a bispecific T-cell engager, CRS, ICANS, and CTLS were 
considered AESIs in the GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04 trials. CRS was the most common, reported in 
approximately 49% to 61% of subjects across groups in Safety Pools 01 and 01+04 (Table 54). The 
incidences of ICANS and CTLS were approximately 5% to 6% and 1%, respectively. In general, AESIs 
were primarily grades 1 and 2, resolved, and were manageable with dose delay and/or supportive 
care. In the section on AESIs, these are discussed in more detail.

a 4 of the subjects in All B-NHL reported in this row (4, 3, 4, and 3 of the subjects in each column, respectively) are also reported 
by investigator with primary cause of death as disease progression. 
Note: Safety Pool 01 includes GCT3013-01. Safety Pool 01+04 includes GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04. All B-NHL is composed 
of the LBCL population plus subjects with iNHL (n=128) and MCL (n=38) from the escalation and expansion parts of the trials. 
Percentages calculated based on N.  
Note: Adverse events are classified using MedDRA v24.1 and CTCAE v5.0, and are counted only once per category.  ICANS is 
graded according to (Lee et al 2019), CRS as per (Lee et al 2019), and CTLS according to Cairo-Bishop (Coiffier et al 2008).

In the Safety Pool GCT3013-01 ESC+EXP R/R LBCL group (primary safety analysis pool), the majority 
of all TEAEs, Grade ≥3 TEAEs, and serious AEs were reported as recovered/resolved (78.3%, 64.4%, 
and 80.1%, respectively). The corresponding percentages of treatment-related events with an outcome 
of recovered/resolved were higher (all, 88.6%; Grade ≥3, 73.7%; and serious, 93.3%). Events (any or 
treatment-related) with other outcomes were most generally reported as not recovered/not resolved, 
and few had a fatal outcome. Overall, 0.2% of TEAEs were reported as recovered/resolved with 
sequelae; all of these were nonserious. 
Regarding AESIs, an outcome of recovered/resolved was reported for 98.4% of CRS events, 90.0% of 
ICANS events, and 33.3% of CTLS events. The few remaining AESI occurrences were either not 
recovered/not resolved (2 events each for CRS and CTLS) or fatal (1 event of ICANS). 
In the Safety Pool GCT3013-01+ GCT3013-04 ESC+EXP All B-NHL group (supportive safety analysis 
pool), the outcome distribution pattern for all TEAEs, Grade ≥3 TEAEs, and serious AEs (any or 
treatment-related) was similar to that of the primary safety analysis pool. 
TEAEs over time 
TEAEs were analysed over time following initial epcoritamab administration. Interpretation of these 
data require consideration of the length of time and dosing schedules during each time period chosen 
for analysis. Dosing schedules were changed after the Escalation Part of trial GCT3013-01 as shown in 
Figure 26 resulting in differences in doses of epcoritamab with the GCT3013-01 Expansion Part and the 
GCT3013-04 Escalation and Expansion Parts.

serious TEAEs considered related to epcoritamab by the investigator was greater during the initial 
treatment period up to week 8 compared with any of the subsequent treatment periods. Most AESIs 
occurred early in treatment. Of the 84 total subjects with CRS, only 3 were reported to have CRS after 
the Week ≤8 period; similarly, only 1 out of the 10 subjects with ICANS, and 0 out of the 2 subjects 
with CTLS, had these events after Week 8. All grade 3 or higher AESIs were reported during the 
Week ≤8 period. 
Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), the incidence of TEAEs and TEAEs considered 
related to epcoritamab by the investigator, both overall and grade 3 and higher, as well as serious 
TEAEs and serious TEAEs considered related to epcoritamab by the investigator was greater during the 
initial treatment period up to week 8 compared with any of the subsequent treatment periods. Most 
AESIs occurred early in treatment. Of the 230 subjects with CRS, only 9 were reported to have CRS 
after the Week ≤8 period; similarly, only 2 out of the 23 subjects with ICANS, and 0 out of 5 with 
CTLS, had these events after Week 8. All grade 3 or higher AESIs were reported during the Week ≤8 
period. 
Safety update (DCO 30 June 2022): Consistent with the initial results, the overall incidence of 
TEAEs, both overall and grade 3 or 4, as well as serious TEAEs and serious TEAEs considered related to 
epcoritamab by the investigator were greater during the initial treatment period up to Week 8 
compared with any of the subsequent treatment periods. Most AESIs occurred during the Week ≤8 
period.

Regarding the incidences of TEAEs over time: 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), the highest incidences of TEAEs over time were during the 
first period (Week ≤8). This was true for all SOCs except for Infections and infestations, which had 
similar incidences during the Week ≤8 period (26.9% of 167 subjects), Week 12 to ≤36 period (28.8% 
of 104 subjects), and Week 36+ period (28.3% of 53 subjects).  
Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), the highest incidences of TEAEs over time were 
during the first period (Week ≤8). This was true for all SOCs except for Infections and infestations, 
which had similar incidences during the Week ≤8 period (27.8% of 374 subjects), the Week 12 to ≤36 
period (29.4% of 235 subjects), and the Week 36+ period (30.4% of 92 subjects). 
The updated safety analyses (DCO 30 June 2022) confirmed that the highest incidences of TEAEs 
over time were during the first period (Week ≤8), except for the incidence for the Infections and 
infestations SOC. This is further discussed in the section on Infections later in this overview. 
Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events 
Grade 3 or higher TEAEs by SOC and PT in Safety Pools 01 and 01+04 are provided in Table 56, 
summarized by frequency of grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (≥5% of subjects) and all fatal TEAEs (TEAEs that 
resulted in death). Cytopenias were the only grade ≥3 TEAEs reported in ≥5% of subjects. Cytopenias 
(e.g., neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia) were managed through dose delay and/or G-CSF for 
neutropenia. No TEAEs of any cytopenia led to treatment discontinuation. 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), out of 166 (99.4%) subjects with ≥1 TEAE, the range of 
worst severity grades were as follows (Table 54): Grade 1 = 20 (12.0%) subjects, Grade 2 = 41

(24.6%) subjects, Grade 3 = 62 (37.1%) subjects, Grade 4 = 31 (18.6%) subjects, and Grade 5 = 12 
(7.2%) subjects. 
In Safety Pool 01 LBCL subjects, grade 3 or 4 TEAEs reported in ≥5% of subjects included neutropenia 
in 26 (15.6%) subjects, anemia in 17 (10.2%) subjects, and neutrophil count deceased and 
thrombocytopenia in 10 (6.0%) subjects (Table 56). 
Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), out of 368 (98.4%) subjects with ≥1 TEAE, the 
range of worst severity grades were as follows (Table 54): Grade 1 = 34 (9.1%) subjects, Grade 2 = 
86 (23.0%) subjects, Grade 3 = 144 (38.5%) subjects, Grade 4 = 85 (22.7%) subjects, Grade 5 = 19 
(5.1%) subjects. 
In Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL subjects, grade 3 or 4 TEAEs reported in ≥5% of subjects included 
neutropenia in 52 (13.9%) subjects, neutrophil count deceased in 37 (9.9%) subjects, anemia in 32 
(8.6%) subjects, lymphocyte count decreased in 24 (6.4%) subjects, and thrombocytopenia in 20 
(5.3%) subjects (Table 56).

Treatment-related TEAEs based on investigator assessment 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in Safety Pools 01 and 01+04 assessed by the investigator as 
treatment-related are summarized in Table 55. In general, most TEAEs considered related to 
epcoritamab by the investigator were low-grade (grade 1 or 2). There was 1 treatment-related fatal AE 
of ICANS. 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), out of 140 (83.8%) subjects who experienced ≥1 TEAE 
considered treatment-related by the investigator, 47 (28.1%) subjects had ≥1 grade 3 or higher 
treatment-related TEAE: 
Treatment-related TEAEs reported in ≥10% of subjects included CRS in 84 (50.3%) subjects, injection 
site reaction in 37 (22.2%) subjects, neutropenia in 30 (18.0%) subjects, fatigue in 25 (15.0%) 
subjects, and pyrexia in 19 (11.4%) subjects. 
•  Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events reported in ≥2% of subjects included 
neutropenia in 19 (11.4%) subjects; neutrophil count deceased in 6 (3.6%) subjects; and anemia 
and CRS in 4 (2.4%) subjects each (Table 57). 
Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), out of 332 (88.8%) subjects who experienced ≥1 
TEAE considered treatment-related by the investigator, 145 (38.8%) subjects had ≥1 grade 3 or 
higher treatment-related TEAEs: 
• 
Treatment-related TEAEs reported in ≥10% of subjects included CRS in 230 (61.5%) subjects, 
injection site reaction in 115 (30.7%) subjects, neutropenia in 54 (14.4%) subjects, fatigue in 50 
(13.4%) subjects, and pyrexia in 40 (10.7%) subjects. 
•  Grade 3 or higher treatment-related TEAEs reported in ≥2% of subjects included neutropenia in 39 
(10.4%) subjects; neutrophil count decreased in 29 (7.8%) subjects; lymphocyte count decreased 
in 17 (4.5%) subjects; CRS in 16 (4.3%) subjects; anemia, thrombocytopenia, and platelet count 
decreased in 10 (2.7%) subjects each; and lymphopenia in 8 (2.1%) subjects (Table 57).

Adverse events of special interest 
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
Taking into consideration the anticipated risk of CRS, precautions to minimize the incidence and 
severity of CRS were implemented in the GCT3013-01 trial including guidelines on management, 
premedication, prophylactic corticosteroids, hospitalizations, and monitoring. Consistent measures 
were followed in GCT3013-04. Please refer to the efficacy part for more information on premedication. 
The AESI of CRS was analysed and summarised at the subject level and at the event level. In the 
subject-level analysis, subjects with multiple CRS events were counted only once and may have been 
counted in more than 1 dosing period. In the event-level analysis, all CRS events are counted, 
including multiple episodes experienced by the same subject.

Subject level analysis 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), 84 (50.3%) subjects experienced at least 1 CRS event 
(Table 59), and the maximum grade was 1 or 2 in 80 of the 84 subjects. Most subjects had a 
maximum grade 1 event (52 subjects; 31.1%), with 28 (16.8%) subjects having a maximum grade 2 
event and 4 (2.4%) subjects having a maximum grade 3 event. No grade 4 or grade 5 events of CRS 
occurred. Fever was reported in 83 of the 84 subjects, hypotension in 26 of the 84 subjects, and 
hypoxia in 16 of the 84 subjects. 
The highest rate of CRS was reported in association with the first full dose of 48 mg epcoritamab on 
C1D15 (43.6%; 68 subjects), followed by the intermediate dose on C1D8 (12.9%; 21 subjects) and 
the priming dose on C1D1 (6.6%; 11 subjects) (Table 58). Seven (4.6%) subjects had a CRS event 
after the second full dose (C1D22). Almost all CRS events occurred during the first cycle, as only 4 
(2.8%) subjects had a CRS event at some point after the third full dose. 
A total of 77 (46.1%) subjects with LBCL received a concomitant medication for the treatment of CRS, 
including tocilizumab in 25 (15.0%) subjects and corticosteroids (beyond those scheduled for CRS 
prophylaxis) in 18 (10.8%) subjects. 
Twelve (7.2%) subjects had CRS that led to dose delay and 1 (0.6%) subject, with prior recurrent 
CRS, had a grade 1 CRS episode on D116 (in C4) and concomitant grade 3 fatigue in the setting of 
disease progression that led to treatment discontinuation. All other subjects continued treatment. 
The median time to first CRS onset was 16.0 days (range: 1, 55), generally following administration of 
the first full dose of 48 mg epcoritamab on C1D15 (Table 59). Median time to onset was 17.2 hours 
(range: 12, 105) from the priming dose, 70.7 hours (range: 12, 213) from the intermediate dose, 19.9 
hours (range: 12, 126) from the first full dose, 81.0 hours (range: 19, 86) from the second full dose, 
and 73.9 hours (range 33, 118) from any subsequent full doses (Table 58). The median time to CRS 
resolution in the primary GCT3013-01 ESC+EXP R/R LBCL analysis set was 3.0 days (range: 1 to 27 
days).

Note: CRS events are graded according to (Lee et al 2019). Percentages are based on number of treated subjects in the analysis 
period. For partial CRS onset time, time to CRS onset will be imputed as 12 hours if CRS onset date falls on the same date as the 
most recent dosing date, or CRS onset time would be imputed as T00:00 if later than the most recent dosing date. For CRS 
resolution time, CRS onset and resolution time would be imputed as T00:00 and T23:59, respectively, if time component is 
missing. 
a Other includes the following preferred terms: confusional state, dizziness, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, dyspnea, chills, 
tremor, arthralgia, tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, C-reactive protein increase, and rash erythematous (GCT3013-01-EXP-aNHL

In the Safety Pool 01+04 LBCL group (N=208), 119 (57.2%) subjects experienced at least 1 CRS 
event (Table 59), and the maximum grade event was grade 1 or 2 in 111 of the 119 subjects. Most 
subjects had a maximum grade 1 event (72 subjects; 34.6%), with 39 (18.8%) subjects having a 
maximum grade 2 event and 8 (3.8%) subjects having a maximum grade 3 event. No grade 4 or 
grade 5 events of CRS occurred. Fever was reported in 118 of the 119 subjects, hypotension in 38 of 
the 119 subjects, and hypoxia in 24 of the 119 subjects. 
The highest rate of CRS was reported in association with the first full dose of 48 mg epcoritamab on 
C1D15 (49.0%; 96 subjects), followed by the intermediate dose on C1D8 (15.8%; 32 subjects) and 
the priming dose on C1D1 (9.6%; 20 subjects). Fifteen (7.9%) subjects had a CRS event after the 
second full dose (C1D22). Almost all CRS events occurred during the first cycle, as only 9 (5.0%) 
subjects had a CRS event at some point after the third full dose (C2D1). 
A total of 109 (52.4%) subjects with LBCL received a concomitant medication for the treatment of 
CRS, including tocilizumab in 37 (17.8%) subjects and corticosteroids (beyond those scheduled for 
CRS prophylaxis) in 33 (15.9%) subjects.  
Fifteen (7.2%) subjects had CRS that led to dose delay and in 1 (0.5%) subject, with prior recurrent 
CRS, grade 1 CRS and concomitant grade 3 fatigue in the setting of disease progression led to 
treatment discontinuation.  
The median time to first CRS onset was 16.0 days (range: 1, 55), generally following administration of 
the first full dose of 48 mg epcoritamab on C1D15 (Table 59). In the 96 subjects who experienced CRS 
after the first full dose, the median time to onset from the last epcoritamab injection was 20.0 hours 
(range: 12, 126). Median time to onset was 19.1 hours (range: 12, 133) from the priming dose, 
67.7 hours (range: 12, 213) from the intermediate dose, 20.0 hours (range: 12, 126) from the first full 
dose, 86.0 hours (range: 19, 133) from the second full dose, and 33.4 hours (range 12, 118) from any 
subsequent full doses. 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), 230 (61.5%) subjects experienced at least 1 CRS 
event (Table 59), and maximum grade event was grade 1 or 2 in 214 of the 230 subjects. Most 
subjects had a maximum grade 1 event (135 subjects; 36.1%), with 79 (21.1%) subjects having a

maximum grade 2 event, 15 (4.0%) subjects having a maximum grade 3 event, and 1 (0.3%) subject 
having a maximum grade 4 event. No grade 5 events of CRS occurred. Fever was reported in 229 of 
the 230 subjects, hypotension in 76 of the 230 subjects, and hypoxia in 43 of the 230 subjects. 
Consistent with the pooled LBCL subjects, the highest rate of CRS was reported in association with the 
first full dose of 48 mg epcoritamab on C1D15 (54.8%; 193 subjects), followed by the intermediate 
dose (15.5%; 56 subjects) and the priming dose (12.3%; 46 subjects). Almost all CRS events occurred 
during the first cycle, as only 17 (5.3%) subjects had a CRS event at some point after the third full 
dose. 
A total of 211 (56.4%) subjects with LBCL received a concomitant medication for the treatment of 
CRS, including tocilizumab in 80 (21.4%) subjects and corticosteroids (beyond those scheduled for 
CRS prophylaxis) in 61 (16.3%) subjects. 
The most common concomitant treatments received (other than for prophylaxis) were paracetamol 
(169 subjects), tocilizumab (80 subjects), sodium chloride (53 subjects), oxygen (43 subjects), 
piperacillin sodium + tazobactam sodium (30 subjects), dexamethasone (24 subjects), solutions 
affecting the electrolyte balance (22 subjects), and prednisolone (16 subjects). 
Twenty-nine (7.8%) subjects had CRS that led to dose delay and in 2 (0.5%) subjects CRS led to 
treatment discontinuation. One of the subjects had CRS (grade 1) with concomitant grade 3 fatigue in 
the setting of disease progression that led to treatment discontinuation as described above. The other 
subject was in the GCT3013-01 MCL expansion cohort and had CRS that was grade 4 in the context of 
progressive disease. The CRS was ongoing at the time of treatment withdrawal. 
The median time to first CRS onset was 16.0 days (range: 1, 59), generally following administration of 
the first full dose of 48 mg epcoritamab on C1D15 (Table 59). Median time to onset was 17.2 hours 
(range: 12, 165) from the priming dose, 38.8 hours (range: 12, 213) from the intermediate dose, 18.7 
hours (range: 12, 130) from the first full dose, 82.8 hours (range: 12, 133) from the second full dose, 
and 13.1 hours (range 12, 135) from any subsequent full doses. The median time to CRS resolution 
was 3.0 days (range: 1 to 36 days).

Event level analysis 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), a total of 123 CRS events were reported in 84 subjects 
(Table 60). Among these 84 subjects, 56 (66.7%) subjects had 1 CRS episode, 20 (23.8%) subjects 
had 2 CRS episodes, 6 (7.1%) subjects had 3 CRS episodes, 1 (1.2%) subject had 4 CRS episodes, 
and 1 (1.2%) subject had 5 CRS episodes. Most of the 123 CRS events were maximum grade 1 (84 
events; 68.3%), with 35 (28.5%) maximum grade 2 events and 4 (3.3%) maximum grade 3 events. 
Fever was reported as a symptom of CRS in 121 (98.4%) of the total 123 events, hypotension in 30 
(24.4%) events, and hypoxia in 21 (17.1%) events.  
Most CRS events occurred during the first cycle of treatment, with the highest number of CRS events 
reported in association with the first full dose of 48 mg epcoritamab on C1D15 (74 events in 
68 subjects), followed by the intermediate dose on C1D8 (21 events in 21 subjects) and the priming 
dose on C1D1 (12 events in 11 subjects). Eight CRS events occurred in 7 subjects after the second full 
dose (C1D22). Almost all CRS events occurred during the first cycle, as only 8 events occurred in 4 
subjects after the third full dose on C2D1 and thereafter.  
Tocilizumab was administered to treat 31 (25.2%) of the 123 CRS events and corticosteroids (beyond 
those scheduled for prophylaxis) for 20 (16.3%) of the events (Table 60). Fourteen (11.4%) CRS 
events led to dose delay and 1 (0.8%) grade 1 CRS event with concomitant grade 3 fatigue in the 
setting of disease progression led to treatment discontinuation. 
The median time to CRS onset from most recent dosing was 2.0 days (range: 1, 11) (Table 60). The 
median time to onset was 19.1 hours (range: 12, 108) after priming, 70.7 hours (range: 12, 213) after 
intermediate dose, 20.6 hours (range: 12, 161) after the first full dose, 81.0 hours (range: 19, 171) 
after the second full dose, and 58.4 hours (range: 12, 239) following any subsequent full doses. 
Median times to CRS resolution were 26.7, 48.0, 48.0, 72.0, and 28.3 hours, respectively.  
At data cutoff, 121 (98.4%) of the 123 CRS events achieved resolution with median time to resolution 
of 2.0 days (range: 1, 27). Of the 2 unresolved cases, 1 was the grade 1 CRS concurrent with grade 3 
fatigue that led to treatment discontinuation mentioned above. The second unresolved CRS case was in 
a subject who had 2 episodes of CRS. The first episode of Grade 3 CRS occurred at C1D15, resolved on 
Day 19 and epcoritamab was delayed. The second CRS event (Grade 2) in this patient occurred at

C1D22 (administered at D36) with concurrent disease progression. No further CRS treatment was 
given and the patient died due to disease progression at D46. 
Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 LBCL group (N=208), a total of 192 CRS events were reported in 
119 subjects (Table 60). Among these 119 subjects, 74 (62.2%) subjects had 1 CRS episode, 
25 (21.0%) subjects had 2 CRS episodes, 15 (12.6%) subjects had 3 CRS episodes, 2 (1.7%) subjects 
had 4 CRS episodes, and 3 (2.5%) subjects had 5 CRS episodes. Most of the 192 CRS events were 
maximum grade 1 (131 events; 68.2%), with 53 (27.6%) maximum grade 2 events and 8 (4.2%) 
maximum grade 3 events. Fever was reported as a symptom of CRS in 187 (97.4%) of the total 192 
events, hypotension in 45 (23.4%) of the events, and hypoxia in 33 (17.2%) of the events. 
Most CRS events occurred during the first cycle of treatment, with the highest number of CRS events 
reported in association with the first full dose of 48 mg epcoritamab on C1D15 (105 events in 
96 subjects), followed by the intermediate dose on C1D8 (33 events in 32 subjects) and the priming 
dose on C1D1 (22 events in 20 subjects). Sixteen events occurred in 15 subjects after the second full 
dose. Almost all CRS events occurred during the first cycle, as 16 events occurred in 9 subjects 
following the third full dose on C2D1 and thereafter. 
Tocilizumab was administered to treat 46 (24.0%) of the 192 events and corticosteroids (beyond those 
scheduled for prophylaxis) for 41 (21.4%) of the events (Table 60). Eighteen (9.4%) CRS events led to 
dose delay and 1 (0.5%) grade 1 CRS event with concomitant grade 3 fatigue in the setting of disease 
progression led to treatment discontinuation. 
The median time to CRS onset from most recent dosing was 2.0 days (range: 1, 11) (Table 60). The 
median time to onset was 21.3 hours (range: 12, 147) after priming, 70.7 hours (range: 12, 213) after 
intermediate dose, 21.0 hours (range: 12, 161) after the first full dose, 94.0 hours (range: 19, 171) 
after the second full dose, and 34.2 hours (range: 12, 239) following any subsequent full doses. 
Median times to CRS resolution were 37.0, 48.0, 48.0, 43.7, and 32.6 hours, respectively. 
As of the data cutoff date, 190 (99.0%) of the 192 CRS events achieved resolution. The 2 unresolved 
cases were ongoing at the time of each of the subject’s death, as described above. 
In the aNHL cohort of the GCT3013-01 study expansion part, the majority of CRS events (69/112 
events, 61.6%) occurred outside of the mandatory 24-hours hospitalization period. 43 CRS events 
(38.4%) occurred within the 24 hours mandatory hospitalization period (after the first full dose). There 
were four Grade 3 CRS events and all began within 24 hours of the 1st full dose. In 3 of the 4 cases, 
CRS started with a lower grade and developed to a Grade 3 event, which was already being managed 
accordingly. Half of the subjects (79/157, 50.3%) did not experience any CRS event. 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), a total of 377 CRS events were reported in 
230 subjects (Table 60). Among these 230 subjects, 140 (60.9%) subjects had 1 CRS episode, 
50 (21.7%) subjects had 2 CRS episodes, 28 (12.2%) subjects had 3 CRS episodes, 8 (3.5%) subjects 
had 4 CRS episodes, 3 (1.3%) subjects had 5 CRS episodes, and 1 (0.4%) subject had 6 CRS 
episodes. Most of the 377 CRS events were maximum grade 1 (252 events; 66.8%), with 109 (28.9%) 
maximum grade 2 events, 15 (4.0%) maximum grade 3 events, and 1 (0.3%) maximum grade 4 
event. Fever was reported as a symptom of CRS in 371 (98.4%) of the total 377 events, hypotension 
in 91 (24.1%) of the events, and hypoxia in 58 (15.4%) of the events. 
Most CRS events occurred during the first cycle of treatment, with the highest number of CRS events 
reported in association with the first full dose of 48 mg epcoritamab on C1D15 (214 events in 
193 subjects) followed by the intermediate dose on C1D8 (58 events in 56 subjects) and the and the 
priming dose on C1D1 (48 events in 46 subjects). Twenty-nine events occurred in 26 subjects after the 
Assessment report

second full dose (C1D22). Twenty-eight CRS events occurred in 17 subjects after the third full dose on 
C2D1 and thereafter. 
Tocilizumab was administered in 99 (26.3%) of the 377 events and corticosteroids (beyond those 
scheduled for prophylaxis) in 76 (20.2%) of the events (Table 60). Thirty-four (9.0%) CRS events led 
to dose delay and 2 (0.5%) events led to treatment discontinuation. One of the events leading to 
discontinuation was a grade 1 event in an LBCL subject from GCT3013-01, who had concurrent grade 3 
fatigue and disease progression (as described above). The other CRS event that led to treatment 
discontinuation was a grade 4 CRS event in an MCL subject who died from disease progression. 
The median time to CRS onset from most recent dosing was 2.0 days (range: 1, 12) (Table 60). The 
median time to onset was 17.8 hours (range: 12, 165) after the priming dose, 41.8 hours (range: 12, 
213) after the intermediate dose, 19.9 hours (range: 12, 161) after the first full dose, 83.1 hours 
(range: 12, 253) after the second full dose, and 35.1 hours (range: 12, 251) following any subsequent 
full doses. Median times to CRS resolution were 26.7, 31.4, 48.0, 47.1, and 29.0 hours, respectively. 
At data cutoff, 372 (98.7%) of the 377 CRS events achieved resolution (Table 60). Two of 
the unresolved CRS events occurred after the first full dose and 3 occurred after the second full dose. 
In addition to the 2 LBCL subjects with unresolved CRS events described above, there was a subject 
with FL with no entry in the CRF for outcome of the CRS event but a defined end date in the AE listing, 
who discontinued treatment due to declining health; an MCL subject with grade 4 CRS concurrent with 
multiple organ failure that led to discontinuation of study treatment followed by death due to disease 
progression; and an MCL subject whose CRS onset date was the day before the data cut-off.

Evaluation of tocilizumab use in CRS management 
Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL Group: In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N = 374), a total of 
377 CRS events of any grade were reported, and 99 (26.3%) of these events were managed by 
tocilizumab treatment. 
Among the 377 CRS events, most were grade 1 (252, 66.8%) or grade 2 (109, 28.9%), with 15 
(4.0%) events grade 3, and 1 (0.3%) grade 4, per the ASTCT criteria. Among the 99 CRS events 
where tocilizumab was administered, 19 (19.2%) were grade 1, 64 (64.6%) were grade 2, 15 (15.2%) 
were grade 3, and 1 (1.0%) was grade 4. 
Among all treatment-emergent CRS events, most (92.5%) of the grade 1 events were not treated with 
tocilizumab, while the majority of grade 2 (58.7%) and all (100%) grade 3 and 4 events were treated 
with tocilizumab. This is generally consistent with the protocol recommendation that tocilizumab be 
used to treat grade 3 or 4 CRS as well as grade 1 and 2 CRS in an older subject or subject with 
extensive comorbidities. 
An evaluation of the effectiveness of tocilizumab in treating CRS was performed by defining response 
to tocilizumab as meeting all the following criteria: 
•  CRS resolution within 4 days following tocilizumab administration, AND 
•  No new corticosteroids use initiated, AND 
• 
The prophylactic corticosteroid dose as per protocol not escalated. 
Based on the above definition for response to tocilizumab, among the 99 CRS events with tocilizumab 
administration, the majority (79, 79.8%) responded to tocilizumab. The tocilizumab response rate was 
89.5%, 84.4%, and 53.3% for CRS of grade 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Of note there was only 1 grade 
4 CRS event unresponsive to tocilizumab.

There were 20 (20.2%) CRS events with tocilizumab administration that did not meet the response 
criteria above and were defined as tocilizumab “failures”. The reason(s) for tocilizumab “failure” 
include(s): 
•  13 CRS events did not resolve within 4 days following tocilizumab administration, 
•  2 CRS events had a “new” corticosteroid initiated, 
•  8 CRS events in which the prophylactic corticosteroid dose was escalated. 
Of note, 3 of the CRS events “failed” for more than one reason. 
Of the 20 CRS events that “failed” to respond to tocilizumab, half (n = 10: 3 in aNHL subjects, 3 in 
iNHL subjects, and 4 in MCL subjects) were followed by new corticosteroid initiation (n = 2) or 
escalation of prophylactic corticosteroid dose (n = 8). Three of the 10 CRS events did not resolve 
within 4 days following tocilizumab administration, thus meeting 2 criteria for “failure.” Therefore, 7 
CRS events that did not respond to tocilizumab were considered to have “failed” solely due to 
additional steroid use. Of these 7 CRS events, 2 events were experienced concurrently with ICANS 
events as an indication for additional corticosteroid treatment, and 1 event was experienced in a 
subject whose corticosteroid dose was escalated due to concomitant mild renal impairment, according 
to the investigator. 
Among all 377 CRS events, 372 (98.7%) were resolved by the data cutoff. For all resolved CRS events, 
the median time to resolution was 3 days for CRS events with tocilizumab administration, and 2 days 
for CRS events without tocilizumab administration. This difference may reflect that tocilizumab 
administration was more frequent in managing higher grade CRS events, which may have a longer 
time to resolution according to the applicant. 
Safety Pool 01 LBCL Group: In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N = 167), a total of 123 CRS events of 
any grade were reported, and 31 (25.2%) of these events were managed by tocilizumab treatment.  
Among the 123 CRS events, most were grade 1 (84, 68.3%) or grade 2 (35, 28.5%), with 4 (3.3%) 
events grade 3, and none grade 4, per the ASTCT criteria. Among the 31 CRS events where 
tocilizumab was administered, 5 (16.1%) were grade 1, 22 (71.0%) were grade 2, and 4 (12.9%) 
were grade 3. 
Among all treatment-emergent CRS events, most (94.0%) of the grade 1 events were not treated with 
tocilizumab, while the majority of grade 2 (62.9%) and all (100%) grade 3 events were treated with 
tocilizumab. 
Based on the definition for response to tocilizumab, among the 31 CRS events with tocilizumab 
administration, the majority (27, 87.1%) responded to tocilizumab. The tocilizumab response rate was 
80.0%, 90.9%, and 75.0% for CRS of grade 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  
There were 4 (12.9%) CRS events with tocilizumab administration that did not meet the response 
criteria and were defined as tocilizumab “failures”. For all 4 CRS events, the event did not resolve 
within 4 days following tocilizumab administration. Also, for 2 of the CRS events, the planned 
prophylactic corticosteroid was administered following the CRS event, but the corticosteroid dose was 
increased as compared to the protocol-specified prophylactic dose (thus meeting 2 criteria for 
“failure”). 
Among all 123 CRS events, 121 (98.4%) were resolved by the data cutoff date. For all resolved CRS 
events, the median time to resolution was 2 days for CRS events with tocilizumab administration, and 
2 days for CRS events without tocilizumab administration. 
In addition to tocilizumab and corticosteroids, other concomitant medications were used to treat CRS, 
such as antipyretics, antibiotics, and intravenous fluids. The most common other therapies 
Assessment report

(administered to ≥5% of patients) for CRS were paracetamol, sodium chloride (saline), oxygen, 
piperacillin sodium;tazobactam sodium, and solutions affecting the electrolyte balance. These 
medications were mostly administered during the Week ≤8 period. 
Preliminary data from the step-up dosing optimization part GCT3013-01 
Preliminary supportive data from the step-up dosing (SUD) optimization part of the ongoing GCT3013-
01 trial (Protocol Amendment 9/Version 11.0 [07 July 2022]) is provided. In the SUD Optimization 
Cohort, following administration of the 1st full dose on Cycle 1 Day 15, investigators were given the 
option to either: 
• 
Proactively hospitalize the subject (e.g., if perceived to have increased risk of severe CRS), OR 
•  Require  the  subject  to  remain  in  close  proximity  to  the  treatment  facility  (defined  as  within  30 
minutes) for 24 hours after the first full dose of epcoritamab (ie,“"outpatient”" monitoring). 
To minimize CRS during treatment with epcoritamab in Cycle 1, strong recommendations were also 
implemented in the study for proper hydration and use of dexamethasone (15 mg), instead of 
prednisolone or other corticosteroid equivalent, as the prophylactic corticosteroid administered. 
As of the data snapshot date of 08 Mar 2023, 19 subjects with R/R DLBCL across Arms A, B and C 
received at least 1 dose of epcoritamab (Table 61). Of the 18 subjects who had received the first full 
dose of epcoritamab, 11 subjects (61.1%) received the first full dose without proactive hospitalization 
and none of these subjects had CRS following the first full dose (Table 61). Of the 7 subjects with 
DLBCL who were proactively hospitalized at the time of the first full dose, 2 subjects (28.6%) 
experienced Grade 1 CRS. It should be noted that 1 of the 7 subjects was hospitalized for peripheral 
edema prior to the first full dose and subsequently received the first full dose of epcoritamab in the 
hospital.

CRS incidence, severity, hospitalization, treatment, and outcome during Cycle 1 are summarized in 
Table 62. The applicant evaluated CRS throughout Cycle 1, which included any CRS events that 
occurred following priming, intermediate, or full doses of epcoritamab.

Most subjects did not experience CRS following the first full dose of epcoritamab. Of the 5 subjects 
with DLBCL who had CRS, CRS occurred after the priming dose in 3 subjects, after the intermediate 
dose in 1 subject, and after the first full dose in 2 subjects (in one subject, the CRS occurred more 
than 24 hours post-dose). The main symptom experienced by subjects with grade 1 CRS was fever (5 
subjects; 100%). Importantly CRS resolved in all 5 subjects, with a median time to resolution of 4 
days (range: 1, 6). No subjects discontinued epcoritamab treatment due to CRS. One subject had a 
dose delay due to CRS. 
As per protocol recommendations, nearly all subjects in the optimization part received additional 
hydration (oral and intravenous) and primarily used dexamethasone as CRS prophylaxis, and data 
suggest that these mitigation strategies contribute to a lower incidence and severity of CRS. 
Additionally, the CRS data from the 11 subjects in Arm A who received the same step-up dosing 
regimen as the expansion part of the GCT3013-01 trial (i.e. 0.16 mg priming/ 0.8 mg intermediate/ 48 
mg full dose) are consistent with that of all 19 DLBCL subjects from the SUD optimization part of the 
GCT3013-01 trial.

Immune effector-cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) 
In the Dose Escalation Part of the GCT3013-01 trial, neurological assessment was conducted according 
to the CARTOX-10 scale (Neelapu et al., 2017). In the Expansion Parts of the GCT3013-01 and 
GCT3013-04 trials, ICANS events were graded according to ASTCT criteria (Lee et al, 2019). 
Symptoms of ICANS may include aphasia, altered level of consciousness, impairment of cognitive 
skills, motor weakness, seizures, and cerebral edema (Lee et al, 2019). Overall, the ICANS grade was 
determined by the most severe event of the neurotoxicity domains (ICE score, level of consciousness, 
seizure, motor findings, raised intracranial pressure/cerebral edema) not attributable to any other 
cause. 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), 10 (6.0%) subjects experienced ICANS (Table 63). In 7 
subjects, the ICANS overlapped with CRS events. Median time to first ICANS onset was 16.5 days 
(range: 8, 141). All of the events were considered treatment-related, and most were grade 1 (4.2%; 7 
subjects) or grade 2 (1.2%; 2 subjects) events. There were no grade 3 or 4 ICANS events.  
One (0.6%) subject had a fatal ICANS event (grade 5). The fatal episode of ICANS, in a 70-
80-year-old female subject with DLBCL, was an on-treatment event with onset on D12, 5 days after 
the subject’s most recent dose of study drug (0.8 mg intermediate dose), was considered to be related 
to study drug, and led to treatment discontinuation. Further details on the fatal event of ICANS can be 
found in the discussion regarding fatal TEAEs. 
Except for the grade 5 case, all other episodes of ICANS resolved (90.0%; 9/10 subjects) with 
supportive care, dose delay in 3 (1.8%) subjects, and/or dexamethasone or other treatments. Median 
time to resolution was 5.0 days (range: 1, 9). One in 167 treated subjects (0.6%), the fatal event 
discussed above, discontinued treatment due to ICANS (Table 63). 
Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
The profile of ICANS events (Table 63) were similar to that reported above for Safety Pool 01.

Clinical tumor lysis syndrome (CTLS) 
Grading for CTLS severity was according to the Cairo-Bishop defined criteria (Coiffier et al., 2008). A 
diagnosis of TLS required that 2 or more of the following metabolic abnormalities occurred within 3 
days before or up to 7 days after the initiation of therapy: hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, 
hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. CTLS was present when laboratory TLS was accompanied by 
an increased creatinine level, seizures, cardiac dysrhythmia, or death. 
A total of 5 subjects in Safety Pool 01+04 experienced CTLS. Three subjects with LBCL experienced 
CTLS: 2 from GCT3013-01 aNHL (LBCL) Expansion Part (both DLBCL) and 1 from GCT3013-04 
Escalation Part (HGBCL). In all subjects the events were grade 3 or 4. Two subjects from the iNHL/MCL 
Expansion Part also were assessed with CTLS and in both subjects the events were grade 1 or 2.  
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), 3 (1.8%) subjects experienced the TEAE of TLS and in all 3 
subjects the TEAEs were considered treatment-related. In 2 (1.2%) subjects, the events met the 
criteria for CTLS and in both subjects the CTLS was grade 3 or higher. Both events of CTLS occurred in 
setting of disease progression and were unresolved at time of subject death.

Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), 7 (1.9%) subjects experienced the TEAE of tumor 
lysis syndrome and in 6 (1.6%) subjects the TEAEs were considered treatment-related. In 5 (1.3%) 
subjects, the events met the criteria for CTLS and in 3 (0.8%) subjects the CTLS was grade 3 or higher. 
AESIs in the updated safety analyses (DCO 30 June 2022): 
In the primary safety pool 01 (LBCL), no major changes were seen in the AESIs of CRS, ICANS or CTLS 
between the initial safety analysis and the update. This is in line with the observations in the initial 
safety analysis that these AESIs mainly tend to occur during the first cycles of epcoritamab treatment. 
In the supportive safety pool 01 + 04 (All B-NHL), two new grade 4-5 CRS events and two new grade 
4-5 ICANS events were reported following the first full dose of epcoritamab. However, these high-
grade events occurred in subjects with very aggressive forms of MCL i.e., patients outside of the 
intended target population of the current application.  
Other safety topics identified by the applicant 
Neurological events 
Treatment-emergent neurological events were analysed using 2 approaches. Neurological events were 
analysed by the definition provided in Topp et al, 2015. In addition, neurological events were also 
assessed using a broad definition that included all TEAEs classified as SOC of nervous system disorders 
or psychiatric disorders, excluding high-level group terms of sleep disorders and disturbances, and 
peripheral neuropathies. ICANS is included as one of the PTs in both searches and is discussed 
separately as an AESI. 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167) using the Topp et al, 2015 definition, 43 (25.7%) subjects 
experienced at least 1 neurological event, and 17 (10.2%) subjects had neurological events considered 
related to epcoritamab by the investigator (Table 64). PTs reported in ≥2% subjects included ICANS 
(6.0%; 10 subjects), dizziness (5.4%; 9 subjects), paresthesia (3.6%; 6 subjects), and tremor (3.6%; 
6 subjects). All neurological events using the Topp definition were grade 1 or 2 in severity except for 
the following, reported for 1 subject each: ICANS (grade 5), loss of consciousness (grade 5), facial 
paralysis (grade 3), and delirium (grade 3). Of note, except for the ICANS event, all grade 3 or higher 
events were considered unrelated to epcoritamab by the investigator. Most of the neurological events 
using the Topp et al, 2015 definition occurred in the first 2 cycles of treatment (Week ≤8). 
Using the broad definition for neurological events, 59 (35.3%) subjects had neurological events and 24 
(14.4%) subjects had neurological events considered related to epcoritamab by the investigator (Table 
65). PTs reported in ≥2% subjects included headache (12.6%; 21 subjects), ICANS (6.0%; 
10 subjects), dizziness (5.4%; 9 subjects), paresthesia (3.6%; 6 subjects), tremor (3.6%; 6 subjects), 
and anxiety (2.4%; 4 subjects). Most of the neurological events using the broad definition occurred in 
the first 2 cycles of treatment (Week ≤8). 
Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374) using the Topp et al, 2015 definition, 102 (27.3%) 
subjects experienced at least 1 neurological event, and 48 (12.8%) subjects had neurological events 
considered related to epcoritamab by the investigator (Table 64). PTs reported in ≥2% subjects 
included dizziness (6.4%; 24 subjects), ICANS (6.1%; 23 subjects), paresthesia (3.2%; 12 subjects), 
and tremor (2.4%; 9 subjects). All neurological events using the Topp definition were grade 1 or 2 in 
severity except for grade 3 syncope in 2 subjects and the following reported for 1 subject each: ICANS 
(grade 5), consciousness (grade 5), facial paralysis (grade 3), loss of depressed level of consciousness

(grade 3), dizziness (grade 3), Bell’s palsy (grade 3), and delirium (grade 3). Of note, except for 
ICANS, all grade 3 or higher events were considered unrelated to epcoritamab by the investigator. 
Most of the neurological events using the (Topp et al, 2015) definition occurred in the first 2 cycles of 
treatment (Week ≤8). 
Using the broad definition for neurological events, 141 (37.7%) subjects had neurological events and 
62 (16.6%) subjects had neurological events considered related to epcoritamab by the investigator 
(Table 65). PTs reported in ≥2% subjects included headache (12.6%; 47 subjects), dizziness (6.4%; 
24 subjects), ICANS (6.1%; 23 subjects), paresthesia (3.2%; 12 subjects), and tremor (2.4%; 
9 subjects). Most of the neurological events using the broad definition occurred in the first 2 cycles of 
treatment (Week ≤8).

thrombocytopenia narrow search), and anemia (PTs of anemia, red blood cell count decreased, 
hemoglobin decreased, serum ferritin decreased, and hematocrit decreased). 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), a total of 47 (28.1%) subjects had ≥1 neutropenia event 
(grouped term), and 36 of the 47 subjects had ≥1 grade 3 or 4 neutropenia event (Table 66).  
• 
Treatment with G-CSF was administered in 25 (15.0%) subjects. The neutropenia events resolved 
in all but 3 of these 25 subjects in the GCT3013-01 aNHL pivotal expansion cohort as of the data 
cutoff. These 3 subjects were continuing on treatment in C11 or later and managing ongoing 
neutropenia with filgrastim. 
•  Seven (4.2%) subjects in the GCT3013-01 aNHL pivotal expansion cohort experienced epcoritamab 
dose delays due to events of neutropenia. Five of the subjects received concomitant treatment for 
the event while 2 of the subjects had only the dose delays. The neutropenia events resolved in all 
7 subjects.  
Febrile neutropenia was experienced by 4 (2.4%) subjects: the maximum severity was grade 3 in 3 
(1.8%) subjects and grade 4 in 1 (0.6%) subject (Table 66). The febrile neutropenia resolved in all 4 
subjects following treatment with G-CSF. 
The incidence of neutropenia events (grouped term + febrile neutropenia) was >10% through the 
Week 12 to ≤36 period (15.6%, 12.5%, 18.3%, and 7.5% of subjects during the Week ≤8, Week 
8 to ≤12,Week 12 to ≤36, and Week 36+ time periods, respectively), while the incidences for 
thrombocytopenia events (grouped term) (13.8%, 0%, 2.9%, and 0%, respectively) and anemia 
events (grouped term) (18.0%, 0.8%, 4.8%, and 0%, respectively) decreased after the Week ≤8 
period with no events reported after Week 36 as of the data cutoff for anemia and thrombocytopenia. 
Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), a total of 106 (28.3%) subjects had 
≥1 neutropenia event, and 88 of the 106 subjects had ≥1 grade 3 or 4 neutropenia event (Table 66). 
Treatment with G-CSF was administered to 69 (18.4%) subjects. No subjects in Safety Pools 01 and 
01+04 discontinued treatment due to a TEAE of any cytopenia.

Regarding decreased numbers of platelets, the applicant reported the number of events of major 
bleeding related to the occurrence of ≥Grade 3 thrombocytopaenia. There were 7 (1.9%) patients with 
major bleeding events, assessed using the EMA/CHMP definition, among those patients who had on-
treatment Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50 x109/L). The events were retroperitoneal 
haemorrhage, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and hypovolemic shock, small intestinal 
haemorrhage, lip haemorrhage, diarrhoea haemorrhagic, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and mouth 
haemorrhage. All patients had a relevant medical history such as thrombocytopenia, anemia, chronic 
kidney disease, and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. None of the major bleeding events were fatal and 
none were considered related to epcoritamab. Of the 7 patients, 2 had a dose delay related to the 
major bleeding event. All 7 of the major bleeding events outcomes were reported as resolved. 
Infections 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), 77 (46.1%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE in the 
Infections and infestations SOC; the TEAEs were considered related to epcoritamab by the investigator 
in 14 (8.4%) subjects, and were grade 3 or 4 in severity for 24 (14.4%) subjects (Table 67). Serious 
TEAEs that coded to the Infections and infestations SOC were reported in 27 (16.2%) subjects and 
fatal TEAEs in 4 (2.4%) subjects; none of the fatal TEAEs were considered related to epcoritamab by 
the investigator. TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation were reported for 5 (3.0%) subjects and 
TEAEs that led to dose delay were reported in 22 (13.2%) subjects. Details within each category are 
provided below. 
The incidence of Infection was 26.9% of 167 subjects during the Week ≤8 period, 6.7% of 
120 subjects during the Week 8 to ≤12 period, 28.8% of 104 subjects during the Week 12 to ≤36 
period, and 28.3% of 53 subjects during the Week 36+ period. The incidences of Infections were 
similar during the Week ≤8 period, Week 12 to ≤36 period, and Week 36+ period; the latter periods 
were longer in duration, but epcoritamab dosing was less frequent.

• 
Infections reported for ≥2% of subjects included UTI and pneumonia in 9 (5.4%) subjects each; 
COVID-19 in 8 (4.8%) subjects; oral candidiasis and upper respiratory tract infection in 6 (3.6%) 
subjects each; and sepsis and cellulitis in 4 (2.4% each) subjects.  
o 
Infections considered treatment-related by the investigator reported for ≥1% of subjects 
included oral candidiasis in 3 (1.8%) subjects; and upper respiratory tract infection and oral 
herpes in 2 (1.2%) subjects.  
•  Grade 3 or 4 infections reported for 2 or more subjects included COVID-19 and sepsis in 4 (2.4%) 
subjects each; pneumonia and cellulitis in 3 (1.8%) subjects each; and COVID-19 pneumonia, 
septic shock, and upper respiratory tract infection in 2 (1.2%) subjects each.  
o  Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 infections as assessed by the investigator included sepsis and 
upper respiratory tract infection in 1 (0.6%) subject each. 
a.  Serious TEAEs of Infection reported for 2 or more subjects included pneumonia and sepsis in 
4 (2.4%) subjects; COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, and cellulitis in 3 (1.8%) subjects each; 
and bacteremia, septic shock, and upper respiratory tract infection in 2 (1.2%) subjects each.  
a.  Serious TEAEs of Infection considered epcoritamab-related by the investigator included 
sepsis, upper respiratory tract infection, and oral herpes in 1 (0.6%) subject each. 
b.  Fatal TEAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC included COVID-19 in 2 (1.2%) subjects, 
COVID-19 pneumonia in 1 (0.6%) subject, and PML in 1 (0.6%) subject with onset of PML 
reported as D13, presumed to be related to prior treatment with rituximab. None of these fatal 
TEAEs was considered related to epcoritamab by the investigator. More specifically on the case 
of PML, this concerned a 50-60-year-old male with stage III DLBCL who received the priming 
dose of epcoritamab 0.16 mg on C1D1 and the intermediate dose of epcoritamab 0.8 mg on 
C1D8, which was the last epcoritamab dose administered. On Day 13, the patient experienced 
Grade 2 PML. On Day 15, a magnetic resonance imaging scan showed progressive multifocal 
white matter abnormality suggest of PML. On Day 16, lumbar puncture showed presence of 
John Cunningham (JC) virus (level was not quantifiable). The event of PML worsened to Grade 
5 on Day 137. Lymphocytes were consistently low prior to the start of treatment with 
epcoritamab on Day 1 through the end of treatment visit on Day 23. Rituximab was part of 
every treatment regimen prior to enrolment in the study, including the most recent in 
combination with lenalidomide, which was stopped 64 days prior to starting epcoritamab. 
Additionally, the subject received HSCT on Days -721 to -641 as well as bendamustine on Days 
-278 to -193.

discontinuation), Table 3.12 (fatal), Table 3.13 (serious TEAEs)  
As the occurrence of the SOC Infections and infestations was not restricted to the first 8 weeks of 
treatment, the applicant was requested to provide an updated analysis of serious infections. As shown 
in Table 68, the incidence of infections increased from the DCO date of 31 Jan 2022 to 30 June 2022.  
Table 55: Infections: Overview of TEAEs in the System Organ Class Infections and 
Infestatons (48 mg Safety Analysis Set – Escalation + Expansion 
The most common PTs (>1% of subjects) in the primary safety pool 01 were COVID-19, COVID-19 
pneumonia, pneumonia, sepsis, cellulitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bacteraemia, progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy and septic shock. COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia and pneumonia 
accounted for most new infections reported from the initial DCO date to the updated analysis. A 
majority of the fatal TEAEs of infection were also associated with COVID-19 (6/7 fatal cases).  
In the primary safety pool 01, the incidence of Infection was  
•  28.1% during the Week ≤8 period,  
•  6.7% during the >Week 8 to ≤12 period,  
•  20.2% during the >Week 12 to ≤24 period,  
•  20.3% during the >Week 24 to ≤36 period, and  
•  55.7% during the >Week 36+ period.  
An increased number and rate of Infections were observed in the >Week 36+ period in this safety 
update compared to the same period in the original SCS (i.e., 34/61 subjects [55.7%] versus 15/53 
subjects [28.3%], respectively). Most of the increase in the >Week 36+ period was due to COVID-19,

which occurred in 4/53 subjects (7.5%) in the original analysis versus 18/61 subjects (29.5%) in this 
update.  
The updated data on infections in the supportive safety pool were similar to that observed for the 
primary safety pool. 
Injection-related reactions 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), 50 (29.9%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE of 
injection site reaction (Table 69). In all subjects, the maximum event grade was either grade 1 
(28.1%; 47 subjects) or grade 2 (1.8%; 3 subjects). No grade 3 or higher events were observed. 
Median time to first injection site reaction was 22.5 days (range: 1, 255) and median time to 
resolution was 11.5 days (range: 1, 252). PTs for injection site reactions reported in ≥1% of subjects 
included injection site reaction (22.2%); injection site erythema (8.4%); injection site pain and 
injection site pruritus (2.4% each); and injection site hypertrophy, injection site inflammation, and 
injection site rash (1.2% each). The incidence of injection site reactions was highest during the Week 
≤8 period (26.9%) and was 19.2% during the Week 8 to ≤12 period, 15.4% during the Week 
12 to ≤36 period, and 5.7% during the Week 36+ period.  
Eleven (6.6%) subjects required treatment for at least 1 injection site reaction. Treatment generally 
consisted of topical steroids and/or oral antihistamines. None of the events resulted in dose 
modifications. The injection site reactions were reported as resolved in all but 1 subject who had grade 
1 events on C1D16 (right side) and C1D23 (left side), was started on oral loratadine 10 mg, and who 
continued epcoritamab treatment and was in C11 of treatment as of the data cutoff date.  
Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), 150 (40.1%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE 
of injection site reaction (Table 69). In all subjects, the maximum grade event was either grade 1 
(34.0%; 127 subjects) or grade 2 (6.1%; 23 subjects). No grade 3 or higher events were observed. 
Median time to first injection site reaction was 16.0 days (range: 1, 255) and median time to 
resolution was 15.0 days (range: 1, 345). Forty-eight (12.8%) subjects required treatment. PTs for 
injection site reactions reported in ≥1% of subjects included injection site reaction (31.0%), injection 
site erythema (9.1%), injection site rash (2.7%), injection site pruritus (1.9%), injection site pain 
(1.6%), and injection site inflammation (1.1%). The incidence of injection site reactions was highest 
during the Week ≤8 period (36.9%) and was 22.9% during the Week 8 to ≤12 period, 20.9% during 
the Week 12 to ≤36 period, and 13.0% during the Week 36+ period.

Upon request, the applicant provided additional data on events of tumour flare and COVID-19. 
Tumour flare 
In the epcoritamab safety pools, a total of 7 aEs with the PT tumour flare were observed, leading to an 
overall rate of 1.9% (7/374). Six of the events were reported in the GCT3013-01 study and one in the 
GCT3013-04 study. No reports had a fatal outcome; 6 events of tumour flare were non serious and 1 
was serious due to concurrent CRS and small intestinal haemorrhage requiring hospitalization. The 
median time to onset of tumour flare from study drug initiation was 16 days (range 5-34 days) and the 
median duration of tumour flare was 22.5 days (range 1-54 days). The maximum severity of all 
7 events of tumour flare was Grade 2, there were no reports of concomitant intubation and/or airway 
obstruction, and all events were resolving or resolved. 
COVID-19 
A total of 40 patients experienced 54 events (40 serious, 14 nonserious) of COVID-19. Of the 54 
events, 44 were Grade >3. Of the 54 events, 40 were serious and 4 were considered related to 
epcoritamab. Of the 54 events of COVID-19, event outcomes were resolved/resolving (n=32), not 
resolved (n=10), and fatal (n=12).

There were 13 patients who experienced at least 1 event of Grade >3 COVID-19 after epcoritamab was 
reintroduced, i.e. after a dose delay. In these 13 patients, 5 had no additional events of COVID-19 and 
8 had subsequent events of COVID-19. There was a total of 9 subsequent events following 
epcoritamab reintroduction (one patient experienced a total of 3 COVID-19 events) of which 5 were 
serious and 4 were nonserious. Of the 9 recurrent COVID-19 events, 7 resolved and 2 did not resolve 
at the time of data cut-off. None of the subsequent COVID-19 events had a fatal outcome and 1 was 
considered related to epcoritamab. Subsequent COVID-19 events occurred from 14 to 93 days after 
resolution of the prior episode of COVID-19.

Fatal treatment-emergent adverse events 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), fatal TEAEs were reported for 12 (7.2%) subjects. COVID-
19 and general physical health deterioration were reported for 2 (1.2%) subjects; all other fatal TEAEs 
were reported in 1 subject each. Nine of the deaths occurred during expansion and 3 of the deaths 
occurred during escalation.

All 9 of the fatal TEAEs were on-treatment events with onset during the first 2 cycles of treatment, 
except for the event of loss of consciousness, which occurred beyond the first 2 cycles (D119).  
One fatal TEAE was considered related to epcoritamab by the investigator; this was an episode of 
ICANS in a 70-80-year-old female subject with DLBCL. Relevant medical history included 
hyperlipidemia (grade 1), type 2 diabetes mellitus (grade 2), hypertension (grade 1), and paresthesia 
(grade 1). Relevant medication history included pregabalin, insulin human injection, 
metformin/saxagliptin, pancreatin/simethicone/ ursodeoxycholic acid, sulfamethoxazole, and 
trimethoprim. A diagnosis of grade 3 pancreatitis was made on D10. ICANS was an on-treatment event 
with onset on Day 12, 5 days after the subject’s second (and last) dose of epcoritamab (0.8 mg 
intermediate dose), and treatment with dexamethasone was initiated. An EEG showed non-convulsive 
status epilepticus, and antiepileptics were added. Brain MRI revealed multifocal cerebrovascular 
ischemia (grade 1, unrelated to epcoritamab). On D17, ICANS worsened to grade 4, and the subject 
developed hypertension, along with fever, diagnosed as grade 1 CRS, and tocilizumab was 
administered. Methylprednisolone and phenobarbital were also administered. On D18, the subject 
became comatose and was transferred to the ICU, where another dose of tocilizumab was 
administered. CRS was reported to resolve 4 days later and repeat CT scan showed possible 
improvement in pancreatitis but a new splenic infarction in the setting of platelet count decreased 
(grade 3). The subject’s mental status continued to deteriorate, and she died on D25. Per Lugano, the 
subject had PD evaluated by the IRC (Days 6 to 24). 
In addition, four of the fatal TEAEs were attributed to PD, two to COVID-19, and two to 
comorbidities/impact or prior therapies (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopahy attributed to prior 
treatment with rituximab, myocardial infarction attributed to prior history cardiovascular diseases). 
Brief narratives are provided in the clinical AR.

Fatal Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events During Escalation 
Three subjects treated at the 48 mg dosing regimen during the Escalation Part of trial GCT3013-01 had 
fatal TEAEs. Two were attributed to disease progression and 1 was due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Brief 
narratives are provided in the clinical AR.

Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), fatal TEAEs were reported for 19 (5.1%) subjects. 
No fatal TEAEs were reported in the GCT3013-04 trial. COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, and general 
physical health deterioration, reported for 2 (0.5%) subjects, were the only fatal TEAEs reported for 
more than 1 subject. Twelve of the fatal TEAEs occurred in LBCL subjects and are discussed above; 7 
additional fatal TEAEs occurred in the All B-NHL group, and none were considered related to 
epcoritamab treatment by the investigator (6 subjects from the GCT3013-01 iNHL expansion cohort 
and 1 subject from the GCT3013-01 MCL expansion cohort). The 7 fatal TEAEs were attributed to 
disease progression in one subject, COVID-19 in one subject, existing comorbidities/impact of prior 
therapies in three subjects (necrotizing fasciitis, lung opacity, pneumonia), or other reasons not 
captured by those terms in two subjects (septic shock, aspiration pneumonia). Brief narratives are 
provided in the clinical AR. 
Deaths 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), a total of 68 (40.7%) subjects died during the trial: 37/167 
(22.2%) subjects died within the treatment-emergent period (60 days from last dose or 28 days from 
last dose for GCT3013-01 Dose Escalation Part [uncensored for start of subsequent anti-lymphoma 
treatment]) and 31/167 (18.6%) subjects died during the follow-up period. Overall, most deaths were 
caused by disease progression (32.3%; 54 subjects). Seven (4.2%) subjects died due to adverse 
events: 5 deaths were on treatment (COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19, hepatoxicity, ICANS, 
myocardial infarction) and 2 deaths were during follow up (PML, COVID-19) (Table 72).  
Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), a total of 102 (27.3%) subjects died during the 
trials: 56/374 (15.0%) subjects died within the treatment-emergent period (60 days from last dose 
[uncensored for start of subsequent anti-lymphoma treatment]) and 46/374 (12.3%) subjects died 
during the follow-up period. Overall, most deaths were caused by disease progression (20.9%; 78 
subjects). Fifteen (4.0%) subjects died due to adverse events: 13 deaths were on treatment (COVID-
19 pneumonia in 2 subjects; and COVID-19, hepatoxicity, ICANS, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, 
lymphoma transformation, necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis, septic shock, lung opacity, and pneumonia 
aspiration in 1 subject each) and 2 deaths occurred during the follow-up period (PML, COVID-19). Out 
of the 8 patients with an “other” cause of death, 5 were related to an adverse event (4 infection, 1 
transplant complication) and 3 were related to disease progression. 
The percentage of subjects who died was lower in the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (27.3%) 
compared to the LBCL groups from Safety Pools 01 and 01+04 (40.7% and 39.9%, respectively) 
(Table 72) due to the lower proportion of iNHL subjects who died during the study (12.4%; 
13/105 subjects) as a result of less time on study overall (enrollment ongoing as of data cutoff) and 
less aggressive disease than LBCL.

 Haematology and coagulation 
Treatment-emergent grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormalities (i.e., grade worsened from baseline) 
for select hematology parameters (hemoglobin, ANC, lymphocytes, and platelets) are in Table 73. The 
most common hematologic abnormality across all analysis groups was lymphopenia followed by 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Cytopenias were managed through dose delay and/or 
treatment with G-CSF for neutropenia. 
Abnormal elevations in lymphocyte counts to grade 3 were infrequently observed (<1% of subjects 
across groups).

Data cutoff date:31 Jan 2022 
Drug-induced liver abnormalities 
Drug-induced liver injury (Hy’s Law criteria) was defined as: 1) AST/ALT >3×ULN; 2) total bilirubin 
>2×ULN; 3) absence of initial findings of cholestasis (i.e., absence of elevation of ALP to >2× ULN); 
and 4) no other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased ALT and total bilirubin, 
such as viral hepatitis, etc. All potential events of elevations in ALT, AST, and total bilirubin occurring 
within a concurrent 30-day period are summarized for Safety Pools 01 and 01+04 in Table 75. A total 
of 9 (2.4%) of 374 subjects in Safety Pool 01+04 had LFT elevations that met the first 2 laboratory 
criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury: not all elevations occurred on the same day. These 9 
subjects included 5 subjects with LBCL (including 4 DLBCL subjects), 3 subjects with iNHL (2 with FL, 
1 with MZL), and 1 subject with MCL. LFT elevations in the 9 subjects were in the context of CRS 
(5 subjects), disease progression (3 subjects), or cholangitis (1 subject). The cases are briefly 
described below. 
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), 5 (3.0%) subjects had AST/ALT >3×ULN and total bilirubin 
>2×ULN within 30 days of epcoritamab administration. Out of the 5 subjects, 4 (2.4%) subjects had 
LFT elevations within 1 day of epcoritamab administration. In 3 subjects, the LFT elevations occurred 
in the context of progressive disease and in all 3 ALP was also elevated >2x ULN, with reported causes 
of death being either disease progression (n=2) or hepatotoxicity due to disease progression (n=1). In 
the other 2 subjects, the LFT elevations were transient and resolved along with concurrent TEAEs of 
CRS (n=1 with increased ALPS but <2xULN) or liver injury (n=1, cholangitis including ALP elevations 
>2xULN). The hepatotoxicity and liver injury were not considered related to epcoritamab by the 
investigator. Both subjects continued treatment and were ongoing as of the data cutoff date.  
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), 9 (2.4%) subjects had AST/ALT >3×ULN and total 
bilirubin >2×ULN concurrent within a 30-day period, including 7 (1.9%) subjects with concurrent 
elevations on the same day. The 9 subjects with potential DILIs were from the GCT3013-01 trial: 
5 subjects from the pivotal aNHL pivotal expansion cohort (described above), 3 subjects from the iNHL 
expansion cohort, and 1 subject from the MCL expansion cohort. All 3 iNHL subjects had transaminase 
elevations concurrent with events of CRS that resolved, and the subjects continued with epcoritamab 
treatment (2 were ongoing as of the data cutoff). In 2 of the 3 patients ALP was also elevated >2x 
ULN, in the other patient ALP remained in the normal range. The MCL subject had LFT elevations 
concurrent with progressive disease, CRS, ICANS, and CTLS. ALP was elevated >2x ULN. This subject 
ultimately died, and disease progression was reported as the primary cause of death.

Vital signs 
Table 76 summarizes clinically notable vital sign abnormalities for the primary and supportive safety 
analysis pools following the criteria specified in the study SAPs. Incidences were generally similar 
between pools, except for low systolic blood pressure and elevated temperature, which were more 
common in the supportive safety pool. The differences for those vital sign abnormalities reflect the 
corresponding higher rates in the DLBCL EXP cohort of GCT3013-04. In both safety pools, the most 
frequent abnormality was elevated temperature (>38°C).

Overall, few subjects (16 in the Safety Pool GCT3013-01+GCT3013-04 ESC+EXP All B-NHL group, of 
which 9 were in the Safety Pool GCT3013-01 ESC+EXP LBCL group) experienced vital sign AEs that led 
to epcoritamab dose modification (i.e., dose delay; Table 77). No major differences were observed 
between the Safety Pool  GCT3013-01 ESC+EXP LBCL group and the Safety Pool GCT3013-
01+GCT3013-04 ESC+EXP All B-NHL group.

Using the same MedDRA search criteria, no isolated vital sign AEs led to discontinuation of epcoritamab 
treatment in either safety pool. 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment 
A total of 369 treated subjects in the supportive safety analysis pool (GCT3013-01+GCT3013-04 
ESC+EXP All B-NHL) had at least one on-treatment ECG. Of these 369 subjects, 252 (68.3%) had at 
least one ECG with an abnormal interpretation. The worst observed abnormal ECG was clinically 
significant for 14 subjects, not clinically significant for 200 subjects, and unclassified for 38 subjects. 
A summary of electrocardiogram QT interval using Fridericia's correction for the primary and 
supportive safety analysis pools is provided in Table 78. Per protocol, all subjects were required to 
have a screening and baseline ECG. However, some sites only reported QTcB, but not the QTcF result. 
Those ECG readings with only QTcB were not converted to QTcF, leading to some subjects without 
QTcF results. A total of 236 treated subjects in the supportive safety analysis pool (GCT3013-
01+GCT3013-04 ESC+EXP All B-NHL) had at least one on-treatment QTcF result. Of these 236 
subjects, 39 (16.5%) experienced on-treatment QTcF >450 – 480 ms, 9 (3.8%) experienced on-
treatment QTcF >480 – 500 ms, and 7 (3.0%) experienced on-treatment QTcF >500 ms. One of the 
patients with QTcF >500 ms on-treatment also had QTcF >500 ms at baseline.

A total of 40 (10.7%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE in the Cardiac disorders SOC, of which 7 
(1.9%) were considered related. The most common PTs (>1% of subjects) were tachycardia (n=10, 
2.7%), sinus tachycardia (n=7, 1.9%), atrial fibrillation (n=7, 1.9%), and cardiac failure (n=4, 1.1%). 
The PTs for the 7 related TEAEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC included tachycardia (n=2, 0.5%), sinus 
tachycardia (n=2, 0.5%), sinus bradycardia (n=1, 0.3%), cardiovascular disorder (n=1, 0.3%), and 
myocarditis (n=1, 0.3%). A total of 8 (2.1%) subjects experienced serious and Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in 
the Cardiac disorders SOC, none of which were considered related to epcoritamab. None of the TEAEs 
in the Cardiac disorders SOC led to epcoritamab discontinuation.

There were no clinically meaningful differences in the frequency and severity of events across TEAE 
categories and the AESIs of CRS and ICANS between age groups. CTLS occurred only in subjects 
younger than 75 years of age, of which 4 out of 5 in the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL population were 
< 65 years. However, the number of CTLS observations is too limited to draw any conclusions in terms 
of a potential association with age.

Sex 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), the proportion of females is lower than males. The 
incidence of CRS of any grade in females and males was 65.0% and 59.3%, respectively, and for 
serious TEAEs of CRS was 34.3% and 35.5%. These differences between females and males are 
smaller than that observed in the LBCL group with an incidence of CRS of 67.5% in females and 50.4% 
om males. In the LBCL group serious TEAEs of CRS were reported in 34.9% vs 24.8%. Cases of CRS in 
Safety Pool 01 All B-NHL subjects were grade of 3 or 4 severity for 4.2% and 4.3% of subjects, 
respectively. In the LBCL subgroup these numbers were 6.0% and 2.4%, respectively. CTLS only 
occurred in male subjects (5 [2.2%] subjects). 
Race 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), 55.3% of subjects were White, 29.7% were Asian, 
3.2% were Other. In general, the frequency and severity of events were similar between race 
subgroups across TEAE categories and the AESIs of CTLS and ICANS. White subjects had a higher 
incidence of serious TEAEs compared to Asian subjects (65.7% vs 44.1%, respectively). Higher 
frequencies in any grade CRS were noted in the Asian subgroup (79.3%) compared to the White or 
Other subgroups (57.0% and 42.9%, respectively); however, the differences were less for grade 3 or 4 
CRS between the Asian subgroup (7.2%) and White or Other subgroups (3.9% and 0%, respectively). 
The incidences for serious TEAEs of CRS were lower in the Asian (26.1%) subgroup than in the White 
or Other subgroups (39.1% and 37.5%, respectively). One (0.3%) subject in the All B-NHL group with 
MCL had grade 4 CRS. 
As shown in Table 81, the incidence of CRS (any grade) was higher in the Asian population across all 
safety pools presented, but it was the most pronounced in the LBCL cohort of Safety Pool 01+04 
(Asian 76.1% vs White 51.6% and Other 32.3%). The latter was driven by the smaller GCT3013-04 
trial which included only Asian patients, where an incidence of any grade CRS of >80% (88.9% in the 
Escalation part and 83.3% in the Expansion part) was observed in subjects receiving 48 mg 
epcoritamab. The race differences were less clear for grade 3 and higher CRS, although this must be 
interpreted with caution due to few observations (a total of 8 subjects in each of the White and Asian 
subgroups of the All B-NHL population).

Exposure-safety analyses suggest that there is no apparent relationship between PK and CRS. 
Therefore, the exposure-safety modelling data may indicate that the higher incidence of CRS in the 
Asian subgroup is not due to higher exposures to epcoritamab in Asian subjects, but rather due to 
other unidentified confounding factors. This is also supported by the subgroup analysis based on 
baseline body weight, indicating that body weight does not appear to affect the safety of epcoritamab 
treatment (see next section). 
Baseline weight 
There were no apparent weight-related trends in the frequency and severity of events across TEAE 
categories and the AESIs of CRS, CTLS, and ICANS in the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374). 
No weight-related trends were observed in the All B-NHL group for CRS, but a trend of lower 
incidences of CRS (all grades) was observed with increasing weight in LBCL subjects in Safety Pool 
01+04 (N=208) (63.5% vs 57.7% vs 44.4%, respectively). The same trend was not observed for LBCL 
subjects in Safety Pool 01. According to the applicant, this is also confounded by the overall higher 
incidence of CRS in the GCT3013-04 and the trend towards lower subject weight. The median weight in 
the GCT3013-04 aNHL expansion cohort was 53.1 kg (range: 39.1, 87.2) compared to 70.2 kg (range: 
39, 144) in Safety Pool 01. In addition, it is observed that the incidence of CRS in the <65 kg group in 
Safety Pool 01+04 LBCL (63.5%) was higher than that of the same weight group in Safety Pool 01 
(50.0%). Hence, it is concluded that bodyweight does not appear to affect the safety of epcoritamab 
treatment based on the data currently available. 
Baseline renal function 
Renal function subgroups were based on creatinine clearance at baseline and included the following 
categories: normal (≥90 mL/min), mildly impaired (60 to <90 mL/min), moderately impaired (30 to 
< 60 mL/min), and severely impaired (15 to < 30 mL/min). In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group 
(N=374), the frequency and severity of events were in general similar across TEAE and AESI 
categories, except for differences in incidence of ≥5% between the normal and mildly impaired renal 
function subgroups, respectively: 
Fatal TEAEs: 2.2% vs 8.1% 
• 
•  CRS (all grades): 54.8% vs 65.2% 
Similar trends were not observed for serious cases of CRS (34.1% vs 36.6% respectively) or grade 3 
or 4 CRS (4.4% and 5.0%, respectively). Epcoritamab has not been studied in subjects with severe 
renal impairment. No treated subjects from GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04 were classified with severe 
renal impairment at baseline. 
Baseline hepatic function 
Hepatic function subgroups were based on NCI criteria at baseline and included the following 
categories: normal, mild dysfunction, moderate dysfunction, severe dysfunction, and unknown. In the 
Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), at baseline, the majority of subjects (82.6%) had normal 
hepatic function and 15.5% of subjects had mild hepatic dysfunction. Some trends were observed of 
higher incidences across TEAE categories and the AESIs of CRS and ICANS in the mild dysfunction 
group compared to the normal group, respectively, with differences ≥5% between subgroups noted 
below: 
TEAEs leading to dose delay: 46.6% vs 39.5%  
•  Serious TEAEs: 67.2% vs 57.3% 
• 
•  CRS (all grades): 70.7% vs 60.8% 
•  Grade 3 or 4 CRS: 8.6% vs 3.6% 
• 
ICANS (all grades): 12.1% vs 5.2%  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 175/209 
 
 
 
Results may be confounded by the potential for increased disease severity in subjects with impaired 
hepatic function according to the applicant. When comparing patients with mild baseline hepatic 
impairment at baseline and normal baseline hepatic function, patients with mild hepatic impairment 
more often had Stage IV disease and baseline liver involvement. Disease type at study entry, median 
years from initial diagnosis to first dose of epcoritamab, and incidence of subjects with ≥4 prior lines of 
anti-lymphoma therapy were similar between the subgroups of mild hepatic impairment and normal 
hepatic function at baseline. Epcoritamab has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment. No treated subjects from GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04 were classified with severe 
hepatic dysfunction at baseline. Only 1 subject had moderately impaired hepatic function, and 
therefore, the impact of moderate hepatic impairment on safety is also unknown. 
Ann Arbor staging 
Subgroups were based on Ann Arbor staging at baseline and included the following categories: I/II and 
III/IV. In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), approximately 4 times the number of 
subjects were Ann Arbor stage III/IV at baseline (307 subjects; 82.1%) compared to stage I/II at 
baseline (67 subjects; 17.9%). Some trends were observed of higher incidences across TEAE 
categories and the AESIs of CRS and ICANS in the Ann Arbor stage III/IV group compared to the stage 
I/II group, respectively, with differences ≥5% between subgroups noted below: 
TEAEs leading to dose delay: 42.3% vs 31.3% 
•  Grade 3 and higher TEAEs: 67.8% vs 59.7% 
•  Serious TEAEs: 61.6% vs 43.3% 
• 
•  CRS (all grades): 62.9% vs 55.2% 
•  Grade 3 or 4 CRS: 5.2% vs 0% 
• 
ICANS (all grades): 7.5% vs 0% 
Results are confounded by the potential for increased disease severity in subjects who were Ann Arbor 
stage III/IV at baseline according to the applicant. 
CD20-negative disease 
A total of 8 subjects in the GCT3013-01 Expansion Part aNHL cohort had tumour biopsies reported as 
CD20-negative based on local laboratory assessments. These patients were considered CD20-positive 
for study inclusion based on documented evidence of CD20-positivity based on representative 
pathology. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 176/209 
 
 
 
All 8 (100%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE, including 6 (75.0%) subjects who experienced 
TEAEs considered related to epcoritamab by the investigator. A total of 5 (62.5%) subjects 
experienced at least 1 Grade 3 or higher TEAE, and 3 (37.5%) subjects had Grade 3 or higher TEAEs 
considered related to epcoritamab by the investigator. Serious TEAEs were reported in 6 (75.0%) 
subjects and were considered related to epcoritamab in 5 (62.5%) subjects. Fatal TEAEs were reported 
in 1 (12.5%) subject, which was assessed as not related to epcoritamab by the investigator. TEAEs 
that led to treatment discontinuation and to dose delay were reported in 2 (25.0%) subjects each. 
AESIs of CRS were reported for 6 (75.0%) subjects; there were no events of ICANS or CTLS in these 
subjects. TEAEs reported in 2 or more of these 8 subjects included CRS in 6 subjects (75.0%), 
injection site reaction in 3 subjects (37.5%), and 2 subjects (25.0%) each for anemia, 
hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, pleural effusion, thrombocytopenia, thrombophlebitis, and vomiting. 
Extrinsic factors 
Geographic region 
The largest proportion of subjects in Safety Pools 01 and 01+04 were from Europe. The GCT3013-04 
trial enrolled only Asian subjects. In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), 14.2% of 
subjects were from North America, 48.1% from Europe, 28.3% from Asia, and 9.4% from other 
regions. The frequency and severity of events were generally similar between regions across all TEAE 
and AESI categories with the following exceptions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The use of dose delays for TEAE management was highest in Europe (50.0%) followed by other 
regions (37.1%), Asia (34.9%), and North America (20.8%). 
The incidence of serious TEAEs was >10% less in Asia (42.5%) than in Europe (67.2%), North 
America (56.6%), and other regions (62.9%).  
The incidence of CRS (all grades) was >10% higher in Asia (78.3%) than in Europe (56.7%), North 
America (47.2%), and other regions (57.1%). 
The incidence of grade 3 or higher TEAEs was >10% higher in Europe (66.1%), Asia (68.9%), and 
other (74.3%) than in North America (56.6%). 
Prior lines of anti-lymphoma therapy 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), 222 of 374 subjects (59.4%) received ≤ 3 lines of 
prior anti-lymphoma therapy and 152 (40.6%) subjects received >3 lines. In general, the frequency 
and severity of events were similar between subgroups across TEAE categories and the AESI of ICANS. 
CTLS was only observed in the ≤3 lines of prior anti-lymphoma therapy subgroup (2.3%; 5 subjects). 
Differences in incidence ≥5% between subjects who received ≤3 lines of prior anti-lymphoma therapy 
compared to subjects who received >3 lines of prior anti-lymphoma therapy, respectively, include: 
•  CRS (all grades): 68.0% vs 52.0% 
•  Serious TEAEs: 60.4% vs 55.3% 
As shown in Table 82, the higher incidence of CRS in subjects with ≤3 prior lines of anti-lymphoma 
therapy compared to subjects with >3 lines of anti-lymphoma therapy in the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-
NHL were not as apparent in any of the other safety pools.

Grade 3 
and higher 
Hence, the increased incidence of CRS in the ≤3 prior lines subgroup seems to be largely driven by an 
increased incidence in the non-LBCL (i.e., non-target) population of the All B-NHL pool. Overall, the 
safety profile does not seem to be worse in patients with more prior lines of therapy. 
Prior treatment with CAR-T 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), 83 (22.2%) subjects received prior CAR-T cell 
therapy. In general, the frequency and severity of events were similar between subgroups across TEAE 
categories and the AESIs with the exceptions of differences in CRS and TEAEs leading to dose delay. 
CTLS was only reported in subjects who did not have prior CAR-T cell therapy (1.7%; 5 subjects). 
Differences in incidence ≥5% between subjects who did not have prior CAR-T cell therapy compared to 
subjects who had prior CAR-T cell therapy, respectively, include: 
TEAEs leading to dose delay: 42.3% vs 33.7% 
• 
•  CRS (all grades): 68.0% vs 38.6% 
Smaller differences were observed for grade 3 or 4 CRS (4.5% vs 3.6%, respectively).  
One trend occurred consistently across the different Safety Pools presented, namely that CRS (all 
grades) occurred with a higher incidence among those that had not received prior CAR-T cell therapy 
compared to subjects who had prior CAR-T cell therapy (58.8% vs 36.9% in the Safety Pool 01 (LBCL) 
population). It should be noted that few (n=2) subjects in the supportive GCT3013-04 trial were 
treated with CAR-T cell therapy prior to epcoritamab. Hence, the higher incidence of CRS in the cohort 
without prior CAR-T cell therapy may be confounded by the overall higher incidence of CRS in the 
GCT3013-04 trial. 
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
Subjects included in the analysis were from the immunogenicity analysis set, which included all 
subjects exposed to epcoritamab who had an evaluable baseline ADA sample, and 1 or more evaluable 
on-treatment ADA samples. ADA was measured using different assays in the GCT3013-01 and 
GCT3013-04 trials; therefore, Safety Pool 01+04 data is not provided. In addition, an All B-NHL group 
from Safety Pool 01 was included in this analysis to provide a larger population for the GCT3013-01 
trial. 
ADA evaluable patient is defined as a patient from FAS with an evaluable baseline ADA sample and ≥1 
evaluable on-treatment ADA sample. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 178/209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The term indeterminate may refer to sample-level "indeterminate" value or patient-level 
"indeterminate" value. Sample-level indeterminate values refer to ADA-positive values with no 
confirmation (AVALCOMM = "Positive value with no confirmation yet"). Based on this definition, only 1 
ADA sample was classified as indeterminate. For this sample, the screening ADA assay result was 
positive but confirmatory ADA assay could not be performed due to insufficient sample. A patient is 
classified as indeterminate for the following reason: A patient is classified as indeterminate if the 
patient is confirmed ADA positive at baseline but there is no confirmed positive on-treatment record or 
if confirmed ADA positive on treatment record titer are equal or lower than baseline. 
Sampling for ADAs was performed in the escalation phase of study GCT3013-01 at screening, C1D15, 
C1D22, C2D1, C2D8, C2D15, C2D22, C3-6D1, C3-6D15, C7-PD D1, EOT. In the expansion phase ADA 
sampling took place at C1D1, C1D22, C2-3D1, C2-3D22, C4-9D1, C4-9D15, C10-PD D1, EOT. 
Due to the low number of subjects with ADAs ( 
Table 83), a meaningful analysis of the impact of ADAs on safety is limited; therefore, brief summaries 
of safety information for each LBCL subject who was ADA on treatment positive are provided below. 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=158 [AIS]), 4 (2.5%) subjects were ADA positive at baseline. On 
treatment ADA status was positive for 4 (2.5%) subjects, of which only 1 subject (0.7%) had titer ≥1 
(1:320 taking account of all dilutions). All had an onset of C1D22 or later. Due to the low risk for 
immunogenicity and the low incidence of samples positive for antibodies to epcoritamab, neutralizing 
antibodies were not evaluated at this time. 
Of the 4 LBCL subjects who were ADA positive on treatment and not at baseline, 2 of the subjects 
discontinued treatment within the first 2 cycles due to progressive disease, and the other 2 subjects 
remained on treatment for an additional >10 cycles. Three of the four patients experienced TEAEs that 
were not related to epcoritamab according to the investigator, and the other patient experienced 
neutropenia considered to be related to epcoritamab which resolved with continuing epcoritamab 
treatment. 
In the Safety Pool 01 All B-NHL group (N=258 [IAS]), 9 (3.5%) subjects were ADA positive at 
baseline. On treatment ADA status was positive for 8 (3.1%) subjects ( 
Table 83). Four subjects from the iNHL and MCL expansion cohorts were ADA positive on treatment in 
addition to the 4 LBCL subjects mentioned above. 
Of the ADA evaluable subjects in the GCT3013-01 escalation and aNHL expansion cohorts, baseline 
positive ADA samples had titres of 0.5 (i.e., <1; 1:80 after accounting for dilutions). Similarly, the 
titres for all baseline positive ADA samples in the ADA evaluable subjects from GCT3013-01 iNHL and 
MCL expansion cohorts were 0.5 (i.e., <1), with the exception of two subjects from the GCT3013-01 
MCL expansion cohort, one had a baseline titre value of 2 (actual titer ≤1:320 taking into account 
sample dilutions) and the other subject had a baseline titre value of 3 (actual titer ≤1:640 taking into 
account sample dilutions).  
A considerable higher incidence of ADA positive patients are observed for the lower doses in the dose 
escalation part of study GCT3013-01 (32.4% [11/34] at the eight dose levels ≤6mg), with no definite 
pattern regarding at which doses ADAs were observed. 
GCT3013-04 
Of the 2 subjects who were ADA positive on treatment and not at baseline in the GCT3013-04 trial, 
both subjects remained on treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 179/209 
 
 
 
In GCT3013-04 DLBCL subjects (N=39 [IAS]), 1 (2.6%) subject was ADA positive at baseline. On 
treatment ADA status was positive for 1 (2.6%) subject with titer <1 at the C6D15 visit ( 
Table 83). The subject had a concurrent TEAE of grade 1 injection site reaction that was considered 
related to study treatment by the investigator, and which resolved following topical treatment. The 
subject continued treatment and was ongoing in C13 of treatment at the time of the data cutoff.  
In GCT3013-04 All B-NHL subjects (N=60 [IAS]), 1 (1.7%) subject was ADA positive at baseline. On 
treatment status was positive for 2 (3.3%) subjects ( 
Table 83). One subject was from the DLBCL expansion cohort (described above) and the other subject 
was from the FL expansion cohort with titer <1 at the C1D22 visit that resolved and the subject 
continued epcoritamab treatment. 
In the dose escalation part of GCT3013-04 (all dose levels), all subjects were ADA negative at 
baseline. In expansion Part of GCT3013-04, at the proposed dose regimen, from the DLBCL subjects 
(N=39) that received ≥1 dose of epcoritamab and had ≥1 analyzed immunogenicity sample after 
receiving epcoritamab, only 1 subject was ADA-positive at baseline (titre value <1). Similarly, from the 
FL subjects (N=20) that received ≥1 dose of epcoritamab and had ≥1 analyzed immunogenicity 
sample after receiving epcoritamab in the expansion part of GCT3013-04 at the proposed dose 
regimen, no subject was ADA-positive at baseline.

2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Exploratory safety analysis was performed by evaluating grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in subjects who received 
the 48 mg full dose in Studies GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04 and received a concomitant medication 
with a narrow therapeutic index (NTI) within 2 weeks of at least one episode of CRS event. The NTI 
drugs included: carbamazepine, cyclosporine, digoxin, divalproex sodium, everolimus, levothyroxine, 
liothyronine, phenytoin, sirolimus, theophylline, warfarin, valproate sodium, tacrolimus, valproic acid, 
rapamycin.

Epcoritamab causes transient and modest release of cytokines that may potentially suppress CYP450 
enzymes. The peak median IL-6 concentration was 21.5 pg/mL on C1D16 (following administration of 
the first full dose of 48 mg on C1D15) in subjects with LBCL in the aNHL expansion cohort of the 
GCT3013-01 trial. In addition, exploratory assessment in 4 subjects who received sensitive CYP450 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic index within 2 weeks of a CRS episode showed no apparent 
difference in rates of grade 3 and 4 TEAEs compared to the overall population. Therefore, the risk of 
drug interaction is considered low. 
Given the technical challenges of conducting a dedicated drug
drug interaction trial to coincide with the 
peak of cytokine release and expected variance in degree of cytokine increase for individual subjects, 
no formal drug
drug interaction trial is considered feasible to assess the drug interaction potential due 
‑
to cytokine release after epcoritamab treatment.

2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
 Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 
All TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation are summarized for all groups in Table 85. 
Most of these TEAEs were not considered treatment related by the investigator. 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), 13 (7.8%) subjects discontinued treatment due to at least 
1 TEAE, and 3 (1.8%) discontinued treatment due to at least 1 TEAE considered related to epcoritamab 
by the investigator (Table 85). The only TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation reported for more 
than 1 subject were COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, and MDS in 2 (1.2%) subjects each. Treatment-
related TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation included CRS, ICANS, and CLIPPERS in 1 (0.6%) 
subject each. The ICANS was fatal and is discussed in the section on fatal events. 
Safety Pool 01+04: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP) + GCT3013-04 (ESC + EXP) 
In the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL group (N=374), 24 (6.4%) subjects discontinued treatment due to 
at least 1 TEAE, and 6 (1.6%) discontinued treatment due to at least 1 TEAE considered related to 
epcoritamab by the investigator (Table 85). TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation reported in 
more than 1 subject were COVID-19 pneumonia in 3 (0.8%) subjects and CRS, COVID-19, and MDS in 
2 (0.5%) subjects each. Treatment-related TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation included CRS in 
2 (0.5%) subjects; and ICANS, CLIPPERS, sepsis, enteritis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 
in 1 (0.3%) subject each.

Adverse events leading to dose delay 
Safety Pool 01: GCT3013-01 (ESC + EXP)  
In the Safety Pool 01 LBCL group (N=167), 60 (35.9%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE leading 
to dose delay, and 29 (17.4%) subjects had events that were considered treatment-related by the 
investigator (Table 86). The most frequently reported (≥2%) TEAEs that led to dose delay were CRS 
(7.2%); neutropenia (4.2%); pyrexia (3.0%); and acute kidney injury, pleural effusion, and 
thrombocytopenia (2.4% each).

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
More than 700 patients with haematological malignancies have been exposed to epcoritamab in clinical 
studies as of the data cutoff date of 31 Jan 2022. The clinical development consists of 5 clinical 
studies. Study GCT3013-02 investigates combination therapies and study GCT3013-03 included only a 
small number of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Richter’s syndrome (RS) patients so far. 
Study GCT3013-05 is proposed as confirmatory trial in the context of a CMA and the data is currently 
blinded. Studies GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04 in patients with B-cell lymphoma are the basis for the 
safety analysis and this is agreed. Five additional months of safety data (data cutoff date of 30 June 
2022) from the GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04 studies were provided upon request.  Very few patients 
with ECOG of 2 or higher were included, which results in a study population which has a relatively good 
performance status. 
Safety pools- In studies GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04, 374 patients with B-cell lymphomas were 
treated with the proposed posology of 48 mg full dose after a priming and intermediate dose. The 
primary safety analysis pool (study 01 LBCL) includes the patients in study GCT3013-01 with large 
B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) (n=167, 148 with diffuse LBCL (DLBCL)). The supportive safety analysis 
pool (studies 01+04 All B-NHL) consists of all B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) patients treated 
with 48 mg epcoritamab in studies GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04: 374 patients with 208 LBCL (of 
which 188 DLBCL), 128 indolent NHL (iNHL), and 38 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Other pools 
provided are the DLBCL group of study GCT3013-01; and the LBCL and DLBCL groups of studies 
GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04 combined. The proposed pooling strategy is endorsed. It should be 
noted that the supportive safety analysis pool also includes the full primary safety pool (167/374 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 186/209 
 
 
 
 
 
patients, 44.6%). Hence, the safety results for the “All B-NHL” population are largely influenced by the 
results of the primary safety population.   
The updated safety analysis (DCO 30 June 2022) included no new subjects in the primary safety pool, 
but 57 additional subjects in the supportive safety pool. With the exception of COVID-19-related 
events, the overall safety profile of epcoritamab reported in the safety update was generally consistent 
with the reporting in the original submission. The results presented in this overview are derived from 
the initial analysis (DCO 31 Jan 2022) unless otherwise stated. The frequencies of adverse reactions 
provided in the SmPC section 4.8 reflect the most recent safety analyses (DCO 30 June 2022). 
In the primary safety analysis pool median treatment duration was 3.7 months with 41.3% being 
treated for 6 months and 18.0% for 12 months. At the original data cutoff, 31.7% were still on study 
treatment. In 37.1% of patients a dose delay was required. The most common reason for 
discontinuation was disease progression and in 7.2% discontinuation was due to an TEAE. In the 
supportive safety analysis pool the numbers were overall similar, except that the proportion of 
patients still receiving epcoritamab was higher (46.8%) and discontinuations due to disease 
progression lower, which can be explained by the inclusion of patients with less aggressive disease. 
The median safety follow-up time was 5.6 months (range: <1 to 20 months) in the primary GCT3013-
01 ESC+EXP R/R LBCL analysis set and 4.7 months (range: <1 to 20 months) in the supportive 
GCT3013-01+GCT3013-04 ESC+EXP All B-NHL analysis set. Given the short treatment exposure 
compared to the DoR of ~12 months and that epcoritamab should be administered until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity, it is agreed that long-term safety is included as missing 
information in the safety concerns and final CSRs will be provided post-marketing (see Annex II of the 
PI).  
Regarding the presentation of epcoritamab, it is noted that a presentation of 4 mg epcoritamab per vial 
for administration is needed for preparation of 0.16 mg priming dose or 0.8 mg intermediate dose, but 
only a fraction of 4 mg is needed for preparation of the intended doses. This may lead to medication 
errors or multiple used of the content of the vial. Based on the information provided, two cases were 
identified in whom an overdose of >10% occurred with the priming/intermediate dose. In one case the 
wrong vial was used and in the other case there was a dilution error. The last case is of special 
interest, as the dilution error occurred with the 0.16 mg dosing and the overdose led to headache and 
chills. This case was identified in a different study than the 01 and 04 studies which are the basis of 
the MAA. However, this case is still of relevance as it supports the concern that the 4 mg /0.8ml 
presentation is less suitable for preparation of the 0.16 mg priming dose and 0.8 mg intermediate 
dose, even in the controlled setting of a clinical trial. With the 4 mg /0.8ml presentation only a fraction 
of it is needed for preparation of the injection for the priming and intermediate dose and a two-step 
dilution is needed for preparation of the 0.16 mg dose. This may lead to medication errors, which is 
thus already observed in the well-controlled clinical trial setting, with the post-marketing use by 
default being less controlled. The wording in SmPC section 6.6 instructions aims to mitigate the risk of 
“risk of overdose due to medication errors” has been included as important potential risk in the RMP. 
The SmPC also includes recommendations in section 4.2 about re-priming in case of delayed doses, 
which are in line with the approach used in the GCT3013-01 study and are based on popPK modeling. 
Lower exposures tend to be underestimated by the popPK model, however the model estimated “safe 
re-priming windows” are not fully reflected in the SmPC recommendations, which represent a much 
more conservative and simplified approach. The SmPC recommendations are supported by further 
popPK simulations and a repeated time-to-event (rTTE) modeling approach. The potential impact of 
the current re-priming recommendations on efficacy is however difficult to evaluate based on available 
data. The priming doses are used, to mitigate the risk of CSR. Considering that the currently proposed 
re-priming recommendations are in line with those used in the pivotal clinical study, this issue is not 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 187/209 
 
 
 
further pursued. However, the applicant is encouraged to reassess the re-priming recommendations as 
more clinical data becomes available. 
Adverse events- Almost all patients in the primary safety analysis pool experienced at least 1 
TEAE (99%; related 83.8%). Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurred in 62.9% (related 28.1%). Serious TEAEs were 
observed in 58.1% (related 36.5%). In 7.2% a fatal TEAE was reported, one case of grade 5 ICANS 
was considered to be related to epcoritamab. TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuations occurred in 
7.8% and to dose delay in 35.9%. AEs of special interest (AESI) will be discussed in further detail 
below, but were overall reported in 50.3% (Grade ≥3 in 2.4%), 6.0% (Grade ≥3 in 0.6%), and 1.2% 
(Grade ≥3 in 1.2%), respectively. In the supportive safety analysis pool, the overall safety profile 
was similar, except for a higher incidence of Grade ≥3 related TEAEs and (Grade ≥3) CRS in study 
GCT3013-04. The majority of all TEAEs, Grade ≥3 TEAEs, and serious AEs were reported as 
recovered/resolved. 
The most common TEAEs occurring in ≥10% of patients in the primary safety analysis pool were 
CRS (50.3%); fatigue (24.6%); pyrexia (22.8%); injection site reaction (IRR) and neutropaenia (22.2% 
each); nausea (20.4%), diarrhoea (19.8%); anaemia (18.0%); abdominal pain (13.8%); 
thrombocytopaenia (13.2%); headache (12.6%); constipation and vomiting (12.0% each); decreased 
appetite and oedema peripheral (11.4% each); and back pain and insomnia (10.8% each). For the 
supportive safety analysis pool the most common TEAEs were similar, but CRS and IRR occurred 
more often in the supportive safety analysis pool mainly driven by the high rates reported in the DLBCL 
patients in study GCT3013-04. Most TEAEs occurred in the first 8 week period of study treatment, 
except for the SOC Infections and infestations with similar incidence in the overall treatment period 
and updated data on infections are requested (see later for the discussion on serious infections). 
In the primary safety analysis pool of patients with at least 1 TEAE, 36.6 experienced an TEAE with 
worst Grade 1 or 2, 55.7% worst Grade 3 or 4, and 7.2% worst Grade 5. Cytopaenias were the only 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs reported in ≥5% of patients: Grade 3/4 neutropaenia in 15.6%, anaemia in 10.2%, 
and neutrophil count deceased and thrombocytopaenia in 6.0%. In the supportive safety analysis 
pool, cytopaenias were also the only Grade ≥3 TEAEs reported in ≥5% of patients. 
In the primary safety analysis pool 83.8% reported ≥1 TEAE which was considered to be related 
to the treatment by the investigator (28.1% related Grade ≥3 TEAE). Most common treatment 
related TEAEs were CRS (50.3%), injection site reaction (22.2%), neutropaenia (18.0%), fatigue 
(15.0%), and pyrexia (11.4%). Most common Grade ≥3 treatment-related TEAEs were cytopaenias 
and CRS: neutropaenia (11.4%), neutrophil count deceased (3.6%), anaemia (2.4%), and CRS (2.4%). 
In the supportive safety analysis pool, the proportion of patients with related TEAEs was similar, 
but the proportion of patients Grade ≥3 related TEAE was higher with 38.8% mainly driven by the high 
rates reported in the DLBCL patients in study GCT3013-04. The type of reported treatment-related 
TEAEs was similar, but again CRS and IRS occurred more often. Regarding the differences observed, it 
is acknowledged that the number of patients from the GCT3013-04 study are limited. It is noted that 
the patients included in the GCT3013-04 study differ from the patients in the GCT3013-01 study, for 
example regarding gender, geographic region, and prior CAR-T cell use. In addition, the guidelines 
regarding hospitalization within the study were different. Hospitalization from C1D1 to C1D28 was 
specified in the protocol for the Dose Escalation Part, and for at least 24 hours following the first full 
dose (C1D15) in the Expansion Part of study GCT3013-04, which could be extended at the discretion of 
the investigator. Investigators tended to prolong subject hospitalization during C1 in the Expansion 
Part. As mentioned below, the incidence of CRS was approximately 10-20% higher between subgroups 
in each category for female patients, Asian patients, patients treated in Asia, and in patients without 
prior CAR-T cell therapy. The differences in study population in combination with the limited number of 
patients might (partly) explain the higher incidence of CRS in the GCT3013-04 study. The higher 
incidence of Grade 3 or 4 related AEs in the GCT3013-04 study were mainly driven by cytopaenias. The 
Assessment report

reason for this and the higher incidence of injections site reactions is not fully understood, but might 
be influenced by differences in the study population, hospitalization around epcoritamab administration 
with possibly more close monitoring, and/or management of AEs. 
AESI- Based on the mechanism of action (MoA), cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector 
cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and clinical tumor lysis syndrome (CTLS) were defined 
as AESI. CRS and ICANS are proposed by the applicant as important identified risks. The applicant 
proposes to manage and minimize these risks in the SmPC and additional educational materials. The 
SmPC includes information on premedication (section 4.2), dose modification and management 
guidance (section 4.2), warnings (section 4.4), and description of selected adverse events (section 4.8) 
for both CRS and ICANS, which are overall acceptable but amendments are requested (see SmPC 
assessment and LoQ). Tumour lysis syndrome is also included as a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
CRS- For the subject level analysis (patients with multiple CRS event were counted only once), the 
incidence of CRS was numerically lower in the primary safety analysis pool (50.3%) than in the safety 
analysis pool with all LBCL and All B-NHL patients (57.2% and 61.5%, respectively). In the primary 
safety analysis pool, 2.4% had Grade 3 CRS. In the supportive safety analysis pool, 3.8% of LBCL 
patients and 4.0% of All B-NHL patients had Grade 3 CRS. One (0.3%) patient in the All B-NHL group 
had Grade 4 CRS and there were no Grade 5 CRS events. The difference in CRS incidence between the 
primary and supportive safety analysis pool was driven by the CRS rates reported in GCT3013-04 trial 
(>80%). The incidence of CRS was also higher in other diseases than DLBCL, i.e. iNHL and MCL 
(66.7%). Median time to CRS onset was 16 days (range 1-55) and correlated with the timing of the 
first full dose on C1D15. Almost all CRS event occurred during the first cycle. In study GCT3013-01, 
6.6% had a CRS event at the priming dose, 12.9% at the intermediate dose, 43.6% at the first full 
dose, 4.6% at the second full dose, and 2.8% at the third full dose or after. No major differences in 
time to onset of CRS were observed across the different safety pools. The median time to CRS 
resolution in the primary safety analysis pool was 3.0 days (range: 1 to 27 days) and in the supportive 
safety analysis pool 3.0 days (range: 1 to 36 days).  46.1% received concomitant medication to treat 
CRS including 15.0% receiving tocilizumab and 10.8% receiving corticosteroids beyond prophylaxis. In 
7.2% the dose was delayed and in 0.6% the event led to treatment discontinuation. In the supportive 
safety pool 01+04 All B-NHL, 56.4% received concomitant medication for CRS treatment and the 
proportion leading to treatment delay or discontinuation were comparable. 
For the event level analysis (all CRS events are counted, including multiple episodes experience by 
the same individual patient) 123 events of CRS were reported in 84 patients in the primary safety 
analysis pool 01 LBCL. Among these 84 patients, 66.7% had 1, 23.8% 2, 7.1% 3, and 1.2% either 4 or 
5 CRS episodes. No discernible risk factors for multiple CRS episodes could be identified. The 
supportive safety analysis pool showed similar numbers. The event level analysis did not provide new 
signals regarding grading, timing, and management of CRS. 
ICANS- ICANS was reported in about 6.0% of patients in the primary and supportive safety analysis 
pools. Median time to onset correlated with the 1 to 2 days following the first full dose on C1D15. 
There were no Grade 3 or 4 ICANS events, but there was a Grade 5 ICANS event in the GCT3013-01 
study. None of the other events led to treatment discontinuations and all other events resolved. 
Around 4% received concomitant medication to treat ICANS with dexamethasone, levetiracetam, and 
tocilizumab most commonly used. 
CTLS- A total of 5 patients in the supportive safety analysis pool experienced CTLS, all treatment-
related and in all patients the events were Grade 3 or 4.  
Consistent with the MoA and also reported for medicinal products with the same target, e.g. 
mosunetuzumab, is the possible occurrence of tumour flare due to the influx of immune cells into 
tumour sites. In the epcoritamab safety pools, a total of 7 AEs with the PT tumour flare were observed, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 189/209 
 
 
 
leading to an overall rate of 1.9% (7/374). Overall, the events of epcoritamab were non serious, 
however, this might have been caused by the management guidance per protocol. Tumour flare is 
included in the SmPC as ADR in section 4.8 and  as a warning in section 4.4 describing monitoring and 
management. An update of the analysis of AESIs (data cut-off date 30 June 2022) was similar to that 
seen in initial analysis for the primary safety analysis pool. In the supportive safety analysis pool, two 
new grade 4-5 CRS events and two new grade 4-5 ICANS events were reported following the first full 
dose of epcoritamab. However, according to the applicant, these high-grade events occurred in 
patients with very aggressive forms of MCL i.e., patients outside of the intended target population of 
the current application. Furthermore, these new CRS and ICANS events occurred within the first ≤8 
week treatment period. Hence, the updated analysis confirms that the AESIs of CRS, ICANS and CTLS 
tend to occur during the first cycles of epcoritamab treatment. 
In the pivotal GCT3013-01 study, 24-hours hospitalization was required following the first full dose of 
epcoritamab. However, the applicant has determined that hospitalization is not required in the post-
approval setting to appropriately monitor for and manage the AESIs of CRS and ICANS. According to 
the applicant, most CRS events in the aNHL cohort (69/112 events 61.6%) occurred outside of the 
mandatory 24-hours hospitalization window in the GCT3013-01 study. However, this number is based 
on all CRS events occurring after any dose. Following the first full dose, the majority of events (43/68; 
63.2%) occurred within the first 24 hours. The median time to onset of CRS after the first full dose was 
20.6 hours and all (n=4) grade 3 CRS events occurred within the 24-hours hospitalization period after 
the first full dose.  It is also noted in the updated pooled safety analysis (data cut-off date 30 Jun 
2022) that two Grade 4 CRS events and one grade 5 (fatal) CRS event occurred in non-DLBCL patient 
population. To mitigate the risk of CRS after first full dose, the current SmPC includes a 
recommendation indicating patients should be hospitalised for 24 hours after administration of the 
Cycle 1 Day 15 dose of 48 mg to monitor for signs and symptoms of CRS and/or ICANS. 
Other safety topics identified were Neurological events, cytopenia events, infections, and IRR. 
Neurological events- Neurological events were analyzed with two approaches. The first approach 
used the method from the publication of Topp et al., 2015. The second method used a broad definition 
that included all TEAEs classified as SOC of nervous system disorders or psychiatric disorders, 
excluding sleep disorders and disturbances, and peripheral neuropathies. In the primary safety 
analysis pool, 25.7% experienced a neurological event per the Topp definition (10.2% related). Most 
commonly reported were ICANS, dizziness, paresthesia, and tremor. There were two Grade 3 events 
(facial paralysis, delirium), and two Grade 5 events (ICANS, loss of consciousness), of which the ICANS 
event was reported to be related. When using the broad definition, 35.3% experienced a neurological 
event (14.4% related). The proportions in the supportive safety analysis pools showed a similar 
pattern. 
Cytopenia events- The incidence of neutropenia was around 10%-20% through the treatment period. 
The incidences of thrombocytopaenia and anaemia decreased to below 5% after Week 8. No patients 
discontinued treatment due to cytopenia. In the primary safety analysis pool, 28.1% had neutropenia 
and most events were Grade 3 or 4. In 15.0%, treatment with G-CSF was required. Febrile 
neutropenia occurred in 2.4%; all were Grade 3 or 4 and required treatment with G-CSF. A similar 
profile was observed in the supportive safety analysis pool. 
Infections- In the primary safety analysis pool, 46.1% experienced an TEAE in the SOC Infections 
and infestations (8.4% related). In 14.4% the event was Grade 3 or 4 (1.2% related), and in 2.4% 
fatal (none related). Most commonly reported infections were urinary tract infection, COVID-19, oral 
candidiasis, upper respiratory tract infection, sepsis, and cellulitis. The incidence of infections was 26.9% 
during the Week ≤8 period, 6.7% during the Week 8 to ≤12 period, 28.8% during the Week 12 to ≤36 
Assessment report

Page 190/209 
 
 
 
 
period, and 28.3% during the Week 36+ period. The supportive safety analysis pool did not reveal new 
signals with no major differences in incidences or type of infections. These data show that epcoritamab 
is associated with the occurrence of high grade and fatal events. An update on the occurrence of 
serious infections with data cut-off 30 June 2022 showed an increase compared to 31 January 2022. 
COVID-19 accounted for most of this increase. Although the intended patient population is known to be 
at risk of infections and none of the fatal infections was considered to be related to epcoritamab, a role 
of epcoritamab cannot be completely ruled out. In addition, bispecific antibodies are known to be 
associated with an increased infection risk. It will, therefore, be important to monitor for infections 
during treatment and to intervene early when identified. The applicant includes serious infection as 
important identified risk in the safety concerns, which is agreed.  
IRR- Epcoritamab is administered per subcutaneous injection. In the primary safety analysis pool, 
29.9% of patients reported IRR, all Grade 1 or 2. The incidence of IRR was highest during the Week ≤8 
period, but occurred during all treatment periods. In 6.6%, patients had an IRR requiring treatment, 
generally consisting of topical steroids and/or oral antihistamines. None of the events resulted in dose 
modifications. The incidence of IRR was higher (40.1%) in the supportive safety analysis pool. 
Serious adverse events- In the primary safety analysis pool, 58.1% reported a serious TEAE 
(36.5% related). Most serious TEAEs occurred in the first 8 weeks of treatment. Most common serious 
TEAEs were CRS, pleural effusion, febrile neutropaenia, ICANS, pneumonia, pyrexia, and sepsis. The 
supportive safety analysis pool showed a consistent profile. 
Deaths- In the primary safety analysis pool, a fatal TEAE was reported in 7.2% (n=12) and a 
treatment-related fatal TEAE in 0.6% (n=1). The treatment-related fatal TEAE was caused by ICANS. 
Six of the fatal TEAEs were attributed to PD, three to COVID-19, and two to comorbidities/prior 
therapies, i.e. one case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy to prior treatment with 
rituximab and one case of myocardial infarction with a medical history of multiple cardiovascular 
diseases. In the supportive safety analysis pool, fatal TEAEs were reported 5.1% (n=19). No fatal 
TEAEs were reported in the GCT3013-04 trial. Seven additional fatal TEAEs occurred in the All B-NHL 
group, and none were considered related. One additional fatal TEAE was attributed to PD, one to 
COVID-19, three to comorbidities/prior therapies (necrotizing fasciitis, lung opacity, pneumonia), and 
two to other reasons (septic shock, aspiration pneumonia). Especially for the fatal TEAEs in the SOC 
Infections and infestations a contributory role of epcoritamab cannot be ruled out completely. 
Concurrent cytopaenia was defined within 14 days prior to the infection event onset through the date 
of patients' deaths. Of the 9 patients, 6 experienced concurrent neutropenia or leukopenia (5 patients 
Grade 3-4) and 6 patients had concurrent lymphopenia (5 subjects Grade 3-4). Overall, of the 9 
patients with a fatal infection, 8 had concurrent cytopaenias, in which 7 were Grade 3-4. The low 
number of cases make it difficult to draw conclusions, but a contributory role of epcoritamab cannot be 
ruled out completely. As cytopaenias during epcoritamab treatment might cause an increased risk of 
infection, recommendations for management of febrile neutropaenia in the warning text for serious 
infections are included in the SmPC.  
Deaths occurring for any reason were reported in 40.7% in the primary safety analysis pool, 
mostly due to disease progression (32.3%). Other primary causes for death were adverse events 
(4.2%), other (3.6%), and unknown (0.6%). In the supportive safety analysis pool the number of 
deaths was lower (27.3%), mainly due to a lower proportion of deaths due to disease progression. It is 
agreed with the applicant that this is likely as a result of less time on study (enrollment ongoing) and 
less aggressive disease than LBCL.  
Dose delays and discontinuations- No dose reductions for epcoritamab were allowed. In the 
pivotal safety analysis pool, 35.9% experienced an TEAE leading to dose delay (17.4% related). 
Most common TEAEs leading to dose delay were CRS, neutropaenia, pyrexia, acute kidney injury,

pleural effusion, and thrombocytopaenia. The supportive safety analysis pool showed a similar 
profile. 
In the pivotal safety analysis pool, 7.8% discontinued treatment due to an TEAE (1.8% related). 
TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation reported for more than 1 patient were COVID-19, COVID-
19 pneumonia, and MDS in 2 (1.2%) patients each. Treatment-related TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation included CRS, ICANS, and CLIPPERS (chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine 
perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids) in 1 (0.6%) patient each, with the case of ICANS 
being fatal. Treatment-related TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation in the supportive safety 
analysis pool included CRS in 2 (0.5%) patients; and ICANS, CLIPPERS, sepsis, enteritis, and 
multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in 1 (0.3%) patient each. 
Immunological events- ADA analyses were not pooled for studies GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-04, 
because different assays were used to measure ADAs. In the All B-NHL group in study GCT3013-01, 8 
patients (3.1%) were ADA positive on treatment, including 4 patients from the LBCL cohort and 4 
patients from the iNHL or MCL cohorts. From the patients of the LBCL cohort with positive ADAs on 
treatment, none were positive at baseline, all had an onset of >C1D22 and 1 patient had a titer ≥1. No 
neutralizing antibodies were evaluated. Two patients discontinued the treatment within the first 2 
cycles due to PD and the other two patients remained on treatment for >10 additional cycles. Three of 
the four patients experienced TEAEs that were not related to epcoritamab, and the other patient 
experienced treatment-related neutropaenia which resolved with continuing epcoritamab treatment. In 
study GCT3013-04, two patients were ADA positive on treatment and not at baseline. Both patients 
continued epcoritamab treatment. It is agreed with the applicant that overall, the incidence of ADAs to 
epcoritamab is low and a meaningful analysis of the impact of ADAs on safety is, therefore, limited, but 
no safety signals were observed.  However, remaining uncertainties regarding immunogenicity of 
epcoritamab prevail due to unknown higher immunogenicity at lower dose, and the indeterminate 
category. ADA incidence in the target population DLBCL (3.1%) could potentially be higher than stated 
for the full 48 mg dose. The potential maximum incidence is still relatively low, and (based on the 
definition of the indeterminates), titres for these potential supplemental positive ADA patients are also 
relatively low (<1, 1:80). However, which titres that will provide neutralising effect are not known.  
Laboratory findings- The most common haematologic abnormalities observed in the primary and 
supportive safety analysis pools were lymphopaenia followed by anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, and 
neutropaenia. The hematologic laboratory findings are expected for the MoA and disease to be treated.  
Grade 3 or 4 biochemistry laboratory abnormalities were infrequent in all safety analysis pools. A 
total of 9 (2.4%) of 374 patients treated with epcoritamab in the supportive safety pool had liver 
function tests (LFT) elevations that met the first 2 laboratory criteria for potential drug-induced liver 
injury (DILI) according to Hy’s law. The LFT elevations occurred in the context of CRS (5 patients), 
disease progression (3 patients), or cholangitis (1 patient). None of the cases is defined as DILI per 
the Hy’s law criteria due to findings of cholestasis (ALP elevated >2x ULN) and/or another reason to 
explain increased ALT and total bilirubin. 
Vital signs and ECG findings- The incidences of clinically notable vital sign abnormalities for the 
primary and supportive safety analysis pools were generally similar between pools, except for low 
systolic blood pressure and elevated temperature, which were more common in the supportive safety 
pool. In both safety pools, the most frequent abnormality was elevated temperature (>38°C). Overall, 
few patients (16 in the supportive safety pool, of which 9 were in the primary safety pool) experienced 
vital sign AEs that led to epcoritamab dose modification. No isolated vital sign AEs led to epcoritamab 
discontinuation. In the aNHL expansion cohort of study GCT3013-01, postbaseline QTcF intervals 
>480-500 msec and >500 msec were reported in 4.3% and 3.2% (of which one also reported QTccf 
>500 ms at baseline), respectively. Of the 3 patients with QTcF >500 msec, 1 patient reported a TEAE 
Assessment report

Page 192/209 
 
 
 
of long QT syndrome, which was not considered related to epcoritamab. In 3.2% of patients with LBCL, 
a TEAE in the SOC of cardiac disorders was considered treatment-related, including 1.3% with 
tachycardia, 1.3% with sinus tachycardia, and 0.6% with sinus bradycardia. The supportive safety 
analysis pool, no new signals were observed. As is described in the non-clinical assessment, there were 
three sudden deaths in mice treated epcoritamab. Although the clinical relevance of this is difficult to 
determine, it could be caused by cardiac adverse events. However, the incidence of clinically significant 
ECG abnormality, QTcF >500 ms, and serious and Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC is 
low. Combined with epcoritamab being a monoclonal antibody, no effect of epcoritamab on ΔQTcF in 
PK/PD analyses, and the profile of AEs in the SOC Cardiac disorders, there are no signals that 
epcoritamab has a clinically relevant effect on cardiac repolarization.  
Subgroup results- Safety profiles were not affected by body weight or age. 
The incidence of CRS was approximately 10-20% higher between subgroups in each category for 
female patients, Asian patients, patients treated in Asia, and in patients without prior CAR-T cell 
therapy. A higher incidence of CRS in patients with ≤3 prior lines of anti-lymphoma therapy compared 
to patients with >3 lines of anti-lymphoma therapy in the Safety Pool 01+04 All B-NHL seems to be 
largely driven by an increased incidence in the non-LBCL (i.e., non-target) population of the All B-NHL 
pool. The trends observed between subgroups may be confounded by several background variables 
(demographics, baseline disease characteristics and exposure data). In addition, the trends observed 
must be interpreted with caution due to uneven distribution of subjects in the different subgroups as 
well as a limited number of observations in certain categories (e.g., fatal TEAEs). A review of the 
pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab revealed no clinically meaningful differences between subgroups, and 
the trends observed for the safety profile in different subgroups do not appear to have had any 
clinically relevant impact on exposure to and efficacy of epcoritamab.  
Patients with renal impairment (mild or moderate) or hepatic dysfunction (mild) at baseline, or who 
were Ann Arbor Stage III/IV showed trends towards higher frequencies of serious TEAEs and CRS, 
compared to patients with normal renal/hepatic function or who were Ann Arbor Stage I/II. However, 
the differences observed must be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size for some 
subgroups, and several background demographic and disease variables might have confounded the 
results. Epcoritamab was not studied in patients with severe renal impairment and severe hepatic 
impairment, and there was only 1 patient with moderately impaired hepatic function. 
Only 8 patients in the GCT3013-01 expansion aNHL cohort had a CD20-negative tumour biopsy based 
on local assessment. The patients were considered to be CD20-positive for study inclusion based on 
documented evidence of CD20-positivity based on representative pathology. Due to the very limited number, it is 
difficult to draw any conclusions on the safety profile in CD20-negative patients compared to the overall populations, 
but there seem to be no safety signals in the CD20-negative patients. 
As the sample sizes of the other disease entities than DLBCL NOS were very small, additional safety 
subgroup analyses for the different DLBCL disease entities will not be requested.  
Safety data other ongoing studies with epcoritamab- High-level safety data were provided for 
studies GCT3013-02 and GCT3013-03. In study GCT3013-02 epcoritamab was administered in 
combination with other agents. In general, no new safety signals were identified, although the arm 
with GemOx seemed to be more toxic with 55.6% Grade ≥3 related TEAEs and 6 fatal TEAEs in 27 
patients, of which 2 were related to epcoritamab and to GemOx. In study GCT3013-03 no new safety 
signals were identified based on the very limited data currently available. The incidence of CRS was 
very high (≥90% in both the escalation and the expansion phases), but this must be interpreted with 
caution given the small study population (n=12 CLL subjects in the escalation phase, and n=10 RS 
subjects in the expansion phase) and differences in baseline disease characteristics as compared to the 
Assessment report

intended target population of the current application. It is agreed that no detailed safety information is 
provided for the GCT3013-05 trial, as it is an ongoing randomized study. 
Adverse drug reactions- The applicant proposes to use the pool of the 167 LBCL patients from the 
GCT3013-01 study as basis for SmPC section 4.8. First of all, this pool of LBCL patients is 
representative for the intended DLBCL indication. Secondly, the applicant states that the combined 
safety pool with the GCT3013-04 study is not representative due to differences between the disease, 
patient population, and management between the GCT3013-01 and 04 studies. It is indeed agreed that 
the study GCT3013-04 differs from the -01 study, possibly due to the differences in study population 
and that this study does not have to be included in the SmPC safety information. The initial 
assessment of the ADRs by the applicant was re-evaluated upon request as it cannot be ruled out that 
epcoritamab played a contributory role in the development of certain events, especially given the MoA, 
the safety profile of similar products and the single arm trial design making it difficult to assess 
associations of adverse events and epcoritamab. Upon re-evaluation, events such as specific types of 
infections, tumour flare, fatigue, and biochemical abnormalities were added as ADRs. The applicant 
included oedema, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, and cardiac arrhythmias 
as ADR in the SmPC to resolve discrepancies. In addition, sodium decreased and creatinine increased 
are included in the ADR table in the SmPC.   
GCP inspection- A routine GCP inspection has been performed for the escalation part of the 
GCT3013-01 study (EMA/IN/0000118168). Inconsistencies regarding the safety listings and the 
registration of AEs were identified related to SAEs, neurotoxicity events and two events of DLT were 
identified that are not listed in the CSR. The applicant has described the impact of the GCP findings 
and it is agreed that it seems that there may not be consequences for the B/R discussion. The 
applicant is requested to include the provision of the updated CSR of GCT3013-01-ESC CSR to be 
submitted on or before 22 Dec 2023 as part of an Annex II condition. The GCP inspection reported 
inconsistencies regarding the safety listings and the registration of AEs were identified related to SAEs, 
neurotoxicity events and at least two events of DLT were identified that are not listed in the CSR. 
Several (critical) deficiencies that were found could have had an impact on trial participants’ rights and 
on the validity and integrity of the data. Currently the CSR is being updated and will be provided as a 
PAES (see Annex II). This update will include a summary of signal reports including neurotoxicity and 
in the DLT section, it will be noted that there were 2 events that met the criteria for DLTs but were not 
captured as DLTs because they did not occur in the dose-determining set. In addition, (S)AE listings 
will be adjusted to avoid misinterpretation on potential double entries. 
The inspection has revealed inconsistencies in the safety reporting of the dose-finding study, as not all 
DLTs were reported and neurotoxicity events may have been inadequately captured. An update of the 
CSR was considered necessary by the inspectors, although it was concluded that the findings were 
unlikely to have significantly impacted data integrity. Regarding the GCP non-compliances, these are 
considered to be regrettable, however considered to be sufficiently addressed by the CAPAs. 
Upon CHMP request, the applicant discussed the possible impact of the GCP findings in the escalation 
phase on DLT, neurotoxicity, potential double entries of CRS symptoms, and the CSR of the expansion 
phase. 
•  DLT: The first patient experienced hypersomnia at a higher intermediate dose than the 
intermediate dose as currently requested. The second patient experienced TLS following the 
intermediate dose at the dose selected as intermediate dose for the RP2D (0.8mg). Had this 
event been designated as a DLT, this would have been 1 DLT out of the total 25 subjects who 
had received 0.8 mg as the intermediate dose at that point in the study which was within the 
safety threshold. At this point it is difficult to conclude whether there was no impact of the 2 
additional DLTs on selection of the epcoritamab RP2D or the conclusions in the GCT3013-01-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 194/209 
 
 
 
ESC CSR. However, as there is already an uncertainty identified whether the selected 
0.16 mg/0.8 mg/48 mg proposed posology is the most optimal dose, this issue will not be 
further pursued at this point, but this might change when the updated CSR is assessed. 
•  Neurotoxicity: Because neurological toxicity AEs occurred at low frequencies and represented 
a developing safety signal, they were not discussed in detail in the general safety sections of 
the GCT3013-01-ESC CSR. However, these AEs were part of the source tables and listings and 
were considered in the study conclusions. Therefore, it is agreed with the applicant that there 
seems to be no impact of this finding on the conclusions of the GCT3013-01-ESC CSR.  
•  Potential double entries of CRS symptoms: The applicant has cross-checked the safety 
database and can confirm that no double-reporting of CRS symptoms to any Health Authority 
or EC/IRBs occurred. In the Marvin clinical database, the AESI of CRS was reported on a 
dedicated CRF form, with symptoms individually reported on an AE CRF to better characterize 
and understand the manifestations of the AESI. The GCT3013-01-ESC CSR SAE listing 
displayed the data as it was collected on the CRF pages. Because the symptoms had the “Is 
this AE serious” field ticked “Y, several of the signs and symptoms were included in the listing. 
Thus, it may have appeared that there was double-reporting on the listing, which was not the 
case. 
•  CSR expansion phase: It is agreed that the identified GCP findings are not likely to have an 
impact on the Expansion part of the GCT3013-01 study due to differences in the way that data 
were collected and reported. The design of the CRF was improved for the Expansion part of the 
study to prevent the appearance of double-reporting of AEs/symptoms in the listings and this 
should not be an issue for future CSRs. As clinical development of epcoritamab continued, 
additional data regarding neurological toxicity events and ICANS were captured in the 
Expansion part of the study. DLTs were not evaluated in the Expansion part of the study but 
changes have been made to the protocol template and CRF for collection of DLT data in future 
dose escalation studies.  
With the provided explanations, it is agreed that the updated CSR of the escalation phase will be 
provided post-marketing. According to the applicant the following changes are expected: 
• 
• 
• 
The applicant plans to discuss these additional 2 DLTs in Section 12.1 of the updated 
GCT3013-01-ESC CSR. 
The applicant will include a separate section that more thoroughly discusses any low-frequency 
neurological toxicity events in the SOCs of “nervous system disorders” and “psychiatric 
disorders” in the updated GCT3013-01-ESC CSR to be submitted on or before 22 Dec 2023. 
The applicant has updated the programming codes to ensure that the symptoms will be 
excluded from SAE Listing 16.2.7.3 in the updated GCT3013-01-ESC CSR that will be 
submitted on or before 22 Dec 2023. 
Although the GCP findings had no impact on the Expansion part of the study, an updated GCT3013-01-
EXP-aNHL CSR can also be provided upon request on or before 22 Dec 2023. It is not really 
understood, what type of updates are to be expected in the CSR of the expansion phase. The provision 
of the final CSR of the expansion phase is already part of the specific obligations and will be submitted 
in Q3/2026. Unless the updated CSR of the escalation phase warrants further updates of the CSR of 
the expansion phase, the submission of the final CSR of the expansion phase is considered sufficient. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA   
To address the uncertainties of the absence of direct comparator data and a limited safety base in size 
and follow-up, the applicant proposes to provide additional data in the context of a CMA. Confirmatory 
data will be provided from the ongoing randomized controlled phase 3 trial GCT3013-05, comparing 
the efficacy and safety of epcoritamab to standard-of-care immunochemotherapy (i.e., R-GemOx or 
BR) in approximately 480 patients with R/R DLBCL. Additionally, the final CSR with longer follow-up of 
the ongoing GCT3013-01 will provide data to inform the long-term safety of epcoritamab in this patient 
population. 
Regarding a MTA based on safety, it is agreed with the applicant that the different authorized medicinal 
products are characterized by specific safety profiles, but this does not automatically mean that the 
epcoritamab safety profile is beneficial compared to the other authorized products. More specifically, it 
is difficult to compare the tolerability of treatment and prevalence of specific adverse events in a 
meaningful way without any direct comparative studies.  
With regards to the comparison to polatuzumab, the studies record substantially different rates of AEs 
associated with the particular mechanisms of action of polatuzumab and epcoritamab. Peripheral 
neuropathy is characteristic of tubulin targeting agents such as the vedotin toxin of polatuzumab, and 
was observed in 44% in polatuzumab + BR treated patients, whereas it was only reported in 2% of 
those treated with epcoritamab. Moreover CRS, which is characteristic of T-cell engagers, is seen in 
49% of those treated with epcoritamab and not reported for polatuzumab + BR. Although it cannot be 
stated with certainty that one product is safer than the other, CRS is treatable and reversible, while 
neuropathy may be irreversible. Based on this, epcoritamab has a safety advantage over polatuzumab 
+ BR due to the abovementioned differential ADR profiles resulting from the respective mechanisms of 
action.  
Compared to the conditionally approved product loncastuximab tesirine, it is difficult to draw 
conclusions whether epcoritamab is associated with less severe toxicity, also taking into account the 
limitations of cross study comparisons. On the one hand, epcoritamab had numerically less Grade 3/4 
AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation, but on the other hand more SAEs were reported. Fatal AEs 
were reported to a similar extent for epcoritamab and loncastuximab. The type of AEs observed for 
both products are different probably related to their different MoAs with specific toxicities of 
epcoritamab being CRS, ICANS, and serious infections; and oedema or effusion and increased liver 
function tests for loncastuximab tesirine, It can, therefore, not be concluded whether epcoritamab has 
a more favourable toxicity profile, but there are no signals that the toxicity profile is worse compared 
to loncastuximab tesirine. Furthermore, pixantrone is associated with cardiac failure, a known risk of 
anthracycline drugs and may be irreversible. Chemoimmunotherapy is associated with cytopaenias and 
gastrointestinal toxicity. Myelosuppression is observed for tafasitamab+lenalidomide. The type of AEs 
observed for CAR T cell therapies are similar to the ones reported for epcoritamab, but epcoritamab is 
immediately available.   
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile is in line with what can be expected for a bispecific CD3/CD20-directed T-cell 
engager and the preclinical toxicity findings. Due to the MoA of activating T-cells CRS, ICANS, and 
CTLS are to be expected, as are cytopenias and infections with bispecific antibodies. 
Important identified risks associated with epcoritamab therapy are CRS, ICANS, and (serious) 
infections.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 196/209 
 
 
 
The safety profile seems to be acceptable with monitoring and management guidelines considering the 
advanced nature of the disease and the pre-treated patient population under investigation.  
Limitations of the safety database are that it is based on non-comparative data and on a limited 
sample size and follow-up time. The applicant proposes a CMA with confirmatory data from an ongoing 
randomized GCT3013-05 study with epcoritamab monotherapy. Longer follow-up of the GCT3013-01 
study which is currently the basis for the safety profile will be provided with the final CSR of pivotal 
study GCT3013-01 as specific obligation. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
•  Evaluation of safety in long-term exposure (studies GCT3013-01, GCT3013-04, and GCT3013-05) 
•  Evaluation of overall safety profile with comparator data (study GCT3013-05)

2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD).  The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
The QRD Group agreed on the proposed EN only vial label, as well as the 3-4 languages outer carton, 
provided all the legal multilingual requirements are met (e.g., for Belgium). The provision of an EN 
only package leaflet (inside the carton) could be acceptable as long as the MAH commits to print and 
distribute the national language package leaflets alongside the packs. A QR code could also be 
displayed on the carton directing to the package leaflet in all languages. Important information such as 
transport and storage conditions should be readily available on the outer carton and not displayed 
(hidden) on the extra flaps of the carton.  
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included 
in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will 
appear in grey-shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Tepkinly (epcoritamab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tepkinly as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
 DLBCL patients after two or more lines of systemic therapy several therapies are available, namely: 
•  Chemo-immunotherapy (e.g. R-GemOX and BR); responses between 33%-66% have been 
observed, but these therapies are not associated with long term disease control/cure. 
•  CAR T-cell therapies directed at CD19, which have shown CR rates between 28% and 50% with 
generally long durations of response of >17 months, however these therapies do not have 
immediate availability. 
• 
Polivy (anti-CD79b) plus BR for which a CR rate of 57%, an ORR of 70% and DoR of 10 months 
were observed. 
•  Minjuvi (monoclonal antibody against CD19) in combination with lenalidomide, an ORR of 57%, 
for which a CR rate of 40% and a DoR of 44 months were observed. 
•  Zynlonta (ADC targeting CD19); ORR is 48% with 25% of the patients in CR and a DoR of 10.3 
months at a median FU of 7.8 months 
• 
pixantrone (cytotoxic aza-anthracenedione) the ORR and CR rate at the end of the trial were 
40% and 16%.  
While approximately 50% of DLBCL patients are cured by first-line chemoimmunotherapy (Crump et al., 
2017), outcomes are generally poor in patients for whom frontline treatment fails, in particular for 
primary refractory patients (Crump 2017). A recent study of R/R DLBCL patients indicated an ORR of 
27.0% in the third line setting and 9.8% in the fourth- and later lines setting, with a median OS of only 
approximately 6 months in the third- or later lines setting (Radford, 2019). Further, there is lack of a 
consensus on SOC in the third and later lines setting. The majority of R/R DLBCL patients who have 
received two prior lines of systemic therapy are considered incurable. 
The included aNHL disease entities constitute aggressive cancer types with poor prognoses and are 
considered seriously debilitating and life-threatening diseases. There is an unmet need in LBCL patients 
after two or more lines of systemic therapy to improve treatment outcomes in terms of increasing 
(duration of) CR, overcoming resistance to existing therapies and improving safety or providing a 
different safety profile compared to existing therapies. Treatment regimes used for HGBL and PMBCL, 
as well as for those with FL3b, overall are similar to those used for DLBCL and that there is a similar 
degree of unmet medical need across the disease entities included in the aNHL cohort. Also certain 
patients may need therapies with immediate availability (compared to CAR-T cells)

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
GCT3013-01 study is an ongoing FIH, phase 1/2, single arm trial in patients aged 18 years or older 
who had relapsed, progressive and/or refractory mature B-cell lymphoma including an escalation part 
and expansion part with aNHL cohort, an iNHL cohort and a MCL cohort. The expansion part of the 
aNHL cohort is presented as the pivotal study. In this cohort a study population of LBCL patients with 
relapsed or refractory (R/R) disease after at least 2 lines of systemic therapy were treated with 
epcoritamab monotherapy. As of the data cutoff date of 31 Jan 2022, a total of 157 subjects received 
at least one dose of epcoritamab monotherapy in the aNHL expansion cohort. In total 88.5% (N=139) 
DLBCL patients, 5.7% (N=9) HGBL patients, 2.5% (N=4) PMBCL patients and 3.2% (N=5) FL3B 
patients are included. In total 18 patients with HGBCL with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 by either local 
or central analyses were included as part of the LBCL group. The median duration of follow-up was 
10.7 months (range: 0.3, 17.9) and 11.0 months for the DLBCL group (range: 0.3, 17.9). Updated 
efficacy analyses from a data cut-off (DCO: 30 June 2022) with a median study duration follow-up of 
15.7 months were provided in the response to the 1st RSI. 
The epcoritamab dosing schedule in the aNHL expansion cohort consisted of a priming dose (0.16 mg), 
an intermediate dose (0.8mg) and subsequent full doses (48mg), administered subcutaneously QW in 
cycles 1-3, Q2W in cycles 4-9: and Q4W in cycles 10+. 
The primary endpoint was ORR determined by IRC according to Lugano criteria, while important 
secondary endpoints included CRR, DOR, DOCR, TTR, OS, PFS and TTNT. The primary population for 
safety analyses includes 167 aNHL (LBCL) patients, of which 148 were DLBCL. 
The escalation phase of the GCT3013-01 study was used for dose finding. The DLBCL cohort of the 
GCT3013-04 study in Japanese patients (N=36) and a real world evidence study are presented as 
supportive studies. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint IRC-assessed ORR determined by Lugano criteria was 63.1% (95% CI: 55.0, 
70.6) in LBCL patients with 38.9% (95%CI: 31.2, 46.9) of the patients in CR.  
The median DOR by Lugano criteria as assessed by IRC was 12.0 months (95% CI: 6.6, NR) and the 
median DOCR was 12.0 months (95% CI: 9.7, NR) in LBCL patients. The median TTR (by IRC) was 1.4 
(range: 1.0, 8.4) months in LBCL patients, median TTCR was 2.7 months (range: 1.2, 11.1). 
Subgroup analyses are generally consistent with the primary analysis, but indicate better responses in 
subgroups related to longer time since prior anti CD20 therapy.  
In the DLBCL patients the ORR was 61.9% (95%CI: 53.3, 70.0) and the CR rate 38.8% (95%CI: 30.7, 
47.5). The median DOR, DOCR, TTR, and TTCR in the DLBCL subgroup are the same as in LBCL 
patients. In the other LBCL entities responses were seen in all four FL3B (3 patients in CR), in all five 
PMBCL patients (2 patients in CR) and in 44% (N=4/9) HGBL patients (2 patients in CR).  
The median PFS was 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.0, 8.2) in both the DLBCL and LBCL groups. The median 
OS was not reached (95% CI: 11.3, NR) in both the DLBCL group (56 events) and LBCL group (61 
events). 
Updated efficacy analyses from a data cut-off (DCO: 30 June 2022) indicate similar response rates 
compared to the primary analyses. The updated median DOR in subjects with LBCL is 15.5 (9.7, NR) 
months and in DLBCL patients 15.6 months (95% CI: 9.7, NR).

In the GCT3013-04 study in a similar population of Japanese patients, the ORR based on IRC 
assessment by Lugano criteria was 55.6% (95% CI: 38.1, 72.1) with a CR rate of 44.4% (95% CI: 
27.9, 61.9) and the median DOR was not reached at a median follow up of 8.4 months 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The pivotal study is a single arm, exploratory study. This study design introduces inherent limitations 
as the therapeutic effect might be subject to various sources of bias. In addition, efficacy may be 
overestimated in such a study design. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution, 
however it should also be noted that replication is observed in an independent GCT3013-04 study, 
which diminishes the concerns on chance findings. 
The uncontrolled nature of the pivotal study GCT3013-01 means that the treatment effect on time-to-
event outcomes such as PFS and OS cannot be truly isolated, and therefore these results should be 
interpreted with caution. 
The choice of 0.16 mg/0.8 mg/48 mg as proposed posology is not objected, however it is uncertain 
whether the most optimal dose has been selected. Exposure-response analyses support the 48 mg as a 
dose with acceptable efficacy and safety, but also indicates that other doses might be equally 
effective/safe. Furthermore, there seems to be some data pointing to a rationale for a type of step up 
dosing, however this is not directly confirmed or sufficiently supported with non-clinical or clinical data. 
The usefulness of the real-world data is very uncertain considering the methods which led to 
differences in the pivotal study population and the real world study population. A prolonged patient 
inclusion period during which new therapies and new response criteria where introduced, limit the 
usefulness of the real world data for contextualization purposes. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The primary safety analysis set included 167 patients with LBCL, including 148 DLBCL patients, from 
the dose escalation and expansion parts of the GCT3013-01 study who were assigned to receive the 48 
mg full dose of epcoritamab and received at least 1 dose of epcoritamab. Data cutoff date for the 
safety analysis was at 31 January 2022. 
•  Median treatment duration was 3.7 months with 69 patients (41.3%) having at treatment duration 
of 6 months and 30 patients (18.0%) having a treatment duration of ~12 months. At data cutoff, 
31.7% were still on study treatment. 
• 
The most common (≥20%) TEAEs of any grade included CRS (50.3%), fatigue (24.6%), pyrexia 
(22.8%), injection site reaction (22.2%), neutropaenia (22.2%), and nausea (20.4%). Most events 
occurred in the first 8-week treatment period. 
•  Most TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity (except for cytopaenias), and most events occurred with 
highest frequency during the first 8 weeks of treatment (except for infections with similar 
incidences in the different treatment periods). 
•  Based on investigator assessment, treatment-related TEAEs reported in ≥10% of patients included 
CRS (50.3%), injection site reactions (22.2%), neutropaenia (18.0%), fatigue (15.0%), and 
pyrexia (11.4%). Apart from neutropaenia, most treatment-related TEAEs were low-grade. 
•  Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were reported in 62.9%. The most common (≥5%) Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs 
were haematological and included neutropenia (15.6%), anaemia (10.2%), neutrophil count 
decreased (6.0%), and thrombocytopaenia (6.0%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 202/209 
 
 
 
•  Serious TEAEs were observed in 58.1%. The most common serious TEAEs (≥2%) included CRS 
(31.1%), pleural effusion (4.8%), pneumonia (2.4%), febrile neutropaenia (2.4%), pyrexia (2.4%), 
sepsis (2.4%), and ICANS (2.4%). 
• 
• 
Fatal (Grade 5) TEAEs were reported in 12 (7.2%) patients, of which one event of ICANS was 
considered to be related to epcoritamab. The other fatal TEAEs were considered to be related to 
disease progression, COVID-19, or existing comorbidities/impact of prior therapies. 
TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was seen in 7.8%, most often due to myelodysplastic 
syndrome, COVID-19, and COVID-19 pneumonia. 
•  CRS, ICANS, and CTLS were considered to be AESI, consistent with the mechanism of action of 
epcoritamab. 
o  CRS was experienced by 50.3%, with 31.1% having maximum Grade 1, 16.8% maximum 
Grade 2, and 2.4% maximum Grade 3. Most events occurred with the first full dose. The 
median time to resolution of CRS events was 2.0 days. 46.1% received concomitant 
medication to treat CRS including 15.0% receiving tocilizumab and 10.8% receiving 
corticosteroids beyond prophylaxis. In 0.6% the event led to treatment discontinuation. 
o 
ICANS occurred in 6.0%, with 4.2% having maximum Grade 1, 1.2% maximum Grade 2, and 
0.6% Grade 5 ICANS. The median time to resolution was 5.0 days and none of the events led 
to treatment discontinuation. 
o  CTLS was reported in 1.2%, all were Grade 3 or higher and were unresolved when the patients 
died of disease progression. 
•  Serious TEAEs of infection were reported in 16.2% and fatal infections in 2.4%; none of the fatal 
infections were considered related to epcoritamab. 
A larger supportive safety analysis set consisted of patients from both the GCT3013-01 and the 
GCT3013-04 studies who were assigned to receive the 48 mg dose regimen and received at least 1 
dose of epcoritamab with 374 patients with B-NHL. The safety results from the supportive safety 
analysis set were generally consistent with the primary safety analysis set of patients with LBCL, 
although the incidence of CRS was higher in the supportive safety pool. Uncertainties and limitations

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The prognosis for patients with R/R DLBCL remains poor and new treatment alternatives in this setting 
are welcome. Therefore, the responses and duration of response observed in the study population of 
aNHL subtype DLBCL, who are R/R after two or more lines of systemic therapy are considered to be 
clinically relevant. Particularly the CR rate associated with epcoritamab is considered to be of relevance 
for patients. The response occurs shortly after treatment initiation, which is considered important in a 
population with rapidly progressing disease. Of note, clinically relevant results have also been observed 
in HGBL and DH/TH disease, PMBCL and FL3B. Although subgroups are small, based on the MoA of 
epcoritamab and similarities in disease and biology to DLBCL, benefit could also be expected in these 
patients. 
The single arm, exploratory design of the study, however, introduces inherent limitations as the 
observed therapeutic effect might be subject to various sources of bias. In addition, efficacy may be 
overestimated in such a study design, the sample size is limited, duration of follow-up is short and 
there is possible variability in treatment efficacy across the population included. Therefore, the results 
should be interpreted with caution and confirmation of efficacy in the target patient population is 
required. As such the request for conditional approval is appropriate, meeting the requirements for a 
conditional approval is discussed below.  
Overall, the safety profile is in line with what can be expected for a bispecific CD3/CD20-directed T-cell 
engager and the preclinical toxicity findings with CRS, ICANS, CTLS, cytopaenias, and infections. 
Limitations of the safety database relate to the data being of non-comparative nature and the limited 
sample size and follow-up time, although there is clinical experience with other bispecific T-cell 
engagers. The safety profile seems to be acceptable with monitoring and management guidelines 
considering the advanced nature of the disease and the pre-treated patient population under 
investigation. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Clinically relevant (complete) responses and duration of response were observed in DLBCL patients 
who are R/R after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The benefit is considered to outweigh the 
safety profile. However, confirmation of efficacy and safety is needed due to the limitations associated 
with the study design (see section 3.7.3. below). 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
As discussed, the single arm exploratory trial design introduces inherent limitations in the 
interpretation of the results, based on non-comparative data, further the safety database is limited in 
size and follow-up. Overall, the results of the pivotal study should be interpreted with caution and 
confirmation of efficacy and safety in the R/R DLBCL population is required. Although it should be

noted that replication is observed in GCT3013-04 study, which diminishes the concerns on chance 
findings. 
Based on the above, the clinical data cannot be considered comprehensive. 
Conditional Marketing Authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available as discussed above, a conditional marketing 
authorisation was requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a seriously debilitating, life-
threatening disease. In addition the product is designated as an orphan medicinal product.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
•  The benefit-risk balance is positive 
The benefit – risk balance is positive (see section 3.6.)  
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
Phase 3 GCT3013-05 is proposed as a confirmatory study. This study is an open-label, randomised, 
trial of epcoritamab versus the pre-specified investigator's choice of SOC of R-GemOx or BR in patients 
aged 18 years or older with R/R DLBCL who failed a previous ASCT or are ineligible for ASCT at 
screening and previously treated with at least 1 line of systemic antineoplastic therapy, including anti-
CD20 monoclonal antibody-containing combination chemotherapy. Approximately 480 subjects with 
DLBCL and HGBL (240 in each arm) will be enrolled in the trial, with a primary endpoint of OS. In 
order to confirm the safety and efficacy of epcoritamab in the treatment of R/R DLBCL after two or 
more lines of systemic therapy, the results of the primary and final safety and efficacy analyses for 
study GCT3013-05 should be submitted. The proposed due date for the primary analysis CSR 
(including final OS analysis) is Q4/2024. The proposed due date for the final CSR including long term 
safety data is Q1 2029. 
The applicant agrees to submit the final CSR for the pivotal GCT30313-01 study as specific obligation. 
•  The unmet medical need will be addressed. 
When comparing the efficacy results of epcoritamab to available therapies for the target population 
with a CMA, being Minjuvi, Zynlonta and Columvi, epcoritamab addresses the unmet medical need to a 
similar extent with no signals that the toxicity profile of epcoritamab is worse compared to Minjuvi 
Zynlonta and Columvi. The applicant has satisfactorily provided evidence of MTA over polatuzumab 
vedotin (+BR), CAR-T therapies and pixantrone which have a full MA. 
Compared to therapies with a full approval, epcoritamab has numerically substantial higher rates in 
terms of ORR and CR rate compared to Pixuvri, which together with the long DoR epcoritamab for 
epcoritamab will provide meaningful clinically effects for the target population. It is also noted that 
many (D)LBCL patients in 3L+ will have met their maximum recommended anthracycline allotment 
and therefore further treatment with anthracycline drugs (such as Pixuvri) will come with a risk of 
precipitating heart failure, whereas this risk is not expected with epcoritamab.  
With regards to CAR T cells (Kymriah, Yescarta and Breyanzi), it is noted that ORR and CR rate are 
numerically lower compared to Yescarta, Breyanzi. However, it is considered that epcoritamab 
introduces a MTA in patient care over all CAR T-cell therapies (Kymriah, Yescarta and Bryeanzi)  
epcoritamab will present a treatment for immediate administration to the patient.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023  
Page 206/209 
 
 
 
With regard to Polivy+ BR potential differences in analysis methods and the inherent weaknesses of 
cross study comparisons do not allow  firm conclusions of MTA in terms of ORR and CR rate; when 
considering the median DOR cross-study comparison seems to favor epcoritamab over polatuzumab + 
BR.   
Nonetheless , it is considered that epcoritamab will provide meaningful clinical effects in patients with 
R/R DLBCL, particularly as evidence of activity is shown in patients who have failed prior CAR t cell 
therapy. Thus constitute an additional treatment option in this non-curative 3L+ setting. Regarding the 
safety profile, it is difficult to compare the tolerability of treatment and prevalence of specific adverse 
events in polatuzumab +BR treated compared to epcoritamab treated cohorts in a meaningful way 
without any direct comparative studies. However, the studies record substantially different rates of AEs 
associated with the particular mechanisms of action of polatuzumab and epcoritamab. Peripheral 
neuropathy is characteristic of tubulin targeting agents such as the vedotin toxin of polatuzumab, and 
was observed in 44% in polatuzumab + BR treated patients, whereas it was only reported in 2% of 
those treated with epcoritamab. Moreover CRS, which is characteristic of T-cell engagers, is seen in 
49% of those treated with epcoritamab and not reported for polatuzumab + BR. Although it cannot be 
stated with certainty that one product is safer than the other, CRS is treatable and reversible, while 
neuropathy may be irreversible. Based on this, epcoritamab has a safety advantage over polatuzumab 
+ BR due to the above mentioned differential ADR profiles resulting from the respective mechanisms of 
action. 
A MTA of epcoritamab over polatuzumab + BR has been shown based on the lack of peripheral 
neuropathies. Additionally, compared to polatuzumab + BR, epcoritamab has shown evidence of 
activity in patients who have failed prior CAR t cell therapy, while polatuzumab + BR has yet to 
demonstrate effect in this setting.   
The route of administration as subcutaneous (SC) has been discussed in terms of patient convenience, 
however it is uncertain if this led to advantages for patients such as decreased hospitalisation, and 
reduced treatment burden and does not constitute a MTA. 
In conclusion, an MTA has been shown for epcoritamab over approved products (Kymriah, Yescarta, 
Breyanzi, Polivy, Pixruvi) and epcoritamab addresses the unmet medical need to at least a similar 
extent as the conditionally approved products (Minjuvi, Zynlonta and Columvi). 
•  The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in 
the fact that additional data are still required.  
Given the aggressiveness of the disease and poor prognosis in R/R DLBCL patients in the third- and 
later lines of therapy, as well as the fact that the benefit-risk balance of Tepkinly is positive (see 
assessment above), it is agreed that the benefits to public health of immediate availability outweigh 
the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.   
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Tepkinly is positive, subject to the conditions stated in the section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Tepkinly is not similar to Yescarta, Polivy, Minjuvi, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419797/2023

Kymriah and Columvi within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Tepkinly is favourable in the following indication: 
Tepkinly as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:

•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Additional risk minimisation measures to minimise the important identified risks of CRS and 
ICANS consist of a Patient Card targeted to patients treated with epcoritamab. 
Prior to the launch of epcoritamab in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
(MAH) must agree about the content and format of the patient card, including communication 
media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National 
Competent Authority.  
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure that in each Member State where 
epcoritamab is marketed, HCPs who are expected to prescribe epcoritamab and patients treated 
with epcoritamab have access to/are provided with the Patient Card which will inform and explain 
to patients the risks of CRS and ICANS.  
The Patient Card will contain the following key messages:

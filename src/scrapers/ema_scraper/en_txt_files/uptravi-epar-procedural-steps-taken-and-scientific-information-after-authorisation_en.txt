Update of the SmPC  section 5.1: In a double blind, 
dyspepsia as a new ADR  with frequency common, 
and to include further information on the frequency 
of dyspepsia and on haemoglobin decrease in 
patients receiving triple combination therapy, and to 
add efficacy and mortality data of initial triple 
placebo-controlled study, a total of 247 newly diagnosed 
PAH patients were randomised to evaluate the treatment 
effect of initial triple (selexipag, macitentan and tadalafil) 
(N = 123) versus initial double (placebo, macitentan and 
tadalafil) (N = 124) therapy. The primary endpoint, change

are issued for all other procedures.

CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

combination treatment with selexipag, macitentan 
and tadalafil in newly diagnosed PAH patients 
compared to initial double combination treatment 
with placebo, macitentan and tadalafil, based on the 
Studies AC-065A308  (TRITON)  and AC-065A404 
(TRACE).  AC-065A308  (TRITON)  study was a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, Phase 3b, efficacy and safety study 
comparing triple oral combination therapy 
(selexipag, macitentan, tadalafil) with double oral 
combination therapy (placebo, macitentan, tadalafil) 
in newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve participants 
with PAH.  The AC-065A404 (TRACE)  study was a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, exploratory Phase 4 study in 
participants with PAH to assess the effect of 
selexipag on daily life physical activity and 
participant’s self-reported symptoms and their 
impacts. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
A revised RMP version 9.2 was provided as part of 
the application. 
C.I.4  - Change(s) in the SPC,  Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at 
Week 26, did not show a statistically significant difference 
between the groups, while showing an improvement from 
baseline in both treatment groups (relative reduction by 
54% in the initial triple therapy group vs 52% in the initial 
double therapy group). Over a median follow-up of 2 years, 
4 (3.4%) patients in the triple therapy group and 12 
(9.4%) patients in the double therapy group died. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC  was updated to add dyspepsia as 
a new ADR  with frequency ‘common’ and to include the 
information that mean absolute changes in haemoglobin at 
regular visits compared to baseline ranged from - 1.77 to - 
1.26 g/dL in the triple therapy group (selexipag, 
macitentan, tadalafil) compared to - 1.61 to - 1.28 g/dL in 
the double therapy group (placebo, macitentan and 
tadalafil). A decrease from baseline in haemoglobin 
concentration to below 10 g/dL was reported in 19.0% of 
patients in the triple therapy group and 14.5% in the 
double therapy group. Anaemia was reported with very 
common frequency (13.4%) in the triple therapy group 
compared to common frequency (8.3%) in the double 
therapy group.

survival and safety data from study AC-065A303  a 
long-term single-arm, open-label study to evaluate 
the safety and tolerability of selexipag / ACT-293987 
in patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement 
minor editorial changes and update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet.

3 trial for the authorisation of selexipag in pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH), entered a long-term, 
uncontrolled open-label extension study. Given that 
additional PAH treatment was initiated in a proportion of 
those patients and that there was no control group in the 
extension study, the survival benefit of selexipag cannot be 
confirmed from these data. 
The long-term follow up of selexipag treated patients 
showed a safety profile similar to that which had been 
observed in the pivotal clinical study.

open-label, randomised, two-treatment crossover 
Phase 1 study investigating the effect of selexipag on 
the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and its 
metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam in healthy male 
subjects. An updated RMP (version 5.4) has also 
been submitted, to add the results of study AC-065-

In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder

AC-065-110,  make minor amendments to sections

strong inhibitor of CYP2C8,  exposure to selexipag increased 
PL 
approximately 2-fold, whereas exposure to the active 
metabolite, the major contributor to efficacy, increased 
approximately 11-fold. Concomitant administration of 
Uptravi with strong inhibitors of CYP2C8  (e.g., gemfibrozil) 
is contraindicated. 
The effect of moderate inhibitors of CYP2C8 (e.g., 
clopidogrel, deferasirox, teriflunomide) on the exposure to 
selexipag and its active metabolite has not been studied. 
An adjustment of the dose of Uptravi should be considered 
in case a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8  is coadministered or 
discontinued. A potential pharmacokinetic interaction with 
moderate inhibitors of CYP2C8 cannot be excluded. 
In the presence of 600 mg rifampicin, once a day, an 
inducer of CYP2C8  (and UGT enzymes), the exposure to 
selexipag did not change, whereas exposure to the active 
metabolite was reduced by half. Dose adjustment of 
selexipag may be required with concomitant administration 
of inducers of CYP2C8  (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, 
phenytoin).

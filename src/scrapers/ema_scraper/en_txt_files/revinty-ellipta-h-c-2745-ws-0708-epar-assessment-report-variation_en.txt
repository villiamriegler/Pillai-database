1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Glaxo Group Ltd submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 4 February 2015 an application for a variation following a worksharing 
procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
The following changes were proposed:

Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC to clarify the information to prescribers on the initial dose of 
Relvar/Revinty based on the corticosteroid dose equivalence. 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
1.2.  Rationale for the proposed change 
Relvar/Revinty Ellipta has been marketed in several countries and during this time the MAH has received 
feedback from prescribers regarding the wording of the Section 4.2, Posology and method of administration 
of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). Prescribers consider that the Section 4.2 of the SmPC, 
as currently worded, does not provide clear guidance as to which dose of Relvar/Revinty Ellipta should be 
initiated depending on the dose of inhaled corticosteroid the patient is currently receiving. 
The purpose of this submission is to update the wording in the Relvar/Revinty Ellipta SmPC to address the 
feedback from prescribers. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Relvar and Revinty Ellipta 100 µg/25 µg & 200 µg/25 µg inhalation powder are a pre-dispensed multi dose 
dry powder for oral inhalation. The active ingredients are fluticasone furoate (FF) and Vilanterol (VI) (as 
trifenatate). FF is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory activity, while VI is 
a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA). 
Relvar Ellipta was approved in the EU on 13th November 2013 and the duplicate licence, Revinty Ellipta, 
approved in the EU on 2nd May 2014 for the following indication: 
“regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older where use of a combination 
medicinal  product  (long-acting  beta2-agonist  and  inhaled  corticosteroid)  is  appropriate:  patients  not 
adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists”. 
Due to the feedback received from prescribers about the unclear information included in Section 4.2 of the 
SmPC (See Section 1.2 of this AR, Rationale for the proposed change) some wording changes to the SmPC 
have been proposed by the MAH in order to clarify the patients in which to initiate Relvar/Revinty Ellipta.  
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/499766/2015 
Page 4/16 
 
  
  
 
2.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
During the review of the Relvar Ellipta Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA), the applicant was asked 
to  amend  the  wording  of  equivalence  of  fluticasone  fuorate  (FF)  dosing  in  line  with  other  inhaled 
corticosteroid/long-acting beta2-agonists (ICS/LABAs).  
The MAH states now that there is no longer comparable wording regarding corticosteroid dose equivalence 
in either the Seretide Accuhaler/Diskus SmPC or the SmPCs for any other ICS/LABAs. The wording in the 
Seretide Mutual Recognition (MR) SmPC was removed in August 2014 at the request of the Medicines and 
Healthcare  products  Regulatory  Agency  (MHRA)  as  a  post  approval  commitment  following  a  duplicate 
licence procedure. Across the approved SmPCs for ICS containing medicines, there is common language 
that patients should be treated with the dose of the corticosteroid appropriate to the severity of their disease 
but the description of identification of the appropriate patients varies across the labels. However the MAH 
recognises the need for information in the SmPC to guide prescribers to the appropriate patients to initiate 
Relvar/Revinty Ellipta and proposes a change in the wording in the Relvar/Revinty Ellipta SmPC to minimise 
confusion and enable prescribers to initiate Relvar/Revinty Ellipta in appropriate patients, which would be 
reflective of the inclusion criteria of the Phase III studies (Table 1). 
Table 1. Summary of Prior ICS Inclusion Criteria for Phase III Studies 
Therefore, following changes have been proposed in Section 4.2 (deletions strikethrough, additions in 
bold).

In response to CHMP request the company was asked to provide further justification for amending section 
4.2. The full justification is detailed below: 
The  MAH  agreed  that  prescribers  should  be  aware  that  the  potency  of  fluticasone  furoate  (FF)  is  not 
equivalent to fluticasone propionate (FP) and that this is particularly important as the similar names of both 
active  principles  may  lead  to  the  assumption  that  the  two  compounds  are  the  same.  As  a  consequence 
additional wording is proposed in Section 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC to make this clearer. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/499766/2015 
Page 6/16 
 
  
  
 
 
However, the company did not agree with the proposed wording describing FF 100 mcg once daily as  a 
‘mid’ dose only and considers that there are efficacy and safety data to support its description as a ‘low/mid 
dose’ which are discussed below. 
The  MAH  view  is    that  FF100  mcg  once  daily  should  be  considered  a  starting  dose  of  FF  to  be  used  in 
combination with VI for patients uncontrolled on low to mid dose ICS (plus SABA), as supported by clinical 
pharmacology and clinical data. The efficacy of FF 50 mcg has been tested on a number of occasions and 
was not established as an efficacious dose, therefore FF100 mcg once daily is the lowest effective dose. 
Although similar bronchodilatory effects were seen for FF100 mcg once daily and FP250 mcg twice daily, 
and for FF200 mcg once daily and FP 500 mcg twice daily, from a safety perspective a much higher dose 
of FF would need to be administered (FF 644 mcg/daily) to achieve a similar degree of cortisol suppression 
to that seen with FP 500 mcg twice daily; thus FF 200 mcg once daily should not be considered a high dose 
corticosteroid from a systemic safety perspective. 
Since FF monotherapy is not available the MAH believed that the clearest way to inform prescribers of the 
correct strength of RELVAR to use is by the insertion of a table. This table includes the relevant doses of 
the most commonly used inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (FP and budesonide) plus short acting beta agonists 
(SABA)  and  reflects  the  patient  population  recruited  to  the  pivotal  RELVAR  asthma  clinical  studies;  its 
purpose is not to promote switching from other ICS/LABAs to RELVAR but to ensure patients not adequately 
controlled with ICS and 'as needed' SABA are initiated on the most appropriate dose of RELVAR. 
Rationale 
• 
Treatment Guidelines 
Current global asthma treatment guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) (GINA, 
2015)  position  low  dose  ICS  as  doses  that  are  effective  without  significant  risk  of  side-effects  and  high 
doses as those achievable with an acceptable systemic side-effect profile. GINA also classifies the various 
ICS formulations into low, mid and high doses. High doses are doses of ICS that, with prolonged use, are 
associated with increased risk of systemic side effects. However, this does not mean ICS doses within each 
classified  category  are  therapeutically  equivalent,  although  this  is  often  assumed  and  has  lead  to  the 
incorrect assertion that efficacy and safety cannot be separated. In clinical practice, the selection of dose 
should  be  based  on  symptom  control  and  patients  should  be  monitored  to  assess  their  response  to 
treatment and any side effects. The ICS dose should be titrated to the minimum dose that will maintain 
good symptom control and minimise exacerbation risk and potential for side effects. The available clinical 
data, discussed below, support that FF 100 mcg, in combination with the long acting beta agonist, vilanterol 
(VI), is the lowest effective dose of RELVAR. As only two strengths of FF have been developed in combination 
with a long acting beta agonist (LABA) and three strengths of FP/salmeterol are available; it is not possible 
to  directly  equate one  strength of  FF/VI  as  equivalent to one  strength  of  FP/salmeterol.  Consistent  with 
this, it is noted that the current version of GINA has 5 steps with ICS/LABA at steps three and four. Thus 
there is recognition that there are not three strengths of all ICS/LABA combinations available or required. 
• 
Lowest Effective Dose of FF is 100 mcg 
One aim of the FF clinical development program was to identify doses of FF that would achieve an acceptable 
level  of  clinical  efficacy,  for  both  lung  function  and  symptomatic  parameters,  without  compromising  the 
safety profile. Although the dose response to ICS for improved lung function is shallow, it was considered 
that a single ICS strength would not meet the needs of all asthma patients. Consequently a wide range of 
FF  doses  were  evaluated  to  identify  the  optimal  FF  doses.  Three  Phase  IIb  dose-ranging  studies  were 
conducted  in  subjects  symptomatic  on  short-acting  beta2-agonists  (FFA109687),  low  dose  ICS 
(FFA109685) and medium doses of ICS ([FFA109684) and tested a range of doses of FF (from 25 mcg to 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/499766/2015

800 mcg once daily, dosed in the evening). In these dose-ranging studies, FF was well tolerated at doses 
up to 600 mcg, while at 800 mcg significant urinary cortisol suppression was observed. Results for different 
FF doses on trough FEV1 from the three dose ranging studies in subjects with varying severity of asthma 
are summarised in Figure 1 and show substantial efficacy (>200 mL improvement in trough FEV1) with FF 
100 mcg once daily and near maximal efficacy with FF 200 mcg once daily. 
Figure 1. Adjusted Treatment Differences From Placebo of Change from Baseline in Trough FEV1 (L) 
(LOCF) at Week 8 Across FF Dose-Ranging Studies in Asthma 
In FFA109687, the FF 50 mcg group failed to meet the pre-defined 200 mL difference from placebo (129 
mL [95% CI: 11, 247]), although this difference was statistically significant. A post hoc analysis by 
baseline lung function confirmed that in subjects with more severe asthma (FEV1 ≤65% of predicted 
normal) trough FEV1 improvements relative to placebo were substantially lower at 50 mcg (36 mL [95% 
CI: -181, 253]) than at 100 mcg (267 mL [95% CI: 70, 463]) or 200 mcg (190 mL [95% CI: -6, 386]). 
Based on these data it was concluded that FF 50 mcg once daily is not an adequate dose for patients who 
are candidates for treatment with an ICS/LABA combination. 
The ineffectiveness of FF 50 mcg was confirmed in the FF monotherapy phase III development program. 
Two studies were conducted with FF 50 mcg once daily (FFA115283 and FFA115285). Both studies were 
placebo-controlled, parallel group, randomised studies that recruited patients on SABA only or on non ICS 
controller  medication.  FFA115283  was  a  12  week  study  comparing  FF50  mcg  once  daily  with  placebo. 
FFA115285 was a 24 week study comparing FF50 mcg once daily with placebo and it also included an FP100 
mcg twice daily arm. In both studies the primary endpoint was trough FEV1 and the powered secondary 
endpoint was rescue free 24 hour periods. In FFA115283 statistically significant differences for FF 50 mcg 
relative to placebo were observed in trough FEV1 (120 mL; p=0.012) and in percentage of rescue-free 24-
hour periods over Weeks 1-12 (11.6%; p=0.004) (O'Byrne, 2014). However in FFA115285 the difference 
in trough FEV1 for FF 50 mcg once daily relative to placebo was 37mL and was not statistically significant 
(p = 0.430) nor was the difference in the percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods for FF 50 mcg once 
daily relative to placebo over Weeks 1-24 significant (treatment difference was 7.8%, p =0.084) (Busse, 
2014). In contrast in FFA115285 the difference between FP100 mcg twice daily and placebo was statistically 
significant for both trough FEV1 (treatment difference 102mL, p=0.030) and rescue- free 24 hour periods 
(treatment  difference  10.6%,  p=0.020).  The  failure  to  replicate  the  efficacy  of  FF  50  mcg  once  daily  in 
studies  FFA115283  and  FFA115285  has  confirmed  that  the  lowest  effective  dose  of  FF  in  adults  and 
adolescent subjects with asthma is FF100 mcg once daily. Consequently from an efficacy point of view FF/VI 
Type II variation assessment report

100/25 mcg once daily is a suitable starting dose in adults/adolescents not adequately controlled with ICS 
and 'as needed' SABA. 
• 
Impact of Pharmacological Differences Between Corticosteroids 
It is acknowledged that the potential for confusion in understanding the posology for FF relative to FP may 
arise  due  to  similarity  in  their  names  and  not  recognising  the  differences  in  their  pharmacological  and 
physicochemical properties. FF and FP are not pro-drug esters of fluticasone and their efficacy is dependent 
on the intact  molecules.  The  two  molecules have  distinct  properties  with the furoate  moiety  in  FF  being 
responsible for enhanced glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity and longer lung retention compared to FP 
and  other  ICS  molecules  (Daley-Yates,  2015).  These  features  allow  FF  to  be  effective  when  given  once 
daily, at low delivered dose relative to other ICS. 
The structural features of FF that give rise to high potency also result in lower systemic exposure. Enhanced 
potency leads to greater lipophilicity (since the molecular structural features that confer greater potency 
also  confer  greater  lipophilicity),  slower  dissolution  and  absorption  of  inhaled  drug  particles  with  longer 
retention times in the airways. Once absorbed, more potent ICS such as FF have higher plasma protein 
binding,  lower  unbound  fractions  in  plasma  and  larger  volumes  of  distribution.  Such  molecules  are  also 
good  substrates  for  drug  metabolising  enzymes  and  have  high  systemic  clearance,  high  first  pass 
metabolism and low oral bioavailability of the swallowed dose. All these factors, together with the lower 
dose  that  greater  potency  affords,  favour  low  systemic  drug  concentrations,  thereby  providing  better 
targeting of the drug to the site of action and improving the therapeutic index (Daley-Yates, 2015). 
•  Systemic Effects of ICS 
An HPA axis safety study, in subjects with asthma, showed that both FF 100 mcg once daily and 200 mcg 
once daily, both in combination with the LABA, vilanterol (VI), had no significant effects on 24 hour serum 
cortisol,  and  hence  are  not  high  doses  of  ICS  in  terms  of  systemic  effects  (Allen,  2013b).  In  a  clinical 
pharmacology study comparing the effect of FF and FP on cortisol supression in healthy subjects (which 
represents worst case scenario as greater systemic exposure occurs in healthy subjects than in asthmatic 
subjects), a dose response for cortisol suppression was seen for both FF and FP. FF 100 mcg once daily and 
200 mcg once daily resulted in 7% and 13% cortisol suppression, respectively, compared with 15% and 
30% cortisol suppression for FP 250 mcg twice daily and 500 mcg twice daily, respectively (Figure 2). The 
study concluded that a nominal dose of FF 644 mcg/day was equivalent to FP 1000 mcg/day in terms of 
cortisol suppression (Figure 2). 
In addition, a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model of cortisol suppression has been established over 
a wide range of systemic FF exposures representing the therapeutic and supratherapeutic range in both 
patients and healthy subjects (Allen, 2013a). The PK/PD model predicted an FF AUC24 of 1,000 pg·h/mL, 
several times the exposure associated with FF doses of 100 or 200 mcg/day, would be required to reduce 
24-h serum cortisol by 20%. This finding is in agreement with the data from study FFA103096 shown in 
Figure 2. Therefore the totality of the cortisol suppression data demonstrate that despite its higher potency, 
FF 200 mcg has similar systemic effects compared with FP 250 mcg twice daily and lower systemic effects 
compared with FP 500 mcg twice daily and that even the highest FF dose should not be regarded, as a high 
dose ICS in terms of systemic effects. Furthermore, FF 100 mcg once daily can be deemed a low dose ICS 
in terms of its systemic effects due to its very low potential for cortisol suppressive effects. 
In summary, the dose of FF shown to produce equivalent cortisol suppression to FP 1000 mcg daily was 
644 mcg daily which is more than three times the highest licensed dose of FF used in combination with VI.

Patient Populations Recruited to Pivotal Studies 
The table proposed for inclusion in the SPC reflects the population recruited to the pivotal studies. In 
study HZA106827 all subjects had to be using a low to mid dose ICS or a low dose ICS/ LABA for at least 
12 weeks prior to Visit 1 and maintained on a stable ICS dose (FP 100–250 mcg twice daily or equivalent) 
for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 to be eligible for enrolment. 
Table 1 provides details of doses of commonly prescribed ICS combination medication which were 
permitted per protocol prior to enrolment into HZA106827. 
These doses are appropriate for asthma patients with mild to moderate disease. During run-in, the most 
commonly used ICS was FP (55%) with a mean total daily dose of 334.3 mcg, followed by budesonide 
(24%) with a mean total daily dose of 482.7 mcg and beclomethasone dipropionate (14%) with a mean 
total daily dose of 267.3 mcg. 
Table 1. ICS entry medication in HZA106827 
In study HZA106829 all subjects had to be using high dose ICS (or mid dose ICS/LABA) for at least 12 
weeks prior to Visit 1 and as a consequence subjects on ICS only were maintained on a stable ICS dose (FP 
500mcg twice daily or equivalent) for 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Table 2 provides details of doses of commonly 
prescribed ICS medication which were permitted per protocol prior to enrolment into HZA106829. These 
doses are appropriate for asthma patients with moderate to severe disease. The most frequently used ICS

during the run-in period of the study was FP with 61% of subjects overall. The mean daily dose of FP was 
similar  over  the  three  groups  (ranging  from  551.1  mcg  in  the  FF  200  group  to  583.2  mcg  in  the  FF/VI 
200/25 group). 
Table 2. ICS entry medication in HZA106829 
MAH’s conclusion 
GSK  believed  that  FF100  mcg  once  daily  should  be  considered  a  starting  dose  of  FF  to  be  used  in 
combination with VI for patients uncontrolled on low to mid dose ICS (plus SABA), as supported by clinical 
pharmacology and clinical data. The efficacy of FF 50 mcg has been tested on a number of occasions and 
was not established as an efficacious dose in adults and adolescents, therefore FF100 mcg once daily is the 
lowest  effective  dose.  Although  similar  bronchodilatory  effects  were  seen  for  FF100  mcg  once  daily  and 
FP250 mcg twice daily, and for FF200 mcg once daily and FP 500 mcg twice daily, from a safety perspective 
a much higher dose of FF would need to be administered (FF 644 mcg/daily) to achieve a similar degree of 
cortisol suppression to that seen with FP 500 mcg twice daily; thus FF 200 mcg once daily should not be 
considered a high dose corticosteroid from a systemic safety perspective. 
GSK agrees with the Agency that prescribers should be aware of the potency differences between FF and 
FP. Since FF monotherapy is not available in the EU the company proposes to include a table instructing 
prescribers as to which strength of FF/VI is appropriate for eligible patients to step up to if they are not 
adequately controlled on ICS and ‘as needed’ SABA. This table includes the relevant doses of the most 
commonly used inhaled ICS plus SABA and reflects the patient population recruited to the pivotal RELVAR 
asthma  clinical  studies.  The  purpose  of  the  table  is  not  to  promote  switching  from  other  ICS/LABAs  to 
RELVAR, but to ensure patients not adequately controlled with ICS and 'as needed' SABA are initiated on 
the most appropriate dose of the combination, and has been revised to address the Agency’s concerns. 
In  consideration  of  both  the  efficacy  and  safety  (cortisol  suppression)  data  provided  herein,  GSK  has 
proposed additional changes to the posology section (with supportive data provided in Section 5.1). These 
changes are based on the data generated in the Relvar program and are intended to aid prescribers in dose 
selection, while also addressing the concerns raised by the Agency. 
Proposed amendments to the SmPC by MAH 
Following amendments have been proposed (New text is shown in italics, deleted text in strikethrough) 
Section 4.2. Dosage and Administration 
A  starting  dose  of  Relvar  Ellipta  92/22  micrograms  should  be  considered  for  adults  and  adolescents  12 
years and over who require a low to mid dose of inhaled corticosteroid in combination with a long-acting 
beta2 agonist. If patients are inadequately controlled on Relvar Ellipta 92/22 micrograms, the dose can be 
increased to 184/22 micrograms, which may provide additional improvement in asthma control.

Patients  should  be  regularly  reassessed  by  a  healthcare  professional  so  that  the  strength  of  fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol  they  are  receiving  remains  optimal  and  is  only  changed  on  medical  advice.  The  dose 
should be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained. 
Relvar Ellipta 184/22 micrograms should be considered for adults and adolescents 12 years and over who 
require a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroid in combination with a long-acting beta2-agonist. 
The maximum recommended dose is Relvar Ellipta 184/22 micrograms once daily. Patients with asthma 
should be given the strength of Relvar Ellipta containing the appropriate fluticasone furoate (FF) dosage for 
the severity of their disease (see Table 1). If patients are inadequately controlled on Relvar Ellipta 92/22 
micrograms, the dose can be increased to 184/22 micrograms, which may provide 
additional improvement in asthma control. 
Table 1 Recommended dose of Relvar Ellipta for patients uncontrolled on an inhaled corticosteroid and a 
short acting beta2-agonist 
Patients  should  be  regularly  reassessed  by  a  healthcare  professional  so  that  the  strength  of  fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol  they  are  receiving  remains  optimal  and  is  only  changed  on  medical  advice.  The  dose 
should be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained.  
Prescribers should be aware that fluticasone furoate is a novel inhaled corticosteroid with different dosing 
requirements to other inhaled corticosteroids including fluticasone propionate (see Section 5.1) 
Prescribers  should  be  aware  that  in  patients  with  asthma,  in  terms  of  effects  on  lung  function  and 
symptomatic endpoints, fluticasone furoate 92 micrograms once daily is similar to fluticasone propionate 
250 micrograms twice daily, while fluticasone furoate 184 micrograms once daily is similar to fluticasone 
propionate  500  micrograms  twice  daily.  In  terms  of  cortisol  suppression,  fluticasone  furoate  184 
micrograms once daily is similar to fluticasone propionate 250 micrograms twice daily (see Section 5.1). 
Section 5.1. Pharmacodynamic Effects 
Fluticasone furoate 
Fluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with potent antiinflammatory activity. The 
precise mechanism through which fluticasone furoate affects asthma and COPD symptoms is not known. 
Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g. eosinophils, 
macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g. cytokines and chemokines involved in inflammation). In 
vitro the binding affinity of fluticasone furoate for the human glucocorticoid receptor is approximately 30 
times that of dexamethasone and 1.7 times that of fluticasone propionate. Fluticasone furoate also has a 
greater cellular accumulation and a slower rate of cellular efflux compared with other glucocorticoids 
including fluticasone propionate, consistent with greater tissue retention. This higher glucocorticoid 
receptor binding affinity and longer tissue retention results in a greater topical efficacy in the airways for 
fluticasone furoate compared with fluticasone propionate. In clinical studies, fluticasone furoate 92 
micrograms once daily was similar to fluticasone propionate 250 micrograms twice daily and fluticasone 
furoate 184 micrograms once daily was similar to fluticasone propionate 500 micrograms twice daily in 
terms of improvements in lung function and symptom control. In patients with asthma or COPD 
fluticasone furoate 92 and 184 micrograms once daily did not produce detectable cortisol suppression. In 
healthy subjects, where greater systemic exposure occurred, fluticasone furoate 100 and 200 micrograms 
once daily produced a dose-related decrease in 24hour serum cortisol of 7% and 13%, respectively. A 
greater effect was seen with fluticasone propionate 250 and 500 micrograms twice daily which reduced 
24 hour serum cortisol by 15% and 30%, respectively.

2.2.1.  Discussion 
It is acknowledged that the current wording of Section 4.2 may require some amendments. However, the 
new text proposed by the MAH is not agreed and some modifications should be included in order to reflect 
clearly the patients in which to initiate Relvar/Revinty Ellipta. 
It is stated that “a starting dose of Relvar/Revinty Ellipta 92/22 micrograms should be considered for adults 
and adolescents 12 years and over who require a low to mid dose of inhaled corticosteroid in combination 
with  a  long-acting  beta2-agonist.  If  patients  are inadequately  controlled on  Relvar/Revinty  Ellipta  92/22 
micrograms, the dose can be increased to 184/22 micrograms, which may provide additional improvement 
in asthma control”. However, a few lines below, the following statement: “prescribers should be aware that 
in patients with asthma, fluticasone furoate (FF) 100 micrograms once daily is approximately equivalent to 
fluticasone  propionate  (FP)  250  micrograms  twice  daily,  while  FF  200  micrograms  once  daily  is 
approximately  equivalent to  FP  500  micrograms  twice  daily”  has  been  included.  It  should  be noted  that 
these doses are equivalent to medium to high daily doses of inhaled corticosteroids (Global Strategy for 
Asthma Management and Prevention, Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2014), which is not consistent 
with  the  previous  statement.  As  no  appropriate  RELVAR  "low-dose"  strength  of  fluticasone  furoate  is 
currently available for initial treatment of asthma when a ICS/LABA combination is indicated, starting with 
the  medium  ICS  dose  in  RELVAR  instead  of  starting  with  a  low  dose  ICS  available  in  other  ICS/LAMA 
combinations  may  pose  a  risk  of  overtreatment  and  pneumonia.  In  summary,  “low  to  mid”  should  be 
replaced by “medium” according to the established equivalences with FP as follows: 
A starting dose of Relvar/Revinty Ellipta 92/22 micrograms should be considered for adults and adolescents 
12 years and over who require a low to mid medium dose of inhaled corticosteroid in combination with a 
long-acting  beta2-agonist.  If  patients  are  inadequately  controlled  on  Relvar/Revinty  Ellipta  92/22 
micrograms, the dose can be increased to 184/22 micrograms, which may provide additional improvement 
in asthma control.  
The deletion of the equivalence between FF and PF is not agreed, since prescribers should be aware that in 
patients with asthma, potency of this new steroid product is not equivalent to fluticasone propionate. This 
is particularly important regarding the similarity in the name of both active principles that may lead to the 
assumption that the two compounds are the same. On the other hand, the indication approved for RELVAR 
LABA/ICS combination is "for patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ 
inhaled  short-acting  beta2-agonists",  but  not  for  patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  other  inhaled 
corticosteroids.  Therefore,  the  correspondence  included  in  section  4.2  should  be  restricted  to  the 
equivalence in potency with doses of ICS in both directions (not only from other ICSs to RELVAR), and the 
inclusion of a table with a "switching procedure" from any ICS to RELVAR is not endorsed.

The following amended statement may contribute to minimize possible medication errors and consequently, 
it should be maintained and completed as follows: 
“Prescribers should be aware that in patients with asthma, fluticasone furoate (FF) 100 micrograms once 
daily (medium dose) is approximately equivalent to medium doses of fluticasone propionate (FP) (250 
micrograms twice daily) or equivalent (budesonide 400-800 micrograms twice-daily), while FF 200 
micrograms once daily (high dose) is approximately equivalent to high doses of FP (500 micrograms 
twice daily) or equivalent (budesonide 800-1600 micrograms twice-daily). Currently there are no 
RELVAR dose strengths containing low doses of fluticasone furoate and no equivalence with low 
doses of other ICS can be established." 
The MAH proposal to consider FF 100 mcg once daily as a “low/mid” dose instead of a “mid dose” is not 
accepted due to the following considerations: 
Data  from  a  head  to  head  comparison  between  FF/VI  100/25  and  FP/salmeterol  250/50  BD  (previously 
classified as medium dose by the GINA) in a 6 month parallel group phase III study (HZA113091, Woodcock 
A et al. Chest 2013) submitted during the evaluation of Relvar (See EPAR), which randomised 806 patients 
uncontrolled on mid dose ICS (FP 250 mcg bid or equivalent) showed that the efficacy of once-daily FF/VI 
was similar to bid FP/SAL in improving lung function in patients with persistent asthma. Both treatments 
resulted in an improvement in lung function from baseline over 24 h, with a LS mean increase from baseline 
in  weighted  mean  FEV1  (primary  efficacy  endpoint)  of  341  mL  for  the  FF/VI  group  and  377  mL  for  the 
FP/salmeterol  group.  The  adjusted  mean  treatment  difference  of  -37  mL  between  the  groups  was  not 
statistically significant (p=0.162). Trough FEV1 was measured as a secondary endpoint at 24 hours after 
the last dose of FF/VI and 12 hours after the last dose of FP/salmeterol. Subjects in the FP/salmeterol group 
achieved a LS mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 of 300 mL and subjects in the FF/VI group 281 
mL,  the  difference  in  adjusted  mean  of  19  mL  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.485).  There  was  no 
statistically  significant  difference  in  the  “Other”  endpoints  of  AQLQ  score  (adjusted  treatment  difference 
0.09; 95% CI -0.03, 0.21; p=0.130) or ACT score (adjusted treatment difference 0.2; 95% CI -0.2, 0.7; 
p=0.310).  The incidence of asthma exacerbations was low and similar across the treatment groups, with 
the  highest  percentage  of  on-treatment  events  in  the  FP/salmeterol  group  (12  subjects,  3%)  compared 
with the FF/VI group (10 subjects, 2%). One subject in the FF/VI group vs. 2 subjects in the FP/salmeterol 
group were hospitalised due to their asthma exacerbations.   
The incidence and type of on-treatment AEs with FF/VI (213 subjects [53%]) was similar compared with 
FP/salmeterol (198 subjects [49%]). Of these, AEs for 19 subjects [5%] in the FF/VI group were considered 
related to treatment; in the FP/salmeterol group 15 subjects [4%] had AEs considered drug-related. No 
clinically relevant effects on 24-h urine cortisol excretion were found. Analysis of urine cortisol excretion 
for  showed  that  the  FF/VI  to  FP/salmeterol  urine  cortisol  ratio  of  0.85  was  not  statistically  significant 
(p=0.075).  
Overall,  data  from  the  direct  comparison  between  FF/VI  100/25  OD  versus  FP/salmeterol  250/50  BD 
(considered medium dose of CSI) showed similar efficacy and safety profiles.  
Moreover, recruited population in the pivotal study HZA106827 corresponds to uncontrolled patients with 
low to mid doses of CSI. According to the step-wise approach reflected in the GINA as well as the authorized 
indication for Relvar, FF 100 mcg OD can’t be considered as a low dose.   
Based on it, consideration of FF 100 mcg once daily as “a low dose” is not supported and Section 4.2 should 
be maintained as previously proposed (See PI, document attached).  
Additionally, the MAH states that although similar bronchodilatory effects were for FF200 mcg once daily 
and  FP  500  mcg  twice  daily,  from  a  safety  perspective  a  much  higher  dose  of  FF  would  need  to  be

administered (FF 644 mcg/daily) to achieve a similar degree of cortisol suppression to that seen with FP 
500 mcg twice daily; thus FF 200 mcg once daily should not be considered a high dose corticosteroid from 
a systemic safety perspective (Figure 2). Taking into consideration this data, new changes in Section 5.1 
have been proposed. 
This information is not considered to provide relevant information to the prescribers (Guideline on Summary 
of Product Characteristics, Volume 2C NTA) and data comes from a single phase I study (FFA103096) in 
which  FF  100  mcg  once  daily  and  200  mcg  once  daily  resulted  in  7%  and  13%  cortisol  suppression, 
respectively, compared with 15% and 30% cortisol suppression for FP 250 mcg twice daily and 500 mcg 
twice daily (See figure 2).  
Results from HZA106829 phase III study with uncontrolled patients on moderate to high doses of ICS (See 
table 2) which would constitute the target population of Relvar 200 mcg FF, confirmed that 24-hour, free 
cortisol urinalysis found no significant differences, with ratios to baseline of 0.91, 0.98 and 0.84 for FF 200 
OD,  FF/VI  200/25  OD  and  FP  500  BD,  respectively.  Furthermore,  as  all  subjects  entered  the  study  on 
moderate  to  high  doses  of  ICS,  a  decrease  in  free  cortisol  versus  baseline  is  not  expected  (HZA106829 
study report). 
Consequently,  the  text  included  under  Section  5.1  as  well  as  the  comparisons  in  terms  of  cortical 
suppression under Section 4.2 should be removed. 
Conclusions 
-  Consideration of FF 100 mcg once daily as “a low  dose” is not supported and Section 4.2 should be 
maintained as previously proposed with some minor changes.  
-  New information included in Section 5.1 is not accepted since it is not considered to provide relevant 
information to the prescribers and data comes from a single phase I study. 
The MAH disagreed with the CHMP recommendation for minor changes to section 4.2 of the SmPC to 
reflect that the 100 mcg FF dose should not be considered as ‘low-to-mid’ but as ‘medium’ instead and 
with all the consequential PI changes (see above discussion). 
In conclusion the CHMP adopted a negative opinion for this worksharing application. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Consideration of fluticasone furoate (FF) 100 mcg once daily as a low dose is not supported; relevant 
changes to section 4.2 of the SmPC are not accepted.  
Newly proposed information in section 5.1 of the SmPC is not accepted, either, since it is not considered 
to provide relevant information to the prescribers and data comes from a single phase I study.  
The benefit-risk balance of Relvar Ellipta, Revinty Ellipta, remains positive in the approved indication.

Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC to clarify the information to prescribers on the initial dose of 
Relvar/Revinty based on the corticosteroid dose equivalence. 
 is not recommended for approval. 
This worksharing procedure leads to no amendments to the Product Information. 
Grounds for refusal: 
The proposed update to the section 4.2 of the SmPC including the reference to the fluticasone furoate 
(FF) 100 mcg once daily as “a low dose” and the addition of table with recommended dose of 
Relvar/Revinty Ellipta for patients uncontrolled on an inhaled corticosteroid and a short acting beta2-
agonist is not supported. 
The MAH proposal to consider FF 100 mcg once daily as a “low/mid” dose instead of a “mid dose” is not 
accepted due to the following considerations: 
The recruited population in the pivotal study HZA106827 corresponds to uncontrolled patients with low to 
mid  doses  of  CSI.  According  to  the  step-wise  approach  reflected  in  the  GINA  as  well  as  the  authorized 
indication for Relvar, FF 100 mcg OD can’t be considered as a low dose.   
New information on fluticasone furoate pharmacodynamic properties included in the section 5.1 is not 
accepted since it is not considered to provide relevant information to the prescribers and comes from a 
single phase I study (FFA103096) in which FF 100 mcg once daily and 200 mcg once daily resulted in 7% 
and 13% cortisol suppression, respectively, compared with 15% and 30% cortisol suppression for FP 250 
mcg twice daily and 500 mcg twice daily.  
Results from HZA106829 phase III study with uncontrolled patients on moderate to high doses of ICS which 
would constitute the target population of Relvar 200 mcg FF, confirmed that 24-hour, free cortisol urinalysis 
found no significant differences, with ratios to baseline of 0.91, 0.98 and 0.84 for FF 200 OD, FF/VI 200/25 
OD and FP 500 BD, respectively. Furthermore, as all subjects entered the study on moderate to high doses 
of ICS, a decrease in free cortisol versus baseline is not expected (HZA106829 study report). 
Additionally,  clinical  data  from  the  direct  comparison  between  FF/VI  100/25  OD  versus  FP/salmeterol 
250/50 BD (considered medium dose of CSI) showed similar efficacy and safety profiles.  
Consequently, FF100mcg once daily is considered to be a “mid dose” of corticosteroids.

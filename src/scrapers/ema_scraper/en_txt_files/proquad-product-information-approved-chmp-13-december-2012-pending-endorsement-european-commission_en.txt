CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
ProQuad is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella in 
individuals from 12 months of age. 
ProQuad can be administered to individuals from 9 months of age under special circumstances (e.g., 
to conform with national vaccination schedules, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with high 
prevalence of measles; see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
ProQuad should be used in accordance to official recommendations. 
 
Individuals 12 months of age and older

Individuals from 12 months of age should receive two doses of ProQuad or a single dose of 
ProQuad followed by a second dose of a monovalent varicella vaccine to ensure optimal 
protection against varicella (see section 5.1). At least one month must elapse between the first 
and second dose of any live viral attenuated vaccine. It is preferred that the second dose be 
administered within three months following the first dose. 
Individuals between 9 and 12 months of age 
Immunogenicity and safety data show that ProQuad can be administered to individuals between 
9 and 12 months of age, under special circumstances (e.g., in accordance with official 
recommendations or when early protection is considered necessary). In such cases, individuals 
should receive a second dose of ProQuad, given a minimum of 3 months apart, to ensure 
optimal protection against measles and varicella (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
Individuals less than 9 months of age 
ProQuad is not indicated in this subset of the paediatric population. The safety and efficacy of 
ProQuad in children under 9 months of age have not been established.  
 
 
ProQuad may be used as the second dose in individuals who have previously received measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine. 
Method of administration 
The vaccine is to be injected by the subcutaneous route in the deltoid region of the upper arm or in the 
higher anterolateral area of the thigh. 
Precautions to be taken before manipulating or administering the product: see section 6.6. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
DO NOT INJECT INTRAVASCULARLY. 
4.3  Contraindications 
History of hypersensitivity to any varicella vaccine or measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine, to any of 
the excipients, or to neomycin, which may be present as trace residues (see sections 2, 4.4 and 6.1). 
Blood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the 
haematopoietic and lymphatic system. 
Current immunosuppressive therapy (including high doses of corticosteroids). ProQuad is not 
contraindicated in individuals who are receiving topical or low-dose parenteral corticosteroids (e.g. 
for asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy). 
Severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g., severe combined 
immunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia and AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection or an age-specific 
CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage in children below 12 months: CD4+ <25%, children between 12-35 
months: CD4+ < 20%; children between 36-59 months: CD4+ < 15% (see section 4.4).  
In severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing 
vaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence 
of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported. 
Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the 
potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.

Active untreated tuberculosis. Children under treatment for tuberculosis have not experienced 
exacerbation of the disease when immunized with live measles virus vaccine. No studies have been 
reported to date on the effect of measles virus vaccines on children with untreated tuberculosis. 
Vaccination should be postponed during any illness with fever >38.5C. 
Pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see  
section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare 
anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. 
Additionally, live measles vaccine and live mumps vaccine are produced in chick embryo cell culture. 
Persons with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e.g. hives, 
swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg 
ingestion may be at an enhanced risk of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions. The potential risk-
to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases. 
Due caution should be employed in the administration of ProQuad to persons with individual or 
family history of convulsions, or a history of cerebral injury. The physician should be alert to the 
temperature elevation that may occur following vaccination (see section 4.8). 
Individuals less than 12 months of age who are vaccinated with a measles-containing vaccine during 
measles outbreaks or for other reasons may fail to respond to the vaccine due to the presence of 
circulating antibodies of maternal origin and/or immaturity of the immune system (see sections 4.2 
and 5.1). 
This vaccine contains 16 mg of sorbitol as an excipient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
fructose intolerance should not take this vaccine. 
Vaccine recipients should avoid use of salicylates for 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad as 
Reye's syndrome has been reported following the use of salicylates during wild-type varicella 
infection. 
Vaccination with ProQuad may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients. 
Transmission 
Excretion of small amounts of the live attenuated rubella virus from the nose or throat has occurred in 
the majority of susceptible individuals 7 to 28 days after vaccination. There is no confirmed evidence 
to indicate that such virus is transmitted to susceptible persons who are in contact with the vaccinated 
individuals. Consequently, transmission through close personal contact, while accepted as a 
theoretical possibility, is not regarded as a significant risk; however, transmission of the rubella 
vaccine virus to infants via breast milk has been documented without any evidence of clinical disease 
(see section 4.6). 
There are no reports of transmission of the more attenuated Enders’ Edmonston strain of measles virus 
or the Jeryl Lynn™ strain of mumps virus from vaccine recipients to susceptible contacts. 
Post-licensing experience with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) suggests that transmission of 
varicella vaccine virus may rarely occur between healthy vaccine recipients (who develop or do not 
develop a varicella-like rash) and contacts susceptible to varicella, as well as high-risk individuals 
susceptible to varicella (see section 4.8). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
High-risk individuals susceptible to varicella include: 
• 
• 
• 
immunocompromised individuals (see section 4.3), 
pregnant women without documented positive history of varicella (chickenpox) or laboratory 
evidence of prior infection, 
newborn infants of mothers without documented positive history of varicella or laboratory 
evidence of prior infection. 
Vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid, whenever possible, close association with high-risk 
individuals susceptible to varicella for up to 6 weeks following vaccination. In circumstances where 
contact with high-risk individuals susceptible to varicella is unavoidable, the potential risk of 
transmission of the varicella vaccine virus should be weighed against the risk of acquiring and 
transmitting wild-type varicella virus. 
Thrombocytopenia 
In clinical trials, no cases were reported regarding the development or worsening of thrombocytopenia 
in individuals vaccinated with ProQuad. Cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported in post-
marketing experience after primary vaccination with ProQuad. In addition, cases of thrombocytopenia 
have been reported after primary vaccination or revaccination with measles vaccine; measles, mumps, 
and rubella vaccine; and varicella vaccine. Post-marketing experience with live measles, mumps, and 
rubella vaccine indicates that individuals with current thrombocytopenia may develop more severe 
thrombocytopenia following vaccination. In addition, individuals who experienced thrombocytopenia 
following the first dose of a live measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine may develop thrombocytopenia 
with repeat doses. Serologic status may be evaluated to determine whether or not additional doses of 
vaccine are needed. The risk-to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering 
vaccination with ProQuad in such cases (see section 4.8). 
Febrile seizures 
In the 5- to 12-day timeframe after the administration of the first dose of quadrivalent measles, 
mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines in children, an increased risk of febrile seizure was observed 
compared to concomitant administration of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines (see 
sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Other 
Vaccination may be considered in patients with selected immune deficiencies where the benefits 
outweigh the risks (asymptomatic HIV patients, IgG subclass deficiencies, congenital neutropenia, 
chronic granulomatous disease, and complement deficiency diseases). 
Immunocompromised patients who have no contraindication for this vaccination (see section 4.3) may 
not respond as well as immunocompetent patients; therefore, some of these patients may acquire 
measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella in case of contact, despite appropriate vaccine administration. 
These patients should be monitored carefully for signs of measles, parotitis, rubella, and varicella. 
Post-exposure prophylaxis 
No clinical data are available for ProQuad administered after exposure to measles, mumps, rubella, or 
varicella. However, post-exposure prophylaxis for varicella and measles has been demonstrated with 
Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles-containing vaccines manufactured by Merck & 
Co., Inc., respectively. 
Interference with laboratory tests: see section 4.5. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
At least 1 month should elapse between receipt of a live virus vaccine and ProQuad. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vaccine recipients should avoid use of salicylates for 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad (see 
section 4.4). 
Do not give immunoglobulin (IG) or Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG) concomitantly with 
ProQuad. 
Administration of immune globulins concomitantly with ProQuad may interfere with the expected 
immune response. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 3 months following blood or plasma 
transfusions, or administration of immune globulins (IG). However, the appropriate suggested interval 
between transfusion or IG administration and vaccination will vary with the type of transfusion or 
indication for, and dose of, IG (e.g. 5 months for VZIG). 
Administration of varicella zoster virus antibody-containing blood products, including VZIG or other 
immune globulin preparations, within 1 month following a dose of ProQuad may reduce the immune 
response to the vaccine and hence reduce its protective efficacy. Therefore, administration of any of 
these products should be avoided within 1 month after a dose of ProQuad unless considered to be 
essential. 
It has been reported that live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccines given individually 
may result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to 
be done, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or at least 4 to 6 weeks 
after immunization with ProQuad. 
Concomitant use with other vaccines: 
Clinical studies have demonstrated that ProQuad can be given simultaneously (but at separate 
injection sites) with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine, or with monovalent or combination vaccines 
comprised of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated 
poliomyelitis, or hepatitis B antigen. In these clinical studies, it was demonstrated that the immune 
responses were unaffected. The safety profiles of the administered vaccines were comparable (see 
section 4.8). 
There are insufficient data to support the use of ProQuad with any other vaccines. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Pregnant women should not be vaccinated with ProQuad. 
Studies have not been conducted with ProQuad in pregnant women. It is not known whether ProQuad 
can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or affect reproduction capacity. 
Pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination. Women who intend to become 
pregnant should be advised to delay. 
Breast-feeding 
Studies have shown that breast-feeding postpartum women vaccinated with live attenuated rubella 
vaccine may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast-fed infants. In the infants with 
serological evidence of rubella infection, none had symptomatic disease. There is no evidence that 
varicella vaccine virus is excreted in breast milk. It is not known whether measles or mumps vaccine 
virus is secreted in human milk. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering whether to 
administer ProQuad to a breast-feeding woman. 
Fertility 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ProQuad. ProQuad has not been evaluated 
for potential to impair fertility.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive or use machinery have been performed. ProQuad is 
expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
a. Summary of the safety profile 
In 5 clinical trials, ProQuad was administered without concomitant vaccines to 6038 children 12 
through 23 months of age. The children in these studies received either the current refrigerator-stable 
formulation or an earlier formulation of ProQuad. Children in these studies were monitored for six 
weeks post vaccination. The safety profiles were comparable for the two different formulations after a 
single dose. The only vaccine-related systemic adverse reactions reported at a significantly greater 
rate in individuals who received the earlier formulation of ProQuad compared to individuals who 
received the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. and Varicella 
Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) were fever (≥39.4°C rectal equivalent or abnormal) and measles-like rash. 
Both fever and measles-like rash usually occurred within 5 to 12 days following the vaccination, were 
of short duration and resolved with no long-term sequelae. Pain/tenderness/soreness at the injection 
site was reported at a statistically lower rate in individuals who received ProQuad. 
The only vaccine related injection-site adverse reaction that was more frequent among recipients of 
ProQuad than among recipients of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and 
rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co. Inc. was rash at the injection site. 
Following ProQuad given alone in 7 clinical trials, the observed rates of fever (≥39.4°C rectal 
equivalent) ranged from 10.1% to 39.4%. In comparison, following ProQuad given concomitantly 
with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine in 3 clinical trials, the observed rates of reported fever 
(≥39.4°C rectal equivalent) ranged from 15.2% to 27.2%.  
In a clinical trial of ProQuad administered concomitantly with Infanrix Hexa, the rates of fever 
(≥38.0°C rectal equivalent) were 69.3% following concomitant administration, 61.1% following 
ProQuad alone, and 57.3% following Infanrix Hexa alone; the rates of fever (≥39.4°C rectal 
equivalent) were 22.6% following concomitant administration, 20.5% following ProQuad alone, and 
15.9% following Infanrix Hexa alone. 
The overall safety profile of ProQuad was comparable whether it was administered concomitantly or 
alone. 
Children who received a second dose of ProQuad 
In eight clinical studies, the overall rates of adverse reactions after a second dose of ProQuad were 
generally similar to, or lower than, those seen with the first dose. In three of these studies, the rates of 
injection-site erythema and swelling were statistically significantly higher after the second dose than 
after the first dose; however, in the remaining five studies, the rates of each of these reactions were 
similar after the first and second dose. The fever rate in all eight studies was lower after the second 
dose than after the first dose. 
Children who received ProQuad at 4 through 6 years of age after primary immunization with 
Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by 
Merck & Co., Inc. 
The rates and types of adverse reactions seen in the study group that received ProQuad were generally 
similar to those seen in the groups that received Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. (see section 5.1 for study 
description). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No specific studies have been conducted in individuals from 2 years of age who had not previously 
received measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines. 
The most common adverse events reported with the use of ProQuad were: injection-site reactions 
including pain/tenderness/soreness, redness, swelling or bruising; fever (≥39.4°C rectal equivalent); 
irritability; rash (including measles-like rash, varicella-like rash, and injection-site rash); upper 
respiratory infection; vomiting and diarrhoea. 
b. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions were reported as vaccine related by the investigator in individuals 
after a single dose of ProQuad. Several adverse events were solicited in the clinical studies and are 
designated with the symbol (‡). Additionally, other adverse experiences have been reported with post-
marketing use of ProQuad and/or in clinical studies and post-marketing use of either the measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., the monovalent component vaccines 
of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., or Varicella Vaccine 
live (Oka/Merck). These adverse effects are listed below without regard to causality or frequency 
(frequency not known).

* See section c 
c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
Aseptic meningitis 
Cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported following measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination. 
Although a causal relationship between other strains of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis has 
been shown, there is no evidence to link Jeryl Lynn™ mumps vaccine to aseptic meningitis. 
Febrile seizures 
Febrile seizures have been reported in children receiving ProQuad. Consistent with clinical study data 
on the timing of fever and measles-like rash, a post-marketing observational study in children 12 to 60 
months of age revealed an approximate two-fold increase (0.70 per 1000 vs. 0.32 per 1000 children) 
in the risk of febrile seizures in the 5- to 12-day timeframe after a first dose of ProQuad (N=31,298) 
compared with concomitant administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured 
by Merck & Co., Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) (N=31,298).These data suggest 
one additional case of febrile seizure per 2600 children vaccinated with ProQuad compared with 
separate administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., 
Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck). These data were confirmed by a post marketing 
observational study sponsored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the 30-day 
timeframe following vaccination, no increased risk of febrile seizures was observed (see section 5.1).  
Encephalitis and encephalopathy 
Encephalitis and encephalopathy (excluding subacute sclerosing panencephalitis [SSPE]) have been 
reported approximately once for every 3 million doses of the measles-containing vaccines 
manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. Post-marketing surveillance of the more than 428 million doses 
that have been distributed worldwide (1978 to 2005) indicates that serious adverse events such as 
encephalitis and encephalopathy continue to be rarely reported. In no case has it been shown 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conclusively that reactions were actually caused by the vaccine; however, the data suggest the 
possibility that some of these cases may have been caused by measles vaccines. 
SSPE 
There is no evidence that measles vaccine can cause SSPE. There have been reports of SSPE in 
children who did not have a history of infection with wild-type measles but did receive measles 
vaccine. Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or 
possibly from the measles vaccination. The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted 
by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the overall effect of measles vaccine 
has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its inherent risk of SSPE.  
Arthralgia and/or arthritis 
Arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of 
infection with wild-type rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and gender, being 
greatest in adult females and least in prepubertal children. Following vaccination in children, 
reactions in joints are generally uncommon (0 to 3%) and of brief duration. In women, incidence rates 
for arthritis and arthralgia are generally higher than those seen in children (12 to 20%), and the 
reactions tend to be more marked and of longer duration. Symptoms may persist for a matter of 
months or on rare occasions for years. In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in 
incidence between those seen in children and adult women. Even in older women (35 to 45 years), 
these reactions are generally well tolerated and rarely interfere with normal activities. 
Chronic arthritis 
Chronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to 
persistent virus and/or viral antigen isolated from body tissues. Only rarely have vaccine recipients 
developed chronic joint symptoms. 
Cases of herpes zoster in clinical studies 
In a clinical trial, 2 cases of herpes zoster were reported in 2108 healthy subjects 12 through 
23 months of age who were vaccinated with one dose of ProQuad and followed for 1 year. Both cases 
were unremarkable and no sequelae were reported.  
Active surveillance data in children vaccinated with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and 
followed for 14 years after vaccination showed no increase in the frequency of herpes zoster 
compared to children with prior wild-type varicella during the pre-vaccine era. These surveillance 
data actually suggest that varicella-vaccinated children may have a lower risk of herpes zoster. 
However, the long term effect of varicella vaccination on the incidence of herpes zoster is unknown at 
present. There are no long-term data currently available with ProQuad (see section 5.1). 
Transmission 
Based on isolated case reports from post-marketing surveillance for Varicella Vaccine live 
(Oka/Merck), the possibility exists that varicella vaccine virus may rarely be transmitted to contacts

Efficacy 
Formal studies to evaluate the efficacy of ProQuad have not been performed. However, the efficacy 
of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by 
Merck & Co., Inc. has been demonstrated in numerous studies.  
Efficacy of the measles, mumps, and rubella components of ProQuad was previously established in a 
series of double-blind controlled field trials with the monovalent vaccines manufactured by Merck & 
Co., Inc., which demonstrated a high degree of protective efficacy. In these studies seroconversion in 
response to vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella paralleled protection from these 
diseases. ProQuad elicits rates of antibody responses against measles, mumps, and rubella similar to 
those observed after vaccination with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by 
Merck & Co., Inc. 
More than 518 million doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & 
Co., Inc. have been distributed worldwide (1978 to 2007). Widespread use of a 2-dose vaccination 
schedule in the United States and countries such as Finland and Sweden has led to a >99% reduction 
in the incidence of each of the 3 targeted diseases.  
In combined clinical trials of a single dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) in healthy children, 
the protective efficacy of the vaccine against all severities of varicella disease ranged from 81% to 
100%. In a large case-control study, the vaccine was estimated to be 85% effective against all forms 
of varicella and 97% effective against moderately severe and severe disease.  
In a study comparing 1 dose (N=1114) to 2 doses (N=1102) of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck), 
the estimated vaccine efficacy against all severities of varicella disease for the 10-year observation 
period was 94% for 1 dose and 98% for 2 doses (p<0.001). Over the 10-year observation period, the 
cumulative rate of varicella was 7.5% after 1 dose and 2.2% after 2 doses. Most cases of varicella 
reported in recipients of 1 dose or 2 doses of vaccine were mild. 
Antibody responses against varicella virus ≥5 gpELISA Units/ml in the glycoprotein enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (gpELISA, a highly sensitive assay which is not commercially available) have 
been shown to be highly correlated with long-term protection. Clinical studies have shown that 
immunization with ProQuad elicits rates of antibody responses against varicella virus ≥5 gpELISA 
Units/ml similar to those observed after vaccination with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck).  
Immunogenicity  
Immunogenicity was studied in children 12 through 23 months of age with a negative clinical history 
of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella who participated in 5 randomized clinical trials. The 
immunogenicity of the current refrigerator-stable formulation was shown to be similar to the 
immunogenicity of the earlier formulation of ProQuad six weeks after a single dose of the vaccine. 
The immunogenicity of a single dose of an earlier formulation of ProQuad was comparable to the 
immunogenicity of a single dose of its individual component vaccines (Varicella Vaccine live 
(Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.), 
currently used in routine vaccination in some countries. 
Clinical trials involving 6987 subjects who received ProQuad demonstrated detectable immune 
responses to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in a high proportion of individuals. The presence 
of detectable antibody was assessed by an appropriately sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) for measles, mumps (wild-type and vaccine-type strains), and rubella, and by gpELISA 
for varicella. Following a single dose of ProQuad, the vaccine response rates were 97.7% for measles, 
96.3% to 98.8% for mumps, and 98.8% for rubella. While the seroconversion rate for varicella was 
uniformly high (97.9% to 99.8% across all studies), seroconversion has not been shown to correlate 
well with protection. The vaccine response rate was 90.9% (range 80.8% to 94.5%) for varicella 
based on a post-vaccination antibody titer ≥5 gpELISA units/ml (an antibody titer that has been 
shown to be highly correlated with long-term protection). These results were similar to the immune 
response rates induced by concomitant administration of a single dose of Varicella Vaccine live 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. at 
separate injection sites. 
Evaluation of immunogenicity in children from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose 
A clinical study was conducted with ProQuad administered with a 2-dose schedule, the doses being 
given 3 months apart in 1,620 healthy subjects from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose. 
The safety profile post-dose 1 and 2 was generally comparable for all age cohorts. 
In the Full Analysis Set (vaccinated subjects regardless of their antibody titre at baseline), high 
seroprotection rates of >99% were elicited to mumps, rubella, and varicella post-dose 2, regardless of 
the age of the vaccinees at the first dose. After 2 doses, the seroprotection rates against measles were 
98.1% when the first dose was given at 11 months, compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given 
at 12 months (non-inferiority study objective met). After two doses, the seroprotection rates against 
measles were 94.6% when the first dose was given at 9 months, compared to 98.9% when the first 
dose was given at 12 months (non-inferiority study objective not met).  
The seroprotection rates to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella 6 weeks post-dose 1 and 6 weeks 
post-dose 2, for the Full Analysis Set are given in the following table.

The post-dose 2 geometric mean titres (GMTs) against mumps, rubella, and varicella were 
comparable across all age categories, while the GMTs against measles were lower in subjects who 
received the first dose at 9 months of age as compared to subjects who received the first dose at 11 or 
12 months of age. 
Children who received a second dose of ProQuad 
In 2 clinical trials, 1035 subjects were administered a second dose of ProQuad approximately 3 
months after the first dose. The vaccine response rates were 99.4% for measles, 99.9% for mumps, 
98.3% for rubella, and 99.4% for varicella (≥5 gpELISA Units/ml). The geometric mean titers 
(GMTs) following the second dose of ProQuad increased approximately 2 fold each for measles, 
mumps, and rubella, and approximately 41 fold for varicella (for safety information, see section 4.8).

Children who received ProQuad at 4 through 6 years of age after primary vaccination with Varicella 
Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & 
Co., Inc. 
The immunogenicity and safety of ProQuad were evaluated in a clinical trial involving 799 subjects 4 
through 6 years of age who had received Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. at least 1 month prior to study entry. 
Following the dose of ProQuad, GMTs for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella were similar to 
those following a second dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and 
rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. administered concomitantly at separate injection 
sites. Additionally, GMTs for measles, mumps, and rubella were similar to those following a second 
dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. given 
concomitantly with placebo (for safety information, see section 4.8). 
Persistence of Immune Response 
The persistence of antibody at 1 year after vaccination was evaluated in a subset of 2108 subjects who 
were involved in 1 clinical trial. The antibody persistence rates 1 year postvaccination in recipients of 
a single dose of ProQuad were 98.9% (1722/1741) for measles, 96.7% (1676/1733) for mumps, 
99.6% (1796/1804) for rubella, and 97.5% (1512/1550) for varicella (≥5 gpELISA Units/ml). 
Experience with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. 
demonstrates that antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses are still detectable in most 
individuals 11 to 13 years after primary vaccination. In clinical studies involving healthy subjects 
who received 1 dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck), detectable varicella antibodies were 
present in most individuals tested for up to 10 years postvaccination. 
Observational studies of long-term effectiveness of varicella vaccine 
Surveillance data from two U.S. observational effectiveness studies confirmed that widespread 
varicella vaccination reduces the risk of varicella by approximately 90% and that protection is 
maintained over at least 15 years both in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. These data also 
suggest that varicella vaccination may reduce the risk of herpes zoster in vaccinated individuals. 
In the first study, a long-term prospective cohort study, approximately 7,600 children vaccinated in 
1995 with varicella vaccine in their second year of life were actively followed for 14 years in order to 
estimate the occurrence of varicella and herpes zoster. Over the entire follow-up, the incidence of 
varicella was approximately 10-fold lower among vaccinees than among children of the same age in 
the pre-vaccine era (estimated vaccine effectiveness over the study period was between 73% and 
90%). Regarding herpes zoster, there were fewer herpes zoster cases among varicella vaccinees 
during the follow-up period than expected from rates in children of the same age with prior wild-type 
varicella during the pre-vaccine era (relative risk = 0.61, 95% CI 0.43 - 0.89). Breakthrough varicella 
and zoster cases were usually mild. 
In a second long-term surveillance study, five cross-sectional surveys on varicella incidence, each 
from a random sample of approximately 8,000 children and adolescents 5 to 19 years of age, were 
conducted over 15 years, from 1995 (pre-vaccine) through 2009. Results showed a gradual decline of 
varicella rates by an overall 90% to 95% (approximately 10- to 20-fold) from 1995 to 2009 in all age 
groups, both in vaccinated and unvaccinated children and adolescents. In addition, a decrease by 
approximately 90% (approximately 10-fold) in varicella hospitalization rates was observed in all age 
groups. 
Post-Marketing Observational Safety Surveillance Study 
Safety was evaluated in an observational study that included 69,237 children vaccinated with 
ProQuad 12 months to 12 years old and 69,237 matched children in a historical comparison group 
who were vaccinated concomitantly with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by 
Merck & Co., Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck). In addition to assessing the incidence 
of febrile seizures occurring within 30 days after the first dose (see section 4.8), the study also 
assessed the general safety of ProQuad in the 30-day period after the first or second dose. Other than 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the increase in febrile seizure after the first dose, no safety concerns after the first or second dose 
were identified. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Evaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Traditional non-clinical studies were not performed, but there are no non-clinical concerns considered 
relevant to clinical safety beyond data included in other sections of the SPC.

(chlorobutyl rubber) in a pack size of 1 and 10. 
Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
To reconstitute the vaccine, use only the solvent supplied, because it is free of preservatives or other 
antiviral substances, which might inactivate the vaccine. ProQuad, when reconstituted, is clear pale 
yellow to light pink liquid. 
It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each individual to prevent transmission 
of infectious agents from one individual to another. 
ProQuad must not be mixed in a syringe with other vaccines. 
Reconstitution instructions 
Withdraw the entire volume of solvent into a syringe. Inject the entire content of the syringe into the 
vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to dissolve completely. Withdraw the entire content of the 
reconstituted vaccine from the vial into the same syringe and inject the entire volume. 
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution, to 
minimize loss of potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes. 
The reconstituted vaccine must not be used if any particulate matter is noted or if the appearance of 
the vaccine differs from that described above. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
ProQuad is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in 
individuals from 12 months of age. 
ProQuad can be administered to individuals from 9 months of age under special circumstances (e.g., 
to conform with national vaccination schedules, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with high 
prevalence of measles; see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
ProQuad should be used in accordance to official recommendations.

18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Individuals from 12 months of age should receive two doses of ProQuad or a single dose of 
ProQuad followed by a second dose of a monovalent varicella vaccine to ensure optimal 
protection against varicella (see section 5.1). At least one month must elapse between the first 
and second dose of any live viral attenuated vaccine. It is preferred that the second dose be 
administered within three months following the first dose. 
 
 
Individuals between 9 and 12 months of age 
Immunogenicity and safety data show that ProQuad can be administered to individuals between 
9 and 12 months of age, under special circumstances (e.g., in accordance with official 
recommendations or when early protection is considered necessary). In such cases, individuals 
should receive a second dose of ProQuad, given a minimum of 3 months apart, to ensure 
optimal protection against measles and varicella (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).   
Individuals less than 9 months of age 
ProQuad is not indicated in this subset of the paediatric population. The safety and efficacy of 
ProQuad in children under 9 months of age have not been established.  
ProQuad may be used as the second dose in individuals who have previously received measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine. 
Method of administration 
The vaccine is to be injected by the subcutaneous route in the deltoid region of the upper arm or in the 
higher anterolateral area of the thigh. 
Precautions to be taken before manipulating or administering the product: see section 6.6. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
DO NOT INJECT INTRAVASCULARLY. 
4.3  Contraindications 
History of hypersensitivity to any varicella vaccine or measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine, to any of 
the excipients, or to neomycin, which may be present as trace residues (see sections 2, 4.4 and 6.1). 
Blood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the 
haematopoietic and lymphatic system. 
Current immunosuppressive therapy (including high doses of corticosteroids). ProQuad is not 
contraindicated in individuals who are receiving topical or low-dose parenteral corticosteroids (e.g. 
for asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy). 
Severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g., severe combined 
immunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia and AIDS, or symptomatic HIV infection or an age-specific 
CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage in children below 12 months: CD4+  <25% %; children between 12-
35 months: CD4+ < 20%; children between 36-59 months: CD4+ < 15% (see section 4.4).  
In severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing 
vaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence 
of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported. 
Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the 
potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Active untreated tuberculosis. Children under treatment for tuberculosis have not experienced 
exacerbation of the disease when immunized with live measles virus vaccine. No studies have been 
reported to date on the effect of measles virus vaccines on children with untreated tuberculosis. 
Vaccination should be postponed during any illness with fever >38.5C.  
Pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see  
section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare 
anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. 
Additionally, live measles vaccine and live mumps vaccine are produced in chick embryo cell culture. 
Persons with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e.g. hives, 
swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg 
ingestion may be at an enhanced risk of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions. The potential risk-
to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases. 
Due caution should be employed in the administration of ProQuad to persons with individual or 
family history of convulsions, or a history of cerebral injury. The physician should be alert to the 
temperature elevation that may occur following vaccination (see section 4.8). 
Individuals less than 12 months of age who are vaccinated with a measles-containing vaccine during 
measles outbreaks or for other reasons may fail to respond to the vaccine due to the presence of 
circulating antibodies of maternal origin and/or immaturity of the immune system (see sections 4.2 
and 5.1). 
This vaccine contains 16 mg of sorbitol as an excipient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
fructose intolerance should not take this vaccine. 
Vaccine recipients should avoid use of salicylates for 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad as 
Reye's syndrome has been reported following the use of salicylates during wild-type varicella 
infection. 
Vaccination with ProQuad may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients. 
Transmission 
Excretion of small amounts of the live attenuated rubella virus from the nose or throat has occurred in 
the majority of susceptible individuals 7 to 28 days after vaccination. There is no confirmed evidence 
to indicate that such virus is transmitted to susceptible persons who are in contact with the vaccinated 
individuals. Consequently, transmission through close personal contact, while accepted as a 
theoretical possibility, is not regarded as a significant risk; however, transmission of the rubella 
vaccine virus to infants via breast milk has been documented without any evidence of clinical disease 
(see section 4.6). 
There are no reports of transmission of the more attenuated Enders’ Edmonston strain of measles virus 
or the Jeryl Lynn™ strain of mumps virus from vaccine recipients to susceptible contacts. 
Post-licensing experience with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) suggests that transmission of 
varicella vaccine virus may rarely occur between healthy vaccine recipients (who develop or do not 
develop a varicella-like rash) and contacts susceptible to varicella, as well as high-risk individuals 
susceptible to varicella (see section 4.8).  
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
High-risk individuals susceptible to varicella include: 
• 
• 
• 
immunocompromised individuals (see section 4.3), 
pregnant women without documented positive history of varicella (chickenpox) or laboratory 
evidence of prior infection, 
newborn infants of mothers without documented positive history of varicella or laboratory 
evidence of prior infection. 
Vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid, whenever possible, close association with high-risk 
individuals susceptible to varicella for up to 6 weeks following vaccination. In circumstances where 
contact with high-risk individuals susceptible to varicella is unavoidable, the potential risk of 
transmission of the varicella vaccine virus should be weighed against the risk of acquiring and 
transmitting wild-type varicella virus. 
Thrombocytopenia 
In clinical trials, no cases were reported regarding the development or worsening of thrombocytopenia 
in individuals vaccinated with ProQuad. Cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported in post-
marketing experience after primary vaccination with ProQuad. In addition, cases of thrombocytopenia 
have been reported after primary vaccination or revaccination with measles vaccine; measles, mumps, 
and rubella vaccine; and varicella vaccine. Post-marketing experience with live measles, mumps, and 
rubella vaccine indicates that individuals with current thrombocytopenia may develop more severe 
thrombocytopenia following vaccination. In addition, individuals who experienced thrombocytopenia 
following the first dose of a live measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine may develop thrombocytopenia 
with repeat doses. Serologic status may be evaluated to determine whether or not additional doses of 
vaccine are needed. The risk-to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering 
vaccination with ProQuad in such cases (see section 4.8). 
Febrile seizures 
In the 5- to 12-day timeframe after the administration of the first dose of quadrivalent measles, 
mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines in children, an increased risk of febrile seizure was observed 
compared to concomitant administration of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines (see 
sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Other 
Vaccination may be considered in patients with selected immune deficiencies where the benefits 
outweigh the risks (asymptomatic HIV patients, IgG subclass deficiencies, congenital neutropenia, 
chronic granulomatous disease, and complement deficiency diseases). 
Immunocompromised patients who have no contraindication for this vaccination (see section 4.3) may 
not respond as well as immunocompetent patients; therefore, some of these patients may acquire 
measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella in case of contact, despite appropriate vaccine administration. 
These patients should be monitored carefully for signs of measles, parotitis, rubella, and varicella. 
Post-exposure prophylaxis 
No clinical data are available for ProQuad administered after exposure to measles, mumps, rubella, or 
varicella. However, post-exposure prophylaxis for varicella and measles has been demonstrated with 
Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles-containing vaccines manufactured by Merck & 
Co., Inc., respectively.  
Interference with laboratory tests: see section 4.5. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
At least 1 month should elapse between receipt of a live virus vaccine and ProQuad.  
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vaccine recipients should avoid use of salicylates for 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad (see 
section 4.4). 
Do not give immunoglobulin (IG) or Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG) concomitantly with 
ProQuad.  
Administration of immune globulins concomitantly with ProQuad may interfere with the expected 
immune response. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 3 months following blood or plasma 
transfusions, or administration of immune globulins (IG). However, the appropriate suggested interval 
between transfusion or IG administration and vaccination will vary with the type of transfusion or 
indication for, and dose of, IG (e.g. 5 months for VZIG). 
Administration of varicella zoster virus antibody-containing blood products, including VZIG or other 
immune globulin preparations, within 1 month following a dose of ProQuad may reduce the immune 
response to the vaccine and hence reduce its protective efficacy. Therefore, administration of any of 
these products should be avoided within 1 month after a dose of ProQuad unless considered to be 
essential. 
It has been reported that live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccines given individually 
may result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to 
be done, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or at least 4 to 6 weeks 
after immunization with ProQuad. 
Concomitant use with other vaccines: 
Clinical studies have demonstrated that ProQuad can be given simultaneously (but at separate 
injection sites) with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine, or with monovalent or combination vaccines 
comprised of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated 
poliomyelitis, or hepatitis B antigen.  In these clinical studies, it was demonstrated that the immune 
responses were unaffected. The safety profiles of the administered vaccines were comparable (see 
section 4.8).  
There are insufficient data to support the use of ProQuad with any other vaccines. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Pregnant women should not be vaccinated with ProQuad. 
Studies have not been conducted with ProQuad in pregnant women. It is not known whether ProQuad 
can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or affect reproduction capacity.  
Pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination. Women who intend to become 
pregnant should be advised to delay. 
Breast-feeding 
Studies have shown that breast-feeding postpartum women vaccinated with live attenuated rubella 
vaccine may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast-fed infants. In the infants with 
serological evidence of rubella infection, none had symptomatic disease. There is no evidence that 
varicella vaccine virus is excreted in breast milk. It is not known whether measles or mumps vaccine 
virus is secreted in human milk. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering whether to 
administer ProQuad to a breast-feeding woman.  
Fertility 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ProQuad. ProQuad has not been evaluated 
for potential to impair fertility.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive or use machinery have been performed. ProQuad is 
expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
a. Summary of the safety profile 
In 5 clinical trials, ProQuad was administered without concomitant vaccines to 6038 children 12 
through 23 months of age. The children in these studies received either the current refrigerator-stable 
formulation or an earlier formulation of ProQuad. Children in these studies were monitored for six 
weeks post vaccination. The safety profiles were comparable for the two different formulations after a 
single dose. The only vaccine-related systemic adverse reactions reported at a significantly greater 
rate in individuals who received the earlier formulation of ProQuad compared to individuals who 
received the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. and Varicella 
Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) were fever (≥39.4°C rectal equivalent or abnormal) and measles-like rash. 
Both fever and measles-like rash usually occurred within 5 to 12 days following the vaccination, were 
of short duration and resolved with no long-term sequelae. Pain/tenderness/soreness at the injection 
site was reported at a statistically lower rate in individuals who received ProQuad. 
The only vaccine related injection-site adverse reaction that was more frequent among recipients of 
ProQuad than among recipients of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and 
rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co. Inc. was rash at the injection site. 
Following ProQuad given alone in 7 clinical trials, the observed rates of fever (≥39.4°C rectal 
equivalent) ranged from 10.1% to 39.4%. In comparison, following ProQuad given concomitantly 
with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine in 3 clinical trials, the observed rates of reported fever 
(≥39.4°C rectal equivalent) ranged from 15.2% to 27.2%. 
In a clinical trial of ProQuad administered concomitantly with Infanrix Hexa, the rates of fever 
(≥38.0°C rectal equivalent) were 69.3% following concomitant administration, 61.1% following 
ProQuad alone, and 57.3% following Infanrix Hexa alone; the rates of fever (≥39.4°C rectal 
equivalent) were 22.6% following concomitant administration, 20.5% following ProQuad alone, and 
15.9% following Infanrix Hexa alone. 
The overall safety profile of ProQuad was comparable whether it was administered concomitantly or 
alone. 
Children who received a second dose of ProQuad  
In eight clinical studies, the overall rates of adverse reactions after a second dose of ProQuad were 
generally similar to, or lower than, those seen with the first dose. In three of these studies, the rates of 
injection-site erythema and swelling were statistically significantly higher after the second dose than 
after the first dose; however, in the remaining five studies, the rates of each of these reactions were 
similar after the first and second dose. The fever rate in all eight studies was lower after the second 
dose than after the first dose. 
Children who received ProQuad at 4 through 6 years of age after primary immunization with Varicella 
Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & 
Co., Inc. 
The rates and types of adverse reactions seen in the study group that received ProQuad were generally 
similar to those seen in the groups that received Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. (see section 5.1 for study 
description).  
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No specific studies have been conducted in individuals from 2 years of age who had not previously 
received measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines.  
The most common adverse events reported with the use of ProQuad were: injection-site reactions 
including pain/tenderness/soreness, redness, swelling or bruising; fever (≥39.4°C rectal equivalent); 
irritability; rash (including measles-like rash, varicella-like rash, and injection-site rash); upper 
respiratory infection; vomiting and diarrhoea. 
b. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions  
The following adverse reactions were reported as vaccine related by the investigator in individuals 
after a single dose of ProQuad. Several adverse events were solicited in the clinical studies and are 
designated with the symbol (‡). Additionally, other adverse experiences have been reported with post-
marketing use of ProQuad and/or in clinical studies and post-marketing use of either the measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., the monovalent component vaccines 
of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., or Varicella Vaccine 
live (Oka/Merck). These adverse effects are listed below without regard to causality or frequency

* See section c 
c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
Aseptic meningitis 
Cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported following measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination. 
Although a causal relationship between other strains of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis has 
been shown, there is no evidence to link Jeryl Lynn™ mumps vaccine to aseptic meningitis. 
Febrile seizures 
Febrile seizures have been reported in children receiving ProQuad. Consistent with clinical study data 
on the timing of fever and measles-like rash, a post-marketing observational study in children 12 to 60 
months of age revealed an approximate two-fold increase (0.70 per 1000 vs. 0.32 per 1000 children) 
in the risk of febrile seizures in the 5- to 12-day timeframe after a first dose of ProQuad (N=31,298) 
compared with concomitant administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured 
by Merck & Co., Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) (N=31,298). These data suggest 
one additional case of febrile seizure per 2600 children vaccinated with ProQuad compared with 
separate administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., 
Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck). These data were confirmed by a post marketing 
observational study sponsored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
In the 30-day timeframe following vaccination, no increased risk of febrile seizures was observed (see 
section 5.1). 
Encephalitis and encephalopathy 
Encephalitis and encephalopathy (excluding subacute sclerosing panencephalitis [SSPE]) have been 
reported approximately once for every 3 million doses of the measles-containing vaccines 
manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. Post-marketing surveillance of the more than 428 million doses 
that have been distributed worldwide (1978 to 2005) indicates that serious adverse events such as 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
encephalitis and encephalopathy continue to be rarely reported. In no case has it been shown 
conclusively that reactions were actually caused by the vaccine; however, the data suggest the 
possibility that some of these cases may have been caused by measles vaccines.  
SSPE 
There is no evidence that measles vaccine can cause SSPE. There have been reports of SSPE in 
children who did not have a history of infection with wild-type measles but did receive measles 
vaccine. Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or 
possibly from the measles vaccination. The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted 
by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the overall effect of measles vaccine 
has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its inherent risk of SSPE.  
Arthralgia and/or arthritis 
Arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of 
infection with wild-type rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and gender, being 
greatest in adult females and least in prepubertal children. Following vaccination in children, 
reactions in joints are generally uncommon (0 to 3%) and of brief duration. In women, incidence rates 
for arthritis and arthralgia are generally higher than those seen in children (12 to 20%), and the 
reactions tend to be more marked and of longer duration. Symptoms may persist for a matter of 
months or on rare occasions for years. In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in 
incidence between those seen in children and adult women. Even in older women (35 to 45 years), 
these reactions are generally well tolerated and rarely interfere with normal activities. 
Chronic arthritis 
Chronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to 
persistent virus and/or viral antigen isolated from body tissues. Only rarely have vaccine recipients 
developed chronic joint symptoms. 
Cases of herpes zoster in clinical studies 
In a clinical trial, 2 cases of herpes zoster were reported in 2108 healthy subjects 12 through 23 
months of age who were vaccinated with one dose of ProQuad and followed for 1 year. Both cases 
were unremarkable and no sequelae were reported.  
Active surveillance data in children vaccinated with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and 
followed for 14 years after vaccination showed no increase in the frequency of herpes zoster 
compared to children with prior wild-type varicella during the pre-vaccine era. These surveillance 
data actually suggest that varicella-vaccinated children may have a lower risk of herpes zoster. 
However, the long term effect of varicella vaccination on the incidence of herpes zoster is unknown at 
present. There are no long-term data currently available with ProQuad (see section 5.1). 
Transmission 
Based on isolated case reports from post-marketing surveillance for Varicella Vaccine live 
(Oka/Merck), the possibility exists that varicella vaccine virus may rarely be transmitted to contacts 
of recipients of ProQuad who develop or do not develop a varicella-like rash (see section 4.4).  
4.9  Overdose 
No case of overdose has been reported.

Efficacy 
Formal studies to evaluate the efficacy of ProQuad have not been performed. However, the efficacy 
of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by 
Merck & Co., Inc. has been demonstrated in numerous studies.  
Efficacy of the measles, mumps, and rubella components of ProQuad was previously established in a 
series of double-blind controlled field trials with the monovalent vaccines manufactured by Merck & 
Co., Inc., which demonstrated a high degree of protective efficacy. In these studies seroconversion in 
response to vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella paralleled protection from these 
diseases. ProQuad elicits rates of antibody responses against measles, mumps, and rubella similar to 
those observed after vaccination with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by 
Merck & Co., Inc. 
More than 518 million doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & 
Co., Inc. have been distributed worldwide (1978 to 2007). Widespread use of a 2-dose vaccination 
schedule in the United States and countries such as Finland and Sweden has led to a >99% reduction 
in the incidence of each of the 3 targeted diseases.  
In combined clinical trials of a single dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) in healthy children, 
the protective efficacy of the vaccine against all severities of varicella disease ranged from 81% to 
100%. In a large case-control study, the vaccine was estimated to be 85% effective against all forms 
of varicella and 97% effective against moderately severe and severe disease.  
In a study comparing 1 dose (N=1114) to 2 doses (N=1102) of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck), 
the estimated vaccine efficacy against all severities of varicella disease for the 10-year observation 
period was 94% for 1 dose and 98% for 2 doses (p<0.001). Over the 10-year observation period, the 
cumulative rate of varicella was 7.5% after 1 dose and 2.2% after 2 doses. Most cases of varicella 
reported in recipients of 1 dose or 2 doses of vaccine were mild. 
Antibody responses against varicella virus ≥5 gpELISA Units/ml in the glycoprotein enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (gpELISA, a highly sensitive assay which is not commercially available) have 
been shown to be highly correlated with long-term protection. Clinical studies have shown that 
immunization with ProQuad elicits rates of antibody responses against varicella virus ≥5 gpELISA 
Units/ml similar to those observed after vaccination with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck).  
Immunogenicity  
Immunogenicity was studied in children 12 through 23 months of age with a negative clinical history 
of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella who participated in 5 randomized clinical trials. The 
immunogenicity of the current refrigerator-stable formulation was shown to be similar to the 
immunogenicity of the earlier formulation of ProQuad six weeks after a single dose of the vaccine. 
The immunogenicity of a single dose of an earlier formulation of ProQuad was comparable to the 
immunogenicity of a single dose of its individual component vaccines (Varicella Vaccine live 
(Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.), 
currently used in routine vaccination in some countries. 
Clinical trials involving 6987 subjects who received ProQuad demonstrated detectable immune 
responses to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in a high proportion of individuals. The presence 
of detectable antibody was assessed by an appropriately sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) for measles, mumps (wild-type and vaccine-type strains), and rubella, and by gpELISA 
for varicella. Following a single dose of ProQuad, the vaccine response rates were 97.7% for measles, 
96.3% to 98.8% for mumps, and 98.8% for rubella. While the seroconversion rate for varicella was 
uniformly high (97.9% to 99.8% across all studies), seroconversion has not been shown to correlate 
well with protection. The vaccine response rate was 90.9% (range 80.8% to 94.5%) for varicella 
based on a postvaccination antibody titer ≥5 gpELISA units/ml (an antibody titer that has been shown 
to be highly correlated with long-term protection). These results were similar to the immune response 
rates induced by concomitant administration of a single dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. at separate injection 
sites. 
Evaluation of immunogenicity in children from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose 
A clinical study was conducted with ProQuad administered with a 2-dose schedule, the doses being 
given 3 months apart in 1,620 healthy subjects from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose. 
The safety profile post-dose 1 and 2 was generally comparable for all age cohorts. 
In the Full Analysis Set (vaccinated subjects regardless of their antibody titre at baseline), high 
seroprotection rates of >99% were elicited to mumps, rubella, and varicella post-dose 2, regardless of 
the age of the vaccinees at the first dose. After 2 doses, the seroprotection rates against measles were 
98.1% when the first dose was given at 11 months, compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given 
at 12 months (non-inferiority study objective met). After two doses, the seroprotection rates against 
measles were 94.6% when the first dose was given at 9 months, compared to 98.9% when the first 
dose was given at 12 months (non-inferiority study objective not met).  
The seroprotection rates to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella 6 weeks post-dose 1 and 6 weeks 
post-dose 2, for the Full Analysis Set are given in the following table.

The post-dose 2 geometric mean titres (GMTs) against mumps, rubella, and varicella were 
comparable across all age categories, while the GMTs against measles were lower in subjects who 
received the first dose at 9 months of age as compared to subjects who received the first dose at 11 or 
12 months of age. 
Children who received a second dose of ProQuad 
In 2 clinical trials, 1035 subjects were administered a second dose of ProQuad approximately 3 
months after the first dose. The vaccine response rates were 99.4% for measles, 99.9% for mumps, 
98.3% for rubella, and 99.4% for varicella (≥5 gpELISA Units/ml). The geometric mean titers 
(GMTs) following the second dose of ProQuad increased approximately 2 fold each for measles, 
mumps, and rubella, and approximately 41 fold for varicella (for safety information, see section 4.8).

Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & 
Co., Inc. 
The immunogenicity and safety of ProQuad were evaluated in a clinical trial involving 799 subjects 4 
through 6 years of age who had received Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. at least 1 month prior to study entry. 
Following the dose of ProQuad, GMTs for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella were similar to 
those following a second dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and 
rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. administered concomitantly at separate injection 
sites. Additionally, GMTs for measles, mumps, and rubella were similar to those following a second 
dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. given 
concomitantly with placebo (for safety information, see section 4.8). 
Persistence of Immune Response 
The persistence of antibody at 1 year after vaccination was evaluated in a subset of 2108 subjects who 
were involved in 1 clinical trial. The antibody persistence rates 1 year postvaccination in recipients of 
a single dose of ProQuad were 98.9% (1722/1741) for measles, 96.7% (1676/1733) for mumps, 
99.6% (1796/1804) for rubella, and 97.5% (1512/1550) for varicella (≥5 gpELISA Units/ml). 
Experience with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. 
demonstrates that antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses are still detectable in most 
individuals 11 to 13 years after primary vaccination. In clinical studies involving healthy subjects 
who received 1 dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck), detectable varicella antibodies were 
present in most individuals tested for up to 10 years postvaccination.  
Observational studies of long-term effectiveness of varicella vaccine 
Surveillance data from two U.S. observational effectiveness studies confirmed that widespread 
varicella vaccination reduces the risk of varicella by approximately 90% and that protection is 
maintained over at least 15 years both in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. These data also 
suggest that varicella vaccination may reduce the risk of herpes zoster in vaccinated individuals. 
In the first study, a long-term prospective cohort study, approximately 7,600 children vaccinated in 
1995 with varicella vaccine in their second year of life were actively followed for 14 years in order to 
estimate the occurrence of varicella and herpes zoster. Over the entire follow-up, the incidence of 
varicella was approximately 10-fold lower among vaccinees than among children of the same age in 
the pre-vaccine era (estimated vaccine effectiveness over the study period was between 73% and 
90%). Regarding herpes zoster, there were fewer herpes zoster cases among varicella vaccinees 
during the follow-up period than expected from rates in children of the same age with prior wild-type 
varicella during the pre-vaccine era (relative risk = 0.61, 95% CI 0.43 - 0.89). Breakthrough varicella 
and zoster cases were usually mild. 
In a second long-term surveillance study, five cross-sectional surveys on varicella incidence, each 
from a random sample of approximately 8,000 children and adolescents 5 to 19 years of age, were 
conducted over 15 years, from 1995 (pre-vaccine) through 2009. Results showed a gradual decline of 
varicella rates by an overall 90% to 95% (approximately 10- to 20-fold) from 1995 to 2009 in all age 
groups, both in vaccinated and unvaccinated children and adolescents. In addition, a decrease by 
approximately 90% (approximately 10-fold) in varicella hospitalization rates was observed in all age 
groups. 
Post-Marketing Observational Safety Surveillance Study 
Safety was evaluated in an observational study that included 69,237 children vaccinated with 
ProQuad 12 months to 12 years old and 69,237 matched children in a historical comparison group 
who were vaccinated concomitantly with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by 
Merck & Co., Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck). In addition to assessing the incidence 
of febrile seizures occurring within 30 days after the first dose (see section 4.8), the study also 
assessed the general safety of ProQuad in the 30-day period after the first or second dose. Other than 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the increase in febrile seizure after the first dose, no safety concerns after the first or second dose 
were identified. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Evaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Traditional non-clinical studies were not performed, but there are no non-clinical concerns considered 
relevant to clinical safety beyond data included in other sections of the SPC.

Powder in a vial (glass) with a stopper (butyl rubber) and solvent in a pre-filled syringe (glass) with 
plunger stopper (chlorobutyl rubber) and tip cap (styrene-butadiene rubber), with one or two 
unattached needles, in a pack size of 1, 10 and 20. 
Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
To reconstitute the vaccine, use only the solvent supplied, because it is free of preservatives or other 
antiviral substances, which might inactivate the vaccine. ProQuad, when reconstituted, is clear pale 
yellow to light pink liquid. 
It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each individual to prevent transmission 
of infectious agents from one individual to another. 
ProQuad must not be mixed in a syringe with other vaccines. 
Reconstitution instructions 
Inject the entire content of the syringe into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to dissolve 
completely. Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into the same 
syringe and inject the entire volume.  
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution, to 
minimize loss of potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes. 
The reconstituted vaccine must not be used if any particulate matter is noted or if the appearance of 
the vaccine differs from that described above.  
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What ProQuad is and what it is used for  
ProQuad is a vaccine containing measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) viruses that 
have been weakened. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural 
defences) will make antibodies against the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses. The 
antibodies help protect against diseases caused by these viruses. 
ProQuad is given to help protect your child against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella 
(chickenpox). The vaccine may be administered to persons from 12 months of age. 
ProQuad may also be administered to infants from 9 months of age under special circumstances (to 
conform  with  national  vaccination  schedules,  outbreak  situations,  or  travel  to  a  region  with  high 
prevalence of measles). 
Although ProQuad contains live viruses, they are too weak to cause measles, mumps, rubella, or 
varicella (chickenpox) in healthy people. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive ProQuad 
Do not use ProQuad 
 
 
 
 
 
If the person to be vaccinated is allergic to any of the components of this vaccine (including 
neomycin or any of the other ingredients listed in section 6). 
If the person to be vaccinated has a blood disorder or any type of cancer that affects the 
immune system. 
If the person to be vaccinated is receiving treatment or taking medications that may weaken the 
immune system (except low-dose corticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy). 
If the person to be vaccinated has a weakened immune system because of a disease (including 
AIDS). 
If the person to be vaccinated has a family history of congenital or hereditary 
immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of this person is demonstrated. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the person to be vaccinated has active untreated tuberculosis. 
If the person to be vaccinated has any illness with fever higher than 38.5°C; however, low-
grade fever itself is not a reason to delay vaccination. 
If the person to be vaccinated is pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 
month after vaccination, see Pregnancy and breast-feeding). 
Warnings and precautions 
If the person to be vaccinated has experienced any of the following, talk to the doctor or pharmacist 
before ProQuad is given: 
 
 
 
 
an allergic reaction to eggs or anything that contained egg. 
a history or family history of allergies or of convulsions (fits). 
a side effect after vaccination with measles, mumps, or rubella (in a single vaccine or combined 
vaccine, such as the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. 
or ProQuad) that involved easy bruising or bleeding for longer than usual. 
an infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) without showing symptoms of HIV 
disease. However, vaccination may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see Do not 
use ProQuad). 
Once vaccinated, the person vaccinated should attempt to avoid for up to 6 weeks following 
vaccination, whenever possible, close association with the following individuals:  
 
 
 
Individuals with a lowered resistance to diseases. 
Pregnant women who have either not had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated against 
chickenpox. 
Newborn infants of mothers who have either not had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated 
against chickenpox. 
Tell your doctor if there is anyone who falls into one of the categories above and is expected to be in 
contact with the person vaccinated after vaccination. 
As with other vaccines, ProQuad may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated. Also, if 
the person to be vaccinated has already been exposed to the measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella 
virus but is not yet ill, ProQuad may not be able to prevent the illness from appearing. 
Other medicines and ProQuad 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking or have recently taken any other 
medicines (or other vaccines). 
ProQuad can be given at the same time as other childhood vaccines such as Prevenar, and/or hepatitis 
A vaccine, or with vaccines containing diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus 
influenzae type b, inactivated poliomyelitis, or hepatitis B. A different place for the injection will be 
used for each vaccine. 
The doctor may delay vaccination for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or 
administration of immune globulin (IG), or varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG). After 
vaccination with ProQuad, IG or VZIG should not be given for 1 month, unless your doctor tells you 
otherwise.  
If a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should be done either any time before, simultaneously with, 
or 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell the doctor if your child has recently received a vaccine or if one is scheduled to be given in the 
near future. The doctor will determine when ProQuad may be given.  
The use of salicylates (for example, acetylsalicylic acid, a substance present in many medicines used 
to relieve pain and lower fever) should be avoided for 6 weeks following vaccination with ProQuad. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
ProQuad should not be given to pregnant females. Females of child-bearing age should take the 
necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month following vaccination. 
Persons who are breast-feeding or who intend to breast-feed should tell the doctor. The doctor will 
decide if ProQuad should be given. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this vaccine. 
ProQuad contains sorbitol. 
If you have been told by your doctor that you or your child has an intolerance to some sugars, inform 
your doctor before you or your child takes this vaccine. 
3. 
How to use ProQuad 
ProQuad should be injected under the skin in the upper arm or in the outer thigh.

Reconstitution instructions 
Before mixing with the solvent, the powder vaccine is a white to pale yellow compact crystalline 
cake. When completely mixed, the vaccine is a clear pale yellow to light pink liquid. 
Withdraw the entire volume of solvent into a syringe. Inject the entire content of the syringe into the 
vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to dissolve completely. Withdraw the entire content of the 
reconstituted vaccine from the vial into the same syringe and inject the entire volume. 
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution to minimize loss 
of potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes. 
Do not use the reconstituted vaccine if you notice any particulate matter or if the appearance of the 
vaccine differs from that described above. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

1.  What ProQuad is and what it is used for 
ProQuad is a vaccine containing measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) viruses that 
have been weakened. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural 
defences) will make antibodies against the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses. The 
antibodies help protect against diseases caused by these viruses. 
ProQuad is given to help protect your child against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella 
(chickenpox). The vaccine may be administered to persons from 12 months of age. 
ProQuad may also be administered to infants from 9 months of age under special circumstances (to 
conform  with  national  vaccination  schedules,  outbreak  situations,  or  travel  to  a  region  with  high 
prevalence of measles). 
Although ProQuad contains live viruses, they are too weak to cause measles, mumps, rubella, or 
varicella (chickenpox) in healthy people.

Reconstitution instructions 
Before mixing with the solvent, the powder vaccine is a white to pale yellow compact crystalline 
cake. When completely mixed, the vaccine is a clear pale yellow to light pink liquid. 
Inject the entire content of the syringe into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to dissolve 
completely. Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into the same 
syringe and inject the entire volume. 
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution to minimize loss 
of potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes. 
Do not use the reconstituted vaccine if you notice any particulate matter or if the appearance of the 
vaccine differs from that described above. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

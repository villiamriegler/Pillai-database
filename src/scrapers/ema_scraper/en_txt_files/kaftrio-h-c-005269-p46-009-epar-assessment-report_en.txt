1.  Introduction 
On January 13th 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Kaftrio in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Kaftrio is currently indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
(CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Kaftrio initially obtained a marketing authorisation 
in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with 
a minimal function (MF) mutation in 2020. In 2021, the indication was extended to patients aged 12 
years and older who are homozygous for patients who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Recently, the indication was extended to 
children with CF aged 6 years through 11.  
Elexacaftor and tezacaftor are CFTR correctors and facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of 
F508del-CFTR, leading to an increase in the amount of CFTR protein, while ivacaftor increases channel 
gating of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The combined effect of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and 
ivacaftor results in increased CFTR activity as measured by CFTR chloride transport. 
Within this procedure, the MAH submitted the final study results of Study VX20-445-126 (Study 126). 
This was a Phase 3b, open-label study designed to evaluate additional endpoints related to quality of 
life beyond those evaluated in the pivotal studies (i.e., cough, daily activity, and sleep quality) using 
wearable technology in CF patients aged 12 years and older.  
The MAH stated that Study VX20-445-126 (Study 126) is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
In Study VX20-445-126, the study drug was administered orally as 2 ELX 100 mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 
mg tablets in the morning and 1 tablet of IVA 150 mg in the evening. This pharmaceutical formulation 
and posology are authorised for patients aged 6 and older, weighing 30 kg or more and thereby also 
for the study population aged 12 years and older.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report(s) for: Study VX20-445-126 (Study 126), a Phase 3b Open-label 
Study Evaluating the Effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA on Cough and Physical Activity in CF Subjects 12 Years of 
Age and Older Who Are Heterozygous for the F508del Mutation and a Minimal Function Mutation 
(F/MF).

Sample size 
Assuming a standard deviation of 1 for the log ratio of cough frequency post-baseline versus baseline, 
a sample size of approximately 100 subjects will provide 95% confidence intervals (which represents 
the estimation precision) as shown in Table 2 at various observed percent reductions in cough 
frequency (30%, 40%, and 50%), after accounting for 20% missing. Note: percent reduction equals 
100% × (1- ratio of cough frequency post-baseline vs. baseline). 
Table 2. 95% Confidence Intervals for Percent Reduction in Cough Frequency per day from Baseline 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, as this is an open-label single arm trial. However, subjects and their parent/legal 
guardian were not informed of their study-related spirometry, cough, activity, and sleep quality (from 
the actigraphy sensor) results during the Treatment Period. 
Statistical Methods 
Analysis sets 
All Subjects Set - all subjects who were enrolled. This analysis set was used for all individual subject 
data listings and disposition summary tables, unless otherwise specified. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS)- all enrolled subjects who carry the intended CFTR allele mutation and received 
at least 1 dose of study drug. The FAS was used in efficacy analyses. 
Safety Set - all subjects who had received at least 1 dose of study drug. The Safety Set was used for 
all safety analyses. 
Efficacy analyses 
For efficacy analyses, baseline cough was defined as the geometric mean of valid cough measurements 
before the first dose of study drug. Baseline step count, other activity endpoints, and other sleep 
endpoints measured by actigraphy were defined as the average of valid weekly interval measurements 
prior to the first dose of study drug. Baseline PSQI, ESS, and CFQ-R were defined as the Day 1 
assessment.  
The method of analysis for the primary and secondary endpoints are shown in Table 3.

Week 8 through Week 12, with an LS mean absolute change from baseline of 637.56 steps (95% CI: 
298.16, 976.96). 
Exploratory endpoints 
The absolute change from baseline in activity patterns to the average of Week 8 through Week 12, as 
measured by the actigraphy watch is summarised in Table 9. The other endpoints ‘absolute change 
from baseline in best 6-minute effort (B6ME) per day to the average of Week 8 through Week 12’ and 
‘absolute change from baseline in preferred cadence to the average of Week 8 through Week 12’ are 
shown in Table 9 as well. For most activity pattern endpoints, scores improved with ELX/TEZ/IVA 
treatment or remained more or less similar.

Safety results 
Safety was analysed in 81 patients of Study 126, who had received at least 1 dose of study drug in the 
treatment period (Safety Set). 
Exposure 
The median (min, max) exposure in the Safety Set was 12.2 weeks (5.7, 13.1; Table 13). 
Table 13. Summary of exposure (Safety Set) 
Adverse events 
Almost all patients (92.6%) experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE; Table 14). All AEs were mild or 
moderate in severity. Two patients (2.5%) had serious adverse events (SAEs), both of which were 
considered possibly related to study drug. There were no life-threatening AEs or deaths.

Common adverse events 
AEs that occurred in ≥5% of patients are summarised by preferred term (PT) in Table 15. The most 
common adverse events were headache (17.3%), COVID-19 (16%), nasopharyngitis (16%) and 
diarrhoea (13.6%).

Table 15. AEs occurring in at least 5% of patients by PT (Safety Set) 
Severity of adverse events 
All AEs were mild (58%) or moderate (34.6%) in severity. No patients had severe AEs, life-threatening 
AEs, or an AE that resulted in death. 
Relationship of adverse events 
There were 10 (12.3%) patients with related AEs and 28 (34.6%) patients with possibly related AEs. 
AEs at least possibly related to study drug were most frequently reported for system organ class (SOC) 
gastro-intestinal disorders (19.8%), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (9.9%) and skin- 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders (9.9%). 
The most common (>3%) at least possibly related AEs were diarrhoea (4.9%), rash (4.9%), headache 
(4.9%), abdominal pain (3.7%), abdominal pain upper (3.7%) and sputum increased (3.7%). 
Deaths and other serious adverse events 
There were no life-threatening AEs or deaths.  
Two patients (2.5%) had serious adverse events (SAEs; anxiety and pancreatitis), both of which were 
assessed by the investigator as moderate in severity and possibly related to study drug. The SAE of 
anxiety resulted in study drug discontinuation and the SAE was considered resolved. 
Study drug discontinuation 
There were 2 (2.5%) patients with AEs resulting in discontinuation. One patient (1.2%) discontinued 
study drug due to a SAE of anxiety, and one patient discontinued study drug (IVA only) due to AEs of 
ALT and AST increased. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Elevated transaminase events 
Three (3.7%) patients had elevated transaminase events, all of which were assessed by the 
investigator as mild or moderate in severity. One (1.2%) patient had an elevated transaminase event 
that led to study drug interruption and one (1.2%) subject had an elevated transaminase event that 
led to treatment discontinuation.

Rash events 
Seven (8.6%) patients had at least 1 of any rash event. All rash events were mild or moderate in 
severity; none were serious. Three subjects had rash events that led to treatment interruption, all of 
whom resumed study drug. There were no study drug discontinuations due to rash events. 
By sex, 3 (8.1%) female patients and 4 (9.1%) male subjects had rash events. Of the female patients 
who had rash events, all 3 (21.4%) had concomitant use of hormonal therapy. 
Clinical laboratory evaluation 
Chemistry 
Elevated transaminase events - are described above.  
Creatinine kinase (CK) –AEs of blood CK increased were reported in 1 (1.2%) patient.  
Other chemistry parameters – There were no clinically significant findings in mean value in other non-
LFT chemistry parameters. 
Vital signs 
There were no trends observed in the vital signs or ECG parameters. No patients had AEs related to 
ECG findings or relevant cardiac disorders. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Design and conduct 
With this article 46 procedure, the MAH presented the final study results of Study VX20-445-126 
(Study 126). This was a Phase 3b, open-label study designed to evaluate additional endpoints related 
to quality of life beyond those evaluated in the pivotal studies (i.e., cough, daily activity, and sleep 
quality) using wearable technology in CF patients aged 12 years and older. Study 126 is a stand-alone 
study. No changes to the current product information for ELX/TEZ/IVA have been proposed. 
The single-arm trial design and lack of definition of a minimal important clinical difference (MCID) in CF 
for the main clinical endpoints hamper the interpretation of obtained results. 
The investigated dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA is identical to the registered posology for the study population. 
Results 
Efficacy 
A total of 81 patients enrolled and received at least 1 dose of study drug, and 79 (97.5%) patients 
completed study drug treatment. The median age at baseline was 24.6 years, with 24 patients 
(29.6%) <18 years of age. At baseline, the geometric mean cough frequency per day was 241.3 
coughs per day, and the mean step count was 5278.63 steps per day. 
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 12 years of age and older with F/MF genotypes resulted in 
a 91.7% (95% CI: 89.2%, 93.6%) reduction in cough frequency from baseline to the average of Week 
8 through Week 12. This resembles a substantial reduction from approximately 24 coughs per hour to 
less than 1 per hour, which is considered clinically relevant.  
Subgroup analysis by age (i.e. adolescents 12-18 years vs. adults ≥18 years) have not been 
presented. In line with previous procedures for ELX/TEZ/IVA, it is acceptable to pool results for 
adolescents and adults and no separate analysis per age group is requested.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/95997/2023  
Page 19/20 
 
 
 
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 12 years of age and older with F/MF genotypes improved 
the secondary endpoint total step count, with an LS mean absolute change from baseline 637.56 steps 
(95% CI: 298.16, 976.96). It is acknowledged that it is uncertain whether this improvement is 
clinically relevant, as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for step count has been 
established in a chronic obstructive respiratory disease (COPD) but not, to date, in CF. The differences 
between the two populations, e.g. in mean age and concomitant diseases, do not allow for an 
interpretation of the relevance based on the validation in COPD patients.   
The other endpoints showed limited (activity patterns) or no notable changes (sleep quality endpoints) 
in the quality of life endpoints as measured by the actigraphy watch. In contrast, the patient reported 
outcomes as measured by questionnaires (sleep related questionnaire PSQI and ESS; and the vitality 
and physical functioning domains of CFQ-R) suggest some improvements with ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment. 
However, the study was not designed to draw firm conclusions based on these exploratory endpoints.  
Safety 
No new safety concerns were identified. Almost all patients (92.6%) experienced at least 1 adverse 
event (AE). All AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Two patients (2.5%) had serious adverse events 
(SAEs), both of which were considered possibly related to study drug. There were no life-threatening 
AEs or deaths The data related to AEs of special interest rash events and transaminase elevations were 
consistent with prior experience. ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well tolerated with a low rate of 
treatment discontinuations. Overall, the AEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF 
disease or with the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
Conclusion 
Based on final results of Study 126, treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA reduced the cough frequency and 
seems to increase the activity as measured by step count. The clinical relevance of most quality-of-life 
endpoints, including step count, is uncertain as no MCID was defined. No new safety concerns were 
identified. Overall, it is agreed with the Applicant that the benefit-risk of ELX/TEZ/IVA remains positive, 
and no update to the product information is deemed necessary. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The benefit-risk evaluation of Kaftrio remains positive.

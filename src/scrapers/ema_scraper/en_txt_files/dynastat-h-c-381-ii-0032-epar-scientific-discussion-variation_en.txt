SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1. 
Introduction 
Dynastat  (parecoxib)  is  a  parenteral  cyclooxygenase-2  (COX-2)  selective  inhibitor  with  the  therapeutic 
indication  ‘for the short-term treatment  of post-operative pain’. Parecoxib is the parenteral pro-drug of 
the active substance valdecoxib.  
Dynastat  is  supplied  as  20  mg  and  40  mg  powder  vials  and  solvent  solution  for  intravenous  and 
intramuscular injection. The recommended dose is 40 mg, followed every 6 to 12 hours by 20 mg or 40 
mg as required, not to exceed 80 mg/day. 
In June 2008, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied initially for an extension of indication 
for  Dynastat  to  include  the  reduction  of  opioid  use  and  patient-reported  opioid-related  adverse  effects 
when  used  in  conjunction  with  opioids.  In  addition,  the  MAH  proposed  specific  information  on  opioid 
sparing  benefits  in  sections  4.2  “Posology  and  method  of  administration”  and  5.1  “Pharmacodynamic 
properties” of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC).  
In  addition  to  the  extended  indication  on  opioid  sparing  effects  with  associated  Product  Information 
changes, the MAH also proposed changes in SPC section 4.2 related to cardiovascular and renal safety, as 
well as some amendments in the Package Leaflet (PL). 
2. 
CLINICAL EFFICACY 
Background 
The  initial EU Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) also sought approval for an opioid-sparing 
indication,  but  this  part of the proposed indication was not approved when  the Marketing Auhorisation 
(MA) was granted in 2002. Efficacy results from studies comparing treatment with parecoxib plus opioids 
versus  treatment  with  opioids  alone,  demonstrated  equivalent  or  superior  pain  relief  of  the  combined 
treatment, as well as significant opioid sparing, in 4 post-surgical settings: orthopedic hip surgery (Study 
028);  gynecologic  surgery  (Study  029);  orthopedic  knee  surgery  (Study  033);  and  Coronary  Artery 
Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery (Study 035).  
At  that  time  it  was  concluded  that  even  though  the  initially  submitted  studies  029  and  035  did  not 
unequivocally  demonstrate  opioid-sparing  effect,  studies  028  and  033  did  show  approximately  20-40% 
reduction in opioid consumption. However, the opioid-sparing effect did not appear to be associated with 
a reduction in the adverse effects of morphine, meaning that the combined use of the two drugs was not 
demonstrated to translate into symptomatic benefit for the patient.  
However,  the  following  information  was  included  (and  has  remained  unchanged)  in  section  4.5 
Interactions of the SPC: "Dynastat may be co-administered with opioid analgesics. When Dynastat was 
co-administered  with  morphine,  a  smaller  dose  (by  28-36%)  of  morphine  could  be  used  to  achieve  the 
same clinical level of analgesia."  
Since  that  time,  additional  opioid-sparing  studies  have  been  performed  in  various  surgical  models  with 
similar  results,  including  general  surgery  (Study  069),  CABG  surgery  (Study  071),  and  orthopedic 
surgery of the hip (Study 080), as well as laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Study 044) and bunionectomy 
(Study  077).  The  MAH  considers  studies  069  and  071  as  pivotal  and  study  080  as  supportive  for  this 
variation application. 
It  is  noted  that  study  069  included  treatment  groups  with  valdecoxib,  a  medicinal  product  which  is  no 
longer available on the market.

In addition to the opioid-sparing studies, further Phase III clinical pain studies have also been conducted, 
giving a total of 25 double-blind, randomised, controlled studies of the analgesic efficacy of parecoxib in 
which  a  total  8,661  patients  undergoing  a  variety  of  surgical  procedures  were  treated  with  study 
medication, including 4,943 patients randomised to receive parecoxib.

The two pivotal studies (069 and 071) include a reasonable number of patients, with the main objective to 
measure safety outcomes. Study 069 is clearly relevant for the target population of the proposed extended 
indication,  whereas  the  other  pivotal  study  071  may  have  less  relevance  as  that  study  population  only 
includes CABG-surgery patients, for whom parecoxib is contraindicated in the SPC.

Methods 
•  Study participants 
A total of 1062 patients were randomised at 113 centres in 14 countries from September 2002 - February 
2003. 
Principal inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Eligible patients were adult male or female, 18 to 80 years of age scheduled to undergo major orthopedic 
or general surgery. All patients were expected to require in-hospital analgesic treatment for postoperative 
pain for at least three  days and analgesic treatment following discharge over a 10-day period following 
surgery. Patients participating in the study were to have an American Society of Anesthesiologists I to III 
grade  for  pre-operative  health.  Female  patients  were  to  be  post-menopausal,  surgically  sterile,  or  using 
adequate contraception, not lactating, and had a negative pregnancy test at screening. 
There were 16 exclusion criteria principally specifying the absence of previous major surgery, significant 
co-morbidity  or  factors  such  as  alcohol  misuse  which  could  compromise  participation  in  the  study. 
Patients could also be removed from the study if surgery lasted more than four hours, and if they had a 
significant intra-operative or postoperative complication. 
The  CHMP  agreed  that  the  inclusion  criteria  adequately  reflected  the  group  of  patients  who  would 
normally  require  opioid  analgesia  after  general  major  surgery,  and  who  may  profit  from  multimodal 
analgesic  regimens  with  a  COX-inhibitor.  The  exclusion  criteria  were  also  considered  reasonable  and 
took into account labelled warnings and contraindications of parecoxib. 
•  Treatments 
Parenteral parecoxib or placebo were administered to the two groups as shown in table 2.

In addition to study medication, supplemental analgesia was allowed throughout the study in the form of 
morphine  with  patient-controlled  analgesia  (PCA)  or  bolus  administration  during  the  IV/IM  treatment 
period  and  codeine/acetaminophen  (paracetamol)  or  hydrocodone/acetaminophen  (paracetamol)  during 
the oral treatment period of the study. PCA was initiated at the time of randomisation. The PCA protocol 
included PCA pump on  demand (no basal infusion) at 1 mg/ml administered at 1.0 ml per dose, with a 
blockout  time  of  six  minutes.  If  bolus  morphine  was  administered  in  addition  to  PCA,  the  doses  were 
included with the total morphine calculation. 
The  dosage  complies  with  the  current  SPC.  The  valdecoxib  treatment  period  has  minor  importance  for 
this variation application, which means that this assessment will mainly address the data over the first 3 
days, which were scheduled for parecoxib.

•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Safety Endpoint: 
The primary measure to assess the safety of parecoxib sodium/valdecoxib was the first occurrence of any 
confirmed clinically relevant adverse event (CRAE) in the following categories: 
1. Cardiovascular thromboembolic CRAEs consisting of: 
o  Cardiac  events:  myocardial  infarction  (MI),  severe  myocardial  ischemia,  cardiac  arrest,  or 
sudden  cardiac  death  determined  by  autopsy  or  if,  in  the  absence  of  another  identifiable 
cause, unexpected death occurring within 60 minutes of the onset of symptoms; 
o  Cerebrovascular  events:  acute  ischemic  or  hemorrhagic  stroke,  hemorrhagic  infarction,  or 
transient ischemic attacks (TIA); and 
o  Peripheral vascular events: deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism. 
2. Renal CRAEs consisting of renal failure or severe renal dysfunction. 
3. Upper gastrointestinal (Gastroduodenal Ulcer) CRAEs consisting of perforation, bleeding, or outlet 
obstruction. 
4. Wound healing complication CRAEs consisting of infectious complications (superficial incisional 
surgical  site  infection  (SSI),  deep  incisional  SSI,  and  organ  space  SSI)  and  noninfectious  wound 
separation or dehiscence 
Secondary Endpoints: 
Safety 
Secondary measures for analysis of safety were: 
1. Adverse events 
2. Serious adverse events 
3. Clinical laboratory assessments 
4. Vital signs 
Efficacy: 
The main measures of efficacy were: 
1. Rate of supplemental analgesia consumed on Days 2 through 10. 
2.  Summed  Pain  Intensity  (SPI)  over  24  hours  (SPI  24)  beginning  on  Day  2  through  the  end  of  the 
treatment period. 
3. Patient’s and Physician’s Global Evaluation of Study Medication at time of transition from IV/IM to 
PO medication and Final Visit/Day 11. 
Other measures of efficacy were: 
1. SPI over 12 hours (SPI 12) beginning on Day 2 through the end of the treatment period. 
2. Peak Pain Intensity (PPI) on Days 2 through 10. 
The measures used to evaluate the effect of parecoxib sodium/valdecoxib on health outcomes included: 
1. Modified Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (mBPI-sf) on Days 2 through 10 
2. Opiod-related Symptom Distress Scale (OR-SDS and also referred to in accompanying documents as 
the Symptom Distress Questionnaire) on Days 2 through 10 
3. Hospital Length of Stay (LOS) 
•  Sample size 
The  sample size of 500 patients per treatment arm for this trial is based on the need to obtain multiple 
dosing  experience  with  parecoxib/valdecoxib  and  to  demonstrate safety of the drug regimen in patients 
undergoing a variety of surgical procedures. This sample size provides 95% power to observe at least one 
case  of  uncommon  adverse  events  occurring  with  an  assumed  incidence  of  1%.  This  sample  size  also 
7
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provides  at  least  80%  power  to  detect  a  doubling  of  background  (i.e.,  placebo  group) incidence rate of 
4%. Power increases if background rate increases from 4%.  
The sample size would also provide at least 95% power to detect a difference in the efficacy endpoints 
assuming treatment effects similar to those observed in previous post-surgery studies. 
The CHMP agrees that this relatively large study (compared to previous studies on co-administration with 
opioids) is considered to have a meaningful size for the investigation of opioid-related effects on safety 
and efficacy. 
•  Statistical methods 
The safety analyses were performed on all randomised patients who receive at least one dose of study 
medication. The event rates for clinically relevant adverse events (CRAE) categories were tabulated and 
the incidence compared using Fisher’s exact test. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was provided for the 
difference between treatment groups in the proportion of patients with CRAEs. The incidence of CRAEs 
was also tabulated by type of surgery and geographical region.  
The incidence of adverse events was summarised for each treatment group and compared using Fisher’s 
exact test. The incidence of adverse events by attribution, by opioid attribution, and by severity during the 
IV/IM,  PO,  and  entire  study  periods  were  summarised.  The  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  was 
summarised for each treatment group. Withdrawals due to adverse events were summarised by treatment 
group and compared using Fisher’s exact test.  
All efficacy analyses were performed on the Modified Intent-to-Treat (MITT) population – patients who 
were randomised to treatment and received at least one dose of study medication. Summary statistics (N, 
mean, and SD) were provided to summarize the rate of analgesia (mg/h) consumed on 
Days  2  through  10,  during  the  IV/IM  treatment  period,  and  during  the  PO  treatment  period  for  each 
treatment group and the rate of analgesia (mg/h) was analyzed using analysis of variance with treatment 
and country as factors.  
The CHMP was of the opinion that the statistical methods were appropriate.

The average duration of parenteral study drug treatment was about 3 days (~6 doses), which is a clinically 
relevant time of exposure taking into account the SPC warning "There is limited clinical experience with 
Dynastat treatment beyond three days". However, the study design and the pre-set outcome measures are 
planned and carried out by data and estimations for the whole 2-10 days study period. Even though data 
are provided for separate days as well as for the full study period, it is unclear to what extent the different 
day data reflect use of parecoxib 20 mg BID or valdecoxib BID. Nevertheless, even though the range of 
parecoxib  doses  were  1-12,  the  overall  average  exposure  appears  satisfactory  for  providing  useful  2(-
3) day data ( i.e. first and second postoperative day = Days 2 and 3 in this study).  
The CHMP was of the opinion that focusing post-hoc on 2-3 day period outcome measures weaken the 
study  as  a  support  of  the  proposed  extended  indication.  On  the  other  hand,  if  data  are  supportive  of 
clinically  useful  opioid-sparing 
a  10-day  post-operative  period  with 
throughout 
parecoxib/valdecoxib, such findings may strengthen the concept even for short-term use.

Rate of Supplemental Opioids 
The rate of analgesic consumption from Days 2 through 10 by treatment group 
is presented in Table 4. Data are presented as morphine equivalents. 
Table 4.  Rate of Supplemental Opioid Consumption and Total Daily Supplemental Opioid Consumption From Days 
2 through 10 for Patients in the MITT Population 
1 Parecoxib sodium/valdecoxib = parecoxib sodium 40 mg IV (Day 1) followed by parecoxib sodium 20 mg IV/IM every 12 
hours (Days 2 through 4) and then valdecoxib 
20 mg PO every 12 hours (Days 5 through 10). 
2 Analysis of variance with treatment and country as factors. 
3 Analysis of covariance with treatment, country and type of surgery as factors, and time from end of surgery to study medication 
as a covariate. 
4 Morphine reduction =100% x ( placebo rate – parecoxib sodium rate ) / placebo rate. The rates are based on LS means. 
***Significant at the 0.001 level. **Significant at the 0.01 level. *Significant at the 0.05 level. 
Note: Total supplemental analgesia morphine equivalent from all the routes of administration (PCA, bolus and oral opioids). 
Note: Daily Total (mg): rate (mg/hr) x 24 hr. 
Note: A study day is defined as the time interval between dose 1 on the current day and dose 1 on the following day. 
Note: All the statistics in each interval (day) are based on only those patients with data in the interval. 
Mean opioid requirements on the first post-operative day were reduced by 7.2 mg morphine equivalents 
by  parecoxib,  which  is  considered  as  a  clinically  relevant  difference.  On the second post-operative day 
the  corresponding  difference  between  the  two  groups  was  2.8  mg,  which  is  considered  as  a  less 
meaningful clinical effect. The data show that the overall need of supplemental opioids is greatest in the 
immediate post-operative period, which falls within the maximum recommended period of treatment with 
parecoxib (3 days).  
These  data  (large  SD-values)  demonstrate  the  well-known  wide  variation  in  post-operative  opioid 
requirements  among patients. The reduction in opioid supplements produced by parecoxib in this study 
will therefore not provide any helpful prediction regarding the potential need of opioids in the individual 
patient.

The  statistically  significant  reduction  in  mean  morphine  equivalent  consumption  was  accompanied  by 
superior pain control for the parecoxib treatment group (table 5).

The size of the SPIDs depends on how well post-operative analgesia generally was performed. In a recent 
editorial in Pain (Breivik H, Stubhaug A. Management of acute postoperative pain: Still a long way to go. 
Pain  2008;  137:  233-4),  the  reasons  for  under-managed  pain  service  post-operatively  are  discussed. 
Important  reasons  are  organizational  obstacles  and  lack  of  awareness  of  the  problem.  If  pain  is  under-
treated  (by  sub-optimal  doses  of  opioids),  the  numerical  decrease  in  pain  caused  by  an  additional 
analgesic will tend to be larger when using pain intensity scales. On the other hand, if pain is adequately 
treated  (with  a  pain  intensity  below  3  on  an  11-point  scale),  the  possible  added  effect  produced  by 
parecoxib is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. 
The SPID data above may reflect suboptimal pain treatment. The adequacy of the overall post-operative 
pain treatment in the trial, as well as the clinical relevance of the numerical differences in SPID between 
the parecoxib and the placebo group needed to be clarified. 
Therefore, in its responses to the Request for Supplementary Information, the MAH cited a study (Cepeda 
MS,  Africano  JM,  Polo  R  et  al,  2003)  which  suggests  that  a  reduction  of  approximately  20%  in  a 
numerical  pain  rating  or  visual  analogue  score  in  a  post-surgical  acute  pain  evaluation  is  clinically 
meaningful. In Study 069 the reduction (active vs. placebo) of Sum of Pain Intensity over 24 hours was 
28%  on  Day  1  and  27.8%  on  Day  2.  Similar  reductions  were  found  using  the  modified  Brief  Pain 
Inventory- short form (mBPI-sf). 
In  addition, with  regard  to the overall quality  management of pain in the  immediate post operative, the 
MAH  reassures  the  CHMP  indicating  that  the  experimental  treatments  were  administered  on  a 
background of patient controlled analgesia at all investigational sites and that this is the current state of 
the art standard. 
Modified Brief  Pain Inventory-Short Form (mBPI-sf) for Days 2 (= 1 postoperative day) through 
10 
Across each of study Days 2 through 10 significantly fewer patients in the parecoxib sodium/valdecoxib 
treatment group reported having had Any Pain in the last 24 hours compared with patients in the placebo 
treatment group.

Since well-treated post-operative pain generally is low (should be 3 or lower on a 0-10 point numerical 
scale),  any  additional  component  to  the  established  treatment  will  be  unlikely  to  provide  large 
improvements in pain scores. Nevertheless, possible due to inadequate analgesic treatment in the placebo 
group, the active treatment improved pain and interference scores as well as composite scores by about 1 
point (~30%) on average, which may be clinically significant in postoperative patients with average pain 
scores of 4.0 and worst pain score of 5.9.  
The increase by about 10%-points in the number of patients with no reported pain in the active treatment 
group (Item 1 in mBPI-sf) is considered clinically significant, but could reflect a suboptimal treatment in 
the placebo group. 
Opioid-related Symptom Distress  
The reduced opioid consumption was accompanied by a statistically significant reduction in OR-SDS 
frequency, severity, bothersomeness, and overall composite scores on first and second post-operative day 
(Days 2 and 3) in patients treated with parecoxib, compared to patients treated with placebo.  
Additionally, the clinical benefit of opioid sparing was evident in a reduction in the risk of experiencing 
CMEs (results for 3 composite CME constructs are presented in Table 7).

Parecoxib reduced the OR-SDS scores by about 30% on the first 2 post-operative days, but the numerical 
differences were only about 0.20-0.15. There were wide SDs, but the large samples lead to "impressive" 
levels of statistical significance. It is unclear to what extent the apparently modest numerical difference 
reflects a clinically meaningful difference.  
On  the  other  hand,  the  potential  clinical  benefit  of  opioid  sparing  was  more  evident  in  terms  of 
occurrence  of  CMEs,  where  the  size  of  risk  reduction  appears  clinically  relevant.  In  addition,  table  9 
shows  that  CMEs  affected  a  large  proportion  of  patients,  which  means  that  a  moderate  risk  reduction 
reflects an appreciable number of patients with less CMEs.  
General conclusion on study I93-01-02-069 
The  study  069  is  a  sizable  and  well-conducted  evaluation  of  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  parecoxib  and 
valdecoxib  following  major  surgery.  The  study  was  planned  and  carried  out  prior  to  the  removal  of

valdecoxib from the market because of its dermal toxicity. However, as valdecoxib is no longer available 
the relevance of the study to the claimed indication at times after the parenteral dosing period becomes 
difficult to interpret.  
On post-operative  days two and three there was a 36% and a 29% reduction, respectively, in morphine 
consumption and this resulted in a 28% and a 30% relative reduction in the corresponding opiate related 
symptom distress score. However, the absolute reduction in the scores were modest and the overall scores 
low,  about  one eighth of their maximum possible value. Overall the  quality of analgesia seems to have 
been better in the active treatment arm. This is not surprising as, in effect, patients in that arm received 
prophylactic analgesia compared to as needed in the placebo arm.

Methods 
•  Study participants 
A total of 1671 patients were randomised at 175 centres in 27 countries from January 2003 - January 
2004. 
Principal inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Eligible patients were adult males or females, 18 to 80 years of age scheduled to undergo elective CABG 
surgery. All patients were expected to require in-hospital analgesic treatment for postoperative pain for at 
least three full days and analgesic treatment following discharge over a 10-day period following surgery. 
Patients  participating  in  the  study  were  required  to  have  a  pre-operative  New  York  Heart  Association 
Class I to III or cardiac ejection fraction ≥35%. Patients were required to have a body mass index (BMI) 
≤40  kg/m2 and  must have  weighed   at least 55 kg. Patients were required to be treated post-operatively 
before the first dose of study medication with 75 to 325 mg aspirin and maintained on this daily dose of 
aspirin  throughout  the  study.  Female  patients  were  to  be,  post-menopausal,  surgically  sterile,  or  using 
adequate contraception, not lactating, and have a negative pregnancy test at screening. 
There  were  14  exclusion  criteria  principally  specifying  the  absence  of  previous  cardiovascular  surgery, 
significant co-morbidity or factors such  as alcohol  misuse which could compromise participation in the 
study.  There  were  15  post-operative  to  baseline  exclusion  criteria  principally  excluding  patients  with 
early post-operative complications or clinical instability.   
It  is  noted  that  this  study  includes  only  patients  with  established  cardiovascular  disease,  which 
contraindicates  treatment  with  parecoxib  as  stated  in  the  SPC.  In  fact,  it  was  a  former  similar  CABG 
study (Study 035) that particularly raised this concern for parecoxib. Even though the MAH describes this 
study as pivotal, the CHMP is of the opinion that the inclusion criteria weaken the overall relevance of 
this study for the present application.  
•  Treatments 
Parecoxib or placebo were administered to the three groups as shown in table 8. (Day 1 means the first 
post-operative day in this study). 
15
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 8.  Groups and treatments 
The  dosage  complies  with  the  current  SPC.  The  valdecoxib  treatment  period  has  minor  importance  for 
this  application,  which  means  that  this  assessment  will  mainly  address  the  data  over  the  first  3  days, 
which were scheduled for parecoxib. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary measure to assess the safety of parecoxib sodium/valdecoxib and placebo/valdecoxib was the 
combined incidence of the number of patients with at least 1 confirmed CRAE. 
Secondary Endpoints 
Safety 
1. Combined incidence of the number of patients with specific confirmed CRAEs summarised according 
to the following categories: 
1) Cardiovascular thromboembolic CRAEs consisting of: 
a. Cardiac events: MI, severe myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrest, or sudden cardiac death; 
b.  Cerebrovascular  events:  acute  ischemic  or  hemorrhagic  stroke,  hemorrhagic  infarction,  or 
TIA; and 
c.  Peripheral  vascular  events:  vascular  thrombosis  (lower  limb  deep  vein  thrombosis,  venous 
thromboses, other sites, and all peripheral arterial thromboses) or pulmonary embolism. 
2) Renal CRAEs consisting of renal failure or severe renal dysfunction. 
3) GI ulcer CRAEs consisting of perforation, bleeding, or outlet obstruction. 
4)  Wound  healing  complication  CRAEs  consisting  of  infectious  complications  (superficial   
incisional  SSI,  deep  incisional  SSI,  and  organ  space  SSI)  and  non-infectious  wound  separation 
or dehiscence. 
2.  Combined  incidence  of  the  number  of  patients  with  at  least  1  reported  CRAE  and  the  combined 
incidence of the number of patients with specific reported CRAEs summarised according to the categories 
listed above.

6. Vital signs 
Efficacy 
1. Rate of supplemental analgesia consumed on Days 1 through 10 
2. SPI of sternotomy alone and overall body pain over 8 hours (SPI 8) on Day 1 
3. SPI of sternotomy alone and overall body pain over 12 hours (SPI 12) and 24 hours (SPI 24) on Days 1 
through 10 
4. PPI of sternotomy alone and overall body pain on Days 1 through 10 
5.  Patient’s  and  Physician’s  Global  Evaluation  of  Study  Medication  at  time  of  transition  from  IV/PO 
medication and Final Visit/Early Termination 
Health Outcome Measures 
1. Modified Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form (mBPI-sf) on Days 1 through 10 
2. Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale (OR-SDS) on Days 1 through 10 
3. Time to last PCA dose 
4. Time spent to manage pain during hospitalization 
5. Time from first dose of study medication to exit from critical care unit/intensive care unit. 
6. Time from first dose of study medication to discharge from hospital. 
The CHMP noted that the sought indication change relates to points 1 and 2 in the last passage mentioned 
above (mBPI-sf and OR-SDS), and is thus addressed in this study as secondary endpoint (and secondary 
objective)  among  other  secondary  endpoints  in  this  study.  Moreover,  post-hoc  analyses  are  confined to 
Days 1-3, whereas the planned analyses were scheduled for the combined parecoxib/valdecoxib 1-10 days 
period, i.e. the same post-hoc amendment is made as for study 069. 
•  Sample size 
Based on clinical judgment and the results of a previous CABG surgery trial (parecoxib Study 035), 500 
patients  were  to  be  enrolled  in  each  treatment  group.  This  sample  size  provided  at  least  85%  power to 
detect the safety signal as observed in the previous CABG trial.  
The  CHMP  agrees  that  this  relatively  large  study  is  considered  to  have  a  satisfactory  size  for  the 
investigation of opioid-related effects on safety and efficacy. 
•  Statistical methods 
The  statistical  analyses  on  opioid-sparing  outcome  measures  in  study  071  are  similar  as  described  for 
study 069 and considered appropriate.  
Results 
Exposure to Study Medication 
The average duration of parenteral study drug treatment was about 3 days (~6 doses), which is a clinically 
relevant time of exposure taking into account the SPC warning "There is limited clinical experience with 
Dynastat  treatment  beyond  three  days".  The  dosing  schedule  was  well  performed  during  the  3  days  of 
treatment with parecoxib, leaving this period suitable for mBPI-sf and OR-SDS analyses.  
Rate of Supplemental Opioids 
The rate of analgesic consumption from Days 1 through 10 by treatment group 
is presented in Table 9. Data are presented as morphine equivalents.

Note: A study day is defined as the time interval between dose 1 on the current day and dose 1 on the following day. 
Note: All the statistics in each interval (day) are based on only those patients with data in the interval. 
Mean  opioid  requirements  on  the  first  post-operative  day  were  reduced  by  about  6.5  mg  morphine 
equivalents by parecoxib, which is considered as a potentially clinically relevant difference.  
On the second and third post-operative day the corresponding difference was about 3.5 mg and 2.5 mg, 
respectively, which is considered as a less meaningful clinical effect.  
The data show that the overall need of supplemental opioids is greatest in the immediate post-operative 
period, which falls within the maximum recommended period of treatment with parecoxib (3 days).  
Similar  to  study  069,  the  data  (large  SD-values)  demonstrate  the  well-known  wide  variation  in 
postoperative opioid requirements among patients. 
The statistically significant reduction in mean morphine equivalent consumption demonstrated above was 
accompanied by improved pain control in Study 071 for the parecoxib treatment group (see Table 10).

Similar concerns  as raised for the study 069 (see table 6 above)  pertain to the similar data produced in 
study 071. The SPIDs shown in the table above are smaller than those observed in study 069, however the 
differences may be considered clinically relevant.  
Modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form for Days 1 (= 1. postoperative day) through 10 
Across  each  of  study  Days  significantly  fewer  patients  in  the  parecoxib  sodium/valdecoxib  treatment 
group reported having had Any Pain in the last 24 hours compared with patients in the placebo/placebo 
treatment group (see figure 3).

The mBPI-sf scores for the three first post-operative days after the day of surgery are shown in table 11. 
Results from Study 071 show lower mean scores for pain and pain interference with function in both the 
parecoxib treatment group and the placebo treatment group as compared to those observed in  Study 069.  
Nonetheless,  for  all  pain  and  pain  interference  with  function  items,  statistically  significant  reductions 
were observed in the parecoxib treatment group compared to the placebo treatment group.

Since the post-operative pain was apparently well treated in these patients, any additional component to 
the established treatment will be unlikely to provide large improvements in pain scores. Accordingly, the 
numerical differences between the placebo group and the parecoxib group in table 14 have small clinical 
significance,  even  though  the  relative  improvements  are  in  the  order  of  30-40%,  and  statistical 
significances are high. 
The increase by about 10%-points in the number of patients with no reported pain in the active treatment 
group (Item 1 in mBPI-sf, figure 3) may be considered clinically significant.  
Opioid-related Symptom Distress (OR-SDS) 
The  reduced  opioid  consumption  was  accompanied  by  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  OR-SDS 
frequency,  severity,  bothersomeness,  and  overall  composite  scores  on  days  1-3  in  patients  treated  with 
parecoxib, compared to patients treated with placebo. Additionally, the clinical benefit of opioid sparing 
was evident in a reduction in the risk of experiencing CMEs (results for 3 composite CME constructs are 
presented in table 12).

Parecoxib reduced the OR-SDS scores by about 16% on the first 3 post-operative days, and the numerical 
differences were only about 0.15. There were wide SDs, but the large samples lead to "impressive" levels 
of statistical significance. It is unclear to what extent the apparently modest numerical difference reflects 
a clinically meaningful difference.  
On the other hand, the potential clinical benefit of opioid sparing was somewhat more evident in terms of 
occurrence of CMEs. The table shows that a large proportion of CABG patients experience a CME during 
the immediate post-operative period, however, such patients are not typical representatives of the general 
post-operative patient population, meaning that the results can not be fully extrapolated to post-operative 
patients in general.

Methods 
•  Study participants 
A total of 253 patients were randomised at 18 centres in 5 countries from October 2002 - January 2004. 
Principal inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Eligible  patients  were  at  least  18  years  old  and  capable of giving informed consent.  If of childbearing 
potential,  had  been  using  effective  contraception  and  would  continue  to  use  effective  contraception 
during the study period, were not lactating, and had a negative pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the 
first dose of study medication. Patients were in satisfactory health as determined by the investigator and 
were scheduled for routine total primary hip replacement surgery performed under a standardised regimen 
of spinal anesthesia, and were expected to experience moderate to severe  
post-surgical pain.  
There were 17 exclusion criteria the principal ones being an emergency hip replacement procedure, a hip 
replacement procedure further to a trauma, or a procedure expected to last longer than 4 hours. A history 
of uncontrolled chronic disease or a concurrent clinically significant illness or medical condition, which 
in  the  investigator’s  opinion,  would  contraindicate  study  participation or confound interpretation of the

results. Receipt of investigational medication within 30 days prior to administration of study medication: 
previous admission to the study. 
The CHMP agrees that the inclusion criteria adequately reflect the group of patients who would normally 
require  opioid  analgesia  after  general  major  surgery,  and  who  may  profit  from  multimodal  analgesic 
regimes with a COX-inhibitor.  
•  Treatments 
A  schematic  presentation  of  the  trial  is presented. The first dose of study medication was  administered 
immediately after the last surgical stitch. For the QID regimen each subsequent dose was administered at 
6-hour intervals until 42 hours, and for the BID regimen at 12-hour intervals at until 36 hours.

The dosage complies with the current SPC. The data for the opioid-saving results were collected on the 
two first post-operative days (i.e. Day 1 and Day 2). 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: 
The total cumulative amount of morphine administered (PCA and bolus) in the 24 hours after the end of 
surgery. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
1.  The total cumulative amount of morphine administered (PCA and bolus) in the 48 hours after surgery.  
2.  Time specific pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] and categorical scale) at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 
18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 hours after the initial dose of study medication. 
3.  Change in pain intensity (VAS and categorical scales) after log roll. 
4.  Patient global assessment of analgesic experience. 
5.  Opiate Symptom Distress Questionnaire on Days 1-2. 
6.  Modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (mBPI-sf) on Days 1-2. 
7.  Time of last Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) dose. 
23
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.  Pulse oximetry monitoring of hypoxemia (where available) 
The sought indication relates to the primary endpoint (even though the primary objective was a non-
inferiority analysis comparing parecoxib with parecoxib+propacetamol) and points 5 and 6 among the 
secondary endpoints.  
•  Sample size 
The sample size is based on the primary efficacy criteria - amount of morphine consumed within 24 hours 
-  and  on  the  primary  comparison:  non-inferiority  of  parecoxib  versus  parecoxib  +  propacetamol. 
Parecoxib  will  be considered non-inferior to  the combination  of parecoxib and propacetamol  if the one 
sided  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  difference  between  treatments  lies  within  the  margin  of  non-
inferiority.  According  to  clinical  knowledge  and  previous  studies,  the  margin  of  non-inferiority  could 
reasonably  be  fixed  at  6  mg  (standard  deviation  of  12.92  mg)  and  a  sample  size  of  59  patients  per 
treatment group is then needed to conclude non-inferiority with a power of 80%. Due to the design and 
objectives of the study, it is decided to equally balance the 3 active groups, and the placebo group will be 
in a 1:2 ratio with each active treatment group. Therefore, a total of 231 patients will be included in the 
study, 66 in each active treatment group and 33 in the placebo group, taking into account approximately 
10% patients excluded from per protocol analysis. 
The  non-inferiority  margin  of  6  mg  per  24  hours  seems  reasonable,  and  is  in  line  with  the  CHMP's 
comments  on  what  is  considered  as  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  opioid  consumption  in  studies 
069 and 071.  
•  Statistical methods 
The  cumulative  amount  of  morphine  administered  by  PCA  and  bolus  and  time  specific  pain  intensity 
(VAS) will be analyzed using a two-way ANOVA model with treatment and center as factors. 
The  individual  mBPI-sf  responses  for  worst  pain  intensity,  least  pain  intensity,  average  pain  intensity, 
current  pain  intensity,  pain  relief  and  pain  interference  scores  will  be  analyzed  using  a  general  linear 
model with treatment and center as factors. The responses for pain in the last 24 hours (yes/no) will be 
analyzed using the CMH method, controlling for center. 
The CHMP considers the statistical methods appropriate.  
Results 
•  Patient disposition 
All  randomised  253  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication  and  were  included  in  the 
modified intention to treat (MITT) cohort. 10 patients were excluded due to late institution of PCA, and 
24 patients were withdrawn before 24 hours. 203 patients comprise the Evaluable cohort. Other reasons 
for  subjects excluded from the Evaluable population are presented in Section 13, Appendix 3.3.1 [- not 
included in the submitted dossier]. 
It is unclear to what extent the evaluable cohort used in the non-inferiority analysis is a well-defined per-
protocol population, especially with regard to per-protocol exposure of study drugs.  
Rate of Supplemental Opioids 
The rates of analgesic consumption during the first postoperative day are presented in table 13.

First 24 Hours After Surgery – Evaluable Population 
a. Least square means, adjusted for center. 
b. Estimates based on comparisons of least square means. 
c. Evidence showing parecoxib is noninferior to the combination of parecoxib + propacetamol is obtained if the lower 95% CI 
bound is greater than –6. 
d. P-value is from a two-sided test of no difference between treatment groups. 
For the primary efficacy analysis – parecoxib + propacetamol vs parecoxib – the lower bound of the 95% 
confidence interval included the non-inferiority limit of –6 mg, therefore, the null hypothesis could not be 
rejected  and  the  non-inferority  of  parecoxib  40  mg  BID  to  the  combination  parecoxib  40  mg  BID  plus 
propacetamol 2 g QID was not demonstrated.  
For  the  secondary  efficacy  contrasts  at  24  hours  post  surgery,  parecoxib  showed  a  numerically  greater 
morphine reduction (38.9%) compared with propacetamol (26.8%) but this difference was not statistically 
significant  (p=0.113).  Statistically  significant  differences  (at  p<0.001)  were  observed  for  parecoxib 
versus placebo (38.9% reduction).  
The general pattern of morphine use observed after 48 hours was similar to that observed after 24 hours. 
Since  analysis  of  the  evaluable  cohort  clearly  did  not  show  non-inferiority  for  parecoxib  compared  to 
parecoxib + propacetamol, it is highly unlikely that a potentially strictly defined per-protocol population 
would have given a different result. Nevertheless, the primary study objective has minor relevance to the 
present  variation  application.  With  regard  to  the  secondary  endpoints,  parecoxib  gave  clinically 
significantly  reduced  mean  opioid-requirements  compared  to  placebo  both  during  24  h  post-surgery 
(difference 14.5 mg) and 24-48 h post-surgery (difference 13.5 mg). Again the data demonstrate a wide 
variation in postoperative opioid requirements among patients.  
Using a 100 mm VAS scale, pain intensity was measured at two time point after surgery (table 14). 
Only placebo and parecoxib data are shown.

between treatment groups, divided by the value for the placebo group.  P-values are calculated based general 
linear model with fixed effects for treatment and center (two-sided test of no difference between treatment 
groups). 
Experience of "worst pain" is lower with parecoxib compared to placebo (mean difference 2.6 points, 
which  is  considered  clinically  relevant).  Moreover,  "general  activity"  and  "walking  ability"  showed 
possibly  clinically  relevant  differences  compared  to  placebo.  Other  items  showed  small  numerical 
differences. 
Opioid-related Symptom Distress  
Treatment with the combination of parecoxib and propacetamol, compared to placebo, produced the 
greatest  reduction  in  OR-SDS  symptom  distress  with  significant  reductions  in  all  three  distress 
composite scores (frequency, severity, and bothersomeness) and in the overall composite score across 
dimensions and symptoms for both the 0-24h and the 24-48h periods. Compared to placebo, treatment

Other submitted data 
Validation reports for the modified Brief Pain Inventory short form (mBPI-sf) and the Opioid-
Related Symptom Distress Scale (OR-SDS) 
The MAH submitted validation reports of the two measurement instruments of health outcomes used 
in  the  3  above-mentioned  studies:  the  modified  Brief  Pain  Inventory  short  form  (mBPI-sf)  and  the 
Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale (OR-SDS)  
The CHMP agrees that the overall validation of the mBPI-sf is considered satisfactory with acceptable 
results for construct validity, discriminant validity and responsiveness.  
For  the  OR-SDS,  the  CHMP  agrees  that  a  satisfactory  validation  is  provided  for  composite  scores 
based on CME for symptoms in the OR-SDS. 
However,  this  validation  report  does  not  evaluate  or  discuss  the  properties  of  OR-SDS  scores,  but 
provides  a  confirmation  of  the  CME  scores  as  a  valid  tool  for  monitoring  opioid-related  symptom 
distress.  Fortunately,  the  estimated  cut-off  points  for  CMEs  were  identical  in  this  report  as  in  the 
submitted studies. The validation report does, however, question the appropriateness of including both 
severity  and  frequency  for  the  calculation  of  CME  scores  (as  done  in  the  studies);  nevertheless  the 
arguments for simplifying the definition of CME to only symptom severity should not contradict the 
validity of also including the frequency item.  
With regard to the OR-SDS scores (separate from the CME scores), there is no specific validation of 
the scale. However, such validation may not be a critical issue, since the use of OR-SDS scores may 
not  be  effective  for  providing  clinically  meaningful  differences  to  reflect  different  consumptions  of 
opioid  analgesics,  as  commented  for  studies  069,  071  and  080.  On  the  other  hand,  if  clinically 
meaningful  effects  are  claimed  for  apparently  small  differences,  the  existence  of  a  satisfactory 
validation becomes more critical.

In its responses to the Request for Supplementary Information, the MAH argues that the OR-SDS has 
been validated and cited publications from 1994 and 2004. The CHMP was however of the opinion 
that this argument is not a robust one. A brief review of the literature suggests that the publications 
cited  by  the  MAH  may  be  the  only  ones  relating  to  the  score.  However,  this  issue  on validation of 
OR-SDS can be dealt with by appropriate wording in the SPC (see section III-4 Product Information).

Figure 4. Time to event for CRAE by treatment arm
The CHMP noted the statistically significant excess of CRAEs in the two active treatment groups and 
particularly  the  time  to  event  analysis  which  suggests  a  ‘catch  up’  effect  when  the  placebo  for 
parecoxib group switches to active treatment. These safety results for Study 071 replicate those of a 
previous  study  in  CABG  trial  (Study  035)  in  which  there  was  a  higher  CRAE  and  particularly 
cerebrovascular thrombotic or ischemic rate in the active treatment group. 
•  Other safety results 
It  is  noted  that  in  study  I93-01-02-069,  the  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  toxicity  was  higher  with 
active treatment where there were 12 clinically important events compared to 2 in the placebo group. 
The  MAH  has  provided  adverse  events  data  from  26  "Parecoxib  combined  surgery  studies",  which 
adequately seem to represent the patient population most likely to receive parecoxib.

It  is  reasonable  to  believe  that  the  parecoxib  group  received  somewhat  less  post-operative  opioids, 
however, the tabulated data do not indicate any clear difference in the occurrence of adverse events 
(acknowledging the difficulty to interpret the comparison with the 80 mg TDD group). 
In  order  to  assess  the  overall  adverse  events  profile  compared  to  the  opioid-related  events  profile 
between  treatments,  the  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  provide  pooled  data  from  the  three  opioid-
sparing studies (069, 071 and 080). Such summary data will make it possible to assess if the reduction 
of opioid-related CMEs was followed by an increase in other (parecoxib-related) adverse events. 
However, the MAH makes the point that the clinical development plan for valdecoxib and parecoxib 
was  designed  and  powered  primarily  to  demonstrate  a  difference  in  between  active  and  placebo 
treatments with respect to efficacy and not to detect safety differences, which must be based on the 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
differences of investigator reporting rates. No overview or meta-analysis of the adverse events were 
provided. 
In  the  supporting  clinical  studies  patients  treated  with  morphine  and  parecoxib/valdecoxib 
experienced more frequent NSAID/COX2 adverse effects than those in the placebo arm. This is to be 
expected and will be known to prescribers of parecoxib. The relative contribution of valdecoxib and 
parecoxib to the safety profile is not evaluable and therefore it is difficult to formulate a warning or 
SPC wording on the issue. However, the CHMP was of the opinion that the risks are not such as to 
prevent the variation being approved. 
3. 
OVERALL DISCUSSION ON CLINICAL EFFICACY AND CLINICAL SAFETY 
In the three present studies - Study 069 (general surgery), Study 071 (CABG surgery), and Study 080 
(orthopedic  surgery  of  the  hip)  -  the  clinical  benefit  of  opioid  sparing  was  investigated  using  2 
instruments  (questionnaires)  to  assess  patient-reported  outcomes:  the  Opioid  Related  Symptom 
Distress  Scale  (OR-SDS)  (including  Clinically  Meaningful  Events  (CME)  in  studies  069  and  071); 
and a modified version of the Brief Pain Inventory short form (mBPI-sf). In addition, the amount of 
opioids that patients required to achieve pain control was estimated. 
Study 069 is clearly relevant for the target population of the proposed extended indication, whereas 
the  other  pivotal  study  071  may  have  less  relevance  as  that  study  population  only  includes  CABG-
surgery patients, for whom parecoxib is contraindicated in the SPC. 
The  mBPI-sf  is  quite  similar  to  the  original  BPI-sf,  e.g.  the  pain  severity  domain  is  identical.  The 
overall validation of the mBPI-sf is considered satisfactory.  
The definition of clinically meaningful events (CME) is considered useful. A satisfactory validation is 
provided for scores based on CME for symptoms in the OR-SDS. 
However,  with  regard  to  the  OR-SDS  scores  (separate  from  the  CME  scores),  there  is  no  specific 
validation  of  the  10-point  scale  despite  the  fact  that  if  clinically  meaningful  effects  are claimed for 
apparently small differences, the existence of a satisfactory validation is important.  
In its responses to the Request for Supplementary Information, the MAH argues that the OR-SDS has 
been validated and cited publications from 1994 and 2004. The CHMP was of the opinion that this 
argument is not a robust one. A brief review of the literature suggests that the publications cited by 
the MAH may be the only ones relating to the score. However, this issue on validation of OR-SDS 
can be dealt with by appropriate wording in the SPC (see section III-4 Product Information). 
In  all  three  studies,  parecoxib  produced  statistically  significant  reduction  in  opioid  consumption. 
However,  a  methodological  concern  is  which  size  of  reduction  should  be  considered  as  clinically 
meaningful. In a non-inferiority analysis of opioid consumption in study 080, the MAH used a delta 
size of 6 mg per day, which is considered reasonable. For the two pivotal studies (069 and 071), this 
means that parecoxib produced a clinically meaningful morphine reduction on the first post-operative 
day  only  (mean  7.2  mg  and  6.5  mg,  respectively).  On  the  second  post-operative  day  the  respective 
findings were 2.8 mg and 3.5 mg.  
In  its  responses  to  the  Request  for  Supplementary  Information,  the  MAH  states  that  in  Study  069 
(general surgery) the reductions of morphine is equivalent to 36% on Day 2 and 29% which are highly 
statistically significant. In the other pivotal study 071, the reductions for Days 1, 2, 3 were 40% 41%, 
51%  which  are  also  highly  significant.  The  CHMP  agrees  that  the  MAH  is  technically  correct  but 
oversimplifies the situation. The mean consumption of morphine (in mg equivalent) fell by about half 
on each successive post-operative day. Thus, while in Study 071 the sparing effect appears to increase 
with  time,  it  actually  relates  to  7.2  mg  on  Day  1,  3.9  mg  on  Day  2  and  2.7  mg  on  Day  3.  Small 
differences between the diminishing amounts exaggerate the differences between the treatment arms, 
in  this  case  to  the  apparent  benefit  of  parecoxib.    However  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that this 
issue could be resolved by appropriate wording of the SPC. 
In the supportive study 080, the primary efficacy analysis did not show non-inferiority for parecoxib 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to parecoxib + propacetamol. However, with regard to the secondary endpoints, parecoxib 
gave clinically significantly reduced mean opioid-requirements compared to placebo both during 24 h 
post-surgery (difference 14.5 mg) and 24-48 h post-surgery (difference 13.5 mg).  
For all three studies, the data (large SD-values) demonstrate the well-known wide variation in post-
operative  opioid  requirements  among  patients.  The  reduction  in  opioid  supplements  produced  by 
parecoxib  will  therefore  not  provide  any  helpful  prediction  regarding  the  need  of  opioids  in  the 
individual patient. 
Consequently,  the  CHMP  does  not  endorse  the  proposed  extended  indication  (decrease  in  opiod 
consumption)  and  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  information  about  the  demonstrated  reduction  of  dose-
dependent adverse effects following dose-reduction of opioids should be instead included in section 
5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties” of the SPC. 
The MAH agreed with this position and withdrew its request to extend the therapeutic indication. The 
remaining scope of the variation relates to the update of section 5.1 with information on the reduction 
of  dose-dependent  adverse  effects  following  dose  reduction  of  opioids  and  consequent  updates  of 
section  4.2  “Posology  and  method  of  administration”  and  4.5  “Interaction  with  other  medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction”. 
With regard to pain, the MAH proposed a claim in SPC section 5.1, that parecoxib provides additional 
pain reduction in post-operative patients when used in combination with opioids. The CHMP wanted 
further reassurance to support this claim. 
Indeed,  the  reported  SPID  data  for  studies  069  and  071  needs  clarification  with  regard  to  clinical 
relevance  of  the  reported  differences  and  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  differences  in  Pain  intensity 
(PID data) reported in study 080 is considered questionable.  
With  regard  to  the  pain  data  as  provided  with  the  mBPI-sf  ,  the  findings  in  all  three  studies  show 
numerical  improvements  with  frequently  high  statistically  significances.  However,  the  clinical 
relevance  of  the  numerical  differences  may  not  be  convincing,  and  will  apparently  depend  on  the 
quality of the general post-operative pain management at the study site.  
In order to address these CHMP concerns, the MAH cited a study (Cepeda MS, Africano JM, Polo R 
et al, 2003) which suggests that a reduction of approximately 20% in a numerical pain rating or visual 
analogue  score  in  a  post-surgical  acute  pain  evaluation  is  clinically  meaningful.  In  Study  069  the 
reduction (active vs. placebo) of Sum of Pain Intensity over 24 hours was 28% on Day 1 and 27.8% 
on Day 2. For Study 071 the equivalent figures were approximately 28% to 29% for Days 1, 2, 3. For 
Study  080  pain  reduction  at  24  hours  and  48  hours  was  judged  to  be  24%  and  38%  respectively. 
Similar reductions were found using the modified Brief Pain Inventory- short form (mBPI-sf). 
With  regard  to  the  overall  quality  management  of  pain  in  the  immediate  post  operative,  the  MAH 
reassures the CHMP indicating that the experimental treatments were administered on a background 
of  patient  controlled  analgesia  at  all  investigational  sites  and  that  this  is  the  current  state  of  the  art 
standard. 
Parecoxib reduced the OR-SDS scores by about 30% on the first 2 post-operative days in study 069, 
and by about 16% on the first 3 post-operative days in study 071, and by about 23% on the first post-
operative day in study 080. However, the numerical differences were only about 0.15-0.20 in the three 
studies,  and  it  is  unclear  to  what  extent  the  apparently  modest  numerical  difference  may  reflect  a 
clinically  meaningful  difference.  There  were  wide  SDs,  but  the  large  samples  lead  to  "impressive" 
levels of statistical significance. 
On  the  other  hand,  the  potential  clinical  benefit  of  opioid  sparing  was  more  evident  in  terms  of 
occurrence  of  CMEs  (studies  069  and  071),  where  the  size  of  risk  reduction  may  appear  clinically 
relevant. In addition, CMEs affected a large proportion of patients, which means that a moderate risk 
reduction reflects an appreciable number of patients with less CMEs.  
Inferring  from  the  CME  data,  it  appears  reasonable  to  support  the  MAH's  claim  that  the  use  of 
events.

Regarding  safety  data,  the  MAH  has  provided  adverse  events  data  from  26  "Parecoxib  combined 
surgery  studies",  which  adequately  seem  to  represent  the  patient  population  most  likely  to  receive 
parecoxib. 
It  is  reasonable  to  believe  that  the  parecoxib  groups  in  these  data  received  somewhat  less  post-
operative  opioids  compared  to  the  placebo  group,  however,  the  tabulated  data  do  not  indicate  any 
clear  difference  in  the  occurrence  of  adverse  events  (acknowledging  the  difficulty  to  interpret  the 
comparison with the 80 mg TDD group). 
In  order  to  assess  the  overall  adverse  events  profile  between  treatments,  compared  to  the  opioid-
related  events  profile,  the  MAH  should  have  provide  pooled  adverse  events  data  from  the  three 
opioid-sparing studies (069, 071 and 080). Such summary data would have made it more feasible to 
assess  if  the  reduction  of  opioid-related  CMEs  was  followed  with  an  increase  in  other  (parecoxib-
related) adverse events. Indeed, if the overall adverse events profile is not influenced by the reduction 
in  opioid-related  adverse  events,  the  true  benefit  of  the  co-administration  of  parecoxib  should  be 
questioned. 
However, the MAH makes the point that the clinical development plan for valdecoxib and parecoxib 
was  designed  and  powered  primarily  to  demonstrate  a  difference  between  active  and  placebo 
treatments with respect to efficacy and not to detect safety differences, which must be based on the 
differences of investigator reporting rates. No overview or meta-analysis of the adverse events were 
provided. 
In  the  supporting  clinical  studies  patients  treated  with  morphine  and  parecoxib/valdecoxib 
experienced more frequent NSAID/COX2 adverse effects than those in the placebo arm. This is to be 
expected and will be known to prescribers of parecoxib. The relative contribution of valdecoxib and 
parecoxib to the safety profile is not evaluable and therefore it is difficult to formulate a warning or 
SPC wording on the issue. However, the CHMP was of the opinion that the risks are not such as to 
prevent the variation being approved. 
Serious adverse events and deaths reported in the clinical studies were discussed in the recent renewal 
assessment  report.  There  were  no  data  suggesting  less  risk  associated  with  the  use  of  parecoxib 
compared to placebo.

PRODUCT INFORMATION 
The MAH provided with the initial variation application a proposed revised SPC and Package Leaflet. 
As  detailed  above  (section  III.4  –  Overall  discussion  on  clinical  aspects),  the  CHMP  does  not 
endorsed the extension of indication with the proposed information on opioid sparing effects for the 
section 4.1 “Therapeutic indications” of the SPC as it refers to secondary end-points which may more 
appropriately be considered for inclusion in section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties”.  
Accordingly, the MAH agrees not to pursue the request to extend the indication (section 4.1) but to 
update  the  section  5.1  of  the  SPC  with  information  about  the  demonstrated  reduction  of  dose-
dependent adverse effects following dose-reduction of opioids. 
The initial SPC section 4.2 “Posology and method of administration” was updated and included “An 
optimal  effect  is  achieved  when  parecoxib  is  given  prior  to  opioid  administration”.  The  CHMP 
disagrees with this statement as it is not supported by any data in the present variation application. 
This statement was consequently deleted. 
In  addition  the  MAH  also  proposed  changes  in  SPC  section  4.2  related  to  cardiovascular  and  renal 
safety  to  bring  it  into  line  with  the  parecoxib  Core  Data  Sheet:  “As  the  cardiovascular  risk  of 
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitors may increase with dose and duration of exposure, the 
shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily dose should be used. However, the relevance 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of  these  findings  for  the  short-term  use  of  parecoxib  in  the  postoperative  setting  has  not  been 
evaluated." 
The  first  part  of  the  proposed  text  is  considered  acceptable,  and  underlines  the  second  and  third 
passage  in  the  SPC  section  4.4.  However,  the  message  as  proposed  in  the  last  sentence  appears 
unclear.  As  mentioned  in  the  SPC,  the  cardiovascular  events  associated  with  COX-2  inhibitors  are 
regarded to have relevance for the prodrug parecoxib as well, and the Renewal AR (November 2006) 
concludes  that  "It  must  be  considered,  as  is  currently  signalled  in  the  SPC  through  the 
contraindication to use in CABG surgery, that parecoxib like other COX-2 inhibitors has some degree 
of  cardiotoxic  potential."  It  was  therefore  agreed  just  to  add  “As  the  cardiovascular  risk  of 
cyclooxygenase-2  (COX-2)  specific  inhibitors  may  increase  with  dose  and  duration  of 
exposure, the shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily dose should be used.” 
Following  the  CHMP  disagreement  to  extend  the  indication  with  the  reduction  of  opioid  use  and 
patient reported opioid related adverse effects when used in conjunction with opioids, section 5.1 was 
updated with the appropriate information. The initial proposed wording was amended in order to deal 
with the use of the lack of comprehensive validation for the OR-SDS, the clinical significance of the 
statistically significant reduction in opioid consumption and the lack of safety data associated with the 
use of parecoxib compared to placebo when used in conjunction with opioids. 
It  is  noted  that  the  additional  proposed  changes  in  section  4.2  for  the renal safety, with a moderate 
strengthening  of  the  wording,  are  considered  reasonable:  “Renal  Impairment:    On  the  basis  of 
pharmacokinetics,  no  dosage  adjustment  is  necessary  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  renal 
impairment  (creatinine  clearance  of  30-80  ml/min).  In  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment 
(creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) or patients who may be predisposed to fluid retention parecoxib 
should  be  initiated  at  the  lowest  recommended  dose  and  the  patient's  kidney  function  closely 
monitored (see sections 4.4 and 5.2)." 
The  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  was  updated  in  accordance  with  the  SPC  and  agreed  by  the  CHMP.  In 
addition, minor changes to the list of representatives were introduced. 
For further details on the exact adopted wording for the SPC and PL, please refer to Attachement 1 – 
SPC and Package Leaflet.

ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENT 
In addition to the clinical data supporting this variation and assessed above, the MAH submitted an 
environmental risk assessment (not previously provided for this product). 
The CHMP agrees that the sections dealing with the human pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
of valdecoxib are accurate, and that the use of valdecoxib rather than parecoxib as the ‘burden of risk’ 
is appropriate.  
The MAH has completed a series of studies which probably fulfill the technical requirements some of 
which  seem  demanding,  at  least  in  the  time  required  to  carry  them  out.  However,  the  feasibility  of 
carrying out an environmental risk evaluation for the entire EU is very doubtful; basic assumptions of 
the  environmental  exposure  such  as  market  penetration,  amount  of  waste  water  per  inhabitant  and 
dilution  factor  are  likely  to  be  very  different  between  the  south  of  Spain  and  the  west  of  Ireland. 
Consequently effects on the biosphere are likely to vary as will the amount of drug related substance 
retained in the physical environment. 
From a simple viewpoint valdecoxib is not thought to have important hormonal side effects, is not a 
designed cytotoxic substance (e.g. cyclophosphamide) and is not a product of mass use; and for those 
pollutant
reasons

However  it  is  noted  that  the  results  from  the  water  sediment  study  (OECD  308)  demonstrate 
significant  shifting  of  the drug substance to the sediment (more than 10% of the substance after 14 
days is present in sediment). 
Therefore  the  MAH  was  asked  to  provide  effects  studies  of  sediment  dwelling  organisms  (OECD 
218)  as  described  in  the  harmonised  guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal 
products  for  human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).  Accordingly,  the  MAH  committed  to 
conducted a study to determine the effects of valdecoxib on sediment dwelling organisms a per OECD 
218 for which the final study report will be provided 3Q09 (see Letter of Undertaking in attachment 
6).

CONCLUSION AND BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT 
The  CHMP  noted  that  the  initially  proposed  extended  indication  (decrease  in  opioid  consumption) 
includes an endpoint with is one among several endpoints generally used for evaluation of analgesia. 
However  the  SPC  guideline  specifies  that  study  endpoints  should  not  normally  be  included  in  the 
therapeutic  indication  unless  such  mention  is  specified  as  being  appropriate  for  the  indication  in 
CHMP Notes for Guidance or Points to Consider documents. 
All the three submitted studies (069,071, 080), parecoxib produced statistically significant reduction 
in  opioid  consumption.  However,  a  methodological  concern  is  which  size  of  reduction  should  be 
considered  as  clinically  meaningful.  Indeed,  small  differences  between  the  diminishing  amounts 
exaggerate the differences between the treatment arms, leading in this case to the apparent benefit of 
parecoxib.  However  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  this  issue  could  be  resolved  by appropriate 
wording of the SPC. 
For all three studies, the data (large SD-values) demonstrate the well-known wide variation in post-
operative  opioid  requirements  among  patients.  The  reduction  in  opioid  supplements  produced  by 
parecoxib  will  therefore  not  provide  any  helpful  prediction  regarding  the  need  of  opioids  in  the 
individual patient. 
Therefore, the CHMP is of the opinion that the therapeutic indication should not be extended, but that 
the information about the demonstrated reduction of dose-dependent adverse effects following dose-
reduction of opioids should be instead included in section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties” of the 
SPC. 
Regarding safety data, no overview or meta-analysis of the adverse events for the three opioid-sparing 
studies  were  provided  and  it  is  not  possible  to  assess  the  overall  adverse  events  profile  between 
treatments, compared to the opioid-related events profile. 
In  the  supporting  clinical  studies  patients  treated  with  morphine  and  parecoxib/valdecoxib 
experienced more frequent NSAID/COX2 adverse effects than those in the placebo arm. This is to be 
expected  and  will  be  known  to  prescribers  of  parecoxib.  However  the  relative  contribution  of 
valdecoxib and parecoxib to the safety profile is not evaluable and therefore it is difficult to formulate 
a warning or SPC wording on the issue. However, the CHMP was of the opinion that the risks are not 
such as to prevent the variation being approved. 
Serious adverse events and deaths reported in the clinical studies were discussed in the recent renewal 
assessment  report.  There  were  no  data  suggesting  less  risk  associated  with  the  use  of  parecoxib 
compared to placebo. 
The  overall  risk-benefit  of  Dynastat  is  not  affected  by  the  newly  submitted  data  in  this  variation 
application and remains positive.

Recommendation 
On 22 January 2009 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (on  sections  4.2.  and  5.1) 
and Package Leaflet accordingly.

Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Humira 
adalimumab 
On 16 February 2012, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Humira. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Abbott Laboratories 
Ltd. They may request a re examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify the European 
Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows: 
“Ulcerative colitis 
Humira is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients 
who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-
mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical 
contraindications for such therapies.” 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
For information, the full indications for Humira will be as follows: 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Humira in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: 
 
the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the 
response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate. 
 
the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously 
treated with methotrexate. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 
within 44 days (Type II variations) and 67 days (Annex II applications) from adoption of the opinion.

Humira can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued 
treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. 
Humira has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and 
to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Humira in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years who have had an inadequate 
response to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Humira can be given as 
monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is 
inappropriate. (for the efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Humira has not been studied in 
children aged less than 4 years. 
Ankylosing spondylitis 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had 
an inadequate response to conventional therapy. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the 
response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Humira has 
been shown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in 
patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see Section 5.1) and to improve 
physical function. 
Psoriasis 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients 
who failed to respond to or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy 
including cyclosporine, methotrexate or PUVA. 
Crohn’s disease 
Humira is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn’s disease, in patients who have not 
responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an 
immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. 
Ulcerative colitis 
Humira is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients 
who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-
mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical 
contraindications for such therapies.

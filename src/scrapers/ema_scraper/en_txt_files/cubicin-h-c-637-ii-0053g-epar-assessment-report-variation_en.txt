Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibacterial derived from the fermentation of a strain of Streptomyces 
roseosporus.  It  has  strong  potency  against  major  Gram-positive  pathogens  including  those  resistant  to 
other  antibiotics.  In  the  EU/EEC,  Cubicin  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  the  following  infections  in 
adults: 
- Complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTI). 
- RIE due to Staphylococcus aureus. 
- SAB when associated with RIE or with cSSTI. 
As part of the clinical development programme, the MAH has performed a number of post-authorisation 
studies  (see  below  table),  in  the  paediatric  population  to  support  the  safety,  efficacy  and  dosing 
recommendations.

The first four studies mentioned in the above table have all been reviewed previously by the CHMP, with 
the conclusion that the efficacy in the paediatric population was acceptable and there were no additional 
safety concerns to those already known. 
Based on these studies the applicant amended their basic prescribing information to extend the indication 
"complicated  skin  and  soft-tissue  infections"  (cSSTI)  to  include  patients  from  1  to  17  years  of  age.  The 
CHMP  commented  that  a  type  2  variation  would  be  required  to  extend  the  indication  by  making 
appropriate  changes  to  the  product  literature.  In  response,  this  type  2  variation  application  has  been 
submitted. 
As  all  the  studies  have  previously  been  assessed,  truncated  summaries  about  the  relevant  paediatric 
studies are provided in this report.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics/ Pharmacodynamics 
The PKs of daptomycin was linear and dose-proportional over the range of doses studied (4 mg/kg to 10 
mg/kg). After a single dose of 4 mg/kg iv infusion for 30 or 60 minutes, the area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve (AUC) of daptomycin was lower in paediatric patients than in adults. The total 
CL/weight (wt) ranged from 10.7 to 21.5 mL/hr/kg and the volume of distribution at steady-state 
adjusted for body weight (Vss/wt) ranged from 106.3 to 136.3 mL/kg and both parameters increased 
with decrease in age. The half-life (t1/2) of daptomycin was in the range of 3.8 to 7.8 hours, which was 
shorter than in adults (7 to 9 hours). The exposures were similar after a single dose and repeated doses 
indicating that daptomycin has time invariant PKs. No significant accumulation after repeated 
administration was observed. Similar to adults, renal excretion was the major elimination pathway in 
paediatric patients. The unbound fraction was around 10% across different age groups, which was similar 
to the adult population. The percentage of unchanged drug excreted in urine in 24 hours was around 60% 
across different age groups, which was similar to the adult population. 
There was no apparent difference in PKs across different cSSSI-type (major abscess, complicated 
cellulitis, or others) patients or paediatric patients with suspected or diagnosed Gram-positive infection. 
There was no ethnicity difference on PKs observed in paediatric patients either. Studies in adult 
populations have demonstrated that because daptomycin is eliminated primarily by the kidney, an 
adjustment of Cubicin dosage interval (once every 48 hours) is recommended for patients with creatinine 
clearance < 30 mL/min, including patients receiving hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
dialysis [Cubicin Package Insert]. These studies have not been repeated in children. Population PK 
analysis indicated that in addition to body weight, systemic clearance (CL), and volume distribution of 
daptomycin was associated with maturation function in pediatric patients. After iv infusion of 5 mg/kg (12 
to 17 years), 7 mg/kg (7 to 11 years) for 30 min, and 9 mg/kg (2 to 6 years), and 10 mg/kg (1 to < 2 
years) for 60 min, the mean AUC0-tau were 387, 438, 439, and 466 μg×hr/mL, respectively. Daptomycin 
exposure that was predicted and observed in children across the age groups was similar to that seen in 
adults based on these dose recommendations and within the range of the targeted area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve at steady state (AUCss) (347 to 641 μg×hr/mL) for the treatment of cSSSI. 
2.3.3.   PK/PD modelling 
The population PK modeling and simulation report CUBI-PCS-106 ([Pharsight Consulting Services Report 
CUBI-PCS-106]) was submitted to EMA in March 2015 and assessed along with study DAP-PEDS-07-03. 
The modelling report concurred that the dose regimens used in Study DAP-PEDS-07-03 were appropriate, 
supported by the observed exposure values, simulated target attainment, and the observed high success 
rates. The optimal doses for attaining the targeted AUCss (347 to 641 μg x hr/mL) for the treatment of 
cSSSI were 5 mg/kg, 7 mg/kg infused for 30 min, and 9 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg infused for 60 minutes for 
age groups of 12 to 17, 7 to 11, 2 to 6, and 1 to < 2 years old, respectively.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
While the exposure of daptomycin in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age are similar to those 
seen in adults, it appears that younger patients (< 18 years old) clear the drug faster, therefore requiring 
a higher dose to achieve the target exposure levels (347 to 641 µg x hr/mL) that are both efficacious and 
safe to treat the infection as confirmed by the clinical outcomes from both the adult and paediatric 
patients with cSSSI. 
Results from Study DAP-PEDS-07-03 indicate that compared with adults, children show progressively 
higher (weight-adjusted) daptomycin clearance and higher volume of distribution with decreasing age. 
Hence, higher doses will be required in children and will vary by age groups in order to produce 
exposures equivalent to that seen for efficacy in adults. 
A PK modelling and simulation analysis CUBI-PCS-106 confirmed that the dose regimens used in Study 
DAP-PEDS-07-03 were appropriate, supported by the observed exposure values, simulated target 
attainment and the observed high success rates. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Higher doses will be required in children and will vary by age groups in order to produce exposures 
equivalent to that seen for efficacy in adults. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main studies (including dose-response studies) 
DAP-PEDS-05-01: An Evaluation of the Pharmacokinetics of a Single Dose of Daptomycin (4 
mg/kg) in Pediatric Patients Aged Two to Seventeen Years Who Are Concurrently Receiving 
Standard Antibiotic Therapy for Proven or Suspected Gram-Positive Infection 
This Phase 1, multicentre, single dose, open-label, non-comparative study was designed to assess the PK 
of daptomycin in paediatric patients between the ages of 2 and 17, inclusive. Patients with suspected or 
diagnosed Gram-positive infection were enrolled sequentially into 3 groups so that PK data were available 
for each age group as follows: 
Age Group 1: 12 to 17 years old, inclusive; 
Age Group 2: 7 to 11 years old, inclusive; 
Age Group 3: 2 to 6 years old, inclusive. 
The sequential enrolment of subjects into Groups 1, 2, and 3 occurred only after review of pertinent 
tolerability information, including AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and relevant laboratory 
parameters. The protocol originally required that 2 or more 2-year olds and 2 or more 3-year olds be 
enrolled; however, this stipulation was dropped as an appropriate number of 2- and 4-year olds had been 
enrolled in the study. 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the single-dose PKs of intravenous (iv) daptomycin in 
paediatric patients in 3 age groups (2 to 6 years, 7 to 11 years, and 12 to 17 years), with proven or 
suspected Gram-positive infection, and who were receiving standard  antibiotic therapy. The secondary 
objective was to describe the tolerability of a single dose of iv daptomycin in this group of patients.

An overview of daptomycin plasma PK parameters is provided below: 
Peak  (Cmax)  and  total  (AUC)  exposures  were  lower  in  Age  Groups  2  and  3  (7  to  11  and  2  to  6  years, 
respectively)  compared  to  Age  Group  1  (12  to  17  years  old).  Total  clearance  of  drug  adjusted  for  body 
weight (CL/wt) was lower in Age Group 1 compared with Age Groups 2 and 3, and elimination t1/2 was 
longer in Age Group 1 relative to the younger patient groups. 
Consistent with high protein binding in serum, the mean values of volume of distribution at steady-state 
adjusted  for  body  weight  (Vss/wt)  were  <  140  mL/kg.  Vss/wt  was  higher  in  the  youngest  age  group 
compared with the older age groups. 
In  general,  the  PK  profile  of  daptomycin  in  adolescents  12  to  17  years  of  age  determined  in  this  study 
was similar to that of healthy adults. However, in the younger age groups, drug exposure and elimination 
t1/2 were reduced compared with adolescents while body weight adjusted clearance was increased, which 
warranted  further  investigations.  The  PK  results  from  [Study  DAP-PEDS-05-01]  and  linear  PKs  of 
daptomycin suggest that AUC and Cmax from 8 to 10 mg/kg in children ages 2 to 6 years may produce 
exposure equivalent to that seen in adults at 4 mg/kg dose. 
Consequently, Study DAP-PEDS-07-02 was performed using the 8 and 10 mg/kg doses. 
DAP-PEDS-07-02: An Evaluation of the Pharmacokinetic Profile and Safety of a Single Dose of 
Daptomycin in Pediatric Subjects Aged Two to Six Years Who are Concurrently Receiving 
Standard Antibiotic Therapy for Proven or Suspected Gram-positive Infection 
This Phase 1, multicentre, single dose, open-label, non-comparative study was designed to assess the PK 
and safety of daptomycin in paediatric subjects between the ages of 2 and 6 years, inclusive. Subjects 
with suspected or diagnosed Gram-positive infection were enrolled in 2 groups as follows: 
Group 1: 8 mg/kg as a 1-hour infusion; 
Group 2: 10 mg/kg as either a 1-hour or 2-hour infusion 
The sequential enrolment of subjects into Groups 1 and 2 occurred only after review of safety and PK 
data from the previous group. The plasma sampling times were based on the known PK profile of 
daptomycin in adults and the results of the previous PK study in the paediatric population, DAP-PEDS-05-
01. No control group was required as the primary objective of this study was the assessment of PK.

An overview of daptomycin plasma PK parameters is provided below: 
The concentrations of daptomycin increased rapidly following the start of the infusion to reach an average 
maximum  concentration  of  68.4  μg/mL  following  the  8  mg/kg  dose  and  79.2  μg/mL  following  the  10 
mg/kg  dose.  The  median  time  of  maximum  concentration  (Tmax)  occurred  at  about  1  hour,  the  end  of 
the infusion at both doses. The elimination t1/2 of daptomycin remained unchanged between the 2 doses 
administered and was 5.4 and 5.7 hours, respectively, for the 8 and 10 mg/kg doses. Similarly, the CL of 
daptomycin did not appear to be significantly different between the 2 doses. The Cmax and  AUC  values 
were generally predictable across doses among 2 to 6 years old based on data from Study DAP-PEDS-05-
01  and  this  study,  indicating  linear  PKs.  Overall,  PK  parameters  were  comparable  with  those  obtained 
among 2 to 6 years old receiving a 4 mg/kg dose in Study DAP-PEDS-05-01. 
Drug  exposure  (AUC)  seen  in  adults  at  the  4  mg/kg  dose  was  494  μg  x  hr/mL  at  steady-state.  Drug 
exposure  seen  in  the  present  study  was  429  and  550  μg  x  hr/mL,  respectively,  at  the  8  and  10  mg/kg 
doses. This suggests that a dose of 9 mg/kg in 2 to 6 year old children may produce exposure equivalent 
to that seen in adults at 4 mg/kg dose. 
Due  to  larger  PK  differences  seen  in  children  aged  2  to  6  years,  further  investigation  of  the  PKs  of 
daptomycin in younger children (3 to 24 months old) was considered necessary prior to expanded use in 
this paediatric population. Consequently, Study DAP-PEDS-09-01 was conducted. 
DAP-PEDS-09-01: An Evaluation of the Pharmacokinetic Profile and Safety of a Single Dose of 
Daptomycin in Pediatric Subjects Aged 3 Months to Twenty-four Months Who are Concurrently 
Receiving Standard Antibiotic Therapy for Proven or Suspected Bacterial Infection including 
Peri-Operative Prophylactic Use of Antibiotics 
This study was multicentre, single dose, open-label, non-comparative, and designed to assess the PK and 
safety  of  daptomycin  in  paediatric  subjects  between  the  ages  of  3  months  to  24-months,  inclusive. 
Subjects with suspected or diagnosed bacterial infection, including those receiving prophylactic antibiotics 
peri-operatively, were included in this study in 3 age groups: 
• Age Group 1: 13 to 24 months, inclusive, dosed at 6 mg/kg as a 0.5-hour infusion; 
• Age Group 2: 7 to 12 months, inclusive, dosed at 4 mg/kg as a 0.5-hour infusion; 
• Age Group 3: 3 to 6 months, inclusive, dosed at 4 mg/kg as a 0.5-hour infusion. 
Plasma  PK  sampling  (0.5  mL/sample)  for  each  age  group  occurred  at  5  time  points:  end  of  infusion,  1 
hour, 2 hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours after the start of infusion.  
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate single dose PK data of iv daptomycin administered at 
4  mg/kg  or  6  mg/kg  as  a  0.5-hour  infusion  in  paediatric  subjects  aged  3  to  24  months,  inclusive,  with

proven or suspected bacterial infection who were receiving standard antibiotic therapy, including subjects 
receiving  prophylactic  antibiotics  peri-operatively.  The  secondary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  describe 
the safety of a single dose of iv daptomycin in this subject population. 
An overview of daptomycin plasma PK parameters is provided below: 
Following  the  administration  of  daptomycin  at  6  mg/kg  to  infants  in  Age  Group  1  (13  to  24  months  of 
age),  the  mean  area  under  the  concentration  time  curve  from  0  to  infinity  (AUC0-∞)  was  282  μg  x 
hr/mL, which was markedly lower than a corresponding dose in adults. Mean CL of daptomycin was high 
at  21.8  mL/hr/kg  which  was  approximately  twice  that  of  adults  with  normal  renal  function.  Compared 
with  adults,  the  mean  volume  of  distribution  at  steady-state  (Vss)  was  increased  while  mean  t1/2  was 
reduced. 
PK parameters following a 4 mg/kg dose infused to infants were similar in Age Group 2 and Age Group 3 
(7 to 12 months and 3 to 6 months of age, respectively). Compared with adults and older children, the 
patients  in  this  study  ages  3  to  24  months  had  more  rapid  daptomycin  clearance  and  shorter  half-lives 
resulting  in  lower  drug  exposures  (AUC),  confirming  that  dosage  adjustment  is  needed  to  ensure 
adequate exposure and satisfactory efficacy in infants. 
DAP-PEDS-07-03: An evaluation of the Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of Daptomycin in 
Paediatric subjects aged one to seventeen years with Complicated Skin and Skin Structure 
Infections caused by Gram-positive Pathogens 
Methods 
Multicentre, evaluator-blinded, randomized, comparative Phase 4 study. Safety, efficacy, and PKs of 
daptomycin were assessed in paediatric patients (1 to 17 years old, inclusive) with cSSSI caused by 
Gram-positive pathogens.  
Treatments 
Patients were enrolled in a stepwise approach into well-defined age groups and given age-dependent 
doses as follows, over a period of up to 14 days: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654096/2015 
Page 12/29 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Age Group 1: 12 to 17 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 5 mg/kg or SOC; 
Age Group 2: 7 to 11 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 7 mg/kg or SOC; 
Age Group 3: 2 to 6 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 9 mg/kg or SOC; 
Age Group 4: 1 to < 2 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 10 mg/kg or SOC. 
The comparator agent for this study was the SOC deemed appropriate by the Investigator. The 
recommended SOC agents were iv vancomycin, iv clindamycin, and iv semi-synthetic penicillins (nafcillin, 
oxacillin, or cloxacillin). Patients were randomized 2:1 to daptomycin vs. comparator SOC. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety of age dependent doses of intravenous (IV) 
DAP administered for up to 14 days in comparison with standard of care (SOC) therapy in paediatric 
subjects aged 1 to 17 years with cSSSI caused by Gram-positive pathogens. 
The secondary objectives of this study were: 
- To assess the efficacy of age-dependent doses of IV DAP administration for up to 14 
days in comparison with SOC therapy in pediatric subjects aged 1 to 17 years with 
cSSSI caused by Gram-positive pathogens. 
- To evaluate the population PK of age-dependent doses of IV DAP administered for up to 
14 days in pediatric subjects aged 1 to 17 years with cSSSI caused by Gram-positive 
pathogens. 
The  key  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  sponsor-defined  clinical  outcome  at  time-of-cure  (TOC),  which  was 
defined by a blinded medical director. The study was not powered for efficacy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Post-therapy clinical response was determined by comparing the subject’s signs and symptoms 
at the EOT and TOC Visits to those recorded at Study Baseline as follows: 
Cure: Resolution of clinically significant signs and symptoms associated with the skin 
infection present at Study Baseline. 
Improved: Partial resolution of clinical signs and symptoms of the skin infection. 
Failure: Inadequate clinical response to therapy. NOTE: if it was determined that the 
primary site of infection required additional antibiotic treatment, the Assessment of 
Clinical Response had to be a “Failure.” 
Unable to Evaluate: Unable to determine response because subject was lost to follow up 
Microbiological Response at Test of Cure 
It was acknowledged that DAP did not exert any significant activity against Gram-negative 
bacteria. Thus, any outcomes for Gram-negative bacteria were attributable to the concomitant 
use of aztreonam and/or metronidazole and not to study drug. Only Gram-positive bacteria 
should have been evaluated for Microbiological Response. 
Pathogen-level microbiological response: 
Utilizing data provided in the CRF, the sponsor assigned each Gram-positive pathogen isolated 
at Study Baseline to one of the microbiologic response categories, based on the TOC culture 
results, according to the following criteria: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654096/2015 
Page 13/29 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Persisted: Presence of the Baseline Infecting Pathogen in any Primary site of infection 
or blood culture obtained Post-Therapy (EOT through TOC). 
Presumed Persisted: Presumed presence of the Baseline Infecting Pathogen(s) when 
no post-therapy cultures were taken and the Investigator did not indicate that there was 
Nothing to Culture. 
Eradicated: Absence of the Baseline Infecting Pathogen(s) in any Primary site of 
infection or blood culture obtained (eg, No Growth Result) in a Post-Therapy Culture 
(EOT through TOC) as demonstrated by an organism classification of Not Classified. 
Presumed Eradicated: Presumed absence of the Baseline Infecting Pathogen(s) when 
no post therapy culture was taken and the Investigator indicated that there was Nothing 
to Culture. 
Non-evaluable: These subjects were missing the TOC evaluation. 
Not applicable: Organism classification is non-study Baseline infecting pathogen 
Subject-level microbiological response: 
Each subject’s skin infection due to one or more Gram-positive pathogens was assigned a 
microbiological response. The post-therapy microbiological response for infection was based 
on these criteria: 
Microbiologic Success: All Baseline Infecting pathogens were Eradicated or Presumed 
Eradicated and no Superinfecting pathogen(s) (Gram-positive) were isolated post 
therapy. 
Microbiologic Failure: Presence of a Persisting Pathogen or a Superinfecting pathogen 
(Gram-positive) post therapy (EOT through TOC). 
Microbiologic Non-evaluable: All Baseline Infecting Pathogens had a Pathogen-level 
Microbiological Response of Non-Evaluable. 
For each Gram-positive pathogen and each infection, "eradicated" or "presumed eradicated" was 
considered as a satisfactory microbiologic response. "Persisted," "presumed persisted," or a 
positive culture for a Superinfecting Pathogen (Gram-positive) at EOT through TOC was considered as an 
unsatisfactory microbiologic response. 
Randomisation 
Multicentre, evaluator-blinded, randomized, comparative study. Treatment assignment was based on a 
centralized computer-generated randomization schedule, stratified by age group, designed to achieve a 
2:1 ratio of subjects receiving DAP or comparator, respectively. Prior to randomization, the Investigator 
had to choose which comparator agent the subject would receive if randomized to SOC. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an evaluator-blinded study. A site blinding plan was developed at each site detailing 
exactly how the blind was maintained throughout the study. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy populations: Efficacy was analyzed by the randomized treatment group (Daptomycin 
or SOC) by age group in four efficacy populations 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) – all randomized subjects who received any dose of the study 
drug; 
Modified Intent-to-Treat (MITT) – subjects in the ITT population who have a Grampositive 
pathogen cultured at Baseline;

Clinically Evaluable (CE) – subpopulation of the ITT subjects who meet the following: 
Met the clinical criteria for the study infection (confirmed cSSSI); 
- Received the correct study drug, as randomized, at the correct dose; 
- Received ≥3 days of study medication (IV and oral combined) or < 3 days of 
  study medication and evaluated as “failure”; 
- Had the necessary clinical evaluations performed at TOC and were not evaluated 
  as “Unable to Evaluate”; 
- Did not receive potentially non-study antibiotics; and 
- Did not have a curative surgical procedure to remove the primary site of infection. 
Microbiologically Evaluable (ME) – CE subjects who had a Gram-positive pathogen cultured at 
Baseline. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 396 children were randomized and stratified by age group, to receive either daptomycin or SOC 
in a ratio of 2:1, respectively, with 256 children receiving daptomycin. 
Conduct of the study 
Most  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  received  ≤  7  days  of  IV  therapy  and  most  switched  to  oral 
therapy. A higher proportion of DAP-treated subjects received IV study drug for less than 3 days (47%) 
compared  to  SOC-treated  subjects  (35%).  Standard  of  care  IV  medication  was  primarily  clindamycin 
(50%)  and  vancomycin  (42%);  the  most  common  oral  anti-infective  administered  after  IV  therapy  was 
clindamycin  which  was  administered  to  39%  and  35%  of  subjects  who  converted  to  oral  therapy in  the 
DAP and SOC groups, respectively.

Baseline data 
Baseline  and  demographic  characteristics  between  the  two  groups  were  similar,  including  age,  sex  and 
types of infection.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Clinical success rates at TOC for the ITT population based on Sponsor-defined clinical outcomes were high 
and  similar  in  both  treatment  arms  (88.3%  in  the  DAP  arm  and  86.4%  in  the  SOC  arm)  as  were 
microbiological success rates at TOC in the MITT population (90.5% and 88.6%, respectively). Although 
clinical  success  rates  based  on  the  sponsor-defined clinical outcomes  at  TOC  in  the  ITT  population  were 
similar for subjects in the DAP and SOC arms, subjects in the DAP arm were converted from IV therapy to 
oral therapy earlier than those subjects in the SOC arm. High microbiological success rates at TOC were 
also noted for the most common Baseline infecting pathogens: MRSA (84.5% and 89.1% in the DAP and 
SOC  arms,  respectively),  MSSA  (95.3%  and  91.8%,  respectively),  and  S.  pyogenes  (100%  and  70.0%, 
respectively). 
Overall, similar results were obtained in the two groups:

The above results were supported by the blinded evaluator’s assessment: 
Microbiological results 
Overall,  206  (98.1%)  of  daptomycin-treated  and  105  (100%)  of  subjects  who  received  SOC  in  the 
Modified-Intent-to-Treat  (MITT)  population  had  MRSA,  MSSA,  or  Streptococcus  pyogenes.  Results  were 
similar except for S.pyogenes, where DAP showed better outcomes. 
Overall  therapeutic  response,  which  combined  both  sponsor-defined  clinical  outcome  and  the 
microbiological response, was evaluated in the ME population. Overall therapeutic response was similar in 
the  daptomycin  and  SOC  treatment  arms  with  success  rates  of  97%  and  99%,  respectively  (-1.7% 
difference).  Success  rates  between  daptomycin  and  SOC-treated  patients  were  generally  similar  across 
age groups.

EU-CORE: European CUBICIN Outcomes Registry and Experience for the Treatment of Serious 
Gram positive Infections 
EU-CORE  was  a  multicentre,  retrospective,  non-interventional  registry  designed  to  collect  outcome  data 
on patients who had received at least 1 dose of daptomycin for the treatment of a serious Gram-positive 
bacterial infection. 
No  dose  selection  was  applicable  due  to  retrospective  and  non-interventional  data  collection.  The  main 
objective of this study was to characterize the actual use of daptomycin in a large number of patients in a 
non-controlled, real-world setting. Data were collected retrospectively from patient files at investigators’ 
centres. 
This registry study included 6075 patients in 18 countries at 314 sites. Of the 6075 patients, a total of 81 
paediatric  patients  were  treated  with  daptomycin.  Forty-nine  (60.5%)  paediatric  patients  completed 
daptomycin  therapy,  27  (33.3%)  switched  to  another  antibiotic,  and  4  (4.9%)  discontinued  daptomycin 
therapy due to AEs. The majority of the paediatric patients were male (65.4%) and Caucasian (92.5%). 
Median age was 13 years (0 to < 1 years, 2 (2.5%) patients; 1 to < 2 years, 3 (3.7%) patients; 2 to < 7 
years,  10  (12.3%)  patients;  7  to  <  12  years,  20  (24.7%)  patients;  and  12  to  <  18  years,  46  (56.8%) 
patients. Median body weight was 46.5 kg. 
The most common primary infection among the paediatric patients was bacteraemia, which was reported 
in  16  patients  (19.8%),  followed  by  cSSSI  (15  patients,  18.5%),  osteomyelitis  non-prosthetic  and 
prosthetic  device-related  (11  patients,  13.6%),  IE  (10  patients,  12.3%)  and  foreign  body/prosthetic 
infection  (10  patients,  12.3%).  The  overall  clinical  success  rate  in  paediatric  patients  was  100%  for 
bacteraemia, IE, osteomyelitis non-prosthetic and prosthetic device-related, and uncomplicated skin and 
skin  structure  infection  (uSSSI);  and  73.3%  for  cSSSI.  Clinical  success  rates  among  the  paediatric 
patients were high for both first-line and second-line treatment (93.3% and 92.0%, respectively). Clinical 
outcome  by  indication  and  dosing  group  for  paediatric  patients  was  difficult  to  interpret  due  to  small 
numbers. 
Summary of main study 
The following table summarises the efficacy results from the main study supporting the present 
application. This summary should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as 
the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Design 
This was a multi-centre, evaluator-blinded, randomised, comparative study 
originally designed to assess the safety, efficacy, and PK of DAP in paediatric 
subjects between the ages of 3 months to 17 years, inclusive, with cSSSI caused 
by Gram-positive pathogens.  
Subjects were enrolled into well-defined age groups and given age-dependent 
doses as outlined below, over a period of up to 14 days. Enrolment into each age 
group followed a step-wise approach.  
Subjects were first enrolled into Age Groups 1 and 2 (7 years of age and older), 
followed by subjects 1-6 years of age (Age Groups 3 and 4). Safety and clinical 
data collected in children 7 years of age and older supported the extension of 
enrolment into younger age groups.  
Prior to opening enrolment to include children 3 months to <1 year of age a Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) reviewed newly available nonclinical data and 
recommended that due to the benefit/risk ratio, the lower limit of enrolment for 
this study be 1 year of age.  
The DMC’s recommendation to stop the trial prior to enrolment of the youngest 
age group was submitted to and agreed upon with the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). No subjects were enrolled in Age Group 5 (3 months - < 1 
year). 
A total of 396 children were randomised and stratified by age group, to receive 
either daptomycin (DAP) or standard of care (SOC) (suggested as IV vancomycin, 
IV clindamycin or IV semi-synthetic penicillins [nafcillin, oxacillin, or cloxacillin]) in 
a ratio of 2:1, respectively, with 263 children receiving DAP. 
Subjects may have switched to oral therapy following completion of IV study drug 
administration provided they showed clear clinical improvement and the pathogen 
was susceptible to an oral agent. The choice of oral therapy was left to the 
discretion of the Investigator. A sufficient number of subjects were randomized to 
ensure that a minimum of 50 subjects each in Age Groups 1, 2, and 3 and 30 
subjects in Age Group 4 received DAP. 
In Age Groups 1, 2, and 3, PK sampling was done only for subjects assigned to 
DAP who volunteered at the time of Informed Consent, with a goal of at least 12 
subjects in each age group (Age Groups 1, 2 and 3). This sample size per age 
group, in addition to previously obtained data in paediatric subjects, should have 
been adequate for population PK analysis. Subjects who volunteered for PK 
sampling had a 0.5 mL blood sample collected for PK analysis at the following time 
points (relative to end-of-infusion [EOI]): 
•  Age Group 1 (12–17 years old): Day 3: Pre-dose (T0), 0.25 hr (15 min), 1 
hr, 4 hr, and 12 hr; 
•  Age Group 2 (7–11 years old): Day 3: Pre-dose (T0), 0.25 hr (15 min), 1 
hr, 6 hr, and 10 hr; 
•  Age Group 3 (2–6 years old): Day 1, 2, or 3: Pre-dose (T0), 0.25 hr (15 
min), 1 hr, 6 hr, and 8 hr. 
If enrolment in Age Group 3 was completed without collection of adequate PK 
data, the cohort remained open for subjects consenting to PK sampling only.  
In Age Group 4, sparse PK sampling was done for all subjects assigned to DAP 
who consented to participate in the study. Subjects randomized to DAP had a 0.5 
mL blood sample collected for PK analysis at 2 of 5 time points relative to the end 
of the infusion 
•  Age Group 4 (1–<2 years old): Day 1, 2, or 3: 0 hr (EOI), 1, 2, 4, and 6 
hr relative to end of infusion. 
Time points were randomly assigned for each subject. A randomization schema 
ensured an equal distribution of blood samples at each of the 5 time points. A 
population PK approach was used for Group 4. The windows for the sample time 
points were as follows: EOI (<10 minutes), 1 hour (+15 minutes), 2 hours (+15 
minutes), 4 hours (+20 minutes), and 6 hours (+30 minutes).

7.1.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH has submitted a phase 4 clinical study in paediatric patients to determine the appropriate doses 
of daptomycin in different age groups.  Daptomycin administered at doses of 5, 7, 9, or 10 mg/kg for up 
to 14 days to pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years, 7 to 11 years, 2 to 6 years, and 1 to < 2 years, 
respectively, was effective in the treatment of cSSTI caused by Gram-positive pathogens: 
- Clinical success rates for daptomycin (88.3%) and SOC (86.4%) were comparable. 
- Consistent results were noted in all analysis populations, including MITT, CE, and ME, 
  indicating the robustness of the results in the primary analysis population. 
- Based on excellent clinical and microbiological success rates, the overall therapeutic 
  success rate also was high and similar in the DAP (97.0%) and SOC (98.7%) treatment arms. 
Regarding the retrospective, non-interventional registry (EUCORE), inferential analyses were not 
conducted and no formal statistical methodology other than simple descriptive statistics was used. All 
analyses are considered to be exploratory. The overall clinical success rate in pediatric patients was 100% 
for bacteremia, IE, osteomyelitis non-prosthetic and prosthetic device-related, and uSSSI, and 73.3% for 
cSSTI. Clinical success rates were high for both the first-line and second-line treatment (93.3% and 
92.0%, respectively). Clinical outcome by indication and dosing group for paediatric patients was difficult 
to interpret due to small numbers. 
7.1.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A well-characterized, efficacious, dosing regimen for paediatric patients with cSSTIs has been established.

7.2.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of daptomycin in the currently approved indications (in adults) is summarised 
hereafter: 
In clinical studies, 2,011 subjects received Cubicin. Within these trials, 1,221 subjects received a daily 
dose of 4 mg/kg, of whom 1,108 were patients and 113 were healthy volunteers; 460 subjects received a 
daily dose of 6 mg/kg, of whom 304 were patients and 156 were healthy volunteers. Adverse reactions 
(i.e. considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the medicinal 
product) were reported at similar frequencies for Cubicin and comparator regimens. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (frequency common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10)) are: 
Fungal infections, urinary tract infection, candida infection, anaemia, anxiety, insomnia, dizziness, 
headache, hypertension, hypotension, gastrointestinal and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, 
constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, bloating and distension, liver function tests abnormal (increased 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP)), rash, 
pruritus, limb pain, serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased, infusion site reactions, pyrexia, 
asthenia. 
Less frequently reported, but more serious, adverse reactions include hypersensitivity reactions, 
eosinophilic pneumonia, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), angioedema and 
rhabdomyolysis. 
Safety in paediatric populations 
DAP-PEDS-05-01: 
Daptomycin administered as a single i.v. dose of 4 mg/kg was safe and well-tolerated in children aged 2 
to 17 years. No serious adverse events were reported and none of the patients discontinued the study 
due to adverse events.  There was no clinically meaningful difference in the adverse event reporting rates 
or profile of adverse events across the different age groups. A total of 6 (24%) of the 25 patients 
reported at least one adverse event, including 2 patients in each age group. All reported events were mild 
in severity; no events of moderate or severe intensity were reported. The most commonly reported types 
of events were gastrointestinal in nature and included diarrhea in 2 (8%) of the 25 patients and nausea, 
upper abdominal pain and tongue disorder in one (4%) patient each. Other events reported in one (4%) 
patient each were infusion site reaction, injection site reaction and headache. Only one event, infusion 
site reaction (infiltration of the i.v. catheter) was assessed as drug-related by the Investigators. 
There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between age groups with 2 subjects in each 
group experiencing adverse events. The incidence of gastrointestinal events was also similar with one 
patient each reporting events in Groups 1 and 2 and 2 patients reporting events in Group 3. No other 
event was seen to be more common in any age group.  No safety issues were noted from review of 
clinical laboratory tests, vital signs or ECG evaluations. None of the patients had a clinically significant 
elevation in CPK and no adverse events related to the musculoskeletal or peripheral nervous systems 
were reported. 
DAP-PEDS-07-02: 
Daptomycin administered as a single i.v. dose of 8 or 10 mg/kg was safe and well-tolerated in paediatric 
subjects aged 2 to 6 years. One SAE of moderate groin abscess was reported by 1 subject in Group 2 who 
was receiving treated with standard antibiotic therapy for cellulitis of the groin. This event was assessed 
as unrelated to study treatment. Overall, a total of 6 (50%) of the 12 subjects experienced at least one 
AE during the study, including 2 subjects in Group 1 and 4 subjects in Group 2. Most reported events 
were mild in severity. The most commonly reported event was tonsillar hypertrophy in 2 subjects. All

other events were reported in 1 subject each. The adverse events noted were, for the most part, typical 
of a young patient population being treated for infection. 
There were no treatment-emergent clinically relevant changes observed in clinical laboratory, vital signs, 
or ECG findings. 
DAP-PEDS-09-01: 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  increased  blood  CPK  (3  subjects,  13%)  and  constipation, 
teething, and pyrexia (2 subjects each, 8%). All other TEAEs were reported in 1 subject each overall. One 
(4%)  subject  experienced  a  TEAE,  pyrexia  that  was  assessed  as  both  severe  and  serious  due  to 
hospitalization.  Three  (13%)  of  the  24  subjects  experienced  5  TEAEs  that  were  assessed  as  possibly 
related  to  study  drug  and  included  increased  blood  CPK,  increased  ALT,  increased  AST  in  1  subject, 
increased blood CPK in 1 subject, and rash in 1 subject; all 3 subjects were in Age Group 2. No subjects 
discontinued from study medication due to a TEAE. 
DAP-PEDS-07-03: 
Safety  assessments  consisted  of  all  AEs,  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  with  their  severity  and 
relationship  to  study  drug,  and  regular  assessments  of  physical  condition,  vital  signs,  weight,  and 
laboratory parameters. Safety analysis included all patients given at least 1 dose of the study drug. 
The  majority  of  reported  AEs  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity.  Events  deemed  related  to  study  drug 
were  reported  in  35  (14%)  DAP-treated  subjects  and  22  (17%)  SOC-treated  subjects.  Serious  adverse 
events were reported in 6 (2%) DAP-treated subjects and 3 (2%) SOC-treated subjects. Overall, 3% and 
5%  of  subjects  in  the  DAP  and  SOC  treatment  arms  discontinued  treatment  due  to  TEAEs.  All  TEAEs 
resulting in discontinuation were mild or moderate in severity. 
Gastrointestinal  disorders  (12%  of  DAP-treated  subjects  and  11%  of  SOC-treated  subjects),  most 
frequently diarrhea (7% and 5%, respectively) and investigations (7% of DAP-treated subjects and 8% of 
SOC-treated  subjects),  most  frequently  increased  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  (6%  and  5%, 
respectively),  were  the  most  common  types  of  AEs,  by  system  organ  class,  reported  during  the  study 
with no notable differences across age groups (refer also to Table 1: summary for trial DAP-PEDS-07-03). 
Based on the known safety profile of DAP in adults, the use of SMQ of rhabdomyolysis and myopathy was 
examined  as  a  surrogate  of  muscle  toxicity.  Such  events  were  reported  with  similar  incidence  in  DAP-
treated  and  SOC-treated  subjects  (6%  in  each  arm).  Further,  the  incidence of  clinically  significant  post-
Baseline elevations in CPK (>500 U/L and 3 × Baseline level) was similar in the 2 treatment arms (2% in 
each). 
No safety signals were apparent from the safety examination. 
EU-CORE: 
Safety  assessments  consisted  of  all  AEs,  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  with  their  severity  and 
relationship  to  study  drug,  and  regular  assessments  of  physical  condition,  vital  signs,  weight,  and 
laboratory parameters. Safety analysis included all patients given at least 1 dose of the study drug. 
Six (7.4%) out of 81 paediatric patients reported adverse events (rash (2), tachycardia (1), anaphylactic 
reaction  (1),  hypersensitivity  (1),  increased  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  (1),  osteosarcoma  (1),  acute 
renal  failure  (1),  dyspnoea  (1),  and  pulmonary  haemorrhage  (1).  Four  patients  had  an  increase  in  CPK 
levels  but  none  of  these  patients  reported  myopathy  related  AEs.  Three  patients  had  SAEs  that  led  to 
permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug  (anaphylactic  reaction,  pulmonary  haemorrhage  and  death, 
acute renal failure). One patient died but the death was considered not related to daptomycin.

7.2.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Most AEs in all of the above mentioned studies were characterized as mild or moderate in intensity and 
were  not  attributed  to  daptomycin  by  either  the  sponsor  or  investigator.  Overall,  the  most  frequently 
reported  AEs  were  in  the  following  system  organ  classes:  gastrointestinal  disorders,  investigations  and 
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Elevated CPK was reported as an AE more frequently in patients 
treated with daptomycin than in patients receiving placebo or comparator antibiotics. 
7.2.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new adverse events of concern were identified and the safety data from obtained in paediatric patients 
were consistent with the known safety profile of daptomycin.

8.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Daptomycin has been used widely in adult patients with a favorable benefit-risk profile as well as a well-
known efficacy and safety profile. Daptomycin has  now been studied in the paediatric population, and  a 
well  characterized  dosing  regimen  for  treating  children  with  cSSTIs  has  been  established  providing 
clinicians  an  alternative  to  other  available  treatments  in  an  easily  administered  (once  daily)  iv  infusion. 
Daptomycin  has  also  been  shown  to  have  activity  against  MRSA,  an  emerging  major  health  problem 
worldwide.  Because  few  antibiotics  to  treat  MRSA  have  been  evaluated  in  children,  a  need  exists  for 
alternative  treatment  options  with  demonstrated  and  well  characterized  safety  and  efficacy  in  the 
paediatric population. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Daptomycin has been used in the paediatric population off-label till now. With this variation Daptomycin 
has  been  shown  to  be  safe  and  effective  in  children  for  the  treatment  of  cSSTIs.  However  other 
indications  approved  for  adults  (RIE  and  SAB)  have  still  not  got  sufficient  data  in  the  paediatric 
population.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Risks that are known to occur in adult patients could also occur in paediatric patients; however, they may 
occur with different frequency or severity. In studies conducted to date, daptomycin has been shown to 
be  safe  at  the  doses  being  proposed  for  treatment  of  cSSTI.  In  the  studies  used  to  support  this 
submission, limited data are available from long-term exposure. Many patients had only a single iv dose 
or  a  short  treatment  duration  (≤  7  days)  such  as  in  Study  DAP-PEDS-07-03  for  which  the  median 
duration  of  treatment  was  3  days  for  both  DAP-treated  subjects  and  SOC-treated  subjects.  The  PopPK 
study confirmed that target daptomycin levels were achieved in the target population; however, this will 
need to be confirmed by additional clinical observations in other types of paediatric infections. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No unexpected adverse effects were observed in the clinical studies in the paediatric population. However 
further  information  will  only  be  obtained  when  an  increased  number  of  subjects  receive  daptomycin  in 
normal clinical practice. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
A well-characterized, efficacious, dosing regimen for paediatric patients with cSSTIs has been established.  
In studies conducted to date, daptomycin has been shown to be safe at the doses being proposed for 
treatment of cSSTI.  The overall benefit-risk balance of daptomycin in the target paediatric population is 
deemed as favourable.

accordingly.  Moreover, the updated RMP version 9.1 has been agreed. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
10.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the 
EPAR module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of indication to extend the age range for the indication "complicated skin and soft-tissue 
infections" (cSSTI), to include paediatric patients from 1 to 17 years of age; as a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the Cubicin SmPC are amended. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly.  Moreover, the updated RMP version 9.1 has been agreed. 
Summary 
As part of the clinical development programme, the Market Authorisation holder (MAH) has performed a 
number of post-authorisation studies in the paediatric population to support the safety, efficacy and 
dosing recommendations. Results from single dose, pharmacokinetic/safety studies paediatric subgroups, 
together with results obtained in DAP-PEDS-07-03 (a phase IV, multicentre, randomised, investigator 
blinded trial in 389 paediatric patients; age range: 1 to 17 years old), established that higher doses are 
required in children (varying according to age groups), in order to produce exposures equivalent to that 
seen for efficacy in adults.  These trials led to the selection of a well-characterised, efficacious, dosing 
regimen for paediatric patients with cSSTIs.  Moreover, from these studies, as well as from data obtained 
in 81 paediatric patients included in a retrospective registry (with daptomycin for the treatment of a 
Assessment report

serious Gram-positive bacterial infection), no new adverse events of concern were identified and the 
safety data from these paediatric patients were consistent with the known safety profile of daptomycin. 
The overall benefit-risk balance of daptomycin for the treatment of cSSTI in the paediatric population (1-
17 years of age) is favourable.

Scientific discussion 
Introduction 
About the product 
KIOVIG  is  a  plasma-derived  product  consisting  of  a  highly  purified  preparation  of  human  IgG.  It  is 
supplied  as  a  ready-to-use  liquid  formulation  with  a  pH  of  4.6  to  5.1.  98%  of  the  protein  is  gamma 
globulin  with  a  normal  subclass  distribution.  The  manufacturing  process  results  in  an  intact  IgG 
molecule  with  complete  functional  activity.  The  final  product  contains  only  trace  amounts  of  IgA  and 
IgM. Glycine is used as a stabiliser. KIOVIG is supplied in single-dose vials that nominally contain 1g, 
2.5g, 5g, 10g, 20g and 30g protein per vial. 
In  the  EU,  KIOVIG  is  currently  licensed  for  replacement  therapy  in  a  number  of  primary 
immunodeficiency  disorders  (PID),  for  immune  modulation  in  idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  purpura 
(ITP), Guillain Barré syndrome and Kawasaki disease, and for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation 
according to the current Core SmPC for human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration 
(IVIg) (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/094038/2007). 
About the disease 
Multifocal  motor  neuropathy  (MMN)  is  a  rare,  probably  immune-mediated  disorder  characterized  by 
slowly progressive, asymmetric, distal weakness of one or more limbs, most commonly the arms, with 
no objective loss of sensation. Multifocal motor neuropathy was described in detail in 1988 for the first 
time (Parry GJ, Clarke S. Multifocal acquired demyelinating neuropathy masquerading as motor neuron 
disease. Muscle Nerve 1988;11:103-7). This weakness may be accompanied by muscle atrophy in later 
stages  of  the  disease,  and  cramps  and  fasciculation  are  reported  to  occur  in  approximately  50%  of 
patients with MMN. Tendon reflexes are often decreased or absent in the affected limb. The hallmark of 
the  disease  is  the  presence  of  multifocal  conduction  block  on  electrophysiological  testing  outside  the 
usual sides of nerve compression. 
Almost 80% of people with MMN are between 20 and 50 years of age at onset of the disease, and men 
are  more  frequently  affected  than  women  (2.6:1).  The  prevalence  is  estimated  to  be  1  to  2  per 
100,000. 
MMN seems to be an immune mediated disorder. Serum IgM GM1 antibodies are detectable in 30% to 
80%  of  the  patients,  furthermore  increased  signal  intensities  on  T2-weighted  MR  images  of  the 
brachial plexus have been observed suggesting an inflammatory process.  
Treatment  options  for  MMN  patients  are  sparse.  Patients  with  MMN  do  not  respond  to  steroids  or 
plasma exchange, and may even worsen with these treatments.  
Cyclophosphamide  and  interferon-beta  1a  have  been  suggested  beneficial  in  several  uncontrolled 
studies, but cyclophosphamide has serious long-term side effects and interferon-beta 1a has only been 
tested in a very limited number of patients.  
Previous  studies  on  the  use  of  IVIg  in  patients  with  MMN  suggest  variable  effects  on  disability  or 
muscle  impairment,  which  is  partly  due  to  the  small  patient  populations  studied.  In  addition,  the 
disability scales and scores for muscle weakness used have their limitation in that they are not adapted 
specifically  for  MMN  resulting  in  changes  in  overall  strength  and  disability  parameter  are  comparably 
small. 
Limitations  regarding  the  available  data  on  the  efficacy  of  IVIg  treatment  in  patients  with  MMN  are 
essentially  related  to  the  rare  nature  of  the  condition,  and  the  interindividual  variability  in  response

rates. Furthermore, the use of different disability scales in the studies, for instance the modified Norris 
scale  by  Azulay  (Intravenous  immunoglobulin  treatment  in  patients  with  motor  neuron  syndromes 
associated  with  anti-GM1  antibodies.  Neurol.  1994;  44:429-432),  modified  Rankin  scale  by  van  den 
Berg  (Improvement  of  multifocal  motor  neuropathy  during  long-term  weekly  treatment  with  human 
immunoglobulin. Neurology.1995; 45:987-988.) and a self-evaluation scale score from 0 to 5 by Léger 
(Intravenous  immunoglobulin  therapy  in  multifocal  motor  neuropathy.  Brain.2001;124:145-153) 
contribute to impression of divergent results. 
An  analysis  (Cochrane  Review)  across  all  randomized  controlled-trials  on  IVIg  treatment  in  MMN 
demonstrated  a  non-significant 
trend 
towards 
improvement 
in  disability  after 
intravenous 
immunoglobulin compared with placebo, and a significant improvement in muscle strength (van Schaik 
IN,  van  den  Berg  LH,  de  Haan  R,  Vermeulen  M.  Intravenous  immunoglobulin  for  multifocal  motor 
neuropathy. Cochrane Database Syst.Rev. 2005, CD004429). 
Treatment guidelines / recommendations 
The  treatment  of  multifocal  motor  neuropathy  (MMN)  with  IVIg  is  recommended  by  the  Guideline  on 
Management  of  Multifocal  Motor  Neuropathy  and  the  European  Federation  of  Neurological 
Societies/Peripheral  Nerve  Society  (EFNS/PNS)  Guideline  for  the  Use  of  IVIg  in  the  Treatment  of 
Neurological Diseases. The EFNS/PNS Guideline recommends IVIg dosage regimens of 1 g/kg every 2-
4 weeks or 2 g/kg every 4-8 weeks. Treatment strategies that aim to detect the lowest effective dose 
and the longest tolerated interval may lead to insufficient dosing in the long-term in many patients. 
The use of IVIg in the treatment of MMN is supported by the 2009 assessment of off-label-use expert 
panel  convened  by  the  German  Ministry  of  Health.  The  expert  panel  concluded  that  IVIg  therapy  in 
patients  with  MMN  was  recommended  despite  recognized  weaknesses  of  published  studies,  since  a 
positive  safety  profile  and  a  response  rate  to  IVIg  of  approximately  80%  have  been  established  and 
alternative therapies are lacking. 
Distinct IVIgs have been approved for the treatment of MMN in a few European Countries on a national 
basis (France, the Netherlands, and Belgium). 
The  present  variation  application  has  been  submitted  to  add  the  treatment  of  MMN  to  the  approved 
indications for Kiovig in 4.1 of the SmPC. It considers the CHMP guideline on the clinical investigation 
of 
human 
normal 
immunoglobulin 
for 
the 
intravenous 
administration 
(IVIg) 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev.2). 
The  Applicant  did  not  seek  scientific  advice  from  CHMP  for  the  development  in  this  indication.  The 
applicantion  included  a  summary  of  published  literature  and  the  results  of  two  completed  clinical 
studies in patients with MMN. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
This variation did not fall under Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006, as amended (“Paediatric 
Regulation”). 
The Applicant has provided a statement confirming the absence of EU patent coverage for the product 
which was recognised by EMA as the reason for being exempt from the formal PIP requirements posed 
by the Article 8 of the regulation.

Placebo-controlled Studies on IVIg Products in MMN 
The  use  of  IVIg  for  MMN  was  the  subject  of  an  extensive  review  by  the  Cochrane  Collaboration.  The 
Cochrane  search  retrieved  285  studies  including  a  total  of  484  MMN  patients,  383  of  whom  were 
treated with IVIg. Four controlled, double-blind studies were identified, in which a total of 46 patients 
with  MMN  received  treatment  with  IVIg  (Table  2).  In  a  meta-analysis  of  these  studies  conducted  by 
van Schaik et al. (2005), an improvement in strength was reported in 78% of patients following IVIg 
treatment  compared  to  4%  following  a  placebo.  Improvement  in  disability  was  observed  in  39%  and 
11% of patients following IVIg therapy and placebo, respectively.

Table 2. 
Long-term Treatment of MMN with IVIg products 
Several studies, involving a total of 89 patients, have assessed the long-term efficacy (up to 12 years) 
of treatment of MMN with IVIg (Table 3). The beneficial effects of treatment appeared within days or 1-
4 weeks, and declined within 4 to 8 weeks, requiring repeat dosing at variable intervals. Maintenance 
treatment,  guided  by  the  functional  disability  of  the  individual  patient,  is  therefore  necessary  to 
maintain the beneficial effect on muscle strength in most cases. 
The response to IVIg treatment decreased in some subjects over time, which is likely to be a result of 
progressive axonal loss. However, increasing monthly doses appeared to restore treatment response. 
Notably,  despite  general  disease  progression  and  increases  in  muscle  weakness  over  time,  MMN 
patients  on  long-term  maintenance  treatment  with  IVIg  had  improved  strength  scores  at  the  end  of 
observation period compared to baseline. 
Nonetheless, disease progression is inherent in the natural course of MMN, and cannot be completely 
halted by IVIg treatment. For example, in a long-term observational study in 11 patients receiving IVIg 
(GAMMAGARD  SD,  Baxter)  over  4-8  years,  the  average  slope  of  the  MRC  sum  scores  was  -0.2 
(standard  deviation  [SD]  0.2).  With  respect  to  Guy’s  disability  scores,  the  average  slopes  were  -0.1 
(SD  0.8)  for  upper  limbs,  and  -0.4  (SD  0.7)  for  lower  limbs.  Statistically,  the  declines  were  not 
different from zero, and reflected intra-, and inter-individual variation. Overall, muscle strength tended 
to be slightly lower at the end of the observation period, compared to the initial response, but was still 
higher than before IVIg initiation. These findings are similar to other long-term observational studies.

Table 3. 
Uncontrolled Studies 
Many  open  and  uncontrolled  studies  on  the  efficacy  of  IVIg  therapy  in  patients  with  MMN  have  been 
published.  An  analysis  conducted  by  van  Schaik  (2005)  showed  that  383  of  the  487  MMN  patients 
described  were  treated  with  IVIg.  Improvement  in muscle  strength  was  reported  in  303/373  patients 
(81.2%), an improvement in disability was reported in 91/23 IVIg treated patients (74.0%). 
In  a  national  MMN  database  in  the  Netherlands  described  by  van  den  Berg,  90/94  (96%)  of  MMN 
patients  received  an  initial  IVIg  course  at  a  cumulative  dose  of  2g/kg.  Seventy-four  (79%)  patients 
responded to initial treatment and received IVIg maintenance treatment. This clinical response to initial 
treatment with IVIg is comparable to that reported in placebo-controlled studies.  
The  available  data  on  the  efficacy  of  IVIg  treatment  in  patients  with  MMN  have  limitations  from  a 
biometrical  perspective  with  respect  to  patient  number,  cross-over  design  and  duration  of  the  post-
observation  periods.  These  limitations  are  essentially  related  to  the  rare  nature  of  the  condition  and 
the inter-individual variability in response rates. The use of different disability scales in the studies (for 
instance the modified Norris scale by Azulay 1994, modified Rankin scale by van den Berg 1995 and a 
self-evaluation scale score from 0 to 5 by Léger 2001 contribute to impression of divergent results, but 
an analysis across all studies on IVIg treatment in MMN demonstrated maintained muscle strength and 
functionality. 
Comparability of different IVIg products 
Human  normal  immunoglobulins  are  produced  from  a  pool  of  donations  from  1,000  to  more  than 
50,000  healthy  donors  (depending  on  the  manufacturer)  and  hence  contain  principally  IgG,  with  a 
subclass  distribution  that  largely  reflects  that  of  IgG  in  normal  subjects.  The  large  number  of  pooled 
Assessment report  
Page 6/40
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
donations  provides  a  large  array  of  antibodies  that  cover  specificities  for  infectious  agents  to  provide 
replacement therapy for immune deficiencies. The large array of antibodies from multiple donors also 
provides naturally occurring antibodies that are cross-reactive to self antigens or pathologic antibodies. 
Some  investigators  consider  the  latter  to  be  the  basis  of  immune  effects  of  IVIg  therapy  in 
autoimmune  disease.  Although  all  IVIgs  have  to  adhere  to  the  European  Pharmacopoeia  monograph 
0918,  some  differences  in  the  pharmaceutical  composition  between  products,  but  also  between 
batches of one product do exist. These differences may impact IVIg tolerability and safety. The extent 
of  the  impact  on  therapeutic  efficacy  is  not  known  exactly.  However,  it  can  be  expected  to  be  small, 
given the similarity in the active ingredients composition, namely in IgG content and half-life (Cherin et 
al. 2010). 
To assess if different IVIg brands, or different lots of the same brand, may affect efficacy, Zhang et al 
examined  the  protective  efficacy  of  8  different  brands  of  IVIg  and  different  lots  of  two  brands: 
GAMMAGARD  S/D  (Baxter),  Iveegam  EN  /  Endobulin  (Baxter),  Flebogamma  (Grifols)  (3  different 
batches),  Panglobulin  NF  (American  Red  Cross),  Carimune  NF  (ZLB  Bioplasma),  Octagam 
(Octapharma), Gamunex (Bayer Healthcare) and Gammar-PLV (ZLB Behring) (4 different batches). 
The  efficacy  model  used  by  Zhang  et  al.  is  an  anti-ganglioside  antibody-mediated,  complement-
dependent neurotoxicity assay considered to be relevant notably for MMN. In this cell culture model of 
autoimmune  nerve  injury,  the  results  showed  that  a)  the  eight  different  commercial  brands  of  IVIg 
have  similar  protective  efficacy  and  b)  for  2  IVIg  products  (Endobulin  and  Gammar-PLV)  there  is  no 
lot-to-lot  variability.  These  results  suggest  that  efficacy  of  different  IVIg  products  is  comparable  in  a 
standardized model. 
Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Baxter has not performed pharmacokinetic studies in MMN, but has submitted pharmacokinetic data on 
KIOVIG in 22 patients with PID in the course of the centralized licensing procedure in Europe. There is 
no  evidence  suggesting  that  the  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  KIOVIG  in  patients  with  MMN  are 
different  to  those  in  patients  treated  for  approved  indications.  The  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of 
IVIg products are also well described in the literature.  
Pharmacodynamics 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  KIOVIG  in  indications  other  than  replacement  therapy  has  not  been 
elucidated,  but  may  include  a  variety  of  immunomodulatory  effects.  MMN  seems  to  be  an  immune 
mediated  disorder.  Serum  IgM  GM1  antibodies  are  detectable  in  30%  to  80%  of  the  patients, 
furthermore  increased  signal  intensities  on  T2-weighted  MR  images  of  the  brachial  plexus  have  been 
observed  suggesting  an  inflammatory  process.  There  are  no  conclusive  data  on  the  specific  mode  of 
action of IVIg in patients with MMN. 
Clinical efficacy 
Introduction 
The  evaluation  of  the  efficacy  is  based  on  two  investigator-initiated,  open-label  clinical  studies 
evaluating the efficacy of KIOVIG treatment in patients with MMN:  
Assessment report

1.  MMN  Conversion  study  (Study  I):  a  prospective  open-label,  non-controlled  study  over  12 
months  in  20  MMN  patients,  in  order  to  demonstrate  clinical  equivalence  in  two  IVIg 
preparations  (KIOVIG  vs.  GAMMAGARD  S/D)  in  maintenance  treatment.  19  of  the  20  patients 
entered  a  two-year  follow-up  period  to  document  long-term  efficacy  and  adverse  effects  of 
KIOVIG.  
GAMMAGARD  S/D  is  a  freeze-dried  5%  (50  g/l)  IVIg  preparation  for  reconstitution  prior  to 
infusion;  it  is  approved  for  use  in  the  indication  MMN  in  the  Netherlands.  KIOVIG  is  a  liquid 
concentrated (10%, 100 g/l) ready-to-use IVIg preparation for infusion. 
2.  A prospective, open-label, non-controlled study was conducted in 2007-2010 to investigate the 
efficacy of KIOVIG for initial  treatment in 8 patients with newly diagnosed MMN (Study  II). 
Seven of the eight patients were administered long-term treatment following completion of the 
initial 5-day course.  
A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study (Baxter clinical study 160604) is 
currently being conducted to investigate the efficacy of KIOVIG in the treatment of subjects with MMN. 
A total of 40 subjects are planned to be enrolled in this study. Efficacy data were not yet available at 
the time of assessment of this application. 
Dose response study 
No  formal  dose-finding  studies  have  been  conducted  with  KIOVIG.  As  recommended  by  the  EFNS 
guideline  for  the  Use  of  IVIg  in  Treatment  of  Neurological  Diseases  and  the  EFNS/PNS  Guideline  on 
Management of MMN, the doses for the two MMN studies described above were 2g/kg (given over 2-5 
days) as fist line treatment and individual dosing for subsequent infusions (guided by responses, e.g. 
0.4g/kg every 1-2 weeks or 2g/kg every 4-8 weeks). 
Main studies 
Methods 
  Study Participants 
MMN Conversion Study (Study I) 
The  study  was  to  included  20  adult  subjects  with  a  diagnosis  of  “definitive  MMN”  or  “probable  MMN” 
according  to published  criteria  (Van  den  Berg,  2000; Asseldonk et  al.,  2005)  that  were  responsive  to 
IVIg  treatment    and  had  received  maintenance  treatment  with  freeze-dried  5%  IVIg  (GAMMAGARD 
S/D)  for  a  period  of  at  least  one  year  prior  to  inclusion.  Patients  had  to  have  normal  sensory  nerve 
conduction  in  segments  with  motor  conduction  block  (CB)  and  normal  distal  sensory  nerve  action 
potential  amplitudes  at  the  first  nerve  conduction  study.  Exclusion  criteria  included  treatment  with 
immunosuppressive  drugs  in  the  three  preceding  months,  a  history  of  severe  adverse  reactions  to 
immunoglobulin  treatment,  IgA  deficiency,  chronic  heart  failure  or  renal  dysfunction;  pregnant  or 
breast-feeding women were also excluded. 
Initial treatment of MMN (Study II) 
8  adult  (1  female,  7  male)  subjects  who  had  been  newly  diagnosed  with  MMN  were  enrolled  in  the 
study. The duration from first onset of clinical symptoms of MMN (reported muscle weakness) and start 
of treatment varied from 1 to 12 years.

  Treatments 
MMN Conversion Study (Study I) 
After enrolment, patients were treated with their regular maintenance dose of GAMMAGARD S/D for 3 
months. During this time, patients visited the outpatient clinic three times: at baseline (t = -2), after 6 
(t=-1)  and  after  12  weeks  (t=0),  at  which  time  treatment  with  KIOVIG  was  initiated.  Patients  were 
then treated for a further 9 months with KIOVIG at an equivalent dose (Figure 1). 
Figure 1 
Study design of MMN Conversion study (Study I) 
After 9 months of treatment with KIOVIG, patients could be continued on maintenance treatment with 
KIOVIG.  A  two  year  follow-up  study  was  conducted  in  these  patients  to  document  the  long-term 
efficacy and tolerability of KIOVIG. During this follow-up period, efficacy was evaluated by measuring 
the  same  parameters  of  impairment  and  disability  as  those  monitored  during  the  main  phase  of  the 
study. 
The treatment doses per patient are indicated in the table below.

In  comparison  with  infusion  times  for  the  GAMMAGARD  S/D  treatment,  infusion  time  for  KIOVIG 
remained  the  same  in  3  patients  (15%),  was  reduced  up  to  two-fold  in  12  patients  (60%)  and  was 
reduced  more  than  two-fold  in  5  patients  (25%).  As  it  would  be  expected  of  a  10%  solution,  mean 
infusion time with KIOVIG was significantly shorter than with GAMMAGARD S/D (2.5 hours compared 
to 4.5 hours). 
Initial treatment of MMN (Study II) 
Patients  received  a  first  five-day  course  of  KIOVIG  at  a  cumulative  dose  of  2  g/kg  body  weight  (0.4 
g/kg  for  5  consecutive  days).  To  document  the  extent  and  duration  of  the  effect  of  this  first  IVIg 
treatment course, the patients were followed until muscle strength returned to pre-treatment levels. At 
that time, a second full course of IVIg treatment (0.4 g/kg for 5 consecutive days) was given and IVIg 
maintenance treatment was then initiated (0.4 g/kg every 2-4 weeks).

  Objectives 
MMN Conversion Study (Study I) 
This  study  aimed  to  switch  MMN  patients  who  were  successfully  treated  with  GAMMAGRAD  S/D  to 
treatment with KIOVIG. 
Assessment report  
Page 10/40
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that KIOVIG was clinically equivalent to GAMMAGARD S/D 
in the maintenance treatment of MMN. This was evaluated by muscle strength, which was documented 
using a modified Medical Research Council (MRC) scale.  
Additionally, functional impairment was assessed using Guy’s Neurological Disability Scale (GNDS) and 
Self Evaluation Scales and long-term efficacy and adverse effects were evaluated.  
Initial treatment of MMN (Study II) 
The primary objective was to evaluate whether KIOVIG was effective in the initial treatment of MMN. 
Efficacy was evaluated using MRC sum scores.  
Secondary objectives of this study were the evaluation of long-term efficacy (up to 3 years).  
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy in both studies was evaluated using two primary endpoints: 
(a)  Muscle  strength:  A  modified  Medical  Research  Council  (MRC)  sum  score  of  ten  muscle  groups 
(shoulder  abduction,  elbow  flexion,  elbow  extension,  wrist  flexion,  wrist  extension,  hip  flexion,  knee 
flexion, knee extension, foot dorsiflexion, foot plantar flexion, on both sides) to measure impairment. 
MRC  scores  range  from  0  (no  contraction)  to  5  (normal  power)  and  the  total  score  (max.  100)  was 
calculated  by  summing  up  the  individual  scores.  Subjects  are  defined  as  responders  if  the  MRC  sum 
scores remain stable. 
(b)  Disability  (“functional  impairment”)  as  monitored  using  the  Guy’s  Neurologic  Disability  Scale 
(GNDS) and a Self-Evaluation Scale. 
MRC scores were tested 10 days after IVIg administration. For patients in the treatment initiation study, 
a second full course of IVIg was administered when muscle strength returned to pre-treatment levels 
and initiation of maintenance treatment is provided. 
Clinical efficacy was evaluated by using the definitions of clinical improvement, decline and stability in 
the patient’s condition listed in following table. Endpoints were evaluated by the same investigator at 
all visits.

A patient was considered as a responder if muscle strength remained unchanged when switching from 
Gammagard SD to KIOVIG (Conversion study I) or if IVIg could not be stopped without worsening of 
muscle strength (Study I and II). 
MMN Conversion Study (Study I) 
MRC sum scores as measured with GAMMAGARD at baseline (t=-2), after 6 (t=-1) and after 12 (t=0) 
weeks were compared with scores at 6 (t=1), 18 (t=2) and 36 weeks (t=3) after initiation of KIOVIG 
treatment as well as at the end of the 2 year maintenance phase in a descriptive manner. 
Initial treatment of MMN (Study II) 
MRC sum scores were provided for five time points:  
-  at baseline (before the 1st course of treatment) 
-  4-6 weeks after the 1st course of treatment (when the maximal effect on muscle strength was 
observed) 
-  Before the 2nd treatment course (return of muscle strength to pre-treatment level) 
-  After the 2nd course of treatment 
-  At last follow-up examination (after 1-3 years of maintenance treatment) 
Additionally,  a  descriptive  analysis  of  the  response  to  KIOVIG  on  functional  impairment  (regarding 
daily life activities) was presented for each of the eight subjects. 
Dynamometry 
In addition to the MRC sum score, the isometric strength of muscles was also evaluated by hand-held 
dynamometry (HHD). HHD measurements were obtained on a selection of those muscles with an MRC 
score  >3  and  <5  at  any  time.  This  range  was  chosen  because  muscles  with  an  MRC  of  5  (normal 
strength)  are  unlikely  to  demonstrate  improvement,  and  those  with  an  MRC  of  ≤3  are  too  weak  to 
adequately measure using a hand-held dynamometer. 
As  with  MRC  scores,  an  average  of  3  measurements  after  treatment  with  GAMMAGARD  S/D  (and 
before treatment with KIOVIG) was compared to the average of 3 measurements post-treatment with 
KIOVIG. 
  Sample size 
There was no formal sample size calculation. 
  Randomisation 
Not applicable as both studies were uncontrolled single-arm trials.  
  Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable as both studies were open-label. 
  Statistical methods 
Only a descriptive analysis was presented for both clinical studies.  
For  statistical  analysis  the  mean  of  3  MRC  sum  scores  was  calculated.  The  rationale  was  to  test  the 
hypothesis  that  the  mean  MRC  sum  score  was  similar  during  GAMMAGARD  and  KIOVIG  treatment 
periods.  Because  of  non-normality  of  the  data  distribution  and  the  relatively  small  sample  size,  a 
conservative approach using the Wilcoxon signed rank test was chosen. The Wilcoxon signed rank test 
Assessment report  
Page 12/40
 
 
   
 
was  used  because  distributional  assumptions  of  parametric  tests,  including  the  t-test,  could  not  be 
satisfied. 
Results 
  Conduct of the study 
No major amendments were made to the protocol. 
The MMN Conversion study (Study I) was conducted between 2007–2008 (follow-up study: 2007-2010) 
at the University Medical Centre in Utrecht, The Netherlands. The study protocol received IEC approval 
in March 2006. The Initial Treatment of MMN study (Study II) was conducted at the same site between 
2007-2010. 
  Baseline data 
MMN Conversion Study (Study I) 
The  study  population  consisted  of  20  adults  (4  female,  16  male)  with  definite  or  probable  MMN  who 
were in a stable clinical condition and had been receiving maintenance therapy with GAMMAGARD S/D 
for at least 12 months. The mean age of the patients included was 53 (range: 37-67) and there was a 
male to female ratio of 4:1. MRC sum scores as assessed prior to KIOVIG treatment ranged from 81.06 
to 98.38. Dosing of GAMMAGARD varied from 0.10 g/kg/week to 0.49 g/kg/week.

  Numbers analysed 
MMN Conversion study (Study I) 
The data of all 20 patients were analysed throughout the 12 month maintenance study (intent-to-treat 
population, ITT). Nineteen (19) of them continued on KIOVIG with the two-year follow up period. One 
patient  (pt  number  10)  decided  to  switch  back  to  GAMMAGARD  S/D  due  to  dizziness  that  he 
experienced on KIOVIG.  
Initial treatment of MMN (Study II) 
Data of 8 patients were analysed regarding efficacy after a first full course of KIOVIG (cumulative dose 
2 g/kg). Seven of those continued KIOVIG treatment for the subsequent follow-up period. One patient 
remained stable after an initial loading dose and did not start on maintenance treatment. Therefore he 
was not further assessed during the follow-up phase.  
  Outcomes and estimation 
MMN Conversion study (Study I) 
Results  were  presented  as  a  tabular  listing  and  a  descriptive  comparison  of  the  MRC  sum  scores  as 
measured with GAMMAGARD at baseline (t=-2), after 6 (t=-1) and after 12 (t=0) weeks and 6 (t=1), 
18 (t=2) and 36 weeks (t=3) after KIOVIG was initiated (2007).

Self-Evaluation Scale 
In  the  conversion  study  (Study  I),  GAMMAGARD  maintenance  treatment  could  be  converted 
successfully to long-term KIOVIG maintenance treatment in 19 out of 20 (95% (95% CI 85.5 - 100%)) 
MMN  patients.  The  MAH concluded  that  results  of this  study  show  that  muscle  strength and  disability 
(“functional impairment”) were comparable between the treatment period with GAMMAGARD S/D and 
KIOVIG (Wilcoxon signed-rank test for MRC sum score analysis, p=0.126) (Cats et al 2008). There is 
no  data  documenting  on-  and  off-treatment  with  KIOVIG  since  the  study  was  not  designed  to  assess 
such  fluctuations.  Nevertheless,  the  results  from  another  clinical  MMN  trial  have  been  submitted  as 
supportive data (see below). 
The  presented  results  indicate  that  the  majority  of patients  remained  relatively  stable  after  switching 
from  GAMMAGARD  to  KIOVIG,  with  an  identical  number  of  patients  either  worsening  or  improving 
slightly within the observation period. 
Long-term effect of KIOVIG (MMN conversion study): 
Nineteen out of 20 MMN patients participated in the long-term follow up part of the study. The results 
after 2 additional years of KIOVIG treatment (2010) are presented in the table below. 
Assessment report  
Page 16/40
 
 
   
 
 
 
Table 13. 
Long-term effect on muscle strength and disability  
One  patient  (pt  number  10)  did  not  enter  the  long-term  follow-up  phase  because  he  experienced 
dizziness on KIOVIG, even at a low infusion rate. This patient was switched back to GAMMAGARD S/D. 
Twenty percent of subjects required slightly higher doses of KIOVIG compared with GAMMAGARD. One 
patient was clinically stable while using a slightly lower dose.  
The MAH concluded that three patients worsened >1 MRC grade on their MRC sum score (pt number 1, 
2, 20) on KIOVIG in 2010 compared to 2007. Three patients improved >1 MRC grade on their MRC 
sum score (pt number 4, 14, 19) on KIOVIG in 2010 compared to 2007. Three patients worsened 1 
point on the Guy's disability score on KIOVIG in 2010 compared to 2007 (pt number 9, 17, 20) and 
three patients worsened one point on the Self Evaluation Scale on KIOVIG in 2010 compared to 2007 
(pt number 9, 17,18). Four patients with MMN used a slightly higher dose (5 g per 1 to 3 weeks) of 
KIOVIG in 2010 compared to 2007 (pt number 1, 2, 4, 20). One patient used a slightly lower dose of 
KIOVIG in 2010 compared to 2007 (pt number 11). 
The  MAH  pointed  out  that  disease  progression  cannot  be  completely  halted  by  IVIg  treatment  and 
response  to  IVIg  treatment  mildly  decreases  over  time,  which  is  likely  to  be  a  result  of  progressive 
axonal  loss.  Additionally,  the  MAH  clarified  that  in  the  GAMMAGARD  to  KIOVIG  conversion  study  the 
dose of IVIg remained the same without worsening of muscle strength over a nine months follow-up of 
Assessment report  
Page 17/40
 
 
 
   
 
KIOVIG treatment. After another two years of KIOVIG treatment the dose had to be increased slightly 
(5 gram per 1-3 weeks) in 4 patients (patient 1: from 0.18 in 2007 to 0.21 g/kg/wk in 2010; patient 2: 
from  0.49  in  2007  to  0.56  g/kg/wk  in  2010;  patient  4:  from  0.15  in  2007  to  0.17  g/kg/wk  in  2010; 
and patient 20: from 0.27 in 2007 to 0.30 g/kg/wk in 2010). Taken together, a slight increase of IVIg 
dose  was  not  specific  for  a  liquid  formulation  such  as  KIOVIG,  but  due  to  the  natural  course  of  the 
disease.  
Dynamometry data 
Supplemental post-hoc analysis of data was provided by the applicant during the procedure. The MAH 
stated  that  in  all  but  one  of  the  20  patients  monitored,  pooled  dynamometry  measurements  for  all 
muscle  groups  tested  indicated  improved  muscle  strength  when  switching  from  GAMMAGARD  S/D  to 
KIOVIG.  The  average  improvement  in  muscle  strength  for  all  20  patients  was  ~36%  in  proximal 
muscles (shoulder abductors; elbow flexors and extensors; hip flexors; knee extensors and flexors and 
~18% in distal muscles (wrist flexors and extensors; foot dorsiflexors and plantar flexors). 
Initial treatment of MMN (Study II) 
The MRC sum scores for each patient are presented in the table below. 
Table 14.  MRC sum scores in MMN patients (Study II) 
Assessment report  
Page 18/40
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
The  maximal  effect  of  IVIg  treatment  was  reported  at  4-6  weeks  after  the  first  full  course  of  IVIg 
treatment. Before the second treatment course (5-12 weeks after the first full course), the MRC sum 
score returned to the pretreatment levels in all patients; the MRC sum scores were inferior to the MRC 
sum score measured at baseline in 6 patients (data not available for patients 4 and 8). The maximal 
effect  of  IVIg  treatment  after  the  1st  and  the  2nd  full  course  of  IVIg  treatment  were  identical  for  6 
patients (data not available for patients 4 and 8). 
After  one  to  three  years  of  maintenance  treatment,  the  MRC  sum  score  was  equal  (n=6  patients)  or 
superior  (n=1  patient)  to  the  score  measured  at  the  maximal  effect  (4-6  weeks  after  the  1st  full 
course) (data not available for patient 8). According to the MAH, these individual results demonstrate 
that muscle strength decreased when IVIg infusions were withheld and therefore that fluctuations were 
related to phases on-treatment and off-treatment. 
As  seen  with  the  MRC  sum  score,  there  was  an  improvement  in  disability  for  the  upper  limbs  (Guy’s 
score decreased) after the first full IVIg course in 7 out of the 8 patients, which then deteriorated to 
the pretreatment levels before the second treatment (for patient 8, the score remained the same). The 
maximal effect of IVIg treatment for the upper limb Guy’s score after the 1st and the 2nd full course of 
IVIg treatment were identical for 6 patients (data not available for patients 4 and 8). After one to three 
years  of  maintenance  treatment,  the  upper  limb  Guy’s  score  was  equal  (n=  7  patients)  to  the  score 
measured after the maximal effect (4-6 weeks after the 1st full course) (data not available for patient 
8). 
The  lower  limb  disability  score  at  baseline  was  low  (0  or  1)  in  7  out  of  8  patients  and  remained 
unchanged  throughout  the  study.  In  patient  2  (the  only  patient  who  had  onset  of  the  disease  in  the 
Assessment report  
Page 19/40
 
 
 
   
 
lower  limbs),  the  Guy’s  score  was  2  at  baseline,  decreased  to  1  after  the  1st  full  IVIg  treatment, 
returned  to  the  pretreatment  levels  before  the  2nd  treatment  and  responded  to  the  2nd  IVIg  full 
course with a score of 1, a score which was maintained throughout the long-term follow-up period. 
In summary, the MAH concluded that the response rate in the treatment initiation study (Study II) was 
100%.  The  response  to  KIOVIG  was  similar  to  experience  with  GAMMAGARD  and  consistent  with 
published literature on other products. 
Regarding  the  overall  efficacy  of  KIOVIG  in  MMN,  the  Applicant  argued  that  the  efficacy  results  from 
Study  I  and  Study  II  are  consistent  with  the  published  results  from  other  studies  that  document 
efficacy  fluctuation  related  to  IVIg  infusion  (Van  den  Berg  et  al.,  1995;  Van  den  Berg  et  al.  1998, 
Harbo et al., 2009). 
One of the four placebo-controlled studies submitted as supportive evidence for the efficacy of KIOVIG 
in MMN evaluated the effect of an IVIg from the Central Laboratory Blood Transfusion, Amsterdam, in 
six  patients  with  MMN  (Van  den  Berg  et  al.,  1995).  Although  this  study  was  not  performed  with 
KIOVIG, 5 out of 6 patients in this study continued in a “maintenance study”, in which they received 
regular  IV  infusions  of  GAMMAGARD  (Baxter).  The  MAH  argued  that  the  efficacy  results  with 
GAMMAGARD can be extrapolated to KIOVIG for the following reasons: 
-  The  results  of  the  MMN  Conversion  study  (Study  I)  had  shown  that  clinical  efficacy  of  Kiovig  and 
Gammagard  was  comparable,  and  that  changes  in  muscle  strength  observed  were  reflective  of 
normal fluctuations for MMN patients treated with IVIg. 
-  Gammagard is similar to Kiovig in their IgG subclass distribution and in their efficacy (pre-clinical) 
Furthermore,  a  randomised  single-blinded  cross-over  study  conducted  on  10  MMN  IVIg  pre-treated 
patients reported efficacy of 2 IVIg products from Baxter: Subcuvia, administered subcutaneously and 
Endobulin  (Harbo  et  al.,  2009).  During  pre-study  phase,  a  prolonged  treatment  free-IVIg  interval 
(maximal 10 weeks) was initiated in order to confirm responsiveness to IVIg for all patients (defined as 
at  least  10%  dynamometric  decline  of  strength  of  one  or  more  muscle  groups  as  compared  to  a 
baseline value assessed half way between the two previous regular doses of IVIg). During this period, 
a significant decrease in muscle strength of 14% ± 11% (P<0.005) was observed, which subsequently 
improved during the randomised part of the study (with IVIg responsive patients). 
  Ancillary analyses 
In  response  to  the  CHMP’s  request  to  further  justify  the  robustness  of  the  clinical  data  provided,  the 
MAH provided the results of a post-hoc analysis comparing the efficacy results from Study II against a 
historical placebo control. 
Data  from  the  randomized,  placebo-controlled  trial  in  MMN  patients  published  by  Léger  et  al  (2001) 
were  used  to  provide  a  historical  placebo  group.  In  this  placebo-controlled  study  18  treatment-naïve 
patients  were  included  (9  were  treated  with  Endobulin  and  9  received  placebo).  Treatment  response 
was  evaluated  after  an  initial  3  months  of  placebo/IVIg  treatment  and  “responders”  were  defined  as 
patients with an improvement of at least one point on the MRC score in at least two muscles together 
with a reduction of at least 1 point in two activities of daily life compared to baseline. This definition is 
identical  to  the  definition  of  “improvement”  in  the  two  Baxter  studies  submitted.  According  to  the 
results from the study by Léger et al 78% (95% CI= 44-93%) of IVIg-treated patients (7/9) and 22% 
(95% CI= 7-55%) of placebo-treated patients (2/9) were responders. The results from Study II show 
that  all  8  patients  (100%,  95%  CI=66-100%)  experienced  improvement  in  muscle  strength  and 
disability  following  an  initial  course  of  treatment  with  KIOVIG  (2g/kg).  This  improvement  rate, 
Assessment report  
Page 20/40
 
 
 
   
 
expressed  as  mean  with  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs),  was  compared  with  the  historical  placebo 
responder  rate.  The  66%  lower  CI  for  treatment  improvement  in  Study  II  was  significantly  greater 
than  the  22%  responder  rate  in  the historical  placebo  group  (p<0.0001),  indicating  that  KIOVIG  was 
more effective than the historical placebo control in the treatment of MMN. In addition, the percentage 
of  responders  in  BAXTER’s  Study  II  and  the  IVIg-treated  group  from  Léger  et  al  (2001)  were 
comparable: 100% (95% CI=66-100%) for KIOVIG vs. 78% (95% CI= 44-93%) for Endobulin.

Feasibility of KIOVIG home treatment 
Thirty-six  (36)  MMN  patients  who  receive  KIOVIG  maintenance  treatment  at  home  filled  out  a 
questionnaire  regarding  time,  dose,  adverse  events,  and  practicality  of  home  treatment.  Advantages 
indicated  by  these  patients  were:  time  gain  (72%)  and  convenience  (94%)  or  other  (autonomy, 
presence  of  next  of  kin,  less  time  off  from  work,  no  hospital  atmosphere)  (19%).  Reported 
disadvantages  were:  absence  of  medical  staff  in  case  of  an  adverse  event  (28%),  problems  with  IV 
access or the infusion system (6%) or other (different nurses, logistic problems) (11 %). Six patients 
reported mild adverse events following IVIg infusions: headache (three patients), chills (two patients) 
and  mild  skin  rash  (one  patient).  No  serious  adverse  events  occurred  during  KIOVIG  home-therapy 
over a 3 year period.

Discussion of clinical efficacy 
A formal dose-finding study has not been conducted with KIOVIG in this indication, and the mechanism 
of  IVIg  in  autoimmune  disorders  has  not  been  fully  elucidated.  However,  the  doses  chosen  for  the 
submitted  clinical  trials  are  in  line  with  available  recommendations  and  treatment  guidelines  and 
therefore are considered acceptable by CHMP. 
CHMP  noted  that  MMN  is  a  chronic  condition  and  patients  may  worsen  long  term,  hereby  requiring 
continuous therapy. Therefore, the concept of the presented clinical study reports to demonstrate that 
KIOVIG is efficacious in both treatment initiation and maintenance therapy was endorsed by the CHMP. 
However,  the  MAH  chose  an  open-label  design  with  a  single  treatment  arm,  arguing  that  the  lack  of 
active comparator was dictated by EU clinical practices. The CHMP commented that generally, in order 
to  obtain  an  unbiased  estimate  of  the  size  of  the  treatment  effect,  randomization  to  placebo  or  an 
active  control  group  would  be  considered  necessary;  however,  the  difficulties  in  conducting  placebo-
controlled  MMN  trials  in  the  EU  were  acknowledged.  Given  the  open-label  study  design  of  the 
submitted studies with KIOVIG in MMN, the CHMP emphasized the need for a reliable endpoint in such 
a setting. Furthermore, the MAH was requested to further demonstrate how the potential risks of bias 
have  been  minimized.  CHMP  also  requested  the  MAH  to  further  justify  the  robustness  of  the  clinical 
data provided (see below). 
GCP  compliance  of  the  submitted  study  data  was  initially  questioned  by  the  CHMP.  During  the 
procedure,  the  MAH  has  provided  further  data  to  clarify  the  Committee’s  questions,  and  a  separate 
declaration has been provided by the MAH confirming that the KIOVIG studies in MMN submitted with 
this application have been conducted in compliance with GCP principles. 
CHMP  acknowledged  that,  given  the  rareness  of  the  condition,  a  sample  size  smaller  than  usually 
expected for confirmatory clinical trials might be acceptable.  
With regard to the chosen outcome measures, the MAH clarified that the two primary endpoints were 
muscle strength (MRC sum score) and functional impairment (Guy’s Neurological Disability Scale, Self 
Evaluation Scale) that were evaluated by the same investigator at all visits in order to reduce possible 
bias.  The  CHMP  concurred  that  muscle  strength  is  the  only  driver  of  disability  in  MMN  condition, 
therefore  an  evaluation  by  MRC  sum  score  is  an  acceptable  primary  outcome  measure.  MRC  sum 
scores are in widespread use in the published literature and routine clinical practice, although different 
numbers  of  muscle  groups  have  been  used  in  previous  studies  and  a  modified  MRC  scale  (assessing 
only ten pairs of muscles) was chosen for the two presented clinical trials. 
The MRC sum score was originally reported by Kleyweg et al. in 1991 (using 6 bilateral muscle groups) 
and  has  since  been  used  in  modified  forms  with  up  to  28  muscles  in  various  other  clinical  studies  in 
MMN. However, the CHMP expressed concerns that the MRC score assessing only 20 muscles as used 
by the MAH fails to take into account several distal motor functions which are considered important for 
impairment due to MMN, such as fist closure, and thumb abduction. This might cause difficulties with 
ensuring a comprehensive and clinically meaningful assessment of the treatment effect. 
In their initial response, the MAH argued that additional testing of intrinsic hand muscles would not add 
any  value,  since  these  muscles  were  most  likely  to  have  suffered  axonal  damage  and  would  be  the 
least likely to respond to treatment. Neck muscles were not affected in MMN, therefore assessing these 
would be unessential. In the second response, the applicant submitted data showing that grip strength 
had improved in response to Kiovig administration. The CHMP considered the response on grip strength 
acceptable. 
Assessment report  
Page 24/40
 
 
 
   
 
Addressing  an  initial  concern  from  CHMP,  the  MAH  confirmed  during  the  procedure  that  the  efficacy 
data for KIOVIG submitted with this application was collected from prospectively-designed studies. In 
addition,  the  MAH  detailed  a  number  of  precautionary  measures  which  were  undertaken  in  order  to 
minimize  bias  and  to  improve  quality  of  data  (e.g.  assessments  by  same  investigator  at  all  visits, 
analysis of ITT population, evaluation of 10 pre-defined muscle pairs). Furthermore, dynamometry was 
performed  in  selected  muscle  groups  and  the  results  provided  during  the  procedure;  the  data  is 
considered supportive for clinical improvement in the opinion of the CHMP.  
Regarding the results of the MMN Conversion study, the CHMP had questioned whether the observation 
that  patients  remained  stable  after  switching  from  GAMMAGARD  to  KIOVIG  could  be  considered 
sufficient evidence, since efficacy in MMN treatment has not been established with GAMMAGARD so far. 
Therefore,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  longitudinal  data  from  both  studies  which  could 
demonstrate that muscle strength decreased when IVIg infusions were withheld. 
Additional longitudinal data has subsequently been provided by the MAH for Study II in the treatment 
initiation setting (see below). There was no data documenting on- and off-treatment with KIOVIG from 
Study I since the study was not designed to assess such fluctuations. However, the MAH argued that 
considering that the treatment effect with IVIg lasts 5-12 weeks after an infusion (as shown in Study 
II), in case of loss of treatment effect, KIOVIG would have been shown to be ineffective, especially in 
the 2 year follow-up period, a result that was not observed in this study. 
The efficacy of KIOVIG in treatment initiation was determined in 8 patients with MMN, whose treatment 
was  started  after  the  year  2007.  All  8  patients  experienced  improvement  in  muscle  strength  and 
functionality  following  initial  course  of  treatment  with  KIOVIG  (2  g/kg).  A  single  individual  did  not 
require continued treatment, while the remaining 7 patients receive continued KIOVIG treatment. The 
data  obtained  from  those  8  patients  were  compared  with  a  historical  control,  i.e.  patients  who  had 
received  their  initial  courses  with  GAMMGARD  S/D.  None  of  these  patients  were  non-responders  to 
KIOVIG. Based on the experience with IVIg in general, a response rate of approx. 80% to initial IVIg 
treatment is expected. The literature review provided by the company is supportive of the IVIg efficacy 
in MMN patients. 
The lack of long-term follow-up data for patient no. 8 was noted. This data would have been helpful to 
better  understand  the  “natural  course  of  the  disease”  without  a  continuous  maintenance  treatment, 
especially as this is a single-arm study and no patients have been randomized to a control-group. 
However, taken altogether, the Applicant provided sufficient longitudinal data to demonstrate a decline 
in  muscle  strength  after  cessation  of  both  KIOVIG  and  GAMMAGARD  infusions.  This  effect  has  also 
been  observed  with  another  IVIg  preparation  (Subcuvia).  These  data  are  considered  supportive  and 
the Applicant’s argumentation is considered acceptable. 
Given  the  available  published  literature  on  IVIg  use  in  MMN,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  justify  to  which 
extent the efficacy data from other IVIg products could be extrapolated. The MAH provided a summary 
of  published  evidence  and  guidelines  from  various  learned  bodies  that  advocate  IVIg  as  first-line 
therapy  for  the  treatment  of  MMN  and  concluded  that  different  IVIg  preparations  –  despite 
pharmaceutical  differences  such  as  osmolality,  product  concentration  and  composition  –  can  be 
considered  therapeutically  equivalent,  but  may  differ  in  safety  profiles.  Indeed,  recommendations  for 
off-label  use  of  intravenous  immunoglobulin  products  are  also  not  product-specific,  and  therefore 
suggest product interchangeability and therapeutic equivalence. 
The  CHMP  concurred  with  the  Applicant’s  argumentation  that  the  extrapolation  of  efficacy  data 
generated  with  different  IVIg  products  could  be  supportive  for  the  approval  of  KIOVIG  in  addition  to 
the efficacy data specifically generated with KIOVIG. 
Assessment report  
Page 25/40
 
 
   
 
The  applicant  presented  data  on  use  of  IVIg  in  CIDP  as  supportive  for  the  current  application.  The 
presented CIDP study is considered by the CHMP as useful for a comparison of the safety of both IVIg 
preparations,  but  it  is  not  considered  adequate  for  making  a  conclusion  on  the  efficacy  of  KIOVIG  in 
MMN patients. 
The  Applicant  provided  during  the  assessment  data  from  the  Dutch  national  MMN  database 
demonstrate  that  IVIg  already  are  widespread  used  in  MMN  therapy.  The  data  are  considered 
supportive  for  the  high  acceptance  of  this  treatment  by  both  patients  and  treating  physicians. 
However,  CHMP  did  not  consider  them  adequate  to  draw  conclusions  on  the  efficacy  of  IVIg  in  MMN, 
especially when taking the remarkable number of clinically stable patients without IVIg treatment into 
account. 
Based on the available data from the studies with KIOVIG and the supportive data published for other 
IVIg preparations, it can be accepted that sufficient evidence has been generated to show that KIOVIG 
is effective in the treatment of MMN. Overall, the available data is considered limited. The Committee 
noted that another clinical study is currently being conducted by the applicant (study 160604). This is 
a  randomized  placebo-controlled  study  using  grip  strength  as  primary  endpoint.  As  of  January  2011, 
32  patients  have  completed  the  study  of  44  that  were  able  to  participate;  a  final  study  report  is 
expected  in  September  2012.  The  Committee  considered  it  important  to  review  these  data  once 
available  as  it  would  further  substantiate  the  available  data  from  prospective  clinical  trials  in  this 
indication. The MAH was therefore asked to provide this study report and also to commit to providing 
detailed safety and efficacy data from study 160604 in KIOVIG PSURs. 
Conclusion on the clinical efficacy 
Overall,  results  for  KIOVIG  from  2  prospective  studies  with  this  product  and  supportive  data  from 
randomized,  placebo-controlled  MMN  trials  with  other  IVIg  products  provide  evidence  indicating  that 
KIOVIG is effective in the treatment of MMN. 
In  summary,  CHMP  considers  that  the  MAH  has  provided  data  obtained  from  prospectively  planned 
clinical  trials,  that  the  data  comply  with  relevant  EMA  guidelines  and  that  the  data  are  of  a  standard 
that would support the current application. Acknowledging the limitations of the available efficacy data 
for KIOVIG in MMN the CHMP considers the results of the randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Study 
160604) currently ongoing in the US as critical to corroborate the efficacy and safety of KIOVIG in the 
treatment of patients with MMN.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
In order to further substantiate the efficacy and safety of KIOVIG in the treatment of Multifocal motor 
neuropathy  (MMN),  the  MAH  shall  submit  the  final  Clinical  Study  Report  of  the  ongoing  randomized 
placebo-controlled study in MMN patients (Study 160604) by 30 September 2012. 
Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In  the  EU,  KIOVIG  (ready  to  use  solution  for  infusion)  was  approved  for  the  indications  of  the  Core 
SmPC on 19 January 2006. The safety and tolerability of KIOVIG in the currently approved indications 
is well established and are similar to those of other marketed IVIg products.

The  estimated  patient  exposure  from  completed  studies  with  KIOVIG  in  MMN  (Study  I  +  II)  is 
summarized in the table below. 
In  addition,  patients  with  MMN  are  being  treated  with  KIOVIG  in  the  ongoing  Study  160604.  The 
cumulative exposure across all three trials, stratified by duration, is indicated in the following table:

Adverse events 
In the MMN Conversion study 7 out of 19 patients (35%) reported side effects with 10% liquid IVIg. All 
events  were  classified  as  non-serious  and  included  skin  reactions,  fatigue  and  –  most  commonly  – 
headache. One patient switched back to GAMMAGARD due to dizziness even with low infusion rates.  
Data on Safety as reported in the Cochrane Database review on IVIg in MMN:  
Adverse  events  reported  following  IGIV  treatment  in  patients  with  MMN  generally  reflect  safety  data 
listed in the Core SmPC for IVIg as well as in the SmPC for KIOVIG that has been approved in Europe. 
The  most  common  reactions  are  headache,  rash,  fever  and  shivering.  Only  2  serious  adverse  events 
have been reported in literature (1 case of transient ischemic attack and 1 case of aseptic meningitis.) 
Three  randomized,  controlled  studies  have  examined  the  safety  of  IVIg  products  for  short-term 
treatment of patients with MMN. With respect to long-term use of IVIg products in patients with MMN, 
safety data are available from four placebo-controlled clinical studies.

Discussion of clinical safety 
The  safety  and  tolerability  of  KIOVIG  for  the  currently  approved  indications  are  well  studied  and 
accompanied with substantial post-marketing safety database.  
An analysis of controlled studies on IVIg therapy in MMN 10 estimated a pooled relative risk of adverse 
events for IVIg therapy compared to placebo of 10.33 (95% CI interval: 2.15-49.77). 
Only limited data on safety for KIOVIG in MMN are available. The safety data reported in patients with 
MMN in published studies included all AEs listed in the current SmPC. Main reported AEs were skin rash, 
headache, dizziness, fever, shivering and fatigue. It is not expected that the AE profile for KIOVIG in 
MMN will significantly differ from that already known for immunoglobulin treatment from literature and 
what was seen with KIOVIG in clinical studies. Although the AE profile of IVIg also depends on dosage 
and infusion rates, neither more AE nor more severe AE have been seen with KIOVIG compared with 
GAMMAGARD in the MMN Conversion study. Equivalent safety profiles for KIOVIG and GAMMAGARD for 
maintenance treatment have even been reported in CIDP patients. 
The applicant is currently conducting another clinical study in MMN patients (study 160604). This is a 
randomized  placebo-controlled  study  therefore  providing  additional  safety  data  for  this  patient 
population.  The  Committee  considered  it  important  to  review  these  data  once  available  as  it  would 
further substantiate the available safety data. 
CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  adverse  events  reported  following  IVIg  treatment  in  patients  with  MMN 
generally  reflect  the  safety  data  listed  in  the  Core  SmPC  for  IVIg  as  well  as  in  the  SmPC  for  KIOVIG 
that is currently approved in Europe. 
Conclusion on clinical safety 
The nature and frequency of adverse events reported by the applicant for KIOVIG when administered 
to  subjects  with  multifocal  motor  neuropathy  is  in  accordance  with  the  pattern  of  adverse  events 
described in the literature for other IVIg products. All adverse events are already included in the SPC. 
Additional  data  on  safety  will  be  submitted  by  the  applicant  as  part  of  the  final  Clinical  Study  Report 
that results from the ongoing randomised  placebo-controlled study (study 160604) on use of KIOVIG 
in subjects with multifocal motor neuropathy. Study 160604 is expected to be completed in September 
2012.

indicated in patients with selective IgA deficiency 
where the IgA deficiency is the only abnormality 
of concern.” 
“Rarely, human normal immunoglobulin can 
induce a fall in blood pressure with anaphylactic 
reaction, even in patients who had tolerated 
previous treatment with human normal 
immunoglobulin.” 
“Potential complications can often be avoided by 
ensuring: 
  that patients are not sensitive to human 
normal immunoglobulin by first infusing the 
product slowly (0.01 ml/kg BW/min); 
  that patients are carefully monitored for any 
symptoms throughout the infusion period. In 
particular, patients naive to human normal 
immunoglobulin, patients switched from an 
alternative IVIg product or when there has 
been a long interval since the previous infusion 
should be monitored during the first infusion 
and for the first hour after the first infusion, in 
order to detect potential adverse signs. All 
other patients should be observed for at least 
20 minutes after administration.”

“KIOVIG is made from human plasma.  Standard 
measures to prevent infections resulting from the 
use of medicinal products prepared from human 
blood or plasma include selection of donors, 
screening of individual donations and plasma 
pools for specific markers of infection and the 
inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the 
inactivation/removal of viruses.  Despite this, 
when medicinal products prepared from human 
blood or plasma are administered, the possibility 
of transmitting infectious agents cannot be totally 
excluded.  This also applies to unknown or 
emerging viruses and other pathogens.” 
“The measures taken are considered effective for 
enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV, and 
for the non-enveloped viruses HAV and parvovirus

“There is reassuring clinical experience regarding 
the lack of hepatitis A or Parvovirus B19

Overall conclusion and Benefit-risk assessment 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Multifocal  motor  neuropathy  is  a  recently-described  motor  neuropathy  with  an  incidence  of  (about)  6 
per  million  people  and  that  affects  adults  in  the  age  range  20  to  55yrs.  Men  are  more  commonly 
affected  than  women.  There  are  not  any  known  pre-disposing  factors  and  the  underlying  aetiology  is 
uncertain. Motor nerves are affected in a piece-meal fashion leading to an asymmetric weakness that 
(in  about  70%  of  cases)  presents  with  weakness  of  the  intrinsic  muscles  of  a  hand.  Symptoms  are 
more  evident  than  signs  in  the  initial  stages  of  the  illness.  The  natural  history  of  the  disease  is  for 
slowly progressive weakness and atrophy of affected muscles with associated impaired quality of life. 
Diagnosis of multifocal motor neuropathy is by a combination of a typical clinical history supplemented 
by  nerve  conduction  studies  and  assessment  of  muscle  strength.  The  presence  of  anti-GM  antibodies 
may supplement the diagnosis. 
Acceptable outcome measures of treatment of multifocal motor neuropathy would be increased muscle 
strength (of  those muscles affected) and less functional disability associated with improved quality of 
life. 
Evidence of benefit of treatment with IVIg is thus far limited. For this reason, all applications for IVIg 
in  the  indication  for  multifocal  motor  neuropathy  required  to  be  accompanied  by  persuasive  data  on 
increased muscle strength in response to treatment. 
In  the  present  application,  the  results  from  two,  prospective,  uncontrolled,  open-label,  investigator-
initiated  trials  were  submitted  showing  that  intermittent  intravenous  infusion  of  KIOVIG  in  (i)  the 
initiation  and  (ii)  maintenance  of  treatment  of  patients  with  multifocal  motor  neuropathy  resulted  in 
Assessment report  
Page 36/40
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
increased muscle strength (assessed by MRC scores, dynamometry and grip strength) and a reduction 
in reported disability (as assessed by the Guy’s scale of disability and self-assessment). 
The initiation trial involved 8 subjects who were naïve to treatment with IVIg. Patients received a five-
day course of KIOVIG at a cumulative dose of 2g/kg body weight. Maintenance doses for the 7 subjects 
entering  the  long-term  follow-up  phase  of  the  study  were  chosen  by  individual  response.  MRC  sum 
scores were measured at baseline, after the first full course of IVIg (cumulative dose 2g/kg) and after 
the last follow-up examination of the long-term treatment phase. Additionally, a descriptive analysis of 
the  response  to  KIOVIG  on  functional  impairment  (regarding  daily  life  activities)  was  presented  for 
each  of  the  eight  subjects.  Subjects  achieved  up  to  4  points  increase  in  MRC  score  in  response  to 
Kiovig treatment: response was persistent for the duration of the trial (12 months). 
The maintenance trial involved 20 subjects who were transferred from GAMMAGARD s/d (an alternate 
IVIg  preparation  licensed  for  use  in  MMN  in  the  Netherlands)  to  KIOVIG  at  an  equivalent  dose. 
Treatment with KIOVIG was shown to maintain muscle strength for the duration of the conversion (9 
months). 
The  MAH  also  submitted  a  review  of  published  literature  on  the  use  of  IVIg  in  the  management  of 
multifocal motor neuropathy. 
The numbers of subjects enrolled into the two studies submitted were too small to consider sub-group 
analysis. The applicant justified not doing a comparator study on the grounds that cyclophosphamide 
(the only recognised comparator with reported efficacy) would be easy for investigator and subject to 
tell apart from KIOVIG on the basis of side-effects. 
Overall, the data package provided was considered sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of 
KIOVIG  in  MMN,  and  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  the  EMA  guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of 
IVIgs. 
It was considered that additional data submitted by the applicant on the efficacy of KIOVIG use in CIDP 
and on the Dutch national database of subjects with multifocal motor neuropathy did not support the 
current application. 
Furthermore,  the  MAH  provided  information  showing  that  home-infusion  of  KIOVIG  was  widely 
accepted by patients and that although only a minority self-infused, patients welcomed advantages of 
home-treatment  such  as  time  gain  and  convenience.  Occurrence,  frequency  and  severity  of  adverse 
events in home treated patients were comparable to those in the hospital setting. 
As  home  IVIg  administration  has  been  in  existence  since  the  1980s,  and  guidance  material  already 
exists,  no  additional  risks  associated  with  KIOVIG  for  MMN  or  any  other  indication  foreseen,  and  risk 
minimisation activities are therefore not required. However, the available safety information on home 
infusion and criteria for patient selection should be included in the next RMP update. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  IVIgs  in  MMN  has  not  been  elucidated,  leaving  an  uncertainty  as  to  the 
pharmacodynamics.  This  is  true  for  all  “immunomodulatory”  indications  and  therefore  more  basic 
research  would  be  of  essence.  Nevertheless,  the  use  of  IVIg  in  MMN  is  recommended  in  relevant 
treatment guidelines, and some efficacy data has been obtained for different formulations. 
The data on the efficacy of KIOVIG for the treatment of patients with MMN was derived from two open-
label, single arm clinical trials. There was no dose finding study; however, dose and dosing intervals in 
the  chronic  immunomodulatory  setting  are  generally  tailored  to  the  patient’s  needs.  The  open-label, 
Assessment report  
Page 37/40
 
 
 
   
 
uncontrolled  nature  of  the  two  studies  inherently  did  raise  concerns  regarding  the  robustness  of  the 
efficacy  data  submitted.  Also  there  were  uncertainties  regarding  the  MRC  score  system  used  by  the 
applicant  and  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  results  obtained.  However,  the  applicant  has  provided 
supplemental  data  on  (i)  dynamometry  of  large  muscle  groups  and  (ii)  grip  strength  in  response  to 
treatment. These data did mitigate these uncertainties leading to the conclusion that the limited data 
are reasonable re-assuring. 
There  is  lack  of  knowledge  of  the  long-term  use  of  KIOVIG  in  the  management  of  multifocal  motor 
neuropathy  (beyond  the  timescale  of  the  currently  submitted  trials)  and  whether  or  not  muscle 
weakness  may  remain  improved  or  continue  to  weaken  in  spite  of  treatment.  There  is  lack  of 
knowledge  on  whether  or  not  use  of  KIOVIG  would  prevent  involvement  of  motor  nerves  not  yet 
affected.  Furthermore,  there  is  lack  of  knowledge  on  the  overall  impact  of  KIOVIG  on  the  long-term 
quality  of  life  and  long-term  survival.  However,  it  may  be  expected  that  knowledge  of  the 
consequences  of  long-term  use  of  KIOVIG  may  be  gathered  through  surveillance  during  market 
exposure. 
Overall,  it  is  considered  the  available  data  for  KIOVIG  in  MMN  that  is  specifically  generated  for  this 
product  is  limited;  the  data  is  supported  by  data  from  other  IVIg  preparations  which  was  deemed 
acceptable.  Overall,  the  available  data  is  considered  sufficient  for  granting  the  indication  but  this 
limitation  has  been  reflected  in  the  RMP  as  important  missing  information.  Consequently,  the  CHMP 
considers  the  results  of  the  randomized,  placebo-controlled  trial  (Study  160604)  currently  ongoing  in 
the US as relevant to corroborate the efficacy and safety of KIOVIG in the treatment of patients with 
MMN.  The  provision  of  the  final  CSR  of  this  study  is  therefore  requested  as  a  condition  to  the 
marketing authorisation. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  AE  reported  with  KIOVIG  in  patients  with  MMN  reflect  what  has  been  reported  with  KIOVIG  in 
other  indications.  Side  effects  were  reported  in  35%  of  patients  and  included  skin  reactions,  fatigue 
and – most commonly- headache. All events were classified as non-serious and were reversible. All AE 
reported with KIOVIG in MMN patients are already listed in the SmPC.  
Therefore  it  is  not  expected  that  the  use  of  KIOVIG  for  the  treatment  of  MMN  will  have  an  altered 
safety profile.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety database from completed clinical trials with KIOVIG in MMN only covers 20 patients and is 
therefore relatively small. However, the data as provided with this application as well as what is known 
from other IVIgs in the treatment of MMN does not indicate a relevant change in the safety profile. 
The  limited  clinical  data  regarding  treatment  in  patients  with  MMN  has  been  identified  as  important 
missing  information  in  the  RMP.  Additional  safety  and  efficacy  data  will  be  provided  in  the  KIOVIG 
PSURs (reverted to 6 monthly cycle) as well as in the final CSR of the randomized, placebo-controlled 
study currently ongoing (Study 160604).

Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
MMN is a rare, progressive debilitating disease that most commonly affects distal upper limb muscles. 
Though rarely fatal, the disease causes significant functional disability that interferes with daily activity 
such  as  independent  eating,  grooming,  writing,  opening  and  locking  doors  and  holding  objects.  Any 
therapy  to  increase  muscle  strength  and  allow  the  patient  to  regain  independence  and  resume  a 
normal daily life is therefore essential. 
In the last 10 years literature studies and case reports have repeatedly shown a benefit for the use of 
IVIgs in this condition. Generally, the response rate seen is around 75%; over time an increase in IVIg 
dose  may  become  necessary  to  maintain  the  desired  effect.  This  has  now  been  confirmed  by  a 
“patchwork”  approach  of  the  company  who  submitted  data  with  two  forerunner  products  (Endobulin, 
GAMMAGARD)  and  their  current  product  (KIOVIG)  in  initiation  and  maintenance  settings,  a 
comprehensive analysis of the literature, and of the feasibility of extrapolation between products. 
Alternative treatment options are limited. Patients with MMN rarely respond to treatment with steroids 
and  plasma  exchange  and  may  even  worsen.  Mycophenolate  mofetil  is  ineffective.  Very  limited  data 
are available showing a weak positive effect of interferon and natalizumab, and a more positive effect 
with  rituximab.  Cyclophosphamide  appears  to  be  the  most  effective  treatment  apart  from  IVIg. 
However,  long-term  treatment  with  cyclophosphamide  is  restricted  due  to  its  safety  profile  and  high 
toxicity. 
Given  that  this  is  a  chronic,  progressive  disease  that  affects  young  adults  and  that  there  is  not  any 
suitable,  alternate  treatment  then  the  increased  muscle  strength  and  lessened  disability  with 
associated  improved  quality  of  life  in  response  to  KIOVIG  is  considered  to  be  important  from  the 
clinical perspective. Moreover, since there is not at present an IVIg that is licensed across Europe for 
management  of  multifocal  motor  neuropathy  then  this  would  be  considered  to  be  a  product  that 
addresses an unmet medical need.  
There are no high toxicity risks related to the use of IVIgs. In general they are well tolerated even if 
given  life-long  as  e.g.  in  replacement  therapy.  Risks  such  as  hypersensitivity  reactions,  aseptic 
meningitis, thromboembolic events, or renal failure are grave but rare and risk minimisation efforts are 
undertaken  by  the  company  to  address  these  side-effects.  The  unfavourable  effects  of  skin  reaction, 
fatigue  and  headache  have  been  well  described  and  documented  for  KIOVIG  in  its  use  for  other 
indications and would not be considered to detract from the favourable effects. 
Benefit-risk balance 
It  is  considered  that  the  increased  muscle  strength  in  response  to  KIOVIG  treatment  of  multifocal 
motor  neuropathy  and  the  potential  for  this  increase  to  persist  over  time  with  associated  improved 
quality  of  life  outweigh  both  the  negative  impact  of  adverse  effects,  as  described,  and  the 
inconvenience of needing to administer an intravenous preparation.

Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
There  remain  uncertainties  in  the  full  impact  of  treatment  muscle  weakness  of  multifocal  motor 
neuropathy  with  KIOVIG:  it  is  anticipated  that  these  uncertainties  may  be  addressed  by  the  ongoing 
randomised, controlled study being conducted in the USA.  
There  is  uncertainty  in  the  ability  of  KIOVIG  to  maintain  increased  muscle  strength  over  time. 
Progressive  weakness  in  any  one  subject  would  lead  to  a  shift  in  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  that 
subject  with  further  treatment  being  considered  to  be  futile.  Since  subjects  receiving  KIOVIG  for 
management  of  multifocal  motor  neuropathy  will  be  under  continuing  physician  management  and 
review then it may be expected that the development of lack of response in any one subject to KIOVIG 
will be addressed promptly. 
Overall, however, it is considered that the MAH has provided acceptable data to support the application 
for the use of KIOVIG in the indication for multifocal motor neuropathy. Against this background, the 
CHMP  considered  that  the  benefit-risk-profile  for  KIOVIG  is  positive  for  the  treatment  of  multifocal 
motor neuropathy and that the current variation application is approvable.

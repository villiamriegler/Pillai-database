I. The medicine and what it is used for
IV Akynzeo is indicated in adults for the: 
-
Prevention  of  acute  and dela yed  nausea a nd  vomiting  associated  with  highly  emetogenic
cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy.
-
Prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic
cancer chemotherapy.
IV Akynzeo contains fosnetupitant and palonosetron as active substances and it is given by intravenous 
route. 
Further information about the evaluation of IV Akynzeo’s benefits can be found in IV Akynzeo’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage.  
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to
minimise or further characterise the risks
Important risks of IV Akynzeo, together with measures to minimise such risks are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products are the following: 
•
•
•
Specific  Information, s uch  as  warnings, p recautions,  and  advice on   correct  use, in   the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly;
91 
• 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimises its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR/PBRER assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of IV Akynzeo is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Akynzeo IV are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks of IV Akynzeo can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of IV Akynzeo. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on some preliminary data, but this association 
has not been fully proven and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected.

II.B Summary of important risks 
 Important potential risk: Torsade de pointes due to QT/QTC prolongation 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Studies in healthy volunteers showed no relevant effects on the QT 
to the medicine 
parameters and no clinically important QT prolongations were observed 
in the safety study in both treatment group. Nevertheless, since cancer 
patients are a vulnerable population receiving potentially cardiotoxic 
antineoplastic agents, or with medical history remarkable for cardiac 
disease on treatment with antiarrhythmics, or may carry electrolytes 
imbalance, it is prudent to consider Torsade de pointes due to QT/QTc 
prolongation an important potential risk. The risk in this particular case 
is the clinical outcome of the adverse reaction.  Prolonged QT interval 
can predispose a patient to develop Torsade de Pointes which is a life-
threatening arrhythmia that can degenerate to ventricular fibrillation 
and cause patient’s sudden cardiac death. 
Risk factors and risk 
Risk factors include drug interaction, pre-existing cardiac diseases, e.g. 
groups 
cardiac ischaemia, cardiomyopathies, congenital long QT syndrome, 
electrolytes abnormalities or treatment with drugs known to prolong QT 
interval, hypothyroidism and hypoglycaemia. Female sex and older age 
are also associated with longer QT intervals. Furthermore a wide range 
92 
 
 
of chemotherapy agents including histone deacetylase inhibitors, 
nilotinib, ponatinib, vandetanib, crizotinib, vemurafenib, taxanes has 
been associated with arrhythmic effects.

Additional risk minimisation measures: 
No additional risk minimisation measures 
Important potential risk: Serotonin syndrome (due to palonosetron) 
Evidence for linking the 
The occurrence of Serotonin Syndrome (SS) has been considered as a 
risk to the medicine 
potential class effect of the anti-emetics belonging to the class of the 5-
HT3  RAs. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening drug 
reaction that may occur following therapeutic drug use. The excess 
serotonin activity produces a spectrum of specific symptoms including 
cognitive, autonomic, and somatic effects, which can be of variable 
intensity. 
Risk factors and risk 
Patients on treatment with antidepressant, or with triptanes for migraine 
groups 
or cluster headaches. Patients on therapy with anti-parkinson agents, or 
antidepressants for fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue. Use of illicit drugs 
(ecstasy, LSD), or herbal and nutritional supplements (St. John’s wort, 
panag ginseng) may increase the risk. Susceptibility to serotonin 
syndrome may be also conferred by patient’s factors, such as the capacity 
to metabolize certain drugs.

recent published data of the anti-emetic ondansetron belonging to the 
class of the 5-HT 3 RAs that have suggested an increased risk in specific 
major birth defects with first-trimester ondansetron use. This increase 
was entirely accounted for by a dramatic rise in oral ondansetron use 
beginning in 2006.

4b) Follow-up form for Serotonin Syndrome 
Drug:    
NETUPITANT/PALONOSETRON FDC 
Target AEs: 
Serotonin syndrome 
Other pertinent AEs: 
Patient should have been treated with netupitant/palonosetron alone or 
concomitantly with a serotonergic agent and have ONE of the following 
features or group of symptoms: 
●  Spontaneous clonus; 
● 
●  Ocular clonus with agitation or diaphoresis; 
●  Tremor and hyperreflexia; or 
●  Hypertonia, temperature above 100.4°F (38° C), and ocular or 
Inducible clonus with agitation or diaphoresis; 
inducible clonus. 
Have you attempted to obtain the following information in the initial and/or follow-up report or narrative? 
□  Was the patient administered netupitant/palonosetron concomitantly with any of the following 
medications?  
Antimigraine agents; triptans; antidepressants (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  [SSRIs], serotonin 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs], buspirone, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
[MAOIs]); antipsychotics; anticonvulsants; antiparkinsonian agents; analgesics (e.g., meperidine, tramadol); OTC 
products (e.g., cough and cold medication containing dextromethorphan); herbal products, dietary supplements,

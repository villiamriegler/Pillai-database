4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
Aflibercept  is  a  recombinant  fusion  protein  consisting  of  portions  of  human  VEGF  receptor  1  and  2 
extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor 
that binds VEGF-A and PlGF with higher affinity than their natural receptors, and thereby can inhibit the 
binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases; 
VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is 
also present on the surface of leucocytes. Excessive activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result 
in pathological neovascularisation and excessive vascular permeability. PlGF can synergize with VEGF-A 
in these processes, and is also known to promote leucocyte infiltration and vascular inflammation. 
EYLEA (aflibercept) is registered via Centralised Procedure (EMA/H/C/002392) and is indicated in 
adults for the treatment of: 
1.  neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 
2.  visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or 
central RVO), 
3.  visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME),  
4.  visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV). 
4.1.1.  Problem statement 
The pathophysiology of ROP is characterised by abnormal neovascularisation (prevalence 1-5 / 10 000; 
Opharnet).  The disruption  of  angiogenesis  in  preterm  infants with  ROP typically occurs in 2 postnatal 
phases (Hellström et al 2013). In Phase 1 (~22 to 30 weeks postmenstrual age), high oxygen saturation 
in  the  immature  retina  (relative  hyperoxia),  coupled  with  low  concentrations  of  growth  factors  and 
 
 
 
 
 
nutrients normally present in utero during the third trimester of pregnancy, lead to suppression of new 
vessel growth. As a result, the metabolically active but poorly vascularised retina becomes hypoxic. In 
Phase 2 (~31 to 44 weeks postmenstrual age), the hypoxic environment in the retina stimulates release 
of various angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), that lead to proliferation 
of new blood vessels. In preterm infants with disrupted angiogenesis, the abnormal neovascularisation 
and  the  leaky  new  blood  vessels  formed  in  this  environment  result  in  intraocular  fibrosis,  leading  to 
retinal distortion, detachment, and visual disability.  
According  to  the  International  Classification  of  Retinopathy  of  Prematurity  (IC-ROP  2005),  the  main 
features for the classification of ROP are: 
- The location of retinal involvement (Zone I: central circle, Zone II: mid-peripheral ring, or Zone III: 
peripheral ring),  
- The extent of circumferential disease (measured in number of clock hours),  
- The stage of severity (stage 1 through 5, depending on the morphological appearance of the disease) 
-  And  presence  of  plus  disease  (characterized  by  venous  dilatation  and  arteriolar  tortuosity  of  the 
posterior retinal vessels in at least 2 quadrants and indicating more aggressive course at any stage).  
A subtype called aggressive posterior ROP (AP-ROP) is an uncommon severe form of ROP, characterized 
by  posterior  location,  prominence  of  plus  disease,  with  extremely  intense  vascular  activation  and,  if 
untreated, shows rapid progression (over a few days) to advanced stages. AP-ROP is typically seen in 
Zone I but may occur in posterior Zone II. 
Figure 1 - Schema of right eye (RE) and left eye (LE) showing zone borders and clock hour sectors used 
to describe the location of vascularization and extent of retinopathy. Solid circles represent borders of 
zones I through III, and dotted circles represent borders of posterior zone II (2 disc diameters beyond 
zone I). 
A regulator of angiogenesis, VEGF, plays a key role in the progression of ROP and is involved in both 
phases  of  ROP  pathophysiology.  The  levels  of  VEGF  differ  in  the  two  phases  of  abnormal 
neovascularisation  and  are  associated  with  different  outcomes.  Suppression  of  VEGF  by  non-
physiologically  high  tissue  oxygenation  in  Phase  1  of  ROP  inhibits  normal  vessel  growth,  whereas 
upregulation  of  VEGF  induced  by  relative  hypoxia  in  Phase  2  of  ROP  leads  to  pathological 
 
 
 
neovascularisation  (Chen  and  Smith  2007).  Excessive  levels  of  VEGF  lead  to  abnormal  vascular 
proliferation and ultimately, if left untreated, to retinal detachment, which may result in blindness. 
Based on the finding that VEGF also plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of ROP, several studies 
have  led  to  publications  on  the  successful  treatment  of  infants  with  ROP  with  anti-VEGF  agents  (e.g. 
Mintz-Hittner et al 2011, Stahl et al 2018). Following data obtained from RAINBOW study, the marketing 
indication  of  ROP  was  obtained  for  Lucentis®  in  2019  both  in  the  EU  and  in  Japan.  No  prospective, 
randomized-controlled data was available on aflibercept in patients with ROP requiring treatment, prior 
to the conduct of the submitted pivotal study (20090 and 20275 study).  
At this time, there is an approved medicinal treatment for ROP with zone I (stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+), zone 
II (stage 3+) or AP-ROP (aggressive posterior ROP) disease (Lucentis®) and the standard of care being 
laser ablation therapy, which is invasive is associated with severe long-term sequelae such as permanent 
loss of visual field and high myopia. Vitreoretinal surgery is currently perform for more advanced stages 
of ROP with retinal detachment.

Biopharmaceutical development. 
For  the  proposed  new  indication,  a  low-volume,  high-accuracy  syringe  for  administration  of  a  fixed 
volume of 10 µl of EYLEA® solution for injection, corresponding to a dose of 0.4 mg, for the treatment 
of  the  pediatric  population  via  intravitreal  injection,  was  developed  following  the  European  Medicines 
Agency (EMA) Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) decision. 
1. 
Clinical development programme (see Section 5.4). 
Study 20090 (FIREFLEYE, Core study) Open-label, Randomized, Two-Arm, Controlled Study to Assess 
the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Intravitreal (IVT) Aflibercept 0.4 mg Compared to Laser 
Photocoagulation in Patients With Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP). 
Study 20275 (FIREFLEYE extension) is a currently ongoing Extension Study evaluationg the Long-term 
Outcomes of Subjects Who Received Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity in Study 20090. The 
Last subject last visit for the Extension Study is planned for Jul 2025. 
Both studies are part of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for 
aflibercept (EYLEA) (EMEA-000236-PIP05-18). 
Historical/published evidence synthesis study 
In the completed evidence synthesis study, no new data was collected, however, clinical data collected 
in Study 20090 was complemented by historical evidence for laser efficacy from the published 
randomized clinical trials BEAT-ROP and RAINBOW (Mintz-Hittner et al. 2011, Stahl et al. 2019), using 
a Bayesian statistical model.  
4.2.  Quality aspects 
The Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL in prefilled syringe for intravitreous injection (PFS) is indicated for 
adult patients (e.g. Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration - AMD, Diabetic Macular Edema - DME) to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administer 50 µL. The paediatric device is to be used for paediatric patients with the indication of 
Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) in addition to the current indications in adult patients (e.g. AMD, 
DME). 
A paediatric dosing device (PDD) has been developed for the administration of 10 µL of Aflibercept 
solution 40 mg/mL in prefilled syringe for intravitreous injection (PFS). The dosing device is assembled 
with a female luer connection to the syringe and a needle for injection is assembled to its male luer 
connection. The assembly is primed by depressing the syringe plunger rod to eliminate air bubbles 
from the assembly and to fill the device and the needle with finished product. The device has a short 
time contact with the finished product during administration. 
The impact on quality has been evaluated by compatibility studies and extractable and leachable 
studies. Potential impact on the dose delivery has been evaluated by dose accuracy studies. 
4.2.1.  Compatibility studies 
For the study, the inner chamber of the paediatric dosing device was filled with aflibercept solution 40 
mg/mL and the solution was analysed after a contact time of 6 hours (t6) at 25 °C (corresponding to a 
maximum expected contact time in practice). As a control, aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL in prefilled 
syringe was analysed at starting point (t0) and after 6 hours (t6) at 25°C without any contact to the 
device. The potential impact of shear forces implemented by the device was mimicked by passing the 
valve of the dosing device while it was filled with finished product. 
An initially performed device material screening study had shown no influence of the tested device 
materials on aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL. No noticeable observations regarding the tested materials 
in interaction with aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL could be observed with regards to physicochemical 
characteristics, adsorption or aggregation. Therefore, a triplicate of sample preparation for the 
physicochemical compatibility study was not considered necessary and one sample preparation is 
considered adequate. 
The analytical methods were assessed with regards to criticality for product quality and their 
predictability for compatibility and were selected accordingly for this study. Physical and chemical 
compatibility, including adsorption, precipitation of the finished product solution, and stability, are 
covered by determination of protein content, SE-UPLC and pH measurement. 
The test samples of aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL in contact with the paediatric dosing device fulfilled 
the specification and acceptance criteria with no significant differences to the control samples. The 
paediatric dosing device does not influence the physicochemical characteristics of aflibercept solution 
40 mg/mL and does not induce adsorption or aggregation. Based on the results of this study and 
considering the material screening study, the dosing device is suitable for the administration of 
aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL from compatibility perspective. 
4.2.2.  Extractables 
The paediatric dosing device was studied with regard of extractable compounds according to the EN 
ISO 10993-18 ‘Biological evaluation of medical devices’ performing exaggerated extraction.  
The PDD is packed into a blister and provided sterile, and it is packed together with the instructions for 
use into a carton box. 
To also ensure safety of primary packaging, devices were studied. The test materials were extracted. 
The total incubation time is equivalent with the estimated worst-case contact time of the finished 
 
 
 
product with the PDD. After each incubation samples from 8 paediatric dosing devices were pooled to 
collect sufficient volume of the extracts for the analyses.  
Testing methods, samples and AET concentrations were provided. 
Multiple extractable compounds were detected but those extractable compounds were not detected in 
Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL extract. 
In Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL sample extract one detected compound was also detected in the 
matrix blank. Two other compounds were not detected in the matrix blank but were related to the 
active substance and fragmentation products of that. 
Summary and conclusion 
The majority of detected extractable compounds were released from the paediatric dosing device 
component polymers during heating. Similar sampling procedure with Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL 
had negligible effects on dosing chamber materials. None of the reported polymer fragments were 
detected in Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL extracts. 
No clear differences between the packed and unpacked device extractable profiles were observed in 
regard of effects of primary package or printing on the primary package materials. 
It can be concluded from the extractables study data that, from the toxicological point of view, there is 
no objection to use the PDD for Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL for intravitreous injection in premature 
infants with ROP. None of the identified organic extractables found above the AET is known to cause 
unacceptable toxicities at the calculated estimated daily intake values or the theoretical maximum 
dose, after intravitreous administration of Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL, considering amounts 
determined in the extractables study. Extractable compounds represent potential leachable 
compounds, but as shown with Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL simulation samples, there were not 
detected any compounds without relation to Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL. Thus, risks to human 
health are judged negligible (de minimis). 
There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the sterile, single-use and short-term PDD, which is 
specifically designed to be placed between the syringe and injection needle and filled with Aflibercept 
solution 40 mg/mL, is of suitable quality for treating premature infants with ROP. 
4.2.3.  Dose accuracy 
No available alternative low-volume syringe or device was identified that is considered appropriate for 
the administration of the 10 µL of Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL for intravitreous injection. Therefore, 
the Company has developed a dedicated paediatric dosing device for Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL for 
intravitreous injection with the intended trade name PICLEO. This paediatric dosing device is designed 
to provide a single dose of 0.4 mg aflibercept (in 10 µL solution for injection) in use with Aflibercept 
solution 40 mg/mL for intravitreous injection already available and registered. The paediatric dosing 
device is provided sterile in a sealed tray to maintain sterility until opening. 
The paediatric dosing device was assembled with the PFS and the 30G ½” injection needle and the 
assembly was manually primed according to the instructions for use (IFU) of the dosing device. The 
dose was manually injected into a sealed vial, following the IFU, and by measuring the weight balance 
on a micro-balance scale, each delivered dose was recorded. Care was taken to follow the procedure 
for optimal reproducibility of the results. 
The delivered dose volume in [µL] was calculated. The delivered dose volume in [µL] was used for 
further statistical evaluation. 
 
 
 
Several different operators performed the test where each operator performed the test with 20 several 
assemblies. A total range of the dispensed volume was determined for the paediatric dosing device 
used in combination with the PFS. The mean dispensed volume was determined with no detectable 
variability between operators. 
The distribution is very narrow. 
The summary of the results from dose accuracy test with Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL in prefilled 
syringe for intravitreous injection and paediatric dosing device PICLEO was provided.  
The test results demonstrate that targeted dose of 0.4 mg aflibercept (in 10 µL solution for injection) 
can be administered with use of the paediatric dosing device with adequate accuracy and consistency. 
The dose volume range of the developed paediatric dosing device is well within the distribution range 
of a 1 mL disposable syringe. Therefore, the requirement to develop or identify an available application 
device to ensure accuracy for administration of 10 µL is considered fulfilled as demonstrated by the 
presented data in this section. 
The paediatric dosing device, used in line with instructions for use, will ensure accurate application of 
the dose with improved accuracy compared to a 1 mL disposable syringe. 
4.2.4.  Regional information 
The paediatric dosing device (PDD) will be a CE-marked medical device which is a stand-alone device 
and will be provided as a separate sales pack with cross-labelling to the EU-PI of the Eylea. The 
medical device (paediatric dosing device) PICLEO will be cross-labelled to Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 6.6 of 
the Eylea Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and in the Eylea Package Leaflet (PL).  
The dosing chamber and the valve adapter with valve are in contact with the finished product during 
administration. 
Classification 
The EU Declaration of conformity (DoC) as well as the CE certificate for the PDD was requested but the 
CHMP was finally of the opinion that the grouped variation can conclude positively even in the absence 
of the EU certificate and DoC for the PDD, since the NBOp for the PFS was provided and because the 
level of information submitted in Module 3 as regards the PDD (data on compatibility, extractable, dose 
accuracy;   information on usability studies) is considered sufficient. 
Human Factor study 
Together with its development partner for the paediatric dosing device, Bayer has conducted a 
comprehensive usability engineering program according to IEC 62366-1, to establish that the 
paediatric dosing device can be used safely and effectively by the intended users, for the intended 
uses, and in the intended use environments – that is, without use errors that could lead to serious 
harm for which further mitigation would be practicable. 
Within this Human Factors (HF) / Usability Engineering (UE) program, a total of four (4) formative 
usability evaluations were executed involving physicians who perform intravitreal injections to treat 
prematurely born patients with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Based on the observations and 
 
 
 
 
feedback from the formative evaluations, the user interface of the dosing device was optimised, and 
the use risk analysis was updated. 
No additional formative usability evaluations were deemed to be required before the summative 
usability evaluation for the paediatric dosing device, as all observed use problems were addressed by 
design and in the instructions for use. 
Formative usability studies were performed. The summative usability study was requested and was 
provided in response to the Request for Supplementary Information. 
Any observed use errors or use difficulties will be analysed for their root cause, the severity of harm 
that could result from the observation and, if needed, the practicality of modification of the user 
interface to further mitigate use-related risks. 
4.2.5.  Discussion and Conclusion on quality aspects 
The impact of the paediatric dosing device (PDD) on product on quality has been evaluated by 
compatibility studies and extractable and leachable studies. Potential impact on the dose delivery has 
been evaluated by dose accuracy studies. 
Compatibility studies demonstrate that the test samples of aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL in contact 
with the paediatric dosing device fulfilled the specification and acceptance criteria with no significant 
differences to the control samples. 
As regards the extractable/leachable study, no safety concern was identified.  
The dose accuracy study concluded that the total range of the dispensed volume was determined for 
the paediatric dosing device used in combination with the PFS. The total range of the dispensed 
volume is deemed acceptable.  
Aflibercept is an aqueous buffered solution, containing sodium phosphate, sodium chloride, sucrose 
and polysorbate 20. The solution is iso-osmotic and suitable for IVT injection. All excipients are of 
compendial grade. None of the excipients is known to have safety implications for paediatric use 
concerning the intended use and quantities. 
Therefore, the formulation of the pre-filled syringe is appropriate for use in preterm infants with ROP. 
As regards regional information, the paediatric dosing device will be a CE-marked medical device which 
is a stand-alone device and will be provided as a separate sales pack with cross-labelling to the EU-PI 
of Eylea.  
The transmitted certificate is a certificate issued according to the standard EN ISO 13485: 2016 related 
to the quality management system for medical devices.  
The EU Declaration of conformity (DoC) as well as the CE certificate for the PDD was requested but the 
CHMP was finally of the opinion that the grouped variation can conclude positively even in the absence 
of the EU certificate and DoC for the PDD, since the NBOp for the PFS was provided and because the 
level of information submitted in Module 3 as regards the PDD (data on compatibility, extractable, dose 
accuracy;   information on usability studies) is considered sufficient.  
An other concern was raised as regards the potential measuring function of the PDD. The MAH has 
clarified that the PDD is not classified as device with a measuring function.  
Formative usability studies were performed. The summative usability study was requested and was 
provided in response to the Request for Supplementary Information.  
 
 
 
The IFU (Instructions for Use) of the PDD were not initially submitted as part of this type II variation, 
but later on the MAH provided a preliminary IFU of the PDD. Nonetheless, in order to assess the safety 
and efficacy of the pre-filled syringe used in combination with the PDD for treatment of preterm 
infants, the finalised IFU of the PDD were requested. The Instructions for Use were provided in 
response to the RfSI. It is outlined in the IFU that the PDD is for single use which shall be used only 
with the Eylea PFS. The finalised IFU is considered acceptable.  
4.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
4.3.1.  Introduction 
The initial pharmacology program comprised in vitro studies to characterize the binding characteristics 
and activity of Aflibercept (VEGF Trap), as well as in vivo studies to characterize its efficacy in preventing 
pathological neovascularization and vascular permeability in relevant animal models of ocular vascular 
disease Aflibercept was found to bind with picomolar affinity to mouse, rat, rabbit and human VEGF-A, 
and  to  the  related  angiogenic  molecules,  human  placental  growth  factor-1  (PlGF-1)  and  mouse  and 
human PlGF-2, but not to human VEGF-C and VEGF-D. In a mouse model of oxygen-induced ischemic 
retinopathy  (OIR),  which  induces  a  neovascular  response  similar  to  effects  seen  in  retinopathy  of 
prematurity,  proliferative  diabetic  retinopathy,  and  other  ischemic  retinopathies,  a  single  IVT  dose  of 
Aflibercept (0.5 or 0.24 μg) prevented the development of pathological retinal neovascularization. It was 
agreed that IVT administration of Aflibercept effectively inhibited pathological neovascularization and/or 
abnormal vascular leak in all animal models tested. 
4.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Retinopathy  of  Prematurity  (ROP)  is  characterized  by  abnormal  development  of  the  retinal 
vascularization in preterm infants with a young gestational age (GA) (≤ 32 weeks) only and has been 
associated with disturbances in the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Thus, anti-VEGF 
products  such  as  Aflibercept,  are  capable  of  treating  ROP  based  on  clinical  positive  feedbacks  [Stahl 
2018, Salman 2015]. 
For the indication Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), no additional primary or secondary pharmacology 
or safety pharmacology studies were conducted on aflibercept as agreed with PDCO. Since no additional 
studies were required, the applicant has submitted publications on animal models of ROP and the existing 
safety pharmacology studies, already conducted, have been re-assessed with regard to safety margins 
in the preterm infant. 
4.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The development of the retinal vasculature and the progression of ROP has been learned through the 
use  of  animal  models  of  oxygen-induced  retinopathy  (OIR),  which  approximate  the  human  condition. 
Animal  models  of  OIR  have  provided  a  wealth  of  information  regarding  the  cellular  and  molecular 
pathogenesis  of  ROP.  Two  rodent  models,  mouse  and  rat,  are  commonly  used  to  study  the 
pathophysiology of ROP and to test the preclinical efficacy of drug candidates for ROP. The two models 
differ in their mode of induction (chronic hyperoxia in mice versus alternating hyperoxia/hypoxia in rats) 
.and in the manifestation of their vascular phenotypes. In mice, vaso-obliteration occurs primarily in the 
central retina. In contrast, vaso-obliteration is more peripheral in the  rat oxygen-induced retinopathy 
model and in human ROP. In addition, canine oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) was also developed in 
an  effort  to  experimentally  determine  the  effects  of  hyperoxia  on  the  development  of  the  retinal 
 
 
 
 
vasculature.  The  canine  OIR  model  has  many  characteristics  in  common  with  human  retinopathy  of 
prematurity. Exposure of 1-day-old dogs to hyperoxia for 4 days causes a vaso-obliteration throughout 
the  retina.  The  end-stage  pathology  of  the  canine  model  is  similar  to  stage  IV  human  retinopathy  of 
prematurity. Therefore, canine OIR is an excellent forum to evaluate the response to drugs targeting 
VEGF and its receptors. 
Effects of aflibercept on normal retinal vascular development 
Effects of aflibercept on pathologic ocular neovascularization in adult animals 
In agreement with the important role played by VEGF in pathologic neovascularization, aflibercept has 
been  shown  to  be  effective  in  reducing  neovascularization  and  vascular  leak  after  systemic  or  IVT 
administration in several models of pathological ocular neovascularization in adult animals (see below).  
Effects of aflibercept in the mouse OIR model 
In study, C57Bl/6 mouse pups were placed in a hyperoxic chamber(75% oxygen atmosphere) with their 
dams on post-natal day (P) 6, and returned to room air on P11, at which time pups received a single 
subcutaneous  (SC)  injection  of  a  control  protein  (hFc,  25  mg/kg),  REGN910  (anti-Ang2  antibody;  25 
mg/kg), VEGF Trap (25 mg/kg) or both REGN910 and VEGF Trap, and the effects of treatment on the 
extent of pathological neovascularization as well as blood vessel regrowth in the retina were assessed. 
Effects  of  treatment  with  REGN910,  VEGF  Trap  or  both  REGN910  and  VEGF  Trap  on  retinal 
revascularization 
 
 
 
Effects  of  treatment  with  REGN910,  VEGF  Trap  or  both  REGN910and  VEGF  Trap  on  retinal 
neovascularization 
Aflibercept treatment significantly reduced the area of pathologic retinal neovascularization at P16 by 
more than 80% and also reduced the central retinal avascular area by approximately 25%, indicating an 
improvement in normal retinal vascularization 
Qualitatively similar effects were seen at P19 in animals treated with this dose of aflibercept every other 
day from P13 (12-24 h after returning animals to normoxia) to P17 [Wang 2002]. Mouse pups exposed 
to 75% oxygen from P7 to P12 followed by return to normoxia were treated intravitreally with aflibercept 
(0.5 mcg at P14 with retinas harvested at P17, or 0.24 mcg at P15 with retinas harvested at P19) or an 
inactive control protein. In both studies, aflibercept caused a marked significant reduction of pathologic 
retinal neovascularization. 
Aflibercept-treated  animals  showed  a  larger  retinal  avascular  area  in  the  higher  dose  study  at  P17, 
whereas  the  animals  treated  with  the  lower  dose  of  aflibercept  assessed  at  P19  showed  a  significant 
reduction in avascular area by about 80% compared to control animals (Module 4.2.1.1 report VGT-NC-
013). Additional data from the mouse OIR model indicate that systemic pretreatment (intraperitoneal, 
25  mg/kg)  with  aflibercept  before  exposure  to  hyperoxia  can  ameliorate  the  loss  of  normal  retinal 
vasculature in this phase, thereby reducing the avascular zone [Wang et al., 2002 , cited in Cheung E]. 
A further publication [Tokunaga 2014 ] in this model (hyperoxia from P7 to P12, unilateral IVT application 
of saline or 2.5 or 10 mcg aflibercept on P14, fellow eye as uninjected control) showed broadly similar 
effects  of  aflibercept  on  retinal  vasculature:  significant  reduction  in  pathologic  neovascularization, 
transient increase in retinal avascular area at P15 and P17, which had recovered by P21 (i.e. as might 
be expected, the effect of aflibercept on normal retinal development was a delay and not a permanent 
reduction). 
 
 
 
 
This study also looked at nonvascular consequences of OIR, electroretinogram and retinal structure, and 
the authors describe potential negative effects of aflibercept treatment on these parameters: 
1. 
Dose-dependent disruption of the outer plexiform layer of the retina. 
This  parameter  appears  to  show  very  high  variability,  with  marked  disruption  seen  also  in  the  non-
injected control eyes (group averages for the non-injected eyes ranged from 5.9% to 29% compared to 
22.1% in saline-injected eyes, 27.9% for aflibercept low dose and 36.5% for aflibercept high dose). 
2. 
Thinning of the retina. 
Aflibercept low dose had a more marked apparent effect, retinal thickness was 122 μm (compared to 
172 μm in the fellow eye), retinal thickness in the high dose group was 140 μm (compared to 166 μm 
in the fellow eye). No data are given for the saline treated group. 
3. 
Electroretinogram/electroretinography 
All OIR groups at P21 and P42 showed reduced B-wave amplitude compared to normal adult animals. 
No significant differences were observed between uninjected OIR control group and aflibercept-treated 
eyes at P21. At P42 reduced B-wave amplitude in the low dose aflibercept group compared to OIR alone 
was detected. 
Proper  interpretation  of  these  nonvascular  anatomic  and  functional  outcomes  is  made  difficult  by  the 
fact that these data were obtained in only a small subset of the animals (N=2-4 per group), data are not 
given in all cases for the injection control group (saline treated), and it is not clear from the publication 
whether litter bias was adequately excluded. In addition, the IVT doses used in this study (2.5 and 10 
μg)  were  much  higher  than  in  another  study  outlined  above  which  already  showed  inhibition  of 
pathological neovascularization at doses of 0.24 and 0.5 μg, with only the higher dose showing reduction 
in normal retinal vascular development at the assessment time point employed. 
Effects of aflibercept in the dog OIR model 
The canine OIR model appears to be perhaps the most relevant model for human ROP, as development 
of  the  dog  superficial  retinal  vasculature  show  anatomic  mechanistic  similarities  to  human  retinal 
vascular development and the pathology of OIR in the dog shares many of the characteristics of human 
ROP [McLeod & Lutty 2016]. 
Exposure  of  P1  dogs  to  100%  oxygen  for  4  days  results  in  arrest  of  retinal  vasculogenesis  and 
vasoobliteration of  portions of  the developing  retinal  vasculature.  When  animals  are then  returned to 
room air, the resulting hypoxia induces progressive and persistent pathological IVT neovascularization, 
which may  be accompanied  by  IVT haemorrhage and tractional  retinal  folds,  while the normal retinal 
revascularization remains incomplete. 
Intravitreal administration of aflibercept (5, 25 or 250 μg/eye; the fellow eye received the same dose of 
inactive control protein) on P8, 3 days after animals were returned to room air, resulted in an almost 
complete  inhibition  of  pathological  IVT  neovascularization  at  P21  at  all  doses  tested  compared  to  the 
control  fellow  eyes.  Physiological  revascularization  of  the  retina  was  dose-dependently  reduced  by 
aflibercept at 25 and 250 μg/eye, the 5 μg/eye dose did not inhibit retinal revascularization. In same-
age pups raised in room air and not exposed to hyperoxia, normal retinal vascular development was also 
reduced by aflibercept at 25 or 250 μg/eye, here also 5 μg/eye had no effect on normal retinal vascular 
development.  The  effects  of  aflibercept  at  a  dose  of  5  μg/eye  administered  at  P22  on  established 
pathological  IVT  neovascularization  were  also  studied.  In  this  setting,  a  marked  reduction  in  the 
pathological  IVT  neovascular  area  at  P45  was  seen  with  no  effect  on  retinal  revascularization  [Lutty 
2011]. 
 
 
This  study  indicates  that  in  the  dog  OIR  model,  efficacy  is  seen  already  at  a  low  dose  of  aflibercept. 
However, no data are available for the effects of aflibercept on pathologic ocular neovascularization in 
adult dogs and therefore direct translation of the doses used in this study to the human situation (e.g. 
by comparison with dog and human adult doses) is not possible. 
Conclusion 
In  conclusion,  aflibercept  shows  efficacy  in  inhibiting  pathological  ocular  neovascularization  across 
multiple preclinical models in adult and neonatal animals after systemic or IVT administration. Aflibercept 
shows robust efficacy in preventing or reversing the pathological neovascularization in mouse and dog 
models  of  OIR,  which  are  regarded  as  standard  preclinical  models  for  ROP.  Despite  the  uncertainties 
related to the quantitative translation of the preclinical doses to humans, the data obtained using IVT 
administration of aflibercept in the mouse and dog OIR models are supportive of the clinical dose of 0.4 
mg  per  eye.  The  findings  from  the  OIR  studies  with  respect  to  normal  retinal  vascular  development, 
which is arrested by hyperoxia, are divergent, with some studies reporting delayed vascularization and 
others improved / accelerated physiological vascularization (depending on dose and time of observation), 
but in most cases where a delay is reported, it appears to be transient. 
Overall, elements in favour of the use of aflibercept in ROP are agreed. 
4.3.2.2.  Safety pharmacology programme  
In  a  series  of  safety  pharmacology  studies  with  systemic  administration,  no  effects  on  respiratory  or 
central nervous system function, or on the potential for thrombus formation were identified. Single, SC 
injections of aflibercept in rats and mice resulted in transient, dose-dependent increases in systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure. Repeated dose studies in rabbits (IV infusion every 7 days, 4 doses in total) 
revealed  dose-related  delays  in  wound  healing  and  decreases  in  mechanical  wound  strength.  For  all 
safety pharmacological endpoints multiples of exposure (MoEs, safety margins) regarding the peak free 
aflibercept concentrations were calculated for a preterm infant of 0.8 kg body weight (BW) dosed with 
0.4 mg aflibercept/eye (both eyes treated). The preterm infant of 0.8 kg BW was selected as a baby 
with the minimal body weight at baseline included in the FIREFLEYE study, representing the worst case 
with regard to aflibercept exposure. In addition, exposure multiples with regard to mean free aflibercept 
Cmax from the FIREFLEYE study were calculated (see Table 6–2). 
 
 
For  the  NOEL  for  respiratory  and  central  nervous  system  functions  as  well  as  venous  and  arterial 
thrombus  formation,  MoEs  of  at  least  715x  were  achieved.  Smaller  safety  margins  were  observed 
regarding the effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (MoE = 1.6x at the NOEL, first effects at 
MoE of 3.5x) and wound healing (MoE ≥9.5x). Taken together, most of these effects are not considered 
to  be  relevant  to  IVT  administration  of  up  to  3  injections  with  a  maximum  of  0.4  mg  aflibercept/eye 
(both eyes treated) in premature infants with ROP, however, a potential risk for a transient increase of 
BP cannot entirely be excluded. 
4.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No additional preclinical (PK) studies were conducted on the use of aflibercept in ROP patients. PK 
studies using intravitreal (IVT) administration in juvenile animals are not considered appropriate to 
generate further meaningful information, as the target population (premature infants with ROP) has a 
different developmental status and there is no appropriate model available. Given the lack of 
information on clearance mechanisms from the eye in premature infants across species, the 
translational value of a PK analysis in neonatal animals is unknown.  
4.3.4.  Toxicology  
As agreed with PDCO no additional non-clinical studies were conducted on aflibercept for the indication 
ROP (PDCO decision P/0115/2019). 
The safety of aflibercept has been assessed in a comprehensive nonclinical safety program following IVT 
and  systemic  administration  up  to  very  high  multiples  of  human  exposure  (exceeding  1000  fold  with 
regard to free aflibercept in studies with systemic dosing) and includes studies in adolescent monkeys. 
The  animal  species  chosen  were  selected  based  on  similarly  high  binding  affinities  of  aflibercept  with 
VEGF from that species, based on amino acid sequence homology compared to human VEGF. Species 
chosen were highly homologous (mouse, rat and rabbit) or even identical (monkey). The cynomolgus 
 
 
 
monkey as the primary relevant species was used for all IVT and systemic toxicological studies up to 
and including chronic exposure. 
Adverse findings and target organs of toxicity identified were generally considered to be consistent with 
VEGF inhibition and due to exaggerated pharmacological effects observed from estimated Multiples of 
Exposure (MoEs) in the range of approximately 12 to 25-fold for a 0.8 kg BW ROP patient. The pattern 
of findings, i.e. their type, incidence and severity, was related to dose / exposure and treatment duration. 
Following  systemic  treatment,  sexually  immature  monkeys  tended  to  be  more  sensitive  compared  to 
adults particularly with regards to developing adverse findings on the nasal cavities/sinuses. 
There  is  no  suitable  toxicological  juvenile  animal  model  for  IVT  dosing  in  preterm  human  infants 
available: At birth, the developmental stage of the retina of mice, rats and rabbits is considered largely 
to correspond to that of a preterm human infant but the eyes remain closed until eyelid opening occurs 
around day 10 to 14 in these species. At eyelid opening, the developmental stage of the eyes is generally 
equivalent to a term human newborn and no longer corresponds to a prematurely born infant (Abdo et 
al. 2017, Van Cruchten et al. 2017). IVT treatment of the eyes prior to eye opening is technically not 
feasible. Therefore, the only feasible option was to consider systemic dosing of juvenile mice. However, 
based  on  the  consistent  safety  profile  of  aflibercept  in  the  available  safety  studies  to  date,  it  is  not 
expected that such a study would significantly alter the risk-benefit profile. This is supported by off-label 
use data in preterm infants, published results from the RAINBOW trial (Stahl et al. 2019) as well as the 
results of the Phase 3 Study 20090 (FIREFLEYE), which revealed no safety issues so far. 
For all toxicological endpoints multiples of exposure (MoEs) regarding Cmax and, where available, AUC 
of free aflibercept were calculated for a preterm infant of 0.8 kg body weight (BW) dosed with 0.4 mg 
aflibercept/eye (both eyes treated). The preterm infant of 0.8 kg BW was selected as a baby with the 
minimal  body  weight  at  baseline  included  in  the  FIREFLEYE  study,  representing  the  worst  case  with 
regard to aflibercept exposure. AUC for the preterm infant was calculated based on clearance, scaled 
with body weight (CL=D/AUC) according to the equation: 
AUC_preterm =AUC_adult ×
BW_adult
BW_preterm
×
DOSE_preterm
DOSE_adult
With DOSE_adult = 2 mg; AUC_adult = 2,856 μg·h/mL; BW_preterm infant: 0.8 kg, BW_adult: 66.5 kg 
The Cmax was calculated similarly according to this formula and considered as reasonable for the eye 
but a rough estimation of systemic Cmax; therefore AUC-based MoEs appear to be more reliable. 
In addition, exposure multiples with regard to mean Cmax of free aflibercept from the FIREFLEYE study 
were calculated, which lay in the range of the estimated MoEs. 
The respective animal species were selected based on similarly high binding affinities of aflibercept with 
VEGF, consistent with amino acid sequences compared to human VEGF that are either highly homologous 
(mouse, rat and rabbit) or even identical (monkey). A strong anti-aflibercept antibody response in rats 
and mice upon repeat dosing led to mortality and excluded the use of rodents for longer toxicological 
studies. Rabbits developed antibodies only to a limited extent, while monkeys did not show a significant 
formation. Furthermore, the monkey eye is structurally and physiologically most similar to the human 
eye, and due to its size allows to safely inject an aflibercept IVT dose equivalent to or higher than that 
used in human patients. Thus, the cynomolgus monkey as the primary relevant species was used for all 
IVT  and  systemic  toxicological  studies  of  up  to  chronic  duration,  and  the  rabbit  for  the  embryo-fetal 
development studies. 
In addition, and for completeness of reporting: Cmax measured in the FIREFLEYE study reached 0.481 
µg/mL. Cmax and AUC0-28days values calculated by the applicant reached 0.642 µg/mL and 94.962 
µg.h/mL, respectively. 
 
 
 
 
4.3.4.1.  Repeat dose toxicity  
1.  Toxicity studies evaluating intravitreal (IVT) administration 
Toxicological  studies  in  monkeys  with  repeated  IVT  dosing  of  both  eyes  with  aflibercept  for  up  to  13 
weeks  (bilateral  dosing  with  up  to  2  mg/eye  every  4  weeks  or  with  4  mg/eye  every  6  weeks,  3-4 
treatments  in  total)  cover  the  maximal  number  of  injection  time  points  in  preterm  infants  (including 
baseline treatment and potential retreatments if needed after a minimum interval of 28 days). However, 
since the 4- and 13-week studies did not include histopathology of the nasal turbinates as the primary 
target organ after IVT dosing, and the studies were mostly conducted using research formulations, the 
8-month IVT monkey study with aflibercept in the commercial formulation is used as the key study for 
the risk assessment for aflibercept in premature infants with ROP. 
Repeated IVT dosing of  aflibercept up to 13 weeks  produced  mild,  transient  ocular inflammation  that 
was  generally  reversible  between  doses  or  after  the  recovery  period.  In  no  instance  was  this 
inflammation associated with angiographic or electroretinographic changes, nor were any abnormalities 
detected  upon  ocular  imaging  or  microscopic  evaluation.  There  were  no  signs  of  systemic  toxicity  or 
histopathological findings up to the high dose of 4 mg/eye. However, it has to be noted, that the nasal 
turbinates as a target organ were not investigated in these studies. For a preterm infant of 0.8 kg BW 
bilaterally treated with 0.4 mg aflibercept per eye, systemic exposure measured in these animals was 
equivalent to estimated multiples of exposure (MoEs) of at least 16 with regard to Cmax and 27 with 
regard to AUC(0-28 days), respectively, for free aflibercept. 
In the 8-month pivotal IVT study in monkeys (no. VGFT TX-05011), aflibercept doses ranging from 0.5 
to 4 mg/eye were administered bilaterally every 4 weeks for 9 doses in total. Ocular findings were similar 
to  those  seen  in  the  13-week  studies  consisting  primarily  of  signs  of  mild  and  transient  ocular 
inflammation. Systemic toxicity was evident but confined to chronic inflammation of the nasal turbinates 
with erosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium from 2 mg/eye (equivalent to estimated MoEs 
of at least 9.2 and 10 regarding Cmax and AUC(0-28 days), respectively). This finding had not completely 
resolved after recovery. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 0.5 mg/eye in this study was 
equivalent to estimated MoEs of at least 1.9 and 1.5 regarding Cmax and AUC(0-28 days) for free aflibercept. 
The estimated multiples of exposure were confirmed by the recent results of the FIREFLEYE study: Cmax 
of free aflibercept in preterm infants after treatment with 0.4 mg/eye (treated bilaterally in 95% of the 
cases) was 23-fold lower than Cmax at the NOAEL in the 13-week study (no. VGFT TX 04025). In the 
chronic  monkey  study,  at  the  LOAEL  of  2  mg/eye  the  systemic  exposure  for  free  aflibercept  was 
approximately  10-fold  higher  based  on  Cmax  when  compared  to  corresponding  values  observed  in 
preterm  infants  after  an  intravitreal  dose  of  0.4  mg/eye.  At  the  No  Observed  Adverse  Effect  Level 
(NOAEL) of 0.5 mg/eye in monkeys the systemic exposure was about 2-fold higher when compared to 
corresponding values observed in preterm infants based on Cmax. 
2.  Toxicity studies evaluating systemic intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) administration 
In monkeys, the toxicity of aflibercept was assessed in multiple repeat dose toxicity studies at doses of 
1.5 to 30 mg/kg administered SC 2 to 3 times weekly for 4 to 13 weeks (no. VGFT-TX-03004 and VGFT-
TX-02037) or at doses of 0.5 to 30 mg/kg administered IV weekly or bi-weekly for 4 to 26 weeks (no. 
VGFT-TX-02029, VGFT-TX-03048, VGFT-TX-05010, and VGFTTX-05009). 
Although preterm infants with ROP will be dosed with aflibercept by the IVT route, also the toxicological 
studies with systemic administration were reviewed to identify target organs appearing at low multiples 
of exposure and after short treatment durations. This was done in order to monitor the respective target 
organs  in  the  FIREFLEYE  study.  With  the  dosing  schedule  in  preterm  infants  with  ROP  (single  IVT 
 
 
 
treatment of one or both eyes with one possible repetition not earlier than 28 days after the previous 
dose) the studies considered most relevant for safety assessment are the 4- and 13-week studies. 
Toxicological findings from systemic intravenous (IV) and/or subcutaneous (SC) studies of up to 6 month 
duration in adult and sexually immature monkeys suggest exaggerated pharmacological effects that are 
generally consistent with VEGF inhibition. In these studies, free aflibercept exposures were significantly 
higher as compared with IVT administration. No NOAELs were identified in any of the systemic toxicology 
studies and immature monkeys tended to be more sensitive compared to adults particularly with regards 
to  developing  adverse  findings  on  the  nasal  cavities/sinuses.  This  finding  was  the  only  systemic 
observation  following  IVT  treatment  of  adult  monkeys  over  8  months,  and  therefore  is  considered 
toxicologically relevant. An overview on the target organs and estimated MoEs at the lowest doses at 
which respective findings were observed in the 4- and 13-week studies as well as in the 6-month study 
is given in the table at the end of this section. 
Major  target  organs  in  adult  monkeys  in  studies  of  up  to  4  weeks  of  treatment  include  the  kidneys, 
growth plates of the bones, adrenal glands (observed from estimated MoEs of > 101 for Cmax), and, at 
higher doses, also the ovaries (at estimated MoEs ≥ 426 for Cmax). At the low dose, the kidney and 
bone findings were mostly minimal to slight and occurred in only a few animals; the reduced vacuolization 
of adrenal zona fasciculata cells was more pronounced, but is considered to reflect functional changes 
and not to be adverse per se. 
After 13 weeks of dosing, all target organs observed in adult monkeys previously in studies of up to 4 
weeks  duration  were  identified  at  estimated  MoEs  from  ≥  11  regarding  Cmax.  In  sexually  immature 
monkeys,  target  organs  identified  at  similar  MoEs  (≥  13  to  17  fold  for  Cmax)  were  the  nasal 
cavities/sinuses  (degeneration/regeneration  of  epithelia)  and  the  ovaries  with  MoEs  of  18  or  19, 
respectively, based on AUC(0-28 days). Again, findings at these exposure levels were only minimal to slight 
(in 2 cases moderate) and only present in a proportion of the animals. 
Dosing over 13 weeks revealed additional target organs of toxicity in both adult and/or sexually immature 
monkeys, but only at much higher estimated MoEs of at least 94 fold for Cmax and/or 174 fold for AUC(0-
28  days).  These  include:  the  vertebrae  (proliferation  /  degeneration  of  adjacent  microvasculature,  after 
recovery myofiber atrophy of axial musculature), the brain (macrophage infiltration in the choroid plexus, 
vascular degeneration / fibrosis) and the intestines (vasculitis). Further target organs were identified at 
even higher estimated MoEs from ≥ 746 and 1284 for Cmax and AUC(0-28 days), respectively, and include 
the  heart  and  urinary  bladder  (both:  vasculitis),  as  well  as  the  digestive  tract  (gall  bladder, 
gastrointestinal tract and pancreas: vascular proliferation / degeneration and inflammatory changes).  
Chronic treatment of adult monkeys up to 6 months affected further target organ systems such as male 
and  female  reproductive  functions  and  organs  (sperm  motility  and  abnormalities,  vagina  and  uterus: 
epithelial and endometrial / myometrial atrophy) at estimated MoEs of > 147 in terms of Cmax and 226 
in terms of AUC(0-28 days), and the liver (portal inflammation and/or periportal necrosis) at estimated MoEs 
> 715 in terms of Cmax and 1152 in terms of AUC(0-28 days). 
MoEs calculated based on the mean Cmax from the FIREFLEYE study were in the range of the predicted 
exposure margins and are presented in brackets in Table 9–2 below. 
Taken collectively, the pattern of adverse organ findings in the systemic toxicity studies falls into two 
categories: those considered potentially relevant to human safety, i.e. occurring at MoEs in the range of 
approximately 25 – 50 fold, and those considered unlikely to be of toxicological significance for human 
risk assessment, i.e. occurring at MoEs of around 100 and much greater, i.e. from 1000 and above. In 
sexually immature monkeys, only two organ systems were identified in the low range of MoEs after 13 
weeks of IV treatment, i.e. the ovaries and the nasal cavities/sinuses. It was noted that in adults, the 
MoEs for Cmax following SC dosing generally were lower compared to IV treatment consistent with the 
 
 
respective  route  of  administration.  However,  no  AUCs  could  be  calculated  for  SC  dosing,  limiting  the 
further PK interpretation to some extent. 
With the exception of exostosis in the 6-month study, all findings showed partial or complete reversibility. 
 
 
 
The nasal cavity/ sinuses were identified as the sole systemic target organ after IVT administration. 
Findings were noted at 10-fold higher Cmax level than in ROP patients, with a Cmax-based safety 
margin of 1.6-1.7 (rounded to 2 in proposed SPC 5.3 wording). Similar findings were reported at all 
dose levels in the 13-week and 6-month intravenous studies wherein immature animals (13-week 
study, animals aged 2-2.5 years at initiation of treatment) seemed more sensitive (17-20-fold clinical 
exposure based on Cmax or AUC). 
Other effects were in general consistent with the pharmacological activity of aflibercept, and occurred 
mostly at high exposure multiples (≥100). To be noted, kidney, bone growth plate, adrenal and ovary 
findings were seen from the low dose level in the 13-week SC study (11- to 16-fold the clinical Cmax) 
and reported to be of minimal to slight severity. The NOAELs determined for these organs (except 
ovaries) in the 13-week IV study in immature monkeys was 0.5 mg/kg which corresponds to Cmax-
and AUC-based safety margins of 17-23 and 18-19, respectively (Cmax determined in FIREFLEYE 
study). 
As regards ovary findings, they consisted in absent corpora lutea, and decreased maturating follicles 
and/or granulosa and/or theca cells; they do not appear of relevance to ROP patients. Similarly, the 
reported sperm findings in the 6-month IV study do not appear relevant for ROP patients. 
Proteinuria, nasal bleeding, and growth were monitored in the FIREFLEYE clinical trial to account for 
the nasal cavity/ sinuses, kidney and bone growth plate findings in toxicological studies and continuous 
kidney and skeleton development in ROP patients. A follow-up period of 5 years is also planned in the 
 
 
 
 
FIREFLEYE NEXT extension study. This is considered as adequate in view of the toxicological profile of 
aflibercept in repeat-dose toxicity studies. Up to now, no AE was reported on these parameters. 
Effects on the brain (chronic vascular degeneration/fibrosis, infiltration of macrophages in choroid 
plexus) were noted in the 13-week IV study in immature monkeys and in the 6-month IV study at the 
mid and high dose levels inducing ≥136-fold clinical exposure. At the low dose levels, exposure 
multiples were ≥17-fold (based on Cmax measured in ROP patients in FIREFLEYE study). This leads to 
potential uncertainties about impact of anti-VEGF treatment on neurodevelopment. 
Neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed as part of the 5-year follow-up study. 
4.3.4.2.  Reproduction toxicity 
An  effect  of  aflibercept  on  intrauterine  development  was  demonstrated  in  embryo-fetal  development 
(EFD) studies in pregnant rabbits with IV (3 to 60 mg/kg) as well as SC (0.1 to 1 mg/kg) administration 
either  during  organogenesis  or  from  day  of  gestation  1  up  to  the  end  of  organogenesis,  respectively 
(studies no. VGFT-TX-06002 and VGFT-TX-11034). Maternal NOAELs were 3 mg/kg IV and 1 mg/kg SC; 
a  developmental  NOAEL  was  not  identified.  Continuous  exposure  was  demonstrated  in  spite  of 
intermittent treatment on gestation days (GDs) 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 in the IV and 1, 7 and 13 in the SC 
study. Adverse developmental effects were evident mainly as visceral malformations and variations of 
the  cardiovascular  system,  consistent  with  the  anti-angiogenic  properties  of  aflibercept.  Further 
malformations and variations of other organ systems and/or the skeleton were also seen across groups. 
However, there was no evidence of specific adverse effects on the development of the eyes. A single 
foetus at 60 mg/kg IV (maternal exposure equivalent to estimated MoEs of 3833 or 706 regarding Cmax 
or AUC(0-3 days) of free aflibercept, respectively, in comparison with the premature infant) was found 
to  exhibit  unilateral  microphthalmia,  for  which  a  relation  to  treatment  cannot  be  totally  discounted. 
Notably,  the  development  of  the  eye  occurs  early  in  development  and  microphthalmia  is  the  clinical 
presentation  of  a  fundamentally  disturbed  developmental  process  resulting  in  major  and  multiple 
malformations of the eye structures. Therefore, this isolated finding at very high MoEs is not considered 
relevant  to  the  risk  assessment  of  aflibercept  in  a  clinical  situation,  where  a  developed  eye  of  a 
prematurely born child is dosed directly to treat the clinical condition of ROP. 
The  malformations  and  variations  described  above  develop  early  in  organogenesis  whilst  in  preterm 
infants with ROP, the major organogenesis is already completed (the period of major organogenesis in 
humans is completed after the first trimester of pregnancy). Therefore, similar effects are not expected 
to occur after IVT treatment of these patients with aflibercept.  
Effects  on  male  and  female  fertility  were  assessed  as  part  of  the  6-month  study  in  monkeys  with  IV 
administration of aflibercept ranging from 3 to 30 mg/kg BW (no. VGFT-TX-05009). Absent or irregular 
menses  associated  with  alterations  in  female  reproductive  hormone  levels,  and  changes  in  sperm 
morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels, but were reversible after recovery. For the 
preterm infant these reversible effects on  fertility  are not considered to be  relevant,  since premature 
infants are not yet fertile and are treated on only one or two treatment occasions with aflibercept IVT. 
 
 
Results of the EFD study mainly point to treatment-related effects occurring during major 
organogenesis, so that most are not expected to occur in ROP patients. Therefore, the applicant’s 
proposal to add in SPC 5.3 that the systemic exposure in rabbits at the LOAEL (0.1 mg/kg, sc) is 0.6-
fold that in ROP patients but that effects reported in rabbit foetuses are not expected to occur in this 
patients after IVT administrations since major organogenesis is already complete in this population is 
not supported. 
As regards effects on the male and female fertility/ sexual organs, they are considered of limited 
relevance in ROP patients (see also previous section). 
4.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The European 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  London,  June  2006)  stipulates  the  requirement  for  an  ERA  for  medicinal 
products  licensed  in  the  EU  after  20061.  In  accordance  with  the  EMA  guideline1  for  proteins  an  ERA 
statement is sufficient, which details why no ERA studies are provided and why there is no significant 
risk to the environment. 
Aflibercept  (BAY  86‐5321)  is  a  recombinant  protein  consisting  of  human  vascular  endothelial  growth 
factor  receptor  (VEGFR)  extracellular  domains  fused  to  the  Fc  portion  of  human  immunoglobulin  G1 
(IgG1). It contains portions of the extra‐ cellular domains of two different VEGF receptors, VEGFR‐1 and 
VEGFR‐2. The two domains bind the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with different potency. 
The recombinant protein is expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) K1 cells. 
Recovery  and  purification  of  the  protein  is  accomplished  via  a  combination  of  filtration  and 
chromatographic techniques. Aflibercept is then formulated for intravitreal (IVT) administration. 
Aflibercept has a market approval in the EU for a variety of ophthalmological diseases in adult patients, 
i.e., for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), visual impairment 
due to macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch or central RVO), visual impairment 
 
 
 
due to diabetic macular edema (DME), and visual impairment due to myopic choroidal neovascularization 
(myopic CNV) in adults. 
The new targeted pediatric indication is on treatment of retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants. 
This new treatment may potentially increase the emission of aflibercept into the environment. 
However, aflibercept is a protein which can generally be expected to be readily and completely degraded 
in the environment. Neither bioaccumulation nor toxicity is to be expected from proteins when released 
into  environmental  compartments.  Thus,  based  on  common  knowledge  there  is  no  indication  that 
aflibercept could be a risk to the environment and consequently no ERA studies are required. Therefore, 
in accordance with the EMA guideline1 no ERA has to be provided for the protein‐ based medicinal product 
EYLEA. 
The  applicant  provided  a  suitable  justification  for  not  performing  an  Environmental  Risk  Assessment 
(ERA)  in  line  with  the  guidance  from  the  “Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  the 
medicinal products for human use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
4.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Aflibercept  is  a  recombinant  fusion  protein  that  binds  human  VEGF-A  and  PlGF-2  with  high  affinity, 
blocking the interaction of these ligands with their cognate receptors. During the initial pharmacological 
development program, it was demonstrated that local (IVT) and systemic (IV and SC) administrations 
of Aflibercept were capable of inhibiting neovascularization and/or pathological vascular leak in disease-
relevant animal models in mice, rats and monkeys.  
For the indication Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), no additional primary or secondary pharmacology 
or safety pharmacology studies were conducted on aflibercept as agreed with PDCO. Since no additional 
studies were required, the applicant has submitted publications on animal models of ROP and the existing 
safety pharmacology studies, already conducted, have been re-assessed with regard to safety margins 
in the preterm infant. Thus, a review of Aflibercept’s effectiveness in the treatment of ocular neovascular 
disorders,  has  been  presented  by  the  applicant  in  various  preclinical  studies  following  IV,  SC  or  IVT 
routes  of  administration.  The  development  of  the  retinal  vasculature  and  the  progression  of  ROP  has 
been learned through the use of animal models of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), which approximate 
the  human  condition.  The  applicant  has  justified  the  usefulness  of  Aflibercept  with  data  generated  in 
mouse and canine OIR models in neonatal animals via various routes of administration. 
High significant MoEs (> 700 fold) were observed for respiratory effects, CNS effects, thrombosis after 
IV administration. These effects are not considered relevant based on exposures after IVT administration 
are by  far lower than those after IV  route.  However  weak MoEs have been  observed regarding blood 
pressure (MoE = 1.6x at the NOEL, first effects at MoE of 3.5x) after SC administration and therefore 
transient effects on blood pressure cannot be totally ruled out in clinics. 
No  additional  preclinical  studies  were  conducted  regarding  the  extension  of  use  of  aflibercept  in  ROP 
patients. It is agreed that IVT administration in juvenile animals are not considered feasible in order to 
give translational information in regards of the target population. 
The  applicant  provided  a  suitable  justification  for  not  performing  an  Environmental  Risk  Assessment 
(ERA) and no ERA was requested for the initial MA in adults regarding a broad panel of ophthalmological 
diseases. 
A  comprehensive  program  of  toxicological  studies  conducted  either  via  intravitreal  or  systemic 
(subcutaneous,  intravenous)  routes  of  administration  was  undertaken  to  support  the  development  of 
aflibercept in adult patients. The pharmaco-toxicological profile of aflibercept was well characterized in 
 
 
 
these  studies,  and  the  main  findings  were  consistent  with  VEGF  inhibition.  Toxicological  studies 
performed in Cynomolgus monkeys, including a 13-week study in immature animals, were reviewed and 
margins of exposure were calculated considering measured Cmax, and predicted Cmax and AUC values 
in ROP patients. Target organs of particular relevance for paediatric patients were identified, notably the 
kidney,  and  bone  growth  plate.  Except  for  the  finding  in  the  nasal  cavity/sinuses,  adverse  effects 
occurred in general at high exposure multiples with acceptable safety margins. Based on the toxicological 
profile and ongoing development of some target organs in paediatric patients (kidney, skeleton), nasal 
bleeding, proteinuria and growth and development were monitored in the FIREFLEYE clinical trial, with 
a planned 5-year follow-up in the extension study. This includes neurodevelopmental outcomes due to 
concerns about impact of anti-VEGF treatment on this aspect. Overall, potential effects of concerns with 
generally  acceptable exposure ratios were  identified  from  the available toxicological  data,  and  clinical 
safety  monitoring  was  subsequently  put  in  place.  Additional  toxicological  data  are  not  considered  of 
potential added value. 
Results of the EFD study mainly point to treatment-related effects occurring during major organogenesis, 
so that most are not expected to occur in ROP patients. Therefore, the applicant’s proposal to add in SPC 
5.3 that the systemic exposure in rabbits at the LOAEL (0.1 mg/kg, sc) is 0.6-fold that in ROP patients 
but  that  effects  reported  in  rabbit  foetuses  are  not  expected  to  occur  in  this  patients  after  IVT 
administrations since major organogenesis is already complete in this population is not supported. In 
addition,  it  is  suggested  to  remove  from  SPC  5.3  the  exposure  ratios  at  the  LOAEL  for  effects  on 
respiratory  epithelium,  to  provide  a  clearer  wording  for  the  prescriber  and  considering  that  exposure 
ratios at the NOAEL for these effects are mentioned. 
4.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view the extended indication of aflibercept in ROP can be granted.  
4.4.  Clinical aspects 
4.4.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
The Phase 3 study FIREFLEYE (Study 20090) was conducted in ROP patients receiving IVT injection of 
0.4 mg aflibercept. FIREFLEYE was a randomized, 2-arm, open-label study of the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of aflibercept compared to laser photocoagulation in patients with ROP. The extension study 
FIREFLEYE NEXT evaluates the long term outcomes of patients who received treatment for ROP in 
FIREFLEYE. Aflibercept (Eylea 40 mg/mL solution for injection) was investigated at a single dose of 0.4 
mg (in an injection volume of 0.01 mL) per injection and eye. The 0.4 mg dose corresponds to 20% of 
the Eylea dose (2 mg) approved for use in adults. 
After IVT administration of 0.4 mg aflibercept (mostly bilaterally on the same day), mean 
concentrations of free (pharmacologically active) aflibercept declined until week 4 after dosing (mean 
concentration of 133 ng/mL at week 4), and further declined thereafter to values below or close to the 
lower limit of quantification by 8 weeks after start of treatment. Over time, with decreasing 
concentrations of free aflibercept (binding to VEGF by aflibercept’smode of action), levels of bound 
aflibercept increased up to week 4, and declined thereafter. 
 
 
 
 
Exploratory comparisons between sub-populations included in the study were primarily based on 
plasma concentrations of free aflibercept until Week 4, as most of the samples thereafter being 
<LLOQ. For the interpretation of data, it should generally be considered that the numbers of subjects 
across subgroups varied considerably. 
Mean free aflibercept concentrations all declined from Week 0/Day1 onwards independent of the 
baseline BW. Mean adjusted bound aflibercept concentrations increased from Week 0/Day1 until Week 
4 and declined thereafter, independent of baseline BW. Between the different BW groups at a single 
time point, mean free and adjusted bound aflibercept concentrations were highest in the lowest BW 
group and lowest in the highest BW group. 
No apparent differences in exposure to free aflibercept between GA groups were observed. When 
comparing the mean values in the different groups, the numbers per group as well as the high 
variability of data should be considered. Across all time points, no relevant difference between males 
and females was observed. Differences in mean concentrations were most likely a result of extreme 
values in the respective group (male or female) rather than a real difference in groups. Likewise, the 
comparison between regions did not reveal any relevant and consistent differences among Japanese 
and Non-Japanese subjects. Concentration ranges of Japanese subjects were fully contained within 
ranges of Non- Japanese subjects. Comparison of mean plasma concentrations of free aflibercept 
across different race groups did not show large differences and were mainly influenced by a few 
extreme values. 
There seemed to be a trend towards lower plasma concentrations of adjusted bound aflibercept in the 
GA groups 24 - <27 weeks compared to the younger and older age groups. However, when comparing 
the mean values in the different groups, the numbers per group as well as the high variability of data 
should be considered. Therefore, this difference appeared to be small and clinically not relevant. Across 
all time points, no relevant difference between males and females was observed. Differences in mean 
 
 
 
concentrations were most likely a result of extreme values in the respective group (male or female) 
rather than a real difference in groups. There was a trend towards slightly higher mean plasma 
concentrations of adjusted bound aflibercept in the Japanese group compared to the Non-Japanese 
group. However, the number of Japanese subjects was considerably lower than in the Non-Japanese 
group and concentration ranges of Japanese subjects were fully contained within ranges of Non-
Japanese subjects. Comparison of mean plasma concentrations of adjusted bound aflibercept across 
different race groups did not show large differences and were mainly influenced by few extreme 
values. The Black and African American as well as the Multiple race group contained only few subjects 
with single plasma concentrations. 
For both free and adjusted bound aflibercept, oxygen supplementation at baseline as well as histories 
of previous conditions (history of sepsis, history of necrotizing enterocolitis, history of intraventricular 
hemorrhages) did not reveal any systematic differences between these groups. The largest differences 
were seen at Week 0/Day 1, mainly due to single extreme values. In general, plasma concentrations of 
free aflibercept were highly variable and the numbers per group with concentrations >LLOQ varied. 
There seemed to be a trend toward lower plasma concentrations of adjusted bound aflibercept in the 
subjects with history of intraventricular hemorrhages. Subject numbers in this group were lower than 
in the group of no history of intraventricular hemorrhages and concentration ranges were fully 
contained in the other group. Therefore, the difference appeared to be small and not clinically relevant. 
In conclusion, mean free aflibercept concentrations all declined from Week 0/Day1 onwards 
independent of the baseline BW. Mean adjusted bound aflibercept concentrations increased from Week 
0/Day1 until Week 4 and declined thereafter. Exploratory sub-population analysis revealed no clinically 
relevant differences in free or adjusted bound aflibercept concentrations in plasma with respect to 
baseline BW, gender, race, GA, oxygen supplementation at baseline, history of sepsis, necrotizing 
enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage. 
Distribution and elimination 
It may be hypothesized that the increased expression in preterms plays a key role in the distribution 
and elimination processes of both free and bound aflibercept, leading to a prolonged elimination half-
life of free aflibercept compared to adults. As the FcRn expression depends on the GA (gestational 
age), this may also add to the overall variability in the distribution and elimination processes of both 
free and bound aflibercept. 
Special populations 
Exploratory sub-population analyses revealed no relevant effects on free or bound aflibercept 
concentrations with respect to baseline body weight, gestational age, gender, region (Japan, outside 
Japan), race, oxygen supplementation at baseline, history of sepsis, history of necrotizing enterocolitis, 
and history of intraventricular hemorrhage. 
Comparison between adult and paediatric populations is detailed below. 
3. 
Free aflibercept 
Mean plasma concentrations of free aflibercept in patients with ROP were higher compared to adult 
patients with AMD following monthly IVT administrations (2 mg), but stayed below mean 
concentrations measured after administration of the maximum tolerated IV dose in adult AMD patients 
(1 mg/kg IV, see Module 5.3.3.2, Report VGFT-OD-0305, Section 5.1.1) until around week 4 where 
they exceeded adult concentrations due to slower elimination. (see Figure 1, Tableau 1). Mean free 
aflibercept concentrations in ROP patients declined after IVT administration until week 4. Thereafter, 
plasma concentrations of free aflibercept were <LLOQ in most of the patients. At week 8, there was 
 
 
only one out of three patients with a measurable concentration close to the LLOQ. At week 12, one out 
of seven patients showed high concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma resulting from a bilateral re-
dosing in week 11. At week 24, all 14 patients had no measurable concentrations. 
Figure 1: Individual and mean plasma concentration of free aflibercept in paediatric patients with ROP 
vs arithmetic mean concentrations in adults after IV and IVT 
4. 
Adjusted bound aflibercept 
Mean plasma concentrations of adjusted bound aflibercept in patients with ROP after single 
administration were higher compared to plasma concentrations in adult patients with AMD following 
multiple IVT administrations, but were close to plasma concentrations of adjusted bound aflibercept 
measured after single administration of the maximum tolerated IV dose of 1 mg/kg in adult patients 
with AMD (see Figure 2). Mean adjusted bound concentrations increased up to week 2 and stayed at 
that level until week 4. Thereafter, plasma concentrations declined up to week 12 and were <LLOQ at 
week 24. 
 
 
 
Figure 2: Individual and mean plasma concentration of adjusted bound aflibercept in paediatric 
patients with ROP vs arithmetic mean concentrations in adults after IV and IVT 
5. 
Conclusion 
Taken together, mean values of free and adjusted bound Cmax in FIREFLEYE were higher than those 
seen in adults after 2 mg aflibercept (approximately 25-fold higher for free, approximately 7-fold 
higher for adjusted bound aflibercept) (see Tableau 1). Considering only the mean difference of body 
weight between preterm patients and adult patients (which differed by a factor of approximately 40), 
and the 0.4-fold lower total dose applied in preterms, the differences are within the expected range. 
 
 
 
Tableau 1: Exposure in preterm patients vs adult exposure data 
Exposure for free as well as adjusted bound aflibercept after IVT in preterm patients was more 
important than in adults, and was very variable. However, it was still mostly below IV adult exposure. 
This may be explained by variation of FcRn expression, the variability being also linked with gestational 
age. The increase of exposure, as well as the variability, is to be expected and paediatric exposure 
after IVT has been adequately explored. 
4.5.  Clinical efficacy 
4.5.1.  Main study 
The MAH submitted the results of the FIREFLY study (Study 20090), an open-label, randomized, two–
arm, controlled trial to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of intravitreal aflibercept compared to 
laser  photocoagulation  in  patients  with  retinopathy  of  prematurity.  This  study  is  part  of  clinical 
development programme and was carried out according to the Paediatric Investigation Plan of EYLEA. 
FIREFLEYE  study  followed  the  several  points  discussed  and  agreed  in  the  PIP,  such  as:  indication, 
population,  criteria  of  participation  in  the  study,  endpoints,  number  of  patients  and  duration  of  the 
treatment. Regarding the study design, discussions were held on the number of arms and dose proposed. 
Following exchanges,  the PDCO  agreed with 2 arms (aflibercept  0.4 mg and laser).  Furthermore,  the 
MAH agreed with the PDCO on the participation of all eligible patients in an extension study (not part of 
the PIP), FIREFLEYE next (Study 20275), until they are 5 years of age to assess ocular effects, clinical 
and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 5 years of chronological age. 
Overall, the presented evidence supporting the clinical efficacy of aflibercept 0.4 mg for the treatment 
of  ROP  subjects  was  derived  from  the  full  6-month  data  from  the  pivotal  Study  20090  in  which  113 
subjects were treated at baseline (after randomization in a 2:1 ratio) with either aflibercept 0.4 mg per 
eye (75 subjects) or laser (38 subjects).  
Additionally, a pre-planned evidence synthesis study, as well as the results from a pre-planned interim 
analysis of the extension Study 20275 were provided to bring supportive evidences.  
Methods 
Study design 
Core Study 20090 
This was a phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized, 2-arm controlled study to assess the efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of IVT aflibercept compared to laser photocoagulation in subjects with ROP. The 
study consisted of screening/baseline visit(s) (which could have been on the same day or within 10 days 
of each other), a 23-week treatment period (including retreatment and rescue treatment), and a final 
 
 
 
 
visit at week 24 (could have been between weeks 25 and 27 for subjects treated between weeks 21 and 
23). Study duration was planned for at least 24 weeks. 
Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to baseline treatment with aflibercept 0.4 mg or laser per eligible 
eye.  After  baseline  treatment,  retreatment  and  rescue  treatment  (laser  for  the  aflibercept  -treated 
subjects, aflibercept for the laser-treated subjects) was permitted according to pre-defined retreatment 
and rescue treatment criteria. Retreatment with aflibercept at the same single dose of 0.4 mg at least 
28 days after the previous injection in either eye was allowed, up to 2 additional injections per eye. In 
case multiple laser sessions were necessary within 1 week from baseline, they were counted as a single 
treatment.  Subjects  for  whom  aflibercept  rescue  treatment  was  initiated  were  thereafter  managed 
according to the aflibercept arm treatment regimen. 
One or both eyes could be treated according to the investigator’s assessment of the study’s eligibility 
criteria.  The  second  eye  of  subjects  who  started  the  study  with  one  eligible  eye  was  kept  under 
observation according to the local ROP screening guidelines or at every study visit, whichever was more 
frequent.  Second  eyes  that  developed  ROP  requiring  treatment  during  the  study  received  treatment 
according to the randomization assignment of the first eye.  
Figure 5.5.1 - Study design of Core Study 20090 
The overall designed is acceptable and in agreement with the PIP discussed with the PDCO. 
Subjects were randomised in two aflibercept 0.4 mg/0.01 mL or laser photocoagulation treatment arm 
in a 2:1 ratio.  
The laser photocoagulation has been chosen as comparator. This option was considered as part of the 
standard of care at the time of starting the clinical development and was acceptable from an ethical 
point of view. However, the MAH did not discuss the inclusion of another comparator (anti-VEGF-
agent). This point was raised and discussed with agreement at the Day 120 PDCO discussion for the 
Applicant to provide an historical/ published evidence study with other anti-VEGF. 
One or both eyes were treated, and included in the study based on the study eligibility criteria as 
assessed by the investigator, at baseline or later during the study. Considering that this has been 
 
 
 
 
 
 
taken into account in the statistical analysis plan (see comment further below), together with the fact 
both eyes received the same treatment, the approach does not raise concerns. As a note, in the 
aflibercept group, the injection should have been performed in both eyes on the same day. 
Participants were treated at baseline. However, retreatment or rescue could be administrated from 
Week 1 and for the following 23 weeks the study as per the defined criteria. 
Retreatment 
- In the aflibercept group, up to 2 additional IVT injections may have been administered in each eye at 
a minimum interval of 28 days between injections and in case further pre-specified retreatment criteria 
were met (see further below, under subheading “Treatments”). 
- In the Laser arm, subjects randomized to laser photocoagulation underwent treatment in each 
eligible eye at baseline. Laser ablation should have been as complete as possible as judged by the 
investigator. If multiple sessions were necessary within 1 week from baseline, they were counted as a 
single laser treatment. 
Rescue therapy 
If needed, patients could receive rescue treatment switching to another treatment (patients who 
received aflibercept as initial treatment could switch to laser therapy and vice versa). Once rescue 
treatment is applied to an eye, treatment in that eye with the subject’s randomized treatment cannot 
be reinitiated. However, the fellow eye can still receive the subject’s randomized study intervention, if 
retreatment criteria are met, which is acceptable.  
Extension Study 20275 
Study 20275 is an ongoing, phase 3b, multicenter, extension study to evaluate the long-term outcomes 
of subjects who received treatment (aflibercept and/or laser) for ROP in Study 20090. All subjects who 
were  treated  in  Study  20090  were  eligible  for  enrollment  and  are  being  followed  for  ocular, 
neurodevelopmental, and overall clinical outcomes until 5 years of chronological age. No study treatment 
will be administered. The treatments to be evaluated in this study were administered in Study 20090. 
Subjects enrolled into this study will be followed until the age of 5 years. 
The screening/baseline visit (visit 1a) of Study 20275 was conducted concomitantly with the week 24 
visit or the last follow-up visit of Study 20090, whichever was later, or at a later point between this date 
and before the subject was 13 months of chronological age. Visit 1b was scheduled when the subject 
was  40  weeks  of  chronological  age.  Additional  visits  are  scheduled  according  to  the  subject’s  yearly 
birthday, with the last visit at the subject’s 5th birthday.

Extension study 20275 
The study population consisted of male and female preterm infants with ROP at least in one eye who 
required treatment. The number of subjects is not predefined. All subjects who were treated in Study 
20090 are eligible for enrollment into this long-term follow-up study. Approximately 100 subjects are 
expected to be enrolled in Study 20090.  
Inclusion criteria 
1. Subject was treated in Study 20090 
2. Age less than 13 months of chronological age 
3. Signed informed consent from parent(s) or legal guardian(s), in compliance with local requirements 
Exclusion Criteria 
Subject has a condition preventing participation in the study, or performance of study procedures 
 
 
 
Treatments 
Test product (Aflibercept arm), dose and mode of administration: Single IVT injection of aflibercept 0.4 
mg/0.01 mL per eligible eye at baseline were received by subjects. The injection were performed in both 
eyes  on  the  same  day,  if  applicable.  Thereafter,  up  to  2  additional  IVT  injections  of  aflibercept  0.4 
mg/0.01 mL may have been administered in each eye in case retreatment criteria were met: 
- Presence of ROP requiring treatment AND 
- The interval since the last aflibercept IVT injection was 28 or more days  
Rescue treatment with laser may have been performed if one of the following conditions was met: 
-  Worsening  of  ROP  compared  to  the  examination  before  the  previous  injection  during  the  27  days 
following that IVT aflibercept injection 
- Presence of ROP requiring treatment after the subject already received a total of 3 aflibercept injections 
and the interval since the last IVT injection was 28 or more days 
The  rationale  for  dose  selection  and  the  proposed  initial  dose  of  0.4  mg  of  aflibercept  was  selected 
considering existing clinical data and geometric modelling. In order to limit drug exposure, the lowest 
dose for which positive efficacy was reported was selected for this study. It should be highlighted that 
the  results  of  these  analysis  indicate  a  higher  systemic  exposures  that  are  expected  in  neonates 
compared to adults. Therefore the lowest dose for which positive efficacy was reported (0.4 mg) was 
selected for this study. 
More importantly, discussion on whether in light of the existing clinical uncertainties, the proposed single 
dose  is  agreeable  or  whether  2  dose  levels  should  be  investigated  or  a  dose-finding  study  should  be 
performed prior to the efficacy and safety study. The proposed dose and dosing regimen considerations 
were confirmed to be agreeable with PDCO. 
Reference therapy (Laser photocoagulation arm), dose and mode of administration:  
Subjects randomized to laser photocoagulation underwent treatment in each eligible eye at baseline. If 
multiple sessions of laser ablation were necessary within 1 week from baseline, they were counted as a 
single treatment. Treatment was applied to the entire avascular peripheral retina and was to be kept 
well away from the fovea. Supplementary laser treatments were allowed during the study. Retreatment 
with laser was allowed if both of the following criteria were met:  
- Presence of ROP requiring treatment 
- Fundus examination revealed laser treatment was incomplete as judged by the investigator 
Rescue treatment with aflibercept 0.4 mg/0.01 mL was allowed if the fundus examination revealed laser 
treatment was complete as judged by the investigator and if one of the following conditions was met: 
- Worsening of ROP compared to the prelaser examination  
- Persistence of ROP requiring treatment 28 or more days after laser treatment 
Subjects who initiated aflibercept rescue treatment were thereafter managed according to the aflibercept 
arm treatment regimen. 
For both treatment arms, once rescue treatment was applied to an eye, treatment in that eye with the 
subject’s randomized treatment could not be reinitiated. 
The  Applicant  was  requested  to  address  a  detailed  description  regarding  the  retreatment/rescue 
treatment applied during the study and provide further clarifications especially regarding the number of 
 
 
retreatment in laser arm authorised before switching patient to rescue treatment (aflibercept 0.4 mg). 
The Applicant provided data of retreatment and rescued treatment in the laser group during the study 
(see figure below). 
The Applicant also clarified that multiple laser photocoagulation treatment were possible within the first 
week  and  counted  as  the  baseline  treatment,  and  indeed  one  patient  had  3  laser  treatments  each  in 
both eyes, and two patients had 2 laser treatments each in both eyes. After the first treatment, based 
on the Applicant responses, up to 2 laser retreatment were performed before the rescue treatment was 
administrated. The information provided by the Applicant is considered satisfactory. 
Extension Study 20275 
No study treatment will be administered. The treatments to be evaluated in this study were 
administered in Study 20090. Subjects enrolled into this study will be followed until the age of 5 years. 
Objectives 
Study 20090 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of aflibercept in subjects diagnosed with 
ROP in comparison to laser. 
The secondary objectives were to: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
Assess the safety and tolerability of aflibercept 
Assess the treatment burden of aflibercept and laser 
Describe the systemic exposure to aflibercept 
Other prespecified objectives were to: 
4. 
Characterize further aspects of the effect of aflibercept in the treatment of ROP 
 
 
 
 
5. 
Further investigate the study intervention and similar drugs (i.e. mode-of-action-related effects 
and/or safety) and to further investigate pathomechanisms deemed relevant to diseases of the 
eye and associated health problems 
As indicated above, at the end of the FIREFLEYE trial, if continued treatment was deemed beneficial by 
the investigator, an extension study was proposed (FIREFLEYE extension).  
Study 20275 
The primary objective is to evaluate long-term safety outcomes and visual function of subjects 
included in Study 20090 for treatment for ROP.  
The secondary objective is to describe the visual function and overall development of subjects included 
in Study 20090 for treatment for ROP. 
The other pre-specified objective is to explore further metrics for description of visual function and 
overall development of subjects included in Study 20090 for treatment for ROP. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Core Study 20090 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  absence  of  active  ROP  and  absence  of  unfavourable  structural 
outcomes  at  24  weeks  after  starting  study  treatment,  as  assessed  by  the  Investigator.  Unfavorable 
structural  outcome  is  defined  as  retinal  detachment,  macular  dragging,  macular  fold,  or  retrolental 
opacity. Furthermore, eyes are considered non-responders if rescue treatment was given. The secondary 
endpoints addressing primary objective were the : 
- Requirement for intervention with a second treatment modality from baseline to Week 24 
- Recurrence of ROP from baseline to Week 24  
-  To  explore  new  Retinopathy  of  Prematurity  Activity  Scale  proposed  by  the  International  Neonatal 
Consortium 
Secondary endpoints variables included: 
- Number of aflibercept administrations from baseline to Week 24 
- Number of laser treatments from baseline to Week 24 
- Proportion of participants with ocular TEAEs and SAEs from baseline to Week 24 
- Proportion of participants with systemic TEAEs and SAEs from baseline to Week 24 
-  Systemic  exposure  to  free  aflibercept  (at  expected  maximum  plasma  concentration  and  during 
elimination period from plasma) determined by sparse sampling

vascularization beyond the ridge from baseline to Week 24  
- Progression to Stage 4 or 5 ROP from baseline to Week 24 
- Completion of vascularization of the peripheral retina to within one disc diameter of the ora serrata at 
Week 24  
- Time to completion of vascularization  
- Number of visits required up to Week 24 
- Systemic exposure to total aflibercept determined by sparse sampling 
- Various biomarkers (eg, diagnostic, safety, pharmacodynamics, monitoring, or potentially  predictive 
biomarkers) 
The presence of fundus features was assessed in both eyes by the Investigator before any treatment 
was applied, using wide-field digital retinal photography (images taken by eg, RetCam, Phoenix ICON 
Camera) or as assessed by indirect ophthalmoscopy, according to protocol. 
Safety was assessed based on AEs, vital signs, physical findings, clinical safety laboratory assessments 
and Central Nervous System Imaging. 
Extension Study 20275 
The primary efficacy variable include Binocular best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in Snellen equivalent 
score  at  5  years  of  age.  The  secondary  endpoints  addressing  primary  objective  is  the  proportion  of 
subjects with ocular and/or systemic AEs and SAEs through 5 years of age. 
The secondary endpoints variables include: 
- Proportion of subjects developing unfavorable ocular structural outcome (retinal detachment, macular 
dragging, macular fold, retrolental opacity) at 1, 3, and 5 years of age 
- Proportion of subjects with absence of active ROP and unfavorable structural outcomes at  1 year of 
age 
- BCVA in each eye at 3 and 5 years of age 
- Refractive spherical equivalent in each eye at 3 and 5 years of age 
-  Neurodevelopmental  outcomes  at  2  and  5  years  of  age  using  standardized  development  tests  (eg, 
BSID-III, DAS-II, WPPSI-IV, VABS-II) 
- Proportion of subjects with recurrence of ROP at 3 and 5 years of age

BSID-III, DAS-II, WPPSI-IV, VABS-II) 
- Evaluation of ROP outcomes according to the International Neonatal Consortium ROP activity scale 
- Growth and development through 5 years of age 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  rationale  was  based  on  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  “absence  of  active  ROP  and 
unfavourable structural outcomes at 24 weeks after starting study treatment” and the success criterion 
defined as response probability for aflibercept is greater than the one for laser minus 5 percentage points 
with at least 95% probability. This criterion assumes a Bayesian primary analysis, and would be met if 
the lower limit of the one-sided 95% credible interval for the treatment difference (aflibercept – laser) 
was greater than -5%.  
When  non-informative prior  distributions are used (as planned for  the primary  analysis), this success 
criterion corresponds to a frequentist non-inferiority test with a non-inferiority margin of 5 percentage 
points with a one-sided type I error control at 5%. 
It should be noted that the control of the type I error, as defined in the study protocol, is more relaxed 
than what would be typically expected in a confirmatory phase III trial (i.e. 2.5% one-sided). 
A  broad  discussion  on  sample  size  took  place  during  the  evaluation  of  the  PIP.  This  final  proposal  of 
sample  size  considerations  and  associated  success  criterion  were  confirmed  to  be  agreeable  in  that 
context. 
With at least 102 subjects evaluable for the primary analysis in the FAS and a randomization ratio of 2:1 
(active:control)  to  receive  either  treatment  with  aflibercept  or  laser  photocoagulation  (68  and  34 
subjects,  respectively),  the  defined  success  criterion  would  be  achieved  with  a  power  of  81%  under 
following assumptions: 
1. 
The laser response probability for the study is similar to historic data: a Bayesian meta-analytical 
prediction  based  on  BEAT-ROP  and  RAINBOW  resulted  in  a  posterior  predictive  distribution 
described  by  a  beta(34.7,  13.8)  distribution.  For  the  power  simulations,  the  true  response 
probability  for  laser  photocoagulation  in  this  trial  was  drawn  from  this  distribution  for  each 
simulation run. 
2. 
And the response probability for aflibercept is 15 percentage points higher than for laser, but 
not higher than 95%. 
Respective  power  simulations  were  performed  using  package  rjags  (Plummer,  2016)  in  the  statistical 
software R (R Core Team, 2016). 
No interim analysis was planned. During the study, an external data safety monitoring board performed 
regular safety assessments to determine if the study showed unacceptable risks for the subjects, and 
issued recommendations to proceed or terminate the study. 
Randomisation 
Eligible  subjects  were  randomized  2:1  to  receive  either  treatment  with  aflibercept  or  laser 
photocoagulation,  respectively,  stratified  by  Japanese  and  non-Japanese  sites  as  well  as  by  ROP 
 
 
 
classification in Zone I, Zone II, or AP-ROP according to investigator assessment. If both eyes met the 
eligibility criteria of the study after screening, the eye with the more severe disease was considered for 
stratification. Subjects were centrally assigned to randomized study intervention using the IVRS/IWRS. 
The randomisation process and associated stratification factors are deemed appropriate. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
In general, a subject was assigned to an analysis set if at least 1 eye met the respective criteria. Eye 
level analyses include only eyes that met the respective criteria (i.e. a single eye could have been 
excluded from an analysis while the subject was valid for the analysis). 
The primary efficacy variable was analysed using the full analysis set (FAS), modified full analysis set 
(mFAS), and the per protocol analysis set (PPS). The secondary and explorative efficacy variables were 
analysed using the FAS and mFAS. The FAS analysis was considered to be the primary analysis in both 
cases, while the mFAS and PPS were considered supportive. Safety variables were analysed based on 
the safety analysis set (SAF). Pharmacokinetic-related analyses were performed based on the 
pharmacokinetic analysis set (PKS). 
The FAS included all subjects who received any study treatment and had a baseline and at least one 
post-baseline assessment of efficacy. The analysis on the FAS was performed according to the 
treatment assigned at baseline (as randomized). 
The mFAS included all subjects with central reading centre positive confirmed disease stages meeting 
the inclusion criteria who completed baseline treatment, had a baseline and at least one post-baseline 
central reading centre assessment of efficacy. The analysis on the mFAS was performed according to 
the treatment assigned at baseline (as randomized). 
The PPS included all subjects in the mFAS who had no validity findings or important deviations that 
could have affected the primary efficacy variable. The analysis of the PPS was performed according to 
the treatment the subject actually received (as treated; determined by the first study treatment that 
the subject actually received during the study). 
The SAF included all subjects who received any type of study treatment. The analysis of the SAF was 
performed according to the treatment the subject actually received (as treated; determined by the first 
study treatment that the subject actually received during the study). 
The PKS included all subjects who received aflibercept treatment at the baseline visit and who had at 
least one nonmissing PK assessment following the first dose of study drug. 
Immunogenicity analysis sets: ADA data were analyzed using the ADA analysis set (AAS) and 
neutralizing antibody (NAb) data was analyzed using the NAb analysis set (NAS). 
The AAS included all subjects who received aflibercept at baseline and had at least 1 nonmissing result 
in the ADA assay following the first study dose. The NAS included all subjects who received aflibercept 
at baseline and with at least 1 nonmissing result in the NAb assay. Subjects who were with negative 
ADA response and those who were with positive but not treatment-emergent ADA response were set to 
negative in the NAS. Analysis of both immunogenicity analysis sets were performed according to the 
treatment the subject actually received (as treated). 
Success criterion and type I error control 
 
 
 
The success criterion is derived from the Bayesian primary analysis and is defined as “response 
probability for aflibercept is greater than the one for laser minus 5 percentage points with at least 95% 
probability”, i.e.: 
P(response probability for aflibercept > (response probability for laser -5%) ) ≥ 95%. 
This is the case if the lower limit of the one-sided 95% credible interval for the treatment difference 
(aflibercept – laser) is greater than -5%. As noninformative prior distributions were used for the 
analysis this success criterion corresponds to a frequentist non-inferiority test with a non-inferiority 
margin of 5 percentage points and a one-sided type I error control at 5%. 
The posterior distribution of both response probabilities, as well as the difference in response 
probabilities are displayed using normal kernel densities. 
If the success criterion was met, in a second step superiority of aflibercept over laser was evaluated by 
comparing the lower limit of the 95% one-sided credible interval with 0.  
There was no type I error control for secondary endpoint analyses. 
Primary endpoint analysis 
The following conditions were followed in the analysis of the data: 
1. 
2. 
Primary analysis: The data was analysed by a Bayesian statistical model. 
Success criterion defined as “response probability for aflibercept is greater than the one for 
laser minus 5 percentage points with at least 95% probability” 
3. 
One eye or both eyes of a patient were included into the analysis to determine the primary 
endpoint on a patient level, if treated and meeting the inclusion criteria. 
4. 
90% credible intervals were provided for the probability of response. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with absence of active ROP and 
unfavourable structural outcomes at 24 weeks after starting study treatment, based on the 
investigator’s assessment. Active ROP was ROP (according to the inclusion criterion) requiring 
treatment and unfavourable structural outcome was defined as retinal detachment, macular dragging, 
macular fold, or retrolental opacity. 
Data of a second eye of subjects who started the study with 1 eligible eye and that developed ROP 
during study were included in the efficacy analyses only if treated before or on visit 9 (approximately 8 
weeks from baseline). 
All subjects requiring rescue treatment were counted as missing the primary endpoint. 
A subject for whom both eyes were included in the analysis was defined as a responder if both eyes 
showed the defined absence. If only one eye was treated this fact was accounted for by the statistical 
model. 
The number and percentage of eyes with active ROP or any of the unfavourable structural outcomes 
(overall and by type of unfavourable structural outcome) defined for the assessment of this endpoint at 
week 24 were displayed separately by treatment group using descriptive statistics. 
Primary analysis/Bayesian statistical model/success criterion 
The primary analysis for this endpoint was based on the investigator’s assessment of ROP and 
analysed for FAS and repeated for mFAS and PPS. 
 
 
As it was assumed that in most subjects both eyes would be treated, this was accounted for by using 
the following bivariate binomial model: 
li ~ Bernoulli (p): response of subject i in left eye 
ri ~ Bernoulli (p): response of subject i in right eye 
li and ri are correlated with correlation coefficient ρ 
Bivariate probability distribution: 
Based on this model the probability for a subject to be a responder was 
π = p2+ ρ p(1-p) 
Primary analysis: the data were analysed by a Bayesian statistical model 
Data were analysed by a Bayesian statistical model with a noninformative prior probability distribution 
for the response probability for a single eye (p). For the correlation coefficient (ρ), an informative prior 
distribution allowing positive values only was assumed. The model was based on following distribution 
assumptions: 
p ~ beta(1,1): noninformative prior for the response probability in 1 eye 
ρ ~ beta(1,1): prior for the correlation between the 2 eyes of 1 subject (allowing only a positive 
correlation) 
Based on this model, the primary endpoint proportion of patients with absence of active ROP and 
unfavourable structural outcomes at 24 weeks after starting study treatment (e.g. response on a 
subject level, i.e. π = p2+ ρ p(1-p)) was analysed for each of the 2 treatment groups. 
The Bayesian statistical model itself is deemed appropriate, and was previously supported by the 
PDCO. The study success criterion for the primary endpoint was defined as the response probability for 
aflibercept to be greater than the one for laser minus 5 percentage points with at least 95% 
probability. It would have been met if the lower limit of the one-sided 95% credible interval for the 
treatment difference (aflibercept – laser) was greater than -5%. When non-informative prior 
distributions are used (as planned for the primary analysis), it should be noted that this success 
criterion corresponds to a frequentist non-inferiority test with a non-inferiority margin of 5 percentage 
points with a one-sided type I error control at 5%. As mentioned in the sample size section, it should 
be noted that the control of the type I error, as defined in the study protocol, is more relaxed than 
what would be typically expected in a confirmatory phase III trial (i.e. 2.5% one-sided). Nevertheless, 
these sample size considerations and associated success criterion were confirmed to be agreeable at 
the Day 120 PDCO discussion. 
Handling of missing data for the primary analysis 
All subjects were required to have efficacy assessments 24 weeks (±7 days) after starting study 
intervention. Missing week 24 data for a treated eye was imputed as follows as long as the respective 
eye did not have had an unfavourable structural outcome or rescue treatment before dropping out, as 
in these cases the eye was considered as nonresponding: 
 
 
 
1. If at the last visit before dropping out the subject had no active ROP and Zone II was completely 
vascularized (aflibercept subjects) or laser treatment was completed (laser subjects) the respective 
eye was considered as responding. 
2. Otherwise, if the subject dropped out at or after week 16, the last nonmissing postbaseline ROP 
staging before dropping out was carried forward and used for determining the response in this eye 
(last observation carried forward approach). 
3. If the subject dropped out before week 16, the missing information was imputed as follows: 
a. If there was a clear documentation that the subject dropped out due to lack of efficacy, the 
respective eye was considered as nonresponding. 
b. Otherwise, a multiple imputation approach was used giving the same probability of success 
as subject’s having the same treatment group and initial staging (Zone I versus Zone II versus 
AP-ROP). 
As requested, the Applicant provided a summary of missing data for the primary endpoint and 
secondary efficacy endpoints (requirement for intervention with a second treatment modality from 
baseline to week 24, recurrence of ROP from baseline to week 24), with associated type of data 
imputation. Some differences can be noted in the frequency of specific data imputation rules, however, 
due to the small numbers, it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions.  
Sensitivity analyses 
A sensitivity analysis was performed where the central reading center data was used instead of the 
investigator’s assessment of ROP at week 24 for FAS, mFAS, and PPS. 
A sensitivity analysis was also conducted evaluating the impact of missing data considering all 
dropouts as nonresponders unless completely vascularized (aflibercept subjects) or laser treatment 
was completed (laser subjects) for FAS, mFAS, and PPS (worst case imputation). 
As a further sensitivity analysis, the proportion of patients with absence of active ROP and unfavorable 
structural outcomes at 24 weeks after starting study treatment according to the investigator’s 
assessment was analyzed by the corresponding frequentist approach for FAS. 
Reading center results were analyzed for mFAS and PPS. 
Asymptotic 90% confidence intervals for the difference in response rates were calculated based on a 
2x2 contingency table for response (yes, no) versus treatment (aflibercept injection, laser). If both 
eyes of a subject were treated, the subject was considered a responder if both eyes responded; if 1 
eye was treated, the subject was considered a responder if this eye responded. Aflibercept was 
considered to be noninferior to laser with regards to the sensitivity analysis if the 90% confidence 
interval of the difference was above -5%. 
Asymptotic 90% confidence intervals were presented in addition for the Mantel-Haenszel weighted 
treatment difference calculated using normal approximation and adjusting for each individual 
stratification factor (baseline ROP classification and Japan vs non-Japan). 
It is acknowledged that a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of missing data 
considering all dropouts as non-responders unless completely vascularized (aflibercept subjects) or 
laser treatment was completed (laser subjects). Another sensitivity analysis was requested on the FAS 
where all subjects with missing data are considered non-responders regardless of complete 
vascularisation or laser treatment completion. The suggested sensitivity analysis has been performed. 
As a result of the imputation, lower proportions of patients with absence of active ROP or unfavourable 
 
 
structural outcomes at 24 weeks can be observed in both treatment arms. It is noted that the 
difference between treatment groups is close to zero. 
Secondary endpoint analyses 
Requirement for intervention with a second treatment modality from baseline to week 24 
A second treatment modality for ROP was either rescue treatment or treatment with any other surgical 
or nonsurgical treatment for ROP (e.g. IVT anti-VEGF injection, ablative laser therapy, cryotherapy, or 
vitrectomy) captured as concomitant medication or surgeries after start of study treatment. 
Second treatment modalities other than rescue treatment were identified by: 
1. 
Any concomitant medication starting after start of study treatment with standardized 
medication term in ("bevacizumab," "pegaptanib," "ranibizumab," "aflibercept," and 
"brolucizumab") 
2. 
Any ocular surgery after start of study treatment assessed by the medical experts as second 
treatment modality 
The same Bayesian statistical model as described for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint was 
used to estimate probabilities for a requirement of intervention with a second treatment modality 
between baseline and week 24. As for the primary analysis, a subject might have contributed with a 
single eye or with both eyes. Analyses are presented for the FAS, mFAS, and PPS. 
Missing data regarding requirements for intervention with a second treatment modality were imputed 
analogously to the approach used for the primary endpoint. 
Recurrence of ROP from baseline to week 24 
Recurrence of ROP until week 24 aimed to monitor the disease activity during the study and was 
defined as a need for retreatment or rescue treatment in cases where the question presence of active 
ROP requiring treatment had been previously answered with no. This binary endpoint was analysed 
using the same Bayesian statistical model as described for the primary analysis of the primary 
endpoint. Analyses are presented for the FAS, mFAS, and PPS. 
Missing data regarding recurrence of ROP was imputed analogously to the approach used for the 
primary endpoint 
Number of aflibercept administrations from Baseline to Week 24 and number of laser treatments from 
Baseline to Week 24 
The number of aflibercept and laser treatments from baseline to week 24 were described descriptively 
per treatment arm in frequency tables. In case multiple sessions of laser treatment were necessary 
within 1 week from baseline, they were counted as a single treatment. The same approach was 
planned for the analysis of laser treatment as retreatment or rescue treatment (however, was not 
applicable). 
Accounting for eventual reduced follow-up times due to dropping out of subjects, the number of 
aflibercept and laser treatments from baseline to week 24 were also displayed descriptively for 
treatment completers 
To explore new Retinopathy of Prematurity Activity Scale proposed by the International Neonatal 
Consortium 
 
 
 
Based on the ICROP classification (IC-ROP 2005), the ROP Activity Scale and severity classification of 
ROP (mild, moderate, severe) were derived using the assessments from the central reading centre 
(Smith et al., 2018). 
The distribution and changes from baseline over time of the ROP Activity Scale and the 3 subcategories 
(mild, moderate, and severe) using the assessments from the central reading centre were described 
descriptively per eye by summary statistics (including quartiles), frequency and shift tables. The 
number and percentage of subjects with at least a 2-step decrease by visit are presented for the FAS, 
mFAS, and PPS. 
Subgroup analyses 
For the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, subgroup analyses were performed for the following 
groups: baseline ROP in Zone I (excluding AP-ROP), baseline ROP in Zone II (excluding AP-ROP), and 
baseline AP-ROP. The subgroups were defined twice: based on the investigator assessment and the 
central reading centre assessment. 
Changes to planned analyses 
Protocol amendments are not thought to have affected the analysis of efficacy data. 
The original version of the statistical analysis plan (SAP) was finalised before the first subject first visit. 
Subsequent versions of the SAP were finalised close to or after the last subject last visit, which was on 
12 February 2021. 
Changes to the statistical analysis plan are summarised below.

Editorial changes to the PK figures 
An additional SAP, version 1.0, dated 28 May 2021, described post-hoc analyses that were performed, 
which include additional subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint, an update to the 
calculation of spherical equivalent, a summary of re- and rescue treatments, additional summary 
tables for the ROP Activity Scale, analyses for PK, and summary of all aflibercept-related and 
photocoagulation-related AEs. 
Estimands 
 
 
 
The Applicant provided a description of the estimand corresponding to the primary analysis. The 
strategy for the intercurrent event of rescue therapy was clarified as a composite strategy, meaning 
that patients with rescue treatment were considered as non-responders.  
Upon request, an additional analysis was performed where a treatment policy is followed for patients 
with rescue treatment instead. As expected, this analysis provided a slightly higher proportion of 
patients with absence of active ROP or unfavourable structural outcomes at 24 weeks in both arms. Of 
note, the difference between treatment groups is smaller than in the primary analysis (0.2% vs 3.6%). 
Historical/published evidence synthesis study 
The statistical analysis of the historical/published evidence study was done in two steps for primary 
and secondary endpoints, as follows: 
1. Development of a prior distribution for laser photocoagulation based on published data 
2. Bayesian analysis comparing aflibercept with laser photocoagulation using the prior distribution for 
laser photocoagulation. 
Primary endpoint 
Development of a prior distribution 
For the development of the prior distribution for the effect of laser photocoagulation, only randomized 
controlled studies of a reasonable size that reported results on the primary endpoint of FIREFLEYE 
were selected. Therefore, historic data for ROP laser treatment from large clinical trials, including data 
from BEAT-ROP and RAINBOW study were used as control (Mintz-Hittner et al. 2011, Stahl et al. 
2019). 
As the prior distribution for the Bayesian analysis, the distribution of the potential treatment effect of 
laser photocoagulation in future studies was derived by the meta-analytical predication (MAP) method 
(Neuenschwander et al. 2010). This method is based on a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis of 
published studies and accounts for the between trial variability. Further details are available in the 
technical report / evidence synthesis study report. 
Bayesian analysis comparing aflibercept with laser photocoagulation 
The Bayesian analysis comparing aflibercept with laser photocoagulation for the primary and secondary 
endpoint followed the same methodology described for the study primary analysis. The main difference 
to the study level analysis was the use of the informative prior for the response probability for laser 
photocoagulation derived as outlined above instead of a non-informative prior. The handling of missing 
data was the same. 
Sensitivity analyses 
To facilitate the assessment of the impact of a potential discrepancy between the historic and the 
newly collected data, the following sensitivity analyses were planned  
(a) An analysis with a robust prior (eg, Schmidli et al. 2014): The derived prior was weighted down to 
80 or 90% or even down to 50% and mixed with a uniform distribution on the interval [0, 1]. With this 
approach, if the data collected in study 20090 and the historic data are in-line, the prior information 
will be reflected in the derivation of the posterior distribution and thus will be considered when 
interpreting the data. If there is a major conflict between the newly collected data and the historic 
data, i.e. if the data deviates significantly from the prior data, the posterior distribution resulting from 
the Bayesian analysis with robust prior will shift almost completely towards the newly collected data 
and with this the historic data will be partly or fully discarded in the outcome. 
 
 
(b) A tipping-point type analysis, where the weight of the prior information is gradually reduced. 
Secondary endpoint 
Only the RAINBOW study (Stahl et al. 2019) was identified to provide information on the secondary 
endpoint (Recurrence of ROP requiring any postbaseline intervention until Week 24). As this does not 
allow for a meta-analysis as described for the primary endpoint, for the secondary endpoint a beta-
distributed prior for the probability of not experiencing a recurrence was derived directly from the 
results reported in RAINBOW. 
In general, the same Bayesian model as used for the primary endpoint analysis was also used for the 
secondary endpoint.  
The conduct of an evidence synthesis study, based on a Bayesian analysis using historical data and 
taking between-trial variability into account, was supported by the PDCO. The use of a prior 
distribution following the meta-analytical prediction (MAP) method for the primary endpoint is, in 
principle, agreeable. 
However, it should be noted that only 2 trials (BEAT-ROP and RAINBOW) are used to develop the MAP 
prior. It is therefore doubtful that the between-trial variability was appropriately taken into account. As 
a result, an informative prior had to be used for the MAP prior parameter of inter-study variability. 
A reasonable set of sensitivity analyses was planned by the Applicant to assess the impact of the prior 
distribution, mainly by down-weighting the prior distribution in a stepwise manner (i.e., a tipping point 
analysis). Robust priors were also investigated as part of the sensitivity analyses (MAP prior mixed 
with a uniform distribution), which allow for the prior to possibly shift to the study data when it is in 
conflict with the historical MAP prior. 
For the secondary endpoint (recurrence of ROP requiring any post-baseline intervention until Week 
24), only one study (RAINBOW) was used to derive the prior distribution. This is ignoring the presence 
of inter-study variability. A sensitivity analysis with a 50% down-weighted prior distribution has been 
performed to assess the impact of the historical prior on the posterior distribution. 
It is acknowledged that the use of historical data as prior distribution allow for additional relevant 
information to be incorporated in the same Bayesian model as planned for the primary analysis. 
Indeed, the non-informative prior distributions used for the study-level analyses are replaced with 
informative priors based on historical data in this evidence synthesis study.  
It was unclear whether the distribution of ROP categories (Zone I, Zone II, or AP-ROP) and possibly 
other baseline characteristics were similar in the historical trials in comparison with Study 20090.  The 
Applicant was requested to provide a summary of baseline characteristics in the trials used as historical 
evidence. Some differences could be observed, notably for the BEAT-ROP trial which included patients 
with lower birth weights compared to Study 20090, as well as a higher proportion of patients with 
Zone 1 baseline ROP. It cannot be excluded that other baseline characteristics (possibly not reported in 
the published data) differ between trials. 
As requested, the Applicant also performed an additional analysis with separate priors for different ROP 
categories. These could not differentiate AP-ROP as another category as this information was not 
available in the BEAT-ROP trial. This analysis by baseline ROP category did not lead to different 
conclusions, as a positive treatment difference could be observed in both categories, with higher 
proportions of responders generally observed in Zone II compared to Zone I. However, the Applicant 
could not provide analyses accounting for other baseline characteristics due to the absence of such 
subgroup results in the published data. As a consequence, the potential for bias remains of concern, 
especially as the proportion of responders is higher in the historical evidence. More generally, there are 
 
 
some clear limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting these results, due to the 
inclusion of non-randomised control data. Indeed, the MAP prior used for the primary endpoint, while 
accounting for inter-study variability, still relies on the assumption of exchangeability of control arm 
parameters across trials. This is a strong and unverifiable assumption which would lead to bias when it 
is violated. The same obviously applies to the secondary endpoint analysis which is based on a single 
study and does not account for between-study variability. The robust prior is an effort to reduce such 
bias by increasing the uncertainty in case of a clear prior-data conflict, but it can still occur for the 
same reason.

Recruitment / Numbers analysed 
Core Study 20090 
FIREFLEYE study was conducted in 64 sites across 27 countries. The first subject was enrolled on 25 SEP 
2019. Recruitment was completed on 28 AUG 2020. Last patient last visit was on 12 FEB 2021. 
A total of 121 subjects were screened and 118 subjects were randomized, 75 to the aflibercept arm and 
43 to the laser arm. Five randomized subjects were withdrawn prior to receiving any study intervention 
(all were randomized to laser). In all cases either the parents or physician had decided against treatment 
with  laser.  Thus,  at  baseline,  75  subjects  were  treated  with  aflibercept  and  38  subjects  were  treated 
with laser, and all were valid for the safety analysis set (SAF) and full analysis set (FAS). Therefore, at 
baseline, 75 (100%) subjects were treated with aflibercept and 38 (88.4%) were treated with laser. A 
total of 104 (88.1%) subjects completed the study, 68 (90.7%) in the aflibercept arm and 36 (83.7%) 
in the laser arm. 
The analysis populations are summarised in Error! Reference source not found.. The FAS was the 
analysis population used for the efficacy analyses (mFAS and PPS were considered as supportive) and 
the SAF (all randomised subjects except 5 laser subjects randomized but not treated) was used for the 
safety analyses. 
Table 5.5.1 - Subject validity (all randomized subjects) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total 118 were randomized of which among them 5 patients did not receive treatment and 9 patients discontinued 
after the initial treatment at baseline (9 in total, including 2 deaths in the aflibercept arm). The FAS population 
included 113 patients and the SAF population 113 patients. 
Extension Study 20275 
A total of 90 subjects who received study treatment in Study 20090 were enrolled at the time of the 
data  cut-off  date  (01  MAR  2021)  into  the  extension  Study  20275,  of  which  61  subjects  were  in  the 
aflibercept arm and 29 subjects were in the laser arm of Study 20090. One subject in the aflibercept 
arm with a signed informed consent is not included in the analysis set as no study visit took place at the 
time of the cut-off date of this interim analysis report. No subjects were screen failures, and no subjects 
discontinued the study prior to the visit at year 1 of chronological age. 
At the time of data cut-off date (01 MAR 2021) of this interim analysis, data until 1 year of chronological 
age was available from 89 subjects (60 treated with aflibercept and 29 with laser at baseline of Study 
20090).  Of  these  89  subjects,  60  subjects  had  data  at  1  year  of  chronological  age  (39  treated  with 
aflibercept and 21 with laser at baseline of Study 20090). 
Conduct of the study 
Amendment 
The original protocol (dated 22 MAR 2019) had one globally implemented amendment (version 2, dated 
23 JUN 2020), in order to add at weeks 8, 12, and 24 pharmacokinetic samples to further characterize 
the  PK  profile  in  subjects  treated  with  aflibercept,  document  the  further  elimination  of  free 
(pharmacologically active) aflibercept and bound aflibercept from plasma, and provide estimates of the 
elimination half-life. 
The MAH precise that, several amendments were valid for centers located in individual countries: 
Amendment JPN-1 (specific to Japan, dated 09 MAY 2019) addressed the regulatory requirements of the 
PMDA, and included the following key specification:  
- The primary success criterion agreed with PMDA (demonstration of superiority in response proportion 
over  66%  in  the  aflibercept  group  with  a  two-sided  exact  test  at  a  5%  significance  level)  and  the 
associated plans for statistical analysis was added.  
- The target enrollment of at least 18 Japanese subjects (12 in the aflibercept arm and 6 in the laser 
photocoagulation arm) was specified.  
Amendment  SWE-1  (specific  to  Sweden,  dated  04  JUN  2019)  addressed  feedback  from  the  Swedish 
Medical Products Agency (MPA), and added a stipulation that protocol amendments that are considered 
substantial require approval from the appropriate competent authorities. 
Amendment  PRT-1  (specific  to  Portugal,  dated  18  JUL  2019)  addressed  feedback  from  the  health 
authority  in  Portugal  (INFARMED).  The  underlined  text  was  added  to  exclusion  criterion  number  5  to 
align with the Summary of Product Characteristics: Presence of active ocular or periocular infection within 
5 days of the first treatment. 
Amendment KOR-1 (specific to South Korea, dated 18 JUL 2019) addressed feedback from the South 
Korean  Ministry  of  Food  and  Drug  Safety  (MFDS).  In  order  to  assess  the  suitability  of  the  Bayesian 
method, a sensitivity analysis according to the frequentist approach was added. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Protocol deviation 
Of the 118 randomized subjects, 49 (65.3%) subjects in the aflibercept arm and 18 (41.9%) subjects in 
the laser arm (total 67 patients) had important protocol deviations, most of which were due to procedure 
deviations.  
In total, 38 of the enrolled subjects had important protocol deviations relating to the COVID-19 pandemic 
(24 subjects in the aflibercept arm and 14 subjects in the laser arm). Upon request, the Applicant clarified 
that for these 38 patients affected by the pandemic, a total of 152 pandemic-related protocol deviations 
were  reported  all  of  which  were  of  procedural  nature  (such  as  missed  or  delayed  visits  or  skipped 
assessments). Importantly for the patients, none of the pandemic-related protocol deviations led to any 
missed or delayed ROP treatments. For one additional patient in the aflibercept group, asymptomatic 
COVID-19 without any related protocol deviation was reported.  
Table 5.5.2 - Number of subjects with important protocol deviations (all randomized subjects) 
Extension Study 20275 
Amendment 
The  original  protocol  (dated  22  MAR  2019)  of  the  ongoing  long-term  follow-up  Study  20275  had  one 
globally implemented, non-substantial amendment (version 2.0, dated 27 NOV 2019), which consist in 
the addition of the VABS-II to further standardized neurodevelopmental assessment test and a visit at 
week 40 of chronological age, in order to close the gap between the end of Study 20090 and the visit at 
1 year of chronological age.  
Protocol deviation 
Protocol deviations were not analyzed in this interim analysis. 
Baseline data 
Core Study 20090 
Patient demographic and baseline data are summarised in the tables below. The number of male subjects 
(54.7%)  was  slightly  higher  than  female  subjects  (45.3%)  in  the  aflibercept  arm  but  were  equally 
distributed in the laser arm, 50% males and 50% females. The majority of subjects were White (73.5%), 
while 23.0% were Asian (of which 14.2% were from Japan). The gestational age at birth ranged from 
23 to 31 weeks (median 26 weeks, 0 days; mean ± SD: 26 weeks 2 days ± 1.9), with the majority of 
subjects  in  the  <  28  weeks  category  (83.2%  subjects  overall).  At  the  time  of  treatment,  the  mean 
(standard deviation [SD]) chronological age was 10.3 weeks and the mean body weight was 1965.3 g 
(mean weight at the time of birth: 862.1 g). Nearly half of the subjects had an Apgar score of 4 to 7, 
inclusive, at both 1 and 5 minutes after birth.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 5.5.3 - Demographics (SAF) 
The  ROP  of  the  majority  of  subjects  was  classified  by  the  investigators  as  Zone  II  (63.7%  subjects; 
excluding AP-ROP), followed by Zone I (excluding AP-ROP) (19.5%) and AP-ROP (16.8%) based on the 
assessment  of  the  more  severe  eye  in  case  that  both  eyes  were  eligible.  Within  Zone  I  and  Zone  II 
categories, most subjects had ROP Stage 3 plus disease (Zone II: 52.2% and Zone I: 11.5%). In the 
AP-ROP category, most subjects were classified as Zone I (14.2%). In summary, the most frequent type 
of ROP at baseline was Zone II stage 3 plus disease (52.2%), followed by Zone I stage 3 plus (11.5%) 
and AP-ROP (16.8%; [Zone I: 14.2% and Zone II: 2.7%]).  
Table 5.5.4 - Baseline characteristics per subject (SAF) for Core Study 20090 
 
 
 
Table 5.5.5 - Baseline characteristics per eye (SAF) for Core Study 20090 
Overall, most of baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced over treatment 
arms. Males represented 53.1% of the population. Gestational age at birth ranged from 23 to 31 
weeks (mean 26 weeks, 0 days; mean ± SD: 26 weeks 2 days ± 1.9). At the time of treatment, the 
mean chronological age was 10.3 weeks and the mean body weight was 1965.3 g (mean weight at the 
time of birth: 862.1 g).  
The Applicant was asked to discuss and interpret the impact of the baseline weight on efficacy results 
between the two groups of treatment and included the different origin (Japanese, non-Japanese). The 
Applicant provided tables regarding baseline infant’s data by region (Japanese and not-Japanese) and 
groups of treatment (aflibercept and laser) (see below). 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the difference in baseline weight between Regions does not allow to disentangle any possible 
impact of ethnicity itself. Moreover, results for both Region in term of absence of active ROP and 
unfavorable structural outcomes at 24 weeks tend to be numerically in favour of aflibercept, with with 
a:

- 
mean difference of 0.190 (SD 0.175, 90% Credible Interval: -0.072, 0.505) in Japanese  
mean difference of 0.014 (SD 0.084, 90% Credible Interval: -0.112, 0.153) in non-Japanese. 
Regarding the selected population, patients with ROP in one or both eye with Zone I, stage 1+, 2+, 3 
or 3+ disease, or Zone II, stage 2+ or 3+ disease, or AP-ROP (aggressive posterior retinopathy of 
prematurity) were included. Overall, distribution of ROP patients depending on the Zone/stage 
presented appear to differ depending on whether the classification was done by Investigator or reading 
center. The Applicant discussed the inconsistency between ROP classification by Investigator and by 
reading center: the discrepancy resulted from the fact that the investigator’s disease assessment relies 
on multiple exams contrary to the reading center which only relies on retinal photography. This is an 
acceptable explanation. 
Moreover, the MAH’s proposal of indication in the SmPC do not appear adequate given the available 
data. Indeed, the indication “retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)” appears broader because it includes 
more severe stage of the disease not being assessed or for which even more limited results were 
observed. Therefore, the Applicant was requested to specifically justify including more severe stage of 
the disease in the claimed indication, or restrict the indication. Consequently, the Applicant amended 
the indication (section 4.1 of the SmPC) in order to reflect more closely the studied patient population, 
as follows: 
“EYLEA is indicated in preterm infants for the treatment of 
• 
retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with zone I (stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+), zone II (stage 2+ or 
3+) or AP-ROP (aggressive posterior ROP) disease”. 
However, regarding AP-ROP population, the Applicant was asked to justify that a positive Benefit/risk 
has been demonstrated for all subgroups included in the proposed indication (i.e. ROP with zone I 
(stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+), zone II (stage 2+ or 3+) or AP-ROP disease). The Applicant discussed the 
results of responders patients observed in more severe stage of ROP for which a total of 19 patients 
were included. The descriptive primary efficacy outcomes at 24 weeks (absence of active ROP and 
absence of unfavourable structural outcomes at 24 weeks) were considered to assess patients as 
responders/non-responders. Overall, AP-ROP is an even more rare and severe subtype of the ROP 
disease in preterm infants (rare disease), which explain the limited inclusion. Given the lack of patients 
treated for AP-ROP, the results appear to be difficult to interpret from a statistical point of view and 
transpose them to the general population, even more given the numerically higher observed response 
in the laser group for the AP-ROP Zone I patients and in the aflibercept group for the AP-ROP Zone II 
patients. The response rate is still considered to be high for patients with AP-ROP Zone I, even if not 
numerically higher. It is to note, that there were slightly more patients included in the aflibercept 
group (14 patients, 18.7%) than in the laser group (5 patients, 13.2%), this could also potentially bias 
the outcomes. Therefore, the indication has been accepted. 
Extension Study 20275 
Baseline demographics of patients in the Extension Study are coherent with the core study 20090 and 
comparable across treatment groups. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Core Study 20090 
 
 
 
 
Primary endpoint results 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with absence of active ROP and unfavorable 
structural outcomes at 24 weeks after starting study treatment based on the investigator’s assessment. 
Active  ROP  was  defined  as  ROP  (according  to  the  inclusion  criteria)  requiring  treatment.  Unfavorable 
structural outcomes included retinal detachment, macular dragging, macular fold, or retrolental opacity. 
One eye or both eyes of a patient were included into the analysis to determine the primary endpoint on 
a patient level, if treated and meeting the inclusion criteria. Subjects receiving rescue treatment were 
considered nonresponders with respect to the primary endpoint. The primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
was based on the FAS, which included all subjects who received any study treatment and had a baseline 
and at least one post-baseline assessment of efficacy.  
Using a Bayesian model, the estimated response probability (median of the posterior distribution) for 
meeting the response criterion absence of active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes at 24 weeks 
was 85.5% in the aflibercept treatment arm and 82.1% for the laser treatment arm (Table 5.5.6). As 
the  90%  credible  interval  for  the  treatment  difference  (-8.0%;  16.2%)  does  not  exclude  -5%,  non-
inferiority  of  aflibercept  compared  to  laser  treatment  (pre-defined  success  criterion)  could  not  be 
concluded,  although  the  aflibercept  arm  numerically  showed  slightly  better  outcomes.  The  posterior 
probability that the response rate for aflibercept is greater than that for laser minus 5 percentage points 
was 88.4%.

structural outcomes at 24 weeks based on investigator assessment (FAS) 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.5.5 - Posterior probability density for proportion of subjects with absence of active ROP and 
unfavorable structural outcomes at 24 weeks based on investigator’s assessment (FAS) 
According to the investigator’s assessment, treatment success occurred in 126 (86.3%) of 146 eyes in 
the aflibercept arm and 61 (84.7%) of 72 eyes in the laser arm (Table 5.5.7). The type(s) of unfavorable 
structural  outcome  per  subject  and  per  eye  based  on  the  investigators’  assessment  can  be  found  in 
Module 5.3.5.1 (ROP), Report PH-41617, Table 14.2.1.1/1. Retinal detachment was the most frequent 
of unfavorable structural outcome (5 subjects (6.7%) in the aflibercept arm and in 2 (5.3%) in the laser 
arm).

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  based  on  the  investigator’s  assessment  was  analyzed  by  baseline  ROP 
classification  (AP-ROP,  Zone  I  [excluding  AP-ROP]  and  Zone  II  [excluding  AP-ROP]).  Applying  the 
Bayesian model, the best response seen in both arms was in Zone II. 
In  all  3  subgroups,  the  aflibercept  arm  showed  numerically  higher  efficacy.  The  estimated  response 
probabilities (median of the posterior distribution) by baseline ROP classification were (Module 5.3.5.1 
[ROP], Report PH-41617, Tables 14.2.1.1/14, 14.2.1.1/15, and 14.2.1.1/16):  
- AP-ROP: 73.3% (aflibercept arm) and 72.2% (laser arm)  
- Zone I (excluding AP-ROP): 70.8% (aflibercept arm) and 64.4% (laser arm) 
- Zone II (excluding AP-ROP): 92.0% (aflibercept arm) and 84.9% (laser arm) 
The type(s) of unfavorable structural outcome per eye based on the investigators’ assessment can be 
found in Module 5.3.5.1 (ROP), Report PH-41617, Table 14.2.1.1/40. 
It should be noted that the control of the type I error, as defined in the study protocol, is more relaxed 
than  what  would  be  typically  expected  in  a  confirmatory  phase  III  trial  (i.e.  2.5%  one-sided). 
Nevertheless,  the  success  criterion  (non-inferiority  of  IVT  aflibercept  therapy  to  conventional  laser 
therapy)  is  not  considered  to  be  statistically  met  (90%  credible  interval  for  treatment  difference  was 
−8.0% to +16.2% and did not exclude the pre-specified margin of -5%), although treatment success 
was numerically slightly higher with IVT aflibercept (85.5%) compared to laser (82.1%) at Week 24.  
Therefore, it cannot be concluded that aflibercept is non-inferior to the laser treatment, despite the less 
conservative less stringent statistical approach than usual. Consequently, there are true concerns on the 
 
 
 
 
 
efficacy  of  aflibercept  in  ROP,  and  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  the  treatment  is  inferior  to  the  laser 
photocoagulation, meaning the risk of loss of chance for the patient. All the more, the sensitivity analysis, 
including  the  Per  Protocol  analysis,  are  consistent  with  this  results  and  do  not  show  more  favourable 
outcomes; using a frequentist approach no numerically trend in favour of Aflibercept could be observed 
anymore. However, considering the totality of evidence, including the consistency across endpoints and 
the  possibility  that  laser  had  by  chance  a  high  response  rate  in  this  study  (which  is  to  some  extent 
accounted for in the evidence synthesis study, see below), it can be concluded that aflibercept does have 
a clinically relevant level of efficacy in the target population. This was also discussed by the Applicant 
who submitted literature supporting the clinical relevance endpoint used to assess visual function, the 
assessment  of  the  fixation  and  ability  to  follow  a  5cm  toy  (Bowman,  2016;  International  Neonatal 
Consortium, Smith et al., 2019). 
Moreover,  in  order  to  further  reduce  the  uncertainty,  the  Applicant  was  asked  to  implement  a  post 
approval study. The Applicant commits – as implemented in the RMP - to submit further results until 5 
years  of  chronological  age.  Additionally,  the  applicant  co-funded  a  ROP  registry  in  Europe  aiming  the 
collection  of  data  (eg.  baseline  demographics,  ROP  disease  and  treatment  characteristics  as  well  as 
ophthalmological outcomes from infants treated). The age-related ocular developpement and difficulty 
to perform exams are well understood. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Three sensitivity analyses were performed on the primary efficacy endpoint: 
- using the central reading center data instead of the investigator’s assessment of ROP at week 24;  
- evaluating the impact of missing data considering all dropouts as non-responders unless completely 
vascularized  (aflibercept  subjects)  or  laser  treatment  was  completed  (laser  subjects)  (worst  case 
imputation);  
- the proportion of patients with absence of active ROP and unfavorable structural outcomes at 24 weeks 
after  starting  study  treatment  according  to  the  investigator’s  assessment  was  analyzed  by  the 
corresponding frequentist approach. 
Using  the  reading  center’s  assessments,  the  estimated  response  probability  (median  of  the  posterior 
distribution) was 80.9% of subjects in the aflibercept arm and 77.5% subjects in the laser arm (Table 
5.5.10).  The  response  rates  based  on  the  reading  center’s  assessment  was  slightly  lower  than  those 
obtained by the investigator’s assessment (85.5% and 82.1%) because less subjects were evaluable, as 
not all subjects had images that were assessed by the reading center.

structural outcomes at 24 weeks based on central reading center assessment (mFAS) 
Table 5.5.12 - Bayesian model for Proportion of subjects with absence of active ROP and unfavorable 
structural outcomes at 24 weeks based on central reading center assessment (PPS) 
For  the  evaluation  of  the  impact  of  missing  data,  the  estimated  response  probability  (median  of  the 
posterior distribution) was 79.2% of subjects in the aflibercept arm and 82.6% subjects in the laser arm 
(Table 5.5.13). This approach favored the laser arm as complete laser treatment is easier to achieve 
than complete vascularization.

Similar to the primary analysis, in the analyses based on a frequentist approach estimating asymptotic 
90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  treatment  difference  as  a  sensitivity  analysis,  non-inferiority  of 
aflibercept compared to laser could not be concluded as the 90% confidence interval includes -5% (90% 
CI: -12.2, 11.8). Different to the primary analysis where the response of unilaterally-treated subjects 
was handled model-based, these subjects were considered responders if they met the response criterion 
in the one treated eye.  
For  further  details  on  the  sensitivity  analyses,  see  Module  5.3.5.1  (ROP),  Report  PH-41617,  Section 
9.2.1.1.2. The analysis of the sensitivity analyses by baseline ROP classification can be found in Module 
5.3.5.1 (ROP), Report PH-41617, Section 9.2.2.1.2.  
Supportive assessment 
The primary success criterion agreed with the Japanese health authority, PMDA, was to show that the 
response probability for aflibercept is significantly higher than 66%, which is the one reported for laser 
treatment in the literature (Stahl et al. 2019). 
As for the primary analysis, this analysis was based on the investigator’s assessment at 24 weeks. This 
analysis demonstrated superiority of aflibercept over the historic laser rate of 66% (p=0.0021), which 
can also be seen by the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the aflibercept arm (95% 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CI: 72.2, 90.4) being higher than the threshold value of 66% (Table 5.5.16).

unfavorable structural outcomes at 24 weeks based on investigator assessment (FAS) 
Secondary efficacy analysis results 
The analysis of the secondary efficacy variables by baseline ROP classification can be found in Module 
5.3.5.1 (ROP), Report PH-41617, Section 9.2.2.2. 
Requirement  for  intervention  with  a  second  treatment  modality  from  baseline  to  week  24 
(secondary endpoints addressing primary objective) 
A second treatment modality for ROP was either rescue treatment or any other surgical or nonsurgical 
treatment  for  ROP  (e.g.  IVT  anti-VEGF  injection,  ablative  laser  therapy,  cryotherapy,  or  vitrectomy) 
captured as concomitant medication or surgery after study start.  
Using a similar Bayesian model as for the primary analysis, the estimated median probability for a subject 
to require an intervention with a second modality from baseline until week 24 was 7.2% of subjects in 
the aflibercept arm and 9.6% subjects in the laser arm (Table 5.5.17).

treatment modality from baseline until week 24 (full analysis set)

treatment modality from baseline until week 24 (modified full analysis set) 
Table 5.5.19 - Bayesian model for Proportion of subjects requiring an intervention with a second 
treatment modality from baseline until week 24 (per protocol set) 
Recurrence  of  ROP  from  baseline  to  week  24  (secondary  endpoints  addressing  primary 
objective) 
Recurrence of ROP until week 24 was defined as the need for retreatment or rescue treatment in the 
opinion of the investigator in cases where the question presence of active ROP requiring treatment had 
been previously answered by the investigator as “no”.  
Using a Bayesian model, the estimated response probability (median of the posterior distribution) for 
recurrence  of  ROP  was  16.1%  of  subjects  in  the  aflibercept  arm  and  6.3%  subjects  in  the  laser  arm 
(Table 5.5.20). 
This  secondary  endpoint  needs  to  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Based  on  the  protocol  definition  of 
recurrence only subjects who previously experienced an improvement to a ROP stage that did not require 
treatment could classify for having ROP recurrence. The higher recurrence rate in the aflibercept arm of 
Study 20090 does not imply that aflibercept treatment is inferior.

To  explore  new  Retinopathy  of  Prematurity  Activity  Scale  proposed  by  the  International 
Neonatal Consortium (secondary endpoints addressing primary objective) 
The ROP Activity Scale and the severity classifications (mild, moderate, severe) were derived for each 
eye using the assessments from the central reading center as described in Module 5.3.5.1 [ROP], Report 
PH-41617,  Section  7.6.4.2.4.  ROP  Activity  Scale  values  of  0  to  7  are  considered  mild,  8  to  12  are 
moderate, and 13 to 22 are severe.  
The mean (SD) ROP Activity Scale values at baseline were similar between the 2 treatment arms: 16.20 
(2.81) for the aflibercept arm and 15.63 (3.53) for the laser arm (Table 5.5.23). At each post-baseline 
visit, mean decreases from baseline were seen in both arms with the exception of week 3 in the laser 
arm. At week 24, the mean (SD) decrease from baseline was -15.42 (4.46) in the aflibercept arm and -
14.77 (4.19) in the laser arm.

Table 5.5.25 - Summary statistics for retinopathy of prematurity activity scale from central reading 
center and changes from baseline by visit (PPS) 
During the study, very few eyes transitioned from  baseline to a more severe ROP category: 1 eye at 
week 4 and 1 eye at week 12 (both aflibercept arm). At week 1, about 45% of aflibercept eyes and 62% 
of  laser  eyes  transitioned  to  a  less  severe  category  (Module  5.3.5.1  [ROP],  Report  PH-41617,  Table 
14.2.2/103). At week 24, about 93% of aflibercept eyes and 95% of laser eyes transitioned to a less 
severe category. 
The number of eyes with at least a 2-step increase or decrease from baseline in the ROP Activity Scale 
for the FAS is shown in Table 5.5.26.

Number of aflibercept administrations from baseline to week 24 
The majority of subjects treated with aflibercept received a single injection per eye (78.7%) and were 
treated bilaterally (94.7%). No subject received more than 2 injections per eye (Table 5.5.29). Of the 
75  subjects  with  evaluable  eyes,  55  (73.3%)  subjects  received  2  injections,  10  (13.3%)  subjects 
received 4 injections, 6 (8.0%) subjects received 3 injections, and 4 (5.3%) subjects received 1 injection.

Table 5.5.30 - Number of aflibercept administrations from baseline to week 24 (mFAS) 
Table 5.5.31 - Number of aflibercept administrations from baseline to week 24 (PPS) 
Of the 146 evaluable eyes in the aflibercept arm, 120 (82.2%) eyes received 1 injection and 26 (17.8%) 
eyes received 2 injections. The majority of eyes (95.2%) did not require laser rescue treatment. (Table 
5.5.32).

Four subjects (8 eyes) in the laser arm received rescue treatment with aflibercept: 3 (7.9%) subjects 
received 2 injections and 1 (2.6%) subject received 3 injections. No eye received more than 2 injections. 
Number of laser treatments from baseline to week 24  
If multiple sessions of laser treatment were necessary within 1 week from baseline, they were counted 
as a single treatment.  
Of the 146 evaluable eyes in the aflibercept arm, 139 (95.2%) eyes did not receive any rescue treatment 
with laser, and 7 (4.8%) eyes received 1 laser treatment (Table 5.5.35). Of the 5 subjects with evaluable 
eyes  who  received  rescue  treatment,  3  (4.0%)  subjects  received  1  treatment  and  2  (2.7%)  subjects 
received 2 treatments. 
Of the 72 evaluable eyes in the laser arm, 65 (90.3%) eyes received 1 laser treatment, 5 (6.9%) eyes 
received 2 treatments, and 2 (2.8%) eyes received 3 treatments. Of the 38 subjects with evaluable eyes, 
30 (78.9%) subjects received 2 treatments, 4 (10.5%) subjects received 1 treatment, 2 (5.3%) subjects 
received  4  treatments,  1  (2.6%)  subject  received  3  treatments,  and  1  (2.6%)  subject  received  6 
treatments.

Table 5.5.36 - Number of laser treatments from baseline to week 24 (mFAS) 
Table 5.5.37 - Number of laser treatments from baseline to week 24 (PPS) 
The requirement for intervention with a second treatment modality from baseline to week 24 was slightly 
higher in laser arm (9.6% vs 7.2% in aflibercept arm). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding the secondary endpoints results, concerns on efficacy are further strengthened by a higher 
estimated probability for recurrence of ROP from Baseline to Week 24 in the Aflibercept group (16.1%; 
90% Credible Interval [10.2, 23.7]) compared to (6.8%; 90% Credible Interval [2.5, 13.1]).  
From baseline to week 24, Aflibercept was administered in the 146 evaluable eyes study and the majority 
received  1  injection  (120  eyes  -  82.2%).  No  subject  received  more  than  2  injections  per  eye.  The 
majority of eyes (95.2%) did not require laser rescue treatment. However, 4 subjects (8 eyes) in the 
laser arm received rescue treatment with aflibercept (no eye received more than 2 injections). 
Moreover,  multiple  supplementary  laser  treatments  were  allowed  for  both  eyes  until  3  days  after  the 
Day 8 assessment and such treatments were considered part of the complete laser treatment. On the 
72 evaluable eyes in the laser arm, the majority received 1 laser treatment (65 eyes - 90.3%) and 7 
(4.8%) eyes from aflibercept arm received 1 laser treatment (rescue treatment). 
Extension Study 20275 
No study treatment is administered in Study 20275. Any study treatment for ROP was administered in 
the completed Study 20090. Treatment for ROP in Study 20275 was indicated per investigator according 
to local standards of care.  
Results  on  structural  abnormalities  from  a  pre-specified  interim  analysis  (as  of  01  MAR  2021)  are 
primarily  presented  for  the  60  subjects  with  data  available  at  1  year  of  chronological  age  (39  in  the 
aflibercept and 21 laser arms).  
In addition, relevant further information on ocular efficacy from a total of 89 subjects with data available 
beyond  the  end  of  Study  20090  was  taken  into  consideration.  These  included  data  related  to  ROP 
requiring  treatment  during  the  follow-up  study,  visual  function,  refraction,  ocular  extrinsic  motility, 
strabismus, cataract and myopia, and complete vascularization. Furthermore, data from the full analysis 
set of Study 20090 (75 subjects in the aflibercept and 38 subjects in the laser arm) are presented to 
provide  relevant  efficacy  outcomes  of  all  subjects  who  received  treatment  for  ROP  in  Study  20090 
irrespective of whether they were enrolled in Study 20275. 
Unfavorable ocular structural outcomes/ocular structural abnormalities 
As  in  Study  20090,  unfavorable  ocular  structural  outcomes/ocular  structural  abnormalities  in  Study 
20275 included retinal detachment, macular dragging, macular fold, or retrolental opacity as assessed 
by the investigator.  
In the group of subjects with available 1-year of chronological age data, none of the 39 (100%) subjects 
(75  eyes)  in  the  aflibercept  arm  had  any  new  unfavorable  structural  outcomes.  Of  the  21  (100%) 
subjects (40 eyes) in the laser arm, 1 (4.8%) subject experienced an unfavourable structural outcome, 
which was retinal detachment in 1 (2.5%) eye (Table 5.5.38). Results were the same for the time up 
until the visit at 1 year of chronological age. 
 
 
Table 5.5.38 - Number of subjects with unfavorable structural outcomes at age 1 year based on 
investigator assessment (all subjects who completed visit at 1 year of chronological age) 
The subject in the laser arm, Subject 510090001, who experienced retinal detachment in Study 20090, 
was treated bilaterally with laser at baseline of Study 20090 for bilateral ROP Zone I stage 3 plus, re-
treated with laser twice on each eye (after 8 and 10 days from the previous laser treatment) and rescued 
with  aflibercept  once  on  each  eye  (3  days  after  last  laser  re-treatment).  Unilateral  (right)  retinal 
detachment (ROP stage 4A) was reported at the week 4 visit and progressed to ROP stage 4B at the 
week 10 visit of Study 20090 (as reported in the subject’s narrative, in Module 5.3.5.1 [ROP], Report 
PH-41617, Section 15). 
Absence  of  active  ROP  and  unfavorable  ocular  structural  outcomes/ocular  structural 
abnormalities 
Absence of active ROP was defined as the absence of “ROP requiring treatment (according to the inclusion 
criteria of Study 20090)”.  
The number of subjects with absence of ROP and unfavorable structural outcomes based on investigator 
assessment at the visit at 1 year of chronological age is summarized in Table 5.5.39. 
Of the 39 subjects in the aflibercept arm who reached the 1 year of age visit, 36 (92.3%) subjects were 
treated bilaterally in Study 20090 and 3 (7.7%) subjects were treated unilaterally. Of the 36 bilaterally-
treated  subjects,  35  (97.2%)  subjects  showed  response  in  both  eyes  and  1  (2.8%)  subject  showed 
response in 1 eye after bilateral treatment received in Study 20090; 3 subjects showed response in their 
single eye. 
 
 
 
 
 
Of  the  21  subjects  in  the  laser  arm  who  reached  the  1  year  of  age  visit,  19  (90.5%)  subjects  were 
treated bilaterally in Study 20090 and 2 (9.5%) subjects were treated unilaterally. Of the 19 bilaterally-
treated subjects in the laser arm, 17 (89.5%) subjects showed response in both eyes and no subjects 
showed response in 1 eye after bilateral treatment in Study 20090; both unilaterally-treated subjects 
showed response in their single eye. 
ROP treatment after entry into the follow-up Study 20275 was not indicated by the investigators for any 
subjects with data available at the visit at 1 year of chronological age. 
Table 5.5.39 - Number of subjects with absence of active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes at 
1 year of chronological age visit based on investigator assessment (all subjects who completed visit at 
1 year of chronological age) 
Table  5.5.40  displays  the  number  of  subjects  with  absence  of  active  ROP  and  unfavorable  structural 
outcomes until 1 year of chronological age based on the investigator assessment based on all available 
data for all subjects in the FAS of Study 20090, i.e., for all subjects that had been treated at baseline in 
Study 20090. Of the 75 subjects in the aflibercept arm in the FAS of Study 20090, 71 (94.7%) subjects 
were bilaterally-treated in Study 20090 and 4 (5.3%) subjects were unilaterally-treated in Study 20090. 
Of the 71 bilaterally-treated subjects, 59 (83.1%) showed response in both eyes and 4 (5.6%) subjects 
showed response in 1 eye after bilateral treatment received in Study 20090; all 4 unilaterally-treated 
subjects showed response in their single eye. 
 
 
 
Table 5.5.40 - Number of subjects with absence of active ROP and unfavorable structural outcomes at 
1 year of chronological age visit based on investigator assessment (full analysis set of 20090) 
Of the 38 subjects in the laser arm in the FAS of Study 20090, 34 (89.5%) subjects were bilaterally-
treated and 4 (10.5%) subjects were unilaterally-treated in Study 20090. Of the 34 bilaterally-treated 
subjects, 28 (82.4%) subjects showed response in both eyes and 1 subject (2.9%) showed response in 
1  eye  after  bilateral  treatment  in  Study  20090;  all  4  unilaterallytreated  subjects  showed  response  in 
their single eye. 
For 3 subjects (6 [4.1%] of 146 eyes) treated with aflibercept at baseline in Study 20090, ROP treatment 
Study 20275 was indicated by the investigator (Table 5.5.40 and 5.5.41). All 3 subjects were already 
non-responders for the primary endpoint in Study 20090. 
Table 5.5.41 - Number of subjects requiring further treatment until 1 year of age (all subjects entering 
extension) 
Subjects requiring treatment for ROP during extension Study 20275 
None of the subjects in Study 20275 who completed the visit at 1 year of chronological age visit in the 
aflibercept and laser arms required treatment for ROP during Study 20275.  
Among  the  89  subjects  who  entered  the  extension  Study  20275,  3  (5.0%)  of  the  60  subjects  in  the 
aflibercept arm, and no subjects in the laser arm required treatment for ROP after transition to Study 
20275 and before the visit at 1 year of chronological age. Each of these 3 subjects was treated upon 
investigators’ discretion in Study 20275 for ROP outcomes already present in the Study 20090, i.e. all 3 
subjects were non-responders and represented treatment failures in Study 20090. They are summarized 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as  follows:  1  subject  received  bilateral  anti-VEGF  treatment  (ranibizumab)  and  unilateral  laser  at 
screening/baseline  in  Study  20275;  1  subject  required  treatment  at  an  unscheduled  visit  after 
screening/baseline (vitrectomy of the left eye); the other subject required bilateral laser treatment at 
an unscheduled visit after visit 1b (i.e. after visit at 40 weeks of chronological age) and received bilateral 
laser treatment. 
Details of these subjects can be found in Module 5.3.5.1 (ROP), Report PH-41618, Section 9.2.1.3. 
Subjects requiring ophthalmological treatment 
Ophthalmological  treatment  was  defined  as  either  reported  co-medication  for  an  eye  or  as  surgical 
procedure of an eye that is beyond study treatment or study procedures.  
At 1 year of chronological age, 3 (7.7%) of the 39 subjects in the aflibercept arm and 1 (4.8%) of 21 
subjects in the laser arm had ophthalmological treatment during the extension study (Table 5.5.42). 
Table 5.5.42 - Number of subjects with ophthalmologic treatment during the extension until 1 year of 
age (all subjects who completed visit at 1 year of chronological age) 
Of  all  89  subjects  who  entered  the  ongoing  extension  Study  20275,  6  (10.0%)  of  60  subjects  in  the 
aflibercept arm and 1 (3.4%) of 29 subjects in the laser arm had ophthalmological treatment during the 
extension study (Table 5.5.43). 
Table 5.5.43 - Number of subjects with ophthalmologic treatment during the extension until 1 year of 
age (all subjects entering extension) 
Evaluation of visual function and refraction and structural outcomes 
At  the  1  year  of  chronological  age  time  point,  all  75  eyes  in  the  aflibercept  arm  were  reported  with 
normal retina, attached to periphery and 39 (97.5%) out of 40 eyes in the laser arm were reported with 
normal retina, attached to periphery; similar proportions were seen at week 24 (end of Study 20090)( 
Table 5.5.44). The percentages are based on the number of eyes with reported data.

age (study 20275): Abnormalities of the retina (all subjects who completed visit at 1 year of 
chronological age) 
At the 1 year of chronological age time point, no eyes in either arm had optic nerve hypoplasia or optic 
nerve atrophy; these results were identical to week 24 (end of Study 20090)( Table 5.5.45). The number 
of  eyes  with large  excavation  of  optic  disc  did  not  change  from  the  end  of  Study  20090  to  1  year  of 
chronological age for both aflibercept (5 [6.8%]) and laser (0 [0.0%]) arms. At the end of Study 20090, 
1 (2.6%) eye in the laser arm had posterior subcapsular cataract of 1+ density at week 24 (for which 
surgery was applied), but no cataracts were reported at 1 year of chronological age; no cataracts were 
reported in the aflibercept arm at either time point.

age  (study  20275):  Abnormalities  of  the  optic  nerve  (all  subjects  who  completed  visit  at  1  year  of 
chronological age) 
At  the week  24 (end  of  Study  20090)  time point, all  eyes in  the aflibercept and laser arms had light 
reaction; these results were identical to 1 year of chronological age time point (Table 5.5.46). All eyes 
in the aflibercept arm had central fixation and the ability to fix and follow a 5-cm toy at week 24 of Study 
20090 and at the 1 year of chronological age time point. In the laser arm, 2 (5.1%) eyes were reported 
with no central fixation and no ability to fix and follow a 5-cm toy at week 24; at 1 year of age, 1 (2.5%) 
eye was reported with these results. There were no reported abnormal visual evoked potentials at week 
24 in either arm. At the 1 year of chronological age time point in Study 20275, no eyes in the aflibercept 
arm were reported with abnormal visual evoked potentials and 2 eyes in laser arm was reported with 
abnormal visual evoked potentials. No eyes were reported with ocular palsy at the end of Study 20090; 
at the 1 year of chronological age time point in Study 20275, 1 (1.3%) eye in the aflibercept arm had 
ocular palsy of the cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve).

For  cycloplegic  refraction,  the  refractive  spherical  equivalent  (SE)  was  calculated  as:  sphere  +  ½ 
cylinder. 
In the aflibercept arm, mean SE (SD) at week 24 (end of Study 20090)2 and at 1 year of chronological 
age in Study 20275 were +0.80 (2.72) diopters (D) and -0.22 (2.93) D respectively. The SE range were 
-10.62 D to +6.00 D at week 24 (end of Study 20090) and - 13.00 D to +3.50 D at 1 year of chronological 
age in Study 20275. 
For laser arm, mean SE (SD) at week 24 (end of Study 20090) and at 1 year of chronological age in 
Study  20275 were  +0.35  (3.35) D  and  -0.56 (2.88) D  respectively.  The  SE  range were  -  11.00 D  to 
+5.50 D at week 24 (end of Study 20090) and -10.25 D to +4.50 D at 1 year of chronological age in 
Study 20275 (Module 5.3.5.1 [ROP], Report PH-41618, post-hoc Table 16.4.1.1/1). 
Mean (SD) axis values were similar at 1 year of chronological age in Study 20275 and at week 24 of 
Study 20090 in the aflibercept arm (112.89 [67.21] degrees and 100.42 [70.02] degrees, respectively) 
as well as in the laser arm (87.65 [74.98] and 88.33 [69.62], respectively) (Table 5.5.47).

chronological age) 
The majority of eyes in the aflibercept arm had no manifest strabismus at 1 year of chronological age 
and at week 24 (end of Study 20090); the proportion was similar at both time points but slightly higher 
at the 1 year of  chronological  age time point  (72 [96.0%] eyes,  as compared to 66 [90.4%] eyes at 
week 24 of Study 20090). In the laser arm, 33 (84.6%) eyes were without manifest strabismus at the 
week 24 in Study 20090, as compared to 34 (85.0%) eyes at the 1 year of chronological age time point. 
No eyes in the aflibercept arm had nystagmus in primary position at either time point; in the laser arm, 
the majority of eyes had no nystagmus in primary position, though the proportion was slightly higher at 
the 1 year of chronological age time point (38 [95.0%] eyes, as compared to 35 [89.7%] eyes at week 
24 of Study 20090) (Table 5.5.48).

ROP outcomes according to the Neonatal Consortium ROP activity scale 
The  ROP  Activity  Scale  values  were  derived  for  each  eye  by  investigator  assessment  as  displayed  in 
Module  5.3.5.1  (ROP),  Report  PH-41618,  Section  7.6.4.5.  ROP  Activity  Scale  values  of  0  to  7  are 
considered as mild, 8 to 12 moderate, and 13 to 22 severe ROP activity.  
Considering all subjects who completed visit at 1 year of chronological age, the mean (SD) ROP Activity 
Scale values by eye were similar between the 2 treatment arms at baseline in Study 20090 (15.00 [2.11] 
for the aflibercept arm and 14.88 [2.49] for the laser arm. At the screening/baseline visit for the 20275 
study, a mean decrease in ROP Activity Scale values from baseline of Study 20090 was observed in both 
the aflibercept arm (-14.08 [3.04]) and the laser arm (-13.90 [3.71]). These decreases were sustained 
through  the  visit  at  1  year  of  chronological  age;  at  this  visit,  a  mean  decrease  in  ROP  Activity  Scale 
values from baseline of Study 20090 of -14.67 (2.43) was observed for the aflibercept arm and a mean 
decrease of -14.35 (3.72) was observed for the laser arm (Table 5.5.49).

Considering all subjects who had entered the extension Study 20275, the mean (SD) ROP Activity Scale 
values by eye were similar between the 2 treatment arms at baseline in Study 20090 (15.62 [2.27] for 
the  aflibercept  arm  and 14.87  [2.32]  for  the  laser  arm.  At  the  screening/baseline  visit  for  the  20275 
study, a mean decrease in ROP Activity Scale values from baseline of Study 20090 was observed in both 
the aflibercept arm (-14.06 [4.71]) and the laser arm (-14.20 [3.24]). These decreases were sustained 
through the visit at 1 year of chronological age; at this visit, a mean decrease in ROP Activity Scale value 
from baseline of Study 20090 of -14.67 (2.43) was observed for the aflibercept arm and a mean decrease 
of - 14.35 (3.72) was observed for the laser arm (Table 5.5.50).

assessment and changes from baseline of study 20090 by visit (all subjects entering extension) 
Subjects with complete vascularization assessed by indirect ophthalmoscopy 
Considering all subjects who completed the visit at 1 year of chronological age, 52 (45.2%) eyes had 
complete  vascularization  at  week  24  (end  of  Study  20090)  and  71  (61.7%)  eyes  had  complete 
 
 
 
 
vascularization at 1 year of chronological age. In the aflibercept arm, 35 (46.7%) eyes had complete 
vascularization at week 24 (end of Study 20090) and 52 (69.3%) eyes had complete vascularization at 
1 year of chronological age; while in the laser arm, 17 (42.5%) eyes had complete vascularization at 
week 24 and 19 (47.5%) eyes had complete vascularization at 1 year of chronological age (Table 5.5.51). 
Table 5.5.51 - Number of eyes with completion of vascularization of the peripheral retina according to 
investigator assessment to Week 24 and at 1 year of age (all subjects who completed visit at 1 year of 
chronological age) 
Of all subjects who had entered the extension Study 20275, a total of 75 (44.1%) eyes had complete 
vascularization at week 24 and a total  of  94  (55.3%)  eyes had  complete vascularization  at 1 year of 
chronological age (considering last observation carried forward [LOCF] approach). In the aflibercept arm, 
52  (44.8%)  eyes  had  complete  vascularization  at  week  24  and  71  (61.2%)  eyes  had  complete 
vascularization at 1 year of chronological age, while in the laser arm, 23 (42.6%) eyes had complete 
vascularization at week 24, which was identical to the number of eyes that had complete vascularization 
at 1 year of chronological age (Table 5.5.52). 
Table 5.5.52 - Number of eyes with completion of vascularization of the peripheral retina according to 
investigator assessment to Week 24 and at 1 year of age (all subjects entering extension) 
Considering the FAS of Study 20090, 88 (40.4%) eyes had complete vascularization at week 24 (end of 
Study  20090)  and  107  (49.1%)  eyes  had  complete  vascularization  at  1  year  of  chronological  age 
(considering LOCF approach). In the aflibercept arm, 57 (39.0%) eyes had complete vascularization at 
week 24 and 76 (52.1%) eyes had complete vascularization at 1 year of chronological age, while in the 
laser arm, 31 (43.1%) eyes had complete vascularization at week 24 and at 1 year of chronological age 
(Table 5.5.53).

investigator assessment to Week 24 and at 1 year of age (full analysis set of 20090) 
In conclusion, the current data available on very few patients are still insufficient to conclude on long-
term visual outcomes. The MAH was asked to provide the cut-off data at 2 year of chronological age for 
the extension study 20275. The applicant provided data of patient who underwent the 2nd year visit (54 
infants: 36 aflibercept group and 18 laser group), wich tend to confirm long term efficacy of aflibercept. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Residual uncertainty is considered acceptable at this stage, and will be in the future further minimised 
by the submission of longer-term results as per RMP. 
Assessment of the Summative Usability Evaluation 
This  study  was  intended  to  demonstrate  that  the  pediatric  dosing  device  can  be  used  safely  and 
effectively by the intended users, for the intended uses, and in the intended use environments – that is, 
without use errors that could lead to serious harm for which further mitigation would be practicable. 
The summative usability evaluation involved simulated use testing of all critical tasks as well as hazard-
related use scenarios that have been identified based on the use risk analysis. 
Participants  were  scheduled  t  be  at  least  15  physicians  who  perform  intravitreal  injections  to  treat 
prematurely born patients with ROP. In setups where ophthalmic technicians, assistant physicians and/or 
nurses  are  taking  over  some  of  the  tasks,  they  could  also  be  included  into  summative  usability 
evaluation. Training and familiarization will be representative for the real-world situation. 
Any observed use errors or use difficulties was scheduled to be analyzed for their root cause, the severity 
of harm that could result from the observation and, if needed, the practicality of modification of the user 
interface to further mitigate use-related risks. 
The human factors validation testing / summative usability evaluation was conducted in Germany (Berlin, 
Frankfurt),  France  (Paris)  and  Spain  (Barcelona,  Madrid)  from  04  to  26  October  2021.  A  total  of  30 
participants  (15  physicians,  15  nurses)  experienced  with  intravitreal  injections  in  prematurely  born 
patients with ROP performed simulated procedures,  including  all  critical tasks and hazard-related  use 
scenarios for preparation and administration. 
The human factors validation testing / summative usability evaluation provided objective evidence that 
the pediatric dosing device, when used in combination with the Aflibercept solution 40 mg/mL in prefilled 
syringe, can be used safely and effectively by the intended users. That is, without use errors or difficulties 
that did or could lead to serious harm when used in reality. 
In particular, the study demonstrated the following: 
1. 
The user interface of the PFS-with-PDD combination is adequate to support safe and effective 
execution of critical tasks. 
2. 
The  pediatric  dosing  device  instructions  for  use  is  adequate  to  support  safe  and  effective 
execution of critical tasks and to communicate information for safety. 
Use errors and difficulties were observed related to the removal of air from the system (priming of PDD). 
Subsequent  technical  investigation  provided  evidence  that  the  remaining  air  bubbles  observed  in  the 
PDD  during  the  human  factors  validation  testing  /  summative  usability  evaluation  would  neither  be 
ejected into the eye, nor lead to an underdose. Therefore, it is deemed improbable that these use errors 
and difficulties would lead to harm. 
However,  to  minimize  uncertainty  during  use  in  reality,  the  training  materials  developed  as  part  of 
market access activities (out of scope of risk control) will provide additional guidance for the priming 
step.

Supportive study  
As agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, an evidence synthesis study was conducted based on the 
data obtained from Study 20090 and considering historical efficacy data from literature (Module 5.3.5.4 
[ROP], Report PH-42120). In particular, efficacy outcomes of subjects with ROP treated with aflibercept 
in Study 20090 were compared to outcomes of subjects treated with laser photocoagulation, including 
historic data for ROP laser treatment from the large randomized clinical trials, BEAT-ROP (Mintz-Hittner 
et al. 2011) and RAINBOW (Stahl et al. 2019). The endpoints evaluated were in line with the following 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints investigated in Study 20090: 
- Proportion of subjects with absence of active ROP and unfavorable structural outcomes at 24 weeks 
after starting study treatment  
- Recurrence of ROP requiring any post-baseline intervention until week 24  
To allow for a comparison of recurrence rates in Study 20090 with those from the RAINBOW study (Stahl 
et al. 2019), which compared treatment effects of IVT ranibizumab with laser treatment, this endpoint 
was  defined  differently  in  the  evidence  synthesis  study  than  in  the  statistical  analysis  plan  of  Study 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20090. In line with what is reported for the RAINBOW study, a subject was considered to have had a 
recurrence of ROP if he/she received either a re-treatment with the randomized treatment or received a 
rescue treatment (laser for subjects in the aflibercept arm/aflibercept for subjects in the laser arm). 
The  data  for  the  primary  endpoint  reported  in  RAINBOW  (70.3%)  and  BEAT-ROP  (73.9%)  (Module 
5.3.5.4 [ROP], Evidence Synthesis Report, PH-42120, Section 7.2.1.1, Table 1) were aggregated by a 
Bayesian meta-analytical prediction model to be used in the Bayesian analysis as prior information for 
the laser treatment effect in combination with the data collected in Study 20090. This prior information 
was  centered  at  approximately  72%  and  is  equivalent  to  approximately  47  additional  subjects  in  the 
laser arm. 
The primary analysis based on a Bayesian model resulted in an estimated response probability (median 
of the posterior distribution) in the aflibercept arm of 85.4% and 76.8% in the laser arm. The estimated 
difference between the treatment arms (median of posterior) was 8.5% with a 90% credible interval of 
(-1.7%, 18.6%). The primary success criterion “response probalilty of aflibercept is greater than the one 
for laser minus 5 percentage points with at least 95% probability” was met, as the respective posterior 
probability  was  98.5%  and  therefore  exceeded  the  threshold  of  95%.  The  posterior  probability  of  a 
treatment  difference  >  0,  i.e.  the  probability  that  aflibercept  is  more  efficacious  than  laser 
photocoagulation was 91.6% indicating that there is a high likelihood that aflibercept is superior to laser 
treatment (Table 5.5.54). The posterior distributions for response probabilities for the 2 treatment arms 
are visualized in Figure 5.5.6 and for the treatment difference (Module 5.3.5.4 [ROP], PH-42120, Section 
7.2.1.2). Primary endpoint results for Study 20090 and the evidence synthesis study are summarized in 
Table 5.5.55. 
Table 5.5.54 - Bayesian model for proportion of subjects with absence of active ROP and unfavorable 
structural outcomes at 24 weeks based on investigator assessment (FAS) - (beta(34.83, 13.87)

13.87) distribution as prior distribution for laser) 
Table 5.5.55 - Primary endpoint results for Study 20090 and the Evidence Synthesis Study 
Robustness of the results with respect to the impact of the prior distribution was confirmed in sensitivity 
analyses summarized in Evidence Synthesis Report, Module 5.3.5.4 (ROP), PH-42120, Section 7.2.1.3. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the RAINBOW study (Stahl et al. 2019), 14/74 (18.9%) subjects randomized to laser treatment were 
reported  to  have  received  a  re-treatment  with  laser  or  rescue  treatment  with  ranibizumab,  due  to 
recurrence of ROP. Using this as prior information in the Bayesian analysis of recurrence, the estimated 
probability  for  a  recurrence  (median  of  posterior  distribution)  in  at  least  one  eye  was  26.9%  in  the 
aflibercept group and 19.6% in the laser group, leading to an estimated difference of 7.2% in favor of 
laser treatment. Study 20090 reports 21.3% of subjects requiring a re-treatment with aflibercept and 
6.7% requiring rescue treatment with laser (Module 5.3.5.1 [ROP], Report PH-41617, Tables 14.1.7/1 
and 14.1.7/2), indicating that the recurrence rate for aflibercept is mainly driven by re-treatment. The 
sensitivity analysis showed no relevant difference in comparison to the main analysis (Evidence Synthesis 
Report Module 5.3.5.4 [ROP], PH-42120, Sections 7.2.2.1 and 7.2.2.2).  
In conclusion, while in Study 20090 the estimated response rate in the aflibercept arm was numerically 
higher than the one for laser treatment, the formal success criterion was not met. 
In the evidence synthesis study, clinical data from Study 20090 was complemented by historic data on 
laser treatment; and this integration of historical evidence increased the power for the formal statistical 
analysis. The success criterion (indicating non-inferiority of aflibercept versus laser treatment), that was 
pre-defined  for  both  Study  20090  and  the  evidence  synthesis  study,  was  met.  Further,  the  analysis 
showed a high (posterior) probability (above 90%) for aflibercept being superior to laser treatment. The 
various  sensitivity  analyses  supported  the  robustness  of  the  results  of  the  evidence  synthesis  study; 
there was no indication of a prior data conflict. 
Overall,  -  while  the  exercise  is  to  be  considered  supportive  and  exploratory  -  positive  ocular  efficacy 
outcomes  for  IVT  aflibercept  in  ROP  patients  reported  in  the  literature  (and  as  summarized  in  the 
evidence synthesis study report) were supported by the  results obtained from the clinical Study 20090 
and  the  additional  integration  of  clinical  relevant  data  from  published  literature  as  presented  in  the 
evidence synthesis study. 
4.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The presented evidence supporting the clinical efficacy of aflibercept 0.4 mg for the treatment of ROP 
subjects was largely derived from studies whose methodology was agreed with PDCO. Indeed, following 
exchanges, the PDCO agreed with the proposed study design (in terms of indication, population, criteria 
of participation in the study, endpoints, number of patients and duration of the treatment).  
Importantly, the agreed plan included a pivotal study with a relatively small number in the laser control 
group (2:1, aflibercept:laser), to be complemented with respective randomized controlled data from the 
literature in the framework of the evidence synthesis study. Hence, while a supportive exercise in some 
elements of its nature, this was a priori part of the strategy to demonstrate efficacy. 
Accordingly, the fact that the formal non-inferiority criterion was not met in the pivotal study has to be 
seen in the context of the favourable point estimates, of the support provided by the evidence synthesis 
study,  the  consistency  across  endpoints  (including  the  reassuring  2-year  data  submitted  during  the 
procedure) and the credibility of the mechanism of action. 
The applicant has also committed (see RMP) to provide further data to minimise the residual uncertainties 
on the longer term outcomes. 
 
 
 
 
4.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy in the target population is considered sufficiently demonstrated. Residual uncertainties are 
accepted and will be reduced by further data provision. 
4.6.  Clinical safety 
Overview of clinical studies 
The summary of clinical safety data presented is based on: 
1. 
FIREFLEYE (20090) a completed phase 3 multicenter open label randomized, two arm, controlled 
24-weeks study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of IVT aflibercept compared to laser 
photocoagulation in patients with ROP; 
2. 
FIREFLEYE NEXT (20275) an ongoing extension phase 3b multicenter 5-years study (expected 
end of study date July 2025) to assess the long term outcomes of subjects previously diagnosed 
with ROP who were treated in the completed study 20290.  
Table 1: Studies included in the evaluation of clinical safety 
 
 
 
   
The criteria of inclusion for the study 20090 consisted of being preterm infants, treatment-naïve, with 
gestational age at birth ≤ 32 weeks or birth weight ≤ 1500 g, who weighed ≥ 800 g at baseline, with 
ROP classified in at least one eye as Zone I stage 1 plus, 2 plus, 3 non-plus or plus, or Zone II stage 2 
plus or 3 plus, or AP-ROP according to the International Classification for ROP (ICROP 2005).  
Eligible subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive baseline treatment either with aflibercept or 
laser  photocoagulation,  respectively,  per  treatment-requiring  eye,  stratified  by  Japanese  and  non-
Japanese sites as well as by ROP classification. Rescue treatment (laser for subjects in the aflibercept 
arm, aflibercept for subjects in the laser arm) was allowed in case rescue criteria were met. 
The  ongoing  extension  Study  20275  (FIREFLEYE  next),  a  phase  3-b  multi-center  study,  including  89 
subjects (i.e.60 in aflibercept arm and 29 in laser arm) is to assess the long-term outcomes of subjects 
 
 
 
previously diagnosed with ROP who were treated in the completed Study 20090 (end of study date 12 
FEB 2021).  The baseline visit was concomitant to the week 24 visit or the last follow up which was at 
the latest before the 13 month of chronological age. Overall, 60 subjects had completed their visit at 1 
year of chronological age (i.e. 39 aflibercept arm and 21 laser arm) at the time of data-cut off for the 
interim  analysis  (01  MAR  2021)  contributing  to  the  interim  ocular  and  systemic  safety  data  until  the 
chronological age of 1 year. The duration of 5 years for monitoring is acceptable. 
Overall analysis plan (SAF) 
Study 20090 
Safety analysis for study 20090 included the safety analysis set (SAF) constituted of 113 subjects with 
ROP,  among  whom  75  were  treated  with  0.4  mg  aflibercept  per  treatment-requiring  eye  at  baseline, 
mostly bilaterally and on the same day.  
Safety was monitored and evaluated continuously throughout the study, including a 30-day safety follow-
up period after discontinuation of treatment. Safety evaluation consisted of AEs, ophthalmic and physical 
examinations,  vital  signs,  clinical  safety  laboratory  assessment  and  presence  of  anti-drug  antibodies 
before and 12 weeks after baseline aflibercept injection.

section (subject disposition).  
Study 20275 
For  the  study  20275,  the  population  for  the  safety  analysis  was  the  SAF  (n=89)  which  included  all 
subjects who had entered the extension ongoing study) i.e 60 subjects in the aflibercept arm and 29 
subjects in the laser arm including 60 patients (39 aflibercept arm and 21 laser arm) who had safety 
data available until 1 year of chronological age as of 01 MAR 2021 (cut of date for the interim analysis).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety  evaluations  for  the  ongoing  extension  Study  20275  include  an  annual  visit  until  the  5  year  of 
chronological  age  of  the  patient  with  an  evaluation  of  AEs,  physical  examinations,  vital  signs, 
neurodevelopment scales (BSID-III at screening, mandatory at 2 year but recommended at screening, 
1 and 2 year/VABS-II at 2 year and 5 year/WPSSI-IV at 3,4 and 5 year) and hearing test (BAER at visit 
1 and 6). No treatment was administered in the ongoing extension study.

Upon request, the Applicant has committed to not only provide 2-years and final 5-years data but also 
interim results at 3 and 4 years. 
Patient exposure 
1. 
Exposure to treatment 
Study 20090 
Subjects randomized to aflibercept received a single IVT injection of aflibercept 0.4 mg/10 μL per eligible 
eye at baseline. The injection was to be performed in both eyes on the same day, if applicable. 
Up to 2 additional IVT injections of aflibercept 0.4 mg/10 μL may have been administered in each eye if 
retreatment criteria were met. Patients were treated up to 23 weeks (including retreatment and rescue 
treatment), and had a final visit at week 24 (up to week 27 for subjects treated after week 21). 
Study duration was planned for at least 24 weeks in the study protocol. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The 75 subjects (146 eyes) in the aflibercept arm were treated with a total of 172 aflibercept injections. 
Of  the  146  eyes  treated  in  the  aflibercept  arm,  120  (82.2%)  received  1  aflibercept  injection,  and  26 
(17.8%) received 2 injections.  
The 38 subjects (72 eyes) in the laser arm were treated with a total of 89 laser treatments, among which 
71 eyes were eligible and received laser treatments at baseline. Of the 72 treated eyes in the laser arm, 
65 (90.3%) received 1 laser treatment, 5 (6.9%) received 2 laser treatments, and 2 (2.8%) received 3 
laser treatments. 
Treatment duration ranged from 1 to 121 days in the aflibercept arm and 1 to 75 days in the laser arm. 
For subjects with only a single treatment day at baseline, the treatment duration was 1 day. 
Study 20275 
No  study  treatment  is  administered  in  the  ongoing  Study  20275  as  study  treatment  (IVT  aflibercept 
and/or laser) was given in Study 20090. 
Re-treatment and rescue treatment 
Study 20090 
In  the  FIREFLEYE  study,  of  the  75  subjects  in  the  aflibercept  arm,  5  subjects  had  a  total  of  7  laser 
treatments as rescue treatment in a total of 7 eyes (1 treatment per eye).  
Of the 38 subjects in the laser arm, 4 subjects (8 eyes) were treated with a total of 9 aflibercept injections 
as rescue treatment. On the 8 treated eyes, 7 received 1 aflibercept injection and 1 received 2 injections. 
Overall, in  the aflibercept  arm rescue treatment with  laser was  necessary for 4.8% of  eyes (6.7%  of 
subjects) while in the laser arm rescue treatment, aflibercept was required for 8 eyes (11.1%) for a total 
of  4  subjects  (10.5%)  with  one  eye  which  required  two  rescue  injections.  One  of  the  subjects  in  the 
aflibercept arm received rescue treatment, i.e. laser treatment, for the first eye on the same day when 
aflibercept was initialized for the second eye. Two subjects in the aflibercept arm and 1 subject in the 
laser arm initialized treatments for the second eye after baseline. 
Study 20275 
No  study  treatment  is  administered  in  the  ongoing  Study  20275  as  study  treatment  (IVT  aflibercept 
and/or laser) was given in Study 20090 
2. 
Demographic and other characteristics of study population  
Study 20090 
A demographic graph of the population included in the study 20090 is available in the clinical efficacy 
section.  
Overall,  the  SAF  analysis  population  consisted  of  a  majority  of  male  (53.1%  versus  46.9%),  white 
subjects (73.5%), not originated from Japan (85.8%) and with the majority of subjects in the <28 week 
category (83.2% subjects overall). Patient’s birth weight was for the majority of subjects (68.1%) in the 
500 to <1000 gram category and nearly half of them had an Apgar score of 4 to 7, inclusive, at both 1 
and 5 minutes after birth. The majority of subjects in the SAF were classified by the investigators as 
having Zone II ROP (excluding AP-ROP) (63.7%), followed by Zone I ROP (excluding AP-ROP) (19.5%), 
 
 
 
 
 
and  AP-ROP  (16.8%)  based  on  the  assessment  of  the  more  severe  eye  in  case  that  both  eyes  were 
eligible. 
The subjects in the aflibercept arm weighted more on average, with 19 (25.3%) subjects weighting ≥
2500  grams  versus  2  (5.3%)  subjects  in  the  laser  arm.  The  mean  (SD)  weight  at  time  of  baseline 
treatment in the aflibercept arm was 2027.8 grams (675.69) and 1842.1 grams (554.18) in the laser 
arm. As per protocol, the minimum body weight at time of baseline treatment was 800 grams. 
Most subjects had oxygen supplementation at baseline at a similar rate across both treatment arms, 45 
subjects (60.0%) in the aflibercept arm and 23 subjects (60.5%) in the laser arm.  
Histories of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis were present in 47 (41.6%) and 20 (17.7%) subjects 
overall,  respectively,  with  similar  proportions  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  arm.  A  history  of 
intraventricular hemorrhage was present in 19 (25.3%) subjects in the aflibercept arm and 16 subjects 
(42.1%) in the laser arm. 
Overall, the population of the SAF is consistent with the characteristics of the premature infant population 
affected by ROP condition. Indeed, most patients were born at gestational age below 32 weeks and with 
very low birth weight, i.e. ≤1500g.  
Study 20275 
In the extension study for all 89 subjects who entered the study at the cut-off date, there were slightly 
more male than female subjects (53.9% versus 46.1%) The majority of subjects were White (76.4%) 
and not from Japan (87.6%), the gestational age at birth ranged from 23 weeks to 31 weeks (median 
26  weeks,  0  day),  with  the  majority  of  subjects  in  the  ≥24  to  <27  weeks  category  (60.7%  subjects 
overall). 
Birth weight ranged from 410 to 1780 grams (median 825.0 grams), with the majority of subjects in the 
≥500  gram  to  <1000  gram  category  (65.2%).  The  mean  weight  at  birth  was  slightly  higher  for  the 
aflibercept  arm  (907.0  grams,  SD  =  309.9)  than  for  the  laser  arm  (820.4  grams,  SD  =  252.9). 
Approximately half of the subjects had an Apgar score of 4 to 7, inclusive, at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. 
Mean chronological age at baseline in Study 20090 was 10.3 weeks for both arms, and the mean baseline 
weight was slightly higher for the aflibercept arm (2055.0 grams, SD = 683.78) than for the laser arm 
(1882.4 grams, SD = 579.96). 
At time of entry into the follow-up Study 20275, mean chronological age was 8.8 months across both 
arms and the mean baseline weight was similar between the aflibercept (6.59 kg, SD = 1.13) and laser 
(6.45 kg, SD = 1.21) arms. 
For  the  60  subjects  at  1  year  of  chronological  age,  the  majority  of  eyes  at  baseline  in  Study  20090 
presented  with  ROP  Zone  II  (72.2%,  n  =  83),  with  54  (72.0%)  eyes  in  the  aflibercept  arm  and  29 
(72.5%)  eyes  in  the  laser  arm.  The  greatest  proportion  of  eyes  with  ROP  Zone  II  were  stage  3  plus 
(55.7%, n=64), with 42 (56.0%) eyes in the aflibercept arm and 22 (55.0%) eyes in the laser arm. 
A total of 18 (15.7%) eyes presented with AP-ROP, with 12 (16.0%) eyes in the aflibercept arm and 6 
(15.0%) eyes in the laser arm. A total of 14 (12.2%) eyes presented with ROP Zone I, with 9 (12.05%) 
in the aflibercept arm and 5 (12.5%) in the laser arm. 
Overall,  for  the  study  20275  there  is  no  indication  that  the  89  subjects  included  in  the  study  20275 
relevantly differed from the overall population in Study 20090. 
3. 
Medical history, prior and concomitant medication or treatments 
Study 20090 
 
 
All SAF subjects (100%) had medical history findings (excluding ROP) that started before the start of 
study intervention and were considered relevant to the study. The most frequent PT in both arms were 
neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and anaemia neonatal (in 66.7%, 
64.0%, and 58.7% of subjects in the aflibercept arm and 68.4%, 76.3%, and 73.7% of subjects in the 
laser arm, respectively).  
Overall, there were no considerable differences between treatment arms (using a difference of >10%) 
in medical history findings by primary SOC, with the exception of blood and lymphatic system disorders 
(84.0% of aflibercept arm subjects versus 97.4% of laser arm subjects), cardiac disorders (13.3% of 
aflibercept  arm  subjects  versus  26.3%  of  laser  arm  subjects),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (57.3%  of 
aflibercept arm subjects versus 34.2% of laser arm subjects), and metabolism and nutrition disorders 
(41.3% of aflibercept arm subjects versus 55.3% of laser arm subjects).  
In  total,  75  (66.4%)  subjects  had  mothers  with  medical  history  findings;  54  (72.0%)  subjects  in  the 
aflibercept  arm  and  21  (55.3%)  subjects  in  the  laser  arm.  All  maternal  medical  history  findings  by 
preferred term were reported in ≤10.5% of subjects in either treatment arm. 
For  the  prior  medication  ended  before  study  intervention,  in  both  arms  the  most  frequent  PT  were 
ophthalmologicals,  stomatological  preparations,  and  other  respiratory  system  products  (in  98.7%, 
97.3%, and 96.0% of subjects in the aflibercept arm, respectively, and in 100% of subjects in the laser 
arm for  all  3 classes).  With the exception  of  antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (12.0% of 
aflibercept arm subjects versus no laser arm subjects) and systemic hormonal preparations excluding 
sex  hormones  and  insulins  (52.0%  of  aflibercept  arm  subjects  versus  71.1%  of  laser  arm  subjects), 
there were no considerable differences between treatment arms in prior medications by ATC class.  
Overall, all 113 (100%) subjects took at least one concomitant medication during the study.  There were 
no considerable differences between treatment arms in concomitant medications by ATC class, with the 
exception of anti-infectives for systemic use (97.3% of aflibercept arm subjects and 81.6% of laser arm 
subjects),  antineoplastic  and  immunomodulating  agents  (33.3%  of  aflibercept  arm  subjects  versus 
13.2% of laser arm subjects), and genitourinary system and sex hormones (73.3% of aflibercept arm 
subjects versus 55.3% of laser arm subjects).  
At  baseline,  43  aflibercept  arm  subjects  (57.3%)  and  25  laser  arm  subjects  (67.6%)  had  oxygen 
supplementation. At the week 24 visit, 11 aflibercept arm subjects (16.2%) and 8 laser arm subjects 
(22.2%) had oxygen supplementation since the previous visit. 
Study 20275 
There is no indication that the 89 subjects included in the interim analysis relevantly differed from the 
overall population in Study 20090. 
Adverse events 
1. 
Common adverse event  
Treatment-emergent AE (TEAE)  were defined  as AE  observed  or reported after the first and not later 
than 30 days after the last administration of study treatment.  
Study 20090 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the study 20090, TEAE were reported for a total of 84 subjects (74.3%) with ocular TEAE in treated 
eyes for 43 subjects (38.1%) and systemic TEAE for 63 (55.8%) subjects. The proportions of subjects 
with TEAE was similar between the two treatment arms (aflibercept 74.7% vs laser 73.7%). Moreover, 
ocular TEAE in the non-treated eye were reported for one subject.  
Ocular TEAE in treated eyes were balanced in the two treatment arms (aflibercept 38.7% vs laser 36.8%) 
while systemic TEAE were more pronounced in the laser arm (aflibercept 52.0% vs laser 63.2%). 
Overall,  SAE  were  reported  for  40  subjects  (35.4%).  In  the  cross-treatment  arm  comparison,  the 
proportion of subjects reported with ocular SAE was slightly higher in the aflibercept arm (aflibercept 
13.3% vs laser 7.9%) whereas the proportion of subjects reported with systemic SAE was higher in the 
laser arm (aflibercept 24.0% vs laser 36.8%). 
TESAE were reported for 19 subjects (16.8%). TEAE with fatal outcome was reported in 1 subject (0.9%). 
The  overall  summary  of  TEAE  were  similar  between  treatment  arms,  with  the  exception  that  the 
proportion  of  subjects  reported  with  TESAE  was  higher  in  the  laser  arm  (aflibercept  12.0%  vs  laser 
26.3%)  and  the  difference  was  mainly  driven  by  systemic  TESAE  (aflibercept  6.7%  vs  laser  18.4%). 
Most  of  the  TEAE  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity,  and  severe  TEAE  were  reported  in  8  (10.7%) 
subjects in the aflibercept arm and 5 (13.2%) in the laser arm.  
Table 3: Adverse events: overall summary (SAF) 
Study 20275 
In Study 20275, there were no TEAEs by definition, as no study treatment is administered. AE causality 
in Study 20275 was assessed based on relationship to treatment or procedure in Study 20090. 
All subjects 
 
 
 
 
For the 89 subjects who entered the extension Study 20275, the number of events that occurred between 
start of study treatment in Study 20090 and 1 year of chronological age are summarized below.  
Table 4: Overall summary of number of subjects with any adverse events until 1 year of chronological 
age (Unilaterally & bilaterally treated subjects in 20090) (all subjects who entered the extension Study 
20275) 
Overall, AE were reported for a total of 82 (92.1%) subjects; 50 (56.2%) subjects for the treated eye 
and 2 (2.2%) subjects for the non-treated eye. Non-ocular systemic AE were reported for 72 (80.9%) 
subjects. 
The proportion of subjects with overall AE was slightly higher in the aflibercept arm compared to the 
laser  arm  (93.3%  vs.  89.7%),  while  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  overall  SAE  was  lower  in  the 
aflibercept arm compared to the laser arm (25.0% vs 48.3%). 
Patients who completed the 1-year visit and 2-years visit 
For  the  60  subjects  who  completed  the  visits  until  1  year  of  chronological  age,  37  (94.9%)  subjects 
treated at baseline with aflibercept in the Study 20090 presented with at least 1 AE, compared to 20 
(95.2%) subjects treated with laser at baseline in Study 20090.  
Table 5: Overall summary of number of subjects with any adverse events until 1 year of chronological 
age  (Unilaterally  &  bilaterally  treated  subjects  in  20090)  (all  subjects  who  completed  1  year  of 
chronological age) 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding long-term safety of study 20275, the MAH submitted a first interim analysis of the data at 2 
years of chronological age for more than half of the patient during the procedure and completed data at 
2 years of chronological age for all patients will be submitted in June 2023. 
The Applicant also committed to the yearly provision of longer-term data. 
2. 
Ocular adverse events  
Study 20090  
The most frequently affected primary SOC were eye disorders in 30 (26.5%) subjects in total (aflibercept 
20 [26.7%] vs laser 10 [26.3%]), followed by infections and infestations in 7 (6.2%) subjects (aflibercept 
3 [4.0%] subjects vs laser 4 [10.5%]). All other primary SOC were reported in ≤5% of subjects in total. 
The most frequent ocular TEAE by Preferred term (PT) in treated eyes (with the incidence > 5% in either 
treatment  arm)  were  retinal  hemorrhage  (aflibercept  6.7%  vs  laser  13.2%),  retinal  detachment 
(aflibercept 5.3% vs laser 5.3%), conjunctival hemorrhage (aflibercept 5.3% vs laser 0%), and eyelid 
oedema (aflibercept 2.7% vs laser 7.9%) in the eye disorders  SOC; and conjunctivitis (aflibercept 4.0% 
vs laser 10.5%) in the infections and infestations SOC.  
All other ocular TEAE in treated eyes were reported in less than 3% of subjects in total. 
Table 6: Number of subjects with ocular treatment-emergent adverse events in treated eyes (unilaterally 
& bilaterally treated subjects) by Preferred Term (SAF) 
 
 
 
Severity 
Most ocular TEAEs in treated eyes were either mild or moderate in intensity. Severe ocular TEAEs were 
reported in 2 (2.7%) subjects in the aflibercept arm and 1 (2.6%) in the laser arm. 
Relation to study treatment/procedure 
Aflibercept-related ocular TEAEs were reported in treated eyes of 3 subjects (4.0%), one event of retinal 
artery occlusion, retinal vascular disorder, and vitreous opacities in each subject, in the aflibercept arm 
and retinal detachment in 1 subject (2.6%) in the laser arm. 
The event retinal artery occlusion was reported for 1 subject in the aflibercept arm in 2 eyes. Both events 
were non-serious and were mild in intensity. The action taken with aflibercept did not change and the 
outcome  was  resolved  for  both  events.  The  case  of  retinal  artery  occlusion  is  nonetheless  of  concern 
considering that this topic is closely monitored in PSUR in adult population and its causality to aflibercept 
is still unknown. The event occurred in the two eyes for one subject, was non-serious and severity was 
mild.  Based  on  this  single  case,  no  sufficient  information  are  available  to  associate  this  case  with  a 
thromboembolic  or  a  local  vasoconstriction  cause  nor  of  IOP  increase  related  to  anti-VEGF  treatment 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with aflibercept. Overall, this topic will be further monitored in post-marketing surveillance through the 
PSUR and in the follow-up study 20275 up to 5 years of chronological age. 
The  event  retinal  vascular  disorder  was  reported  for  1  subject  in  the  aflibercept  arm  in  2  eyes.  Both 
events were non-serious and were moderate in intensity. The action taken with aflibercept did not change 
and the outcome was resolved for both events. 
The event vitreous opacities was reported for 1 subject in the aflibercept arm in 2 eyes. Both events 
were non-serious and were mild in intensity. The action taken with aflibercept did not change and the 
outcome was resolved for both events. 
The event retinal  detachment was reported  for  1  subject in  the laser arm in  the right eye twice.  The 
subject first experienced stage 4a of ROP and then the event progressed to stage 4b. Both events were 
serious and were moderate in intensity. Action taken with aflibercept did not change. The outcome was 
not resolved for the first event and was considered as resolving for the second event. 
Injection procedure-related ocular TEAE in treated eyes were reported for 14 (18.7%) subjects in the 
aflibercept arm;  the  most common were conjunctival  haemorrhage in  4 (5.3%) subjects, followed by 
retinal haemorrhage, injection site haemorrhage, and intraocular pressure increased (each in 3 [4.0%] 
subjects). 
Regarding  ocular  infections,  a  total  of  7  subjects  presented  the  event  conjonctivitis  with  a  higher 
proportion in the laser arm than in the aflibercept arm (10.5% vs 4,0%). Considering that premature 
infants are more prone to infections, endophtalmitis, a known risk of anti-VEGF drugs by IVT route is of 
concern  but  no  case  was  reported  in  study  20090.    Additional  warnings  have  been  proposed  by  the 
Applicant in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC for ROP patients which are endorsed. 
Study 20275 
All subjects 
For the 89 subjects who entered the extension study 20275, the proportion of subjects at the cut-off 
date of 01 MAR 2021 with ocular AE was similar in the 2 treatment arms (aflibercept 34 [56.7%] vs laser 
16 [55.2%]).  
The most frequently affected primary SOC were eye disorders in 42 (47.2%) subjects in total (aflibercept 
28 [46.7%] vs laser 14 [48.3%]), followed by infections and infestations in 6 (6.7%) subjects (aflibercept 
3  [5.0%]  subjects  vs  laser  3  [10.3%]).  All  other primary  SOCs  were  reported  in  ≤5%  of  subjects  in 
total. 
The most frequent ocular AEs by PT in treated eyes, occurring in more than 10% of the subjects in either 
arm, were myopia (aflibercept 15.0% vs laser 17.2%), astigmatism (aflibercept 8.3% vs laser 20.7%), 
retinal haemorrhage (aflibercept 8.3% vs laser 17.2%), conjunctivitis (aflibercept 5.0% vs laser 10.3%), 
and strabismus (aflibercept 3.3% vs laser 10.3%). All other ocular AE in treated eyes were reported in 
less than 10% of subjects in total.

in previous study 20090 by primary system organ class, preferred term (Unilaterally & bilaterally treated 
subjects in 20090) (all subjects entering extension) 
 
 
 
From all 89 subjects who entered the extension Study 20275, a total of 8 eyes (from 4 subjects in each 
arm) were not treated in Study 20090; 2 (25.0%) subjects in the aflibercept arm experienced events, 
no subjects in the laser arm experienced events, one (25.0%) subject was reported with events (retinal 
haemorrhage, ROP, and vitreoretinal traction syndrome) in the SOC eye disorders and 1 (25.0%) subject 
was reported with an event (conjunctivitis) in the SOC infections and infestations. 
Overall, ocular AE until the visit at 1 year of chronological age in eyes treated previously in Study 20090 
were reported for a total of 50 (56.2%) subjects. These results were similar to those described above 
for all subjects who entered the extension Study 20275 
Severity 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the 89 subjects who entered the extension study 20275, most of the ocular AE in treated eyes were 
mild or moderate in intensity. 
In the treated eye, four (6.7%) subjects in the aflibercept arm and no subjects in the laser arm were 
reported with ocular events of severe intensity. All severe events occurred for the SOC Eye disorders; 
the PTs for the severe events were as follows: 1 (1.7%) subject each was reported with AE of severe 
intensity for macular fibrosis (in a subject with retinal detachment), myopia, retinal neovascularization, 
and  vitreous  opacities;  3  (5.0%)  subjects  were  reported  with  AE  of  severe  intensity  for  retinal 
detachment.  
For all 60 subjects who completed the visit at 1 year of chronological age, in the non-treated eye AEs 
were mild in intensity for the majority. One (33.3%) subject in the aflibercept arm was reported with 
the PT retinopathy of prematurity of severe intensity. 
Relation to study treatment/procedure 
For  the  89  subjects  who  entered  the  extension  study  20275,  ocular  AE  until  the  visit  at  1  year  of 
chronological age in eyes treated previously in Study 20090, in the treated eyes, 3 subjects (5.0%)  in 
the aflibercept arm and 1 (3.4%) subject in the laser arm experienced aflibercept-related ocular AEs, 2 
(3.3%) and 9 (31.0%) subjects experienced laser-related ocular AEs, and 11 (18.3%) and 0 subjects 
experienced  injection-related  ocular  AEs,  respectively.  Retinal  detachment  was  reported  for  1  (3.4%) 
subject in the laser arm.  In the aflibercept arm events of retinal detachment, macular fibrosis, retinal 
vascular disorder, retinal haemorrhage, and retinal neovascularisation were reported in 1 subject, and 
retinal artery occlusion and vitreous opacity were each reported in 1 subject.  
Table 8: Number of subjects with ocular aflibercept-related adverse events until 1 year of chronological 
age in treated eyes in previous study 20090 by primary system organ class, preferred term (Unilaterally 
& bilaterally treated subjects in 20090) (all subjects entering extension) 
Concerning  the  laser-related  ocular  AE  in  treated  eye,  the  most  reported  events  were  myopia  (4AE, 
13.8%) and retinal haemorrhage (4AE, 13.8%).  
Concerning the injection procedure-related AE in treated eye, the event consisted as follow: 
Table 9: Number of subjects with ocular injection procedure related adverse events in treated eyes in 
previous study 20090 by primary system organ class, preferred term (Unilaterally & bilaterally treated 
subjects in 20090) (all subjects entering extension) 
 
 
 
 
Patients who completed the 1-year visit and 2-years visit 
For the 60 subjects who had completed the visit at 1 year of chronological age, among unilaterally and 
bilaterally-treated subjects, the aflibercept arm had no subjects with retinal detachment and 1 (2.6%) 
subject with retinal artery occlusion, as compared to 1 (4.8%) subject with retinal detachment in the 
laser arm. 
Injection related event consisted of the three SOC Eye disorder, General disorder and administration site 
conditions  and  Investigations  with  the  PT  conjunctival  haemorrhage  (5,1%),  retinal  haemorrhage 
(2,6%),  injection  site  haemorrhage  (2,6%),  injection  site  reaction  (2,6%)  and  intraocular  pressure 
increased (5,1%). No injection related event was reported in the laser arm.  
Laser  related  event  consisted  of  in  the  laser  arm;  congenital  myopia  (4,8%),  astigmatism  (4,8%), 
corneal  oedema  (4,8%),  myopia  (9,5%),  retinal  haemorrhage  (19%)  and  post-procedural  oedema 
(4,8%).  
Overall, AE causality in Study 20275 was assessed based on relationship to treatment or procedure in 
Study 20090.  
Regarding long-term safety of study 20275, the MAH submitted an interim analysis of the data at 2 years 
of  chronological  age  for  more  than  half  of  the  patient  during  the  procedure  and  completed  data  at  2 
years of chronological for all patients will be submitted in June 2023. 
Overall,  data  leave  residual  uncertainties  regarding  long-term  safety  that  can  be  accepted  at  time  of 
opinion but will be reduced through data provision. 
3. 
Systemic adverse events  
Study 20090 
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  any  systemic  TEAE  was  higher  in  the  laser  arm  compared  to  the 
aflibercept arm (aflibercept 52.0% vs laser laser 63.2%). 
For subjects with systemic TEAE, the most frequent systemic TEAE by PTs, occurring in more than 5% 
of the subjects in either arm, were apnoea (aflibercept 2.7% vs laser 7.9%), umbilical hernia (aflibercept 
1.3% vs laser 7.9%), haemorrhage subcutaneous (aflibercept 0.0% vs laser 7.9%), anaemia (aflibercept 
1.3%  vs  laser  5.3%),  and  anaemia  neonatal,  bacterial  disease  carrier,  and  infantile  apnoea  (each  in 
5.3% subjects in the laser arm only). All other systemic TEAEs in treated eyes were reported in ≤2.7 % 
of subjects in total.  
 
 
 
 
Table 10: Overall summary of number of subjects with systemic treatment emergent adverse events by 
PT (Unilaterally & bilaterally treated subjects) (safety analysis set) 
 
 
 
 
The most reported SOC were Infections and infestations, Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders  
and Gastrointestinal disorders with higher rates reported in the laser arm (respectively 28.9% vs 12.0%; 
21.1% vs 14.7% and 21.1% vs 12.0%). 
The most reported events were apnoea (aflibercept 2.7% vs laser 7.9%), umbilical hernia (aflibercept 
1.3% vs laser 7.9%), haemorrhage subcutaneous (aflibercept 0.0% vs laser 7.9%), anaemia (aflibercept 
1.3% vs laser 5.3%), anaemia neonatal and infantile apnoea (each in 5.3% subjects in the laser arm vs 
0% in aflibercept arm). These events are possible complications of premature infants. 
 
 
 
 
However,  two  SOC  are  of  concern  considering  higher  rates  reported  in  aflibercept  arm  and  known 
mechanism  of  action  of  anti-VEGF  such  as  Cardiac  disorders  (5.3%  vs  2.6%)  and  Nervous  system 
disorders (9.3% vs 2.6%). In Cardiac disorders SOC, two cases of bradycardia were reported in aflibercept 
arm. In addition, one event of developmental coordination disorders reported in aflibercept group were 
of concern considering existing clinical data with bevacizumab in ROP as highlighted in the PIP.  
Considering uncertainties of systemic exposure in this vulnerable population including higher exposure 
reported from PK data compared to adult patients, and known effects of VEGF on cardiovascular systems, 
the MAH was requested to further discuss these imbalances of these two SOCs.  
For the SOC “Cardiac disorders”, 7 events were reported in total (5 in the aflibercept group and 2 events 
in the laser group) but the incidences at 2 years of chronological age were similar when comparing the 
aflibercept group to the laser group, respectively 7,6% vs 5,9%. The events occurring in the aflibercept 
group were all non-serious and consisted of bradycardia (n=2, 1 day and 23 days after the first dose of 
aflibercept, recovered), cardiac failure (n=1, 72 days after the first dose of aflibercept, not recovered), 
sinus tachycardia (n=1, 2 days after the first dose of aflibercept, recovered) and tachycardia (n=1, 99 
days  after  the  first  dose  of  aflibercept,  recovered).  All  events  were  assessed  by  the  investigators  as 
unrelated  to  aflibercept  treatment  due  to  plausible  alternative  explanations  such  as  underlying 
comorbidities  and/or  as  unlikely  due  to  the  mechanism  of  action  of  anti-VEGF.  For  the  two  events  of 
transient tachycardia,  one occurred  in  a context of  fever and the other  occurred 2  days after the first 
administration  of  aflibercept  in  a  patient  with  underlying  bronchopulmonary  dysplasia  (BPD)  and 
pulmonary hypertension. The event of cardiac failure occurred in a patient  with atrial septal defect 72 
days after the first administration of aflibercept. 
For the SOC “Nervous disorder”, 30 events were reported in total (21 in aflibercept group and 9 in laser 
group) but the incidences at 2 years of chronological age were similar between both groups, respectively 
19,7%  vs  17,6%.  The  events  occurring  in  the  aflibercept  group  were  all  non-serious  apart  from  two 
events, a syndrome of west occurring 7 months after the first administration of aflibercept in a patient 
with congenital cerebrovascular anomaly recovering after treatment and a cerebellar atrophy of the lower 
part pointing out to a congenital disorder and occurring 7 months after the first dose of aflibercept. In the 
aflibercept group,  two non-serious cases of transient posthypoxic  encephalo-pathy assessed as  due to 
stress  related  to  protocol-procedure,  occurred  directly  after  the  first  administration  of  aflibercept  and 
recovered after treatment. All events reported in the aflibercept group consisted of arachnoid cyst (n=1), 
cerebral/cerebellar  atrophy  (n=2)  cerebral  ventricular  dilatation  (n=1),  Developmental  coordination 
disorder (n=1), Epilepsy (n=1), Febrile convulsion (n=2), Focal dyscognitive seizures (n=1), Hypotonia 
(n=1),  Infantile  spasms  (n=3),  Motor  developmental  delay  (n=1),  Motor  dysfunction  (n=1),  Neonatal 
seizure (n=1), Speech disorder developmental (n=1) and Tremor (n=1). All events were assessed as not 
related to study treatment  by the treating  physician  due to underling comorbidities or  as unlikely in  a 
context  of  non-chronic  exposition  of  anti-VEGF.  Three  cases  of  non-serious  intracerebral  hemorrhage 
events were reported in the aflibercept arm: intraventricular haemorrhage neonatal at 18 days after first 
dose of  aflibercept  in  a  premature  patient with  low  weight  and  predisposing  risk factors of respiratory 
distress syndrome and infection, intraventricular haemorrhage at 37 days after first dose of aflibercept in 
a premature patient with low weight and predisposing risk factors of BPD, anaemia and apnoea, thalamus 
haemorrhage at 20 days after the first dose of aflibercept in a patient with patent ductus arteriosus and 
disturbance in cerebral blood flow due to underlying respiratory distress syndrome. The events of delayed 
motor  development  and  of  syndrome  movement’s  disturbance  occurred  in  two  patients  with  medical 
history of perinatal brain damage and/or pyramidal tract syndrome and cerebral haemorrhage which are 
plausible alternative explanations. 
 
 
Overall, at this stage, available data is not in favour of a causal relationship between aflibercept IVT and 
nervous and cardiac disorders. Nonetheless, these uncertainties will be further reduced by provision of 
data in the context of the longer term follow-up and in the PSURs. 
Renal disorders were also highlighted by non-clinical data but similar rates were reported between arms 
(2.7% vs 2.6%). One proteinuria event was reported in each arm. In the aflibercept group, the event of 
(transient  and  spontaneously  recovered)  proteinuria  occurred  in  one  patient  presenting  proteinuria  at 
baseline.  The  causal  relationship  to  aflibercept  was  assessed  as  unlikely.  No  further  cases  have  been 
reported until 2 years of chronological age among the 54 patients who completed the visit.  This potential 
issue will also be followed in the further post-approval data submissions. 
Severity  
Most of the systemic TEAE were mild or moderate in intensity, and severe TEAE were in higher proportion 
in laser arm (18, 4%) than in aflibercept (6,7%).  
Relation to study treatment/procedure 
There were no aflibercept-related systemic TEAE in the study while injection-related systemic TEAE (PT, 
pain) was reported for 1 subject (1.3%) in the aflibercept arm. The event was non-serious and mild in 
intensity. The action taken with aflibercept did not change, and the outcome was resolved. 
Laser-related systemic TEAE occurred in 2 (5.3%) subjects in the laser arm, and the reported events 
were anemia neonatal and apnea.  
Study 20275 
All subjects 
For all 89 subjects who entered the extension Study 20275, the proportion of subjects with at least one 
systemic AE was similar between the 2 arms (aflibercept 48 [80.0%] vs laser 24 [82.8%]).  
Table 11: Number of subjects with systemic adverse events until 1 year of chronological age by primary 
system  organ  class,  preferred  term  (Unilaterally  &  bilaterally  treated  subjects  in  20090)  (all  subjects 
entering extension) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most frequent systemic AE by PT, occurring in more than 10% of the subjects in either arm were 
pyrexia (aflibercept 16.7% vs laser 6.9%) and umbilical hernia (aflibercept 1.7% vs laser 10.3%). All 
other systemic AE were reported in less than 10% of subjects in total. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Systemic  AE  are  considered  compatible  with  the  underlying  prematurity  and  reflect  no  clinically 
meaningful differences across both treatment arms.  
Severity 
Most of the systemic TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity, and severe TEAEs were reported in 5 
(6.7%) subjects in the aflibercept arm and 4 (10.5%) in the laser arm. 
For  all  89  subjects  who  entered  the  extension  Study  20275,  most  of  the  systemic  AEs  were  mild  or 
moderate in intensity, and severe AEs were reported by 6 (10.0%) subjects in the aflibercept arm and 
7 (24.1%) in the laser arm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Relation to study treatment/procedure 
For all 89 subjects who entered the extension Study 20275, for 1 (1.7%) subject in the aflibercept arm 
an injection procedure-related systemic AE was reported (pain of mild intensity, as reported in Study 
20090). No systemic AEs with a fatal outcome were reported for either arm.  
Patients who completed the 1 year visit and the 2 year visit 
For the 60 subjects who completed the visit at 1 year of chronological age, the results were similar to 
those described above for all subjects. 
For  all  60  subjects  who  completed  the  visit  at  1  year  of  chronological  age,  among  unilaterally  and 
bilaterally-treated  subjects  at  1  year  of  chronological  age,  there  were  no  aflibercept-related  systemic 
AEs  reported  for  any  population  included  in  these  analyses.  Moreover,  there  were  no  laser-related 
systemic AEs reported for any population included in these analyses.  
Regarding long-term safety of study 20275, the MAH submitted a first interim analysis of the data at 2 
years of chronological age for more than half of the patient  (see Annex 2 and 4) and completed data 
will be submitted in June 2023.  
Deaths/Serious adverse event/other significant events 
1. 
Deaths 
Study 20090 
Three subjects in the aflibercept arm died during Study 20090, at approximately 4 to 9 weeks after the 
last treatment. All 3 deaths were assessed as associated with complications of underlying prematurity, 
and as causally unrelated to the drug. 
The summarized death are as follow:  
1. 
a 71-day-old Asian female with a gestational age at birth of 23 weeks and 6 days, the cause of 
death was reported as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pneumothorax. Her death occurred 144 
days after the start of the study treatment and 59 days after the last study treatment. 
2. 
a 61-day-old white female with a gestational age at birth of 2  weeks and 1 day, the cause of 
death  was  reported  as  bronchiolitis.  Her  death  occurred  57  days  after  the  start  of  the  study 
treatment and 56 days after the last study treatment. 
3. 
a  90-day-old  white  male  with  a  gestational  age  at  birth  of  2  weeks,  the  cause  of  death  was 
reported as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. His death occurred 61 days after the start of the study 
treatment and 28 days after the last study treatment. 
None  of  the  deaths  were  assessed  as  related  to  aflibercept  but  as  complications  of  the  underlying 
prematurity. All deaths occurred at more than a month after last study treatment. 
Study 20275 
No deaths were reported during the ongoing extension Study 20275 (FIREFLEYE NEXT).  
4. 
SAE/TESAE 
In study 20090, overall SAE occurred in 40 (35.4%) subjects overall, and the proportion of subjects with 
SAE was higher in the laser arm compared to the aflibercept arm (aflibercept 24 [32.0%] vs laser 16 
[42.1%]).  Treatment-emergent  SAE  occurred  in  19  (16.8%)  subjects  overall,  and  the  proportion  of 
 
 
 
 
subjects with TESAE was higher in the laser arm compared to the aflibercept arm (aflibercept 9 [12.0%] 
vs laser 10 [26.3%]).  
In study 20275, serious AE were reported for 29 (32.6%) subjects, and the proportion of subjects with 
overall SAE was lower in the aflibercept arm compared to the laser arm (25.0% vs 48.3%).  
OCULAR SAE/TESAE 
Study 20090 
Thirteen  (11.5%)  subjects  had  an  ocular  SAE  in  the  treated  eye,  which  occurred  in  slightly  higher 
proportion  of  subjects  in  the  aflibercept  arm  (aflibercept  10  [13.3%]  vs  laser  3  [7.9%]).  The  events 
recorded for more than 1 subject were retinal detachment (aflibercept 5 [6.7%] vs laser 2 [5.3%]) and 
retinal haemorrhage (2 [2.7%] subjects in the aflibercept arm). 
Nine (8.0%) subjects had an ocular TESAE in the treated eye, which occurred in similar proportion of 
subjects in both treatment arms (aflibercept 6 [8.0%] vs laser 3 [7.9%]).  
The events recorded for more than 1 subject were retinal detachment (aflibercept 3 [4.0%] vs laser 2 
[5.3%]) and retinal haemorrhage (2 [2.7%] subjects in the aflibercept arm). 
Table 12: Number of subjects with ocular treatment-emergent serious adverse events in treated eyes 
by primary system organ class, preferred term (Unilaterally & bilaterally treated subjects) (safety 
analysis set)
There was no laser-related TESAE. One (2.6%) subject in the laser arm had aflibercept-related TESAE, 
and 1 (1.3%) subject in the aflibercept arm had injection-procedure-related TESAE. For one subject in 
the aflibercept arm, transient, spontaneously resolved ocular events of corneal oedema and intraocular 
pressure increased were reported for the inadvertently overdosed (right) eye (with 4.0 mg, while the 
left received the intended dose of 0.4 mg). For a subject in the laser arm, the ocular event of retinal 
detachment in the treated eye was reported. 
Study 20275 
For all  89 subjects who  entered the extension study,  the most frequent ocular SAE by PTs in  treated 
eyes,  occurring  in  more  than  3%  of  the  subjects  in  either  arm,  were  retinal  detachment  (aflibercept 
5.0% vs laser 3.4%), retinal haemorrhage (aflibercept 3.3% vs laser 0%) and conjunctivitis (no subjects 
 
 
 
 
 
in aflibercept vs 3.4% in laser). All other ocular SAEs in treated eyes were reported in less than 2% of 
subjects in total. 
Table 13: Number of subjects with ocular serious adverse events until 1 year of chronological age in 
treated eyes in previous study 20090 by primary system organ class, preferred term (Unilaterally & 
bilaterally treated subjects in 20090) (all subjects entering extension) 
The greatest proportion of subjects had events that were considered moderate in intensity (5 [5.6%)]. 
Three (5.0%) subjects in the aflibercept arm were reported with events of severe intensity; 3 (5.0%) 
subjects were reported with retinal detachment of severe intensity, 1 (1.7%) subject was reported with 
retinal neovascularization of severe intensity, and 1 (1.7%) subject was reported with vitreous opacities 
of severe intensity.  
There were no subjects with ocular SAEs in non-treated eyes. 
SYSTEMIC SAE/TESAE 
Study 20090 
Thirty-two subjects (28.3%) had a systemic SAE, which occurred in higher proportion of subjects in the 
laser arm compared to the aflibercept arm (aflibercept 18 [24.0%] vs laser 14 [36.8%]).  The events 
recorded  for  more  than  1  subject  was  bronchiolitis  (aflibercept  5  [6.7%]  vs  laser  2  [5.3%]), 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia in 3 (4.0%) subjects in the aflibercept arm, infantile apnoea in 2 (5.3%) 
subjects in the laser arm, and upper respiratory tract infection and apnoea (in 1 subject in each treatment 
arm, respectively).  
For TESAE, twelve subjects (10.6%) had a systemic TESAE, which occurred in  a higher proportion of 
subjects in the laser arm compared to the aflibercept arm (aflibercept 5 [6.7%] vs laser 7 [18.4%]). 
The events recorded for more than 1 subject was bronchiolitis (aflibercept 2 [2.7%] vs laser 1 [2.6%]) 
and infantile apnoea (2 [5.3%] subjects in the laser arm). 
Table  14:  Number  of  subjects  with  systemic  treatment-emergent  serious  adverse  events  by  primary 
system organ class, preferred term (Unilaterally & bilaterally treated subjects) (safety analysis set) 
 
 
 
 
Overall, systemic SAE and TESAE occurred in a higher proportion of subjects in the laser arm compared 
to the aflibercept arm (respectively 36.8% vs 24.0% and 18.4% vs 6.7%). The events reported for more 
than  one  subject  are  infantile  apnoea  and  bronchiolitis  and  are  possible  complications  of  premature 
conditions. 
Study 20275 
For all 89 subjects who entered the extension study 20725, systemic SAE were reported in 11 (18.3%) 
subjects in the aflibercept arm and 13 (44.8%) subjects in the laser arm. the majority of subjects had 
events that were considered severe in intensity (10 [11.2%]).  
The most frequently reported PT for systemic SAE was infantile apnoea (no subjects in the aflibercept 
arm vs laser 2 [6.9%]). 
Table 15: Number of subjects with systemic serious adverse events until 1 year of chronological age by 
primary system organ class, preferred term (Unilaterally & bilaterally treated subjects in 20090) (all 
subjects entering extension) 
 
 
 
 
 
Other significant events 
1. 
Overdose 
One subject in the aflibercept arm injected bilaterally on the same day, was overdosed on the right eye 
i.e. overdose on the right eye with 4.0 mg (100 µL), while the left received the intended dose of 0.4 mg 
(10 µL) a few minutes later. The patient presented transient corneal oedema and intraocular pressure 
(corneal odema lasted for 5 minutes and increased intraocular pressure from 6.3mmHg pre-injection to 
35mmHg 15 mn post-injection which returned to 17.4mmHg within 60mn). The events were transient 
and resolved spontaneously.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mandatory use of the PDD with the PFS allows the administration of a single dose of 10 µL/0.4 mg of 
aflibercept (range of 10.9 µL to 12.6 µL) and afterward the dose button will be blocked. Thus the risk of 
overdose would be limited.   
2. 
Multiple use of single use product 
For one patient, the event multiple use of single use product was reported. Extraction of multiple doses 
from a vial or a PFS is of concern considering risk of contamination and infection. Use of the PDD would 
allow to limit this risk since it cannot be reused without a major manipulation. 
The single use of the PFS is well mentioned in section 4.2 and 6.6 of the SmPc and in the Instruction for 
use (IFU) of the PDD. 
COVID-19 related adverse events 
For 2 subjects in  the aflibercept arm,  COVID-19 related AEs were reported.  One of  the  events was  a 
TESAE, and required remedial drug therapy. The action taken with aflibercept did not change, and the 
outcome was resolved. 
Medical device incident 
Overall, no medical device incidents were reported.  
Analysis of adverse events by organ system or syndrome 
There are no AE in the Studies 20090 and 20275, reported to have occurred in the context of any organ 
system or syndrome. No adverse events of special interest were defined in Study 20090 or Study 20275. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study 20090 
Overall, 4 subjects (3.5%) discontinued the study intervention due to AE, three (4.0%) in the aflibercept 
arm and 1 (2.6%) in the laser arm discontinued study intervention because of ocular TEAEs in treated 
eyes. Furthermore, none of the systemic TEAE and AE led to discontinuation of study intervention. 
The 3 subjects in the aflibercept arm discontinued aflibercept and the events were retinal detachment 
for 2 subjects and retinopathy of prematurity for 1. The subject in the laser arm discontinued laser due 
to event retinal detachment.  
Furthermore, SAE leading to discontinuation of study intervention occurred in 2 (2.7%) subjects (ROP 
and retinal detachment, respectively) in the aflibercept arm and 1 (2.6%) subject (retinal detachment) 
in the laser arm. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Laboratory (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) analyses were performed and reviewed at screening 
(Visit 1). No further lab tests were mandated by study protocol other than urine protein test. 
Clinically  significant  findings  during  the  course  of  the  study  was  reported  as  AEs.  Systemic  TEAE 
proteinuria  was  reported  in  1  subject  in  each  of  the  treatment  arms.  Both  events  were  non-serious, 
overall in the aflibercept arm proteinuria occurred 12 days after the start of the study treatment was 
 
 
 
 
transient, asymptomatic and mild in intensity while in the laser arm proteinuria was moderate in intensity 
and occurred 22 days after the start of the study treatment in context of a urinary tract infection.  
Both events were assessed by the investigators as unrelated to aflibercept, laser or injection procedure 
and were resolved in 18 days for the aflibercept arm and 10 days for the laser arm.  
In total, no association of aflibercept treatment and development of proteinuria was identified. 
No clinical laboratory data were collected in Study 20275. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
Clinically significant abnormal findings in physical  examinations and vital signs were reported as AEs. 
The following analyses of these routinely assessed variables provide complementary safety information. 
Vital  signs  (systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure,  heart  rate,  respiratory  rate  and  body  temperature) 
were analysed in the SAF. 
Mean  values  for  the  vital  signs  were  similar  in  the  treatment  arms  at  baseline  and  stayed  almost 
unchanged or considered as not clinically relevant over time. No AE of hypertension was reported. 
Regarding  physical  examinations  (body  length,  head  circumference  and  weight),  the  mean  values  at 
baseline  and  the  increasing  trend  with  increasing  age  were  similar  between  treatment  arms  for  the 
physical examination parameters, with the exception that subjects were slightly heavier in the aflibercept 
arm compared to the laser arm at baseline as well as at week 24. 
Concerning surgical procedures, four (5.3%) subjects in the aflibercept arm and 1 (2.6%) in the laser 
arm underwent ocular surgical procedures after study start. Laser coagulation therapy was performed in 
3 subjects (all in aflibercept arm) and other ocular surgical procedure was performed in 2 subjects, 1 in 
each arm (reported term lensvitrshvartectomy LVSHE which refers to extracapsular lens extraction and 
vitrectomy that were performed simultaneously) for the subject in the aflibercept arm and vitrectomy 
for the subject in the laser arm).  
Furthermore, a total of 23 (20.4%) subjects underwent at least one non-ocular surgical procedure after 
study start, and the proportion was similar between the treatment arms (aflibercept 15 [20.0%] vs laser 
8 [21.1%]). The most common surgical procedure was abdominal surgery, which was performed in 3 
(4.0%) subjects in the aflibercept arm and 2 (5.3%) in the laser arm. The second most common surgical 
procedure was tracheostomy, which was performed in 3 (2.7%) subjects in total (aflibercept 2 [2.7%] 
vs laser 1[2.6%]). All other surgical procedures were performed in 2 or less subjects.  
For the extension study 20275, the mean values at baseline and the increasing trend with increasing 
age were similar between treatment arms for the physical examination parameters. 
Ophthalmologic examinations  
At baseline, the proportion of eyes with abnormal findings in the posterior segment was low but relatively 
higher in the aflibercept arm compared to the laser arm (aflibercept 6.2% vs laser 1.4%). From week 0, 
day 1 onwards, the proportion of eyes with abnormal findings was generally comparable between the 
treatment arms at any assessment time point.  
In  parallel,  the  proportions  of  subjects  with  abnormal  findings  in  the  anterior  segment  and  clinically 
significant abnormal findings were low at any assessment time point, and generally decreased during 
the course of the study from week 1 onwards. Overall, few subjects transitioned from “normal” towards 
 
 
 
 
 
“abnormal” or “clinically significant abnormal” in either treatment arm. There was no subject transitioned 
from “abnormal” towards “clinically significant abnormal” in either arm.  
Concerning  intra-ocular  pressure  (IOP),  any  episode  of  clinically  significant  IOP  were  reported  as  an 
ocular AE. As expected for intravitreal injections, IOP was slightly higher in the aflibercept arm compared 
to  the  laser  arm,  but  the  changes  from  preinjection  to  postinjection  were  comparable  between  the 
treatment arms.  
Presence of anti-drug antibodies before and 12 weeks after aflibercept injection 
Immunogenicity  to  aflibercept  in  Study  20090  was  very  low.  ADA  was  reported  in  1  subject  in  the 
aflibercept  arm  at  week  12.  It  was  a  treatment-emergent  ADA  response,  and  the  ADA  titer  was  low 
(1:30). Neutralizing antibodies were not detected in this subject.  
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsec factors 
Extensive safety analyses were performed for aflibercept use across multiple indications in adult patients 
using  ethnic  factors,  defined  as  relating  to  intrinsic  (genetic  [gender,  race,  genetics]  and  physiologic 
[height,  body  weight,  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  {ADME},  age,  history  of 
diseases]) characteristics of a population which concluded that the data from all pivotal aflibercept trials 
in adult patients provided no evidence of an impact by intrinsic factors. 
As far as the target pediatric population of preterm infants with ROP is concerned, pharmacokinetic data 
in  the Study 20090 did not reveal any  relevant and  consistent  differences among Japanese and non-
Japanese subjects. Subgroups were investigated by body weight and gestational age at baseline, sex, 
and region (Japan vs outside Japan) which did not appear to influence free (pharmacologically active) 
aflibercept concentrations in plasma. 
Overall,  plasma  aflibercept  concentrations  measured  in  75  subjects  in  the  aflibercept  arm  were  not 
correlated with arterial hypertension or any other adverse clinical findings. Among the 75 subjects, 69 
subjects were treated bilaterally on the same day at baseline, 2 subjects had the 2nd eye treated with 
aflibercept after baseline, and 4 subjects were treated unilaterally throughout Study 20090. 
In conclusion, mean free aflibercept concentrations all declined from week 0/day 1 onwards independent 
of the baseline body weight. Mean adjusted bound aflibercept concentrations increased from week 0/day 
1 until week 4 and declined thereafter. Exploratory subpopulation analysis revealed no clinically relevant 
differences in free or adjusted bound aflibercept concentrations in plasma with respect to baseline body 
weight,  gender,  race,  gestational  age,  oxygen  supplementation  at  baseline,  history  of  sepsis,  or 
intraventricular hemorrhage. 
No specific studies in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment have been conducted and is to be 
expected  with  aflibercept  as  the  available  data  does  not  suggest  a  need  for  a  dose  adjustment  with 
aflibercept in these patients. 
Extrinsec factors 
No extrinsic factors were analyzed in Study 20090. 
Use in pregnancy 
 
 
 
 
 
Concerning the use in pregnancy and during lactation, overall there are data on the use of aflibercept in 
pregnant  women  however  reproductive  toxicity  after  systemic  administration  has  been  shown  in 
preclinical studies. In the same way, as it is unknown whether aflibercept is excreted in human milk; a 
risk cannot be excluded.  
As such, preterm infants with previous exposure to any intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, including maternal 
exposure during pregnancy and/or during breastfeeding were excluded from the pivotal Study 20090. 
Withdrawal and rebound 
Tolerance, withdrawal or rebound effects were not evaluated. 73.3% of subjects in the aflibercept 0.4 
mg group in the pivotal study required initial treatment only Administration of IVT aflibercept to subjects 
with  treatment-requiring  ROP  is  a  non-chronic  treatment  option.  Typically,  the  drug  is  administered 
timely after diagnosis, usually bilaterally on the same day in a single treatment session. Usually, in the 
majority of cases, a single injection per eye appears sufficient, and if needed one re-injection after a 
minimum interval of 28 days may be required. The underlying disease of ROP may respond to treatment, 
reoccur or progress despite treatment. 
Abuse and Overdose 
No drug abuse is to be expected with Eylea (Aflibercept), solution for injection.  
As 73.3% of subjects in the aflibercept 0.4 mg group in the pivotal study required initial treatment only, 
tolerance, withdrawal or rebound effects were not evaluated.  
Typically, the drug is administered timely after diagnosis, usually bilaterally on the same day in a single 
treatment session. Usually, in the majority of cases, a single injection per eye appears sufficient, and if 
needed one re-injection after a minimum interval of 28 days may be required.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been analyzed or performed in study 20090.  
Post marketing experience 
As of 31 May 2021, 46 post-marketing cases (194 events) reported the use of aflibercept administered 
off-label in patients with ROP at doses of 0.4 mg to 2 mg corresponding to 31 were spontaneous reports, 
13 derived from observational study reports and 2 from literature.  
Of the 46 cases in total, 35 were non-serious and 11 serious. In the vast majority of cases the event 
outcome was not reported; there were 6 cases with a fatal outcome considered causally unrelated to 
aflibercept treatment by the reporter but related to complications of preterm birth. 
Based on the review of these cases from cumulative post-marketing reporting, no new safety concern 
was identified. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In post marketing, 46 cases off-label use were reported in premature infants for ROP. Few information 
was available including outcomes but conditions of administration such as dose, number of injections, 
and schedule of administration could be different from the one assessed in study 20090.  
Among events reported, one AE of endophtalmitis was reported. Considering that premature infants are 
more prone to infections, this important identified risk for aflibercept is of concern. No case was reported 
in  study  20090 and  conditions of  off-label  use could be different from  the authorized ones.  Warnings 
have been implemented in the product information for the premature indication  and this topic will be 
closely monitored in post-marketing surveillance in this population through PSUR. 
 
 
 
 
4.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety analysis is based on one phase III study of 6 months (FIREFLEYE, study 20090) which 
assessed administration of one or two intravitreal injections of aflibercept 0.4mg in premature infants 
diagnosed with ROP in comparison to laser photocoagulation. An extension study of a duration of 5 years 
(FIREFLEYE NEXT, study 20275) is also ongoing and evaluates long-term safety data of patients who 
completed the study 20090 including neurodevelopment assessment at 2 years, physical examination 
and ophthalmologic assessment. Submission of 5-year data is planned in Q1 2026 and interim analysis 
were submitted up to 2 years of chronological age as requested.  
Patient exposure 
Study 20090 enrolled 113 patients including 75 treated with aflibercept and 38 treated with laser. The 
extension  study  20275  included  89  patients  for  a  5-year  period  with  submitted  data  at  a  mean 
chronological age of 8.8 months and data at 1 year of chronological age for only 60 patients (39 in the 
aflibercept arm and in 21 in the laser arm).  
Considering  the  vulnerable  population  of  preterm  infants  for  which  long-term  safety  is  crucial,  non-
clinical  data  which  reported  bone  and  renal  risks,  and  neurodevelopment  impairment  reported  with 
bevacizumab -another anti-VEGF- in ROP indication, submitted 1-year data for slightly more than half of 
patients were not considered sufficient. As requested in the first request of supplementary information, 
the MAH submitted the data available at 2 years of chronological age for more than half of the patients 
and the complete interim analysis will be submitted in June 2023. Furthermore, further discussion and 
available data on growth parameters and neurodevelopment test were submitted. In terms of exposure 
to be reported in future submissions to further reduce the uncertainties, a submission of only final results 
of the 5-year extension study in Q1 2026 was considered as not sufficient and interim analysis at 3 and 
4 years are awaited in 2024 and 2025 as requested. 
The majority of patients (>83%) completed the study 20090 at week 24 (90,7% in the aflibercept arm 
and 83,7% in the laser arm). 
On the 75 patients in the aflibercept arm (146 eyes), 94,7% were bilaterally treated and a total of 120 
eyes (82.2%)  received a single IVT administration of 0,4 mg of aflibercept with a mean volume of 10,5 
µL while 26 eyes (17.8%) received 2 injections.  Rescue treatment was allowed with a higher proportion 
in the laser arm retreated by aflibercept (4 patients among 38) than in the aflibercept arm retreated by 
laser (5 patients among 75).  
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics were consistent across treatment groups except for 
birth weight and reflect the ROP population with a majority of patients born at gestational age below 32 
weeks and with very low birth weight, i.e. ≤1500g.  
Adverse event (AE) 
Ocular AE 
In  study  20090,  incidences  of  ocular  TEAE  were  well  balanced  between  aflibercept  and  laser  groups 
(38.7%  vs  36.8%).  The  most  reported  ocular  TEAE  in  treated  eyes  consisted  of  retinal  haemorrhage 
(6,7%  in  aflibercept  arm  vs  13,2  %  in  the  laser  arm),  retinal  detachment  (5,3%  in  both  arms), 
conjunctival haemorrhage (5,3 % vs 0%), conjonctivitis (4,0% vs 10,5%) and eyelid oedema (2,7 % vs 
7,9%). Severity was mainly mild to moderate. Despite low number of patients and AE reported which 
made challenging the comparison between arms, several PT were reported with a slightly higher rate in 
 
 
 
 
aflibercept group such as conjunctival haemorrhage (5,3% vs 0%), conjunctival oedema (2,7% vs 0%), 
injection  site  haemorrhage  and  intraocular  pressure  increased  (4,0%  vs  0%  both).  Most  of  them  are 
known complications of IVT administration which are listed in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Ocular SAE were reported in slightly higher proportions in the aflibercept arm in study 20090 (13.3% vs 
7.9%) while the proportion of subjects with ocular TESAE was similar in both arms (8.0% vs 7.9%). The 
most reported TEAE were retinal detachment and retinal haemorrhage. 
Otherwise, one case of retinal artery occlusion in both eyes reported in the aflibercept arm and assessed 
as related to aflibercept is of concern considering this sight-threatening AE and a close monitoring of this 
topic in PSUR in adult population and its causality to aflibercept is still unknown. The event occurred in 
the  two  eyes  for  one  subject,  was  non-serious  and  severity  was  mild.  Based  on  this  single  case,  no 
sufficient  information  are  available  to  associate  this  case  with  a  thromboembolic  or  a  local 
vasoconstriction cause nor of IOP increase related to anti-VEGF treatment with aflibercept. Overall, in 
case of a positive issue of the MAH, this topic will be further monitored in post-marketing surveillance 
through the PSUR and in the follow-up study 20275 up to 5 years of chronological age.  
Regarding  ocular  infections,  a  topic  of  concern  considering  that  premature  infants  are  more  prone  to 
develop such events, a total of 7 subjects presented conjonctivitis with a higher proportion in the laser 
arm (10.5% vs 4,0%). No case of endophtalmitis, a known risk of anti-VEGF drugs by IVT route, was 
reported.  Additional warnings have been proposed for endophtalmitis by the Applicant in sections 4.2 
and 4.4 of the SmPC for ROP patients which are endorsed. 
In addition, one case of overdose was reported with a dose 10 times higher than the recommended one. 
The  medication  error  resulted  in  IOP  increased  and  corneal  oedema  which  were  transient  and  of 
favourable outcome without any corrective treatment. More information about this case were requested 
during the procedure. Mandatory use of the PDD with the PFS allows the administration of a single dose 
of  10  µL/0.4  mg  of  aflibercept  (range  of  10.9  µL  to  12.6  µL)  and  afterward  the  dose  button  will  be 
blocked. Thus the risk of overdose would be limited.   
Furthermore, one case of multiple-use of a single use product was also reported and more information 
about this case was requested. Extraction of multiple doses from a vial or a PFS is of concern considering 
risk of contamination and infection. Use of the PDD would allow to limit this risk since it cannot be reused 
without a major manipulation. The single use of the PFS is well mentioned in section 4.2 and 6.6 of the 
SmPc and in the Instruction for use (IFU) of the PDD.  
Similar  tendency  was  retrieved  in  study  20275  at  8.8  months  and  at  1  year  for  the  60  patients  with 
similar proportions of subject presenting ocular TEAE (56.7% vs 55.2%; 56.4% vs 57.1%). Among the 
most  reported  events,  myopia,  astigmatism,  retinal  haemorrhage,  conjunctivitis  and  strabismus  were 
retrieved which are events compatible to possible consequences of the ROP evolution. Other known AE 
of  aflibercept  in  adult  population  were  also  observed  such  as  conjunctival  haemorrhage  (3  patients), 
vitreous  haemorrhage  (2  patients),  corneal  oedema  (1  patient),  intraocular  pressure  increased  (3 
patients)  and  retinal  detachment  (3  patients).  For  the  last  event,  ROP  evolution  limits  causal 
interpretability. 
Further  long  term  safety  results  (up  to  2  years  of  chronological  age)  are  discussed  in  above  and 
completed  data  up  to  2  years  of  age  will  be  submitted  in  June  2023.  Overall,  an  analysis  of  adverse 
events until 1 year of chronological age (in Studies 20090 and 20275) from 89 subjects who entered the 
extension Study 20275 demonstrated a similar proportion of ocular AEs between both groups (aflibercept 
56.7% vs laser 55.2%) and showed lower rate of strabismus (96% aflibercept vs 84.6% laser), higher 
proportion  of  myopia  was  reported  in  the  aflibercept  arm  (19.7%,  vs  17.6%),  but  less  pronounced 
myopia (2 out 13 for aflibercept and 2 out of 6 for laser), absence of cataract and age appropriate visual 
function. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Systemic AE 
In study 20090, higher incidences of systemic TEAE were reported in the laser arm (63,2% vs 52,0%). 
The most reported SOC were Infections and infestations (17.7%), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (16.8%) and Gastrointestinal disorders (15.0%) with higher rates reported in the laser arm 
(respectively 28.9% vs 12.0%; 21.1% vs 14.7% and 21.1% vs 12.0%). The most reported events such 
as  apnoea,  umbilical  hernia,  haemorrhage  subcutaneous,  anaemia,  and  infantile  apnoea  are  possible 
complications of premature infants.  
Systemic SAE and TESAE occurred in a higher proportion of subjects in the laser arm compared to the 
aflibercept arm in study 20090 (respectively 36.8% vs 24.0% and 18.4% vs 6.7%). The events reported 
for more than one subject are infantile apnoea and bronchiolitis. 
However,  two  SOC  were  of  concern  considering  higher  rates  reported  in  aflibercept  arm  and  known 
mechanism  of  action  of  anti-VEGF  such  as  Cardiac  disorders  (5.3%  vs  2.6%)  and  Nervous  system 
disorders  (9.3%  vs  2.6%).  Similar  tendency  was  reported  in  study  20275  at  8.8  months  arm 
(respectively 6.7% vs  3.4% and 15.0% vs  6.9%).  Considering  uncertainties  on  systemic  exposure in 
this vulnerable population including higher exposure reported from PK data compared to adult patients, 
and known effects of VEGF on cardiovascular systems, a discussion on these imbalances was requested 
(see above). In addition, in study 20090 one event of developmental coordination disorders reported in 
aflibercept group is of concern considering existing data on bevacizumab in ROP as highlighted in the 
PIP.  In  study  20275,  one  event  of  movement  disorders  and  one  of  motor  development  delay  were 
reported in aflibercept arm. In the extension study 20275, incidences of systemic adverse events until 
2 years of chronological age were similar between aflibercept and laser group (respectively 57,6% vs 
55,0%). Overall, at this stage, available data is not in favour of a causal relationship between aflibercept 
IVT  and  nervous  and  cardiac  disorders.  Nonetheless,  these  uncertainties  will  be  further  reduced  by 
provision of data in the context of the longer term follow-up and in the PSURs. 
During the procedure, the MAH was requested to provide data on neurodevelopmental testing which was 
available for nearly half of the patient who had completed their 2 years of chronological age visit and 
considering a potential  risk  on the neurodevelopment  of  premature infants.  Overall,  at this  stage the 
submitted  data  remains  limited  but  the  results  for  more  than  half  of  the  patients  up  to  2  years  on 
neurodevelopmental test as well as the previously submitted data on the SOC Nervous system disorders 
are reassuring and does not seems in favour of a risk of neurodevelopemental impairment in premature 
patients with ROP treated by aflibercept IVT. 
Furthermore, the available data on the growth parameters on the 54 patients who had completed their 
2 years of chronological age were requested considering the plausible risk and the limited data available 
on the topic. Overall, the change from baseline at visit for the weight, height and head circumference 
does not seems to differ between the aflibercept group and the laser group. 
Overall, these topics will be closely monitored in post-marketing through PSUR and in the follow up study 
20275 up to 5 years of chronological age. Interim analysis at 3 and 4 year of age are awaited in 2024 
and 2025. 
Renal disorders were also highlighted by non-clinical data but similar rates were reported between arms 
(2.7% vs 2.6%) in study 20090. One proteinuria event was reported in each arm. In study 20275, higher 
rates were reported in laser arm (6.9% vs 3.3%). Considering non-clinical data, known proteinuria AE 
of anti-VEGF by IV route and uncertainties on systemic exposure in this vulnerable population including 
higher exposure reported from PK data compared to adult patients, a discussion on renal monitoring in 
the extension study 20275 until 5 years of chronological age was requested. Overall, in regards of the 
mechanism of action of anti-VEGF, systemic AE including renal disorders need to be closely monitored 
 
 
in  the  follow  up  study  20275  up  to  5  years  of  chronological  age  and  in  post-marketing  surveillance 
through PSUR. 
Overall, three deaths were reported in study 20090 (bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pneumothorax; 
bronchiolitis; and bronchopulmonary dysplasia) at approximately 4 to 9 weeks after the last treatment 
and which were assessed as related to complications of underlying prematurity. No deaths were reported 
during the ongoing extension Study 20275. 
No  significant  findings  emerged  from  laboratory  evaluations  and  ophthalmologic  assessment  in  study 
20090. In the extension study, no safety findings emerged from vital signs and physical examination at 
8.8 months and at 1 year of chronological age for the 60 patients. 
4.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile for aflibercept in ROP patients appears similar to the one already described in 
adult population. In the initial submission data at 1 year of chronological age were provided for slightly 
more than half of patients and major concerns remained on the long-term safety profile considering the 
vulnerable population and the mechanism of action of aflibercept. These concerns were answered with 
a thorought discussion on long-term safety which was provided by the MAH with the submission of an 
interim  analysis  at  2  years  for  more  than  half  of  the  patients.  The  full  interim  analysis  at  2  years  is 
expected for June 2023 and the Applicant will also submit annual interims analysis (in 2024 and 2025) 
up to 5 years of chronological age to monitor premature patient’s safety althrough the follow-up study 
20275. Furthermore, the safety profile of alfibercept in the ROP population will be further monitored in 
pot-marketing-surveillance through PSUR.  
4.6.3. PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

Long-term safety of aflibercept in preterm 
infants with ROP 
Long-term safety of aflibercept in preterm infants with ROP is considered as a missing information. The 
current knowledge about potential long-term effects of aflibercept IVT treatment in preterm infants with 
ROP is lacking and current safety profile is based on the 6-months pivotal study FIREFLEYE. Considering 
renal and growth disorders highlighted from non-clinical data, neurodevelopment impairment retrieved 
from  clinical  data  with  other  anti-VEGF  drugs  and  uncertainties  on  systemic  aflibercept  exposure 
including  higher  exposure  retrieved  compared  to  adult  population  in  the  vulnerable  population  of 
premature infants, monitoring of long-term safety is deemed necessary. An extension study FIREFLEYE 
NEXT (20275) has been set-up to evaluate the long-term outcomes up to 5 years of chronological age 
of  patients  who  received  treatment  for  ROP  in  study  FIREFLEYE  (20090).  This  study  is  ongoing  and 
follows up on ocular, neurodevelopmental and overall clinical outcomes until 5 years of age when detailed 
assessment of visual function and overall development becomes more feasible.

Safety concerns 
addressed 
•  The purpose of 
the current study 
is to collect the 
missing data of 
the potential long-
term effects after 
treatment with 
aflibercept and 
laser. Subjects 
will be followed up 
to 5 years of 
chronological age, 
which will enable 
a detailed 
assessment of 
visual function 
and overall 
development. 
Category 1 are imposed activities considered key to the benefit risk of the product. 
Category 2 are specific obligations. 
Category 3 are required additional PhV activity (to address specific safety concerns or to measure effectiveness of 
risk minimization measures). 
The MAH proposed to monitor safety data in ROP patients through the extension study 20275 until the 
5  years  of  patients  initially  included  in  study  20090.  A  category  3  is  proposed  and  final  results  are 
expected in Q1 2026. 
Taking into account uncertainties on premature infants development after administration of anti-VEGF 
drug products, the Applicat was asked – and committed to - submit Interim analyses of study 20275 at 
3 and 4 years of chronological age in 2024 and 2025. 
• 
Part V: Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures 
Table  V.1  has  been  updated  with  addition  of  routine  risk  communication  from  the  updated  product 
information, i.e. additional warnings and statements proposed for paediatric population in sections 4.2, 
4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and the corresponding sections of the PIL. For the treatment of babies born 
prematurely with ROP, a separate package leaflet instruction is provided (Information for guardians of 
babies born prematurely). 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
One set of educational material for Eylea will be used for both adult and pediatric populations. The key 
elements have been updated to reflect the need to use the paediatric dosing device and prime it 
properly in ROP. 
• 
Part VI: Summary of the RMP 
Updated in line with the changes above. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
 The changes to the RMP (vesion 32.3) are acceptable.  
6.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this group of variations, sections 2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of the 
SmPC are being updated. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
6.1.1.  User consultation 
This readability test result illustrates a positive assessment of the Eylea package leaflet. The package 
leaflet is laid out clearly, comprehensibly and fulfils the readability guideline recommendations relating 
to layout and design. 
It  must  be  stated  that  the  participants  in  the  final  package  leaflet  survey  located  all  information  as 
requested with ease, thus comprehending and acting appropriately. Difficulties experienced in locating 
and comprehending information contained in the first tested package leaflet were reduced during the 
readability test; however, some additional optimisations are recommended.  
Nevertheless, a positive acceptance was observed amongst the participants. 
In conclusion, the Eylea package leaflet fulfils the requirements of articles 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 
2001/83/EC as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. 
7.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
7.1.  Therapeutic Context 
7.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disorder of the blood vessels of the retina that affects extremely 
premature infants. ROP is a biphasic disease:  phase 1 (~22 to 30 weeks postmenstrual age) is presented 
with hyperoxia and decreased VEGF levels that lead to interruption of normal vascularization and later 
ischemia of the retina and a phase 2 (~31 to 44 weeks postmenstrual age) with hypoxia and increased 
VEGF  levels  resulting  in  proliferation  of  new  blood  vessels.  In  preterm  infants  with  disrupted 
angiogenesis,  the  abnormal  neovascularisation  and  the  leaky  new  blood  vessels  formed  in  this 
environment result in intraocular fibrosis, leading to retinal distortion, detachment, and at the end visual 
disability. In this context, the treatment by suppressing VEGF has a clear rationale. 
According  to  the  International  Classification  of  Retinopathy  of  Prematurity  (IC-ROP  2005),  the  main 
features for the classification of ROP are: the location of retinal involvement (Zone I, II or III), the extent 
of circumferential disease, the stage of severity (stage 1 to 5) and the vascular dilatation and tortuosity 
(plus disease. Additionally, a subtype called aggressive posterior ROP (AP-ROP) is an uncommon severe 
form  of  ROP,  characterized  by  posterior  location,  prominence  of  plus  disease,  with  extremely  intense 
vascular. 
The benefit-risk evaluation is conducted for patients with zone I (stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+), zone II (stage 
2+ or 3+) or AP-ROP (aggressive posterior ROP) disease.  
 
 
 
 
 
Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current treatment strategy for ROP involves laser photocoagulation, anti-VEGF therapy (Lucentis) 
and surgery (vitrectomy or scleral buckle surgery for stage 4 or 5 ROP). 
The  treatment  of  ROP  is  initiated  as  soon  as  diagnosed.  The  laser  photocoagulation  consists  in  the 
ablation  of  the  peripheral  retina  and  result  in  a  significant  improvement  in  long-term  visual  function. 
However,  laser  treatment  requires  sedation  or  general  anesthesia.  It  is  also  associated  with  loss  of 
peripheral visual field, intraocular bleeding, myopia, macular dragging, cataract formation, and/or retinal 
detachment.  
Since 2019, Lucentis (ranibizumab) is approved for the treatment of ROP with Zone I (stage 1+, 2+, 3 
or 3+), Zone II (stage 3+) or AP-ROP (aggressive posterior ROP). The anti-VEGF therapy consist in one 
IVT  injections  and  up  to  three  per  eye  within  six  months  of  treatment  initiation  if  there  are  signs  of 
disease activity under local anesthesia. It is also associated with ocular (increase in IOP, vitritis, vitreous 
detachment, retinal haemorrhage,...) and systemic complications. 
7.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy of aflibercept in the treatment of infants born prematurely with retinopathy of prematurity 
was evaluated in one pivotal trial, its extension study, and a synthesis of available other studies used to 
contextualise results from the pivotal study.  
-  Study  20090  (FIREFLEYE,  Core  study)  Open-label,  Randomized,  Two-Arm,  Controlled 
Study  to  Assess  the  Efficacy,  Safety,  and  Tolerability  of  Intravitreal  (IVT)  Aflibercept  0.4  mg 
Compared to Laser Photocoagulation in Patients With Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP). 
- Study 20275 (FIREFLEYE extension) is a currently ongoing Extension Study evaluating the 
Long-term  Outcomes  of  Subjects  Who  Received  Treatment  for  Retinopathy  of  Prematurity  in 
Study 20090. The Last subject last visit for the Extension Study is planned for Jul 2025. Interim 
analysis  were  conducted  to  provide  long  term  1  year  and  2  years  of  chronological  age  in  the 
subset of patients for which these data were available. 
-  Historical/published  evidence  synthesis  study:  In  the  completed  evidence  synthesis 
study,  no  new  data  was  collected,  however,  clinical  data  collected  in  Study  20090  was 
complemented  by  historical  evidence  for  laser  efficacy  from  the  published  randomized  clinical 
trials BEAT-ROP and RAINBOW (Mintz-Hittner et al. 2011, Stahl et al. 2019), using a Bayesian 
statistical model.  
The development was in accordance with the European Medicines Agency Paediatric Investigation Plan 
for aflibercept. 
7.1.3.  Favourable effects 
In the pivotal study, treatment success (primary efficacy variable) was defined as the absence of active 
ROP and absence of unfavourable structural outcomes (retinal detachment, macular dragging, macular 
fold,  or  retrolental  opacity)  at  24  weeks  after  start  of  study  treatment.  At  the  primary  endpoint  (24 
weeks),  treatment  success  was  numerically  slightly  higher  with  aflibercept  IVT  injection  (85.5%) 
compared  to  laser  photocoagulation  (82.1%)  with  absence  of  active  ROP  and  unfavorable  structural 
outcomes.  
Regarding the secondary endpoints results,  the requirement for intervention with a second treatment 
modality  from  baseline  to  week  24  where  the  estimated  median  probability  for  subjects  requiring  an 
intervention with a second treatment modality from baseline until week 24 was numerically in favour of 
 
 
 
 
 
the  aflibercept  arm:  7.2%  (90%  Credible  Interval:  3.6,  12.7)  in  the  aflibercept  arm  and  9.6%  (90% 
Credible Interval: 4.2, 18.4) in the laser arm.  
At 2 years of chronological age, efficacy data are available for 54 patients (36 in the aflibercept group 
and 18 in the laser group). Regarding the primary efficacy variable, the number of patients with active 
ROP numerically decrease from 9 eyes (6,2%) at 24 weeks to 7 eyes (4,8%) at 1 year and 0 at 2 years 
in the aflibercept group compared to 2 eyes (3,1%) at 24 weeks and 1 eye (2,9%) at 2 years in laser 
group. Severity of the disease decrease in both group and appear to stabilize at 2 years. Regarding the 
second  primary  outcome,  namely  the  presence  of  unfavourable  structural  outcomes:  the  number  of 
patients without any decreased from 4 eyes (3,1%) at 1 year to 0 eye at 2 years in the aflibercept group 
compared to 1 eye (1,6%) at 1 year and 1 eye (3%) at 2 years in the laser group.  
A positive effect was also noted at all timepoints on a functional endpoint such as the ability to fix and 
follow a 5 cm toy. This ability continuedly improved over time through 2 years of chronological age in 
the aflibercept group, from 117 (94.4%) eyes at week 24 of Study 20090, to 124 (96.9%) eyes at 1 
year and 68 (100%) eyes at 2 years of chronological age. The respective rates of eyes in the laser group 
were 88.9% at week 24, 98.4% at 1 year and 94.3% at 2 years of chronological age. 
7.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The pivotal study FIREFLEYE (20090) did not demonstrate statistical relevance of the success criterion 
(non-inferiority  of  IVT  aflibercept  therapy  to  conventional  laser  therapy),  although  treatment  success 
was numerically slightly higher with IVT aflibercept (85.5%) compared to laser (82.1%) at Week 24 and 
despite the study type I error being more relaxed than typically expected for a confirmatory study (lower 
limit of the one-sided 95% credible interval for the treatment difference (aflibercept – laser) was greater 
than -5%). However, the development plan was such that an uncertainty in the primary analysis could 
be anticipated, and the evaluation of all the available evidence (including with the context provided by 
the data synthesis exercise) allows to conclude that there is clinically meaningful efficacy for aflibercept 
in the target population. 
Additionally,  there  is  potential  uncertainty  about  long-term  efficacy  beyond  2  years.  This  will  be 
addressed by the submission of longer-term data. 
7.3.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of aflibercept 0,4 mg in premature infants diagnosed with ROP appears overall similar 
to the one described in adult population.  
In study 20090, among the 75 patients treated with aflibercept, the proportions of subjects with ocular 
events were well balanced. The most reported ocular AE for aflibercept were retinal haemorrhage, retinal 
detachment,  conjunctival  haemorrhage  and  conjunctivitis  which  were  mostly  mild  to  moderate  in 
intensity. Despite challenging comparison of arms due to low number of patients included, some AE were 
more  reported  in  aflibercept  group  and  could  be  related  to  IVT  administration  such  as  conjunctival 
haemorrhage, injection site haemorrhage and intraocular pressure increased.   
7.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Considering the duration of the observations available at time of approval, long-term safety is considered 
sufficiently but not fully characterised in this vulnerable population. 
Considering  uncertainties  on  systemic  exposure  and  the  mechanism  of  action  of  aflibercept,  the 
imbalances reported in the SOC Cardiac disorders and Nervous system disorders between arms in study 
 
 
 
 
20090 and also at 8.8 months in study 20275 were of concern. The updated data at 1 year for all treated 
patients  are  at  reassuring  since  no  disparity  was  seen  for  the  SOC  “Nervous  disorders”  and  “Cardiac 
disorders”.  
The above uncertainties are overall acceptable at this stage and will be further reduced with provision of 
further follow-up data as per RMP and in post-marketing surveillance through PSUR.

7.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
7.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  patients  with  absence  of  active  ROP  (i.e.  ROP  requiring 
treatment) and unfavorable structural outcomes (retinal detachment, macular fold, macular dragging, 
retrolental opacity) at 24 weeks after start of study treatment, based on the investigator’s assessment 
for both eyes.  
The clinical relevance of the efficacy demonstrated is supported by the endpoint measuring the ability to 
fix and follow a 5 cm toy, an age-appropriate technique to evaluate visual function, established in medical 
practice, and considered of high clinical relevance. 
The ocular safety profile of aflibercept in this population comprised mainly injection procedure-related 
AEs, known from the use of aflibercept in adult patients and considered manageable. 
7.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  totality  of  evidence  supports  that  a  clinically  relevant  level  of  efficacy  for  aflibercept  has  been 
demonstrated  in  the  target  population.  The  safety  profile  appears  manageable.  The  uncertainties  are 
acceptable at time of opinion, and will be further reduced by post-approval provision of data. 
The benefit/risk balance is positive. 
7.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of EYLEA is positive.

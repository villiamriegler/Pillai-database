2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan is an immediate release film-coated tablet. The different tablet strengths are 
appropriately differentiated by their colour and/or shape as follows: 
5mg/80mg film-coated tablets are light yellow, round, biconvex, debossed with “AV1” on one side and “M” on 
the other side; 
5mg/160mg film-coated tablets are yellow, oval, biconvex, debossed with “AV2” on one side and “M” on the 
other side; 
10mg/160mg film-coated tablets are light brown, oval, biconvex, debossed with “AV3” on one side and “M” 
on the other side.  
The purpose of the pharmaceutical development studies was to develop a generic product bioequivalent to 
the reference product Exforge 5 mg /80 mg, 5 mg /160 mg and 10 mg /160 mg film-coated tablets.  
The objectives of development were set so that the developed product is suitable for production for 
commercial scale batches and exhibit consistent quality. The product should also demonstrate acceptable 
stability performance in the proposed marketing packs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182030/2016 
Page 10/31 
 
  
  
The choice of the excipients has been satisfactorily justified and their levels have been chosen based on 
formulation optimisation studies. The compatibility of the active substance with the excipients has been 
adequately demonstrated. 
The effect of the particle size of both active substances (AS) on tablet characteristics has been evaluated in 
trial batches with AS of different particle sizes. It was concluded that, within the studied ranges, the particle 
size of the active substances does not adversely impact dissolution. The proposed quality control (QC) 
dissolution method has been satisfactorily developed and justified. It has been shown to be discriminatory 
with regard to relevant changes in the composition of the tablets, and relevant process parameters.  
The anhydrous form of amlodipine besilate is consistently manufactured by the proposed supplier and this 
has been confirmed by evaluating three production scale batches. The stability of the polymorphic form has 
been evaluated by analysing 60 months long term stability data. Valsartan is produced in its amorphous form 
consistently. Evidence to this effect has been provided as well as that the amorphous state does not change 
after 60 months under long term stability conditions. 
Two bioequivalence studies have been conducted comparing Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 10 mg/160 mg 
(test) and Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 5 mg/160 mg (test) with the respective strengths of Exforge 
(reference). Comparative dissolution studies between the test and reference biobatches in the following three 
media were studied: 0.1N hydrochloric acid, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer; the latter is 
also the QC media. In pH 4.5 and 6.8 media the dissolution profiles of both substances were shown to be 
similar between the test and the reference product. In 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, the dissolution of the test 
product was shown to be faster but the difference was justified, as required by the bioequivalence guideline 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr**) in case of difference between the in vitro and in vivo findings. The 
justification was based on the difference between test and reference products with regards to the total tablet 
weight, the in vivo results where both the test and the reference products were found to be bioequivalent and 
the linear pharmacokinetic properties of the ASs. Hence the observed in vitro difference at this pH is not 
expected to have any clinical significance and the justification was accepted.  
A strength biowaiver has been requested for Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 5 mg/80 mg. All the conditions 
specified in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence are met. In relation to the strength 
biowaiver, comparative dissolution studies has been provided for Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 5 mg/80 mg 
strength and the 5mg /160 mg test bio batch in 0.1N hydrochloric acid, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and pH 6.8 
phosphate buffer. The study demonstrated similarity of the dissolution profiles and thus from this point of 
view the biowaiver has been accepted.  
A comparative impurity profile study between Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan and the reference product 
exhibited similar impurity profiles. 
Considering the physicochemical characteristics of both ASs and the characteristics of the pharmaceutical 
form, a dry granulation technique was selected as the manufacturing process. The process parameters for 
the compaction, milling, blending and tabletting have been optimised through a series of studies. 
The finished product will be packaged in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle pack with white opaque 
polypropylene cap with aluminium induction sealing liner wad. Alternatively it may be packed in PVC/PCTFE 
blister pack. Bulk product is packaged for shipment in a low density polyethylene (LDPE) bag which is placed 
in an outer triple laminated bag along with desiccant bags (silica gel) in between the bags and sealed. The 
triple laminated bags are then placed in a suitable tertiary pack. All the proposed packaging materials comply 
with the relevant EU and Ph.Eur. requirements.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  main  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  are:  sifting,  pre-mixing,  compaction,  milling  and  sifting, 
blending, tabletting, coating and packaging. The critical steps of the process have been defined as blending, 
tabletting, coating and packaging. All provided in-process controls established for the manufacturing process 
are  acceptable  and  justified  and  are  considered  suitable  to  guarantee  the  intended  quality  of  the  finished 
product.  The  holding  time  and  storage  conditions  of  the  different  intermediates  between  the  process  steps 
have been also specified. 
This is a standard process. Validation of the manufacturing process was carried out for three commercial 
scale batches for all three strengths. In addition a satisfactory process validation protocol has been provided 
for larger batch sizes.  It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.   
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for this kind of 
dosage form including description,  identification (TLC, HPLC), dissolution (HPLC, Ph. Eur.), uniformity of 
dosage units (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), water  (Karl-Fischer), colour identification 
for titanium dioxide and iron oxide (chemical reaction) and microbial test (Ph. Eur.).  
The specifications were set in line with the requirements of the Ph. Eur. general monographs, the ICH 
guidelines and available batch data. Identified impurities A, E and F from amlodipine besilate and impurities A 
and C for valstartan, as per the respective Ph. Eur. monographs, are not tested in the finished product 
because they are process related impurities i.e. not degradation products and because they are controlled in 
each active substance. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
of active substances and impurities has been presented. 
Batch analyses results for 9 batches of Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan film-coated tablets (three of each 
strength) were provided. All batches have been analysed according to the methods valid at the time of 
release. All batches were found to be acceptable as per the specification valid at the time of release. Results 
were in line with proposed specifications and confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

Stability data on three commercial scale batches per strength stored under long term conditions (25 ± 2 ºC 
/60 ± 5% RH) for up to 24 months and under accelerated conditions (40 ± 2 ºC /75 ± 5%RH) for 6 months 
were provided. The stability studies were carried out in accordance with the ICH guidelines on stability. All 
the batches were packed in the container closure systems proposed for marketing.  
The bulk shipment pack was also assessed for stability. A simulated bulk shipment pack (SBP) has been 
studied at accelerated and long-term stability conditions for 24 weeks and 12 months, respectively. The 
packaging of the SBP is essentially similar to proposed bulk shipment pack differing only in dimensions.  
Samples have been tested for description, assay, dissolution, water content, related substances and microbial 
test. The methods used were shown to be stability indicating and were the same as for release. No significant 
changes were observed in any of the tested packaging and the results were found to be well within the 
specification.

A photo stability study has been performed on a commercial batch of each strength of Amlodipine/ Valsartan 
Mylan tablets as per ICH Q1B Guideline. The results indicate that there are no significant changes for 
description, assay, related substances and dissolution of amlodipine besilate or valsartan when exposed to 
light. Therefore, it was concluded that Amlodipine/ Valsartan Mylan film-coated tablets are photo stable. 
A forced degradation study (under aqueous medium, acidic medium, basic medium, oxidative medium, 
light/UV stress heat and humidity) has shown varying degree of degradation which was more prominent in 
samples exposed to heat.  
An in-use stability study has been conducted on a commercial batch of each strength of Amlodipine/ 
Valsartan Mylan tablets in compliance with the “Note for Guidance on in-use stability testing of human 
medicinal products” (CPMP/QWP/2934/99). Based on the results of this study, an in-use shelf life of 100 days 
for the product packed in HDPE bottle pack is accepted as stated in section 6.3 of the SmPC. 
Based on the overall results, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years without any special storage conditions, as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
None of the materials used in the manufacture of Amlodipine/ Valsartan Mylan film-coated tablets are of 
human or animal origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview (Module 2.4) on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been 
provided. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. The impurity profile and excipients content have been discussed and were considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/182030/2016 
Page 13/31 
 
 
  
  
acceptable from toxicological point of view. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered 
acceptable.  
The CHMP considers that the non-clinical overview is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. 
It is agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.   
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. 
The present application is made under article Article 10(1) generic application, i.e. Amlodipine and Valsartan 
Mylan 5 mg/80 mg, 5 mg/160 mg and 10 mg/160 mg, film-coated tablets is a generic version of the already 
approved reference product Exforge 5 mg/80 mg, 5 mg/160 mg and 10 mg/160 mg film-coated tablets by 
Novartis Europharm Limited, which has been marketed in the UE for more than 6 years. As a generic product, 
it is anticipated that sales of this product will replace those of similar marketed products and no increase in 
environmental exposure to Amlodipine Besilate and Valsartan is likely on licensing of Amlodipine/Valsartan 
Mylan, film-coated tablets. 
The applicant stated that the approval of the drug product will not lead to an increase of the total quantity of 
drug active substances into the environment. This is considered to be an acceptable justification for the 
absence of an environmental risk assessment in line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The range of non-clinical data presented in the dossier is typical for generic application and include no new 
studies. Taking into account regulatory requirements for this category of application, there are no objections 
to approval of Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan from a non-clinical point of view. 
The lack of an ERA is deemed justified since the product is a generic version of an already approved one and 
it is not likely to change the total market of Amlodipine besilate and Valsartan. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval of Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for Amlodipine besilate/Valsartan, 5 mg/80 mg, 5 mg/160 mg and 10 mg/160 mg 
containing amlodipine and valsartan. To support the marketing authorisation application the applicant 
conducted 2 bioequivalence studies with cross-over design under fasting conditions. The bioequivalence of 
the test formulation versus the reference product has been investigated on the 5mg/160 mg strength (study 
3064/13) and 10 mg/160 mg strength (study 3065/13).

60 healthy, adult, non-smoking, human male subjects of Asian origin, between 19 and 42 years of age with a 
BMI 19 – 29.8 kg/m2 were enrolled and randomized. 55 subjects completed the study. 
The data of 55 subjects were included for pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis for valsartan. The data of 
first 30 subjects were included for pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis for amlodipine.   
Analytical methods 
The  validated  HPLC/MS/MS  method  for  the  determination  of  valsartan  concentration  in  K3EDTA  human 
plasma was used over a concentration range of 50.015 ng/ml to 9002.664 ng/ml. The quality control sample 
(QC)  concentrations  of  valsartan  were:  150.044  ng/ml,  1700.503  ng/ml,  3401.006  ng/ml,  6802.013  ng/ml.  
The internal standard was olmesartan impurity.  
A  total  of  2760  samples were  received  and 2640  samples  were  analyzed  from  the  55  evaluable  subjects.  A 
total of 201 samples (7.61% of the total samples analyzed) were repeated for valsartan. The incurred sample 
reanalysis was performed on 264 samples but the acceptance criteria was based on data generated for 263 
samples. The total of 84.79% ISR samples of valsartan were found to be within ± 20% of their original assay 
values. 
The  UPLC/MS/MS  method  for  the  determination  of  amlodipine  concentration  in  K3EDTA  human  plasma  was 
used over a concentration range of 0.100 ng/ml to 7.021 ng/ml. The QC concentrations of amlodipine were: 
0.302  ng/ml,  1.248  ng/ml,  2.495  ng/ml,  5.433  ng/ml.  Amlodipine-D4  maleic  acid  was  used  as  an  internal 
standard.  
A  total  of  2759  samples were  received  and 1439  samples  were  analyzed  from  the  30  evaluable  subjects.  A 
total of 9 samples (0.63% of the total samples analyzed) were repeated for amlodipine. The incurred sample 
reanalysis was performed on 144 samples. The total of 93.06% ISR samples of amlodipine were found to be 
within ± 20% of their original assay values. 
Long term stability of valsartan and amlodipine at -70±15ºC was proven for the largest storage period of the 
study samples.    
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
The  following  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  amlodipine  and  valsartan  were  determined  for  both  products 
by non-compartmental method of Phoenix® Version 6.3.0.395. 
Amlodipine – AUC0-72, Cmax, Tmax, Kel, t1/2, NKEL, TLIN, LQCT 
Valsartan – AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, AUC ratio, Tmax, Kel, t1/2, NKEL, TLIN, LQCT 
Standards for bioequivalence 
The 90% confidence interval of the relative mean AUC0-72 and Cmax for amlodipine and AUC0-t and Cmax 
for  valsartan  of  the  test  and  reference  product  should  be  at  least  80.00%  and  not  more  than  125.00%  for 
log-transformed data.  
Statistical methods  
In  presented  study  the  randomization  schedule  was  generated  with  statistical  software  (SAS®  version  9.2 
SAS  Institute  Inc.,  Cary  NC,  USA).  Main  statistical  methodology  based  on:  sample  size  evaluation  and 
statistical analysis for bioequivalence of tested and reference products.

In the study the sample size calculation was based on the observed intra-subject coefficients of variation (CV 
%) for valsartan and amlodipine. The parameters (CV) were obtained from sponsor’s in-house study data for 
valsartan (Cmax and AUC not exceeding 36% and assuming the true ratio falling within 95% to 105%) and 
sponsor’s  in-house  estimates  and  the  literature  data  for  amlodipine.  Studies  should  have  at  least  54 
evaluable subjects to show the bioequivalence with a power of 80% at 5% level of significance. The applicant 
considering dropouts and/ or withdrawals decided to enroll 60 patients into the study. 
Study  population  in  trial  for  valsartan  pharmacokinetics  variables  analysis  consisted  of  55  healthy,  adult, 
Asian volunteers. For the study 60 patients was enrolled but 5 was considered as dropouts (4 from I chase, 1 
from II chase).  
Patients were healthy, adult, Asian volunteers. 
First 30 cases was an attempt to study analysis of pharmacokinetics parameters for amlodipine.    
Statistical analysis of primary endpoint consisted pharmacokinetic variables/parameters. 
In the study primary variables were: 
- AUC0-72, Tmax and Cmax for Amlodipine  
- AUC0-t and Cmax, T max for Valsartan  
The following summary statistics for the pharmacokinetic parameters were to calculate for both the Test (T) 
and Reference (R) products: Number of observations (N), arithmetic mean (mean), standard deviation (SD), 
minimum, maximum, median and percentage coefficient of variation (CV%) geometric mean (GM). 
The analysis consisted with data from 24 time points (blood samples). 
The  log-transformed  pharmacokinetic parameters  - AUC0-72  and  Cmax  of  Amlodipine  and  AUC0-t,  AUC0-∞ 
and  Cmax  of  Valsartan  were  analyzed  using  General  Linear  Model  (PROC  GLM  procedure)  of  SAS®.  The 
ANOVA  model  included  sequence,  subjects  nested  within  sequence,  period  and  treatment  as  fixed  effects. 
The  sequence  effect  was  tested  at  the  10%  level  of  significance  using  the  mean  sum  of  square  of  subjects 
nested within sequence from the ANOVA as the error term, in the F-ratio of the sequence effect. All the fixed 
effects  were  tested  at  the  5%  level  of  significance  using  the  residual  error  (mean  square  error)  from  the 
ANOVA, as error term in the F-ratio for the respective main effects. 
The ratio of the Test and Reference product averages (Least Square Means) was estimated for the differences 
in the Least Square Means (LSM) of the logtransformed data of AUC0-72 and Cmax for Amlodipine and AUC0-
t,AUC0-∞  and  Cmax  for  Valsartan,  then  taking  the  anti-log  of  the  estimates.  Consistent  with  Schuirmann’s 
two one-sided tests procedure for bioequivalence, the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the Test and 
Reference  was  estimated  using  the  difference  of  least  square  mean  between  test  and  reference  (estimate), 
the‘t’  value  at  Mean  Square  Error  Degrees  of  Freedom  and  the  Standard  Error  of  Estimate.  The  Standard 
Error of Estimate was calculated using the Mean Square Error and the number of reference subjects from the 
GLM - ANOVA Model. 
Non-parametric analysis of Tmax was performed on untransformed data of Amlodipine and Valsartan, using 
the  Wilcoxon  signed-rank  test  with  estimated  median  difference,  90%  confidence  interval  is  based  on 
Hodges-Lehmann’s method.

Analytical methods   
The  validated  HPLC/MS/MS  method  for  the  determination  of  valsartan  concentration  in  K3EDTA  human 
plasma was used over a concentration range of 50.000 ng/ml to 7999.992 ng/ml. The quality control sample 
(QC)  concentrations  of  valsartan  were:  149.911  ng/ml,  1399.167  ng/ml,  2798.334  ng/ml,  5996.430  ng/ml.  
The internal standard was olmesartan impurity.  
A  total  of  2685  samples  were  received  and  2589  samples  were  analyzed  from  the  56  subjects  who  have 
completed both the study periods (including 97 samples from safety evaluations of subjects withdrawn due to 
adverse  events).  A  total of  98  samples  (3.79%  of  the  total  samples  analyzed)  were  repeated  for  valsartan. 
The  incurred  sample  reanalysis  was  performed  on  254  samples.  The  total  of  92.13%  ISR  samples  of 
valsartan were found to be within ± 20% of their original assay values. 
The  UPLC/MS/MS  method  for  the  determination  of  amlodipine  concentration  in  K3EDTA  human  plasma  was 
used over a concentration range of 0.101 ng/ml to 10.111 ng/ml. The QC concentrations of amlodipine were: 
0.303  ng/ml,  1.534  ng/ml,  3.836  ng/ml,  7.632  ng/ml.  Amlodipine-D4  maleic  acid  was  used  as  an  internal 
standard.  
A  total  of  2685  samples were  received  and 1438  samples  were  analyzed  from  the  30  evaluable  subjects.  A 
total  of  18  samples  (1.25%  of  the  total  samples  analyzed)  were  repeated  for  amlodipine.  The  incurred 
sample reanalysis was performed on 144 samples but the acceptance criteria was based on data generated 
for  142  samples.  The  total  of  98.59%  ISR  samples  of  amlodipine  were  found  to  be  within  ±  20%  of  their 
original assay values. 
Long term stability of valsartan and amlodipine at -70±15ºC was proven for the largest storage period of the

The  following  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  amlodipine  and  valsartan  were  determined  for  both  products 
by non-compartmental method of Phoenix® Version 6.3.0.395. 
Amlodipine – AUC0-72, Cmax, Tmax, Kel, t1/2, NKEL, TLIN, LQCT 
Valsartan – AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, AUC ratio, Tmax, Kel, t1/2, NKEL, TLIN, LQCT 
Standards for bioequivalence 
The 90% confidence interval of the relative mean AUC0-72 and Cmax for amlodipine and AUC0-t and Cmax 
for  valsartan  of  the  test  and  reference  product  should  be  at  least  80.00%  and  not  more  than  125.00%  for 
log-transformed data.  
Statistical methods   
In  presented  study  all  conducted  statistical  analysis  including  preparing  randomization  schedule  was 
generated with statistical software (SAS® version 9.2). 
Main  statistical  methodology  in  presented  studies  was:  sample  size  evaluation  and  statistical  analysis  for 
bioequivalence of tested and reference products. 
In the study the sample size calculation was based on the observed intra-subject coefficients of variation (CV 
%) for valsartan and amlodipine. The parameters (CV) were obtained from sponsor’s in-house study data for 
valsartan (Cmax and AUC not exceeding 36% and assuming the true ratio falling within 95% to 105%) and 
sponsor’s in-house estimates and the literature data for amlodipine. Study should have at least 54 evaluable

subjects  to  show  the  bioequivalence  with  a  power  of  80%  at  5%  level  of  significance.  The  applicant 
considering dropouts and/ or withdrawals decided to enrol 60 patients into the studies. 
60  healthy,  adult,  Asian  volunteers  were  enrolled  into  the  study.  All  of  study  population  for  valsartan 
pharmacokinetics  variables  analysis  consisted  of  53  subjects  (dosed  in  both  periods)  and  52  subjects 
completed  the  study.    In  the  study  analysis  of  pharmacokinetics  parameters  for  amlodipine  concerned  30 
patients only.    
The statistical outlier test was performed on the pharmacokinetic data of 30 subjects for amlodipine and 52 
subjects for valsartan using studentized residual test. 
In the study primary variables were: 
- AUC0-72 ,T max and Cmax for Amlodipine  
- AUC0-t and Cmax, T max for Valsartan  
and bioequivalence criteria were based on the 90% Confidence Intervals for these parameters. 
The following summary statistics for the pharmacokinetic parameters were to calculate for both the Test (T) 
and Reference (R) products: Number of observations (N), arithmetic mean (mean), standard deviation (SD), 
minimum, maximum, median and percentage coefficient of variation (CV%) geometric mean (GM). 
The analysis consisted with data from 24 time points (blood samples). 
The  log-transformed  pharmacokinetic parameters  - AUC0-72  and  Cmax  of  Amlodipine  and  AUC0-t,  AUC0-∞ 
and  Cmax  of  Valsartan  were  analyzed  using  General  Linear  Model  (PROC  GLM  procedure)  of  SAS®.  The 
ANOVA  model  included  sequence,  subjects  nested  within  sequence,  period  and  treatment  as  fixed  effects. 
The  sequence  effect  was  tested  at  the  10%  level  of  significance  using  the  mean  sum  of  square  of  subjects 
nested within sequence from the ANOVA as the error term, in the F-ratio of the sequence effect. All the fixed 
effects  were  tested  at  the  5%  level  of  significance  using  the  residual  error  (mean  square  error)  from  the 
ANOVA, as error term in the F-ratio for the respective main effects. 
The ratio of the Test and Reference product averages (Least Square Means) was estimated for the differences 
in the Least Square Means (LSM) of the logtransformed data of AUC0-72 and Cmax for Amlodipine and AUC0-
t,AUC0-∞  and  Cmax  for  Valsartan,  then  taking  the  anti-log  of  the  estimates.  Consistent  with  Schuirmann’s 
two one-sided tests procedure for bioequivalence, the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the Test and 
Reference  was  estimated  using  the  difference  of  least  square  mean  between  test  and  reference  (estimate), 
the‘t’  value  at  Mean  Square  Error  Degrees  of  Freedom  and  the  Standard  Error  of  Estimate.  The  Standard 
Error of Estimate was calculated using the Mean Square Error and the number of reference subjects from the 
GLM - ANOVA Model. 
Non-parametric analysis of Tmax was performed on untransformed data of Amlodipine and Valsartan, using 
the  Wilcoxon  signed-rank  test  with  estimated  median  difference,  90%  confidence  interval  is  based  on 
Hodges-Lehmann’s method. 
The study was conducted in two groups, group I with subject nos. 01 - 40 and group II with subject nos. 41 
– 60. 
The study design established analysis of variance for combined group. 
ANOVA  was  to  be  used  on  the  log-transformed  pharmacokinetic  parameters-  AUC0-72  and  Cmax  for 
Amlodipine and AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax for Valsartan using a GLM ANOVA model with the main effects of

Based  on  the  statistical  outlier  test  subject  no.  53  was  detected  as  an  outlier  for  the  pharmacokinetic 
parameters  AUC0-t,  AUC0-∞  and  Cmax  of  valsartan.  The  statistical  analysis  for  valsartan  has  been 
performed on both the datasets i.e. including as well as excluding the outlier. 
According  to  the  Guideline  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.  1/Corr**:  “Exclusion  of  data  cannot  be  accepted 
on  the  basis  of  statistical  analysis  or  for  pharmacokinetic  reasons  alone,  because  it  is  impossible  to 
distinguish the formulation effects from other effects influencing the pharmacokinetics.”  
However, the case when a subject has a very low plasma concentrations of the reference medicinal product is 
the exception allowed by the Guideline. The AUC of the reference product is less than 5% of geometric mean 
AUC  in  the  case  of  outlier  in  the  study  3065/13.  Therefore,  the  exclusion  of  data  from  this  subject  can  be 
accepted. 
The 90% confidence interval of the relative mean AUC0-72 and Cmax for amlodipine and AUC0-t and Cmax 
for valsartan (excluding outlier subject no. 53) of the test and reference product were within the acceptance 
range of 80.00% to 125.00% for log-transformed data.  
Based  on  the  results  obtained  in  the  study  3065/13,  Amlodipine  Besilate/Valsartan,  10  mg/  160  mg,  film-
coated  tablets  of  Mylan  and  Exforge®  10  mg/  160  mg  tablet  of  Novartis  Limited  UK  were  judged  to  be 
bioequivalent in healthy, adult subjects under fasting conditions.  
Safety data 
One medical event (soft tissue injury) was reported for subject no. 58 prior to dosing in period I, which was 
mild and resolved completely before dosing of the investigational product.  
There were 12 adverse events reported during the study of which 11 were related and 01 was unrelated to 
the  investigational  products.  Of  the  related  adverse  events,  04  occurred  following  administration  of  test 
product  and  07  following administration  of  reference  product.  All  adverse  events  were  mild  in  intensity  and 
resolved completely without sequelae.  
Pharmacokinetic Conclusion   
The  bioequivalence  of  the  applied  product  5  mg/160  mg  strength  with  the  respective  strength  of  the 
reference product Exforge® film-coated tablets has been demonstrated.   
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.

2.4.4.  Additional data 
In  vitro  dissolution  tests  were  conducted  using  Type  –  II  apparatus  (paddle),  75  rpm,  1000  ml  of  three 
different  media  0.1N  Hydrochloric  acid,  pH  4.5  Acetate  buffer  and  pH  6.8  Phosphate  buffer  comparing  the 
test  and  reference  biobatches  used  in  both  bioequivalence  studies  as  well  as  the  test  biobatch  Amlodipine 
Besilate/Valsartan  10mg/160  mg,  film-coated  tablet  with  the  lower  strength  of  the  applied  product  i.e. 
Amlodipine Besilate/Valsartan 5 mg/80 mg, film-coated tablet. 
Regarding  in  vitro  dissolution  tests  complementary  to  the  bioequivalence  studies,  the  dissolution  profiles  of 
biobatches at pH 6.8 phosphate buffer and pH 4.5 acetate buffer can be considered similar as the f2 value for 
amlodipine and valsartan has been found between 50 and 100. There were no similarity of in vitro dissolution 
at  0.1  N  HCl  between  the  test  and  the  reference  biobatch  10  mg/160  mg  strength.  The  f2  value  for 
amlodipine and valsartan was found to be less than 50.  
The  results  of  comparative  dissolution  of  the  biobatches  at  0.1  N  HCl  indicate  that  the  test  product  show 
faster  dissolution  than  the  reference  Exforge  (which  is  more  pronounced  for  amlodipine).  The  possible 
reasons for this discrepancy were discussed by the applicant. The dissimilarity of dissolution profiles between 
the biobatches 10 mg/160 mg strength at 0.1 N HCl is not expected to have any clinical significance, which is 
also  confirmed  by  the  in  vivo  study  were  both  the  test  and  the  reference  product  were  found  to  be 
bioequivalent.  
The applicant has provided the additional dissolution data between the applied 5 mg/80 mg strength and the 
10  mg/160  mg  biobatch  under  the  conditions  described  in  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of 
Bioequivalence  i.e.  Type  II  apparatus  (paddle),  500  rpm,  900  ml  of  three  dissolution  media  (0.1  N  HCl,  pH 
4.5  Acetate  buffer,  pH  6.8  Phosphate  buffer).  The  dissolution  profiles  were  found  to  be  similar  in  all  the 
media studied. Therefore the biowaiver for the 5 mg/80 mg dose strength can be granted.  
2.4.5.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In  both  studies,  the  90%  confidence  interval  for  the  relative  mean  AUC0-72  and  Cmax  for  amlodipine  and 
AUC0-t and Cmax for valsartan (excluding outlier subject in study 3065/13) of the test and reference product 
were within the acceptance range of 80.00% to 125.00% for log-transformed data.  
Studies  submitted  by  the  applicant  include  statistical  analysis  appropriate  to  bioequivalence  studies. 
Guidelines include provisions as to compare parameters such as mean and median in theanalyses, so the use 
of ANOVA and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for primary endpoint was justified. 
2.4.7.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The  bioequivalence  of  the  applied  product  Amlodipine  Besilate/Valsartan,  film-coated  tablets,  5  mg/160  mg 
and  10  mg/160  mg  strength  with  the  respective  strength  of  the  reference  product  Exforge®  film-coated 
tablets of Novartis Europharm Limited has been demonstrated.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
Based  on  submitted  bioequivalence  studies  the  Amlodipine  Besilate/  Valsartan  Mylan  film-coated  tablets  5 
mg/160 mg and 10 mg/160 mg are considered bioequivalent with the reference product Exforge.  
An acceptable justification for a biowaiver for Amlodipine Besilate/Valsartan, 5 mg/80 mg, film-coated tablets 
has  been  provided.  According 
to 
the  Guideline  on 
the 
Investigation  of  Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.  1  –  August  2010),  Amlodipine  Besilate/Valsartan,  5  mg/80  mg  film-coated 
tablets satisfy the conditions for waiver of bioequivalence studies conducted on the applied product 5 mg/160 
mg and 10 mg/160 mg strength.  
This application concerns a generic version of amlodipine valsartan film-coated tablets. The reference product 
Exforge is indicated for treatment of essential hypertension, in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately 
controlled  on  amlodipine  or  valsartan  monotherapy.  No  nonclinical  studies  have  been  provided  for  this 
application  but  an  adequate  summary  of  the  available  nonclinical  information  for  the  active  substance  was 
presented  and  considered  sufficient.  From  a  clinical  perspective,  this  application  does  not  contain  new  data 
on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics  as  well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; 
the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was 
considered sufficient. 
The  bioequivalence  studies  forms  the  pivotal  basis  of  this  application.  The  study  design  was  considered 
adequate  to  evaluate  the  bioequivalence  of  this  formulation  and  was  in  line  with  the  respective  European 
requirements.  The  choice  of  dose,  sampling  points,  overall  sampling  time  as  well  as  wash-out  period  were 
adequate.  The  analytical  method  was  validated.  Pharmacokinetic  and  statistical  methods  applied  were 
adequate.

The  test  formulation  of  Amlodipine/Valsartan  Mylan  5  mg/80  mg,  5  mg/160  mg  and  10  mg/160  mg,  film-
coated tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with Exforge 5 mg/80 mg, 
5 mg/160 mg and 10 mg/160 mg film-coated tablets. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals 
for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range 
of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen  reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk  balance  of  Amlodipine/Valsartan  Mylan  5  mg/80  mg,  5  mg/160  mg  and  10  mg/160  mg,  film-
coated  tablets  in  the  treatment  of  essential  hypertension  is  favourable  and  therefore  recommends  the

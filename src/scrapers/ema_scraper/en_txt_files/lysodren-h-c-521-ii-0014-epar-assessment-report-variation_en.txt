therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
The MAH applied for an extension of the indication for the treatment of non-functional adrenal cortical 
carcinoma. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC 
based on final data from Study FIRM-ACT further to the assessment of FUM 008.  
The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives with Croatia in the 
Package Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 9. 
Finally the MAH proposed to make some editorial changes to the SmPC. 
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
Lysodren was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/02/102 EU on 12 June 2002.  
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above mentioned orphan 
designation.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Adrenal Cortical carcinomas (ACC) are highly malignant tumours with a very poor prognosis: a review 
from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (USA) from 1980 to 1991 indicated a mean survival 
time of 9 months in patients whose tumours are unresectable. Approximately 60% of patients have a 
functional ACC, defined by the existence of signs of excess adrenal hormone production. ACC can be 
found at any age but the incidence of tumours peaks in the first and fifth decade, especially in male 
patients. There is an increased prevalence of ACC in females (female to male ratio: 2.5), which is more 
marked in patients with functional tumours. Men with ACC tend to be older than women.  
Whenever possible, curative surgery is the treatment of choice: after tumour resection, the mean 
disease-free interval is 12 months with a wide range (1 to 175 months), with no difference between 
patients with functional or non-functional tumours. The existence of a regional disease significantly 
reduces the disease-free interval after surgery. In patients with recurrent disease, surgery should be 
considered and should be performed if complete removal is feasible. If surgery is not possible and in 
patients with metastatic disease, mitotane therapy is used either alone or associated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy.

Mitotane or o, p’- DDD (1-(o-chlorophenyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane) is an isomer and a 
derivative of the insecticide DDT that acts blocking several steroidogenic enzymes with consequent 
alteration of peripheral steroid metabolism, direct suppression of adrenal cortex and impact on 
cortisone metabolism.  
The approved indication of Lysodren is as follows: 
‘‘Symptomatic treatment of advanced (unresectable, metastatic or relapsed) adrenal cortical carcinoma 
(ACC). The effect of Lysodren on non-functional adrenal cortical carcinoma is not established’’. 
The recommended dose of Lysodren is 2 to 3 g/day divided into two or three doses.  
In this application, the MAH of Lysodren proposed to change the indication by removing the sentence 
“The effect of Lysodren on non-functional adrenal cortical carcinoma is not established’. Further to the 
assessment of the CHMP and their conclusions as detailed in this report that this extension of the 
indication was not considered approvable, the MAH decided not to pursue the proposed change to the 
indication. 
However, the CHMP agreed to the proposal from the MAH to update sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC based on the results of the FIRM-ACT study. The PL has been updated accordingly.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives with Croatia in the 
Package Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 9.  
Finally the MAH made some editorial changes to the SmPC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application. 
2.2.1.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacologic properties and the toxicological profile of mitotane have been adequately described 
and assessed in previous applications. No additional non-clinical studies are considered necessary. The 
absence of new non-clinical data was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK FIRM-ACT (LYS-001) study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419286/2013  
Page 4/23 
 
 
 
 
 
The clinical study report of the PK FIRM-ACT ancillary analysis (LYS-001 study) and additional 
pharmacokinetics data further to 3 months of treatment have been submitted.  
A subset of 40 FIRM ACT patients were enrolled in this study, but overall 32 patients were considered 
for the primary PK analysis, 20 in the high dose regimen and 12 in the low dose regimen. The first 
patient was enrolled on 15 June 2005 and the last one was enrolled on 22 February 2010. 
Results 
According to the main results from PK FIRM-ACT study, the mean mitotane maximal plasma 
concentrations and exposure were approximately 30% superior in the high-dose regimen (15.3 ± 7.5 
mg/L) in comparison to the low-dose regimen (11.8 ± 4.7 mg/L), with a higher number of patients 
treated with high dose mitotane reaching the effective plasma level (14 mg/L). However, the 
difference was not statistically significant. 
Mean cumulated doses over the treatment period (12 weeks) were 60% higher in the high dose 
regimen when compared to the low-dose regimen with mean values of 440±142 g in the high-dose 
regimen versus 272±121 g in the low-dose regimen (p=0.013). 
In both dose regimens, the median maximal plasma concentrations were reached after approximately 
2.5 months and the steady state was not attained by the end of the study (Day 82). 
In the high dose regimen, half of patients (10/20) reached at least once mitotane plasma 
concentrations above 14 mg/L after a median 46 days of treatment, while 4 out 12 patients in the low-
dose regimen achieved this threshold with a median time of 55 days. 
Further to LYS-001 study period (from Day 82 to Day 187), 7 out of 12 patients reached plasma 
mitotane levels >14 mg/L at least at one time point during follow-up from treatment initiation to Day 
187. Among them 4 were in the initial high dose regimen group and the other 3 in the initial low dose 
regimen group.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Results from this study on pharmacokinetics had not been considered adequate to allow drawing any 
firm conclusion, as the mitotane steady-state has not been reached during the study period, and the 
rate of patients in each regimen (high and low dose) able to achieve the therapeutic window was 
unknown. 
Data from additional PK analysis after the 3 months of treatment considered in the CSR of the LYS-001 
study were limited to information on the dose spontaneously reported by the investigator.  
The available PK data do not affect the strategy of initiating treatment either with low or with high 
dose and the need to regularly adjust the dose according to mitotane plasma levels and the clinical 
tolerability, as already indicated in the SmPC.  
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The provided results of the PK analysis failed to further clarify the mitotane PK profile.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
FIRM ACT study  
The FIRM-ACT study was a randomized phase III trial, designed to compare two regimens used for the 
treatment of advanced adrenocortical carcinoma (etoposide, doxorubicin, cisplatin and mitotane versus 
streptozocin and mitotane) (Fassnacht et al., 2012).

The Lysodren dose regimen was left to the responsibility of the local investigator, with two possible 
dose regimens:  
• The low starting dose approach (low-dose regimen): Lysodren was administered at a starting dose of 
1 g/day and increased stepwise every 3 days by 0.5 g up to a total dose of 4.0 g and then adjusted 
according to plasma concentrations and tolerability.  
• The high starting dose approach (high-dose regimen): Lysodren was administered at a starting dose 
of 1.5 g / day, then increased on day 2 to 3 g/ day, on day 3 to 4.5 g/day, and on day 4 to 6 g/day. 
This latter dose was administered until the first mitotane plasma level was assayed. Dose was then 
adjusted according to plasma concentrations and tolerability.  
In both treatment schedules, mitotane was started a minimum of 1 week before the initiation of the 
cytotoxic treatment, with the aim to attain a blood level of 14 to 20 mg per litre. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of the two randomised treatments. 
A secondary objective was to investigate the relationship between Lysodren dose (daily and 
cumulative) and mitotane plasma concentrations using one of two pre-defined treatment regimens 
(high-dose and low-dose).  
The secondary objectives also included the evaluation of the impact of Lysodren treatment on certain 
hormonal parameters and the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of Lysodren treatment.  
The main focus of this report is on the secondary objectives.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint for the FIRM ACT study was overall survival, and secondary endpoints were 
progression-free survival, tumour response and quality of life. 
Sample size and statistical considerations 
The target sample size was 300 patients. The trial was designed to have a power of 80% to detect a 
risk reduction of 33% in the EDP–mitotane group, as compared with the streptozocin–mitotane group. 
Such an analysis would require the observation of up to 200 deaths on the basis of a two-sided group 
sequential logrank test at a type I error level of 5%. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-
treat basis. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized to receive therapy with Etoposide, Doxorubicin, Cisplatin plus Lysodren 
(EDP/M) or Streptozotocin plus Lysodren (STZ/M) as first line treatment in a 1:1 ratio. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study.

population, 16.3 mg/l in the 
responders subgroup, 11.6 
mg/l in patients with SD and 
11 mg/l for non-responders 
(p=0.03). 
Using the ROC curve analysis, 
the cut-off level of 14 mg/l 
resulted in 65% sensitivity and 
69% specificity. Cut off values 
of 16, 18, and 20 mg/l were 
associated with a lower 
sensitivity but a higher 
specificity. 
Survival from time to first 
mitotane dose was 
significantly longer for patients 
achieving the ≥14 mg/l 
threshold (HR 0.52, 0.28-0.97, 
p=0.004). The observed 
survival benefit was even 
greater for patients who 
received mitotane as 
monotherapy in univariate and 
multivariate analysis 
Plasma mitotane 
level ≥ 14 mg/l was 
a powerful 
prognostic factor in 
multivariate 
analysis. 
The strategy to start 
mitotane as first line 
therapy may confer 
a greater chance to 
rapidly achieve 
therapeutic plasma 
levels of mitotane. 
An alternative could 
be that this 
parameter identifies 
a subgroup of 
patients with lower 
tumour 
aggressiveness 
allowing more time 
to initiate mitotane 
Confirmation of the 
relevance of 
mitotane plasma 
levels ≥ 14 mg/l for 
responder’s 
definition and 
significant 
improvement of 
survival from the 
time of first 
mitotane dose. 
The 14 mg/l 
threshold appeared 
as a good 
compromise in terms 
of sensitivity and 
specificity. 
Some patients below 
14 mg/l may 
respond, however 
they all received 
concomitant 
chemotherapy. The 
benefit in this case 
may result from the 
combination of 
drugs.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The provided results of the PK analysis failed to further clarify the mitotane PK profile, and 
consequently at this point an optimal dosing schedule cannot be recommended.  
Mitotane plasma levels and the possible relationship with its efficacy were studied in the FIRM ACT 
trial, a randomized, prospective, controlled, open-label, multicentre, parallel-group study to compare 
the efficacy of etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatine plus mitotane (EDP/M) to that of streptozotocin 
plus mitotane (Sz/M) as first-line treatment in 304 patients. The analysis of patients who achieved 
mitotane levels ≥ 14mg/l at least once in six months versus patients who mitotane levels were < 14 
mg/l could suggest that patients with mitotane plasma levels ≥ 14mg/l could have an improvement in 
disease control rate (62.9% versus 33.5%; p<0.0001). However, this result should be cautiously 
taken since the examination of the mitotane effects was not the primary endpoint of the study (see 
SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1).  
Consistently with these results, in a retrospective review recently published (Hermsen, 2011), the 
median mitotane plasma level was 16.3 mg/l in the responders subgroup, 11.6 mg/l in patients with 
SD and 11 mg/l for non-responders (p=0.03). 
Both in the FIRM ACT study and in the Hermsen review, patients with functional as well as non-
functional ACC were included. 
Even though in the FIRM ACT study 51.3 % of not symptomatic patients (77 out of the 138) seemed to 
have mitotane plasma level ≥14 mg/l at least once during the first 6 months, data on disease control 
reported in this specific patient population have not been provided.  Results of subgroup analyses in 
patients with non-functional tumours enrolled in both treatment arms in the FIRM ACT trial have not 
been provided. In addition, taking into account that the FIRM-ACT was designed to compare the 
efficacy of etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin plus mitotane (EDP/M) to that of streptozotocin plus 
mitotane (Sz/M) as first-line treatment, the CHMP considered that based on the results of the FIRM-
ACT study, the efficacy of mitotane in the treatment of patients with non-functional adrenal cortical 
carcinoma, cannot be defined since both arms of the trial included mitotane in combination.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The submitted data did not provide sufficient level of evidence to establish the effect of mitotane on 
non-functional adrenal cortical carcinoma.  
Further to the assessment of the CHMP and their conclusions as detailed in this report that this 
extension of the indication was not considered approvable, the MAH decided not to pursue with the 
proposed change to the indication. 
Sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated to include the mitotane plasma levels and the 
possible relationship with efficacy based on the results of the FIRM-ACT study. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Adverse events 
In the PK FIRM ACT trial, 39 out of 40 patients presented at least one AE and 4 patients deceased in 
the high dose regimen following SAEs. However, none of these fatal SAEs were considered related to 
the administered treatments. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419286/2013  
Page 17/23 
 
 
 
 
 
In the high-dose regimen, 4 patients presented treatment related SAEs (Grade 3 nausea and vomiting; 
Grade 2 leukopenia; Grade 2 rash; Grade 3 ASAT and Grade 4 ALAT increase, reported each in 1 
patient). In the low-dose regimen, only 1 patient presented a treatment-related SAE (Grade 3 increase 
of liver enzymes). Eight patients reached a plasma mitotane level higher than 20 mg/l, but only 3 
presented treatment-related gastrointestinal disorders and in none of them signs of neurological 
toxicity were reported.  
An overall summary of patients who presented at least one AE and the number of AE likely or possibly 
treatment-related in the high and low-dose regimens is reported in the following Tables.

Table 12. Summary of treatment related AEs by regimen 
An  additional  analysis  (completed  in  16  March  2013)  based  on  the  MAH’s  global  Database  was 
submitted for the following adverse events through the spontaneous reporting: Dyspepsia; Dysgeusia; 
Oesophagitis; Balance Disorders; Clonus. 
•  Dysgeusia 
A  total  of  six  case  reports  involving  dysgeusia  coincident  with  the  use  of  Lysodren  were  identified  in 
the  HRA  Pharma  pharmacovigilance  database  including  one  serious  and  five  non-serious  cases.  Five 
reports  were  considered  as  spontaneous  and  the  remaining  case  was  from  clinical  trial;  four  of  the 5 
spontaneous  cases  were medically  confirmed.  Outcomes  were  reported  as  unknown  in  one  report,  as 
recovered in two reports and as not recovered in three reports.  
•  Dyspepsia  
Four spontaneous reports were identified from the above search coincident with the use of Lysodren (2 
serious  and  2  non-serious  reports);  3  reports  were  medically  confirmed.  Outcomes  were  reported  as 
unknown in 2 reports, as recovered in 1 report and as fatal in 1 report.  
•  Balance Disorders  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/419286/2013  
Page 19/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Five spontaneous reports were identified from the above search coincident with the use of Lysodren. 
One was serious and four were considered as non-serious; all the reports were medically confirmed. 
One case refers to a child patient. Outcomes were reported as recovering in two reports, as recovered 
in one report and as not recovered in the two remaining reports.  
The literature report involves a 4-year-old patient with precocious puberty who took mitotane as 
adjuvant chemotherapy for left androgen-secreting adrenocortical carcinoma. The adrenocortical 
tumour with focal necrosis and haemorrhage was totally removed. Mitotane therapy was started with 
0.5g/day and the dose was increased gradually by 0.5g/day during 1-2 weeks while monitoring the 
plasma level, up to 5.0g/day (plasma level, 13.43 μg/mL 3 months after initiation). The patient's 
concomitant medication included leuprorelin acetate. Five months after initiation of mitotane, the 
patient experienced an encephalopathy (anorexia, balance disorder, gait disturbance, speech disorder, 
apathy, memory impairment, quadriplegia, ataxia, cerebral atrophy, cerebellar atrophy, 
electroencephalogram abnormal) considered as due to the increased level of mitotane (34.55 μg/mL, 6 
months after mitotane initiation). Mitotane was discontinued and a high dose of hydrocortisone was 
administered for adrenal crisis. The plasma mitotane level gradually decreased, and the neurological 
symptoms improved. It took 6 months for the mitotane to disappear from the plasma and for clinical 
recovery of the encephalopathy. No signs of tumour recurrence have been observed for 3 years since 
discontinuation of mitotane. All neurological abnormalities found after initiation of mitotane, including 
memory disturbance and motor disability, were no longer present.  According to the author, there has 
been limited use of mitotane in children and its use remains to be established. Several side effects of 
mitotane are known, especially due to its narrow therapeutic range. A mitotane level of more than 20 
mg/L is associated with neurological toxicity. In this patient, encephalopathy appeared after 5 months 
despite monthly monitoring of the plasma level after determination of the dose. This might have been 
caused by gradual accumulation of lipid-soluble mitotane after the determination of the therapeutic 
dose. The mitotane assay is not performed regularly for clinical use; in fact it took 1-2 weeks to obtain 
the mitotane level data and the encephalopathy developed before he noticed the high level of 
mitotane. A temporal relationship and a positive dechallenge were reported for all the events including 
balance disorders, therefore the causal relationship is possible.  
•  Oesophagitis  
No case was identified from the above search.  
•  Clonus  
One serious case was identified from the above search coincident with the use of Lysodren.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Nine patients (7 in the high-dose regimen, 2 in the low-dose regimen) presented a total of 10 SAEs. 
none of the SAEs that resulted in death was related to the administered treatments. 
In the high-dose regimen three patients presented SAEs that were not related to the study treatments: 
one patient presented a Grade 4 lung disorder (compression of the right pulmonary hilus due to 
pulmonary metastasis); one patient presented a Grade 4 gastrointestinal haemorrhage; one patient 
presented a Grade 3 arthralgia. Four patients presented SAEs that were related to the study 
treatments: one patient presented Grade 3 nausea and vomiting (considered as two different SAEs); 
one patient presented a Grade 2 leucopenia; one patient presented a Grade 2 rash, an allergic reaction 
covering the entire body; one patient presented Grade 3 ASAT and Grade 4 ALAT increase.  
Assessment report

In the low-dose regimen, one patient presented a treatment-related SAE (Grade 3 increase of liver 
enzymes) and one patient presented a SAE (Grade 3 bone pain due to metastasis) that was not related 
to treatment (both patients received STZ). 
One patient presented a Grade 3 bone pain due to metastasis, not related to treatment.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The following treatment-related AEs were reported in the FIRM ACT study: dyspepsia, dysgeusia, 
oesophagitis, balance disorder and clonus. Since these events are considered as unexpected according 
to the current SmPC of Lysodren, an additional analysis was performed for each of these adverse 
events collected in the MAH’s Global Database through the spontaneous reporting.  
Regarding dysgeusia in all the reported cases there was a reasonable time sequence between Lysodren 
intake and dysgeusia, with a positive dechallenge in two of them. The causal relationship of Lysodren 
can be assessed as possible. Dysgeusia was added to section 4.8 of the SmPC. In addition, and based 
on the absence of recovery, this adverse reaction will be reviewed at the next PSUR planned in 2014 
(29 April 2011-28 April 2014).  
Based on the available data in the cases of dyspepsia and, due to a temporal association a causal role 
for Lysodren cannot be excluded. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to include dyspepsia as 
an adverse reaction with not known frequency.  
Considering that no oesophagitis cases have been retrieved in the MAH’s Pharmacovigilance Database, 
the CHMP agreed to review this adverse reaction in the next PSUR. 
In all (5) the cases of balance disorders there is a reasonable time sequence with Lysodren intake. In 4 
of these cases the event of balance disorder is reported in a context of mitotane plasma level above of 
the therapeutic window (> 20 mg/L in 3 reports) and a positive dechallenge reported in two of them. 
In addition, and based on the absence of recovery, this adverse reaction will be reviewed at the next 
PSUR. 
One case of encephalopathy has been observed in a paediatric patient five months after initiation of 
the treatment; this case was considered to be related to an increased mitotane plasma level of 34.5 
mg/l. After six months mitotane plasma levels were undetectable and the patient recovered clinically. 
The SmPC has been updated to include this information. 
No follow up information is available of the clonus HCP spontaneous case. Follow-up information will be 
reviewed in the next PSUR. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Further to the assessment of the CHMP and their conclusions as detailed in this report that this 
extension of the indication was not considered approvable, the MAH decided not to pursue with the 
proposed change to the indication. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the updated safety results. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

2.6.  Update of the Product information   
Further to data submitted in this application the following changes have been implemented in the 
Product information (new text: bold, underlined, old text: strikethrough). 
•  SmPC Section 4.2 
[..] 
Dose adjustments, monitoring and discontinuation 
Dose adjustment is aimed to reach a therapeutic window (mitotane plasma levels 14 - 20 mg/l) which 
ensures optimal use of Lysodren with acceptable safety. Indeed, neurologic toxicity has been 
associated with levels above 20 mg/l and therefore this threshold should not be reached. There are 
some data suggesting that mitotane plasma above 14 mg/l may result in enhanced efficacy 
(see section 5.1). Mitotane plasma levels higher than 20 mg/l may be associated with severe 
undesirable effects and offer no further benefit in terms of efficacy. Mitotane plasma levels should 
therefore be monitored in order to adjust the Lysodren dose and to avoid reaching toxic levels.

Paediatric patients 
Neuro-psychological retardation may be observed during mitotane treatment. In such cases, thyroid 
function should be investigated in order to identify a possible thyroid impairment linked to mitotane 
treatment. Hypothyroidism and growth retardation may be also observed. One case of 
encephalopathy has been observed in a paediatric patient five months after initiation of the 
treatment; this case was considered to be related to an increased mitotane plasma level of 
34.5 mg/l. After six months mitotane plasma levels were undetectable and the patient 
recovered clinically. 
•  SmPC Section 5.1 
[..] 
Mitotane plasma levels and the possible relationship with its efficacy were studied in the 
FIRM ACT trial, a randomized, prospective, controlled, open-label, multicentre, parallel-
group study to compare the efficacy of etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatine plus mitotane 
(EDP/M) to that of streptozotocin plus mitotane (Sz/M) as first-line treatment in 304 
patients. The analysis of patients who achieved mitotane levels ≥ 14mg/l at least once in 
six months versus patients who mitotane levels were < 14 mg/l could suggest that patients 
with mitotane plasma levels ≥ 14mg/l could have an improvement in disease control rate 
(62.9% versus 33.5%; p<0.0001). However, this result should be cautiously taken since the 
examination of the mitotane effects was not the primary endpoint of the study.   
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which 
were accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative of Croatia. 
3.  Recommendations 
Further to the assessment of the CHMP and their conclusions as detailed in this report that this 
extension of the indication was not considered approvable, the MAH decided not to pursue with the 
proposed change to the indication. 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

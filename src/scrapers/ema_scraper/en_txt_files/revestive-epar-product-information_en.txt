CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Revestive is indicated for the treatment of patients 4 months corrected gestational age and above with 
Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS). Patients should be stable following a period of intestinal adaptation 
after surgery. 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a medical professional with experience in the 
treatment of SBS. 
Treatment should not be initiated until it is reasonable to assume that a patient is stable following a 
period of intestinal adaptation. Optimisation and stabilisation of intravenous fluid and nutrition 
support should be performed before initiation of treatment. 
Clinical assessment by the physician should consider individual treatment objectives and patient 
preferences. Treatment should be stopped if no overall improvement of the patient condition is 
achieved. Efficacy and safety in all patients should be closely monitored on an ongoing basis 
according to clinical treatment guidelines. 
Posology 
Paediatric population (≥4 months) 
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a medical professional with experience in the 
treatment of paediatric SBS.

for dosing information. 
Adults  
The recommended dose of Revestive for adults is 0.05 mg/kg body weight once daily. For adults 
patients, the 5 mg strength vial should be used. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of 
Revestive 5 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection for dosing information. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for paediatric patients with mild renal impairment. In paediatric 
patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/min), and 
end-stage renal disease, the daily dose should be reduced by 50% (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for paediatric patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment 
based on a study conducted in Child-Pugh grade B adult subjects. Revestive has not been studied in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population (< 4 months) 
There are currently no available data in children below 4 months corrected gestational age. 
Method of administration 
The reconstituted solution should be administered by subcutaneous injection once daily, alternating 
sites between 1 of the 4 quadrants of the abdomen. In case the injection into the abdomen is hampered 
by pain, scarring or hardening of the tissue, the thigh can also be used. Revestive should not be 
administered intravenously or intramuscularly. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or trace 
residues of tetracycline. 
Active or suspected malignancy. 
Patients with a history of malignancies in the gastrointestinal tract, including the hepatobiliary system 
and pancreas within the last five years. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
It is strongly recommended that every time Revestive is administered to a patient, the name and lot 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the lot of the 
product. 
Adults 
Colo-rectal polyps 
A colonoscopy with removal of polyps should be performed at the time of starting treatment with 
Revestive. Once yearly follow-up colonoscopies (or alternate imaging) are recommended during the 
first 2 years of Revestive treatment. Subsequent colonoscopies are recommended at a minimum of 
five year intervals. An individual assessment whether increased frequency of surveillance is necessary 
should be performed based on the patient characteristics (e.g., age, underlying disease). See also 
section 5.1. If a polyp is found, adherence to current polyp follow-up guidelines is recommended. In 
case of malignancy, Revestive therapy must be discontinued (see section 4.3). 
Gastrointestinal neoplasia including hepatobiliary tract 
In the rat carcinogenicity study, benign tumours were found in the small bowel and the extrahepatic 
bile ducts. These observations were not confirmed in clinical studies of more than one year duration. If 
a neoplasia is detected, it should be removed. In case of malignancy, Revestive treatment must be 
discontinued (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). 
Gallbladder and bile ducts 
Cases of cholecystitis, cholangitis, and cholelithiasis have been reported in clinical studies. In case of 
gallbladder or bile duct-related symptoms, the need for continued Revestive treatment should be 
reassessed. 
Pancreatic diseases 
Pancreatic adverse events such as chronic and acute pancreatitis, pancreatic duct stenosis, pancreas 
infection and increased blood amylase and lipase have been reported in clinical studies. In case of 
pancreatic adverse events, the need for continued Revestive treatment should be reassessed. 
Monitoring of small bowel, gallbladder and bile ducts, and pancreas 
SBS patients are to be kept under close surveillance according to clinical treatment guidelines. This 
usually includes the monitoring of small bowel function, gallbladder and bile ducts, and pancreas for 
signs and symptoms, and, if indicated, additional laboratory investigations and appropriate imaging 
techniques. 
Intestinal obstruction 
Cases of intestinal obstruction have been reported in clinical studies. In case of recurrent intestinal 
obstructions, the need for continued Revestive treatment should be reassessed. 
Fluid overload and Electrolyte Balance 
To avoid fluid overload or dehydration, careful adjustment of parenteral support is required in patients 
taking Revestive. Electrolyte balance and fluid status should be carefully monitored throughout 
treatment, especially during initial therapeutic response and discontinuation of Revestive treatment  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fluid overload: 
Fluid overload has been observed in clinical trials. Fluid overload adverse events occurred most 
frequently during the first 4 weeks of therapy and decreased over time. 
Due to increased fluid absorption, patients with cardiovascular disease, such as cardiac insufficiency 
and hypertension, should be monitored with regard to fluid overload, especially during initiation of 
therapy. Patients should be advised to contact their physician in case of sudden weight gain, face 
swelling, swollen ankles and/or dyspnoea. In general, fluid overload can be prevented by appropriate 
and timely assessment of parenteral nutrition needs. This assessment should be conducted more 
frequently within the first months of treatment. 
Congestive heart failure has been observed in clinical trials. In case of a significant deterioration of the 
cardiovascular disease, the need for continued treatment with Revestive should be reassessed. 
Dehydration: 
Patients with SBS are susceptible to dehydration that may lead to acute renal failure.  
In patients receiving Revestive, parenteral support should be reduced carefully and should not be 
discontinued abruptly. The patient’s fluid status should be evaluated following parenteral support 
reduction and corresponding adjustment performed, as needed. 
Concomitant medicinal products 
Patients receiving oral concomitant medicinal products requiring titration or with a narrow therapeutic 
index should be monitored closely due to potential increased absorption (see section 4.5). 
Special clinical conditions 
Revestive has not been studied in patients with severe, clinically unstable concomitant diseases, (e.g., 
cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, infectious, endocrine, hepatic, or CNS), or in patients with 
malignancies within the last five years (see section 4.3). Caution should be exercised when prescribing 
Revestive. 
Hepatic impairment 
Revestive has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The data from use in 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment do not suggest a need for restricted use. 
Discontinuation of treatment 
Due to the risk of dehydration, discontinuation of treatment with Revestive should be managed 
carefully. 
Paediatric population 
See also general precautions for adults under this section. 
Colo-rectal polyps/Neoplasia 
Prior to initiating treatment with Revestive, faecal occult blood testing should be done for all children 
and adolescents. Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy is required if there is evidence of unexplained blood in 
the stool. Subsequent faecal occult blood testing should be done annually in children and adolescents 
while they are receiving Revestive. 
Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy is recommended for all children and adolescents after one year of 
treatment, every 5 years thereafter while on continuous treatment with Revestive, and if they have new 
or unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Excipients 
Revestive contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

Caution is needed when administering Revestive to persons with a known hypersensitivity to 
tetracycline (see section 4.3). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. An in vitro study 
indicates that teduglutide does not inhibit cytochrome P450 drug metabolising enzymes. Based upon 
the pharmacodynamic effect of teduglutide, there is a potential for increased absorption of 
concomitant medicinal products (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of Revestive in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct 
or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Revestive during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether teduglutide is excreted in human milk. In rats, mean teduglutide concentration 
in milk was less than 3% of the maternal plasma concentration following a single subcutaneous 
injection of 25 mg/kg. A risk to the breast-fed newborn/infant cannot be excluded. As a precautionary 
measure it is preferable to avoid the use of Revestive during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of teduglutide on human fertility. Animal data do not indicate any 
impairment of fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Revestive has minor influence on the ability to drive, ride a bicycle, and use machines. However, cases 
of syncope have been reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Such events might impact the 
ability to drive, ride a bicycle, or use machines. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse reactions were retrieved from 2 placebo-controlled clinical studies with teduglutide in 
109 adult patients with SBS treated with doses of 0.05 mg/kg/day and 0.10 mg/kg/day for up to 
24 weeks. Approximately 52% of the patients treated with teduglutide experienced adverse reactions 
(versus 36% of the patients given placebo). The most commonly reported adverse reactions were 
abdominal pain and distension (45%), respiratory tract infections (28%) (including nasopharyngitis, 
influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, and lower respiratory tract infection), nausea (26%), 
injection site reactions (26%), headache (16%), and vomiting (14%). Approximately 38% of the 
treated patients with a stoma experienced gastrointestinal stoma complications. The majority of these 
reactions were mild or moderate. 
No new safety signals have been identified in patients exposed to 0.05 mg/kg/day of teduglutide for up 
to 30 months in a long-term open-label extension study. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are 
defined as very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available 
data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immunogenicity 
Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing peptides, 
administration of Revestive may potentially trigger the development of antibodies. Based on 
integrated data from two trials in adults with SBS (a 6-month randomised placebo-controlled trial, 
followed by a 24-month open-label trial), the development of anti-teduglutide antibodies in subjects 
who received subcutaneous administration of 0.05 mg/kg teduglutide once daily was 3% (2/60) at 
Month 3, 17% (13/77) at Month 6, 24% (16/67) at Month 12, 33% (11/33) at Month 24, and

48% (14/29) at Month 30. In phase 3 studies with SBS patients who received teduglutide for ≥2 years, 
28% of patients developed antibodies against E. coli protein (residual host cell protein from the 
manufacture). The antibody formation has not been associated with clinically relevant safety findings, 
reduced efficacy or changed pharmacokinetics of Revestive. 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions occurred in 26% of SBS patients treated with teduglutide, compared to 5% of 
patients in the placebo arm. The reactions included injection site haematoma, injection site erythema, 
injection site pain, injection site swelling and injection site haemorrhage (see also section 5.3). The 
majority of reactions were moderate in severity and no occurrences led to drug discontinuation. 
C-reactive protein 
Modest increases of C-reactive protein of approximately 25 mg/l have been observed within the first 
seven days of teduglutide treatment, which decreased continuously under ongoing daily injections. 
After 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment, patients showed small overall increase in C-reactive protein 
of approximately 1.5 mg/l on average. These changes were neither associated with any changes in 
other laboratory parameters nor with any reported clinical symptoms. There were no clinically relevant 
mean increases of C-reactive protein from baseline following long-term treatment with teduglutide for 
up to 30 months. 
Paediatric population 
In two completed clinical trials, there were 87 paediatric subjects (aged 1 to 17 years) enrolled and 
exposed to teduglutide for a duration of up to 6 months. No subject discontinued the studies due to an 
adverse event. Overall, the safety profile of teduglutide (including type and frequency of adverse 
reactions, and immunogenicity) in children and adolescents (ages 1-17 years) was similar to that in 
adults. 
In three completed clinical studies in paediatric subjects (aged 4 to < 12 months corrected gestational 
age), the safety profile reported in these studies was consistent with the safety profile seen in the 
previous paediatric studies and no new safety issues were identified. 
Limited long-term safety data is available for the paediatric population. No data are available for 
children under 4 months of age 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The maximum dose of teduglutide studied during clinical development was 86 mg/day for 8 days. No 
unexpected systemic adverse reactions were seen (see section 4.8). 
In the event of an overdose, the patient should be carefully monitored by the medical professional.

and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX08.

Mechanism of action 
The naturally occurring human glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a peptide secreted by L cells of the 
intestine which is known to increase intestinal and portal blood flow, inhibit gastric acid secretion, and 
decrease intestinal motility. Teduglutide is an analogue of GLP-2. In several nonclinical studies, 
teduglutide has been shown to preserve mucosal integrity by promoting repair and normal growth of 
the intestine through an increase of villus height and crypt depth. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Similar to GLP-2, teduglutide is 33 amino acids in length with an amino acid substitution of alanine by 
glycine at the second position of the N-terminus. The single amino acid substitution relative to 
naturally occurring GLP-2 results in resistance to in vivo degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl 
peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), resulting in an extended half-life. Teduglutide increases villus height and 
crypt depth of the intestinal epithelium. 
Based on the findings derived from pre-clinical studies (see sections 4.4 and 5.3) and the proposed 
mechanism of action with the trophic effects on intestinal mucosa, there appears to be a risk for the 
promotion of small intestinal and/or colonic neoplasia. The clinical studies conducted could neither 
exclude nor confirm such an increased risk. Several cases of benign colorectal polyps occurred during 
the course of the trials, however, the frequency was not increased compared to placebo-treated 
patients. In addition to the need for a colonoscopy with removal of polyps by the time of the initiation 
of the treatment (see section 4.4.), every patient should be assessed for the need of an enhanced 
surveillance schedule based on the patient characteristics (e.g., age and underlying disease, previous 
occurrence of polyps etc.). 
Clinical efficacy 
Paediatric population 
Paediatric population 4 months to less than 12 months of age 
The efficacy data presented are derived from 1 controlled and 1 un-controlled core studies for a 28-
week duration, and 2 extension studies for up to 9 cycles (24 weeks per cycle) of teduglutide 
treatment. These studies included infants 4 months to < 12 months corrected gestational age: 
10 infants (2 infants aged 4 to < 6 months, 8 aged 6 to < 12 months) in the controlled study (5 in 
teduglutide treatment arm and 5 in standard of care arm), 2 infants in the un-controlled study (both 
treated). From the core controlled study, 6 of the 10 infants completed the study, and continued in the 
extension study (5 treated and 1 non-treated). From the core uncontrolled study, 2 infants completed 
the study and continued in the second extension study (both treated). The infants in these studies were 
treated with teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/day. Despite the limited sample size in the core and extension 
studies, clinically meaningful numerical reductions in the requirement for parenteral support were 
observed. 
The controlled core study  
Complete weaning 
No subject achieved enteral autonomy, i.e., complete weaning off PS during either core or extension 
studies. 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition volume 
In the controlled core study, based on subject diary data, 3 (60.0%) subjects enrolled in the TED arm 
and 1 (20.0%) subject in the SOC arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS volume at end of 
treatment (EOT) from baseline (2 subjects in the SOC arm had missing data). In the TED arm, the 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mean change in PS volume at EOT from baseline was -21.5±28.91 ml/kg/day (-24.8%). In the SOC 
arm, the mean change in PS volume at EOT from baseline was -9.5±7.50 ml/kg/day (-16.8%). 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition calories 
In the controlled core study, based on subject diary data, the mean percentage change in PS caloric 
intake at EOT from baseline was -27.0±29.47% for subjects in the TED arm and -13.7±21.87% in the 
SOC arm. 
Reduction in infusion time 
In the controlled core study, in the TED arm, the change in diary PS infusion time at EOT from 
baseline was -3.1±3.31 hours/day (-28.9%) and -1.9±2.01 days/week (-28.5%). In the SOC arm, the 
change in diary PS infusion time at EOT from baseline was -0.3±0.63 hours/day (-1.9%) and no 
change was observed on the days per week of PS infusion time. 
The un-controlled core study 
Complete weaning 
No infant subjects reached complete weaning. 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition volume 
Among the 2 infants included in and completed the study, a ≥ 20% reduction in PS volume was 
recorded in 1 infant during the teduglutide treatment. The mean change in PS volume at EOT from 
baseline was - 26.2±13.61 ml/kg/day (-26.7%). 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition calories 
In infants, the mean change in PS caloric intake at EOT from baseline was -13.8±3.17 kcal/kg/day 
(- 25.7%). 
Reduction in infusion time 
There was no change in daily PS usage hours in the 2 infants during the study. 
Paediatric population between 1 and 17 years of age 
The efficacy data presented are derived from 2 controlled studies in paediatric patients up to 24 weeks 
duration. These studies included 101 patients in the following age groups: 5 patients 1-2 years, 
56 patients 2 to < 6 years, 32 patients 6 to < 12 years, 7 patients 12 to < 17 years, and 1 patient 17 to 
< 18 years. Despite the limited sample size, which did not allow meaningful statistical comparisons, 
clinically meaningful, numerical reductions in the requirement for parenteral support were observed 
across all age groups. 
Teduglutide was studied in a 12-week, open-label, clinical study in 42 paediatric subjects aged 1 year 
through 14 years with SBS who were dependent on parenteral nutrition. The objectives of the study 
were to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of teduglutide compared to standard of care. Three 
(3) doses of teduglutide, 0.0125 mg/kg/day (n=8), 0.025 mg/kg/day (n=14), and 0.05 mg/kg/day 
(n=15), were investigated for 12 weeks. Five (5) subjects were enrolled in a standard of care cohort. 
Complete weaning 
Three subjects (3/15, 20%) on the recommended teduglutide dose were weaned off parenteral nutrition 
by Week 12. After a 4-week washout period, two of these patients had reinitiated parenteral nutrition 
support. 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition volume 
The mean change in parenteral nutrition volume from baseline at Week 12 in the ITT population, 
based on physician-prescribed data, was -2.57 (±3.56) l/week, correlating to a -39.11% (±40.79) mean 
decrease, compared to 0.43 (±0.75) l/week, correlating to a 7.38% (±12.76) increase in the standard of 
care cohort. At Week 16 (4 weeks following the end of treatment) parenteral nutrition volume 
reductions were still evident but less than observed at Week 12 when subjects were still on teduglutide

(mean decrease of -31.80% (±39.26) compared to a 3.92% (±16.62) increase in the standard of care 
group). 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition calories 
At Week 12, there was a -35.11% (±53.04) mean change from baseline in parenteral nutrition calorie 
consumption in the ITT population based on physician-prescribed data. The corresponding change in 
the standard of care cohort was 4.31% (±5.36). At Week 16, the parenteral nutrition calories 
consumption continued to decrease with percentage mean changes from baseline of -39.15% (±39.08) 
compared to -0.87% (±9.25) for the standard of care cohort. 
Increases in enteral nutrition volume and enteral calories 
Based on prescribed data, the mean percentage change from baseline at Week 12 in enteral volume, in 
the ITT population, was 25.82% (±41.59) compared to 53.65% (±57.01) in the standard of care cohort. 
The corresponding increase in enteral calories was 58.80% (±64.20), compared to 57.02% (±55.25) in 
the standard of care cohort. 
Reduction in infusion time 
The mean decrease from baseline at Week 12 in the number of days/week on parenteral nutrition, in 
the ITT population based on physician-prescribed data, was -1.36 (±2.37) days/week corresponding to 
a percentage decrease of -24.49% (±42.46). There was no change from baseline in the standard of care 
cohort. Four subjects (26.7%) on the recommended teduglutide dose achieved at least a three-day 
reduction in parenteral nutrition needs. 
At Week 12, based on subject diary data, subjects showed mean percentage reductions of 
35.55% (±35.23) hours per day compared to baseline, which corresponded to reductions in the 
hours/day of parenteral nutrition usage of -4.18 (±4.08), while subjects in the standard of care cohort 
showed minimal change in this parameter at the same time point. 
An additional 24-week, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study was conducted in 59 paediatric 
subjects aged 1 year through 17 years who were dependent on parenteral support. The objective was to 
evaluate safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of teduglutide. Two doses of teduglutide 
were studied: 0.025 mg/kg/day (n=24) and 0.05 mg/kg/day (n=26); 9 subjects were enrolled in a 
standard of care (SOC) arm. Randomisation was stratified by age across dose groups. Results below 
correspond to the ITT population at the recommended dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day. 
Complete weaning 
Three (3) paediatric subjects in the 0.05 mg/kg group achieved the additional endpoint of enteral 
autonomy by week 24. 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition volume 
Based on subject diary data, 18 (69.2%) subjects in the 0.05 mg/kg/day group achieved the primary 
endpoint of ≥ 20% reduction in PN/IV volume at end of treatment, compared to baseline; in the SOC 
arm, 1 (11.1%) subject achieved this endpoint. 
The mean change in parenteral nutrition volume from baseline at Week 24, based on subject diary 
data, was -23.30 (±17.50) ml/kg/day, corresponding to -41.57% (±28.90); the mean change in the SOC 
arm was -6.03 (±4.5) ml/kg/day (corresponding to a -10.21% [±13.59]). 
Reduction in infusion time 
At week 24, there was a decrease in the infusion time of -3.03 (±3.84) hours/day in the 0.05 mg/kg/day 
arm, corresponding to a percentage change of -26.09% (±36.14). The change from baseline in the SOC 
cohort was -0.21 (±0.69) hours/day (-1.75% [±5.89]). 
The mean decrease from baseline at Week 24 in the number of days/week on parenteral nutrition, 
based on subject diary data, was -1.34 (±2.24) days/week corresponding to a percentage decrease 
of -21.33% (±34.09). There was no reduction in PN/IV infusion days per week in the SOC arm.

Adults 
Teduglutide was studied in 17 patients with SBS allocated to five treatment groups using doses 
of 0.03, 0.10 or 0.15 mg/kg teduglutide once daily, or 0.05 or 0.075 mg/kg bid in a 21-day open-label, 
multicenter, dose-ranging study. Treatment resulted in enhanced gastrointestinal fluid absorption of 
approximately 750-1000 ml/day with improvements in the absorption of macronutrients and 
electrolytes, decreased stomal or faecal fluid and macronutrients excretion, and enhanced key 
structural and functional adaptations in the intestinal mucosa. Structural adaptations were transient in 
nature and returned to baseline levels within three weeks of discontinuing the treatment. 
In the pivotal phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with SBS, who required 
parenteral nutrition, 43 patients were randomised to a 0.05 mg/kg/day dose of teduglutide and 
43 patients to placebo for up to 24 weeks. 
The proportion of teduglutide-treated subjects achieving a 20% to 100% reduction of parenteral 
nutrition at Week 20 and 24 was statistically significantly different from placebo (27 out of 
43 subjects, 62.8% versus 13 out of 43 patients, 30.2%, p=0.002). Treatment with teduglutide resulted 
in a 4.4 l/week reduction in parenteral nutrition requirements (from a pre-treatment baseline of 
12.9 litres) versus 2.3 l/week (from a pre-treatment baseline of 13.2 litres) for placebo at 24 weeks. 
Twenty-one (21) patients treated with teduglutide (48.8%) versus 9 on placebo (20.9%) achieved at 
least a one day reduction in parenteral nutrition administration (p=0.008). 
Ninety-seven percent (97%) of patients (37 out of 39 patients treated with teduglutide) that completed 
the placebo-controlled study entered a long-term extension study where all patients received 
0.05 mg/kg of Revestive daily for up to an additional 2 years. In total 88 patients participated in this 
extension study, thereof 39 treated with placebo and 12 enrolled, but not randomised, in the previous 
study; 65 of 88 patients completed the extension study. There continued to be evidence of increased 
response to treatment for up 2.5 years in all groups exposed to teduglutide in terms of parenteral 
nutrition volume reduction, gaining additional days off parenteral nutrition per week, and achieving 
weaning of parenteral support. 
Thirty (30) of the 43 teduglutide-treated patients from the pivotal study who entered the extension 
study completed a total of 30 months of treatment. Of these, 28 patients (93%) achieved a 20% or 
greater reduction of parenteral support. Of responders in the pivotal study who completed the 
extension study, 21 out of 22 (96%) sustained their response to teduglutide after an additional 2 years 
of continuous treatment. 
The mean reduction in parenteral nutrition (n=30) was 7.55 l/week (a 65.6% reduction from baseline). 
Ten (10) subjects were weaned off their parenteral support while on teduglutide treatment for 30 
months. Subjects were maintained on teduglutide even if no longer requiring parenteral nutrition. 
These 10 subjects had required parenteral nutrition support for 1.2 to 15.5 years, and prior to treatment 
with teduglutide had required between 3.5 l/week and 13.4 l/week of parenteral nutrition support. At 
the end of study, 21 (70%), 18 (60%) and 18 (60%) of the 30 completers achieved a reduction of 1, 2, 
or 3 days per week in parenteral support, respectively. 
Of the 39 placebo subjects, 29 completed 24 months of treatment with teduglutide. The mean 
reduction in parenteral nutrition was 3.11 l/week (an additional 28.3% reduction). Sixteen (16, 55.2%) 
of the 29 completers achieved a 20% or greater reduction of parenteral nutrition. At the end of study, 
14 (48.3%), 7 (24.1%) and 5 (17.2%) patients achieved a reduction of 1, 2, or 3 days per week in 
parenteral nutrition, respectively. Two (2) subjects were weaned off their parenteral support while on 
teduglutide. 
Of the 12 subjects not randomised in the pivotal study, 6 completed 24 months of treatment with 
teduglutide. The mean reduction in parenteral nutrition was 4.0 l/week (39.4% reduction from baseline 
– the start of the extension study) and 4 of the 6 completers (66.7%) achieved a 20% or greater 
reduction in parenteral support. At the end of study, 3 (50%), 2 (33%) and 2 (33%) achieved a 
reduction of 1, 2, or 3 days per week in parenteral nutrition, respectively. One subject was weaned off 
their parenteral support while on teduglutide. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In another phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with SBS, who required 
parenteral nutrition, patients received a 0.05 mg/kg/day dose (n=35), a 0.10 mg/kg/day dose (n=32) of 
teduglutide or placebo (n=16) for up to 24 weeks. 
The primary efficacy analysis of the study results showed no statistically significant difference 
between the group on teduglutide 0.10 mg/kg/day and the placebo group, while the proportion of 
subjects receiving the recommended teduglutide dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day achieving at least a 20% 
reduction of parenteral nutrition at Week 20 and 24 was statistically significantly different versus 
placebo (46% versus 6.3%, p <0.01). Treatment with teduglutide resulted in a 2.5 l/week reduction in 
parenteral nutrition requirements (from a pre-treatment baseline of 9.6 litres) versus 0.9 l/week (from a 
pre-treatment baseline of 10.7 litres) for placebo at 24 weeks. 
Teduglutide treatment induced expansion of the absorptive epithelium by significantly increasing 
villus height in the small intestine. 
Sixty-five (65) patients entered a follow-up SBS study for up to an additional 28 weeks of treatment. 
Patients on teduglutide maintained their previous dose assignment throughout the extension phase, 
while placebo patients were randomised to active treatment, either 0.05 or 0.10 mg/kg/day. 
Of the patients who achieved at least a 20% reduction of parenteral nutrition at Weeks 20 and 24 in the 
initial study, 75% sustained this response on teduglutide after up to 1 year of continuous treatment. 
The mean reduction of weekly parenteral nutrition volume was 4.9 l/week (52% reduction from 
baseline) after one year of continuous teduglutide treatment. 
Two (2) patients on the recommended teduglutide dose were weaned off parenteral nutrition by 
Week 24. One additional patient in the follow-up study was weaned off parenteral nutrition. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Revestive in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of SBS (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Teduglutide was rapidly absorbed from subcutaneous injection sites with maximum plasma levels 
occurring approximately 3-5 hours after dose administration at all dose levels. The absolute 
bioavailability of subcutaneous teduglutide is high (88%). No accumulation of teduglutide was 
observed following repeated subcutaneous administration. 
Distribution 
Following subcutaneous administration, teduglutide has an apparent volume of distribution of 26 litres 
in patients with SBS. 
Biotransformation 
The metabolism of teduglutide is not fully known. Since teduglutide is a peptide it is likely that it 
follows the principal mechanism for peptide metabolism. 
Elimination 
Teduglutide has a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. Following intravenous 
administration teduglutide plasma clearance was approximately 127 ml/hr/kg which is equivalent to 
the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Renal elimination was confirmed in a study investigating 
pharmacokinetics in subjects with renal impairment. No accumulation of teduglutide was observed 
following repeated subcutaneous administrations. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dose linearity 
The rate and extent of absorption of teduglutide is dose-proportional at single and repeated 
subcutaneous doses up to 20 mg. 
Pharmacokinetics in subpopulations 
Paediatric population 
Following subcutaneous administration, similar Cmax of teduglutide, driving the efficacy responses, 
across age groups (4 months corrected by gestational age to 17 years) was demonstrated by population 
pharmacokinetics modelling based on PK samples collected in the population following SC 
0.05 mg/kg daily dose. However, lower exposure (AUC) and shorter half-life were seen in paediatric 
patients 4 months to 17 years of age, as compared with adults. The pharmacokinetic profile of 
Revestive in this paediatric population, as evaluated by clearance and volume of distribution, was 
different from that observed in adults after correcting for body weights. Specifically, clearance 
decreases with increasing age from 4 months to adults. No data are available for paediatric patients 
with moderate to severe renal impairment and endstage renal disease (ESRD). 
Gender 
No clinically relevant gender differences were observed in clinical studies. 
Elderly 
In a phase 1 study no difference in pharmacokinetics of teduglutide could be detected between healthy 
subjects younger than 65 years versus older than 65 years. Experience in subjects 75 years and above 
is limited. 
Hepatic impairment 
In a phase 1 study the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of teduglutide following 
subcutaneous administration of 20 mg teduglutide was investigated. The maximum exposure and the 
overall extent of exposure to teduglutide following single 20 mg subcutaneous doses were lower 
(10-15%) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment relative to those in healthy matched controls. 
Renal impairment 
In a phase 1 study, the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of teduglutide following 
subcutaneous administration of 10 mg teduglutide was investigated. With progressive renal 
impairment up to and including end-stage renal disease the primary pharmacokinetic parameters of 
teduglutide increased up to a factor of 2.6 (AUCinf) and 2.1 (Cmax) compared to healthy subjects. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Hyperplasia in the gall bladder, hepatic biliary ducts, and pancreatic ducts were observed in 
subchronic and chronic toxicology studies. These observations were potentially associated with the 
expected intended pharmacology of teduglutide and were to a varying degree reversible within an 
8-13 week recovery period following chronic administration. 
Injection site reactions 
In pre-clinical studies, severe granulomatous inflammations were found associated with the injection 
sites. 
Carcinogenicity / mutagenicity 
Teduglutide was negative when tested in the standard battery of tests for genotoxicity. 
In a rat carcinogenicity study, treatment related benign neoplasms included tumours of the bile duct 
epithelium in males exposed to teduglutide plasma levels approximately 32- and 155-fold higher than 
obtained in patients administered the recommended daily dose (incidence of 1 out of 44 and 4 out 
of 48, respectively). Adenomas of the jejunal mucosa were observed in 1 out of 50 males and 5 out of 
50 males exposed to teduglutide plasma levels approximately 10- and 155-fold higher than obtained in 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients administered the recommended daily dose. In addition, a jejunal adenocarcinoma was 
observed in a male rat administered the lowest dose tested (animal: human plasma exposure margin of 
approximately 10-fold). 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies evaluating teduglutide have been carried out in rats 
and rabbits at doses of 0, 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day subcutaneously. Teduglutide was not associated with 
effects on reproductive performance, in utero or developmental parameters measured in studies to 
investigate fertility, embryo-foetal development and pre- and post-natal development. 
Pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that the teduglutide exposure of foetal rabbits and suckling rat 
pups was very low.

patients is provided in section 4.2. 
The pre-filled syringe must be assembled with a reconstitution needle. 
The powder in the vial must then be dissolved by adding all the solvent from the pre-filled syringe. 
The vial should not be shaken, but can be rolled between the palms and gently turned upside-down 
once. Once a clear colourless solution is formed in the vial, the solution should be sucked up into a 
1 ml injection syringe (or 0.5 ml or smaller injection syringe for paediatric use) with scale intervals of 
0.02 ml or smaller (not included in the pack). 
If two vials are needed, the procedure for the second vial must be repeated and the additional solution 
sucked up into the injection syringe containing the solution from the first vial. Any volume exceeding 
the prescribed dose in ml must be expelled and discarded. 
The solution must be injected subcutaneously into a cleaned area on the abdomen, or if this is not 
possible, on the thigh (see section 4.2 Method of administration) using a thin needle for subcutaneous

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Revestive is indicated for the treatment of patients 4 months corrected gestational age and above with 
Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS). Patients should be stable following a period of intestinal adaptation 
after surgery. 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a medical professional with experience in the 
treatment of SBS. 
Treatment should not be initiated until it is reasonable to assume that a patient is stable following a 
period of intestinal adaptation. Optimisation and stabilisation of intravenous fluid and nutrition 
support should be performed before initiation of treatment. 
Clinical assessment by the physician should consider individual treatment objectives and patient 
preferences. Treatment should be stopped if no overall improvement of the patient condition is 
achieved. Efficacy and safety in all patients should be closely monitored on an ongoing basis 
according to clinical treatment guidelines. 
Posology 
Adults 
The recommended dose of Revestive is 0.05 mg/kg body weight once daily. The injection volume per 
body weight is provided below in Table 1. Due to the heterogeneity of the SBS population, a carefully 
monitored down-titration of the daily dose may be considered for some patients to optimise tolerability 
of the treatment. If a dose is missed, that dose should be injected as soon as possible on that day. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment effect should be evaluated after 6 months. Limited data from clinical studies have shown 
that some patients may take longer to respond to treatment (i.e., those who still have presence of 
colon-in-continuity or distal/terminal ileum); if no overall improvement is achieved after 12 months, 
the need for continued treatment should be reconsidered. 
Continued treatment is recommended for patients who have weaned off parenteral nutrition.

Paediatric population (aged 4 months to less than 12 months). 
For paediatric patients aged 4 months to less than 12 months, Revestive 1.25 mg vial should be used. 
Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of Revestive 1.25 mg powder and solvent for 
solution for injection for dosing information. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients above the age of 65 years. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for adult or paediatric patients with mild renal impairment. In adult or 
paediatric patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 
50 ml/min), and end-stage renal disease, the daily dose should be reduced by 50% (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment based on a 
study conducted in Child-Pugh grade B subjects. Revestive has not been studied in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population (< 4 months) 
There are currently no available data in children below 4 months corrected gestational age. 
Method of administration 
The reconstituted solution should be administered by subcutaneous injection once daily, alternating 
sites between 1 of the 4 quadrants of the abdomen. In case the injection into the abdomen is hampered 
by pain, scarring or hardening of the tissue, the thigh can also be used. Revestive should not be 
administered intravenously or intramuscularly. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or trace 
residues of tetracycline. 
Active or suspected malignancy. 
Patients with a history of malignancies in the gastrointestinal tract, including the hepatobiliary system 
and pancreas within the last five years. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
It is strongly recommended that every time Revestive is administered to a patient, the name and lot 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the lot of the 
product.

Adults 
Colo-rectal polyps 
A colonoscopy with removal of polyps should be performed at the time of starting treatment with 
Revestive. Once yearly follow-up colonoscopies (or alternate imaging) are recommended during the 
first 2 years of Revestive treatment. Subsequent colonoscopies are recommended at a minimum of 
five year intervals. An individual assessment whether increased frequency of surveillance is necessary 
should be performed based on the patient characteristics (e.g., age, underlying disease). See also 
section 5.1. If a polyp is found, adherence to current polyp follow-up guidelines is recommended. In 
case of malignancy, Revestive therapy must be discontinued (see section 4.3). 
Gastrointestinal neoplasia including hepatobiliary tract 
In the rat carcinogenicity study, benign tumours were found in the small bowel and the extrahepatic 
bile ducts. These observations were not confirmed in clinical studies of more than one year duration. If 
a neoplasia is detected, it should be removed. In case of malignancy, Revestive treatment must be 
discontinued (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). 
Gallbladder and bile ducts 
Cases of cholecystitis, cholangitis, and cholelithiasis have been reported in clinical studies. In case of 
gallbladder or bile duct-related symptoms, the need for continued Revestive treatment should be 
reassessed. 
Pancreatic diseases 
Pancreatic adverse events such as chronic and acute pancreatitis, pancreatic duct stenosis, pancreas 
infection and increased blood amylase and lipase have been reported in clinical studies. In case of 
pancreatic adverse events, the need for continued Revestive treatment should be reassessed. 
Monitoring of small bowel, gallbladder and bile ducts, and pancreas 
SBS patients are to be kept under close surveillance according to clinical treatment guidelines. This 
usually includes the monitoring of small bowel function, gallbladder and bile ducts, and pancreas for 
signs and symptoms, and, if indicated, additional laboratory investigations and appropriate imaging 
techniques. 
Intestinal obstruction 
Cases of intestinal obstruction have been reported in clinical studies. In case of recurrent intestinal 
obstructions, the need for continued Revestive treatment should be reassessed. 
Fluid overload and Electrolyte Balance 
To avoid fluid overload or dehydration, careful adjustment of parenteral support is required in patients 
taking Revestive. Electrolyte balance and fluid status should be carefully monitored throughout 
treatment, especially during initial therapeutic response and discontinuation of Revestive treatment  
Fluid overload: 
Fluid overload has been observed in clinical trials. Fluid overload adverse events occurred most 
frequently during the first 4 weeks of therapy and decreased over time. 
Due to increased fluid absorption, patients with cardiovascular disease, such as cardiac insufficiency 
and hypertension, should be monitored with regard to fluid overload, especially during initiation of 
therapy. Patients should be advised to contact their physician in case of sudden weight gain, face 
swelling, swollen ankles and/or dyspnoea. In general, fluid overload can be prevented by appropriate 
and timely assessment of parenteral nutrition needs. This assessment should be conducted more 
frequently within the first months of treatment. 
Congestive heart failure has been observed in clinical trials. In case of a significant deterioration of the 
cardiovascular disease, the need for continued treatment with Revestive should be reassessed. 
Dehydration: 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with SBS are susceptible to dehydration that may lead to acute renal failure.  
In patients receiving Revestive, parenteral support should be reduced carefully and should not be 
discontinued abruptly. The patient’s fluid status should be evaluated following parenteral support 
reduction and corresponding adjustment performed, as needed. 
Concomitant medicinal products 
Patients receiving oral concomitant medicinal products requiring titration or with a narrow therapeutic 
index should be monitored closely due to potential increased absorption (see section 4.5). 
Special clinical conditions 
Revestive has not been studied in patients with severe, clinically unstable concomitant diseases, (e.g., 
cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, infectious, endocrine, hepatic, or CNS), or in patients with 
malignancies within the last five years (see section 4.3). Caution should be exercised when prescribing 
Revestive. 
Hepatic impairment 
Revestive has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The data from use in 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment do not suggest a need for restricted use. 
Discontinuation of treatment 
Due to the risk of dehydration, discontinuation of treatment with Revestive should be managed 
carefully. 
Paediatric population 
See also general precautions for adults under this section. 
Colo-rectal polyps/Neoplasia 
Prior to initiating treatment with Revestive, faecal occult blood testing should be done for all children 
and adolescents. Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy is required if there is evidence of unexplained blood in 
the stool. Subsequent faecal occult blood testing should be done annually in children and adolescents 
while they are receiving Revestive. 
Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy is recommended for all children and adolescents after one year of 
treatment, every 5 years thereafter while on continuous treatment with Revestive, and if they have new 
or unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Excipients 
Revestive contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Caution is needed when administering Revestive to persons with a known hypersensitivity to 
tetracycline (see section 4.3). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. An in vitro study 
indicates that teduglutide does not inhibit cytochrome P450 drug metabolising enzymes. Based upon 
the pharmacodynamic effect of teduglutide, there is a potential for increased absorption of 
concomitant medicinal products (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of Revestive in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct 
or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Revestive during pregnancy. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether teduglutide is excreted in human milk. In rats, mean teduglutide concentration 
in milk was less than 3% of the maternal plasma concentration following a single subcutaneous 
injection of 25 mg/kg. A risk to the breast-fed newborn/infant cannot be excluded. As a precautionary 
measure it is preferable to avoid the use of Revestive during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of teduglutide on human fertility. Animal data do not indicate any 
impairment of fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Revestive has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, cases of syncope 
have been reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Such events might impact the ability to drive 
and use machines. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse reactions were retrieved from 2 placebo-controlled clinical studies with teduglutide in 
109 patients with SBS treated with doses of 0.05 mg/kg/day and 0.10 mg/kg/day for up to 24 weeks. 
Approximately 52% of the patients treated with teduglutide experienced adverse reactions (versus 
36% of the patients given placebo). The most commonly reported adverse reactions were abdominal 
pain and distension (45%), respiratory tract infections (28%) (including nasopharyngitis, influenza, 
upper respiratory tract infection, and lower respiratory tract infection), nausea (26%), injection site 
reactions (26%), headache (16%), and vomiting (14%). Approximately 38% of the treated patients 
with a stoma experienced gastrointestinal stoma complications. The majority of these reactions were 
mild or moderate. 
No new safety signals have been identified in patients exposed to 0.05 mg/kg/day of teduglutide for up 
to 30 months in a long-term open-label extension study.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immunogenicity 
Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing peptides, 
administration of Revestive may potentially trigger the development of antibodies. Based on 
integrated data from two trials in adults with SBS (a 6-month randomised placebo-controlled trial, 
followed by a 24-month open-label trial), the development of anti-teduglutide antibodies in subjects 
who received subcutaneous administration of 0.05 mg/kg teduglutide once daily was 3% (2/60) at 
Month 3, 17% (13/77) at Month 6, 24% (16/67) at Month 12, 33% (11/33) at Month 24, and 
48% (14/29) at Month 30. In phase 3 studies with SBS patients who received teduglutide for ≥2 years, 
28% of patients developed antibodies against E. coli protein (residual host cell protein from the 
manufacture). The antibody formation has not been associated with clinically relevant safety findings, 
reduced efficacy or changed pharmacokinetics of Revestive. 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions occurred in 26% of SBS patients treated with teduglutide, compared to 5% of 
patients in the placebo arm. The reactions included injection site haematoma, injection site erythema, 
injection site pain, injection site swelling and injection site haemorrhage (see also section 5.3). The 
majority of reactions were moderate in severity and no occurrences led to drug discontinuation. 
C-reactive protein 
Modest increases of C-reactive protein of approximately 25 mg/l have been observed within the first 
seven days of teduglutide treatment, which decreased continuously under ongoing daily injections. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment, patients showed small overall increase in C-reactive protein 
of approximately 1.5 mg/l on average. These changes were neither associated with any changes in 
other laboratory parameters nor with any reported clinical symptoms. There were no clinically relevant 
mean increases of C-reactive protein from baseline following long-term treatment with teduglutide for 
up to 30 months. 
Paediatric population 
In two completed clinical trials, there were 87 paediatric subjects (aged 1 to 17 years) enrolled and 
exposed to teduglutide for a duration of up to 6 months. No subject discontinued the studies due to an 
adverse event. Overall, the safety profile of teduglutide (including type and frequency of adverse 
reactions, and immunogenicity) in children and adolescents (ages 1-17 years) was similar to that in 
adults. 
In three completed clinical studies in paediatric subjects (aged 4 to < 12 months corrected gestational 
age), the safety profile reported in these studies was consistent with the safety profile seen in the 
previous paediatric studies and no new safety issues were identified. 
Limited long-term safety data is available for the paediatric population. No data are available for 
children under 4 months of age. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The maximum dose of teduglutide studied during clinical development was 86 mg/day for 8 days. No 
unexpected systemic adverse reactions were seen (see section 4.8). 
In the event of an overdose, the patient should be carefully monitored by the medical professional.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, various alimentary tract 
and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX08. 
Mechanism of action 
The naturally occurring human glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a peptide secreted by L cells of the 
intestine which is known to increase intestinal and portal blood flow, inhibit gastric acid secretion, and 
decrease intestinal motility. Teduglutide is an analogue of GLP-2. In several nonclinical studies, 
teduglutide has been shown to preserve mucosal integrity by promoting repair and normal growth of 
the intestine through an increase of villus height and crypt depth. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Similar to GLP-2, teduglutide is 33 amino acids in length with an amino acid substitution of alanine by 
glycine at the second position of the N-terminus. The single amino acid substitution relative to 
naturally occurring GLP-2 results in resistance to in vivo degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl 
peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), resulting in an extended half-life. Teduglutide increases villus height and 
crypt depth of the intestinal epithelium. 
Based on the findings derived from pre-clinical studies (see sections 4.4 and 5.3) and the proposed 
mechanism of action with the trophic effects on intestinal mucosa, there appears to be a risk for the 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
promotion of small intestinal and/or colonic neoplasia. The clinical studies conducted could neither 
exclude nor confirm such an increased risk. Several cases of benign colorectal polyps occurred during 
the course of the trials, however, the frequency was not increased compared to placebo-treated 
patients. In addition to the need for a colonoscopy with removal of polyps by the time of the initiation 
of the treatment (see section 4.4.), every patient should be assessed for the need of an enhanced 
surveillance schedule based on the patient characteristics (e.g., age and underlying disease, previous 
occurrence of polyps etc.). 
Clinical efficacy 
Paediatric population 
Paediatric 4 months to less than 12 months of age 
The efficacy data presented are derived from 1 controlled and 1 un-controlled core studies for a 28-
week duration, and 2 extension studies for up to 9 cycles (24 weeks per cycle) of teduglutide 
treatment. These studies included infants 4 months to < 12 months corrected gestational age: 
10 infants (2 infants aged 4 to < 6 months, 8 aged 6 to < 12 months) in the controlled study (5 in 
teduglutide treatment arm and 5 in standard of care arm), 2 infants in the un-controlled study (both 
treated). From the core controlled study, 6 of the 10 infants completed the study, and continued in the 
extension study (5 treated and 1 non-treated). From the core uncontrolled study, 2 infants completed 
the study and continued in the second extension study (both treated). The infants in these studies were 
treated with teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/day. Despite the limited sample size in the core and extension 
studies, clinically meaningful numerical reductions in the requirement for parenteral support were 
observed. 
The controlled core study  
Complete weaning 
No subject achieved enteral autonomy, i.e., complete weaning off PS during either core or extension 
studies. 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition volume 
In the controlled core study, based on subject diary data, 3 (60.0%) subjects enrolled in the TED arm 
and 1 (20.0%) subject in the SOC arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS volume at end of 
treatment (EOT) from baseline (2 subjects in the SOC arm had missing data). In the TED arm, the 
mean change in PS volume at EOT from baseline was -21.5±28.91 ml/kg/day (-24.8%). In the SOC 
arm, the mean change in PS volume at EOT from baseline was -9.5±7.50 ml/kg/day (-16.8%). 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition calories 
In the controlled core study, based on subject diary data, the mean percentage change in PS caloric 
intake at EOT from baseline was -27.0±29.47% for subjects in the TED arm and -13.7±21.87% in the 
SOC arm. 
Reduction in infusion time 
In the controlled core study, in the TED arm, the change in diary PS infusion time at EOT from 
baseline was -3.1±3.31 hours/day (-28.9%) and -1.9±2.01 days/week (-28.5%). In the SOC arm, the 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
change in diary PS infusion time at EOT from baseline was -0.3±0.63 hours/day (-1.9%) and no 
change was observed on the days per week of PS infusion time. 
The un-controlled core study 
Complete weaning 
No infant subjects reached complete weaning. 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition volume 
Among the 2 infants included in and completed the study, a ≥20% reduction in PS volume was 
recorded in 1 infant during the teduglutide treatment. The mean change in PS volume at EOT from 
baseline was -26.2±13.61 ml/kg/day (-26.7%). 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition calories 
In infants, the mean change in PS caloric intake at EOT from baseline was -13.8±3.17 kcal/kg/day (-
25.7%). 
Reduction in infusion time 
There was no change in daily PS usage hours in the 2 infants during the study. 
Paediatric population between 1 and 17 years of age 
The efficacy data presented are derived from 2 controlled studies in paediatric patients up to 24 weeks 
duration. These studies included 101 patients in the following age groups: 5 patients 1-2 years, 
56 patients 2 to < 6 years, 32 patients 6 to < 12 years, 7 patients 12 to < 17 years, and 1 patient 17 to 
< 18 years. Despite the limited sample size, which did not allow meaningful statistical comparisons, 
clinically meaningful, numerical reductions in the requirement for parenteral support were observed 
across all age groups. 
Teduglutide was studied in a 12-week, open-label, clinical study in 42 paediatric subjects aged 1 year 
through 14 years with SBS who were dependent on parenteral nutrition. The objectives of the study 
were to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of teduglutide compared to standard of care. Three 
(3) doses of teduglutide, 0.0125 mg/kg/day (n=8), 0.025 mg/kg/day (n=14), and 0.05 mg/kg/day 
(n=15), were investigated for 12 weeks. Five (5) subjects were enrolled in a standard of care cohort. 
Complete weaning 
Three subjects (3/15, 20%) on the recommended teduglutide dose were weaned off parenteral nutrition 
by Week 12. After a 4-week washout period, two of these patients had reinitiated parenteral nutrition 
support. 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition volume 
The mean change in parenteral nutrition volume from baseline at Week 12 in the ITT population, 
based on physician-prescribed data, was -2.57 (±3.56) l/week, correlating to a -39.11% (±40.79) mean 
decrease, compared to 0.43 (±0.75) l/week, correlating to a 7.38% (±12.76) increase in the standard of 
care cohort. At Week 16 (4 weeks following the end of treatment) parenteral nutrition volume 
reductions were still evident but less than observed at Week 12 when subjects were still on teduglutide 
(mean decrease of -31.80% (±39.26) compared to a 3.92% (±16.62) increase in the standard of care 
group). 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition calories 
At Week 12, there was a -35.11% (±53.04) mean change from baseline in parenteral nutrition calorie 
consumption in the ITT population based on physician-prescribed data. The corresponding change in 
the standard of care cohort was 4.31% (±5.36). At Week 16, the parenteral nutrition calories 
consumption continued to decrease with percentage mean changes from baseline of -39.15% (±39.08) 
compared to -0.87% (±9.25) for the standard of care cohort. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Increases in enteral nutrition volume and enteral calories 
Based on prescribed data, the mean percentage change from baseline at Week 12 in enteral volume, in 
the ITT population, was 25.82% (±41.59) compared to 53.65% (±57.01) in the standard of care cohort. 
The corresponding increase in enteral calories was 58.80% (±64.20), compared to 57.02% (±55.25) in 
the standard of care cohort. 
Reduction in infusion time 
The mean decrease from baseline at Week 12 in the number of days/week on parenteral nutrition, in 
the ITT population based on physician-prescribed data, was -1.36 (±2.37) days/week corresponding to 
a percentage decrease of -24.49% (±42.46). There was no change from baseline in the standard of care 
cohort. Four subjects (26.7%) on the recommended teduglutide dose achieved at least a three-day 
reduction in parenteral nutrition needs. 
At Week 12, based on subject diary data, subjects showed mean percentage reductions of 
35.55% (±35.23) hours per day compared to baseline, which corresponded to reductions in the 
hours/day of parenteral nutrition usage of -4.18 (±4.08), while subjects in the standard of care cohort 
showed minimal change in this parameter at the same time point. 
An additional 24-week, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study was conducted in 59 paediatric 
subjects aged 1 year through 17 years who were dependent on parenteral support. The objective was to 
evaluate safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of teduglutide. Two doses of teduglutide 
were studied: 0.025 mg/kg/day (n=24) and 0.05 mg/kg/day (n=26); 9 subjects were enrolled in a 
standard of care (SOC) arm. Randomisation was stratified by age across dose groups. Results below 
correspond to the ITT population at the recommended dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day. 
Complete weaning 
Three (3) paediatric subjects in the 0.05 mg/kg group achieved the additional endpoint of enteral 
autonomy by week 24. 
Reduction in parenteral nutrition volume 
Based on subject diary data, 18 (69.2%) subjects in the 0.05 mg/kg/day group achieved the primary 
endpoint of ≥ 20% reduction in PN/IV volume at end of treatment, compared to baseline; in the SOC 
arm, 1 (11.1%) subject achieved this endpoint. 
The mean change in parenteral nutrition volume from baseline at Week 24, based on subject diary 
data, was -23.30 (±17.50) ml/kg/day, corresponding to -41.57% (±28.90); the mean change in the SOC 
arm was -6.03 (±4.5) ml/kg/day (corresponding to a -10.21% [±13.59]). 
Reduction in infusion time 
At week 24, there was a decrease in the infusion time of -3.03 (±3.84) hours/day in the 0.05 mg/kg/day 
arm, corresponding to a percentage change of -26.09% (±36.14). The change from baseline in the SOC 
cohort was -0.21 (±0.69) hours/day (-1.75% [±5.89]). 
The mean decrease from baseline at Week 24 in the number of days/week on parenteral nutrition, 
based on subject diary data, was -1.34 (±2.24) days/week corresponding to a percentage decrease 
of -21.33% (±34.09). There was no reduction in PN/IV infusion days per week in the SOC arm. 
Adults 
Teduglutide was studied in 17 patients with SBS allocated to five treatment groups using doses 
of 0.03, 0.10 or 0.15 mg/kg teduglutide once daily, or 0.05 or 0.075 mg/kg bid in a 21-day open-label, 
multicenter, dose-ranging study. Treatment resulted in enhanced gastrointestinal fluid absorption of 
approximately 750-1000 ml/day with improvements in the absorption of macronutrients and 
electrolytes, decreased stomal or faecal fluid and macronutrients excretion, and enhanced key 
structural and functional adaptations in the intestinal mucosa. Structural adaptations were transient in 
nature and returned to baseline levels within three weeks of discontinuing the treatment. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the pivotal phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with SBS, who required 
parenteral nutrition, 43 patients were randomised to a 0.05 mg/kg/day dose of teduglutide and 
43 patients to placebo for up to 24 weeks. 
The proportion of teduglutide-treated subjects achieving a 20% to 100% reduction of parenteral 
nutrition at Week 20 and 24 was statistically significantly different from placebo (27 out of 
43 subjects, 62.8% versus 13 out of 43 patients, 30.2%, p=0.002). Treatment with teduglutide resulted 
in a 4.4 l/week reduction in parenteral nutrition requirements (from a pre-treatment baseline of 
12.9 litres) versus 2.3 l/week (from a pre-treatment baseline of 13.2 litres) for placebo at 24 weeks. 
Twenty-one (21) patients treated with teduglutide (48.8%) versus 9 on placebo (20.9%) achieved at 
least a one day reduction in parenteral nutrition administration (p=0.008). 
Ninety-seven percent (97%) of patients (37 out of 39 patients treated with teduglutide) that completed 
the placebo-controlled study entered a long-term extension study where all patients received 
0.05 mg/kg of Revestive daily for up to an additional 2 years. In total 88 patients participated in this 
extension study, thereof 39 treated with placebo and 12 enrolled, but not randomised, in the previous 
study; 65 of 88 patients completed the extension study. There continued to be evidence of increased 
response to treatment for up 2.5 years in all groups exposed to teduglutide in terms of parenteral 
nutrition volume reduction, gaining additional days off parenteral nutrition per week, and achieving 
weaning of parenteral support. 
Thirty (30) of the 43 teduglutide-treated patients from the pivotal study who entered the extension 
study completed a total of 30 months of treatment. Of these, 28 patients (93%) achieved a 20% or 
greater reduction of parenteral support. Of responders in the pivotal study who completed the 
extension study, 21 out of 22 (96%) sustained their response to teduglutide after an additional 2 years 
of continuous treatment. 
The mean reduction in parenteral nutrition (n=30) was 7.55 l/week (a 65.6% reduction from baseline). 
Ten (10) subjects were weaned off their parenteral support while on teduglutide treatment for 30 
months. Subjects were maintained on teduglutide even if no longer requiring parenteral nutrition. 
These 10 subjects had required parenteral nutrition support for 1.2 to 15.5 years, and prior to treatment 
with teduglutide had required between 3.5 l/week and 13.4 l/week of parenteral nutrition support. At 
the end of study, 21 (70%), 18 (60%) and 18 (60%) of the 30 completers achieved a reduction of 1, 2, 
or 3 days per week in parenteral support, respectively. 
Of the 39 placebo subjects, 29 completed 24 months of treatment with teduglutide. The mean 
reduction in parenteral nutrition was 3.11 l/week (an additional 28.3% reduction). Sixteen (16, 55.2%) 
of the 29 completers achieved a 20% or greater reduction of parenteral nutrition. At the end of study, 
14 (48.3%), 7 (24.1%) and 5 (17.2%) patients achieved a reduction of 1, 2, or 3 days per week in 
parenteral nutrition, respectively. Two (2) subjects were weaned off their parenteral support while on 
teduglutide. 
Of the 12 subjects not randomised in the pivotal study, 6 completed 24 months of treatment with 
teduglutide. The mean reduction in parenteral nutrition was 4.0 l/week (39.4% reduction from baseline 
– the start of the extension study) and 4 of the 6 completers (66.7%) achieved a 20% or greater 
reduction in parenteral support. At the end of study, 3 (50%), 2 (33%) and 2 (33%) achieved a 
reduction of 1, 2, or 3 days per week in parenteral nutrition, respectively. One subject was weaned off 
their parenteral support while on teduglutide. 
In another phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with SBS, who required 
parenteral nutrition, patients received a 0.05 mg/kg/day dose (n=35), a 0.10 mg/kg/day dose (n=32) of 
teduglutide or placebo (n=16) for up to 24 weeks. 
The primary efficacy analysis of the study results showed no statistically significant difference 
between the group on teduglutide 0.10 mg/kg/day and the placebo group, while the proportion of 
subjects receiving the recommended teduglutide dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day achieving at least a 20% 
reduction of parenteral nutrition at Week 20 and 24 was statistically significantly different versus 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
placebo (46% versus 6.3%, p< 0.01). Treatment with teduglutide resulted in a 2.5 l/week reduction in 
parenteral nutrition requirements (from a pre-treatment baseline of 9.6 litres) versus 0.9 l/week (from a 
pre-treatment baseline of 10.7 litres) for placebo at 24 weeks. 
Teduglutide treatment induced expansion of the absorptive epithelium by significantly increasing 
villus height in the small intestine. 
Sixty-five (65) patients entered a follow-up SBS study for up to an additional 28 weeks of treatment. 
Patients on teduglutide maintained their previous dose assignment throughout the extension phase, 
while placebo patients were randomised to active treatment, either 0.05 or 0.10 mg/kg/day. 
Of the patients who achieved at least a 20% reduction of parenteral nutrition at Weeks 20 and 24 in the 
initial study, 75% sustained this response on teduglutide after up to 1 year of continuous treatment. 
The mean reduction of weekly parenteral nutrition volume was 4.9 l/week (52% reduction from 
baseline) after one year of continuous teduglutide treatment. 
Two (2) patients on the recommended teduglutide dose were weaned off parenteral nutrition by 
Week 24. One additional patient in the follow-up study was weaned off parenteral nutrition. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Revestive in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of SBS (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Teduglutide was rapidly absorbed from subcutaneous injection sites with maximum plasma levels 
occurring approximately 3-5 hours after dose administration at all dose levels. The absolute 
bioavailability of subcutaneous teduglutide is high (88%). No accumulation of teduglutide was 
observed following repeated subcutaneous administration. 
Distribution 
Following subcutaneous administration, teduglutide has an apparent volume of distribution of 26 litres 
in patients with SBS. 
Biotransformation 
The metabolism of teduglutide is not fully known. Since teduglutide is a peptide it is likely that it 
follows the principal mechanism for peptide metabolism. 
Elimination 
Teduglutide has a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. Following intravenous 
administration teduglutide plasma clearance was approximately 127 ml/hr/kg which is equivalent to 
the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Renal elimination was confirmed in a study investigating 
pharmacokinetics in subjects with renal impairment. No accumulation of teduglutide was observed 
following repeated subcutaneous administrations. 
Dose linearity 
The rate and extent of absorption of teduglutide is dose-proportional at single and repeated 
subcutaneous doses up to 20 mg. 
Pharmacokinetics in subpopulations 
Paediatric population 
Following subcutaneous administration, similar Cmax of teduglutide driving the efficacy responses, 
across age groups (4 months corrected by gestational age to 17 years) was demonstrated by population 
pharmacokinetics modelling based on PK samples collected in the population following SC 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.05 mg/kg daily dose. However, lower exposure (AUC) and shorter half-life were seen in paediatric 
patients 4 months to 17 years of age, as compared with adults. The pharmacokinetic profile of 
Revestive in this paediatric population, as evaluated by clearance and volume of distribution, was 
different from that observed in adults after correcting for body weights. Specifically, clearance 
decreases with increasing age from 4 months to adults. No data are available for paediatric patients 
with moderate to severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 
Gender 
No clinically relevant gender differences were observed in clinical studies. 
Elderly 
In a phase 1 study no difference in pharmacokinetics of teduglutide could be detected between healthy 
subjects younger than 65 years versus older than 65 years. Experience in subjects 75 years and above 
is limited. 
Hepatic impairment 
In a phase 1 study the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of teduglutide following 
subcutaneous administration of 20 mg teduglutide was investigated. The maximum exposure and the 
overall extent of exposure to teduglutide following single 20 mg subcutaneous doses were lower 
(10-15%) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment relative to those in healthy matched controls. 
Renal impairment 
In a phase 1 study, the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of teduglutide following 
subcutaneous administration of 10 mg teduglutide was investigated. With progressive renal 
impairment up to and including end-stage renal disease the primary pharmacokinetic parameters of 
teduglutide increased up to a factor of 2.6 (AUCinf) and 2.1 (Cmax) compared to healthy subjects. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Hyperplasia in the gall bladder, hepatic biliary ducts, and pancreatic ducts were observed in 
subchronic and chronic toxicology studies. These observations were potentially associated with the 
expected intended pharmacology of teduglutide and were to a varying degree reversible within an 
8-13 week recovery period following chronic administration. 
Injection site reactions 
In pre-clinical studies, severe granulomatous inflammations were found associated with the injection 
sites. 
Carcinogenicity / mutagenicity 
Teduglutide was negative when tested in the standard battery of tests for genotoxicity. 
In a rat carcinogenicity study, treatment related benign neoplasms included tumours of the bile duct 
epithelium in males exposed to teduglutide plasma levels approximately 32- and 155-fold higher than 
obtained in patients administered the recommended daily dose (incidence of 1 out of 44 and 4 out 
of 48, respectively). Adenomas of the jejunal mucosa were observed in 1 out of 50 males and 5 out of 
50 males exposed to teduglutide plasma levels approximately 10- and 155-fold higher than obtained in 
patients administered the recommended daily dose. In addition, a jejunal adenocarcinoma was 
observed in a male rat administered the lowest dose tested (animal:human plasma exposure margin of 
approximately 10-fold). 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies evaluating teduglutide have been carried out in rats 
and rabbits at doses of 0, 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day subcutaneously. Teduglutide was not associated with 
effects on reproductive performance, in utero or developmental parameters measured in studies to 
investigate fertility, embryo-foetal development and pre- and post-natal development. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that the teduglutide exposure of foetal rabbits and suckling rat 
pups was very low.

syringes. 
Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Determination of the number of vials needed for administration of one dose must be based on the 
individual patient’s weight and the recommended dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day. The physician should at 
each visit weigh the patient, determine the daily dose to be administered until next visit and inform the 
patient accordingly. 
Tables with the injection volumes based on the recommended dose per body weight for both adults 
and paediatric patients are provided in section 4.2. 
The pre-filled syringe must be assembled with a reconstitution needle. 
The powder in the vial must then be dissolved by adding all the solvent from the pre-filled syringe. 
The vial should not be shaken, but can be rolled between the palms and gently turned upside-down 
once. Once a clear colourless solution is formed in the vial, the solution should be sucked up into a 
1 ml injection syringe (or 0.5 ml or smaller injection syringe for paediatric use) with scale intervals of 
0.02 ml or smaller (not included in the pack). 
If two vials are needed, the procedure for the second vial must be repeated and the additional solution 
sucked up into the injection syringe containing the solution from the first vial. Any volume exceeding 
the prescribed dose in ml must be expelled and discarded. 
The solution must be injected subcutaneously into a cleaned area on the abdomen, or if this is not 
possible, on the thigh (see section 4.2 Method of administration) using a thin needle for subcutaneous 
injection. 
Detailed instructions on the preparation and injection of Revestive are provided in the package leaflet. 
The solution must not be used if it is cloudy or contains particulate matter. 
For single use only. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
All needles and syringes should be disposed of in a sharps disposal container.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Revestive is and what it is used for 
Revestive contains the active substance teduglutide. It improves the absorption of nutrients and fluid 
from your child’s remaining gastrointestinal tract (gut). 
Revestive is used to treat children and adolescents (aged 4 months and above) with Short Bowel 
Syndrome. Short Bowel Syndrome is a disorder arising from an inability to absorb food nutrients and 
fluid across the gut. It is often caused by surgical removal of all or part of the small intestine. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Revestive 
Do not use Revestive 
- 
- 
- 
if your child is allergic to teduglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) or trace residues of tetracycline. 
if your child has or is suspected to have cancer. 
if your child has had cancer in the gastrointestinal tract, including liver, gallbladder or bile 
ducts, and pancreas within the last five years. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your child’s doctor before using Revestive: 
- 
if your child has severely decreased liver function. The doctor will consider this when 
prescribing this medicine. 
if your child suffers from certain cardiovascular diseases (affecting the heart and/or blood 
vessels) such as high blood pressure (hypertension) or has a weak heart (cardiac insufficiency). 
The signs and symptoms include sudden weight gain, face swelling, swollen ankles and/or 
shortness of breath. 
if your child has other severe diseases that are not well controlled. The doctor will consider this 
when prescribing this medicine. 
if your child has decreased kidney function. The doctor may need to give your child a lower 
dose of this medicine. 
- 
- 
- 
When starting and while getting treated with Revestive, the doctor may adjust the amount of 
intravenous fluids or nutrition your child receives. 
Medical check-ups before and during treatment with Revestive 
Before starting treatment with this medicine, your child will have a test done to see if there is blood in 
the stool. Your child will also have a colonoscopy done (a procedure to see inside their colon and 
rectum to check for the presence of polyps (small abnormal growths) and have them removed) if they 
have unexplained blood in their bowel movements (stools). If polyps are found before treatment with 
Revestive, the doctor will decide whether your child should use this medicine. Revestive should not be 
used if a cancer is detected during colonoscopy. The doctor will perform further colonoscopies if your 
child continues treatment with Revestive. The doctor will monitor your child’s body fluids and 
electrolytes as an imbalance may cause fluid overload or dehydration. 
The doctor will take special care and monitor your child’s small bowel function and monitor for signs 
and symptoms indicating problems with the gallbladder, bile ducts and pancreas. 
Children and adolescents 
Children below 4 months of age 
This medicine should not be used in children under 4 months of age. This is because there is limited 
experience with Revestive in this age group. 
Other medicines and Revestive 
Tell the doctor, pharmacist or nurse if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
Revestive may affect how other medicines are absorbed from the gut and therefore how well they 
work. The doctor may have to change your child’s dose of other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If your child is pregnant or breast-feeding, the use of Revestive is not recommended. 
If your child is pregnant or breast-feeding, may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask the 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before using this medicine. 
Driving, cycling and using machines 
This medicine may cause your child to feel dizzy. If this happens to your child, they should not drive, 
ride a bicycle or use machines until they feel better.

Important information about some of the ingredients in Revestive 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Caution is needed if your child is hypersensitive to tetracycline (see “Do not use Revestive” section). 
3. 
How to use Revestive 
Always use this medicine exactly as the doctor has told you. Check with your child’s doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
Dose 
The recommended daily dose for your child is 0.05 mg per kg body weight. The dose will be given 
in millilitres (ml) of solution. 
The doctor will choose the dose that is right for your child, depending on their body weight. The 
doctor will tell you which dose to inject. If you are not sure, ask the doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
How to use Revestive 
Revestive is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) once daily. The injection can be 
self-administered or given by another person, for example your child’s doctor, his/her assistant or your 
child’s home nurse. If you, or the carer, are injecting the medicine, you or the carer must receive 
adequate training by the doctor or nurse. You will find detailed instructions for injections at the end of 
this leaflet. 
It is strongly recommended that every time your child receives a dose of Revestive, the name and lot 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the lots used. 
If you use more Revestive than you should 
If you inject more Revestive than you are told to by your child’s doctor, you should contact the doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. 
If you forget to use Revestive 
If you forget to inject this medicine (or cannot inject it at the usual time), use it as soon as possible on 
that day. Never use more than one injection in the same day. Do not inject a double dose to make up 
for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Revestive 
Keep using this medicine for as long as your child’s doctor prescribes it for them. Do not stop using 
this medicine without consulting the doctor, as a sudden stop can cause changes in your child’s fluid 
balance. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child’s doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse.

Instructions for preparing and injecting Revestive 
Important information: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Read the Package Leaflet before using Revestive. 
Revestive is for injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). 
Do not inject Revestive into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). 
Keep Revestive out of the sight and reach of children. 
Do not use Revestive after the expiry date which is stated on the carton, the vial and the 
pre-filled syringe. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. 
Store in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). 
Do not freeze. 
After reconstitution, from a microbiological point of view, the solution should be used 
immediately. However, chemical and physical stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 
25ºC. 
Do not use Revestive if you notice that the solution is cloudy or contains particulate matter. 
Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist 
how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the 
environment. 
Dispose of all needles and syringes in a sharps disposal container. 
Materials provided in the pack: 
- 
- 
28 vials with 1.25 mg teduglutide as a powder 
28 pre-filled syringes with solvent 
Materials needed but not included in the pack: 
-  Reconstitution needles (size 22G, length 1½" (0.7 x 40 mm)) 
- 
0.5 or 1 ml injection syringes (with scale intervals of 0.02 ml or smaller). For children, a 0.5 ml 
(or smaller) injection syringe may be used 
-  Thin injection needles for subcutaneous injection (e.g., size 26G, length 5/8" (0.45 x 16 mm), or 
smaller needles for children, as appropriate) 
-  Alcohol wipes 
-  Alcohol swabs 
-  A puncture-proof container for safe disposal of the used syringes and needles 
NOTE: Before you start, make sure you have a clean work surface and that you have washed your 
hands before proceeding. 
1. 
Assemble the pre-filled syringe 
Once you have all the materials ready, you need to assemble the pre-filled syringe. The following 
procedure shows how you do this. 
1.1 
Take the pre-filled syringe with solvent and flip off the top part 
of the white plastic cap so that it is ready for the reconstitution needle to 
be attached. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Attach the reconstitution needle (22G, 1½" (0.7 x 40 mm)) to 
1.2 
the assembled pre-filled syringe by screwing it on in a clockwise 
direction. 
2. 
Dissolve the powder 
Now you are ready to dissolve the powder with the solvent. 
Remove the blue flip-off button from the powder vial, wipe the 
2.1 
top with an alcohol wipe and allow to dry. Do not touch the top of the 
vial. 
Uncap the reconstitution needle on the assembled pre-filled 
2.2 
syringe with solvent without touching the tip of the needle. 
2.3 
Taking the powder vial, insert the reconstitution needle 
attached to the assembled pre-filled syringe into the centre of the rubber 
stopper and gently push the plunger all the way down to inject all the 
solvent into the vial. 
Leave the reconstitution needle and empty syringe in the vial. 
2.4 
Let the vial rest for approximately 30 seconds. 
Gently roll the vial between your palms for about 15 seconds. 
2.5 
Then gently turn the vial upside-down once with the reconstitution 
needle and empty syringe still in the vial. 
NOTE: Do not shake the vial. Shaking the vial may produce foam, which makes it difficult to extract 
the solution from the vial. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.6 
Let the vial rest for about two minutes. 
Observe the vial for any undissolved powder. If any powder remains, repeat steps 2.5 and 2.6. 
2.7 
Do not shake the vial. If there is still some undissolved powder, discard the vial and start the 
preparation again from the beginning with a new vial. 
NOTE: The final solution should be clear. If the solution is cloudy or contains particulate matter, do 
not inject it. 
NOTE: Once prepared, the solution should be used immediately. It should be kept below 25°C and 
maximum storage time is twenty-four hours. 
3. 
Prepare the injection syringe 
Remove the reconstitution syringe from the reconstitution 
3.1 
needle which is still in the vial and discard the reconstitution syringe. 
Take the injection syringe and attach it to the reconstitution 
3.2 
needle which is still in the vial. 
Turn the vial upside down, slide the tip of the reconstitution 
3.3 
needle close to the stopper and allow all the medicine to fill the syringe 
by pulling the plunger back gently. 
NOTE: If your child’s doctor has told you that you need two vials, prepare a second pre-filled syringe 
with solvent and a second powder vial as shown in the main steps 1 and 2. Withdraw the solution from 
the second vial into the same injection syringe by repeating step 3. 
3.4 
Remove the injection syringe from reconstitution needle 
leaving the needle in the vial. Discard the vial and reconstitution needle 
together into the sharps disposal container. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.5 
Take the injection needle, but do not remove the plastic needle 
cap. Attach the needle to the injection syringe containing the medicine. 
Check for air bubbles. If air bubbles are present, gently tap the 
3.6 
syringe until they rise to the top. Then gently push up the plunger to 
expel the air. 
Your child’s dose in ml has been calculated by the doctor. 
3.7 
Expel any excessive volume from the syringe with the needle cap still 
on until your dose is reached. 
4. 
Inject the solution 
Find an area on your child’s belly, or if 
4.1 
they have pain or hardening of the tissue on 
their belly, on your child’s thigh where it is easy 
for you to give the injection (see the diagram). 
NOTE: Do not use the same area each day for each injection - rotate sites (use upper, lower, and left 
and right side of your child’s belly) to avoid discomfort. Avoid areas that are inflamed, swollen, 
scarred or covered by a mole, birthmark or other lesion. 
Clean the intended site of injection on your child’s skin with an 
4.2 
alcohol swab, using a circular motion, working outwards. Allow the 
area to air-dry. 
Remove the plastic cap from the needle of the prepared 
4.3 
injection syringe. Gently grasp the cleaned skin at the injection site 
with one hand. With the other hand, hold the syringe as you would with 
a pencil. Bend your wrist back and quickly insert the needle at a 
45° angle. 
Pull back the plunger slightly. If you see any blood in the syringe, withdraw the needle and 
4.4 
replace the needle on the injection syringe with a clean one of the same size. You can still use the 
medicine that is already in the syringe. Try to inject in another place in the cleaned skin area. 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inject the medicine slowly by pushing steadily on the plunger until all the medicine is injected 
4.5 
and the syringe is empty. 
4.6 
Pull the needle straight out of the skin and discard the needle and syringe together into the 
sharps disposal container. A small amount of bleeding may occur. If necessary, press gently on the 
injection site with an alcohol swab or 2x2 gauze until any bleeding has stopped. 
4.7 
Dispose all needles and syringes in a sharps disposal container or hard-walled container (for 
example, a detergent bottle with a lid). This container must be puncture proof (top and sides). If you 
need a sharps disposal container, please contact your child’s doctor.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Revestive is and what it is used for 
Revestive contains the active substance teduglutide. It improves the absorption of nutrients and fluid 
from your remaining gastrointestinal tract (gut). 
Revestive is used to treat adults, children and adolescents (aged 4 months and above) with Short 
Bowel Syndrome. Short Bowel Syndrome is a disorder arising from an inability to absorb food 
nutrients and fluid across the gut. It is often caused by surgical removal of all or part of the small 
intestine. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Revestive 
Do not use Revestive 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to teduglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) or trace residues of tetracycline. 
if you have or are suspected to have cancer. 
if you have had cancer in the gastrointestinal tract, including liver, gallbladder or bile ducts, and 
pancreas within the last five years. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Revestive: 
- 
if you have severely decreased liver function. Your doctor will consider this when prescribing 
this medicine. 
if you suffer from certain cardiovascular diseases (affecting the heart and/or blood vessels) such 
as high blood pressure (hypertension) or have a weak heart (cardiac insufficiency). The signs 
- 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and symptoms include sudden weight gain, face swelling, swollen ankles and/or shortness of 
breath. 
if you have other severe diseases that are not well controlled. Your doctor will consider this 
when prescribing this medicine. 
if you have decreased kidney function. Your doctor may need to give you a lower dose of this 
medicine. 
- 
- 
When starting and while getting treated with Revestive, your doctor may adjust the amount of 
intravenous fluids or nutrition you receive. 
Medical check-ups before and during treatment with Revestive 
Before you start treatment with this medicine, your doctor will need to perform a colonoscopy (a 
procedure to see inside your colon and rectum) to check for the presence of polyps (small abnormal 
growths) and remove them. It is recommended that your doctor performs these examinations once a 
year during the first 2 years after starting treatment, and then at a minimum of five-year intervals. If 
polyps are found either before or during your treatment with Revestive, your doctor will decide 
whether you should continue using this medicine. Revestive should not be used if a cancer is detected 
during your colonoscopy. The doctor will monitor your body fluids and electrolytes as an imbalance 
may cause fluid overload or dehydration. 
Your doctor will take special care and monitor your small bowel function and monitor for signs and 
symptoms indicating problems with your gallbladder, bile ducts and pancreas. 
Children and adolescents 
Medical check-ups before and during treatment with Revestive 
Before you start treatment with this medicine, you will need to have a test done to see if there is blood 
in the stool. You will also have a colonoscopy done (a procedure to see inside your colon and rectum 
to check for the presence of polyps (small abnormal growths) and have them removed) if you have 
unexplained blood in your bowel movements (stools). If polyps are found before your treatment with 
Revestive, your doctor will decide whether you should use this medicine. Revestive should not be 
used if a cancer is detected during your colonoscopy. Your doctor will perform further colonoscopies 
if you continue treatment with Revestive. The doctor will monitor your child’s body fluids and 
electrolytes as an imbalance may cause fluid overload or dehydration  
Children below 4 months of age 
This medicine should not be used in children under 4 months of age. This is because there is limited 
experience with Revestive in this age group. 
Other medicines and Revestive 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
Revestive may affect how other medicines are absorbed from the gut and therefore how well they 
work. Your doctor may have to change your dose of other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, the use of Revestive is not recommended. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before using this medicine. 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine may cause you to feel dizzy. If this happens to you, do not drive or use machines until 
you feel better. 
Important information about some of the ingredients in Revestive 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Caution is needed if you are hypersensitive to tetracycline (see “Do not use Revestive” section). 
3. 
How to use Revestive 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse if you are not sure. 
Dose 
The recommended daily dose is 0.05 mg per kg body weight. The dose will be given in millilitres (ml)

Use in children and adolescents 
Revestive can be used in children and adolescents (aged 4 months and above). Use this medicine 
exactly as your doctor has told you. 
How to use Revestive 
Revestive is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) once daily. The injection can be 
self-administered or given by another person, for example your doctor, his/her assistant or your home 
nurse. If you, or your carer, are injecting the medicine, you or your carer must receive adequate 
training by your doctor or nurse. You will find detailed instructions for injections at the end of this 
leaflet. 
It is strongly recommended that every time you or your child receive a dose of Revestive, the name 
and lot number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the lots used. 
If you use more Revestive than you should 
If you inject more Revestive than you are told to by your doctor, you should contact your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. 
If you forget to use Revestive 
If you forget to inject this medicine (or cannot inject it at your usual time), use it as soon as possible 
on that day. Never use more than one injection in the same day. Do not inject a double dose to make 
up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Revestive 
Keep using this medicine for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. Do not stop using this 
medicine without consulting your doctor, as a sudden stop can cause changes in your fluid balance. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Read the Package Leaflet before using Revestive. 
Revestive is for injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). 
Do not inject Revestive into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). 
Keep Revestive out of the sight and reach of children. 
Do not use Revestive after the expiry date which is stated on the carton, the vial and the 
pre-filled syringe. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. 
Store below 25°C. 
Do not freeze. 
After reconstitution, from a microbiological point of view, the solution should be used 
immediately. However, chemical and physical stability has been demonstrated for 3 hours at 
25ºC. 
Do not use Revestive if you notice that the solution is cloudy or contains particulate matter. 
Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist 
how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the 
environment. 
Dispose of all needles and syringes in a sharps disposal container. 
Materials provided in the pack: 
- 
- 
1 or 28 vials with 5 mg teduglutide as a powder 
1 or 28 pre-filled syringes with solvent 
Materials needed but not included in the pack: 
-  Reconstitution needles (size 22G, length 1½" (0.7 x 40 mm)) 
- 
0.5 or 1 ml injection syringes (with scale intervals of 0.02 ml or smaller). For children, a 0.5 ml 
(or smaller) injection syringe may be used 
-  Thin injection needles for subcutaneous injection (e.g., size 26G, length 5/8" (0.45 x 16 mm), or 
smaller needles for children, as appropriate) 
-  Alcohol wipes 
-  Alcohol swabs 
-  A puncture-proof container for safe disposal of the used syringes and needles 
NOTE: Before you start, make sure you have a clean work surface and that you have washed your 
hands before proceeding. 
1. 
Assemble the pre-filled syringe 
Once you have all the materials ready, you need to assemble the pre-filled syringe. The following 
procedure shows how you do this. 
1.1 
Take the pre-filled syringe with the solvent and flip off the top 
part of the white plastic cap on the pre-filled syringe so that it is ready 
for the reconstitution needle to be attached. 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Attach the reconstitution needle (22G, 1½" (0.7 x 40 mm)) to 
1.2 
the assembled pre-filled syringe by screwing it on in a clockwise 
direction. 
2. 
Dissolve the powder 
Now you are ready to dissolve the powder with the solvent. 
2.1 
Remove the green flip-off button from the powder vial, wipe 
the top with an alcohol wipe and allow to dry. Do not touch the top of 
the vial. 
Uncap the reconstitution needle on the assembled pre-filled 
2.2 
syringe with solvent without touching the tip of the needle. 
2.3 
Taking the powder vial, insert the reconstitution needle 
attached to the assembled pre-filled syringe into the centre of the rubber 
stopper and gently push the plunger all the way down to inject all the 
solvent into the vial. 
Leave the reconstitution needle and empty syringe in the vial. 
2.4 
Let the vial rest for approximately 30 seconds. 
Gently roll the vial between your palms for about 15 seconds. 
2.5 
Then gently turn the vial upside-down once with the reconstitution 
needle and empty syringe still in the vial. 
NOTE: Do not shake the vial. Shaking the vial may produce foam, which makes it difficult to extract 
the solution from the vial. 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.6 
Let the vial rest for about two minutes. 
Observe the vial for any undissolved powder. If any powder remains, repeat steps 2.5 and 2.6. 
2.7 
Do not shake the vial. If there is still some undissolved powder, discard the vial and start the 
preparation again from the beginning with a new vial. 
NOTE: The final solution should be clear. If the solution is cloudy or contains particulate matter, do 
not inject it. 
NOTE: Once prepared, the solution should be used immediately. It should be kept below 25°C and 
maximum storage time is three hours. 
3. 
Prepare the injection syringe 
Remove the reconstitution syringe from the reconstitution 
3.1 
needle which is still in the vial and discard the reconstitution syringe. 
Take the injection syringe and attach it to the reconstitution 
3.2 
needle which is still in the vial. 
Turn the vial upside down, slide the tip of the reconstitution 
3.3 
needle close to the stopper and allow all the medicine to fill the syringe 
by pulling the plunger back gently. 
NOTE: If your doctor has told you that you need two vials, prepare a second pre-filled syringe with 
solvent and a second powder vial as shown in the main steps 1 and 2. Withdraw the solution from the 
second vial into the same injection syringe by repeating step 3. 
3.4 
Remove the injection syringe from reconstitution needle 
leaving the needle in the vial. Discard the vial and reconstitution needle 
together into the sharps disposal container. 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.5 
Take the injection needle, but do not remove the plastic needle 
cap. Attach the needle to the injection syringe containing the medicine. 
Check for air bubbles. If air bubbles are present, gently tap the 
3.6 
syringe until they rise to the top. Then gently push up the plunger to 
expel the air. 
Your dose in ml has been calculated by your doctor. Expel any 
3.7 
excessive volume from the syringe with the needle cap still on until 
your dose is reached. 
4. 
Inject the solution 
4.1 
Find an area on your belly, or if you 
have pain or hardening of the tissue on your 
belly, on your thigh where it is easy for you to 
give the injection (see the diagram). 
NOTE: Do not use the same area each day for each injection - rotate sites (use upper, lower, and left 
and right side of your belly) to avoid discomfort. Avoid areas that are inflamed, swollen, scarred or 
covered by a mole, birthmark or other lesion. 
Clean the intended site of injection on your skin with an 
4.2 
alcohol swab, using a circular motion, working outwards. Allow the 
area to air-dry. 
Remove the plastic cap from the needle of the prepared 
4.3 
injection syringe. Gently grasp the cleaned skin at the injection site 
with one hand. With the other hand, hold the syringe as you would with 
a pencil. Bend your wrist back and quickly insert the needle at a 
45° angle. 
Pull back the plunger slightly. If you see any blood in the syringe, withdraw the needle and 
4.4 
replace the needle on the injection syringe with a clean one of the same size. You can still use the 
medicine that is already in the syringe. Try to inject in another place in the cleaned skin area. 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inject the medicine slowly by pushing steadily on the plunger until all the medicine is injected 
4.5 
and the syringe is empty. 
4.6 
Pull the needle straight out of the skin and discard the needle and syringe together into the 
sharps disposal container. A small amount of bleeding may occur. If necessary, press gently on the 
injection site with an alcohol swab or 2x2 gauze until any bleeding has stopped. 
4.7 
Dispose all needles and syringes in a sharps disposal container or hard-walled container (for 
example, a detergent bottle with a lid). This container must be puncture proof (top and sides). If you 
need a sharps disposal container, please contact your doctor.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Orkambi tablets are indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and 
older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) gene (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1).

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Orkambi should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of CF. If the 
patient’s genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be performed to 
confirm the presence of the F508del mutation on both alleles of the CFTR gene.

Patients may start treatment on any day of the week. 
This medicinal product should be taken with fat-containing food. A fat-containing meal or snack 
should be consumed just before or just after dosing (see section 5.2). 
Missed dose 
If less than 6 hours have passed since the missed dose, the scheduled dose should be taken with fat-
containing food. If more than 6 hours have passed, the patient should be instructed to wait until the 
next scheduled dose. A double dose should not be taken to make up for the forgotten dose. 
Concomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors 
No dose adjustment is necessary when CYP3A inhibitors are initiated in patients currently taking 
Orkambi. However, when initiating treatment in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, the dose 
should be reduced to one tablet daily for the first week of treatment to allow for the steady state 
induction effect of lumacaftor. Following this period, the recommended daily dose should be 
continued (see Table 2).

If treatment is interrupted for more than one week and then re-initiated while taking strong CYP3A 
inhibitors, the dose should be reduced to one tablet daily for the first week of treatment re-initiation 
(see Table 2). Following this period, the recommended daily dose should be continued (see 
section 4.5). 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 
30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). For 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), a dose reduction is recommended. 
There is no experience of the use of the medicinal product in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Class C), but exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment. Therefore, after weighing the risks and benefits of treatment, Orkambi should be used 
with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment, at a reduced dose (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 
5.2). 
For dose adjustments for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, (see Table 3).

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Patients with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene 
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor is not effective in patients with CF who have the F508del mutation on one allele 
plus a second allele with a mutation predicted to result in a lack of CFTR production or that is not 
responsive to ivacaftor in vitro (see section 5.1).

Patients with CF who have a gating (Class III) mutation in the CFTR gene 
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have a gating (Class III) mutation 
in the CFTR gene on one allele, with or without the F508del mutation on the other allele. Since the 
exposure of ivacaftor is very significantly reduced when dosed in combination with lumacaftor, 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor should not be used in these patients. 
Respiratory adverse reactions 
Respiratory adverse reactions (e.g., chest discomfort, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, and respiration 
abnormal) were more common during initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy. Serious respiratory 
events were seen more frequently in patients with percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 
second (ppFEV1) <40, and may lead to discontinuation of the medicinal product. Clinical experience 
in patients with ppFEV1 < 40 is limited and additional monitoring of these patients is recommended 
during initiation of therapy (see section 4.8). A transient decline in FEV1 has also been observed in 
some patients following initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. There is no experience of initiating 
treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients having a pulmonary exacerbation and initiating 
treatment in patients having a pulmonary exacerbation is not advisable. 
Effect on blood pressure 
Increased blood pressure has been observed in some patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Blood 
pressure should be monitored periodically in all patients during treatment (see section 4.8). 
Patients with advanced liver disease 
Abnormalities in liver function, including advanced liver disease, can be present in patients with CF. 
Worsening of liver function in patients with advanced liver disease has been reported. Liver function 
decompensation, including liver failure leading to death, has been reported in CF patients with pre-
existing cirrhosis with portal hypertension receiving lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor should 
be used with caution in patients with advanced liver disease and only if the benefits are expected to 
outweigh the risks. If lumacaftor/ivacaftor is used in these patients, they should be closely monitored 
after the initiation of treatment and the dose should be reduced (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). 
Hepatobiliary adverse reactions 
Elevated transaminases have been commonly reported in patients with CF receiving 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor. In some instances, these elevations have been associated with concomitant 
elevations in total serum bilirubin. Transaminase elevations have been observed more frequently in 
paediatric patients than in adult patients (see section 4.8). 
Because an association with liver injury cannot be excluded, assessments of liver function tests (ALT, 
AST and bilirubin) are recommended before initiating lumacaftor/ivacaftor, every 3 months during the 
first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of ALT, AST, or bilirubin 
elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. 
In the event of significant elevation of ALT or AST, with or without elevated bilirubin (either ALT or 
AST > 5 x the upper limit of normal [ULN], or ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with bilirubin > 2 x ULN 
and/or clinical jaundice), dosing with lumacaftor/ivacaftor should be discontinued and laboratory tests 
closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. A thorough investigation of potential causes should 
be conducted and patients should be followed closely for clinical progression. Following resolution of 
transaminase elevations, the benefits and risks of resuming dosing should be considered (see 
sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2).

Interactions with medicinal products 
Substrates of CYP3A 
Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Co-administration with sensitive CYP3A substrates or 
CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable, should not be relied 
upon as an effective method of contraception when co-administered with Orkambi (see section 4.5). 
Strong CYP3A inducers 
Ivacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A 
inducers (e.g., rifampicin, St. John’s wort [Hypericum perforatum]) is not recommended (see  
section 4.5). 
Renal impairment 
Caution is recommended while using lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with severe renal impairment or 
end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Cataracts 
Cases of non-congenital lens opacities without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric 
patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor monotherapy. Although other risk factors were 
present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable 
to ivacaftor cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological 
examinations are recommended in paediatric patients initiating treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. 
Patients after organ transplantation 
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ 
transplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for 
interactions with immunosuppressants. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Based on exposure and indicated doses, the interaction profile is considered to be the same for all 
strengths and pharmaceutical forms.  
Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A and ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A when given as 
monotherapy. There is potential for other medicinal products to affect lumacaftor/ivacaftor when 
administered concomitantly, and also for lumacaftor/ivacaftor to affect other medicinal products. 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
Inhibitors of CYP3A 
Co-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, did not impact 
the exposure of lumacaftor, but increased ivacaftor exposure by 4.3-fold. Due to the induction effect of 
lumacaftor on CYP3A, at steady-state, the net exposure of ivacaftor when co-administered with a 
CYP3A inhibitor is not expected to exceed that when given in the absence of lumacaftor at a dose of 
150 mg every 12 hours, the approved dose of ivacaftor monotherapy.

No dose adjustment is necessary when CYP3A inhibitors are initiated in patients currently taking 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor. However, when initiating lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients taking strong CYP3A 
inhibitors, the dose should be adjusted (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
No dose adjustment is recommended when used with moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitors. 
Inducers of CYP3A 
Co-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, had minimal 
effect on the exposure of lumacaftor, but decreased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by 57%. Therefore, 
co-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor is not recommended with strong CYP3A inducers (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
No dose adjustment is recommended when used with moderate or weak CYP3A inducers. 
Potential for lumacaftor/ivacaftor to affect other medicinal products 
CYP3A substrates 
Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A when given as 
monotherapy. The net effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy is expected to be strong CYP3A 
induction. Therefore, concomitant use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with CYP3A substrates may decrease 
the exposure of these substrates (see section 4.4). 
P-gp substrates 
In vitro studies indicated that lumacaftor has the potential to both inhibit and induce P-gp. 
Additionally, a clinical study with ivacaftor monotherapy showed that ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of 
P-gp. Therefore, concomitant use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with P-gp substrates (e.g., digoxin) may alter 
the exposure of these substrates. 
CYP2B6 and CYP2C substrates 
Interaction with CYP2B6 and CYP2C substrates has not been investigated in vivo. In vitro studies 
suggest that lumacaftor has the potential to induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19; 
however, inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 has also been observed in vitro. Additionally, in vitro 
studies suggest that ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, concomitant use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
may alter (i.e., either increase or decrease) the exposure of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 substrates, decrease 
the exposure of CYP2C19 substrates, and substantially decrease the exposure of CYP2B6 substrates. 
Potential for lumacaftor/ivacaftor to interact with transporters 
In vitro experiments show that lumacaftor is a substrate for Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). 
Co-administration of Orkambi with medicinal products that inhibit BCRP may increase plasma 
lumacaftor concentration. Lumacaftor inhibits the organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 and 3. 
Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are inhibitors of BCRP. Co-administration of Orkambi with medicinal 
products that are substrates for OAT1/3 and BCRP transport may increase plasma concentrations of 
such medicinal products. Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are not inhibitors of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and 
organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and 2. Ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3. 
Established and other potentially significant interactions 
Table 4 provides the established or predicted effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on other medicinal 
products or the effect of other medicinal products on lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The information reported in 
Table 4 mostly derives from in vitro studies. The recommendations provided under “Clinical 
comment” in Table 4 are based on interaction studies, clinical relevance, or predicted interactions due 
to elimination pathways. Interactions that have the most clinical relevance are listed first.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor in pregnant women. Animal studies with lumacaftor and ivacaftor do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to developmental and reproductive toxicity, whereas 
effects were noted with ivacaftor only at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor during pregnancy unless the clinical 
condition of the mother requires treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether lumacaftor and/or ivacaftor and metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of both lumacaftor and ivacaftor into 
the milk of lactating female rats. As such, risks to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision 
must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the 
benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effects of lumacaftor and/or ivacaftor on fertility are available. Lumacaftor had 
no effects on fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats. Ivacaftor impaired 
fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ivacaftor, which is one of the active components of Orkambi, has a minor influence on the ability to 
drive and use machines. Ivacaftor may cause dizziness (see section 4.8). 
Patients experiencing dizziness while taking Orkambi should be advised not to drive or use machines 
until symptoms abate. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions are dyspnoea (14.0%), diarrhoea (11.0%), and nausea (10.2%). 
Serious adverse reactions included hepatobiliary events, e.g., transaminase elevations (0.5%), 
cholestatic hepatitis (0.3%) and hepatic encephalopathy (0.1%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions identified from the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies (trials 809-103 and 
809-104) in patients aged 12 years and older and from a 24-week, placebo-controlled study in patients 
aged 6 to less than 12 years (trial 809-109), who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the 
CFTR gene are presented in Table 5 and are listed by system organ class and frequency. Adverse 
reactions observed with ivacaftor alone are also provided in Table 5. Adverse reactions are ranked 
under the MedDRA frequency classification: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); 
uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000); and not 
known (frequency cannot be estimated using the available data).

† 1 patient out of 738 
‡ 2 patients out of 738 
The safety data from 1,029 patients aged 12 years and older who were homozygous for the F508del 
mutation in the CFTR gene treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor for up to an additional 96 weeks in the 
long-term safety and efficacy rollover study (trial 809-105) were similar to the 24-week, 
placebo-controlled studies (see section 5.1). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hepatobiliary adverse reactions 
During trials 809-103 and 809-104, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, 
> 5, and > 3 x ULN was 0.8%, 2.0%, and 5.2%; and 0.5%, 1.9%, and 5.1% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor- 
and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The incidence of transaminase-related adverse reactions was 
5.1% and 4.6% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients and those who received placebo, respectively. 
Seven patients who received lumacaftor/ivacaftor had liver-related serious adverse reactions with 
elevated transaminases, including 3 with concurrent elevation in total bilirubin. Following 
discontinuation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor, liver function tests returned to baseline or improved 
substantially in all patients (see section 4.4). 
Among 7 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension who received 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor in the placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, worsening liver function with 
increased ALT, AST, bilirubin, and hepatic encephalopathy was observed in one patient. The event 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
occurred within 5 days of the start of dosing and resolved following discontinuation of 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor (see section 4.4). 
Post–marketing cases of liver function decompensation including liver failure leading to death have 
been reported in CF patients with pre-existing cirrhosis with portal hypertension who were treated with 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor (see section 4.4). 
Respiratory adverse reactions 
During trials 809-103 and 809-104, the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions (e.g., chest 
discomfort, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, and respiration abnormal) was 26.3% in 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients compared to 17.0% in patients who received placebo. The 
incidence of these adverse reactions was more common in patients with lower pre-treatment FEV1. 
Approximately three-quarters of the events began during the first week of treatment, and in most 
patients the events resolved without dosing interruption. The majority of adverse reactions were mild 
or moderate in severity, non-serious and did not result in treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). 
During a 24-week, open-label, Phase 3b clinical study (trial 809-011 [Part B]) in 46 patients aged 12 
years and older with advanced lung disease (ppFEV1 < 40) [mean ppFEV1 29.1 at baseline (range: 
18.3 to 42.0)], the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions was 65.2%. In the subgroup of 28 patients 
who were initiated at the full dose of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (2 tablets every 12 hours), the incidence was 
71.4%, and in the 18 patients who were initiated at a reduced dose of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (1 tablet 
every 12 hours for up to 2 weeks, and subsequently increased to the full dose), the incidence was 
55.6%. Of the patients who were initiated lumacaftor/ivacaftor at the full dose, one patient had a 
serious respiratory adverse reaction, three patients subsequently had their dose reduced, and three 
patients discontinued treatment. No serious respiratory adverse reactions, dose reductions or 
discontinuations were seen in patients who were initiated at the half dose (see section 4.4). 
Menstrual abnormalities 
During trials 809-103 and 809-104, the incidence of combined menstrual abnormalities (amenorrhoea, 
dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, menstruation irregular, metrorrhagia, oligomenorrhoea, and 
polymenorrhoea) was 9.9 % in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated female patients and 1.7% in 
placebo-treated females. These menstrual events occurred more frequently in the subset of female 
patients who were taking hormonal contraceptives (25.0%) versus patients who were not taking 
hormonal contraceptives (3.5%) (see section 4.5). Most of these reactions were mild or moderate in 
severity and non-serious. In lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients, approximately two-thirds of these 
reactions resolved, and the median duration was 10 days. 
Increased blood pressure 
During trials 809-103 and 809-104, adverse reactions related to increased blood pressure (e.g., 
hypertension, blood pressure increased) were reported in 0.9% (7/738) of patients treated with 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor and in no patients who received placebo. 
In patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor (mean baseline 114 mmHg systolic and 69 mmHg 
diastolic), the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 
3.1 mmHg and 1.8 mmHg, respectively. In patients who received placebo (mean baseline 114 mmHg 
systolic and 69 mmHg diastolic), the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure was 0.9 mmHg and 0.9 mmHg, respectively. 
The proportion of patients who experienced a systolic blood pressure value > 140 mmHg or a diastolic 
blood pressure > 90 mmHg on at least two occasions was 3.4% and 1.5% in patients treated with 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor, respectively, compared with 1.6% and 0.5% in patients who received placebo 
(see section 4.4).

Paediatric population 
The safety data of lumacaftor/ivacaftor were evaluated in 46 patients aged 1 to less than 2 years (trial 
809-122), 60 patients aged 2 to 5 years (trial 809-115), 161 patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (trials 
809-011 and 809-109) and in 194 patients aged 12 to 17 years with CF who are homozygous for the 
F508del mutation and who received lumacaftor/ivacaftor in clinical studies. Patients aged 12 to 
17 years were included in trials 809-103 and 809-104. 
The overall safety profile in these paediatric patients is generally consistent with that in adult patients. 
Few selected adverse reactions are specifically reported in the paediatric population. 
Long-term safety data from a 96-week rollover extension study (trial 809-116) in 57 patients aged 
2 years and older who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene were generally 
consistent with the 24-week parent study in patients aged 2 to 5 years (trial 809-115) and safety data in 
patients aged 6 to  less than 12 years. 
Long-term safety data from a 96-week rollover extension study in 239 patients aged 6 years and older 
who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (trial 809-110) were generally 
consistent with the 24-week parent studies in patients aged 6 to  less than 12 years (trial 809-011 and 
trial 809-109). 
Description of selected adverse reactions for patients aged 6 to less than 12 years 
Hepatobiliary adverse reactions 
During the 24-week, open-label Phase 3 clinical study in 58 patients aged 6 to less than 12 years 
(trial 809-011), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, > 5, and >3 x ULN 
was 5.3%, 8.8%, and 19.3%. No patients had total bilirubin levels > 2 x ULN.  
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor dosing was maintained or successfully resumed after interruption in all patients 
with transaminase elevations, except 1 patient who discontinued treatment. 
During the 24-week, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study in 204 patients aged 6 to  less than 
12 years (trial 809-109), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, > 5, and 
> 3 x ULN was 1.0%, 4.9%, and 12.6% in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor patients, and 2.0%, 3.0%, and 7.9% 
in the placebo-treated patients. No patients had total bilirubin levels > 2 x ULN. Two patients in the 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor group and two patients in the placebo group discontinued treatment due to 
transaminase elevations. 
Respiratory adverse reactions 
During the 24-week, open-label Phase 3 clinical study (trial 809-011) in 58 patients aged 6 to  less than 
12 years (mean baseline ppFEV1 was 91.4), the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions was 6.9% 
(4/58). 
During the 24-week, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study (trial 809-109) in patients aged 6 to  
less than 12 years (mean baseline ppFEV1 was 89.8), the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions 
was 18.4% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor patients and 12.9% in placebo patients. A decline in ppFEV1 at 
initiation of therapy was observed during serial post dose spirometry assessments. The absolute change 
from pre-dose at 4 to6 hours post-dose was -7.7 on day 1 and -1.3 on day 15 in lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
patients. The post-dose decline was resolved by week 16. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No specific antidote is available for overdose with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Treatment of overdose 
consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the 
clinical status of the patient. 
Adverse reactions that occurred at an increased incidence of ≥ 5% in the supratherapeutic dose period 
compared with the therapeutic dose period were headache, generalised rash, and increased 
transaminase.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products; ATC code: R07AX30 
Mechanism of action 
The CFTR protein is a chloride channel present at the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. 
The F508del mutation impacts the CFTR protein in multiple ways, primarily by causing a defect in 
cellular processing and trafficking that reduces the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. The small 
amount of F508del-CFTR that reaches the cell surface has low channel-open probability (defective 
channel gating). Lumacaftor is a CFTR corrector that acts directly on F508del-CFTR to improve its 
cellular processing and trafficking, thereby increasing the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell 
surface. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the 
channel-open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The combined effect of 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface, 
resulting in increased chloride ion transport. The exact mechanisms by which lumacaftor improves 
cellular processing and trafficking of F508del-CFTR and ivacaftor potentiates F508del-CFTR are not 
known. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Effects on sweat chloride 
Changes in sweat chloride in response to lumacaftor alone or in combination with ivacaftor were 
evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with CF aged 18 years 
and older. In this trial, 10 patients (homozygous for F508del-CFTR mutation) completed dosing with 
lumacaftor alone 400 mg q12h for 28 days followed by the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h for an 
additional 28 days, and 25 patients (homozygous or heterozygous for F508del) completed dosing with 
placebo. The treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg q12h alone and placebo evaluated as 
mean change in sweat chloride from baseline to day 28 was statistically significant at -8.2 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -14, -2). The treatment difference between the combination of lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 
250 mg q12h and placebo evaluated as mean change in sweat chloride from baseline to day 56 was 
statistically significant at -11 mmol/L (95% CI: -18, -4). 
In trial 809-109 (see Clinical efficacy and safety) in patients homozygous for the F508del-CFTR 
mutation aged 6 to less than 12 years, the treatment difference (LS mean) in sweat chloride for the 
absolute change at week 24 as compared to placebo was -24.9 mmol/L (nominal P < 0.0001). The 
treatment difference (LS mean) in sweat chloride for the average absolute change at day 15 and at 
week 4 as compared to placebo was -20.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -23.4, -18.2; nominal P < 0.0001). 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Changes in FEV1 
Changes in ppFEV1 in response to lumacaftor alone or in combination with ivacaftor were also 
evaluated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial in patients with CF aged 18 years and 
older. The treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg q12h alone and placebo evaluated as mean 
absolute change in ppFEV1 was -4.6 percentage points (95% CI: -9.6, 0.4) from baseline to day 28, 4.2 
percentage points (95% CI: –1.3, 9.7) from baseline to day 56, and 7.7 percentage points (95% CI: 2.6, 
12.8; statistically significant) from day 28 to day 56 (following the addition of ivacaftor to lumacaftor 
monotherapy). 
Decrease in heart rate 
During the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, a maximum decrease in mean heart rate of 
6 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline was observed on day 1 and day 15 around 4 to 6 hours after 
dosing. After day 15, heart rate was not monitored in the period after dosing in these studies. From 
week 4, the change in mean heart rate at pre-dose ranged from 1 to 2 bpm below baseline among 
patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The percentage of patients with heart rate values < 50 bpm 
on treatment was 11% for patients who received lumacaftor/ivacaftor, compared to 4.9% for patients 
who received placebo. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
No meaningful changes in QTc interval or blood pressure were observed in a thorough QT clinical 
study evaluating lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and lumacaftor 1000 mg once 
daily/ivacaftor 450 mg q12h. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Trials in patients with CF aged 12 years and above who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in 
the CFTR gene 
The efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation in the CFTR gene was evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical 
trials of 1,108 clinically stable patients with CF, in which 737 patients were randomised to and dosed 
with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Patients in both trials were randomised 1:1:1 to receive lumacaftor 600 mg 
once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, or placebo. 
Patients took the study drug with fat-containing food for 24 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF 
therapies (e.g., bronchodilators, inhaled antibiotics, dornase alfa, and hypertonic saline). Patients from 
these trials were eligible to roll over into a blinded extension study. 
Trial 809-103 evaluated 549 patients with CF who were aged 12 years and older (mean age 25.1 years) 
with percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) at screening between 40-90 (mean ppFEV1 60.7 at baseline 
[range: 31.1 to 94.0]). Trial 809-104 evaluated 559 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 25.0 
years) with ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90 (mean ppFEV1 60.5 at baseline [range: 31.3 to 99.8]). 
Patients with a history of colonisation with organisms such as Burkholderia cenocepacia, 
Burkholderia dolosa, or Mycobacterium abscessus or who had 3 or more abnormal liver function tests 
(ALT, AST, AP, GGT ≥ 3 times the ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 2 times the ULN) were excluded. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at 
week 24. Other efficacy variables included relative change from baseline in ppFEV1, absolute change 
from baseline in BMI, absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain, the proportion of 
patients achieving ≥ 5% relative change from baseline in ppFEV1 at week 24, and the number of 
pulmonary exacerbations (including those requiring hospitalisation or IV antibiotic therapy) through 
week 24. 
In both trials, treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor resulted in a statistically significant improvement in 
ppFEV1 (see Table 6). Mean improvement in ppFEV1 was rapid in onset (day 15) and sustained 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
throughout the 24-week treatment period. At day 15, the treatment difference between lumacaftor 
400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in ppFEV1 from 
baseline was 2.51 percentage points in the pooled trials 809-103 and 809-104 (P < 0.0001). 
Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, disease severity, sex and geographic 
region. The Phase 3 trials of lumacaftor/ivacaftor included 81 patients with ppFEV1 < 40 at baseline. 
The treatment difference in this subgroup was comparable to that observed in patients with 
ppFEV1 ≥ 40. At week 24, the treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h 
and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in ppFEV1 from baseline in the pooled trials 809-
103 and 809-104 were 3.39 percentage points (P = 0.0382) for patients with ppFEV1 < 40 and 2.47 
percentage points (P < 0.0001) for patients with ppFEV1 ≥ 40.

* In each study, a hierarchical testing procedure was performed within each active treatment arm for primary and secondary 
endpoints vs. placebo; at each step, P ≤ 0.0250 and all previous tests also meeting this level of significance was required for 
statistical significance. 
† Indicates statistical significance confirmed in the hierarchical testing procedure. 
At week 24, the proportion of patients who remained free from pulmonary exacerbations was 
significantly higher for patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor compared with placebo. In the 
pooled analysis, the rate ratio of exacerbations through week 24 in subjects treated with 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor (lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h; n = 369) was 0.61 (P < 0.0001), 
representing a reduction of 39% relative to placebo. The event rate per year, annualised to 48 weeks, 
was 0.70 in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor group and 1.14 in the placebo group. Treatment with 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor significantly decreased the risk for exacerbations requiring hospitalisation versus 
placebo by 61% (rate ratio=0.39, P < 0.0001; event rate per 48 weeks 0.17 for lumacaftor/ivacaftor and 
0.45 for placebo) and reduced exacerbations requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics by 56% 
(rate ratio = 0.44, P < 0.0001; event rate per 48 weeks 0.25 for lumacaftor/ivacaftor and 0.58 for 
placebo). These results were not considered statistically significant within the framework of the testing 
hierarchy for the individual studies. 
Long-term safety and efficacy rollover trial 
Trial 809-105 was a Phase 3, parallel-group, multicentre, rollover extension study in patients with CF 
that included patients aged 12 years and older from trial 809-103 and trial 809-104. This extension trial 
was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Of the 
1,108 patients who received any treatment in trial 809-103 or trial 809-104, 1,029 (93%) were dosed 
and received active treatment (lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h or lumacaftor 
400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h) in trial 809-105 for up to an additional 96 weeks (i.e., up to a 
total of 120 weeks). The primary efficacy analysis of this extension study included data up to week 72 
of trial 809-105 with a sensitivity analysis that included data up to week 96 of trial 809-105.  
Patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in trial 809-103 or trial 809-104 showed an effect that was 
maintained with respect to baseline after an additional 96 weeks through trial 809-105. For patients 
who transitioned from placebo to active treatment similar changes as those observed in patients treated 
with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in trial 809-103 or trial 809-104 were seen (see Table 6). Results from trial 
809-105 are presented in Figure 1 and Table 7.

Trial in patients with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene 
Trial 809-102 was a multicentre, double–blind, randomised, placebo–controlled, Phase 2 trial in 
125 patients with CF aged 18 years and older who had a ppFEV1 of 40 to 90, inclusive, and have the 
F508del mutation on one allele plus a second allele with a mutation predicted to result in the lack of 
CFTR production or a CFTR that is not responsive to ivacaftor in vitro. 
Patients received either lumacaftor/ivacaftor (n = 62) or placebo (n = 63) in addition to their prescribed 
CF therapies. The primary endpoint was improvement in lung function as determined by the mean 
absolute change from baseline at day 56 in ppFEV1. Treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor resulted in no 
significant improvement in ppFEV1 relative to placebo in patients with CF heterozygous for the 
F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (treatment difference 0.60 [P = 0.5978]) and no meaningful 
improvements in BMI or weight (see section 4.4).

Paediatric population 
Trials in patients with CF aged 6 to less than 12 years old who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation in the CFTR gene 
Trial 809-109 was a 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical study in 204 patients with CF aged 
6 to less than 12 years old (mean age 8.8 years). Trial 809-109 evaluated subjects with lung clearance 
index (LCI2.5) ≥ 7.5 at the initial screening visit (mean LCI2.5 10.28 at baseline [range: 6.55 to 16.38]) 
and ppFEV1 ≥ 70 at screening (mean ppFEV1 89.8 at baseline [range: 48.6 to 119.6]). Patients received 
either lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 hours (n = 103) or placebo (n = 101) in addition 
to their prescribed CF therapies. Patients who had 2 or more abnormal liver function tests (ALT, AST, 
AP, GGT ≥ 3 times the ULN), or ALT or AST > 5 times ULN, or total bilirubin > 2 times ULN were 
excluded. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 24. Key 
secondary endpoints included average absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at day 15 and 
week 4 and at week 24 (see Pharmacodynamic effects), absolute change from baseline in BMI at 
week 24, absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain through week 24. These 
results are presented in Table 8 below:

Percent predicted FEV1 was also evaluated as a clinically meaningful other secondary endpoint. In the 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor patients, the treatment difference for absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline 
through week 24 was 2.4 (P = 0.0182). 
Patients with CF aged 6 years and older from trial 809-011 and trial 809-109 were included in a 
phase 3, multicentre, rollover extension study (trial -809-110). This extension trial was designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Of the 262 patients 
who received any treatment in trial 809-011 or trial 809-109, 239 (91%) were dosed and received 
active treatment (patients 6 to <12 years of age received lumacaftor 200 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg 
q12h; patients ≥12 years of age received lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h) in the 
extension study for up to an additional 96 weeks (i.e., up to a total of 120 weeks) (see section 4.8).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The exposure (AUC) of lumacaftor is approximately 2-fold higher in healthy adult volunteers 
compared to exposure in patients with CF. The exposure of ivacaftor is similar between healthy adult 
volunteers and patients with CF. After twice-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor in healthy subjects were generally reached after approximately 7 days of 
treatment, with an accumulation ratio of approximately 1.9 for lumacaftor. The steady-state exposure 
of ivacaftor is lower than that of day 1 due to the CYP3A induction effect of lumacaftor (see 
section 4.5). 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After oral administration of lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h in a fed state, the 
steady-state mean (± SD) for AUC0-12h and Cmax were 198 (64.8) µg∙h/mL and 25.0 (7.96) µg/mL for 
lumacaftor, respectively, and 3.66 (2.25) µg∙h/mL and 0.602 (0.304) µg/mL for ivacaftor, respectively. 
After oral administration of ivacaftor alone as 150 mg q12h in a fed state, the steady-state mean (± SD) 
for AUC0-12h and Cmax were 9.08 (3.20) µg∙h/mL and 1.12 (0.319) µg/mL, respectively. 
Absorption 
Following multiple oral doses of lumacaftor, the exposure of lumacaftor generally increased 
proportional to dose over the range of 50 mg to 1000 mg every 24 hours. The exposure of lumacaftor 
increased approximately 2.0-fold when given with fat-containing food relative to fasted conditions. 
The median (range) Tmax of lumacaftor is approximately 4.0 hours (2.0; 9.0) in the fed state. 
Following multiple oral dose administration of ivacaftor in combination with lumacaftor, the exposure 
of ivacaftor generally increased with dose from 150 mg every 12 hours to 250 mg every 12 hours. The 
exposure of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor increased approximately 3-fold 
when given with fat-containing food in healthy volunteers. Therefore, lumacaftor/ivacaftor should be 
administered with fat-containing food. The median (range) Tmax of ivacaftor is approximately 4.0 hours 
(2.0; 6.0) in the fed state. 
Distribution 
Lumacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. After oral 
administration of 400 mg every 12 hours in patients with CF in a fed state, the typical apparent 
volumes of distribution for the central and peripheral compartments [coefficient of variation as a 
percentage (CV)] were estimated to be 23.5 L (48.7%) and 33.3 L (30.5%), respectively. 
Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and 
albumin. After oral administration of ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 hours in combination with lumacaftor, 
the typical apparent volumes of distribution for the central and peripheral compartments (CV) were 
estimated to be 95.0 L (53.9%) and 201 L (26.6%), respectively. 
In vitro studies indicate that lumacaftor is a substrate of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). 
Biotransformation 
Lumacaftor is not extensively metabolised in humans, with the majority of lumacaftor excreted 
unchanged in the faeces. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that lumacaftor is mainly metabolised via 
oxidation and glucuronidation. 
Ivacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is 
primarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. 
M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. 
M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. 
Elimination 
Following oral administration of lumacaftor, the majority of lumacaftor (51%) is excreted unchanged 
in the faeces. There was negligible urinary excretion of lumacaftor as unchanged drug. The apparent 
terminal half-life is approximately 26 hours. The typical apparent clearance, CL/F (CV), of lumacaftor 
was estimated to be 2.38 L/h (29.4%) for patients with CF. 
Following oral administration of ivacaftor alone, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the 
faeces after metabolic conversion. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged 
drug. In healthy subjects, the half-life of ivacaftor when given with lumacaftor is approximately 9 
hours. The typical CL/F (CV) of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor was estimated 
to be 25.1 L/h (40.5%) for patients with CF.

Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Following multiple doses of lumacaftor/ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired 
hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had higher exposures (AUC0-12h by approximately 
50% and Cmax by approximately 30%) compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. The 
impact of mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5 to 6) on pharmacokinetics of 
lumacaftor given in combination with ivacaftor has not been studied, but the increase in exposure is 
expected to be less than 50%. 
Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, 
score 10 to 15), but exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8). 
Renal impairment 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with renal 
impairment. In a human pharmacokinetic study with lumacaftor alone, there was minimal elimination 
of lumacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 8.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine 
with 0.18% as unchanged parent). In a human pharmacokinetic study with ivacaftor alone, there was 
minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was 
recovered in the urine). A population pharmacokinetic analysis of clearance versus creatinine 
clearance shows no trend for subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment (see section 4.2). 
Elderly 
The safety and efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients aged 65 years or older have not been 
evaluated. 
Gender 
The effect of gender on lumacaftor pharmacokinetics was evaluated using a population 
pharmacokinetics analysis of data from clinical studies of lumacaftor given in combination with 
ivacaftor. Results indicate no clinically relevant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters for 
lumacaftor or ivacaftor between males and females. No dose adjustments are necessary based on 
gender. 
Paediatric population 
The exposures are similar between adults and the paediatric population based on population (PK) 
analyses as presented in Table 10:

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Lumacaftor 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to 
reproduction and development. Specific studies to evaluate the phototoxic potential of lumacaftor were 
not conducted; however, evaluation of the available non-clinical and clinical data suggests no 
phototoxic liability. 
Ivacaftor 
Effects in repeated dose studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess 
(> 25-, > 45-, and > 35-fold for mice, rats, and dogs, respectively) of the maximum human exposure of 
ivacaftor when administered as Orkambi, indicating little relevance to clinical use. Non-clinical data 
reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity and carcinogenic 
potential. 
Safety pharmacology 
Ivacaftor produced concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on hERG (human ether-à-go-go related 
gene) tail currents, with an IC15 of 5.5 µM, compared to the Cmax (1.5 µM) for ivacaftor at the 
therapeutic dose for lumacaftor/ivacaftor. However, no ivacaftor-induced QT prolongation was 
observed in a dog telemetry study at single doses up to 60 mg/kg or in ECG measurements from 
repeat-dose studies of up to 1 year duration at the 60 mg/kg/day dose level in dogs (Cmax after 
365 days = 36.2 to 47.6 μM). Ivacaftor produced a dose-related but transient increase in the blood 
pressure parameters in dogs at single oral doses up to 60 mg/kg (see section 5.1).  
Pregnancy and fertility 
Ivacaftor was not teratogenic when dosed orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the organogenesis 
stage of foetal development at doses approximately 7 times (ivacaftor and metabolite exposure) and 46 
times the ivacaftor exposure in humans at the therapeutic lumacaftor/ivacaftor dose, respectively. At 
maternally toxic doses in rats, ivacaftor produced reductions in foetal body weight; an increase in the 
incidence of variations in cervical ribs, hypoplastic ribs, and wavy ribs; and sternal irregularities, 
including fusions. The significance of these findings for humans is unknown. 
Ivacaftor impaired fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at 
200 mg/kg/day (yielding exposures approximately 11 and 7 times, respectively, those obtained with 
the maximum recommended human dose of the ivacaftor component of Orkambi based on summed 
AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites extrapolated from day 90 exposures at 150 mg/kg/day in the 
6-month repeat-dose toxicity study and gestation day 17 exposures in the pilot embryofoetal 
development study in this species) when dams were dosed prior to and during early pregnancy. No 
effects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance indices were observed at 
≤ 100 mg/kg/day (yielding exposures approximately 8 and 5 times, respectively, those obtained with 
the maximum recommended human dose of the ivacaftor component of Orkambi based on summed 
AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites extrapolated from day 90 exposures at 100 mg/kg/day in the 
6-month repeat-dose toxicity study and gestation day 17 exposures in the embryofoetal development 
study in this species). Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. 
Peri- and post-natal development 
Ivacaftor did not cause developmental defects in the offspring of pregnant rats dosed orally from 
pregnancy through parturition and weaning at 100 mg/kg/day (yielding exposures that were 
approximately 4 times those obtained with the maximum recommended human dose of the ivacaftor 
component of Orkambi based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Doses above 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
100 mg/kg/day resulted in survival and lactation indices that were 92% and 98% of control values, 
respectively, as well as reductions in pup body weights.  
Juvenile animals 
Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed with ivacaftor at 0.32 times the maximum 
recommended human dose based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when 
co-administered with lumacaftor as Orkambi. Cataracts were not observed in foetuses derived from rat 
dams treated during the organogenesis stage of foetal development, in rat pups exposed to a certain 
extent through milk ingestion prior to weaning, or in repeated dose toxicity studies with ivacaftor. The 
potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown. 
Lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies involving the co-administration of lumacaftor and ivacaftor revealed no 
special hazard for humans in terms of potential for additive and/or synergistic toxicities.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Orkambi granules are indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 1 year and 
older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) gene (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Orkambi should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of CF. If the 
patient’s genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be performed to 
confirm the presence of the F508del mutation on both alleles of the CFTR gene.

Patients may start treatment on any day of the week. 
This medicinal product should be taken with fat-containing food. A fat-containing meal or snack 
should be consumed just before or just after dosing (see section 5.2). 
Missed dose 
If less than 6 hours have passed since the missed dose, the scheduled dose should be taken with fat-
containing food. If more than 6 hours have passed, the patient should be instructed to wait until the 
next scheduled dose. A double dose should not be taken to make up for the forgotten dose. 
Concomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors 
No dose adjustment is necessary when CYP3A inhibitors are initiated in patients currently taking 
Orkambi. However, when initiating treatment in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, the dose 
should be reduced to one sachet every other day for the first week of treatment to allow for the steady 
state induction effect of lumacaftor. Following this period, the recommended daily dose should be 
continued (see Table 2).

Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 
30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). For 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), a dose reduction is recommended. 
There is no experience of the use of the medicinal product in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Class C), but exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment. Therefore, after weighing the risks and benefits of treatment, Orkambi should be used 
with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment at a reduced dose (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 
5.2).

milk, infant formula or juice. Food or liquid should be at room temperature or below. Once mixed, the 
product has been shown to be stable for one hour, and therefore should be ingested during this period.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Patients with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene 
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor is not effective in patients with CF who have the F508del mutation on one allele 
plus a second allele with a mutation predicted to result in a lack of CFTR production or that is not 
responsive to ivacaftor in vitro (see section 5.1). 
Patients with CF who have a gating (Class III) mutation in the CFTR gene 
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have a gating (Class III) mutation 
in the CFTR gene on one allele, with or without the F508del mutation on the other allele. Since the 
exposure of ivacaftor is very significantly reduced when dosed in combination with lumacaftor, 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor should not be used in these patients. 
Respiratory adverse reactions 
Respiratory adverse reactions (e.g., chest discomfort, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, and respiration 
abnormal) were more common during initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy. Serious respiratory 
events were seen more frequently in patients with percent predicted forced expiratory volume in  1 
second (ppFEV1) <40, and may lead to discontinuation of the medicinal product. Clinical experience 
in patients with ppFEV1 <40 is limited and additional monitoring of these patients is recommended 
during initiation of therapy (see section 4.8). A transient decline in FEV1 has also been observed in 
some patients following initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. There is no experience of initiating 
treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients having a pulmonary exacerbation and initiating 
treatment in patients having a pulmonary exacerbation is not advisable. 
Effect on blood pressure 
Increased blood pressure has been observed in some patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Blood 
pressure should be monitored periodically in all patients during treatment (see section 4.8). 
Patients with advanced liver disease 
Abnormalities in liver function, including advanced liver disease, can be present in patients with CF. 
Worsening of liver function in patients with advanced liver disease has been reported. Liver function 
decompensation, including liver failure leading to death, has been reported in CF patients with pre-
existing cirrhosis with portal hypertension receiving lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor should 
be used with caution in patients with advanced liver disease and only if the benefits are expected to 
outweigh the risks. If lumacaftor/ivacaftor is used in these patients, they should be closely monitored 
after the initiation of treatment and the dose should be reduced (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). 
Hepatobiliary adverse reactions 
Elevated transaminases have been commonly reported in patients with CF receiving 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor. In some instances, these elevations have been associated with concomitant 
elevations in total serum bilirubin. Transaminase elevations have been observed more frequently in 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paediatric patients than in adult patients. Among different age paediatric cohorts, in the 2 to 5 years old 
patients, transaminase elevations have been observed more frequently than in the 6 to less than 12 
years old (see section 4.8). 
Because an association with liver injury cannot be excluded, assessments of liver function tests (ALT, 
AST and bilirubin) are recommended before initiating lumacaftor/ivacaftor, every 3 months during the 
first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of ALT, AST, or bilirubin 
elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. 
In the event of significant elevation of ALT or AST, with or without elevated bilirubin (either ALT or 
AST > 5 x the upper limit of normal [ULN], or ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with bilirubin > 2 x ULN 
and/or clinical jaundice), dosing with lumacaftor/ivacaftor should be discontinued and laboratory tests 
closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. A thorough investigation of potential causes should 
be conducted and patients should be followed closely for clinical progression. Following resolution of 
transaminase elevations, the benefits and risks of resuming dosing should be considered (see 
sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). 
Interactions with medicinal products 
Substrates of CYP3A 
Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Co-administration with sensitive CYP3A substrates or 
CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable, should not be relied 
upon as an effective method of contraception when co-administered with Orkambi (see section 4.5). 
Strong CYP3A inducers 
Ivacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A  
inducers (e.g., rifampicin, St. John’s wort [Hypericum perforatum]) is not recommended (see 
section 4.5). 
Renal impairment 
Caution is recommended while using lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with severe renal impairment or 
end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Cataracts 
Cases of non-congenital lens opacities without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric 
patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor monotherapy. Although other risk factors were 
present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable 
to ivacaftor cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological 
examinations are recommended in paediatric patients initiating treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. 
Patients after organ transplantation 
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ 
transplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for 
interactions with immunosuppressants. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Based on exposure and indicated doses, the interaction profile is considered to be the same for all 
strengths and pharmaceutical forms. 
Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A and ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A when given as 
monotherapy. There is potential for other medicinal products to affect lumacaftor/ivacaftor when 
administered concomitantly, and also for lumacaftor/ivacaftor to affect other medicinal products. 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
Inhibitors of CYP3A 
Co-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, did not impact 
the exposure of lumacaftor, but increased ivacaftor exposure by 4.3-fold. Due to the induction effect of 
lumacaftor on CYP3A, at steady-state, the net exposure of ivacaftor when co-administered with a 
CYP3A inhibitor is not expected to exceed that when given in the absence of lumacaftor at a dose of 
150 mg every 12 hours, the approved dose of ivacaftor monotherapy.  
No dose adjustment is necessary when CYP3A inhibitors are initiated in patients currently taking 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor. However, when initiating lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients taking strong CYP3A 
inhibitors, the dose should be adjusted (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
No dose adjustment is recommended when used with moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitors. 
Inducers of CYP3A 
Co-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, had minimal 
effect on the exposure of lumacaftor, but decreased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by 57%. Therefore, 
co-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor is not recommended with strong CYP3A inducers (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
No dose adjustment is recommended when used with moderate or weak CYP3A inducers. 
Potential for lumacaftor/ivacaftor to affect other medicinal products 
CYP3A substrates 
Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A when given as 
monotherapy. The net effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy is expected to be strong CYP3A 
induction. Therefore, concomitant use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with CYP3A substrates may decrease 
the exposure of these substrates (see section 4.4). 
P-gp substrates 
In vitro studies indicated that lumacaftor has the potential to both inhibit and induce P-gp. 
Additionally, a clinical study with ivacaftor monotherapy showed that ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of 
P-gp. Therefore, concomitant use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with P-gp substrates (e.g., digoxin) may alter 
the exposure of these substrates. 
CYP2B6 and CYP2C substrates 
Interaction with CYP2B6 and CYP2C substrates has not been investigated in vivo. In vitro studies 
suggest that lumacaftor has the potential to induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19; 
however, inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 has also been observed in vitro. Additionally, in vitro 
studies suggest that ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, concomitant use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
may alter (i.e., either increase or decrease) the exposure of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 substrates, decrease 
the exposure of CYP2C19 substrates, and substantially decrease the exposure of CYP2B6 substrates. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Potential for lumacaftor/ivacaftor to interact with transporters 
In vitro experiments show that lumacaftor is a substrate for Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). 
Co-administration of Orkambi with medicinal products that inhibit BCRP may increase plasma 
lumacaftor concentration. Lumacaftor inhibits the organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 and 3. 
Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are inhibitors of BCRP. Co-administration of Orkambi with medicinal 
products that are substrates for OAT1/3 and BCRP transport may increase plasma concentrations of 
such medicinal products. Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are not inhibitors of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and 
organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and 2. Ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3. 
Established and other potentially significant interactions 
Table 4 provides the established or predicted effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on other medicinal 
products or the effect of other medicinal products on lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The information reported in 
Table 4 mostly derives from in vitro studies. The recommendations provided under “Clinical 
comment” in Table 4 are based on interaction studies, clinical relevance, or predicted interactions due 
to elimination pathways. Interactions that have the most clinical relevance are listed first.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor in pregnant women. Animal studies with lumacaftor and ivacaftor do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to developmental and reproductive toxicity, whereas 
effects were noted with ivacaftor only at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor during pregnancy unless the clinical 
condition of the mother requires treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether lumacaftor and/or ivacaftor and metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of both lumacaftor and ivacaftor into 
the milk of lactating female rats. As such, risks to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision 
must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the 
benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effects of lumacaftor and/or ivacaftor on fertility are available. Lumacaftor had 
no effects on fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats. Ivacaftor impaired 
fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ivacaftor, which is one of the active components of Orkambi, has a minor influence on the ability to 
drive and use machines. Ivacaftor may cause dizziness (see section 4.8). 
Patients experiencing dizziness while taking Orkambi should be advised not to drive or use machines 
until symptoms abate. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions are dyspnoea (14.0%), diarrhoea (11.0%), and nausea (10.2%). 
Serious adverse reactions included hepatobiliary events, e.g., transaminase elevations (0.5%), 
cholestatic hepatitis (0.3%) and hepatic encephalopathy (0.1%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions identified from the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies (trials 809-103 and 
809-104) in patients aged 12 years and older and from a 24-week, placebo-controlled study in patients 
aged 6 to less than 12 years (trial 809-109), who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the 
CFTR gene are presented in Table 5 and are listed by system organ class and frequency. Adverse 
reactions observed with ivacaftor alone are also provided in Table 5. Adverse reactions are ranked 
under the MedDRA frequency classification: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); 
uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000); and not 
known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).

The safety data from 1,029 patients aged 12 years and older who were homozygous for the F508del 
mutation in the CFTR gene treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor for up to an additional 96 weeks in the 
long-term safety and efficacy rollover study (trial 809-105) were similar to the 24-week, 
placebo-controlled studies (see section 5.1). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hepatobiliary adverse reactions 
During trials 809-103 and 809-104, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, 
> 5, and > 3 x ULN was 0.8%, 2.0%, and 5.2%, and 0.5%, 1.9%, and 5.1% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor- 
and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The incidence of transaminase-related adverse reactions was 
5.1% and 4.6% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients and those who received placebo, respectively. 
Seven patients who received lumacaftor/ivacaftor had liver-related serious adverse reactions with 
elevated transaminases, including 3 with concurrent elevation in total bilirubin. Following 
discontinuation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor, liver function tests returned to baseline or improved 
substantially in all patients (see section 4.4). 
Among 7 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension who received 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor in the placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, worsening liver function with 
increased ALT, AST, bilirubin, and hepatic encephalopathy was observed in one patient. The event 
occurred within 5 days of the start of dosing and resolved following discontinuation of 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor (see section 4.4). 
Post–marketing cases of liver function decompensation including liver failure leading to death have 
been reported in CF patients with pre-existing cirrhosis with portal hypertension who were treated with 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor (see section 4.4). 
Respiratory adverse reactions 
During trials 809-103 and 809-104, the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions (e.g., chest 
discomfort, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, and respiration abnormal) was 26.3% in 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients compared to 17.0% in patients who received placebo. The 
incidence of these adverse reactions was more common in patients with lower pre-treatment FEV1. 
Approximately three-quarters of the adverse reactions began during the first week of treatment, and in 
most patients the events resolved without dosing interruption. The majority of events were mild or 
moderate in severity, non-serious and did not result in treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). 
During a 24-week, open-label, Phase 3b clinical study (trial 809-011 [Part B]) in 46 patients aged 12 
years and older with advanced lung disease (ppFEV1 < 40) [mean ppFEV1 29.1 at baseline (range: 
18.3 to 42.0)], the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions was 65.2%. In the subgroup of 28 patients 
who were initiated at the full dose of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (2 tablets every 12 hours), the incidence was 
71.4%, and in the 18 patients who were initiated at a reduced dose of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (1 tablet 
every 12 hours for up to 2 weeks, and subsequently increased to the full dose), the incidence was 
55.6%. Of the patients who were initiated lumacaftor/ivacaftor at the full dose, one patient had a 
serious respiratory adverse reaction, three patients subsequently had their dose reduced, and three 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients discontinued treatment. No serious respiratory adverse reactions, dose reductions or 
discontinuations were seen in patients who were initiated at the half dose (see section 4.4). 
Menstrual abnormalities 
During trials 809-103 and 809-104, the incidence of combined menstrual abnormalities (amenorrhoea, 
dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, menstruation irregular, metrorrhagia, oligomenorrhoea, and 
polymenorrhoea) was 9.9% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated female patients and 1.7% in 
placebo-treated females. These menstrual events occurred more frequently in the subset of female 
patients who were taking hormonal contraceptives (25.0%) versus patients who were not taking 
hormonal contraceptives (3.5%) (see section 4.5). Most of these reactions were mild or moderate in 
severity and non-serious. In lumacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients, approximately two-thirds of these 
reactions resolved, and the median duration was 10 days. 
Increased blood pressure 
During trials 809-103 and 809-104, adverse reactions related to increased blood pressure (e.g., 
hypertension, blood pressure increased) were reported in 0.9% (7/738) of patients treated with 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor and in no patients who received placebo. 
In patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor (mean baseline 114 mmHg systolic and 69 mmHg 
diastolic), the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 
3.1 mmHg and 1.8 mmHg, respectively. In patients who received placebo (mean baseline 114 mmHg 
systolic and 69 mmHg diastolic), the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure was 0.9 mmHg and 0.9 mmHg, respectively. 
The proportion of patients who experienced a systolic blood pressure value > 140 mmHg or a diastolic 
blood pressure > 90 mmHg on at least two occasions was 3.4% and 1.5% in patients treated with 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor, respectively, compared with 1.6% and 0.5% in patients who received placebo 
(see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety data of lumacaftor/ivacaftor were evaluated in 46 patients aged 1 to less than 2 years (trial 
809-122), 60 patients aged 2 to 5 years (trial 809-115), 161 patients aged 6 to  less than 12 years (trials 
809-011 and 809-109) and in 194 patients aged 12 to 17 years with CF who are homozygous for the 
F508del mutation and who received lumacaftor/ivacaftor in clinical studies. Patients aged 12 to 
17 years were included in trials 809-103 and 809-104.  
The overall safety profile in these paediatric patients is generally consistent with that in adult patients. 
Few selected adverse reactions are specifically reported in the paediatric population. 
Long-term safety data from a 96-week rollover extension study in 57 patients aged 2 years and older 
who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene were generally consistent with the 
24-week parent study in patients aged 2 to 5 years (trial 809-115) and safety data in patients aged 6 to 
less than 12 years. 
Long-term safety data from a 96-week rollover extension study in 239 patients aged 6 years and older 
who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (trial 809-110) were generally 
consistent with the 24-week parent studies in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (trial 809-011 and 
trial 809-109). 
Description of selected adverse reactions for paediatric patients aged 1 to less than 12 years 
Hepatobiliary adverse reactions 
During the 24-week, open-label Phase 3 clinical study in 58 patients aged 6 to less than 12 years 
(trial 809-011), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, > 5, and > 3 x ULN

dosing was maintained or successfully resumed after interruption in all patients with transaminase 
elevations, except 1 patient who discontinued treatment. 
During the 24-week, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study in 204 patients aged 6 to less than 12 
years (trial 809-109), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, > 5, and 
> 3 x ULN was 1.0%, 4.9%, and 12.6% in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor patients, and 2.0%, 3.0%, and 7.9% 
in the placebo-treated patients. No patients had total bilirubin levels > 2 x ULN. Two patients in the 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor group and two patients in the placebo group discontinued treatment due to 
transaminase elevations. 
During the 24-week, open-label Phase 3 clinical study in 60 patients aged 2 through 5 years (trial 809-
115), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, > 5, and > 3 x ULN was 8.3% 
(5/60), 11.7% (7/60), and 15.0% (9/60). No patients had total bilirubin levels > 2 x ULN. Three 
patients discontinued lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment due to transaminase elevations. 
During the 24-week, open-label Phase 3 clinical study in 46 patients aged 1 to less than 2 years (trial 
809-122), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels > 8, > 5, and > 3 x ULN was 
2.2% (1/46), 4.3% (2/46), and 10.9% (5/46). No patients had total bilirubin levels > 2 x ULN. One 
patient discontinued lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment due to transaminase elevations. 
Respiratory adverse reactions 
During the 24-week, open-label Phase 3 clinical study (trial 809-011) in 58 patients aged 6 toless than 
12 years (mean baseline ppFEV1 was 91.4), the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions was 6.9% 
(4/58). 
During the 24-week, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study (trial 809-109) in patients aged 6 to less 
than 12 years (mean baseline ppFEV1 was 89.8), the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions was 
18.4% in lumacaftor/ivacaftor patients and 12.9% in placebo patients. A decline in ppFEV1 at 
initiation of therapy was observed during serial post dose spirometry assessments. The absolute change 
from pre-dose at 4 to 6 hours post-dose was -7.7 on day 1 and -1.3 on day 15 in lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
patients. The post-dose decline was resolved by week 16. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No specific antidote is available for overdose with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Treatment of overdose 
consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the 
clinical status of the patient. 
Adverse reactions that occurred at an increased incidence of ≥ 5% in the supratherapeutic dose period 
compared with the therapeutic dose period were headache, generalised rash, and increased 
transaminase.

Mechanism of action 
The CFTR protein is a chloride channel present at the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. 
The F508del mutation impacts the CFTR protein in multiple ways, primarily by causing a defect in 
cellular processing and trafficking that reduces the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. The small 
amount of F508del-CFTR that reaches the cell surface has low channel-open probability (defective 
channel gating). Lumacaftor is a CFTR corrector that acts directly on F508del-CFTR to improve its 
cellular processing and trafficking, thereby increasing the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell 
surface. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the 
channel-open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The combined effect of 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface, 
resulting in increased chloride ion transport. The exact mechanisms by which lumacaftor improves 
cellular processing and trafficking of F508del-CFTR and ivacaftor potentiates F508del-CFTR are not 
known. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Effects on sweat chloride 
Changes in sweat chloride in response to lumacaftor alone or in combination with ivacaftor were 
evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with CF aged 18 years 
and older. In this trial, 10 patients (homozygous for F508del-CFTR mutation) completed dosing with 
lumacaftor alone 400 mg q12h for 28 days followed by the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h for an 
additional 28 days, and 25 patients (homozygous or heterozygous for F508del) completed dosing with 
placebo. The treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg q12h alone and placebo evaluated as 
mean change in sweat chloride from baseline to day 28 was statistically significant at -8.2 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -14, -2). The treatment difference between the combination of lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 
250 mg q12h and placebo evaluated as mean change in sweat chloride from baseline to day 56 was 
statistically significant at -11 mmol/L (95% CI: -18, -4). 
In trial 809-109 in patients homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation aged 6 to less than 12 years, 
the treatment difference (LS mean) in sweat chloride for the absolute change at week 24 as compared 
to placebo was -24.9 mmol/L (nominal P < 0.0001). The treatment difference (LS mean) in sweat 
chloride for the average absolute change at day 15 and at week 4 as compared to placebo 
was -20.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -23.4, -18.2; nominal P < 0.0001).  
In trial 809-115 in patients homozygous for F508del-CFTR mutation aged 2 to 5 years, the mean 
absolute within-group change in sweat chloride from baseline at week 24 was -31.7 mmol/L (95% 
CI: -35.7, -27.6). In addition, the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from week 24 at week 26 
following the 2-week washout period (to evaluate off-drug response) was an increase of 33.0 mmol/L 
(95% CI: 28.9, 37.1; nominal P < 0.0001), representing a return to baseline after treatment washout. At 
week 24, 16% of children had a reduction in sweat chloride below 60 mmol/L, and none below 
30 mmol/L. 
In trial 809-122 in patients homozygous for F508del-CFTR mutation aged 1 to less than 2 years, 
treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor demonstrated a reduction in sweat chloride at week 4 which was 
sustained through week 24. The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at week 24 
was -29.1(13.5) mmol/L (95% CI: - 34.8, -23.4). In addition, the mean (SD) absolute change in sweat 
chloride from week 24 at week 26 following the 2-week washout period was 27.3 (11.1) mmol/L (95% 
CI: 22.3, 32.3). This change represents a return towards baseline after treatment washout. 
Changes in FEV1 
Changes in ppFEV1 in response to lumacaftor alone or in combination with ivacaftor were also 
evaluated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial in patients with CF aged 18 years and 
older. The treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg q12h alone and placebo evaluated as mean 
absolute change in ppFEV1 was -4.6 percentage points (95% CI: -9.6, 0.4) from baseline to day 28, 4.2 
percentage points (95% CI: –1.3, 9.7) from baseline to day 56, and 7.7 percentage points (95% CI: 2.6, 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12.8; statistically significant) from day 28 to day 56 (following the addition of ivacaftor to lumacaftor 
monotherapy). 
Decrease in heart rate 
During the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, a maximum decrease in mean heart rate of 
6 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline was observed on day 1 and day 15 around 4 to 6 hours after 
dosing. After day 15, heart rate was not monitored in the period after dosing in these studies. From 
week 4, the change in mean heart rate at pre-dose ranged from 1 to 2 bpm below baseline among 
patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The percentage of patients with heart rate values < 50 bpm 
on treatment was 11% for patients who received lumacaftor/ivacaftor, compared to 4.9% for patients 
who received placebo. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
No meaningful changes in QTc interval or blood pressure were observed in a thorough QT clinical 
study evaluating lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and lumacaftor 1000 mg once 
daily/ivacaftor 450 mg q12h. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Trials in patients with CF aged 12 years and above who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in 
the CFTR gene 
The efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation in the CFTR gene was evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical 
trials of 1,108 clinically stable patients with CF, in which 737 patients were randomised to and dosed 
with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Patients in both trials were randomised 1:1:1 to receive lumacaftor 600 mg 
once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, or placebo. 
Patients took the study drug with fat-containing food for 24 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF 
therapies (e.g., bronchodilators, inhaled antibiotics, dornase alfa, and hypertonic saline). Patients from 
these trials were eligible to roll over into a blinded extension study. 
Trial 809-103 evaluated 549 patients with CF who were aged 12 years and older (mean age 25.1 years) 
with percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) at screening between 40-90 (mean ppFEV1 60.7 at baseline 
[range: 31.1 to 94.0]). Trial 809-104 evaluated 559 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 25.0 
years) with ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90 (mean ppFEV1 60.5 at baseline [range: 31.3 to 99.8]). 
Patients with a history of colonisation with organisms such as Burkholderia cenocepacia, 
Burkholderia dolosa, or Mycobacterium abscessus or who had 3 or more abnormal liver function tests 
(ALT, AST, AP, GGT ≥ 3 times the ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 2 times the ULN) were excluded. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at 
week 24. Other efficacy variables included relative change from baseline in ppFEV1, absolute change 
from baseline in BMI, absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain, the proportion of 
patients achieving ≥ 5% relative change from baseline in ppFEV1 at week 24, and the number of 
pulmonary exacerbations (including those requiring hospitalisation or IV antibiotic therapy) through 
week 24. 
In both trials, treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor resulted in a statistically significant improvement in 
ppFEV1 (see Table 6). Mean improvement in ppFEV1 was rapid in onset (day 15) and sustained 
throughout the 24-week treatment period. At day 15, the treatment difference between lumacaftor 
400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in ppFEV1 from 
baseline was 2.51 percentage points in the pooled trials 809-103 and 809-104 (P < 0.0001). 
Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, disease severity, sex and geographic 
region. The Phase 3 trials of lumacaftor/ivacaftor included 81 patients with ppFEV1 < 40 at baseline. 
The treatment difference in this subgroup was comparable to that observed in patients with 
ppFEV1 ≥ 40. At week 24, the treatment difference between lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h 
and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in ppFEV1 from baseline in the pooled trials 809-
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
103 and 809-104 were 3.39 percentage points (P = 0.0382) for patients with ppFEV1 < 40 and 2.47 
percentage points (P < 0.0001) for patients with ppFEV1 ≥ 40.

At week 24, the proportion of patients who remained free from pulmonary exacerbations was 
significantly higher for patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor compared with placebo. In the 
pooled analysis, the rate ratio of exacerbations through week 24 in subjects treated with 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor (lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h; n = 369) was 0.61 (P < 0.0001), 
representing a reduction of 39% relative to placebo. The event rate per year, annualised to 48 weeks, 
was 0.70 in the lumacaftor/ivacaftor group and 1.14 in the placebo group. Treatment with 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor significantly decreased the risk for exacerbations requiring hospitalisation versus 
placebo by 61% (rate ratio = 0.39, P < 0.0001; event rate per 48 weeks 0.17 for lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
and 0.45 for placebo) and reduced exacerbations requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics by 
56% (rate ratio = 0.44, P < 0.0001; event rate per 48 weeks 0.25 for lumacaftor/ivacaftor and 0.58 for 
placebo). These results were not considered statistically significant within the framework of the testing 
hierarchy for the individual studies. 
Long-term safety and efficacy rollover trial 
Trial 809-105 was a Phase 3, parallel-group, multicentre, rollover extension study in patients with CF 
that included patients aged 12 years and older from trial 809-103 and trial 809-104. This extension trial 
was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Of the 
1,108 patients who received any treatment in trial 809-103 or trial 809-104, 1,029 (93%) were dosed 
and received active treatment (lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h or lumacaftor 
400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h) in trial 809-105 for up to an additional 96 weeks (i.e., up to a 
total of 120 weeks). The primary efficacy analysis of this extension study included data up to week 72 
of trial 809-105 with a sensitivity analysis that included data up to week 96 of trial 809-105.  
Patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in trial 809-103 or trial 809-104 showed an effect that was 
maintained with respect to baseline after an additional 96 weeks through trial 809-105. For patients 
who transitioned from placebo to active treatment similar changes as those observed in patients treated 
with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in trial 809-103 or trial 809-104 were seen (see Table 6). Results from trial 
809-105 are presented in Figure 1 and Table 7.

Trial in patients with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene 
Trial 809-102 was a multicentre, double–blind, randomised, placebo–controlled, Phase 2 trial in 
125 patients with CF aged 18 years and older who had a ppFEV1 of 40 to 90, inclusive, and have the 
F508del mutation on one allele plus a second allele with a mutation predicted to result in the lack of 
CFTR production or a CFTR that is not responsive to ivacaftor in vitro. 
Patients received either lumacaftor/ivacaftor (n = 62) or placebo (n = 63) in addition to their prescribed 
CF therapies. The primary endpoint was improvement in lung function as determined by the mean 
absolute change from baseline at day 56 in ppFEV1. Treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor resulted in no 
significant improvement in ppFEV1 relative to placebo in patients with CF heterozygous for the 
F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (treatment difference 0.60 [P = 0.5978]) and no meaningful 
improvements in BMI or weight (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Trials in patients with CF aged 6 to less than 12 years old who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation in the CFTR gene 
Trial 809-109 was a 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical study in 204 patients with CF aged 
6 to less than 12 years old (mean age 8.8 years). Trial 809-109 evaluated subjects with lung clearance 
index (LCI2.5) ≥ 7.5 at the initial screening visit (mean LCI2.5 10.28 at baseline [range: 6.55 to 16.38]) 
and ppFEV1 ≥ 70 at screening (mean ppFEV1 89.8 at baseline [range: 48.6 to 119.6]). Patients received 
either lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 hours (n = 103) or placebo (n = 101) in addition 
to their prescribed CF therapies. Patients who had 2 or more abnormal liver function tests (ALT, AST, 
AP, GGT ≥ 3 times the ULN), or ALT or AST > 5 times ULN, or total bilirubin > 2 times ULN were 
excluded. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 24. Key 
secondary endpoints included average absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at day 15 and 
week 4 and at week 24 (see Pharmacodynamic effects), absolute change from baseline in BMI at 
week 24, absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain through week 24. These 
results are presented in Table 8 below:

Percent predicted FEV1 was also evaluated as a clinically meaningful other secondary endpoint. In the 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor patients, the treatment difference for absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline 
through week 24 was 2.4 (P = 0.0182). 
Patients with CF aged 6 years and older from trial 809-011 and trial 809-109 were included in a 
phase 3, multicentre, rollover extension study (trial -809-110). This extension trial was designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Of the 262 patients 
who received any treatment in trial 809-011 or trial 809-109, 239 (91%) were dosed and received 
active treatment (patients 6 to less than 12 years of age received lumacaftor 200 mg q12h/ivacaftor 
250 mg q12h; patients ≥12 years of age received lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h) in 
the extension study for up to an additional 96 weeks (i.e., up to a total of 120 weeks) (see section 4.8).

Trial 809-115: Safety and tolerability study in paediatric patients with CF aged 2 to 5 years 
homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene 
Trial 809-115 evaluated 60 patients aged 2 to 5 years at screening (mean age at baseline 3.7 years). 
According to their weight at screening, patients were administered granules mixed with food every 12 
hours, at a dose of lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg granules for patients weighing less than14 kg 
(n = 19) or lumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg for patients weighing 14 kg or greater (n = 41), for 
24 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies. In order to evaluate off drug effects, patients had 
a safety follow-up visit following a 2-week washout period. 
Secondary endpoints included absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at week 24 and 
absolute change in sweat chloride from week 24 at week 26 (see Pharmacodynamic effects) as well as 
the endpoints listed in Table 10. The clinical relevance of the magnitude of these changes in children 
aged 2 to 5 years with cystic fibrosis has not been clearly ascertained in longer-term treatment.

Trial 809-122: Safety and tolerability study in paediatric patients with CF aged 1 to less than 2 years 
homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene 
In Trial 809-122 Part B the primary endpoint of safety and tolerability was evaluated in 46 patients 
across 24 weeks (mean age at baseline 18.1 months). Secondary endpoints evaluated were 
pharmacokinetics and absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at week 24 (see 
Pharmacodynamic effects). According to their weight at screening, patients were administered 
granules mixed with food every 12 hours for 24 weeks, at a dose of lumacaftor 75 mg/ivacaftor 94 mg 
granules (patients weighing 7 kg to <9 kg) or lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg granules (patients 
weighing 9 kg to <14 kg) or 150 mg lumacaftor/188 mg ivacaftor granules (patients weighing ≥14 kg), 
in addition to their prescribed CF therapies. In order to evaluate off-drug effects, patients had a safety 
follow-up visit following a 2-week washout period. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Orkambi in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The exposure (AUC) of lumacaftor is approximately 2-fold higher in healthy adult volunteers 
compared to exposure in patients with CF. The exposure of ivacaftor is similar between healthy adult 
volunteers and patients with CF. After twice-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of 
lumacaftor and ivacaftor in healthy subjects were generally reached after approximately 7 days of 
treatment, with an accumulation ratio of approximately 1.9 for lumacaftor. The steady-state exposure 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
of ivacaftor is lower than that of day 1 due to the CYP3A induction effect of lumacaftor (see 
section 4.5). 
After oral administration of lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h in a fed state, the 
steady-state mean (± SD) for AUC0-12h and Cmax were 198 (64.8) µg∙h/mL and 25.0 (7.96) µg/mL for 
lumacaftor, respectively, and 3.66 (2.25) µg∙h/mL and 0.602 (0.304) µg/mL for ivacaftor, respectively. 
After oral administration of ivacaftor alone as 150 mg q12h in a fed state, the steady-state mean (± SD) 
for AUC0-12h and Cmax were 9.08 (3.20) µg∙h/mL and 1.12 (0.319) µg/mL, respectively. 
Absorption 
Following multiple oral doses of lumacaftor, the exposure of lumacaftor generally increased 
proportional to dose over the range of 50 mg to 1000 mg every 24 hours. The exposure of lumacaftor 
increased approximately 2.0-fold when given with fat-containing food relative to fasted conditions. 
The median (range) Tmax of lumacaftor is approximately 4.0 hours (2.0; 9.0) in the fed state. 
Following multiple oral dose administration of ivacaftor in combination with lumacaftor, the exposure 
of ivacaftor generally increased with dose from 150 mg every 12 hours to 250 mg every 12 hours. The 
exposure of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor increased approximately 3-fold 
when given with fat-containing food in healthy volunteers. Therefore, lumacaftor/ivacaftor should be 
administered with fat-containing food. The median (range) Tmax of ivacaftor is approximately 4.0 hours 
(2.0; 6.0) in the fed state. 
Distribution 
Lumacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. After oral 
administration of 400 mg every 12 hours in patients with CF in a fed state, the typical apparent 
volumes of distribution for the central and peripheral compartments [coefficient of variation as a 
percentage (CV)] were estimated to be 23.5 L (48.7%) and 33.3 L (30.5%), respectively. 
Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and 
albumin. After oral administration of ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 hours in combination with lumacaftor, 
the typical apparent volumes of distribution for the central and peripheral compartments (CV) were 
estimated to be 95.0 L (53.9%) and 201 L (26.6%), respectively. 
In vitro studies indicate that lumacaftor is a substrate of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). 
Biotransformation 
Lumacaftor is not extensively metabolised in humans, with the majority of lumacaftor excreted 
unchanged in the faeces. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that lumacaftor is mainly metabolised via 
oxidation and glucuronidation. 
Ivacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is 
primarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. 
M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. 
M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. 
Elimination 
Following oral administration of lumacaftor, the majority of lumacaftor (51%) is excreted unchanged 
in the faeces. There was negligible urinary excretion of lumacaftor as unchanged drug. The apparent 
terminal half-life is approximately 26 hours. The typical apparent clearance, CL/F (CV), of lumacaftor 
was estimated to be 2.38 L/h (29.4%) for patients with CF. 
Following oral administration of ivacaftor alone, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the 
faeces after metabolic conversion. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged 
drug. In healthy subjects, the half-life of ivacaftor when given with lumacaftor is approximately 
9 hours. The typical CL/F (CV) of ivacaftor when given in combination with lumacaftor was estimated 
to be 25.1 L/h (40.5%) for patients with CF.

Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Following multiple doses of lumacaftor/ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired 
hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had higher exposures (AUC0-12h by approximately 
50% and Cmax by approximately 30%) compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. The 
impact of mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5 to 6) on pharmacokinetics of 
lumacaftor given in combination with ivacaftor has not been studied, but the increase in exposure is 
expected to be less than 50%. 
Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, 
score 10 to 15), but exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8). 
Renal impairment 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with renal 
impairment. In a human pharmacokinetic study with lumacaftor alone, there was minimal elimination 
of lumacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 8.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine 
with 0.18% as unchanged parent). In a human pharmacokinetic study with ivacaftor alone, there was 
minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was 
recovered in the urine). A population pharmacokinetic analysis of clearance versus creatinine 
clearance shows no trend for subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment (see section 4.2).  
Elderly 
The safety and efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients aged 65 years or older have not been 
evaluated. 
Gender 
The effect of gender on lumacaftor pharmacokinetics was evaluated using a population 
pharmacokinetics analysis of data from clinical studies of lumacaftor given in combination with 
ivacaftor. Results indicate no clinically relevant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters for 
lumacaftor or ivacaftor between males and females. No dose adjustments are necessary based on 
gender. 
Paediatric population 
The exposures are similar between adults and the paediatric populations based on population PK 
analysis as presented in Table 11.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Lumacaftor 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to 
reproduction and development. Specific studies to evaluate the phototoxic potential of lumacaftor were 
not conducted; however, evaluation of the available non-clinical and clinical data suggests no 
phototoxic liability. 
Ivacaftor 
Effects in repeated dose studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess 
(> 25-, > 45-, and > 35-fold for mice, rats, and dogs, respectively) of the maximum human exposure of 
ivacaftor when administered as Orkambi, indicating little relevance to clinical use. Non-clinical data 
reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity and carcinogenic 
potential. 
Safety pharmacology 
Ivacaftor produced concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on hERG (human ether-à-go-go related 
gene) tail currents, with an IC15 of 5.5 µM, compared to the Cmax (1.5 µM) for ivacaftor at the 
therapeutic dose for lumacaftor/ivacaftor. However, no ivacaftor-induced QT prolongation was 
observed in a dog telemetry study at single doses up to 60 mg/kg or in ECG measurements from 
repeat-dose studies of up to 1 year duration at the 60 mg/kg/day dose level in dogs (Cmax after 
365 days = 36.2 to 47.6 μM). Ivacaftor produced a dose-related but transient increase in the blood 
pressure parameters in dogs at single oral doses up to 60 mg/kg (see section 5.1).  
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and fertility 
Ivacaftor was not teratogenic when dosed orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the organogenesis 
stage of foetal development at doses approximately 7 times (ivacaftor and metabolite exposure) and 
46 times the ivacaftor exposure in humans at the therapeutic lumacaftor/ivacaftor dose, respectively. 
At maternally toxic doses in rats, ivacaftor produced reductions in foetal body weight; an increase in 
the incidence of variations in cervical ribs, hypoplastic ribs, and wavy ribs; and sternal irregularities, 
including fusions. The significance of these findings for humans is unknown. 
Ivacaftor impaired fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at 
200 mg/kg/day (yielding exposures approximately 11 and 7 times, respectively, those obtained with 
the maximum recommended human dose of the ivacaftor component of Orkambi based on summed 
AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites extrapolated from day 90 exposures at 150 mg/kg/day in the 
6-month repeat-dose toxicity study and gestation day 17 exposures in the pilot embryofoetal 
development study in this species) when dams were dosed prior to and during early pregnancy. No 
effects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance indices were observed at 
≤ 100 mg/kg/day (yielding exposures approximately 8 and 5 times, respectively, those obtained with 
the maximum recommended human dose of the ivacaftor component of Orkambi based on summed 
AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites extrapolated from day 90 exposures at 100 mg/kg/day in the 
6-month repeat-dose toxicity study and gestation day 17 exposures in the embryofoetal development 
study in this species). Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. 
Peri- and post-natal development 
Ivacaftor did not cause developmental defects in the offspring of pregnant rats dosed orally from 
pregnancy through parturition and weaning at 100 mg/kg/day (yielding exposures that were 
approximately 4 times those obtained with the maximum recommended human dose of the ivacaftor 
component of Orkambi based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Doses above 
100 mg/kg/day resulted in survival and lactation indices that were 92% and 98% of control values, 
respectively, as well as reductions in pup body weights. 
Juvenile animals 
Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed with ivacaftor at 0.32 times the maximum 
recommended human dose based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when 
co-administered with lumacaftor as Orkambi. Cataracts were not observed in foetuses derived from rat 
dams treated during the organogenesis stage of foetal development, in rat pups exposed to a certain 
extent through milk ingestion prior to weaning, or in repeated dose toxicity studies with ivacaftor. The 
potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown. 
Lumacaftor and ivacaftor 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies involving the co-administration of lumacaftor and ivacaftor revealed no 
special hazard for humans in terms of potential for additive and/or synergistic toxicities.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Orkambi is and what it is used for 
Orkambi contains two active substances, lumacaftor and ivacaftor. It is a medicine used for long-term 
treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have a specific change (called 
F508del mutation) affecting the gene for a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR), which plays an important role in regulating the flow of mucus in the lungs. People 
with the mutation will produce an abnormal CFTR protein. Cells contain two copies of the CFTR 
gene; Orkambi is used in patients in whom both copies are affected by the F508del mutation 
(homozygotes). 
Lumacaftor and ivacaftor work together to improve the function of the abnormal CFTR protein. 
Lumacaftor increases the amount of CFTR available and ivacaftor helps the abnormal protein to work 
more normally.  
Orkambi may help your breathing by improving your lung function. You may also notice that it is 
easier to gain weight. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Orkambi 
Do not take Orkambi 
• 
if you are allergic to lumacaftor, ivacaftor, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Orkambi. 
Orkambi should not be used in patients other than those who have two copies of the F508del 
mutation in their CFTR gene. 
Talk to your doctor before taking Orkambi if you have been told you have liver or kidney disease as 
your doctor may need to adjust the dose of Orkambi. 
91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abnormal blood tests of the liver have been commonly seen in some people receiving Orkambi. Tell 
your doctor straight away if you have any of these symptoms, which may be a sign of liver problems:

seen in patients when starting Orkambi, especially in patients who have poor lung function. If you 
have poor lung function your doctor may monitor you more closely when you start Orkambi.

Orkambi). Your doctor may perform some eye examinations prior to and during treatment with 
Orkambi.  
Orkambi is not recommended in patients who have undergone an organ transplant.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. It may be better to avoid using Orkambi during 
pregnancy, if possible, and your doctor will help you decide what is best for you and your child. 
It is unknown if lumacaftor or ivacaftor are found in human milk. If you plan to breast-feed, ask your 
doctor for advice before taking Orkambi. Your doctor will decide whether to recommend that you stop 
breast-feeding or for you to stop lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy. Your doctor will take into account the 
benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for you. 
Driving and using machines 
Dizziness has been reported in patients receiving ivacaftor, a component of Orkambi, which could 
influence the ability to drive or use machines. If you experience dizziness, you should not drive or use 
machines until these symptoms disappear.

bike or do anything else that needs their full attention, until their symptoms disappear.

function. 
•  Moderate liver problems: the dose may be reduced to two tablets in the morning and one tablet 
• 
in the evening.  
Severe liver problems: the dose may be reduced to one tablet in the morning and one tablet in 
the evening. Your doctor may decide to reduce the frequency of administration based on clinical 
response and tolerability. 
Method of administration 
Orkambi is for oral use. Swallow the tablets whole. Do not chew, break, or dissolve the tablets.  
Taking Orkambi with fat-containing food is important to get the right levels of medicine in your 
body. A fat-containing meal or snack should be consumed just before or just after taking Orkambi.

If a child experiences dizziness while taking Orkambi, it is advised that the child does not ride a 
bike or do anything else that needs their full attention, until their symptoms disappear. 
Orkambi contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.

If your child has moderate or severe problems with liver function, your child’s doctor may need to 
reduce the dose of Orkambi as your child’s liver will not clear Orkambi as fast as in children who have 
normal liver function. 
•  Moderate liver problems: the dose may be reduced to one sachet per day in the morning and 
• 
one sachet every other day in the evening. 
Severe liver problems: the dose may be reduced to one sachet per day or less frequently in the 
morning. No dose should be administered in the evening. 
Method of administration 
Orkambi is for oral use.  
Each sachet is for single use only. 
You may start giving your child Orkambi on any day of the week. 
Giving Orkambi granules to your child: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hold sachet of granules with cut line on top. 
Shake sachet gently to settle contents. 
Tear or cut sachet open along the line. 
Mix the entire contents of a sachet with one teaspoon (5 mL) of age-appropriate soft food or 
liquid. Food or liquid should be at room temperature or below. Some examples of age-
appropriate soft foods and liquids include puréed fruits or vegetables, flavoured yogurt, 
applesauce, water, milk, breast milk, infant formulae or juice. 
Once mixed, give the product to your child immediately. If this is not possible, give it within the 
hour after mixing. Make sure that the mixture is consumed immediately and completely. 
Food containing fat should be given to your child just before or just after dosing (some 
examples are provided below). 
Taking Orkambi with fat-containing food is important to get the right levels of medicine in the 
body. Meals and snacks recommended in CF guidelines or meals recommended in standard nutritional 
guidelines contain adequate amounts of fat. Examples of meals or snacks that contain fat are those 
prepared with butter or oils or those containing eggs. Examples of other fat-containing foods are: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Cheese, breast milk, infant formula, whole milk, whole-milk dairy products 
Meats, oily fish 
Avocados, hummus, soy-based products (tofu) 
Nutritional bars or drinks

If your child takes more Orkambi than he/she should 
Contact your child’s doctor or pharmacist for advice. If possible, have your child’s medicine and this 
leaflet with you. Your child may experience side effects, including those mentioned in section 4 
below. 
If you forget to give your child Orkambi 
Give the missed dose with fat-containing food if less than 6 hours have passed since the time your 
child missed the dose. Otherwise, wait until your child’s next scheduled dose as you normally would. 
Do not give your child a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop giving your child Orkambi 
Give Orkambi to your child for as long as your child’s doctor recommends. Do not stop unless your 
child’s doctor advises you to. You should keep giving the medicine as the doctor directs even if the 
child feels well. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child’s doctor or pharmacist.

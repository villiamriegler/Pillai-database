Summary of risk management plan for Vizimpro 
This is a summary of the RMP for Vizimpro.  The RMP details the important risk of Vizimpro, 
how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about the risks 
and uncertainties (missing information). Routine risk assessment and risk minimization are 
considered sufficient to address the important risks.  
Vizimpro’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet provide essential 
information to Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) and patients on how dacomitinib should be used.   
This summary of the RMP for Vizimpro should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Vizimpro's 
RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What it is Used for 
Vizimpro is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors stop tyrosine kinases from 
working.  Tyrosine kinases are enzymes that are responsible for activating many proteins in the 
body’s cells causing cancer cells to grow and multiply.   
Vizimpro is authorised for first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR-activating mutations (see SmPC for 
the full indication).  Dacomitinib is the active substance to be taken orally. The recommended 
starting dose of dacomitinib is 45 mg taken once daily.  
Further information about the evaluation of Vizimpro’s benefits can be found in dacomitinib’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage.

II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further Characterize 
the Risks 
Important risks of Vizimpro, together with measures to minimise such risks are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products are: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
 
 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient with prescription 
to help minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Vizimpro is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Vizimpro are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Vizimpro.  Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Dacomitinib nonclinical and clinical studies.   
Important Identified Risk: Diarrhoea  
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
Risk factors and 
risk groups: 
Factors that could potentially be associated with an increased risk of diarrhoea include 
antibiotic use, side effects of other medications, intestinal abnormalities, food intolerance, 
and/or general wasting syndromes associated with cancer. 
Routine risk minimisation measures:

Important Potential Risk: Hepatotoxicity 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine: 
Risk factors and 
risk groups: 
Risk factors for drug-induced hepatotoxicity encompass a number of drug categories such 
as antimicrobials, drugs acting on the central nervous system, cardiovascular, 
rheumatologic, antineoplastic, and endocrine. Although no risk specific risk groups or risk 
factors have been identified with dacomitinib treatment, patients with prior history of 
hepatic disease or hepatitis before treatment may be at increased risk.    
Routine risk minimisation measures:  
SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 (transaminases increased) 
Risk minimisation 
measures: 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
None 
Dacomitinib nonclinical studies, other EGFR TKI nonclinical studies and literature. 
Important Potential Risk: Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity 
Evidence for

Risk factors and risk groups include women of childbearing potential, pregnant women, 
and lactating women.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired immune mediated disorder characterized by isolated 
thrombocytopenia, defined as a peripheral blood platelet count less than 100 x 109/L, impairment of platelet 
production, a variable bleeding tendency and the absence of any underlying cause. Until recently, the 
abbreviation ITP stood for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, but due to the current knowledge of the 
immune mediated mechanism of the disease, and the absence or minimal signs of bleeding in most cases, 
have led to a revision of the terminology.* 
ITP is classified by duration into newly diagnosed, persistent (3-12 months’ duration) and chronic (≥ 12 
months’ duration). Whereas ITP in adults typically has an insidious onset with no preceding viral or other 
illness and it normally follows a chronic course, ITP in children is usually short-lived with at least two-thirds 
recovering spontaneously within 6 months (See Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products 
intended for the treatment of chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia, EMA/CHMP/153191/2013, 
Oncology Working Party) 
The proposed indication by the applicant is as follows: 
Tavlesse is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic or persistent 
immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The reported incidence data for ITP in the European Union (EU) ranges from 1.6 to 4.4 per 100,000 (Moulis 
2014; Schoonen 2009; Neylon 2003; Frederiksen 1999). The prevalence is 9.5 per 100,000 adults (Lambert 
and Gernsheimer, 2017). Secondary ITP constitutes around 20% of ITP diagnoses (Cines et al, 2009) but this 
group is not part of the intended indication. There is an increasing incidence with older age and equal for the 
sexes except in the mid-adult years (30-60 years), when the disease is more prevalent in women. Childhood 
ITP has an incidence of between 1.9 and 6.4 per 100,000 per year with equal distribution between the sexes. 
There are an estimated 50,000 adult patients with chronic ITP in the EU (Gernsheimer 2008). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Primary ITP in adults has no known trigger or obvious cause. 
ITP is characterized by immune-mediated thrombocytopenia resulting from increased clearance of normal 
platelets and decreased platelet production 
Fcγ receptor (FcγR) signaling in monocytes and macrophages plays an important role in the initiation and 
propagation of autoimmune responses. The activating FcγR is associated with a signaling subunit, referred to 
as the FcRγ chain, whose phosphorylation subsequent to receptor activation results in the recruitment and 
activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK). Spleen tyrosine kinase is an important component of the signaling 
system of activated Fc receptors, as well as the B-cell receptor (BCR). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 11/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Aggregation of the Fc receptors, induced by antibody-antigen complexes, can induce a multitude of cellular 
functions (including degranulation, arachidonic acid metabolism, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, 
phagocytosis and cytokine secretion) depending on the cell type, and leads to tissue damage and the 
propagation of inflammatory responses. FcγR have been implicated in immune destruction of platelets. 
Accelerated clearance of circulating IgG-coated platelets via Fcγ receptor-bearing macrophages in the spleen 
and liver is a key mechanism in ITP. 
According to Lambert and Gernsheimer (2017) the patophysiological mechanisms of primary ITP include:  
• 
• 
• 
pathologic antiplatelet antibodies  
impaired megakaryocytopoiesis 
T-cell–mediated destruction of platelets  
with each pathologic mechanism playing varying roles in each patient. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Signs and symptoms vary widely. Many patients have either no symptoms or minimal bruising, whereas 
others experience serious bleeding, which may include gastrointestinal haemorrhage, extensive skin and 
mucosal haemorrhage, or intracranial haemorrhage. The severity of thrombocytopenia correlates to some 
extent but not completely with the bleeding risk. Additional factors may increase the risk (e.g., advanced 
age, lifestyle factors, concomitant medications, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders) and should be 
evaluated before the appropriate management is determined (Provan et al, 2010). Although haemorrhagic 
death is a major concern it has been reported that the estimated rate of fatal haemorrhage is around 0.02 to 
0.04 cases per adult patient-year risk (Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products intended 
for the treatment of chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia, EMA/CHMP/153191/2013, Oncology Working 
Party). 
Diagnosis of ITP is one of exclusion, when the history, physical examination, complete blood count and 
examination of peripheral blood smear do not suggest other aetiology for the thrombocytopenia. Physical 
examination should be normal apart from bleeding signs. The peripheral blood count reveals isolated 
thrombocytopenia and normal red cell and white cell indices. If significant bleeding occurs there may be 
anaemia proportional to the degree of bleeding with possible iron deficiency. The peripheral blood smear 
reveals normal to large platelets in size and no abnormalities should be seen in red and white cell 
morphology. Bone marrow examination is currently not routinely conducted in patients with typical ITP 
presentations but reserved to selected cases such as those with an atypical presentation (Guideline on the 
clinical development of medicinal products intended for the treatment of chronic primary immune 
thrombocytopenia, EMA/CHMP/153191/2013, Oncology Working Party). 
2.1.5.  Management 
The major goal for treatment of ITP is to provide a platelet count that prevents major bleeding rather than 
correcting the platelet count to normal levels. The management of ITP should be tailored to the individual 
patient and it is rarely indicated in those with platelet counts above 50 x 109/L in the absence of bleeding, 
trauma, surgery or high-risk factors (e.g. patients on anticoagulation therapy). The management of ITP 
varies widely. First-line treatment options for ITP include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 12/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
and intravenous anti-D immunoglobulin (IV anti-D Ig). Many patients fail to achieve a durable remission, or 
will find the long-term side effects of corticosteroids unacceptable (George 2012). 
Second-line treatment options for adult ITP patients have been reviewed through an international consensus 
report on the investigation and management of primary ITP (Provan et al, 2010). The main goal of second-
line therapy is to attain a sustained increase of the platelet count that is considered hemostatic for the 
individual patient. 
Available medical treatment modalities have quite different mechanisms of action and can be broadly 
categorized into those that are given only once (or for only 1 course) and are intended to induce long-term 
remission (splenectomy, rituximab), and those that need continued or chronic administration (corticosteroids, 
immunosuppressive agents [azathioprine, cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil], and 
thrombopoietin (TPO)-receptor agonists [romiplostim and eltrombopag]). 
ITP is a disease of increased platelet destruction but recent evidence suggests that suboptimal platelet 
production by suppression of megakaryocyte function also occurs. Thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonists 
activate the thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) which is the primary factor that regulates platelet production. 
Treatment aimed at increasing the platelet production has become a potential treatment option and TPO-R 
agonists have been approved in the EU for the treatment of chronic ITP splenectomised adult patients who 
are refractory to other treatments or as second line therapy for non-splenectomised patients where surgery is 
contraindicated. Long-term risks/effects from use of TPO-receptor agonists are still being determined. 
Potential risks with eltrombopag are bone marrow fibrosis and thrombosis, and hepatic and ocular toxicities. 
Romiplostim requires a weekly injection. TPO-receptor agonists as a class are associated with overshoot and 
potential thrombosis. 
Rituximab is also used off-label, which can be associated with severe toxicities in 2% to 6% of patients. 
According to the American Society of Hematology practice guideline for ITP (2011), rituximab may be 
considered for patients at risk of bleeding who have failed 1 line of therapy such as corticosteroids, IVIG, or 
splenectomy (Ghanima 2012; Neunert 2011). 
Splenectomy provides long-term efficacy in approximately 60% of cases. Nonetheless, splenectomy is 
invasive, irreversible, associated with postoperative complications, and its effectiveness is currently 
unpredictable, leading many physicians and patients toward postponement and use of alternative 
approaches. 
According to the ASH Guideline (Neunert et al, 2011) it is recommended that “despite a plethora of novel 
agents and new information on success of treatment, there is no evidence to guide a sequence of treatments 
for patients who have recurrent or persistent thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding after an initial 
treatment course with corticosteroids (or IVIg or anti-D). Splenectomy remains the only treatment that 
provides sustained remission off all treatments at 1 year and beyond in a high proportion of patients with 
ITP; sustained remission rates with rituximab are disappointing and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists 
produce off-treatment sustained remissions very infrequently.” 
They recommend: 
•  Splenectomy for patients who have failed corticosteroid therapy (grade 1B). 
• 
Thrombopoietin receptor agonists for patients at risk of bleeding who relapse after splenectomy or 
who have a contraindication to splenectomy and who have failed at least one other therapy (grade 
1B). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 13/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Furthermore they suggest: 
• 
Thrombopoietin receptor agonists may be considered for patients at risk of bleeding who have failed 
one line of therapy such as corticosteroids or IVIg and who have not had splenectomy (grade 2C). 
•  Rituximab may be considered for patients at risk of bleeding who have failed one line of therapy such 
as corticosteroids, IVIg, or splenectomy (grade 2C).”  
Fostamatinib is also a continuous treatment although with shorter follow-up compared to the TPO-RAs. 
About the product 
Fostamatinib is a prodrug of a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor, converted in vivo to R940406 (R406), 
the active component of fostamatinib; R406 is a potent and relatively selective inhibitor of Syk and 
consequently of the activating Fc receptor (FcR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathways. Fc receptor γ 
(FcRγ) signaling in monocytes and macrophages plays an important role in the initiation and propagation of 
autoimmune responses induced by autoantibodies. The activating FcR is associated with a signaling subunit, 
referred to as the FcRγ chain, whose phosphorylation subsequent to receptor engagement results in the 
recruitment and activation of Syk. Activated Syk kinase plays a central role in mediating downstream 
signaling of activated FcRs, as well as the BCR.  
Aggregation of the FcRs, induced by antibody-antigen complexes, can activate a multitude of cellular 
functions (including degranulation, arachidonic acid metabolism, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, 
phagocytosis and cytokine secretion) depending on the cell type, and leads to tissue damage and the 
propagation of inflammatory responses. FcRγ have been implicated in immune destruction of platelets. 
Accelerated clearance of circulating IgG coated platelets via FcRγ-bearing macrophages in the spleen and 
liver is believed to be a pathogenic mechanism in ITP. 
Therefore, fostamatinib appears to prevent platelet destruction by interrupting Fc receptor-mediated platelet 
engulfment on macrophages through inhibition of SYK signaling. Fostamatinib should be initiated at a dose of 
100 mg taken orally twice daily (bid). After a month, if platelet count has not increased to at least 50,000/µL, 
the fostamatinib dose should be increased to 150 mg bid. Fostamatinib has been proposed by the applicant 
for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients 18 years of age and older with persistent or chronic 
immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The clinical development programme in support of the intended indication comprises 4 clinical studies. These 
clinical studies were conducted in adult patients with persistent or chronic ITP with at least one previous ITP 
treatment. Supportive data derive from studies with fostamatinib in healthy volunteers, rheumatoid arthritis 
patients and oncology patients. 
The Applicant sought Scientific Advice from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency 
(MHRA) to discuss clinical and regulatory aspects of fostamatinib development for treatment of persistent of 
chronic ITP. Presubmission meetings were held with the rapporteur (Denmark) on 16 July 2018 and 17 July 
2018 with the co-rapporteur (Austria) who provided guidance on the content of the application. 
The Phase 3 ITP protocols characterized persistent/chronic ITP in accordance with the ASH 2011 Practice 
Guidelines (Neunert 2011) and the EMA Guideline EMA/CHMP/153191/2013 (EMA 2014) on clinical 
Assessment report

development for the treatment of ITP.  The design of the Phase 3 studies was based upon the design of the 
Phase 3 studies conducted by one of the major therapies currently used in the intended population, the 
TPO-receptor agonists, romiplostim, as well as guidance by recognized thought leaders in the United States 
and Europe. 
On 16 February 2018, the Applicant submitted to the EMA an application for a product-specific waiver for all 
subsets of the pediatric population for the treatment of ITP (EMEA-001196-PIP02-17). The ground for the 
waiver request is based on nonclinical evidences of a likely lack of safety for all pediatric subsets, due to the 
effects of fostamatinib on growth plates. On this ground on 01 June 2018, the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) 
recommended granting a waiver for all subsets of the pediatric population (0 to 18 years of age) in the 
condition of treatment of ITP.

The product is available in white opaque HDPE bottles with a desiccant insert, closed with polypropylene child 
resistant closures and foil induction seals. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of fostamatinib is [6-({5-fluoro-2-[(3,4,5-yl}amino)-2,2-dimethyl-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro- 
4H-trimethoxyphenyl)amino]pyrimidin-4- pyrido[3,2-b]- 1,4-oxazin-4-yl]methyl disodium phosphate 
hexahydrate. It corresponds to the molecular formula C23H24FN6Na2O9P·6H2O, its relative molecular mass is 
732.52 (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) and 580.46 (free acid) and it has the structure shown in Figure 
1.

The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, MS, 1H-, 
13C-, 19F-, and 31P- nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), ultra-violet 
spectrometry (UV). X-ray powder diffraction, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Differential Scanning 
Calorimetry (DSC) and Dynamic Vapor Sorption (DVS) studies were performed to characterise the crystal 
form of the active substance. 
Fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate (FDH) appears as a white to off-white non-hygroscopic powder. It is 
practically insoluble to very slightly soluble in acidic aqueous buffers, slightly soluble in ethanol, sparingly 
soluble in neutral to alkaline aqueous buffers and soluble in methanol. Its partition coefficient (LogDow) was 
determined to be -0.6 and three pKa values were determined to be pKa1: 1.7 and pKa2: 4.2 and pKa2: 6.5. 
Only one crystal form for FDH has been described (Form A) and isolated. Data concerning formation of FDH 
under different crystallization conditions have been given. Form A is a stable crystal form, which is 
consistently produced by the proposed manufacturing process. Stability data demonstrated that there is no 
change in crystal/polymorphic form during storage. 
The active substance exhibits no stereogenic centres and is therefore achiral. 
Based on the information provided by the applicant, fostamatinib is considered to be a new active substance 
(NAS). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The synthesis is described in eight converging overall steps, seven of which comprises actual synthetic steps 
(bond breaking/formation) and a last salt formation step. Based on the documentation presented, the five 
starting materials proposed are acceptable. Sodium 2-ethylhexanoate is used as the source for sodium ions 
in the active substance, but is considered a reagent; this is acceptable. Reaction schemes for the starting 
materials as well as adequate details on manufacturers have been provided. Discussion on possible impurities 
has been presented. Multiple manufacturers of each starting material are proposed. Equivalent quality of 
appropriate intermediate or final active substance has been demonstrated to justify the use of multiple 
starting material manufacturers.  
Elements of enhanced development (ICH Q8 and Q11) have been used to identify critical quality attributes 
and critical process parameters and correlate these to the control strategy. The applicant has clarified that 
critical process parameters, operating parameters and IPCs were determined with a combination of risk 
assessment, design of experiments, statistical modelling and scientific judgement and were subsequent used 
to establish proven acceptable ranges (PARs). No design space is claimed. Suitable specifications were 
presented for the isolated intermediates.  
The characterisation of the AS and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new 
active substances. Potential and actual impurities (including genotoxic impurities) were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. The fate of impurities and their derivatives as well as intermediates 
through processing seems well understood and supported by purge studies. Control and carry-over of 
potential impurities (unchanged or as derivatives) from the starting materials to the final AS have been 
discussed, with the exemption of PDBP (see “Specification”), which should be included in the specification of 
the AS.  
Differences between synthetic processes (from Process A, to Process B (primary stability batches), to Process 
C (Phase 3 ITP studies), and to the commercial process) and sites used throughout product development

have been clearly presented and batch analysis data during process development has been summarised. The 
final commercial manufacturing process has been used for process validation and stability batches. 
The active substance is packaged in double, transparent LDPE bags, which are placed in a HDPE drum. 
Specification for the LDPE material has been presented and confirmation given that the materials comply with 
Ph. Eur. chapter 3.1.3 and EU legislation for plastic materials intended to come into contact with food, 
respectively. 
Specification 
Fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for 
description (visual), identification (FTIR), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), sodium 
content (IC), residual sodium 2-ethylhexanoate (1H-NMR), water content (Ph. Eur.), particle size distribution 
(laser diffraction) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
A comprehensive risk based approach per ICH M7 was used to identify which actual impurities (specified and 
unspecified impurities on the AS specification) and potential impurities (starting materials, reagents, and 
intermediates) could be genotoxic impurities in the AS manufacturing process, and to assess the likelihood of 
their presence in the AS and finished product. The TTC for fostamatinib was calculated in accordance with the 
ICH M7. Using a TTC of 1.5 μg/day limit based on lifetime exposure, the genotoxic impurity limit for 
fostamatinib would equate to 5 ppm based on a maximum allowable daily dose of 300 mg. Compound 
specific assessment conducted for the starting materials present as impurities in the final active substance. It 
is recognised that the process capability to remove these impurities has been shown. However these 
impurities should be subjected to control strategy and thus, control of the starting materials should be 
introduced in specification for the AS. The CHMP recommended to introduce the control of starting materials 
in the AS specification for the release of all future batches of active substance for commercial manufacturing 
in the EU, together with the respective validated methods by Q4 2020. It is acceptable that fulfilment will be 
done post-approval by way of submitting relevant variation(s) according to current variation regulation. 
A discussion on elemental impurities in line with ICH Q3D has been provided. Potential sources of elemental 
impurities have been outlined. Elemental impurity discussion is adequate and omission of testing in the final 
AS specification is justified. The overall approach on the control of elemental impurities is acceptable. 
However since the batch data was collected in the past the CHMP recommended to monitoring new AS 
batches made for relevant residual catalysts. It has been also recommended to introduce the control for 
residual catalysts in the AS specification and the respective validated method by way of submitting 
variation(s) according to current variation regulation by Q4 2020. The levels of residual catalysts observed in 
those new batches will be evaluated and the specification limit for relevant residual catalysts will be revised 
as appropriate to be in alignment with that batch data. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.  
Batch analysis data has been provided for 4 batches of the active substance manufactured by the synthetic 
process proposed. Batch analysis data from another 24 batches used for non-clinical, clinical, stability 
studies, process validation and covering commercial scale has been provided. The presented data complies 
with the proposed specifications; consistency of active substance has been demonstrated.

Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance stored in the intended commercial 
packaging for up to 48 months under long term conditions (25 °C / 60% RH), and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 °C  / 75% RH) was provided according to the ICH guidelines. Supportive data from 
three further pilot batches from process B for up to 68 months under long-term conditions (30 °C / 65% RH) 
and 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) was also provided. One of the three pilot 
batches was subjected to an accelerated heat study at 50°C/ambient humidity for 6 months. 
Parameters investigated: description, assay, impurities, crystal form by XRPD, water content, particle size 
distribution and microbiological purity. Crystal form, particle size distribution and microbiological purity have 
not been investigated for commercial scale batches, which have been satisfactorily justified with reference to 
substantial development batch data. The analytical methods used correspond to the release methods, while 
acceptance criteria were those at time of testing. 
Regardless of storage conditions and synthetic process used for AS manufacture, results complied with the 
specifications. No change in crystalline structure was observed. A tendency for one impurity (R940406) to 
increase in the accelerated heat study was noted. 
Photostability  
Photostability study in line with ICH Q1B has been conducted on one of the pilot batches. Parameters 
investigated were: description, assay, impurities, crystal form by XRPD, water content, particle size 
distribution and microbiological purity. The active substance has been demonstrated stable towards light. 
Forced degradation studies 
Forced degradation studies on a pilot batch under different stress showed varied degree of degradation 
depending on the conditions. In addition the HPLC method for impurities has been shown to be stability 
indicating. 
Based on the provided data, the proposed retest period of 6 years for the active substance when stored in 
the proposed primary packaging without any special storage conditions, is considered acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release film-coated tablet presented in two strengths 100 mg and 150 
mg. Each strength contains 126.2 mg or 189.3 mg FDH, respectively, corresponding to 100 mg or 150 mg 
fostamatinib, respectively.  The tablet strengths can be differentiated by shape, size, colour and debossing. 
The 100 mg strength tablet is round with diameter of 9 mm, biconvex, dark orange film-coated and bossed 
with “R” on one side and “100” on the other. The 150 mg strength tablet is oval with dimensions 7.25 mm x 
14.5 mm, biconvex, light orange film-coated tablet and debossed with “R” on one side and “150” on the 
other. The finished product (FP) pharmaceutical development and control strategy are considered traditional. 
However, principles of QbD such as definition of a quality target product profile (QTPP) presented in Table 1, 
associated FP critical quality attributes (CQA) as well as formulation and process risk assessments have been 
utilised in formulation and process development to develop control strategy. A design space has not been 
claimed but PARs have been defined.

Fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate (FDH) is a prodrug that converts to the pharmacologically active moiety, 
R940406 in vivo, via hydrolysis catalysed by alkaline phosphatases. Compared to R940406, the FDH provides 
increased solubility and enables much higher absorption of R940406 from an immediate release formulation. 
Since FDH is a prodrug that converts to R940406 for absorption, the AS cannot be strictly classified in the 
Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS). However, to approach the product development and manage 
development risk, the AS is treated as a BCS Class IV compound, which is considered sound. Since 
fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate is considered as a BCS Class IV compound, particle size of the AS could 
theoretically impact the performance of the solid dosage form by affecting the dissolution and thus is 
controlled in the AS specification. It has been demonstrated by batch data, stability data and relevant XRD 
that the crystal form of the AS remains unchanged during manufacture of the final finished product as well as 
during storage even when subjected to severe thermal stress conditions.  
The choice and function of each excipient in the formulation have been described and justified. All excipients 
are commonly used for tablets and with exception of the colouring materials, all excipients are of 
pharmacopoeial quality and compatible with the AS, as demonstrated by stability data. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. Excipients were selected to 
enable rapid tablet disintegration and thereby minimize the potential for gelling of the AS in the tablet matrix 
which was observed in the earlier formulation. The gel formation is observed at or around the pH range in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019

which fostamatinib is present predominantly as zwitterion. The gel is likely to be held together by a 
combination of opposite charges on the molecule, aromatic pi-interactions, or H-bonding, although other 
mechanisms of gel formation are possible. The fact that the gelling occurs in pH range of 1.7 to 4.2 suggests 
that charge interactions are the dominant force causing the gel formation. An alkalizing diluent, sodium 
hydrogen carbonate, was selected to modify local pH, produce effervescence and increase ionic concentration 
to interfere with drug-drug molecular interactions, in order to prevent gel formation. 
A common granule blend is used for both the 100 mg and the 150 mg tablets strengths and the two tablet 
strengths are dose proportional with regard to tablet core composition. 
Initial non-clinical and clinical studies were conducted with R940406. However, its pharmaceutical properties 
(mainly its limited aqueous solubility) made it infeasible for commercial development, while FDH had more 
robust pharmaceutical properties and after oral intake FDH was rapidly and extensively converted to 
R940406. 
Studies were conducted using varying concentration of all excipients in the finalised composition to 
investigate the robustness and to optimise the concentration of excipients. Overview of the different 
formulations and their compositions has been presented. Several strengths have been used during clinical 
development, manufactured first at formulation development sites and finally at the proposed site. During 
development the potential failure mechanisms were identified and addressed.  Gelling, disintegration, AS 
particle size and moisture ingress during storage were evaluated and appropriate measures and /or in-
process controls were introduced. Bridging between development batches and commercial production batches 
has been ensured by clinical studies in combination with bioequivalence and bioavailability studies. 
Bioequivalence studies were performed to establish equivalency of the tablet formulations for phase 3 studies 
and commercial over the course of development. 
Throughout the development of the commercial formulation, two dissolution methods were used to study how 
critical process parameters and material attributes affect the final product performance. 
The first method was used during formulation development to ensure that the gelling failure mode had been 
completely eliminated. The amount of sodium hydrogen carbonate included in the formulation is set at a level 
to ensure that the active substance gelling is overcome during routine manufacture. It is therefore not 
necessary for QC release test to detect this attribute.  
Method development, including investigation of discriminatory power, was conducted in several media (buffer 
type, buffer concentration, pH, volume) and varying rotation speeds. The discriminatory power of method has 
been demonstrated with regard to the granulation process parameters, composition, moisture ingress during 
storage and particle size of the AS.  
The core tablet is manufactured with standard wet granulation processes; the core tablet is coated with a 
non-functional, cosmetic, orange film coating using a conventional coating process. Studies for manufacturing 
process development were conducted at lab and pilot scale using equipment representative of that proposed 
for commercial manufacture. The lab and pilot scale studies were used to identify the process parameters 
that could impact FP performance. Subsequently, the process parameters were applied to manufacture at 
commercial scale to confirm that relationships established at lab and/or pilot scales were still valid and to 
identify appropriate working ranges for relevant process parameters at commercial scale. A risk-based 
approach to identify, classify and mitigate risk parameters by establishing appropriate controls and ranges for 
these critical process parameters at the manufacturing site was applied. The in-process controls and PARs 
determined for the process have been based on the outcomes of the risk assessments with supporting 
process development data.

Film-coated tablets are packed in double LDPE bags placed in a HDPE container. Desiccant is placed between 
the bags. Specifications for the LDPE bag and the desiccant have been presented and they include specific 
identification testing (IR) and dimensions. Furthermore, moisture content is controlled in the specification for 
the desiccant. 
The finished product is packed in a white 75 cc HDPE bottle with a child-resistant white PP cap. In the bottle 
there are two white HDPE desiccant canisters, each containing 1 g of silica gel (total 2 g). Specifications and 
drawings for the HDPE bottle, the desiccant canister and the PP cap have been presented and are 
satisfactory. The packaging materials in immediate contact with the finished product (bottle, cap and 
canister) including the silica gel conform to relevant Ph. Eur. chapters and/or comply with EU quality 
requirements for plastic materials to come into contact with food. The choice of the container closure system 
has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The proposed manufacturing process is a standard process involving dry mixing and wet granulation, 
lubrication and tablet compression with subsequent film-coating and packaging. 
Critical step/process parameters have been identified. The critical parameters are controlled by suitable PARs 
which are justified by development and process validation data. 
The bulk holding time for film-coated tablets of maximum 30 days that will be applied for film-coated tablets 
has been supported by data. Bulk stability has been investigated and 24 months stability demonstrated. If 
the bulk stage hold time exceeds 90 days, the applicant will re-test the bulk product against the release 
specifications as a condition for final release of the lot. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on commercial scale 
batches at the proposed manufacturer. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable 
of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for description 
(visual), identification (UV, HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur., UV), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on three batches 
using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not 
detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it 
can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product 
specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of finished 
product has been presented. 
A summary of 25 representative batches (development phase, registration/primary stability, and process 
validation/stability) were presented for both tablet strengths. These data come from the development 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019

manufacturing sites and commercial scale batches from the proposed site using active substance obtained 
from the commercial synthesis. All batches were analysed using the methods current at the time and comply 
with the specification confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture 
to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data on six commercial scale batches of finished product for each strength for up to 36 months 
under long term conditions at 25°C/60%RH and 30°C/65%RH and for six months under accelerated 
conditions at 40°C/75%RH according to ICH guidelines have been presented. Three batches of each strength 
were subjected to stressed conditions (50°C/AH) for six months. The six commercial scale batches were filled 
into the proposed container closure system.  
For all studies conducted the following parameters have been investigated: Description, assay, degradation 
products, dissolution and microbiological purity. Analytical methods were the same as those used for release. 
Regardless of storage conditions and tablet strength, results comply the specifications. A slight tendency to 
increase in degradation product R940406 and consequently total degradation products was observed. 
Stability data for tablets, stored in the proposed bottles with desiccant, show little or no changes in 
description, assay, degradation products, dissolution and microbiological quality at 36 months under long-
term storage conditions (30°C/65% RH and 25°C/60% RH). 
For samples stored under accelerated (40°C/75% RH) and stressed (50°C/AH) conditions for 6 months, there 
is little or no change in description, assay, dissolution and microbiological quality (40°C/75% RH sample 
only). Increases in the two specified degradation products, R940406 and R936003, are observed but the 
levels remained well within the specification limits. The data of assay and degradation products at 40°C/75% 
RH and 30°C/65% RH demonstrates the robustness of the FP. 
Photostability  
One commercial scale batch of each tablet strength has been subjected to photostability testing in 
accordance with ICH Q1B. Results comply with specifications. The photostability data show that light has no 
significant effect on the physical and chemical characteristics of the tablets. 
In-use stability 
In-use stability studies were conducted for both strengths at 25°C/60% RH and 30°C/75% RH conditions, 
and study duration run for up to 13 weeks. The batches used were development batches differing from 
composition proposed with regard to coating (blue instead of orange), manufacturing site and synthesis of 
active substance (process B instead of commercial, difference minor and explained. The following parameters 
have been investigated: description, assay, degradation products, dissolution, microbiological purity and 
water content. Results complied with specifications and all parameters were well within limits.  The in-use 
stability data up to 3 months duration suggest that the FP performance is not impacted even when water 
content increases significantly under artificially induced stress conditions. 
Based on the overall stability data, the claimed shelf life of 3 years without any special temperature storage 
conditions when stored in tightly closed bottle to protect from moisture, is acceptable (SmPC sections 6.3 and 
6.4).

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that from a quality 
perspective the product should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical performance. At the time of the CHMP 
opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio 
of the product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and biological 
aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled 
in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- to introduce the control of starting materials in the AS specification for the release of all future batches of 
active substance for commercial manufacturing in the EU, together with the respective validated methods by 
way of submitting variation(s) according to current variation regulation by Q4 2020. 
- to introduce the control of relevant residual catalysts in the AS specification and the respective validated 
method by way of submitting variation(s) according to current variation regulation by Q4 2020. In addition to 
evaluate the levels of relevant residual catalysts in new batches of AS and revise the specification as 
appropriate to be in alignment with that batch data. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Fostamatinib, a small molecule Spleen Tyrosin kinase (SYK)-inhibitor, blocks SYK-mediated responses across 
a broad range of cell types involved in the initiation and progression of inflammatory and autoimmune 
diseases in both primary and cultured human cells. 
SYK is present in a broad range of cells. SYK is present in hematopoietic cells such as mast cells, basophils, 
B-cells, T-cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, monocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets, as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 24/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
well as non-hematopoietic cells, such as osteoclasts, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and neuronal 
and vascular endothelial cells. 
All in vitro primary pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted with R406 and not with fostamatinib. 
This in line with the fact that fostamatinib is rapidly converted to its active component R406 in vivo. 
R406 potently inhibited in vitro biochemical SYK activity in human, mouse and rat (mean IC50 of 25 nM, 20 
nM, and 30 nM, respectively) in a Caliper assay measuring inhibition of peptide phosphorylation.  
R406 blocks FcεRI-dependent activation of cultured human mast cells in a dose-dependent manner with an 
EC50 of approximately 43 nM as assessed by measuring tryptase released upon degranulation. However, 
R406 did not inhibit ionomycin-induced degranulation of cultured human mast cells. Thus, R406 appears to 
be specific to FcR signaling, and not degranulation per se.  
R406 was shown to potently abolish FcεRI and FcγRI stimulation in human mast cells, macrophages, 
neutrophils, and platelets. R406 also blocked FcγR signaling in both murine and human dendritic cells.  
Furthermore, R406 inhibited B-Cell receptor (BCR) signaling in both primary human B cells and human B cell 
lines. Furthermore, R406 blocked BCR activation of murine primary B cells. R406 inhibited IL-1β secretion 
from murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, which appears to be due to inhibition of Immune-receptor-
Tyrosine-based-Activation-Motif (ITAM) signaling via SYK. R406 also inhibited the differentiation, proliferation 
and function of mouse primary osteoclasts and bone marrow osteoclast. 
Collectively, R406 potently inhibited all tested ITAM-mediated signaling, including activation of FcR, BCR and 
C-type lectin receptor (CLR).  These data are consistent with R406 being a SYK inhibitor.  
In vitro data primary with human and murine based systems and some data from rat in vitro systems have 
been provided. No data on inhibition of SYK in cynomolgus monkey and rabbit have been submitted, however 
it was documented that the amino acid sequences of SYK kinases are highly conserved within mammals. 
Hence, monkey and rabbit can be considered as species in which R406 is pharmacologically active. 
Fostamatinib was evaluated for its efficacy in a mouse models of ITP. CD-1 mice and C57BL/6 mice were 
injected with rat anti-mouse GPIIb antibody to induce platelet clearance. Mice pre-treated orally with 
fostamatinib, were significantly protected from thrombocytopenia. Fostamatinib appears to mitigate antibody-
induced thrombocytopenia in both a dose- and schedule-dependent manner.  Due to the rapid decrease in 
plasma R406 concentrations over time, significant mitigation of antibody-mediated platelet depletion was 
observed only when a dose of 80 mg/kg fostamatinib was administered every 4 hours. These data support 
that fostamatinib treatment mitigates clearance of platelets in murine models of autoantibody-mediated 
thrombocytopenia, consistent with suppression by SYK inhibition of FcγR-mediated phagocytosis in 
macrophages. 
R406 specifically inhibited SYK-dependent collagen-mediated platelet activation, but not platelet activation 
induced with adenosine 5’ diphosphate (ADP). High systemic exposures of R406 did not prolong bleeding 
times in mice with normal platelet count. Thus, the data indicates that R406 is unlikely to severely affect 
hemostasis in patients with normal platelet count. As fostamatinib is to be used in patients with 
thrombocytopenia, it might cause prolonged bleeding, when collagen-mediated platelet activation is inhibited. 
It appears that even though the collagen-mediated platelet activation is inhibited by R406 in patients, 
increased bleeding is not observed in responders to R406 treatment. This could be due to other 
compensatory mechanisms or that, in these patients, the amount of platelets was sufficient to secure 
hemostasis despite inhibition of collagen-mediated platelet activation. However, it is acknowledged that in 
Assessment report

Page 25/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
the context of severe thrombocytopenia, close monitoring for bleeding events, particularly in the skin, is 
warranted.  
Although fostamatinib significantly increased relative thrombosis blood flow (RTBF) in an arterial thrombosis 
rat model at 100 mg/kg (38.2±15.1%), no such significant increase was observed at clinically relevant doses 
of 30 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. However, a tendency towards increased RTBF (16.6±9.01% at 10 mg/kg 
and 30.4±11.7% at 30 mg/kg) could also be assumed at lower doses, according to the submitted data. 
Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) treatment alone increased RTBF by 26.1±10.4%, thus to a lesser extent than the 
medium dose of R406. The combination of ASA and R406 strongly increased the RTBF at all doses tested (up 
to 70.8±16.8% when dosing ASA together with 10 mg/kg of R406). Similar data was also observed with time 
to occlusion (TTO). Fostamatinib/ASA combination treatment slightly decreased thrombus size, however not 
significantly. This effect could theoretically increase the bleeding risk for patients treated with fostamatinib in 
combination with ASA. However, altogether fostamatinib appears to show a weak antithrombotic effect in this 
animal model without increasing the cutaneous bleeding time. 
Furthermore, it is acknowledged that SYK inhibition per se may be beneficial for ITP patients by affecting 
different signalling pathways involved in platelet destruction, and prevention of inflammation-associated 
bleeding and thrombosis, respectively, and that according to recent literature molecular and cellular 
mechanisms of haemostasis and thrombosis can be separated.  
No statistical significant prolongation of bleeding time was observed in this rat study. Compared to the ICR-
mouse study discussed above, treatment of ASA alone (‘positive control’) or in combination with fostamatinib 
up to 137 µmol/kg did not increase the bleeding time in the rat model. The coupled rat arterial thrombosis 
assay appears to be less sensitive compared to the direct bleeding time assay conducted in mice. Clarification 
that ASA treatment in rat per se did increase the relative thrombotic blood flow from 5.0% (vehicle/vehicle) 
to 26% (vehicle/ASA) have been provided, thus showing an expected effect when treating with the positive 
control ASA in the rat model as well. 
In a murine model of lung damage after mesenteric ischemiareperfusion (I/R) injury, SYK inhibition with 
fostamatinib improved I/R injury score, but did not show significant effects on platelet function and 
hemostasis. In a murine model of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), fostamatinib effectively suppressed 
FcR-mediated antibody-induced red blood cell destruction. 
To further assess the anti-inflammatory mechanism of fostamatinib and confirm the proposed mode of action, 
fostamatinib and R406 were also tested in additional supporting animal models representing several SYK-
dependent diseases. 
R406 and fostamatinib decreased immune-complex mediated inflammation and clinical rheumatoid arthritis 
symptoms in rats, thus confirming the broad anti-inflammatory potential of the drug. Results indicated that 
both R406 and its prodrug fostamatinib inhibit immune complex-induced local inflammation and reduce 
vascular permeability in a dose-dependent manner (dosed up to 30 mg/kg). Histological analysis conducted 
in the clinical arthritis collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) mouse model indicated that R406 at 3 
mg/kg ameliorated the destruction of cartilage and bone, whereas this could not be observed when dosing 7 
mg/kg. 
In the K/BxN serum transfer model in mice, fostamatinib dosed orally at 10 mg/kg delayed the onset and 
reduced the severity of clinical arthritis in a SYK dependent manner after passive transfer of arthritogenic 
serum from K/BxN mice as shown by comparison to transfer to SYK -/- mice where disease was not 
inducible, which confirms the importance of SYK in arthritic disease.

In the Syngeneic Louvain (LOU) rat, respectively Lewis rat collagen induced arthritis (CIA) model, both 
fostamatinib and R406 reduced disease severity starting from 7 days after initiation of therapy. Treatment led 
to a significant reduction in clinical score and radiographic joint damage as quantified by micro-computed 
tomography analysis in the CIA rat model. Fostamatinib alone or in combination with methotrexate (0.4 
mg/kg) protected against bone damage. Antibodies to type II collagen were not decreased in CIA rats treated 
with fostamatinib or R406 alone, but reduced antibody levels were observed following combination with 
methotrexate, suggesting that disease attenuation following combination treatment may be attributable to 
inhibition of humoral collagen specific immunity. In vitro, R406 abrogated the differentiation, proliferation 
and function of mouse primary osteoclasts and bone marrow osteoclast precursor cells cultured with murine 
M-CSF and RANKL. In the Lewis rat CIA model R406 dosage resulted in significant reduction of bone erosion. 
R406 and fostamatinib showed promising results in transgenic mouse models of Chronic Lynphocytic 
leukemia (CLL) by induction of tumor regression and increased survival of animals, when tumor progression 
was BCR-dependent, but no beneficial effects could be observed in Eμ-MYC mice with BCR-independent 
tumors. Similar effects could also be observed in other hematological malignancy models, e.g. B-lineage 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. 
The effect of fostamatinib in immune-mediated glomerulonephritis (GN) was studied in different rodent 
models. Fostamatinib treatment prevented onset of GN when treatment started before induction of disease, 
whereas significant improvement of symptoms (e.g., reduced proteinuria, glomerular macrophages and 
serum creatinine, respectively, reduction in renal injury consistent with suppression of TGFß and renal 
fibrosis, dependent on the animal model used) could be achieved when already diseased animals were 
treated. Additionally, fostamatinib/R406-dependent SYK inhibition showed beneficial effects on the onset and 
development of kidney damage and lupus skin in murine models of systemic lupus erythematosus. 
In the LDLr-/-murine atherosclerosis model fostamatinib mitigated inflammation and atherogenesis. The anti-
inflammatory effect of R406 could also be observed in multiple models of allergic asthma, where treatment 
positively affected airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung inflammation by blocking IgE-dependent mast 
cell repsonse via FcεRI. In non-obese diabetic mice fostamatinib delayed the onset of spontaneous disease as 
well as progression of already established early diabetes. 
R406 bound to a broad range of kinase targets in biochemical assays. R406 was shown to inhibit Jak family 
kinase-dependent activation of CD23 expression by IL-4 as well as IL-2 driven primary T-cell proliferation. 
However, in cell-based functional assays R406 off-target binding occurred only to a lesser extent (~ four 
times lower inhibitory function) than the inhibition of Syk-dependent pathways, and no functional inhibition of 
immune signalling could be observed in more complex models. 
RET kinase inhibitory function of R406 was shown in all model systems tested and is further discussed in the 
toxicology section, as it adversely affected embryo-fetal development including among other findings renal 
agenesis.  Additionally, R406 was a potent inhibitor of VEGFR-2 downstream signalling in in vitro biochemical 
assays and HUVEC assay, which may be the reason for the blood pressure increases observed in the safety 
pharmacology studies discussed below. 
R406 had slight effects on the innate immune response, but these appears not to be clinically relevant.  
The pharmacological profile of R406 was assessed using in vitro radioligand binding, enzyme, and 
electrophysiological assays at a total of 326 non-kinase targets, covering enzyme, receptor, ion channel and 
transmembrane transporter classes.  R406 had activity (defined as IC50 <1 μM) at four targets: the 
adenosine A3 receptor (Ki 17 nM, antagonist), UDP glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1 (IC50 143 nM, inhibitor), 
phosphodiesterase PDE5 (IC50 310 nM, inhibitor) and the adenosine transporter (Ki 630 nM, uptake inhibitor).  
Assessment report

Regarding the antagonistic effect on the A3 receptor, the A3 knock out mouse appear viable and to develop 
normally. Furthermore, targeting the A3 receptor by antagonists may prove beneficial in inflammatory 
diseases, since antagonists are in clinical development against psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. This indicate 
that the A3 receptor target is not likely to be of any safety concern for the use of fostamatinib.R406 binding 
was assessed in a set of 378 competition-binding assays. Binding was detected at 209 kinases other than 
SYK.  Binding Kd values were equal to or more potent than the SYK Kd (12 nM) for 16 kinases, and within 
10-fold of the SYK Kd for a further 68. The clinically relevance of the 16 kinases (JAK2, PLK4, STK16, RET, 
FLT3, KIT, PDGFRB, NEK5, MAP3K10, PLK3, NEK6, JAK3, EIF2AK4, MAP3K9, IRAK3, MAP3K11) with binding 
Kd values equal to or more potent than the SYK Kd is outlined below divided into three groups.  
Group 1: Cytokine-growth factor receptor signaling (JAK2, JAK3, RET, FLT3, KIT, PDGFRb); 
Group 2: Cell-cycle regulation (PLK3, PLK4, NEK5, NEK6, STK16) 
Group 3: Stress-induced response signaling (MAP3K9, MAP3K10, MAP3K11, EIF2AK4, IRAK3). 
For group 1, off-target effects are potential cytopenias, hypopigmentation of skin and hair and peripheral 
edemas. These effects are anticipated to be routinely collected as adverse events. The R406 potent inhibitory 
effect on RET leads to teratogenicity, which is already covered by SmPC, since women of childbearing 
potential are required to use effective contraception during treatment with fostamatinib. 
For Group 2, the potent off-target biochemical effects were explained to be less potent when examined in 
cell-based assays. Nevertheless, the complex pharmacology behind these targets is not completely 
understood and could be implicated in the common adverse effect of diarrhea. This is adequately described in 
SmPC. 
For Group 3, although adequate selectivity to SYK appear to be present when using cell-based assays, 
potential in vivo inhibition of these targets could actually be beneficial in the indication. 
Safety pharmacology effects of R406 on the central nervous system was assessed using the Irwin Test in 
conscious male Sprague Dawley rats for up to 2 hours after a single oral dose of 0 (vehicle), 5, 15, or 50 
mg/kg. The NOEL was set to 15mg/kg due to reduced touch response, decreased startle response, decreased 
locomotion and decreased grooming, together with vocalization in the 50mg/kg group. The effects of R406 on 
respiratory rate and tidal volume were assessed in male Sprague Dawley rats after a single oral dose of 0, 5, 
15 or 50 mg/kg with no effect on respiratory rate or tidal volume at any dose tested (NOEL 50 mg/kg). The 
assessment of effects on the central nervous system and the respiratory system appears to be conducted in 
line with the ICH S7A guideline. 
R406 was tested for its effect on the hERG-encoded potassium channel at a nominal concentration of 2 
μmol/L and it appears that R406 was inactive. However, the study was only conducted with one 
concentration of R406 and was not GLP compliant. The single concentration assay was due to the inherent 
poor solubility of R406. The concentration of 2 μM was the highest concentration achievable and corresponds 
to 0.79-fold the clinical plasma concentration measured in patients exposed to the supratherapeutic dose of 
300 mg BID. Hence, testing lower concentrations would not be of clinical relevance. Nonclinical in vivo 
studies in monkeys and the human QT study supersedes any in vitro study and provide evidence that R406 
meets the criteria set by the ICH E14 guidance for a negative thorough QT study.  
In cardiovascular studies (CVS), a slight reduction on heart rate and a trend to increased blood pressure was 
observed at 50 mg/kg R406 in monkeys (the highest dose tested). According to the calculations, this 
corresponds to a peak plasma concentration of ~1910 ng/ml, calculated as the average of the four values 
obtained at the high dose of 50 mg/kg.

Cardiovascular effect of R406 and fostamatinib were investigated in a range on non-GLP compliant study in 
rats. A single dose of fostamatinib evoked a dose-dependent elevation in Blood Pressure (BP) in conscious 
telemetered male Sprague Dawley rats.  The time course of the BP effect correlated closely with changes in 
R406 plasma concentration with an estimated EC50 of 20nM, which is comparable to the mean free plasma 
concentration of R406 (49 nM) in patients. The highest dose tested (100 mg/kg) appeared to decrease heart 
rate and prolong QA and PR intervals. The increase in BP was also seen in a 28 day repeat dose study. In the 
repeat dose study the QA interval was increased relative to vehicle treatment on Day 1 following 30 mg/kg 
(indicative of a decrease in cardiac contractility), but reversed to a decrease in the QA interval by Day 14 
(indicative of increased contractility).   
The cardiovascular effects were further studied in anaesthetized Sprague Dawley rats following IV infusion of 
R406. A reduction in mean arterial blood flow was seen at 3 mg/kg. At 5 mg/kg an increase in arterial BP and 
a reduction in dP/dtmax were also observed. Furthermore, a small decrease in heart rate associated with a 
parallel increase in PR interval was also seen.   
R406 had no direct effect on coronary flow, heart rate and cardiac contractility when investigated in isolated 
Langendorff perfused rat hearts at all concentrations tested. R406 had no vasoconstrictive or vasorelaxant 
effects in an in vitro rat aorta study. Likewise, R406 had no direct effect on vascular tone of human 
subcutaneous resistance arteries. However, when pre-incubated with R406 an attenuation of the effect of a 
thromboxane A2 receptor agonist was seen. 
Effects of R406 on endothelial function was investigated in anaesthetised Sprague Dawley rats. R406 
consistently caused increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in all experiments.  R406 appeared not 
to have any effect on arterial blood flow, vasodilatory actions of acetylcholine and conductance during the 
hyperaemic response following arterial occlusion. However, R406 did inhibit the vasodilatory actions of VEGF. 
The effect on VEGF might be the mechanism behind in effect on BP seen in rats. In vitro studies with human 
endothelial cells were used to further investigate the effect of R406 on VEGF. R406 inhibited VEGF-induced 
synthesis of NO with an IC50 of 0.34 µM.  
The effects of anti-hypertensive agents on the BP of conscious telemetered male Sprague-Dawley rats 
treated with R406 was investigated. It appears that nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker), captopril (an 
angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor) or atenolol (a selective β1 receptor antagonist) could reduce BP. 
The effects of nifedipine on BP, heart rate, and ECG parameters were also investigated in conscious 
telemetered male Sprague-Dawley rats. Fostamatinib-induced increases in blood pressure and increases in 
QA interval appeared to be prevented by co-administration of oral nifedipine. 
Overall R406 appears to have a significant effect on BP at clinically relevant exposure. This was confirmed in 
the clinic and from a nonclinical point of view, these findings are adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
Combinatorial treatment of female ApoE3 Leiden mice with fostamatinib + the cholesterol lowering drug 
rosuvastatin in combination with western-type diet (containing 0.75% cholesterol) in the atherosclerosis 
study led to death of 7 of the 15 treated animals after six days of treatment. Examination revealed enlarged 
liver. Surviving mice showed weight loss and increased ALT levels, indicating liver damage, at higher rates 
when compared to rosuvastatin treatment alone. Fostamatinib treatment alone resulted in grey fur on the 
ventral side, spleen weight reduction and decreased total cholesterol levels after dosing of 330 mg/kg/day 
and in increased total cholesterol levels after dosing of 110 mg/kg bw/day. However, no dead animals were 
observed and fostamatinib alone did not affect atherosclerosis development in the mouse model. Reference is 
made to the toxicology section for a summary of the toxicology study conducted to further investigate these 
deaths and adverse liver findings.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The nonclinical ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) studies were performed to 
support the clinical development of fostamatinib disodium, and conducted in the same species, also used in 
the pharmacology and toxicology studies. 
In rats dosed with fostamatinib there was no systemic exposure of fostamatinib following oral dosing. 
Furthermore, plasma concentration profiles of fostamatinib and R406 were evaluated in portal vein 
cannulated rats following an oral dose of fostamatinib.  No fostamatinib was observed in portal vein or 
jugular vein plasma samples. Thus, it is presumed that conversion of fostamatinib to R406 occurs rapidly in 
the gastrointestinal tract, within the first hour of oral dosing. R406 have moderate to high permeability in in 
vitro systems with both Caco-2 cells and MDR expressing MDCK cells. Furthermore, R406 is a substrate of P-
gp in Caco-2 cells.   
Single dose pharmacokinetics of R406 was determined in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys after oral 
administration of R406 or fostamatinib, and after intravenous administration of R406. Bioavailability of R406 
from oral fostamatinib dosing was between 40% to 80% with monkeys having highest bioavailability and 
rabbits the lowest bioavailability. Mice and rats had approximately 60% bioavailability. Pharmacokinetics of 
R406 appear to be dose proportional at the doses tested in single dose studies with the exception of rabbits 
having a higher than dose proportional increase in AUC.  
Gender differences in pharmacokinetics of R406 were seen in both rats and mice. Female rats and male mice 
exhibited higher levels of R406 than male rats and female mice. These gender differences were attributed to 
disparities in the hepatic metabolism of R406. Hepatic microsomes from female mice metabolise R406 at a 
rate 5.4-fold greater than males. However, this cannot explain the gender difference observed in female mice 
(G-935788-0010) having higher Cmax at the 150 mg/kg/dose on both study days, instead this can be 
explained by saturation of the female specific metabolism pathway.  
Sex differences were not observed in monkeys, except in one study (G-935788-0005). Higher mean Cmax and 
AUC values were found in female animals compared to male monkeys. No explanation was given on the 
detected gender differences. There is no difference known in the metabolism of hepatic microsomes from 
Cynomolgus monkeys of either gender. These differences were explained by interindividual variability. Human 
hepatic microsomes from females metabolise R406 at a 2-fold greater rate than those from males (N-
940406-0020). 
Protein binding of R406 is high in all species tested (mice: 98.6%, rats: 97.9%, rabbits: 99.5%, monkeys: 
98.5%, and humans: 98.3%). Some distribution to red blood cells was seen, but the distribution to red blood 
cells appeared to be reversible. 
Tissue distribution of 14C-drug related material has been investigated in male albino and male pigmented rats 
following oral dosing of 14C-fostamatinib 20 mg/kg. It appears that R406 is widely distributed to all tissues 
with the exception of the CNS. R406 is apparently not able to cross the blood-brain barrier.  
Mass balance studies were performed in rats using 14C-R406 and in mice, monkeys, rabbits, and humans with 
14C-fostamatinib. Recovery of radioactivity (> 89%) was adequate in all species with only small amounts 
retained in the carcass (< 1% in mouse, rat and rabbit). 
However, the eye (uveal tract), the liver, and the contents of the small intestine had low levels of 
radioactivity at 168 hours post-dose. Fostamatinib related radioactivity appeared to decline rapidly in liver 
and uveal tract initially. At 96 and 168 hours after dosing, only trace amounts was left in these tissues. The 
Assessment report

calculated half-life of radioactivity of eye (72.6 h) and the liver (50.3 h) at terminal phase of the study have 
been provided. Since no histopathological findings were evident in these tissues in either, rat or monkey in 
pivotal toxicity studies, the limited clinical relevance is supported. 
R406 is able to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits and this has been reflected in the SmPC section 5.3 
including a statement on placental transfer. 
Metabolite profiles have been investigated in mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys and humans. No human specific 
metabolites were identified in plasma. R406 is the major metabolite of fostamatinib in all species. R406 is in 
humans primarily metabolised to O-Glucuronide of R529 (O-demethylated R406), O-Sulfate of R529 and N-
Glucuronide of R406. All three of those are present in monkeys. However, they have not been quantified in 
monkeys. O-Glucuronide of R529 is present in all species tested and in larger amounts in mouse, rat and 
rabbit than in humans. O-Sulfate of R529 is present in rabbit and monkey and in larger amounts in rabbits 
than in humans. N-Glucuronide of R406 is present in rat and monkey and in larger amounts in rats than in 
humans. Mice, rats and monkeys were the primary toxicological species used to characterize general toxicity 
of fostamatinib. O-Glucuronide of R529 was present in all three species, N-Glucuronide of R406 was present 
in rats and monkeys. However, of the three primary toxicological species O-Sulfate of R529 was only present 
in monkeys. O-Sulfate of R529 has not been quantified in monkeys, nevertheless, since the O-sulphate is a 
phase two metabolite and comprise of less than 10% of total exposure in human plasma, further studies are 
not deemed necessary. This is in line with ICH M3(R2) and MIST guidelines.  
Fostamatinib is rapidly and completely hydrolysed to R406 in an in vitro system with purified alkaline 
phosphatase. No hydrolysis was observed in the absence of alkaline phosphatase. Thus, fostamatinib is 
generally believed to be rapidly and almost completely hydrolysed to R406 in the intestine before absorption. 
R406 was metabolized in liver microsomes from human and animal species, the main metabolite was para O-
demethylated R406 (R529) (N-940406-0020, and N 935788-0025). CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 appeared to be 
responsible for metabolism. All other human CYP450 isoforms tested did not metabolize R406.  CYP3A4 
appears to be the predominant human CYP450 isoform responsible for the O-demethylation of R406.  
In human hepatic microsomes one major and two minor R406 glucuronide conjugates were observed. The 
major glucuronide conjugate formed in hepatic microsomes mediated by UGT1A9 corresponded to the major 
urinary R406 glucuronide. The N-glucuronide that predominated in plasma was a product of UGT1A1 and 
UGT1A4. 
3,5-benzene diol metabolite only observed in faeces was found following incubation of R529 with human and 
monkey gut bacteria under anaerobic conditions. 
Hepatic microsomes from female rats metabolize R406 at a rate 3.9 fold slower than males. Whereas, hepatic 
microsomes from female mice metabolized R406 at a rate 5.4 fold greater than males.  These results were 
consistent with the in vivo gender difference. Thus, different doses were administered in male and female 
animals in rodent toxicity studies to achieve similar exposure in the groups. 
Excretion studies to investigate routes of excretion using recovery of radioactivity following administration of 
14C-R406 to rats or 14C-fostamatinib has been conducted in mice, rabbits, monkeys and humans. Total 
recovery of radioactivity was above 89 in all studies. Faecal excretion was the primary route of excretion with 
approximately 80% of radioactivity excreted in faeces in all species tested. Urinary excretion covered from 
4% to 19%.  
Studies of bile excretion has been conducted in rats and moneys, showing from 46.7% to 83.9% recovery of 
radioactivity in bile. Thus, it appears that bile excretion is the predominant excretion path.

In rodents, R406 was detected in maternal milk in concentrations 5- to 10-fold higher than in maternal 
plasma. The risk to the newborns/infants in breast-feeding cannot be excluded and the SmPC includes 
relevant warnings and risk minimisation measures.  
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that R406 can cause inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. 
R406 appears also to be an inhibitor of UGT1A1 and UGT1A. R406 was a substrate of P-gp.  However, 
fostamatinib was determined to be an inhibitor of P-gp-mediated 3H-digoxin transport. This was followed up 
upon in a clinical study, where it was shown that fostamatinib at clinically relevant doses increased AUC of 
digoxin with 37% and Cmax with about 70%. Fostamatinib and R406 were not substrates of human BCRP in 
an in vitro vesicle test system.  However, fostamatinib and R406 were potent inhibitors of human BCRP 
mediated transport of 3H-estrone-3-sulfate in the same system. This interaction has been further investigated 
in a clinical study where fostamatinib co-administration increased the AUC of rosuvastatin by approximately 
2- fold. Interaction with BCRP and P-gp is adequately described in SmPC. R406 was not a substrate of 
OATP1B1, MRP2, OAT1, OCT2 and OAT3. Furthermore, R406 did not inhibit OATP1B1, MRP2, OAT1, OCT2 and 
OAT3. Treatment of hepatocytes with R406 caused increases in the activity CYP2C8. A clinical pharmacology 
study was conducted to investigate the impact of possible induction of CYP2C8 on pioglitazone 
pharmacokinetics. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Only one single dose toxicity study was reported. This was the pilot study for setting the doses in the mouse 
micronucleus study. However this still provide valuable information on acute toxicity of fostamatinib in the 
mouse. A dose of 400 mg/kg dosed as two doses of 200 mg/kg 3 hours apart led to death of 1 male mouse 
out of 3 males and 3 females. As for the 200 mg/kg dose, no deaths occurred. Following dose administration 
of 200 mg/kg, ataxia and lethargy were observed. These animals were normal by the end of Day 1 and 
during the course of the study. Based on these findings, the high dose for the definitive mouse micronucleus 
study was set at 200 mg/kg.

*: All studies included at least one 2 or 4 week recovery group. 
Mouse 
A repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted in mice in order to set the doses for a 2-year carcino-genicity 
study. Fostamatinib was dosed b.i.d. with total daily doses of 0, 10, 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks. 
Target organs in the high dose group were liver (increased weight and AST) and spleen (decreased weight 
and lymphoid depletion) and bone marrow depletion. Reversibility was not determined, since no recovery 
group was included. NOAEL was set to 100 mg/kg/day. Safety margin to human exposure (AUC0-24htotal ~ 
11,000 ng/mL*h) was 4.23 (total) or 3.48 (free) for exposure in mice at 100 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24htotal = 
46,504 ng/mL*h). 
Rat 
Repeat–dose toxicity studies of 28 days duration including a 2 weeks recovery period was reported for both 
the active moiety R406 as free base and the calcium and the sodium salt of fostamatinib. Fostamatinib will be 
marketed as the sodium salt. The three studies showed overlap in target organs of toxicity, which included 
the expected hematopoetic hypocellularity, which is considered the pharmacological effect. The study of the 
free base R406 also revealed reduction in organ weights (liver, spleen and thymus). The study of the calcium 
salt of fostamatinib also showed reduction of weight of testes, uterus, pituitary and thyroids. Furthermore, 
mineralization of stomach, myocardial necrosis and chondrodystrophy were observed. In the final 28-days 
toxicity study, testicular atrophy and oligo/aspermia were observed confirming the finding in testes from the 
previous study on fostamatinib. The findings in bone was extended from the previous studies by an 
observation in femur of white creamy material surrounding the head. The chondroid findings appeared not to 
be reversible. In the study of the sodium salt of fostamatinib, the NOAEL was set to 17 mg/kg/day. This is 
supported. Safety margin to human exposure (AUC0-24htotal ~ 11,000 ng/mL*h) was 1.45 (total) or 1.79 
(free) for exposure in rat at 17 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24htotal = 15980 ng/mL*h). 
The pivotal 13/26-weeks toxicity study in rats was initiated with the same doses as the 28-days study with 
the sodium salt of fostamatinib, however the high dose had to be lowered for both male and female rats due 
to extensive clinical signs and low body weight gain showing already between day 12 and 27. Both the 13 
and the 26-weeks part of the study included recovery groups for all doses. See Table 3.2.3.2 for overview of 
study design.

The clinical signs were extensive and known from previous studies to demand dose reduction. This was seen 
especially in high dose female during the first few weeks of testing and included dehydration, loose fur/fur 
loss, pallor and thin body condition. Following the dose level reduction, from 60 mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day 
for males and to 30 mg/kg/day for females, clinical observations, during the first 13-week, diminished. It 
should although be mentioned here that, in up to two thirds of high dose females, misaligned, loose, missing, 
broken and malocclusion of teeth were noted from approximately 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. 
Clinical observations during the last 13 weeks of the Study, in animals at all dose levels, consisted primarily 
of observations related to reduced grooming. During the last 13-weeks of the study some animals were still 
noted with oral-dental malocclusion and/or teeth misalignment, however, the incidence of these findings was 
much lower than during the first 13 weeks of the study.  
Otherwise, similar pattern of findings related to pharmacological effect of fostamatinib was evident in this 
long term study, such as hematopoetic hypocellularity, dose-related decrease in organ weight (spleen and 
thymus). In addition changes in several hematological parameters were observed, however all changes were 
resolved at the end of the recovery period.  
The NOAEL was set to 17 mg/kg/day. This is supported. Safety margin to human exposure (AUC0-24htotal ~ 
11,000 ng/mL*h) was 1.85 (total) or 2.28 (free) for exposure in rat at 17 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24htotal = 20347 
ng/mL*h).  
Monkey 
A 28-days toxicity study including 2 weeks recovery in monkey was conducted with R406 besylate and not 
fostamatinib. Again, the main finding was mild to moderate hematopoietic hypocellularity in the high dose 
group with lower severity and incidence in the mid- and low-dose group. This effect is considered mild, 
reversible and related to the pharmacological effect of fostamatinib, hence it is agreed that the effect is of 
little importance in relation to toxicity. The NOAEL was set to 100 mg/kg/day. Safety margin to human

exposure (AUC0-24htotal ~ 11,000 ng/mL*h) was 2.3 (total) or 2.03 (free) for exposure in monkey at 100 
mg/kg/day (AUC0-24htotal = 25338 ng/mL*h). 
The pivotal 13/39-weeks toxicity study in monkeys was initiated with the same doses as the 13/26-weeks 
study in rats with fostamatinib sodium salt, however the high dose had to be lowered for both male and 
female monkeys due to poor clinical condition at the end of the 13-week period. At this time, two male 
monkeys had to be sacrificed in extremis. Both the 13 and the 39-weeks part of the study included recovery 
groups for the high dose group. Due to unscheduled sacrifice of two male animals, the number of animals in 
the 39-weeks part of the study was reduced. See Table 3.2.3.3 for overview of study design.  
Table 3.2.3.3. Overview of study design of 13/39-weeks toxicity study in monkey 
The incident of the two monkeys has been described as follows: As a result of the unscheduled sacrifice (due 
to poor clinical condition) of two males dosed at 60 mg/kg/day on Days 69 and 87, the high dose was 
reduced to 34 mg/kg/day from Day 92, after 13-weeks, for both sexes. The two males that were sacrificed 
were both assigned to the 39-week phase of the study.  The clinical signs noted in these animals included, 
but were not limited to: dark feces, pale in color (gums, mucus membranes, skin on face or tongue), slight or 
severely decreased activity, weakened appearance, crouching, decreased appetite, cold to touch, and 
partially closed eyes.  These signs appeared 3 to 4 days prior to sacrifice for both animals.  Hematological 
investigations of these animals identified very low red blood cell counts, hemoglobin and hematocrit 
concentrations, and very elevated levels of reticulocytes.  At necropsy, changes observed in one or both of 
these animals included but were not limited to: pale kidneys, liver, pituitary, lungs, pancreas, stomach and 
spleen, marrow, and urinary bladder.  In one animal, the caecum, colon, ileum, jejunum, and duodenum 
were also noted as being pale; in the other animal, dark material (possibly melena) was noted as being 
present in the caecum, colon, and rectum.  As mentioned above, both animals were found to have severe 
anemia, possibly related to blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, although a source was not identified. It 
has been concluded that the etiology of morbidity and possible linkage to treatment for two male primates 
dosed at 60 mg/kg/day prior to Week 13 remains equivocal.  Thus, a measure of uncertainty exists if the 
MTD was exceeded in this study. The NOAEL was considered to be 17 mg/kg/day, when administered orally 
bid for both 13 and 39 weeks to cynomolgus monkeys. This conclusion is supported, as all other findings 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 36/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
were either minimal, reversible or observed in the control group at similar incidence. The only consistent 
findings in the groups dosed with fostamatinib and not found in control groups are findings related to the 
pharmacological effect of fostamatinib, namely hematopoetic hypocellularity, which seemed to be reversible. 
However, the signs of loose or liquid faeces observed with a slightly higher incidence in the high dose group 
during the last weeks of the 13-week period, should also be mentioned here, since diarrhoea is a common 
adverse effect in patients (SmPC). 
Safety margin to human exposure (AUC0-24htotal ~ 11,000 ng/mL*h) was 0.91 (total) or 0.81 (free) for 
exposure in monkey at 17 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24htotal = 10052 ng/mL*h). 
Genotoxicity 
Fostamatinib was tested in a battery of genotoxicity tests. Bacterial reverse mutation assays were conducted 
on both the active moiety R406 and the prodrug R788 of two different salts, namely the sodium salt 
(fostamatinib) and the calcium salt. The studies were performed to GLP with use of adequate positive 
controls with and without rat S9 activation. Rat S9 activation is considered adequate, since the metabolism 
seemed similar between species and no unique human metabolite was identified. All three studies were 
performed with three strains of salmonella and one E coli and outcome was deemed negative. This is agreed. 
An in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration test was conducted with the active moiety R406 in human 
peripheral blood lymphocytes. This test was also conducted with adequate positive controls and with and 
without S9 activation. This test also came out negative for genotoxicity, which is agreed. 
The mouse in vivo micronucleus study was performed in two phases, in which the first phase was intended 
for finding the dose range for the final study. The final study was conducted with R406 besylate dosed 20, 60 
or 200 mg/kg euthanizing after 24 hours. Animals in the other two groups were treated either with the 
negative control or R406 besylate, at a dose of 200 mg/kg and were euthanized 48 hours after treatment.  
Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg was used as positive control. The study was interpreted as negative for 
chromosomal aberration even though males from the high dose group showed a significantly higher incidence 
of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes compared to vehicle, mid and low dose groups, see table 
3.2.3.4 below This is agreed, since the number is low and within historical control values. Supporting data to 
justify the toxicokinetics in the mouse micronucleus test have been provided. These comprised of day 1 
toxicokinetics data from the carcinogenicity study, which bracketed the high dose in the micronucleus 
study.In conclusion, no studies indicated a genotoxic potential of R406, the active moiety of fostamatinib or 
of fostamatinib itself.

Carcinogenicity 
Mouse 
The mouse carcinogenicity study design and conduct appear to be in line with Guidance on carcinogenic 
potential, CPMP/SWP/2877/00. The study was initiated with dose groups of 60 male and 60 female mice, 
which were administered fostamatinib, via oral gavage, bid (approximately 6 hours apart) at dose levels of 
50, 150, 500, and 1200 mg/kg/day for up to 104 weeks. The study also included adequate number of 
animals for toxicokinetic evaluation. The dose of 500 mg/kg/day was reduced to 250 mg/kg/day after one 
year due to increased mortality at that particular dose. The high dose group (1200 mg/kg/day), was 
terminated very early in the study and was not subjected to histopathology evaluation. This is acceptable due 
to the premature time in the study (Day 14 for males and Day 44 females) and the fact that three lower dose 
groups were still present in the study. However, it is unclear why the dose group of 1200 mg/kg/day was 
initiated in the first place. It is acknowledged that the mouse 13-week study did not explicitly provided a 
maximum tolerated dose (High dose was 300 mg/kg), but 1200 mg/kg/day dosed to 120 animals seems to 
be going a bit too far in terms of 3R principles. As for the remainder of the animals, all animals including 
animals dead or euthanized early in the study, were subjected to microscopic evaluation. Adverse 
microscopic findings showed in general higher incidence in animals, which died early, than in animals

surviving to scheduled necropsy, indicating that fostamatinib induced higher mortality in a dose related 
manner in the study.  
Mortality measured as percent surviving to scheduled necropsy (Day 729-733) was as follows for male 
animals in water, vehicle, 50, 150 mg/kg/day: 43, 53, 45, and 37%.  In the 500/250 mg/kg/day group, the 
terminal necropsy occurred on Day 555 after the number of surviving males reached 15 animals (25%). 
Mortality measured as percent surviving to scheduled necropsy (Day 729-733) was as follows for female 
animals in water, vehicle, 50, 150 mg/kg/day: 38, 38, 45, and 53%.  In the 500/250 mg/kg/day group, the 
terminal necropsy occurred on Day 494 after the number of surviving females reached 15 animals. 
This is also in line with clinical signs of poor health, which progression appeared to be faster in the highest 
dose group. Fostamatinib-related clinical findings noted during the study included increased incidences of 
limb function impairment and rigid body at 500/250 mg/kg/day in both sexes, which likely correlated to 
microscopic findings of increased bone growth plate thickening involving the sternum of both sexes at ≥ 150 
mg/kg/day and the proximal femur (head and/or greater trochanter) of both sexes at 500/250 mg/kg/day.  
These microscopic observations were sometimes macroscopically evident as bone deformity/malformation 
and surface irregularities.  Additionally, vertebra from 4 females dosed with 500/250 mg/kg/day that were 
observed with macroscopically irregular surfaces, were microscopically examined and also exhibited growth 
plate thickening.  Bone growth plate thickening is commonly observed in compounds that inhibit angiogenesis 
(Hall, Westwood et al. 2006).  Increased incidences of hunched posture were also noted in both sexes at ≥ 
150 mg/kg/day.  In addition, higher incidences of thinness noted at 500/250 mg/kg/day correlated with the 
body weight effects noted in that group. This is supported. The findings related to chondrodystrophy is 
probably caused by the off target effect of fostamatinib as an inhibitor of VEGF. This was shown as an 
inhibition of VEGF-induced downstream pathways (IC50 = 0.34 µM, 1083KY), which is likely to be responsible 
for the adverse effect of increase in blood pressure as well. Cmax in patients is reported to be 830 ng/mL 
corresponding to 1.13 µM - 3 times higher than IC50 on VEGF.  
It is also acknowledged, that fostamatinib did not appear to increase number of tumors or severity of cancer 
in this study. Tumour incidence has been summarised as follows: Microscopically, there were no 
fostamatinib-related carcinogenic findings.  There were no statistically significant increases in the incidence of 
neoplasms in the fostamatinib dosed groups compared to controls.  All neoplasms in the study were of the 
type generally seen in mice of this age and strain.  A few non-neoplastic microscopic findings were noted that 
were consistent with those seen in compounds with this pharmacological profile. The conclusion is supported. 
Rat 
The rat carcinogenicity study design and conduct appear to be in line with Guidance on carcinogenic 
potential, CPMP/SWP/2877/00. Four treatment groups of 60 male rats were administered fostamatinib 
sodium at respective dose levels of 10, 25, 45, or 80 mg/kg/day. Four treatment groups of 60 female rats 
were administered the test article at respective dose levels of 5, 12, 24, or 40 mg/kg/day. The study also 
included adequate number of animals for toxicokinetic evaluation. The vehicle or fostamatinib was 
administered via oral gavage, twice a day (approximately 6 hours apart) for at least 104 consecutive weeks 
as survival or early termination allowed. Additionally, 10 groups of 3 or 12 animals/sex/group served as 
toxicokinetic (TK) animals. An adequate number of animals survived to scheduled necropsy, See Table 
3.2.3.5 below.

Table 3.2.3.5. Survival to terminal necropsy of main study groups (of 60 animals in each group) 
However, it should be noted here that dosing had to be ceased for all females at 40 mg/kg/day due to rapidly 
decreasing survival, as well as a mean body weight decrease that exceeded that of the 80 mg/kg/day males 
that were terminated early on Day 95. On Day 612, dosing ceased for all males at 45 mg/kg/day after 
reaching a survival level of 20 animals. On Day 619, dosing ceased for all females at 24 mg/kg/day after 
reaching a survival level of 20 animals. The animals remained on study and evaluations were continued for 
these three main study groups until the scheduled terminal necropsy. All animals were subjected to 
microscopic evaluation except males dosed 80 mg/kg/day. 
Clinical findings expected to be drug related were degenerative changes of odontodysplasia, impaired limb 
function and decreased body weight associated with decreased food consumption. 
Microscopic evaluation revealed findings of thickening of the epiphyseal growth plate associated with, 
hypertrophic chondrocytes especially in the high dose groups. Mesangial nephropathy with increase in matrix 
of the glomerulus and large amounts of protein in the lumen of tubules was noted in a few female animals. 
Lymphoid depletion was observed in the mesenteric lymph node, thymus and spleen. Stomach ulcer/erosion 
and epithelial hyperplasia was observed at slightly higher incidence in both male and female animals, which 
died on study. Angiectasis/cystic degeneration in adrenal glands was found in slightly higher incidence in high 
dose male rats. Adrenal gland fibrosis (mild to moderate) was found in mid and high dose female rats. 
A new finding, not observed in previous studies of shorter duration, was dose-related odontodysplasia, see 
table 3.2.3.6 for male rats. The incidence of this finding was similar in female rats. The effect was deemed 
minimal to moderate, however probably not relevant for humans as rat teeth keep growing over their full 
lifespan.

Table 3.2.3.6. Insert from Summary of Microscopic Observations – Male rats 
A finding observed in rat carcinogenicity study and not in previous repeat-dose toxicity studies was mesangial 
nephropathy with increase in matrix of the glomerulus and large amounts of protein in the lumen of tubules. 
This finding was observed in female animals, which died on study at dose 24 mg/kg/day (6/44, moderate to 
severe) and dose 40 mg/kg/day (5/45, mild to severe). The finding of mesangial nephropathy in the rat 
carcinogenicity studyare considered to be of limited clinical relevance, since no such findings were seen in the 
s9 months study in monkeys and 6-months studies in rats. Furthermore, clinical experiences do not reveal 
concerns for nephropathy. 
As for tumour findings, they have been summarised as follows: Microscopically, there were no statistically 
significant increases in tumor incidence noted. Neoplasms seen in the study were of the type generally seen 
in rats of this strain. No tumors were found in higher incidence or in a dose-related manner. Hence, the 
conclusion that fostamatinib is not carcinogenic is supported. It should be noted here, that the high dose 
groups in this study only provide a low safety margin to human exposure, although in a similar range as the 
other studies of 4 to 26 weeks duration in rat. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
Groups of 25 male and 25 virgin female Crl:CD(SD) rats were administered fostamatinib, via oral gavage, bid 
(approximately 6 hours apart) at dose levels of 0, 5, 14, and 40 mg/kg/day for males, and 0, 5, 11 and 
25 mg/kg/day for females.  The males were treated for 28 days before pairing until the day before scheduled 
necropsy.  The females were treated for 14 days before pairing, throughout mating, and until Day 7 of 
gestation.  Clinical condition, body weights and food consumption were monitored throughout the study. No 
mortality occurred and no clinical observations were deemed to be related to fostamatinib treatment. 
Male fertility 
All mating, sperm assessments and organ weight parameters in the male rats were unaffected by dosages of 
fostamatinib as high as 40 mg/kg/day. The apparent reduced fertility was suggested to be due to females 
being exposed to fostamatinib as well. However, since both males and females were treated simultaneous in 
the study, an effect on males cannot be excluded. Testicular atrophy and oligo/aspermia was observed in the 
28 days toxicity study in main study rats, but not in the recovery group. Based on weight of evidence from all 
toxicity studies, fostamatinib most likely does not impact male fertility. 
Female fertility 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 41/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
The fertility and pregnancy indices were both significantly (p ≤ 0.01) reduced at 25 mg/kg/day. This reduction 
was suggested to be related to treatment with fostamatinib even though the numbers were within historical 
control values. 
Embryonic development 
The average number of nonviable embryos and percentage nonviable embryos per litter (post-implantation 
loss) at 25 mg/kg/day increased to 40.0% and 44.0%, respectively, compared to control values. The 
difference was not statistically significant, however still deemed related to fostamatinib treatment, since the 
average number of nonviable embryos per litter was outside of the historical control range of the testing 
facility. 
It is therefore concluded that fostamatinib exert adverse effects on female fertility and embryonic survival. 
This is adequately described in SmPC section 4.6 and 5.3. 
Embryofetal development 
Rat 
The study of embryofetal development in rat included groups of 25 pre-mated female rats, which were dosed 
via oral gavage bid at dose levels of 0, 5, 12.5 or 25 mg/kg/day. Rats were dosed on GD6 to 17 and 
subjected to caesarean examination on gestation day 20 were litter parameters were recorded. The study 
included TK animals. 
Significant reduction in body weight and gravid uterine weight was observed, corresponding with an increase 
in post implantation loss for the 25 mg/kg/day group. 
Edema was noted in 6 fetuses in one 25 mg/kg litter. Covariate-adjusted fetal weights (male, female and 
both sexes) at 25 mg/kg/day were significantly (p<0.01) decreased (by approximately 15%) when compared 
with controls. Significant (p<0.01) increases in the fetal and litter incidence of the fetal soft tissue variations 
including: absent innominate artery, renal pelvic cavitation and dilated ureters occurred at a dose of 25 
mg/kg/day when compared with control. Fetal head variations in ventricles (dilated lateral) was observed at 
25 mg/kg/day. Significant, treatment-related fetal soft tissue malformations were seen only at 25 mg/kg/day 
and included heart and/or great vessel malformations (22 fetuses in 15 litters) and renal agenesis (22 
fetuses in 13 litters). A filamentous uterine horn was observed in a single high dose animal (25 mg/kg/day). 
Fetal skeletal malformation were observed at all dose levels, however, were only considered treatment 
related in the high dose animals. The malformations included forked and/or fused ribs, vertebral anomalie 
and split sternebrae. Malformations and variations considered clearly treatment-related (involving the major 
vessels and especially the renal system) and found in a high incidence, were not seen in the lower dose 
levels. 
On gestation day 21, dam plasma R406 concentrations were greater than in the fetuses. The dam/fetus 
plasma concentration ratio ranged from 4.9 to 10.5 at all three dose levels. 
In conclusion, in rat, fostamatinib appear to induce major vessel, renal/urogenital system and skeletal 
malformation in foetuses of fostamatinib-dosed dams (25 mg/kg/day). The malformations are most likely 
induced by the off-target effects of fostamtinib by inhibiting VEGF. This effect on embryofetal development in 
rat is adequate described in SmPC section 4.6 and 5.3.

Developmental toxicity including the teratogenic potential was also evaluated in the rabbit. Each dosing group 
consisted of 23 pregnant rabbits. These were dosed from GD7 to 19 and sacrificed at the time of ceasarian 
evaluation on Day 29. Rabbits were dosed either vehicle, 10, 22 or 50 mg/kg/day (oral gavage bid). The 
study included TK evaluation with maternal/fetal ratio of exposure. As for the rats, the main target organ for 
malformations in foetuses were the kidney and tissues associated with the kidney. Furthermore, 
malformations in patterns of vessel development from aorta was evident. These findings were observed at 
the higher doses 22 and 50 mg/kg/day with lower precedence in 22 mg/kg/day group. Rabbits seem to be 
less sensitive to fetal malformation as compared to the rat. NOAEL for maternal toxicity was set to 22 
mg/kg/day and for fetal development at 10 mg/kg/day.  
In general, the maternal plasma R406 concentrations were greater than the fetal plasma R406 
concentrations. The maternal/fetal plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0.9 to 14.8 at all three dose levels 
investigated. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
The purpose of this study was to detect adverse effects of fostamatinib treatment of female rats from 
implantation through lactation and weaning on gestation, parturition, lactation and maternal behavior and on 
the development of the F1 generation offspring of the treated F0 generation female rats. F0 dams were 
administered fostamatinib or the vehicle via oral gavage twice daily from day 7 of presumed gestation (GD 7) 
through day 20 of lactation (LD 20). The dosage levels were 0 (Vehicle), 2.5, 12.5, and 25 mg/kg/day. 
Observations were continued through sexual maturity of the F1 generation rats, and fetal gross external and 
soft tissue evaluations of F2 generation fetuses were conducted. 
F0 generation rats showed reductions in body weight gain, feed consumption values and signs of dehydration 
in the 25 mg/kg/day dosage group during the gestation and lactation periods.  
F1 generation showed reduced viability as pups and impaired growth in both mid and high doses groups. In 
the high dose group, several findings were observed. 1) Delay in sexual maturation, which correlation with 
body weight reductions. 2) Edema and swelling of paws and/or limbs. 3) Necropsy revealed agenesis or 
dysmorphogenesis of several organs (kidney, ureter, reproductive structures including testes and 
epididymis). 
There was no adverse behavioural effects in the F1 generation male and female rats, based on performance 
in watermaze and passive avoidance tests, no remarkable immunological compromise as determined by 
developmental immunotoxicity testing, and no effects on mating or fertility. 
As for the F2 generation, no adverse effects were observed. 
In conclusion, fostamatinib was highly toxic to F1 generation of dams treated with 12.5 or 25 mg/kg/day, 
leading to organ malformation and/or agenesis. The effects did not translate to the F2 generation. The 
wording in SmPC section 4.6. is considered adequate and even specify that pregnancies occuring during 
clinical trials resulted in stillbirth/spontaneous abortion or miscarriages. 
Juvenile animals 
A study in juvenile rabbits was conducted in order to confirm the findings of chondrodystrophy and teeth 
malformations observed in rat toxicity studies. The study also served as supporting information for seeking a 
waiver of clinical trials in children. 
Juvenile rabbits were dosed from 9 weeks of age for four weeks at doses 0, 10, 30 or 60 mg/kg/day. As 
expected, histopathology revealed treatment related dysplasia in growth plates. Also reduced bone marrow 
Assessment report

Page 43/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
cellularity, haemorrhage into the bone marrow and even fractures were observed in these animals. Bone 
findings were limited to mid and high dose groups. It should be mentioned, that necrotic ovarian follicles 
were observed in female rabbits at all dose levels. Both findings are consistent with VEGF inhibition. No 
NOAEL was identified in this study of fostamatinib in juvenile rabbits, hence no safety margin can be 
calculated. It is agreed that fostamatinib should not be indicated for children. The juvenile rabbit study is 
mentioned in section 5.3. of SmPC. In regard of the necrotic ovarian follicles observed in female rabbits at all 
dose levels only studies in juvenile rabbits showed degenerate and necrotic ovarian follicles. In the 
developmental toxicity study in adult rabbits (G-935788-0006), the mean number of corpora lutea and 
implantations compared favourably with the control across all groups. There was no evidence, for 
degenerate/necrotic ovarian follicles at necropsy. Conversely, it needs to be emphasized, that rabbits are 
induced ovulators and even in the absence of mating ovulation may be induced. 
However, this ovarian follicular change has not been reported in any other study in rodents or especially in 
primates included in the chronic and carcinogenicity studies that were up to 2 years in duration. 
Nevertheless, even though the findings that occurred in the juvenile rabbit study should have no clinical 
impact for women of childbearing potential the following information has been added in section 5.3 of the 
SmPC: “Increased degenerate/necrotic ovarian follicles occurred in females at all fostamatinib dose levels 
(including 10 mg/kg/day), since the changes noted in the growth plates and ovaries are consistent with an 
anti-angiogenic effect.”  
Toxicokinetic data 
As for toxicokinetics, exposure to the active moiety of fostamatinib R406 was well documented throughout 
the studies in mice, rats and monkeys. R406 showed some indications of nonlinear kinetics in the low end of 
the dose-range as if a clearance pathway become saturated, when doses increase. There was generally dose 
linearity between the mid and the high dose. There was observed gender differences in exposure in the 
rodent studies, where male mice showed higher exposure than female mice, whereas for the rat, it was the 
opposite way around. In vitro metabolism studies indicated that gender differences in clearance capacity of 
CYPs could be an explanation. Gender differences in exposure for the monkey could not be concluded upon, 
perhaps due to low number of animals and/or large variability in exposure between animals. 
Bioanalysis was conducted to GLP under an audit program. Control samples were analysed for R406 in the 
mouse and the monkey study, but this important study quality marker of study conduct was apparently 
omitted in the rat study. Other data (dosing solution analysis) from the pivotal toxicity study in rats without 
toxicokinetic samples from control animals have been considered. These data indicate that the study was 
most likely not invalidated by these missing data, however cannot rule it out entirely. 
Safety margins were calculated for all the GLP-compliant studies of R406 and fostamatinib. Safety margins 
are low and ranged from 0.55 to 1.85 in the rat (total) with the highest safety margin for the study of longest 
duration. The rat showed a range of target organs for the high dose groups including liver, heart and 
stomach, which are also organs showing adverse effects in patients. The identified adverse reactions 
requiring dose modification are hypertension, hepatotoxicity, diarrhoea and neutropenia (SmPC). In the rat, 
liver weights were reduced and in the mouse, centrilobular hypertrophy associated with increased AST was 
observed. The most prominent finding in the animals were bone marrow depletion or hematopoetic 
hypocellularity, which in turn may have led to neutropenia and is a common side effect in patient (6%). 
Monkeys seem to be less sensitive to organ toxicity compared to rat and mouse, however diarrhea was 
observed for the first 13 weeks of the 13-39 weeks study in monkey. Safety margin is close to unity for the 
monkey (0.91 total) in the 13/39 weeks study. Most of the observations from animal toxicity studies were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 44/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
predictive for adverse effects in patients. The chondrodystrophy/ growth plate dysplasia in rodents and rabbit 
may be related to off target inhibition of VEGFR (Hall, Westwood et al, 2006) and is limited to actively 
growing bones (before growth plate closure). This finding should not be an issue in adult patients, where 
growth plate closure has occurred. However this was not out ruled in adult patients by any experimental 
means. It is however described by literature that closures of epiphysis in the bones of the upper limbs are 
found during the age of 14-18 years of human life, whereas epiphyseal closures of lower limbs (femur and 
tibia) are found during 18-25 years of age. A warning in regards to this aspect has been included in the 
SmPC. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
The potential direct immunotoxic effect of fostamatinib was evaluated in three mouse models, the 
streptococcal, influenza and listeria host resistance models. Neither model indicated that fostamatinib 
impaired bacterial clearance in lung tissue from mice pretreated with fostamatinib for 7 days, 21 or 27 days. 
Dose levels selected were in the range of 10 to 80 mg/kg/day. Supportive toxicokinetic data from the mouse 
toxicity study indicate that the exposure for the high dose of mouse immunotoxicity studies was 
pharmacologically active and also provided a safety margin to patient exposure. 
Furthermore, these models only evaluate the immune response to new foreign patogens. It is unclear how 
fostamatinib will affect the adaptive immune system, especially immune cell mediated responses that are 
guided by antigen-antibody complexes. On this ground, the effect of fostamatinib on specific antibody 
production by antibody-dependent B cells may be dependent on the context of immunization. Generally, 
nonclinical data indicate that fostamatinib induce only modest if any inhibition of the general immune system. 
Nevertheless, fostamatinib appears to have an adverse effect on the general immune system by increasing 
occurrence of opportunistic infections in fostamatinib treated patients and inducing neutropenia. However, 
this concern is adequately handled in SmPC section 4.4 as special warnings (Neutropenia) and in 4.8. where 
both effects are listed as common adverse drug reactions. 
Impurities 
A number of identified impurities were evaluated in the Ames test. Some impurities are demonstrated to be 
consistently purged below the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) and others are subject to specification 
limits. All studies on genotoxic potential of impurities were conducted in compliance with GLP except the one 
on the genotoxic impurity 3,4,5 trimethoxyaniline (TMA). TMA was identified as a potential genotoxic impurity 
in a non-GLP compliant Ames test, (i.e., no positive control was included in the study). The lack GLP-
compliance in this study of genotoxic potential of TMA has been justified by ensuring that TMA is controlled to 
comply with TTC as per ICH M7. 
Phototoxicity 
The phototoxic potential of R406 Besylate was evaluated in Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts as described in 
OECD guidelines 432 and to GLP. R406 showed limited cytotoxic potential both with and without UVA light, 
therefore fostamatinib and it’s prodrug R406 provide limited concern for phototoxicity.  
Fostamatinib Combination Treatment with Rosuvastatin in APOE*3 Leiden Mice 
The combination treatment of fostamatinib and rosuvastatin appear to be excessively hepatotoxic in APOE*3 
Leiden mice. On this effect prescribers are given the most relevant information from a human drug

interaction study in which it was shown that fostamatinib increased exposure of rosuvastatin by 
approximately 100%. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Regarding the Environmental Risk Assessment the logKow, a parameter for predicting the distribution of a 
substance in various environmental compartments, is -0.6 for Fostamatinib and 3.63 for Fostamatinib RIG-C. 
Both values are below the trigger 4.5. However, since the PECsurfacewater exceeds the action limit of 0.01 μg/L a 
further Phase II assessment is still required. The applicant has committed to provide this study in the post-
approval phase. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology  
The Application regards the development of a competitive inhibitor of SYK in treatment of ITP. R406, the 
active metabolite of Fostamatinib, in vitro potently inhibits SYK activity in human, mouse and rat. Since 
amino acid sequences of SYK kinases are highly conserved between mammals, the monkey and rabbit used 
in the nonclinical safety studies can be considered as R406 pharmacological relevant species.  
Fostamatinib was shown to mitigate antibody-induced thrombocytopenia in mice, which is consistent with 
suppression by SYK inhibition of FcγR-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages. However, R406 also inhibited 
SYK-dependent collagen-mediated platelet activation, but not platelet activation induced with ADP. High 
systemic exposures of R406 did not prolong bleeding times in mice with normal platelet count. Thus, the data 
indicates that R406 is unlikely to severely affect hemostasis in patients with normal platelet count. As 
fostamatinib is to be used in patients with thrombocytopenia, it might cause prolonged bleeding, when 
collagen-mediated platelet activation is inhibited, however clinical and nonclinical data collectively show that 
this effect is most likely not clinically relevant.  
Secondary pharmacology studies revealed that R406 had antagonistic effects on adenosine A3 receptor as a 
Ki of 17nM is very close to the Ki for SYK. The A3 receptor by antagonists may prove beneficial in 
inflammatory diseases, since antagonists are in clinical development against psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. 
This indicates that the A3 receptor target is not likely to be of any safety concern for the use of fostamatinib.  
Furthermore, R406 had binding Kd values equal to or more potent than the SYK Kd for 16 other kinases. 
Most of these targets appear to be clinically relevant and can be linked to various identified adverse drug 
reactions and risks, which are adequately handled in SmPC and RMP. Others appear to provide a beneficial 
effect in the indication. 
Safety pharmacology studies revealed no clinically relevant effects on CNS and the respiratory system. 
However, clear effects were found on the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular effect of R406 and 
fostamatinib were investigated in a range on non-GLP compliant study in rats. A single dose of fostamatinib 
evoked a dose-dependent elevation in BP in conscious telemetered male Sprague Dawley rats.  The blood 
pressure elevation is suggested to be a consequence of increased vascular resistance or impaired 
vasorelaxation due to inhibition of VEGF-induced endothelial nitric oxide release, both induced by 
fostamatinib/R406. The time course of the BP effect correlated closely with changes in R406 plasma 
concentration with an estimated EC50 of 20nM, which is comparable to the mean free plasma concentration of 
R406 (49 nM) in patients.

Pharmacokinetics 
Fostamatinib is converted to R406 in the gastrointestinal tract before absorption. Single dose 
pharmacokinetics of R406 was determined in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys after oral administration of 
R406 or fostamatinib. Bioavailability of R406 from oral fostamatinib dosing was between 40% to 80%.  
Pharmacokinetics of R406 appear to be dose proportional at the doses tested in single dose studies with the 
exception of rabbits having a higher than dose proportional increase in AUC. Gender related differences were 
seen in mice and rats.  
Protein binding of R406 is high in all species tested. Some distribution to red blood cells was seen, but the 
distribution to red blood cells appeared to be reversible. 
R406 is widely distributed to all tissues with the exception of the CNS following oral dosing of 14C-
fostamatinib. R406 is apparently not able to cross the blood-brain barrier.  
Metabolite profiles have been investigated in mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys and humans. There were no 
human specific metabolites in plasma. R406 is the major metabolite of fostamatinib in all species and no 
plasma metabolite represented greater than 10% of R406 exposure. R406 is in human primarily metabolised 
to O-Glucuronide of R529 (O-demethylated R406), O-Sulfate of R529 and N-Glucuronide of R406. All three 
phase 2 metabolites are present in monkeys. 
R406 was cleared at a low rate compared to hepatic blood flow with short half-life (ranging from 0.58 to 3.41 
hours), with the exception of the mice, in which higher clearance and shorter half-lives were observed. 
Faecal excretion was the primary route of excretion with approximately 80% of radioactivity excreted in 
faeces in all species tested. Urinary excretion covered from 4% to 19%.  
There was no evidence of R406 accumulation after twice-a-day dosing of fostamatinib in all species. 
Fostamatinib and R406 were not substrates of human BCRP in an in vitro vesicle test system.  However, 
fostamatinib and R406 were potent inhibitors of human BCRP mediated transport of 3H-estrone-3-sulfate in 
the same system.  This interaction has been further investigated in a clinical study where fostamatinib co-
administration increased the AUC of rosuvastatin by approximately 2- fold.  
Toxicology 
In general, the toxicological endpoints previously described as off-target class effects of antiangiogenic 
VEGFR inhibiting medicinal products have been confirmed for Fostamatinib. The extrapolation of the NOAELs 
derived from several animal model to the Human Equivalent Dose (HED) demonstrate consistently an 
alarming narrow safety window of less than 1.  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies revealed that fostamatinib is toxic in animal species at exposure only 3-4 times 
typical patient exposure. Some toxicity could be ascribed to exaggerated pharmacology such as 
hematopoietic hypocellularity, which were consistently found in all studies. Fostamatinib was found to reduce 
fertility and to be teratogenic in rat and to induce bone malformations in the juvenile rabbit. The rat seemed 
to be the most sensitive species. In this species several off target findings were evident e.g. 
chondrodystrophy and teeth malformations, which were consistently found in growing rats and rabbits 
probably due to VEGF inhibition. This finding is not expected to be an issue in adult patients, where growth 
plate closure has occurred. Whether the changed bone metabolism is also relevant for young adult ITP 
patients and/or patients at risk of osteoporosis is not entirely clear. This concern was not out ruled in adult 
patients by any experimental means.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 47/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Other concerns derived from preclinical studies are the findings in several developmental and 
perinatal/postnatal reproduction studies in rats and rabbits. Fertility studies in rats demonstrated a 
significantly reduced pregnancy rate as well as an increased number of nonviable embryos at higher doses. 
Fostamatinib did not only induce increased maternal toxicity but also increased post-implantation loss, and 
decreased uterine weights, growth retardation of the foetus as well as variations and malformations of the 
offspring. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was considered 5 mg/kg/day. These toxicities were 
confirmed by the rabbit as 2nd animal species. Segment III studies addressing the pre- and postnatal 
development confirmed these findings. Also with this regard reference is made to the literature and to well-
described off-target class effects.  
It may be assumed that prescription of Fostamatinib does not exclude women of child-bearing potential. The 
findings regarding animal reproduction studies are listed in the Summary of products characteristics under 
section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use). The use of fostamatinib is contraindicated during 
pregnancy in 4.6 (Fertility, pregnancy and lactation).  
Fostamatinib was found to be severely liver toxic when administered in combination with rosuvastatin in 
APOE* Leiden mice. However these effects were ascribed to very high exposure, which was not clinically 
relevant. Instead, prescriber are informed of the results of a clinical drug interaction study between 
fostamatinib and rosuvastatin in SmPC. 
Applicant committed to perform a standard Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis post approval, 
since PECsurfacewater was above the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. The analysis should focus on the active metabolite 
of fostamatinib; R406.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Fostamatinib (administered as fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) is an immediate-release tablet intended 
for twice daily (bid) oral administration for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). 
Fostamatinib (also referred to as R935788 or R788) is a prodrug that undergoes dephosphorylation in the 
gastrointestinal tract through the action of gut alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to produce R940406 (R406), the 
parent drug/active metabolite. The major analyte found in plasma is R406. Fostamatinib is typically not 
detected in plasma. 
The pharmacokinetics of fostamatinib (R788) and/or its active metabolite R406 were evaluated in 28 clinical 
pharmacology or biopharmaceutic studies, one phase II study (Study D4300-022) and 3 phase III studies 
(Study C788-047, C788-048 and extension study C788-049). Data from the target patient population is 
limited to the findings of the PK substudy of extension trial C788-049 in twelve patients on 150mg bid as well 
as plasma levels taken at different time points from the phase II and III trials at varying dose levels. 
Furthermore, a population PK analysis has been submitted, which included data from 10 Phase I studies in 
healthy volunteers, four phase II studies and three phase III studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 
finally, data from the three phase III studies in patients with ITP. 
Methods 
All bioanalysis was conducted by LC-MS/MS and was in general adequately performed and documented. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental methods in WinNonlin. Pop PK and PD 
analyses were run in NONMEM with FOCEI. SAS and Excel was used for data preparation and R for data 
presentation. Descriptive statistics for pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using conventional software 
and methods (WinNonlin, Microsoft Excel or SAS). 
Evaluation and Qualification of Models  
A two-compartment population model with simultaneous first- and zero-order delayed absorption and first-
order elimination was developed in HV and RA patients. Significant identified covariates were body weight 
and population. Body weight was linearly correlated with CL and V2 with exponents 0.662 and 1.23, 
respectively. Final estimates were with good precision (%RSE≤8.4%), however, IIV was high (>39-104%) 
and highest for ka and D1 describing the absorption phase. In addition, shrinkage for the IIV estimates was 
high (≥50.6%), except for CL (10.6%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 50/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
The high variability and high shrinkage for the parameters describing the conversion of fostamatinib to R406 
in the gut and the absorption is also evident from GoF plots where the fit is poorer at higher concentrations.  
The VPC’s representing 4 different doses is shown in Figure 15. A large amount of observations around Tmax 
falls outside the 95th percentile of model predicted concentrations. Hence, the provided model is considered 
a supportive tool, to evaluate the effect of certain intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but should not be used to 
establish firm recommendations in the SmPC.

The final population PK model developed in HV and RA subjects was rerun after incorporating the ITP 
population data. The dataset included 18044 observations from 2526 subjects (419 HV, 1994 RA patients, 
and 113 ITP patients). The final population PK model was also fitted to the ITP data after all model 
parameters were fixed to the population values, except for the IIV terms. The individual predicted 
concentrations were well correlated with the observed concentrations (Figure 2). It is expected that the 
addition of 332 observations from ITP patients would have limited influence on the established model.  
E-R relationships were evaluated for safety variables BP, ALT, BILI and ANC, and blood platelet count for 
efficacy. Of the 2535 subjects included in the PK/PD data set, 1675 subjects were on active treatment, of 
these were 102 subjects (6%) ITP patients with 3 blood samples taken per study (1 at Weeks 2, 6, and 24). 
Only PD data from ITP patients were included in the blood pressure analysis.

The probability of blood pressure increase (systolic and diastolic) was investigated both with regard to 
category (grade) and time-course. The daily R406 exposure seemed to slightly increase at higher grades and 
a linear regression model best described the probability of BP increase to exposure (DAUC). 
The probability of experiencing Grade 3 and 4 BP was relatively low, with the highest probability observed in 
older subjects with a history of hypertension at baseline. The maximum increase in SBP and DBP was 
predicted to be about 10 mmHg. The EC50 was 16 µg×h/mL which is close to the mean exposure after 150 
mg bid fosatmatinib. Increase of R406 exposure had little effect on ALT, AST and BILI.  
A linear Emax model best described the effect of R406 exposure on the probability of ANC grades (neutrophil 
decrease). All regression parameters were determined with acceptable precision. The Black/African-American

race and body weight remained significant predictors of Emax and EC50. Although the effect of R406 exposure 
on race resulted in 2.3 times higher probability and a higher body weight seemed to decrease the probability 
of neutrophil decrease, the effect was limited.  
The time-course of effect of treatment on neutrophil levels was also evaluated by a sigmoidal Imax function 
with a proportional error model. All parameters were estimated with good precision. The IIV was high (62.2 – 
135%) for all parameters except baseline neutrophil count (BM0) (34.4%) and Imax (9%) with a shrinkage ≥
47.2% for all IIV estimates except for BM0. No bootstrap evaluation was performed. The maximum decrease 
in neutrophil count was predicted to be 662×10E6/L. 
The efficacy of R406 exposure in regard to platelet response was evaluated by linear regression at Week 12 
since data were too sparse in Weeks 14-24 with only one observation per subject/week. IIV could not be 
estimated.  
The probability of achieving a positive response at Week 12 was about 33% after 150 mg bid fostamatinib. Of 
note, the primary efficacy endpoint in the two conducted Phase 3 placebo-controlled trials was stable platelet 
response i.e. a platelet count of ≥50,000 counts/µL on at least 4 of the 6 visits between Week 14 to 24. It 
was not possible to fit a continuous PK/PD model for the platelet count-time profiles.

Absorption  
Exposure to fostamatinib was assessed in Studies C788-001, C788-003, C788-004, C788-005, C788-014, 
and D4300-007. Fostamatinib is rapidly converted into highly permeable R406 in the gut and then absorbed. 
In vitro studies have indicated that R406 is a substrate of P-gp, but not BCRP, OCT2 or OATP1B3. The mean 
absolute bioavailability of R406 is determined to 55% (90% CI: 42.48, 70.29) after a single oral dose of 150 
mg fostamatinib and a radiolabeled intravenous (IV) microtracer dose of 14C-R406 in healthy subjects (Study 
D4300-027). The wide confidence interval demonstrates that there is a large variability in BA. The variability 
ranged from 30 % to 85 %.  
Tmax was approximately 1.5 hours regardless of single or multiple dosing. There was a dose-related increase 
in R406 exposure when dose increased from 80 to 250 mg, but no increase in R406 exposure between 250 
and 400 mg in study C788-001. T½ of R406 is about 16 hours. 
Bioequivalence 
Nine biopharmaceutical studies have been conducted to describe bioavailability, bioequivalence and food 
effect. Bioequivalence between the different formulations were investigated in three BE studies: D4300-020, 
C788-052, and C788-054. 
Earlier formulations were bridged to the formulation used in the ITP development program (formulation OFC-
1; manufactured by AstraZeneca) which was further bridged to the proposed commercial tablet (formulation 
OFC; manufactured by Patheon) with bioequivalence established within the accepted 80 – 125 %CI margins. 
Large variability was observed for all formulations, especially for Cmax. 
Influence of food 
Several studies demonstrated that food (high fat high calorie contents) increases R406 exposure (AUC) by 10 
to 32%, while Cmax changes in ranged from -60% to 15%, depending on the tablet formulation tested. In the 
phase III trials, fostamatinib tablets were taken with or without food according to protocol.

Distribution 
R406 distributed to extravascular sites, and exhibited a volume of distribution at steady-state of 256 L, based 
on results from a radiotracer study (D4300-027). 
14C R406 had a mean binding to purified human serum albumin of 96.3%, as tested over the concentration 
range 100 to 4000 ng/mL and a mean binding to purified alpha 1 acid glycoprotein of 75.5% hence R406 is 
highly bound to plasma proteins.  
Study D4300-032 demonstrated that R406 distributed preferentially into red blood cells at a ratio of 
approximately 2.5 to blood vs plasma. R406 concentration-time profiles in whole blood and plasma were 
similar for therapeutic doses of 100 to 200 mg.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 56/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Animal data indicate that R406 distributes into breast milk. Distribution into semen was negligible. 
Elimination 
The geometric mean half-life of fostamatinib was assessed in single dose studies in healthy human subjects 
and ranged from 14.2 to 15.5 hours for 150 mg under fasted conditions. Half-life at steady state was 
investigated in study D4300-007. Half lives were similar for all cohorts (white, Japanese; 50, 100 or 200 
fostamatinib bid) and ranged from approximately 12 to 17 hours. Based on results from a radiotracer study 
(D4300-027), clearance was estimated to 15.7 L/h, indicating that R406 is not a high clearance drug. 
Excretion 
The ADME study C788-014 confirmed the in vitro observation that R406 preferentially distributes to blood 
over plasma. Total radioactivity was excreted via urine and faeces until 192 hours postdose. Overall mean 
recovery of total radioactivity was 99.3%. Mean recovery of total radioactivity in the faeces and the urine was 
80.0%, and 19.3%, respectively. This indicates that R406 is mainly excreted via the faecal route and that 
renal elimination is of minor importance.

Metabolism 
In the mass balance study C788-014 which used [14C]-R788, the metabolism of fostamatinib was 
characterized. The majority of radioactivity in plasma was associated with R406. R788 was observed only 
sporadically in plasma. Low levels of metabolites were observed in plasma. These metabolites were identified 
as an O-glucuronide of a desmethyl R406 metabolite, R406-N-glucuronide, and R949529-sulfate. The 
radioactivity excreted in urine through 72 hours post-dose consisted of several metabolites and low levels of 
R788. R406-N-glucuronide was the major metabolite in urine and this urinary metabolite accounted for 
13.9% of the administered dose. 
The majority of the radioactivity excreted in feces was associated with the 3,5-benzene diol of R406 and 
R406, accounting for 30.6% and 29.8% of the resolved fecal radioactivity, respectively. No unchanged R788 
was detected in feces. In summary, R406 was found to undergo both oxidation and direct glucuronidation 
with excretion in the faeces as the main elimination pathway.
Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
Study D4300-007 evaluated the relationship between variations in the gene encoding UDP 
glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) in Japanese and white male HV. UGT1A1 is 
Assessment report

involved in the metabolism of fostamatinib, and mutations in the UGT1A1 gene has been identified in the 
literature.  
The effect of fostamatinib on genetic polymorphisms of UGT1A1 has not been fully established. The sparse 
data indicate that certain UGT1A1 genotypes may get elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels after long term 
use of fostamatinib. A warning is stated in the SmPC regarding increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia in 
patients with genetic polymorphisms of UGT1A1 e.g. Gilbert. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Fostamatinib appears to be dose proportional within the therapeutic range and up to doses of 200 mg bid. 
Higher doses lead to a greater than proportional exposure. Steady state is reached after 3-4 days.

With a half-life about 16 hours and a dosing interval of 12 hours the expected AR would be around 2.3. In 
study D4300-007, the accumulation rate for the 200 mg BID dose was larger than expected, 6.55 probably 
due to a low Day 1 exposure. No time dependency was observed in the Pop PK analysis and no unexpected 
accumulation after long term use is expected.

Intra- and inter-subject variability 
Intra- and inter-subject variability observed in both healthy volunteer as well as target patient studies is 
high. The typical inter-subject variability in exposure was ~ 35% coefficient of variation (CV) for AUC and ~ 
50% – 60% CV for Cmax, and intra-subject variability in exposure is ~ 18%–27% CV for AUC and ~ 31%–
43% CV for Cmax in the PK studies in healthy volunteers. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
In the Phase 3 clinical studies C788-047 and C788-048, PK blood samples were collected at Weeks 2, 6, and 
24 visits. Table 11-10 shows PK data from CSR C788-047 with sampling at multiple time points. 
Assessment report

In clinical extension study (C788-049) pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated for R406 in ITP patients 
(Table 11-5). In this study, steady-state AUC and Cmax estimates were within the range of exposure obtained 
in earlier healthy volunteer studies. 
The population PK model included data from 10 Phase I studies in healthy volunteers, four phase II studies 
and three phase III studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and finally, data from the three phase III 
studies in patients with ITP. The vast majority of data derives from earlier development stages, therefore it is 
expected that the addition of 332 observations from ITP patients would have limited influence on the model 
established using the available 17712 data points from healthy subjects and RA patients. Model-predicted 
fostamatinib average DAUCss in ITP patients was 10232 ng*h/mL for the 100 mg bid and 15101 ng*h/mL for 
the 150 mg bid of fostamatinib (Table 4). 
While it appears from the Pop PK model that clearance was comparable between healthy volunteers and RA 
patients, volume of distribution is 3-fold higher in RA patients.

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
The dedicated study (D4300-009) in patients with renal impairment, including end stage renal disease 
demonstrated that AUC and Cmax were lower in both groups with renal impairment compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. However, R406 is highly bound to plasma proteins, and AUC for the unbound fraction 
was similar across groups. Half-life and Tmax were also similar and there was no relevant relationship between 
R406 PK and creatinine clearance identified. The amount of R406 N-glucuronide recovered in urine decreased 
with decreasing renal function at 14.7 mg, 7.56 mg, and 0.518 mg for normal, moderate, and ESRD groups, 
respectively, but urinary excretion was minimal across groups in line with what was also demonstrated in the 
mass-balance study. Less than 1% of the dose of R406 cleared by dialysis. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Subjects enrolled in the dedicated hepatic impairment study (D4300-010) were 8 with mild hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), 8 with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), 8 with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), and 8 with normal hepatic function. 
Hepatic impairment have no consistent effect on PK of R406. As fostamatinib can cause elevation of liver 
enzymes and hepatotoxicity, fostamatinib should not be used in ITP patients with severe hepatic impairment 
and liver function should be monitored in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment as stated in the 
SmPC.

Gender 
Gender is not a significant covariate by itself, and the same dose is proposed for both men and women. 
Race 
Specific studies were conducted to assess the PK of R406 in Japanese male subjects compared with white 
male subjects. There was no consistent PK differences of R406 following fostamatinib dosing in Japanese and 
Western subjects. In the population PK analysis, race did not emerge as a significant factor for variability in 
exposure. The vast majority of subject in the Pop PK analysis were white, and only 70 subjects with Asian 
origin were included. 
Weight 
The thorough QT Study C788-013, included comparable numbers of males and females and included an 
analysis of gender effects. The data show slightly higher AUCss in females; however, when adjusted for body 
weight the exposure values are similar indicating that the exposure difference is primarily due to lower body 
weight in females. 
The Pop PK analysis found body weight to be an important covariate and confirmed that R406 exposure 
decreases with increase in body weight. AUCss was almost halved in patients >90 kg compared to patients 
<50 kg. However, body weight was not significant in the exposure-response population model. It is 
concluded that body weight – though having an effect on exposure - seems to have little effect on the safety 
and efficacy of fostamatinib if a fixed dose paradigm is used.

Elderly 
Elderly patients aged 65 or older accounted for 14% of the data set in the PK evaluation of fostamatinib; 5 
subjects were aged 85 or older. From a PK point of view it is acceptable to use the same dose 
recommendations in all age groups. 
Children 
Fostamatinib is not intended for the pediatric population. No PK data in children has been included in the 
submission. Due to adverse effects on bone metabolism, the PDCO granted a waiver for the complete 
paediatric population below 18 years of age. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The potential for DDI of fostamatinib and R406 was extensively examined in vitro. The potential interaction of 
R406 for CYP3A4 inhibition and induction, CYP2C8 induction, inhibition of BCRP and inhibition of P-gp was 
further investigated in clinical DDI studies. R406 was shown to be a potent inhibitor of human UGT1A1 in 
vitro. Data from clinical studies C788-047 and -048 indicated plasma bilirubin levels did increase by 22-64%, 
when ITP patients received fostamatinib. Even though R406 does not show inhibitory activity against 
UGT2B7, the effect on other UGTs such as UGT1A6 and UGT1A9 remains unclear. The potential of PK DDIs 
for co-administration with acetaminophen remains undetermined and a warning is included in the SmPC.  
A total of 14 clinical interaction studies were performed. Table 8 gives a results summary of in vivo studies 
where fostamatinib was the victim of DDI evaluated by R406 exposure and table 9 gives a summary of in 
vivo studies where fostamatinib acts as perpetrator of DDI evaluated by exposure of the concomitant drug.

No clinical effects considered relevant for change of posology were demonstrated when fostamatinib was 
given concomitantly with either verapamil, ranitidine, methotrexate, midazolam, microgynon (contraceptive), 
warfarin or pioglitazone.  
With ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, R406 plasma exposure increased 2-fold (average increases in 
Cmax and AUC of 37% and 102%, respectively) when subjects received a single 80 mg dose of fostamatinib 
on top of ketoconazole given 200 mg twice daily for 3.5 days. A warning that concomitant administration of 
fostamatinib and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may warrant reduction in dose frequency (BID to QD) is stated in 
the SmPC.

A single dose of 150 mg fostamatinib was administered alone and in combination with the strong CYP3A4 
inducer, rifampicin 600 mg given qd for 8 days. R406 exposure (as AUC) was reduced by 75% in combination 
with rifampicin. Concomitant use of fostamatinib with strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended. 
Fostamatinib was an inhibitor of the human P-gp efflux transporter in Caco-2 cells. Digoxin, a P-gp substrate, 
dosed 0.25 mg qd for 15 days was given alone or co-administered with fostamatinib 100 mg bid for 7 days. 
Co-administration with fostamatinib increased digoxin exposure by 34% (Ae0-24) in urine and by 37% (AUC) 
and 70% (Cmax) in plasma.  
The potential of multiple doses of 100 mg bid fostamatinib for interaction with two statins rosuvastatin (a 
BCRP substrate) and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) was investigated in two separate groups each 
consistent of 21 healthy subjects.  A single dose of 20 mg rosuvastatin or 40 mg simvastatin was dosed with 
or without fostamatinib. Steady-state PK of R406 was also assessed. In the rosuvastatin group multiple 
dosing with fostamatinib resulted in increased AUC and Cmax of rosuvastatin with 96% and 88%, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019

In the simvastatin group, multiple dosing with fostamatinib increased simvastatin exposure both in its lactone 
and acid forms. AUC increased by 64% and Cmax by 113% for simvastatin while AUC increased by 74% and 
Cmax 83% for simastatin acid.

R406 exposures were slightly higher when fostamatinib was combined with rosuvastatin or simvastatin.  
Drug reduction of CYP3A4 substrates may be warranted when given concomitantly with fostamatinib. For 
rosuvastatin, shift to another treatment should be considered and for digoxin additional therapeutic drug 
monitoring could be necessary. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Fostamatinib is a pro-drug of the biologically active metabolite R406. R406 inhibits signaling from receptors 
systems mediated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) that are dependent on SYK. 
Its inhibition of the FcR, BCR, and C-type lectin receptors (CLR) signaling pathways makes it a potentially 
broadly applicable anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agent. In ITP, R406 appears to ameliorate 
platelet destruction by interrupting the FcR signaling mediated by SYK und preventing undesired cell 
clearance and is expected to lead to an increase in platelet counts.  Several ITP mouse model studies showed 
that pretreatment with fostamatoinib significantly protected mice from antibody-induced thrombocytopenia. 
Increase in platelet counts is the primary pharmacodynamic target of interest in the targeted population of 
ITP patients. In the phase 3 confirmatory studies conducted in ITP patients, the primary endpoint was 
achievement of a stable platelet response by Week 24 defined as a platelet count of at least 50,000/μL on at 
least 4 of the 6 visits between Weeks 14-24.

Dose selection 
The 100 mg dose twice daily was supported by data generated from study C788-001 conducted in healthy 
subjects, for which a biomarker assay measuring the activation of peripheral blood basophils following ex 
vivo anti-IgE stimulation was developed. Basophils degranulate upon activation (a Syk-dependent process), 
an event that coincides with increased surface expression of CD63. Measuring the percentage of CD63+ 
basophils in blood samples obtained after R406 dosing, normalized to predose samples, may provide an 
indicator for the inhibitory effect of R406 on the Syk signaling pathway. The clinical relevance of the PD 
marker in relation to ITP has not been established. PK profiles of R406 were obtained in healthy human 
subjects, following single oral doses at 80-600 mg and multiple doses at 100-300 mg, bid. A sigmoidal Emax 
equation was used to model the plasma R406 concentrations and the PD effects of R406. The R406 plasma 
concentration that produced a 50% reduction of the PD effect was 496 ± 42.2 ng/mL (~ 1.06 μM). This 
would translate to a daily AUC requirement of approximately 12,000 ng×h/mL (~ 496 ng/mL×24h) and 
would correspond to the average R406 exposure at the 100 mg dose in healthy volunteers (ranged between 
4,400 to 7,020 ng×h/mL per dose interval, i.e. corresponding to daily exposure of 8,800 and 14,000 
ng×h/Ml). While the model is to be considered exploratory only, as it is not clear whether the employed 
biomarker of CD63 expression is an accurate surrogate of the effect of R406 on platelet counts, it 
nevertheless supports the use of the bid 100 mg dose regimen. Use of the bid 100 mg dose was furthermore 
justified by results gained in RA patients:  
a) the bid 50 mg dose did not result in significant improvement in the ACR score and  
b) did not result in significantly decreases from baseline of two biomarkers (MMP-3 and IL-6) of inflammation 
measured after 12 weeks of treatment (study C788-006).  
A higher dose of 250 mg bid for 21 days investigated in healthy subjects (Study C788-003), was considered 
to be above the maximum tolerated dose. More specifically, the study duration was reduced to 20 days due 
to the negative safety profile and, overall, 50% of the subjects in the fostamatinib treatment group 
discontinued due to adverse events (elevated transaminases, leukopenia, nausea/vomiting/dizziness and 
rash).  
From the escalating phase 2 study conducted in ITP patients where doses between 75 and 175 mg were 
investigated (Study D4300-022), no robust conclusions can be drawn regarding efficacy/safety response. 
Further analyses of dose exposure response in terms of efficacy and safety employing a PK/PD model 
approach did not provide any further insight compared to the separate study results.  
Summarizing, the 100 mg dose administered twice daily seems to have been selected based on the 
assumption of the best benefit risk balance, thereby allowing a dose increase to 150 mg bid or a decrease to 
100 mg sid, depending on the observed platelet response and the occurrence of side effects. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Effect on the immune system 
A reduction of CD63+ basophils was observed in healthy subjects and was attributed to SYK-inhibition. A 
clear trend for a reduction in monocytes bearing CD14 was also shown, but the mechanism behind this 
phenomenon could not be fully elucidated. It is however postulated to be an effect of R406 on survival, 
shedding or internalization of the marker or compartmentalization and not to be a result of an effect on 
production of these cells. It is also suggested that SYK kinase inhibition in resting monocytes does not 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 70/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
interfere with Fc receptor (CD64) expression. Overall, it is considered that the reduction of monocytes, 
although at times shown to be substantial (up to 65% in study C406-001), „unlikely to affect the immune 
system due to functional redundancy and the immune system’s resilience to all but most drastic changes in 
cell numbers“. A further effect of R406 was suggested on T cell responses based on the modest effect on the 
level of expression of CD86 (mfi) on the CD14+ cells in study C406-001. The clinical relevance thereof 
remains however unclear. What seems to be the most relevant effect on the immune system is the clear 
trend for a decrease in neutrophils (with a corresponding increase in lymphocytes) that was observed across 
the healthy volunteers’ studies, especially in the higher dose cohorts (studies C406-001 and C788-003), and 
which was confirmed in the clinical studies conducted in ITP patients. The potential mechanism behind 
neutropenia may be related in part to the off-target effect inhibitory effect on some kinases to be involved in 
haemotopoiesis such as VEGF, but is not entirely clear. In RA patients, a significant decrease from baseline 
for two biomarkers, namely mean MMP-3 and IL-6 concentrations, was furthermore demonstrated for the 100 
and 150 mg bid treatment groups after 12 weeks of treatment, further underpinning the broad action on the 
immune system.  
Overall, the clinical relevance of these broad effects on the immune system seems uncertain. Higher 
incidences in infections in the fostamatinib group compared to placebo have been observed in ITP and RA 
patients and a potential causal relationship of fostamatinib treatment with the occurrence of infections cannot 
be entirely ruled out at the current stage. Results from non-clinical studies do however not point to a 
significant effect of fostamatinib on the immune system. Based on the animal models provided, Fostamatinib 
does not appear to have immunosuppressive effects. No increase in tumor incidence was noted in the 
carcinogenicity studies and there was no evidence for increases in opportunistic infections in any of the 
species in the toxicology program (rodents, rabbits, and monkeys).  
In conclusion, while it is agreed that short term administration might not impact on the immune system to a 
clinically relevant extent in ITP patients, as shown by the reversibility of effects after termination of therapy, 
effects of long-term administration do not seem to be as well characterised, with remaining open questions 
on the mechanism behind the reduction of monocytes and neutrophils and on a potential causal relationship 
with the occurrence of infections.  
Effect on platelet function 
R406 selectively inhibited SYK-dependent platelet aggregation induced by collagen-related peptide and 
collagen. In a Phase 1 study of fostamatinib in healthy human subjects (study C406-001) that achieved 
supratherapeutic concentrations of R406, there was no effect on collagen- or adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-
induced platelet aggregation at any time-point measured (single dose part A: Day 1 pre-dose, 2 and 4 hours 
post-dose; multiple dose part B: Day 1 pre-dose and 4hours post-dose and Day 7 pre-dose and 4 hours post-
dose). Reference is however made to the non-clinical results, where the combination of ASA and R406 
strongly increased the RTBF at all doses tested and similar data was also observed with time to occlusion 
(TTO). 
Effect on QT prolongation 
In a dedicated QT/QTc study (C-935788-013), which was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 
comparative, placebo and active controlled parallel study, the effect of 100 and 300 mg twice daily 
administration of Fostamatinib for 4 days on the duration of QT intervals was evaluated. Assay sensitivity was 
adequately established. The response of QTcF at the two doses was comparable, except for the late 
observation period, where the 300 mg group had slightly higher mean values. For all observations, for both 
doses, the upper bounds of the 95% one-sided confidence intervals were however below 10 msec. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 71/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
The maximum placebo-subtracted change in QTcF increase at any observation for either R788 dose group 
was 5.83 msec and the largest upper confidence bound was 8.72 msec, both in the 300 mg group at 23.5 
hours post dose. Considering that the largest QTcF increase from baseline was observed at 23.5 hours, a late 
effect of a slowly increasing metabolite could have been assumed and was discussed by the Applicant. As this 
was the only observation of higher values in the whole sampling period of Day 4, a late effect of a potential 
metabolite’s concentration that would be slowly increasing seems however unlikely.  
A mild HR reduction was noted (statistically significant after placebo subtraction). For the 100 mg group, the 
maximum placebo-subtracted HR change was -3.99 bpm and for the 300 mg group -6.64 bpm, both at 3.5 
hours. This was consistent with pre-clinical data, where a slight reduction in heart rate and increase in RR 
interval was noted at 50 mg/kg in the cardiovascular study. Overall, this is not considered to be of significant 
clinical impact. 
There was no evident exposure-response relationship between placebo-subtracted changes in QTcF and 
serum concentration of R406.  Females showed higher concentration levels compared to male. This was 
however attributed to the lower body weight and a higher weight-normalized dose received by females. 
Results of further analyses provided no indication that R788 has a clinically meaningful effect on QTcF among 
females compared to males. 
Based on the results from this study, it is concluded that a twice daily administration of fostamatinib up to 
300 mg (supratherapeutic dose) is not expected to prolong the QT interval at therapeutic doses to a clinically 
significant degree. Of note, also the clinical phase 3 studies did not show any cardiovascular safety signals. 
Tyrosin kinase inhibitors class effects 
R406 was profiled in broad kinase panels utilizing different biochemical assays indicating a range of potential 
activities, some of which were confirmed or qualified by relevant cell-based assays. Using cell-based assays, 
R406 inhibits the kinase activity of RET proto-oncogene (RET), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 
(VEGFR-2), FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), Janus kinase (JAK)1/3, and KIT proto-oncogene receptor 
tyrosine kinase (KIT) within 5-fold of R406 activity against the SYK assay. Bearing these results in mind, it is 
noteworthy that a class effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on bone metabolism has been suggested (Effects 
of tyrosine kinase inhibition on bone metabolism: untargeted consequences of targeted therapies; Endocrine-
Related Cancer 21, 3; R247–R259). By targeting a broad range of TKIs (all of which are involved to some 
extent in the bone metabolism with either potentially deleterious or favourable effects), it is difficult to 
accurately estimate the risk that is related to bone metabolism, especially for long term administration in 
patients at risk (e.g. elderly, patients with concomitant steroid treatment, patients with 
osteoporosis/osteopenia, patients with fractures or young adults where epiphyseal fusion may not have 
entirely occurred); this has been capture in the imposed PASS included in the annex II. 
Chondrodystrophy/growth plate dysplasia and ovarian changes (VEGFR inhibition) 
Chondrodystrophy/growth plate dysplasia was observed in juvenile animals (1-month study in juvenile 
rabbits showed growth plate dysplasia in the proximal femur and femoro-tibial joint; chondrodystrophy of the 
femoral head in rats in toxicity studies), which seems attributable to be likely related to the off-target 
inhibition of VEGFR. 
A further observed non-clinical finding was the increased occurrence of degenerate/necrotic ovarian follicles 
in juvenile rabbits. This was also argued to be consistent with an off-target anti-angiogenic effect (VEGFR 
inhibition).  In the developmental toxicity study in adult rabbits (G-935788-0006), the mean number of 
corpora lutea and implantations compared favourably with the control across all groups. There was no 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 72/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
evidence, for degenerate/necrotic ovarian follicules at necropsy in this rabbit-study. Furthermore, these 
ovarian follicular changes were not reported in any other study in rodents or in primates included in the 
chronic and carcinogenicity studies up to 2 years in duration. 
It is therefore concluded that, from a clinical perspective, an absolute risk on fertility for women (and girls) 
with childbearing potential who may desire to have children in the future seems to be rather unlikely. 
These findings of chondrodystrophy/growth plate dysplasia should not be an issue in adults, as these would 
be limited to actively growing bones (before growth plate closure). Therefore subjects < 18 years of age are 
excluded for treatment of fostamatinib. Epiphyseal fusion of the femoral head and the pelvic bone may also 
occur as late as 18 years of age or even later and should be considered in this regard. Since fostamatinib was 
shown in vitro to target also other tyrosine kinases that are involved in the bone metabolism (e.g., VEGFR, 
RET), any potential untargeted effects on bone remodelling or formation remain undetermined, especially in 
patients with osteoporosis, patients with fractures or young adults where epiphyseal fusion has not yet 
occurred. Closer monitoring in these patients is therefore recommended. The benefit risk of continuing 
therapy during the healing of a bone fracture should be thoroughly evaluated by the physician.  
Hypertension (VEGFR inhibition) 
R406 was shown to potently inhibit the auto-phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 kinase. VEGF plays a role in blood 
pressure regulation by causing vasorelaxation via nitric oxide (NO) release from the endothelium, and 
inhibition of VEGFR-2 has been shown to elevate BP both in nonclinical species and in humans. At this time, it 
is however not known if VEGFR inhibition is the sole mechanism behind BP elevation, given that R406 also 
inhibits other kinases that are potentially involved in BP regulation. 
Changes in blood pressure have been evaluated in an ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring study in 
135 RA patients following 100 mg bid dosing of fostamatinib for 28 days (study D4300-033). Increases in 
systolic and diastolic BP were observed after 28 days with a mean treatment-related increase of 2.93 (95% 
CI of 0.40 to 5.45) and 3.53 mm Hg (95% CI of 2.04 to 5.03) over placebo changes, respectively. In the 
fostamatinib group, mean changes from baseline were evident by Day 8, and subsequently plateaued up to 
Day 29. No patients had clinic BP ≥180/110 mmHg. The BP effect appeared to be reversible within 1 week 
following discontinuation of dosing.  
Consistent with the results from this study, comparable increases in blood pressure were observed in healthy 
volunteers and in patients with ITP, the latter population showing in several cases a category two or three 
shift in blood pressure. Available data suggest that subjects already suffering from pre-existing hypertension 
or receiving oral steroids be more likely susceptible for an increase in blood pressure. Adequate justification 
has been provided that the effect on changes in blood pressure of R406 appears to be dose-dependent, and 
therefore, a dose reduction is appropriate if blood pressure increases during treatment. 
RET inhibition 
R406 was shown a potent inhibitor of RET kinase in vitro and in cells, and inhibition of this protein has been 
linked to urogenital and major vessel defects in developmental toxicity studies in both rabbits and rodents. 
Based on the reproductive and/or developmental effects seen in rats and rabbits, conclusion indicate that 
administration of fostamatinib early in human pregnancy or during lactation may pose a risk to the 
fetus/child, which is also included in the SmpC/PL.  
Other tyrosinkinase inhibitors class effects such as gastrointestinal effects (nausea, diarrhea) and 
transaminase elevations (ALT and AST) were also observed for Fostamatinib. Interpretation of the 
significance of transaminase elevations may be hampered due to the drug’s off-target pharmacological 
Assessment report

activity on bilirubin conjugation. R406 is a potent UDP glucuronosyltransferaseform 1A1 (UGT1A1) inhibitor 
(see below), therefore, administration of fostamatinib may result in increases of unconjugated bilirubin levels. 
An isolated increase in blood bilirubin (without an increase in another liver function test) may represent the 
enzyme inhibition activity of the drug, and thus should allow continued dosing with close monitoring. 
Concomitant medication with drugs that are metabolized by UGT1A9/A1 (such as paracetamol, propofol or 
levothyroxine) may result in clinically relevant drug interactions and warrant specific safety monitoring as 
reported in the SmPC. Potent Activity against non-kinase targets (adenosine A3 receptor, UDP 
glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1, phosphodiesterase PDE5, adenosine transporter) was shown on a non-
clinical level. The physiological significance of pharmacological modulation of human adenosine A3 receptors 
was not elucidated and remains unclear.  
Potentially important covariates 
Gender analysis: In the thorough QT study, it has been evaluated whether there was a difference in the 
effect of fostamatinib on the QTc intervals in female compared to male subjects. The results of these 
analyses did not indicate that fostamatinib has a clinically meaningful effect on QTcF among females 
compared to males. In an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring study in 135 RA subjects following 100 mg 
bid dosing of fostamatinib for 28 days, most patients were female and no robust conclusions can be drawn 
regarding potential gender differences. With a view on the safety profile, AEs seem to occur more frequently 
in female subjects, which is probably related to a lower body weight.   
Pharmacodynamic (PD) interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
A dedicated DDI study investigating the effect of multiple dose administration of fostamatinib 100 mg twice 
daily on warfarin exposure (single dose 25 mg) and PD (evaluated in terms of INR) was conducted (study 
D4300C00013). The primary statistical comparison of INR parameters following administration of a single 
dose of warfarin 25 mg concomitantly with multiple dose fostamatinib dosed to steady-state show a 
geometric LS mean Ratio of 89.7% (90%CI: 84.6-95.2). Co-administration with fostamatinib thus resulted in 
a decrease of INR, which seems counterintuitive considering the increase in exposure of warfarin, therefore 
monitoring of anticoagulant activity is warranted when anticoagulants with narrow therapeutic index such as 
warfarin are co-administered with fostamatinib. 
R406 have substantial off-target activity, and close monitoring of AEs emerging in a real life setting if 
fostamatinib is administered to patients with comorbidities and concomitant medication for other conditions 
will be required. Co-administration with fostasmatinib and immunomodulating agents have not been 
thoroughly investigated. Co-administration with corticosteroids is safe. Concomitant use with NSAIDSs in RA 
did not identify any safety concerns. Use of NSAIDs is not recommended in ITP.   
Genetic differences in pharmacodynamic response 
In study D4300C00007, the relationship between variations in the gene encoding UDP 
glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) was investigated. The results from this study 
indicate that regulation of bilirubin levels is partly dependent on genotype at UGT1A1 and that the slight 
increases in total bilirubin can be in part explained by UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 genotype, in both placebo 
and fostamatinib treated subjects. UGT1A1*6 or UGT1A1*28 genotype did however not appear to be a factor 
in the incidence of AEs for Japanese or White subjects.

Relationship between exposure and effect 
The PD marker, percentage change in CD63+ basophils, was related to the plasma concentration of R406. A 
sigmoidal Emax equation was used to model the plasma R406 concentrations and the PD effects of R406.  The 
R406 plasma concentration that produced a 50% reduction of the PD effect was 496 ± 42.2 ng/mL (~ 1.06 
μM). This would translate to a daily AUC requirement of approximately 12,000 ng×h/mL (~ 496 ng/mL×24h) 
(figure 1). 
Figure 2: 
Correlation Between Plasma R940406 Concentrations and Percent Change of CD63+ 
Basophils in Normal Human Volunteers After Single and Multiple Oral Doses of R940406 
Effect 
A population PK/PD analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between fostamatinib exposure, as 
measured by its metabolite R406, and efficacy. The exposure-efficacy analysis was based on data from 2 
Phase 3 studies in ITP patients. The population PK/PD analysis did not demonstrate an exposure-efficacy 
relationship. Higher exposure on average was evident in responders compared to non-responders only for 
Week 12, not between Weeks 14 – 24 or Week 24. The variability in response to fostamatinib in the ITP 
patients is not attributed to PK variability. 
Safety 
The population PK/PD analysis were also used to explore the relationship between fostamatinib exposure, as 
measured by its metabolite R406, and safety. The exposure-safety analysis was based on data from 5 Phase 
2 and 3 studies in patients with RA and 2 Phase 3 studies in patients with ITP.  R406 exposure had little to no 
effect on increases in ALT, AST, and bilirubin.  R406 increased blood pressure with a maximal effect of about 
10 mmHg.  The DAUC required to achieve half of Emax (EC50) is comparable to the average DAUC achieved at 
a 300 mg daily dose.  Neutrophil counts tended to decrease with higher exposure of R406.  However, the 
maximum effect was relatively small and likely of no clinical consequence.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
A two-compartment Pop PK model with simultaneous first- and zero-order delayed absorption and first order 
elimination best described the PK of fostamatinib in RA and ITP patients with bodyweight and population 
identified as significant covariates. Predicted daily area under the curve at steady state was the exposure 
metric carried forward for E-R analyses of safety variables BP, ALT, BILI and ANC with blood platelet count as 
the efficacy variable. Of the 2535 subjects included in the PK/PD data set, were 1675 subjects on active 
treatment, of these were 102 subjects (6%) ITP patients with 3 blood samples taken per study at weeks 2, 6, 
and 24. Only PD data from ITP patients were included in the blood pressure analysis.  
Fostamatinib is rapidly converted into the highly permeable R406 metabolite in the gut through the action of 
gut alkaline phosphatase. R406 is a substrate of P-gp in vitro. The mean absolute bioavailability of R406 is 
55% with high variability (30% to 85%). Tmax is approximately 1.5 hours regardless of single or multiple 
dosing. Several tablet formulations were used throughout development with bioequivalence established. 
Large variability was observed for all formulations. The effects of food on exposure of R406 was modest and 
not considered clinically relevant. R406 distributed to extravascular sites with volume of distribution of 256 L. 
The half-life of R406 is 16 hours and the clearance 15.7 L/h. R406 is highly bound to plasma proteins and 
distributes into red blood cells with a ratio of 2.6. 
A mass balance study showed predominately R406 is circulating in plasma with the majority excreted in feces 
and 20% excreted in urine as R-406 glucuronide. R406 is mainly cleared via CYP3A4 metabolism. R406 
exposure is close to dose proportional in the therapeutic dosing range 100 to 150 mg bid fostamatinib. The 
expected AR is 2.3. PK samples were collected in ITP patients in both Phase 3 studies, 047 + 048. The intra- 
and inter-subject variability is considerable. Pop PK analyses indicated that PK is comparable in healthy 
volunteers and ITP patients.  
The dose of fostamatinib should not be adjusted in subjects with renal impairment. Use of fostamitinib in ITP 
patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. PK is similar in men and women when adjusted 
for body weight. R406 exposure decreases with increase in body weight. Body weight was not significant in 
any of the variables in the exposure-response population model. A study in Japanese and white male healthy 
subjects did not identify any PK differences between the groups. Fostamatinib metabolism is not expected to 
be affected by genetic polymorphisms of UGT1A1. However, there could be increased risk of 
hyperbilirubinemia in patients with genetic polymorphisms of UGT1A1 e.g. Gilbert. No dose adjustments have 
been proposed in elderly patients. Fostamatinib is not intended for use in children due to safety concerns. 
Drug Interactions 
In vitro, R406 was an inhibitor of UGT1A1 (IC50 143 nM), could cause time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 
(KI = 1 to 2.3 μM, kinact 0.022 to 0.024 min-1) and induce CYP2C8. Fostamatinib was an inhibitor of P-gp 
(IC50 3.2 µM) and R406 was a substrate of P-gp up to 10 µM. Both fostamatinib and R406 were inhibitors of 
BCRP in vitro (0.050 and 0.031 μM, respectively).  
The DDI potential of R406 for CYP3A4 inhibition and induction, CYP2C8 induction, inhibition of BCRP and 
inhibition of P-gp was investigated in clinical DDI studies.  
Concomitant administration of fostamatinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may warrant dose reductions. 
Concomitant use of fostamatinib with strong CYP3A4 inducers e.g. rifampicin is not recommended. Ranitidine 
did not have a clinically relevant impact on fostamatinib exposure. Repeat dose administration of

fostamatinib did not seem to affect exposure of methotrexate in RA subjects but the results are difficult to 
interpret. Concomitant use of fostamatinib may increase systemic exposure of some CYP3A4 substrate drugs 
and toxicities of CYP3A4 substrate drugs that may require dosage reduction should be monitored. 
Anticoagulant activity (e.g. INR) monitoring is recommended with concomitant use of fostamatinib and 
anticoagulants with narrow therapeutic index. Fostamatinib had a minor effect on CYP2C8 mediated 
metabolism of pioglitazone. Concomitant use of fostamatinib may increase concentrations of P-gp substrates 
(e.g., digoxin) and BCRP substrates (e.g., rosuvastatin). Toxicities of these drugs that may require dose 
reduction should be monitored. A study investigating ethinyl estradiol (a substrate of UGT1A1) did indicate 
possible UGT1A1 inhibition. PK/PD analysis of safety variables indicated that increase of R406 exposure had 
little effect on unconjugated bilirubin levels, a marker for UGT1A1 inhibition in vivo. The potential of PK DDIs 
for co-administration of fostamatinib with acetaminophen remain undetermined.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Fostamatinib is a pro-drug converted to the pharmacological active R406 in the gut. R406 inhibits SYK, a 
kinase involved in the intracellular signalling of multiple cell types involved in inflammation and tissue 
degradation. The pathogenesis of ITP is incompletely understood, but primary ITP is considered due to 
autoimmune mechanisms leading to platelet destruction and platelet underproduction. A murine model of ITP 
showed that fostamatinib had modifying effect of antibody-induced thrombocytopenia. Several clinical studies 
in healthy subjects and ITP patients showed a consistent reduction in monocytes and neutrophils with a 
corresponding increase in lymphocytes. Careful hematology monitoring is therefore warranted when 
administering fostamatinib in patients. While it is agreed that short term administration might not impact the 
immune system to a clinically relevant extent in ITP patients, effects of long-term administration do not seem 
to be as well characterised, with remaining open questions on the mechanism behind the reduction of 
monocytes and neutrophils and on a potential causal relationship with the occurrence of infections. A 50 % 
reduction of basophil activation was seen in the plasma concentrations achieved at therapeutic doses, i.e. 
100 mg and 150 mg fostamatinib bid. R406 did not have effect on platelet function.  
Fostamatinib was active against a broad range of other tyrosine kinases, especially, of RET proto-oncogene 
(RET), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), Janus 
kinase (JAK)1/3 and KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT). By targeting a broad range of TKIs 
(all of which are involved to some extent in the bone metabolism with either potentially deleterious or 
favourable effects), it is difficult to accurately estimate the risk that is related to bone metabolism, especially 
for long term administration in patients at risk of osteoporosis (e.g. elderly, patients with concomitant steroid 
treatment, patients with fractures or young adults where epiphyseal fusion may not have entirely occurred). 
Genetic differences in PD response are possible but the small numbers and high heterogeneity make the 
issue difficult to investigate.  
Dose exposure response was addressed by a population PK/PD approach, which is however not considered to 
add high value to the separate study assessments. The use of the bid 100 mg dose of fostamatinib in the 
confirmatory phase 3 studies in ITP patients was in part justified based on a PD analysis. A lower dose of 50 
mg bid was postulated to show lack of efficacy, as demonstrated in RA patients. Study C406-001 
investigating 3 weeks of administration of a 250 mg bid in healthy subjects resulted in a high discontinuation 
rate due to adverse events. Overall, a positive relationship between exposure and efficacy has not been 
demonstrated. 
Exposure-safety analysis was based on all available data from 5 Phase 2 and 3 studies in patients with RA 
and 2 Phase 3 studies in patients with ITP. Within the therapeutic exposure ranges achieved in the clinical 
studies, exposure had minimal effect on safety endpoints, besides blood pressure. R406 exposure in the

therapeutic range increase blood pressure with a maximal predicted effect of about 10 mm Hg. There appear 
to be a linear PK/PD relationship for this outcome. 
Results from a QT study conducted ten years ago, but adherent to current guidelines, demonstrated that 
R406 does not prolong the QTc interval. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of fostamatinib (R788) and/ or its active metabolite R406 were evaluated extensively 
in clinical pharmacology and biopharmaceutic studies. PK in the target patient population is limited but 
appears comparable to PK characteristics observed in healthy volunteers and patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis.   
The pharmacodynamics of Fostamatinib shows a broad range of activities against other tyrosine kinases and 
non-tyrosin kinase targets as well as a broad anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory action (with partly 
uncertain clinical relevance).  
The investigation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fostamatinib is considered adequate. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study D43000C00022: A Phase II, Open-Label, Efficacy and Safety, Ascending Dose, Pilot Study of R935788 
for the Treatment of Adult Refractory Immune Thrombocytopenic  
Objectives: The primary objective of this pilot study was to assess the preliminary efficacy of R788 in the 
treatment of chronic refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) as measured by platelet response. 
The secondary objective of this pilot study was to assess the safety of R788 in the treatment of chronic 
refractory ITP using standard safety tests. 
Study Design and Methodology: This study was designed to include patients with chronic refractory ITP who 
were eligible for a 6- to 12 week dose exploration therapeutic trial, and were eligible to continue on study if 
an investigator defined response was observed. 
In order to be eligible for study participation, patients had to have ITP defined as a platelet count 
<30,000/mm3 consistently for 3 months. In some cases, the baseline platelet count could have been 
>30,000/mm3 but the platelet count history 3 months prior to study entry met the ITP inclusion criterion.  
During the course of the study all patients were to visit the study site on as few as 9 occasions and as many 
as 39 occasions over a period of approximately 2 months to 25.5 months (with dosing from 6 weeks up to 2 
years). After 24 months, patients who continued to demonstrate a sustained response, in the investigator’s 
judgment, were to be offered the opportunity to receive continued ongoing therapy, provided that there were 
no contraindications.  
The investigator considered a patient to have had a response based on the protocol defined criteria of a 
baseline platelet count increase by at least 20,000/mm3 to a total count of 30,000/mm3 or more while being 
treated with R788 and the patient had not received a dose of intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIg), or other 
concomitant therapy known to increase platelet counts, within 2 weeks of the increase in platelet count. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 78/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Secondary endpoints included the percentage of patients who achieved a platelet count of 50,000/mm3 or 
greater and the percentage of patients who achieved a platelet count of 150,000/mm3 or greater.  
Up to 18 patients (in dose cohorts of 3 to 6 patients) were to be treated with R788 in this study, at doses 
from 75 mg orally (PO) twice daily (bid) up to a maximum of 225 mg PO bid. At least 3 patients must have 
been enrolled at a given dose cohort, and have completed 4 weeks of treatment, and the Independent Safety 
Reviewer must have provided consent, before any patient could be enrolled into the next higher dose cohort. 
If 2 or more patients demonstrated a sustained response at a given dose, an additional 3 patients may have 
been enrolled at that dose. If 4 or more patients demonstrated a sustained response at a given dose, an 
additional 6 patients could be enrolled to confirm the response and the tolerability. 
For any given patient, the dose may have been increased by 25 mg PO bid after 2 weeks of treatment at a 
specific dose, provided that the previous dose had been without significant adverse effects (alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT] > 3 x upper limit of normal [ULN], polymorphonuclear neutrophils [PMN] 
<1000/mm3, and/or other significant National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria [NCI-CTC] AE 
Grade 2 toxicity). The dose may have been increased further in increments of 25 mg PO bid no more 
frequently than every 2 weeks; however, increases beyond Week 4 required the consent of the Independent 
Safety Reviewer. 
Patients who did not experience a response to any dose by Week 6 were to be withdrawn from treatment. 
Patients who demonstrated a sustained response by Week 12 were eligible to continue therapy for up to an 
additional 9 to 21 months at the dose at which the patient sustained the response, provided that there were 
no contraindications. 
Statistical Methods: All data collected in this study were to be documented with the help of patient data 
listings, summary tables, and graphical displays. Descriptive statistics were to be provided by observation 
time (visit) of interest and treatment group. The statistics for continuous variables were to include the 
sample size, mean, standard deviation, median (where applicable), and range. The mean and median 
statistics were to be presented with 1 decimal beyond the accuracy of collection. The standard deviation was 
to be presented with 2 decimals beyond the accuracy of collection. The range was to be presented using the 
same accuracy of collection. 
Results: 
A total of 18 patients were enrolled; 4 (22.2%) discontinued the study due to ‘other’ (2 patients failed to 
respond, 1 patient was withdrawn at Week 20 due to failure to respond, and 1 patient withdrew from the 
study on his own), 3 (16.7%) due to AEs (however, 2 additional patients are reported in AE tables as having 
withdrawn due to an AE including 1 patient that died and 1 patient that withdrew consent, below), 2 (11.1%) 
discontinued at the investigators discretion, 1 patient died, 1 patient discontinued due to being a non-
responder at Week 12, and 1 patient withdrew consent. 
The mean age of patients was 61.9 years (range: 30 to 81 years), the majority of patients were female 
(55.6%), and 77.8% of patients were Caucasian. All patients reported using an acceptable method of 
contraception. All subjects tested negative for HIV, HBV, and HCV. A total of 5 (27.8%) patients had an ITP 
bleeding history that was severe or life-threatening, 7 (38.9%) patients had been previously hospitalized due 
to a bleeding event, and 14 (77.8%) patients had a blood or platelet transfusion due to a bleeding event. 
Medical history included splenectomy for 9 (50.0%) patients) and 11 (61.1%) of patients were classified as 
hypertensive at study entry by either having hypertension recorded on medical history or by having a supine 
blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg recorded at screening or the baseline visit. Mean 
platelet count at baseline was 42,222/mm3 (range: 6,000 to 155,000/mm3).

From Table 14.1.7 Summary of Concomitant Medications, Safety Population 
The main drawback of this uncontrolled phase II open label study is the missing definitions of ITP specific 
concomitant medication used during the study as well as any consideration in the analyses. As illustrated 
above by excerpts from the relevant tables of the CSR, an obviously higher number of patients received ITP 
medication during the study than pre-study. Consequently, it is not considered feasible to evaluate any (add-
on) effect of fostamatinib. Therefore, this study is rather a proof-of-concept study and provides preliminary 
data for dose selection. Main evidence for efficacy derives from the pivotal phase III studies with supportive 
evidence from the open-label extension study. 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
C788 047 and C788 048: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of 
Fostamatinib Disodium in the Treatment of Persistent/Chronic ITP 
Master Protocol Versions 2.0 dated April 8 2014 for both studies 047 and 048 were the last versions effective 
before recruitment started. The protocols were revised several times. Changes to the protocol that were 
added after start of recruitment include changes to inclusion/exclusion criteria as well as clarifications 
regarding prior medication and definition of inclusion and baseline counts.  
Methods 
Study Participants 
The in- and exclusion criteria are in general endorsed and include the recommendations in the EMA 
“Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products intended for the treatment of chronic primary

transfusion support, or transaminase levels (ALT, AST) > 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), total 
bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dL, or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/minute at the time of 
screening.  
Treatments 
The initial dose was 100mg bid of fostamatinib or placebo. If platelet count remained low at week 4 and the 
study drug has been well tolerated, dose was to be increased to 150mg bid. Comprehensive guidance was 
provided for dose adjustments due to adverse events. Subjects could have been withdrawn from the study 
due to lack of response after 12 weeks of treatment or if rescue treatment was required after week 10. 
Subjects receiving doses twice daily self-administered 1 tablet in the morning and 1 in the evening. For once 
daily dosing, subjects self-administered 1 tablet daily in the morning. Tablets were taken with or without 
food. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 83/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
Dose adjustment to as low as 100 mg qd was recommended/performed in the event of intolerability or AEs. 
Four patients maintained their response on 100 mg/day after achieving a response at a higher dose. From a 
practical point of view this is acceptable, as the treating physician would be expected to end treatment, if 
there is a lack of response to this dose.  
Certain therapeutic regimens for ITP were permitted for subjects with platelet counts < 50,000/μL who 
needed “rescue” support for the platelet count. Allowed therapeutic regimens included: 
IVIg: up to 1 g/kg × 1 to 3 days, or 
• 
• 
IV anti-D IgG: up to 50 μg to 75 μg/kg × 1 to 2 days, or 
IV methylprednisolone up to 1 g/day for 1 to 3 days or oral dexamethasone up to 40 mg/day for 1 to 
2 days or oral prednisone up to 1 mg/kg/day for 1 to 3 days. 
The investigator was required to discuss all instances of “rescue therapy” with the sponsor’s medical monitor 
in advance of initiating the therapy whenever possible. Subjects receiving rescue therapy after Week 10 were 
deemed non-responders and were considered for study withdrawal. 
In the two placebo-controlled studies concomitant ITP medication could not be changed during the study 
whereas in extension study 049 this medicine could be tapered when a stable platelet count ≥50,000/µL had 
been reached. In the pivotal studies the TPO-RA’s tapering and/or discontinuation as the patients had effect 
was performed. Continuation of concomitant medication may provide an add-on effect and thereby making it 
difficult to assess the sole fostamatinib effect clearly. It is argued that a pre-planned analysis of the 
secondary endpoint “reduction of concomitant medication” was dropped from the SAP (study 049), because 
the incidence of dose reductions was low and the time on study too brief for analysis. Considering that Study 
049 was an uncontrolled open-label study, presented arguments imply that the potential dose reduction 
achieved by treatment with Fostamatinib was limited. Arguments why such a result would preclude analysis 
cannot be followed. It should be stressed, that omission of pre-planned analyses due to unfavourable 
outcomes is not considered appropriate. The Applicant provided the requested analysis. The majority of 
subjects had to maintain their concomitant ITP medication: 
Certain therapeutic regimens for ITP were permitted for subjects with platelet counts < 50,000/μL who need 
“rescue” support of the platelet count. The Applicant provided explanations and discussed the differences in 
terms of rescue treatment between both phase III studies. As the rate for rescue medication between 
fostamatinib and placebo patients is comparable in both studies, no further issue is made.

Objectives 
The primary objective of the studies was to establish the efficacy of fostamatinib as compared with placebo in 
achieving a stable platelet response in subjects with persistent/chronic ITP (superiority).  
Secondary objectives included assessment of the incidence of bleeding complications in subjects receiving 
fostamatinib as compared with placebo, and assessment of the overall safety and tolerability of fostamatinib 
versus placebo in subjects with persistent/chronic ITP. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was achievement of a stable platelet response by Week 24 defined as a platelet 
count of at least 50,000/μL on at least 4 of the last 6 scheduled visits between Weeks 14 and 24 inclusive. 
According to the protocol measurements of platelet count for the primary endpoint were to be performed at 
the local laboratory. Considering the reliability of the routine, standard measurements of platelet counts was 
supported by certification according to the local regulations and is consistent with standard clinical practice. 
The small number of subjects at each study site made the risk of a corresponding center effect low. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints of this study were as follows: 
•  Achievement of a platelet response (a platelet count of at least 50,000/μL) at Week 12. 
•  Achievement of a platelet response (a platelet count of at least 50,000/µL) at Week 24.  
•  Among subjects with a baseline platelet count < 15,000/μL, achievement of a count ≥30,000/µL and 
at least 20,000/µL above baseline at Week 12.  
•  Among subjects with a baseline platelet count < 15,000/μL, achievement of a count ≥30,000/µL and 
at least 20,000/µL above baseline at Week 24.  
• 
• 
Frequency and severity of bleeding according to the IBLS over the 24-week study period. 
Frequency and severity of bleeding according to the WHO bleeding scale over the 24-week study 
period. 
Safety Outcomes 
The safety outcomes of this study include the change from baseline in blood pressure, liver function, and 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC); and the incidence and severity of GI complaints, (nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, abdominal pain), and infections, as well as the overall incidence of adverse events. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Endpoints 
The PK endpoint of this study will be a preliminary assessment of the kinetics of fostamatinib in subjects with 
ITP.

Sample size 
For both studies, the sample size was determined to be a total of 75 patients (50 fostamatinib and 25 
placebo). This was based on providing 90% power for the primary efficacy endpoint of achieving a stable 
platelet response using a 2-sided, Fisher’s Exact Test with an alpha level of 0.05 and a 2:1 
(fostamatinib:placebo) allocation, assuming a true proportion for fostamatinib of 0.40 and a true proportion 
for placebo of 0.05. Clinical justification for these estimates has not been presented. The observed effect of 
fostamatinib is approximately 20 %. Drop-outs and other intercurrent events were not taken into account in 
the sample size calculations. The size of the confidence interval will be used as a measure of the uncertainty 
in the presented results.   
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
In both main studies, subjects were randomized (2:1, active:placebo) to receive fostamatinib or matching 
placebo for 24 weeks using permuted block randomization. Randomization was stratified to ensure that active 
and control populations have relatively equal representation of subjects with respect to prior splenectomy 
(yes/no) and severity of thrombocytopenia (platelets < 15,000/μL or ≥ 15,000/μL). 
Both studies were double-blinded, as recommended by the current guideline on thrombocytopenia 
(EMA/CHMP/153191/2013). Administrative measures were in place to protect the treatment allocation.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population includes all randomized subjects. All efficacy endpoints were analyzed 
based on the ITT population, and subjects were analyzed according to their randomized treatment 
assignment. The efficacy analyses based on the ITT population were considered the primary efficacy 
analyses. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) population included all subjects in the ITT population who had no major protocol 
violations. Major protocol violations included: 
•  Not receiving any study treatment. 
•  Not receiving the correct study treatment. 
• 
Failing to meet key (predefined) eligibility criteria. 
•  Other major protocol violations, as determined by a blinded review of the data before database lock. 
The analyses based on the PP population were considered secondary analyses of efficacy. 
The Safety Population included all randomized subjects who received any amount of randomized study drug. 
All analyses of safety were performed on the Safety Population, and subjects were analyzed according to the 
actual treatment they received. 
Placebo-Controlled Efficacy Population (ISE) was the same as a pooling of the ITT study populations used for 
the individual study analyses.  Data obtained after subjects transitioned from Study C788 047 or C788 048 to 
the long-term open label extension was not included.

Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is achievement of a stable platelet response by Week 24, defined as having a 
platelet count of at least 50,000/μL on at least 4 of the last 6 scheduled visits over Weeks 14-24. The 
comparison of proportions of responders and non-responders between the fostamatinib and the placebo arm 
was tested using a 2-sided Fisher’s Exact Test conducted with a significance level of 0.05. The exact 
(Clopper-Pearson) confidence intervals has been used.  
Intercurrent events and missing data  
•  Subjects who discontinue treatment prior to Week 24 due to lack of efficacy were considered non-
responders. 
•  Subjects who discontinue treatment prior to Week 24 due to AE were considered non-responders. 
•  Subjects who receive rescue treatment after 10 weeks were considered non-responders. 
•  Subjects who left the study due to other reasons were considered to have the same level of platelets 
as in the latest measurement (LVCF): For the primary and 4 platelet-related secondary endpoints 
imputation rules for missing values were applied. The imputation of missing values as non-responders 
for patients discontinuing due to AE or perceived lack of efficacy or for receiving rescue medication 
after week 10 is considered conservative. The use of LOCF for patients that discontinued the study 
drug due to other reasons is not endorsed, since this method has methodological disadvantages and 
is not necessary conservative. 
It was unclear how platelet levels of patients receiving rescue treatment or who had to pause treatment due 
to AE were handled for the analysis (e.g. how long after rescue medication were platelet counts considered 
related to rescue medication). However, the Applicant adequately clarified how corresponding platelet counts 
were handled for analysis.  
Sensitivity analyses 
A sensitivity analysis was planned for the primary efficacy endpoint using multiple imputation methods. For 
the non-monotone missing data, a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure was planned while chained equations 
were planned for monotone missing data. The imputed data sets were analyzed using a logistic regression 
model with a term for treatment and summarized using Rubin’s multiple imputation strategy. Only patients 
with evaluations in the efficacy period (Weeks 14 to 24) were going to be imputed with MI. Patients with 
missing primary endpoint and without observations in the efficacy period would be imputed as non-
responders: The approach is considered adequate, however it will be difficult to implement in case too few 
patients remain in the placebo part of the study. A post-hoc sensitivity analysis was performed where all 
LVCF imputed subjects were considered non-respondent. This is endorsed.  
A post-hoc analyses were all subjects with missing values were considered non-responders was also 
presented.  
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints related to proportions of patients with a certain platelet count were 
analysed in the same manner as the primary endpoint. The rules for intercurrent events were the same as 
those used for the primary endpoint.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 87/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
The difference in means between treatments for the IBLS scores across visits was tested using a two-sided, 
two-sample t-test. The mean of the WHO bleeding scale scores across visits during the 24-week treatment 
period was analyzed in the same manner. 
Multiplicity control for the primary and secondary endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints will only be analysed if the null hypothesis for the primary efficacy endpoint 
is rejected in favour of fostamatinib. According to the SAPs version 2, the secondary efficacy endpoints were 
to be analyzed using the fixed sequence testing procedure to control the type I error. However, this was not 
implemented because the sequence specified did not follow the usual ordering conventions for such an 
approach. 
Pooling of data 
The submission presented the results for each study separately and for the pooled data.

Study 048:  
The number of screen failures is approximately the same in the two pivotal studies. The main exclusion 
failures were related to violation of various laboratory criteria, hypertension and wash-out period violations. 
The main failed inclusion criterion was related to the platelet count measurements. 
It remains uncertain whether the following inclusion criterion was fulfilled for all subjects: “Subject’s platelet 
count averages < 30,000/μL (and none > 35,000 unless as a result of rescue therapy) from at least 3 
qualifying counts within the preceding 3 months. At least 2 of the qualifying counts must have been taken 
during the screening period.”  
Based on spot checks in the respective listings some patients were identified, who seem to deviate from this 
inclusion criterion: patient 047-470-0001 had a platelet count of 54500 at screen visit A and 19500 at screen 
visit B initially by the Applicant described as not being associated with rescue medication although later 
changed to being caused by rescue medication. This patient was counted as a responder to fostamatinib.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 90/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
Some additional subjects were identified with platelet counts >35,000 during screening: 047-490-001 (41000 
Screen B), 048-570-001 (71000 Screen A), 048-570-002 (68000 Screen A), 048-570-001 (43000 Screen A) 
and 048-473-006 (109000 Unscheduled Visit Screening Phase). Clarifications were provided that these 
subjects had platelet counts of >35.000 during screening due to rescue medication. An additional analysis of 
the primary endpoint excluding all patients who did not fulfil all inclusion and exclusion criteria has been 
provided. The result of the primary endpoint remained statistically significant in study 047, whereas the 
result of the primary endpoint remained being not statistically significant in study 048. No new concerns arise 
from these data.  
A sensitivity analysis excluding patients with deviations from eligibility has been performed and there is no 
change to the conclusion of the study. The number of screening visits did not have impact on the baseline 
platelet count used for randomization.  
Figure 1 (below) indicates by week available subjects measurements of platelet counts.  The numbers 
reported are adjusted, according to participant flow presented in Study Reports of Trial 047 and 048, 
considering 20 subjects who discontinued treatment due to reasons other than lack of efficacy at week 12 or 
later and patients receiving rescue medication having been removed.

a One patient randomized to the placebo group was assigned the wrong treatment kit by mistake, and was 
treated with fostamatinib for 2 weeks. This patient’s efficacy data were analyzed with the placebo arm, but 
his safety data were analyzed with the Fostamatinib arm. 
One patient in the placebo arm of study C788-048 achieved a stable platelet response according to the 
primary endpoint. Looking at lab values for this patient, fluctuating platelet counts are observed. Based on 
these observations, it is likely that this patient seems to have cyclic thrombocytopenia, and should not have 
been included in the study. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was achievement of a stable platelet response by Week 24 defined as a platelet 
count of at least 50,000/μL on at least 4 of the last 6 scheduled visits between Weeks 14 and 24 
inclusive.The efficacy seem to be approximately 16-18%: The percentage of responders in the fostamatinib 
arms in both studies was 16.8 %( 95 % CI: 9.5%, 24.1%). 
Post-hoc analyses 
The use of Last Observation carried Forward (LOCF): 
In study 048, there were 2 patients in the fostamatinib arm and 1 in the placebo arm who were imputed 
using LOCF. In the fostamatinib arm, one patient was considered responder and the other non-responder. 
The “responder” patient (subject 048-428-006) left the study due to relocation due to work/study-related 
reasons and may have been a responder given the patient’s platelet count (>50,000/µL week 8-16). 
However, it is more conservative to assume that this patient is a non-responder. Since a patient was imputed 
as responder in the active arm (non-conservative approach), the results of the sensitivity analysis is very

important. The primary analysis was repeated using MI for the mentioned subject and considering all subjects 
as non-responders. The results are concordant with those of the primary analysis:  
Listings of platelet counts for all patients give the impression that these are rather variable at least in some 
patients. In study 047 The most notable patient is 047-470-001 (Figure below). 
It is not considered comprehensible why this patient was counted as responder, as 3/6 platelet counts were 
below 50,000 between weeks 14-24. There seems to be a discrepancy between weeks and dates/study days 
in the respective listing 16.2.6.1 (listing of platelet count). From the dates/study days it seems that the

graphical illustration reflects the platelet counts correctly, whereas the designated weeks in the listing are 
wrong. In addition, this patient did not fulfill the criteria to continue treatment with fostamatinib after week 
12, as the platelet count at week 12 according to Listing 16.2.6.1 was 8,500/µl) and apparently had declined 
before dose reduction (see graph above; this is due to the fact that randomization date and treatment 
date/Day 1, are not the same, as they should be, see below). The site randomized patient 047-470-001 on 
17 March 2015, and the platelet count was 6,300/μL. However, to fulfill the protocol requirement for stable 
steroid dose less than 20 mg daily (prednisone equivalent), the subject’s actual start date for study 
drug/fostamatinib was 31 March 2015 and not on the randomization date. The Applicant has considered Day 
1 for this patient as the date of first dose of fostamatinib, and not the randomization date, which is not 
acceptable. The first day in the study is the randomization date. The fact that the subject was randomized 
without fulfilling the inclusion criterion is a protocol violation and not a reason to move the start date of the 
study. It is important to assure that the start date is consistently defined to avoid immortal bias. When the 
randomization date is considered Day 1, this patient is a non-responder (only 3/6 instead of 4/6 platelet 
counts were ≥ 50,000 between weeks 14-24). The Applicant presented two supplementary analysis to 
evaluate the effect of this patient on the results. In one case, this patient was removed, in the other case this 
patient was considered a non-responder. When removing this patient of the dataset, the stable responder 
proportion for fostamatinib is 16.00 % (95 % CI 0.13 %; 29.13%), which is lower than that reported for the 
primary analysis (17.6 %). When considering this patient a non-responder, the stable responder proportion 
for fostamatinib is 15.69 % (95 % CI 0.29 %; 28.66%), which is lower than that reported for the primary 
analysis (17.6 %). Both sensitivity analyses were in line with the results reported on the primary analysis and 
showed a statistical significance difference compared to placebo, although the CI were very wide and the 
lower end almost included 0 difference. It is acknowledged, that the sensitivity analyses still showed a 
statistically significant difference compared to placebo. Patient 047-470-001 has been moved from the 
responder into the non-responder population and the Effects Table in section 3.6 has been updated 
accordingly. 
Three patients had their first fostamatinib dose after the day of randomization (8, 1, and 1 day). As they 
were all non-responders there is no impact on efficacy.   
 Secondary endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints of platelet count ≥50,000/µL at week 12 and 24 for the entire population 
(Table 13) and for patients with at low baseline platelet count (Table 14) are considered supportive of the 
primary efficacy endpoint. A hierarchal testing to control for the type I error in the SAPs was not 
implemented and therefore it is concluded that the confidence intervals and p-values from the secondary 
endpoints are not meaningful.

IBLS and WHO Bleeding Scales 
Bleeding symptoms were assessed at each visit using two bleeding score scales, the IBLS and WHO bleeding 
scales. For each scale, the mean subject scores across visits were secondary endpoints. For each scale, mean 
scores across visits were numerically somewhat lower in the fostamatinib group (IBLS: 0.04 versus 0.06 for 
fostamatinib and placebo, respectively [95% CI -0.05, 0.02]; WHO: 0.26 versus 0.38 [95% CI -0.32, 0.09]) 
compared to the placebo group. For these two endpoints, the results based on the PP population were similar 
to the results based on the ITT population. 
There was no difference between arms for the secondary endpoint of bleeding-score (Table 15). This is not 
unexpected given that patients with a high IBLS were excluded from the study. Of note is the difference in 
IBLS between the two identical studies: in study 047 IBLS was higher (in both arms) than in study 048. One 
difference between the two studies is the mean age with patients in study 047 being on average 7.5 years 
older than in study 048.

The efficacy of fostamatinib in splenectomised patients compared to non-splenectomised patients is higher in 
study 048 whereas the opposite is the case for study 047, mainly illustrating the fact that the number of 
patients is too low to conclude anything with regards to the various subgroups.  
In study 047 only 1/9 (11.1%) responders previously received rituximab compared to 25/42 (59.5%) non-
responders whereas in study 048 3/9 (33.3%) of responders and 5/41 (12.2%) of non-responders previously 
received rituximab.  
The issues with the small number of patients is also evident for concomitant steroid treatment (Tables 
14.3.12.1 above). Other subgroups of particular interest, besides splenectomised patients and patients 
receiving concomitant ITP treatment, are the elderly (>65, >70, >75 years of age) and whether the patients 
had received prior TPO-RA treatment or not. Nevertheless, due to the limited data no conclusions as to the 
impact of concomitant treatment and the effect of age, prior splenectomy or TPO-RA treatment can be 
drawn.  
Summary of main efficacy results 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present application. 
These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit 
risk assessment (see later sections). The pivotal studies 047 and 048 are merged, as study design was 
identical. Results from 047 is written in black (and updated primary endpoint results in bold) and 048 in 
blue.

Supportive study(ies) 
C788 049: A Phase 3 Open-Label Extension Study of Fostamatinib Disodium in the Treatment of 
Persistent/Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenic.  
A total of 123 subjects from Studies C788-047 and C788-048 enrolled in this extension study (Table 2). 
Approximately 34.1% of subjects remained in the study at the time of the interim data cutoff. 
Of the 76 subjects randomized in Study C788-047, 59 subjects rolled over to Study C788-049. Nine subjects 
(7 subjects treated with fostamatinib and 2 subjects in the placebo group) had discontinued from Study 
C788-047 (and did not enter Study C788-049) because of AEs (C788 047, Table 14.1.1).  One subject 
treated with fostamatinib in Study C788-047 was a screen failure for Study C788-049. 
Of the 74 subjects randomized in Study C788-048, 64 subjects rolled over to Study C788-049. Four subjects 
(2 subjects treated with fostamatinib and 2 subjects in the placebo group) had discontinued from Study 
C788-048 (and did not enter Study C788-049) because of AEs (C788 048 Table 14.1.1). 
Five patients from study 047 and eight patients in study 048 in the fostamatinib arms (and only 1 placebo 
patient in 047 and 0 in 048) did not enter extension study 049 (Table 1 below) despite not having an AE (and 
they should still be blinded to the given treatment):  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019

The reason “Lack of Efficacy” (3 patients) after week 12 is puzzling given that neither the patients nor the 
treating physicians should know if the patients received fostamatinib or placebo. The patients should 
therefore have entered study 049 after week 12, unless they opted not to, but not for Lack of Efficacy. 
Furthermore, there were four “Withdrawal by Subject/Physician Decision” in the fostamatinib arms, but only 
one in one placebo arm.  
Certain therapeutic regimens for ITP were permitted for subjects with platelet counts < 50,000/μL who 
needed rescue support of the platelet count. 
Allowed therapeutic ITP rescue regimens included: 
• 
• 
Intravenous (IV) IgG (IVIg): up to 1 g/kg × 1 to 3 days, or 
IV anti-rho [D] immunoglobulin (anti-D IgG): up to 50 to 75 μg/kg for 1 to 2 days, or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 112/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
• 
IV methylprednisolone up to 1 g/day for 1 to 3 days, oral dexamethasone up to 40 mg/day for 1 to 2 
days or oral prednisone up to 1 mg/kg/day for 1 to 3 days. 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety of fostamatinib in subjects with 
persistent/chronic ITP. 
The secondary objectives of this study were to establish the long-term efficacy of fostamatinib in achieving 
and maintaining a stable platelet count in subjects who completed the treatment phase of Study C788-047 or 
C788-048, and to assess the PK profile of fostamatinib in subjects with persistent/chronic ITP. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
Long-Term Stable Platelet Response (Endpoint Version 1) – Satisfaction of this endpoint required 
meeting both of the following criteria: 
Achievement of a platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL within 12 weeks of beginning active treatment. 
Achievement of a sustained stable platelet response; defined as no 2 visits, at least 4 weeks apart, with a 
platelet count of < 50,000/μL, without an intervening visit with a platelet count of ≥ 50,000/μL unrelated to 
rescue therapy, within a period of 12 months following initial achievement of the target platelet count (see 
above). 
Subjects who discontinued treatment (for any reason) or received rescue medication within 12 months 
following the initial achievement of a platelet count of at least 50,000/μL were considered non-responders 
with respect to this endpoint. 
All 123 enrolled subjects were included in the analysis of this endpoint. 
Based on this analysis, 19 subjects (15.4%) achieved platelet response within 12 weeks and maintained 
stable platelet response for at least 12 months (95% CI: 9.6%, 23.1%) (Table 14.2.1.1).

Stable Platelet Response in Placebo Crossover Subjects (Endpoint Version 2) – Satisfaction of this 
endpoint required meeting both of the following criteria: 
1.  Achievement of a platelet count of at least 50,000/μL within 12 weeks of beginning treatment (placebo 
treatment in C788-047 or C788-048 and fostamatinib treatment in C788-049). 
2.  Achievement of a sustained stable platelet response; defined as no two visits, at least 4 weeks apart, 
with a platelet count < 50,000/μL, without an intervening visit with a platelet count of ≥ 50,000/μL, 
unrelated to rescue therapy, within a period of 12 weeks following initial achievement of the target 
platelet count (see above). 
The definition of response according to version 2 is different to that in the prior studies. This is due to the 
differences in study visit schedule of visits every 2 weeks in the Studies 047/048 to every 4 weeks in the 
Study 049. 
Subjects who discontinued treatment or subjects who received rescue medication within 12 weeks following 
achievement of a platelet count of ≥ 50,000/μL, were considered non-responders. 
A considerable number of unscheduled visits occurred during this study. In Studies 047 and 048, 
unscheduled visits were not taken into consideration for the analysis of the primary endpoint. Only platelet 
counts measured at scheduled visits contributed to the evaluation of the primary endpoint. However, in Study 
049, schedule and unscheduled visits were used. The reason is that in Study 049, the endpoints are time 
dependent and not visit dependent. Forty-four (44) subjects (randomized to placebo in the prior study) were 
included in the analysis of this endpoint. Ten subjects (22.7%) achieved a stable platelet response (C788-
049, Table 11-2), including one subject who had achieved this endpoint during treatment with placebo in the 
prior study.

The primary objective of study 049 was safety. Secondary objectives were related to long-term efficacy 
(version 1 of the primary efficacy objective) and stable platelet response in placebo crossover subjects 
(version 2 of the primary efficacy objective). The sample size was not selected to detect a predefined 
difference, and the endpoints were not adjusted for multiplicity. The study is considered relevant during this 
assessment since it provides information regarding the product efficacy and long-term use. However, the 
results are only considered supportive. Bearing in mind that study 049 is an open-label study with a low 
number of participants (44 placebo patients from the double-blinded studies) the results of the efficacy 
endpoint v2 of this study (Table 11-2) supports the efficacy of around 18% from the placebo-controlled 
studies. 19/123 (15.4%) had a stable platelet response for at least a year (Table 14.2.1.1).  
4/17 responders from the placebo-controlled trials lost their response in extension study 049 according to the 
primary efficacy endpoint version 1 (see Table 11-4 below).

Two deviations from the protocol not listed in the deviation listing have been noticed regarding rescue 
medication (i.e. IVIG and romiplostim) and patients receiving these treatments should have been considered 
non responders. Nevertheless, none of the responders received any non-allowed concomitant or rescue 
medication and subjects receiving rescue therapy after week 10 were treated in the analysis in an identical 
manner to that used for studies 047 and 048. Platelet counts observed within 4 weeks after any rescue 
medication, including any increase in concomitant steroid doses were not included in assessment of response. 
Study 049 is considered supportive only and main evidence for efficacy needs to be derived from the pivotal 
studies 047 and 048. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The indication pursued for Fostamatinib is for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients 18 years of 
age and older with persistent or chronic ITP who have had an insufficient response to one or more therapies.  
Fostamatinib is for oral administration.   
The efficacy of fostamatinib for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia in ITP has been 
evaluated in four clinical studies:  
• 
• 
• 
a Phase 2 study (D4300-022) (dose-finding) 
two Phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies (C788 047 and C788 048) (pivotal 
studies) 
an ongoing Phase 3, open-label, long-term extension study (C788 049) (supportive) 
In the dose-finding study (022) pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses could not be performed 
because of sample size limitations and thus do not comply with the recommendations in the EMA ITP 
guideline that doses should be evaluated for a platelet target level and range. Data are scarce with regards to 
a dose-response relationship and are based on PK data and Phase 2 results from the RA and ITP programs. 
The dose-response relationship issue is resolved as well as possible given the scarcity of data in ITP patients. 
The design of the placebo-controlled phase 3 studies are in line with the EMA ITP guideline (EMA “Guideline 
on the clinical development of medicinal products intended for the treatment of chronic primary immune 
thrombocytopenia”, EMA/CHMP/153191/2013). This includes accruing from multiple centres including 
Europeans, the double-blinded design and stratification according to splenectomy status. The pooling of these 
two studies is acceptable and in agreement with previous studies in ITP. The design of the studies is also in 
line with previous studies in ITP (romiplostim, eltrombopag). The EMA ITP guideline covers chronic ITP. There 
were 6/101 (6%) patients in the two placebo-controlled studies combined that had persistent (3-12 months 
since diagnosis) ITP. The applied indication for persistent ITP has been withdrawn. 
Dose adjustment to as low as 100 mg qd was recommended/performed in the event of intolerability or AEs. 
Four subjects, who had a continuous response on 100 mg QD, have been presented to justify the use of this 
dose in case of high platelet counts or poor tolerability. From a practical point of view this is acceptable, as 
the treating physician would be expected to end treatment, if there is a lack of response to this dose. 
The in- and exclusion criteria are in general endorsed. An exception is potentially inadequate wash-out times 
for prior treatment with IVIGs as well as rituximab. Partial agreement could be given to the argumentation 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 118/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
that efficacy assessment was done in week 14-24 and therefore any potentially inadequate wash-out time 
can be considered negligible. Furthermore, the mean duration of response to rituximab is about 10 months. 
Consequently, a wash-out period of 6 weeks is considered rather short. Nevertheless, as prior rituximab 
treatment commenced in 4 responders > 1 year ahead of fostamatinib treatment it is not considered having 
an impact on the platelet counts.  
Specific concurrent ITP therapies were allowed during the study. According to the GL corticosteroid 
dependent or other treatment dependent patients excluding the experimental drug will be considered as non-
responders. This was not applied in the trials. Clarification has been provided indicating that patients in 
studies 047 and 048 did not meet the definition of corticosteroid dependence. Of note, according to the 
inclusion criteria, patients have to receive stable doses of ITP concurrent medication for at least 14 days prior 
baseline. In contrast, the GL requires stable doses for at least 1 month. One patient (047-470-001) received 
concomitant steroid treatment before baseline and at the same time rescue steroid treatment, and is 
therefore not considered to have had a stable concomitant treatment ahead of baseline. 
Patients testing positive for H. pylori were highly likely to have received antibiotic eradication treatment, 
although this has not been specified further. One was a placebo treated patient and two were fostamatinib 
treated non-responders. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was achievement of a stable platelet response by Week 24 defined as a platelet 
count of at least 50,000/μL on at least 4 of the last 6 scheduled visits between Weeks 14 and 24 inclusive. 
This is in line with the EMA ITP guideline of a composite endpoint including a clinical meaningful platelet 
count remaining stable over a specified time period. One patient (047-470-001) did not commence treatment 
at the day of randomization but 2 weeks later; when considering randomization day as Day 1, this patient is 
a non-responder.  
The GL proposes to include bleeding signs/symptoms, time to response, duration of response, concomitant 
treatment reduction and need for rescue treatment as secondary endpoints. This is only sparsely covered by 
the submitted phase III trials. In case of bleeding other scores/scales were used than that recommended by 
the GL. Overall, provided data do not allow clear conclusions regarding bleeding risk of included patients and 
of the effect of fostamatinib on the bleeding risk. Assessment of efficacy of fostamatinib needs to be based on 
the surrogate parameter platelet counts. 
Study C788-049 was a phase III, open-label, extension study. Patients from studies C788-047 and C788-048 
were to be enrolled in this extension study either those who successfully completed the 24 week treatment 
period or who were withdrawn early as non-responder. This extension study is still ongoing and two interim 
reports were provided, the latest was considered for assessment. 
The primary measurement in this open-label extension study was platelet count done at every study visit. 
The first version of the primary efficacy endpoint was for the purpose of assessing efficacy among all subjects 
while they were on active treatment in one of the prior studies, in the current extension study, or in both, i.e. 
1) achievement of a platelet count of at least 50,000/μL within 12 weeks of beginning active treatment and 
2) Achievement of a sustained stable platelet response; defined as no 2 visits, at least 4 weeks apart, with a 
platelet count < 50,000/μL, without an intervening visit with a platelet count of ≥ 50,000/μL unrelated to 
rescue therapy, within a period of 12 months following initial achievement of the target platelet count. The 
second version of the primary efficacy endpoint was for the purpose of a within-subject, between study 
comparison of fostamatinib and placebo among subjects randomized to placebo in either of the prior studies. 
This version of the primary efficacy endpoint was the achievement and maintenance of a stable platelet count 
defined as follows: 1) Achievement of a platelet count of at least 50,000/μL within 12 weeks of beginning 
treatment (placebo treatment in the prior study and fostamatinib treatment in the present study) and 2) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 119/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Achievement of a sustained stable platelet response: defined as no two visits, at least 4 weeks apart, with a 
platelet count < 50,000/μL, without an intervening visit with a platelet count of ≥ 50,000/μL, unrelated to 
rescue therapy, within a period of 12 weeks following initial achievement of the target platelet count. Version 
2 of the primary endpoint considers intra-individual changes in treatment response for subjects randomized 
to placebo treatment in the prior randomized study. Comparable data on subjects who were randomized to 
fostamatinib are missing. Four of 17 responders in the placebo-controlled studies did not have a long term 
response in extension study 49 (> 12 months after week 12; primary efficacy endpoint, version 1). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study 047 the proportion of subjects achieving the primary efficacy endpoint of a stable platelet response 
by week 24 (defined as a platelet count of at least 50,000/μL on at least 4 of the last 6 scheduled visits 
between weeks 14 and 24 inclusive) was 17.6% (9/51) in the fostamatinib group and 0% (0/25) in the 
placebo group (p = 0.0261). When removing patient 047-470-001 from the analysis (only 3/6 visits with 
platelet counts of at least 50,000/μL when counting from the randomization day) the efficacy endpoint is 
15.7% (95% CI 5.7%, 25.7%); the study still shows significance although with very wide CIs (p=0.0471).  
In study 048 the proportion of subjects in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population achieving the primary efficacy 
endpoint of a stable platelet response was 18.0% (9/50) in the fostamatinib group and 4.2% (1/24) in the 
placebo group (p = 0.1519: NS).  
The data from the two placebo-controlled studies was pooled: The estimated proportion of subjects achieving 
a stable platelet response was 17.8% (18/101) in the fostamatinib group and 2.1% (1/49) in the placebo 
group (p = 0.0072).When removing patient 047-470-001 the response was 16.8% (17/101) in the 
fostamatinib group and 2.1% (1/49) in the placebo group (p=0.0071). The studies had identical study 
design, but the mean age of the patients differed by 7.5 years, and thus the populations are not entirely 
comparable.  
In the open-label extention study 049 the version 2 efficacy endpoint (Stable Platelet Response in Placebo 
Crossover Subjects) is supportive of the primary efficacy endpoint from the placebo-controlled studies: 10/44 
subjects (22.7%) achieved a stable platelet response including one subject who had achieved this endpoint 
during treatment with placebo in the prior study. The difference (fostamatinib – placebo) in the proportion 
responding was 20.5% (95% CI, normal approximation: 8.5%, 32.4%).  
The secondary efficacy endpoints of platelet count at week 12 and 24 for the entire population and for 
patients with at low baseline platelet count are considered supportive of the primary efficacy endpoint. The 
Applicant proposed a hierarchal testing to control for the type I error in the SAPs. However, this was not 
implemented and therefore it is concluded that the confidence intervals and p-values from the secondary 
endpoints are only nominal and cannot lead to strong conclusions.  
To better understand the effect of fostamatinib on platelet counts the Applicant was requested to provide an 
analysis of the absolute and relative change in platelet counts over time. To this end, results were presented 
from a mixed effects model for the ratio of post baseline to baseline platelet counts, which was fit based on 
pooled data from both studies. Corresponding results indicate an improvement in platelet counts starting 
from Week 2, which somehow remains stable until Week 12. The mean relative change (%) in platelet count 
at Week 12 was 81.6% for subjects in the fostamatinib group, compared with 7.6% for subjects in the 
placebo group. Given the large amount of discontinuation after Week 12, it is not possible to present firm 
conclusions regarding the effect at Week 24.

The median number of unique prior therapies was 3 in both studies in the fostamatinib arms and 5 and 4 for 
all ITP therapies in study 047 and 048, respectively, excluding splenectomy, which had been performed in 
39% and 28% of the patients, respectively (adding another ITP treatment for these patients). 6% had 
persistent ITP (3-12 months). Given the low efficacy compared to recommended treatments in second line 
such as splenectomy, rituximab, and TPO-receptor agonists (Provan et al., 2010, Neunert et al., 2011, 
Lambert and Gernsheimer, 2017, George and Arnold, 2018, Matzdorff et al, 2018) and the non-negligible 
adverse events in a non-malignant disease, the use of fostamatinib can be considered in adult patients who 
are refractory to other treatments.

Patient exposure 
ITP: 
Placebo-Controlled Period: data from the double-blind studies (047 and 048).  
Fostamatinib Exposure Period: data from 146 subjects receiving fostamatinib at any time in the double-
blind and extension studies (047, 048, and 049). 
In the ITP extension study 98 patients received fostamatinib ≥24 weeks (168 days) with a median of 204 
days (Table 2). Long-term safety is thus not evaluable in this indication. In the RA placebo-controlled studies 
627 patients received fostamatinib 200-300 mg/day for ≥24 weeks but <36 weeks with a median of 168 days 
for the entire cohort (Table 4), whereas in the entire fostamatinib dataset in RA (Table 5) 217 patients 
received fostamatinib (200-300 mg/day) for ≥3 years with a median of 483 days for the entire cohort (Table 
6). These patients usually have many co-morbidities making it difficult to evaluate long-term safety without a 
comparator/placebo, and the placebo-controlled period is less than 36 weeks. The Applicant has not 
suggested any new ways to evaluate long-term safety other than following the patients in study 049. Given 
the low number of patients, this is not satisfactory [19/123 subjects (15.4%) achieved platelet response 
within 12 weeks and maintained stable platelet response for at least 12 months (95% CI: 9.6%, 23.1%)].  
The Applicant has agreed to the request to submit the protocol for a PASS within 3 months after the CHMP 
opinion and before commencing the study. 
The safety information from the ITP and RA studies is accepted as the main source of safety data.

The Fostamatinib Safety Set (Table 5-6) encompasses all treatment with fostamatinib, including the 
double-blinded period in the primary studies, any open-label or crossover treatment in the primary studies, 
and all fostamatinib treatment in the extension studies.

Licensure in RA is not being pursued as fostamatinib did not affect bone erosion and joint destruction in 2/3 
phase 3 studies. Development and licensure in oncology is not being pursued.

Organ Classes with the highest subject incidences were Gastrointestinal disorders, Infections and 
infestations, Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, General disorders and administration site 
conditions, Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, Nervous system disorders, Investigations, and Vascular 
disorders. The Organ classes of occurrence can be deemed comparable to the placebo-controlled period with 
no major discrepancies.  
The most commonly reported adverse event was diarrhoea, which is in accordance to the findings observed 
in the placebo-controlled period.  
Overall, no major discrepancies in the observed AE profile could be observed in the fostamatinib exposure 
period.

Looking at the data, the AEs were generally higher in the 200-300 mg/day arm compared to the 100-150 
mg/day arm. 200-300 mg is the intended dose for ITP.  
There were generally more AEs in study 047 than 048 also compared to placebo; (patients in 047 were on 
average 7.5 years younger than in 048). No certain cause for the difference in AEs between the two placebo-
controlled studies can be found.  
With longer treatment there were more adverse events especially SAEs, moderate and severe AEs, and dose 
interruptions and withdrawals (Table 16). This is also the case for the RA-studies. The incidence of infections 
in the ITP studies also increased with long term treatment as seen when comparing the placebo-controlled 
period to the fostamatinib exposure period; 30.4% and 42.5%, respectively. There does not seem to be a 
period after which the AEs decrease/stabilise, which is a concern since the treatment is continuous. 
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) 
ITP: 
The types (SOC and PT) of AEs in the ITP and RA pooled placebo-controlled studies were overall consistent 
(Tables 18 and 21 for SOC and tables 19 and 22 for PT for ITP and RA, respectively): 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019

Severe AEs (grade 3-4) were reported in 16 subjects (15.7%) receiving fostamatinib and 7 subjects (14.6%) 
receiving placebo. Dyspnea (2% fostamatinib, 0% placebo) and thrombocytopenia (1% fostamatinib, 4.2% 
placebo) were the only severe AEs reported for > 1 subject in either treatment group.

RA:  
The greatest differences between treatment groups were seen in Gastrointestinal (26.8% vs. 16.0%), 
Vascular (15.2% vs. 5.5%), and Investigations (15.1% vs. 7.2%) for fostamatinib vs. placebo, respectively 
(Table 21). 
Regarding fostamatinib dose effects, the 200–300 mg/day group tended to have higher incidences within 
several SOCs relative to the 100–150 mg/day group, but these differences were typically only 2% or less. 
With regard to dose-related differences within fostamatinib, there were 3 AEs with a difference in incidence 
greater than 1%: hypertension, dizziness, and vomiting. The greatest difference was in hypertension (12.8% 
vs. 14.2% for the lower vs. higher doses; Table 22).

Treatment related adverse events (TRAE) 
ITP: 
Fostamatinib exposure period: 
96 subjects (65.8%) had adverse events that were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably 
related to the study drug with diarrhoea being the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event. 
This is in accordance to the findings observed in the placebo-controlled period. Overall, no major 
discrepancies in the observed AE profile could be observed in the fostamatinib exposure period. A higher than 
expected rebound (decrease) in the platelet count after stopping treatment with fostamatinib either in 
patients defined as responders or non-responders has not been detected. 
Adverse Events by Severity 
Fostamatinib Placebo controlled period (PCP): 
Dyspnea (2% fostamatinib, 0% placebo) and thrombocytopenia (1% fostamatinib, 4.2% placebo) were the 
only severe AEs reported for > 1 subject in either treatment group. 
Fostamatinib exposure period (FEP): 
Most AE observed in the fostamatinib exposure period were mild to moderate. 35 subjects (24.0%) compared 
to 16 subjects (15.7%) receiving fostamatinib in the PCP and 7 subjects (14.6%) receiving placebo in the 
PCP had severe AE.  In the FEP severe AE reported were thrombocytopenia and diarrhoea, pneumonia, 
sepsis, dyspnea, petechiae, platelet count decreased, transaminases increased, nephrolithiasis. These Events 
can be considered to be related to the mechanism of action and are comparable to the findings in the PCP or

to those observed in the RA program, where more subjects compared to the ITP program have been 
included.

Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
ITP:  
Placebo controlled period: 
GI complaints are commonly seen in tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. As such nausea/vomiting, non-
infectious diarrhea SMQ events, and abdominal pain were among the most common AEs reported in 
fostamatinib treated subjects. Non-infectious diarrhea events and nausea are considered definitely related 
and abdominal pain possibly related to fostamatinib treatment. 
Hypertension: Fostamatinib treatment clearly increases the risk for hypertension with the possibility of the 
very high increase of BP leading to hypertensive crisis. Therefore, regular monitoring of blood pressure is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 136/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
deemed necessary in the already polypathic patient population in order to insure prompt counter measures 
such as dose adjustments or antihypertensive medication. Overall, around 80% of fostamatinib subjects and 
83% of placebo subjects with Hypertension required no intervention for a hypertension event during the 
Placebo-controlled Period. 
Drug-related hepatic disorders: Hy’s Law criteria for drug-induced liver injury was not met in any subject. 
However, a clear pattern towards transaminase increase could be observed in fostamatinib treated subjects. 
This is consistent with the observations in tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
Increased ALT/AST is an important identified risk associated with the use of fostamatinib as well as with other 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  
Neutropenia: In the clinical development program of fostamatinib reduction in neutrophils could already be 
observed, which were reversible with discontinuation of the study drug. In most cases dose reduction 
mitigated the neutropenia allowing subjects to remain on the study drug. Neutropenia may potentially bear 
the risk of an infection, thus the complete blood count with differential to evaluate the absolute neutrophil 
count is deemed necessary during therapy as already reflected in the SmPC. 
Infection: A clear association between neutropenia and infection is difficult to obtain from the available date. 
However, this remains a non-negligible uncertainty. A small tendency towards upper respiratory tract 
infections could be observed in fostamatinib treated subjects. Fostamatinib’s inhibition of the Syk pathway in 
macrophages suggests a theoretical risk of infection. 
RA: 
Placebo-controlled period 
In general, the occurrences of significant hypertension were handled by means of antihypertension 
medications (discussed in the individual clinical study reports), dose modifications, and treatment 
discontinuation. Hypertension led to treatment discontinuation in 0.7% of fostamatinib subjects vs. 0.1% of 
placebo subjects. 
Neutropenia: The percentage of subjects who maintained their baseline toxicity grade during treatment 
were 80.6% vs. 95.8% for fostamatinib vs. placebo, respectively downward shifts were generally of only 1 or 
Assessment report

2 grades. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent Grade 3/4 toxicity for fostamatinib vs. placebo was 
1.1% vs. 0.2%, respectively. Treatment discontinuation due to neutropenia occurred in 0.2% of subjects 
receiving fostamatinib and 0.1% of subjects receiving placebo. 
Infection: 25.6% of fostamatinib subjects and 20.1% of placebo subjects experienced at least 1 AE in the 
Infections and Infestations SOC. Nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory infections were the only AEs reported 
in more than 2% of subjects (3.8% and 2.4% in the fostamatinib group respectively; slightly lower that than 
the placebo group [2.1% and 1.9%, respectively]). No SAE by preferred term was reported at a frequency 
exceeding 0.3%. 
Drug-related hepatic disorders (Preferred Term) in the RA placebo-controlled studies are presented in Table 
4.1.10.1:  
Healthy subjects: 
A summary of the most commonly occurring TEAEs from the 4 multiple-dose placebo studies with 10 or more 
subjects each (C788-003, C788-013, D4300-007, and D4300-012) is provided in Table 10 showing the 
placebo and fostamatinib incidences for each study separately and the cumulative incidences across studies.

Taken together, the following incidences were generally higher in the fostamatinib compared to the placebo 
cohorts for the following TEAEs: nausea, diarrhoea, rash, and vomiting. This is consistent with the TEAEs 
reported across all healthy volunteers‘ studies.  Overall, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events 
was low in healthy subjects, regardless of dose. 
Conclusion on comparison between ITP studies versus RA studies 
The adverse events of special interest in study 047 and 048 are in line with the previously described AESIs 
from the RA studies: No new AESI was identified. The incidence of the various AESIs were generally higher in 
the ITP population (see data for hypertension, hepatic disorders and neutropenia in the following). An 
acceptable explanation for the blood pressure effects and the neutropenia is that the dose level generally 
studied in the ITP population, 150mg BID, was higher than that studied in the RA patient population, 150mg 
QD -100mg BID.  
The higher incidence of hepatic disorders in the ITP population compared to the RA population is by a panel 
of hepatologist considered to be coincidental caused by the low number of ITP patients and events 
(overlapping CI). Furthermore, one would not expect a worse safety profile in ITP patients compared to RA 
patients, which supports the finding as coincidental. 
Hypertension SMQ (narrow) AEs during the placebo-controlled period was reported for 27.5% of subjects 
receiving fostamatinib and 12.5% of subjects receiving placebo in the ITP population whereas in the RA 
population (200-300 mg/day) the corresponding numbers were 17.8% vs. 6.7%.  
For drug related hepatic disorders (SMQ, narrow search) the results in the RA population receiving 200-
300 mg/day fostamatinib was 7.4% (96/1303) compared to 3.4% (40/1169) in the placebo arm. The 
relatively high incidence observed in the placebo arm is most likely linked to the current or previous use of 
other hepatotoxic drugs for the treatment of RA, for instance methotrexate. The corresponding incidences in 
ITP were 15.4% (16/102) vs 2.1% (1/48) confirming the hepatotoxic effect of fostamatinib especially in the 
ITP population.  
Neutropenia was 4.1% in the fostamatinib 200-300 mg/day cohort compared to 0.5% in the placebo arm in 
RA studies. This is lower than seen in ITP, where the corresponding percentages were 6.9% vs 0%. 
Infections were observed in 30.4% (31/102) of ITP subjects receiving fostamatinib and 20.8% (10/48) in 
Assessment report

the placebo arm. The corresponding numbers for the 200-300 mg/day cohort in the placebo-controlled RA 
studies were 26.5% (345/1303) and 20.1% (235/1169) in the placebo arm.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
ITP: In the ITP studies 3 deaths have been recorded. 1 patient died of sepsis, 1 of lobar pneumonia and 1 of 
multiple myeloma. In the former first 2 cases the death is considered unlikely related to fostamatinib which 
therefore is not regarded as contributing to the fatal outcome. In the latter case, neoplasms have not been 
reported more frequently in the fostamatinib arm compared to placebo, but this may also be due to the short 
treatment period. In RA there were 19 neoplasms (n=2205) in the fostamatinib 200-300 mg/day arm and 12 
(n=1232) in the 100-150 mg/day arm in the Fostamatinib safety analysis set, both with and incidence rate of 
0.6 person years  
RA: 
In the RA studies (all) deaths from infections were higher than expected when comparing to registry rates, 
which is of concern. 
Deaths across all RA studies and study periods 
Within 28 days of the last dose of study drug 31 of 3427 subjects (0.9%) exposed to fostamatinib died. 7 
deaths were deemed potentially drug related and occurred after 37–184 weeks of fostamatinib exposure. 
These included interstitial lung disease, circulatory collapse, cardiogenic shock, viral pneumonia, toxic 
epidermal necrolysis, sepsis, and cardiopulmonary failure. 
AstraZeneca conducted an independent epidemiology study (“Fostamatinib Epidemiology Program”) in 2013. 
Goal was to compare outcomes in the RA clinical development program with 5 established Registries. 3240 
fostamatinib treated subjects contributed to 4486 person-years of follow up. In 2013 27/3240 subjects died 
throughout the clinical program. The incidence rate of all-cause mortality was calculated to be 0.6 per 100 
person-years (95% CI: 0.40, 0.88), which lies within the incidence rate from the 5 registries (0.19 to 0.80 
deaths per 100 person-years). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 140/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
The rate of cardiovascular mortality in the fostamatinib program was calculated at 0.22 per 100 person-years 
(95% CI: 0.11, 0.41), compared with the rates from the registries which ranged from 0.07 to 0.23 per 100 
person-years. 
However, the rate of infection mortality was higher in the fostamatinib program: 0.20 per 100 person-years 
(95: CI: 0.09, 0.38) compared with the registry rates that ranged from 0.03 to 0.13 per 100 person-years. 
Considering that trends towards infections could be observed in the RA clinical development program as well 
as in the ITP development program, a non-negligible amount of uncertainties remains which may have 
impact on the overall Benefit Risk, especially since the ITP program cannot be set into context due to the 
limited subject number available.  commmitments has been taken in order that the incidence of serious or 
opportunistic infections will be monitored in a PASS. Furthermore, the RMP and the SmPC have been 
reflecting this concern including guidance on risk minimisation measure. 
Healthy subjects 
No deaths were reported in the clinical pharmacology studies conducted in a total of 622 healthy subjects. 
SAEs 
SAEs reported in subjects exposed to fostamatinib included infectious complications, diarrhoea, and, in 
subjects with ITP, bleeding complications.

Fostamatinib Exposure Period 
In the Fostamatinib Exposure period, 39 subjects (26.7%) (13 included in Fos-PCP) had SAE. The most 
frequently reported SAEs were Thrombocytopenia (7 subjects, 4.8%) and epistaxis (5 subjects, 3.4%). Other 
SAEs reported in more than 1 subject were pneumonia, sepsis, diarrhea, GI hemorrhage, and transaminases 
increased (2 subjects, 1.4% each) (1 diarrhea event in Fos-PCP). 
Nine subjects had serious AE deemed related to the study drug of whom 4 reported these SAE while on 
fostamatinib treatment during the PCP. Therefore overall 4 subjects had treatment related SAE in the FEP 
with diarrhea (1 subject), sepsis (1 subject), atrial fibrillation (subject), transaminases increased (1 subject), 
upper respiratory tract infection and pyrexia (both events reported in 1 subject) being the most common 
ones. Overall, the type of SAE can be deemed comparable to the PCP. 
3 treatment-related serious adverse events (febrile neutropenia, hypertensive crisis, atrial fibrillation) led to 
study drug interruptions and 4 to withdrawal (pneumonia, diarrhea, sepsis, and transaminase increased). 
Overall, the SAE occurred in the FEP are in accordance with the known safety profile with no new emerging 
SAE in comparison to the PCP.

RA: 
All SAEs reported in the 6 RA studies that were categorized by the investigator as cardiovascular were 
adjudicated by a blinded independent committee. Results of this adjudication process are summarized in 
Appendix 2: Tables 4.3.1.1 (below) and 4.3.2.1. 
Assessment report

In ITP SAEs observed in the fostamatinib arm only (>1 subject, Table 17) included the most commonly 
observed adverse events of diarrhoea and hypertension (hypertensive crisis) and 5 subjects with bleeding-
related SAEs. There were twice as many bleeding complications in the placebo arm compared to the 
fostamatinib arm.  
There were 18 SAEs in 13 patients in the fostamatinib arm in the placebo-controlled studies (ISS-ITP, 
Appendix 2, Table 3.1.1.1.1). Looking at the individual patient narratives only 17 SAEs were identified.  
Patient 047-500-003 had 2 serious adverse events of thrombocytopenia.  
Laboratory findings 
Only data from the placebo-controlled studies in ITP and RA have been evaluated.

Haematology 
ITP: 
RA: 
No treatment effects on platelet counts were seen in the summary statistics, with median values in both 
treatment groups fluctuating modestly in the upper 200 x 109/L range.  
PT neutropenia was 4.1% in the fostamatinib 200-300 mg/day cohort compared to 0.5% in the placebo arm 
(ISS-RA, Table 4.1.2.1). This is lower than seen in ITP, where the corresponding percentages were 6.9% vs 
0% (see also AESIs).   
Clinical chemistry 
No pattern of renal AEs was observed in ITP or RA placebo-controlled studies. 
During the Placebo-Controlled Period in the ITP studies, 16 subjects (15.7%) treated with fostamatinib and 1 
placebo subject (2.1%) had a Drug Related Hepatic Disorder SMQ AE. This was mainly related to 
increased ALT and AST and bilirubin (see Table 3.1.8.1.1 in section 4.3). Safety in patients with hepatic 
insufficency has not been investigated: Patients with AST, ALT or bilirubin >1.5 ULN were excluded. See also 
the AESI section above.

Safety in special populations 
Given the small number of patients in the two placebo controlled studies no meaningful differences can be 
discerned.  
ITP: 
Analysis by Gender 
Exposure: 
With regards to exposure the median total daily dose of study drug were similar between females and males 
during the Placebo-Controlled Period.  The median duration of exposure was longer for females than for 
males in the fostamatinib exposure period. 
Adverse Events: 
When looking at AE reported in either treatment group in relation to gender it could be observed, that the AE 
reported in the fostamatinib exposure period were generally comparable with those observed for fostamatinib 
treated subjects in the PCP. Nausea and headache were more frequently reported for females in the PCP. AE 
reported with ≥ 10% higher treatment difference were hypertension and dizziness occurring more commonly 
in female subjects and epistaxis occurring more commonly in males in the PCP. 
In the fostamatinib exposure period, nausea and hypertension occurred more frequently in female subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 146/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Adverse Events of Interest: 
When looking at AE of interest gastrointestinal complaints were reported for both treatment groups in the 
PCP more commonly in female subjects and also more commonly in female subjects in the fostamatinib 
exposure period. 
Hypertension 
Hypertension SMQ AEs occurred with a higher incidence in female subjects in the PCP, while in the 
fostamatinib exposure period male subjects were more effected. Increased BP (SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 
mmHg) was comparable for males and females during the Fostamatinib Exposure Period, although maximum 
SBP ≥ 140 and < 160 mmHg was more common among females than males. A greater difference between 
the fostamatinib and placebo treatment group could be observed for females (32.8% fostamatinib, 10.0% 
placebo) compared to males (36.6% fostamatinib, 22.2% placebo). This also applies for the SBP ≥ 140 and < 
160 mmHg and DBP DBP ≥ 90 and < 100 mmHg. 
Transaminase and Bilirubin Elevations 
When looking at transaminase and bilirubin elevations Drug-Related Hepatic Disorders SMQ were comparable 
for both genders in the PCP.  Drug-Related Hepatic Disorders SMQ were more frequently observed in 
fostamatinib treated subjects. This trend also applies for the fostamatinib exposure period. 
Neutropenia 
With regards to neutropenia AEs and neutrophil count no major discrepancies in incidence between both 
genders could be observed. With regards to infections, no major discrepancies between gender could be 
observed in either the PCP or the fostamatinib exposure period. 
Overall, AE seem to occur more frequently in female subjects. Although it can be argued that bodyweight 
may play a role, preclinical findings seem to indicate, that females may have a greater exposure, which may 
result in different AE profile. Preclinical findings and exposure-response analysis seem to indicate only 
negligible differences in exposure to fostamatinib concerning gender.  
Overall, nevertheless, it could be observed, that the incidence of GI complaints was higher for females in the 
PCP (44.3% vs. 36.6%), mainly triggered due to the differences in the preferred term nausea (26.2% vs. 
7.3%). Same applies for the FEP with differences in incidences of (49.4% vs. 40.7%), again, mainly driven 
by the differences observed with regards to the preferred term nausea (26.4% vs. 8.5%). 
As for Hypertension in the PCP, the differences for the incidences between female and male fostamatinib 
treated subjects were 34.4% versus 19.5%. In the FEP differences were 33.3% vs. 20.3%. 
Therefore, it cannot be fully concluded that these observations result in no clinically relevant difference 
between gender, especially with regards to the AE´s Nausea and Hypertension.  Therefore, the Applicant has 
committed that the incidence of this adverse event will be monitored in a PASS. 
RA: 
Gender 
Women tended to have higher incidences of the common AEs: those differing by more than 3% between 
sexes were diarrhea (25.4% vs. 16.7%), urinary tract infection (7.2% vs. 1.2%), neutropenia (6.4% vs. 
1.5%), headache (7.9% vs. 4.3%), ALT increase (6.3% vs. 3.1%), and nausea (8.3% vs. 5.3%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 147/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
However, it has to be kept in mind that the overall RA population included more women (82.8%) than men 
which may confound the observations made. Explanation for the higher portion of female subjects may be 
that generally RA affects more females between the ages of 40 to 70 years than men do. Nonetheless, the 
observation that women may be more prone for AE would comply with the observations made in the ITP 
program. 
Race 
The incidences for neutropenia and pyrexia were higher in the Asian population while the white population 
showed higher incidences of diarrhoea, nausea and ALT increase. The incidence of hypertension by race 
demonstrated inconsistent results depending upon the analysis. Based on AE reports of hypertension by the 
investigator as reflected, Asians and blacks had more hypertension than the white population. Based on 
actual BP measurement from the Placebo-Controlled Period, blacks had the highest incidence and Asians the 
lowest. 
The applicant states as possible explanation the difference in evaluating hypertension, capturing pre-existing 
hypertension versus evaluation of treatment-emergent hypertension. However, taking the fixed mg dosing 
into account, lower bodyweight may bear the possibility for a higher exposure and in consequence higher 
susceptibility to develop hypertension, as for the Asian population. Unfortunately, only 5 subjects with 
bodyweight <50 kg were included in the ITP program. Therefore, no profound conclusions can be drawn from 
the comparison between bodyweight. However, considering the RA population the average number of adverse 
events per subject treated with fostamatinib was similar across the weight categories, including the lowest 
weight category of <50 kg. The average number of events per subject was 3.4 in the <50 kg group, 3.1 in 
the ≥50 to <75 kg group, 3.0 in the ≥75 to <100 kg group, and 3.0 in the ≥100 kg group indicating no 
major impact of bodyweight. This is consistent with non-clinical findings and exposure response analysis. 
Pregnancy 
Nonclinical studies have established that fostamatinib given early in pregnancy can increase the risk of 
embryonic loss, retard growth, and promote specific malformations of the kidney (including agenesis) and 
associated urogenital (eg, ureter) tissues, as well as variations/ malformations in major vessel and skeletal 
development. These effects are consistent with known targets of fostamatinib including Syk (target) and Ret-
kinase (off-target). 
To date, 15 pregnancies have been reported during the course of the clinical development program for 
fostamatinib (Phase 2 and 3 trials) with outcomes of 3 healthy babies, 1 premature baby, 1 stillbirth, 4 
spontaneous abortions or miscarriages, and 6 elective abortions. Fourteen of these pregnancies occurred in 
the RA program, and 1 in the ITP program. Most of these subjects were taking potentially teratogenic drugs 
such as methotrexate. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The TEAEs in healthy subjects reflect the AESIs. For more details see the pharmacology section.  
Discontinuation due to AEs 
The TEAEs leading to dose reduction and dose interruption in ITP patients were generally in line with the 
known AESIs.

TEAEs leading to dose reduction: 
TEAEs leading to withdrawal of fostamatinib: 
Placebo-controlled Period: 
122 of the 150 subjects discontinued from the study before Week 24 (75.5% fostamatinib, 93.8% placebo). 
The most common reason was lack of response at week 12 or later (59.8% fostamatinib, 85.4% placebo). It 
has to be noted in this context, that subjects were allowed per protocol to discontinue their participation at 
week 12 in the PCP to roll over to the open-label study C788-049. Study drug was withdrawn due to AEs in 
10 (9.8%) fostamatinib treated subjects and 4 (8.3%) placebo treated subjects. AEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation is presented in Table 20 below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 150/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Fostamatinib Exposure Period: 
34.1% of the 123 subjects receiving fostamatinib in study C788-049 were still continuing medication at the 
data cut off March, the 8th 2018 and 65.9% had discontinued prematurely. The most common reason was 
lack of response in 35.8% of the cases. AE leading to discontinuation in more than 1 subject were diarrhea (6 
subjects, 4.1%), neutropenia (3 subjects, 2.1%), thrombocytopenia, hepatic enzyme increased, and 
pneumonia (2 subjects, 1.4% for all). 
In the fostamatinib exposure period 15 subjects had a dose reduction with hepatic enzyme increased and 
diarrhoea being the most common reason. Withdrawal from the study drug occurred in 27 subjects with 
diarrhoea and neutropenia being the most common reason. 
In the fostamatinib exposure period 35 subjects had a dose interruption with alanine aminotransferase 
increased and diarrhoea being the most common reason. 
Overall, no major discrepancies could be observed in comparison to the PCP.   
RA: 
In the Placebo-Controlled RA studies, 7.5% of fostamatinib subjects and 3.8% of placebo subjects 
experienced AEs that resulted in discontinuation of study drug. Of those randomized to fostamatinib, 69.1% 
completed the blinded treatment period. Reasons for premature discontinuation in this group included lack of 
efficacy (10.9%), AE (9.9%), and withdrawal of consent by the patient (7.9%). The only AE that led to 
discontinuation of study drug reported at a > 1% higher incidence in the fostamatinib group compared with 
the placebo group was diarrhea (1.5% vs 0%, respectively).

Post marketing experience 
Based on the information in the 3 US Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Report (PADER) and all currently 
available data, no significant new safety data was identified that would change the safety profile of 
fostamatinib, when used for its approved indication, at the recommended dose, and in the approved 
population. No change in the current approved product label was warranted. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the ITP extension study 98 patients received fostamatinib ≥24 weeks (168 days) with a median of 204 
days. Long-term safety is thus not evaluable in this indication. In the RA placebo-controlled studies 627 
patients received fostamatinib 200-300 mg/day for ≥24 weeks but <36 weeks with a median of 168 days for 
the entire cohort, whereas in the entire fostamatinib dataset in RA  217 patients received fostamatinib (200-
300 mg/day) for ≥3 years with a median of 483 days for the entire cohort.  
The types (SOC and PT) of AEs in the ITP and RA pooled placebo-controlled studies were overall consistent. 
The adverse events of special interest [(AESI; gastrointestinal, hypertension, neutropenia, infection, 
drug-related hepatic disorders (transaminase and bilirubin elevation)] in study 047 and 048 are in line with 
the previously described AESIs from the RA studies: No new AESI was identified. The incidence of the various 
AESIs were generally higher in the ITP population especially with regards to hypertension, hepatic disorders, 
and neutropenia.  
When considering treatment related AE 60 (58.8%) fostamatinib treated subjects and 13 (27.1%) placebo 
treated subjects had AE possibly or probably related to study drug in the placebo controlled period. The most 
common reported treatment related AE was diarrhoea (26.5% fostamatinib, 12.5% placebo) followed by 
nausea, hypertension, dizziness and ALT or AST increase. 
The TEAEs leading to dose reduction and dose interruption in ITP patients were generally in line with the 
known AESIs. 
SAEs reported in subjects exposed to fostamatinib included infectious complications, diarrhoea, and, in 
subjects with ITP, bleeding complications. In ITP SAEs observed in the fostamatinib arm only included the 
most commonly observed adverse events of diarrhoea and hypertension (hypertensive crisis) and 5 subjects 
with bleeding-related SAEs. There were twice as many bleeding complications in the placebo arm compared 
to the fostamatinib arm (12.7% versus 20.8%), but this appears to be mainly driven by the fact, that the 
placebo group had more bleeding events classified as SAE (fostamatinib: 4,9% versus Placebo 10,4%).  
With regards to deaths, 1 fostamatinib treated subject and one placebo treated subject died in the placebo 
controlled period (PCP). Both events were considered to be unrelated to the study medication, which can be 
endorsed (Plasma Cell Myeloma in the fostamatinib group and Sepsis in the placebo group). In the 
fostamatinib exposure period 3 fatal events occurred. One was included in Fos-PCP. One subject died of lobar 
pneumonia after approximately 9.5 months of open-label treatment and 4 days after the end of study visit in 
Study C788-049. This event was considered to by unlikely related to the study medication, which can be 
endorsed. 
A second patient died of sepsis. This 55 year old fostamatinib-treated (non-responder) woman had a fever 
and vomiting and diarrhoea two days before being admitted. As part of her previous ITP treatments she had 
been splenctomised. Blood cultures revealed streptococcus pneumoniae. She deteriorated rapidly. Fatal 
infection due to this type of bacteria is a well-known risk in splenectomised subjects. The investigator 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 152/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
deemed this event to be unlikely related, whereas the Sponsor could not rule out an aggravating effect 
entirely.  
The possible detrimental effect on bone formation in patients > 18 years of age that have not reached full 
skeletal maturity, and patients healing after fractures has been included as important potential risks in the 
RMP and a warning has been included in the SmPC. 
Moreover, to better investigate on long term safety which is missing in the specific studies for fostamtinib in 
ITP population, it has been imposed a post authorisation safety study (PASS) with the objective to to collect 
information on the long-term safety/tolerability of fostamitanib in clinical practice, for the treatment of 
chronic ITP in adult patients who have received or are not candidates for three or more other treatments. The 
main safety concerns addressed will be: Serious and opportunistic infections; Bone fractures and fracture 
healing; Osteoporosis; ADRs leading to dose reduction or discontinuation of fostamatinib treatment; SAEs; 
Pregnancies; Deaths of any cause Long term safety data; Selected adverse events including Diaorrhea, 
Hypertension, Hepatoxicity, Neutropenia and Infections in line with the described Adverse event of special 
interest. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Fostamatinib displays a non-negligible risk profile as outlined throughout the assessment. However, the AE of 
interest were detectable with clinical monitoring measures and were overall manageable with dose 
reduction/modification. The SmPC reflects appropriate precaution measures in this context. 
The Applicant has agreed to the request to submit the protocol for a PASS within 3 months after the CHMP 
opinion and before commencing the study.  
In summary, the risk profile for fostamatinib is generally manageable.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.2 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 17 April 2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of fostamatinib with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of 
isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers fostamatinib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet does not yet meet the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. The 
applicant will submit the results of a user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet that 
meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet 
of medicinal products for human use prior to placing the product on the market. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Tavlesse (fostamatinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained 
in any medicinal product authorised in the EU and it has a PASS imposed at the time of authorisation.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired immune mediated disorder characterized by isolated 
thrombocytopenia, defined as a peripheral blood platelet count less than 100 x 109/L, and the absence of any 
underlying cause. Until recently, the abbreviation ITP stood for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, but due 
to the current knowledge of the immune mediated mechanism of the disease, and the absence or minimal 
signs of bleeding in most cases have led to a revision of the terminology. 
ITP is classified by duration into newly diagnosed, persistent (3-12 months’ duration) and chronic (≥ 12 
months’ duration). Whereas ITP in adults typically has an insidious onset with no preceding viral or other 
illness and it normally follows a chronic course, ITP in children is usually short-lived with at least two-thirds 
recovering spontaneously within 6 months. 
Common clinical symptoms of ITP include bruising, menorrhagia, and bleeding from the gastrointestinal 
and/or urinary mucosal tracts, as well as epistaxis. To some extent, overt bleeding is related to the platelet 
count, with nearly all major bleeding occurring when platelet levels are below 30,000/μL (Arnold 2015). The 
rate of fatal hemorrhage has been estimated to be between approximately 0.02 and 0.04 cases per adult 
patient-year and the predicted 5-year mortality was 2.2% for patients younger than 40 years with an 
increase to 47.8% for patients older than 60 years (Cohen 2000). Non-intracerebral severe bleeding was 
estimated to occur at a rate of 9.6% (95% CI: 4.1-17.1%) based on a systematic review of all prospective 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 158/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
ITP studies (10,908 patients) (Neunert 2015). A recent analysis of nearly 300,000 U.S. patient discharges 
recorded for adult ITP from 2006 to 2012 revealed that the prevalence of mortality was highest in association 
with septicemia and intracranial hemorrhage (An 2017). The number of hospital discharges for ITP was also 
found to increase by 30% during this 7 year span despite the introduction of new treatment options, 
including rituximab and TPO-RAs (An 2017), indicating challenges in achieving or maintaining sufficient 
platelet control in adult patients living with ITP. 
The estimated adult prevalence was 23.6 [95% CI 23.4 – 23.8] per 100,000 persons, translating to 
approximately 52,700 (95% CI 52,200 – 53,100) adult chronic ITP cases in the US (Feudjo-Tepie et al, 
2007).  
The Applicant was seeking the following indication: 
“Tavlesse is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic or persistent 
immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment.”  
Considering the assessment and the discussion on the dossier the Applicant has agreed to the following final 
indication:  
“Tavlesse is indicated for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients who are 
refractory to other treatments (see section 5.1)”. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
First-line treatment options for ITP include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and 
intravenous anti-D immunoglobulin (IV anti-D Ig). Many patients fail to achieve a durable remission, or will 
find the long-term side effects of corticosteroids unacceptable (George 2012). 
Available second-line treatment options for adult ITP patients can be broadly categorized into those that are 
given only once (or for only 1 course) and are intended to induce long-term remission (splenectomy, 
rituximab), and those that need continued or chronic administration (corticosteroids, immunosuppressive 
agents [azathioprine, cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil], and thrombopoietin (TPO)-
receptor agonists [romiplostim and eltrombopag]). 
Splenectomy provides long-term efficacy in approximately 60% of cases. Nonetheless, splenectomy is 
invasive, irreversible, associated with postoperative complications, and its effectiveness is currently 
unpredictable, leading many physicians and patients toward postponement and use of alternative 
approaches. 
There is an unmet medical need for primary ITP patients relapsing after steroids, splenectomy (if viable), 
rituximab, TPO-RAs, IVIG, and potentially dapsone and immunosuppresants (cyclosporine and 
mycophenolate mofetil).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical studies provided in the dossier are C788-047 and C788-048 (identical in design): Phase 3, 
Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Fostamatinib Disodium in the Treatment 
of Persistent/Chronic ITP:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 159/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Phase 3 studies C788-047 and C788 048 evaluated the efficacy of fostamatinib compared with placebo in the 
treatment of thrombocytopenia in subjects with persistent/chronic ITP over a period of 24 weeks. Starting at 
Week 12 in these studies, subjects with a platelet count < 50,000/µL (or, if the baseline platelet count was < 
15,000/µL, subjects whose platelet count had not increased from baseline by ≥ 20,000/µL), were allowed to 
transition to Study C788 049, in which all subjects received fostamatinib. Subjects who completed the 24-
week evaluation in Study C788 047 or C788 048 also had the option of subsequently receiving open-label 
fostamatinib in Study C788 049. Most of the subjects participating in the trials had chronic ITP (93%). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In study 047 the proportion of subjects achieving the primary efficacy endpoint of a stable platelet response 
by week 24 (defined as a platelet count of at least 50,000/μL on at least 4 of the last 6 scheduled visits 
between weeks 14 and 24 inclusive) was 15.7% (8/51) in the fostamatinib group and 0% (0/25) in the 
placebo group (p = 0.0471).  
In study 048 the proportion of subjects in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population achieving the primary efficacy 
endpoint of a stable platelet response was 18.0% (9/50) in the fostamatinib group and 4.2% (1/24) in the 
placebo group (p = 0.1519).  
The data from the two placebo-controlled studies was pooled: The estimated proportion of subjects achieving 
a stable platelet response was 16.8% (17/101) in the fostamatinib group and 2.1% in the placebo group 
(p = 0.0071). The studies had identical study design, but the mean age of the patients differed by 7.5 years, 
and thus the populations are not completely comparable.  
In the open-label extenstion study 049 the version 2 efficacy endpoint (Stable Platelet Response in Placebo 
Crossover Subjects) is supportive of the primary efficacy endpoint from the placebo-controlled studies: 10/44 
subjects (22.7%) achieved a stable platelet response including one subject who had achieved this endpoint 
during treatment with placebo in the prior study. The difference (fostamatinib – placebo) in the proportion 
responding was 20.5% (95% CI, normal approximation: 8.5%, 32.4%).  
The secondary efficacy endpoints of platelet count at week 12 and 24 for the entire population and for 
patients with at low baseline platelet count are considered supportive of the primary efficacy endpoint. The 
Applicant proposed a hierarchical testing to control for the type I error in the SAPs. However, this was not 
implemented and therefore it is concluded that the confidence intervals and p-values from the secondary 
endpoints are not meaningful.  
The number of responding patients is too low to conclude anything with regards to various subgroups. 
The applicant has also been requested to further indicate the population in which the B/R would be 
considered more appropriate and they have provided data in refractory patients who have received three or 
more prior ITP therapies.  For all platelet count parameters, the results for the total pooled population are 
comparable to the refractory patient population. On this ground the final indication agreed is: 
“TAVLESSE is indicated for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients who 
are refractory to other treatments (see section 5.1)”

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The percentage of responders in the double-blinded placebo-controlled studies 047 and 048 were 15.7% and 
18.0%, respectively. The 95 % CI in both studies are very wide and approach zero, meaning that the 
possibility of observing very few responders in clinical practice cannot be neglected.  
There is no support from clinically relevant endpoints such as prevention of bleeding or reduction of 
concomitant ITP treatment.  The EMA GL proposes to include bleeding signs/symptoms, time to response, 
duration of response, concomitant treatment reduction and need for rescue treatment as secondary 
endpoints. This is only sparsely covered by the submitted phase III trials. In case of bleeding other 
scores/scales were used than those recommended by the GL. Overall, the provided data do not allow clear 
conclusions regarding bleeding risk of included patients and of the effect of fostamatinib on the bleeding risk. 
Assessment of efficacy of fostamatinib is then based on the surrogate parameter platelet counts.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Adverse event analysis for Fostamatinib has been considered in the frame of the submitted ITP studies. 
Unfortunately, even though a follow up of patients has been performed in study C788-049, the long-term 
safety is not fully evaluable in this indication. For this reason pull of safety data from study conducted in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been considered. In general the safety profile evidenced in ITP population can 
be considered consistent to the one reported for the RA population. In specific, the adverse events of special 
interest in study 047 and 048 are in line with the previously described AESIs from the RA studies: 
gastrointestinal disorders (including gastrointestinal complaints, non-infectious diarrhoea, nausea and 
abdominal pain), hypertension, hepatic disorders, neutropenia, and infection. No new AESI was identified. 
The incidence of the various AESIs were generally higher in the ITP population. Dose reduction and dose 
interruption in ITP patients were generally in line with the known AESIs. The reported AESI are considered 
manageable and guidance has been given in the SmPC for the approach to their occurrence. 
The most common reported treatment related AE was diarrhoea (26.5% fostamatinib, 12.5% placebo) 
followed by nausea, hypertension, dizziness and ALT or AST increase. 
The very few occurred deaths in the safety profile have been considered unlikely related to the treatment. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In the ITP extension study 98 patients received fostamatinib ≥24 weeks (168 days) with a median of 204 
days (Table 2). Long-term safety is thus not evaluable in this indication. In the rheumatoid arthritis studies 
217 patients received fostamatinib 200-300 mg/day for ≥3 years with a median of 483 days for the entire 
cohort, but these patients usually have many co-morbidities making it difficult to evaluate long-term safety 
without a comparator/placebo, and the placebo-controlled period is less than 36 weeks. On this ground the 
Applicant will perform a Post Authorsiation Safety Sstudy (PASS) to evaluate the long-term safety.   
The outcome of preclinical studies raises significant concerns regarding changes of the skeletal system 
including modification of the growth plates, chondrodystrophy and/or hypocellularity of the bone marrow. 
Especially juvenile animals appear to be more sensitive to these changes. Data suggests that VEGF/VEGFR is 
involved in bone remodelling as well as bone formation (Wan et al., 2010; Clarkin and Gerstenfeld, 2012; Hu 
and Olsen, 2016) possibly inferring an adverse effect in  fostamatinib-treated patients with fractures in 
relation to regrowth, considering fractures being a relatively common event especially in the elderly 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654949/2019 
Page 161/166 
 
 
 
 
  
  
population. There may also be an issue in relation to osteoporosis (Liu et al, 2012; Senel et al, 2013) and in 
young adults where epiphyseal fusion has not yet completely occurred. The SmPC reports with a warning as 
to the possible detrimental effect on bone metabolism. Overall, these findings may be regarded as off-target 
effects of VEGF inhibiting medicinal products. By targeting as well a range of other TKIs including SYK, all of 
which are involved to some extent in the bone metabolism with either potentially deleterious or favourable 
effects, it is difficult to accurately estimate the risk that is related to bone metabolism, especially for long 
term administration in patients at risk (e.g. elderly, patients with concomitant steroid treatment, patients 
with osteoporosis/osteopenia, patients with fractures or young adults where epiphyseal fusion may not have 
entirely occurred), which were not specifically investigated in clinical studies. To address the above reported 
concerns and other long-term safety aspects of Tavlesse, a post authorisation safety study (PASS) has been 
agreed as described in the risk management plan (RMP).  
The antiangiogenic VEGFR inhibiting character of fostamatinib seems to be also responsible for several 
noteworthy findings in fertility, developmental and perinatal/postnatal reproduction studies in rats and 
rabbits. The preclinical toxicities comprise significantly reduced pregnancy rates, increased maternal 
toxicities, an increased number of nonviable embryos at higher doses, decreased uterine weights, growth 
retardation of the foetus as well as variations and malformations of the offspring. Juvenile rabbits displayed 
degenerate and necrotic ovarian follicles at all dose levels.  In light of the embryo-fetal effects of 
fostamatinib, fostamtinib is contraindicated in pregnancy and effective contraception during treatment and at 
least one month after the last dose must be used. Fostamatinib has to be discontinued in case the patient 
becomes pregnant.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There is an unmet medical need for efficacious treatments in relapsed primary ITP. Fostamatinib could 
therefore be an interesting treatment, although the results are not as encouraging as the Applicant had 
anticipated expecting an efficacy of 40% for the primary endpoint of a platelet count of at least 50,000/μL on 
at least 4 of the last 6 scheduled visits between Weeks 14 and 24: The percentage of responders in the 
double-blinded placebo-controlled studies 047 and 048 were 15.7 % and 18.0%, respectively. The 95 % CI in 
both studies are very wide and approach zero, meaning that the possibility of observing very few responders 
in clinical practice cannot be neglected.  
The comparator is placebo, making it difficult to evaluate fostamatinib’s position in the line of possible 
treatments also given the high efficacy of TPO-RAs and other suggested treatments (GL). The median 
number of unique prior therapies was 3 in both studies in the fostamatinib arms and 5 and 4 for all ITP 
therapies in study 047 and 048, respectively, excluding splenectomy, which had been performed in 39% and

28% of the patients, respectively (adding another ITP treatment for these patients) thus precluding the use 
of fostamatinib as second-line treatment when also taking into account the low efficacy.  
The short-term adverse events are generally manageable and generally not severe/serious. The long-term 
effect in ITP patients is poorly investigated given the fact that this is a continuous treatment. In this regards 
a PASS study evaluating long term safety has been agreed by the applicant. Given the effect on bone growth 
in laboratory animal considered to be caused by the off-target effect on VEGF/VEGFR there is a concern that 
there could be a detrimental effect on the regrowth on fractures, which are fairly frequent in the elderly, as 
well as a possible adverse effect on osteoporosis, which is already a risk in this population given the frequent 
use of corticosteroids. Contraindication for the use during pregnancy and lactation and in children < 18 years 
of age has been clearly stated in the SmPC as well as bone related issues such as the risk in growing adults > 
18 years, who have not yet reached skeletal maturity, and precautions in relation to fractures and the 
potential risk of osteoporosis. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy of Fostamatinib has been shown in a refractory patient population, where there is a high unmet 
medical need. In these patients who have exhausted several treatment options, even a relatively modest 
effect size is considered clinically relevant. The non-negligible safety profile is manageable with dose 
reduction and appropriate precaution measures are reflected in the SmPC. Furthermore, treatment 
discontinuation is recommended for patients who do not respond to treatment in terms of platelet counts 
within 12 weeks.  
The benefit-risk balance is therefore considered positive in the target population of adult patients refractory 
to other treatments as represented by the above mentioned indication. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In conclusion, taking into consideration the refractory population benefiting from the treatment as per the 
submitted data and the manageable safety profile, the final agreed indication is the following:   
 “Fostamatinib is indicated for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients who 
are refractory to other treatments (see section 5.1)”,  
Reference to section 5.1 is included in section 4.1 to guide prescriber to a deeper understanding of the 
clinical setting in which the product has been studied in particular in reference to previous treatments used 
on the patient population. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Tavlesse is positive.

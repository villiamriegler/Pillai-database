Withdrawal of the marketing authorisation in the European Union 
On 18 October 2023, the European Commission withdrew the marketing authorisation for Ivozall 
(clofarabine) in the European Union (EU). The withdrawal was at the request of the marketing 
authorisation holder, ORPHELIA Pharma SAS, which notified the European Commission of its decision 
to permanently discontinue the marketing of the product for commercial reasons.  
Ivozall was granted marketing authorisation in the EU on 14 November 2019 for treatment of acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia. The marketing authorisation was initially valid for a 5-year period. The 
product had not been marketed in the EU since 2022. 
Ivozall is a generic medicine of Evoltra. There are other generic medicinal products of Evoltra 
authorised and marketed in the EU. 
The European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) for Ivozall will be updated to indicate that the 
marketing authorisation is no longer valid.

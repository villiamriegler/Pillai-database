Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for tacrolimus (topical formulations), 
the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
A study investigating long-term safety of topical calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of patients 
with atopic blepharoconjunctivitis was published during this reporting period. The study reported 
herpes simplex ophthalmic infection in eighteen patients. This is in addition to the cases contained 
in the marketing authorisation holder safety database, along with the known safety profile of topical 
tacrolimus. Given the previous signal evaluation of this issue and the known safety profile of 
tacrolimus, it is considered that this study provides additional evidence of an association of 
ophthalmic herpes infection with topical tacrolimus treatment, particularly when it is applied near 
the eyes. In view of the above, it is considered that ophthalmic herpes infection should be reflected 
as an adverse reaction with frequency unknown in the product information of Protopic. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding Protopic, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tacrolimus (topical formulations) the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing tacrolimus (topical 
formulations) is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

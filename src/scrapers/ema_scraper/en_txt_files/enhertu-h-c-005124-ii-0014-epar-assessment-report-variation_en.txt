Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide (11.7% of all cancer sites) 
and the leading cause of cancer death in women (6.9% of all cancer sites in 2020) (1).  In 2020, there 
was an estimated 2.26 million new cases of female BC globally, with an estimated 684,996 deaths due 
to BC (1).  Along with cancer staging, the determination of biologic markers status (estrogen receptor, 
progesterone receptor, and HER2) at the time of diagnosis is common medical practice, assisting in the 
evaluation of the risk of recurrence and predicting response to therapy (2,3).   
Approximately 20% of patients with BC have HER2-positive tumours (ie, tumours scored as 3+ by 
immunohistochemistry [IHC] or that demonstrate gene amplification by in situ hybridization [ISH]) 
(4,5). Although treatment with anti HER2-targeted therapies has improved the disease outcomes, 
these are not curative in the locally advanced/metastatic setting and the disease invariably progresses. 
Management 
The current standard of care (SoC) for newly diagnosed metastatic HER2-positive BC in Europe (3), 
based on the results of the CLEOPATRA (6,7) study, is a combination of a taxane with trastuzumab, 
and the anti-HER2 pertuzumab (8,9) (THP regimen).  In CLEOPATRA, newly diagnosed patients with 
HER2-positive metastatic BC were randomized to receive trastuzumab plus docetaxel with or without 
the addition of pertuzumab as first-line therapy, which improved the median PFS from 12.4 months to 
18.5 months and the median OS from 40.8 months (95%CI: 35.8, 48.3) to 56.5 months (95%CI: 
49.3, not reached) (Table 1.1).   
After disease progression on the THP regimen, the current SoC in the second-line metastatic setting, 
based on the results of the EMILIA (10) study, is the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) trastuzumab 
emtansine (T-DM1, (11,12)) as a single-agent.  In EMILIA, T-DM1 was compared with combined 
therapy with lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients whose cancer had progressed after treatment with 
the trastuzumab plus taxane combination.  Treatment with T-DM1 improved the disease outcomes 
compared with treatment with lapatinib plus capecitabine, with an ORR by independent central review 
(ICR) of 43.6% (95%CI: 38.6, 48.6) in the T-DM1 arm versus (vs.) 30.8% (95%CI: 26.3, 35.7) in the 
lapatinib plus capecitabine arm; a median PFS of 9.6 months vs. 6.4 months (HR 0.65 [95%CI: 0.55, 
0.77), respectively; and a median OS of 30.9 months vs. 25.1 months (HR 0.68 [95%CI: 0.55, 0.85]), 
respectively (Table 1.1).   
It should be noted that the EMILIA study was conducted before the pertuzumab-based combination 
was SoC in first-line therapy.  Although the mechanism remains unclear, response rates to T-DM1 
appear to be lower (13,14) and disease outcomes appear to be shorter (15,16) than those reported in 
the EMILIA study, when T-DM1 is given after pertuzumab-containing regimens. Hence, in the KATE2 
study (15) comparing T-DM1 plus atezolizumab vs. T-DM1 plus placebo in previously treated patients 
with advanced HER2-positive BC, the median PFS was 6.8 months (95%CI: 4.0, 11.1) for patients in 
the T-DM1 plus placebo arm. These findings were consistent with those from retrospective, real-world 
evidence observational studies of the efficacy of T-DM1 showing a median PFS of 6 to 7 months for 
pre-treated patients with HER2-positive BC (16,17,18).  
Other treatment options in the second-line setting include the kinase inhibitor tucatinib (19) in 
combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine, which was approved on the basis of the results from 
the HER2CLIMB study (20) in patients, who have received at least 2 prior anti-HER2 regimens. In the 
EU tucatinib is approved for third-line treatment and in the US for second-line treatment. In 
HER2CLIMB, patients previously treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1, were randomized 
to receive trastuzumab plus capecitabine with or without tucatinib. The addition of tucatinib to the 
Assessment report

Page 9/148 
 
 
 
trastuzumab plus capecitabine combination improved median PFS from 5.6 months (95%CI: 4.2, 7.1) 
to 7.8 months (95%CI: 7.5, 9.6) (HR: 0.54 [95 CI: 0.42, 0.71]) and median OS from 17.4 months 
(95%CI: 13.6, 19.9) to 21.9 months (95%CI: 18.3, 31.0) (HR: 0.66 [95%CI: 0.50, 0.88], Table 1.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636117/2022  
Page 10/148 
 
 
 
 
 
The limited duration of efficacy of the current SoC, T-DM1, in the second-line metastatic setting 
represents an unmet medical need, which might be addressed by newer agents that provide longer 
PFS. In that context, the mechanism of action of T-DXd is biologically relevant regardless of the 
sequence of prior anti-HER2 therapies and, therefore, meaningful clinical activity from T-DXd is 
expected in patients with heterogenous anti-HER2 treatment history. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
T-DXd is a humanized HER2-targeted antibody and topoisomerase I inhibitor conjugate. The anti-HER2 
component (monoclonal antibody [mAb]) has the same amino acid sequence as trastuzumab and is 
specifically targeted to HER2-expressing cells. The released drug DXd is a topoisomerase I inhibitor 
derivative of exatecan that is approximately 10 times more potent than the inhibitor SN-38, the active 
metabolite of irinotecan (27). DXd is cell-membrane permeable, giving the ability to penetrate and act 
in surrounding cells (28). The mAb is covalently conjugated to a drug-linker, deruxtecan, that is 
composed of a cleavable maleimide tetrapeptide linker and the released drug DXd (27,29,30). The 
tetrapeptide linker is designed to be stable in plasma to reduce systemic exposure to DXd (27,31).  
T-DXd binds specifically to and is internalized by HER2-expressing cells, after which the linker is 
cleaved by lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsins B and L, which are overexpressed in cancer cells. 
The drug DXd is then released and exerts cytotoxic activity by inhibiting the activity of

EMA/CHMP/636117/2022  
Page 11/148 
 
 
 
 
topoisomerase I, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis of the target tumour cells. The 
released drug DXd has, by design, a short systemic half-life, and its active chemical moiety in the 
lactone form is present and active in the acidic tumoural environment, whereas the chemical moiety in 
the hydroxyl-acid form present in the neutral systemic environment is mostly inactive. As a result of 
drug-linker design and site-specific conjugation, the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) for T-DXd is 
approximately 8 compared with a DAR of 3 to 4 for other ADCs such as T-DM1 (27). 
Enhertu was initially authorised on 18 January 2021 as monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more 
prior anti-HER2-based regimens. The recommended dose is 5.4 mg/kg given as an intravenous 
infusion once every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
In January 2018, scientific advice was given by the CHMP for trastuzumab deruxtecan 
(EMEA/H/SA/3714/1/2017/HTA/II). Part of the scientific advice discussed Study DS8201-A-U302 
(DESTINY-Breast03; hereinafter referred to as Study U302), a randomized, active controlled Phase 3 
study in which the target population are patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive BC 
who had received a prior anti-HER2-based regimen received T-DXd at the target dose of 5.4 mg/kg or 
T-DM1, the SoC in the second-line metastatic setting. This is the pivotal study in the current 
application. 
The patient population, primary endpoint, and the use of QoL questionnaires were discussed: 
Patient population - The CHMP noted that the proposed trial mimics the study conducted with 
trastuzumab emtansine (i.e. TDM4370g/BO21977) in which patients with HER2-positive unresectable 
locally advanced breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer who had received prior taxane and 
trastuzumab-based therapy, including patients who received prior therapy with trastuzumab and a 
taxane in the adjuvant setting and who relapsed during or within six months of completing adjuvant 
therapy, were included. The proposed “replication” approach appears reasonable from a regulatory 
point of view but it may include a patient population not fully in line with that seen in clinical practice 
at the time of the running of the trial. It was, therefore, advised to include patients pretreated with 
pertuzumab + trastuzumab in the trial. 
Stratification by ER status was recommended since patients may receive different therapeutic options 
upon subsequent progression that could influence their outcome e.g. in terms of OS. 
Primary endpoint - The proposal to use PFS by  BICRas primary endpoint was deemed acceptable in 
this setting. However, even if OS is not formally required as an additional primary endpoint, at the 
time of assessment, it would be required that available data are reassuring with respect to any 
potential detrimental effect on OS. The Applicant was encouraged to make an estimation of how many 
OS events are expected to have occurred at the time of the planned PFS final analysis and how mature 
OS data would be at that stage. Powering the study for OS, even if PFS is the primary endpoint, was 
highly recommended. Following patients beyond progression was also strongly encouraged. 
When using PFS as a primary endpoint, the treatment effect on PFS would need to be large to allow 
confidence in the clinical benefit of DS-8201a. The proposed secondary endpoints were considered 
acceptable. Any reported contradictory findings in terms of secondary endpoint would raise concerns 
regarding potential approval based on PFS. 
QoL data - The use of PROs is always recommended in order to capture patients’ quality of life, even if 
the open label nature of the proposed trials could potentially limit the value of the reported evidence.

EMA/CHMP/636117/2022  
Page 12/148 
 
 
 
As to the inclusion of such data in the SmPC, this would depend on the final results and their reliability. 
In this context, it would be important that e.g. the completion rate of the questionnaires is sufficiently 
high. In addition, pre-specifying a statistical analysis plan and type I error control was recommended. 
In general, the scientific advice was followed by the MAH and is discussed in further detail in the 
clinical efficacy discussion. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
This application concerns a change in the indication from third line to second line treatment of Her-2 
positive breast cancer. An updated environmental risk assessment was submitted to include and 
discuss the impact of the change from third to second line indication. As the ERA from the initial 
Market Authorisation was not considering the third line classification of the indication of Enhertu, i.e. 
worst-case scenarios for environmental exposure was used based on HER2-positive breast cancers 
irrespective of line of treatment, the conclusion from the initial ERA still holds (see EPAR for Enhertu). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community

The current application is seeking marketing approval for the use of T-DXd monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have 
received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens. The currently approved and recommended T-
DXd dosing regimens for breast cancer is 5.4 mg/kg as an intravenous (IV) infusion once every 3 
weeks (Q3W). 
The clinical pharmacology profile of T-DXd has been characterized previously in the initial T-DXd 
marketing application in BC. The clinical pharmacology package for the initial BC application included 
five studies (Studies J101, J102, A103, A104, and U201). The package included in the current 
application also includes data from the four additional studies listed below.  
•  Two Phase 2 studies in subjects with HER2-positive advanced GC or gastroesophageal 
junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma (Studies J202 and U205) 
•  A Phase 2 study in subjects with metastatic HER2-mutant or HER2-overexpressing NSCLC 
(Study U204) 
•  A Phase 3 study in subjects with HER2-positive BC (Study U302).  
Data from these nine studies were used in the PopPK and exposure-response (E-R) analyses. 
Study U302 was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-arm, active-controlled study 
conducted in subjects with unresectable and/or metastatic HER2-positive BC previously treated with 
trastuzumab and a taxane in North America, Brazil, Asia, Europe, and Australia with a planned number 
of approximately 500 subjects. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg (261 
subjects) or trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) (263 subjects). Serum concentrations of T-DXd, total 
anti-HER2 antibody, and DXd were evaluated and used for the PopPK and E-R analyses. Due to sparse 
PK sampling in the study, NCA was not conducted for Study U302. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636117/2022

Analytical methods 
For characterization of T-DXd pharmacokinetics, three analytes were measured: T-DXd (the intact 
antibody-drug conjugate [ADC]), total anti-HER2 antibody, and DXd (the drug component of the ADC). 
Quantification of the three analytes in serum and determination of anti-T-DXd antibodies in serum 
were conducted using the same validated bioanalytical methods that were used in the initial BC 
application, with the exception of samples from subjects enrolled in study U302. 
New assay measuring concentrations of intact T-DXd or total-HER2 antibody in human serum, using 
electrochemiluminescent methods, were developed and validated. The assays were cross-validated 
against the assay developed and both methods were determined to be comparable. T-DXd and total 
anti-HER2 antibody were analysed over the nominal concentration range of 0.400 to 25.6 μg/mL (with 
a 0.200 μg/mL anchor point standard). A LC-MS/MS assay measuring DXd was developed and 
validated and cross-validated against the DXd assay. The methods were comparable. DXd was 
analysed over the nominal concentration range of 10.0 to 2000 pg/mL. 
An assay to detect and confirm ADA antibodies in human serum using an ECL method in a multi-tiered 
approach was developed and validated. The screening assay cut point for breast cancer individuals was 
determined statistically at the 95% upper prediction interval from 7 independent analyses of 25 drug-
naïve breast cancer serum sample lots. 
A cell-based assay to detect NAb against T-DXd in human serum was developed and validated. Study 
samples confirmed as ADA positive were further analysed by the NAb assay. The assay cut point for 
breast cancer human serum was determined statistically at the 99% upper bound prediction interval 
from six independent analyses of 30 individual drug-naïve breast cancer serum sample lots. 
Population PK analyses 
NONMEM (version 7.4.3) was used for PopPK analysis with FOCEI for model development. PsN was 
used for model diagnostics and covariate testing. R (version 4.0.4 or higher) was used for data 
exploration and simulations based on the final models for T-DXd and DXd. 
Integrated data across Studies J101, J102, A103, A104, U201, J202, U204, U205, and U302 were used 
as the analysis data set and included 1313 subjects for evaluating T-DXd at doses ranging from 0.8 
mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg. Of these 1313 subjects, 766 had BC, 293 had GC, 199 had NSCLC, and 55 had 
other cancer types. There were 19584 and 19683 PK samples for serum T-DXd concentrations and 
serum DXd concentrations, respectively, included in the dataset. Outlier concentrations in Study U302 
were identified using |CWRES|>5. A total of 2962 T-DXd and 2968 DXd PK-evaluable samples were 
available from 254 subjects in Study U302. The PK profile of total anti-HER2 antibody was not included 
in the analysis because of similarity to the PK profile of T-DXd.

In the previous PopPK analysis, T-DXd PK was described by a two-compartment model with linear 
clearance. The production of DXd was modeled by a two-component time-varying release rate from T-
DXd. The previous PopPK model for T-DXd and DXd included data from all studies except for Study 
U302. The previous model was used as the basic structure where a sequential modeling approach was 
used to re-estimate model parameters with the updated analysis dataset. The final model included pre-
specified covariates from the previous model were initially fit to the updated PK dataset. This step was 
conducted sequentially with the T-DXd parameters and corresponding covariate effects re-estimated 
using T-DXd PK data only. Then, using the T-DXd and DXd PK data, the DXd parameters and 
corresponding covariate effects were re-estimated, with fixed parameter estimates for PK and 
covariates for T-DXd, including fixed and random-effects terms. Any covariates that were not 
statistically significant were removed.  
Re-running the previous final T-DXd model with the current dataset showed that parameters describing 
the effects of sex on V1,T-DXd, and Asian from Japan on V2,T-DXd changed by >20% relative to the 
previous estimates. Removal of these parameters increased the OFV significantly. The sex effect on 
V1,T-DXd and Asian from Japan effect on V2,T-DXd were therefore retained in the T-DXd model. Sex 
and CrCL on CLT-DXd, and country on V1,TDXd showed significant trends (p<0.01). However, several 
covariates were correlated, thus cancer type and body weight on CLT-DXd were retained while sex and 
CrCL were not tested as covariates. None of the candidate covariates were added to the base model, 
and the T-DXd base model was accepted as the final model (run413). The final T-DXd model suggests 
that CLT-DXd increases with increasing body weight, baseline tumour size, and for GC, NSCLC or other 
cancers; CLT-DXd decreases with increasing albumin and being Asian from Japan; V1,T-DXd increases 
with increasing body weight, in males and for GC; and V2,T-DXd decreases in Asian subjects from 
Japan. The previously developed DXd PopPK model with T-DXd parameters fixed (estimates from 
run413) was fit to the current dataset with inclusion of Study U302. The covariate effects of AST and 
cancer type on CLDXd, and age, formulation, NSCLC or other cancers on VDXd changed by more than 
20%. Further exploratory analysis identified that other cancer types on CLDXd and VDXd effects were 
no longer supported by the data and were removed. The DXd base model (run649) was a one-
compartment model with a 2-component, time-varying release rate from T-DXd. The components of 
the decrease in Krel over time were a constant reduction in Krel after Cycle 1 (FPC1) and a gradual 
decline in Krel per cycle (FPC2). The model included proportional RUV and exponential BSV on CLDXd, 
VDXd, Krel, and FPC1. With the addition of Study U302, new covariate correlations were identified and 
no new covariates were included. The DXd base model was accepted as the final model (run649). The 
final DXd model suggests that CLDXd increases with increasing body weight; CLDXd decreases with

increasing total bilirubin and AST, co-administration of itraconazole or ritonavir, and having GC or 
NSCLC; VDXd increases with increasing BSA, age, and FL-DP2 formulation; VDXd decreases with FL-
DP1 formulation, having NSCLC and in non-Asians. The structural model for T-DXd and DXd PK is 
shown in Figure 3.1. 
Between-subject variance terms were included on CLT-DXd, distributional clearance of T-DXd, V1,T-
DXd, and V2,T-DXd. In addition, the model included a correlated variance structure on CLT-DXd and 
V1,T-DXd. Residual unexplained variability was described using a combined additive plus proportional 
model on T-DXd and proportional only on DXd. The final parameter estimates for T-DXd and DXd are 
shown in tables 4.6 and 4.8.

Exposure-response analyses 
Exposure-efficacy relationships for PFS, OS and ORR were investigated in Study U302 BC subjects. A 
total of 249 HER2 positive BC subjects were included in the exposure-efficacy evaluation. Exposure-
safety relationships were evaluated in the nine T-DXd studies including Study U302 which were 
included in the Pop PK analysis, with focus on BC subjects. The safety endpoints were: discontinuation 
associated with AE, dose reduction associated with AE, Grade ≥3 AE, SERAEs, Grade ≥3 anaemia, Any 
Grade and Grade ≥3 neutropenia, Any Grade and Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, Any Grade and Grade 
≥3 ILD, Grade ≥2 LVEF (ECHO). 
First exploratory plots were used to assess the ER relationship. For binary variables, the data were split 
by exposure quartiles and the response probability was plotted vs. median exposure for each quartile. 
For time-to-event variables, Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted by exposure quartile. If an ER 
relationship was observed using logistic regression (p<0.05 on slope) or using Cox regression 
(p<0.05), further modelling was considered. Most endpoints were treated as binary variables and 
analysed with logistic regression, with exception of PFS and OS, which were treated as time-to-event 
variables. ILD AEs were treated as both a binary and time-to-event variable. Covariates analysis was 
performed using a forward search at p<0.05 and a backward search at p<0.01 using a likelihood ratio 
test. All covariates were tested on both the intercept and the slope of the ER relationship. The selected 
ER models were evaluated graphically by overlaying model predictions with observed response data 
(Kaplan-Meier) and by numerical predictive checks. 90% CIs were computed using 1000 sampled ER 
models. 
Efficacy models 
T-DXd Cmin1 was the selected metric for PFS and OS based on univariate Cox regression. T-DXd 
Cmin1 was the only or the most significant metric (p<0.05) with a negative slope, corresponding to 
decreasing PFS or OS hazard with increasing exposures. A significant difference (p<0.05) was found 
between ORR and all T-DXd exposure metrics, however, the p-value of the slope was most significant 
for AUC1. No exposure relationship was found between ORR and DXd exposure metrics.

A summary of exposure-safety models is shown in Table 5-76. Overall, the NPCs suggest the models 
concurs with the observed data. 
Final models with diagnostics for a few safety-endpoints that fitted the observed data for breast cancer 
less well (observed not within the model estimated 90%PI) are displayed in the following:

ADME characteristics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics of T-DXd are well-characterized 
based on a series of nonclinical studies using human biomaterials as described in the initial BC 
application, and based on data from clinical Studies J101, J102, A103, A104, and U201. Serum 
concentrations of three analytes (T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody, and DXd) were measured in the 
clinical studies to characterize the PK of T-DXd. 
Covariate effects on DXd (the cytotoxic moiety) pharmacokinetics 
The effect of each covariate included in the final model, including the new study U302, on the Cmin,ss, 
Cmax,ss, and AUCss of DXd after administration of T-DXd at 5.4 mg/kg Q3W was evaluated by forest 
plots (Figure 3.6). Renal function, measured by creatinine clearance, was not a significant covariate in 
the PopPK analysis for DXd; however, hepatic function measures (AST and total bilirubin) were 
significant covariates in the PopPK analysis for DXd. The forest plots show the effects of different 
values of the covariates for a typical subject, defined in the PopPK analysis as an Asian subject with BC 
who was administered T-DXd lyophilized powder drug product (Lyo-DP) and who weighed 58 kg with 
median lab values of AST 28 U/L and total bilirubin 7.4 μmol/L. 
The majority of the covariates (baseline AST, baseline bilirubin, race-country, and cancer type) had 
effects contained within the 0.8 to 1.25 exposure ratio. Subjects with extreme values of body weight 
(90 kg; 95th percentile) had an approximately 30% higher Cmax,ss and a 32% higher AUCss, 
respectively, relative to a typical subject with a body weight of 58 kg. This covariate effect on steady-
state exposures was only marginally outside the 0.8 to 1.25 exposure ratio interval.

The exposure to DXd at steady state after administration of T-DXd at 5.4 mg/kg Q3W in subjects with 
BC in each region (Asia, North America, Europe, and ROW) (based on posthoc individual estimates) is 
shown in Figure 3.7. The exposure in subjects with BC was similar between Asia, North America, 
Europe, and ROW. The geometric mean ratios of the AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss in subjects with BC 
in North America, Europe, or ROW to those in subjects with BC in Asia were in the range of 0.794 to 
1.08.

The exposure to DXd at steady state after administration of DXd at 5.4 mg/kg Q3W in all subjects with 
BC by line of therapy (based on posthoc individual estimates) is shown in Figure 3.9. The exposure in 
subjects with BC was similar between second and third line of therapy. The geometric mean ratios of 
the AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss in subjects with second-line BC to those in subjects with third-line 
BC were in the range of 0.987 to 1.06. 
The DXd exposures were compared based on renal or hepatic impairment status for subjects with BC. 
The exposure to DXd was similar in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment compared to subjects 
without renal or hepatic impairment.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted 
antibody linked to topoisomerase I inhibitor molecules (ADC molecule). DXd acts as a cytotoxic 
payload. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Study U302 
Exposure-efficacy analysis 
Data from subjects with HER2-positive BC from Study U302 were used as a data set for the E-R 
analyses for efficacy. A total of 249 subjects were included. The efficacy endpoints were PFS, OS, and 
cORR as determined by BICR. The exposure indicators investigated were the AUC, Cmax, and Cmin of 
T-DXd and DXd in Cycle 1 and at steady state and Cavg during the period up to the development of a 
respective efficacy event. 
Progression free survival (PFS) 
In the analysis of U302, a significant E-R relationship was found between PFS and increasing T-DXd 
exposures (Cmin at Cycle 1) based on Kaplan-Meier curves. Figure 3.10 shows the exploratory 
Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS stratified by the interquartile ranges of Cmin at Cycle 1 of T-DXd. The 
effect of each covariate on PFS as predicted from the E-R relationships is shown in the forest plot of 
Figure 3.11. PFS was statistically significantly longer in subjects with higher T-DXd Cmin at Cycle 1 (P 
= 0.039). However, these Kaplan-Meier curves have some degree of overlap with crossing lines. The 
exposure-response shows a shallow trend of relationship; differences in Day 360 PFS probability at the 
5th and 95th percentiles of exposure vs. the median exposure were <7%. There were no significant 
relationships between increasing DXd exposures and PFS.

Overall survival (OS) 
A significant E-R relationship was also found between OS and increasing T-DXd exposures (Cmin at 
Cycle 1) based on Kaplan-Meier curves. Figure 3.12 shows an exploratory Kaplan-Meier curve for OS 
stratified by the interquartile ranges of Cmin of T-DXd at Cycle 1. The effect of each covariate on OS as 
predicted from the E-R relationships is shown in the forest plot of Figure 3.13. However, OS data are 
immature and these Kaplan-Meier curves have some degree of overlap with crossing lines. There were 
no significant relationships between increasing DXd exposures and OS.

Confirmed ORR (cORR) 
The analysis of cORR confirmed by BICR using univariate logistic regression is shown in Figure 3.14. 
The effect of covariates on cORR, as predicted from the E-R relationships, is shown in the forest plot in 
Figure 3.15. cORR was statistically significantly higher in subjects with higher T-DXd AUC at Cycle 1 
(P = 0.00637). However, the differences in cORR at the 5th and 95th exposure percentiles of exposure 
metrics vs. the median exposure were <9% and the CIs of the cORR probability overlap across 
different percentiles; in addition, more than half of the patients in the lowest exposure quartiles have 
ECOG PS values ≥1.

Exposure-safety analysis 
An integrated dataset across nine clinical studies (J101, J102, A103, A104, U201, J202, U204, U205, 
and U302) including subjects with GC, BC, NSCLC (HER2-mutant and HER2-overexpressing), and other 
tumours was used in the E-R analyses for key safety endpoints. This analysis is an updated E-R 
analysis which added Study U302 to 1059 solid tumour patients from eight other studies and included 
512 BC subjects. 
The E-R analyses for safety were conducted using an integrated dataset across nine studies (J101, 
J102, A103, A104, U201, J202, U204, U205, and U302) using the following safety endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) associated with discontinuation of study drug 
administration 
TEAEs associated with dose reduction of study drug 
TEAEs associated with interruption of study drug administration 
•  Grade ≥3 TEAEs 
•  Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
•  Any grade and Grade ≥3 (laboratory-defined) anemia, neutrophil count decreased, platelet 
count decreased

•  Grade ≥2 left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased 
•  Any grade and Grade ≥3 drug-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) that was adjudicated by 
the independent ILD adjudication committee. 
E-R analyses for the safety endpoints listed below were performed by logistic regression. In addition, 
an E-R analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model was performed for any grade and Grade ≥3 
drug-related ILD adjudicated by the independent ILD adjudication committee. 
The exposure indicators investigated were Cavg in addition to the AUC, Cmax, and Cmin of T-DXd and 
DXd for Cycle 1 and at steady state. 
The analysis showed a statistically significant exposure-safety relationship with at least one exposure 
metric for all evaluated safety endpoints. The most significant exposure indicators were used in the 
final model. For all safety endpoints, the exposure indicators selected for the final model were the 
same as the exposure indicators for the E-R analyses for the initial BC application. 
Results 
E-R safety relationships observed in the current analysis update were consistent with previous ER 
analyses. T-DXd AUCss was correlated with discontinuation associated with TEAE (P = 1.1 × 10-6); T-
DXd Cmax,ss was correlated with Grade ≥2 LVEF decrease (P = 2.27 × 10-5); and DXd Cavg to the 
event time was correlated with dose reduction associated with TEAE (P = 5.7 × 10-25), Grade ≥3 
TEAEs (P = 8.48 × 10-34), SAEs (P = 1.98 × 10-23), hematologic TEAEs (Grade ≥3 anemia [P = 2.3 
× 10-22], any grade neutrophil count decreased [P = 4.33 × 10-29]; Grade ≥3 neutrophil count 
decreased [P = 5.72 × 10-28]; any grade platelet count decreased [P = 3.43 × 10-44], Grade ≥3 
platelet count decreased [P = 4.81 × 10-21]).

The exposure in non-Japanese (non-Japanese Asians and non-Asians) was estimated to be similar to 
the exposure in Japanese subjects based on the PopPK analysis; however, the results of the E-R 
analyses for safety showed that the final logistic regression model included race-country as a covariate 
for TEAEs associated with discontinuation of study drug administration, any SAE, hematologic TEAEs, 
and LVEF decrease. The incidence rate of these TEAEs after administration of 5.4 mg/kg dose in 
subjects with BC as predicted using the final model were compared across race-country, region, and 
line of therapy (Table 3.8). With respect to all TEAEs, the incidence rate tended to be similar between 
second- and third-line therapy, and between North American and European subjects.

DXd Cmax,ss for Grade ≥3). There was a statistically significant relationship between the exposure to 
T-DXd (AUCss) and the incidence rate of ILD (any grade) (P < 0.001) and between the exposure to T-
DXd (Cmax,ss) and the incidence rate of ILD (Grade ≥3) (P = 0.002). The incidence rate of ILD (any 
grade and Grade ≥3) tended to be higher in subjects with higher exposure.

The incidence rate of ILD (any grade and Grade ≥3) at Day 90, Day 180, and Day 360 after the 
administration of T-DXd at 5.4 mg/kg Q3W in subjects with BC was predicted based on the final model 
(Table 3.9). Any grade ILD rates at Day 360 were approximately 15% in non-Asians, 9% in non-
Japan Asians, and 24% in Asian-Japan subjects. Nevertheless Grade ≥3 ILD rates were comparable 
across race-country category and less than 5% at Day 360.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The current application is to seek marketing approval for the use of T-DXd monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have 
received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens. The currently approved and recommended T-
DXd dosing regimens for breast cancer is 5.4 mg/kg as an intravenous (IV) infusion once every 3 
weeks (Q3W). 
The clinical pharmacology profile of T-DXd has been characterized previously in the initial T-DXd 
marketing application in BC (see Enhertu EPAR). The clinical pharmacology package for the initial BC 
application included five studies (Studies J101, J102, A103, A104, and U201). The package included in 
the current application also includes data from four additional studies: Two Phase 2 studies in subjects 
with HER2-positive advanced GC or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma (Studies J202 
and U205), a Phase 2 study in subjects with metastatic HER2-mutant or HER2-overexpressing NSCLC 
(Study U204), and a Phase 3 study in subjects with HER2-positive BC (Study U302). Data from these 
nine studies were used in the PopPK and exposure-response (E-R) analyses. In study U302, subjects 
were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg (261 subjects) or trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) 
(263 subjects). Serum concentrations of T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody, and DXd were evaluated and

used for the PopPK and E-R analyses. Due to sparse PK sampling in the study, NCA was not conducted 
for Study U302. 
The bioanalytical methods used for quantification of T-DXd (intact drug), total anti-HER2 antibody 
(mAb), DXd (released drug) and anti-T-DXd antibodies in serum were conducted using the same 
methods that were used in the initial BC application. Five new validation reports were submitted with 
this variation that covered the methods used for bioanalysis conducted in Chinese study U302. The 
results for DXd obtained at Covance Shanghai for cross-validation QC samples and some bioanalytical 
reports could not be located. The Applicant was recommended to provide the final bioanalytical reports 
for study U302 post-authorisation once they are available (PAM-REC). 
A previous model developed for T-DXd PK was sequentially added additional data from patients with 
breast cancer from study U302 (2962 T-DXd and 2968 DXd samples available from 254 BC patients) 
with re-estimation of parameters. T-DXd PK could be described by a two-compartment model with 
linear clearance. The production of DXd was modelled by a two-component time-varying release rate 
from T-DXd. No new covariates were included based on the additional BC data. Parameter estimates of 
the updated models were compared to the parameters estimates of the previous models for T-DXd and 
DXd. In general, the additional BC data from U302 improved the precision of model parameters and 
the parameter estimates were largely comparable across models. 
The ADME characteristics of T-DXd are well known. Based on the new popPK modelling with U302 data 
included, minor and acceptable updates of some PK values have been made in section 5.2 of the 
SmPC.  
The Applicant has provided new analyses on covariates of exposure where the results of study U302 
are included. The majority of the covariates had effects contained within the 0.8 to 1.25 exposure 
ratio. High body weight results in slightly higher exposure. None of the estimated values are 
considered to have a clinically meaningful impact on DXd PK. 
The exposure in subjects with BC was similar between second and third line of therapy. The geometric 
mean ratios of the AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss in subjects with second-line BC to those in subjects 
with third-line BC were in the range of 0.987 to 1.06. 
No new information regarding drug interaction potential has been provided in the present application. 
As regards the PKPD effects in study U302, there is a clear relationship between the cycle 1 trough 
exposure estimates of T-DXd and the probability of PFS. The probability of PFS, however, was only +/- 
7% for the 5th and the 95th percentiles compared with the median exposure. In the KM plot based on 
exposure quartiles, a statistically significant relationship was found with Q1 and Q2 consistently below 
Q3 and Q4. There were no significant relationships between increasing DXd exposures and PFS. A 
significant relationship between cycle 1 T-DXd exposure and cORR was also found. However, the 
lowest exposure quartile of T-Dxd included subjects with lower body weight, larger baseline tumour 
sizes, a greater percentage of ECOG ≥1, and a greater percentage of renal and hepatic impairment. 
Therefore, the univariate analyses are likely to be confounded by poor prognostic factors and co-
morbidities. It is acknowledged that patients with poor prognostic factors are overrepresented in the 
group with lowest exposure quartile for other antibodies in the oncology field (pembrolizumab, 
nivolumab, ipilimumab) and this hampers robust exposure-efficacy evaluation when only one dose has 
been used. 
The exposure-safety analyses performed with U302 data included in the data set have yielded results 
that are consistent with the previous analyses. T-DXd AUC,ss is correlated with TEAE mediated 
discontinuation of study drug and any grade ILD, T-DXd Cmax,ss is correlated with Grade ≥2 LVEF 
decrease and Grade ≥3 ILD, and DXd Cavg until time of event is correlated with the other TEAEs. The 
Assessment report

risk of ILD is associated with higher exposure to T-DXd, and the risk of ILD grade ≥3 is similar 
between Asians and non-Asians. Finally, modelled TEAE rates were comparable between second or 
later lines and third or later lines of therapy for 5.4 mg/kg Q3W T-DXd in BC subjects. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a HER2-targeted antibody and topoisomerase I inhibitor conjugate 
(ADC molecule) approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer 
(T-DXd dose 5.4 mg/kg). The present application concerns approval of T-DXd as 2L monotherapy after 
at least one prior anti-HER2-based regimen. The pharmacology package included in the current 
application includes data from a phase 3 study in the intended patient population. Data from the phase 
3 study and inclusion of the new PKPD data to the PK model do not change the existing knowledge on 
T-DXd PKPD in BC patients.

To evaluate efficacy of T-DXd compared to T-DM1 on the following: 
−  Confirmed ORR 
−  Duration of response (DoR) 
−  PFS based on investigator assessment 
To further determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of T-DXd

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: PFS Based on BICR 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636117/2022  
Page 67/148 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS based on BICR assessment using RECIST v1.1.  PFS was 
defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest date of the first documented tumour 
progression or death due to any cause. If a subject was alive with no objective documentation of 
radiographic disease progression by the analysis data cut-off (DCO) date, PFS was censored at the last 
adequate tumour evaluation date before the DCO. Discontinuation associated with disease progression 
without supportive evidence satisfying RECIST v1.1 progression criteria were not considered as PFS 
events.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to 
the date of death due to any cause. If there was no death reported for a subject before the DCO for OS 
analysis, OS was censored at the date of last contact at which s/he was known to be alive. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
−  PFS based on investigator assessment (INV) 
−  Objective response rate (ORR) based on BICR and INV.  ORR was defined as the proportion of 
subjects with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according 
to RECIST v1.1 criteria. Confirmation of CR or PR was required. 
−  Duration of response (DoR) based on BICR and INV. DoR was defined as the time from the date of 
the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the date of the first documentation of 
disease progression or death due to any cause for subjects with a confirmed CR or PR. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints included:  
−  Time to response (TTR) based on BICR.  TTR was defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective response (CR or PR).  Time to 
response was measured for responding subjects only.  
−  Best percent change in the sum of diameters (SoD) of measurable tumours based on BICR. 
−  Clinical benefit rate (CBR) based on BICR.  CBR was defined as the sum of the CR rate, PR rate, 
and the rate of stable disease lasting more than 6 months. 
−  PFS on next-line treatment (PFS2) based on INV. PFS2 was defined as the time from date of 
randomization to the first documented progression on next line therapy or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurred first.  Next line therapy was defined as the first new systemic antineoplastic 
therapy initiated after discontinuation of study treatment regardless of the reason for end of 
treatment. 
Health Economics and Outcome Research Endpoints 
−  The impact of treatment on HRQoL was assessed based on changes from baseline over time in the 
EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, the EORTC QLQ-BR45 questionnaire, and the EQ-5D-5L 
questionnaire.  Hospitalization-related endpoints were also evaluated (see DS8201-A-U302 CSR 
Appendix 16.1.1 Protocol Version 6.0 Section 10.1).   
The primary patient reported outcome (PRO) variable of interest was the global health status/global 
quality of life (QoL) scale score of the EORTC QLQ-C30. Secondary PRO variables of interest were 
physical functioning, emotional functioning, and social functioning subscale scores of the EORTC QLQ-
C30, the BC symptoms scale of the EORTC QLQ-BR45, and the index score of the EQ-5D-5L.

Sample size 
The study is planned with a group sequential design, which includes an interim assessment for PFS 
using a Haybittle-Peto stopping boundary. Assuming a median PFS of 9.6 months in the T-DM1 arm 
based on the results of the EMILIA study, it is hypothesized that treatment with trastuzumab 
deruxtecan will result in a HR of 0.7, a 30% reduction in the hazard rate of PFS (disease progression or 
death) that would correspond to a 43% improvement in median PFS from 9.6 months in the T-DM1 
arm to 13.7 months in the trastuzumab deruxtecan arm under the exponential model assumption. 
A total of approximately 500 subjects will be randomized (250 subjects to trastuzumab deruxtecan and 
250 subjects to T-DM1). An interim analysis that allows the study to declare superiority of the primary 
efficacy endpoint is planned after approximately 234 (70%) of the targeted PFS events are 
documented. The final PFS analysis will occur after approximately 335 PFS events have been 
documented, if superiority is not demonstrated at the interim analysis. 
With 335 PFS events, the study will have approximately 90.4% power to detect an HR of 0.70 in PFS 
at an overall 2-sided significance level of 0.05 to reject the null hypothesis (HR =1) using a log-rank 
test and a 2-look group sequential design with Haybittle-Peto efficacy boundary. 
OS will be compared between the 2 treatment groups, provided that the test of the primary endpoint 
PFS is statistically significant at either interim analysis or final analysis. Assuming a median OS of 29.9 
months in the T-DM1 arm based on the results of the EMILIA study, it is hypothesized that treatment 
with trastuzumab deruxtecan will result in a hazard ratio of 0.7 in OS that would correspond to a 43% 
improvement in median OS from 29.9 months in the T-DM1 arm to 42.7 months in the trastuzumab 
deruxtecan arm under the exponential model assumption. 
With 250 OS events, the study will have approximately 80% power (conditional on PFS being 
significant) to detect a HR of 0.70 in OS at an overall 2-sided significance level of 0.05 to reject the 
null hypothesis (HR =1) using a log-rank test and a 3-look group sequential design with Lan- DeMets 
alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming efficacy boundary2, 3. If the true hazard ratio is 0.7, it is 
estimated that approximately 96 (38.4%) and 153 (61.2%) of the targeted OS events will be 
documented at the timing of the 2 OS interim analyses (when PFS IA and FA are performed). 
Randomisation 
The target sample size of approximately 500 subjects was randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 2 treatment 
groups (DS-8201a versus T-DM1). Randomization was stratified by: 
•  Hormone receptor status (positive, negative) 
• 
Prior treatment with pertuzumab (yes, no) 
•  History of visceral disease (yes, no) 
Blinding (masking) 
This is an open label study.

Analysis Sets for efficacy

The full analysis set (FAS) will include all subjects randomized into the study. The full analysis set will 
be the primary analysis set for all efficacy analysis. Following the intent-to-treat principle, subjects will 
be analysed according to the treatments and strata they were assigned at randomization. 
Primary efficacy endpoint PFS by BICR 
The primary efficacy analysis will be the comparison of the distribution of PFS between the two 
treatment groups using a stratified log-rank test, with strata being the same as the randomization 
stratification factors from IXRS. The survival distribution of PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier (K-M) method for each treatment group and the results will be presented graphically by 
treatment group. 
The treatment effect hazard ratio (HR) of PFS and its two-sided 95% CI will be estimated using 
stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model with the same stratification factors as the 
randomization stratification factors taken from IXRS.

Source SAP page 49/282 
Supportive and sensitivity analyses for PFS 
As a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of stratification on primary efficacy analysis, the two 
treatment groups will be compared using an unstratified log-rank test. The same censoring rules used 
for the primary efficacy analysis will be applied. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed to assess the impact of 
censoring rules used for the primary efficacy analysis: 
•  Using the BICR PFS data on the full analysis set, and including PFS events whenever they 
occurred, i.e. not censoring for missing 2 consecutive tumour assessments. 
•  Using the BICR PFS data on the full analysis set, but censoring for new anti-cancer therapy. In 
such cases, the censoring date would be the date of last evaluable tumour assessment prior to 
anti-cancer therapy (other than study drug). 
Backdating PFS analysis: repeat BICR PFS analysis not censoring for missing tumour assessment, but 
backdate PFS event time in the case that PFS event occurred after missing one or more tumour 
assessments. In such cases, the PFS event date would be considered to be 6 weeks after last evaluable 
tumour assessment occurring prior to progression/death. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoint OS 
Overall survival will be compared between the 2 treatment groups, using a stratified log-rank test 
stratified by the randomization stratification factors as recorded by IXRS. The survival distribution of 
OS will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and results will be presented graphically. The treatment 
effect hazard ratio (HR) and its 95%CI will be estimated, using stratified Cox proportional hazards 
regression model stratified by the randomization stratification factors as recorded by the IXRS. 
Censoring rules for OS 
If there is no death reported for a subject before the data cut-off for OS analysis, OS will be censored 
at the last contact date at which the subject is known to be alive. 
Other efficacy endpoints: ORR 
ORR (based on BICR and investigator assessment) will be summarized by treatment group along with 
the two-sided 95%CIs using the Clopper-Pearson method. The difference of ORR between the two 
treatment groups will be summarized and the 95%CI will be calculated using continuity correction. The 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by the randomization stratification factors per IXRS will be 
used to compare ORR at two-sided significance level of 0.05. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636117/2022  
Page 71/148 
 
 
 
 
As a supportive analysis, ORR will also be summarized by using the investigator review of tumour data. 
Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis of PFS for superiority is planned after approximately 234 PFS events per BICR 
(70% of target total of 335) have been documented. If the study continues to the final PFS analysis, 
the final PFS analysis will be performed when approximately 335 PFS events have been documented. A 
group sequential design, utilizing 2-look Haybittle-Peto stop boundary will be used to construct the 
efficacy stopping boundaries with an overall 2-sided significance level of 0.05.  
Up to two interim analyses and a final analysis of OS are planned, provided PFS is statistically 
significant. The first OS interim analysis is planned at time of the PFS interim analysis, and the second 
OS interim analysis is planned at time of the final PFS analysis. 
Approximately 96 and 153 of the planned 250 OS events (38.4% and 61.2% of information fractions) 
will be expected to be documented by time of the first and the second OS interim analyses, 
respectively. Final OS analysis is planned after approximately 250 OS events have been documented. 
A group sequential design, utilizing 3-look Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien -Fleming 
stop boundary, will be used to construct the efficacy stopping boundaries with an overall 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05. OS will be hierarchically tested in the following way: 
1. The first potential OS analysis will be at the time of the PFS interim analysis after 96 expected 
deaths. If PFS is statistically significant at this stage, OS will also be tested. If OS is not statistically 
significant at this stage, the second OS interim analysis will be planned after 153 deaths. If OS is not 
statistically significant at the second interim analysis, a final analysis is planned after 250 deaths have 
been recorded. 
2. If PFS is not statistically significant at the time of the interim analysis of PFS, then OS will not be 
tested at the time of the interim analysis of PFS. If PFS is statistically significant at the time of the final 
analysis, then OS will also be tested. In terms of alpha spending, this analysis will be performed as if 
the first analysis of OS had occurred at the PFS interim analysis. If OS is not statistically significant at 
this stage, further testing will be carried out when a total of 250 deaths have been recorded. 
3. If PFS is not statistically significant after the final analysis for PFS is performed, then OS will not be 
tested. 
Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity 
There are two potential sources of multiplicity: 
• Multiplicity arising due to testing two endpoints PFS and OS 
• Multiplicity arising due to the group sequential design 
To address the first multiplicity issue, the primary efficacy endpoint, PFS, and the key secondary 
efficacy endpoint, OS, will be tested hierarchically to maintain the overall two-sided type-I error rate to 
0.05 or less. 
A group sequential design, utilizing 2-look Haybittle-Peto boundary will be used to control the type I 
error rate for the primary efficacy analysis PFS. A group sequential design, utilizing 3-look Lan-DeMets 
alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundary, will be used to construct the efficacy stopping 
boundaries for OS.  
The type I error rate will be controlled by using a Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien-
Fleming boundary for OS independent of the Haybittle-Peto boundary used for PFS. This guarantees

the protection of the overall significance level across the 2 hypotheses and the repeated testing of the 
OS hypotheses in the interim and the final analyses.

A total of 699 subjects were screened and 524 subjects were randomized. Six subjects were 
randomized but not treated: 2 subjects failed screening but were randomized in error (T-DXd and T-
DM1), 2 subjects did not meet eligibility criteria (T-DXd), 1 was withdrawn by the investigator (T-DXd), 
and 1 subject withdrew consent (T-DM1). 
Recruitment 
From 9 August 2018 to the DCO date of 21 May 2021, 524 subjects were randomized at 118 study 
sites in 14 countries:  Australia (14 subjects), Belgium (5), Brazil (63), Canada (2), China (65), France 
(38), Hong Kong (21), Italy (25), Japan (68), Republic of Korea (84), Spain (25), Taiwan (71), United 
Kingdom (11), United States (32). Median duration of follow (study duration) as of DCO of 21 May 
2021: 15.9 months (range: 0, 32.7). 
Conduct of the study 
After the initial release (v1.0, 23 March 2018), the study protocol was amended 5 times. A summary of 
changes for all versions of the protocol is available in Appendix 16.1.1. Key changes in each 
amendment were as shown below.

Changes in Collection of Data 
Because of site closures, 4 subjects  were temporarily transferred to another existing study site that 
was different from the site at which the subject originally enrolled. In such cases, the transfer was 
initiated by the Sponsor. Study activities, including drug dispensing and dosing for each subject, were 
performed per protocol at the transfer site. All documentation and data entry, however, was 
maintained by the site at which the subject was originally enrolled, and the investigator at the site at 
which the subject was originally enrolled maintained oversight of the subject throughout the subject’s 
participation in this study, including during the transfer period. All 4 transferred subjects returned to 
the site at which they originally enrolled when the facility reopened for subject visits. 
Modification of study procedures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic was generally not necessary. 
The following modifications were permitted by the protocol: 
•  Screening and on-treatment safety laboratory tests were performed locally and the data were 
transmitted to the Sponsor and retained in the site’s medical record. 
• 
• 
• 
ECGs were performed and read locally, with values recorded in the eCRF. 
Tumour imaging assessments were performed locally and read locally and results were 
recorded in the eCRF. 
PRO were administered on paper (and, in some cases, via phone) and results were recorded on 
the eCRF. 
•  Dose interruptions were limited by protocol to 49 days after last dose date, unless permission 
for a subject to remain on study was granted. Because of pandemic-related disruptions, some 
sites were closed to subject access, leading to delays in dosing. A dosing extension request 
form was created to document such delays, which required sites to document the nature of the 
disruption to access as well as proof of continued benefit from treatment. Seven subjects 
required such dosing extensions during the course of the study, with a maximum dosing 
extension of 25 days. 
Changes in Monitoring/Oversight 
Risk-based/remote monitoring activities initiated at the beginning of the study continued during the 
COVID-19 pandemic; however, based on site and/or country policy, on-site monitoring visits were not 
conducted if sites could not accept visitors. During this time, on-site monitoring visits were replaced 
with remote visits/more frequent remote monitoring and telephone contacts were made where 
permissible by local regulations. 
Monitors used virtual monitoring visits to reinforce AE reporting and timely data entry. 
Targeted source data verification was the primary task during these on-site visits, focusing on primary 
efficacy and key safety data points. 
At the time of database lock, site data verification could not be completed in some sites due to site 
access limitations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk to data quality was considered 
minimal, as alternative methods of data review and data cleaning activities were conducted over the 
course of the study.

The following PRO questionnaires were summarized by treatment arm: EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-
BR45, and EQ-5D-5L.  
The PRO completion compliance rate was high at baseline (97%) and diminished during follow-up 
(about 83-87% at Cycle 3 and below 50% at C21 in the T-DXd arm and at C9 in the T-DM1 arm). 
Evaluation of PRO variables showed that the QoL of patients in the T DXd arm was either maintained or 
numerically improved on treatment compared with patients in the T DM1 arm.

for subjects who had received prior trastuzumab in the (neo)adjuvant setting but not in the metastatic 
setting. For T-DM1, the median PFS was 6.8 months for subjects with prior trastuzumab in the metastatic 
setting and for subjects with prior trastuzumab in the (neo)adjuvant setting but not in the metastatic 
setting.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy assessment of the applied extension of indication is based on the pivotal study Destiny 
breast03 or Study U302, which is a phase 3 randomised open-label two-arm study comparing 
trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) head to head with the current SOC in the 2L setting, i.e. trastuzumab 
emtansine (T-DM1). The applied extension of indication is for the 2L setting of HER2-positive 
metastatic breast cancer after the established 1L use of a taxane and pertuzumab + trastuzumab. 
Patients were recruited from 118 study sites in 14 countries and the median study duration was 15.9 
months at the DCO of 21 May 2021. 524 patients were randomized 1:1 to the two treatment arms and 
this is an acceptable sample size. The pivotal study was fully recruited in approximately 2 years and 9 
months and a relevant fraction of the patients has been recruited from an EU like population (~33%). 
The presented data are from the prespecified interim analysis (IA) for superiority of the primary 
efficacy endpoint of blinded independent central review (BICR)-assessed progression-free survival 
(PFS). The differences in toxicity management between the treatment arms are acknowledged and the

open-label design can be acceptable as the main efficacy endpoints were assessed blinded and 
included overall survival. It will, however, hamper the interpretation of quality of life parameters as 
discussed below. 
The primary endpoint was PFS as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1 with overall survival (OS) as 
key secondary endpoint. Other secondary endpoints were PFS as assessed by investigator, confirmed 
objective response rate (ORR; by BICR and investigator), and duration of response (DOR; by BICR and 
investigator). The primary and secondary endpoints are acceptable and established in the current 
setting. Exploratory efficacy endpoints included amongst others time to response by BICR, clinical 
benefit rate (CBR; sum of CR, PR and stable disease lasting more than 6 months), and PFS on next-
line treatment by investigator (PFS2). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed with 
established questionnaires (EORTC quality of life QLQ-C30 (primary patient reported outcome [PRO], 
QLQ-BR45, EQ-5D-5L). It is uncertain whether the HRQoL outcomes should be viewed as secondary 
endpoints (clinical overview) or exploratory (study protocol). No formal statistical testing was planned 
as recommended in the scientific advice, including handling of missing data, and the open-label design 
limits the interpretation of HRQoL outcomes. Overall, this precludes a claim on PRO in the SmPC. 
It should be noted that T-DXd is currently conditionally approved and the confirmatory study for the 
CMA is Study U301, a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled study of T-DXd 
versus treatment of investigator’s choice for HER2-positive, unresectable and/or metastatic breast 
cancer subjects pre-treated with prior standard of care HER2 therapies, including T-DM1. The due date 
for submission is estimated to 4Q 2022. 
Baseline characteristics showed that the median age was ~54 years with ~80% of the patients being 
less than 65 years old and ~18% of the patients were ≥65 years, which is considered reflective of the 
patient population. Two male patients were included, one in each treatment arm, which is acceptable 
since breast cancer is rare in men. Moreover, the results from the pivotal trial is considered 
extrapolatable to men with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in line with previous EMA decisions 
for HER2-targeted treatments (e.g. trastuzumab). The low number of patients older than 75 years is 
already reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Most patients were Asian (57.1% and 60.8%, respectively) or European (20.7% and 19%), so the 
Asian population dominated the study population, but the fraction of European patients is considered 
acceptable for interpretation of the study results in an EU context.  
The study population was heavily pre-treated, and many patients had at least 2 prior lines of therapy 
in the metastatic setting. If endocrine therapy is excluded, the majority of the patients had less than 3 
prior systemic therapies (~72%), which is more than what was the minimum required by the inclusion 
criteria and what has been reflected in the current target population for the applied indication, i.e. 
second-line treatment in the metastatic setting. Therefore, the MAH was asked to justify the 
applicability of the study results for the applied indication. It is agreed that the PFS and OS results are 
clinically relevantly improved regardless of number of prior lines of therapy, number of lines of anti-
HER2 based therapy and this is encouraging. Although part of the included patient population was 
more heavily pre-treated than expected, the results from the study population are still considered 
applicable to the targeted patient population.  
Most patients were of ECOG PS 0 (59% and 66.5%) or 1 (40.6% and 33.1%); HER2 expression on ICH 
of 3+ (85.4% and 84.0%) and approximately half of the patients had hormone receptor (HR)-positive 
tumours, while a third of the tumours were Progesterone receptor positive, which reflects the target 
population. Prior pertuzumab was given in ~60% of the patients and the majority of patients had a 
history of visceral metastases (70.5% and 70.3%). Hence, for these three chosen stratification factors, 
the patients were equally distributed between arms and, except for prior pertuzumab, the study 
Assessment report

population is considered to reflect the targeted patient population. However, the fraction of patients 
treated with pertuzumab is considered lower than what would be expected in a European population. 
Relatively few patients had CNS metastases at baseline (16.5% and 14.8%), probably due to the strict 
inclusion criteria regarding stability and no use of corticosteroids and lower than would be expected of 
the incidence of CNS metastases in the patient population with HER2+ MBC eligible for a 2L+ systemic 
treatment. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint was met and the primary analysis of PFS by BICR showed a statistically 
significant and clinically relevant improvement from 6.8 months (95%CI: 5.6, 8.2) with T-DM1 to not 
reached (95%CI: 18.5, NE) with T-DXd, HR 0.28 (95%CI: 0.22, 0.37). The data is partly mature with 
33.3% events in the active T-DXd arm and 60.1% events in the control arm, but the KM curves 
separate early and stay separated, so further updates are considered unlikely to change the study 
result significantly due to the high number of events in the control arm. Patients were censored in 
66.7% in the T-DXd arm and 39.9% of the T-DM1 arm. The main reason for censoring was ongoing 
without event (49.0% and 18.6%, respectively), although also more than 10% in both arms was 
censored for “adequate tumour assessment no longer available” as the last tumour scan was more 
than 14 weeks before DCO. Other reasons for censoring occurred in less than 5%. The sensitivity 
analyses provided support the primary analysis of PFS by BICR.  
Initially, the PFS analysis was planned when approximately 331 events had been observed, with 90% 
power to detect an HR of 0.70 in PFS using a log-rank test and a 2-look group sequential design with 
O’Brien-Fleming efficacy boundary (2-sided p-value 0.05). This was based on an estimated median PFS 
of 13.7 months with T-DXd vs. 9.6 months for T-DM1. An IA of PFS was added based on emergent 
data from study U201, to be conducted earlier after approximately 234 events (70% information 
fraction). To ensure that the study would be declared positive on a highly clinically relevant magnitude 
of benefit, the efficacy boundaries were changed to the more stringent Haybittle-Peto efficacy 
boundary with a 2-sided p value of 0.000204 or less. 
The performance of the control arm is lower than the median PFS reported in patients on T-DM1 in the 
EMILIA study (T-DM1 vs capecitabine and lapatinib, median PFS 9.6 months), but is considered in line 
with the PFS observed with T-DM1 alone after the THP regimen (Taxane + trastuzumab + 
pertuzumab), as observed in the KATE2 study (T-DM1 + atezolizumab vs T DM1 + placebo, median 
PFS of 6.8 months). Moreover, the study population in the Destiny breast03 is heavily pre-treated and 
the majority had previously been treated with pertuzumab, which was not the case in the EMILIA 
study. Hence, the performance of the control arm is considered acceptable in this context. 
The key secondary endpoint was overall survival and OS data are not mature at the time the first IA 
with only 12.2% events with T-DXd and 20.2% events in the control arm after 15.9 months of follow 
up. Hence, the median OS was not reached in either of the treatment arms and was not statistically 
significantly improved although the KM curves for OS visually separate and a detriment in OS is not 
likely. Considering that the targeted patient population are likely to receive further lines of treatment, 
this OS result is considered sufficient for the current procedure, but the MAH has committed to submit 
the results from the upcoming OS analyses from the pivotal study U302 post-authorization as a 
recommendation.  
At the time the IA for PFS was added, OS was designated as key secondary endpoint. Two IA were 
planned, at the time of primary PFS analysis if significant and at about 153 OS events. With 250 OS 
events (final analysis), the study will have approximately 80% power to detect a HR of 0.70 in OS (2-
sided p-value 0.05) using a log-rank test and a 3-look group sequential design with Lan-DeMets alpha 
Assessment report

spending function with O’Brien-Fleming efficacy boundary. Median OS was assumed to increase from 
29.9 months with T-DM1 to 42.7 months with T-DXd under the exponential model assumption. The 
methodology is acceptable; however, it should be noted that at the time of the currently provided 
DCO, the study did not meet the pre-specified number of OS events needed to achieve sufficient power 
(estimated 96 targeted OS events), despite the recommendations made during the scientific advice. 
After the initial release (March 2018), the study protocol was amended 5 times. The main changes 
were with amendment 4 (April 2020) and amendment 5 (September 2020) were the above described 
interim analysis for PFS with updated efficacy boundary and changes in the OS analyses were added.  
PFS by investigator also showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement from 
7.2 months (95%CI: 6.8; 8.3) with T-DM1 to 25.1 months (95%CI: 22.1, NE) with T-DXd, HR 0.26 
(95%CI: 0.20, 0.35). Median duration of PFS follow-up was 15.5 months and 13.9 months in the 
investigational and control arm, respectively. The data is again partly mature with 29.9% events in the 
active T-DXd arm and 63.9% events in the control arm. The KM curves also separates early and stay 
separated and the overall concordance rate of PFS between INV and BICR was 81.99% in the T-DXd 
arm and 78.71% in the T-DM1 arm, which is acceptable in the context of the open-label design. Due to 
discrepancies between PFS per BICR and investigator assessment, a sensitivity analysis was requested 
counting the earliest occurrence as event independent of assessment method. The results of this 
analysis showed consistent results with the primary analysis. 
ORR by BICR is clinically and statistically significantly improved from 34.2% in the control arm to 
79.7% with T-DXd. The improvement was observed for both complete and partial response (CR and 
PR), i.e. the CR was improved from 8.7% to 16.1%, while the PR was improved from 25.5% to 63.6% 
with T-DXd. It is noted that very few patients progressed on treatment with T-DXd (1.1%) and the 
induced responses were durable, although median DOR was not reached in either arm, the median 
DoR was NE (95%CI: 20.3, NE) in the T-DXd arm vs. NE (95%CI: 12.6, NE) in the T-DM1 arm. 
However, the DoR data is not mature, with 27.9% and 34.4% events in each arm, respectively, so the 
MAH is asked to provide updated confirmed ORR and DoR, if possible, but these are not yet available. 
The Applicant proposes to submit updated clinical efficacy data at the time of the next OS analysis 
(currently projected for 3Q2022) post-authorisation and this is acceptable. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint (PFS by BICR) supported a benefit of T-DXd compared 
with T-DM1 for important pre-specified subgroups above for all point estimates including prior 
pertuzumab therapy, hormone receptor status, presence of stable brain metastases, presence of 
visceral disease, prior lines of systemic therapies, and across geographic regions. Although not 
predefined, additional subgroup analyses were requested and they all support the primary analysis.  
Patient-reported outcomes - The PRO completion compliance rate was high at baseline (97%) and 
diminished during follow-up (about 83-87%% at Cycle 3 and below 50% at C21 in the T-DXd arm and 
at C9 in the T-DM1 arm). Evaluation of PRO variables showed that the QoL of subjects in the T-DXd 
arm was either maintained or numerically improved on treatment compared with subjects in the 
T-DM1 arm. Although it is reassuring that there seems to be no detriment on QoL in patients treated 
with T-DXd compared to T-DM1 and numerical increases in QoL may support the beneficial effect of T-
DXd, the lack of preplanned/defined analysis of PRO outcomes and the open-label study design 
preclude firm conclusions. In addition, by not reaching statistical significance for the key secondary 
endpoint OS, all other endpoints lower in hierarchy are considered to be descriptive. Therefore, QoL of 
life data are not reflected in the SmPC. 
Regarding the wording of the indication, the MAH proposes to not specifically mention that patients 
had received prior trastuzumab and taxane therapy for metastatic disease or developed disease 
recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy as was defined in the inclusion 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636117/2022  
Page 102/148 
 
 
 
criteria and included in the wording of the indication for T-DM1 (see section 1.3 of the assessment 
report). The text proposal for the indication to treat patients who have received a prior anti-HER2-
based regimen can, however, be agreed. First of all, the standard SOC for first-line treatment is well 
known and constitutes the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab and a taxane chemotherapy. In 
less fit patients, a less toxic or no chemotherapeutic agents may be considered (Gennari et al., Annals 
of Oncology, 2021). Based on the mechanism of action of T-DXd, there are no concerns regarding 
differential safety or efficacy of T-DXd monotherapy in second line after a first-line therapy with a less 
toxic or no chemotherapeutic backbone. Also, the ESMO guidelines recommended that patients with 
metastatic recurrence within 6-12 months of receiving adjuvant trastuzumab-pertuzumab should 
continue to second-line therapy (Gennari et al., Annals of Oncology, 2021). 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from the pivotal Study U302 show a statistically significant and clinically relevant increase 
in PFS from median of 6.8 months with T-DM1 treatment to a median of not reached with T-DXd 
treatment (95%CI: 18.5, NE) in patients with HER2-positive, unresectable and/or metastatic breast 
cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and taxane. The key secondary endpoint OS was 
immature, but there was no sign of a detriment. Other secondary endpoints were supportive of a 
benefit of T-DXd treatment over T-DM1 treatment. Final efficacy data from the pivotal U302 study 
were recommended to be provided post-approval (PAM-REC). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The primary data on clinical safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) are based on data from the 
T-DXd arm (N=257) and the T-DM1 arm (N=261) of Study U302. Moreover, data for subjects with 
HER2-positive BC who received T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg in Study J101 and Study U201 were pooled with 
those from Study U302 to form the “HER2-positive BC T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool” (N=491). In addition, 
the data for patients with any tumour type who received T-DXd ≥ 5.4 mg/kg in the completed studies 
were included in the “All Tumour Types T-DXd ≥5.4 mg/kg Pool” (N=1219).

Adverse events 
At the time of DCO, 51.4% and 18.0% of patients were on treatment with T-DXd and T-DM1, 
respectively. The main reasons for treatment discontinuation were progressive disease (25.7% and 
60.5% for T-DXd and T-DM1, respectively) and discontinuations due to adverse events (13.6% and 
7.3% for T-DXd and T-DM1, respectively) (see also Figure 7.1 in the efficacy section).

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interactions with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A and organic anion transporting polypeptide 
(OATP)1B inhibitors were observed in a dedicated drug-drug interaction study (DS8201-A-A104) with 
ritonavir and itraconazole in subjects with BC (see Enhertu EPAR). No new information on drug 
interactions is available since the time of Study DS8201-A-A104 (DCO of 26 Sep 2018).

Post marketing experience 
Initial approval of T-DXd was granted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) 
under accelerated approval on 20 Dec 2019 for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic 
HER2-positive BC who have received 2 or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic 
setting.   
As of 01 Sep 2021, T-DXd has been authorized for sale in the US, Japan, EU, Great Britain, Israel, and 
Canada for the treatment of HER2-positive BC and, in some countries, for the treatment of HER2-
positive gastric cancer (GC) as well. 
The first 3 Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Reports (PBRERs) covered the reporting periods 
20 Dec 2019 through 19 Jun 2020, 20 Jun 2020 through 19 Dec 2020, and 20 Dec 2020 through 
19 Jun 2021. There were no new safety findings based on spontaneous cases received during the 
period. For the purpose of this procedure, a periodic output was generated from the global safety 
database from 20 Jun 2021 through 01 Sep 2021. Based on review of data from 20 Dec 2019 through 
01 Sep 2021, no new safety findings have been identified from spontaneous reports during the post-
marketing period. The reported events were generally consistent with the known safety profile of 
T-DXd. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data has been provided for 1219 patients that received trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) ≥5.4 
mg/kg across five completed clinical trials in various tumour types. Most patients received 6.4 mg/kg 
(n=619), followed by 5.4 mg/kg (n=573). The safety populations of interest are patients from the 
pivotal study Destiny Breast03 or U302 (n=257 who received trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd)) and 
the HER2-positive BC T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool (n=491, named BC pool). The size of the safety data 
available on patients, who have received T-DXd at the proposed dose of 5.4 mg/kg Q3W is considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636117/2022  
Page 133/148 
 
 
 
acceptable. The median treatment duration of T-DXd in study U302 and the BC pool are 14 and 12 
months, respectively. A total of 78% of the patients in the BC pool, which includes the T-DXd-treated 
patients from study U302, had exposure of T-DXd for more than 6 months and 53% were exposed for 
more than 12 months, which is acceptable and considered a relevant exposure for the safety 
assessment.  
Almost all of the patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) in the pivotal study U302 and 
in the HER2-positive breast cancer pool (BC pool), the most frequently observed adverse events were 
nausea (77.8%), fatigue (56.6%), vomiting (49.5%), and neutropenia (38.1%). Alopecia was much 
more frequent with T-DXd compared to T-DM1 (41.3% vs 3.1%), which is considered an important AE 
that has impact on quality of life-measures in the targeted patient population. 
Treatment-related AE’s (ADR’s) with T-DXd were also nausea (74.9%), fatigue (51.5%), vomiting 
(43.6%), and neutropenia (37.3%) of almost the same incidences. Additional haematological toxicity 
was also very common, such as anaemia (29.5%), leukopenia (25.5%), and thrombocytopenia 
(23.8%). Gastrointestinal toxicity was markedly increased with T-DXd vs T-DM1, and besides vomiting 
(43.6% vs 5.7%), ADR’s of decreased appetite (29.1% vs 12.6%), diarrhoea (24.4% vs 3.8%) and 
constipation (21% vs 9.6%) were clinically significantly more commonly observed. Most commonly 
TEAEs by PT (>30%) for T-DM1 were (in decreasing order) thrombocytopenia, aspartate 
aminotransferase (ASAT) increased, fatigue and nausea. Thrombocytopenia and ASAT increased were 
also reported at a ≥10% higher incidence compared to T-DXd. These are in line with that reported in 
the SmPC. 
As previously shown in the later line setting, most haematological and GI events for T-DXd were grade 
1 or 2. No subject in either treatment arm had an event of major bleeding within 14 days of the onset 
of ≥Grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Of note, the % of unresolved events for thrombocytopenia was 33% 
and substantial higher than for TDM-1 (11%). As the time to onset of first event of thrombocytopenia 
was also substantial longer (131 days vs 8 days), resolution of events may increase with longer follow-
up. The percentage of unresolved events did not notably change with an additional 3 months follow-
up, and a longer follow-up could be needed. Nevertheless, it is reassuring that there were no major 
bleedings associated with thrombocytopenia and dose modifications were few. Most events were 
manageable with established treatment guidelines and dose modifications. Adequate statements are 
presented throughout the SmPC.   
Grade ≥3 AE’s in the T-DXd arm of pivotal study U302 and the BC pool, respectively, were: 
neutropenia (19.1% and 19.6%) and anaemia (7.4% and 8.1%). The most common grade ≥3 AEs 
with T-DM1 were thrombocytopenia (25.7%) and anaemia (5.7%), while thrombocytopenia of high 
grade was rare with T-DXd (6.1%), so the toxicity profiles of these two HER2-targeting ADCs are 
considered clinically significantly different. Treatment-related grade ≥3 events observed in more 
than 5% of the patients treated with T-DXd were neutropenia, anaemia, leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, nausea, and fatigue; while grade ≥3 ADR’s observed in more than 5% of the 
patients treated with T-DM1 in the control arm were anaemia, thrombocytopenia and transaminases 
increased. Hence, more high-grade toxicity was observed with T-DXd.  
Adverse events of special interest includes ILD/pneumonitis, which is an important identified 
risk with trastuzumab deruxtecan. This event was commonly observed with T-DXd in the BC pool 
(13.4%), and these events were most often of grade 2 (7.9%). The majority of these events were 
assessed to be treatment-related (12.6%) and often led to treatment discontinuation (9.4%). Nearly 
half of the events were resolved (46.8%) at DCO, but a third (30.6%) was not resolved and there were 
6 fatal cases (9.7%) of ILD/pneumonitis. Overall, the risk of ILD/pneumonitis is considered of clinical 
interest, but the risks of high-grade events and need for discontinuations have not changed 
significantly with the added safety data from the pivotal U302 study. The ADR of ILD/pneumonitis 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636117/2022  
Page 134/148 
 
 
 
continues to be the greatest risk of the treatment with T-DXd and therefore the warning in section 4.4 
is endorsed. However, the risk and management of ILD/pneumonitis is adequately described in the 
SmPC. In addition, information is included in the RMP and educational material. Left ventricular 
dysfunction is considered an important identified risk based on what is known for trastuzumab. The 
incidences of grade 2 decrease of LVEF (13.5% and 16.1%) or grade 3 decrease of LVEF (0.4% and 
0.2%) were similar in the T-DXd arm and the BC pool, respectively. In the BC pool, 14.5% of the 
patients had a 10%-19% decrease in absolute value of LVEF, and only one patient had ≥20% increase 
in absolute value. All events except one with T-DXd were resolved at DCO and appropriate guidance is 
provided in the SmPC, so decrease in LVEF is considered manageable. 
In the BC pool, 22.8% of the patients had died, most commonly due to disease progression (16.3%) 
and rarely due to an adverse event (2%) or other/unknown reasons (1.8%/2.6%). The narratives for 
the patients who died from other causes in the pivotal study are agreed. The overall incidence of 
deaths due to adverse events are acceptable for this non-curative treatment setting and considering 
the underlying metastatic breast cancer. Deaths due to ADR’s are sufficiently reflected in the SmPC. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed in 22.6% of the patients in the BC pool, which is 
similar to the SAE’s observed in the T-DXd arm (19.1%) and the T-DM1 arm (18%). The most 
commonly observed were interstitial lung disease (ILD) in 3.9%, pneumonia (2%), and vomiting 
(1.8%). This is in line with the severe toxicity observed in the pivotal study U302. Overall, the rate of 
SAE’s with trastuzumab deruxtecan is acceptable and comparable to the incidence observed with T-
DM1. 
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs in the BC pool was 15.7%, and of these, 14.7% of the 
patients discontinued due to treatment-related AEs. Most common AEs leading to discontinuation were 
ILD/pneumonitis (9.4%), which reflects the known safety profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan. 
Otherwise, 4 and 5 patients, respectively, discontinued treatment due to pneumonia and 
thrombocytopenia in the BC pool, which means that the known haematological toxicity rarely led to 
discontinuations, which is reassuring. More patients discontinued T-DM1 due to thrombocytopenia 
(2.7%) than those in the T-DXd arm (1%), but the rate of ILD was markedly lower in the T-DM1 arm 
(7.3%). A numerically higher proportion of patients in the T-DXd arm had adverse events associated 
with dose reduction compared with the T-DM1 arm, mostly gastrointestinal or hematologic events. 
Drug interruptions, mainly due to hematological events also occurred more frequently. Overall, the 
rate of drug interruptions and discontinuations is acceptable for the proposed extension of indication 
and targeted patient population.  
Laboratory findings were in line with the reported AEs. 
Vital signs: A notable part of the patients had post-baseline systolic BP values of ≤90 mmHg with a 
decrease from baseline of ≥20 mmHg (13.6%) or a post-baseline diastolic BP values of ≤50 mmHg 
with a decrease from baseline of ≥15 mmHg (16.3%), and frequencies were higher than for T-DM1. 
However, the frequency of the AE hypotension (PT hypotension/blood pressure decreased) was overall 
low and comparable for T-DXd (2.3%) and T-DM1 (1.9%) and considered not-related to study 
treatment by the investigator. Further, use of antihypertensive medications might have been a 
confounding factor and it is acceptable not to consider hypotension as an ADR.  
Interactions – extrinsic/intrinsic factors: In the pivotal study, 48 patients (19%) were ≥65 years and 7 
were ≥75 years of age. A higher incidence of adverse events ≥grade 3, SAEs, and TEAEs associated 
with study drug interruption were observed with T-DXd, indicating a lower tolerability. Within the BC 
pool a ≥10% increase was seen for thrombocytopenia (33.0% vs 22.3%) and ILD (21.1% vs. 10.2%) 
in elderly (≥65 years, n=109). The increase in ILD by age appears to be explained by increased renal 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636117/2022  
Page 135/148 
 
 
 
impairment in the elderly population. The current statement on limited data in subjects ≥75 years of 
age in section 4.2 and in section 4.8 is still considered relevant.   
As previously shown, drug-related ILD increased with increasing severity of renal impairment. Further 
SAEs and drug discontinuations due to AEs was highest in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
Patients with severe renal impairment were excluded from the study. Adequate statements are 
included in section 4.2, 4.4. and 5.2.  
At enrollment, 19.1% of the patients in the T-DXd arm had mild hepatic impairment whereas patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairment were excluded. Appropriate statements are included in 
section 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. Notably, patients with mild hepatic impairment showed higher 
frequencies of TEAEs, ≥Grade 3, and SAEs, as well as TEAEs associated with drug interruption. This 
was not observed before in the later line setting. It is reassuring that PK data did not show a 
relationship between hepatic impairment and exposure, therefore the finding might be related to other 
factors such as presence of comorbidities and a limited number of patients. Further information on use 
in patients with moderate impairment will become available in due time (see RMP).   
No new safety signals/ADRs were identified based on the BC safety pool or the all-tumour safety pool. 
The frequencies of the all-tumour safety pool were used for categorization of ADRs in section 4.8 SmPC 
(N = 1,219), which included patients treated with a higher dose of 6.4 mg/kg. A trend towards higher 
frequency of ≥Grade 3 TEAEs, SAEs and discontinuations is seen for the all tumour safety pool, 
whereas frequencies of TEAEs reported in ≥10% of patients were in the same order of magnitude for 
the all tumour and BC safety pool. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The MAH has provided safety data from ~500 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, who have had 
relevant exposure to the approved dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4 mg/kg iv Q3W) and there 
were no clinically significant changes of the known safety profile nor any new safety findings. The 
safety profile of T-DXd was compared head to head with T-DM1 in the second-line metastatic 
treatment setting and the toxicities observed with T-DXd are considered clinically significantly different 
from those observed with T-DM1 and tolerability of T-DXd appears lower; however, they remain 
acceptable and manageable. ILD/pneumonitis is still the greatest risk in the treatment with 
trastuzumab deruxtecan, but this is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The posology, administration and method of reconstitution for the extension of the indication is 
unchanged. The updates to the PL, including the safety sections, are not significant and utilise well 
recognised lay terms. Furthermore, the PL will be kept in an identical format size, colours and 
layout/design.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The current extension of indication for trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have 
received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
T-DM1 is the recommended 2L treatment for HER2+ MBC. In the EMILIA study, treatment with T-DM1 
improved the disease outcomes compared with treatment with lapatinib plus capecitabine, with an ORR 
by ICR of 43.6% (95%CI: 38.6, 48.6) in the T-DM1 arm versus (vs.) 30.8% (95%CI: 26.3, 35.7) in 
the control arm; a median PFS of 9.6 months vs. 6.4 months (HR 0.65 [95%CI: 0.55, 0.77), 
respectively; and a median OS of 30.9 months vs. 25.1 months (HR 0.68 [95%CI: 0.55, 0.85]), 
respectively. In the HER2CLIMB study, the addition of tucatinib to the trastuzumab plus capecitabine 
combination improved median PFS from 5.6 months to 7.8 months (HR: 0.54) and median OS from 
17.4 months to 21.9 months (HR: 0.66), which led to an approval in the EU for the 2L+ setting, so this 
treatment regimen is mostly considered indicated in the relevant second-line setting in patients who 
have brain metastases, and if not, T-DM1 is generally the preferred option. 
The limited duration of efficacy of the current standard of car in the second-line metastatic setting 
represents an unmet medical need, which might be addressed by newer agents that provide longer 
PFS. In general, there is a need for more efficacious HER2-targeted treatment regimens. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The single pivotal study Destiny breast03 –also known as Study U302– is a phase 3 randomised open-
label two-arm study comparing trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) head to head with the current SOC in 
the 2L setting, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The presented data are from the prespecified interim analysis (IA) for superiority of the primary 
efficacy endpoint of blinded independent central review (BICR)-assessed progression-free survival 
(PFS) at data cut-off (DCO) date of 21 May 2021. 
After a median follow-up for PFS of 15.5 months in the T-DXd arm and 13.9 months in the T-DM1 arm, 
the primary endpoint was met and the primary analysis of PFS by BICR showed an improvement from 
6.8 months (95%CI: 5.6, 8.2) with T-DM1 to not reached (95%CI: 18.5, NE) with T-DXd, HR 0.28 
(95%CI: 0.22, 0.37). Sensitivity analyses, PFS by investigator, and subgroup analyses were all in 
support of the primary PFS analysis. 
The key secondary endpoint was overall survival and OS data are not mature at the time the first IA 
with only 12.2% events with T-DXd and 20.2% events in the control arm after 15.9 months of follow 
up. The stratified HR was 0.55 (95%CI: 0.36-0.86), with a p-value of 0.007172 that did not cross the 
prespecified boundary. Median OS was NE in both arms.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636117/2022  
Page 140/148 
 
 
 
PFS by investigator also showed an improvement from 7.2 months (95%CI: 6.8; 8.3) with T-DM1 to 
25.1 months (95%CI: 22.1, NE) with T-DXd, HR 0.26 (95%CI: 0.20, 0.35).  
Other exploratory endpoints were supportive of a benefit for T-DXd. ORR by BICR is improved from 
34.2% in the control arm to 79.7% with T-DXd. The improvement was observed for both complete and 
partial response (CR and PR), i.e. the CR was improved from 8.7% to 16.1%, while the PR was 
improved from 25.5% to 63.6% with T-DXd. Median DOR was not reached in either arm, the median 
DoR was NE (95%CI: 20.3, NE) in the T-DXd arm vs. NE (95%CI: 12.6, NE) in the T-DM1 arm. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
PFS results are based on an interim analysis, which potentially induces overestimation of the treatment 
effect. Although this is not expected to affect the clinically relevant gain in PFS, final efficacy data from 
the pivotal U302 study is recommended to be provided post-approval (PAM-REC). 
The median OS was not reached in either of the treatment arms and was not statistically significantly 
improved, although the KM curves for OS visually separate. Considering that the targeted patient 
population is likely to receive further lines of treatment, this OS result is considered sufficient for the 
current procedure. The MAH is recommended to provide the final OS results from study U302 post-
authorisation (PAM-REC). 
It is noted that very few patients progressed on treatment with T-DXd (1.1%) and the induced 
responses were durable, although median DOR was not reached in either arm. However, the DoR data 
is not mature, with 27.9% and 34.4% events in each arm, respectively. As updated confirmed ORR 
and DoR were not available during the procedure, the Applicant is recommended to submit updated 
clinical efficacy data at the time of the next OS analysis (currently projected 3Q2022) post-
authorisation, together with the results from the respective OS analysis (PAM-REC). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Almost all of the patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) in the pivotal study U302 and 
most of these were treatment-related. In the HER2-positive breast cancer pool, the most frequently 
observed events were nausea (77.8%), fatigue (56.6%), vomiting (49.5%), and neutropenia (38.1%). 
Treatment-related AE’s (ADR’s) with T-DXd were also nausea (74.9%), fatigue (51.5%), vomiting 
(43.6%), and neutropenia (37.3%) of almost the same incidences. Additional haematological toxicity 
was also very common, such as anaemia (29.5%), leukopenia (25.5%), and thrombocytopenia 
(23.8%). Gastrointestinal toxicity was markedly increased with T-DXd vs T-DM1, and besides vomiting 
(43.6% vs 5.7%), ADR’s of decreased appetite (29.1% vs 12.6%), diarrhoea (24.4% vs 3.8%) and 
constipation (21% vs 9.6%) were clinically significantly more commonly observed. Alopecia was much 
more frequent with T-DXd compared to T-DM1 (41.3% vs 3.1%). 
Grade 3 AEs in the BC pool were neutropenia (19.6%) and anaemia (8.1%). Treatment-related 
grade ≥3 events observed in more than 5% of the patients treated with T-DXd were neutropenia, 
anaemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, and fatigue. 
Adverse events of special interest of main clinical interest includes ILD/pneumonitis and in the 
HER2-positive breast cancer pool, 13.4% of the patients had an ILD/pneumonitis event and these 
events were most often of grade 2 (7.9%). The majority of these events were assessed to be 
treatment-related (12.6%) and often led to treatment discontinuation (9.4%). Nearly half of the 
events were resolved (46.8%) at DCO, but a third (30.6%) was not resolved and there were 6 fatal 
cases (9.7%) of ILD/pneumonitis. Left ventricular dysfunction is considered an important identified risk

based on what is known for trastuzumab. The incidences of grade 2 decrease of LVEF (13.5% and 
16.1%) or grade 3 decrease of LVEF (0.4% and 0.2%) were similar in the T-DXd arm and the BC pool, 
respectively. In the BC pool, 14.5% of the patients had a 10%-19% decrease in absolute value of 
LVEF, and only one patient had ≥20% increase in absolute value. All events except one with T-DXd 
were resolved at DCO. 
Overall, 22.8% of the patients had died, most commonly due to disease progression (16.3%) and 
rarely due to an adverse event (2%) or other/unknown reasons (1.8%/2.6%). The narratives for the 
patients who died from other causes in the pivotal study are agreed.  
Serious adverse events (SAE’s) were most commonly pertaining to ILD/pneumonitis (3.9%), 
pneumonia (2%), and vomiting (1.8%) in both the BC pool and this is in line with the severe toxicity 
observed in the pivotal study U302. 
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs in the BC pool was 15.7%, and of these, 14.7% of the 
patients discontinued due to treatment-related AEs. Most common AEs leading to discontinuation was 
ILD/pneumonitis in the BC pool (9.4%). 
Tolerability of T-DXd was lower than for T-DM1 which resulted in about twice as high number of drug 
discontinuations and dose interruptions/reductions. SAEs and ≥grade 3 events were reported in the 
same order of magnitude. The safety profile of T-DM1 is mainly characterized by thrombocytopenia 
(53.3%), and an increase of transaminases (AST increased: 40.2%, ALT increased: 29.5%), which is 
in line with what is presented in the SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Risk of ILD in patients with a history of noninfectious ILD/pneumonitis that required steroids is 
unknown as these were excluded from the trials. Proposed mitigating strategies for ILD (section 4.2 
and 4.4 SmPC, aRMM) are considered adequate to reduce the risk of severe/fatal ILD for these 
patients. 
No safety data are available in patients with severe renal impairment. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
Safety data in patients >75 years are limited. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
No safety data are available in patients with moderate/severe hepatic impairment whereas the safety 
profile may be different as the drug is primarily hepatically eliminated. A PK and safety study in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment is included in the RMP as post-authorisation commitment 
(see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal trial is PFS by BICR, which is a clinically relevant endpoint for this 
non-curative setting and acceptable for a single randomised phase 3 study. The efficacy of 
trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) compared to T-DM1 in the proposed second-line setting after one 
anti-HER2-based regimen is considered clinically meaningful, since the primary endpoint of PFS by 
BICR was markedly prolonged from 6.8 months to NE (with the lower bound of the 95% CI being 18.5 
months). As the treatment effect is so strong, the potential overestimation of the PFS results due to 
the interim analysis is considered to be limited. Updated PFS results will be provided post-marketing 
with the planned second interim analysis (PAM-REC). Results from the key secondary endpoint OS are 
immature. A detriment in OS is considered unlikely. Other secondary endpoints were supportive of a 
benefit of T-DXd treatment over T-DM1 treatment. Response rate (ORR) and duration of response 
(DoR) were also clinically significantly improved, with a more than doubling of the ORR from 34.2% to 
79.2%. These key efficacy results are observed after 15.9 months of follow-up. Moreover, since there

were a high number of PFS events in the control arm (~60%), the overall results are unlikely to 
change significantly with updated data. 
The safety profile of T-DXd was not changed with added safety data from the pivotal study U302 and 
the main reported adverse events of trastuzumab deruxtecan are still haematological and 
gastrointestinal toxicities, which were rarely of high grade and manageable by routine clinical practice 
guidelines and GI and haematological events are known side effects of topoisomerase inhibitors. The 
major safety concern remains to be the risk of ILD/pneumonitis (10.5%), which frequently led to drug 
discontinuation. It is reassuring that most events recovered and no new grade 4 or grade 5 (fatal) 
events occurred, likely due to enhanced awareness. When early recognized, low grade 
ILD/pneumonitis is manageable with dose modification and corticosteroid treatment in line with 
established clinical treatment guidelines (see section 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC).  
Overall, the safety profile of T-DXd is considered worse compared to T-DM1 and differences are not 
entirely explained by the difference in exposure time. Still, this is outweighed by the gain in efficacy. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The reported gain in PFS is clinically relevant and considered to outweigh the risks. It can be concluded 
that the benefit-risk balance is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Enhertu for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 
positive breast cancer, who have received one prior anti HER2 based regimen is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication for Enhertu to include treatment of adult patients with unresectable or 
metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based 
regimens; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 2.0 of the RMP has also been submitted. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/636117/2022  
Page 144/148 
 
 
 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 1).  
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Cayston 
aztreonam 
On 21 June 2012 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Cayston. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Gilead Sciences 
International Ltd. They may request a re examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify 
the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a change to an indication as follows2: 
“Cayston is indicated for the suppressive therapy of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 6 years and older. 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.” 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 
within 44 days (Type II variations) and 67 days (Annex II applications) from adoption of the opinion. 
2 The text in bold represents the new or the amended indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Atopic Dermatitis (AD) (eczema) is a chronic relapsing, pruritic, inflammatory skin disease that occurs 
most frequently in children but also occurs in adults. While in children, most cases of AD spontaneously 
resolve, AD can persist or start in adulthood (Thomsen 2014). It is estimated that in Europe, 2% to 
7% of adults have AD and the proportion of adults with moderate to severe AD is estimated at 30%, 
with 1 in 4 adults with AD reporting adult-onset of the disease (Sacotte and Silverberg 2018; Diepgen 
et al. 2016; Bieber and Straeter 2015). The pathomechanism of AD includes skin barrier defects, 
immune dysregulation, and genetic predisposition (Boguniewicz and Leung 2011). The main 
manifestations of AD are eczematous skin lesions, itch, skin pain, sleep disturbances, and other atopic 
conditions such as asthma and allergic rhinitis (Silverberg 2018). Itch is the central and debilitating 
manifestation. AD may lead to difficult to control scratching and superimposed skin inflammation and 
infections, sleep disturbances, functional impairment and mental distress, feelings of anxiety and 
depression (Jeon et al. 2017, Yu et al. 2016, Thyssen et al. 2019, Boguniewicz et al. 2017, Thyssen et 
al. 2018, Ronnstad et al. 2018).  
Management 
The aim of medical treatment of AD is symptomatic, to bring signs and symptoms of AD under control 
(Wollenberg et al. 2018). Patients with mild disease are generally managed with emollients and mild- 
to moderate-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS). Topical calcineurin inhibitors are considered as an 
alternative or adjunct treatment to TCS, especially when treatment with TCS is either inadvisable or 
not possible and when steroid-sparing treatment is needed in sensitive areas, such as face and skin 
folds. However, patients with moderate to severe AD require additional therapies to control their skin 
inflammation and alleviate the most bothersome symptoms. These additional therapies include 
phototherapy, high-potency TCS, and, eventually when topical options fail to control the disease, 
systemic treatments. 
Currently, 2 systemic therapies are approved for patients with moderate to severe AD: 
• 
• 
ciclosporin (an oral systemic agent approved only for severe patients), and 
dupilumab (SC injection). 
Ciclosporin is only approved for patients with severe AD and due to its safety profile, it is 
recommended for intermittent use (Ciclosporin SmPC). Dupilumab is approved for patients with 
moderate and severe AD; the most common side effects, when used in treatment of AD, are injection-
site reactions (≥10%), conjunctivitis and blepharitis (Dupixent EPAR). 
Staquis (an ointment with a PDE-4 inhibitor) was recently approved for treatment of mild to moderate 
atopic dermatitis in adults and paediatric patients from 2 years of age with ≤ 40% body surface area 
(BSA) affected. 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 9/158 
 
 
 
Other therapies are not centrally authorised but are approved in individual member states and 
recommended by AD treatment guidelines (Wollenberg et al. 2018): 
• 
• 
Oral glucocorticosteroids are intended for severe AD (Wollenberg et al. 2018). 
PUVA is intended for severe AD (Wollenberg et al. 2018). 
Non pharmacological approaches are recommended in moderate to severe AD according to AD 
treatment guidelines (Wollenberg et al. 2018). 
In addition to approved therapies, current AD guidelines and expert advice recommend off-label use of 
other oral therapies, such as systemic corticosteroids, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate 
mofetil (Wollenberg et al. 2018b).  
The MAH submitted an application for a new indication in “the treatment of moderate to severe atopic 
dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy”. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Baricitinib (Olumiant) is a Janus Kinase inhibitor with selectivity for JAK2 and JAK1, and less potency 
for JAK3 or TYK2. The JAKs and their associated signal transducers and activators of transcription 
(STATs) are the major intracellular pathway that controls the magnitude and duration of signalling for 
cytokines that bind to Type I and Type II cytokine receptors. These receptors lack intrinsic enzymatic 
activity capable of mediating signal transduction; so receptor-associated STATs are instead 
phosphorylated by JAKs, resulting in STAT activation. Activated STATs are active transcription factors 
and drive the expression of multiple genes important for cell activation, localisation, survival, and 
proliferation.  
Baricitinib has a low potency for JAK3. JAK3 may be more associated with the common gamma chain 
receptor, than the other JAKS. The common gamma chain cytokines include IL-15 and IL-21, which 
regulate lymphocyte activation, function, and proliferation. 
For patients with moderate to severe AD for whom treatment with TCS and or TCIs and/or systemic 
therapies is insufficient, treatment options are limited and therefore there is a need for new treatment 
options. An advantage for patients with moderate to severe AD may be that baricitinib is taken orally 
once daily, where dupilumab is administered by sc injection every-other-week. 
The JAK-STAT pathway is a major signal transduction pathway for several pro-inflammatory cytokines 
involved in the pathogenesis of AD, such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL-4, IL 5, IL 13, IL-22, and 
IL-31 (Brunner et al. 2017). Thus, interruption of JAK1 and JAK2 pathways by baricitinib could have 
therapeutic effects on signs and symptoms of AD. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH received Scientific advice from the CHMP on 15 December 2016 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/811151/2016). The Scientific advice pertained to non-clinical and clinical aspects of 
the dossier. 
The main clinical points of the advice were: 
• 
The strategy for dose-finding including the ongoing phase 2 study (JAHG) with 2 mg and 4 mg 
was agreed. 
•  Besides studying baricitinib as monotherapy, it should also be studied in combination with TCS 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 10/158 
 
 
 
and with TCI, as otherwise it will be difficult to judge the potential benefit of baricitinib in clinical 
practice. 
• 
The appropriate target population is patients with an insufficient response to topical treatments, 
which  should  be  well  documented.  Inclusion  of  patients  with  moderate  and  severe  AD  is 
acceptable. 
•  Rescue treatment should be provided in the pivotal studies and indication for rescue should be 
• 
• 
• 
appropriately standardised. 
The  sub-studies  in  the  maintenance  study,  on  randomised  withdrawal  and  on  lower-dose 
maintenance treatment, are welcomed, and also the possibility to assess late (after 16 weeks) 
response in initial non-responders. 
IGA  score  0  or  1  with  a  ≥2  point  improvement  from  baseline  is  acceptable  as  the  primary 
endpoint, while it would be expected that EASI 75 or SCORAD is a co-primary or key secondary 
endpoint. 
The use of PROs is welcomed. If they are not validated, the Applicant is encouraged to use this 
development program to validate the proposed PRO. 
The MAH implemented nearly all recommendations from the scientific advice.  
Notably, use of baricitinib with TCS while allowing for concomitant TCIs was evaluated in an additional 
study (JAIY). 
While the inclusion of an active comparator (e.g. ciclosporin) was suggested in the advice, the MAH 
chose not to. The reasoning by the MAH was mainly that the only widely approved systemic treatment 
is ciclosporin, which is indicated for severe AD only while baricitinib is intended for moderate and 
severe AD. Further, it was put forward that ciclosporin has side effects making dose 
adaptations/intermittent use necessary [ciclosporin SmPC]. This can be understood. Meanwhile, 
dupilumab had been approved for moderate to severe AD, and the MAH provided an indirect 
comparison with dupilumab clinical trials in the submission. Further, a study in AD patients with 
insufficient response to ciclosporin was added to the clinical programme in response to advice by HTA 
agencies. This study has meanwhile been finalised and was submitted upon CHMP request during this 
application. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Summary of Environmental Risk Assessment for the Use of Baricitinib in Europe 
Baricitinib  was  approved  in  the  European  Union  in  2017  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe 
rheumatoid arthritis. An environmental risk assessment was submitted as part of the initial marketing 
authorisation  application.  The  current  Type  II  variation  application  is  for  a  proposed  new  indication 
(atopic  dermatitis).  An  updated  environmental  risk  assessment  has  been  provided  that  considers 
environmental  exposure  due  to  both  the  original  and  proposed  indications.  The  environmental  data 
previously  submitted  with  the  initial  dossier  serves  as  the  basis  for  the  updated  environmental  risk 
assessment. 
Data from environmental chemistry, fate and toxicity studies and predictions of concentrations in the 
environment  were  considered  to  evaluate  the  risk  to  the  environment  from  the  therapeutic  use  of 
baricitinib  in  humans  in  Europe.  Physical-chemical  properties  and  fate  characteristics  indicate  that 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 11/158 
 
 
 
baricitinib will not persist in the aqueous environmental compartment since it undergoes some removal 
by binding to sludge biosolids during sewage treatment and by partitioning to sediment once in the water 
column. The concentrations of baricitinib in sediment would be very low. Baricitinib is subject to some 
removal from the sediment compartment through biodegradation and irreversible binding to sediment 
particles.  The  rate  of  removal  is  slow  and,  therefore,  there  is  some  potential  for  persistence  of  low 
concentrations  in  aquatic  sediment.  Using  assumptions  of  no  metabolism,  no  removal  during  sewage 
treatment,  and  1%  of  the  European  population  taking  the  maximum  dose,  the  maximum  predicted 
environmental concentration of total baricitinib residue in surface water is 0.04 μg/L and in sediment is 
152 μg/kg (dry weight). Studies to evaluate both acute and chronic effects on environmental species 
have been conducted with baricitinib. Fish was the most sensitive species tested. The predicted no-effect 
concentrations (PNECs) of baricitinib for surface water, groundwater, and sewage microorganisms were 
60,  210,  and  100000  μg/L,  respectively.  The  PNEC  for  sediment  was  27150  μg/kg.  The  predicted 
environmental concentrations of total residues of baricitinib are significantly lower than the PNEC values. 
Therefore, excretion by humans of baricitinib and its metabolites is not expected to result in a significant 
environmental  risk  to  aquatic  organisms.  Baricitinib  is  not  expected  to  bioaccumulate  in  aquatic 
organisms and it does not meet the criteria for classification as a toxic to aquatic organisms. Therefore, 
baricitinib is not classified as a PBT molecule.

2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
During the initial procedure at MAA, a full ERA of baricitinib was submitted, including the determination 
of physical-chemical properties, Phase I and II fate studies. The MAH has now, based on the new 
indication, recalculated the PECsw, which increased from 0.02 µg/L to 0.04 µg/L. The new PECsw 
exceeds the Phase I action limit of 0.01 µg/L. However, as this was already the case at the initial (first) 
indication at MAA, no additional ERA studies have to be performed. In addition, other PEC parameters, 
like groundwater, sediment and sewage treatment plant, changed, but this did not lead to a different 
conclusion on the low environmental risk of the use of baricitinib. Therefore, the initial conclusion as 
stated below, is maintained. 
Baricitinib is neither PBT nor vPvB. Considering the above data and the environmental risk assessment, 
baricitinib is not expected to pose a risk to the surface water and groundwater compartment and the 
sewage treatment plant. The revised values in the above table “Main ERA study results” have been 
endorsed by the CHMP.

2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of baricitinib. Considering the above data, baricitinib is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
No new information on non-clinical were submitted which was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Similar to Study JAIY, patients in Study JAIN are permitted to use low- and moderate-potency TCS as 
concomitant therapy throughout the study. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
At  time  of  MAA  for  rheumatoid  arthritis,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  baricitinib  were  investigated  in  27 
clinical in vivo PK studies after single (1-40 mg) and repeated dosing (up to 20 mg once daily for 10 
days, up to 15 mg once daily for 28 days, and up to 10 mg daily for 28 days). In addition, several in 
vitro studies with human biomaterials were performed to determine protein binding, metabolism, and 
the potential for baricitinib to cause DDIs. 
Three additional pharmacokinetics studies (studies JAHG, JAHL and JAHM) were performed in patients 
with atopic dermatitis. Dosages of 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg once daily were investigated. 
Analytical method 
The analytical methodology employed liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection 
(LC/MSMS) for analyses of baricitinib concentrations in plasma (method 8232103). The plasma samples 
were analysed at Covance Laboratories, Inc (Indianapolis, IN) which also measured plasma samples for 
the MAA of baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis.

Study JAHG is a Phase II randomised, double blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
baricitinib (2 mg and 4 mg once daily) versus placebo in combination with moderate potency topical 
corticoid steroid in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis for a treatment period of 16 
weeks. Baricitinib plasma concentrations were evaluated with sparse sampling approach (using a 
model previously validated for rheumatoid arthritis) and samples were obtained at Week 0 (pre-dose 
and 15-30 minutes after dosing), Week 4 (1.5-4 h after dosing), Week 8 (4-8 h after dosing), Week 12 
(pre-dose), and Week 16 (30-90 minutes after dosing). A total of 311 PK samples from 75 patients 
characterised the PK in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Only the AUC and Cmax at 
steady state following a dose of 4 mg were provided. No information was provided following a dose of 
2 mg. Furthermore, no information was provided on the clearance and half-life. 
Study JAHL is a Phase III randomised, double blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
baricitinib (1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg once daily) versus placebo in patients with moderate to severe atopic 
dermatitis for a treatment period of 16 weeks. Baricitinib plasma concentrations were evaluated with 
sparse sampling approach (using a model previously validated for rheumatoid arthritis) and samples 
were obtained at Week 0 (15 minutes and 1 hour post-dose), Week 4 (2 to 4 hour post-dose), Week 8 
(pre-dose), Week12 (pre-dose), and Week 16 (4 to 6 hours post-dose). A total of 1956 PK samples 
from 375 patients characterised the PK in patient with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. 
Study JAHM is a Phase III randomised, double blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
baricitinib (1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg once daily) versus placebo in patients with moderate to severe atopic 
dermatitis for a treatment period of 16 weeks. Baricitinib plasma concentrations were evaluated with 
sparse sampling approach (using a model previously validated for rheumatoid arthritis) and samples 
were obtained at Week 0 (15 minutes and 1 hour post-dose), Week 4 (2 to 4 hour post-dose), Week 8 
(pre-dose), Week 12 (pre-dose), and Week 16 (4 to 6 hours post-dose). A total of 1855 PK samples 
from 369 patients characterised the PK in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. 
The PK data from studies JAHG, JAHL and JAHM were used as input for the PopPK model for patients 
with atopic dermatitis to estimate the PK parameters of baricitinib in patients with atopic dermatitis. 
The PopPK analysis for patients with AD used the same PopPK model developed for the rheumatoid 
arthritis. A 2-compartment model with zero-order absorption and a partitioning of total CL/F into CLr/F 
and CLnr/F well described the PK of baricitinib in patients with atopic dermatitis. The model structure 
for CL/F was set up in this manner based on the knowledge that renal excretion represents the primary 
elimination route for baricitinib. The covariate retained in the final PopPK model was body weight on 
the volume term. The PK parameters obtained with the PopPK model are summarised in Table 5. 
Steady state Cmax,ss and AUCτ,ss in patients with atopic dermatitis were 0.86-fold of those seen in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis at the same dose based on PopPK modelling.

Previously, the pharmacokinetics of 2 mg and 5 mg baricitinib after repeated-dose once daily have 
been investigated in healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In healthy volunteers, the 
absolute bioavailability after oral administration of baricitinib from the commercial tablet was ~79%. 
The pharmacokinetics are summarised in Table 6 for healthy volunteers, Table 7 for patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis and Table 8 for patients with atopic dermatitis (per study).

Distribution 
Based on previous data, baricitinib is a low-to-moderate permeable drug. The plasma protein binding 
of baricitinib is ~50% and was independent of the concentration. The blood-to-plasma ratio is 1.14, 
indicating weak/moderate association with the blood cell compartment. In healthy volunteers the 
volume of distribution is ~1.1 L/kg, indicating that baricitinib distributes from the plasma compartment 
into tissues. The V/F was 108 L (CV%=19) in patients with rheumatoid dermatitis. 
In patients with atopic dermatitis, the V/F was 126 L (CV%=17) based on data from the three clinical 
PK studies. 
Elimination 
Based on previous data, absorbed baricitinib is mainly excreted via urine and predominately as parent 
compound. Baricitinib is metabolised to a limited extent both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, only 
baricitinib was detected circulating in plasma. Total metabolites accounted for 4-7% of the dose in 
urine and ~1% in faeces. Overall, these data indicate that metabolism does not significantly contribute 
to the clearance of baricitinib. In healthy subjects, the total clearance ranged from 15-17 L/h and the 
renal clearance is ~13.4 L/h. The elimination half-life of baricitinib is ~10 h in healthy volunteers and 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 17/158 
 
 
 
 
 
12.5 h in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The elimination data indicate that baricitinib is actively 
excreted into urine. This is supported by the transporter studies where baricitinib was identified as a 
substrate for the transporters P-glycoprotein, OAT3 and MATE2-K which are involved in the active 
excretion into urine. 
In patients with atopic dermatitis, the elimination half-life was 12.9 h based on the three clinical PK 
studies. Furthermore, the CL/F was 11.2 L/h and the renal clearance 8.02 L/h based on popPK. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Based on previous data, Cmax and AUC0-∞ increased dose-proportional over a single dose range of 1 to 
30 mg and a slightly more than dose-proportional increase is observed over the dose range 30 to 40 
mg in healthy subjects. In rheumatoid arthritis patients, the Cmax is dose proportional over a dose 
range of 2 to 15 mg baricitinib administered once daily. AUC is slightly less then dose proportional over 
a dose range of 2 to 15 mg baricitinib administered once daily, but dose proportional over the clinical 
dose range of 2 to 4 mg. Following multiple once-daily dosing over the range of 2 to 20 mg, baricitinib 
exposure at steady state increases slightly less than dose-proportional. After multiple once-daily 
dosing, steady state was reached between the second and third dose. Accumulation after repeated-
dose administration of baricitinib is minimal; the accumulation ratio ranged from 0.89-1.25-fold and 
1.02-1.24-fold based on Cmax and AUC, respectively. 
No new data was provided on the dose proportionality in patients with atopic dermatitis over the dose 
range of 1 mg to 4 mg. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Based on previous data, the intra-individual variability in healthy subjects is low (<14%) and the inter-
individual variability moderate (17-26%) in healthy subjects. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the 
inter-individual variability is 41% for the AUC and 22% for the Cmax. 
Based on the clinical PK data in patients with atopic dermatitis, the inter-individual variability was 50% 
for the AUC and 21% for the Cmax in patients with atopic dermatitis. 
Special populations 
Previously, a reduction in baricitinib renal clearance and an increase in the AUC was observed with 
increased severity of renal impairment in healthy subjects. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a less 
pronounced effect of the renal function on the exposure of baricitinib was observed. This is consistent 
with a reduced fraction of excretion out of the total elimination pathways of baricitinib in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy subjects. The systemic exposure to baricitinib in subjects 
with moderate hepatic impairment were comparable with subjects with normal hepatic function. The 
observed lack of hepatic function on the clearance of baricitinib is in-line with the renal clearance as 
the parent compound and that <10% of the dose is excreted as metabolite. In rheumatoid arthritis, 
body weight affects the PK of baricitinib; Cmax decreased with increasing body weight. However, the 
effect of body weight on baricitinib PK is not considered clinically relevant and a higher dose is not 
recommended. Gender and race (American versus Japanese) were shown to have an effect (not 
clinically relevant) on the PK of baricitinib inpatients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, this is most 
likely caused by differences in body weight between the groups. The PK of baricitinib is similar across 
the age range of 19 to 83 years in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The Erythrocyte Sedimentation 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 18/158 
 
 
 
Rate (measure of disease state in rheumatoid arthritis patients) had an effect on the renal clearance of 
baricitinib but did not have a clinically significant effect on the exposure to baricitinib. 
In patients with atopic dermatitis, body weight and renal function were also significant covariates for 
the PK. Age and race did not have an effect on the PK of baricitinib. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No new DDI studies have been performed in patients with atopic dermatitis which was considered 
acceptable to CHMP. At the time of MAA for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, several DDI studies 
have been performed to identify clinically relevant DDIs with baricitinib as perpetrator and as victim. 
Baricitinib as perpetrator 
Based on in vitro data, it can be concluded that baricitinib is not a CYP inhibitor or inducer at clinically 
relevant concentrations. Furthermore, baricitinib is not an inhibitor of the transporters P-glycoprotein, 
BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, OAT2, OAT3, MATE-1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Baricitinib may be an inhibitor of OCT1 at maximal portal vein concentrations. 
Concomitant administration of baricitinib with drugs for which the rate limiting step is hepatic uptake 
by OCT1, may lead to an increase in Cmax. In clinical DDI studies, the potential of baricitinib to affect 
the PK of oral contraceptives (via CYP3A), simvastatin (via CYP3A and OATP1B1), and digoxin (via P-
glycoprotein) was investigated. The clinical DDI studies confirm the in vitro data that baricitinib is not 
an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A and not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Concomitant administration of 
baricitinib with simvastatin led to a (not clinically significant) decrease in AUC and Cmax of simvastatin. 
The mechanism of action causing the observed decrease after concomitant administration of baricitinib 
(multiple dosing) with simvastatin is unknown. 
In the clinical safety studies, an effect on the creatinine clearance was observed (decrease in creatinine 
clearance). Creatinine is cleared by the following transporters OCT2, OAT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. 
Baricitinib was not an inhibitor of these transporters at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, 
the mechanism of action causing the observed decrease after concomitant administration of baricitinib 
on the creatinine clearance is unknown. 
Baricitinib as victim 
Baricitinib does not have an effect on the PK of methotrexate, a commonly concomitant prescribed 
drug, in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients. 
In vitro and in vivo data indicate that less then 10% of the baricitinib dose is metabolised. Baricitinib is 
actively excreted by the transporters P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OAT3 and MATE2-K. In clinical DDI studies, 
the potential of other drugs to affect the PK of baricitinib was investigated. Co-administration of 
ketoconazole (strong CYP3A inhibition), fluconazole (strong CYP2C19 inhibition and moderate CYP2C9 
and 3A inhibition), rifampicin (inducer via CAR/PXR of among others CYP3A and P-glycoprotein) and 
ciclosporin (P-glycoprotein inhibition) with baricitinib did not have a clinically relevant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of baricitinib. A clinically significant interaction was observed when baricitinib was 
co-administered with probenecid (an OAT3 inhibitor). No other clinical DDI studies have been 
conducted with OAT3 inhibitors with less inhibition potential. The prodrug leflunomide rapidly converts 
to teriflunomide and teriflunomide is an inhibitor of OAT3 (furosemide exposure was increased in 
patients concomitantly taking teriflunomide and furosemide). Therefore, concomitant administration of 
baricitinib with leflunomide or teriflunomide may lead to an increase in baricitinib exposure. 
Concomitant use of ibuprofen and diclofenac will most likely have no clinically meaningful effect on the 
PK of baricitinib, since their inhibition potential for OAT3 is too weak. No studies were performed for 
inhibition of BCRP and MATE2-K. Complete inhibition of BCRP in the intestine may lead to a 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 19/158 
 
 
 
bioavailability 100% which may result in an AUC increase of 1.25. This is considered clinically not 
relevant. Furthermore, the clinical significance of an interaction at MATE2-K would be minimised given 
the multiple exit routes of baricitinib from the proximal tubule cell. Maximal inhibition of MATE-2K will 
lead to a less than 2-fold increase in AUC of baricitinib, because other transporters can compensate for 
the lack of function. Therefore, inhibition of MATE-2K is likely not clinically relevant. Increase in gastric 
pH does not affect the overall exposure to baricitinib. Therefore, baricitinib may be co-administered 
with drugs that are gastric pH modifying agents. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of Action  
Baricitinib is an orally available JAK inhibitor with potency and selectivity for JAK1 and JAK2 and less 
potency for tyrosine kinase 2 or JAK3 (Fridman et al. 2010). The JAK-STAT pathway is a major signal 
transduction pathway for numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in AD pathogenesis, such as 
thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-4, IL 5, IL 13, IL-22, and IL-31 (Brunner et al. 2017). The 
cytokines signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway play a role in regulating many immune system 
responses that influence AD (Nomura and Kabashima 2016) such as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
immune response, including exaggeration of T-helper 2 cell response (Boguniewicz and Leung 
2011) 
activation of eosinophils

• 
increased keratinocyte pSTAT3 levels (Lee et al. 2016; Mitamura et al. 2018), and 
barrier function abnormalities, such as decreased filaggrin levels (Thyssen and Kezic 2014). 
Considering the numerous cytokines associated with AD pathogenesis, it is hypothesised that the 
interruption of JAK1 and JAK2 pathways by baricitinib would have significant therapeutic effects for 
both signs and symptoms of AD. 
Primary Pharmacodynamics in AD 
The overall pharmacodynamic properties and mechanism of action of baricitinib based on blood-based 
pharmacodynamics studies was described in the marketing authorisation application for RA. These 
studies show that baricitinib inhibits JAK1 and JAK2 activity thereby, interfering with the cytokine-
mediated signaling through JAK1 and JAK2 phosphorylation, and the subsequent activation of STAT 
proteins. Upon phosphorylation, pSTAT translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and activates 
transcription in many cells.  
In order to evaluate the use of baricitinib in AD, 2 approaches were pursued to specifically assess the 
activity of baricitinib in the skin of AD patients and explore the mechanism of action of baricitinib in 
AD, namely: 
•  Skin biopsies: Elevated pSTAT3 levels are associated with increased inflammation in AD (Lee et 
al. 2012; Lee et al. 2016; Mitamura et al. 2018). pSTAT3 levels were assessed in skin biopsies 
from the lesional skin of patients in the AD Phase 2 Study JAHG at baseline and Week 4. 
Treatment with baricitinib reduced pSTAT3 levels at Week 4. The reduction in pSTAT3 levels 
were greater amongst patients achieving EASI50 improvements compared to patients that did

not achieve EASI50 improvement, confirming the pharmacodynamics effect of baricitinib and 
pSTAT3 levels in patients with AD. 
• 
Ex-vivo skin model: A 3-dimensional AD-like human skin model was generated by exposing 
human skin equivalents to a combination of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31. 
o 
In this model, pathological changes consistent with AD, and elevated levels of 
epidermal keratinocyte pSTAT3 were reduced with the presence of baricitinib.  
o  Filaggrin is a protein that plays a role in skin barrier function and in the pathogenesis 
of AD (Thyssen et al. 2014). The presence of baricitinib in the human skin model 
enhanced constitutive filaggrin expression as detected by immunohistochemical 
staining and quantitative microscopic evaluation. While the addition of the 
aforementioned cytokine cocktail reduced filaggrin expression, treatment with 
baricitinib produced a filaggrin increase by epidermal keratinocytes.  
Taken together, these results support the conclusion that baricitinib, via inhibition of JAK/STAT 
signalling, reduces pathological changes induced by numerous cytokines that contribute to AD 
inflammation.  
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The PK data from studies JAHG, JAHL and JAHM were used as input for the PopPK model for patients 
with atopic dermatitis to estimate the PK parameters of baricitinib in patients with atopic dermatitis. 
The PopPK analysis for patients with atopic dermatitis used the same PopPK model developed for 
rheumatoid arthritis. A 2-compartment model with zero-order absorption and a partitioning of total 
CL/F into CLr/F and CLnr/F well described the PK of baricitinib in patients with atopic dermatitis. In 
patients with atopic dermatitis, the Cmax and AUC at steady state are 124 nM and 1117 nM × h, 
respectively, at the clinically relevant dose of 4 mg. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The analytical method used to measure baricitinib in plasma samples from patients with atopic 
dermatitis was the same used for the original MAA for rheumatoid arthritis. The LC-MS/MS methods 
used for the analysis of baricitinib in plasma was considered sufficiently validated by the CHMP. 
PK data from patients with atopic dermatitis was only obtained through sparse sampling. Therefore, 
information on tmax is not available and can, therefore not be compared between the different groups. 
However, based on the physiology and disease, no difference in tmax is expected between the different 
groups. After oral administration of baricitinib to healthy subjects, maximal plasma levels were reached 
~1 h after dosing (range = 0.5-3.0 h). 
The MAH included subjects with moderate renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2) and normal 
renal function in the estimation of the PK parameters from studies JAHG, JAHL and JAHM. Since renal 
impairment previously was identified as having a clinically significant effect on the PK, the Applicant 
was requested to recalculate the PK parameters for subjects with normal renal function and exclude 
subjects with moderate renal impairment. Only 6 subjects with moderate renal impairment were 
included (<1% of the total population) in the response. The impact of these few subjects was too 
limited to affect the calculated PK parameters. This issue was therefore no longer pursue by the CHMP. 
However, renal function and body weight had an effect on the PK of baricitinib in patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 21/158 
 
 
 
rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis. For both patient groups, the effect of body weight on the PK 
is not considered clinically relevant. Renal function has a clinically significant effect on the PK, and for 
both patient groups, a dose reduction is advised if a patient has a moderate renal function (GFR 
between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73m2) in line with the existing recommendation for RA in Section 4.2 of 
the SmPC. As for RA, baricitinib is not recommended for use in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 
mL/min (see section 5.2). This proposal is acceptable to CHMP. 
At the MAA for rheumatoid arthritis, the developed PopPK model was suitable to predict the PK in 
healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Also, the model is suitable to predict the effect 
of renal function, hepatic function, race, age, weight, gender and Baseline Erythrocyte Sedimentation 
Rate on the PK of baricitinib. The same PopPK model was used for atopic dermatitis which is acceptable 
to the CHMP. Based on the PopPK model the following PK parameters were estimated for subjects with 
normal renal function: 
•  After oral administration of baricitinib to healthy subjects, the Cmax is 53 and ~112 nM, 
respectively and the AUC0-∞ is 342 and 740 nM × h, respectively, at the proposed dose of 2 
and 4 mg. The elimination half-life of baricitinib is ~8 h.  
• 
• 
In rheumatoid arthritis patients, the Cmax and AUC at steady state are ~135 nM and 1200 nM 
× h, respectively, at the clinically relevant dose of 4 mg. 
In patients with atopic dermatitis, the Cmax and AUC at steady state are 124 nM and 1117 nM 
× h, respectively, at the clinically relevant dose of 4 mg. 
The CHMP concluded that the Cmax, ss and AUCτ, ss tend to be lower in patients with atopic dermatitis 
compared to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (factor 0.8) and higher compared to healthy volunteers 
(not assessed by the MAH) at the clinically relevant dose of 4 mg. The Section 5.2 of the SmPC was 
updated accordingly. 
Baricitinib can be taken independent of food. A low-fat meal led to a 14% decrease in AUC0-∞ and a 
12% decrease in Cmax. The 90% CIs were entirely contained within the 0.8 to 1.25 limits for 
bioequivalence, indicating that a low-fat meal has no significant effect in the pharmacokinetics of 
baricitinib. A high-fat meal decreased the AUC by 11% and the Cmax by 18%. The 90% CIs of the AUC 
were within the 0.8 to 1.25 limits for bioequivalence. The 90% CIs of the Cmax were outside the limits 
for bioequivalence; below the 0.8 limit. However, considering that the proposed product is designed for 
chronic treatment and the AUCs are within the 0.8 to 1.25 limits for bioequivalence, the CHMP agreed 
that this will most likely not lead to a clinically relevant effect on the exposure. Therefore, in line with 
RA patients, food is not expected to significantly affect the PK of baricitinib in patients with atopic 
dermatitis. 
PopPK resulted in a Vd/F of 126 L in patients with atopic dermatitis. The Vd is ~159 L in patients with 
atopic dermatitis when correcting for the absolute bioavailability and assuming similar bioavailability in 
the different populations (~79%). The Vd in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (137 L) is smaller than 
that in patients with atopic dermatitis. When assuming an average body weight of 70 kg, the Vd is 2.3 
L/kg in patients with atopic dermatitis and 2.0 L/kg in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The volume 
of distribution is lowest in healthy volunteers (~1.1 L/kg) and highest in patients with atopic 
dermatitis. 
PopPK resulted in a CL/F of 11.2 L/h in patients with atopic dermatitis (typical patient with normal 
renal function and body weight of 73 kg). The CL/Fin patients with rheumatoid arthritis (9.42 L/h) is 
slower than that in patients with atopic dermatitis (~19% difference). This is reflected in Section 5.2 of 
the SmPC. When correcting for the absolute bioavailability (~79%), the CL is ~8.8 L/h, which is lower 
than the clearance in healthy subjects (15 L/h). 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 22/158 
 
 
 
Renal clearance (when correcting for the absolute bioavailability) is 10.5 L/h in healthy subjects, 6.4 
L/h in patients with atopic dermatitis and 5.4 L/h in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This difference 
can be explained due to the difference in renal function, which was decreased in subjects with 
rheumatoid arthritis. 
The elimination half-life of baricitinib is ~10 h in healthy volunteers and 12.5 h in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis and 12.9 h in patients with atopic dermatitis based on PopPK modelling. This 
indicates that the elimination is more rapid in healthy volunteers compared to the patient population. 
Baricitinib increases dose-proportional over the clinical dose range of 2 to 4 mg. Following once-daily 
dosing, steady-state is reached between the 2nd and 3rd dose and accumulation is negligible. 
Data in atopic dermatitis patients confirm the dose proportionality shown in healthy subjects and 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
The inter-individual variability in exposure in the patient population (rheumatoid arthritis and atopic 
dermatitis) is higher compared to healthy volunteers (17-26% versus 41-50%). 
In general, the CHMP assumes that the DDI risk with baricitinib as victim and as perpetrator is 
independent of the disease since similar dosages were administered. 
Baricitinib is not a CYP inhibitor or inducer at clinically relevant concentrations. Furthermore, baricitinib 
is not an inhibitor of the transporters P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, OAT2, 
OAT3, MATE-1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. Baricitinib may be an inhibitor of 
OCT1 at maximal portal vein concentrations. However, the frequently concomitant oral drugs in 
patients with atopic dermatitis are not OCT1 substrates, and therefore no DDIs are expected with 
frequently concomitant medication in patients with atopic dermatitis. 
Baricitinib is actively excreted by the transporters P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OAT3 and MATE2-K. A 
clinically significant interaction was observed when baricitinib was co-administered with an OAT3 
inhibitor, but not with inhibitors of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A and P-glycoprotein inhibition and 
inducers via CAR/PXR. Furthermore, inhibition of BCRP and MATE-2K is considered clinically not 
relevant. The frequently concomitant oral drugs in patients with atopic dermatitis are not inhibitors of 
OAT3 and therefore no DDIs are expected with frequently concomitant medication in patients with 
atopic dermatitis. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Baricitinib inhibits JAK1 and JAK2 kinase activity thereby interfering with the cytokine-mediated 
signalling through JAK1 and JAK2 phosphorylation, leading to an inhibition of phosphorylation of 
transcription factor STAT3 (pSTAT3) and subsequent inactivation pSTAT3. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
that signal via the JAK-STAT pathway, are implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. This inhibition of 
pSTAT3 has been shown in blood cells, suggesting a role in reducing inflammation, cellular activation, 
and proliferation of key immune cells as described in the marketing authorisation application for RA.  
The JAK-STAT pathway is also implicated as a major signal transduction pathway for numerous pro-
inflammatory cytokines involved in AD pathogenesis, such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-
4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-22, and IL-31 and elevated levels of pSTAT3 are found in keratinocytes from lesional 
AD skin and in cytokine-treated keratinocytes monolayer cultures. 
In a three-dimensional human skin model using neonatal human skin keratinocytes overlaid on a 
collagen matrix embedded with fibroblasts, a cocktail of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, IL-
31) induced Atopic Dermatitis-like effects, such as diminished keratinocyte pSTAT3 expression, 
granular cell layer and increased spongiosis. Baricitinib, both without and with these cytokines, was 
Assessment report

found to inhibit pSTAT3 formation, which is indicative of JAK inhibition, and to increase filaggrin 
expression, which is suggested to play a role in skin barrier function and in the pathogenesis of atopic 
dermatitis. Baricitinib was without significant effects on the skin (granular or spongiosis) layer 
thickness.  
The effect of baricitinib on the skin after 4 and 16 weeks of treatment was studied in lesional and non-
lesional skin biopsies from TCS non-responding AD patients, given TCS combined with placebo, 2 mg 
or with 4 mg baricitinib (Phase 2 Study JAHG). Baricitinib treatment was found to decrease the pSTAT3 
expression in skin biopsies as compared to baseline but no statistical significance was reached as 
compared to placebo after 4 or 16 weeks treatment although the decrease in pSTAT3 staining seemed 
to be stronger in the EASI-50 responders correlating with clinical response. 
These in vitro data indicate that in human skin (keratinocytes) baricitinib inhibits the JAK/STAT 
pathway leading to increases in filaggrin expression, which may be beneficial for AD patients given its 
presumed role in AD pathogenesis. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In patients with atopic dermatitis, the Cmax and AUC at steady state are 124 nM and 1117 nM × h, 
respectively, at the clinically relevant dose of 4 mg. The Cmax,ss and AUCτ,ss tend to be lower in 
patients with atopic dermatitis compared to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (factor 0.8) and higher 
compared to healthy volunteers at the clinically relevant dose of 4 mg. In addition, mean apparent 
clearance (CL/F) and half-life in patients with atopic dermatitis was 11.2 L/hr (CV = 33.0%) and 
12.9 hrs (CV = 36.0%), respectively. Section 5.2 of the SmPC was updated accordingly. 
Baricitinib may be an inhibitor of OCT1 at maximal portal vein concentrations and may lead to clinically 
relevant DDIS. The frequently concomitant oral drugs in patients with atopic dermatitis are not OCT1 
substrates, and therefore no DDIs are expected with frequently concomitant medication in patients 
with atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, baricitinib is actively excreted by OAT3, and a clinically relevant 
DDI was observed with probenecid. The frequently concomitant oral drugs in patients with atopic 
dermatitis are not inhibitors of OAT3, and therefore no DDIs are expected with frequently concomitant 
medication in patients with atopic dermatitis. However, combination with ciclosporin or other potent 
immunosuppressants has not been studied and is not recommended. This is adequately reflected in the 
Section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC. 
In an in-vitro human skin model treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-4, IL-13, IL-31), 
baricitinib reduced epidermal keratinocyte pSTAT3 expression, and increased the expression of 
filaggrin, a protein that plays a role in skin barrier function and in the pathogenesis of atopic 
dermatitis. Section 5.1 of the SmPC was updated accordingly. 
The CHMP considered that the application was acceptable from a clinical pharmacology perspective. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The MAH performed a single ‘phase 2’ dose-finding and proof-of-concept study, comparing baricitinib 2 
mg and 4 mg once daily against placebo.

“A Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 2 Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Baricitinib in Patients with Moderate-to-
Severe Atopic Dermatitis (JAHG)” 
Dose selection 
Dose selection for this study was based on the results of ‘phase 2’ and ‘phase 3’ studies in RA (JADA, 
JADW, JADX) and a ‘phase 2’ study in psoriasis (JADP). It was considered by the MAH that the 2 mg 
and 4 mg doses have shown efficacy in RA with an acceptable safety profile, while there was no 
additional efficacy associated with an 8-mg dose in the ‘phase 2’ RA study. In patients with psoriasis, 
doses of 4 mg to 10 mg showed reductions in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score, with 
greater efficacy at the higher doses. The dose of 2 mg was not effective on PASI but was effective on 
itch. Doses of 8 mg and 10 mg were associated with a higher rate of AEs related to laboratory 
abnormalities. 
Methods 
Design 
Study JAHG was a randomised, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, multicentre, 16-week study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib 2 mg and baricitinib 4mg versus placebo, in combination 
with  moderate-potency  TCS.  Primary  outcome  was  EASI50  at  week  16;  secondary  outcomes  were 
EASI75, IGA 0 or 1, itch NRS and DLQI.

Design of study JAHG 
Study participants 
Patients were included if they were 18 years or older and had AD for at least 2 years. They should have 
moderate  to  severe  AD,  as  defined  by  an  EASI  score  ≥12  and  a  BSA  ≥10%,  while  having  had  an

inadequate response to previous AD therapies. This was defined as a history of inadequate response to 
at least 1 of the following 3 categories of AD treatments, after at least 4 weeks of use: 
1)  Emollient plus TCS, or antibiotics, or topical immune modulators such as TCIs 
2)  Systemic steroids or phototherapy 
3)  Ciclosporin or other systemic immunomodulators. 
Treatments 
Patients received baricitinib 2 mg QD, baricitinib 4 mg QD, or placebo QD, for 16 weeks. Blinding was 
maintained using double-dummies.  
In the 4 weeks prior to randomisation, patients had to use triamcinolone 0.1% cream (moderate potency 
TCS) as supplied by the investigator, and continue this use throughout the 16 weeks of study. (Patients 
were  not  included  if  they  improved  in  those  4  weeks  and  at  time  of  randomisation  did  not  meet  the 
inclusion  criteria  anymore.)  Other  AD  treatments  were  to  be  stopped  at  least  4  weeks  before 
randomisation: potent TCS or TCIs; systemic therapies; phototherapy. Patients had to apply emollients 
throughout the study. 
It was not foreseen in rescue treatment. 
Outcomes 
Primary outcome was the proportion of patients with at least a 50% change from baseline to week 16 in 
Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score (EASI50).  
Secondary  outcomes  were  amongst  others:  EASI75;  the  proportion  of  patients  with  an  Investigator’s 
Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1; mean change in itch severity on a NRS; mean change from 
baseline  in  Dermatology  Life  Quality  Index  (DLQI).  (See  the  main  studies  for  further  explanation  of 
outcomes.) 
Statistical methods 
The analyses for efficacy were based on the ITT population. NRI was applied to missing values of the 
primary outcome and other categorical outcomes. A step-wise testing strategy was employed for testing 
the primary outcome (EASI50) of the two dose groups against placebo at an α of 5%. 
Results 
Participant flow 
There  were  187  patients  screened  and  124  patients  were  randomised  to  one  of  the  three  treatment 
groups (Figure 2). All randomised patients had received at least 1 dose of study drug. In total, 85 (69%) 
patients completed the 16 week study period. Most patients discontinued in the placebo and 2 mg groups, 
with lack of efficacy as a frequent reason. Of the 5 patients in the placebo group who discontinued due 
to an AE, 2 of the 5 AEs were aggravated AD. The most frequent reason for discontinuation for baricitinib 
4-mg was an AE, usually laboratory abnormalities.

Outcomes and estimation 
All 124 randomised patients were included in the efficacy analyses (ITT). In the baricitinib groups, nearly 
all patients were ≥80% compliant with study medication; in the placebo group 90% of patients were 
compliant. 
The proportion of patients reaching EASI50 at week 16 (primary outcome) was 61% in the baricitinib 4 
mg group, 57% in the baricitinib 2 mg group, and 37% in the placebo group (Figure 3). The difference 
between baricitinib 4 mg and placebo was statistically significant (p=0.027) and the difference between 
baricitinib 2 mg and placebo was not statistically significant (p=0.065). 
At weeks 4, 8 and 12, the differences in EASI50 of 2 mg and 4 mg versus placebo (secondary outcomes) 
were  statistically  significant  (without  application  of  correction  for  multiplicity).  The  placebo  response 
increased  numerically  over  time,  the  responses  in  the  baricitinib  groups  remained  numerically  stable 
after week 4 (Figure 3). 
At week 16, the responses in EASI75, IGA 0 or 1, and itch NRS were numerically larger in the baricitinib 
treated  groups  as  compared  to  the  responses  in  the  placebo  group,  but  the  differences  were  not 
statistically significant (Table 10). Statistically significant differences at week 16 appeared for the change 
in the continuous EASI score, SCORAD75 and DLQI 0 or 1. The responses in the baricitinib groups were 
numerically similar (Table 10). Numerical differences in IGA 0 or 1 (the CHMP noted that it was similar 
to the primary outcome in the following pivotal studies) of baricitinib 4 mg compared to placebo appeared 
from week 4.

Efficacy results at week 16 of study JAHG 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
In the three 16-week ‘phase 3’ studies (JAHL, JAHM, JAIY), three oral doses of baricitinib were evaluated 
against placebo: 1-mg, 2-mg, and 4-mg once daily (also see Table 2). These doses were primarily chosen 
based on the results of ‘phase 2’ study JAHG. In the first 52-week period of the long-term extension 
study (JAHN) all three doses of baricitinib were evaluated (Table 2). Patients were mainly recruited from 
JAHL, JAHM and JAIY.

and Safety of Baricitinib in Combination with Topical Corticosteroids in Adult Patients with Moderate to

Design and objectives  
Studies JAHL and JAHM were identically designed as a 16-week, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, outpatient study evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib 1-
mg QD, 2-mg QD, and 4-mg QD as compared to placebo (1:1:1:2) in adult patients with moderate to 
severe AD and a history of inadequate response or intolerance to available topical AD therapies (Figure 
4).

The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that baricitinib 4-mg once daily or baricitinib 2-mg once 
daily  is  superior  to  placebo  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  AD.  The  primary 
endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 with a 2 or more point improvement at 
Week 16. A key secondary objective was to test the hypothesis that baricitinib 1-mg once daily is superior 
to placebo in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe AD. 
Study  JAIY  is  a  16-week  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group, 
outpatient study evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib 2-mg QD + TCS, and 4-mg QD + TCS 
as compared to placebo + TCS (1:1:1) in adult patients with moderate to severe AD and a history of 
inadequate response to available topical therapies (Figure 5). 
The primary objective of study JAIY was to test the hypothesis that baricitinib 4-mg once daily plus TCS 
or baricitinib 2-mg once daily plus TCS is superior to placebo plus TCS in the treatment of patients with 
moderate to severe AD. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 
with a 2 or more point improvement at Week 16.

Methods 
Study participants 
Studies JAHL and JAHM had identical inclusion and exclusion criteria, aiming at an adult population with 
moderate to severe AD and a recent history of inadequate response/intolerance to topical AD therapies. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for study JAIY were very similar, with the exception that patients 
with intolerance to TCS were excluded while TCS was to be used concomitantly. 
Key inclusion criteria were: 
•  Age of 18 years or older with a diagnosis of AD [Eichenfield et al. 2014] for at least 12 months 
prior to screening. 
•  Moderate to severe AD with an EASI score ≥16, an IGA ≥3 and a BSA involvement ≥10%. 
•  Have a history of inadequate response to/intolerance to topical AD therapies within 6 months 
prior to screening, defined by at least 1 of the following: 
-  Not having achieved at least mild disease with TCS of at least moderate potency for at 
least 4 weeks. 
-  Failure  of  systemic  AD  therapies,  such  as:  ciclosporin,  methotrexate,  azathioprine,  or 
mycophenolate mofetil. 
-  Clinically significant adverse reactions with the use of TCS, such as: skin atrophy, allergic 
reactions, or systemic effects (JAHL, JAHM).  
Key exclusion criteria were: 
• 
Previous or concomitant conditions that may have confounded efficacy and safety assessments 
or increased the risks to patients. This included: psoriasis, SLE, active skin infection, history of 
eczema herpeticum, recurrent or recent VTE, current or recent serous infection.

Treatments 
Investigational treatments 
Patients could receive baricitinib 1 mg QD, 2 mg QD, baricitinib 4 mg QD, or placebo QD, for 16 weeks. 
The investigational treatment was packed in blisters. Blinding was maintained using double dummies. In 
studies JAHL and JAHM patients therefore had to take 3 tablets daily (e.g. one 4 mg baricitinib tablet 
and matching placebo of the 2 mg and 1 mg baricitinib tablets). 
Compliance 
Patient compliance with investigational treatment was assessed by pill count at each visit. If a patient at 
his/her own intention had missed more than 20% of doses of study drug, or had taken more than 20% 
of study drug, he/she was considered significantly noncompliant. 
Concomitant treatments 
Other AD treatments were to be stopped between 2 or 4 weeks before randomisation: topical therapies 
except emollients, systemic therapies, phototherapy and sedating antihistamines. In the 2 weeks prior 
to randomisation, patients had to use emollients daily and continue this use throughout the study (but 
not on the day of a study visit). 
In combination study JAIY, patients were instructed to start with the use of a moderate-potency TCS 
(such as triamcinolone 0.1% cream) once daily until lesions were clear or almost clear. Then, patients 
should switch to a low potency TCS (hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment) and treat previously affected areas 
for another 7 days and then stop. If lesions reappeared, treatment with the moderate- or low-potency 
TCS  was  to  be  resumed.  In  addition,  the  use  of  TCI’s  (or  Crisaborole,  a  topical  PDE-4  inhibitor)  was 
permitted to treat areas with sensitive skin (e.g. face, neck, skin folds, genital areas). 
Rescue treatments 
Rescue  treatment  was  allowed  for  patients  who  were  experiencing  unacceptable  or  worsening  AD 
symptoms at any time (JAHL, JAHM) or after 2 weeks from baseline (JAIY). 
In studies JAHL and JAHM, first-line rescue treatment was topical treatment with a moderate-potency 
TCS (triamcinolone 0.1% cream) and/or a low-potency TCS (hydrocortisone 2.5%). If patients did not 
improve sufficiently after 7 days of use, they could switch to a higher potency TCS. 
In combination study JAIY, high- or ultra-high potency TCS could be used as first-line rescue treatment. 
In  all  three  studies,  second-line  rescue  treatment  was  oral  systemic  treatment,  such  as  oral 
corticosteroids or ciclosporin. Then, investigational treatment was discontinued for the remainder of the 
study (but patients remained eligible for the long term extension study JAHN). 
Outcomes 
The primary outcome for the three 16-week ‘phase 3’ studies (JAHL, JAHM, JAIY) was the proportion of 
patients  achieving  an  Investigator’s  Global  Assessment  (IGA)  score  of  0  or  1,  with  at  least  a  2-point 
improvement from baseline at Week 16 (here referred to as IGA 0 or 1). IGA assesses the clinician’s 
impression of overall disease severity at a single time point. It does not specifically measure the extent 
of AD, although for patients to be considered severe, they must have widespread disease. An IGA score 
of 0 or 1 equates to skin that is ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ from AD signs (Figure 6). 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 32/158 
 
 
 
IGA is a commonly used scale in AD clinical studies (Futamura et al. 2016). For the ‘phase 3’ trials a 
common  validated  version  was  used  (vIGA-AD™;  International  Eczema  Council  2017)  and  all 
investigators underwent training and certification with this version. 
Figure 6 
Description of the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score. 
The key secondary outcomes were: Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI); Itch NRS; Atopic Dermatitis 
Sleep  Scale  (ADSS);  Skin  pain  NRS;  SCORing  Atopic  Dermatitis  (SCORAD).  Additional  secondary 
outcomes  were  amongst  others:  Dermatology  Life  Quality  Index  (DLQI);  body  surface  area  affected 
(BSA); Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM); and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). 
The EASI is a validated, investigator-assessed, composite scale that assesses the extent and severity of 
AD at 4 body regions: head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. The EASI is a 
reliable and comprehensive assessment for AD (Hanifin et al. 2001). The proportion of affected skin is 
assessed in each region and the extent of 4 clinical signs (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, 
lichenification) is assessed, each on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The EASI score ranges from 0 to 
72, an EASI score of 7.1 to 21 is equated with ‘moderate severity’ (Leshem et al. 2015). EASI75 and 
EASI90  correspond  to  a  75%  and  90%  improvement  in  EASI  score  from  baseline,  respectively.  All 
patients were required to have a baseline EASI score ≥16 to enrol in the ‘phase 3’ studies. The minimal 
clinically important difference (MCID) for EASI is 6.6 (Schram et al. 2012). Therefore, all patients who 
achieved EASI75 or EASI90 would also have achieved an improvement in EASI that exceeds the MCID. 
The Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is a validated, patient-assessed, 11-point horizontal scale anchored 
at 0 and 10, with 0 representing ‘no itch’ and 10 representing ‘worst itch imaginable’, used to assess 
itch over the past 24 hours. Itch NRS is considered a relevant, reliable, valid, sensitive to change, and 
comprehensive  assessment  of  itch  severity  in  AD  (Newton  et  al.  2019;  Yosipovitch  et  al.  2019).  An 
improvement  from  baseline  of  4  points  is  considered  clinically  meaningful  (Kimball  et  al.  2016; 
Yosipovitch et al. 2019). 
The ADSS is a 3-item, patient-administered daily questionnaire to assess the impact of itch on sleep last 
night, developed and validated by the Applicant. The ADSS items are: difficulty falling asleep (Item 1); 
frequency of waking last night (Item 2); and difficulty getting back to sleep (Item 3). Patients rate Items 
1 and 3 using a 5-point Likert-like scale ranging from 0 ‘not at all’ to 4 ‘very difficult’. Patients report 
Item 2 by indicating the number of times they woke up at night. Improvement of 1.5 or more points in 
item 2 is considered clinically meaningful (ADSS validation report, 2019). 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 33/158 
 
 
 
 
The  Skin  Pain  NRS  is  a  patient-administered,  11-point  horizontal  scale  anchored  at  0  and  10,  with  0 
representing ‘no pain’ and 10 representing ‘worst pain imaginable’ in the past 24 hours, developed and 
validated by the Applicant. Skin Pain NRS is considered a valid, reliable, and appropriate assessment of 
skin  pain  severity  (Newton  et  al.  2019).  An  improvement  of  4  or  more  points  is  considered  clinically 
meaningful (Skin pain NRS validation report, 2019).  
The SCORAD is a validated and well established composite scoring system for AD combining the extent 
in  BSA  (20%  of  the  score)  with  the  severity  of  6  signs:  erythema,  oedema/papules,  scratching, 
oozing/crust formation, lichenification, dryness, each scored from 0 ‘absent’ to 3 ‘severe’ (60% of the 
score), and 2 symptoms (itch, sleeplessness) of the previous 3 days scored on a VAS from 0 representing 
no  symptom  and  10  represents  the  worst  imaginable  itch  or  sleeplessness  (20%  of  the  score).  The 
maximum score of SCORAD is 103, scores between 25 and 50 indicate moderate AD, while scores greater 
than 50 indicate severe AD (Oranje et al. 2007). SCORAD75 corresponds to an improvement of 75% 
from baseline, which is considered clinically meaningful, given that the MCID for SCORAD is 8.7 (Schram 
et al. 2012). Any patient who had moderate to severe AD at baseline, that is, a SCORAD score of 25 or 
greater, and who achieved SCORAD75 will have exceeded the MCID. 
The DLQI is a patient-administered, 10-item, validated, questionnaire on the impact of skin disease on 
6 domains over the last week: 
leisure 
symptoms and feelings 
- 
-  daily activities 
- 
-  work and school 
-  personal relationships, and 
- 
treatment. 
Response categories range from 0 ‘not at all’ to 3 ‘very much’. The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with 
higher scores indicating greater impact on QoL. The MCID for DLQI is 4 (Khilji et al. 2002; Basra et al. 
2015), and a DLQI score of 0 to 1 equates to no or minimal impact on a patient’s QoL (Hongbo et al. 
2005). 
The  POEM  is  a  7-item,  validated,  patient-administered  scale  that  assesses  disease  severity  in  AD 
patients. The patients assess the frequency of 7 symptoms over the last week (itching, sleep disturbance, 
bleeding, weeping/oozing, cracking, flaking, dryness/roughness). The total score ranges from 0 to 28, 
with higher total scores indicating greater disease severity (Charman et al. 2004). An improvement in 
POEM of 3.4 is considered clinically meaningful (Schram et al. 2012). 
The  HADS  is  a  widely-used  14-item  self-assessment  scale  to  determine  the  levels  of  anxiety  and 
depression symptoms that a patient experienced over the past week. Scores for each domain, that is, 
anxiety  and  depression,  can  range  from  0  to  21,  with  higher  scores  indicating  greater  symptoms  of 
anxiety or depression (Zigmond and Snaith 1983; Snaith 2003). An Anxiety Score or a Depression Score 
of 8 or greater indicates that a patient is suffering from anxiety or depression, respectively (Bjelland et 
al. 2002). 
Sample size 
Study JAHL aimed to enroll approximately 600 patients ≥18 years of age. The study was designed with 
a 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 20% in IGA between the baricitinib 4-mg and placebo 
treatment groups and the baricitinib 2-mg and placebo treatment groups, each using a 2-sided alpha of 
0.025, assuming a 10% placebo response rate for the primary endpoint. Study JAHM will aim to enroll 
approximately 600 patients ≥18 years of age. The proposed sample size will ensure a >90% power to 
detect  an  absolute  difference  of  20%  between  the  baricitinib  4-mg  and  placebo  treatment  groups, 
assuming a 10% placebo response rate for the primary endpoint using a 2-sided alpha of 0.25. Study

JAIY aimed to enroll approximately 300 patients ≥18 years of age. The study was designed with a 89% 
power to detect an absolute difference of 20% in IGA between the baricitinib 4-mg and placebo treatment 
groups  and  the  baricitinib  2-mg  and  placebo  treatment  groups,  each  using  a  2-sided  alpha  of  0.025, 
assuming a 10% placebo response rate for the primary endpoint. For all three studies, the assumptions 
were based on the results of the Phase 2 study (JAHG) and on the discussion with therapeutic experts.  
In all studies the primary endpoint of IGA 0 or 1 represented patients whose AD was clear or almost 
clear from a baseline of moderate or severe disease.  
Assignment to treatment groups was determined by a computer-generated random sequence using an 
interactive  web-based  response  system.  Using  the  system,  numbered  blister  packs  with  blinded 
investigational treatment are assigned to patients. Emergency unblinding for AEs  was also performed 
through the interactive web-based response system. 
In studies JAHL and JAHM, patients were randomly allocated in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to placebo, baricitinib 1-
mg, 2-mg, or 4-mg, stratified by geographic region (EU, Japan, rest-of-the-world) and baseline disease 
severity (IGA 3 versus 4).  
In study JAIY, patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, baricitinib 2-mg, or 4-mg, 
stratified  by  geographic  region  (EU,  Japan,  rest-of-the-world)  and  baseline  disease  severity  (IGA  3 
versus 4). 
Blinding 
A double-dummy design was used for blinding (see Treatments section). All study drugs used were 
identical in color, shape, smell, and taste to their respective placebo. Study drugs were packed in 
blisters. 
Patients, investigators, and all other personnel involved in the conduct of the studies were blinded to 
individual treatment assignments for the duration of the studies.  
In studies JAHL and JAHM, unblinding occurred only after the reporting database was validated and 
locked for final statistical analysis. Unblinding of study JAHL occurred on 17 January 2019. Unblinding 
of study JAHM occurred on 23 January 2019. 
In study JAIY, an interim database lock was performed after all patients had completed the 16-week 
double-blind treatment period of the study. At that time (13 August 2019) a limited number of pre-
identified individuals in the submission team accessed limited unblinded data prior to the final 
database lock. The final database lock was performed 2 weeks later after all patients completed the 
post-treatment follow-up period. 
Statistical methods 
Populations and treatment groups 
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses in Studies JAHL, JAHM and JAHY were conducted on the 
ITT population, which includes all patients who were randomised. A per protocol sensitivity analysis 
was also performed.  
For Studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY, patients were analysed according to the treatment group to which 
they were randomised. 
The following table defines the efficacy analysis populations for the completed Phase 3 studies:

Analyses performed 
The primary analysis method for treatment comparisons of dichotomous categorical outcome variables 
was logistic regression analysis with the following covariates: 
•  Region 
• 
• 
• 
baseline disease severity (IGA) 
baseline value (if the endpoint studied is not IGA), and 
treatment group. 
Firth’s correction was used in order to accommodate potential sparse response rates. The p-value for 
the odds ratio from the logistic regression model was used for statistical inference, unless Firth’s 
correction still resulted in quasi-separation. In that case, Fisher’s exact test was used for statistical 
inference. The difference in percentages and 100(1-alpha)% confidence interval of the difference in 
percentages were calculated using the Newcombe-Wilson method without continuity correction. The p-
value from the Fisher exact test was also produced. 
A post hoc analysis investigated the time to IGA 0 or 1, EASI75, and Itch NRS 4 or more point 
improvement response in Studies JAHL, JAHM, and JAIY using Kaplan Meier methods and 
nonresponder imputation (NRI). 
The relative risk comparing responses was estimated for the primary endpoint and each of the key 
categorical secondary endpoints. The relative risk compared the response rate of each dose of 
baricitinib to that of placebo, and the response rate of baricitinib 4-mg to that of baricitinib 2-mg using 
non-modelled methods. As none of the studies were powered to detect baricitinib 4-mg to baricitinib 2-
mg differences, Wald’s 95% Confidence Limits were used for this comparison. Statistical significance 
for categorical endpoints is based only on the odds ratio. 
The primary analysis method for treatment comparisons of continuous outcomes variables was a 
restricted maximum likelihood-based mixed-effects model of repeated measures (MMRM). The model 
included the following elements as fixed categorical effects:

baseline disease severity (IGA) 
visit, and 
treatment-by-visit interaction. 
The model included the following elements as fixed continuous effects: 
• 
• 
baseline value, and 
baseline score-by-visit interaction. 
Continuous data were summarised in terms of the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, 
median, quartiles, minimum and maximum. 
The test statistic was the F value derived within the MMRM framework. 
Handling of dropouts and missing data  
Intercurrent events were defined as: 
• 
• 
application of 1 of the censoring rules (including after permanent study drug discontinuation or 
after rescue therapy) 
discontinuation 
•  missing an intermediate visit prior to discontinuation or rescue 
• 
lost to follow-up. 
Censoring rules were defined for efficacy and health outcome data collected after a patient 
permanently discontinued study drug or began rescue therapy: 
• 
• 
The primary censoring rule censored efficacy and health outcome data after permanent study 
drug discontinuation or after rescue therapy. When the primary censoring rule was applied, all 
data up to rescue were used. 
The secondary censoring rule censored only efficacy and health outcome data after permanent 
study drug discontinuation. This rule was applied in the sensitivity analysis and included all 
observed values up to study drug discontinuation. 
In each study, imputation rules were applied after the application of the censoring rules. In Studies 
JAHL, JAHM, and JAIY the efficacy analyses used 2 pre-specified censoring rules: 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 37/158 
 
 
 
Table 12 
Studies JAHL, JAHM, and JAIY:  pre-specified censoring rules in the efficacy analyses  
After applying the censoring rules, different imputation methods were applied for categorical and 
continuous endpoints. 
For categorical endpoints, nonresponder imputation imputed missing values as nonresponses and could 
be justified based on the composite strategy for handling intercurrent events (ICH E9 R1). This 
imputation procedure assumed the effects of treatments disappeared after the occurrence of an 
intercurrent event defined by the associated censoring rule. 
For continues endpoints, mixed-effects model of repeated measures analyses were performed on 
continuous endpoints to mitigate the impact of missing data. This approach assumed that missing 
observations were missing at random and borrowed information from patients in the same treatment 
arm, taking into account both the missingness of data through the correlation of the repeated 
measurements. Essentially, MMRM estimates the treatment effects had all patients remained on their 
initial treatment throughout the study. For this reason, the MMRM imputation implies a different 
estimand (hypothetical strategy [ICH E9 R1]) than the one used for NRI on categorical outcomes. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses using different missing data imputation methods ensured that efficacy results were 
invariant to the primary method of handling missing data. In Studies JAHL, JAHM, and JAIY, sensitivity 
analyses used placebo multiple imputation (pMI) for categorical and continuous endpoints, Modified 
last observation carried forward (mLOCF) for continuous endpoints, and tipping point analyses for IGA 
0 or 1, EASI75, and Itch NRS 4 or more point improvement. 
Multiplicity adjustment 
The primary and key secondary endpoints were adjusted for multiplicity to control the overall family-
wise Type I error rate through a graphical testing approach. described by Bretz et al. (2011). The 
studies did not implement adjustments for multiplicity for analyses of any additional efficacy endpoints. 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 38/158 
 
 
 
 
The graphical multiple testing procedure controlled the overall Type I error rate at a 2-sided alpha 
level of 0.05 within each study. The alpha was split between the 3 doses of baricitinib tested in Studies 
JAHL and JAHM. To apply the multiplicity adjustment approach, the adjusted significance (alpha) levels 
were calculated for each hypothesis test. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Patient flow was similar in studies JAHL, JAHM, and JAIY (Table 13). In all three studies, more than 
90% of patients completed the 16-weeks study, about 88% of the patients continued in the long term 
follow-up study JAHN. Discontinuations were lowest in the baricitinib 4 mg treated groups and were 
similar in the other treatment groups. In the placebo groups, the most frequent reasons for 
discontinuation were ‘lack of efficacy’ and ‘withdrawal by patient’. Few patients discontinued due to 
adverse events, usually from the baricitinib treated groups.  
Table 13 
Patient flow of studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY 
For study JAHL, 757 patients were screened and 624 (82%) patients were randomised. For study 
JAHM, 728 patients were screened and 615 (84%) were randomised. For study JAIY, 378 patients were 
screened and 329 (87%) were randomised. 
Virtually all patients randomly assigned to a treatment group received the correct dose (except for 1 
patient in study JAHM randomised to placebo, who got and took baricitinib 1 mg on the day of 
randomisation only). All randomised patients were included in the ITT population. 
In Studies JAHL, JAHM, and JAIY, the PP population consisted of 95% and 100% of the ITT population 
for all treatment groups. 
Recruitment 
Studies JAHL and JAHM both ran from November 2017 (first patient first visit) to December 2018 (last 
patient last visit). Study JAIY ran from November 2018 to August 2019.  
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 39/158 
 
 
 
 
For study JAHL, patients were enrolled from sites in 9 countries, European sites from CZ, FR, GE, IT 
enrolled 337 (54%) of the included patients. For study JAHM, patients were enrolled from sites in 10 
countries, European sites from AT, HU, PL, ES, CH enrolled 280 (46%) of the included patients. 
For study JAIY, sites from 10 countries enrolled patients; the European sites from AT, GE, IT, PL, ES 
enrolled 115 (35%) of the included patients. 
Conduct of the study 
In study JAHL, there had been a single amendment that was performed about 3 weeks after the first 
patient visit. In study JAHM, there had been two amendments that were performed about 3 weeks and 
7 weeks after the first patient visit. The changes in the amendment of study JAHL and the first 
amendment of study JAHM were based on regulatory feedback (not CHMP), the main change was that 
the 2 mg dose was added to the primary objective. The second amendment in study JAHM concerned 
the study title. 
In study JAIY, there had been a single amendment that was performed about 4 weeks after the first 
patient visit. The main changes were that: leukotriene inhibitors were removed from the list of 
prohibited medications with the rationale that evidence suggested they have limited impact on AD; 
eosinophilia was removed from the criteria for discontinuation with the rationale that elevated levels of 
eosinophils are common in AD and do not reflect an increased risk for liver adverse events. 
Important protocol deviations were considered to included issues concerning: informed consent; 
eligibility; study treatment; study procedures. In studies JAHL and JAHM, 21 (3%) and 24 (4%) of 
patients had at least 1 important protocol deviation and as a consequence, 13 and 12 patients were 
excluded from the respective PP populations. In study JAIY, 12 (4%) of patients had at least 1 
important protocol deviation and as a consequence, 8 patients were excluded from the PP population. 
The jointly most common important protocol deviations concerned violations of in/exclusion criteria 
and significant non-compliance to study treatment. There was one patient with a missing informed 
consent. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographical data (age, sex, weight, race) were similar across trials and treatment groups. 
On average, patients were about 35 years old and nearly all (97%) patients were <65 years of age. 
About 34%-37% of patients were female and 63%-66% were male. The mean body mass index was 
about 25. The proportion of patients from the EU in studies JAHL and JAHM was 54% and 46%, which 
was 35% in study JAIY. Over all three studies, about 18% of patients were from Japan, 28% to 46% 
were from the rest-of-the-world.  
Baseline disease characteristics were similar across trials and treatment groups (Table 14). Disease 
duration was on average about 25 years (while mean age was 35). Overall most patients had 
moderate disease severity (IGA of 3) but a large proportion of patients with severe disease (IGA of 4) 
was included. Baseline variables of main outcomes (IGA, EASI, Itch, sleep disturbance (ADSS item 2), 
skin pain) and patient reported outcomes (POEM, DLQI, HADS) were equally distributed across 
treatment groups (Table 14).

Table 14 
Baseline disease characteristics in studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY 
All patients who were included in the three studies reported prior use of TCS and/or systemic therapies 
(Table 15). TCS was used by 89% to 94% of included patients, TCI was used by 50% to 63% of 
included patients. Systemic therapy for AD, including corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologicals, 
was used by 52% to 71% of included patients. Most patients for whom systemic therapy failed also 
had received topical treatment. The most common systemic treatments used were corticosteroids and 
ciclosporin; dupilumab had been used by few patients (Table 15). The most common reason for 
treatment failure with ciclosporin was an insufficient response. Of those patients who had not 
previously used ciclosporin, ciclosporin was contraindicated for 2 to 3% of patients, and medically 
inadvisable for 45 to 50% of patients. Ciclosporin was considered ‘medically inadvisable’ if the patient 
had: a previous inadequate response or intolerance to ciclosporin; a contraindication to ciclosporin; or 
if there were specific concerns about side effects by the treating physician.

Numbers analysed 
In studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY, all patients randomised were included in the ITT population. The PP 
populations consisted of 95% and 100% of the ITT population for all treatment groups. 
Compliance and rescue 
In each of the studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY, few patients were classified as non-compliant and 
compliance was ≥98%. Patient compliance with study treatment had been assessed by pill count at 
each visit. If a patient at his/her own intention had missed more than 20% of doses of study drug, or 
had taken more than 20% of study drug, he/she was considered significantly noncompliant.  
In studies JAHL and JAHM, 56% and 69% of the patients received rescue treatment (Table 16). The 
largest proportions of patients needing rescue treatment were in the placebo groups and the smallest 
proportions were in the baricitinib 4 mg treated groups. In the 4 mg treated groups, 41% and 59% of 
patients needed rescue during the 16 weeks of study, with few exceptions always TCS (Table 16). In 
the placebo and 1 mg and 2 mg groups, rescue treatment with TCS was more frequently used as 
compared to the 4 mg group. TCI and systemic treatments were not frequently used as rescue 
treatment, when then in the placebo, 1 mg and 2 mg groups (with few exceptions). Rescue treatment 
was initiated earlier in the placebo and lower-dose groups as compared to the baricitinib 4 mg treated 
group (Figure 7).

TCS (described in the Treatments section above). In total, 6% of the patients received rescue 
treatment, most frequently in the placebo group (9%) and less (5%) in the baricitinib treated groups 
(Table 17). Rescue treatment usually was a high-potency TCS (study drug was continued) and less 
frequently systemic treatment (study drug discontinued).

Outcomes and estimation 
IGA 0 or 1 (primary outcome) 
In all three studies (JAHL, JAHM, JAIY), baricitinib 4 mg was statistically significant more effective than 
placebo in reaching IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 (with a ≥2 points improvement from baseline), while 
adjusting for multiplicity (Table 18). Baricitinib 2 mg was more effective than placebo in reaching IGA 
0 or 1 at week 16 in studies JAHL and JAHM, but not in study JAIY. The 1 mg dose was not more 
effective than placebo. 
In study JAHL, IGA 0 or 1 was reached by 17% of patients in the baricitinib 4 mg group, 11% in the 2 
mg group, 12% in the 1 mg group, and 5% in the placebo group. The difference (95%CI) with placebo 
was 12.0% (5.5% – 19.8%) for the 4 mg group and 6.6 (0.9% – 13.7%) for the 2 mg group, which 
was significant after adjustment for multiplicity for both comparisons. 
In study JAHM, IGA 0 or 1 was reached by 14% of patients in the baricitinib 4 mg group, 11% in the 2 
mg group, 9% in the 1 mg group, and 5% in the placebo group. The difference (95%CI) with placebo 
was 9.3% (3.3% – 16.8%) for the 4 mg group and 6.1 (0.6% – 13.0%) for the 2 mg group, which was 
significant after adjustment for multiplicity for both comparisons. 
In study JAIY, IGA 0 or 1 was reached by 31% of patients in the baricitinib 4 mg group, 24% in the 2 
mg group, and 15% in the placebo group. The difference (95%CI) with placebo was 16.0% (4.9% – 
26.6%) for the 4 mg group and 9.2 (-1.4% – 19.5%) for the 2 mg group, which was significant after 
adjustment for multiplicity for the 4 mg dose group.

Proportions of patients reaching IGA 0 or 1 at week 16, in studies JAHL, JAHM 
The effect of baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg on IGA 0 or 1 appeared after 2-4 weeks of treatment in studies 
JAHL, JAHM and JAIY (Figure 8). By means of sensitivity analysis, the efficacy data were also analysed 
with data that were obtained after rescue treatment (‘secondary censoring’). In studies JAHL and 
JAHM, responses in IGA 0 or 1 became somewhat higher after secondary censoring, but the time 
course and between-group differences were similar (Figure 8). In study JAIY rescue treatment was not 
frequently applied and results of primary and secondary censoring were about the same (Figure 8).

Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) 
For baricitinib 4 mg, the percentage of patients with EASI75 response at week 16 was statistically 
significant larger as compared to placebo, in all three studies. For baricitinib 2 mg, this was reached in 
studies JAHL and JAHM, but not in study JAIY.  
In study JAHL, EASI75 at week 16 was reached by 25% of patients on baricitinib 4 mg, 19% on 2 mg, 
17% on 1 mg and 9% on placebo, which was statistically significant versus placebo for the 4 mg and 2 
mg groups (Table 19). In study JAHM, EASI75 at week 16 was reached by 21% of patients on 
baricitinib 4 mg, 18% on 2 mg, 13% on 1 mg and 6% on placebo, which was statistically significant 
versus placebo for the 4 mg and 2 mg groups (Table 20). In study JAIY, EASI75 at week 16 was 
reached by 48% of patients on baricitinib 4 mg + TCS, 43% on 2 mg + TCS, and 23% on placebo + 
TCS, which was statistically significant for 4 mg only (Table 21).

For baricitinib 4 mg, the percentage of patients with an improvement ≥4 points in the Itch NRS at 
week 16 was statistically significant larger as compared to placebo, in all three studies (Table 19 to 
Table 21). For baricitinib 2 mg, this was reached in study JAHM, but not in studies JAHL and JAIY.  
In studies JAHL and JAHM an improvement ≥4 points in the Itch NRS at week 16 was reached by 22% 
and 19% of patients treated with baricitinib 4 mg, 12% and 15% in patients treated with 2 mg, and 
7% and 5% in the placebo groups. In study JAIY, an improvement in Itch NRS≥4 points was reached 
by 44% of patients treated with 4 mg, 38% of patients on 2 mg, and 20% of patients on placebo.

Atopic Dermatitis Sleep Scale (ADSS) 
ADSS sleep item 2 concerns the number of times a patient woke up at night. For baricitinib 4 mg, the 
change in this item at week 16 was statistically significant larger as compared to placebo, in studies 
JAHL and JAHM, but not in study JAIY (Tables Table 19 to Table 21). For baricitinib 2 mg, the change 
in the ADSS sleep item 2 was statistically significant in study JAHM, but not in studies JAHL and JAIY. 
In study JAHL, the mean change in number of times a patient woke up (ADSS item 2) at week 16 as 
compared to baseline was -1.4 for baricitinib 4 mg, -1.0 for 2 mg, -1.2 for 1 mg and -0.8 for placebo. 
In study JAHM, the mean change in number of times a patient woke up at week 16 as compared to 
baseline was -1.1 for baricitinib 4 mg, -1.0 for 2 mg, -0.8 for 1 mg and -0.5 for placebo. In study JAIY, 
the mean change in number of times a patient woke up at week 16 as compared to baseline was -1.4 
for baricitinib 4 mg, -1.3 for 2 mg, and -0.5 for placebo. This transformed in a larger average 
proportion of nights without awakenings on higher doses of baricitinib as compared to placebo (Figure 
11; post-hoc analysis).

Results in the SCORAD sleep loss item and ADSS item 1 on ‘difficulty falling asleep’ in studies JAHL, 
JAHM and JAIY showed numerically larger effects in baricitinib 4 mg, and to a less extent 2 mg, versus 
placebo, not corrected for multiplicity. In ADSS item 3 on ‘difficulty getting back to sleep’ the effects 
compared to placebo were small and not statistically significant.  
SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) 
For baricitinib 4 mg, the percentage of patients having reached SCORAD75 at week 16 was statistically 
significant larger as compared to placebo, in studies JAHL and JAHM, but not in study JAIY (Table 19 to 
Table 21). For baricitinib 2 mg, this was reached in study JAHM, but not in studies JAHL and JAIY.  
The proportions of patients reaching SCORAD75 on baricitinib 4 mg were 10% and 11% versus 1% 
and 2% on placebo in studies JAHL and JAHM. In study JAIY, SCORAD75 at week 16 was reached by 
18% of patients on 4 mg and 7% on placebo.  
Skin pain NRS 
For baricitinib 4 mg, the change in the Skin Pain NRS at week 16 was statistically significant larger as 
compared to placebo, in studies JAHL and JAHM, but not in study JAIY (Table 19 to Table 21). For 
baricitinib 2 mg, the change in Skin Pain NRS was statistically significant in study JAHM, but not in 
studies JAHL and JAIY.  
In studies JAHL and JAHM, the mean change in the skin pain NRS for patients treated with baricitinib 4 
mg was -1.9 and -2.5 compared to -0.8 and -0.9 in the placebo groups. In study JAIY, the mean 
change in the skin pain NRS for patients treated with baricitinib 4 mg was -3.7 compared to -2.1 in the 
placebo group. 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 
For baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg, the change in the DLQI at week 16 was larger (p<0.05, without 
adjustment for multiplicity) as compared to placebo, in studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY. The response of 
the 4 mg dose was numerically better than the response of the 2 mg dose group. Similar results for 
the two doses were found with improvement in DLQI ≥4 points (considered as MCID) as outcome.

Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) 
For baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg, the change in the POEM at week 16 was larger (p<0.05, without 
adjustment for multiplicity) as compared to placebo, in studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY. The response of 
the 4 mg dose was numerically better than the response of the 2 mg dose group. Similar results for 
the two doses were found with improvement in POEM ≥4 points (larger than the MCID) as outcome.  
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 
For baricitinib 4 mg, the change in the HADS total score at week 16 was larger (p<0.05, without 
adjustment for multiplicity) as compared to placebo, in studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY. For baricitinib 2 
mg this was the case in studies JAHL and JAIY, but not in JAHM. The response of the 4 mg dose was 
numerically better than the response of the 2 mg dose group. For HADS anxiety score <8 points and 
HADS depression score <8 points results were less clear. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Analysis of the PPS population in studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY, gave comparable results and the same 
conclusions as the ITT population for the primary and key secondary endpoints, notably for IGA 0 or 1, 
EASI75 and Itch NRS≥4.  
The efficacy results, notably for IGA 0 or 1, EASI75 and Itch NRS≥4, obtained using secondary 
censoring, which included data after rescue treatment (usually TCS) were largely consistent (JAHL and 
JAHM) or practically identical (JAIY) with those of primary censoring that included only data on 
monotherapy. 
The results analysed using ‘placebo’ Multiple Imputation (with the assumption that the investigational 
product provides no pharmacological benefit over placebo following an intercurrent event) supported 
the effect of baricitinib 4 mg over placebo (notably in IGA 0 or 1, EASI75 and Itch NRS≥4) in studies 
JAHL, JAHM and JAIY. In these analyses, the effects of the 2 mg dose were not consistently statistically 
significant different from placebo.

A Phase 3 Multicenter, Double-Blind Study to Evaluate the Long- Term Safety 
and Efficacy of Baricitinib in Adult Patients with Atopic Dermatitis (JAHN). 
In the first 52-week period of the long term extension study (JAHN) all three doses of baricitinib were 
evaluated (Table 2). Patients were mainly recruited from JAHL, JAHM and JAIY. In the three 16-week 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020

‘phase 3’ studies (JAHL, JAHM, JAIY), three oral doses of baricitinib were evaluated against placebo: 1-
mg, 2-mg, and 4-mg once daily (also see Table 2).  
Study JAHN is currently ongoing and the data have been updated during the procedure. Accordingly, 
all patients from originating monotherapy studies JAHL and JAHM have completed week 52 of study 
JAHN (68 weeks of total treatment) or have discontinued. All patients originating from combination 
therapy study JAIY have completed week 16 or have discontinued, and 54% of patients have 
completed week 24, of JAHN. After Week 52 of Study JAHN, patients were eligible to participate in a 
downtitration substudy, of which some data were submitted during the application. 
Design and objectives  
Study JAHN is a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy 
of baricitinib 1-mg, 2-mg, and 4-mg once daily (QD) in adult patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) who 
had completed studies JAHL, JAHM, or JAIY. A sub study/cohort was added to evaluate efficacy and 
safety of baricitinib 2-mg open-label in adult patients with moderate to severe AD who had not 
completed an originating study. 
In ‘maintenance and up-titration’ treatment period 1 (week 0 – 52): patients who were responders or 
partial responders at week 16 of the originating study and have not had rescue treatment, continued 
their treatment assigned. Non-responders on baricitinib 4 mg continued on the same dose. Non 
responders on placebo, 1 mg or 2 mg were re-randomised (1:1) to baricitinib 2 mg or 4 mg. 
In ‘withdrawal and down-titration’ treatment period 2 (week 52 – 104): patients who are responders or 
partial responders on 2 mg or 4 mg at week 52 and are otherwise eligible will be re-randomised 
(1:1:1) to dose continuation, the next lower dose (1 mg or 2 mg), or placebo. Ineligible patients will 
continue the dose assigned in treatment period 1.  
The primary objective was to estimate the effect of long-term therapy with baricitinib on responders 
and partial responders at entry of study JAHN. A secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of 
increasing baricitinib dose in non-responders, and to evaluate safety of long term treatment with 
baricitinib.

Methods 
Study participants 
Participants were mainly included from studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY. Studies JAHL and JAHM had 
identical inclusion and exclusion criteria, aiming at an adult population with moderate to severe AD and 
a recent history of inadequate response/intolerance to topical AD therapies. The inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for study JAIY were very similar, with the exception that patients with intolerance to 
TCS were excluded while TCS was to be used concomitantly. 
To be eligible for study JAHN following study JAHL, JAHM or JAIY, patients should have completed the 
final (week 16) visit of the study they were in. For the open label baricitinib 2 mg cohort, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria were identical to the in/exclusion criteria of JAHL and JAHM, including wash-
out of prior topical or systemic therapies. 
Treatments 
Investigational treatment 
Patients could receive baricitinib 4 mg, 2 mg, or 1 mg once daily, or placebo. Responders and non-
responders of mono therapy studies JAHL and JAHM were asked to continue baricitinib as monotherapy 
as long as possible.  
Compliance 
Patient compliance with investigational treatment was assessed by pill count at each visit. If a patient 
at his/her own intention had missed more than 20% of doses of study drug, or had taken more than 
20% of study drug, he/she was considered significantly noncompliant. 
Concomitant treatments 
Emollients were to be used daily, use could be increased if needed. Use of TCS was allowed. If 
symptoms could not be controlled, low- to medium-potency TCS could be used: triamcinolone 0.1% 
cream and/or hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment. TCIs or crisaborole (a PDE-4 inhibitor as ointment) could 
be used for problem-areas only. If sufficient improvement was not reached, a higher potency TCS 
could be used.  
Rescue treatment 
If a patient started study JAHN as a responder or partial responder, and symptoms worsened to an IGA 
of 3 or more, patients on 1 mg or placebo were re-randomised (1:1) to 2 mg or 4 mg. Patients on 2 
mg or 4 mg were not rescued but continued their dose.  
Outcomes 
The primary efficacy outcome was IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 (week 32 overall), week 36 (week 52 overall) 
and week 52 (week 68 overall) for baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg.  
Key secondary outcome was EASI75 at week 16. The other main efficacy outcomes were similar as in 
the originating studies and included: IGA 0 or 1 over time, EASI75, Itch NRS ≥4 points improvement, 
SCORAD75, skin pain NRS, ADSS item 2. Patient reported outcomes that were assessed with an 
Assessment report

Page 57/158 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
electronic diary, such as Itch NRS and Skin pain NRS, were assessed up to week 32 (week 16 of study 
JAHN). 
Sample size 
It is anticipated that 90% of enrolled patients will complete Studies JAHL and JAHM; of these patients, 
it is expected that approximately 90% of patients will roll over into Study JAHN. Therefore, planned 
enrollment into Study JAHN from the originating studies JAHL and JAHM will be approximately 970 
patients. This study is meant to evaluate patients’ long-term response of baricitinib and the sample 
sizes are not determined to detect differences between baricitinib and placebo in a statistically 
powered manner. 
Randomisation 
According to the design (Figure 12) of study JAHN, patients who were on placebo or on baricitinib 1 mg 
or 2 mg and were non-responders/had needed rescue were re-randomised (1:1) to baricitinib 2 mg or 
4 mg. Also patients who needed to be rescued during study JAHN could be re-randomised (see 
Treatments). 
For Period 1, randomisation was performed using a computer-generated random sequence and was 
stratified by disease severity at baseline of JAHN (IGA 0, 1, 2 versus IGA 3 versus IGA 4), applied 
using an Interactive Web-based Response System. Using the system, blister packs with blinded 
investigational treatment are assigned to patients.  
Blinding 
The double-dummy design was continued for patients originating from JAHL, JAHM and JAIY: one 
verum tablet and two placebo tablets once daily packed in blisters, to match the three different 
strengths of baricitinib. Patients in the 2 mg open label cohort were supplied with 2 mg tablets to be 
taken once daily. 
Patients, investigators, and all other personnel involved in the conduct of the study remained blinded 
to individual originating study treatment assignments for the duration of the study. Members of the 
safety data monitoring committee reviewed unblinded results by treatment group. Sponsor unblinding 
occurred after the reporting database was validated and locked for interim statistical analysis; patients 
and investigators remained blinded. Sponsor unblinding to Week 16 data occurred on 10 May 2019. 
Statistical methods 
Populations and treatment groups 
Analyses were performed on the modified ITT population, which included all randomised patients who 
had received at least 1 dose of the investigational product. Since all patients in the originating studies 
who consented to enrol in Study JAHN received the investigational product, the ITT and modified ITT 
populations in Study JAHN were identical and, thus, no efficacy analyses using the ITT were produced 
in Study JAHN. 
For Study JAHN patients were analysed according to their treatment group from the originating studies 
and response status (responder, partial responder, and nonresponder) upon entry into the long-term 
extension study: 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 58/158 
 
 
 
•  Responders and partial responders were patients entering Study JAHN who had an IGA score of 
0, 1, or 2 AND were never determined by the investigator to require rescue treatment during 
the originating study. 
•  Non responders were patients who did not meet the responder and partial responder definition 
(that is, patients with an IGA of 3 or 4, or who were rescued during the originating study). 
The following table defines the efficacy analysis populations for the study: 
Table 22 
Efficacy analysis populations for the study JAHN 
Analyses performed 
Primary and secondary discrete efficacy variables will be descriptively summarized by treatment group 
in terms of frequencies and percentages. Treatment comparisons of discrete efficacy variables between 
treatment groups may be made using a logistic regression analysis with disease severity (IGA 0 or 1 
versus IGA 2), and treatment group in the model. Other factors may be included in the model. If the 
logistic regression model is performed, then the p-value from the logistic model, percentages, 
difference in percentages, and (100 minus alpha)% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in 
percentages using the Newcombe–Wilson method (Newcombe 1998) without continuity correction will 
be reported. When logistic regression sample size requirements are not met (<5 responders in any 
category for any factor), the p-value from the Fisher exact test is produced instead of the odds ratio 
and CI. 
Continuous efficacy variables will be descriptively summarized by treatment group in terms of number 
of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. When evaluating these 
continuous measures over time, a restricted maximum likelihood-based mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) may be used. The model will include treatment, baseline severity, visit, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 59/158 
 
 
 
 
treatment-by-visit-interaction as fixed categorical effects and baseline score and baseline score-by-
visit-interaction as fixed continuous effects. Other factors may be included in the model. An 
unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model the between- and within-patient errors. If 
this analysis fails to converge, other structures will be tested. The Kenward–Roger method will be used 
to estimate the degrees of freedom. Type III sums of squares for the least-square means (LSM) will be 
used for the statistical comparison; 95% CI will also be reported. 
Handling of dropouts and missing data  
In Study JAHN, data were censored after permanent study drug discontinuation, or, for Responders 
and Partial Responders, as defined below, in the placebo or baricitinib 1-mg groups, after rescue to a 
higher dose, that is, baricitinib 2-mg or 4-mg. 
The Statistical Methods appendices of the individual clinical study reports (CSRs) describe the 
procedures for handling missing data whether missingness is due to a missed visit, failure to enter 
diary data, or due to censoring due to use of rescue therapy or permanent study drug discontinuation. 
After applying the censoring rules, different imputation methods were applied for categorical and 
continuous endpoints, as summarised below.

Sensitivity analyses 
In Study JAHN, sensitivity analyses used Modified Last observation carried forward (mLOCF) for 
continuous outcomes for Nonresponders, that is, patients who had an IGA of 3 or 4 at baseline of 
Study JAHN, or who required rescue at any point during the originating study. Study JAHN used pMI as 
a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint for Responders and Partial Responders, that is, patients 
with an IGA of 0, 1, or 2 at baseline of Study JAHN who did not require rescue at any point during the 
originating study. 
Multiplicity adjustment 
As this study was designed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of baricitinib in patients with 
atopic dermatitis, no adjustments for multiple comparisons was utilized in the statistical analyses for 
this study.

Results 
Participant flow 
From studies JAHL, JAHM, and JAIY, 1375 patients entered study JAHN and 1373 were included (Figure 
13). N=371 patients who were responder or partial responders in the originating study continued their 
treatment. N=1002 patients were non-responders and accordingly, 807 of them were re-randomised to 
baricitinib 2 mg or 4 mg while 195 non-responders to baricitinib 4 mg continued their dose (Figure 14). 
Of the 1081 included patients from JAHM and JAHL, all patients had reached week 52 or had 
discontinued. Of the 292 patients included from study JAIY, all patients had reached week 16 and 54% 
had reached week 24.  
Of the 133 responders and partial responders on baricitinib 4 mg, 32 (24%) discontinued and 101 
(76%) were ongoing. Of the 107 responders and partial responders on baricitinib 2 mg, 17 (16%) 
discontinued and 90 (84%) were ongoing.  
Of the 195 non-responders on baricitinib 4 mg who thus continued the 4 mg dose, 63 (32%) 
discontinued, usually (n=45) due to a lack of efficacy; 132 (68%) were ongoing in study JAHN. 
There were 247 patients included in the baricitinib 2 mg open label cohort. All patients reached week 
16, 85% had reached week 24 and 39% had reached week 36.

Recruitment 
Study JAHN started in March 2018 (first patient first visit), with a cut-off date for interim analysis at 2 
July 2019, followed by a data cut-off at 13 December 2019 and database lock at 29 January 2020. 
About 88% of the patients having completed one of the studies, JAHL, JAHM and JAIY, continued in the 
long term follow-up study JAHN. Of these 1373 patients, 50% were included in centres in European 
countries. 
In addition, baricitinib-naïve patients were recruited for an open label cohort treated with baricitinib 2 
mg. Of the 247 included patients, about 50% were included in centres in European countries. 
Conduct of the study 
In study JAHN there had been two protocol amendments. The first amendment was performed before 
the first patient visit and mainly concerned a widening of options to provide TCS if triamcinolone or 
hydrocortisone are not available, and a change in criteria for restarting investigational drug after a VTE 
from ‘after appropriate treatment and resolution of VTE’ to ‘…after evaluation and institution of 
appropriate treatment for VTE’. In case of remaining significant risk or in case of a second VTE, 
investigational treatment was to be discontinued permanently. The second amendment was performed 
1 day after the first patient visit. It mainly concerned the addition of study JAIY to studies JAHL and 
JAHM as originating study, and the addition of monitoring tests for confirmed VTE in alignment with 
the other ‘phase 3‘ studies. 
Important protocol deviations were defined as in the originating studies. In study JAHN 25 (2%) of 
patients had at least 1 important protocol deviation (usually significant non-compliance) equally 
divided over baricitinib treated groups. In the open-label cohort, 3 patients had at least 1 important 
protocol deviation (non-compliance). Patients with important protocol deviations remained in the 
analysis populations. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographical and disease characteristics are presented from baseline of the originating 
study, for responders/partial responders and non-responders separately. 
In responders and partial responders, the patient numbers in the four treatment groups varied 
between n=45 for baricitinib 1 mg and n=133 for 4 mg (Table 24). The mean age was about 34 years 
and between 36% and 48% were female. Mean disease duration ranged from 22 years to 25 years. 
In non-responders, the patient numbers in the 7 treatment groups varied between n=81 for patients 
re-randomized from baricitinib 1 mg to 4 mg and n=214 and n=222 for patients re-randomised from 
placebo (Table 25). The mean age varied between 33 and 36 years and between 32% and 41% were 
female. Mean disease duration ranged from 24 years to 27 years. 
Patients included in the baricitinib 2 mg open label cohort were on average 35 years old, 45% were 
female, and mean disease duration was 25 years. The baseline disease characteristics (not shown) 
were also very similar to the disease characteristics at baseline in studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY. 
In responders and partial responders, baseline disease characteristics were descriptively similar 
between the four treatment groups (Table 24). Similarly, in Non-responders the baseline disease 
characteristics were descriptively similar between the 7 treatment groups (Table 25). Overall the

All 247 patients who were included in the baricitinib 2 mg open label cohort reported prior use of TCS, 
TCI, or systemic treatments. TCS was used by 94% of included patients, TCI was used by 38%, and 
58% had used systemic treatment most often corticosteroids (43% of total) but also ciclosporin (20% 
of total). Biologicals were infrequently used (3% of total). 
Numbers analysed 
All 1373 (from originating studies) and 247 patients (open label 2 mg cohort) who were included 
received at least 1 dose of investigational treatment and were analysed in ITT, modified ITT and Safety 
sets that were identical. The results of the mITT analyses were separately presented for 
responders/partial responders from JAHL/JAHM, responders/partial responders from JAIY, the non-
responders from JAHL/JAHM and from JAIY, and the 2 mg open label study. 
Compliance and rescue 
Of the 1373 patients coming from one of the three originating studies, 1349 (99%) were compliant to 
investigational treatment during study JAHN. Of the 243 patients included in the open label cohort, 236 
(99%) were complaint. 
Assessment report

Page 68/158 
 
 
 
 
Patients on baricitinib 4 mg or 2 mg continued their dose in case of worsening of disease activity 
(IGA), no rescue was defined. 
Outcomes and estimation 
To assess maintenance of efficacy, primary and main secondary outcomes were assessed through 
week 52 of Study JAHN. For patients who were treated with baricitinib in studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY, 
this is equivalent to 68 weeks of continuous treatment with baricitinib. Results are presented 
separately for patients coming from JAHL/JAHM or JAIY, and by responder status at baseline of JAHN.  
- For patients who were responders or partial responders on placebo, 1 mg, 2 mg or 4 mg, the dose 
was continued.  
- For patients who were non-responders on 4 mg, the dose of 4 mg was continued.  
To assess uptitration from 2 mg to 4 mg, patients who were non-responders on 2 mg were re-
randomised to dose continuation or to 4 mg. 
Maintenance of response (IGA 0 or 1 or 2) 
By design, patients who were responders or partial responders at week 16 of one of the originating 
studies had a IGA of 0, 1 or 2 at baseline of JAHN (Figures 15-16). In the baricitinib 2 mg group, the 
proportion of patients with an IGA<3 remained large from week 16 to week 52 for patients from 
monotherapy (Figure 15) and from combination therapy (Figure 16). In the baricitinib 4 mg, 1 mg and 
placebo groups, the decrease in the proportion of patients with a response was relatively larger than 
with 2 mg (Figure 15 and Figure 16). Concomitant TCS was allowed in JAHN, and does not lead to 
missingness and imputations.

In responders and partial responders on monotherapy, the proportion of patients with an IGA 0 or 1 
increased from week 16 to week 52 in the baricitinib 2 mg group, and decreased in the other groups 
including baricitinib 4 mg (Table below). In week 52 (overall), the proportion of patients with an IGA 0 
or 1 was highest in the baricitinib 2 mg group, exceeding the 1 mg and 4 mg groups that were similar. 
In responders and partial responders on combination therapy, the proportion of patients with an IGA 0 
or 1 at week 16 and week 24 was highest in the 2 mg group (Tables below).

Proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 in responders and partial-responders 
For the 70 responders or partial responders on monotherapy with baricitinib 4 mg, the proportion of 
patients with an IGA of 0 or 1 was 46% at week 16 (baseline of JAHN), the other 53% were partial 
responders with an IGA of 2 (Figure 17). The proportion with an IGA 0 or 1 increased to week 24 and 
then declined to 40% at week 68. For the 54 responders or partial responders on baricitinib 2 mg, the 
proportion of patients with an IGA of 0 or 1 was 46% at week 16 (Figure 17). The proportion with an 
IGA 0 or 1 increased to week 52, then declined somewhat, to increase again to 50% at week 68.

Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) 
In responders and partial responders on monotherapy, the proportion of patients with an EASI75 
response declined from week 16 to week 52 in the placebo group and baricitinib 1 mg and 4 mg 
groups, and remained stable in the baricitinib 2 mg group (Table 28). On 4 mg, the proportion of 
patients with an EASI75 response was 70% at week 16 which gradually declined to 51% at week 52. 
For responders and partial responders continuing baricitinib 2 mg, the proportion of patients with an 
EASI75 was 74% at week 16 which remained stable to 65% at week 52. Similarly, in the responders 
and partial responders on combination therapy, EASI75 responses were highest for the 2 mg dose 
(Table 29). At week 24 of JAHN, the proportion with EASI75 was 68% in the 2 mg group and 48% in 
the 4 mg group.  
Thus, on follow-up in responders and partial responders on monotherapy and on combination therapy, 
the proportion with EASI75 response was numerically highest in the baricitinib 2 mg groups.

For responders and partial responders on monotherapy continuing baricitinib 4 mg, the proportion of 
patients with an improvement ≥4 points from baseline in Itch NRS was 53% at week 16 which 
gradually declined to 41% at week 32 (Figure 18). For responders and partial responders continuing 2 
mg, the proportion of patients with an Itch NRS improvement ≥4 points was 44% at week 16 which 
gradually declined to 33% at week 32.  
For responders and partial responders on combination therapy continuing baricitinib 4 mg, the 
proportion with a response in Itch NRS (≥4 points improvement) was 54% which became 46% at week 
16 (Figure 19). For patients continuing 2 mg this was similar: 56% at baseline of JAHN which also 
became 46% at week 16.

Atopic Dermatitis Sleep Scale (ADSS) 
ADSS sleep item 2 concerns the number of times a patient woke up at night. For responders and 
partial responders on monotherapy continuing baricitinib 4 mg, the mean (SD) change in number of 
awakenings was -1.9 (3.4) at week 16 and -1.8 (3.4) at week 32. For responders and partial 
responders continuing baricitinib 2 mg, the mean (SD) change in number of awakenings was -1.3 (3.7) 
at week 16 and -1.3 (3.9) at week 32. 
For responders and partial responders on combination therapy continuing baricitinib 4 mg, the mean 
(SD) change in number of awakenings was -1.6 (2.7) at week 16 and -1.2 (1.4) at week 32. For the 
patients continuing 2 mg this was -1.7 (1.9) at week 16 and -1.8 (1.9) at week 32.  
Skin pain NRS 
For responders and partial responders continuing baricitinib 4 mg, the mean (SD) change in Skin pain 
NRS was -3.8 (2.3) at week 16 and -3.2 (2.4) at week 32. For responders and partial responders 
continuing baricitinib 2 mg, the mean (SD) change in Skin pain NRS was -3.5 (2.9) at week 16 and -
2.7 (3.3) at week 32.  
For responders and partial responders on combination therapy continuing baricitinib 4 mg, the mean 
(SD) change in Skin pain NRS was -3.8 (2.8) at week 16 and -3.5 (3.2) at week 32. For the patients 
continuing 2 mg this was -4.0 (2.3) at week 16 and -3.7 (2.6) at week 32. 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 
For responders and partial responders continuing baricitinib 4 mg, the mean (SD) change in DLQI was 
-9.6 (6.7) at week 16 and -7.4 (6.5) at week 52. The proportion of patients with a DLQI improvement 
≥4 points was 71% at week 52. For responders and partial responders continuing baricitinib 2 mg, the 
mean (SD) change in DLQI was -8.0 (6.8) at week 16 and -7.5 (6.3) at week 52. The proportion of 
patients with a DLQI improvement ≥4 points was 66% at week 52. 
For responders and partial responders on combination therapy continuing baricitinib 4 mg, the 
proportion of patients with a DLQI improvement ≥4 points was 67% at week 32. This was 76% for 
patients continuing 2 mg. 
Ancillary analyses 
The baricitinib 2 mg open label cohort within study JAHN consisted of patients who were naïve to 
baricitinib (Figure 20). The proportion of patients with an IGA 0 or 1 increased steadily from baseline 
to 31% at week 24, the proportion of patients with an EASI75 response increased to 39% at week 24. 
Itch NRS was assessed up to week 16 from baseline, at week 12 the proportion with a response ≥4 
points in Itch NRS was 27% and remained stable up to week 16.

Patients starting baricitinib 2 mg and IGA 0/1, EASI75, and Itch≥4 points 
Subgroup analyses were performed for week 16 results of IGA 0 or 1, EASI75 and Itch NRS 
improvement ≥4 points, in the following pre-defined subgroups: gender, age, weight, body mass 
index, race, renal function, disease severity based on baseline IGA, geographic region, and previous 
therapy. Subgroup analyses were performed for the pooled mono therapy studies JAHL and JAHM, and 
combination therapy study JAIY separately, by testing treatment (baricitinib 4 mg, 2 mg, 1 mg, 
placebo) by subgroup interactions. 
Statistically significant (p<0.10) treatment by subgroup interactions were found for gender (all 
studies), baseline IGA score (mono therapy studies), TCI failure or inadvisable (mono therapy), 
ciclosporin failure or ineligible (combination therapy), and region (all studies). 
Gender 
In the monotherapy studies, overall there was a tendency for males performing worse than females, 
only the treatment by gender interaction for EASI75 was significant (p=0.059). For baricitinib 4 mg, 
the IGA 0/1 for males versus females was 13% versus 21%, for EASI75 this was 19% versus 31%.  
In the combination treatment study there was a significant treatment by gender interaction for IGA 0/1 
(p=0.017) and for EASI75 (p=0.002), to the extent that males performed worse than females in the 4 
mg group, which was reversed in the 2 mg group. In the 4 mg group the IGA 0/1 for males versus 
females was 20% versus 53%, and in the 2 mg group this was 26% versus 21%; for EASI75 a similar 
kind of effect was seen. 
Disease severity (IGA) 
In the monotherapy studies there was no statistically significant treatment by baseline IGA (3 or 4) 
interaction for IGA 0/1 at week 16 (p=0.98), but there was such an interaction for EASI75 (p=0.038). 
In the baricitinib 4 mg group, IGA 0/1 was 23% in the baseline IGA 3 subgroup and 6% in the IGA 4 
subgroup. Similarly, EASI75 was 28% in the IGA 3 subgroup and 17% in the IGA 4 subgroup. 
Also in the combination therapy study, the treatment by disease severity interaction was significant 
(p=0.07) for EASI75 only. In the baricitinib 4 mg group, IGA 0/1 was 46% in the baseline IGA 3 
subgroup and 12% in the IGA 4 subgroup. Similarly, EASI75 was 62% in the IGA 3 subgroup and 30% 
in the IGA 4 subgroup. 
A similar trend was seen for baricitinib 2 mg as compared to 4 mg. 
Assessment report

Region 
Over studies and major outcomes, there was a tendency that responses were higher in the EU 
subgroup as compared to the rest-of-the-world. 
Previous therapy 
In the monotherapy studies, only the interaction of treatment by TCI failure/inadvisable was 
statistically significant, and for IGA 0/1 only (p=0.051). In the baricitinib 4 mg group, IGA 0/1 was 
17% for TCI failure and 14% versus no failure; for EASI75 and for the 2 mg group similar numerical 
trends were seen. The treatment by ciclosporin failure/ineligible interaction was not statistically 
significant, the responses in IGA 0/1 and EASI75 were numerically slightly lower in case of ciclosporin 
failure. 
In the combination therapy study, the interaction for treatment by ciclosporin failure/ineligible was 
statistically significant for EASI75 (p=0.023) but not for IGA 0/1 (p=0.59). In the baricitinib 4 mg 
group the EASI75 response in case of ciclosporin failure was 55% versus 46% in case of absence of 
failure; in the 2 mg group the effects were reversed: 19% in case of ciclosporin failure and 49% in 
case of absence of failure. The treatment interactions were not statistically significant for previous 
systemic therapy and for TCI failure/inadvisable. 
There were in total 47 patients in the monotherapy studies and 16 patients in the combination therapy 
study who had used dupilumab previously. In the monotherapy study, IGA 0/1 was reached by 1/7 
(14%) in the baricitinib 4 mg group, 2/16 (13%) in the 2 mg group and 0/10 (0%) in the placebo 
group. Similarly, EASI75 was reached by 3/7 (43%) on 4 mg, 2/16 (13%) on 2 mg, and 0 on placebo. 
In the combination therapy group, IGA 0/1 was reached by 4/7 (57%) in the baricitinib 4 mg group 
and 0/9 (0%) in the 2 mg group; EASI75 was reached by 5/7 (71%) in the 4 mg group and 2/9 (22%) 
in the 2 mg group.

Not applicable. 
Supportive studies 
The MAH performed a ‘phase 3’ study comparing baricitinib (1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg QD) in combination 
with TCS, in patients with moderate to severe Atopic Dermatitis who were previously treated with oral 
ciclosporin or for whom that treatment is contra-indicated.

Methods 
Design 
Study JAIN was a  multicenter, double-blind, randomized (1:2:1:1), placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib 1mg+TCS, 2mg+TCS and 4mg+TCS versus 
placebo+TCS, in adult patients with moderate to severe Atopic Dermatitis with failure of ciclosporin or 
who are intolerant to or have a contraindication to ciclosporin (Figure 21). Primary outcome was 
EASI75 at week 16, IGA 0 or 1 was a secondary outcome. The first patient first visit was at 15 May 
2018 and the interim data cutoff was at 28 Nov 2019.

g Beginning at Visit 14 (Week 52), nonresponders (IGA ≥3) in the placebo, baricitinib 1-mg, or baricitinib 2-mg groups will be 
rerandomized at a 1:1 ratio to baricitinib 4-mg or baricitinib 2-mg QD. Nonresponders randomized to baricitinib 4-mg at baseline will 
remain on 4-mg. After rerandomization, patients will remain on the same dose of baricitinib for the remainder of the study. 
h Occurs approximately 28 days after the last dose of IP. Not required for patients who have been off drug for 28 days or more at the 
time of their last visit. 
Figure 21 
Design of study JAIN 
Study participants 
Patients were included if they were 18 years or older and had AD for at least 1 year. They should have 
moderate to severe AD, as defined by an EASI score ≥16, an IGA >2, and a BSA ≥10%, while having 
had a recent inadequate response to topical therapies and had a documented history of inadequate 
response, intolerance, or contraindication to ciclosporin use.  
Treatments 
In  the  double-blind  treatment  period,  patients  received  baricitinib  1  mg  QD,  baricitinib  2  mg  QD, 
baricitinib 4 mg QD, or placebo QD, for 16 weeks, added to a standardised regimen of TCS. Blinding was 
maintained using double-dummies.  
Patients had to wash-out from topical and systemic AD treatments before baseline. Background TCS 
therapy was triamcinolone 0.1% cream or equivalent-potency TCS applied twice daily, until lesions 
were under control (clear or almost clear), then it was switched to hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment or 
equivalent-potency TCS for 7 days after which it could be stopped and restarted if lesions reappeared. 
Patients had to apply emollients throughout the study. 
Rescue therapy was included, with higher potency TCS as the first step. 
Outcomes 
Primary outcome was the proportion of patients with at least a 75% change from baseline at week 16 in 
Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score (EASI75).  
Main secondary outcomes were: mean percent change in EASI score,  mean change in itch severity on 
a NRS; mean change in pain severity on a NRS; change in the number of awakenings at night due to 
itch (ADSS item 2); the proportion of patients with an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 
0 or 1; the proportion of patients with at least 75% improvement in the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis scale 
(SCORAD). (See the main studies for further explanation of outcomes.) 
Primary outcome was EASI75 at week 16, secondary outcomes were: change in EASI, Itch NRS, Pain 
NRS, ADSS item 2, IGA 0 or 1, and SCORAD75. 
Statistical methods 
The analyses for efficacy were based on the ITT population. NRI was applied to missing values of the 
primary outcome and other categorical outcomes. A graphical multiple testing approach was employed 
for testing the primary outcome (EASI75) of the three dose groups against placebo at an α of 5%. 
Participant flow 
There were 566 patients screened and 463 patients were randomised to one of the four treatment 
groups. All randomised patients but one had received at least 1 dose of study drug. In total, 72 (77%) 
Assessment report

placebo patients and ~93% of patients in the baricitinib 2mg and 4mg groups completed the 16 week 
study period. Most patients who discontinued in the 2mg and 4 mg groups did so because of lack of 
efficacy. 
Baseline data 
At baseline, there were numerical between-group differences in gender; age, disease duration, disease 
severity (IGA of 4, EASI, BSA affected, itch, pain) and use of prior therapies were numerically similar. 
The majority (63% - 70%) of patients had used ciclosporin before, non-use usually was due to contra-
indications. Most (70%) patients were from Europe. 
Outcomes and estimation 
All 463 randomised patients were included in the efficacy analyses (ITT). Nearly all (97%) patients were 
compliant with study medication.  
Main efficacy data are presented in Table 31. The data for the 1mg group are not shown:

Development and validation of the Atopic Dermatitis Sleep Scale (ADSS) 
The MAH has performed validation studies of the 3-item patient-assessed Atopic Dermatitis Sleep Scale 
(ADSS) and submitted a report summarising the evidence of its measurement properties. The ADSS is 
a 3-Item, patient-administered questionnaire developed to assess the impact of itch from AD on sleep 
disturbance including difficulty falling asleep due to itch (Item 1), number of night time awakenings 
due to itch (Item 2), and difficulty getting back to sleep after waking due to itch last night (Item 3). 
Items 1 and 3 are rated using Likert scales ranging from 0 ‘not at all’ to 4 ‘very difficult’. Item 2 is 
rated as the number of times one woke up last night, ranging from 0 to 29. The items are scored 
individually, there is no total score. 
Figure 22 
Atopic Dermatitis Sleep Scale (ADSS) 
Content validity was evaluated using targeted literature review and semi-structured interviews for item 
generation and debriefing, with 31 adolescent and 63 adult patients with AD. Individual item 
performance (item distribution, and floor and ceiling effects) and the measurement properties 
(reliability, construct validity, responsiveness, and estimation of meaningful change) of the ADSS items 
were assessed using data from studies JAHL and JAHM.  
Results for test-retest reliability among stable patients showed ICC values ranging from 0.75 to 0.84 
(Item 1), 0.59 to 0.92 (Item 2), 0.68 to 0.78 (Item 3). Construct validity was evaluated using 
correlations with other outcomes in comparison with a priori hypotheses. ADSS items were cross-
sectionally moderately correlated with other patient reported outcomes (PGI-S-AD, DLQI, POEM) in 
studies JAHL and JAHM. When patients were categorized into subgroups based on PGI-S-AD and POEM, 
the groups of patients with lower disease severity experienced a significantly less sleep disturbance 
due to itch (p<0.01 for all comparisons in studies JAHL and JAHM). Ability to detect change was tested 
based on responder/non-respondership in POEM, changes of ADSS items between baseline and week 
16 were different for responder and non-responders in POEM. To derive a minimal clinically important 
difference in ADSS items, thresholds of change (very marked improvement, marked improvement, 
minimal improvement, etc.) in PGI-S-AD scores at week 4 and at week 16 were used. The mean score 
of patients with a moderate change in PGI-S-AD was used to define a MCID of -1.5, a minimal change 
was equated with a change of -1 and a large change with -3. The anchor variable suggested that a 
Assessment report

Page 84/158 
 
 
 
 
conservative threshold of 1.25-points for Items 1 and 3 and 1.5-points for Item 2 over 16 weeks was 
an appropriate criterion to interpret a treatment benefit. 
The MAH concluded that the psychometric properties of the ADSS were evaluated in terms of individual 
item performance (item distribution and floor and ceiling effects), and psychometric properties (test-
retest reliability, construct validity, known-groups validity, ability to detect change, and estimation of 
meaningful change. The Minimal Change Threshold provided were -1.25 for ADSS Items 1 and 3, and -
1.5 for ADSS Item 2. All psychometric properties were found to be at least excellent (with the 
exception of the response rate of the ADSS Item 3) which supports the use of the ADSS for assessing 
overall AD severity in moderate to severe AD. 
Development and validation of a Numerical Rating Scale for Skin Pain 
The Skin Pain NRS is a single-item measure designed to capture information on the self-reported skin 
pain severity by rating “the worst level of skin pain in the past 24 hours.” The patient reports this 
severity by selecting the number/integer from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). 
The content validity of the Skin Pain NRS was supported through a targeted literature review and 
(qualitative content elicitation and cognitive) interviews with AD patients. Individual item performance 
(item distribution and floor and ceiling effects) and measurement properties (reliability, construct 
validity, responsiveness, and estimation of meaningful change) of the Skin Pain NRS were assessed 
using data from studies JAHL and JAHM.  
Test-retest reliability analyses showed substantial agreement in scores among stable patients with the 
ICC ranging from 0.77 to 0.85. Regarding construct validity, correlations between the patient-reported 
Skin Pain NRS and other assessments included in Studies JAHL and JAHM were generally moderate to 
large at baseline and remained moderate at Week 16. The strongest cross-sectional association was 
present between the Skin Pain NRS and PGI-S-AD (r≥0.69). When patients were categorized into 
subgroups based on PGI-S-AD and POEM, the groups of patients with lower disease severity 
experienced a significantly less skin pain severity (p<.01 for all comparisons in Studies JAHL and 
JAHM). To evaluate the ability to detect change, tests of Skin Pain NRS changes between baseline and 
week 16 to discriminate responders and non-responders based on the change in the POEM were 
conducted. Statistically significant differences in mean changes indicated that Skin Pain NRS was 
sensitive enough to detect these important changes in disease severity (p<.05 for all). Finally, anchor-
based analyses were utilized to derive a clinical interpretation of the Skin Pain NRS with the weekly 
mean PGI-S-AD serving as the anchor variable. The anchor variable suggested that a conservative 
threshold s in Skin Pain NRS over 16 weeks was an appropriate criterion to interpret a treatment 
benefit at Week 16 in patients with AD. Approximately a 4-point change at Week 16 mean Skin Pain 
NRS is able to significantly distinguish betweenresponders and non-responders in PGI-S-AD. 
The MAH concluded that the evidence provided demonstrates that the Skin Pain NRS has sufficient 
reliability, validity, responsiveness, and interpterion standards to be considered a well-defined and 
reliable PRO instrument that is fit for purpose and suitable to be used in clinical trials to evaluate a 
labeling claim in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Data of 6 randomised double-blind placebo-controlled studies of baricitinib in patients with AD were 
submitted: 
•  A ‘phase 2’ study (JAHG) of 2 mg and 4 mg added to TCS, of 16-weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 85/158 
 
 
 
• 
Two identical ‘phase 3’ studies (JAHL and JAHM) of 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg monotherapy, of 16 
weeks. 
•  A ‘phase 3’ study (JAIY) of 2 mg and 4 mg added to TCS and allowing for concomitant TCI, of 
16-weeks. 
•  A ‘phase 3’ long-term extension study (JAHN) including dose continuation of 2 mg and 4 mg in 
responders and partial responders for in total 52 weeks, followed by a randomised down-
titration/stop sub-study. Total duration is 104 weeks.  
•  A ‘phase 3’ study (JAIN) of baricitinib added to TCS of 16 weeks (with follow-up phases). 
Study JAHN is ongoing and data were updated during the procedure. Patients were mainly recruited 
from JAHL, JAHM and JAIY. A sub study/cohort was added to evaluate efficacy and safety of baricitinib 
2-mg open-label in adult patients with moderate to severe AD who had not completed an originating 
study. 
In addition, Study JAIN is an ongoing Phase 3 study investigating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib 
in patients who experienced failure with ciclosporin or are intolerant to or have a contraindication to 
ciclosporin. Similar to Study JAIY, patients in Study JAIN are permitted to use low- and moderate-
potency TCS as concomitant therapy throughout the study. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
It is considered that in principle, the package of 16-week monotherapy studies JAHL and JAHM, 16-
week combination therapy study JAIY, 36-week (52-week in total) period 1 of follow-up study JAHN, 
supported by dose-finding study JAHG, is sufficiently informative to assess benefit-risk in the atopic 
dermatitis indication. Though study JAHN is ongoing, period 1 of 52 weeks was completed yet all 
patients coming from studies JAHL and JAHM. Efficacy data from patients coming from study JAIY were 
not complete but are available for 50% of patients up to week 24. The MAH also updated the results of 
the patients in the baricitinib 2 mg open label study. Final results of the step down/stop sub study 
performed in study JAHN will be available after the final database lock, which is projected to occur in 
2023. In the response to the first RSI, an update of the study JAHN was submitted, along with interim 
data from the ongoing Study JAIN. The data cutoff of JAIN was 28 November 2019 when all patients 
had completed at least 24 weeks of treatment. 
The studies were identical (JAHL and JAHM) or nearly identical (JAIY) regarding in/exclusion criteria 
and the included populations were quite similar regarding baseline characteristics. In study JAHM the 
proportion with an IGA of 4 was ~8% higher as compared to study JAHL, which is not considered 
clinically relevant seen the similarity between the studies in baseline values of other disease outcomes. 
In alignment with the requested indication, the disease characteristics do reflect a population with 
moderate to severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy. This is notably reflected by the nearly 
equal proportions of patients with an IGA of 3 (‘moderate’) or 4 (‘severe’) and the mean values for 
EASI and BSA affected, but is also reflected in mean values of other secondary outcomes such as Itch 
NRS, Skin pain NRS, and DLQI. By design, all included patients had used TCS and/or systemic 
therapies before. Nearly all patients had used TCS and a majority had used TCIs or systemic 
treatments. The CHMP considered that this sufficiently reflects the intended population. The 
distributions are such that this will support performance of subgroup analyses, such as failure of TCIs 
and failure of systemic therapies. The exclusion criteria are not overly restrictive. 
The choice for 2 mg and 4 mg as doses to be studied in the ‘phase 3’ AD studies are agreed by CHMP. 
Baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg are also the approved doses for the treatment of RA, with 4 mg as the 
standard dose. In psoriasis, doses from 2 mg up to 10 mg were tested in a dose-ranging study; while 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 86/158 
 
 
 
4 mg was effective and 2 mg only effective on itch, higher doses than 4 mg did not have a favourable 
safety profile. In the ‘phase 2’ AD study, the 4 mg dose was significantly superior to placebo in the 
primary outcome, EASI50 at week 16. The 2 mg dose was not statistically significant in the primary 
outcome, but the response was numerically only slightly smaller than the 4 mg dose. Superiority of 
baricitinib against placebo already began to appear at week 4 in EASI50 and other outcomes. Based on 
the overall efficacy results of the dose-finding study, it can be presumed that baricitinib 4 mg could be 
the most effective dose but that 2 mg may also be effective.  
Concomitant use of emollients during the studies reflects practical use. Concomitant use of TCS in the 
combination study was protocolised and started with a moderate-potency TCS that was switched to a 
low-potency TCS when lesions were clear or almost clear, which was then stopped after 7 days. TCS 
was to be resumed if lesions reappeared. Use of TCIs was permitted for areas of sensitive skin, for 
which TCS is not recommended. This use of concomitant TCS and TCIs reflects practical use on a 
standardised manner. While the initiation of rescue treatment includes a subjective component, the 
way rescue treatment should be used was well-defined in the protocols and rescue treatment was 
documented in the CRF. 
The primary outcome was reaching an IGA 0 or 1 with an improvement ≥2 points from baseline. This is 
agreed as a clinically meaningful outcome, in line with the CHMP Scientific Advice. As all included 
patients have an IGA of 3 or 4 at baseline, all patients having an IGA of 0 or 1 will have had an 
improvement of ≥2 points. As IGA relies on examination, the use of a validated version and training of 
examiners is endorsed. EASI75 was a key secondary outcome, which is agreed. SCORAD is a well-
known outcome measure for AD and its inclusion as secondary outcome therefore is agreed. Measures 
for itch, sleep disturbance, skin pain, and health-related quality of life were also included, which is 
endorsed to reflect the range of manifestations and consequences of AD. The MAH performed 
validation studies for the ADSS and Skin pain NRS, which is endorsed. The validity and the 
measurement properties of these measures is considered to be sufficiently supported. However, the 
minimal clinically important difference of 1.5 awakenings for ADSS items 2 was not understood by the 
CHMP. Therefore, it has been rounded-up to 2 when this outcome was included in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. 
Sample size for the monotherapy studies and combination therapy study was based on the results of 
(combination) dose-finding study JAHG and aimed at least finding a difference of 20% in IGA 0 or 1 
response, with placebo. Using a background of TCS in the dose-finding study/proof of concept study is 
understood, but post-hoc it appears that the treatment effect in IGA 0 or 1 was lower than expected 
based on JAHG results. 
The procedure for randomisation and stratification was adequate. Because baricitinib 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 
mg tablets differ in size, a double dummy design was implemented. Consequently, patients in studies 
JAHL and JAHM had to take 3 tablets daily (one for each dose) and in JAIY patients had to take 2 
tablets. The measures to keep patients and investigators and other personnel blinded appear to be 
appropriate. The analysis populations and statistical analyses were considered adequate. 
For purpose of representativeness to the European population, a sufficient number of patients were 
included in several EU countries: 54% in JAHL, 46% in JAHM, and 35% in JAIY. 
The degree of completion of the 16-week studies was high (>90%) and the vast majority of patients 
continued in the follow-up study JAHN. It is reassuring that discontinuations were lowest in the 
baricitinib 4 mg (highest dose) treated groups. Few patients discontinued due to adverse events, 
usually from the baricitinib treated groups. All randomised patients were included in the ITT population 
and nearly all patients could be included in the PP population, which is favourable. It can be anticipated 
that there will not be much difference in results between ITT and PP analyses.

The number of protocol amendments was limited and did not concern major changes in the conduct of 
the studies. The number of protocol violations was limited in number and usually concerned violations 
of in/exclusion criteria and significant non-compliance to study treatment. According to the MAH, all 
studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices and applicable local laws and 
regulations.  
Compliance to investigational treatment was high. In each of the studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY, few 
patients were classified as non-compliant and compliance was ≥98%. 
In monotherapy studies JAHL and JAHM most patients used rescue treatment, usually TCS and seldom 
systemic medications. Use of rescue was lowest in the baricitinib 4 mg groups (41% and 59%), equally 
higher in the 2 mg and 1 mg groups and highest in the placebo groups (67% and 77%). Rescue 
treatment was used as early as week 1 in all treatment groups, but more patients used rescue earlier 
in the placebo groups than in the baricitinib treated groups in a dose-dependent way. This means that 
in essence, combination therapy was an important component of the treatments studied in 
‘monotherapy’ studies JAHL and JAHM. In dedicated combination therapy study JAIY, all patients 
already were on TCS at baseline, and rescue treatment was used much less than in the monotherapy 
studies. In JAIY rescue was used in ~5% of the baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg groups and in 9% of the 
placebo-treated patients. The frequent use of rescue medication in JAHL and JAHM means that the 
estimand that includes the use of combination therapy (‘secondary censoring’) becomes important for 
the interpretation of the results of efficacy outcomes. 
Supportive study JAIN provides efficacy (and safety) data in patients for whom ciclosporin failed or is 
no option. This is an important subpopulation within the indication, to consider in clinical practice. Its 
design followed the outline of the pivotal studies and is considered to be reasonably well performed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The effects of baricitinib on IGA 0 or 1 were largest for the 4 mg dose in all three studies. In both 
monotherapy studies and in the combination therapy study, baricitinib 4 mg was statistically 
significantly more effective than placebo regarding IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 (primary outcome). 
Baricitinib 2 mg was statistically significantly more effective than placebo in reaching IGA 0 or 1 in the 
monotherapy studies, but not in the combination therapy study. Baricitinib 1 mg was not more 
effective than placebo. The analyses on the primary outcome were supported by the several pre-
planned sensitivity analyses. 
• 
In the monotherapy studies JAHL and JAHM, IGA 0 or 1 was reached by 17% and 14% of 
patients in the baricitinib 4 mg groups (both p<0.001), 11% and 11% in the 2 mg groups 
(both p<0.05), 12% and 9% in the 1 mg groups (both NS), 5% and 5% in the placebo groups. 
The difference (95%CI) with placebo was 12.0% (5.5% – 19.8%) and 9.3% (3.3% – 16.8%) 
for the 4 mg groups and 6.6 (0.9% – 13.7%) and 6.1 (0.6% – 13.0%) for the 2 mg groups, 
which was significant after adjustment for multiplicity. 
• 
• 
In the combination therapy study JAIY, IGA 0 or 1 was reached by 31% of patients in the 
baricitinib 4 mg group (p<0.01), 24% in the 2 mg group (NS), and 15% in the placebo group. 
The difference (95%CI) with placebo was 16.0% (4.9% – 26.6%) for the 4 mg group and 9.2 
(-1.4% – 19.5%) for the 2 mg group, which was significant after adjustment for multiplicity for 
the 4 mg dose group. 
The effect of baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg on IGA 0 or 1 appeared after 2-4 weeks of treatment in 
studies JAHL, JAHM and JAIY (Figure 8).

Response sizes of secondary outcomes (EASI75, improvement ≥4 points in the Itch NRS, change in 
ADSS item 2, SCORAD75, Skin pain NRS) were generally similar in the identical monotherapy studies 
JAHL and JAHM and usually numerically higher in the combination study JAIY. The statistical tests 
corrected for multiplicity in the main secondary outcomes were supportive for the baricitinib 4 mg dose 
in all three studies, the support for the 2 mg dose is less robust and it was not supported by the 
primary and secondary outcomes in the combination therapy study (Table 32).

In studies JAHL and JAHM, EASI75 at week 16 was reached by 25% and 21% of patient on 
baricitinib 4 mg, 19% and 18% on 2 mg, 17% and 13% on 1 mg, and 9% and 6% on placebo, 
which was statistically significant versus placebo for the 4 mg and 2 mg groups. In study JAIY, 
EASI75 at week 16 was reached by 48% of patient on baricitinib 4 mg + TCS, 43% on 2 mg + 
TCS, and 23% on placebo + TCS, which was statistically significant for 4 mg only. 
• 
In studies JAHL and JAHM an improvement ≥4 points in the Itch NRS at week 16 was reached 
by 22% and 19% of patients treated with baricitinib 4 mg, 12% and 15% in patients treated 
with 2 mg, and 7% and 5% in the placebo groups, which was statistically significant larger as 
compared to placebo for 4 mg but for 2 mg only in study JAHM. In study JAIY, an improvement 
in Itch NRS≥4 points was reached by 44% of patients treated with 4 mg, 38% of patients on 2 
mg, and 20% of patients on placebo, the difference was statistically significant from placebo 
for baricitinib 4 mg but not for 2 mg. 
The EASI75 response is considered to be key secondary outcome. In essence, the efficacy conclusions 
for week 16 are the same as for the primary outcome IGA 0 or 1. The treatment effect is dose-
dependent and largest for the baricitinib 4 mg dose. In the monotherapy studies, the treatment effect 
on EASI75 was statistically significant for both baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg. In the combination therapy 
study, only the treatment effect for baricitinib 4 mg was statistically significant. 
In all three 16-week studies, the results for IGA 0 or 1 and for EASI75 are supported by all other main 
secondary outcomes including Itch, sleep disturbance (ADSS), patient assessed skin manifestations 
(SCORAD, POEM), Skin pain, health related quality of life (DLQI), anxiety and depression (HADS). The 
CHMP therefore considered that the treatment effects found for baricitinib are robust over primary and 
main secondary outcomes, that the treatment effects are largest for the baricitinib 4 mg dose and if 
used with TCS, that clinical relevance of the treatment effect is notably supported by the effects on 
itch, sleep disturbance, skin pain, health-related quality of life and anxiety and depression.

For the baricitinib 4 mg dose, the responses in IGA 0 or 1 were 14% and 17% in the monotherapy 
studies and 31% in the combination therapy study. The treatment effect can be enhanced if baricitinib 
is used in combination with TCS. These responses (and the differences with placebo) may be 
appreciated as relatively low, seen numerically. This treatment effect also falls a bit below the a priori 
expectations from dose-finding study JAHG. In the monotherapy studies, rescue treatment with TCS 
was used by a majority of patients. In the baricitinib 4 mg groups, the responses in IGA 0 or 1 were 
6% to 8% higher if results were analysed when allowing for rescue treatment. In the combination 
therapy study where patients already were on TCS, rescue was not much used and did not make a 
difference in the result on group level. Consequently, the clinical relevance of the treatment effect of 
baricitinib 4 mg QD administered as monotherapy in both phase III clinical trials was questioned during 
the application. However, it has to be considered that baricitinib 4 mg as monotherapy was 
significantly more effective than placebo in reaching the main outcomes IGA 0 or 1 and EASI75 and 
this was supported by the results of other patient relevant outcomes such as itch, sleep disturbance 
due to itch, skin pain, DLQI and POEM. It can be argued that the proportions reaching IGA 0 or 1 on 
monotherapy were pretty low (Effects Table). On the other hand, while IGA 0 or 1 (‘clear’ or ‘almost 
clear’) is the ultimate treatment goal, the CHMP agreed that reaching a response/partial response (IGA 
0, 1 or 2) also is a clinically relevant outcome. About 30% of patients in the monotherapy trials 
reached IGA 0, 1 or 2, compared to ~11% in the placebo groups, which is considered clinically 
relevant. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the treatment effect of baricitinib 4 mg QD administered 
as monotherapy was clinically relevant. 
Because the treatment effect in the combination therapy study was larger than in the monotherapy 
studies, and while this effect also appears to be maintained, concomitant use of TCS appears to be a 
good treatment option. It can be envisaged that this use will be intermittent, in line with practice 
guidelines. Hence, at the CHMP’s request, the added value of treatment with TCS was included in the 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The onset of effect in IGA 0 or 1 but also EASI75 becomes apparent between 2 – 4 weeks, for 
baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg, with or without concomitant TCS. This is considered a clinically relevant 
timing for onset of action. From prognostic analyses it appeared that lack of response at week 8 is 
predictive for a lack of response at later time points. 
In maintenance study JAHN, data of patients who continue 4 mg as responders and partial responders  
suggest that treatment efficacy gradually decreases over time in the 4 mg baricitinib QD arm of 
originating study responders and partial responders. Seventy (70) patients were analysed at start, 64 
patients at week 36. IGA 0/1 decreases from 45.7% at start to 37.5% at week 36 (-8.2%) of study 
JAHN. This decrease is even more obvious in the group responders and partial responders which drops 
from 100% at start to 57.8% at week 36 (-42.2%). From these numbers, it can be calculated that 
there are 38/70 (54%) IGA=2 patients at start (partial responders) and 13/64 (20%) partial 
responders at week 36, showing a loss of partial response in a majority of patients (2.6 times lower at 
week 36 compared to start, or a decrease of 62% in number of partial responders). Of note, in the 
small populations investigated, most endpoints show a better maintenance of effect in the 2 mg 
baricitinib group compared to the 4 mg baricitinib group. Therefore, the SmPC statement proposed by 
the MAH “Some patients with initial partial response may subsequently improve with continued 
treatment beyond 12 weeks” was questioned by the CHMP. The MAH performed a prognostic 
‘responder’ analysis to investigate whether the lack of a partial response at an earlier time point could 
be predictive of failure to achieve a complete response at a later time point. Single predictors or 
combinations thereof, analysed at weeks 2, 4 and 8, were assessed for their negative predictive value 
in EASI75 and Itch NRS ≥ 4 and IGA 0,1 response at week 16. These analyses consistently 
demonstrated that highest sensitivity and negative predictive value were obtained at week 8 of 
treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 90/158 
 
 
 
Based on the two above points, it has been indicated at the CHMP’s request that treatment should be 
discontinued if no response is reached by week 8 in the Section 4.2 of the SmPC. In addition, the 
proposed statement that some patients may improve after 12 weeks has been deleted at the CHMP’s 
request. 
While there was a maintenance of effect in the patients who were followed up to week 52, the overall 
maintenance of effect if on monotherapy appeared to be better for the 2 mg dose as compared to the 
4 mg dose. In the responders/partial responders continuing baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg, the IGA 0 or 1 
response was similar at baseline of study JAHN with ~46% in both groups (the complementary 
proportions were partial responders with an IGA of 2). However, after a total follow-up of 32 weeks 
and 52 weeks, responses were highest in the baricitinib 2 mg treated patients. In the 4 mg treated 
patients, the response became quite similar to the response in the 1 mg group. While it is known that 
responses may decline over time, due to regression of the mean, the differential effect is difficult to 
understand. As the study is still blinded, it is unlikely that expectations have driven the differential 
result in maintenance. It does not seem likely that concomitant TCS use in the 2 mg group will explain 
the effect, as use of TCS in study JAHN was generally low and intermittent. 
A similar trend as in IGA 0 or 1, with better maintenance in the 2 mg dose as compared to the 4 mg 
dose, is also seen in EASI75, but less in Itch NRS response. In contrast to IGA 0 or 1 and EASI, Itch 
NRS slowly declined in both dose groups, with the highest response in the 4 mg group. If all patients 
on baricitinib 4 mg (responder and partial responders, non-responders) are analysed as a group, it 
appears that the results on IGA 0 or 1 and EASI75 are more stable. This may happen through 
regression to the mean and may mean that some patient need more time to develop a response, or 
develop a response in combination with TCS. While the tendency of a decline in response that is larger 
for baricitinib 4 mg and less of baricitinib 2 mg is not readily understood, it points out that baricitinib 2 
mg may be a good option for maintenance treatment in patients who have reached a satisfactory 
response. The secondary outcomes on sleep quality (ADSS item 2), skin pain and quality of life (DLQI) 
are generally supportive for maintenance in the two doses, baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg. In period 2 of 
study JAHN a step-down/stop substudy will be performed, and these results may add to the results of 
this strategy. In line with the posology for RA, the MAH was asked by the CHMP to discuss the option 
to include a posology recommendation in the SmPC like: ‘A dose of 2 mg once daily may also be 
considered for patients who have achieved sustained control of disease activity with 4 mg once daily’. 
In response, this statement was included in the Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Predefined subgroup analyses were performed for a limited set of variables, which is endorsed by the 
CHMP. Subgroup analyses were performed separately for monotherapy (pooled studies) and 
combination therapy, which is agreed by the CHMP. The IGA 0 or 1, EASI75 and Itch NRS 
improvement ≥4 points were used as outcomes for the subgroup analyses. As the proportion of 
patients reaching IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 was relatively low, this limits subgroup analyses due to low 
sample sizes. Therefore, in the assessment it was focussed on IGA 0 or 1 as well as EASI75.  
Males overall seem to perform worse than females, but there is a clinically relevant treatment effect 
also in males. Subgroup analysis for age was redone using tertiles, no age effect was apparent. For 
patients with moderate levels of disease activity (IGA 3) it was overall easier to reach a response (IGA 
0 or 1) as compared to patients with severe disease (IGA 4). Over studies and major outcomes, there 
was a tendency that responses were higher in the EU subgroup as compared to the rest-of-the-world.  
Previous failure of ciclosporin did not seem to have a negative influence on the treatment effect, at 
least for the 4 mg dose. In case of previous use of TCI, the treatment effect may be somewhat smaller 
if on monotherapy with baricitinib. The number of patients having used dupilumab before was small, 
but there was no indication that treatment with baricitinib would be ineffective if patients had 
previously used dupilumab. The CHMP considered that these results have no further consequences for 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 91/158 
 
 
 
the SmPC yet, as treatment effects appear to be present across all subgroups. Study JAIN was 
specifically performed in patients with ciclosporin failure of for whom ciclosporin is contra-indicated, 
though this study standardly included concomitant TCS with baricitinib or placebo. Its results 
confirmed the efficacy of baricitinib in this subpopulation. Because of its relevance to the clinical 
practice, the study results from study JAIN are included in the Section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The CHMP had concerns about the text proposal concerning SmPC section 5.1 which was considered 
too extensive. The MAH made a revised proposal for Section 5.1 and considerably shortened section 
5.1 of the SmPC to describe the efficacy of baricitinib in Atopic Dermatitis.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In all three studies (JAHL, JAHM, JAIY), baricitinib 4 mg was statistically significant more effective than 
placebo in reaching IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 (with a ≥2 points improvement from baseline), while 
adjusting for multiplicity. Baricitinib 2 mg was more effective than placebo in reaching IGA 0 or 1 at 
week 16 in the monotherapy studies, but not in the combination therapy study. The 1 mg dose was 
not more effective than placebo. The results were supported by sensitivity analyses. 
A significantly larger proportion of patients randomised to baricitinib 4 mg achieved an IGA 0 or 1 
response (primary outcome), EASI75, or an improvement of ≥ 4 points on the Itch NRS compared to 
placebo at week 16  
Treatment effects in subgroups (weight, age, gender, race, disease severity, and previous treatment, 
including immunosuppressants) were consistent with the results in the overall study population. 
The effect after 16 weeks appears to be largely maintained over 52 weeks, similar in the patients 
continuing 2 mg and 4 mg, whether on monotherapy or on combination therapy. 
The CHMP concluded that baricitinib 4 mg is the most effective dose, and that the effects can be 
enhanced by concomitant use of TCS. In clinical practice, concomitant intermittent use of TCS can be 
expected and this is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. This also is supported by the larger treatment 
effects in the combination therapy study that were basically maintained over time.  
Because maintenance of effects in (partial) responders on 4 mg are well maintained with the 2 mg 
dose, the SmPC includes the opportunity to lower the dose to 2 mg if a desirable target level of AD is 
reached. More information will be available upon completion of the down-titration/stop substudy in 
period 2 of study JAHN (ongoing and the CHMP recommends that the MAH submits the final CSR from 
study JAHN).  
However, as indicated in Section 4.2 of the SmPC, treatment should be discontinued if no response is 
reached by week 8. 
In conclusion, the CHMP considers that the efficacy of baricitinib is supported by the data submitted in 
the claimed indication: “Atopic Dermatitis: Olumiant is indicated for the treatment of moderate to 
severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.” 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Currently, Olumiant (baricitinib) is indicated for the treatment of adults with RA, as second-line 
therapy. Baricitinib has a complex safety profile. Therefore, it is recommended in the SmPC that 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 92/158 
 
 
 
baricitinib should only be used under supervision of an experienced specialist. An overview of the 
safety profile of baricitinib in the currently registered RA indication is provided below. 
The following Adverse Drugs Reactions have been included in the SmPC for the RA indication: 
infections (upper respiratory tract infections, herpes simplex and herpes zoster, gastroenteritis and 
urinary tract infections), pulmonary embolism/deep venous thrombosis, neutropenia and 
thrombocytosis, increase of CPK and of weight, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, liver function tests 
(AST, ALT), nausea and acne, swelling of the face and urticaria. 
As expected for an immune-modulating drug, baricitinib causes infections. These were mainly upper- 
respiratory tract infections. Serious infections rates according to ICH criteria were overall low. Although 
there was no treatment related effect, as precautionary measures, routine monitoring of neutropenia 
and lymphopenia is included in the SmPC (see section 4.4 of the SmPC) as these are known to be 
related to infections. Due to its mode of action, baricitinib causes viral reactivation. In RA, herpes 
zoster and herpes simplex were more frequently reported for baricitinib than for placebo and MTX 
monotherapy. Due to the risks of complicated herpes zoster infection, several risk minimization 
measures have been put in place, such as lowering the dose to 2 mg for patients at risk (e.g. in 
elderly, patients with a history of recurrent infections), the instructions in the SmPC (see section 4.4 of 
the SmPC) to interrupt treatment at first sign of herpes zoster and a patient’ alert card. Thus far, there 
was no signal of opportunistic infections above the background risk. Because of the mode of action of 
baricitinib, opportunistic infections are certainly not excluded.  
Malignancies did not occur more frequently than expected, but more long-term follow-up is needed to 
be more certain. A general warning of enhanced risk of malignancies including lymphoma in the 
general RA patient population has been added to the SmPC (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Baricitinib is known to interfere with haematopoiesis above the therapeutic dose. Overall, the rate of 
anaemia was marginally increased at the proposed dose level of 4 mg. A warning has been included in 
the SmPC (section 4.4) to monitor Hb routinely. Events of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and 
pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving baricitinib. Olumiant should be 
used with caution in patients with risk factors for DVT/PE (see section 4.4 of the SmPC) and baricitinib 
should be discontinued if clinical features of DVT/PE occur. 
Baricitinib had a clear and consistent inducing effect on cholesterol –both LDL and HDL. Moreover, 
weight and waist circumference also increased. Thus far, these changes are not been associated with a 
higher incidence of CV events/MACE for baricitinib, what normally would be expected if cholesterol 
increases (MACE was overall uncommon). Lipid increments will be further followed in a PASS. Routine 
monitoring of lipids is recommended in the SmPC (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
ALT and AST elevations were very common, although severe ALT or AST elevations were overall rare. 
Baricitinib 4 mg caused a steady increment of serum creatinine levels of about 5 μg/ml in the total 
study population (i.e non-renal patients). The Applicant postulated that the increased creatinine was 
due to an interaction effect of baricitinib on tubular transporters of creatinine, by inhibition of the OCT-
2, MATE-1, and MATE-2K transporters. Consequently, GFR estimates based on creatinine levels 
decreased with on average 8.0 mL/min/BSA from baseline. Possibly, this effect is an interaction at the 
tubular level of creatinine excretion, and this is no signal of loss of renal capacity. This has been 
adequately addressed in the SmPC section 5.1. For moderate renal impaired patients, the dose is 
restricted to 2 mg (SmPC section 4.2), to prevent accumulation of the drug, which is renally cleared. 
Also CPK increments were commonly reported. However, these were not clearly accompanied with 
clinical symptoms of muscle damage, and therefore do not contribute negatively to the overall B/R 
balance. Myopathy has been included in the RMP as potential risk.

Additional safety data were submitted from 3 ongoing studies in patients with AD: 
•  A 104-week, double-blind, ‘phase 3’ study of 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg in combination with TCS, in 
patients who have had ciclosporin (JAIN). 
•  A 104-week, double-blind ‘phase 3’ monotherapy study of 1 mg and 2 mg (JAIW). 
•  A 104-week, ‘phase 3’ open-label long-term extension study of 2 mg (JAIX). 
JAIW and JAIX are being performed in the US and Canada. 
For more details of the study designs of studies JAHG, JAHL, JAHM and JAHN, it is referred to the 
efficacy section. A figure of the design of study JAHN can be found below (Figure 23).

Studies JAHG, JAHL, JAHM and JAIY contributed to the placebo-controlled data from baseline to week 
16, though not all patients from JAIY had completed the full period. Study JAHN is the long term (104 
weeks in total) follow-up of JAHL, JAHM and JAIY.  
Unblinded safety data for all patients originating from Studies JAHL and JAHM up to Week 52 in Study 
JAHN (that is 68 weeks of total treatment duration including the originating studies) were included in 
this submission. At the time of database lock, not all patients in Study JAHN originating from Study JAIY 
had been re-randomised based on their responder status at baseline study of JAHN (Figure 24). Since 
this up-titration phase is a double-blind, randomized period, JAHN data from patients originating from 
Study JAIY remain blinded and only blinded SAEs were analysed. 
At Week 52 in Study JAHN, patients are evaluated for eligibility to enter a randomized, withdrawal, and 
down-titration sub-study (Figure 23). Study JAHN data beyond Week 52 remain blinded and therefore, 
only blinded SAE data beyond Week 52 are included in this submission.

Study contributions to the safety data 
For this submission, database lock of study JAIY was at 13 August 2019 and database lock of study JAHN 
was at 2 July 2019. The other studies were completed and JAHG was locked in 2017, JAHL and JAHM 
were locked in January 2019. 
In the response to the first RSI, an update of the study JAHN was submitted, along with interim data 
from the ongoing Study JAIN. The data cutoff of JAIN was 28 November 2019 when all patients had 
completed at least 24 weeks of treatment.  
The safety population is defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. The 
safety data sets of the individual studies were integrated in ‘analysis sets’ for the evaluation of safety (

Table 33). These sets aim at the short term (16-week) comparison of baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg with 
placebo, and the long term (52 weeks + 16 weeks = 68 weeks) comparison of baricitinib 4 mg and 2 
mg. In addition, there is an ‘all baricitinib’ set in which all exposures to baricitinib are integrated, without 
contrast between doses.

and JAIY/JAHN) 
The monotherapy studies were not designed to comprehensively evaluate the duration and outcome of 
TCS rescue events, as the main objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib as a 
monotherapy treatment for AD. Once the patients were rescued using TCS, investigators were allowed 
to continue providing TCS to the rescued patients as needed and per the investigator’s 
recommendation.  
The LTE Study JAHN was intended to mimic clinical practice as much as possible by allowing use of 
concomitant TCS, when needed, per the investigator’s assessment. Therefore, treatment arms across 
the studies could only compare timing of the first rescue, amount of TCS used over the 16-week PC 
period upon rescue, and frequency of TCS application by the rescued patients.

For the ‘as-treated’ safety analysis datasets, the following rules were applied to determine if patients 
were considered ‘on monotherapy’ or ‘on TCS’ at the time of the event:  
• 
Patients from the monotherapy Studies JAHL and JAHM that were rescued using TCS due to a 
lack or loss of response were not censored in these datasets. Patients were considered as ‘on 
monotherapy’ up to the point of rescue and were subsequently counted as ‘on TCS’ for the 
remainder of the study. 
•  All patients from the TCS combination Study JAIY were considered as ‘on TCS’. 
• 
In the LTE Study JAHN, TCS were allowed any time at the investigator’s discretion (‘optional 
use’). 
o  Patients originating from the Study JAIY were considered as ‘on TCS’ throughout 
Study JAHN as they were provided TCS during the originating study.  
o  As for the monotherapy studies, patients in Study JAHN originating from Study 
JAHL/JAHM were counted as ‘on TCS’ for the remainder of the study from the point 
of 
 TCS rescue in Studies JAHL and JAHM (unlike in the original 5 integrated analysis 
datasets, where monotherapy patients were classified as ‘monotherapy’ even when 
they were rescued using TCS), and 
 TCS use in Study JAHN if they were not rescued in Studies JAHL and JAHM. 
Adverse events were attributed to the dose patients were taking at the time of the onset of the event. 
Incidence rates (IRs) of AEs were calculated based on patient-years at risk (PYR) including exposure to 
treatment in the monotherapy and combination therapy, and exposure from the switch or rescue to 
combination therapy. 
In response to the CHMP request to present safety data in which the events are attributed to the dose 
only, ‘as-treated’ analyses are provided (Table 34) in which the AEs were attributed to the treatment 
patients were taking at the time of the onset of the event.

a  The ‘as-treated’ analysis attributes the event to the dose taken at the time of the event. 
b  Patients could also be counted in more than 1 baricitinib dose groups if they were re-randomised or their dose 
downtitrated to a different dose in Study JAHN. 
A total of 2531 patients with AD were exposed to baricitinib at any dose (1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg) across 
the entire AD baricitinib development programme (safety population). Overall exposure was 2247.4 
patient-years.  
For any baricitinib dose 
•  1700 patients with AD were exposed for at least 32 weeks, and 
•  1106 patients with AD were exposed for at least 52 weeks. 
For the 2-mg dose 
•  850 patients were treated for at least 32 weeks, and 
•  498 patients were treated for at least 52 weeks. 
For the 4-mg dose 
•  676 patients were treated for at least 32 weeks, and 
•  486 patients were treated for at least 52 weeks. 
From the patient flow in the integrated safety set (composed of studies JAHG, JAHL, JAHM, and JAIY) it 
appears that most patients completed the placebo-controlled phase of 16 weeks. On both doses, 2 mg 
and 4 mg, >100 patients have had >52 weeks of follow-up (Table 35).

Baseline data  
Initially submitted database  
The baseline data of the integrated safety set are reflecting the baseline characteristics of the originating 
studies (JAHG, JAHL, JAHM and JAIY). Overall, baseline demographic characteristics were similar for the 
placebo and baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg groups (Table 37). The patients were on average 35 years old 
and more than half of the patients were males. Nearly half of the patients were included in European 
centres. 
Disease duration in all three groups was ~25 years and 70% had experiences disease flares in the 
past  year.  Previous  treatments  were  similar  between  the  groups.  About  15%  had  pharmacological 
treatment  for  skin  infections  last  year,  nearly  all  (95%)  patients  have  had  topical  therapy  before, 
usually TCS (~89%) but also TCI (54% - 60%) and oral ciclosporin (31% - 36%) had been used.

Patient disposition 
Initially submitted database  
For the integrated safety analysis sets, patient disposition was analysed for permanent discontinuation 
of study drug and discontinuation from study. Patients who discontinued study drug were encouraged to

remain in the study through the primary time point for safety monitoring purposes. A patient may have 
discontinued study drug but completed the planned study period. 
In the 16-week placebo-controlled period, more than 90% of patients completed the study (Table 38). 
Discontinuations  occurred  most  in  the  placebo  group  and  least  in  the  baricitinib  4  mg  group.  In  the 
placebo group, most patients discontinued because of lack of efficacy/withdrawal by patient, which also 
were  the  most  mentioned  reasons  for  withdrawal  in  the  2  mg  group.  In  the  baricitinib  4  mg  group, 
adverse events was the most occurring reason for withdrawal. 
In the extended treatment data set, the most occurring reason for withdrawal with 2 mg and 4 mg was 
lack of efficacy, while adverse events occurred more often in 4 mg and withdrawal by patient occurred 
more often with 2 mg (Table 39). By design, dose switches were only found in the 2 mg group.

Adverse events 
Overview of Adverse Events 
In the placebo-controlled period, treatment emergent AEs occurred more frequently in the baricitinib 2 
mg (57%) and 4 mg (58%) groups, as compared to the placebo (52%) group . In all treatment 
groups, the AEs usually were mild and moderate and seldom severe. SAEs did occur in 2.9% of the 
placebo group and with 1.6% and 1.8% in the 2 mg and 4 mg groups. Relatively more patients on 
baricitinib than on placebo discontinued due to AEs, mostly in the 4 mg group. 
In the initially submitted, extended phase safety data set, the occurrence of AEs was increased and 
was larger for the baricitinib 4 mg group (72%) as compared to the 2 mg group (64%). It appeared 
that the number of SAEs remained at 7 in the baricitinib 2 mg group and became 25 (6.8%) in the 4 
mg group. The number of severe and of moderate AEs also was slightly higher in the baricitinib 4 mg 
group as compared to 2 mg. Discontinuations of study drug or the study occurred more frequently 
while on baricitinib 4 mg. One death occurred while on baricitinib. 
In study JAHN, there was a numerically higher incidence rate (IR) of TEAEs reported in the baricitinib 
2-mg and 4-mg groups compared with placebo group from Week 0 to Week 52, but there was no dose 
relationship seen between 2-mg (143.3) and 4-mg (144.7), With regard to SAEs, no clinically 
meaningful difference in the IR of SAEs was observed across the treatment groups, with the highest IR 
reported in the placebo group. 
The IR of permanent discontinuations due to study drug was 3.3 for the baricitinib 2-mg group, 4.2 for 
the 4-mg treatment group, and no patients permanently discontinued due to an AE in the 1-mg or 
placebo group. 
One death occurred during the study in the baricitinib 4-mg treatment group 
In the updated ‘as treated’ safety data IRs for TEAEs were consistently higher for monotherapy 
compared to TCS combination use regardless of dose group or dataset, except for the baricitinib 4-mg 
TCS group (346.8) compared to monotherapy (332.7) in the PC period. TEAEs were generally mild to 
moderate in severity, and severe TEAEs had similar IRs among treatment regimens. 
IRs for discontinuations due to AEs were consistently higher for TCS versus monotherapy regardless of 
dose group or dataset, the highest IR was for 4 mg TCS (10.9) compared to monotherapy (2.0) in the 
PC period. 
Serious adverse event (SAE) IRs appear to be consistently higher for TCS combination therapy versus 
monotherapy; In the PC period, TCS (6.9) had a higher IR than monotherapy (2.3) in the 2-mg group; 
and TCS (12.0) IR was higher than monotherapy (3.9) in the 4-mg group. In the extended period, IRs 
were higher in TCS than in monotherapy for both doses: (4.2 versus 2.2 for 2 mg; 8.0 versus 6.6 for 4 
mg) and in the All BARI AD group, TCS (6.7) had a higher IR than monotherapy (4.2). Numerical 
differences in SAE IRs between doses were observed. Overall, the SAE IRs were higher at 4 mg 
compared to 2 mg but were lower than PBO in all groups except the baricitinib 4-mg TCS group. The 
highest IR was noted in the baricitinib 4-mg TCS group within the PC period.

Overview of Adverse Events 
At the CHMP’s request, the MAH provided an overview of AEs based on the ‘as treated’ analysis. There 
are no clinically relevant differences in the overview of AEs between the ‘as-treated’ analysis described 
in this response (Table 41) and the ‘as-randomised’ analyses by dose described in the original 
submission (Table 40). The ‘as-treated’ analysis showed a smaller magnitude of difference among the 
IR of SAEs, permanent discontinuations, and temporary interruptions by dose compared to the original 
submission. A larger difference in IR between doses was noted for TEAEs with a higher IR of TEAEs for 
2-mg treated patients compared to 4 mg in the ‘as-treated’ analysis compared to the ‘as-randomised’ 
analysis.

Adverse events by System Organ Class 
In the placebo-controlled period, AEs did occur most frequently in the SOCs for Infections and 
Infestations, Skin and subcutaneous disorders, Investigations, Gastrointestinal disorders, and Nervous 
system disorders (Table below). Infections and infestations were more common in the baricitinib 2 mg 
(34%) and 4 mg (34%) groups as compared to the placebo group (29%). AEs concerning 
Investigations occurred about equally in the placebo (3.1%) and baricitinib 2 mg (3.1%) groups and 
more often in the 4 mg group (8.6%). Nervous system disorders appeared to occur more often in the 
baricitinib 2 mg (9.2%) and 4 mg (7.9%) groups as compared to placebo (5.6%). Skin and 
subcutaneous disorders and Gastrointestinal disorders occurred about equally in all three treatment 
groups (Table 42).

Table 42 
Adverse Events by SOC in the placebo-controlled period 
In the initial data of the extended safety data set in AD, most AEs occurred in the SOC for Infections 
and Infestations and slightly more frequently in the baricitinib 4 mg group (50%) as compared to the 2 
mg group (46%). Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders also were slightly more frequent in the 4 mg 
group (16%) versus the 2 mg group (11%). AEs concerning Investigations occurred more frequently in 
the baricitinib 4 mg group (13%) as compared to the 2 mg group (3.7%). Over the SOCs with less 
frequently occurring AEs, higher percentages were noted for baricitinib 4 mg as compared to 2 mg for: 
General Disorders and administration site conditions; Eye disorders; Metabolism and nutrition 
disorders; Psychiatric disorders; Blood and lymphatic system disorders; Vascular disorders; 
Neoplasms; Renal and urinary disorders; Cardiac disorders. 
In the updated safety data set, similar to the original analyses, the most frequently reported AEs in the 
‘as-treated’ safety analysis set were in the ‘Infections and infestations’ SOC. There were no clinically 
relevant differences between monotherapy and TCS for baricitinib. No consistent pattern was 
observed, suggesting that 1 treatment (monotherapy or TCS) has a higher IR of infectious TEAEs than 
the other. 
Use of TCS can potentially place patients at an increased risk of skin infections, both viral and 
bacterial, but no clinically relevant differences were noted in skin-related infections between TCS and 
monotherapy regimens. Most of the reported skin infections were classified as nonserious.  
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020

In addition to skin infections, use of TCS is associated also with an increased risk of cutaneous adverse 
effects. Overall, there were no relevant differences between monotherapy and TCS, and dose groups 
for AEs related to the skin. 
There were 4 SOCs that had higher IRs for TCS compared to monotherapy (Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders, Psychiatric disorders, Eye disorders, Neoplasms benign, malignant and 
unspecified), and 5 SOCs where monotherapy had higher IRs than TCS (Metabolism and nutrition 
disorders, Vascular disorders, Gastrointestinal disorders, Nervous system disorders, and General 
disorders).

Note: Interpretation of the results in this table is challenging and has similar limitations to observational data. Using this table to assess a potential dose relationship is problematic 
due to study and treatment being confounded and risk over time changes due to reasons other than treatment exposure to dose.

Common Adverse Events 
In the initial data base, in the placebo-controlled period, headache, increased blood creatine 
phosphokinase (CPK), upper respiratory tract infection, oral herpes and herpes simplex, upper 
abdominal pain, did occur more frequently in the baricitinib treated patients as compared to placebo 
treated patients (Table 44).  
In the extended safety data, upper respiratory tract infection and bronchitis, oral herpes and herpes 
simplex, diarrhoea, increased blood CPK, folliculitis, ALT and AST increased occurred notably more 
often with baricitinib 4 mg as with 2 mg (Table 44). 
Headache was more common in both the baricitinib 2 mg (7.4%) and 4 mg (7.5%) groups as 
compared to placebo (3.3%). Also, upper respiratory tract infection occurred both in the 2 mg (4.0%) 
and 4 mg (3.3%) more often than in the placebo group (2.1%). Similarly, upper abdominal pain 
occurred in the 2 mg (2.0%) and 4 mg (2.4%) more often than in the placebo group (1.2%). 
Oral herpes and herpes simplex both occurred about as much in the 2 mg group (1.3% and 2.5%) as 
in the 4 mg group (1.6% and 2.8%) which was more often as compared to placebo (0.9% and 1.1%). 
Herpes zoster did not occur in the 4 mg group, but there were cases in the placebo group as well as 
the 2 mg group. Among the skin conditions, also folliculitis was more frequent in the baricitinib 2 mg 
(1.9%) and 4 mg (2.2%) groups as compared to placebo (1.5%). In contrast, atopic dermatitis as AE 
was more frequent in the placebo group and least frequent in the baricitinib 4 mg group.  
Increased blood CPK was more common in the baricitinib 4 mg group (4.2%) as compared to the 2 mg 
group (1.3%) as compared to placebo (0.6%). Diarrhoea occurred more often in the 4 mg as in the 2 
mg group, but also occurred in the placebo group more often than with 2 mg. 
In the updated extended phase, no consistent pattern was observed, suggesting that 1 treatment 
(monotherapy or TCS) has a higher IR of infectious TEAEs than the other. 
Most of the reported skin infections were classified as nonserious and those most commonly reported 
were herpes simplex, oral herpes, and folliculitis. Other common reported AEs included 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and urinary tract infection (UTI). These 
events are recognised ADRs associated with baricitinib that are included in the baricitinib SmPC. There 
were no clinically relevant differences between monotherapy and TCS groups for these events.  
In contrast to the PC period, AD was reported more frequently in patients on monotherapy for the 
baricitinib 4-mg dose, and although TCS had a higher IR than monotherapy for the baricitinib 2-mg 
dose, the difference was of a smaller magnitude than that observed in the PC period. For acne there 
was not a consistently higher IR seen for the TCS groups. There was a possible dose response in the 
TCS group in the PC period, but it was not as evident in the extended period. The highest IRs were 
reported in baricitinib-treated patients (2 mg and 4 mg). Acne is included in the baricitinib EU SmPC as 
an ADR that has been identified in both the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and AD indications.

In the SOC ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’ the most commonly reported AEs were abdominal pain upper, 
diarrhoea, and nausea. These events were generally reported at higher IRs in monotherapy for each 
analysis set. There was a possible treatment regimen-related effect at both baricitinib doses, with 
monotherapy having consistently higher IRs than TCS combination therapy for abdominal pain upper. 
Abdominal pain is currently included as an ADR to the SmPC.  
For study Jahn, common TEAEs, occurring in 2% or more of patients in any treatment group, are 
summarized in Table 286.

corticosteroids; URTI = upper respiratory tract infection; UTI = urinary tract infection. 
Note: Interpretation of the results in this table is challenging and has similar limitations to observational data. Using this table to assess a potential dose relationship is problematic 
due to study and treatment being confounded and risk over time changes due to reasons other than treatment exposure to dose.

mg in study JAHN but received 2 mg because of a GFR<60ml/min/1.73m2. The cause of death was a GI 
bleed, more than 12 months after start of baricitinib and while being on 2 mg for 9 months. The patient 
had  no  known  risk  factors  for  GI  bleed,  but  had  a  low  haematocrit  and  a  low  erythrocyte  count  at 
baseline, which may point to a possible earlier bleed. 
Overall, the SAE IRs appear to be consistently higher for TCS combination therapy versus 
monotherapy and  numerical differences between doses were also observed. the most commonly 
reported AE accounting for the higher rate of SAEs in 4 mg relative to 2 mg is worsening of AD. 
In the 16-week placebo controlled treatment period, the proportion of patients with at least one SAE 
was higher in the placebo group (2.9%) as compared to the baricitinib 2 mg (1.6%) and 4 mg (1.8%) 
groups.  Most  SAEs  occurred  in  the  SOCs  of  skin  and  subcutaneous  disorders,  and  infections  and 
infestations.  The  corresponding  SAEs  in  the  placebo  group  were:  atopic  dermatitis  (n=5),  exfoliative 
dermatitis (n=1), eczema herpeticum (n=2), eye infection (n=1), post-operative abcess (n=1). In the 
baricitinib 2 mg group these were: atopic dermatitis (n=2), eczema (n=1), and single occurrences of 
bronchitis, cellulitis, staphylococcal infection. In the baricitinib 4 mg group these were: atopic dermatitis 
(n=1), tonsilitis (n=1).  
In infections there was a tendency towards more serious infections in TCS, but the number of reports 
of each event was small, with most events having only 1 report. The exception to this pattern 
continues to be eczema herpeticum, which was reported as an SAE for 3 patients treated with 4 mg 
(IR = 0.6) and for 1 patient (IR = 0.2) treated with 2 mg. In addition, serious skin infections were 
reported more frequently with 4 mg (n = 6, IR = 1.3) compared with 2 mg (n = 2, IR = 0.5). These 
skin infections included 2 cases of cellulitis in patients treated with either 2 mg or 4 mg, unspecified 
staphylococcal infection of the skin (1 each in 2 mg and 4 mg), and a single case each of skin bacterial 
infection, staphylococcal skin infection, and erysipelas reported in the 4-mg group. In addition, there 
were 2 cases of toxic skin eruption in the baricitinib 4 mg group, both were considered to be related to 
the study drug by the investigator and study drug was discontinued.

In addition, there were 2 cases of toxic skin eruption in the baricitinib 4 mg group, both were 
considered to be related to the study drug by the investigator and study drug was discontinued. 
In the updated database, the frequency and IR of SAEs in the updated database had small changes, 
with a decrease in the rate for PBO and 2 mg, and an increase in the rate for 4 mg. The rates for 2 mg 
and 4 mg were both lower than PBO during the PC period. As in the original database, frequency and 
IR of SAEs was higher for baricitinib 4 mg than for baricitinib 2 mg during the extension period (in the 
Ext BARI 2-mg and 4-mg analysis set).  
In the updated analysis of those patients treated with 2 mg in the open-label addendum, a total of 11 
patients (4.5%) reported SAEs and the IR was 7.4. Although this IR is less than that observed in the 
original submission (10.6) for this addendum, the IR for the 2-mg group remains higher than that 
observed in the updated Ext BARI 2-mg and 4-mg dataset for 2 mg (3.5), and both IRs are lower than 
the IR observed for PBO (8.0) in the updated PC database. Although the rates are lower than PBO, 
there was still a higher IR for SAEs for 4-mg compared to 2-mg in the extended period.

Further analysis of the nature of the SAEs in patients treated with baricitinib 4 mg compared with 2 mg 
has been conducted to characterise the clinical significance of the observed difference in SAE 
incidence. Overall, there has been a minimal change compared with these SAEs in the original 
submission. Most of the SAEs continue to be reported only once. The most common event accounting 
for the higher rate of SAEs in the 4 mg relative to the 2 mg group is worsening of AD, the underlying

related to baricitinib but rather to failure of treatment (Table 48).

a  Data from the 16-week placebo-controlled period are ‘as-randomised’ and from the updated data analysis set. 
AESI’s were selected based on the established safety profile of baricitinib based on data in RA, on the 
‘phase 2’ dose-finding study in AD, the mechanism of action of baricitinib and information from the 
literature.

malignancy in the long-term use data set: anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and 4 NMSC cases: 2 cases 
of Bowen’s disease, basal cell carcinoma, and keratoacanthoma. Few cases of hypersensitivity 
(including severe angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic skin eruption) occurred. There were 7 cases 
of photosensitivity reported while on baricitinib.

Infections 
Through inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway, baricitinib is supposed to increase the risk for infections. 
The occurrence of infections was raised in both baricitinib dose groups as compared to placebo (Table 
50) and over time was slightly larger in the higher dose group. Serious infections were few. Part of the 
increased occurrence of infections can be attributed to herpes simplex and oral herpes. 
Herpes zoster and herpes simplex (including eczema herpeticum, herpes simplex, ophthalmic herpes 
simplex, and oral herpes) are recognized as common ADRs in the EU SmPC. Upper respiratory tract 
infections are recognized as very common ADRs in the EU SmPC. Other infections listed in the EU 
SmPC include gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia (all common). Serious and 
Opportunistic infections are important potential risks in the RMP. The current SmPC for RA includes 
warnings: to be cautious in patients with clinically important chronic or active infections; not to use 
baricitinib in case of active TB; that viral reactivation (including herpes zoster and hepatitis B and C) is 
possible; perform screening for viral hepatitis. Since infections are the key identified risks for 
baricitinib, the posology section of the SmPC indicates that a lower dose (2-mg) may be appropriate 
for patients with a history of chronic or recurrent infections. No changes for the SmPC regarding 
infections are proposed with the present application. 
In the updated database, the highest IRs were seen in the baricitinib doses compared to PBO in the PC 
period, and there were no dose differences in the PC and extended periods. There were no clinically 
relevant differences between monotherapy and TCS as the IR was higher in the baricitinib 2-mg 
monotherapy group than TCS in the extended period, but IRs were similar in the baricitinib 4-mg 
extended and All BARI AD groups.  
All opportunistic infections were reported in TCS-treated patients. There was 1 toxoplasmosis in the 
eye reported in a patient receiving PBO. There were 3 multi-dermatomal herpes zoster events reported 
in baricitinib-treated patients, 2 on baricitinib 2 mg and 1 on baricitinib 4 mg. None of these were 
reported as serious infections or led to study drug interruption. Herpes simplex was reported more 
frequently in the baricitinib 4-mg dose for both monotherapy and TCS in the PC period.

Overview of infections 
Hematologic changes 
The hematologic growth promoters are erythropoietin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and thrombopoietin signal via 
JAK2 signaling. JAK2 inhibition could impair the production of erythrocytes, leukocytes, or platelets. 
Myelosuppression has been reported to varying degrees with other marketed JAK inhibitors, ruxolitinib 
and tofacitinib. 
There were dose-dependent changes for baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg, as compared to placebo, in 
neutrophils-low, haemoglobin-low, platelets-high. Changes only for the highest dose were in 
neutrophils-high, lymphocytes-low. Specifically, thrombocytosis (with a change to >400 x 109 cells/L) 
occurred in 3.5% of the patients of the placebo group, 9.3% in the baricitinib 2 mg group and 12.8% 
in the 4 mg group. In the extended data set, proportions of patients with hematologic changes 
increased, most notably for: neutrophils-high, neutrophils-low, lymphocytes-low, platelets-high (Table 
51).  
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 123/158 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 51 
Overview of haematological changes in the extended data set 
Low neutrophils and thrombocytosis are listed as ADR in the SmPC. It is included in the warnings that 
treatment should not be initiated or it should temporarily be interrupted, in presence of absolute 
neutrophil counts < 1 x 109 cells/L, absolute lymphocyte counts < 0.5 x 109 cells/L, a haemoglobin 
level < 4.9 mmol/L-FE. No changes regarding haematological changes are proposed for the SmPC with 
the present application. 
Blood lipid increases 
Lipid changes such as increased LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides are consistent with a pharmacologic 
effect of JAK inhibition, with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia recognized as ADRs for 
baricitinib. Lipid changes are also observed with tofacitinib. 
Mean total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL were elevated for baricitinib-treated patients in the placebo-
controlled period and continued to be elevated during the extended period (Figure below). At week 16 
of the placebo-controlled period, increased total cholesterol was present in 9.6% of the placebo group, 
and 21.0% and 20.8% in the baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg groups. Triglycerides did not show a mean 
change from baseline, although some patients did have clinically significant changes. A higher 
proportion of patients treated with baricitinib 4-mg compared to 2-mg had categorical increases in 
cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides. The ratio of LDL/HDL cholesterol increased up to week 52, 
more for baricitinib 4 mg as for 2 mg. Results for total cholesterol are shown below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 124/158 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 25 
Mean change in cholesterol up to week 52 and beyond. 
At the end of the 16-week placebo-controlled period, in the placebo group 9.6% were considered to 
have a high cholesterol level (maximum NCEP grade) compared to 21% in the baricitinib 2 mg and 
21% in the 4 mg group. In the extended data set, 27% in the 2 mg group and 31% in the 4 mg group 
had a borderline high or high cholesterol (NCEP grade).  
Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia are listed as very common and uncommon ADRs in the 
SmPC. It is included in the warnings that lipid parameters should be assessed approximately 12 weeks 
following initiation of baricitinib and then followed according to clinical guidelines for hyperlipidemia. 
The MAH considers the monitoring of lipids sufficient for the AD population. 
In the updated database, among the patients with normal LDL cholesterol at baseline and available 
LDL measurements at Week 12, there were only 6 patients (0.6%) with high LDL cholesterol after 
Week 12. Furthermore, there were only 2 patients for whom additional lipid monitoring after Week 12 
revealed high LDL cholesterol in patients without a history of hyperlipidaemia and with normal values 
at baseline and at Week 12. One of these patients could be considered at risk, as he was reported to 
be obese at baseline. The remaining 4 patients would have been subject to routine monitoring in 
accordance with prevailing guidelines and standard practice. 
Venous Thrombolic Events 
Venous thromboembolism, including PE and DVT, are listed as ADRs in the SmPC, and VTE is an 
important potential risk for baricitinib based on data from the RA population. 
There was 1 case of PE in the baricitinib 4 mg group in the placebo-controlled period. In the extended 
data set another case of PE occurred in a patient treated with baricitinib 2 mg, and a case of peripheral 
venous thrombosis in another patient treated with 2 mg. None of these 3 patients with a VTE had a 
platelet count of 400 x 109 cells/L or greater at any time before the event. The patient with the 
peripheral venous thrombosis also had a Factor V-Leiden mutation. 
The SmPC includes a warning for the occurrence of VTE: ‘Events of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and 
pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving baricitinib. Olumiant should be 
used with caution in patients with risk factors for DVT/PE, such as older age, obesity, a medical history 
of DVT/PE, or patients undergoing surgery and immobilisation. If clinical features of DVT/PE occur, 
Olumiant treatment should be discontinued and patients should be evaluated promptly, followed by 
appropriate treatment.’ 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 125/158 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH proposed to add information on the signs and symptoms of a possible PE and DVT in the 
Patient Alert Card and the Healthcare Professional training materials. A postauthorization study is 
proposed to further assess the long-term safety profile in AD, including the risk of VTE. 
Creatine phosphokinase changes 
Increases in CPK were observed in the baricitinib RA clinical studies and have been described in 
association with other JAK inhibitors.  
In both baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg groups, elevations of mean CPK were observed at 4 to 8 weeks and 
remained stable at a higher value than baseline thereafter, including in the extended period. Dose-
related increases in mean changes were seen throughout the placebo-controlled period and extended 
period. 
Table 52 
Shifts to maximum CTCAE grades for CPK in the placebo-controlled period 
In the extended data set, there were more patients on 4 mg than on 2 mg with a shift, an increase 
grade ≥3 was seen in 3.1% on baricitinib 2 mg and 4.8% on 4 mg. In the extended data set, no 
patients reported AEs related to muscle symptoms in the 2 mg baricitinib group. In the 4 mg group 
there were 3 patients with myalgia, 2 of them had raised CPK. 
Abnormal hepatic tests 
While baricitinib elimination occurs primarily by renal clearance, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib (other JAK 
inhibitors) are mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism. Increases in ALT and AST values have been 
noted with the JAK inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib. 
Treatment with baricitinib was associated with dose-dependent increases in ALT and AST. Most cases 
of hepatic transaminase elevations were asymptomatic and transient. In the placebo-controlled period, 
ALT and AST did not appear to occur more often with baricitinib as with placebo. The proportion of 
patients with ALT increased > 3 xULN were 0.9% in the placebo group, and 0.5% and 0.3% in the 
baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg groups. In the extended period, ALT≥3 x ULN and AST ≥3 x ULN occurred in 
~1% of patients on 2 mg and ~2% of patients on 4 mg. There was one occurrence of hepatic failure in 
a patient with multiple risk factors, and 5 cases where treatment was stopped due to hepatic-related 
AEs.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the extended period, relatively more patients in the baricitinib 4 mg group (n=21; 5.0%) than in the 
2 mg group (n=9; 2.4%) permanently discontinued study drug due to adverse events.  
The most frequently reported event leading to study discontinuation was dermatitis atopic (n=14). In 
general, the IR for AD was similar between monotherapy and TCS groups. 
Temporary drug discontinuations occurred more often in the baricitinib 4 mg group (Table 53) and 
were usually due to adverse events (infections) and infrequently due to abnormal laboratory values.

Post marketing experience 
The first marketing authorization for baricitinib occurred on 13 February 2017, for the treatment of 
moderate-to-severe active RA in adults. Baricitinib is currently approved for the treatment of RA in 
over 60 countries including in the EU, US, and Japan. The use of baricitinib in AD has not been 
approved, and therefore, no postmarketing data are available for patients with AD. 
Since the first marketing approval for baricitinib, based on findings from postmarketing spontaneous 
reports, and mechanistic plausibility, 6 MedDRA PTs were added in the section 4.8 of the SmPC: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
pneumonia 
swelling face 
urticaria 
rash 
deep vein thrombosis

In addition, section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to include hypersensitivity. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the updated safety database, all patients from the 5 studies are included as currently Study JAIY is 
also included. A total of 2531 patients with AD were exposed to baricitinib at any dose (1 mg, 2 mg, 4 
mg) across the entire AD baricitinib development programme (safety population). Overall exposure 
was 2247.4 patient-years. A total of 1106 patients had an exposure off ≥52 weeks (i.e. 43%), which is 
considered enough to the CHMP. Subgroup analysis by concomitant TCS (yes/no) was provided by the 
MAH to inform assessment of benefit/risk. Also, data were presented in which patients were followed 
after dose change, thus patients could provide observation time to multiple doses, all observation time 
on dose was accounted for. 
Baseline characteristics were as expected and similar for the treatment groups. Average age and 
average disease duration are in line with the natural course of AD. The treatment history is in line with 
the intended indication. 
In the 16-week placebo-controlled treatment period of pooled studies JAHG, JAHL, JAHM and JAIY, the 
occurrences of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar in the baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg 
groups which were higher as compared to the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild or 
moderate, the occurrence of severe adverse events was similar in the placebo group as compared to 
baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg groups. Serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the placebo 
group as compared to the baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg groups. Discontinuation from the study or the 
study drug due to adverse events did not occur often, but most frequently in the baricitinib 4 mg 
group. 
In the extended treatment period, notably serious adverse events and permanent discontinuations, 
occurred more frequently in the baricitinib 4 mg group as compared to the 2 mg group. One death 
occurred in a patient who was treated with a 2 mg dose. See description below. 
The most frequently reported event leading to study discontinuation was dermatitis atopic (n=14). The 
IR for AD was similar between monotherapy and TCS groups in the All BARI AD group. 
Discontinuations was higher in the 4 mg group but mostly attributed as a flare of AD. 
Common adverse events 
In the 16-week placebo controlled treatment period, common adverse events that occurred more 
frequently in baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg treated patients, as compared to placebo, were: headache, 
upper respiratory tract infection, oral herpes, herpes simplex, influenza, blood CPK increased, 
folliculitis, upper abdominal pain. Common adverse events that appeared to occur more frequently for 
baricitinib 4 mg only, versus placebo, were: diarrhoea, urinary tract infection, ALT increased, and AST 
increased.  
In the extended treatment period, common treatment-emergent adverse events overall occurred more 
frequently in the baricitinib 4 mg group as compared to the 2 mg group. This includes the occurrence 
of infections (nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, oral herpes, herpes simplex, 
bronchitis) and the occurrence of abnormalities in laboratory values (blood CPK increased). 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
One death occurred, in a patient originally randomised to baricitinib 1 mg, who was re-randomised to 4 
mg in study JAHN but received 2 mg because of a GFR<60ml/min/1.73m2. The cause of death was a 
GI bleed, more than 12 months after start of baricitinib and while being on 2 mg for 9 months. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 129/158 
 
 
 
patient had no known risk factors for GI bleed, but had a low haematocrit and a low erythrocyte count 
at baseline, which may point to a possible earlier bleed. 
In the 16-week placebo-controlled treatment period, the proportion of patients with at least one SAE 
was higher in the placebo group as compared to the baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg groups. Most SAEs 
occurred in the SOCs of skin and subcutaneous disorders, and infections and infestations. The 
corresponding SAEs in the placebo group were: atopic dermatitis (n=5), exfoliative dermatitis (n=1), 
eczema herpeticum (n=2), eye infection (n=1), post-operative abcess (n=1). In the baricitinib 2 mg 
group these were: atopic dermatitis (n=2), eczema (n=1), and single occurrences of bronchitis, 
cellulitis, staphylococcal infection. In the baricitinib 4 mg group these were: atopic dermatitis (n=1), 
tonsilitis (n=1). In the higher number of SAE in the 4 mg in the extended phase were mostly of SAEs 
were AD, suggestive treatment failure rather than to baricitinib.   
In the extended treatment period, there were 17 (IR 2.2) patients with at least one SAE in the 
baricitinib 2 mg group and 40 (IR 7.3) in the baricitinib 4 mg group. In the baricitinib 4 mg group there 
were cases of: atopic dermatitis (n=9), eczema herpeticum (n=3), pulmonary embolism (n=2), 
thrombophlebitis (n=2), infections (n=13), and further single occurrences. 
There were no obvious differences between the two doses. Over time, the occurrence of adverse 
events of all kinds appears to be slightly higher with the 4 mg dose as compared to the 2 mg dose. 
The CHMP considered that these events are addressed in the SmPC and RMP and can be well managed 
in the clinic. In addition, the SmPC allows for down titration to 2mg dose if a desirable target level of 
AD is reached. Discontinuations due to AE were more frequent with 4 mg but mostly attributed as a 
flare of AD. 
There were no clear clinically relevant differences in the safety profile of baricitinib either taken as 
monotherapy or used in combination with TCS, despite differences in SAEs and discontinuations. 
However, these differences are small and not consistent for the doses. Altogether, it can be concluded 
that the available data provide reassurance that baricitinib can be used in combination with TCS. The 
data presented as subgroup analysis by concomitant TCS (yes/no), does not give rise to new safety 
issues. 
Discontinuations 
The most frequently reported event leading to study discontinuation was dermatitis atopic (n=14). The 
IR for AD was similar between monotherapy and TCS groups in the All BARI AD group. 
Discontinuations was higher in the 4 mg group but mostly attributed as a flare of AD. 
AE of special interest 
Infections and infestations did occur more frequently in baricitinib treated patients compared to patients 
on placebo. There were no dose differences in the placebo-controlled phase and in the extended periods. 
There were no clinically relevant differences between monotherapy and TCS.  
Based  on  the  initial  submission  data  and  data  updated  to  better  attribute  events  to  dose,  serious 
infections infrequently occurred in the placebo-controlled period, 4 in the placebo group, 2 in the 2 mg 
and 1 in the 4 mg group. Herpes zoster did not appear to occur more frequently in baricitinib treated 
patients. 
Since infections are the key identified risks for baricitinib, the posology section of the SmPC indicates 
that a lower dose (2-mg) may be appropriate for patients with a history of chronic or recurrent infections. 
No  changes  for  the  SmPC  regarding  infections  are  proposed  with  the  current  application  which  was 
endorsed by the CHMP.

The risk for VTE remains a concern for JAK inhibitors such as baricitinib. PE/DVT is listed as ADR and 
the SmPC includes precautions (section 4.4). The MAH proposed to add information on the signs and 
symptoms of a possible PE and DVT in the Patient Alert Card and the Healthcare Professional training 
materials; this proposal was endorsed by the PRAC / CHMP. A post authorisation study was proposed 
to further assess the long-term safety profile in AD, including the risk of VTE which was endorsed by 
the PRAC / CHMP. Cf RMP Section 2.6. 
The adverse events of special interest generally occurred in similar patterns as is known from RA. In 
AD, no MACE or cardiac events occurred but the AD population is relatively young and the study 
population was on average 35 years. The effect of a prolonged high level of lipids due to baricitinib in 
AD is uncertain. According to the current SmPC, lipid parameters should be monitored 12 weeks after 
initiation of treatment and thereafter according to international clinical guidelines for hyperlipidaemia. 
In the updated database, there were only 6 new patients (0.6%) with high LDL cholesterol after Week 
12. Only two out of these 6 patients did not have a history of hyperlipidaemia. The current warning in 
the SmPC is considered adequate by the CHMP.  
Blood  lipid  changes  were  present  in  baricitinib  treated  patients  as  compared  to  placebo.  Mean  total 
cholesterol, LDL and HDL were elevated in baricitinib treated patients in the placebo-controlled period, 
which remained in the extended treatment period in both dose groups. Increase in cholesterol occurred 
earlier in the 4 mg group. After 16 weeks of treatment, 21% of baricitinib 2 mg and also 21% of patients 
on  2  mg  had  an  increase  to  borderline  or  high  cholesterol,  as  compared  to  10%  in  placebo  treated 
patients. 
Lipid AEs as well as MACE will be closely followed in the post authorisation setting. 
The data in the AD clinical program indicate that CPK increases greater than 5 times the ULN is a 
common ADR. Therefore, the MAH proposed that the frequency for this ADR in the EU SmPC is 
changed from uncommon to common. This proposal was endorsed by the CHMP. In AD patients, a 
dose relationship was seen following extended exposure; however, the majority of cases were 
transitory, did not result in treatment discontinuation, and were largely asymptomatic, with no reports 
of rhabdomyolysis. A post-authorization study has been proposed by the MAH to further assess the 
long-term safety profile in AD, including the risk of rhabdomyolysis. This is endorsed by PRAC/CHMP. 
Cf RMP Section 2.6. 
Elevations of 3 or more times the ULN for ALT and AST are respectively considered common and 
uncommon ADRs in the established safety profile and are included in the SmPC. Monitoring of hepatic 
transaminases is recommended before initiation of treatment and thereafter. No changes were 
proposed to the SmPC. The MAH proposed to follow the risk for drug-induced liver injury in a post-
marketing study which was endorsed by the PRAC / CHMP. 
Malignancies occurred in 2 cases in the placebo group during the placebo-controlled phase. In the all-
exposed population, 4 cases of malignancies occurred (2 cases of Bowen’s disease, basal cell 
carcinoma, keratoacanthoma). 
The safety data from the AD and RA studies have been integrated to provide the frequencies of 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for inclusion in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. In addition, the MAH 
committed to further shorten section 4.8 (both the AD and RA indications) of the SmPC. Considering 
the consistent safety profile for the RA and AD indications, the MAH should make an integrated 
proposal for both AD and RA indications for the purpose of readability and ease of use of Section 4.8 of 
the SmPC and Section 4 of the PL. The MAH should submit the revised product information at the 
earliest regulatory opportunity.

Headache was added to the SOC “Nervous system disorders” with a frequency “commun”. Abdominal 
pain was added to the SOC “Gastrointestinal disorders” with a frequency “commun”. The frequency of 
the ADR “Acne” and “Creatine phosphokinase increased > 5 x ULN” were changed from uncommon to 
common. Those changes were endorsed by the CHMP. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In placebo-controlled atopic dermatitis clinical trials, for up to 16 weeks, the most commonly reported 
ADRs occurring in ≥ 2 % of patients treated with Olumiant monotherapy or in combination with topical 
corticosteroids were similar to those observed in rheumatoid arthritis, except for increased LDL 
cholesterol (13.2 % versus 33.6 % in RA) and herpes simplex (6.1 %). In patients treated with 
baricitinib in the atopic dermatitis clinical trials, the frequency of herpes zoster was very rare (1.4% in 
RA). 
The pattern of AEs in AD is in line with what can be expected with baricitinib treatment based on the 
RA experience. SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs were infrequent. The dataset did not reveal new 
safety signals in comparison to previous assessment and already known safety profile from the 
patients with RA treated with baricitinib. There were more discontinuations with 4mg but mostly 
attributed as a flare of AD. 
There were no clear clinically relevant differences in the safety profile of baricitinib either taken as 
monotherapy or used in combination with TCS, despite differences in SAEs and discontinuations. 
However, these differences are small and not consistent for the doses. 
There were no obvious differences between the two doses. Over time, the occurrence of adverse 
events of all kinds appears to be slightly higher with the 4 mg dose as compared to the 2 mg dose. 
The CHMP considered that these events are addressed in the SmPC and RMP and can be well managed 
in the clinic. In addition, the SmPC allows for down titration to 2mg dose if a desirable target level of 
AD is reached.  
In conclusion, the CHMP considers that the safety of baricitinib in the claimed indication is supported 
by the data submitted.

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The guide for HCPs and the patient alert card in the Annex II were updated to reflect the risk of deep 
venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s). 
Minor editorial changes were brought to the Labelling. Furthermore, the Annex II is brought in line with 
the latest QRD template version 10.1.

Page 146/158 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The new indication targets a similar patient demographic as the representative test population that 
was used for the user testing performed for the initial marketing authorisation application. The 
proposed text modifications resulting from the new indication are minor and do not include text that is 
significantly different from that already user tested.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
This variation application concerns baricitinib for a proposed new indication in AD: 
“Olumiant is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who 
are candidates for systemic therapy.” 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a chronic relapsing, pruritic, inflammatory skin disease that occurs most 
frequently in children but also occurs in adults. While in children most cases of AD spontaneously 
resolve, AD can persist or start in adulthood (Thomsen 2014). It is estimated that in Europe, 2% to 
7% of adults have AD and the proportion of adults with moderate to severe AD is estimated at 30%, 
with 1 in 4 adults with AD reporting adult-onset of the disease (Sacotte and Silverberg 2018; Diepgen 
et al. 2016; Bieber and Straeter 2015). The pathomechanism of AD includes skin barrier defects, 
immune dysregulation, and genetic predisposition (Boguniewicz and Leung 2011). The main 
manifestations of AD are eczematous skin lesions, itch, skin pain, sleep disturbances, it is associated 
with other atopic conditions such as asthma and allergic rhinitis (Silverberg 2018). Itch is the central 
and debilitating manifestation. AD may lead to difficult to control scratching and superimposed skin 
inflammation and infections, sleep disturbances, functional impairment and mental distress, feelings of 
anxiety and depression (Jeon et al. 2017, Yu et al. 2016, Thyssen et al. 2019, Boguniewicz et al. 2017, 
Thyssen et al. 2018, Ronnstad et al. 2018). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The aim of medical treatment of AD is symptomatic, to bring signs and symptoms of AD under control 
(Wollenberg et al. 2018). Patients with mild disease are generally managed with emollients and mild- 
to moderate-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS). Topical calcineurin inhibitors are considered as an 
alternative or adjunct treatment to TCS, especially when treatment with TCS is either inadvisable or 
not possible and when steroid-sparing treatment is needed in sensitive areas, such as face and skin 
folds. However, patients with moderate to severe AD require additional therapies to control their skin 
inflammation and alleviate the most bothersome symptoms. These additional therapies include 
phototherapy, high-potency TCS, and, eventually when topical options fail to control the disease, 
systemic treatments. 
Currently, 2 systemic therapies are approved for patients with moderate to severe AD: ciclosporin (oral 
systemic agent approved only for severe patients), and dupilumab (SC injection). Ciclosporin is only 
approved for patients with severe AD and due to its safety profile, it is recommended for intermittent 
use (Ciclosporin SmPC). Dupilumab is approved for patients with moderate and severe AD; the most 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 147/158 
 
 
 
common side effects, when used in treatment of AD, are injection-site reactions (≥10%), conjunctivitis 
and blepharitis (Dupixent EPAR). 
Staquis (an ointment with a PDE-4 inhibitor) was recently approved for treatment of mild to moderate 
atopic dermatitis in adults and paediatric patients from 2 years of age with ≤ 40% body surface area 
(BSA) affected. 
Other therapies are not centrally authorised but are approved in individual member states and 
recommended by AD treatment guidelines (Wollenberg et al. 2018): 
• 
• 
Oral glucocorticosteroids is intended for severe AD (Wollenberg et al. 2018). 
PUVA is intended for severe AD (Wollenberg et al. 2018). 
Non pharmacological approaches are recommended in moderate to severe AD according to AD 
treatment guidelines (Wollenberg et al. 2018). 
In addition to approved therapies, current AD guidelines and expert advice recommend off-label use of 
other oral therapies, such as systemic corticosteroids, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate 
mofetil (Wollenberg et al. 2018b). 
For patients with moderate to severe AD for whom treatment with TCS and or TCIs and/or systemic 
therapies is insufficient, treatment options are limited and therefore there is a need for new treatment 
options. An advantage for patients with moderate to severe AD may be that baricitinib is taken orally 
once daily. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Baricitinib doses for the main clinical studies were primarily chosen based on the results of ‘phase 2’ 
study JAHG. The main clinical studies were randomised double-blinded controlled trials performed in 
adult patients with moderate to severe AD for whom previous topical treatment and/or systemic 
treatment was insufficient or not tolerated (Table 2). These studies were: two identical 16-week 
monotherapy studies comparing baricitininb 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg versus placebo (JAHL and JAHM); one 
16-week ‘add-on’ combination therapy study comparing baricitinib 2mg +TCS and 4 mg +TCS versus 
placebo +TCS (JAIY); an ongoing 104-week extension study (JAHN) including dose continuation of 2 
mg and 4 mg in responders and partial responders for in total 52 weeks, to be followed by a 
randomised down-titration/stop sub-study.  
Study JAHN is ongoing, all patients coming from studies JAHL and JAHM reached week 52, but patients 
coming from study JAIY have not yet reached 52-weeks of follow-up, about 50% of them reached week 
24.  
Study JAIN is a supportive ongoing Phase 3 study investigating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in 
patients who experienced failure with ciclosporin or are intolerant to or have a contraindication to 
ciclosporin. Final results of the 16-week placebo-controlled phase are available. Similar to Study JAIY, 
patients in Study JAIN are permitted to use low- and moderate-potency TCS as concomitant therapy 
throughout the study.   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In all three studies (JAHL, JAHM, JAIY), baricitinib 4 mg was statistically significant more effective than 
placebo in reaching IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 (with a ≥2 points improvement from baseline), while 
adjusting for multiplicity. Baricitinib 2 mg was more effective than placebo in reaching IGA 0 or 1 at 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 148/158 
 
 
 
week 16 in the monotherapy studies, but not in the combination therapy study. The 1 mg dose was 
not more effective than placebo. The results were supported by sensitivity analyses. 
In the monotherapy studies JAHL and JAHM, responses in primary and secondary outcomes were 
numerically higher when it was allowed for rescue treatment (usually TCS) in the analyses. Responses 
in IGA 0 or 1 were 6% to 8% higher if results were analysed while allowing for rescue treatment. 
Response sizes of secondary outcomes (EASI75, improvement ≥4 points in the Itch NRS, change in 
ADSS item 2, SCORAD75, Skin pain NRS) were generally similar in the identical monotherapy studies 
JAHL and JAHM and usually numerically higher in the combination study JAIY. The statistical tests 
corrected for multiplicity in the main secondary outcomes were supportive for the baricitinib 4 mg dose 
in all three studies, the support for the 2 mg dose is less robust and it was not supported by the 
primary and secondary outcomes in the combination therapy study. 
Treatment effects in subgroups (weight, age, gender, race, disease severity, and previous treatment, 
including immunosuppressants) were consistent with the results in the overall study population. 
The effect after 16 weeks appears to be largely maintained over 52 weeks, similar in the patients 
continuing 2 mg and 4 mg, whether on monotherapy or on combination therapy.  
Maintenance results on IGA 0 or 1 and the tendency for similar or larger responses in the 2 mg as 
compared to the 4 mg group are also reflected in EASI75 and in Itch-response. 
Previous failure of ciclosporin did not seem to have a negative influence on the treatment effect, at 
least for the 4 mg dose. In case of previous use of TCI, the treatment effect may be somewhat smaller 
if on monotherapy with baricitinib. The number of patients having used dupilumab before was small, 
but there was no indication that treatment with baricitinib would be ineffective if patients had 
previously used dupilumab. The CHMP considered that these results have no further consequences for 
the SmPC yet, as treatment effects appear to be present across all subgroups. Study JAIN was 
specifically performed in patients with ciclosporin failure of for whom ciclosporin is contra-indicated, 
though this study standardly included concomitant TCS with baricitinib or placebo. Its results 
confirmed the efficacy of baricitinib in this subpopulation. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The maintenance data are not complete for the patients coming from study JAIY, about 50% of the 
patients reached week 24. However, the patients from the monotherapy studies have completed 52 
weeks of follow-up. In the patients from monotherapy as well as the patients from the combination 
therapy, it was shown in all main outcomes that effects are basically maintained, similarly for the 2 mg 
and 4 mg doses. The CHMP considered that more data of study JAIY are unlikely to change this 
assessment. 
Though effects were small and TCS was much used as rescue treatment when baricitinib was used as 
monotherapy, the effects of baricitinib as monotherapy are considered of clinical relevance by the 
CHMP and in line with the proposed indication. 
Because maintenance of effects in (partial) responders on 4 mg are well maintained with the 2 mg 
dose, the SmPC includes the opportunity to lower the dose to 2 mg if a desirable target level of AD is 
reached. 
The effect of down-titration or stop is not yet known for baricitinib in the treatment of AD. This is 
studied in period 2 of study JAHN, which is ongoing. It is expected that these results will be used to 
update the information in section 5.1 of the SmPC, when final results are available in 2023.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the updated safety database patients from the 5 studies are included as currently Study JAIY is also 
included. A total of 2531 patients with AD were exposed to baricitinib at any dose (1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg) 
across the entire AD baricitinib development programme (safety population). Overall exposure was 
2247.4 patient-years. A total of 1106 patients had an exposure off ≥52 weeks (i.e. 43%), which is 
sufficient for assessing safety. Subgroup analysis by concomitant TCS (yes/no) is also provided. Data 
were analysed ‘as randomised’ and ‘as treated’ with observation time not being censored after a dose 
change. Thus, patients could contribute exposure time to more than one dose and consequently, all 
AEs occurring with 2 mg or 4 mg could be attributed to dose. The overall results of the ‘as randomised’ 
and the ‘as treated’ extended data sets pointed to the same results, though the overall incidence rate 
of AEs was lower for the 4 mg “as treated” group, versus those who received the 2 mg dose. However, 
the incidence of serious AEs and treatment withdrawal due to AEs was higher for the 4 mg dose. 
Currently, the number of patients and duration of exposure were sufficient by the CHMP to assess long-
term safety. 
In placebo-controlled atopic dermatitis clinical trials, for up to 16 weeks, the most commonly reported 
ADRs occurring in ≥ 2 % of patients treated with Olumiant monotherapy or in combination with topical 
corticosteroids were similar to those observed in rheumatoid arthritis, except for increased LDL 
cholesterol (13.2 % versus 33.6 % in RA) and herpes simplex (6.1 %). In patients treated with 
baricitinib in the atopic dermatitis clinical trials, the frequency of herpes zoster was very rare (1.4% in 
RA). 
There were more discontinuations with 4mg but mostly attributed as a flare of AD. 
The safety data from the AD and RA studies have been integrated to provide the frequencies of 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for inclusion in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Headache was added to the SOC “Nervous system disorders” with a frequency “common”. Abdominal 
pain was added to the SOC “Gastrointestinal disorders” with a frequency “common”. The frequency of 
the ADR “Acne” and “Creatine phosphokinase increased > 5 x ULN” were changed from uncommon to 
common. Those changes were endorsed by the CHMP. 
The safety dataset did not reveal new safety signals in comparison to previous assessment and already 
known safety profile from the patients with RA treated with baricitinib. 
There were no clear clinically relevant differences in the safety profile of baricitinib either taken as 
monotherapy or used in combination with TCS, despite differences in SAEs and discontinuations. 
However, these differences are small and not consistent for the doses.   
The largest differences between baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg versus placebo can be noted in infections 
(URTI, Herpes simplex) headache, blood CPK increased, and upper abdominal pain. Over time, the 
occurrence of serious adverse events like thrombotic events appears to be slightly higher with the 4 
mg dose as compared to the 2 mg dose. The CHMP considered that these events are addressed in the 
SmPC and RMP and can be well managed in the clinic. In addition, the SmPC allows for down titration 
to 2mg dose if a desirable target level of AD is reached. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Infections and infestations did occur more frequently in baricitinib treated patients compared to patients 
on placebo. There were no dose differences in the placebo-controlled phase and in the extended periods. 
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  between  monotherapy  and  TCS.  Serious  infections 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020  
Page 150/158 
 
 
 
infrequently occurred in the placebo-controlled period, 4 in the placebo group, 2 in the 2 mg and 1 in 
the 4 mg group. Herpes zoster did not appear to occur more frequently in baricitinib treated patients. 
Since infections are the key identified risks for baricitinib, the posology section of the SmPC indicates 
that a lower dose (2-mg) may be appropriate for patients with a history of chronic or recurrent infections. 
No  changes  for  the  SmPC  regarding  infections  are  proposed  with  the  current  application  which  was 
endorsed by the CHMP. 
Malignancies occurred in 2 cases in the placebo group during the placebo-controlled phase. In the all-
exposed population, 4 cases of malignancies occurred (2 cases of Bowen’s disease, basal cell carcinoma, 
keratoacanthoma).  
Venous thrombolic events occurred in three patients treated with baricitinib. There was one case of PE 
during the placebo-controlled period, in a patient treated with baricitinib 4 mg. In the extended period, 
an additional case of PE occurred in the 4 mg group and a case of DVT in the 2 mg group. A warning 
that baricitinib should be used with caution in patients at risk for VTE is already included in the SmPC. 
The MAH proposed to add information on the signs and symptoms of a possible PE and DVT in the Patient 
Alert Card and the Healthcare Professional training materials; this proposal was endorsed by the PRAC / 
CHMP.  A  post  authorisation  study  was  proposed  to  further  assess  the  long-term  safety  profile  in  AD, 
including the risk of VTE which was endorsed by the PRAC / CHMP. Cf RMP Section 2.6. 
MACE did not occur in the placebo-controlled period nor in the extended treatment period. There were 
few cases with hypertension as adverse events, not clearly different in occurrence for placebo and 
baricitinib treated groups. The effect of a prolonged high level of lipids due to baricitinib in AD is 
uncertain. According to the current SmPC, lipid parameters should be monitored 12 weeks after 
initiation of treatment and thereafter according to international clinical guidelines for hyperlipidaemia. 
In the updated database, there were only 6 new patients (0.6%) with high LDL cholesterol after Week 
12. Only two out of these 6 patients did not have a history of hyperlipidaemia. The current warning in 
the SmPC is considered adequate by the CHMP.  
Blood  lipid  changes  were  present  in  baricitinib  treated  patients  as  compared  to  placebo.  Mean  total 
cholesterol, LDL and HDL were elevated in baricitinib treated patients in the placebo-controlled period, 
which remained in the extended treatment period in both dose groups. Increase in cholesterol occurred 
earlier in the 4 mg group. After 16 weeks of treatment, 21% of baricitinib 2 mg and also 21% of patients 
on  2  mg  had  an  increase  to  borderline  or  high  cholesterol,  as  compared  to  10%  in  placebo  treated 
patients. 
Lipid AEs as well as MACE will be closely followed in the post authorisation setting. 
Increases in ALT and AST values (>3 times ULN) occurred in 3 and 4 cases  on 4 mg in the placebo-
controlled period, and did not occur in placebo or 2 mg groups. In the extended treatment period, there 
were few cases of ALT increased in the 2 mg group, and 9 cases of ALT increased and 8 cases of AST 
increased in the 4 mg group. Elevations of 3 or more times the ULN for ALT and AST are respectively 
considered common and uncommon ADRs in the established safety profile and are included in the SmPC. 
Monitoring of hepatic transaminases is recommended before initiation of treatment and thereafter. No 
changes were proposed to the SmPC. The MAH proposed to follow the risk for drug-induced liver injury 
in a post-marketing study which was endorsed by the PRAC / CHMP. 
The data in the AD clinical program indicate that CPK increases greater than 5 times the ULN is a 
common ADR. Therefore, the MAH proposed that the frequency for this ADR in the EU SmPC is 
changed from uncommon to common. This proposal was endorsed by the CHMP. In AD patients, a 
dose relationship was seen following extended exposure; however, the majority of cases were 
transitory, did not result in treatment discontinuation, and were largely asymptomatic, with no reports

of rhabdomyolysis. A post-authorization study has been proposed by the MAH to further assess the 
long-term safety profile in AD, including the risk of rhabdomyolysis. Cf RMP Section 2.6. 
There  were  no  clear  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the  safety  profile  of  baricitinib  either  taken  as 
monotherapy  or  used  in  combination  with  TCS,  despite  differences  in  SAEs  and  discontinuations. 
However, these differences are small and not consistent for the doses.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The in/exclusion criteria and disease characteristics of the included patients are in alignement with a 
population with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic treatment, 
which is in line with the indication that is aimed for. 
Baricitinib 4 mg is the most effective dose to induce a response in patients with moderate to severe 
AD, with or without concomitant TCS. In both monotherapy studies and in the combination therapy 
study, baricitinib 4 mg was statistically significantly more effective than placebo regarding IGA 0 or 1 
at week 16 (primary outcome). Baricitinib 2 mg was statistically significantly more effective than 
placebo in reaching IGA 0 or 1 in the monotherapy studies, but not in the combination therapy study. 
Baricitinib 1 mg was not more effective than placebo. The onset of effect in IGA 0 or 1 appears 
between 2 – 4 weeks, for baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg and with or without concomitant TCS, which is 
considered quite early.  
In all three studies, the results for IGA 0 or 1 are supported by all other main secondary outcomes 
including EASI75, Itch, and also sleep disturbance (ADSS), patient assessed skin manifestations 
(SCORAD, POEM), Skin pain, health related quality of life (DLQI), anxiety and depression (HADS). It is 
therefore considered that the treatment effects found for baricitinib are robust over primary and main 
secondary outcomes, that the treatment effects are largest for the baricitinib 4 mg dose and if used 
with TCS, that clinical relevance of the treatment effect is supported by the effects on itch, sleep 
disturbance, skin pain, health-related quality of life and anxiety and depression. 
Results of maintenance of effects are complete for the patients who became (partial) responders on 
monotherapy and are supported by the results of the patients who became (partial) responders on 
combination therapy. Because similar maintenance of effect is shown of 4 mg and 2 mg, this means 
that there is an opportunity to lower the dose to 2 mg if a desirable target level of AD is reached, 
which is included in the SmPC. More information will be available upon completion of the down-
titration/stop sub study in period 2 of study JAHN (ongoing – the CHMP recommends to submit the 
final study results).  
For the baricitinib 4 mg dose, the responses in IGA 0 or 1 were 14% and 17% in the monotherapy 
studies and 31% in the combination therapy study. These responses (and the differences with placebo) 
may be appreciated as relatively low, seen numerically. This treatment effect also falls below the a 
priori expectations as derived from dose-finding study JAHG. Notably, in both combination therapy 
studies, JAHG and JAIY, the treatment effect was higher than in the monotherapy studies. 
Nevertheless, it is considered that the size of the treatment effects in IGA 0 or 1 and the overall trade-
off are of clinical relevance. Patients with IGA 0 or 1 are ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ and the results are 
supported by other outcomes that are considered relevant for patients such as partial response, 
EASI75, Itch-response, skin pain, POEM, DLQI. The treatment effect can be if needed, enhanced if 
baricitinib is used in combination with TCS, which is included in the SmPC. 
Based on the prognostic analysis, substantiated advice is given in the SmPC to stop treatment if 
insufficient response is achieved at week 8 (instead of week 12).  This prevents unnecessary exposure 
to baricitinib. Single predictors or combinations thereof, analysed at weeks 2, 4 and 8, were assessed 
for their negative predictive value in EASI75 and Itch NRS ≥ 4 and IGA 0,1 response at week 16. These 
analyses consistently demonstrated that the highest sensitivity and negative predictive value were 
obtained at week 8 of treatment.

The safety dataset did not reveal new safety signals in comparison to previous assessment and already 
known safety profile from the patients with RA treated with baricitinib. 
There were no clear clinically relevant differences in the safety profile of baricitinib either taken as 
monotherapy or used in combination with TCS, despite differences in SAEs and discontinuations. 
However, these differences are small and not consistent for the doses. 
Currently, the number of patients and duration of exposure were sufficient to assess long-term safety, 
also in the follow-up data set events could now attributed to dose. The overall results of the ‘as 
randomised’ and the ‘as treated’ extended data sets basically pointed to the same results. The safety 
results of the 16-week placebo-controlled phase (see Effects Table 54) were unaffected. 
The largest differences between baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg versus placebo can be noted in infections 
(URTI, Herpes simplex) headache, blood CPK increased, and upper abdominal pain. Over time, the 
occurrence of serious adverse events like thrombotic events appears to be slightly higher with the 4 
mg dose as compared to the 2 mg dose. The CHMP considered that these events are addressed in the 
SmPC and RMP and can be well managed in the clinic. In addition, the SmPC allows for down titration 
to 2mg dose if a desirable target level of AD is reached. 
Up to now, the nature of adverse events as occurred in the atopic dermatitis studies is generally in line 
with what is already known, from the treatment with baricitinib in RA. Patients with atopic dermatitis 
are younger and used considerable less systemic immunosuppressant comedication, as compared to 
RA patients,  which may give rise to a lower occurrence e.g. for infections and herpes zoster. AD tends 
to be self-limiting if patients age, and life-long treatment may not be necessary which may be 
protective against adverse events that develop over extended exposure and at higher age.  
Three (3) occurrences of VTE appeared in this relatively young population. A warning that baricitinib 
should be used with caution in patients at risk for VTE is already included in the SmPC. The MAH 
proposed to add information on the signs and symptoms of a possible PE and DVT in the Patient Alert 
Card and the Healthcare Professional training materials; this proposal was endorsed by the PRAC / 
CHMP. A post authorisation study was proposed to further assess the long-term safety profile in AD, 
including the risk of VTE which was endorsed by the PRAC / CHMP. Cf RMP Section 2.6. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit/risk balance of Olumiant (baricitinib) for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to 
severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy is positive. 
It is considered that baricitinib 4 mg is the most effective dose, and that the effects can be enhanced 
by concomitant use of TCS. Though the treatment effects of baricitinib 4 mg as monotherapy can be 
valued as numerically small, they still are considered of being clinically relevant by the CHMP. In 
clinical practice, concomitant use of TCS can be expected and is reflected in the SmPC. There is an 
opportunity to lower the dose to 2 mg if a desirable target level of AD is reached, which is also 
reflected in the SmPC.  More information will be available upon completion of the down-titration/stop 
substudy in period 2 of study JAHN (ongoing). Based on the prognostic analysis, substantiated advice 
is given in the SmPC to stop treatment if no response is reached at week 8.   
The safety data set and attribution of AEs to dose (2 mg and 4 mg) did not reveal new safety signals in 
comparison to previous assessment and already known safety profile from the patients with RA treated 
with baricitinib. 
There were no clear clinically relevant differences in the safety profile of baricitinib either taken as 
monotherapy or used in combination with TCS, despite differences in SAEs and discontinuations. These 
Assessment report  
EMA/520470/2020 
Page 155/158 
 
 
 
  
differences are small and not consistent for the doses.  Altogether, the CHMP concluded that the 
available data provide reassurance that baricitinib can be used in combination with TCS with an 
acceptable additional risk compared to treatment with monotherapy.  
The CHMP was reassured as the pattern of adverse events that occurred in the atopic dermatitis 
studies is generally in line with what is already known, from the treatment with baricitinib in RA. Over 
time, the occurrence of adverse events of all kinds appears to be slightly higher with the 4 mg dose as 
compared to the 2 mg dose. The CHMP considered that these events are addressed in the SmPC and 
RMP and can be well managed in the clinic. In addition, the SmPC allows for down titration to 2mg 
dose if a desirable target level of AD is reached. 
For patients with moderate to severe AD for whom treatment with TCS and or TCIs and/or systemic 
therapies is insufficient, treatment options are limited, and therefore there is a need for new treatment 
options. An advantage for patients with moderate to severe AD may be that Olumiant is taken orally 
once daily. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The benefit/risk balance of Olumiant (baricitinib) for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to 
severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy is positive.

accordance. 
The guide for HCPs and the patient alert card in the Annex II were updated to reflect the risk of deep 
venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). 
Minor editorial changes were brought to the Labelling. Furthermore, the Annex II is brought in line with 
the latest QRD template version 10.1. 
The RMP version 8.1 has also been submitted and adopted. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet.

Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ROS1-positive, 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously treated with ROS1 inhibitors.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Rozlytrek should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
medicinal products. 
Patient selection 
NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours 
A validated assay is required for the selection of patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive solid 
tumours. NTRK gene fusion-positive status must be established prior to initiation of Rozlytrek therapy 
(see section 5.1). 
ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer 
A validated assay is required for the selection of patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC. ROS1-positive 
status must be established prior to initiation of Rozlytrek therapy (see section 5.1). 
Posology 
Adults  
The recommended dose for adults is 600 mg entrectinib once daily. 
Paediatric population  
The recommended dose for paediatric patients 12 years of age and older is 300 mg/m2 body surface 
area (BSA) entrectinib once daily (see Table 1).

Duration of treatment 
It is recommended that patients are treated with Rozlytrek until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. 
Delayed or missed doses 
If a planned dose of Rozlytrek is missed, patients can make up that dose unless the next dose is due 
within 12 hours. If vomiting occurs immediately after taking a dose of Rozlytrek, patients may repeat 
that dose. 
Dose modifications 
Management of adverse reactions may require temporary interruption, dose reduction, or 
discontinuation of treatment with Rozlytrek, in case of specified adverse reactions (see Table 4) or 
based on the prescriber’s assessment of the patient’s safety or tolerability. 
Adults  
For adults, the dose of Rozlytrek may be reduced up to 2 times, based on tolerability (see Table 2). 
Rozlytrek treatment should be permanently discontinued if patients are unable to tolerate a dose of 
200 mg once daily.

Strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors 
The concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors in adults and paediatric patients 12 years 
and older, should be avoided (see section 4.4). 
For adults, if  coadministration is unavoidable, the use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with 
Rozlytrek should be limited to 14 days and the Rozlytrek dose should be reduced as follows: 
• 
• 
100 mg once daily for use with strong CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.5)  
200 mg once daily for use with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 
After discontinuation of the concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors, the Rozlytrek dose that 
was taken prior to initiating the strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor can be resumed. A wash-out period 
may be required for CYP3A4 inhibitors with a long half-life (see section 4.5). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in patients ≥ 65  years of age (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) 
or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Patients with severe hepatic 
impairment should be carefully monitored for hepatic function and adverse reactions (see Table 4). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Entrectinib has not 
been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of entrectinib in children below 12 years of age have not been established. 
Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made.  
Method of administration 
Rozlytrek is for oral use. The hard capsules should be swallowed whole and must not be opened or 
dissolved since the contents of the capsule are very bitter. Rozlytrek can be taken with or without food 
(see section 5.2) but should not be taken with grapefruit or grapefruit juice (see section 4.5).

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Efficacy across tumour types 
The benefit of Rozlytrek has been established in single-arm trials encompassing a relatively small 
sample of patients whose tumours exhibit NTRK gene fusions. Favourable effects of Rozlytrek have 
been shown based on overall response rate and response duration in a limited number of tumour types. 
The effect may be quantitatively different depending on tumour type, as well as on concomitant 
genomic alterations (see section 5.1). For these reasons, Rozlytrek should only be used if there are no 
satisfactory treatment options (i.e., for which clinical benefit has not been established, or where such 
treatment options have been exhausted). 
Cognitive disorders 
Cognitive disorders, including confusion, mental status changes, memory impairment, and 
hallucinations, were reported in clinical trials with Rozlytrek (see section 4.8). Patients over the age of 
65 years experienced a higher incidence of these events than younger patients. Patients should be 
monitored for signs of cognitive changes. 
Based on the severity of cognitive disorders, Rozlytrek treatment should be modified as described in 
Table 4 in section 4.2. 
Patients should be counselled on the potential for cognitive changes with Rozlytrek treatment. Patients 
should be instructed not to drive or use machines until symptoms resolve if they experience cognitive 
disorders (see section 4.7). 
Fractures 
Fractures have been reported in 25.0% (19/76) paediatric patients treated with Rozlytrek in clinical 
trials (see section 4.8). Bone fractures mostly occurred in paediatric patients less than 12  years of age 
and were localised in the lower extremity (with a predilection for femur, tibia, foot and fibula). In both 
adult and paediatric patients, some fractures occurred in the setting of a fall or other trauma to the 
affected area. Thirteen paediatric patients had more than one occurrence of a fracture and 3 paediatric 
patients had Rozlytrek treatment interrupted due to a fracture. The majority of fracture events 
experienced by the paediatric patients resolved. Five paediatric patients discontinued treatment due to 
fractures. 
Patients with signs or symptoms of fractures (e.g., pain, abnormal gait, changes in mobility, deformity) 
should be evaluated promptly. 
Hyperuricemia 
Hyperuricemia has been observed in patients treated with entrectinib. Serum uric acid levels should be 
assessed prior to initiating Rozlytrek and periodically during treatment. Patients should be monitored 
for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia. Treatment with urate-lowering medicinal products should 
be initiated as clinically indicated and Rozlytrek withheld for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia. 
Rozlytrek dose should be modified based on severity as described in Table 4 in section 4.2. 
Congestive heart failure 
Congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported in less than 5% of patients across clinical trials with 
Rozlytrek (see section 4.8). These reactions were observed in patients with or without a history of 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cardiac disease and resolved in 70% of those patients upon institution of appropriate clinical 
management and/or Rozlytrek dose reduction/interruption. 
For patients with symptoms or known risk factors of CHF, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
should be assessed prior to initiation of Rozlytrek treatment. Patients receiving Rozlytrek should be 
carefully monitored and those with clinical signs and symptoms of CHF, including shortness of breath 
or oedema, should be evaluated and treated as clinically appropriate.  
Based on the severity of CHF, Rozlytrek treatment should be modified as described in Table 4 in 
section 4.2. 
QTc interval prolongation 
QTc interval prolongation has been observed in patients treated with Rozlytrek in clinical trials (see 
section 4.8). 
Use of Rozlytrek should be avoided in patients with a baseline QTc interval longer than 450 ms, in 
patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, and in patients taking medicinal products that are known 
to prolong the QTc interval.  
Rozlytrek  should be avoided  in patients with electrolyte imbalances or significant cardiac disease, 
including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, and 
bradyarrhythmias . If in the opinion of the treating physician, the potential benefits of Rozlytrek in a 
patient with any of these conditions outweigh the potential risks, additional monitoring should be 
performed and a specialist consultation should be considered. 
Assessment of ECG and electrolytes at baseline and after 1 month of treatment with Rozlytrek are 
recommended. Periodic monitoring of ECGs and electrolytes as clinically indicated throughout 
Rozlytrek treatment, are also recommended. 
Based on the severity of QTc prolongation, Rozlytrek treatment should be modified as described in 
Table 4 in section 4.2. 
Women of childbearing potential 
Rozlytrek may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing 
potential must use highly effective contraception methods during treatment and up to 5 weeks after the 
last dose of Rozlytrek. 
Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive 
methods during treatment with Rozlytrek and for 3 months after the last dose (see sections 4.6 and 
5.3). 
Drug interactions 
Co-administration of Rozlytrek with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases entrectinib 
plasma concentrations (see section 4.5), which could increase the frequency or severity of adverse 
reactions. In adult and paediatric patients 12  years and older, co-administration of Rozlytrek with a 
strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor should be avoided. For adult patients, if co-administration is 
unavoidable, the Rozlytrek dose should be reduced (see section 4.2). 
During treatment with Rozlytrek, the consumption of grapefruit and grapefruit products should be 
avoided. 
Co-administration of Rozlytrek with a strong or moderate CYP3A or P-gp inducer decreases 
entrectinib plasma concentrations (see section 4.5), which may reduce efficacy of Rozlytrek, and 
should be avoided.

Lactose intolerance 
Rozlytrek contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Sunset yellow FCF (E110) 
Rozlytrek 200 mg hard capsules contain sunset yellow FCF (E110), which may cause allergic 
reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of entrectinib on other medicinal products 
Effect of entrectinib on CYP substrates 
Entrectinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of entrectinib 600 mg once daily with 
oral midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) in patients increased the midazolam AUC by 50% but 
reduced midazolam Cmax by 21%. Caution is advised when entrectinib is administered together with 
sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cisapride, cyclosporin, ergotamine, 
fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, tacrolimus, alfentanil and sirolimus), due to the increased risk of 
adverse drug reactions. 
Effect of entrectinib on P-gp substrates 
In vitro data suggest that entrectinib has inhibitory potential towards P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 
Co-administration of a single 600 mg dose of entrectinib with digoxin (a sensitive P-gp substrate) 
increased digoxin Cmax by 28% and AUC by 18%. The renal clearance of digoxin was similar between 
treatments of digoxin alone and digoxin co-administered with entrectinib, indicating minimal effect of 
entrectinib on renal clearance of digoxin. 
The effect of entrectinib on digoxin absorption is not considered clinically relevant, but it is unknown 
whether the effect of entrectinib may be larger on more sensitive oral P-gp substrates such as 
dabigatran etexilate. 
Effect of entrectinib on BCRP substrates 
Inhibition of BCRP was observed in in vitro studies. 
The clinical relevance of this inhibition is unknown, but caution is advised when sensitive oral BCRP 
substrates (e.g. methotrexate, mitoxantrone, topotecan, lapatinib) are co-administered with entrectinib, 
due to the risk of increased absorption. 
Effect of entrectinib on other transporter substrates 
In vitro data indicate that entrectinib has weak inhibitory potential towards organic anion-transporting 
polypeptide (OATP)1B1. The clinical relevance of this inhibition is unknown, but caution is advised 
when sensitive oral OATP1B1 substrates (e.g. atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin repaglinide, 
bosentan) are co-administered with entrectinib, due to the risk of increased absorption. 
Effect of entrectinib on substrates of PXR regulated enzymes 
In vitro studies indicate that entrectinib may induce pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulated enzymes 
(e.g. CYP2C family and UGT). Co-administration of entrectinib with CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 
substrates (e.g. repaglinide, warfarin, tolbutamide or omeprazole) may decrease their exposure. 
Oral contraceptives 
It is currently unknown whether entrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting 
hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives are 
advised to add a barrier method (see section 4.6). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effects of other medicinal products on entrectinib 
Based on in vitro data, CYP3A4 is the predominant enzyme mediating the metabolism of entrectinib 
and formation of its major active metabolite M5. 
Effect of CYP3A or P-gp inducers on entrectinib 
Co-administration of multiple oral doses of rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, with a single oral dose 
of entrectinib reduced entrectinib AUCinf by 77% and Cmax by 56%. 
Co-administration of entrectinib with CYP3A/P-gp inducers (including, but not limited to, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin, St. John's Wort -Hypericum 
perforatum-, apalutamide, ritonavir) should be avoided. 
Effect of CYP3A or P-gp inhibitors on entrectinib 
Co-administration of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, with a single oral dose of entrectinib 
increased AUCinf by 600% and Cmax by 173%. 
Co-administration of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited to, ritonavir, 
saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, grapefruit or Seville oranges) 
should be avoided. If concurrent use of strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 is unavoidable, dose 
adjustment of entrectinib is required (see section 4.2). 
Although, a marked effect of inhibitory P-gp medicinal products on entrectinib pharmacokinetics is 
not expected, caution is advised when treatment with strong or moderate P-gp inhibitors (e.g. 
verapamil, nifedipine, felodipine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine) are co-administered with entrectinib due to 
risk of increased entrectinib exposure (see section 5.2). 
Effect of medicinal products that increase gastric pH on entrectinib 
Co-administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), lansoprazole with a single 600 mg entrectinib 
dose reduced entrectinib AUC by 25% and Cmax by 23%. 
No dose adjustments are required when entrectinib is co-administered with PPIs or other drugs that 
raise gastric pH (e.g., H2 receptor antagonists or antacids). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Female patients of childbearing potential should have medically supervised pregnancy testing prior to 
initiating Rozlytrek therapy. 
Female patients of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive methods during 
treatment and for at least 5 weeks following the last dose of Rozlytrek. 
It is currently unknown whether entrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting 
hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.5). Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal 
contraceptives should be advised to add a barrier method. 
Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive 
methods during treatment and for at least 3 months following the last dose of Rozlytrek (see section 
5.3). 
Pregnancy 
There are no available data from the use of entrectinib in pregnant women. Based on animal studies 
and its mechanism of action, entrectinib may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rozlytrek is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
Female patients receiving Rozlytrek should be advised of the potential harm to the foetus. Female 
patients should be advised to contact the doctor, should pregnancy occur. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether entrectinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
A risk to the breast-fed children cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Rozlytrek. 
Fertility 
No fertility studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of entrectinib (see 
section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Rozlytrek has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be 
instructed not to drive or use machines until the symptoms resolve, if they experience cognitive 
adverse reactions, syncope, blurred vision, or dizziness, during treatment with Rozlytrek (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue, constipation, dysgeusia, oedema, dizziness, 
diarrhoea, nausea, dysaesthesia, dyspnoea, anaemia, increased weight, increased blood creatinine, 
pain, cognitive disorders, vomiting, cough, and pyrexia. The most frequent serious adverse reactions 
(≥2%) were lung infection (5.2%), dyspnoea (4.6%), cognitive impairment (3.8%), pleural effusion 
(3.0%) and fractures (3.8%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 4.6% 
of patients. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Tables 5 and 6 summarise the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurring in adult and paediatric patients 
treated with Rozlytrek in three clinical trials in adults (ALKA, STARTRK-1, STARTRK-2) and one 
clinical trial in pediatric patients (STARTRK-NG). The median duration of exposure was 5.5 months.  
Adverse drug reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class. The following categories of 
frequency have been used: very common ≥1/10, common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to 
<1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000). Within each system organ class, the 
adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Cognitive disorders 
A variety of cognitive symptoms was reported across clinical trials (section 4.4). These included 
events reported as cognitive disorders (6.3%), confusional state (7.3%), disturbance in attention 
(3.8%), memory impairment (4.2%), amnesia (2.8%), mental status changes (1.2%), hallucination 
(1.0%), delirium (0.8%), visual hallucination (0.4%) and mental disorder (0.2%). Grade 3 cognitve 
disorders were reported in 4.4% of patients. Adult patients who had CNS disease at baseline had a 
higher frequency of these adverse reactions (29.7%) compared to those without CNS disease (23.1%). 
The median time to onset for cognitive disorders was 0.92 months. 
Fractures 
Fractures were experienced by 9.0% (65/722) of adult patients and 25.0% (19/76) of paediatric 
patients. In general, there was inadequate assessment for tumour involvement at the site of fracture; 
however, radiologic abnormalities possibly indicative of tumour involvement were reported in some 
adult patients. In both adult and paediatric patients, most fractures were hip or other lower extremity 
fractures (e.g., femoral or tibial shaft) and some fractures occurred in the setting of a fall or other 
trauma.  
The median time to fracture was 8.1 months (range: 0.26 months to 45.34 months) in adults. Rozlytrek 
was interrupted in 26.2% of adults that experienced fractures. Seventeen adult patients had Rozlytrek 
treatment interrupted and none had treatment discontinued due to fractures.     
A total of 47 fracture events were reported in the 19 paediatric patients. The median time to fracture 
was 4.3 months (range: 2.0 months to 28.65 months) in paediatric patients. Rozlytrek was interrupted 
in 15.8% (3/19) of paediatric patients who experienced fractures. Nine of the fractures were Grade 2 
and 8 of the fractures were Grade 3. Six of the Grade 3 fractures were serious. There were no reports 
of tumour involvement at the site of the fracture.  
Ataxia 
Ataxia (including events of ataxia, balance disorder, and gait disturbances) was reported in 15.7% of 
patients. The median time to onset for ataxia was 0.4 months (range: 0.03 months to 28.19 months) 
and the median duration was 0.7 months (range: 0.03 months to 11.99 months). The majority of 
patients (67.1%) recovered from ataxia. Ataxia related adverse reactions were observed more 
frequently in elderly patients (23.8%) compared to patients below 65  years of age (12.8%). 
Syncope 
Syncope was reported in 4.6% of patients. In some patients, syncope was reported with concurrent 
hypotension, dehydration, or QTc prolongation and in other patients no other concurrent related 
conditions were reported. 
QTc interval prolongation 
Among the 504  patients who received entrectinib across clinical trials, 17 (4.0%) patients with at least 
one post-baseline ECG assessment experienced QTcF interval prolongation of >60 ms after starting 
entrectinib, and 12 (2.8%) patients had a QTcF interval of ≥500 ms (section 4.4). 
Peripheral sensory neuropathy 
Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in 15.7% of patients. The median time to onset was 
0.49 months (range 0.03 months to 20.93 months) and the median duration was 0.8 months (range: 
0.07 months to 6.01 months). The majority of patients (55.7%) recovered from peripheral neuropathy. 
Eye disorders 
Eye disorders reported across clinical trials included vision blurred (8.5%), diplopia (2.6%), and visual 
impairment (1.6%). The median time to onset for eye disorders was 1.9 months (range: 0.03 months to 
21.59 months). The median duration of eye disorders was 1 month (range 0.03 months to 14.49 
months). The majority of patients (61.7%) recovered from the eye disorder adverse reactions.

Paediatric population 
The overall safety profile of Rozlytrek in the paediatric population is similar to the safety profile in 
adults. 
The safety of Rozlytrek in paediatric patients was established based on extrapolation of data from 
three open-label, single-arm clinical trials in adult patients with solid tumours harbouring an NTRK 
gene fusion (ALKA, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-2), and data from 32 paediatric patients 
(30 patients enrolled in STARTRK-NG, and 2 patients enrolled in STARTRK-2). Of these, 2 patients 
were less than 2 years old, 23 patients were 2 to 11 years old, 7 patients were 12 to 17 years old. 
Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities of Grade 3 or 4 severity occurring more frequently (at 
least a 5% increased incidence) in paediatric patients compared to adult patients were neutropenia 
(28.1% vs. 3.4%), weight increased (21.9% vs 6.9%), headache (6.3% vs 0.6%) and bone fractures 
(10.5% vs 1.9%). 
There are limited safety data in adolescents, however, the safety profile in adolescents is similar to the 
overall safety profile of Rozlytrek. Adverse reactions Grade ≥3 reported in adolescents were 
neutropenia and headache. 
Elderly 
Among the 504 patients who received entrectinib across clinical trials, 130 (25.8%) patients were 
65 years or older and 34 (6.7%) were 75 years or older. The overall safety profile of entrectinib in the 
elderly patients is similar to the safety profile observed in patients younger than 65 years of age. 
Adverse reactions occurring more frequently in the elderly compared to patients less than 65 years old 
were dizziness (48.5% vs 36.6%), blood creatinine increased (31.5% vs 23.3%), and hypotension 
(21.5% vs 14.7%), ataxia (23.8% vs 12.8%). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Patients who experience overdose should be closely supervised and supportive care instituted. There 
are no known antidotes for entrectinib.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX14 
Mechanism of action 
Entrectinib is an inhibitor of the tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinases TRKA, TRKB and TRKC 
(encoded by the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase [NTRK] genes NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3, 
respectively), proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS (ROS1), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK), with IC50 values of 0.1 to 2 nM. The major active metabolite of entrectinib, M5, showed 
similar in vitro potency and activity against TRK, ROS1, and ALK. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fusion proteins that include TRK, ROS1 or ALK kinase domains drive tumourigenic potential through 
hyperactivation of downstream signalling pathways leading to unconstrained cell proliferation. 
Entrectinib demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibition of cancer cell lines derived from multiple 
tumour types, including subcutaneous and intracranial tumours, harbouring NTRK, ROS1, and ALK 
fusion genes. 
Prior treatments with other drugs that inhibit the same kinases may confer resistance to entrectinib. 
Resistance mutations in the TRK kinase domain identified following entrectinib discontinuation 
include NTRK1 (G595R, G667C) and NTRK3 (G623R, G623E and G623K). Resistance mutations in 
the ROS1 kinase domain identified following entrectinib discontinuation include G2032R, F2004C 
and F2004I. 
The molecular causes for primary resistance to entrectinib are not known. It is therefore not known if 
the presence of a concomitant oncogenic driver in addition to an NTRK gene fusion affects the efficacy 
of TRK inhibition. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours 
Efficacy in adult patients 
The efficacy of Rozlytrek was evaluated in a pooled sub-group of adult patients with unresectable or 
metastatic solid tumours with a NTRK gene fusion enrolled in one of three multicentre single-arm, 
open-label clinical trials (ALKA, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-2). To be included in the pooled 
subgroup, patients were required to have confirmed NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours; 
measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1; at least 
12 months of follow-up from the first post-treatment initiation tumour assessment, and no prior 
therapy with a TRK inhibitor (patients with concomitant driver mutations, where known, were 
excluded). Patients with primary CNS tumours were assessed separately using Response Assessment 
in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO). Patients received Rozlytrek 600 mg orally once daily until 
unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The primary efficacy endpoints were objective response 
rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as evaluated by Blinded Independent Central Review 
(BICR) according to RECIST v1.1. 
Efficacy was assessed in 150 adult patients with solid tumours with an NTRK gene fusion enrolled in 
these trials. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were: 49.3% males, median age of 
59 years (range 21 years to 88 years), 38% and 12% were 65 years or older and 75 years or older 
respectively, 58.7% white Caucasian, 26% Asian, 5.4% Hispanic or Latino and 63% never smokers. 
The ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status at baseline was 0 (41.3%), 
1 (50%), or 2 (8.7%). Most patients (95.3%) had metastatic disease [most common sites being lung 
(60.7%), lymph nodes (54.7%), bone (27.3%), liver (36%) and brain (20%)], 4.7% patients had locally 
advanced disease. 81.3% and 60.7% of patients had received surgery and radiotherapy for their cancer, 
respectively. 77.3% patients had received prior systemic therapy for their cancer including  
chemotherapy (69.3%) and 34% patients had no prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease. The 
most common cancers were sarcoma (21.3%), lung cancer (20.7%), salivary gland tumours (17.3%), 
thyroid cancer (10.7%) colorectal cancer (7.3%) and breast cancer (6%). Most patients (87.3%) had an 
NTRK gene fusion detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and 12.7% had a NTRK gene fusion 
detected by other nucleic acid-based tests. The overall median duration of follow-up was 30.6 months. 
Efficacy results from patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours are summarised in

Due to the rarity of NTRK gene fusion-positive cancers, patients were studied across multiple tumour 
types with a limited number of patients in some tumour types, causing uncertainty in the ORR 
estimate per tumour type. The ORR in the total population may not reflect the expected response in a 
specific tumour type. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The ORR in 78 patients that had broad molecular characterisation before Rozlytrek treatment was 
53.8% [42.2, 65.2]; of those, the ORR in 61 patients who had other genomic alterations in addition to 
NTRK gene fusion was 47.5% [34.6, 60.7] and the ORR in 17 patients without other genomic 
alterations was 76.5% [50.1, 93.2]. 
Intracranial response 
A BICR assessment resulted in a subgroup of 22 adult patients with CNS metastases at baseline, 
including 13 patients with measureable CNS lesions. Intracranial (IC) response assessed by BICR 
according to RECIST v1.1 was reported in 9 out of these 13 patients (3 CR and 6 PR), for an ORR of 
69.2% (95%  CI: 38.6, 90.9) and median DOR of 17.2 (7.4, NE). Five of these 13 patients had 
received intracranial radiotherapy to the brain within 2 months prior to starting Rozlytrek treatment. 
Primary CNS tumour  
Across the three trials, 12 adult patients with CNS primary tumours were treated with Rozlytrek with a 
minimum of 12 months of follow-up. One out of the 12 adult patients had an objective response 
assessed by BICR according to RANO. 
Efficacy in paediatric patients 
The efficacy of Rozlytrek in paediatric patients 12 years and older was based on extrapolation of data 
from three open-label, single-arm clinical trials in adult patients with solid tumours harbouring a 
NTRK gene fusion (ALKA, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-2), and efficacy and pharmacokinetic data 
in paediatric patients enrolled in STARTRK-NG. The best overall response as evaluated by BICR in 
5 paediatric patients, (all patients were less than 12 years of age and had more than 6 months of follow 
up; 3 patients had solid tumours and 2 patients had primary CNS tumours) showed 2 complete 
responses (epithelioid glioblastoma and infantile fibrosarcoma) and 3 partial responses (high-grade 
glioma, infantile fibrosarcoma and metastatic melanoma). The responses in 4 out of 5 paediatric 
patients were ongoing at the time of data cut-off (see section 4.2). 
ROS1-positive NSCLC 
The efficacy of Rozlytrek was evaluated in a pooled sub-group of patients with ROS1-positive 
metastatic NSCLC who received Rozlytrek 600 mg orally once daily and were enrolled in one of three 
multicentre single-arm, open label clinical trials (ALKA, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-2). To be 
included in the pooled sub-group, patients were required to have histologically confirmed, recurrent or 
metastatic, ROS1-positive NSCLC, ECOG performance status ≤2, measurable disease per RECIST 
v1.1, ≥6 months of follow-up, and no prior therapy with a ROS1 inhibitor. All patients were assessed 
for CNS lesions at baseline. 
The primary efficacy endpoints were ORR and DOR, as evaluated by BICR according to RECIST 
v1.1. The secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS, OS, and in patients presenting with CNS 
metastases at baseline - IC-ORR and IC-DOR, (also evaluated by BICR using RECIST v1.1). 
Efficacy was assessed in 161 patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC. The baseline demographic and 
disease characteristics were: 35.4% males, median age of 54 years (range 20 years to 86 years), 24.2% 
and 4.3% were older than 65 years and 75 years of age, respectively, 44.1% white Caucasian, 45.3% 
Asian, 4.3%, Black, 2.6% Hispanic or Latino and 62.7% never smokers. The ECOG (Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status at baseline was 0 (41%), 1 (49.1%), or 2 (9.9%). 
Most patients (98.1%) had metastatic disease [most common sites being lymph nodes (69.6%), lung 
(50.3%) and brain (32.9%)], 1.9% patients had locally advanced disease and 37.3% patients had no 
prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease. ROS1 positivity was determined by NGS in 83% of 
patients, by FISH in 9% of patients, and by RT-PCR in 8% of patients. The overall median duration of 
follow-up from receipt of the first dose was 15.8 months. 
Efficacy results from patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC are summarised in Table 9.

In the ROS1 positive NSCLC efficacy evaluable patients with ≥12 months of follow-up (N = 94), the 
ORR was 73.4% (95% CI: 63.3, 82), the median DoR was 16.5 months (95% CI: 14.6, 28.6) and 
median PFS was 16.8 months (95% CI: 12, 21.4). 
Intracranial response 
A BICR assessment resulted in a subgroup of 46 ROS1-positive NSCLC patients with CNS metastases 
at baseline including 24 patients with measureable CNS lesions. Intracranial response assessed by 
BICR according to RECIST v1.1 was reported in 19 of these 24 patients (3 CR and 16 PR) for an 
ORR of 79.2% (95% CI: 57.8, 92.9). The percentage of patients (95% CI) with DOR ≥6 months, 
≥9 months and ≥12 months was 76% (56, 97), 62% (38, 86), and 55% (29, 80), respectively (Kaplan-
Meier estimates). Nine of these 24 patients had received intracranial radiotherapy to the brain within 
2 months prior to starting Rozlytrek treatment.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Rozlytrek in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment with NTRK gene 
fusion-positive locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic parameters for entrectinib and its major active metabolite (M5), have been 
characterized in patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours and ROSI-positive NSCLC 
and healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of entrectinib and M5 are linear and are not 
dose-dependent or time-dependent. Steady state is achieved within one week for entrectinib and two 
weeks for M5 following daily administration of Rozlytrek. 
Entrectinib is a weak P-gp substrate based on in vitro data. The exact in vivo contribution of P-gp is 
unknown. M5 is a P-gp substrate. Entrectinib is not a substrate of BCRP but M5 is a substrate of 
BCRP. Entrectinib and M5 are not substrates of OATP 1B1 or OATP1B3. 
Absorption 
Following a single 600 mg oral administration of Rozlytrek to patients with NTRK gene 
fusion-positive and ROS1-positive NSCLC under fed conditions, entrectinib was rapidly absorbed 
reaching time-to-maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) after approximately 4 to 6 hours. Based on 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, steady-state was achieved within 5 days for entrectinib with 
600 mg once daily dosing. 
No clinically significant effect of food on entrectinib bioavailability was observed. 
Distribution 
Entrectinib and its major active metabolite M5 are highly bound to human plasma proteins 
independent of drug concentrations. In human plasma, entrectinib and M5 had similar protein binding 
with >99% bound at a clinically relevant concentration. 
After a single oral dose of entrectinib, the geometric mean volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 600 L, 
suggesting extensive distribution of the drug. Entrectinib demonstrated steady-state brain-to-plasma 
concentration ratios of 0.4 to 2.2 in multiple animal species (mice, rats, and dogs) at clinically relevant 
systemic exposures. 
Biotransformation 
Entrectinib is metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4 (~76%). Minor contributions from several other 
CYPs and UGT1A4 were estimated at <25% in total. The active metabolite M5 (formed by CYP3A4) 
and the direct N-glucuronide conjugate, M11, (formed by UGT1A4) are the two major circulating 
metabolites identified. 
Elimination 
The population PK model estimated mean accumulation at steady-state following 600 mg once daily 
administration of entrectinib was 1.89 (±0.381) and 2.01 (±0.437) for M5. Following administration of 
a single dose of [14C]-labelled entrectinib, 83% radioactivity was excreted in faeces (36% of the dose 
as unchanged entrectinib and 22% as M5) with minimal excretion in urine (3%). 
Entrectinib and M5 account for approximately 73% of radioactivity in systemic circulation at Cmax, 
and approximately half of total radioactivity AUCinf. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Population PK analysis estimated apparent clearance CL/F was 19.6 L/h and 52.4 L/h for entrectinib 
and M5, respectively. The elimination half-lives of entrectinib and M5 were estimated to be 20 hours 
and 40 hours, respectively. 
Linearity/Non-linearity 
Entrectinib has linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 100 mg to 600 mg. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Paediatric population 
Data obtained from population pharmacokinetic analyses show that in paediatric patients 12 years and 
older, a dose of 400 mg Rozlytrek once daily for BSA range 1.11 m2 to 1.50 m2, and a dose of 600 mg 
Rozlytrek once daily for BSA range ≥1.51 m2 results in a similar systemic exposure attained in adults 
treated with 600 mg of Rozlytrek, once daily. 
Elderly 
No differences in entrectinib exposure were noted in patients older than 65 years and younger adults 
based on pharmacokinetic analysis. 
Renal impairment 
Negligible amounts of entrectinib and the active metabolite M5 are excreted unchanged in urine 
(~3% of the dose) indicating that renal clearance plays a minor role in the elimination of entrectinib. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib are not 
significantly affected in renal impairment. The impact of severe renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of entrectinib is unknown. 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of entrectinib were studied in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate 
(Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, relative to subjects with normal 
hepatic function. Following administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg entrectinib, the combined 
AUClast of entrectinib and M5 showed no relevant change in the hepatic impaired groups compared to 
the normal function group. The AUClast geometric mean ratio (90% CI) was 1.30 (0.889, 1.89) for the 
mild, 1.24 (0.886, 1.73) for the moderate, and 1.39 (0.988, 1.95) for the severe hepatic impaired 
groups compared to the normal hepatic function group. For the unbound entrectinib and M5, the 
AUClast (fu) geometric mean ratio (90% CI) was 1.91 (1.21, 3.02) for the mild, 1.57 (1.06, 2.31) for the 
moderate, and 2.34 (1.57, 3.48) for the severe hepatic impaired groups compared to the normal hepatic 
function group. Although the effect of hepatic impairment on unbound PK parameters generally 
followed a similar direction as total PK parameters, due to the high non-specific binding in buffer and 
high variability, results should be interpreted with caution. 
In addition it was also observed that the variability in systemic exposure was high and observed 
exposures overlapped across all the study groups (see section 4.2).  
Effects of age, body weight, race and gender 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib were observed based on 
age (4 years to 86 years), sex, race (Asian, Black and White) and body weight (32 kg to 130 kg). 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of entrectinib. 
Genotoxicity 
Entrectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, but 
demonstrated a potential for abnormal chromosome segregation (aneugenicity) in cultured human 
peripheral blood lymphocytes. Entrectinib was not clastogenic or aneugenic in the in vivo 
micronucleus assay in rats and did not induce DNA damage in a comet assay in rats. 
Impairment of fertility 
Dedicated fertility studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the effect of entrectinib. No 
adverse effects of entrectinib on male and female reproductive organs were observed in the 
repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs at approximately 2.4-fold and 0.6-fold, respectively, 
the human exposure by AUC at the recommended human dose. 
Reproductive toxicity 
In an embryo-foetal developmental study in rats, maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain and 
food consumption) and foetal malformations (including body closure defects and malformations of the 
vertebrae and ribs), were observed at 200 mg/kg/day of entrectinib which represents approximately 
2-fold the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. Dose-response dependent reduced 
foetal body weight (low, middle and high dose) and reduced skeletal ossification (middle and high 
dose) were observed at exposures equivalent to <2 times the human exposure by AUC at the 
recommended dose. 
Repeat dose toxicity studies 
Entrectinib-related toxicities in repeat-dose studies in adult rats and dogs, and juvenile rats were 
observed in the CNS (convulsions, abnormal gait, tremors) at ≥0.2 times the human exposures by Cmax 
at the recommended dose, skin (scabs/sores) and decreased RBC parameters at ≥0.1 times the human 
exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. In adult rats and dogs, effects on liver (increased ALT 
and hepatocellular necrosis) were observed at ≥0.6 times the human exposure by AUC at the 
recommended dose. In dogs, diarrhoea at ≥0.1 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended 
dose and prolongations of QT/QTc interval at ≥0.1 times the human exposure by Cmax at the 
recommended dose were also observed. 
Juvenile rat toxicology study 
In a 13-week juvenile rat toxicology study animals were dosed daily from post-natal day 7 to day 97 
(approximately equivalent to neonate to adulthood in humans). In addition to CNS effects, ptosis and 
skin effects, decreased RBC parameters and effects on growth and development were observed in the 
dosing and recovery phases including decreased body weight gain and delayed sexual maturation (at 
≥4 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.1 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose). 
Deficits in neurobehavioral assessments including functional observational battery (decreased landing 
foot splay, decreased fore and hind limb grip strength that seemed to manifest later in age) and 
learning and memory (at ≥8mg/kg/day, approximately 0.2 times the human exposure by AUC at the 
recommended dose), and decreased femur length (at ≥16 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.3 times the 
human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose) were observed.

1.  What Rozlytrek is and what it is used for 
What Rozlytrek is 
Rozlytrek is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance entrectinib. 
What Rozlytrek is used for 
Rozlytrek is used to treat either: 
• 
adults and children 12 years of age and older with solid tumour (cancer) in various parts of the 
body that is caused by a change in the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene, or 
adults with a type of lung cancer called ‘non-small cell lung cancer’ (NSCLC) that is caused by 
a change in the ROS1 gene. 
NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumour cancer 
It is used when: 
• 
a test has shown that your cancer cells have a change in genes called ‘NTRK’ and has spread 
within the affected organ or to other organs in your body or if surgery to remove the cancer is 
likely to result in severe complications (see ‘How Rozlytrek works’ below), and 
you have not received treatment with medicines called NTRK inhibitors 
other treatments have not worked or are not suitable for you. 
• 
• 
• 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ROS1-positive non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
It is used if your lung cancer: 
• 
is ‘ROS1-positive’ – this means that your cancer cells have a change in a gene called ‘ROS1’ 
(see ‘How Rozlytrek works’ below), 
is advanced – for example, has spread to other parts of your body (metastatic), and 
you have not received treatment with medicines called ROS1 inhibitors. 
• 
• 
How Rozlytrek works 
Rozlytrek works by blocking the action of abnormal enzymes caused by a change in the NTRK or 
ROS1 genes that make them. The faulty enzymes encourage the cancer cells to grow. 
Rozlytrek may slow down or stop the cancer growing. It may also help to shrink your cancer. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Rozlytrek 
Do not take Rozlytrek 
• 
if you are allergic to entrectinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Rozlytrek.

• 
•

you have a history of fractured bones, or conditions which may increase your risk of breaking 
bones, called ‘osteoporosis’ or ‘osteopaenia’

you have heart failure (an inability for your heart to adequately pump blood to supply oxygen to 
the body) – signs can include cough, shortness of breath, and swelling in your legs or arms 
you have or had heart disorders or a heart conduction problem called ‘prolonged QTc interval’ – 
this is shown on an ‘electro-cardiogram’ (ECG), or low levels of electrolytes (potassium, 
magnesium, calcium or phosphorus) in your blood 
you have an inherited problem called ‘galactose intolerance’, ‘congenital lactase deficiency’ or 
‘glucose-galactose malabsorption’.

Women and contraception 
You should not become pregnant while taking this medicine because it could harm the baby. If you are 
able to become pregnant, you must use highly effective contraception while on treatment and for at 
least 5 weeks after stopping treatment. 
It is not known if Rozlytrek can reduce the effect of birth control medicines (pills or implanted 
hormonal contraceptives). You should use another reliable method of birth control such as a barrier 
method (e.g. condom) so you do not become pregnant while you are taking Rozlytrek and for 5 weeks 
after you stop treatment.

Men and contraception 
Your female partner should not become pregnant while you are taking this medicine because it could 
harm the baby. If your female partner is able to become pregnant, you must use highly effective 
contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months after stopping treatment. Talk to your 
doctor about the right methods of contraception for you and your partner.

dose, tell your doctor straight away. 
Breast-feeding  
Do not breast-feed while taking this medicine. This is because it is not known if Rozlytrek can pass 
over into breast milk and could therefore harm your baby.

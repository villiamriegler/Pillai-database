1.  Background information on the procedure  
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Novo Nordisk A/S submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 2 May 2022 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC in order to delete the statement in reference to previously untreated 
patients (PUPs) and section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update information based on final results from 
study NN7088-3908; this is an open-label single-arm multicentre non-controlled phase 3a trial 
investigating safety and efficacy of turoctocog alfa pegol (N8-GP) in prophylaxis and treatment of 
bleeding episodes in previously untreated paediatric patients with severe haemophilia A. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0142/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0142/2017 was completed.  
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0142/2017.  
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance  
Turoctocog alfa pegol (referred as N8-GP or Esperoct here after) is a long-acting recombinant coagulation 
factor VIII (rFVIII) product, which is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeds in patients with 
haemophilia A. An extended half-life is achieved via the covalent conjugation of a 40 kDa (kilo Dalton) 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety to an O-linked glycan site on the B-domain of turoctocog alfa. The 
mechanism of action for N8-GP is based on replacement of the deficient or absent FVIII in patients with 
haemophilia A.  
Esperoct was approved by the CHMP (date of issue of marketing authorisation valid throughout the 
European Union: 20/06/2019) after a positive benefit-risk balance was concluded for subjects >12 years 
of age. However, the medicine is under additional monitoring. A PASS is ongoing to evaluate the long-
term safety with respect to FVIII inhibitor development, allergic/hypersensitivity reactions and long term 
potential effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and other tissues/organs. 
Potential effects on brain development were also a crucial factor to conclude a negative benefit-risk for 
subjects <12 years. The ongoing long-term safety observation as well as the negative benefit-risk for 
subjects <12 years are not part of the requested changes as part of this type II variation. 
The data presented for this type II variation address the clinical evidence for the treatment of previously 
untreated children (below 6 years) with severe haemophilia A. For this purpose the MAH presents an 
open-label study (trial 3908) to provide clinical evidence for previously untreated patients (PUPs) with 
haemophilia A that were treated with Esperoct following a pre-prophylactic (treatment of bleeds) and/or 
prophylactic (prevention of bleeds) treatment regimens. Data from this trial are intended to justify 
Assessment report  
EMA/125435/2023

revisions for the product information. More specifically the MAH intends to delete a statement regarding 
lack of data for PUPs in section 4.2 of the SmPC and to introduce a new chapter on study results in PUPs 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
As per guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor VIII 
products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev. 2) formal PUP studies are not required but every PUP 
should be closely monitored with regards to treatment performance and inhibitor development. The 
availability of clinical data for PUPs provides product-specific information regarding the risk for developing 
anti-FVIII antibodies and is acknowledged. PUPs are of high risk to develop inhibitory antibodies (ABs) 
against FVIII. Inhibitors occur very commonly in PUPs with haemophilia A, usually within the first 50 
exposure days. Thus, the chosen primary endpoint addressing the development of FVIII inhibitors is 
supported. In total 81 PUPs were exposed to Esperoct (a mean of 205.8 EDs per patient) and 49 subjects 
completed trial 3908 with the submission at hand (55 subjects started in pre-prophylaxis and 26 started 
in prophylaxis). As per GL regarding previously treated patients (PTPs), at least 25 patients should be <6 
years who have undergone >50 EDs with previous factor VIII products. Patient numbers and EDs 
presented here for PUPs appear sufficient to principally conclude on efficacy and safety in PUPs. 
During study 3908 26.25% of PUPs developed inhibitory antibodies against FVIII (21 of 80 patients) and 
13.75% of subjects developed high titre inhibitory antibodies against FVIII (11 of 80 patients). Thus, 
incidence of FVIII inhibitor formation for Esperoct in PUPs is very common (i.e. frequency ≥1/10 
patients), but is an expected frequency (as per outcome of the FVIII referral and FVIII Core SmPC) and 
appears comparable to other recombinant FVIII products (see Calvez et al 2014). Furthermore, the 
majority of FVIII inhibitors developed before ED50, which is in line with the expected highest risk during 
the first 50 EDs as depicted in the GL (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev. 2). Data on FVIII inhibitors in 
PUPs and PTPs are reflected in the SmPC section 4.8 (see also SmPC). 
The occurrence of AEs was comparable to the incidence rates as reported for previously treated patients 
of the same age group (<6 years) in the current EPAR (96.3% and 94.1% of patients, respectively). 
However, the rate of serious AEs appears much higher for PUPs (59.3% and 29.4% of patients, 
respectively) and more PUPs had severs AEs (28.4% and 20.6% of patients, respectively). The MAH  
clarified that the higher rate of SAEs in PUPs can be attributed to the high rate of inhibitor-related SAEs in 
PUPs compared to the PTPs and the lower median age of the PUPs from trial 3908 (8 months) compared 
to the PTPs from trial 3885 (3 years) of the same age group (<6 years).  
Presented results from study 3908 regarding efficacy in PUPs appear principally comparable to results as 
presented in the current EPAR for the treatment of previously treated patients of the same age group. 
Thus, no concerns arise from presented results on efficacy for trial 3908.  
Regarding pharmacokinetics in PUPs treated with Esperoct, 17 patients were observed with consecutive 
low incremental recoveries (IRs) and further 14 patients had a single measure of low IR, whereas 28 
subjects did not have any measure of decreased IR. These numbers indicate that the majority of the PUPs 
had at least one measure of a decreased IR. Based on a root-cause analysis the MAH concludes that a 
transient increase in anti-PEG antibodies is driving the transient decrease in IR for some PUPs. Due to low 
patient numbers, the analyses are not fully conclusive, but anti-drug antibodies appear to be a 
reasonable explanation for the observed drop in IR in some PUPs. The highest proportion of subjects with 
consecutive low IR had confirmed antibodies after exposure to Esperoct (64.7% had anti-N8-GP 
antibodies, 100% had anti-PEG IgG antibodies and 70.1% had anti-PEG IgM antibodies) and most of the 
subjects with low IR did not have antibodies at baseline, but developed such after exposure to Esperoct 
(58.8% for anti-N8-GP, 58.8% for anti-PEG IgG and 47.1% for anti-PEG IgM antibodies). Upon request, 
the MAH clarified that no PTPs were observed with consecutive low IR during trials 3859 and 3885. Also 
no decrease in IR was observed in paediatric PTPs with pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies at baseline. Thus, 
the correlation of anti-PEG antibodies and transient low IR appears conclusive only for PUPs. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/125435/2023 
Page 5/32 
 
 
 
 
information on potentially reduced IR is an important identified risk that is considered clinically very 
relevant and should be reflected in the SmPC (section 4.4) once a label update is submitted to extend the 
indication to PUPs <6 years. As patients <12 years are currently not licensed for the treatment with 
Esperoct, it appears sufficient to include a respective statement regarding transient low IR in section 5.1 
(as per SmPC guideline rev. 2). 
In summary, the proposed change in 4.2 (i.e. deletion of the statement “The safety and efficacy of 
Esperoct in previously untreated patients have not yet been established”) is acceptable based on provided 
data from trial 3908. Further information on PUPs is included in sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The benefit-risk balance of Esperoct, remains positive for subjects >12 years of age. The benefit-risk 
remains negative for subjects <12 years of age, as depicted in the current EPAR. It is suggested that an 
update of the EPAR according to the results presented for PUPs will be initiated.

5.  Introduction  
Turoctocog alfa pegol (referred as N8-GP or Esperoct here after) is a long-acting recombinant coagulation 
factor VIII (rFVIII) product, which is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeds in patients with 
haemophilia A. The extended half-life is due to the covalent conjugation of a 40 kDa (kilo Dalton) 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety to an O-linked glycan site on the B-domain of turoctocog alfa. The 
mechanism of action for N8-GP is based on replacement of the deficient or absent FVIII in patients with 
haemophilia A.  
As of December 2021, N8-GP has received regulatory approvals in more than 35 countries worldwide, 
including the EEA, and is currently marketed under the trade name Esperoct. Esperoct was approved by 
the CHMP (Date of issue of marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union: 20/06/2019) 
after a positive benefit-risk balance was concluded for subjects >12 years of age. However, the medicine 
is under additional monitoring. A PASS is ongoing to evaluate the long-term safety with respect to FVIII 
inhibitor development, allergic/hypersensitivity reactions and long term potential effects of PEG 
accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and other tissues/organs. The data presented for this type 
II variation from clinical trial 3908 address the clinical evidence for the treatment of previously untreated 
children (below 6 years) with severe haemophilia A utilizing Esperoct. 
6.  Clinical Efficacy aspects  
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted  
Trial 3908 was a multicentre, open label, non-controlled, single-arm trial that investigated safety and 
efficacy of N8-GP in prophylaxis and treatment of breakthrough bleeds in PUPs with severe haemophilia A 
(FVIII activity ≤1%). A pre-prophylaxis period up to 20 EDs or 24 months was optional, before initiation 
of prophylaxis treatment. 
Trial 3908 consisted of the 6-month to 3-year main phase followed by a 6-month to 1-year extension 
phase. The main phase included both the pre-prophylaxis and prophylaxis treatment where patients 
received treatment with N8-GP until they reached a minimum of 50 EDs. During the extension phase, 
patients continued the prophylaxis dosing regimen until they reached a minimum of 50 EDs. The trial also 
consisted of a prophylaxis period until the end of the trial.

Primary Objective 
To evaluate immunogenicity of N8-GP in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with severe haemophilia A. 
The primary endpoint is a safety endpoint defined as incidence of inhibitory antibodies against FVIII. 
Secondary Objectives 
To evaluate safety other than immunogenicity of N8-GP in PUPs with severe haemophilia A 
To evaluate efficacy of N8-GP in PUPs with severe haemophilia A 
- in long-term prophylaxis treatment (bleeding preventive effect) 
- in the treatment of bleeding episodes 
There are no confirmatory secondary endpoints in this trial. Supportive secondary endpoints include 
“Number of bleeding episodes during prophylaxis (annualised)”, “Haemostatic effect (4-point response 
scale: excellent, good, moderate and none)”, “Incidence of confirmed high titre inhibitors (>5BU)”, “FVIII 
consumption (for prophylaxis, for treatment of bleeding episodes, total per patient)”, “Adverse events 
including SAEs and MESI”, “Incremental recovery (IR30min)”, “FVIII activity at 30 minutes (C30min)” 
and “FVIII trough level”. 
Changes in trial conduct 
There were 8 amendments to the protocol. With protocol amendment no. 8 (15-Jun-2020), recruitment to 
the trial was terminated, which meant that less than 100 patients, as originally planned, completed the 
trial.

6.2.1. Study conduct 
Patient flow 
A total of 88 patients were screened for participation in the trial, of which 82 patients were enrolled and 
81 patients were exposed to N8-GP (one patient signed the informed consent but was not exposed). Of 
the 81 patients exposed to N8-GP, 55 patients started on pre-prophylaxis and 26 patients started on 
prophylaxis when entering the trial.   
Figure 2: Schematic overview of patient flow during the trial 
During the main phase, 42 patients switched from pre-prophylaxis to prophylaxis and 2 patients switched 
from pre-prophylaxis to ITI treatment. Patients who switched treatment regimen are represented in all 3 
treatment regimen groups (pre-prophylaxis, prophylaxis, and total) where they contributed with data 
from the relevant treatment period.

Haemostatic effect of N8-GP during surgery 
A successful haemostatic effect was reported for 25 (83.3%) of the 30 minor surgeries (including missing 
responses considered as failures). A successful haemostatic effect was reported for 4 (100.0%) of the 4 
major surgeries. Hence, a successful haemostatic effect was reported for 29 (85.3%) of the total 34 
surgeries. The mean number of N8-GP doses per surgery was 4.5 (range: 1; 16), with a median of 3.0 
number of doses per surgery. 
Consumption of N8-GP for prophylaxis 
The mean (SD) and median number of N8-GP doses used for prophylaxis per patient during 
main+extension phase was 236.6 (208.2) and 177 doses, respectively, ranging from 7 doses (in a 
withdrawn patient) to 792 doses per patient. A total of 15,762 prophylaxis doses were administered. The 
actual mean (SD) and median prophylaxis dose was 68.9 (7.6) and 69.0 IU/kg, respectively. This was 
within the per-protocol specified dose range of 50-75 IU/kg. 
Consumption of N8-GP for treatment of bleeds 
For the total 505 bleeds treated with N8-GP in 75 patients the mean number of injections per bleed was 
1.4 (range: 1; 12), with a median of 1.0 number of injections per bleed. Of the 505 bleeds, 405 bleeds 
(80.2%) were treated with 1 injection and 55 bleeds (10.9%) were treated with 2 injections; hence 460 
bleeds (91.1%) were treated with ≤2 injections of N8-GP. The mean (SD) and median total amount of N8-
GP (IU/kg) used for treatment of a bleed was 98.6 (87.5) and 71.4 IU/kg per bleed, respectively. 
There were no clinically significant differences between patients on pre-prophylaxis and prophylaxis with 
regards to number of injections and dose (IU/kg) of N8-GP used per bleed. 
Total consumption of N8-GP per patient (prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes) 
The mean annual consumption of N8-GP per patient (including all doses, i.e., for pre-prophylaxis, 
prophylaxis, treatment of bleeds, surgery, and PK assessments) was 4525.7 IU/kg/patient/year. The 
median annual consumption was 4027.0 IU/kg/year/patient with a range from 450.9 to 9083.4 
IU/kg/year/patient. 
Immune tolerance induction (ITI) treatment  
Patients who developed FVIII inhibitors in the trial were offered ITI treatment with N8-GP. If a newly 
diagnosed inhibitor patient still responded well to treatment with N8-GP, initiation of ITI could be 
postponed with up to 6 months, or ITI could be cancelled if the inhibitors had resolved during the 6 
months. If an inhibitor patient on ITI was confirmed negative for inhibitors (<0.6 BU), FVIII recovery 
should be measured after an injection of 60 IU/kg of N8-GP without washout period. If IR was shown to 
be ≥1.2 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg), a FVIII half-life assessment was to be conducted after injection of 60 IU/kg of 
N8-GP (after a 72 hours treatment-free washout period), and repeated if necessary, until the half-life was 
confirmed to be ≥9 hours. 
A total of 21 patients developed FVIII inhibitors, of which 8 patients had initiated ITI treatment. Of the 8 
patients who initiated ITI treatment, 6 patients had completed ITI treatment at the DBL, and 4 patients 
out of these had been reported by the investigator with a ‘yes’ to a clinical effect from ITI treatment. The 
status of 2 patients on ITI is still ongoing at the time of this report. Of the 13 inhibitor patients that had

not initiated ITI treatment during the trial, 11 patients had withdrawn from the trial while 2 patients 
received prophylaxis. Eight (8) bleeds were observed in 4 of the 8 ITI patients during ITI treatment. The 
ABR estimate (negative binomial model) was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.42; 1.68) bleeds/patient/year. The median 
ABR was 0.25 (interquartile range: 0.00; 1.32) bleeds/patient/year. Two (2) bleeds were treated with 
excellent haemostatic response, 3 bleeds were treated with good haemostatic response, and 3 bleeds 
were treated with moderate haemostatic response. The success rate for treatment of bleeds during ITI 
was 75.0% (95% CI: 23.8; 96.6). During ITI there were no MESIs, and there were 3 SAEs (all unlikely 
related to trial product and resolved/recovered). 
Pharmacokinetic assessments – FVIII activity 
Mean FVIII activity (IU/mL) at pre-dose and at 30 min post-dose, obtained with the chromogenic assay 
with PSS as calibrator, is presented by visit in Figure 11-1 for patients on twice weekly or every 3rd day 
prophylaxis regimen. FVIII activities in pre-dose samples (i.e., FVIII trough levels) were as expected due 
to the relatively high clearance of N8-GP in young children. 
Figure 3: Profiles of mean FVIII activity (IU/mL) at pre-dose and at 30min post-dose by visit – 
chromogenic assay with PSS as calibrator – main + extension 
The FVIII activity 30 min post dosing at visit 3, which corresponds to 5 EDs, was lower than expected for 
some patients. This observation is discussed in detail in the following Section. It should be noted that 
post-dose samples were not available for all patients at the early visits, and that later visits, from visits 7 
and on, included more samples compared to the early visits. 
Observations of decreased incremental recovery (IR)  
A safety signal related to observations of a decrease in incremental recovery (IR) following the initial

observed in the trial. The safety signal was later evaluated by the Novo Nordisk safety committee to be 
an important identified risk of “low initial incremental recovery in PUPs”. 
Low IR was defined as an IR <0.6 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg). This definition was based on the lowest IR value 
observed in previously treated paediatric patients of the same age (i.e., <6 years), receiving 60 IU/kg 
twice weekly prophylaxis during the main phase of trial NN7088-3885. Thus, 0.6 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) was to 
be considered the best cut-point for specifying what a decreased IR value should be. 
A post hoc analysis of all available IR values obtained at baseline (the very first exposure; ED 1) to N8-GP 
in the present trial (N=45) has subsequently shown that the mean IR at first exposure to N8-GP was 1.76 
(IU/dL)/(IU/kg) and the 5% percentile was 0.71 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg). Thus, based on the actual distribution of 
baseline IR, theoretically only 5% of all such values would fall below 0.71 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg). This supports 
that use of <0.6 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) is a valid set point for definition of a decreased IR value, as was just 
defined above. 
Figure 4: Profiles of IR (mean±SEM) (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) for patients with consecutive decreased IR (n=17) 
and “other” (n=42) non-inhibitor patients – chrom PSS 
A total of 59 non-inhibitor patients (i.e., absence of FVIII inhibitors) were included in these assessments. 
Three sub-populations were defined from the 59 non-inhibitor patients: 
Non-inhibitor patients with no measurements of decreased IR (N=28 patients): These patients had no 
decreased IR measurements (i.e., no observations of IR <0.6 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg)). Patients with missing 
measurements of IR were included, as were patients who withdrew before 10 EDs. Non-inhibitor patients 
with single measurement(s) of decreased IR (N= 14 patients): These patients had one single observation 
of decreased IR, but no consecutive observations of decreased IR. Non-inhibitor patients with consecutive 
decreased IR (N=17 patients): These patients have at least 2 consecutive observations of decreased IR. 
A period of decreased IR in a patient was defined as the period from the last visit before the patient had 
the first decreased IR measurement until IR was again ≥0.6 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg).

Table 9: Details of bleeds occurring during periods of consecutive or single decreased IR in non-inhibitor 
patients, and for all bleeds in all patients during the trial – main + extension 
Root cause analysis 
There were no clinically relevant differences in country of origin, ethnicity or race. The 17 patients with a 
low IR were on average approximately twice as old as the 42 ‘other patients’ at first dose in the trial 
(17.2 vs 9.2 months). Reported bleeding frequency was comparable between low-IR patients and ‘other 
patients’: There were no clinically relevant differences in adverse event rates or types of adverse events 
reported between low-IR patients and remaining patients. 
The proportion of patients who developed anti-drug antibodies was higher for low-IR patients compared 
to the ‘other patients’; 64.7% vs. 26.2% for anti-FVIII antibodies, 70.6% vs. 61.9% for anti-PEG IgG 
antibodies, respectively. There were 53.0% low IR patients vs. 14.3% ‘other patients’ who developed 
anti-PEG IgM antibodies. These findings were consistent with an increased immune response in non-
inhibitor low IR patients across the three analysed antibodies. In patients with consecutive decreased IR, 
a transient increase of anti-PEG IgG with peak levels at ED 5 (Visit 3) was observed, followed by a 
gradual decrease in antibody levels. 
Statistically significant associations between IR and each of the 3 antibodies were found.

6.3.  Discussion  
The MAH presents an open-label study to provide clinical evidence for PUPs with haemophilia A that were 
treated with Esperoct following a pre-prophylactic (treatment of bleeds) and/or prophylactic (prevention 
of bleeds) regimen. Initially it was planned that the analysis and evaluation for the main trial report will 
be performed when at least 50 patients have reached a minimum of 50 EDs each in the main phase and 
at least 100 patients have reached at least 100 EDs each before the trial is completed. However, a 
protocol amendment was conducted to introduce an interim analysis and in the scope of another protocol 
amendment the number of subjects required to complete the trial was reduced, due to upcoming 
recruitment issues. This amendment specified that initially planned patient numbers may not be met (i.e. 
100 PUPs complete the trial) and that only a minimum of 50 PUPs would be required to complete the trial. 
In the end 81 PUP were exposed to Esperoct (a mean of 205.8 EDs per patient) and 49 subjects 
completed trial 3908 with the submission at hand (55 subjects started in pre-prophylaxis and 26 started 
in prophylaxis). No formal sample size calculations have been performed. Thus, no impact of reduced 
patient numbers on statistical considerations is expected. As per GL regarding previously treated patients, 
at least 25 patients should be <6 years. Thus, patient numbers and EDs presented here for PUPs appear 
sufficient to principally conclude on efficacy and safety in PUPs. 
The development of FVIII inhibitors was chosen as primary endpoint of trial 3908, which is supported as 
anti-drug antibodies are a major concern for PUPs. Further details regarding the primary endpoint are 
being discussed in section 7. Clinical Safety Aspects. The selection of secondary endpoints for the 
evaluation of efficacy are in line with other FVIII products and fully supported. In summary, presented 
results from study 3908 regarding efficacy in PUP appear principally comparable to results as presented in 
the current EPAR for the treatment of previously treated patients of the same age group (i.e. <6 years; 
e.g. mean ABR of 3.1 and 3.46 (during prophylaxis), success/failure rate of 87/13% and 89/11%, mean 
prophylaxis dose of 65.3 IU//kg and 68.9 IU/kg in previously treated (as per study 3885 main + 
extension phase in EPAR) and previously untreated (as per study 3908 main + extension phase) subjects 
<6 years, respectively. Thus, no concerns arise from presented results on efficacy for trial 3908. 
Data on immune tolerance induction (ITI) have been collected in PUPs with haemophilia A who have 
developed inhibitors to FVIII during trial 3908. However, patient numbers are not sufficient to draw any 
robust conclusions regarding the effect of ITI in PUP with anti-FVIII inhibitors during the therapy with 
Esperoct (n=8 PUP with FVIII-inhibitors started ITI, n=6 patients completed the ITI phase and n=4 had a 
positive clinical effect). 
Regarding pharmacokinetics in PUPs treated with Esperoct, 17 patients were observed with consecutive 
low IRs and further 14 patients had a single measure of low IR, whereas 28 subjects did not have any 
measure of decreased IR. These numbers indicate that the majority of the PUP had at least one measure 
of a decreased IR. It is agreed with the MAH that “a low IR could constitute a clinical concern in a patient 
Assessment report  
EMA/125435/2023 
Page 22/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as it indicates that the availability of the drug product in the blood is reduced”. In line with this concern, 
bleeds in subjects with consecutive low IRs were more likely to be severe bleeds compared to the bleeds 
in all patients (13.2% and 2.5% of bleeds were severe, respectively) and the haemostatic response 
during periods of consecutive low IRs appears worse compared to the overall response for all bleeds (i.e. 
less excellent and more failed or moderate responses as well as a lower success rate). Furthermore, the 
proportion of subjects reporting an AE in the SOC Blood and lymphatic system disorders is more than 8-
times higher in subjects with consecutive low IRs compared to all other patients (all other patients include 
those with a single event of low IR; 41.2% and 4.8%, respectively). Similarly, the SOC Reproductive 
system and breast disorders had higher rates in subjects with consecutive low IRs compared to all other 
patients (17.6% and 2.4%, respectively). Thus, clinical consequences in relation to the low IR were 
observed in study 3908, but it should also be noted that results are produced from post-hoc analyses and 
are compromised by low patient numbers. Importantly, the MAH provided a root-cause analysis from 
which the association to anti-drug antibodies (including PEG-IgG, PEG-IgM and anit-N8-GP) appears 
plausible. The observation of low IR for a subset of PUPs also triggered a protocol amendment to include 
further assessments of anti-PEG-IgG and anti-PEG-IgM antibodies. Based on further analyses, the MAH 
concludes that a transient increase in anti-PEG antibodies for some PUPs is driving the transient decrease 
in IR for these subjects. The biggest proportion of subjects with consecutive low IR had confirmed 
antibodies after exposure to Esperoct (64.7% of PUPs with consecutive low IR had anti-N8-GP antibodies, 
100% had anti-PEG IgG antibodies and 70.1% had anti-PEG IgM antibodies) and most of the subjects 
with low IR did not have antibodies at baseline, but developed such after exposure to Esperoct (58.8% of 
PUPs with consecutive low IR had anti-N8-GP, 58.8% had anti-PEG IgG and 47.1% had anti-PEG IgM 
antibodies after exposure, but not at baseline). Due to low patient numbers, the analyses are not fully 
conclusive, but anti-drug antibodies appear to be a reasonable explanation for the observed drop in IR in 
some PUPs. It should be mentioned that the reduced IR was seen after the initial administrations of 
Esperoct and was transient as also seems to hold for the anti-PEG IgG antibodies. Taken together, the 
information on potentially reduced IR is an important identified risk that is considered clinically very 
relevant. Thus, findings on decreased IRs in a subset of PUPs should be adequately reflected in the EPAR. 
As patients <12 years are currently not licensed for the treatment with Esperoct, a statement regarding 
transient low IR in section 5.1 appears sufficient (as per SmPC guideline rev. 2). However, it is noted that 
a respective warning should be reflected in the SmPC (section 4.4) once a label update is submitted to 
extend the indication to PUPs <6 years. Additionally, closer monitoring of FVIII levels upon treatment 
initiation with this pegylated FVIII product in PUPs should be evaluated in more detail once licensure for 
paediatric subjects is requested. Upon request, the MAH amended the provided information on PUPs in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
7.  Clinical Safety aspects  
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted  
Primary endpoint – Incidence of FVIII inhibitors 
The primary endpoint of the trial was incidence of FVIII inhibitors. Assessment for the presence of 
inhibitors was mandatory at each clinical visit, and could also be performed at any time point at the 
discretion of the investigator. In case of a positive inhibitor test (≥0.6 BU), a second blood sample and a 
confirmatory inhibitor test was to be performed. If the second confirmatory test was positive, the patient 
was considered an inhibitor patient. Inhibitors >5 BU were defined as high titre inhibitors. An inhibitor 
patient counted only once (numerator) in the statistical analysis of the inhibitor incidence regardless of 
subsequent positive or negative inhibitor test results. Measurements of FVIII inhibitors were performed 
using a heat-treated Nijmegen FVIII Bethesda assay validated according to international recognised 
Assessment report  
EMA/125435/2023 
Page 23/32 
 
 
 
 
guidelines. Blood sampling for the inhibitor test was performed at least 72 hours after last administration 
of N8-GP to allow for wash-out of FVIII that otherwise could interfere with the test. Less than 72 hours 
was acceptable in a patient with increased clearance (e.g., in an already confirmed inhibitor patient). 
Adverse Events 
The investigator was responsible for detecting, documenting, recording and following up on events that 
met the definition of an AE or a SAE as detailed in the protocol. All AEs either observed by the 
investigator or reported spontaneously by the patients were to be recorded by the investigator and 
evaluated. This included events from the first trial-related activity after the patient’s parent(s)/LAR(s) has 
signed the informed consent until the end of trial visit. In addition, the patients were to be asked at each 
visit whether they had had any AEs (including any changes in concomitant illness or new illnesses) since 
the last visit. The investigator was to assess all AEs with regards to seriousness (serious, non-serious), 
severity (mild, moderate, severe), causality (probable, possible, unlikely), and final outcome 
(recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, not recovered/resolved, 
fatal, unknown) by following the definitions in the trial protocol. The investigator was required to report 
SAEs to Novo Nordisk by forwarding the completed AE form within 24 hours and the Safety Information 
Form within 5 days. In addition to the standard reporting of AEs/SAEs, certain event types were 
designated medical events of special interest (MESI) and required additional data collection via dedicated 
event forms.

Development of anti-N8-GP, anti-PEG IgM and anti-PEG IgG binding antibodies 
Plasma samples were collected at baseline and during the trial for assessment of: 
-  Anti-N8-GP binding antibodies (no cross-reactivity to anti-PEG antibodies) 
-  Anti-PEG IgM binding antibodies 
-  Anti-PEG IgG binding antibodies 
Due to the small sample volumes collected in young children, some patient samples could not be 
measured for all 3 types of antibodies. Of a total of 81 exposed patients, 42 patients (51.9%) developed 
anti-N8-GP binding antibodies, 22 patients (27.1%) developed anti-PEG IgM binding antibodies and 51 
patients (63.0%) developed anti-PEG IgG binding antibodies.

Deaths and other serious adverse events 
No deaths were reported. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs): A total of 80 SAEs in 48 patients (59.3%) were reported during the trial 
(main+extension phase), corresponding to an overall rate of 0.36 SAEs per patient year in trial. 
The most frequent SAEs (24 events) were reported in SOC ‘blood and lymphatic system disorders’, of 
which 23 events in 22 patients were reported under PT ‘factor VIII inhibition’ (event rate 0.10 AEs per 
patient year in trial). Second most frequent SAEs (19 events) were in 12 patients reported under SOC 
‘infections and infestations’ (event rate 0.08 AEs per patient year in trial), distributed on 17 different PTs. 
Twenty-seven (27) SAEs were evaluated by investigator as probably or possibly related to N8-GP, of 
which 22 SAEs alone were reported with preferred term ‘factor VIII inhibition’. Seventeen (17) of these 
27 events were recovered/resolved, and 1 event was recovered/resolved with sequelae. Out of remaining 
9 events, outcome was unknown for 2 events and not recovered/not resolved for remaining 7 events.

Adverse events leading to withdrawal from the trial 
There were 7 AEs in 6 patients that led to withdrawal during the trial. All 7 AEs were severe and possibly 
or probably related to N8-GP. Five (5) events were also SAEs. Two (2) events were related to inhibitor 
development, 2 events were related to antibodies against N8-GP, 1 event was related to lack of efficacy 
from treatment, 1 event was related to increased heart rate, and 1 event was related to drug 
hypersensitivity. 
Medical events of special interest 
Medical events of special interest (MESIs) were presented by standardised MedDRA queries (SMQ) 
categories FVIII inhibitors, hypersensitivity, medication errors, anaphylactic reactions, and 
thromboembolic events (see Section 9.7.2 for details on SMQ categories). There were no MESIs within 
SMQ categories medication errors and anaphylactic reactions. There were a total of 64 MESIs in 43 
patients during main + extension phase, and all were within SMQ categories FVIII inhibitors, 
hypersensitivity, and thromboembolic events. 
A total of 35 MESIs in 32 patients were within SMQ category FVIII inhibitors; 29 MESIs in 26 patients 
were within SOC ‘blood and lymphatic system disorders’ with PT ‘factor VIII inhibition’, while 6 MESIs in 6 
patients were within SOC ‘investigations’ with PT ‘anti factor VIII antibody positive’. 
A total of 26 MESIs in 19 patients were within SMQ category hypersensitivity; 16 MESIs in 13 patients 
were within SOC ‘skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ distributed on 9 different PTs (angioedema, 
dermatitis atopic, dermatitis contact, eczema, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalised, rash maculo-

papular, and urticaria. Another 10 MESIs were distributed on 5 SOCs and 6 PTs (blepharitis allergic, 
conjunctivitis allergic, lip swelling, catheter site rash, drug hypersensitivity, and rhinitis allergic. 
A total of 3 MESIs in 2 patients were within SMQ category thromboembolic events; 1 MESI was within 
SOC ‘injury, poisoning and procedural complications’ and PT ‘shunt occlusion’; 1 MESI was within SOC 
‘product issues’ and PT ‘device occlusion’; 1 MESI was within SOC ‘surgical and medical procedures’ and 
PT ‘central venous catheterisation’. Twenty-eight (28) of the 64 MESIs were also SAEs, including 23 
events alone with PT ‘FVIII inhibition’. 
Clinical laboratory evaluation 
No clinically significant changes were observed for haematology parameters during the trial. 
No clinically significant changes were observed for biochemistry parameters during the trial. 
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
No clinically significant changes over time in vital signs or body measurements were apparent. 
Abnormal physical examination findings generally include findings related to haemophilia A or to 
childhood in general. 
No abnormal changes over time were apparent for body measurements. 
Technical complaints 
There were 4 technical complaints. Two technical complaints were related to missing content or 
functionality of the trial injection kit. No samples were returned for investigation. One technical complaint 
was related to the observation of white flaky slivers in a vial (N8- GP 500 IU/vial, batch number 
FR40065). The product was found normal during subsequent investigations. One technical complaint was 
related to the observation of an already broken vial (N8- GP 2000 IU/vial, batch number HR40835) when 
opening the box with trial product. A handling fault was verified. 
7.3.  Discussion  
Immunogenicity 
Whereas the expected incidence of inhibitor formation in PTPs for FVIII products is usually stated as 
“uncommon” (i.e. frequencies range from 1/1000 to 1/10000), the formation of antibodies in PUPs is a 
major concern for the treatment and thus every PUP requires close monitoring with regards to treatment 
performance and inhibitor development during treatment initiation with FVIII products (see also 
respective GL on the clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor VIII products 
EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev. 2). According to GL “formal PUP studies are not required”, but it is 
agreed with the MAH that the occurrence of inhibitors against FVIII highly depends on the specific product 
at hand and PUPs are at the highest risk to develop a neutralising antibody against exogenous FVIII. 
Therefore, the availability of data regarding antibodies in PUPs is acknowledged. The chosen primary 
endpoint (incidence of FVIII inhibitors) is in line with this argumentation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/125435/2023 
Page 30/32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
According to the EPAR for Esperoct, at the time of authorisation two paediatric patients (<12 years) had 
an unconfirmed positive tests for FVIII inhibitors in trial 3885. However, previously treated patients (as 
investigated in study 3885) do not offer a good comparison with regards to immunogenic events targeted 
against the medication. Calvez et al. (2014) evaluated recombinant FVIII products regarding their 
potential to trigger inhibitor development in PUPs and concluded that 37.6% PUPs develop inhibitors and 
20.8% develop high-titre inhibitors across several tested rFVIII products. During study 3908 26.25% of 
PUPs developed inhibitory antibodies against FVIII (21 of 80 patients) and 13.75% of subjects developed 
high titre inhibitory ABs against FVIII (11 of 80 patients). Thus, incidence of FVIII inhibitor formation for 
Esperoct in PUPs is very common (i.e. frequency ≥1/10 patients), but appears comparable to other 
recombinant FVIII products. According to the provided Kaplan-Meier plots and table 14.3.5.10 (please 
refer to the study report), the majority of FVIII inhibitors developed before ED50, which is in line with the 
expected highest risk during the first 50 EDs as depicted in the GL. It is reported that 52.5% of PUPs had 
anti- N8-GP antibodies, 81% of PUPs had anti-PEG IgG (63.3% developed anti-PEG IgG after exposure to 
Esperoct and 17.7% had anti-PEG IgG at baseline), 27.5% of PUPs had anti-PEG IgM and 8.8% of PUPs 
had anti-CHO HCP antibodies (incidences based on patients with at least one post baseline positive 
antibody test). In total 41.3% of PUPs had anti-drug antibodies against more than one drug moiety (i.e. 
anti N8-GP and anti-PEG). Anti-PEG antibodies (IgG and IgM) were associated with the observed transient 
decrease in IR for a subset of PUPs (see discussion on efficacy for more details). Upon request, the MAH 
clarified that no PTPs were observed with consecutive low IR during trials 3859 and 3885. Also no 
decrease in IR was observed in paediatric PTPs with pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies at baseline. Thus, 
the possible correlation of anti-PEG antibodies and transient low IR appears conclusive only for PUPs. 
Information regarding FVIII inhibitors is reflected in the SmPC section 5.1 (as per SmPC guideline rev.2). 
As patients <12 years are currently not licensed for the treatment with Esperoct, it appears sufficient to 
include a respective statement regarding transient low IR in section 5.1 (as per SmPC guideline rev. 2). 
However, it is noted that potentially reduced IR is an important identified risk that is considered clinically 
very relevant and should be reflected as a warning statement in the SmPC (section 4.4) once a label 
update is submitted to extend the indication to PUPs <6 years. Furthermore, closer monitoring of FVIII 
levels upon treatment initiation with this pegylated FVIII product in PUPs should be evaluated in more 
detail once licensure for paediatric subjects is requested. Information on PUPs is included in sections 4.8 
and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Adverse Events 
The reported AEs for PUPs are mostly single PT events except for FVIII inhibition (23 events in 22 
patients), pneumonia (3 events in 1 patient), head injury (3 events in 3 patients), cerebral haemorrhage 
(2 events in 2 patients), anti-factor VIII antibody positive (2 events in 2 patients) and respiratory failure 
(2 events in 1 patient). The rate of “all AEs” for PUPs in trial 3908 is comparable to the rate as reported 
for previously treated patients of the same age group (<6 years) in the current EPAR (96.3% and 94.1% 
of patients, respectively; Note that study 3908 comprises more subjects and a higher number of exposure 
days). However, the rate of serious AEs appears much higher for PUPs (59.3% and 29.4% of patients, 
respectively) and more PUPs had severs AEs (28.4% and 20.6% of patients, respectively). Also, the rate 
of AEs leading to withdrawal is mildly higher for PUPs (7.4% and 5.9%) of patients, respectively. No 
death is reported for PUPs in study 3908. All MESIs (64 MESIs in 43 patients) were within the SMQ 
categories FVIII inhibitors, hypersensitivity, and thromboembolic events, which is in line with identified 
risks for PTPs. Most of the 80 SAEs in study 3908 were related to PT FVIII inhibition (n=23 events in 
n=22 patients) and one of those events was reported as life threatening. Upon request, the MAH  clarified 
that the higher rate of SAEs in PUPs compared to PTPs can be attributed to the high rate of inhibitor-
related SAEs in PUPs compared to the PTPs and the lower median age of the PUPs from trial 3908 (8 
months) compared to the PTPs from trial 3885 (3 years) of the same age group (<6 years). Information 
Assessment report

regarding FVIII inhibitors in PUPs is reflected in the SmPC section 4.8 even though paediatric patients are 
currently not licensed (as depicted in the core SmPC for human plasma derived and recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII products EMA/CHMP/BPWP/1619/1999 rev. 3 and SmPC guideline rev.2; see 
SmPC; see also assessment of responses in section 11 and 12.).  
Importantly, 5 SAEs were reported for the SOC Nervous system disorder including PTs cerebral 
haemorrhage (2 events in 2 patients) as well as febrile convulsion, seizure and spinal epidural 
haematoma (1 event in 1 patient for each PT). Three of those SAEs in the SOC Nervous system disorders 
were also considered life threatening (2 cerebral haemorrhage and 1 spinal epidural haematoma; in total 
5 serious adverse events were reported as life threatening). In this aspect it should be noted that 
currently a PASS is ongoing to evaluate potential negative effects of Esperoct on brain development in 
subjects <12 years. In line with this, the benefit-risk for this age group was concluded negative during 
initial MAA. The underlying effect is expected to be an accumulation of PEG in the choroid plexus. Thus, 
uncertainty remains if any risks related to long-term exposure to PEGylated FVIII exist. Further details on 
this aspect are expected with results from the ongoing PASS. However, the study at hand cannot provide 
further detail on this aspect, but results from study 3908 further underline the need to await results from 
the ongoing PASS that is addressing potential effects of Esperoct on nervous system development. In 
conclusion, the benefit-risk of Esperoct for subjects <12 years remains negative based on safety 
concerns, also with the available data regarding PUP <6 years.  
7.4.  Direct Healthcare Professional Communication  
The (Co-)Rapporteur’s comments on the DHPC and the draft communication plan are provided below. 
Rapporteurs comment on DHPC: 
A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) is not considered necessary, as no immediate 
changes regarding the safety profile or therapeutic strategy become evident for the evaluated product. 
Requested changes within this type II variation address the principal observation of previously untreated 
subjects <6 years in the scope of a clinical trial, which, however, does not reassure the treatment of 
subjects <12 year. The benefit-risk for Esperoct remains negative for subjects <12 years. A PASS is 
ongoing to address safety concerns in this age group. 
8.  Changes to the Product Information  
As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated to reflect the available 
data on PUPs. The Package Leaflet (PL) is requested to be updated accordingly. 
Comments on updated sections and additional requests are provided directly in the PI document.

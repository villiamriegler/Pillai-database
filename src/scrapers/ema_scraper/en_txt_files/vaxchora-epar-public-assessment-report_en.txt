1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Emergent Netherlands B.V. submitted on 11 January 2019 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Vaxchora, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
The applicant applied for the following indication ‘Vaxchora is indicated for active immunisation against 
disease caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 in adults and children aged 6 years and older. This vaccine 
should be used in accordance with official recommendations.’ 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0381/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0381/2018 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance V. cholerae live attenuated strain CVD 103-HgR contained in 
the above medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.  
Scientific advice 
The Applicant received Scientific Advice on the development of Vaxchora for the prevention of disease caused 
by Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 by the CHMP on 21 February 2013 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/768988/2012 ),  20 
November 2014 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/699798/2014 ) and on 09 November 2017

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease  
Cholera is an acute toxigenic diarrhoeal illness caused by toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae O1. Clinical 
infection with cholera is often mild but can be severe and life-threatening.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Contaminated water supplies are the main source of infection, although raw shellfish, uncooked fruits and 
vegetables and other foods can harbour V. cholerae and therefore also present a risk of infection.  
Although cholera can occur in Europe e.g. via contaminated shellfish, most cholera cases are imported from 
EU nationals travelling to cholera endemic areas. Popular cholera-endemic travel destinations for Europeans 
include countries in Asia (India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines), Africa (Morocco, Tanzania, 
Kenya) and the Caribbean (Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic). These include poverty affected regions with 
poor infrastructure and sanitation.  
Cholera epidemics can also arise sporadically, for example due to flooding following natural disasters such as 
the recent cyclone Idai in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. European travellers to these cholera-affected 
regions include aid workers and military personnel.    
In general, European travellers should be informed about the availability of a cholera vaccine before 
travelling and should follow good personal hygiene practices and drink only bottled water to prevent or 
minimise the risk for Vibrio cholerae infection when residing in endemic areas.  
Globally in 2017, 34 countries reported 227,391 cases and 5,654 deaths (source: WHO). However, due to 
limited diagnostic capability and other factors contributing to underreporting, these figures are considered to 
represent only a small fraction of the actual cholera cases and deaths. Correcting for this underreporting, 
WHO estimates that 1.3-4.0 million cases and 21,000 to 143,000 deaths occur each year around the world.  
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The bacterium Vibrio cholerae is the etiological agent of cholera and humans are its only hosts. Vibrio 
cholerae can be divided into over 200 serogroups, but only serogroups O1 and O139 have been known to 
cause epidemic cholera. The vibrio predominantly associated with epidemic cholera is V. cholerae serogroup 
O1, which is divided into two biotypes, Classical and El Tor, based on genotypic and phenotypic differences. 
Both biotypes contain two major serotypes, Inaba and Ogawa. The Inaba serotype differs from Ogawa by the 
absence of a 2-O-methyl group in the non-reducing terminal sugar of the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) 
component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). During cholera outbreaks the prevalent serotype may switch 
between Ogawa and Inaba. Worldwide, V. cholerae O1 El Tor is currently the predominant biotype. O1 vibrios 
contain an enterotoxin (cholera toxin) which is responsible for causing diarrhoea.  
Cholera toxin (CT), secreted by V. cholerae O1 confers pathogenicity to the organisms. Injection of as little as 
5 µg of purified cholera toxin can elicit severe cholera diarrhoea. The toxin is an 84 kDa polymeric protein 
consisting of two subunits. The A subunit (28 kDa) is responsible for the biological activity of the toxin 
(diarrhoea). It is linked by non-covalent interactions to five identical B subunits (11.5 kDa each). The B 
Assessment report

Page 9/111 
  
  
subunit aids pathogenicity by binding the toxin to receptors on intestinal cell membranes. Since the A subunit 
is surrounded by B subunits, the predominant antitoxin immune response is elicited against the B subunit. 
The A subunit is the enzymatically active portion of the toxin while the B subunit is the immunologically 
dominant portion. After receptor binding by the B subunit, the A subunit is taken up by cells and leads to 
hypersecretion of chloride, bicarbonate and water from epithelial cells into the lumen of the small intestine. 
This results in the characteristic voluminous stool. V. cholerae is also shed in high concentrations in the stool 
of severely ill patients. 
Infection with wild-type V. cholerae provides prolonged protective immunity against subsequent infection. 
Protection against cholera is serogroup specific; hence infection with V. cholerae O1 provides no cross-
protection from cholera caused by V. cholerae O139, and vice versa. The immunity is mediated by local 
mucosal secretory IgA (sIgA) produced in the small intestine, which is the anatomical site of colonization. 
Specifically, sIgA targets both the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) coat of the bacterium and the cholera toxin (CT). 
Antibodies directed against LPS appear to confer more robust protection than those against CT. The anti-LPS 
response is mostly addressed against the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) component of the LPS and may 
mediate protection against V. cholerae via multiple mechanisms including inhibition of motility. 
The presence of naturally acquired serum vibriocidal antibodies (SVA) correlates with protection against 
subsequent cholera infection at both the individual and population level. Also, SVA responses are directed 
primarily against OSP. Recently, plasma antibody responses against OSP have been shown to correlate with 
protection against cholera in household contacts, strengthening the mechanistic link between the SVA 
correlate and the OSP-specific mucosal antibodies that directly mediate protection. In addition, naturally 
acquired peripheral memory B cell responses against OSP have also been shown to correlate with protection. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and management 
Clinical symptoms are usually sufficient to diagnose cholera and begin treatment. However, laboratory 
diagnosis of V. cholerae in stool specimens is required to confirm the presence of cholera, characterise the 
organism, and determine its antibiotic sensitivity pattern. 
Laboratory diagnosis is important in the initial cases, for the purpose of official notification and for monitoring 
the progress of the disease or epidemic. Rapid diagnostic tests kits for detecting V cholerae O1 and O139 are 
available. 
Cholera can be successfully treated with prompt and adequate replacement of lost fluid and electrolytes. 
Individuals with mild and moderate cholera can usually be treated with oral rehydration salts (ORS), pre-
packaged mixtures of glucose and salts mixed with safe drinking water and orally administered. 
Approximately 5% of infected persons will have severe disease (cholera gravis), characterized by profuse 
watery diarrhoea, vomiting and leg cramps. In these people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration 
and pre-renal azotaemia. These individuals typically require intravenous fluid replacement. Without 
treatment, death can occur within hours and mortality rates may exceed 70%. Prompt rehydration 
dramatically reduces cholera mortality; less than 1% of cholera patients may die with appropriate hydration. 
Antibiotics may shorten the course of the diarrhoea and/or diminish the severity of the illness (i.e. the total 
diarrhoeal stool volume), but do not substitute for rapid rehydration.  
In Europe an inactivated cholera vaccine is available for travellers (Dukoral). This contains inactivated V. 
cholerae Classical and El Tor biotypes and the Inaba and Ogawa serotypes for each biotype. In addition, 
recombinant cholera toxin B subunit is also included from V. cholerae O1 Classical Biotype, serotype Inaba.

About the product 
Vaxchora (CVD 103-HgR) consists of live attenuated V. cholerae O1 strain Classical biotype. It is 
administered orally and is therefore expected to induce a local mucosal immune response in the small 
intestine in a similar way to wild type V. cholerae infection. During its previous clinical development, CVD103-
HgR was shown to induce SVA responses as well as intestinal anti-LPS antibodies. 
Based on the above, the proposed mechanism of action of Vaxchora is to induce a broad protective mucosal 
immune response like that induced by natural V. cholerae infection. This response includes induction of 
antigen-specific mucosal antibodies and memory B cells, which can be reliably assessed by measurement of 
SVA. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (FP) is presented as an effervescent powder and powder for oral suspension containing 
not less than 4 x 108 colony forming units- CFU/ dose of V. cholerae live, attenuated strain CVD 103-HgR 
(serotype O1 Inaba) as active substance. 
Other ingredients are: sucrose, ascorbic acid, hydrolysed casein and lactose. The effervescent buffer contains 
sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, ascorbic acid and lactose. 
The product is available in a carton box containing an active substance (AS) sachet (2 g powder) and an 
effervescent buffer sachet (4.5 g powder). The product is intended to be administered by reconstituting the 
buffer contents in 100 ml of cold/ room-temperature non-carbonated bottled drinking water in a cup (water 
and cup not supplied) followed by addition of the active component powder and stirring for 30 seconds, prior 
to oral administration within 15 minutes. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Vaxchora (also referred to as PXVX0200 in the dossier) is a cholera vaccine (recombinant, live, oral), 
containing as active substance 4 x 108 to 2 x 109 viable cells of V. cholerae live, attenuated strain CVD 103-
HgR (produced by recombinant technology). Attenuation is affected by the deletion of a substantial portion of 
the catalytic subunit A of the two copies of the cholera enterotoxin gene (ctxA). A mercury resistance marker 
is inserted within the hemolysin A (hlyA) locus to allow the vaccine strain to be distinguished from the wild-
type V. cholerae O1 Inaba. Vaxchora contains a new active substance, V. cholerae live, attenuated strain CVD 
103-HgR.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing of the active substance takes place at Emergent BioSolutions Berna GmbH, Oberriedstrasse 
68, CH-3174 Thörishaus, Switzerland. The GMP status of all sites involved with manufacture/ testing of the 
AS has been confirmed.

Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance manufacturing process consists of the following process steps: reconstitution of the 
WSL, fermentation, concentration, lyophilisation, milling and curing of the active substance. 
PXVX0200 active substance manufacturing process starts with the thawing of working seed lot vials, followed 
by fed-batch fermentation, then the main culture is harvested and concentrated. The suspension is 
transferred to a mixing tank containing a specified stabilising solution (containing ascorbic acid, sucrose and 
casein hydrolysate). After mixing, the cell suspension is lyophilised. The lyophilisate is milled and cured 
(stabilised) to become the final active substance. The curing step makes it easier to predict the future titre 
and define the quantity of active substance required for further processing. A proportion of the bacteria 
remains alive and this comprises the active substance. Curing is the final step in the active substance 
manufacturing process. Once cured, the active substance is stored in specified storage bottles for long term 
storage under approved conditions. The batch size is defined. No reprocessing is claimed. 
The ranges of critical process parameters and the routine in-process controls along with acceptance criteria, 
including controls for microbial purity and endotoxin, are described for each step. The description of the 
active substance manufacturing process is generally considered acceptable. Exclusion of identity as an in-
process control has been appropriately justified and in process samples collected, ensure deviations from AS 
identity can be investigated.  
Control of materials 
Information on raw materials used in the manufacture of the PXVX0200 master seed lot (MSL), working seed 
lot (WSL) and AS are included and provide adequate assurance of their quality and consistency. For most of 
the raw materials used in manufacture, testing is performed in accordance with pharmacopoeial monographs. 
The non-pharmacopoeial materials are tested according to in-house specifications, which are provided and 
considered appropriate.  
The animal sourced materials used during production are limited to casamino acids and casein acid 
hydrolysate, both derived from bovine milk sourced from New Zealand. The fermentation culture medium 
contains casamino acids and the stabilisation solution contains casein acid hydrolysate (Hy-Case® SF). 
Related BSE/TSE statements are included and deemed to be adequate and also cover manufacture of the 
MSL.  
A general description of the origin and source of the strains used historically to establish the final CVD 103-
HgR is provided in the dossier. The construction of the final CVD 103-HgR from the V. cholerae classical 
Inaba O1 strain 569B, based on allelic exchange strategies, is described and relevant information is included 
regarding the donor organisms for the inserts used in the final construct as well as all plasmids used in the 
process. CVD 103-HgR is defined by two major genetic modifications: 
−  Deletion of the majority (94 %) of the sequence of the cholera toxin A subunit gene (ctxA) from both 
replicons corresponding to the catalytic domain, to remove the toxinogenicity of the vaccine strain. 
CVD 103-HgR retains the ctxB gene and the ability to synthesise the non-toxic B subunit of cholera 
toxin (CTB), which is immunogenic and able to generate neutralising antibodies preventing the toxic 
activity of cholera enterotoxin. 
− 
Insertion of a mercury resistance operon in the hemolysin A gene (hlyA) locus which enables 
differentiation of the vaccine strain from wild type V. cholerae.

The information provided on the approach used for the construction of CVD 103-HgR strain is considered 
sufficient. 
The confirmation of the identity of CVD 103-HgR is based on the analysis of several genotypic and phenotypic 
markers of the strain. Most of these tests are performed as part of the release specifications of the MSL, WSL 
and AS and include appropriate tests for purity, identity, potency and safety.  
The presence of the intended genetic modifications included in CVD 103-HgR is evaluated using PCR and gel 
point assays. These methods are sufficiently presented, and the provided data are considered sufficiently 
robust to confirm the identity of the current CVD 103-HgR MSL and WSL.  
The presented information regarding the manufacture of the MSL and WSL is considered sufficient.  
Relevant specifications have been established for the commercial MSL and WSL. The vials are stored at ≤-
60°C for long term storage and shipping. Stability data on MSL and WSLs are provided and a protocol for 
WSL qualification is included. Related BSE/TSE statements are included and deemed to be adequate. 
Similarity of the PXVX0200 and Orochol/Mutacol vaccines (earlier vaccines manufactured using the same 
construct and not authorised in the EU- see manufacturing development section for AS and FP) was also 
investigated. Additional physicochemical characterisation exercises (based on historical data and relevant 
tests used for the release of MSL/WSL) were performed on several lots of the MSL and WSL.  
Genome sequencing studies confirmed the expected ctxA cholera toxin sequence as well as the presence of 
the mer operon in the interrupted hlyA gene all tested strains. It can be concluded that no genetic 
modifications occurred during the transfer of the parental strain nor during subsequent manufacturing of the 
vaccine active substance. Genetic stability of the construct has therefore been established. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Process parameters for the manufacturing process are provided together with their respective operating set 
points or ranges. The criticality of the parameters was determined based on a risk analysis, which is 
provided. During development, a design of experiments (DoE) approach was used to anticipate potential 
parameter alterations, which might occur during manufacture. This exercise was designed to gain a better 
process understanding and was used to establish the acceptable range of key processes. Failure mode and 
effects analysis (FMEA) was used to identify the critical parameters of the upstream steps and the parameter 
ranges established through development and characterisation studies were validated.  
The definition of critical process parameters is not fully supported since a parameter is considered non-critical 
by the applicant if run at set points or within claimed proven acceptable ranges (PARs), e.g. lyophilisation 
parameters. It is accepted that they do not impact the critical quality attributes (CQA) if within their limits 
but they still have to be controlled to be shown to be within the range that does not impact the CQA and put 
under sufficient regulatory oversight. However, as there are no claims of differences in regulatory action for 
critical vs non-critical attributes and parameters, it is understood that changes to all attributes and 
parameters mentioned in section S.2.2 and S.2.4 will be handled in the same way. With the above 
clarification, the definition of critical process parameters can therefore be accepted. 
Process validation 
The commercial active substance manufacturing process for the PXVX0200 AS has been validated at the 
commercial manufacturing site. The production steps of the AS manufacturing process include: fermentation 
(pre-culture, sub-culture, main culture), stabilisation, lyophilisation and milling (uncured AS), and curing 
(cured AS). There are no viral clearance steps or aseptic processing steps in the PXVX0200 AS production

processes that require specific validation although media hold times validation studies are presented. The 
data and evaluation of the validation study show that all results met the pre-defined acceptance and release 
criteria. 
Three separate commercial-scale lots of PXVX0200 AS were produced using the commercial manufacturing 
process. Critical quality attributes and key performance attributes (KPA) were identified within the criticality 
analysis. Parameters were categorised into non-critical, potentially critical and critical depending on their 
impact on the respective CQAs and KPAs, based on the information available from development studies and 
the current commercial production process of Vaxchora. Ranges for critical process parameters (CPPs) and 
key process parameters (KPPs) were tested within the characterisation studies and multiple analyses were 
performed for the CQAs and KPAs in order to obtain further information on the criticality of the respective 
parameters. 
Based on the results from the characterisation studies, the parameters were re-assessed for criticality and 
when a PAR was successfully shown, a narrower normal operating range (NOR) was defined for the individual 
parameter. In the validation, all parameters were set within their NOR. The goal of the validation was to 
show in three consecutive runs that the Vaxchora fermentation and lyophilisation process is consistent when 
run with parameters within the defined ranges and capable of yielding results fulfilling the acceptance criteria 
for critical quality attributes and key performance attributes. 
Considering the history of the product, including the development studies performed at the transfer to the 
Swiss site and further described below, it is acceptable to build the process validation on development data 
from the US process. The data from the Swiss site show that the transfer/ adaptation of the process at the 
Swiss site has been successful. As mentioned above, the claim that certain steps do not include any critical 
parameters/attributes is not supported but since the parameters and attributes described in the S.2.2 and 
S.2.4 have been included in the validation, even if not considered critical, no further information is needed.  
Manufacturing process development 
The CVD 103-HgR vaccine strain of V. cholerae was generated at the Center for Vaccine Development (CVD) 
at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and was used to produce the (non-EU) marketed vaccine known as 
Orochol/Mutacol Berna. This progenitor strain was later expanded to form the expanded progenitor strain 
which was subsequently used to generate the PXVX0200 MSL. 
The PaxVax active substance process was first developed and manufactured in the USA, including the phase 
3 clinical batches and commercial batches, this is referred to as the “US licensed process”. Preliminary 
feasibility and optimisation studies were performed to evaluate the medium concentrations, cell culture steps, 
harvest, and lyophilisation. The optimised process was transferred to a new site where pilot runs were 
conducted at the fermentation scale and the process was subsequently scaled up to the commercial scale. In 
parallel, several DoE studies were performed to establish the acceptable range of key process operating 
parameters for the fermentation, TFF and lyophilisation unit operations to support a robust and reproducible 
process. FMEA was used to identify the critical parameters of the upstream steps and the acceptable ranges 
of these parameters were verified by two rounds of DoE at small scale. 
The active substance formulation and process were optimised and then transferred to and scaled up at the 
commercial site Emergent BioSolutions Berna GmbH, Switzerland, this process is called the “global process”. 
The optimisation was performed to achieve a finished product storage condition of 2°C to 8°C, the US 
licensed finished product is stored at -20°C. At the same time the manufacturing process was scaled-up. The 
technical transfer demonstrated that the global process is robust and has been successfully transferred to the 
recipient site. Active substance and finished product comparability studies were performed. Several 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 14/111 
  
  
commercial scale active substance batches (including from the US-Licensed, which includes AS used for 
Phase 3 clinical trial material (CTM) manufacturing, and some for the global process) were evaluated for 
comparability. This comparability analysis includes verification of equipment qualification, performance of 
process validation, critical control parameter and critical quality attribute determination and impact analysis 
and, sampling and testing results analysis. The changes implemented in the AS manufacturing process were 
evaluated and found to be comparable and found not to impact product quality and safety. Changes to the 
stabiliser solutions used for Vaxchora compared to Orochol have also been justified. 
Characterisation 
For characterisation of Vaxchora, the applicant has investigated the CVD 103-HgR bacterial strain, deletion of 
a substantial portion of ctxA on both chromosomes and subsequent absence of cholera holotoxin expression, 
the mercury resistance marker inserted within the hemolysin A (hlyA) locus, antibiotic resistance, cell viability 
and expression of cholera toxin B subunit. The results from the characterisation studies confirm the expected 
genomic structure. 
The agglutination assay is used to identify the CVD-103 HgR as V. cholerae O1. Serotype identification is 
based on agglutination in antisera to type-specific O1 antigens. One of the main characteristics of the CVD-
103 HgR is the substantial deletion of the A subunit (ctxA) of the cholera toxin. The deletion in ctxA on both 
chromosomes of the strain is crucial and assessed by PCR. Gene modifications of the strain have to be 
confirmed to guarantee safety of the strain. Another characteristic of the CVD 103-HgR is the insertion of the 
mercury resistance (mer) gene. The presence of the mer operon at the hemolysin gene (hylA) locus is 
verified by PCR. Mer insertion serves as an indication to distinguish the vaccine strain CVD 103-HgR from the 
wild-type 569B strain and does not have any impact on the protective action of the strain. 
The potency of the CVD 103-HgR is determined by viable cell count.  
Wild type V. cholerae strain produces an enterotoxin made up of A and B subunits. CVD-103 HgR produces 
only the B toxin subunit (CTB).  CTB is expressed during fermentation and is present at low levels in the 
active substance. Though these CTB levels are too low to be considered to be immunologically significant, 
CTB is considered clinically relevant as neutralising antibodies to it are claimed by the applicant, to be a part 
of the mechanism of action. Upon request, a AS release test has been included. 
The Y1 adrenal cell assay is used as a safety test to demonstrate the absence of the cholera holotoxin 
(CTAB5). The Y-1 adrenal cells are very sensitive to the presence of enterotoxins from V. cholerae, which can 
be detected by a change of the morphology of the cells (rounding of cells).  
The issue of the number of dead cells in the active substance had not originally been discussed in the 
characterisation part as such. It could not be assured that the vaccine was not working in a dual mode both 
through the live bacteria and the dead. In characterising the seed lots, a test was performed to determine 
the proportion of dead cells in FP and WSL. This is considered to have no impact on the active substance as 
long as the number of live cells in the WSL is sufficient. A flow cytometry assay used for finished product 
characterisation has also been used to bridge the Global Process to the clinical trial material. The amount 
appears also to be consistent between batches. The levels of dead cells are considered much too low to 
present a risk to safety and efficacy with the current manufacturing process/fraction of dead cells in DP. 
However, the company is asked to monitor dead cells following substantial AS manufacturing changes in case 
they were to rise significantly (recommendation).  
No product-related impurities have been identified. No antibiotics are used in the manufacturing process. The 
components in the medium for the fermentation culture include specified, compendial raw, as well as non-
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 15/111 
  
  
compendial raw materials. The medium components are substantially utilised by the bacterial culture during 
fermentation and converted to biomass. The leftover components are present in the active substance since 
there is no purification step in the process. However, these are further decreased when the majority of the 
spent medium is removed by microfiltration prior to addition of the stabilization solution. Further dilution 
occurs at the finished product manufacturing stage (see finished product manufacture section) and are 
considered to be at an acceptable level. The applicant identified cyclohexane and ethanol as possible residual 
solvents. Their limits comply with the ICH requirements. Stated impurities have been studied in nonclinical 
and clinical studies as relevant. Although the clearance of specified elemental impurities from fermentation 
has been well-documented, the applicant should perform a risk assessment for the presence of elemental 
impurities (as per Ph.Eur. monograph on pharmaceutical preparations (2619)) and control the levels of 
elemental impurities using the principles of risk management according to ICH Q3D (recommendation). 
Specification 
The proposed Vaxchora AS specification includes general tests (appearance, moisture), identity tests (PCR 
test for ctxA deletion and presence of hlyA/mer), test for biological activity (viable cell count) and tests for 
purity (microbiological examination and absence of specific organisms). 
The specification tests are considered appropriate and their acceptance criteria are appropriate.  
The applicant has provided justification for the proposed acceptance criteria. The AS potency criteria are 
appropriate and ensures the AS maintains acceptable potency throughout the shelf-life. For the moisture 
content, a specification limit has been proposed using US produced clinical batches. Using these batches is 
considered justified.  
Analytical methods 
Vaxchora AS is tested using non-compendial methods. Overall, appropriate descriptions are provided for all 
methods. All analytical procedures used for control of the Vaxchora AS have been validated and validation 
reports are included in the dossier. The inclusion of a second potency assay to harmonise AS and FP potency 
testing is acceptable.  For the potency (viable cell count method), a sample of active substance is 
reconstituted in 100 mL cooled aqueous buffer finished product (ABFP). The ABFP is prepared by diluting a 
packet of buffer finished product in 100 mL chilled water for injection. The determination of the number of 
CFUs is carried out by serial dilution of the reconstituted sample and inoculated onto specified agar plates. 
After incubation of the plates, the CFU are counted. Appropriate positive and negative controls are in place. 
Batch analysis 
Batch information details for AS (including their use) and analytical results of the three validation batches are 
provided which were manufactured according to the commercial process and scale. The AS batches were 
manufactured according to the validated manufacturing process at the commercial site and were released 
according to the commercial specification using validated analytical methods. 
Reference materials 
There are no reference standards for Vaxchora. Different lots of Vaxchora reference material are used. The 
description of the use of reference standards is considered acceptable. The qualification of future lots 
described above is referenced to a master specification and annual re-qualification is conducted. For the 
standard used in the viable cell count potency assay, a suitable qualification protocol has been submitted.

Container closure 
The active substance primary container closure system consists of specified square bottles with screw caps. 
The containers are then placed in stainless steel barrels for protection during storage. The container/closure 
system comply with European requirements and an identity test of the material is performed by the 
applicant. The assessment of risks arising from leachables and extractables as a result of the use of polymer 
materials that get in contact with the product during production, packaging, and storage has been provided.    
Stability 
A shelf-life and storage conditions were proposed for the AS. 
Stability studies are ongoing at long-term and accelerated conditions, in line with ICH guidelines, for several 
batches of AS stored in a reduced volume container closure system (the type mentioned in section 3.2.S.6, 
the commercial bottles). Some of these batches are characterisation batches and three are process validation 
batches. All of these AS batches were manufactured at full commercial scale with the commercial process at 
the commercial site and were subsequently processed into FP.  
Stability data for process validation lots are available. Stability data for the characterisation batches are used 
to set the active substance expiry, which is acceptable since they are representative of the same 
manufacturing process, testing and packaging as the process validation batches. The AS release and stability 
requirements are the same. All AS batches met stability acceptance criteria when stored at the long-term 
condition. For accelerated conditions, AS met the stability criteria for up to eight weeks. All of the stability 
studies are still ongoing. 
The overall strategy and design of the stability studies are considered acceptable. Based on available data, 
the company’s shelf-life proposal and storage conditions for the active substance is endorsed.

The vaccine finished product consists of a co-package of a vaccine and buffer sachet. The vaccine powder for 
reconstitution is contained in a single-dose, multilayer (four-ply multilayer foil containing an outer layer of 
paper, a layer of low-density polyethylene, a layer of aluminium foil and an inner layer of low-density 
polyethylene) sachet. The separate buffer powder is contained in a single-dose, multilayer (three-ply 
multilayer foil containing an outer layer of paper, middle layer of aluminium foil and an inner layer of low-
density polyethylene) sachet. For the primary container closure system, the packet foil contains no animal 
derived components except for the lubricant component linear low-density polyethylene film (finished product 
contact). The lubricant is based on substances that are derived from animal fats (tallow). These substances 
are approved for food-contact use. The production of these additives is subject to very severe processing 
conditions that meet or exceed the recommendations for complete inactivation of TSE agents. The 
reconstitution procedure requires dissolution of the buffer in 100 mL of bottled water, followed by addition of 
the vaccine powder and mixing. The reconstituted vaccine is administered orally after reconstitution.

Two excipients of animal origin are present in the finished product. Both the casein acid hydrolysate (Hy-Case 
SF) and lactose are derived from bovine milk. Specifications for all excipients used (except for Hy-Case SF) 
conform to the respective Ph. Eur. monograph. Casein is derived from milk fit for human consumption and 
complies with the relevant EU TSE guidance. The final product does not contain novel excipients. All 
excipients with the exception of the lactose are actually incorporated during the manufacture of the AS. 
Lactose is added during the blending step during the preparation of the bulk finished product. 
The applicant has acceptably described the composition of the finished product. The pharmaceutical 
development has been thoroughly described. The composition of the finished product intended for the EU 
market (global process) is based on the US-licensed version produced by PaxVax which in turn is based on 
the composition of Orochol/Mutachol licensed outside of the EU in the late 90ies. No initial formulation 
development studies were conducted for this reason, for the US licensed product. The presentation and route 
of administration are the same as Orochol: a vaccine packet and a buffer packet which are reconstituted in 
water prior to oral administration. As part of the technical transfer and commercial scale-up for the global 
process, one of the key objectives was to produce a vaccine that was also stable at 2°C to 8ºC long term 
storage condition while the US product was stored at -20 ºC. The formulation components listed for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020

global vaccine are the same as the US-licensed product with the exception of the removal of the sodium 
chloride component and the replacement of the dried lactose excipient with anhydrous lactose. 
There is no formulation overage used for the PXVX0200 finished product. Buffer pH is another critical 
parameter affecting the biological activity of the PXVX0200 vaccine after reconstitution. V. cholerae is a very 
acid-labile organism and it has been shown (in literature) that administration of buffer to neutralise stomach 
acid reduces the dose of V. cholerae required to establish infection in volunteers. It has also been shown in 
literature, that persons with impaired gastric acid production may be predisposed to infection with V. 
cholerae. The buffer formulation was adopted from the buffer used in the studies of Orochol. In order to 
maintain viability of the live PXVX0200 vaccine bacteria, the buffer has a pH range of 6.9 ± 0.2. At higher 
pH, the viability of the bacteria will start to decline therefore the FP is reconstituted in the buffer solution to 
maintain stability at the time of preparation. The buffer also neutralises the stomach acidity of the recipient, 
facilitating the passage of viable bacteria through the stomach and into the intestinal tract, where they 
replicate and induce the desired immune response. Studies have been provided to justify the feasibility of the 
reconstitution procedure as described in the SmPC. 
The effect of chlorine in bottled water was investigated on the vaccine potency. Chlorination is one of the 
most widely used methods to control microbial growth in water sources. Chlorine is very effective at 
inactivating V. cholerae, with the capacity to inactivate 100 % of the bacteria in less than 30 seconds at 
dilute concentration (0.5 ppm). The buffer that is used to reconstitute the vaccine is formulated with ascorbic 
acid (1.5 g to 1.8 g per dose), which effectively neutralises chlorine. The vaccine is stable for 30 minutes at 
chlorine concentrations greater than recommended by the WHO for drinking water. 
Manufacturing changes 
For the US-licensed process, the finished product manufacturing process starts with the curing step of the 
active substance. For the global process the curing step is considered part of the active substance and the 
finished product manufacturing step starts with the premix. There are some further changes,  particular use 
of anhydrous lactose instead of dried lactose, different blending equipment and pre-mix with lactose. The 
anhydrous lactose used for the global Vaxchora process is far less hygroscopic than dried lactose. Thus, 
anhydrous lactose is better able to protect the product from excessive water uptake during open 
manufacturing steps. New larger blending equipment is employed for the global process. This change is 
considered to be a like for like replacement, given that both mixers function along the same principal. Both 
are diffusion mixers. It was believed that splitting the blending of AS with lactose in two steps at such a large 
scale, by the inclusion of a pre-mix step, would better ensure a homogeneous final bulk finished product 
(BFP).  
The clinical studies have been performed with the US material. A number of commercial scale finished 
product lots (several for the US-Licensed, which includes Phase 3 CTM and commercial lots, and some for the 
global process) were evaluated for comparability. This comparability analysis included verification of 
equipment qualification, performance of process validation, critical control parameter and critical quality 
attribute determination and impact analysis, and sampling and testing results analysis. Overall the quality 
improvements implemented in the FP manufacturing process were evaluated in this comparability report and 
the material produced pre- and post-modification was found to be comparable. These modifications were 
deemed not to negatively impact product quality and safety. The impact of the changes continues to be 
monitored under the stability program to ensure maintenance of the expected improvement in quality. No 
further action is required beyond continuance of the ongoing stability studies.

Microbial attributes 
PXVX0200 is not considered to be a sterile product. An orally-administered live bacterial vaccine such as 
PXVX0200 should not be required to meet a sterility standard, since it is not possible to have any inactivation 
steps in the process. Furthermore, the vaccine is not intended to be delivered to a severely 
immunosuppressed population and the human digestive tract is designed to inactivate most types of 
organisms which are routinely ingested with food. Similarly, the human digestive tract is designed to 
accommodate the presence of endotoxins. However, it is important that particular organisms that do 
represent a potential risk for infection via the alimentary tract are specifically excluded from the vaccine 
finished product, and that the bioburden level of the vaccine is controlled below specific limits. The absence 
of these specified organisms is tested for each batch. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
PXVX0200 vaccine finished product manufacturing, packaging, testing and batch control sites are specified in 
the dossier. Importation of the finished product and batch release into the EEA is the responsibility of IL-CSM 
GmBH, Marie-Curie-Str. 8, 79539 Loerrach, Germany. Suitable GMP documentation has been provided for all 
sites. 
The manufacturing process for PXVX0200 finished product  involves three primary unit operations: 1) 
premixing of the AS with a portion of lactose to form the premix, 2) followed by blending of the premix with 
the additional lactose to form the BFP, 3) and then filling the BFP into multi-layer foil packets. The batch size 
is specified.  
Hold times for the premix and the BFP have been submitted, supporting the proposed storage times, 
respectively. 
The description of the manufacturing process is acceptable and includes appropriate in-process controls, 
critical and non-critical process parameters. A similar risk assessment as performed for the AS has been 
performed for the FP as well. The criticality assessment has been properly described and the outcome is 
agreed. Process validation for the PXVX0200 FP manufacturing process was completed at the commercial 
manufacturing facility. A suitable number of batches of PXVX0200 AS were successfully processed through 
the premix, blending and filling manufacturing steps. 
The production operations were performed per approved and effective procedures and batch records. Critical 
and non-critical control and monitoring parameters for the manufacturing process steps were confirmed to 
operate according to defined set points and within the defined parameter limits for the lots. As there are no 
claims of differences in regulatory action for critical vs non-critical attributes and parameters, it is understood 
that changes to all attributes and parameters mentioned in section S.3.3 and S.3.4 will be handled in the 
same way.  
Test results for the lots produced confirmed that the material produced met defined specifications for product 
quality. Deviations generated during production of the validation lots were resolved successfully with no 
impact to the lot produced. 
Product specification 
The specification for PXVX0200 FP contains appropriate tests for identity, potency, purity and 
physicochemical attributes. The FP specification is based on characterisation, development, stability data and 
lots produced for clinical and commercial, as well as consideration of the applicable guidelines (e.g., ICH, 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 20/111 
  
  
USP, Ph. Eur.). Most of the data used to develop the specifications were derived from the FP batches 
manufactured with the US-licensed process. Some specifications have been tightened upon request, during 
the procedure. The potency limit is clinically justified. There are no additional process-related impurities in 
the manufacturing and filling of the PXVX0200 FP.  There are no product-related impurities introduced during 
finished product manufacture. Although the clearance of specified elemental impurities from fermentation has 
been well-documented, the applicant should perform a risk assessment for the presence of elemental 
impurities (as per Ph.Eur. monograph on pharmaceutical preparations (2619)) and control the levels of 
elemental impurities using the principles of risk management according to ICH Q3D (recommendation). 
Analytical methods 
All analytical procedures used for control of the PXVX0200 finished product (FP) have been validated for their 
intended purpose. The compendial methods for residual moisture and uniformity of mass was verified for 
suitability for use.  
Batch analysis 
Three FP lots were manufactured according to the validated commercial manufacturing process at commercial 
scale at PaxVax Berna and were released according to the current specification at the time using validated 
analytical methods. The acceptance criteria were fulfilled for all batches. There are no additional process-
related impurities in the manufacturing and filling of the FP. All identified impurities from AS have been 
present in product studied in trials. 
Container closure system 
Finished product is filled into packets (60 mm x 90 mm) made from a four-ply multilayer foil. Each vaccine 
packet contains a single-dose (two grams) of vaccine finished product. The materials of construction for each 
layer of the four-ply multilayer foil packet and their corresponding functions, and manufacturer’s specification 
have been listed. This foil was selected because it is designed to be impervious to light and to prevent the 
ingress of moisture. Vaccine packets are packed into secondary cartons. The documentation submitted is 
considered sufficient and the four-ply multilayer foil complies with European food contact regulations. The 
compatibility of vaccine drug product and its container closure has been evaluated and will continue to be 
assessed in drug product long-term stability studies.  
Stability of the product 
Based on the stability study a shelf life of 18 months at 2–8 °C is proposed. 
Stability studies, in accordance with ICH guidelines, are ongoing for three lots of finished product (FP) 
manufactured for process characterisation which are representative of the final process and scale, and three 
lots of finished product manufactured for process validation. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines1, any 
confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and 
EMA. 
Stability studies for the characterisation and validation lots are being evaluated in a 36 months stability study 
and 18 months data have been reported. The results have met the proposed commercial specification and 
stability requirements in general. With this, the proposed shelf life of 18 months when stored under 
refrigerated conditions, can be accepted. A photostability study was not performed because the finished 
1 .32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the European Union 
Assessment report

Page 21/111 
  
  
 
product is heat-sensitive and photostability conditions (i.e. heat from the light source) would negatively bias 
the results of any such study.  
To cover potential quality aspects related to self-medication of the vaccine, further stability studies have been 
submitted. A stability study was performed to evaluate the impact on potency when the vaccine is removed 
from the refrigerator prior to reconstitution at 25°C, 30°C, and 32°C, and the long term stability of Vaxchora 
sachets placed at 25°C and put on long-term stability at 2-8°C.  
From the data submitted, it appears that the levels seen following 3x 8 h or 1x12 hours of exposure to 25 °C 
respectively of the un-reconstituted vaccine, compares to the levels of the reference stored at 2-8°C. 
Therefore, a storage period of up to 12 hours at 25 °C could be acceptable. It is also shown that 
reconstituted vaccine is stable for 30 minutes at room temperature (no decrease seen in titre). These data 
would support the stability at the recommended excursions at 25°C even for samples having reached the 
plateau close to the expiry date. As a safety precaution the time allowed from reconstitution to drinking the 
vaccine is limited to not more than 15 minutes as this minimises the risk linked to self-medication in that the 
administration is not interrupted. The SmPC has been updated accordingly. 
The storage temperature recommended is 25 °C (after removing from the refrigerator and after 
reconstitution). The data demonstrate that if the exposure to 25 °C is limited to what is proposed, an 
acceptable dose can be guaranteed throughout the shelf life. It is noted that stability at 30 and 32 °C is 
poorer. It is expected that temperatures during summertime in certain parts of Europe may exceed 25 °C 
and the recommendation based on the 25 °C data may not be fully applicable. The current description of 
reconstitution indicates that the buffer should be mixed with cold or room tempered bottled water no higher 
than 25 °C. The following instructions have been added to the SmPC to ensure product potency is assured at 
point of use: 
To prepare the vaccine for administration the Vaxchora active and buffer component sachets are removed 
from the refrigerator for no more than 12 hours at 25°C prior to reconstitution. 
It is important to mix the sachets in the order described. First, the contents of the buffer sachet 1 (a white-
to-off-white powder) are mixed with 100 mL of cold or room temperature (≤25°C) bottled non-carbonated 
drinking water in a cup. Second, the contents of the active component sachet 2 (a white-to-beige powder) 
are then added and the mixture is stirred for at least 30 seconds. The reconstituted vaccine forms a slightly 
cloudy suspension that may contain some white particulates. The dose should be administered within 15 
minutes of reconstitution. 
Note: if the sachets are reconstituted in the incorrect order, the vaccine must be discarded. 
An 18 month shelf-life at 2–8 °C for the (un-reconstituted) vaccine finished product is acceptable. This is also 
the agreed overall shelf-life. 
It is noted that vaccine sachet and buffer sachet have different shelf lives (18 months and 36 months 
respectively-see finished product-buffer section). However, in line with the QRD template on the SmPC 
(section 6.3) only one overall shelf life for the finished product is to be given in the product information 
(which is 18 months in this case) even if different components of the product have a different shelf life. The 
SmPC, package leaflet and outer carton for Vaxchora will state the overall shelf-life. However, the buffer 
sachet could reflect its individual expiry date (36 months).

Potential Reconstitution Errors 
A study was performed to re-verify the impact of the vaccine reconstitution preparation on potency of the 
active component. A study was conducted to evaluate if varying water volumes for reconstituting the buffer 
and vaccine would impact potency, where the vaccine was reconstituted as instructed except for the amounts 
of bottled water 50, 100 (control), and 150 mL used for reconstitution of the buffer. The potency was 
evaluated over time and remained within the potency acceptance criterion when the starting potency was 
above 1 x 109 CFU/dose. 
With reference to the issue of potential reconstitution errors, the presented data indicate that Vaxchora 
potency remains within the acceptance criteria following variations in reconstitution volume, reconstitution 
order (adding active substance sachet at the same time as the buffer sachet) and incomplete emptying of 
active substance sachet. It is agreed that these data support self-administration, with respect to potential 
reconstitution error. 
2.2.4.  Finished Medicinal Product- Buffer, Effervescent powder 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The buffer for Vaxchora consists of ascorbic acid, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate and anhydrous 
lactose. See Table 3 for the composition of the buffer component.

Documentation was originally provided for the US manufactured buffer which is actually supportive for the 
information provided during the MAA procedure, for the buffer manufactured at the commercial site 
(commercial FP). The production of the buffer had been transferred from the US to the global manufacturing 
site. The applicant has clarified that the US buffer will not be used in commercial batches of Vaxchora.   
The applicant has provided the following information on the difference between the buffers manufactured at 
the two sites. For the composition of the buffer, the non-compendial dried lactose has been replaced with 
anhydrous lactose (Ph.Eur quality). Furthermore, the buffer finished product long term storage condition has 
been changed from -20°C to 5°C. The controls for the buffer are the same as for the US buffer. Sufficient 
justification has been provided for certain specifications that become in-process tests for the global process. 
A buffer comparability plan has been submitted describing the process changes made between the Vaxchora 
US-licensed and global process in order to identify and evaluate the potential impact of the changes to 
product quality and safety. The buffer formulation for PXVX0200 finished product was adapted from buffer 
used for the Orochol CVD 103-HgR vaccine; therefore, limited formulation development studies were 
conducted. The US manufactured buffer was used for all three Phase 3 clinical trials which evaluated 
PXVX0200.

The vaccine is acid labile and needs to be protected from stomach acid during administration. Based on 
historical information from Orochol, a pH of <5 during and/or after administration of the vaccine results in 
inactivation of the bacteria; therefore, the amount of 1M HCl required to change from pH from 6.9 ± 2 to pH 
5 is tested, for acid neutralisation, based on USP<301>. Adequate pH during administration and passage into 
the stomach is assured.  
Several BFP lots and (including PaxVax US Phase 3 CTM lots, Vaxchora US-licensed lots and PaxVax Berna 
validation lots) have been evaluated for comparability. An acceptable comparability report has been provided. 
A suitable compatibility study has been performed between the commercial buffer and active (vaccine) 
components showing that the vaccine is stable for at least 30 minutes in non-carbonated purified bottled and 
bottled spring waters, however the recommended time allowed from reconstitution to drinking the vaccine is 
15 minutes to minimise the risk for interruption of administration. Buffer is filled into packets made from a 
three-ply multilayer foil. Each packet contains a single-dose of buffer. The materials of construction for each 
layer of the three-ply multilayer foil packet, their corresponding functions and manufacturer’s specification 
have been provided. The four-ply multilayer foil complies with relevant EU/ Ph.Eur requirements. The foil 
contains no animal derived components except for a component utilized in the production of the polyethylene 
film which uses an additive which is derived from animal fats (tallow). See the adventitious agents section. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Sufficient documentation has been provided in the updated dossier on the manufacture of the buffer and 
process control. The manufacturing process for the buffer, including the controlled process parameters, is 
therefore suitably described.  
Product specification 
The applicant has provided satisfactory full documentation on the buffer specifications in the updated dossier. 
The buffer specification is based on the US Licensed product and has been adapted for the Global Vaxchora 
Process and includes appropriate specifications for identity, content, safety and physicochemical attributes. The 
specification  is  based  on  manufacturing  and  stability  data  collected  during  development,  as  well  as 
consideration of applicable guidelines (e.g. ICH, Ph. Eur., USP). 
Batch analysis 
The analytical results for a suitable number of buffer FP process validation lots were provided. These were 
manufactured according to the commercial manufacturing process and were released according to the 
specification at the time using validated analytical procedures. The data are acceptable. Analytical methods 
are described and validation data provided, as appropriate. There are no reference standards or materials for 
Buffer finished product. This is acceptable. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 36 months for the buffer FP when stored at 5°C is proposed. 
The applicant has provided stability data on a suitable number of process validation lots of buffer finished 
product (BFP) manufactured at the commercial scale and packaged into multi-layer foil packets. These lots 
have been monitored at the long-term storage conditions at 5°C ± 3°C (5°C) and satisfactory results are 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 24/111 
  
  
provided up to 12 months. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines2, any confirmed out-of-specification result, 
or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Based on supportive stability data from lots manufactured at another site and lots manufactured with the US 
licensed process, a 36 month shelf-life at 5°C is considered acceptable. It is noted that vaccine sachet and 
buffer sachet have different shelf lives (18 months and 36 months respectively). However in line with the 
QRD template on the SmPC (section 6.3) only one overall shelf life for the finished product is to be given in 
the product information (which is 18 months in this case) even if different components of the product have a 
different shelf life. The SmPC, package leaflet and outer carton for Vaxchora will state the overall shelf-life. 
However, the buffer sachet could reflect its individual expiry date (36 months).  
Adventitious agents 
PXVX0200 is not considered to be a sterile product. It is not possible to have any inactivation steps in the 
process for a live bacterial vaccine. Furthermore, the vaccine is not intended to be delivered to a severely 
immunosuppressed population, and the human digestive tract is designed to inactivate most types of 
organisms which are routinely ingested with food. Similarly, the human digestive tract is designed to 
accommodate the presence of endotoxins. However, it is important that particular organisms that do 
represent a potential risk for infection via the alimentary tract are specifically excluded from the vaccine 
finished product, and that the bioburden level of the vaccine is controlled below specific limits. The PXVX0200 
manufacturing process has controls in-place to limit the bioburden present in the product.  These controls 
are: 
−  raw material selection, control and testing 
−  manufacturing procedures and facility controls 
−  testing performed on cell banks, product intermediates, AS and FP. 
The materials of animal origin used in the manufacturing process are casamino acids, casein acid hydrolysate 
(Hy-Case SF), lactose and packet foil. For the primary container closure system, the packet foil contains a 
lubricant component (finished product contact) which is derived from animal fats (tallow). These substances 
are approved for food-contact use. The production of these additives is subject to very severe processing 
conditions that meet or exceed the recommendations for complete inactivation of TSE agents. The 
manufacturer of this material has declared it safe according to European regulations laid out in Table 1, 
Section 3.2.P.7. The BSE/TSE statement is provided. 
Raw materials are assessed for their ability to introduce non-viral adventitious agents, such as bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy / transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (BSE/TSE). BSE/TSE statements for 
the raw materials have been provided. Lactose is tested to ensure acceptable microbiological limits. Steam 
sterilisation of culture media and sterile filtration of culture additives to remove adventitious bacteria and 
fungi provide additional assurance regarding the purity of the final product. The provided documentation is 
acceptable. Justifications why no TSE certification is needed for the animal derived components have been 
submitted. 
Sufficient information has been presented to give reassurance on adventitious agent safety.

GMO 
The genetically modified CVD 103-HgR strain was generated from the V. cholerae classical Inaba O1 strain 
569B, based on allelic exchange strategies. CVD 103-HgR is defined by two major genetic modifications: 
-  Deletion of the majority (94 %) of the sequence of the cholera toxin A subunit gene (ctxA) from both 
replicons corresponding to the catalytic domain, to remove the toxinogenicity of the vaccine strain. 
CVD 103-HgR retains the ctxB gene and the ability to synthesise the non-toxic B subunit of cholera 
toxin (CTB), which is immunogenic and able to generate neutralising antibodies preventing the toxic 
activity of cholera enterotoxin.  
- 
Insertion of a mercury resistance operon in the hemolysin A gene (hlyA) locus which enables 
differentiation of the vaccine strain from wild type V. cholerae. 
Please refer to the non-clinical environmental risk assessment (ERA) for genetically modified organism (GMO) 
evaluation. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The product is provided as a dual pack of two sachets, one with vaccine and stabilisers and one with 
effervescent buffer to be dissolved in water. The submitted dossier describes in great detail the manufacture, 
control and stability of the active substance and vaccine finished product. Thorough reports from validation 
studies and manufacturing development have been provided supporting the proposed manufacturing process 
and control strategy. Following a request in the initial assessment, acceptable updates to most attributes 
tested in-process or at active substance or finished product have been introduced. As regards the 
effervescent buffer the manufacture has recently been transferred to the commercial site and validation data 
and results from routine control and stability studies were initially missing. Full documentation was 
subsequently provided for the buffer in the updated dossier. This issue was considered a major objection 
since important information was missing; however, the issue is now considered solved. All of the questions 
have now been adequately addressed by the applicant. 
Two recommendations are made:  
• 
The issue of the number of dead cells in the active substance has not been discussed in the 
characterisation part as such. It could not be assured that the vaccine was not working in a dual 
mode both through the live bacteria and the dead. Further to investigations, the results show that the 
fraction of dead cells present in the FP is much lower (approximately 5 %) than in the WSL. The 
amount appears also to be consistent between batches. The levels of dead cells are then considered 
much too low to present a risk to safety and efficacy with the current manufacturing process/fraction 
of dead cells in DP. However, the company is asked to monitor dead cells following substantial AS 
manufacturing changes in case they were to rise significantly (recommendation).  
•  Although the clearance of specified elemental impurities from fermentation has been well-
documented, the applicant should perform a risk assessment for the presence of elemental impurities 
(as per Ph.Eur. monograph on pharmaceutical preparations (2619)) and control the levels of 
elemental impurities using the principles of risk management according to ICH Q3D. 
(recommendation).

2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented to 
give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Vaxchora is a live attenuated bacterial vaccine containing the CVD 103-HgR vaccine strain of Vibrio cholera 
(V. cholerae) serogroup O1, biotype classical, serotype Inaba. V. cholera is a strictly human pathogen. 
Cholera bacilli do not colonize or replicate in healthy adult animals. Relevant animal models are not available 
to assess safety, efficacy via live cholera challenge, or predict the immune response to a live attenuated 
cholera vaccine such as Vaxchora. The applicant has therefore not performed any non-clinical animal 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics or toxicology studies with Vaxchora.  
Extensive clinical safety data are available from the historical studies conducted with the previously marketed 
CVD 103-HgR Orochol, a total of 3,563 individuals to date who received Vaxchora during clinical 
development, and safety experience from 55,808 doses distributed up to June 30, 2018 in the US during the 
post-marketing phase of Vaxchora. Based on the large amount of data available in humans and lack of 
specific safety or efficacy concerns, the CHMP deemed that non-clinical studies are not needed for this 
vaccine.  
Relevant non-clinical data from the scientific literature were submitted by the Applicant and are summarised 
in this section.

EMA/82271/2020

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Mice were given an intraperitoneal (IP) dose of 108 CFU of CVD103-HgR, followed by challenge with cholera 
toxin (CT). IP immunization was chosen as the route of administration since only mice less than 7 days old 
are susceptible to oral infection with V. cholera. Immunized mice in groups of 10 were given 1, 2.25 or 3 
LD50 doses of CT administered IP, and were then observed for 7 days. All of the mice survived CT doses of 1 
and 2.25 LD50, and 70% of mice survived a CT dose of 3 LD50. Control mice in groups of 8, given only 
phosphate buffered saline, were less protected following CT challenge of 1, 2.25, and 3 LD50, i.e., 50%, 
12%, and 0% survival, respectively (Dragunsky 1992). 
CVD103-HgR has been used as a vaccine vector to deliver other antigens by oral administration in rabbits. 
One study evaluated administration of CVD103-HgR (pInt248), which expressed intimin, an outer membrane 
antigen of E. coli. Immunized rabbits produced anti-intimin antibodies and showed moderate protection from 
enteropathogenic E. coli challenge (Keller 2010). A similar study explored the protective immunity afforded 
by CVD103-HgR (pDA60) expressing a Shiga-like toxin I B subunit antigen. All rabbits developed neutralizing 
antibodies against Shiga-like toxin I (Acheson 1996). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics studies are generally not required for vaccines, in line with available guidelines.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The only animal models of cholera disease are infant rabbits (Ritchie 2010), infant mice (Taylor 1987, Klose 
2000), rabbits that have been surgically modified using ligated ileal loops (Formal 1961), adult mice with 
ligated ileal loops (Sawasvirojwong 2013) or the Removable Intestinal Tie-Adult Rabbit (RITARD) model 
(Pierce 1988, Dziejman 2005, Russell 1992, Morris 1990). None of these models are suitable for toxicology 
studies. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are not required based on the type of product and in line with 
current guidelines on non-clinical evaluation of vaccines. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Vaxchora contains genetically modified organisms (GMOs). These can be introduced into the environment via 
faeces (due to shedding), accidental spilling and unconsumed residues. An environmental risk assessment 
was performed according to the relevant guidelines, and no risk to the environment was identified. 
V. cholerae does not survive well in dry conditions such as on fabric, paper, plastic and metal surfaces and 
dies off within a few days (Felsenfeld 1965). Vaxchora is required to be transported in refrigerated conditions 
and stored in a refrigerator because may loses its potency if left at room temperature for extended periods. A 
study performed to evaluate the persistence of high concentrations of Vaxchora on stainless steel surfaces at 
room temperature in the manufacturing facility (CH-SYR-55-01) showed the bacterial concentration was 
substantially reduced after 3 days. The Vaxchora sachet contains a maximum of 2 x 109 CFU. Any release of 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 28/111 
  
  
the bacteria into the environment would therefore be negligible, with a short survival time. No risk to the 
environment was identified during the preparation of the environmental risk assessment. Notwithstanding, 
the package leaflet provides instructions regarding clean up and disposal of the unused medicine, and also 
contains information regarding faecal shedding of vaccine bacteria and the need to exercise good hygiene in 
the period after taking Vaxchora. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant has not performed any non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic or toxicological studies with 
Vaxchora. The main reason is that Cholera bacilli do not colonize or replicate in healthy adult animals, making 
it difficult to perform relevant non-clinical studies. Relevant non-clinical data from the literature has been 
assessed.  
Further, clinical experience with CVD103-HgR is sufficient to characterize the safety profile of Vaxchora. 
Vaxchora has been on the market in the US since June 2016, and safety data is available from over 50,000 
distributed doses. Further, more than 3,000 individuals have received Vaxchora during clinical development. 
In addition, clinical data has also been gathered for CVD103-HgR when the vaccine was marketed under the 
name Orochol.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In view of the substantial amount of clinical safety data with CVD103-HgR, and lack of appropriate animal 
models for pharmacology and safety assessment, the omission of non-clinical studies is considered 
adequately justified. No risk to the environment was identified. Nevertheless, since Vaxchora is a GMO, the 
waste should be disposed of according to the recommendations provided in order to minimize any potential 
risks to the environment.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies are usually not required for vaccines (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005 – Guideline on 
clinical evaluation of new vaccines). Vaxchora (PXVX0200) is a live attenuated bacterial vaccine. No 
pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Vaxchora contains live attenuated cholera bacteria (V. cholerae O1 classical Inaba strain CVD 103-HgR) that 
replicate in the gastrointestinal tract of the recipient and induce serum vibriocidal antibody and memory B 
cell responses. Immune mechanisms conferring protection against cholera following receipt of Vaxchora have 
not been determined, however, rises in serum vibriocidal antibody 10 days after vaccination with Vaxchora 
were associated with protection in a human challenge study. 
According to the Guideline on clinical evaluation of new vaccines (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005), 
pharmacodynamic studies for vaccines are essentially comprised of the immunogenicity studies that 
characterise immune responses to the vaccine. This section will therefore focus on the bioanalytical methods 
used for evaluating the immunogenicity endpoints in the Vaxchora clinical trials. The trials are discussed in 
the Efficacy section of this report. 
The serum vibriocidal antibody assay (SVA) 
The serum vibriocidal antibody (SVA) assays for all Classical Inaba, El Tor Inaba, Classical Ogawa and El Tor 
Ogawa are validated functional assays that involved complement-mediated bacteriolysis and were used to 
measure vibriocidal antibody levels in serum. The SVA assay detected mainly IgM antibodies, which 
correspond mainly to de novo immune responses. Briefly, serial dilutions of serum were mixed and incubated 
at 37˚C with equal volumes of standardized V. cholerae (including guinea pig complement). Titres were 
expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution of the most diluted sample associated with bacterial growth of 
75% or less compared with the negative control. To achieve validation of the assay, intra- and inter-assay 
precision, accuracy/dilutability, specificity, sample stability, and robustness were evaluated.  
The cholera toxin (CT) ELISA assay  
The CT ELISA assay measured serum antibodies against cholera toxin. It is a validated ELISA assay specific 
for detecting IgG antibodies, which are usually induced approximately 2 weeks after exposure to antigen.  
Briefly, samples were serially diluted from 1:200 to 1:12,800 in duplicate. Following incubation on CT coated 
wells, antibodies to CT are detected with a peroxidase labelled goat anti-human IgG and a 
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate. The titre is equal to the reciprocal of the dilution of the least diluted 
sample with an OD450 greater than or equal to 0.2. To achieve validation of the assay, intra and inter-assay 
precision, accuracy/dilutability, specificity, sample stability, and robustness were evaluated. 
Memory B-cells specific for CT and LPS, Inaba strain ELISPOT assay 
Percentages of memory B-cells that are specific for V. cholerae toxin B (CT) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 
Inaba strain) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of clinical trial subjects were measured using 
an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 31/111 
  
  
Spots appearing in assay wells corresponding to B-cells within a PBMC sample that secreted IgG or IgA 
antibody specific for CT or LPS were enumerated. PBMC isolated from blood samples collected from each 
subject are cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen and then batch tested in the same experiment.  
The ELISPOT assay was conducted at the site of the MAH. Since the memory B cell evaluation was only an 
exploratory endpoint in clinical studies, this assay was qualified rather than validated.   
O-specific polysaccharide antibody ELISA assay 
A research study was conducted post-hoc on samples from the PXVX-VC-200-003 trial (challenge study) 
using an ELISA assay to detect different anti-O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) antibody subclasses directed 
against the lipopolysaccharide of V. cholerae serogroup O1. The seroconversion threshold was defined as 
>1.5 fold increase from baseline. The findings from this study were included in the dossier based on a 
publication by Islam et al. (2018). 
Concomitant administration with other vaccines 
No clinical studies are included that assess the concomitant use of PXVX0200 with particularly oral travel 
vaccines, however the Applicant provided supportive data in the form of medical literature on Orochol 
(vaccine previously registered and marketed by SSVI/Berna, Switzerland, which contains the strain CVD103-
HgR). Vaccines such as Oral Ty21a, oral polio vaccine and yellow fever vaccine were studied in 
coadministration with Orochol. 
It was found that Orochol and Ty21a could be administered concomitantly with no adverse effect on 
immunogenicity of either vaccine, although this study used a non-enteric coated formulation of the Ty21a 
vaccine (Cryz 1995b, Kollaritsch 1996). The current marketed formulation of Vivotif (typhoid vaccine, live, 
oral, Ty21a) consists of enteric coated capsules, and it is possible that the buffer used with Vaxchora vaccine 
could adversely affect the protective effect of the enteric coating of Vivotif. Historically, the Orochol package 
insert advised that the administration of Orochol and Vivotif should be separated by 8 hours for this reason. 
However, the applicant assessed to what extent a separation of concomitantly administered Vaxchora and 
Vivotif is necessary based on the nature of the buffer used in Vaxchora on published literature to this topic. 
The current marketed formulation of Vivotif (typhoid vaccine, live, oral, Ty21a) consists of enteric coated 
capsules, and it is possible that the buffer used with Vaxchora vaccine could adversely affect the protective 
effect of the enteric coating of Vivotif. It is estimated that the buffer of Vaxchora rapidly interacts with the 
acid in the stomach allowing a return to normal pH values within a time frame of two hours, which is 
therefore the suggested separation time of two hours between the administration of Vivotif and Vaxchora. 
Studies of concomitant vaccination with oral polio vaccine and yellow fever vaccine (YF 17D) demonstrated 
that these vaccines did not suppress the immune response to Orochol and that the immune response to YF 
17D was also not suppressed by Orochol (Kollaritsch 1997, Tsai 1999). 
There are no plans for any further interference studies to be conducted with other travel vaccines, which is 
acceptable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Vaxchora is a live attenuated oral vaccine. The mode of administration therefore corresponds to the natural 
mode of infection with the aim of providing protection at the site of infection. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 32/111 
  
  
No clinical studies are included that assess the concomitant use of PXVX0200 with particularly oral travel 
vaccines. The applicant relied on information from an earlier version of the vaccine (Orochol) as supportive 
information to provide additional assurance of the clinical profile of the product.  
Humoral immunity, induced by V. cholerae infection, specifically sIgA, targets both the lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) coat of the bacterium and the cholera toxin (CT). Antibodies directed against LPS appear to confer 
more robust protection than those against CT (Apter 1993). The anti-LPS response is focused on the O-
specific polysaccharide (OSP) (Wang 1998, Villeneuve 2000, Johnson 2012). The serum vibriocidal antibody 
(SVA) assay measures lysis of standardised V. cholera (according to serotype). SVA seroconversion was pre-
specified in the protocol as a >4-fold increase over baseline.  
All analyses of immunogenicity are based on samples taken from peripheral blood (serum and B-cells).  
Immunogenicity analyses used assays that were validated and carried out at a central laboratory for 
determining serum vibriocidal antibodies (SVA) and anti-cholera toxin (CT) antibodies. The only assay that 
was not validated was the ELISPOT assay to measure memory B-cells, which was carried out In House by the 
Sponsor.  
The serum vibriocidal antibodies correspond to a simple means of assessing the induction of functional 
vibriocidal antibodies. SVA measurements in serum may not adequately reflect immune responses produced 
locally in the mucosa. Assessment of the duration of immunity was limited to detecting B-cell memory 
responses up to 6 months post-vaccination. Since the assay used was not validated, findings from this assay 
are considered exploratory.  
Clinical pharmacology documentation of this orally administered live bacterial vaccine has shortcomings 
regarding interactions with antimicrobials and effects of food intake. The Applicant circumvents these 
shortcomings by including relevant prescribing information to avoid antimicrobials and eating.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No clinical studies have been carried out to determine the potential for immune interference should Vaxchora 
be taken with other, particularly oral, vaccines prior to travel, but supportive information applicable to 
Vaxchora was included in the SmPC to inform prescribers.     
Serum vibriocidal antibodies (SVA) were detected using a validated functional assay that involved 
complement-mediated bacteriolysis. The SVA assay detected mainly IgM antibodies, which correspond mainly 
to de novo immune responses. Detection of anti-CT antibodies used a validated ELISA assay specific for 
detecting IgG antibodies, which are usually induced approximately 2 weeks after exposure to antigen. 
Detection of memory B-cells involved a qualified but not validated ELISPOT assay using frozen peripheral 
blood lymphocytes. No criteria for cell recovery and viability were used; however the viability of the cells was 
acceptable.  
The omission of non-clinical studies can be considered acceptable based on the accrued clinical experience 
with similar vaccines. 
No major concerns were identified and from a pharmacology perspective the application is considered 
acceptable.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Defined dose-finding studies have not been carried out.  
The final to-be-marketed formulation selected for Vaxchora is between 4x108 to 2x109 CFU/dose, and the 
recommended regimen is a single dose to be administered at least 10 days prior to potential exposure to 
cholera.   
The challenge study used a dose of 4x108 CFU/dose. This is in line with historical data from a challenge trial 
using Orochol at a concentration of 3-5x108 CFU/dose (Losonsky 1993), which supports the proposed lower 
end of the specification. 
Vaccine lots with a concentration of 1x109 CFU/dose were used in the lot consistency, older adults and 
paediatric studies in order to provide evidence of safety of a “higher” concentration for use in setting release 
specifications. The concentration of 1x109 CFU/dose was shown to be well tolerated. The highest 
concentration of Vaxchora evaluated in the clinical trials was 1.39x109 CFU/dose (rounds to 1x109 CFU/dose). 
A higher concentration of Vaxchora is being used in an investigator-initiated study in Mali (1x1010 CFU/dose). 
These data support the recommendation for the upper potency specification limit for Vaxchora of 2x109 
CFU/dose. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The Applicant submitted five clinical studies on Vaxchora: one Phase 1 study, three Phase 3 studies and one 
Phase 4 study. One of the Phase 3 studies (PXVX-VC-200-003) is a challenge study, which was important for 
determining efficacy.  
The clinical efficacy study is described first, followed by the remaining immunogenicity studies as well as the 
bridging analysis. Information related to Orochol is considered relevant for Vaxchora since Orochol was based 
on the same V. cholerae strain as Vaxchora, and is described under Supportive Studies.  
PXVX-VC-200-003 
A Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-centre clinical study was carried out to 
evaluate efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of a single dose of the live oral cholera vaccine candidate, 
PXVX0200, CVD103-HgR Strain compared with placebo following challenge with virulent Vibrio Cholera 01 El 
Tor Inaba at 10 days or 3 months post-vaccination in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 45 years. Healthy adults 
were randomised to receive Vaxchora (PXVX200), or placebo (physiological saline) in a 1:1 ratio. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria: 
Healthy male and female adults, age 18 to 45 years (inclusive). Women of childbearing potential had to have 
a negative pregnancy test at screening, prior to vaccination and challenge. All participants had to be of non-
childbearing potential or use contraception/birth control within 2 months of vaccination, and had to agree to 
continue such precautions during the study and for 30 days post-challenge. Male subjects had to agree not to

father a child for 30 days post-vaccination. Participants had to be able to pass a written examination with at 
least a score of 70% correct in order to demonstrate their comprehension of the study procedures and 
possible side effects before inoculation with the challenge strain, V. cholerae. If the subject scored at least 
50% correct, he/she could take the test a second time after undergoing re-education, but could not 
participate if the second score was less than 70%. Participants had to agree not to participate in another 
investigational vaccine or drug trial during the duration of the study. 
Main exclusion criteria: 
•  Clinically significant history of immunodeficiency, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, 
endocrine disorder, liver disease, renal disease, gastrointestinal disease, anal or rectal disorders, 
neurologic illness, psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization, current drug or alcohol abuse.  
•  History of hospitalization for psychiatric illness, suicide attempt, or confinement for danger to self or 
others, within the past 10 years. 
• 
Elevated blood pressure, ≥150 systolic or ≥90 diastolic mm Hg, before vaccination.  
•  Abnormal stool pattern defined as fewer than 3 stools per week or more than 2 stools per day in past 
6 months, and loose stools during the 1–2 day acclimation period before challenge.  
•  Known allergy to, or known medical condition that precludes the use of both tetracycline and/or 
ciprofloxacin. Previously received a licensed or investigational cholera vaccine. Travel to a cholera-
endemic area in the previous 5 years.  
•  Malignancy (excluding non-melanotic skin cancers) or lymphoproliferative disorders diagnosed or 
treated during the past 5 years.  
• 
Positive serology for HIV, hepatitis B antigen, or hepatitis C.  
•  Received or planned to receive any other licensed vaccines, except for seasonal influenza vaccine, 
from 14 days prior to the study vaccination until 28 days post-vaccination or challenge, whichever is 
longer. Received or planned to receive antibiotics (other than protocol-specified) or chloroquine 
within 14 days prior to the study vaccination through to 28 days post-vaccination or challenge, 
whichever is longer.  
Participants that were due to be challenged had an additional eligibility requirement in that they should 
continue their consent to participate in the study and pass a written examination with a minimum score of 
70% to demonstrate their comprehension of the study procedures and possible side effects. If subjects 
scored at least 50% correct but less than 70% correct, they could retake the exam a second time after 
undergoing re-education, but were ineligible if the second score was less than 70%. 
Treatments 
Each subject was randomised to receive a single vaccination of either: 
•  Vaxchora (PXVX0200), administered orally as a suspension with buffer, or 
• 
Placebo (physiological saline), administered orally. 
On the day of challenge (Day 11 or Day 91), each subject selected for challenge was administered 1x105 CFU 
of wild type V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba strain N16961.  
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 35/111 
  
  
All challenged subjects were carefully monitored in the in-patient unit, had intravenous or oral rehydration 
when they had stool output that met the definition of diarrhoea (grade 3).  All subjects who did not receive 
antimicrobials due to diarrhoea received antimicrobials starting 96 hours after challenge or earlier if they had 
stool output that met the definition of severe diarrhoea (cumulative stool output >5L).

challenged at 10 days. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculations depended on three key assumptions: the expected protective efficacy of the 
vaccine; the attack rate of moderate or severe diarrhoea among placebo recipients; and the expected 
proportion of subjects of blood group O (a priori knowledge that the attack rate varies by blood group). 
Protective efficacy has been estimated at 90% based on the results of a challenge trial that was similar to the 
current study (Tackett 1999). The expected attack rate of moderate or severe diarrhoea was estimated from 
two previous trials involving a total of 63 placebo recipients challenged with the same dose and strain of 
virulent V. cholerae used in the current trial (Sack 1998; Tacket 1999). Summing across trials, 13 of 24 
(54%) subjects of blood group O and 14 of 39 (36%) non-O subjects experienced moderate or severe 
diarrhoea following challenge. The proportion of subjects in the trial with blood group O was controlled during 
enrolment with the aim of having 60% of all enrolled subjects with blood group O. The expected attack rate, 
however, has been estimated under the more conservative assumption that 50% of challenged subjects will 
be blood group O. Under that assumption, the attack rate among placebo recipients was expected to be 45%. 
Since the 10-day and 3-month challenges target different aspects of the vaccine’s performance, they were 
analysed separately. However, vaccinees in each challenge were compared to a common control group 
comprised of all placebo recipients challenged at any time during the trial. That implied that the treatment 
arms contained an unequal number of subjects in each challenge analysis with roughly twice as many placebo 
recipients as vaccines. As a precaution against introducing bias, there was a roughly equal balance between 
vaccinees and placebo recipients within each challenge. The sample size for the 10-day challenge study (31 
subjects per treatment arm combined with the 27 placebo recipients in the 3-month challenge) was chosen to 
have 95% power of meeting the primary objective to show that the lower 95% confidence bound on 
protective efficacy exceeds 30%. Like the 10-day challenge, the analysis for the 3-month challenge compared 
vaccinees challenged at 3 months to the group of placebo recipients pooled across both challenges. The 
resulting sample of 27 vaccinees and 58 placebo recipients yielded approximately 93% power to establish 
that the lower 95% confidence bound is at least 30% at the 3-month challenge. An allowance was built to 
accommodate a shortfall in the number challenged. Allowing for a 10% shortfall inflated the ultimate sample 
size to 34 subjects per treatment arm in the 10-day challenge and 30 subjects per arm in the 3-month 
challenge.  
This minimal sample size calculated was estimated to achieve both co-primary endpoints at a power level of 
at least 95%*93%=88%. Ultimately, the total sample size for the trial was 95 subjects in the treatment arm 
and 102 subjects in the placebo arm.

Randomisation and blinding 
A randomization schedule was created using randomized permuted blocks, and randomized subjects within 
each site were assigned the treatment (PXVX0200 or placebo) associated with the next available row on the 
schedule within the appropriate Blood Group stratum. The subject’s identification (ID), as well as the date 
and time of randomization, were populated. Subjects were automatically assigned by the interactive web 
randomization system (IWRS) upon randomization. Prior to the day of vaccination, a report was generated 
for each site based on subjects that met entry criteria, providing blood group and Subject IDs. The unblinded 
statistician reviewed the list and selected a subset of subjects that met target enrolment within site that 
satisfied at least 60% blood group 0. This information was reported in the EDC, in order for the sites to 
obtain a list of subjects and alternates to be invited back for randomization and vaccination. At the time of 
the vaccination visit, the user accessed the randomization system to enrol each subject and randomize the 
subject. In the event that a subject no longer qualified for vaccination, the user accessed the system to 
identify which alternate subject should be randomized. 
After enrolment, sites screened subjects to eligibility into the Challenge Phase of the trial. It was expected 
that approximately 30% of subjects would not be challenged in the 10-day challenge group, and 
approximately 40% of subjects would not be challenged in the 3-month challenge group. 
Blinded study personnel received a randomization notification once a subject had been randomized into the 
study, excluding the assigned treatment. An unblinded site pharmacist who was qualified to handle and 
dispense medication received an unblinded notification from the system generated at the time the subject 
was randomized and used that information to dispense the PXVX0200 vaccine or placebo as appropriate. 
Statistical methods 
Vaccine protective efficacy (PE) was estimated by comparing the attack rates of moderate/severe diarrhoea 
in the two vaccinated challenge groups to those in the combined placebo group as per the protocol and 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Protective Efficacy = [(Attack Rate in Placebo Group – Attack Rate in Vaccine Group)/Attack Rate in Placebo 
Group] x 100  
Confidence intervals (CIs) for the PE estimates were calculated using the method of Farrington and Manning 
(Farrington 1990). PE was estimated using similar methods for subgroups of subjects defined by blood type, 
sex, and race. Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare vaccine and placebo groups on the number and 
volume of loose stools experienced post-challenge, while Wilcoxon rank test were used to compare groups on 
the number of days with loose stools and the number of days shedding V. cholerae. Fisher’s exact tests were 
also used to compare the percentage of subjects in the vaccine and placebo groups that reported signs and 
symptom of reactogenicity.  
Vibriocidal and anti-CT antibody were summarized by GMT and seroconversion defined as the percentage of 
subjects with a 4-fold or higher increase in titre over baseline. For discrete/categorical variables, the number 
and percentage of non-missing subjects was generated. 
Bridging across studies and immune correlates 
In order to develop criteria to bridge the protective efficacy established in the younger adults ages 18-45 who 
participated in the challenge trial to other age groups and populations, analyses were conducted on the data 
from the challenge study to assess potential immune correlates of protection. SVA GMT, fold rise, 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 38/111 
  
  
seroconversion and seroprotection levels were evaluated using the results from the 10-Day and 3-Month 
challenge cohorts. Seroprotection was defined as a range of vibriocidal titre cut-offs evaluated to investigate 
correlation with the development of moderate/severe cholera. SVA seroconversion was defined as a ≥4-fold 
rise in SVA titre from pre-vaccination to Day 11. Administration of a single 5x108 CFU oral dose of PXVX0200 
led to serum vibriocidal seroconversion in 89.4% of vaccine recipients by Day 11 (10 days after vaccination).  
There was a significant correlation between SVA seroconversion and protection from cholera diarrhoea (refer 
to the section on Exploratory outcomes). Fold-rises in SVA titre at Day 11 were observed frequently in 
Vaxchora recipients and extremely rarely in placebo recipients. Furthermore, only 2 of 62 seroconverting 
Vaxchora recipients developed moderate/severe cholera after challenge: 1 of 33 at Day 11 and 1 of 29 at 
Day 91. Based on this near 1:1 relationship between seroconversion and protection, along with the fact that 
approximately 90% of Vaxchora recipients seroconverted, SVA seroconversion at Day 11 was used as the 
best immunologic measure for establishing a bridge between populations. 
Seroconversion performed better as an immune marker than titre or a protective level of vibriocidal antibody, 
perhaps because it was better measure of “vaccine take” and better reflected unmeasured variables such as 
local (gastrointestinal) immune responses.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 197 subjects were randomized, 95 to Vaxchora (PXVX0200) and 102 to saline placebo, 
approximately at a 1:1 ratio. Each randomized subject received a single dose (Day 1) of vaccine or placebo, 
administered orally. The study disposition is shown in the figure below.

Recruitment 
Study Period: Duration: 8 months. Date of first enrolment: 07 May 2012. Date of last completed: 07 Jan 
2013. 
Conduct of the study 
One subject was dosed from a previously utilised vial. The randomisation was appropriate, but dosing was 
inappropriately low and resulted in the subject being removed from the pre-specified Immunogenicity 
Evaluable Cohort. 
After the trial began, but before unblinding, it was discovered that the two clinical sites were using different 
techniques to prepare the vaccine and placebo for administration. Specifically, the University of Kentucky site 
reconstituted lyophilised vaccine or the placebo powder using tap water while the CVD at the University of 
Maryland used sterile, non-bacteriostatic water. 
Given that concern was raised over whether chlorine or other additives in tap water could affect dose of 
PXVX0200 administered, and consequently could affect immunogenicity, several new analyses were added to 
the statistical analysis plan to investigate potential differences in antibody response between the two sites. 
In particular, the two clinical sites were compared based on the seroconversion rate and GMT from both 
vibriocidal and anti-CT antibody assays using data from vaccine recipients only. The results from each site 
were also compared to the group of placebo recipients pooled over both sites. Hochberg’s procedure 
(Hochberg 1988) was used to adjust for the multiple comparisons involved in the analyses. The additional 
site-specific analyses were specified after data unblinding.

Note: Percentages were based on the number of randomized subjects in each treatment arm. 
a.ITT: All randomized subjects who received vaccination. 
b.Safety: All subjects who received study treatment. 
c. Immunogenicity Evaluable: subjects who received treatment and had evaluable, classical Inaba vibriocidal antibody 
results from Day 1 and at least one post-vaccination time point prior to challenge. 
d. Memory B Cell Analysis: Subjects in the ITT population who received vaccine and were not challenged or who received 
placebo and were challenged 10-days post-vaccination and had evaluable anti-O1 LPS IgA memory B cell results at Day 1 
and Day 181, as well as subjects who received vaccine and were challenged 3 months post-vaccination and had evaluable 
anti-O1 LPS IgA memory B cell results at Day 1 and Day 91.  
e. Analyses of laboratory specimens obtained pre-challenge Day 91 for the 33 placebo recipients challenged at 3 months 
were added after initial data analysis was performed. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the occurrence of moderate or severe diarrhoea (≥3.0 L cumulative purge) 
post-challenge with virulent V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba 10 days (Day 11) and 3 months post-vaccination 
(Day 91) in two separate challenges. The co-primary objectives of the study were to demonstrate that the 
Assessment report

lower 95% confidence bound on the protective efficacy was ≥30% at both of these time points. Success at 
both the 10-Day and 3-Month Challenges was required to achieve success for the trial as a whole. 
Protective efficacy for the 10-Day and 3-Month Challenge groups is shown in Table 7. The co-primary 
objectives of the study were met in the ITT group with 10-Day protective efficacy of 90.3% (lower 95% CI 
bound of 62.7%) and 3-Month protective efficacy of 79.5% (lower 95% CI bound of 49.9%). 
Table 7 Primary efficacy endpoint: Protective efficacy for 10-Day and 3-Month challenge (ITT) 
Note: Percentages were based on the number of subjects with a non-missing value within each treatment group. Mild 
diarrhoea was defined as the passage of 2 or more unformed stools (grades 3 to 5) over a 48-h period that equalled or 
exceeded 200 mL or a single unformed stool of 300 mL or greater and less than 3 L total diarrhoea. 
a Attack Rate: Moderate or severe diarrhoea severity, as noted by ≥3 L of overall diarrhoeal purge. 
b Protective Efficacy = [(Attack Rate in Placebo Group - Attack Rate in Vaccine Group)/Attack Rate in Placebo Group] * 
100. 
c Confidence interval was calculated using the Farrington and Manning method for a ratio of binomial variables where 
protective efficacy under the null hypothesis is 0.3. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints included incidence of diarrhoea of any severity, total weight of diarrhoeal stools 
converted to volume (1 g=1 mL) and incidence and peak concentration of shedding post-challenge with 
virulent V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba measured 10 days and 3 months post-vaccination. 
The definition of stool grade is shown below. Diarrhoea was defined as grade 3 and above. 
•  Grade 1: formed (normal, does not take shape of the container) 
•  Grade 2: soft (normal, does not take shape of the container) 
•  Grade 3: thick (liquid diarrhoeal, takes the shape of the container) 
•  Grade 4: opaque watery 
•  Grade 5: rice water (clear watery).  
The severity of diarrhoea was based on cumulative (total) diarrhoeal volume over a 10 day period following 
challenge when participants were in-patients.

Severity of diarrhoea:   
•  Mild: < 3 L of diarrhoea 
•  Moderate: ≥3 L – 5 L of diarrhoea 
•  Severe: > 5 L of diarrhoea 
The incidence of diarrhoea of any severity (mild, moderate, or severe) for the 10-Day and 3-Month 
Challenge groups is shown in Table 8 below. Protective efficacy against diarrhoea of any severity (mild or 
worse) was 84.5% (95% CI, 67.0%-100.0%) 10 days post-vaccination and 50.8% (95% CI, 33.6%-66.8%) 
3 months post-vaccination. The lack of overlap between the CIs for protective efficacy against diarrhoea of 
any severity at 10 days and at 3 months post-challenge suggests that efficacy for this secondary endpoint 
was higher at 10 days than at 3 months. The bulk of this difference was due to the higher incidence of mild 
diarrhoea among the 3-Month Challenge vaccine recipients (33.3%) than among the 10-Day Challenge 
vaccine recipients (8.6%) (Table 7 above). Protective efficacy against severe diarrhoea was 93.3% (95% CI, 
56.2%-100.0%) 10 days post-vaccination and 85.7% (95% CI, 46.2%-100.0%) 3 months post-vaccination 
(Table 8). 
Table 8 Secondary endpoint Protective efficacy for secondary endpoints for 10-Day and 3-Month

Note: Percentages were based on the number of subjects with a non-missing value within each treatment group. 
Note: Mild diarrhoea was defined as the passage of 2 or more unformed stools (grades 3 to 5) over a 48-h period that 
equalled or exceeded 200 mL or a single unformed stool of >300 mL or <3 L total diarrhoea. Worse diarrhoea includes all 
cumulative diarrhoea <5L. 
Note: Severe diarrhoea was defined as the passage of >5 L of unformed stools (grades 3 to 5) over a 48-hour period.

protective efficacy under the null hypothesis is 0. 
Daily and overall volume of grade 3 or higher stools through 10 days post-challenge for the 10-Day and 
3-Month Challenge groups were measured. Among subjects who had grade 3 or higher stools, the median 
(min-max) overall volume of grade 3 or higher stools was 309 (154-18,164) mL for 10-Day Challenge 
vaccine recipients; 603 (22 – 9,950) mL for 3-Month Challenge vaccine recipients. Both medians were

significantly less than the median of 4,524 (140 – 24,374) mL for the combined placebo group (p=0.0073 for 
10-Day Challenge and p<0.0001 for 3-Month Challenge; Wilcoxon rank sum test). 
The number of days that subjects had grade 3 or higher stools through 10 days post-challenge is 
described for the 10-Day and 3-Month Challenge groups (Table 9). In this table, the statistics were calculated 
from all subjects in the group including those who had no grade 3 or higher stools. The median number of 
days with grade 3 or higher stools was 0.0 in vaccine recipients in the 10-Day Challenge group and 1.0 in 
vaccine recipients in the 3-Month Challenge group; both medians were significantly less than the median of 
5.0 days with grade 3 or higher stools for the combined placebo group (p<0.0001 for 10-Day and 3-Month 
Challenges; Wilcoxon rank sum test).

Tertiary efficacy endpoints  
Pre-Challenge Immunogenicity – serum vibriocidal antibodies (SVA) 
The post-vaccination, pre-challenge immune response was a tertiary endpoint in this efficacy study. It was 
assessed by serum vibriocidal antibody (SVA) geometric mean titre (GMT) over time (Table 11), the 
percentage of subjects with a 4-fold rise in serum vibriocidal antibody from Baseline (Table 12) against 
homologous classical Inaba. Immune response was also assessed against three heterologous V. cholerae 
serotypes and biotypes: El Tor Inaba, classical Ogawa, and El Tor Ogawa (Table 13, Table 14).

Post-Challenge Immunogenicity- serum vibriocidal antibodies (SVA) 
The post-challenge immune response is presented for the 10-Day Challenge group and the 3-Month

challenge as well as by Day 181. Immune response was also assessed against heterologous V. cholerae 
serotypes and biotypes including El Tor Inaba, classical Ogawa, and El Tor Ogawa on Day 181.Overall, the 
serum vibriocidal antibody responses post-challenge were higher in placebo recipients compared to in vaccine 
recipients. This is in contrast to the immune response after vaccination, which were higher in vaccine 
recipients than placebo recipients at all time points. 
Post-challenge vibriocidal antibody GMT against classical Inaba was 2460.6 at 28 days after challenge and 
295.6 at Day 181 in the 10-Day Challenge vaccine recipients. In the 3- Month Challenge recipients, 
vibriocidal antibody GMT against classical Inaba was 1646.9 at 28 days after challenge and 223.9 at Day 181. 
In the combined placebo group vibriocidal antibody GMT against classical Inaba was 17409.1 at 28 days after 
challenge and 2031.9 at Day 181 (p<0.0001 for both time points in both the 10-Day and the 3-Month 
Challenge groups). 
Post-challenge the percentage of subjects with a 4-fold rise in serum vibriocidal antibody against classical 
Inaba by 28 days was 5.7% in the 10-Day Challenge vaccine recipients, 60.6% in the 3-Month Challenge 
vaccine recipients, and 97% in the combined placebo group (p<0.0001 for both time points in both the 10-
Day and the 3-Month Challenge groups; t-test comparing log results from vaccine recipients with placebo 
recipients). 
Post-Challenge serum vibriocidal antibody responses against other serotypes and biotypes (Day 
181) 
The main findings on post-challenge on the geometric mean titres against other biotypes and serotypes are

Pre-challenge Anti-Cholera toxin CT antibody responses 
The post-vaccination, pre-challenge anti-cholera toxin (CT) immune responses were assessed. For these 
analyses the vaccine and placebo groups respectively were combined. Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold 
increase in antibody titre from baseline.  
On Days 8, 11, 29, 91, and 181, vaccine recipients had a higher immune response than placebo recipients 
with respect to anti-CT GMT and in the percentage of subjects who seroconverted. 
Geometric mean values peaked at 1609.8 at Day 29, rather than Day 11 as seen with vibriocidal immune 
responses. The cumulative percentage of subjects who seroconverted reached a maximum of 38.3% by Day 
181 for anti-CT antibody. 
Post-challenge Anti-Cholera toxin CT antibody responses 
Post-challenge anti-CT responses were assessed on Day 181. Overall, the immune response post-challenge 
was higher in placebo recipients than in vaccine recipients. This is in contrast to the immune response after 
vaccination, which was higher in vaccine recipients than placebo recipients at all time points as described.  
Post-challenge anti-CT antibody GMT was 1236.8 at Day 181 in the 10-Day Challenge vaccine recipients 
6072.7 at Day 181 in the 3-Month Challenge vaccine recipients, and 21000.7 at Day 181 in combined placebo 
group (p<0.0001 for the 10-Day Challenge group and p=0.0004 for the 3-Month Challenge group. Post-
challenge the percentage of subjects with a 4-fold rise in serum anti-CT antibody by Day 181 was 28.6% 
after challenge in the 10-Day Challenge vaccine recipients, 57.6% in the 3-Month Challenge vaccine 
recipients and 84.8% in combined placebo group (p<0.0001 for the 10-Day Challenge group and p=0.0054 
for the 3-Month Challenge group.  
Exploratory Outcomes 
Serum vibriocidal antibody as an immune correlate of protection  
The exploratory outcomes were to a) correlate serum vibriocidal antibodies (SVA) and anti-cholera toxin (CT) 
antibodies with protective effect, b) Explore the association between age and immunologic response, and 
evaluate whether the relationship between immunologic response and outcome varies with age, c) Explore

the impact of blood type (group O vs. non-O) on the incidence and severity of diarrhoea and d) explore the 
relationship between pre-challenge memory B cell concentration and the incidence or severity of diarrhoea.

Serum vibriocidal immune response is considered as an immune marker that correlates with protection in 
orally administered cholera vaccines (Holmgren 2010, Levine 1981). Since the serum vibriocidal immune 
response is an IgM response that peaks 7-14 days after vaccination, attempting to use serum vibriocidal titer 
measured at Day 11 alone as an immune marker introduces variability and is not likely to be reliable after 
peak response, owing to the decline in IgM levels as isotype switching occurs and the antibodies induced 
become IgG and IgA. A more reliable measurement of the transient IgM response is therefore vibriocidal 
seroconversion as defined by a 4-fold increase from baseline, since it accounts for individual variability in 
antibody titer levels. 
The rate of seroconversion is shown in Table 20.

From Table 20 it is evident that 2 two subjects in the Day 11 challenge group did not seroconvert, and four 
subjects in the 3-Month challenge group did not seroconvert. In total 6/68 vaccinees did not seroconvert 
(8.8%). One placebo subject seroconverted at Day 11.  
Table 21 shows the rates of seroconversion at Day 11 with respect to incidence of moderate/severe 
diarrhoea (>5L cumulative stool output). One of the subjects that did not seroconvert in the Day 11 
challenge group experienced moderate/severe diarrhoea, whereas three of the four non-seroconverters in the 
Day 91 challenge group experienced moderate/severe diarrhoea.

For the 68 vaccine recipients in the 10-Day and 3-Month challenge studies, total post-challenge  diarrhoeal 
volume was significantly greater in vibriocidal non-converters at Day 11 than in seroconverters (p=0.001; 
median volume=6.8 L, n=6 for non-converters; median volume=0.0 L, n=62 for seroconverters; Wilcoxon 
Rank Sum Test) (Figure 4). 
Figure 2 Total Diarrhoeal Volume by Vibriocidal Seroconversion on Day 11 – Vaccine Recipients in the 10-
Day and 3-Month Challenge Studies 
Diarrhoea severity was assessed in all subjects (both vaccinated and placebo) that were challenged at Day 11 
with respect to vibriocidal titre and fold increase in titre from baseline. The fold increase in SVA for all 
participants is shown in Figure 5, where those with mild diarrhoea correspond mainly to the 3-month 
challenge group. One of the two vaccinees that did not seroconvert and did not experience diarrhoea. One 
placebo subject seroconverted but did not experience diarrhoea.

Figure 3 Vibriocidal Antibody Seroconversion correlates with Protection 
Consistent with the case for post-vaccination vibriocidal titre at Day 11, there was a statistically significant 
association between fold-rise in serum vibriocidal antibody titre from Day 1 to Day 11 and total post-
challenge diarrhoeal volume (Spearman’s r=-0.72; p<0.001). Seroconversion, defined as a ≥4-fold rise in 
vibriocidal titre from pre-vaccination to post-vaccination levels, identified “vaccine take” such that only 2 of 
62 (3%) of seroconverting vaccine recipients developed moderate/severe cholera after challenge. Based on 
this near 1:1 relationship between seroconversion and protection, along with the fact that approximately 
90% of vaccine recipients seroconverted, serum vibriocidal seroconversion at Day 11 was used as the best 
immunologic measure for establishing a bridge between populations.  
Anti-CT antibody as an immune correlate of protection 
The relationships between anti-CT antibody titres and diarrhoea-derived outcomes were also assessed. Since 
anti-CT antibody rises mores slowly and persists longer than vibriocidal antibody, serum anti-CT antibody 
titres on Days 1, 8, and 11 as well as fold rises from Day 1 to Days 8 and 11 were assessed in the 10-Day 
Challenge Group while titres at Days 1, 8, 11, 29, and 91 as well as fold rises from Day 1 to Days 8, 11 ,29, 
and 91 were assessed in the 3-Month Challenge Group to enable measurements of association with diarrhoeal 
outcomes post-challenge. As with vibriocidal titre, the primary response variable for analyses of anti-CT 
antibody titre was moderate/severe cholera. 
Anti-CT antibody titre was not strongly associated with outcome. Overall, anti-CT antibody titre increased 
post-vaccination in only a subset. Only slightly less than half, 16 of 33, of the 3-month challenge vaccine 
recipients had seroconverted prior to challenge. In the 33 vaccine recipients in the 3- month Challenge study, 
there was no significant difference in total post-challenge diarrhoeal volume between cumulative CT 
seroconverters at Day 91 and non-converters (p=0.18; median volume=0.5 L, n=17 for non-converters; 
median volume=0.2 L, n=16 for seroconverters; Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) (Figure 6).

Challenge Study.  
Antigen-specific Memory B Cell Response as an Immune Correlate of Duration of Protection 
The results of the challenge study demonstrated that following immunization with PXVX0200, serum 
vibriocidal response (particularly seroconversion at Day 11) was the best immune marker for protection both 
for volunteers challenged at 10 and at 90 days after immunization. Serum vibriocidal levels for the 33 vaccine 
recipients in the 90-day component of the study, however, declined over 90% from the peak geometric mean 
titre (GMT) of 3294 on Day 11 to a GMT of 271 on Day 91 and presumably continue to decline further with 
time. Memory B cell levels reflect a more durable immune response to vaccination and are considered to be 
potential predictors of duration of protection. 
There was no statistically significant correlation between the percentages of anti-O1 LPS IgG, anti-CT IgG, 
and anti-CT IgA memory B cells at Day 91 and total stool volume post-challenge. However, the primary 
finding from the evaluation of memory B cells as an immune correlate of duration of protection was that 
there was a statistically significant association between the post-vaccination/pre-challenge percentage of 
anti-LPS IgA memory B cells at Day 91 and total post-challenge diarrhoeal volume in vaccine recipients 
(Spearman correlation=-0.39,p=0.02, n=33). The fold-increase from Day 1 to Day 91 in the percentage of 
anti-LPS IgA memory B cells was even more strongly associated with total diarrhoeal volume (Spearman 
correlation=-0.56, p<0.001, n=33). 
Ancillary analyses 
Further analyses on immunology evaluable patients from the challenge study (n=46) were included as a 
publication by Islam et al. 2018. This study evaluated the immunoglobulin subclass of antibodies to O-linked 
polysaccharides (OSP) using an ELISA assay. Seroconversion for anti-OSP antibody responses was defined as 
>1.5-fold rise in ELISA units over baseline.  
Both titre and fold increase in anti-OSP antibodies were determined.  Serum IgM OSP responses were found 
to be correlated with vibriocidal responses (Spearman r = 0.67; p < 0.0001). Serum IgA OSP responses 
correlated less well with vibriocidal responses (Spearman r = 0.32; p= 0.03), and there was no correlation of 
IgG OSP responses and vibriocidal responses. Serum anti-OSP antibody responses fell back toward baseline 
within 90 days of vaccination, although possible persistence of antibody responses in mucosal tissue was not 
assayed in this study. Whether CVD 103-HgR induces long-lived plasma cell responses or memory B cell

vaccination. 
Immunogenicity and bridging studies 
Studies PXVX-VC-200-004, PXVX-VC-200-005, PXVX-VC-200-006 were considered pivotal and assessed 
immunogenicity only. A phase I clinical study PXVX-VC-200-200 also determined immunogenicity. Each 
clinical trial used a single oral dose of Vaxchora, and all studies were randomized, double-blind, and placebo-
controlled. Immunogenicity data from the Lot consistency study PXVX-VC-200-004 used in adults 18-45 
years was used to bridge to older adults up until the age of 64 years (PXVX-VC-200-005). Data from the Lot 
consistency study was also used to bridge immunogenicity data in children ≥6 to ≤18 years of age (PXVX-
VC-200-006).  
PXVX-VC-002-002 Phase I clinical study – summary 
The Phase 1 trial was designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single oral dose of PXVX0200 
in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 50 years. The study enrolled 66 participants (vaccine n=55; placebo n=11). 
The dose of vaccine used in this trial was 4.43 × 108 colony forming units (CFU) formulated as a lyophilized 
powder in vials. Lactose powder was used as the placebo rather than physiological saline which was used in 
all subsequent studies.  
The primary objectives of the Phase 1 trial were to evaluate the safety and clinical acceptability of PXVX0200, 
estimate the rate of seroconversion (≥4-fold rise) of serum Inaba vibriocidal antibody after a single oral dose, 
and estimate the between-subject variability of vibriocidal antibody response. Secondary objectives extended 
the safety evaluation to household contacts of vaccine and placebo recipients, evaluated the kinetics of serum 
Inaba vibriocidal antibody titres, estimated serum anti-cholera toxin (CT) immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) 
antibody seroconversion, and assessed faecal shedding of vaccine. 
Administration of a single oral dose of 4.43x108 CFU generated cumulative serum vibriocidal antibody 
seroconversion (cumulative seroconversion by a particular day indicates seroconversion on that day or on 
any previous day) in 88.9% [77.4, 95.8] of vaccine recipients by Day 15 (reported as Day 14 in the Phase 1 
CSR, as the CDISC standard for designating the day of vaccination as Day 1 was not implemented for that 
report) and cumulative anti-CT seroconversion in 59.3% [45.0, 72.4] of vaccine recipients by Day 29 
(reported as Day 28 in the Phase 1 CSR). The post-baseline time point with the greatest serum vibriocidal 
GMT was Day 11 (reported as Day 10 in the CSR), i.e., at 10 days post-vaccination. This Day 11 GMT was 
equal to 3025 [1720, 5320], titre levels were maintained through 14 days after vaccination, and these levels 
subsequently declined as expected for an IgM response. 
PXVX-VC-200-004 – Phase 3 Clinical Lot Consistency Trial - Summary 
The primary immunologic objective of this Phase 3 trial was to demonstrate the immunologic equivalence of 
three different production lots of PXVX0200 at Day 11 post-vaccination in healthy volunteers 18-45 years of 
age. The study enrolled 3146 participants (vaccine n=2795; placebo n=351). The three lots of vaccine were 
designated as Lot A (P700.550-1CA03), Lot B (P700.550-3CA03), and Lot C (P700.550-6BA03). Secondary 
immunogenicity objectives were to estimate the seroconversion rate of serum vibriocidal antibody by Day 11 
as well as the antibody response profile for 6 months post-vaccination. The concentration of vaccine used in 
this trial was 1x109 CFU/dose. Placebo was physiological saline. Both vaccine and placebo were administered 
orally. 
The protocol’s primary objective was met with the 95% confidence internal (CI) around each pairwise 
geometric mean ratio (GMR) falling within the pre-defined limits to demonstrate equivalence [0.67, 1.5]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 56/111 
  
  
GMRs were [0.78, 1.08] comparing lots A:B, [0.87, 1.20] comparing lots B:C, and [0.80, 1.10] comparing 
lots A:C. Day 11 GMTs of serum vibriocidal antibodies against homologous classical Inaba were 9220 [8219, 
10343], 10034 [8942, 11260], and 9827 [8770, 11012], respectively. Serum vibriocidal antibody GMT 
against homologous classical Inaba on Day 1 prior to vaccination was 69 in vaccine recipients and 72 in 
placebo recipients. On Day 11, 10 days after vaccination, serum vibriocidal GMT increased to 9688 [9067, 
10351] in vaccine recipients from all three lots combined and was relatively unchanged at 85 [72, 101] in 
placebo recipients. Administration of a single oral dose of PXVX0200 generated serum vibriocidal antibody 
seroconversion at Day 11 in 94% [93%, 94%] of vaccine recipients across the three lots of vaccine (n=2687, 
Immunogenicity Evaluable Population). 
The results of the Phase 3 lot consistency trial met pre-specified immunologic equivalence criteria and 
demonstrated that the vaccine is well tolerated.   
PXVX-VC-200-005 – Phase 3 Safety and Immunogenicity in Older Adults - Summary 
This trial was designed to evaluate the safety of a single oral dose of the PXVX0200 vaccine in older adults 
(46–64) and to collect immunogenicity data to enable comparisons with the antibody responses of younger 
adults (18-45) from the Phase 3 Lot consistency trial (CSR PXVX-VC-200-004). Vaccinated younger adults 
were shown to be protected from moderate or severe cholera in the challenge trial; protection is presumed 
for the vaccinated subjects in the lot consistency trial since subjects in that trial are in the same age range. 
The lot consistency trial was chosen as the comparator group for the older adults simply because the large 
sample size of the lot consistency trial afforded high power to establish an immunologic bridge between older 
and younger adults. The concentration of vaccine used in this trial in older adults was 1x109 CFU/dose, and 
the vaccine was derived from Lot No. P700.550-6BA03 in the Lot consistency trial. The placebo was 
physiological saline.  
The primary bridging objectives of this trial were to demonstrate that seroconversion by classical Inaba 
vibriocidal antibody titres at Day 11 in older adults ages 46–64 was non-inferior to the analogous rate at Day 
11 in younger adults ages 18–45 following vaccination with PXVX0200 and that the lower bound of the two-
sided 95% CI on seroconversion was greater than 70% in older adults. This primary bridging endpoint was 
based on the analyses on immune markers correlating with protection that were derived using the data from 
the live cholera challenge trial. Secondary bridging objectives included comparing older and younger adults 
on classical Inaba vibriocidal GMT following vaccination with PXVX0200. 
The primary bridging objectives were met. Following vaccination, 90.4% [86.4%, 93.5%] of older subjects 
and 93.5% [92.5%, 94.4%] of younger subjects seroconverted by classical Inaba vibriocidal antibody titers. 
Thus, it was established with 95% confidence that the proportion of seroconverters in the older adult 
population was greater than or equal to 86.4%, well above the pre-specified threshold of 70%. Furthermore, 
the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI on the difference in the rate of seroconversion between older and 
younger adults was −6.7%, which satisfied the pre-specified non-inferiority requirement that the lower bound 
of the 95% CI should be greater than or equal to −10%. 
For the secondary bridging endpoint of classical Inaba vibriocidal GMT, the peak GMT value of 4282 [3344, 
5484] in older adults was significantly lower than the peak GMT of 9688 [9067, 10351] in younger adults 
(p<0.0001). The mean log2 fold-increase in classical Inaba vibriocidal titre between Days 1 and 11 was 6.6 
[6.2, 7.0] in older adults, which was significantly lower than the mean log2 fold-increase of 7.1 [7.0, 7.3] 
attained by younger adults. Since the titres produced by the vibriocidal antibody assay lie on a scale for 
which each pair of levels differs by a factor of 2, a log2 fold-increase of 7 from Day 1 to Day 11 corresponds 
to an increase of 27 = 128, e.g., an increase from 40 to 5120 (5120/40 = 128). The results of this Phase 3 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020

older adult trial met the pre-specified immunologic non-inferiority criteria. Based on the immune markers 
analyses and the non-inferiority in the rate of seroconversion, it is expected that efficacy in older adults 
would be similar to efficacy in younger adults. 
PXVX-VC-200-006 – Phase 4 Study of Safety and Immunogenicity in children >6 and <18 years of 
age 
This was part of a larger randomised, phase 4, multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study 
assessing safety and immunogenicity of PXVX0200 in children >2 years to <18 years. An interim report is 
provided with data from children >6 to <18 years of age.  
The study had two primary immunogenicity objectives. The first objective was to demonstrate that the 
seroconversion rate at Day 11 in pediatric subjects was non-inferior to the seroconversion rate at Day 11 in 
previously studied adult subjects between the ages of 18 and 45 years (Lot study PXVX-VC-200-004). The 
second primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate that the seroconversion rate in pediatric 
subjects was greater than or equal to 70% with 98.3% confidence. Both objectives used the proportion of 
participants achieving seroconversion of serum vibriocidal antibody (SVA) against the classical Inaba biotype 
of V. cholerae at Day 11 following one dose of PXVX0200, defined as a 4-fold or greater rise over baseline 
Day 1 SVA titre. The secondary immunogenicity objective was to evaluate Seroconversion of SVA against the 
classical Inaba biotype of V. cholerae at Days 29, 91, and 181 (Days 91 and 181 in Cohort 1 only) following 
one dose of PXVX0200. This involved a single administration with a dose within the range 4 x 108 – 1 x 109 
based on the SmPC. The batch of PXVX0200 used in this study has not been part of the other clinical studies.  
The results are shown separately under ‘Bridging analysis between studies in adults and children >6 -<18 
years of age’ described after the bridging analysis between studies in adults and older adults below.  
Bridging analysis between studies in adults and older adults 
Two bridging analyses were performed, one compared subjects from the older adult trial to the younger 
adults in the lot consistency trial (PXVX-VC-200-004), and the second compared subjects from the older adult 
trial to the younger adults in the challenge trial (PXVX-VC-200-003). These findings are derived from a report 
that does not include analyses in children (PXVX-VC-200-006).

a The Challenge Population was defined as all subjects who were randomized and received either vaccine or placebo in the 
challenge trial, and were in either the 10-Day Challenge group or the 3-Month Challenge group. 
b Eligibility for inclusion in the Immunogenicity Evaluable Population was determined by criteria established in 
individual trials that required at least valid one post-vaccination assessment of immunogenicity.  
c The Immune Sub-study Population comprised a subset of subjects who had immunogenicity assessments at 
several time points between Days 1 and 181. The population is mostly useful for evaluating the development of 
the immune response over time.

The Immunogenicity Evaluable Population was the most inclusive set of subjects who have data available for 
immunogenicity analyses. In general, subjects needed to have only one valid post-baseline immunogenicity 
assessment to be included in this population. Subjects were included in the Immunogenicity Evaluable 
Population based on whether they satisfied the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the Immunogenicity 
Evaluable Population for the individual trial in which they participated. The eligibility criteria for the four 
individual trials were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Phase 1 Trial: Subjects were required to have classical Inaba vibriocidal antibody assay results at 
both baseline and at least one post-baseline visit. 
Challenge Trial: Subjects were required to have evaluable classical Inaba vibriocidal antibody results 
from Day 1 and at least one post-vaccination time point prior to challenge. 
Lot Consistency Trial: Subjects were required to have evaluable classical Inaba vibriocidal antibody 
results from Day 11 and have no major protocol violations that affected immunogenicity. 
Older Adult Trial: Subjects were required to have evaluable classical Inaba vibriocidal antibody results 
from both baseline and Day 11 and have no major protocol violations that affected immunogenicity. 
Immune Sub-study Populations, however, were only defined in two of the four trials included in this ISE. For 
those trials – the lot consistency trial and the older adult trial – vaccine recipients from the trial-specific 
Immune Sub-study Populations were also included in the ISE Immune Sub-study Population. For the other 
two trials in the ISE, eligibility for the Immune Sub-study Population was determined by the schedule of 
immunogenicity assessments within each trial. That is, since the Immune Sub-study Population was used to 
characterize long-term immune response – up to Day 181 – only those vaccine recipients who had 
immunogenicity assessments at either Day 91 or 181 were included in the ISE Immune Sub-study 
Population. Therefore, in the challenge trial 58 vaccine recipients who had immunogenicity assessments at 
Day 91 were included in the ISE Immune Sub-study Population. Note that the Day 91 data from challenged 
subjects was obtained prior to challenge administration. Since no immunogenicity assessments were made 
after Day 29 in the Phase 1 trial, no subjects from that trial were included in the ISE Immune Sub-study 
Population. This population was mostly useful for tracking the time course of the immune response to 
vaccination.

Cumulative seroconversion of vibriocidal antibodies against classical Inaba V. cholerae through Day 11 is 
presented for the Immunogenicity Evaluable Populations for the combined group of placebo subjects from all 
four trials and for the vaccine recipients in each trial in Table 25. While serum vibriocidal antibody 
seroconversion occurred in 2.9% [1.7%, 4.7%] of the combined placebo group across all trials, the 
percentage of serum vibriocidal antibody seroconverters for the vaccine groups in the four trials ranged from 
83.3% [70.7%, 92.1%] in the Phase 1 trial to 93.5% [92.5%, 94.4%] in the lot consistency trial. The 
variation in the widths of the CIs is mainly due to differences in sample size among trials.

The table above illustrates that the rate of seroconversion by classical Inaba vibriocidal antibody – the 
immune measure shown in the challenge trial to be a strong immune marker of protection against infection 
with V. cholerae – did not vary greatly across the three Phase 3 trials. In particular, the relatively small 
difference between the lot consistency and older adult trials affords evidence to support an immunologic 
bridge between younger and older adults. 
Using the Immunogenicity Evaluable Populations from each of the four trials, GMTs of vibriocidal antibody 
against classical Inaba on Day 11 are depicted separately for each trial specific vaccine group and for all 
placebo subjects combined in Table 26. While serum vibriocidal GMT was only 71 [63, 81] on Day 11 in 
placebo recipients, the minimum Day 11 GMT across the vaccine groups in the four trials was 3064 [1759, 
5338] in the Phase 1 trial.

The table above revealed that the subjects in the lot consistency trial had a higher classical Inaba GMT at Day 
11 than subjects in either the challenge or older adult trial. Since the lot consistency and older adult trials 
were executed simultaneously, and subjects in the older adult trial were vaccinated with one of the vaccine 
lots used in the lot consistency trial, the most likely explanation for the difference in GMT between the trials 
is the age of the subjects in each trial. Age does not explain the difference between the lot consistency and 
challenge trials since subjects in both trials were roughly the same age. The most likely explanation for the 
difference between those trials is the concentration of the vaccine formulation used in each trial. Specifically, 
the challenge trial used a single vaccine lot with a concentration of 5x108 CFU/dose while the lot consistency 
trial used three vaccine lots each with a concentration of 1x109 CFU/dose. 
Geometric mean titres of vibriocidal antibody against classical Inaba on Days 1, 11, 29, 91, and 181 are 
depicted for the Immune Sub-study Population of the challenge trial, lot consistency trial, and older adult trial 
in Figure 7. Vibriocidal antibody levels in vaccine recipients increased rapidly following vaccination, reaching a 
peak at Day 11 when GMTs ranged from 3555 in the challenge trial to 9922 in the lot consistency trial. While 
GMT levels had declined at Day 29 and Day 181, in each Phase 3 trial vaccine recipients attained a 
significantly higher GMT than placebo recipients at each post-vaccination time point through Day 181.

Serum vibriocidal Antibody responses to other biotypes and serotypes of V. cholerae in adults and 
older adults 
Vibriocidal antibody seroconversion through Day 11 against all three heterologous vaccine strains assessed 
for placebo and vaccine recipients in the Immunogenicity Evaluable Populations in the challenge and older 
adult trials is shown in Table 27 (fold rise) and Table 28 (titre). Interestingly, seroconversion against the 
Inaba serotypes was similar in younger and older adults while seroconversion against the Ogawa serotypes 
was lower in older adults when compared to younger adults.

Classical Inaba Serum Vibriocidal Antibody Seroconversion and Age 
Immune response is known to decline with age. The effect of age on the immune response to the vaccine was 
assessed primarily through analysis of titres of vibriocidal antibodies against classical Inaba V. cholerae.  
Since the older adult trial was designed specifically to enrol subjects from an age range that did not overlap 
with the age range for the challenge and lot consistency trials, the classical Inaba modelling results shown in 
Table 32 and Table 33 do not cleanly separate the effect of age on immune response from effects due to 
other differences between the trials. However, despite the confounding between the trial-to-trial and age 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 64/111 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
covariates, the summaries in these two tables clearly suggest that both classical Inaba vibriocidal titres and 
the proportion of classical Inaba seroconverters drop with age. 
Post-hoc analyses were performed to develop a deeper understanding of the effect of age on immune 
response. These supporting analyses used only the data from the lot consistency and older adult trials 
because these two trials utilized the same concentration (1x109 CFU/dose) of vaccine, whereas the lot used 
in the challenge trial had a different concentration (5x108 CFU/dose). Since the older adult and challenge 
trials differ in age range and vaccine release concentration (CFU/dose), it is not possible to tell whether 
differences in immunogenicity between the trials were due to vaccine release concentration or age. 
Figure 8 depicts the geometric mean of the fold-increase in the titre of vibriocidal antibody against classical 
Inaba and associated 95% confidence interval as a function of age. Locally weighted smoothers (lowess) of 
the age-specific geometric means are provided for each of the two trials. This graph indicates that fold-
increase in vibriocidal titre declined steadily with age but remained above the level that defines 
seroconversion for all ages studied. 
Figure 6 Fold rise in vibriocidal titre by age with local smoothers and pointwise 95% confidence 
intervals (Post-hoc analysis) 
As for fold rise in vibriocidal antibody titre from Day 1 to Day 11, the observed proportion of classical Inaba 
vibriocidal antibody seroconverters on Day 11 decreased with age (p = 0.0136). The summary presented in 
Table 29 divides the age range into seven non-overlapping categories to facilitate insight into the magnitude 
of the decline of seroconversion with age. As shown in the table, the proportion of seroconverters fell by 
about 8 percentage points between the ages of 20 and 60, or about two percentage points per decade.

a Two subjects in the lot consistency trial were 46 years old and included in the 39-45 age range. 
The other set of results in Table 30 is from a comparison between older adults and the younger adults in the 
challenge trial. Like the comparison to the lot consistency trial, the comparison to the challenge trial also 
showed good agreement between age groups. Specifically, classical Inaba antibody seroconversion in older 
adults was 0.1 percentage points higher than in younger adults with a 95% CI of [-6.8%, 7.0%].

Bridging analysis between studies in adults and children >6 and <18 years of age 
The PXVX-VC-200-006 clinical study was conducted using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 
single-crossover design with two treatment groups across 3 of which Cohorts 1 and 2 discussed in this report 
are shown in Figure 9. The primary endpoint of the study was Seroconversion Rate at Day 11: the proportion 
of subjects achieving seroconversion of serum vibriocidal antibody (SVA) against the classical Inaba biotype 
of V. cholerae at Day 11 following one dose of PXVX0200, defined as a 4-fold or greater rise over baseline 
Day 1 SVA titre. The secondary endpoint was seroconversion of SVA against V. cholerae at Day 29 for all 
subjects and additionally at Days 91 and 181 for Cohort 1 subjects. Interim data from the PXVX-VC-002-006

clinical study addresses bridging of  seroconversion and immunogenicity between adults in the Lot 
consistence clinical study PXVX-VC-200-004 and children >6 to <18 years.  
Table 31 shows that healthy males and non-pregnant females between the ages of 2 and <18 years who had 
no previous history of cholera were recruited. A total of 559 participants >2 years to <18 years of age were 
enrolled, however, for this application data was provided for 381 participants aged >6 to <18 years. The 
groups were divided according to age ranges >12 to <18 years of age (Cohort 1) and >6 to <12 years of age 
(Cohort 2).

a  Analysis of Cohort 3 as well as crossover experience with PXVX0200 for the Day 181 treatment are not included in the 
interim report since they are not included in the indication. 
Of the 381 subjects, 52.0% of subjects were male and 48.0% were female. 65.1% of the enrolled subjects 
were white, 24.9% were black or African American, 1.3% were Asian, 0.5% were American Indian or Alaska 
Native, and 8.1% were multiple races. The median age was 12.0 (range 6 to <18) years, with each age

group represented. Other than age (and growth associated with age), the demographic and other baseline 
characteristics of the treatment groups and cohorts were similar. 
PXVX0200 used for dosing in the vaccine group of the paediatric study had a potency range of approximately 
8.9 x 108 CFUs to 7.7 x 108 CFUs. By comparison, the PXVX0200 product used in the 004 adult study 
maintained a potency range of approximately 1.4 x 109 CFUs to 9.0 x 108 CFUs. 
The Bridging Population comprised all subjects in the PXVX-VC-200-006 Immunogenicity Evaluable 
Population along with subjects vaccinated with PXVX0200 in the Immunogenicity Evaluable Population from 
the adult PXVX0200 lot consistency trial PXVX-VC-200-004. These were participants that had received the 
vaccine dose, and had SVA results at Day 1 and Day 11 within the required window.  
The two primary objectives were met for both Cohorts 1 and 2; the paediatric age groups were non-inferior 
to the 004 adult study subjects in their rate of seroconversion and achieved the minimum 70% 
seroconversion rate required to show success. 
In summary, both primary and secondary immunogenicity data show: 
• 
At Day 11, 98.8% and 96.6% of vaccine recipients in Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, had 
seroconverted. These rates met the non-inferiority criterion in comparison to the adult Bridging 
Population and were significantly higher than the Placebo seroconversion rates (0% and 4.2%, 
respectively). 
• 
By Day 29, the cumulative seroconversion rate was 99.4% for Cohort 1 and remained 96.6% for 
Cohort 2. Again, these rates were significantly higher than the respective Placebo seroconversion 
rates (0% and 8.3%, respectively). These findings show that, overall, 98.1% of the pediatric 
PXVX0200 subjects reached the level associated with efficacy as defined for the adult Bridging 
Population. 
• 
The geometric mean fold-increase across both cohorts showed a sizeable increase in vibriocidal 
antibody production as well; at Day 11, the geometric mean fold-increase in antibodies was 245.3 
times baseline and at Day 29 the mean fold-increase was 67.9. By Days 91 and 181, mean fold-
increase values were 9.9 and 5.7. As a comparison, the mean fold increase for both Placebo groups 
was approximately 1.0(no mean change over baseline). This decline from Day 11 to Day 181 is 
consistent with previous studies of PXVX0200 and also consistent with a shift toward gastrointestinal 
antibody production (Kollaritsch 2000). 
The impact of baseline titre on SVA seroconversion 
Since seroconversion of vibriocidal antibodies against classical Inaba is so closely linked to protection against 
moderate/severe cholera, the behaviour of said seroconversion as a function of Day 1 vibriocidal titre was 
explored graphically to provide further insight into the implications of different possible values of the Day 1 
titre. Figure 10 is based upon the data from the vaccine recipients in the lot consistency trial and depicts the 
logistic regression curve for the model with seroconversion at Day 11 as the response variable and Day 1 
titre as the sole covariate. 
Also shown in the figure are the raw, model-free estimates of seroconversion with corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals for each value of the Day 1 titre that was observed in at least 40 vaccine recipients. The 
figure illustrates that Day 1 titre has an appreciable impact upon the proportion of seroconverters only at 
relatively high pre-vaccination titres that occur infrequently in a cholera-naïve population. For example, after 
stratifying the vaccine recipients into groups based upon their Day 1 titre, it is observed that the raw 
Assessment report

Page 68/111 
  
  
conditional estimate of seroconversion exceeds 90% in each group for which the Day 1 titre is ≤640, and that 
95% of the vaccine recipients have Day 1 titres ≤ 640 and fall into one of these high-converting groups. 
In summary, Figure 10 shows that the higher the baseline titre, the potential to achieve seroconversion (4-
fold increase from baseline) is reduced.

model-free 95% confidence intervals – Lot Consistency Trial 
Assessing potential associations between race and SVA response to Classical Inaba in PXVX0200 
clinical studies 
White race was associated with higher serum classical Inaba vibriocidal antibody titre at Day 11 compared 
with black or African American (p=0.0005). The geometric mean ratio comparing Day 11 titres between 
whites and black or African Americans was estimated to be 1.300 [1.122, 1.506] from the linear model that 
combined data across all trials and adjusted for other covariates including baseline titre. The largest 
difference between the two races was observed in the challenge trial.  
The higher absolute titres observed in whites did not confer a statistically significant advantage in 
seroconversion – the immune marker used for immunobridging – over black or African Americans 
(p=0.5482). In fact, blacks or African Americans had a slight numerical advantage in seroconversion over 
whites in the lot consistency and older adult trials, which together accounted for almost 97% of the 3067 
subjects included in the logistic regression analysis. 
Although the number of subjects tested was smaller, the pattern of significantly higher titres in whites was 
repeated for the other three vibriocidal antibody strains. In contrast to the classical Inaba assay, the 
advantage among whites in titre was large enough in the El Tor Inaba and classical Ogawa assays to lead to a 
significant edge in seroconversion (p=0.0044 and 0.0104, respectively).

Assessing potential associations between sex and SVA response to Classical Inaba in PXVX0200 
clinical studies 
Men exhibited significantly higher Day 11 classical Inaba vibriocidal antibody titres than women (p<0.0001) 
although the difference was not large in absolute terms; specifically, the geometric mean ratio of men’s titres 
to women’s was 1.157 [1.020, 1.312]. That is, men’s classical Inaba vibriocidal tiers were about 15.7% 
higher than women’s. The difference in titre between men and women was not large enough to yield a 
significant difference in seroconversion (p=0.2353).  
Similar trends, with men generally reaching higher titres than women, emerged from the analyses of the 
heterologous vibriocidal strains but none of the differences were significant except for El Tor Ogawa 
(p=0.0460). No significant differences in seroconversion were observed among the heterologous strains. 
Assessing potential associations between blood type and SVA response to Classical Inaba in 
PXVX0200 clinical studies 
Blood type O has previously been associated with more severe V. cholera infection. It was therefore 
important to assess the potential impact of this blood type on disease outcome following vaccination.  
Vaccine recipients with blood type O had significantly higher classical Inaba vibriocidal titres (p=0.0421) than 
vaccine recipients with non-O blood types, but the difference was modest, similar in magnitude to the 
difference between sexes. Specifically, the geometric mean ratio of blood type O to non-O was 1.138 [1.005, 
1.288]. The difference in GMTs was not large enough to produce a significant difference in seroconversion 
(p=0.1835). 
B-cell memory responses and duration of protection - Bridging Analysis Comparing anti-O1 LPS 
IgA Memory B-cells between Older and Younger Adults in all Phase 3 Trials 
An exploratory immunogenicity objective in the challenge, lot consistency, and older adult trials was to 
characterize the memory B cell response in order to determine whether memory B cells collected on Days 91 
and 181 could provide information about the persistence of protection.  
The Challenge study had shown a statistically significant association between the post-vaccination/pre-
challenge percentage of anti-O1 LPS IgA memory B cell percentage on Day 91 and total post-challenge 
diarrhoeal volume in vaccine recipients (Spearman correlation = -0.39, p = 0.02, n = 33), suggesting that 
IgA memory B cell levels are associated with outcome. 
The mean and median percentages and median fold-rises of anti-O1 LPS IgA memory B cells among all IgA 
memory B cells on Days 1, 91, and 181 were measured for vaccine recipients in the Immune Sub-study 
Populations from the challenge, lot consistency, and older adult trials. Significant increases from day 1 to day 
181  were noted in the Challenge (median 2.1 fold increase [95% CI: 1.2, 6.6] p=0.001, n= 22) and older 
adults (median 2.0 fold increase [95% CI: 1.5, 4.1] p=0.0009, n= 34) , but not for the Lot consistency 
immune substudy population (median 0.9 fold increase [95% CI: 0.5, 1.9] p=0.8831, n=23). However, in a 
pooled analysis of the immune substudy populations LPS-specific IgA percentages increased by 1.5-fold 
(p=0.0012, n=93) between Day 1 and Day 91 and exhibited a similar increase of 1.6-fold (p <0.0001, n = 
79) between Day 1 and Day 181.  
Additional bridging analyses then compared anti-O1 LPS IgA memory B cells in adults 46-64 years of age 
with younger adults 18-45 years of age from both the challenge and lot consistency trials. The anti- O1 LPS 
IgA memory B cell percentage was 0.08 [0.01%, 0.18%] percentage points higher in vaccine recipients from 
the older adult trial compared with those from the challenge trial on Day 91, and 0.12 [0.03%, 0.19%] points

higher at Day 181. The analogous differences between vaccine recipients from the older trial and those from 
the lot consistency trial were -0.03 [-0.15, 0.08] points at Day 91 and 0.03 [-0.06, 0.12] points at Day 181. 
The estimates from the logistic regression analysis with anti-O1 LPS IgA memory B cell outcome as the 
response identified baseline titre as an independent predictor of both Day 91 and Day 181 anti-O1 LPS IgA 
memory B cell percentage. In these models, higher baseline percentage was associated with higher post-
vaccination anti-O1 LPS IgA memory B cell percentages.

Phase 1, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-centre study in 
healthy young adult subjects 18–50 years old to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of one oral dose of live oral cholera vaccine. 
Immunogenicity was assessed with serum vibriocidal and anti-CT antibody 
responses measured before and 10, 14, and 28 days post-vaccination. 
To assess vaccine shedding and transmission, subjects were allocated to 
providing a fresh stool sample or having a rectal swab performed before 
Design 
vaccination and either on Days 1, 3, and 7 or on Days 2, 4, and 7 following 
vaccination. 
The possibility of transmission to household contacts (HHCs) residing with the 
study subject was also evaluated: HHCs were evaluated for shedding of 
PXVX0200 on Day 7 and for vibriocidal seroconversion on Day 28.

2.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
No clinical studies have been carried out in individuals aged 64 years of age and over.   
2.5.4.  Supportive studies 
The clinical trials conducted with Orochol by SSVI/Berna (Bern, Switzerland) aimed to evaluate vaccine 
immunogenicity, efficacy, safety and transmissibility to close contacts and the environment. Studies were 
performed in non-immune adult volunteers from industrialised countries such as North America and 
Switzerland. 
Separate studies were also performed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety among healthy adults and 
children (including infants) residing in countries where cholera was endemic. Study populations ranged from 
healthy adults and adolescents (16–56 years of age) to children (2–9 years of age), and infants (3–17 
months of age). Vaccinees were tested for shedding of CVD 103-HgR to determine the probability of releasing 
the organisms into the environment. Unvaccinated close contacts were monitored for seroconversion due to 
vaccine spread. Two field efficacy trials were conducted: in Jakarta (Richie 2000) and Pohnpei (Calain 2004). 
Generally, only healthy subjects were included in the Orochol studies with age ranges from healthy adults 
and adolescents (16–56 years of age) to children (2–9 years of age) and infants (3– 17 months of age), 
though one study evaluated safety and immunogenicity in HIV+ adults in Mali. Although vibriocidal titres 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 81/111 
  
  
 
were somewhat lower in HIV+ adults, compared to HIV- adults, no safety concerns were identified (Perry 
1998). 
Immunogenicity was evaluated by measuring serum vibriocidal (antibacterial) and anti-toxin antibody titres 
as both types of antibodies are associated with protection (Levine 1981, Glass 1985a). However, there was 
increasing evidence that antibacterial immunity is more important in cholera (Levine 1981, Levine 1979, 
Levine 1988b), therefore, serum vibriocidal antibodies became recognised as the best immune marker 
correlating with protection against cholera. This was confirmed in the PXVX-VC-200-003 study conducted by 
PaxVax using PXVX0200 (PaxVax Report PXVX-STAT-VIB-003). 
In the Orochol/Orochol E clinical trials, volunteers received vaccine doses ranging from 108 to 1010 CFU of 
live attenuated CVD 103-HgR bacteria. The marketed specification for Orochol was 2-10x108 CFU/dose and 
for Orochol E was 2-10x109 CFU/dose. Placebo recipients were given a single dose of 5x108 CFU of 
inactivated E. coli K12. Blood samples were collected prior to and on Days 10, 21 and 28 after administration 
of a single dose of the vaccine. Serum vibriocidal antibody titres against homologous (Inaba) or heterologous 
(Ogawa) serotypes were measured in a vibriocidal assay in vitro using complement. Seroconversion was 
defined as a ≥ 4-fold rise in vibriocidal antibody titres. Additionally, serum levels of IgG to cholera toxin were 
measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Seroconversion of antitoxin antibodies was 
defined as a ≥4-fold rise in titre or an increase of net optical density of ≥0.2 (CSL 2000). 
In early open-label studies in the US, high seroconversion rates for vibriocidal antibodies were observed after 
the administration of a single 3–5x108 CFU dose of CVD 103-HgR (94 %–100 % of volunteers had a ≥ to 4-
fold increase in Inaba vibriocidal antibody titres, Levine 1988a). The antitoxin response was similar to the 
vibriocidal response with 83 %–100 % of vaccinees seroconverting. Further studies were performed in the US 
and Switzerland and confirmed that in previously non-immune individuals from industrialized countries CVD 
103-HgR is a potent immunogen, stimulating a significant rise in Inaba vibriocidal antibodies in 81–97 % of 
vaccinees (Kotloff 1992, Tacket 1999, Cryz 1990, Cryz 1992, Cryz 1995b). A slightly lower but good 
seroconversion rate (67 %) was observed in a study performed in US military personnel in Panama wherein 
40 % of participants had elevated levels of baseline immunity to V. cholerae O1 (Taylor 1999). 
Compared with seroconversion for Inaba vibriocidal antibodies, slightly lower rates were observed for 
heterologous Ogawa vibriocidal antibodies (53 %–68 %) (Cryz 1990, Cryz 1993, Taylor 1999). The studies 
also showed that a single 5x108 CFU dose elicited significant rise in serum antitoxin levels (51–100 %). The 
cholera antitoxin response was measured using an ELISA with serum tested at a 1:50 final dilution (Cryz 
1990). These results support the use of CVD 103-HgR to generate an immune response against V. cholerae 
O1 in persons from developed countries where cholera is not endemic. 
Studies were also conducted in subjects from countries with endemic/epidemic cholera. Unlike the US and 
Switzerland, seroconversion rates were generally lower in individuals who were administered 5x108 CFU dose 
of the vaccine. Two Thai trials were conducted, one showing higher seroconversion rates (92 %) (Migasena 
1989) and the other showing lower rates (25–33 %) (Su Arehawaratana 1992). The latter study was in Thai 
soldiers. Further investigation showed a direct correlation between socioeconomic status of the recipients and 
the proportion with vibriocidal seroconversion was related to poor living conditions and sanitation. Two 
possible explanations were hypothesized: exposure to V. cholerae causing the subjects to exhibit elevated 
baseline titres of vibriocidal antibodies which do not increase dramatically in response to a 5 x 108 CFU dose; 
and increased levels of small intestinal microflora in lower socioeconomic group subjects. This was also shown 
in studies conducted in Peru (Gotuzzo 1993). These findings are consistent with studies with other vaccines, 
particularly orally administered vaccines, which suggest that antibody responses and efficacy are diminished 
in vaccinees in developing countries, leading to a need for higher doses in those countries (Levine 2010). 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 82/111 
  
  
Accordingly, a 10-fold higher dose was used in clinical trials in cholera-endemic countries. Using this higher 
dose (subsequently marketed as Orochol E; specification 2 x 109 to 1 x 1010 CFU/dose), significantly greater 
rates of Inaba vibriocidal antibody seroconversion were observed. Thus, use of PXVX0200 in indigenous 
populations for prevention of endemic or epidemic cholera will require formulations with higher dosages. 
Therefore, it would not be appropriate to evaluate efficacy of the current PXVX0200 formulation/dosage 
(specification 5 x 108 to 2 x 109 CFU/dose) aimed at persons from non-endemic countries as a preventative 
vaccine for endemic cholera. 
The protective efficacy of Orochol was assessed in a series of studies in healthy adult subjects in the US and 
Switzerland. The subjects received a single, oral dose of 3–5 x 108 CFU of CVD 103-HgR and were 
subsequently challenged with pathogenic wild-type V. cholerae O1 of homologous (classical) or heterologous 
(El Tor) biotypes. Challenge organisms were administered at a dose which normally elicits diarrhoea. Controls 
received an initial dose of placebo (5 x 108 CFU inactivated E. coli K12) or were unvaccinated prior to 
challenge. Post challenge, the subjects were monitored for the onset of or protection from V. cholerae -
induced diarrhoea. Diarrhoea was defined as the passage of 2 or more unformed stools of ≥200 ml or a 
single stool of ≥300 ml over a 48-hour period. Moderate cholera cases were those who passed at least 3 l of 
diarrheal stool over the study period. Severe cases were those who excreted at least 5 l. 
The challenge studies in North American and Swiss volunteers demonstrated that vaccination conferred 
significant protection against diarrhoea due to cholera. Cholera-induced diarrhoea was prevented in 100 % of 
individuals challenged with the classical V. cholerae O1 serotype Inaba (Tacket 1992). Protection was 
observed as early as 8 days after vaccination and continued until 6 months post vaccination (Tacket 1992). 
In subjects who were challenged with the heterologous El Tor biotype, the majority of the vaccinees (54–80 
%) were protected from cholera diarrhoea at 1–3 months post-vaccination (Levine 1988a, Tacket 1999). In 
vaccinees who developed diarrhoea, the disease was mild. For a more clinically meaningful evaluation of the 
efficacy of a cholera vaccine it is important to look at the severity of the disease. Orochol provided 95 % 
protective efficacy against moderate and 92 % protective efficacy against severe diarrhoea caused by 
cholera. 
An ambitious placebo-controlled study in 67,508 subjects was conducted in Jakarta between July 1993 and 
December 1997 to examine the protective efficacy of Orochol against endemic V. cholerae O1 El Tor (Richie 
2000). The vaccine did not confer significant protection over the 4-year follow-up (13.5 % efficacy), but did 
have a modest efficacy in blood group O recipients (45 %). Unfortunately, too few cases (7 total: 5 in 
controls, 2 in vaccinees, giving a point estimate of efficacy of 60 %) occurred in the first four months of 
follow-up after vaccination to allow a valid comparison with the previous studies using adult volunteers. 
This field trial was carried out in a crowded urban setting where the annual incidence of cholera prior to the 
trial had been > 1 case per 1000 for several years and where there was very high community participation in 
the trial. Following the large-scale field trial, the incidence of cholera rapidly fell. One explanation for the 
disappointing results is that the live vaccine led to widespread indirect protection (herd immunity) as well as 
direct protection that caused the incidence to plummet even in the control group and removed the ability to 
detect vaccine efficacy. This scenario has been reported in relation to a re-analysis of the field trial of oral 
inactivated cholera vaccine in Bangladesh in the 1980s and it may also apply to the Indonesia trial of CVD 
103-HgR (Ali 2005). 
In 2000, an outbreak of V. cholerae O1 El Tor cholera in Pohnpei, Micronesia led the government there, with 
the support of the WHO, to request a donation of 48,000 doses of Orochol E. This was used in a vaccination 
campaign covering 47 % of the total population in Pohnpei State (estimated 14,587 persons vaccinated). A 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 83/111 
  
  
retrospective evaluation of the outcome of vaccination was then conducted. Of the subsequent 344 evaluable 
cases of cholera, 50 had been vaccinated more than 10 days before illness and 294 were non-vaccinated. The 
overall estimated protective efficacy was 79.2 % (95 % CI: 71.9-84.6 %) (Calain 2004). This result was 
more consistent with the data from cholera challenge studies than with the result from the trial in Jakarta, 
and demonstrated that a single dose of CVD 103-HgR given promptly at a suitable dose (Orochol E) can be 
effective in curtailing cholera outbreaks in endemic areas. 
In addition to immunogenicity and protective efficacy, the safety of Orochol was also assessed in many of the 
clinical trials. Vaccinees were monitored for adverse reactions 7–9 days after the ingestion of 108 to 1010 
CFU of CVD 103-HgR. Successful attenuation of CVD 103-HgR would enable administration of the vaccine 
without eliciting diarrhoea in vaccinees. This was confirmed in numerous trials where up to 1010 CFU did not 
elicit diarrhoea in vaccinees at a rate greater than the inactivated E. coli K12 used as placebo. Other adverse 
reactions such as fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting were also monitored. CVD 103-HgR did not exhibit 
significantly higher rates of these AEs compared to placebo (bacteriological media). AEs were transient and 
mild and possibly occurred due to the sodium bicarbonate buffer. 
Since Orochol contained the recombinant CVD 103-HgR bacterial strain, transmissibility was monitored to 
evaluate the possible release of organisms into the environment; therefore, the excretion in stools of 
vaccinees was monitored. The strain contained in the vaccine was minimally excreted with a geometric mean 
number of 200 V. cholerae per gram of stool (Levine 1988a). Data from clinical trials have demonstrated that 
not more than 30 % of V. cholerae CVD 103-HgR recipients excrete detectable numbers of the modified 
bacteria, with excretion lasting for a maximum of 7 days (Levine 1988a, Cryz 1995, Kotloff 1992, 
Simanjuntak 1993, Lagos 1999). Given that the infectious dose of cholera is up to 108 CFU, (except in 
individuals who produce less stomach acid, such as young children, the elderly and those who take antacids, 
who may be infected by approximately 104 CFU [Kitaoka 2011]), mean shedding of approximately 2.6 x 104 
CFU of vaccine bacteria (assuming an average stool weight of 128 g [Rose 2015]) by a vaccine recipient is 
unlikely to translate into an infection in another person. A dose of 105 CFU of virulent V. cholerae was used in 
volunteer challenge studies, but was given in conjunction with buffer to neutralize gastric acid and therefore 
improve the possibility of a successful infection. 
Transmission to close contacts was monitored in one Indonesian study where pairs of children in the same 
household were given either vaccine or placebo. The vaccine strain was not recovered from placebo recipients 
indicating no transmission had occurred from vaccinees to controls. 
CVD 103-HgR was isolated from only 1 out of 174 other family contacts (Simanjuntak 1993). This is 
particularly relevant since the study was performed in a cholera-endemic country in a paediatric population 
where faecal spread is high (ages 24–59 months), living in conditions of poor sanitation. A similar study with 
pairs of children in the same household conducted in Chile (Lagos 1996) also demonstrated a low rate of 
shedding and transmissibility, with 5 % of unvaccinated contacts shown to shed vaccine strain bacteria. 
Moore swabs (4 cm thick gauze rolls attached to a nylon string) were used in an attempt to isolate the CVD 
103-HgR cholera vaccine strain from toilets and sewers near 97 households of people who had received the 
vaccine. This study was undertaken in an area of Indonesia where cholera is endemic (Simanjuntak 1993). 
Samples were taken from where the household effluent entered the sewage drains and from toilets. The 
vaccine strain was not isolated from any of the samples. Non-O1 V. cholerae (i.e. strains other than the 
vaccine strain) were isolated from 46 of the samples.

2.5.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Vaxchora (PXVX0200) is a live attenuated vaccine based on V. cholerae serogroup O1, Classical biotype, 
serotype Inaba. PXVX0200 is indicated for active immunisation against disease caused by Vibrio cholerae 
serogroup O1 in adults and children aged 6 years and older, and should be used in accordance with official 
recommendations. The PXVX0200 clinical development program was designed to demonstrate safety and 
efficacy of the PXVX0200 vaccine as a new entity. Data derived from previous studies of the Orochol vaccine 
could be considered supportive. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Design and conduct of clinical studies were considered overall acceptable. 
A phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled (1:1 ratio) clinical study (PXVX-VC-200-300) showed 
that immunisation with PXVX0200 provided protective efficacy against challenge with wild type V. cholerae 
O1, El Tor biotype, serotype Inaba in adults aged 18-45 years. The co-primary objective/endpoint was to 
demonstrate that the lower 95% confidence bound on the protective efficacy of a single dose of PXVX0200 
was ≥30% following challenge 10 and 90 days post-vaccination respectively.  
Although 197 participants were randomised in the PXVX-VC-200-300 challenge study, the participants were 
ultimately divided into six groups of with a minimum of 27 and a maximum of 36 participants per group. The 
efficacy evaluation was based on the groups that were challenged with V. cholera, which consisted of 35/33 
(vaccine/placebo) participants challenged 10 days post-vaccination and 33/33 (vaccine/placebo) participants 
challenged 3-months post-vaccination. The group size for the efficacy evaluation was therefore small, but 
sufficient for the statistical analysis. Protective efficacy data from these groups was used as a basis to bridge 
immunogenicity data from a large Lot consistency trial (PXVX-VC-200-004) in adults having the same age 
range as the challenge study (18-45 years) with analysable samples for baseline and Day 11 in 3021 
participants. Since the large Lot consistency study showed comparable (non-inferior) seroconversion 
frequency (93.5%) compared to the challenge study (90.3%) at Day 11, subsequent clinical studies in older 
adults (46-64 years) and children (>6-18 years) bridged their immunogenicity seroconversion frequencies to 
this study. In contrast to the challenge study which used a dose of 5 x 108 CFU, the Lots consistency study 
and the studies in older adults used a higher dose of PXVX0200 (1 x 109) which may have led to greater 
antigen exposure following PXVX0200 replication. The study in children was a phase 4 study and used the 
dose range in children >6 years as defined in the FDA approved Vaxchora SmPC (4 x 108 to 2 x 109 CFU).   
Serum vibriocidal antibodies (SVA) seroconversion was predefined in the study protocol as >4-fold increase 
over baseline. Both SVA geometric mean titre (GMT) and fold-increase in titre from baseline were measured. 
Day 11 post-vaccination showed the highest GMT and fold increase over baseline in vaccinees but not 
placebo. Only two of 62 seroconverting Vaxchora recipients developed moderate cholera after challenge: 1 of 
33 at Day 11 and 1 of 29 at Day 91. Based on this near 1:1 relationship between seroconversion and 
protection, along with the fact that approximately 90% of Vaxchora recipients seroconverted, SVA 
seroconversion (>4-fold increase in titre from baseline) at Day 11 was used as the measure to correlate 
immunogenicity to disease severity and for establishing an immunobridge between populations.  
Seroconversion rates at Day 11 exceeded 90 % in all clinical studies, and notably after single oral dose. In 
the Challenge study (003), 94 % of subjects had seroconverted by Day 11 and 88 % by Day 91 88 %. The 
Protective Efficacy at Day 10 was 90.3 % and 79.5 % at Month 3. Comparing seroconverters with non-
seroconverters, 97 % were protected in the challenge at both time points. For non-seroconverters, 50% were 
protected at Day 11 challenge and 25% protected in the 3-month challenge group.

None of the clinical studies measured mucosal IgA antibodies in the intestinal tract induced following 
vaccination. This would have been an appropriate parameter since the site of cholera pathogenesis is the 
intestinal tract.  However, it is acknowledged it may be challenging to collect these samples adequately. 
Memory B-cell responses are considered as markers to address the duration of protection. The ELISPOT 
assay used to assess the reactivation of B-cell memory responses producing IgG and IgA antibodies to 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from V. cholerae (Inaba) and cholera toxin B (CTxB), respectively was qualified but 
not validated. The assays used mainly frozen peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBMC) as a source of memory B-
cells. Upon thawing, it is anticipated that thresholds for cell recovery and viability would be needed to allow 
for valid assay results. No criteria for recovery or viability upon thawing were used, but the cells were found 
to have acceptable viability. 
The efficacy clinical study recruited healthy adults. Inclusion criteria ensured that participants had not 
previously been exposed to V. cholerae, and did not have any immunosuppressive condition or 
gastrointestinal disease that could impact on immunogenicity or disease severity, which is acceptable as this 
is a live vaccine which needs to replicate in the gut to be effective. This would have excluded participants 
with known autoimmune conditions.  The use of the vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with congenital 
immune deficiency or receiving immunosuppressive drugs or treatments. At present, vaccination is 
recommended to be postponed for persons with acute gastrointestinal disease until after recovery. The SmPC 
section 4.4 additionally reflects that the degree of protection and the effects of vaccination in individuals with 
chronic gastrointestinal disease are unknown. 
Participants who were not allergic to antibiotics used to treat V. cholerae infection after challenge were 
selected. This is important in that the vaccine is not completely protective and antibiotic treatment may still 
be needed in addition to rehydration.   
The dose and choice of the challenge strain of V. cholerae was based on the dosage used previously for 
Orochol (Tacket 1999). The challenge strain was not homologous to Vaxchora (Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, 
biotype classical, serotype Inaba), but corresponded to a different biotype (Vibrio cholera serogroup O1. 
Biotype El Tor serotype Inaba, strain (N16961)). Although the challenge strain may not represent currently 
circulating strains, it is acceptable as a heterologous challenge since it represents the El Tor biotype, rather 
than the classical biotype of the vaccine. Vaccinated individuals may be exposed to either biotype when 
travelling to endemic regions. However, neither the vaccine, nor the challenge V. cholera included the Ogawa 
serotype which is also part of serogroup 01 and included in the Vaxchora indication. Serological analyses 
showed lower seroreactivity to the Ogawa serotypes suggestive of lower protection against these serotypes, 
which are also prevalent in cholera endemic areas.   
During the challenge part of the study, participants were in-patients and were monitored over a 10 day 
period or until disease-free. Oral hydration was started once diarrhoea was apparent (grade 3 stool) and 
antibiotics were given to all subjects 96 hours post-challenge (or sooner if they experienced cumulative 
diarrhoeal volume of >5 L) according to the protocol. Both oral rehydration and antibiotics represent standard 
treatment for cholera, and may therefore have influenced the efficacy primary endpoint which was protection 
against moderate/severe diarrhoea. Moderate diarrhoea was a cumulative stool output of >3L over the 10 
day in-patient period post-challenge, and severe diarrhoea was a cumulative stool output >5L. However for 
six of these 10 days, participants were treated with antibiotics. No viable challenge V. cholerae was shed 6 
days post-challenge in the placebo group. The placebo group shed higher levels of challenge V. cholera in 
stool (median peak of 3.15 x 107CFU/g over 10 days) than the vaccinated group (median peak of 1.355 x 105 
CFU/g over 10 days). The lack of shedding from 5-6 days post-challenge cannot be attributed to immune 
responses induced by the vaccine.

Based on previous results with Orochol, PXVX0200 should not be taken concurrently with anti-malaria 
medication chloroquine. Based on data from Orochol, it is apparent that this is not a feature of other anti-
malarial drugs. No clinical studies are included that assess the concomitant use of PXVX0200 with particularly 
oral vaccines such as vaccines protecting against typhoid fever and polio. Data from Orochol are cited in the 
SmPC, which is acceptable as they are relevant for PXVX0200.   
There is no clinical data available from persons living in cholera endemic regions, and use in persons coming 
from cholera endemic countries is not planned. This would include travellers and tourists (of all ages and their 
children), aid workers and military personnel. Currently, the WHO position paper (2017) regarding cholera 
vaccination has the following recommendation for international workers and travellers: “Vaccination is not 
generally recommended for long-term or short-term travellers to cholera-affected countries, but should be 
guided by specific travel risks”. Whilst for healthcare workers, the following is recommended: “OCV (oral 
cholera vaccine) should be considered for emergency and relief workers who are likely to be directly exposed 
to cholera patients or to contaminated food or water, particularly those staying in areas with poor access to 
health-care facilities. Other health-care workers are generally not at special risk of cholera.” Persons in non-
endemic regions may also be exposed to V. cholerae through occupation or through contaminated 
food/water. The vaccine could therefore be used in regions within the EU that may be subject to a cholera 
outbreak.  
Information reflecting the fact that no data are available in persons living in cholera-affected areas or in 
individuals with pre-existing immunity to cholera has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC because the 
efficacy of Vaxchora in these individuals has not been established (see also section 3.7.2). The historical 
experience with CVD 103-HgR suggests that a higher dose may be necessary in this population. However, 
this gap in knowledge is not immediately relevant for a European population since cholera is not endemic in 
any region within the EU. In lack of such data, the vaccine is only recommended in travellers.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The co-primary objective and endpoint of the challenge study (PXVX-VC-200-300) was to demonstrate that 
the lower 95% confidence bound on the protective efficacy of a single dose of PXVX0200 was ≥30% following 
challenge at 10 and 90 days post-vaccination respectively. The study showed that participants challenged 10 
days post-vaccination achieved a protective efficacy against moderate/severe diarrhoea of 90.3% [95% CI: 
82.4%, 95.5%] whilst participants challenged 3-months post-vaccination showed a protective efficacy of 
79.5% [95% CI: 49.9%, 100.0%]. The lower CI was 62.7% for participants challenged 10 days post-
vaccination and 49.9% for participants challenged at 3-months post-vaccination. The study thereby met its 
co-primary objectives/endpoints.  
Given the enrichment aiming at approximately 60 % of subjects with blood type O (as they may be 
predisposed to develop cholera disease of a greater severity than those with blood group A and/or B 
antigens), it is acknowledged that efficacy irrespective of blood type stratum was shown to be similar (among 
subjects with blood type O only, the 10-Day protective efficacy (PXVX0200 vs combined placebo) was 84.8 % 
(lower 95.1 % CI bound 50.2 %) with a 3-Month protective efficacy of 78.4 % (lower 95 % CI bound 44.0 
%); among subjects with non-O blood types only, the 10-Day efficacy was 100.0 % (lower 95 % CI bound 
48.1 %) and the 3-Month PE was 83.5 % (lower 95 % CI bound 20.5 %)). 
In the Challenge Study (PXVX-VC-200-003), the combined placebo group served as comparator in all 
analyses. Seen as some evidence that the use of a combined placebo group is appropriate is the observation 
that the attack rate of post-challenge moderate/severe diarrhoea in placebo recipients in the 10-day 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 87/111 
  
  
challenge and 3-month challenge respectively have been found to be very similar: 60.6 % (20/33) in the 10-
day challenge group compared with 57.6 % (19/33) in the 3-month challenge group.  
Cholera is an infection of the digestive tract mucosal membranes leading to diarrhoea. Protection was 
correlated to serum vibriocidal antibodies (SVA) assay, which detect functional antibodies that bind 
complement resulting in lysis of V. cholera (vibriolysis). As such, SVA assay detects predominantly serum IgM 
antibodies which are associated with primary immune responses, and peak between 7- 14 days after antigen 
exposure. SVA seroconversion (pre-defined as a >4-fold increase from baseline) at Day 11 post-vaccination 
was considered to be a more reliable immune marker correlating with protection compared to SVA geometric 
mean titre (GMT) alone, because it took into consideration baseline levels and corresponded to the time when 
SVA levels were at their peak. However, two individuals that seroconverted nevertheless experienced 
moderate diarrhoea (>3L cumulative stool volume over 10 days). It is not clear if a different increment in 
SVA from baseline would correlate better with protection.  
PXVX0200 vaccination did not completely prevent diarrhoea following challenge with virulent V. cholerae.  
The protective efficacy against mild or worse diarrhoea was 84.5% for those challenged 10-days post-
vaccination, and 50.8% for those challenged 3-months post-vaccination. This indicates that protective 
efficacy waned over time.  
There is currently no data in individuals >64 years of age. In the clinical study that included older 
participants, (aged 46-64 years of age – PXVX-VC-200-005), the seroconversion frequency and titre of SVA 
to Classical Inaba was observed to decline with advancing age (p=0.0136) as did the SVA titre (p<0.0001). 
Seroconversion rates in ages 46-52 were 92% [86%, 96%] and dropped to 87% [74%, 95%] in 60-64 year 
olds where the confidence interval was also wider. These observations may reflect immune senescence 
and/or the effect of pre-existing (baseline) cross-reactive antibodies since increased baseline levels of SVA 
reduced the potential for seroconversion (4-fold increase from baseline). Usually for vaccines, no upper age 
limit to the therapeutic indication is expected to be imposed unless there are specific concerns raised by the 
data in younger adults; it is considered sufficient to mention the limitations of the data in the SmPC. Cross-
protection to other biotypes and serotypes of V. cholera showed that the frequency of seroconversion at Day 
11 to the Ogawa serotypes (for both Classical and El Tor biotypes) was reduced compared to the Inaba 
serotypes in individuals aged 18-45 in the Challenge study (n=94)  (Classical Ogawa 87.1% [78.5%, 
93.2%]; El Tor Ogawa 89.2% [81.1%, 94.7%]) and especially so in participants 46-64 years of age (n=291) 
(Classical Ogawa  73.2% [67.7%, 78.2%]; El Tor Ogawa 71.4% [65.8%, 76.5%]. These data and 
information about the lack of data in participants >64 years of age is included in section 5.1 and 4.4 of SmPC 
and is considered acceptable.  
The attenuated V. cholerae vaccine strain was not as effective as the virulent challenge strain in inducing SVA 
responses. Twenty eight days following challenge, the combined placebo group (n=66) had a SVA geometric 
mean titre of 17,409 compared to the 10 day challenge group (n=35), which had a GMT of 2460 (p<0.0001), 
and the 3-month challenge group (n=33) a GMT of 1646.9 (p<0.0001) at the same time point. Similarly, the 
percentage of participants with a 4-fold rise in SVA 28 days post-challenge was 5.7% for the 10 day 
challenge group and 60.6% for the 3-month challenge group compared to placebo where 97% participants 
showed a 4-fold increase in titre. The post-challenge SVA against different biotypes and serotypes was 
similarly greater in the placebo group compared to the vaccine group. Again, responses against the Ogawa 
serotypes were lower than those against the Inaba serotypes as was observed for pre-challenge SVA 
antibodies. For the placebo group, the challenge corresponded to their first exposure to V. cholerae. The 
potential mechanisms underlying these observations and the implications of these findings with respect to the 
potential for re-vaccination (booster immunisations) have been discussed by the Applicant, where re-boosting 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 88/111 
  
  
is not considered to increase SVA. No re-boosting studies are planned and the interval for potential re-
vaccination remains unknown as described in the SmPC.  
The duration of protection provided by PXVX0200 is not known and no studies have been carried out to 
determine when re-vaccination (booster immunisations) would be required. This is of particular importance 
for aid workers who may stay in endemic regions beyond three months, or may return a year or so later. 
Furthermore, the lower SVA response post-challenge amongst vaccinees raises the question as to whether 
SVA (which detects predominantly serum IgM) represents a suitable parameter for measuring secondary 
immune responses and if remaining immunity could prevent a secondary response. Scientific advice in 2012 
recommended a second study with challenge at 6-months, but this could be done in the post-approval period. 
In a 2017 scientific advice to the Applicant, the CHMP maintained that the duration of protection could not be 
concluded based upon currently available data and that a challenge study at six months post-vaccination 
would provide the best possible data on the duration of protection. However, the CHMP acknowledged that a 
challenge study is an artificial situation and may not entirely reflect field exposure to cholera. The CHMP 
therefore concluded that it was acceptable not to conduct a challenge study at six months post vaccination. 
The uncertainties with regards to duration of protection will be described in the SmPC. Earlier work with 
Orochol inferred duration of protection in a revaccination study where participants were re-vaccinated 2.5 
and 3.5 years later. While the duration of protection beyond 6 months against challenge with wild-type V. 
cholerae remains unknown, the Applicant considers that individuals with pre-existing immunity to V. cholerae 
are not likely to be further boosted after re-immunisation with CVD 103-HgR (Orochol). This is because pre-
existing immunity will remove the live attenuated vaccine used to boost immunity, thereby reducing its 
potential for effect. 
A fold-increase from Day 1 to Day 91 in the percentage of anti-LPS IgA memory B cells was found to be 
associated with total diarrhoeal volume (Spearman correlation=-0.56, p<0.001, n=33) in the challenge 
study. However, B-cell memory responses were based on an ELISPOT assay that was qualified but not 
validated. The assay was based on frozen cells and thresholds for cell recovery and viability were not 
provided, no criteria for assay validity. The findings are therefore preliminary. An increase in IgA B-cell 
memory responses to O1 lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from baseline to day 91 showed some correlation with 
total post challenge stool volume in the 3-month challenge group study. Significant increases in anti-O1 LPS 
IgA were also observed from baseline to day 91 and day 181 respectively when pooling eligible samples from 
all clinical studies, however these participants were not challenged. It is therefore not possible to correlate 
these findings to efficacy.  
The frequency of SVA seroconversion to V. cholerae Classical Inaba was non-inferior in older adults <64 
years when compared to younger adults (18-45 years) in the Lot consistency study, and slightly higher in 
children >6 – 18 years. A non-inferior frequency of seroconversion could suggest similar protective efficacy, 
however the frequency of seroconversion declines with advancing age. The higher frequency of 
seroconversion in children could reflect the lack of prior exposure to cross-reactive antigens from other 
enteric bacteria.  
Baseline characteristics for the challenge clinical study showed a greater number of black/African American 
participants compared to white participants. However, these groups were more balanced in subsequent 
pooled analyses assessing immunogenicity and the frequency of seroconversion. Combining data from all 
studies, whites were associated with a higher serum vibriocidal antibody titre to classical Inaba at Day 11 
compared to black or African American (p=0.0005), but this did not provide any statistically significant 
advantage in seroconversion.   
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 89/111 
  
  
In the challenge study there was a greater number of men compared to women participants, although in 
subsequent studies were more balanced. Men exhibited approximately 15.7% higher Day 11 SVA titres 
against classical Inaba than women (p<0.0001), although the difference was not large enough to yield 
significant differences in seroconversion (p= 0.2353). 
Vaccine recipients with blood type O had significantly higher classical Inaba vibriocidal titres (p=0.0421) than 
vaccine recipients with non-O blood types, but the difference was modest, similar in magnitude to the 
difference between sexes. Specifically, the geometric mean ratio of blood type O to non-O was 1.138 [1.005, 
1.288]. The difference in GMTs was not large enough to produce a significant difference in seroconversion 
(p=0.1835). 
2.5.6.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy data show that a single administration of PXVX0200 (5 x 108 CFU) induces a protective 
effect against moderate/severe diarrhoea of 90.3% upon challenge 10 days post-vaccination and 79.5% at 3-
months post-vaccination in adults 18-45 years of age.  
A pre-defined serum vibriocidal antibody (SVA) seroconversion rate (>4-fold increase in titre from baseline) 
represented an immune marker that correlated with protection to support immunobridging to younger and 
older age groups. SVA were detected using a functional assay involving complement-mediated bacteriolysis. 
Bridging analysis showed that SVA seroconversion rates in adults 18-45 years from a large Lot consistence 
clinical trial (n=3146) were non-inferior to seroconversion rates in the Challenge study. Seroconversion rates 
in older adults (46-64 years of age) and children (6-18 years of age) were found to be non-inferior to 
seroconversion rates in the Lot consistency study. However, SVA seroconversion rates to the Ogawa serotype 
were consistently low when compared to the Inaba serotypes. Seroconversion rates declined with advancing 
age, and no data is available for individuals over the age of 64 years. Lack of data in individuals over 64 
years is included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. No major safety concerns were observed that could be 
considered to prevent the use of the vaccine in the elderly.  
The drop in protection against disease from challenge 10 days post-vaccination to 3 months post-vaccination 
is a concern. While 85.7% of subjects had no qualifying diarrhoea when challenged 10 days post-vaccination, 
the number decreased to 54.5% in participants challenged 3 months post-vaccination.  
The duration of protection is currently not known.  
In conclusion, Vaxchora has been shown to be immunogenic and its efficacy in preventing cholera has been 
documented in well-controlled vaccination and challenge clinical trial settings.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
2.6.1.  Patient exposure 
A total of 3235 adults have been exposed to Vaxchora (55 subjects exposed in a phase I study and 3180 
subjects in phase 3 studies). The safety database consists mainly of subjects from the Lot consistency trial 
(PXVX-VC-200-004, n=2789). In addition, 328 children aged 6-18 years, were exposed in a phase 4 study. 
In all cases, Vaxchora was administered as a single dose.  
An overview over clinical studies and overall exposure to Vaxchora, can be found in the table below. 
Table 37 Overview of Clinical Studies and Overall Exposure to Vaxchora 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 90/111 
  
  
Pooling strategy for safety analyses 
The Applicant-sponsored studies in adults (4 studies) were pooled to a total of 3235 subjects who received 
Vaxchora for integrated safety analyses. Integrated safety analyses of the adult trials do not include subjects 
included in the CVD 51000 trial published by Sow et al. 2017. CVD 51000 was an investigator-sponsored 
study, and the observed adverse event profile was consistent with that seen in the other trials of Vaxchora.  
The Applicant provided furthermore the Interim Clinical Study Report for the phase 4 paediatric trial PXVX-
VC-200-006, which contains safety analyses for 328 subjects who received Vaxchora included in cohorts 1 
(12 - < 18 years) and 2 (6- < 12 years) [cohort 3 (2 - < 6 years) was not included in the analysis]. The data 
cut-off for the paediatric study is 19 July 2018.  
2.6.2.  Adverse events (AEs) 
Safety assessment of the vaccine included evaluation of solicited AEs (reactogenicity) as well as unsolicited 
AEs (treatment-emergent AEs). Solicited AEs were assessed Day 1-7 following vaccination. Unsolicited AEs 
were assessed through day 29, but serious AEs (SAEs) were assessed through day 181.  
Solicited adverse events in adults 
Solicited AEs were reported by about 50% of vaccine recipients and about 46% of placebo recipients. 
Tiredness, headache and various gastrointestinal disorders were reported at a frequency ≥1/10 (very 
common) in both the vaccine and placebo groups. Of the specified symptoms, only diarrhoea occurred at a 
significantly increased frequency compared to placebo (3.63% in adult vaccine recipients vs. 1.63% in 
placebo recipients; p=0.0140). Most AEs were mild, occurred within 1-3 days following vaccination and 
decreased progressively thereafter. In children solicited AEs were reported by about 60% of the subjects both 
in vaccine and placebo recipients.

Unsolicited adverse events in adults 
Overall, for the one Phase 1 (through Day 181) and three Phase 3 trials (through Day 29), AEs were reported 
by 23.7% of vaccine recipients and 27.4% of placebo recipients and were mostly mild in severity. The three 
most common AEs with an incidence in the range of 2% (range of 2.1% to 3.2%) in both vaccine and placebo 
groups were headache, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection. No meaningful differences were 
observed between vaccine and placebo recipients in the incidence of AEs by PT or grouped by SOC. 
Differences in the incidence of AEs were not assessed for statistical significance.

safety population) 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 93/111 
  
  
 
In adults, the incidence of subjects with at least one unsolicited AE considered to be treatment-related was 
similar for the placebo group (8.5%) and the vaccine group (7.9%). The most frequent events by SOC were 
different gastrointestinal disorders, reported in 3.7% of subjects both in the vaccine- and placebo- group.  
For the paediatric population, the incidence of subjects with at least one unsolicited AE considered to be 
treatment-related, was higher for the vaccine group (14.6%) than for the placebo group (10.0%). Treatment 
related AEs in the group of solicited AEs occurred in high frequency in the paediatric population (47.3 % (V) 
vs. 44.0 % (P)). Abdominal pain (24.1 % vs 16.0 %), Lack of Appetite (17.7 % vs 12.0 %) and Vomiting 
(3.4 % vs 0 %) occurred more often in the vaccination arm than in the placebo arm. For both solicited and 
unsolicited AEs, data indicate that frequencies of AEs were in general higher for children than for adults. Also 
for children, the most frequent events by SOC were Gastrointestinal disorders such as abdominal pain, 
pyrexia, fatigue, headache and decreased appetite. These were more commonly observed in children 
compared to adults. Diarrhoea was more often observed in adults compared to children. 
The Tabulated summary of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC is based on a combination of the 
solicited and unsolicited AEs.

2.6.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
One death (suicide) occurred on day 85 in a vaccine recipient and was not considered to be related to the 
vaccine. Serious adverse events through Day 181 were uncommon. The reporting incidence of SAEs in adults 
was 0.6% for vaccine- and 0.5% for placebo-recipients. None of these events were considered to be related 
to vaccine or placebo. In the paediatric trial, no serious adverse events considered to be vaccine-related were 
reported.  
2.6.4.  Laboratory findings 
Clinical safety laboratory evaluations were performed at screening and Day 7 in the Phase 1 study and at 
screening in the challenge and older adult studies to ensure that subjects were healthy and eligible for study 
participation. No trends between pre-vaccination values on Day 1 and post-vaccination values on Day 7 were 
observed in the clinical safety laboratory evaluations in the Phase I trial. 
No clinical safety laboratory evaluations were performed in the paediatric trial. 
For the adult population shifts in pre and post vaccination vital signs (i.e. BP, Pulse, respiratory rate, 
temperature) were evaluated. Abnormal vital signs were graded using the Tables for Laboratory 
Abnormalities from Section III, Table B of the FDA Guidance for Industry, Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy 
Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials, [US FDA 2007]. No meaningful 
post-vaccination worsening was observed relative to placebo for vital signs or physical findings in the adult 
population. However, a few cases of hypokalaemia were noted in the vaccination arm.  
For the paediatric trial, vital signs were listed for each of the individuals for screening and for Day 1 (time 
point of inclusion). No post-vaccination vital signs were generated in this study.  
2.6.5.  Safety in special populations 
Elderly patients 
No data are available for patients ≥64 years. 
Pregnant women 
No animal data is available as the vaccine bacteria do not replicate in animal toxicology models. Pregnant 
women were excluded from the clinical trials. In the trials, 10 vaccine recipients were found to be pregnant 
following vaccination. Each pregnancy was followed to term and resulted in a healthy baby. One case was lost 
to follow-up. No safety signal has been detected so far.  
Immunocompromised subjects 
No data are available as immunocompromised subjects were excluded from the clinical trials. Vaxchora is 
contraindicated in individuals with congenital immune deficiency or receiving immunosuppressive drugs. The 
protection afforded by Vaxchora may be reduced in HIV-infected individuals, but this use is not 
contraindicated.  
Vaccine shedding and potential transmission to household contacts  
Shedding of the vaccine organism into stools of the vaccine recipients and potential transmission to their 
household contacts (HHCs) was studied in the Phase I trial (CSR PXVX-VC-200-002) during Day 1 to 7 
following vaccination. Shedding reached a peak on day 7 when it was detected in 7.3% (95% CI 2.0-17.6) of 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 95/111 
  
  
vaccine recipients. Cumulatively through to Day7 post-vaccination, shedding of vaccine virus occurred in a 
total of 11.3 % (95% CI 4.2-22.6) of vaccine recipients. Potential transmission of the vaccine organism from 
vaccine recipients to their HHCs was monitored via the detection of either shedding and/or serum vibriocidal 
antibodies in HHCs. No transmission to household contacts could be detected. 
The duration of shedding of the vaccine strain is unknown. However in a study of CVD 103-HgR in Mali (Perry 
1998), bacteriological test to detect vaccine virus shedding were taken the day of vaccination, then daily for 
the first 4 days and again on 6th and 12th days after dosing. The vaccine strain was not isolated from the co-
pro-cultures of any subjects. In a cholera treatment study (Lindenbaum 1967), 94 untreated control patients 
shed V. cholerae for a mean duration of 5.8 days with a range of 1-13 days, which supports the Applicant’s 
statement that shedding will be unlikely after day 14.  
2.6.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed for the product with other vaccines or other medicinal products. 
However, some data and clinical experience have been generated with other similar vaccines, which can be 
applicable to Vaxchora.  
The vaccine is acid-labile and is administered with a buffer. Eating and drinking should therefore be avoided 
for 60 minutes before and after oral ingestion of Vaxchora, as this may interfere with the protective effect of 
the buffer. 
Vaxchora should not be administered concomitantly with systemic antibiotics active against V. cholerae since 
these agents may prevent to some degree bacteria multiplication, which is necessary in order to induce a 
protective immune response. 
Concomitant use of immunosuppressive drugs is contraindicated as with any live vaccine. 
Concomitant use of chloroquine was shown to decrease the immune response to the earlier vaccine Orochol 
and the Orochol package insert advised to start chloroquine prophylaxis no sooner than 1 week after 
administration of Orochol. Although interaction studies with PXVX0200 have not been conducted, a warning 
has been included in the SmPC of Vaxchora against concomitant administration with chloroquine based on 
the experience with Orochol. 
The Orochol SmPC included a warning that the vaccine should not be administered directly together with 
Vivotif (typhoid vaccine) as the enteric coating of the drug might be damaged by Orochol. For Orochol it was 
suggested that Orochol and Vivotif should be separated by 8 hours. Studies of concomitant vaccination with 
oral polio vaccine and yellow fever vaccine (YF 17D) demonstrated that these vaccines did not suppress the 
immune response to Orochol and that the immune response to YF 17D was also not suppressed by Orochol.  
A formal interaction study between Vaxchora and Vivotif has not been performed. However, the Applicant has 
assessed to what extent a separation of concomitantly administered Vaxchora and Vivotif is necessary based 
on the nature of the buffer used in Vaxchora and on data from published literature. The current marketed 
formulation of Vivotif (typhoid vaccine, live, oral, Ty21a) consists of enteric coated capsules, and it is possible 
that the buffer used with Vaxchora vaccine could adversely affect the protective effect of the enteric coating 
of Vivotif. It is estimated that the buffer of Vaxchora rapidly interacts with the acid in the stomach allowing a 
return to normal pH values within a time frame of two hours. The SmPC is therefore suggesting a separation 
time of two hours between the administration of Vivotif and Vaxchora, which is supported.

2.6.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the adult pooled data, only three individuals discontinued the study due to AEs after having received the 
vaccine. Thus, discontinuation rates in the adult study pool are very low and acceptable. 
Of the 378 children having received the vaccine, at study day 181 ten individuals (8 receiving the vaccine (V) 
and 2 receiving placebo (P)) were lost to follow up, and for 10 additional individuals (8 (V)/2 (P)) parents 
withdrew the allowance to continue study participation.  
Overall discontinuation rates are acceptable. 
2.6.8.  Post marketing experience 
The product was licensed in US in 2016, and a total of 70,041 doses have been distributed until September 
2018. According to the Applicant no new safety issues have been identified so far. However, there are in total 
16 post marketing reported cases, and eight of these consist of various forms of medication errors (drug 
administration errors). These concern instances where the subject has eaten/drunk at inappropriate time 
points, administration of expired product and administration of product without buffer.  
In addition, the product may be stored incorrectly (product should be stored in a refrigerator) and the shelf-
life following reconstitution of the vaccine is short. In the US the vaccine is prepared and administered in a 
healthcare setting. In the EU the vaccine will be prepared and self-administered and preparation of the 
vaccine and self-vaccination increase the risk of medication error, which can lead to vaccine failure. 
The Applicant has submitted a Vaxchora Usability Study Report, rev 1 dated 02 Aug 2019 and a 
Memorandum regarding Vaxchora Risk Benefit Analysis. In the Usability study 21 different user errors have 
been studied in 18 subjects who were responsible for preparing their own medication, of which 13 were 
characterized as “critical use errors”. Only one of these critical user errors was considered having a “high 
risk”: the risk of touching face or eyes during reconstitution, which could potentially lead to infection that 
could require antibiotics. The expert report concludes that there is an inherent tendency of humans to 
subconsciously touch their face and that no further changes to the packaging or labelling could further reduce 
this risk level.  
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 3235 adults and 328 children/adolescents (6 - <18 years) were exposed to the vaccine and 
included in the safety database. No data are currently available for children < 2 years, but a study is ongoing 
in children 2-<6 year. No data are available for subjects > 64 years. The size of the database is considered 
acceptable and in line with available guidance.  
Safety assessment of the vaccine included evaluation of solicited AEs (reactogenicity) as well as unsolicited 
AEs (treatment-emergent AEs). Solicited AEs were assessed Day 1-7 following vaccination. Unsolicited AEs 
were assessed through day 29, but SAEs were assessed through day 181. Solicited AEs were reported by 
about 50% of the vaccine recipients and about 46% of the placebo recipients. Tiredness, headache and 
various gastrointestinal disorders were reported at frequency ≥1/10 (very common) in both the vaccine and 
placebo groups. Of the specified symptoms, only diarrhoea occurred at a significantly increased frequency 
compared to placebo (3.63% in adult vaccine recipients vs. 1.63% in placebo recipients; p=0.0140). Most 
AEs were mild or moderate, occurred within 1-3 days following vaccination and decreased progressively 
thereafter.  
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 97/111 
  
  
Overall in adults, for the one Phase 1 (through Day 181) and three Phase 3 trials (through Day 29), 
unsolicited AEs were reported by 23.7% of vaccine recipients and 27.4% of placebo recipients and were 
mostly mild in severity. In adults, the incidence of subjects with at least one related unsolicited AE was 
similar between the placebo group (8.5%) and the vaccine group (7.9%). The most frequent events by SOC 
were different gastrointestinal disorders, reported in 3.7% of subjects both in the vaccine- and placebo- 
group.  
Serious adverse events through Day 181 were uncommon. The reporting incidence in adults was 0.6% for 
vaccine- and 0.5% for placebo-recipients. None of these events were considered related to vaccine or 
placebo. One death (suicide) occurred on day 85 in a vaccine recipient and was not considered related to 
vaccine.    
Shedding of the vaccine organism into stools of the vaccine recipients reached a peak on day 7 post-
vaccination when it was detected in 7.3% (95% CI 2.0-17.6) of vaccine recipients. No transmission to 
household contacts could be detected. Duration of viral shedding with Vaxchora remains unknown, however 
data from the medical literature support the assumption that shedding will be unlikely after day 14. The low 
frequency of shedding (7.3% of participants) may be related to the development of serum vibriocidal 
antibodies by most individuals, which will control infection by day 10 post vaccination. The SmPC and the PL 
include a warning that there is a potential for transmission of the vaccine strain to non-vaccinated close 
contacts, which is acceptable.  
Concerning use of the product during pregnancy and lactation, data is very limited. Following licensure in US, 
a pregnancy registry was established as a post-marketing commitment to FDA to track women who were 
pregnant at the time of Vaxchora administration. As data during pregnancy is very limited, use during 
pregnancy is categorized as missing information in the RMP. Cases from EU will be included in the US 
pregnancy registry and should be reported in upcoming PSURs. 
No interaction studies have been performed for Vaxchora. The vaccine is acid-labile and is administered with 
a buffer. Eating and drinking should therefore be avoided for 60 minutes before and after oral ingestion of 
Vaxchora, as this may interfere with the protective effect of the buffer. Concomitant administration of 
immunosuppressive drugs is contraindicated. The SmPC also warns against concomitant administration of 
Vaxchora with systemic antibiotics active against V. cholera and chloroquine, since these agents may 
diminish the immune response based on previous data and clinical experience.  
Based on post-marketing data from the US (a total of 70,041 doses have been distributed from launch in 
2016 until September 2018), no new safety issues have been identified so far. However, there are in total 16 
post marketing reported cases, and eight of these concern various forms of medication errors e.g. the subject 
has eaten/drunk at inappropriate time points, administration of expired product and administration of product 
without buffer. Additionally, the vaccine may be stored incorrectly (the vaccine should be stored in a 
refrigerator). Based on the initial data, it was considered that the shelf-life of the reconstituted vaccine was 
too short in the context of a self-administration, which would increase the risk of medication error potentially 
leading to vaccine failure. In addition, considering that even under administration in a healthcare setting as in 
US, medication errors are reported, it was deemed necessary to include medication error in the RMP as an 
important potential risk.   
During the procedure, the Applicant has presented new improved stability data that minimises the risk of 
medication errors to an acceptable level so that self-administration could be considered acceptable. Detailed 
information on how to prepare and administer the vaccine is provided in the SmPC and PL. Additionally, 
educational material for HCPs and vaccine users will be prepared as reflected in Annex II of the Marketing 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 98/111 
  
  
Authorisation. Finally, based on additional data presented by the Applicant during the procedure, the risk of 
serious allergic reactions with the product is anticipated to be very low. Handling possible serious allergic 
reactions outside a healthcare setting is considered adequately described in the SmPC and PL. Allergic 
reactions to vaccine components and to previous use of Vaxchora are listed as contraindications in the SmPC. 
In addition, the PL states that a doctor should be contacted immediately if the following serious side effects 
occur, e.g. serious allergic reactions causing swelling of the face or throat and hives, itchy rash, 
breathlessness and/or a drop in blood pressure and fainting. 
For all these above-mentioned reasons, it is considered that the risks raising from self-administration are 
adequately minimised and self-administration is acceptable and can be advantageous for the traveller. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
A clinical trial was conducted in 374 children age 6 to <18 years (of which 50 received placebo). Solicited AEs 
were reported by about 60% of the subjects both in vaccine as well as placebo recipients. The incidence of 
subjects with at least one related unsolicited AE was higher for the vaccine group (14.6%) than for the 
placebo group (10.0%). In children like in adults, the most frequent events by SOC were gastrointestinal 
disorders. For both solicited and unsolicited AEs, data indicate that frequencies were in general higher for 
children than for adults. AEs such as abdominal pain, pyrexia, fatigue, headache and decreased appetite were 
more commonly observed in children compared to adults [headache (36.0% vs 28.3%), fatigue (37.9% vs 
30.2%), abdominal pain (32.6% vs 18.4%), vomiting (5.3% vs 0.2%), decreased appetite (22.4% vs 
15.7%) and pyrexia (2.5% vs 0.8%). Diarrhoea was more often observed in adults compared to children.   
As in adults, most AEs were mild or moderate, occurred within 1-3 days following vaccination and decreased 
progressively thereafter.  
In the paediatric trial, no serious adverse events considered to be vaccine-related, were reported. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in paediatric clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Safety data from >3000 adults as well as >300 children above 6 years were presented. The most common 
adverse reactions are fatigue, headache and various gastrointestinal disorders which were reported with the 
same incidence among vaccine and placebo recipients (ranging from 15 to 30%). Only diarrhoea occurred at 
a significantly higher incidence with the vaccine compared to placebo. No serious adverse events considered 
to be related to the vaccine have been reported. 
It is proposed that the vaccine can be prepared and administered by the user, which entails a risk of 
medication errors. However, the Applicant has presented new stability data that minimise such risk. It is 
therefore considered that the Applicant has justified how the risks of medication errors of bigger concern 
(vaccine failure) can be taken care of when the vaccine is self-administered. 
In addition, risk minimisation measures are reflected in Annex II of the Product Information, including 
preparing and distributing a HCP guide and a user guide.  
The risk of serious allergic reactions is anticipated to be very low based on the presented data. In case of 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020

such an unexpected event, adequate information regarding handling of the event is given in the PL. 
As data during pregnancy is very limited, use during pregnancy is categorized as missing information in the 
RMP. Cases from the EU will be included in the US pregnancy registry and should be reported in upcoming 
PSURs.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 10 June 2016. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that V. cholerae live, attenuated strain CVD 103-HgR has not been previously 
authorised in a medicinal product in the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers V. cholerae live, attenuated strain CVD 103-HgR to be a 
new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Vaxchora [Cholera vaccine (recombinant, live, 
oral)] is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 
2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cholera is an acute and potentially fatal toxigenic diarrhoeal illness caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. 
Humans are the only host for V. cholerae. The vibrio predominantly associated with epidemic cholera is V. 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 102/111 
  
  
cholerae serogroup O1. O1 vibrios contain an enterotoxin (cholera toxin) which is responsible for causing 
diarrhoea.  
V. cholerae O1 is divided into two biotypes, Classical and El Tor. Both biotypes contain two major serotypes, 
Inaba and Ogawa. Worldwide, V. cholerae O1 El Tor is currently the predominant biotype. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Cholera can be successfully treated with prompt and adequate replacement of lost fluid and electrolytes. 
Antibiotics may shorten the course of the diarrhoea and/or diminish the severity of the illness, to be used in 
addition to rehydration.  
In Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, an inactivated cholera vaccine is available for travellers to 
epidemic and endemic areas from 2 years of age (Dukoral), and therefore fulfils to some extent the medical 
need for travellers in Europe. The development of efficacious cholera vaccines is important also to combat 
drug resistance which for instance is a frequent occurrence in cholera-endemic areas and can complicate the 
treatment of cholera and increase treatment costs.  
Currently, the WHO position paper (2017) regarding cholera vaccination has the following recommendation 
for international workers and travellers: “Vaccination is not generally recommended for long-term or short-
term travellers to cholera-affected countries but should be guided by specific travel risks”. Whilst for 
healthcare workers, the following is recommended: «OCV (oral cholera vaccine) should be considered for 
emergency and relief workers who are likely to be directly exposed to cholera patients or to contaminated 
food or water, particularly those staying in areas with poor access to health-care facilities. Other health-care 
workers are generally not at special risk of cholera. » 
Orochol was another vaccine against cholera available from 1993 until it was withdrawn for commercial 
reasons in 2003. Orochol included the same V. cholerae strain as Vaxchora. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 challenge trial PXVX-VC-200-300 
where safety and efficacy as compared with placebo following challenge at 10 days or at 3 months post-
vaccination in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 45 years. Participants were given a single dose of Vaxchora 
(Classical, Inaba) at a dose of 5 x 108 CFU. The primary efficacy endpoint was the occurrence of moderate or 
severe diarrhoea (≥3.0 L cumulative purge) post-challenge with virulent V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba 10 days 
(Day 11) and 3 months post-vaccination (Day 91) in two separate challenges. The co-primary objectives of 
the study were to demonstrate that the lower 95% confidence bound on the protective efficacy was ≥30% at 
both time points. Meeting the objective at both the 10-Day and 3-Month Challenges was required to achieve 
success for the trial. 
Immunogenicity was based on serum vibriocidal antibody (SVA), and the main parameter was seroconversion 
measured at Day 11 and predefined as a 4-fold increase in SVA titre from baseline. There was a statistically 
significant association between fold-rise in SVA from Day 1 to Day 11 and total post-challenge diarrhoeal 
volume (Spearman’s r=-0.72; p<0.001). Only 2 of 62 (3%) of seroconverting vaccine recipients developed 
moderate/severe cholera after challenge. Based on this near 1:1 relationship between seroconversion and 
protection, along with the fact that approximately 90% of vaccine recipients seroconverted, serum vibriocidal 
seroconversion at Day 11 was used as immunological marker for inferring efficacy in other age groups which 
could not be included in the challenge trial.   
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 103/111 
  
  
Studies PXVX-VC-200-004, PXVX-VC-200-005, PXVX-VC-200-006 were considered pivotal and assessed 
immunogenicity and safety of one single dose of vaccine. All studies were randomized, double-blind and 
placebo controlled. Immunogenicity data from the Lot consistency study PXVX-VC-200-004 in adults 18-45 
years was used to bridge to older adults up to 64 years of age (study PXVX-VC-200-005) as well as to 
children >6 to <18 years of age (study PXVX-VC-200-006). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the main clinical efficacy study (PXVX-VC-200-300), the co-primary objectives and endpoints of the study 
were met in the ITT group with a protective efficacy of 90.3 % at Day 10 post-vaccination (lower 95% CI 
bound 62.7%) and of 79.5% at 3-Month post-vaccination (lower 95% CI bound 49.9%). As a secondary 
endpoint, protective efficacy against diarrhoea of any severity (mild or worse) was 84.5% (95% CI, 67.0%-
100.0%) at day 10 post-vaccination and 50.8% (95% CI, 33.6%-66.8%) at month 3 post-vaccination.  
Overall seroconversion rate for the Challenge study (PXVX-VC-300-200) in participants aged 18-45 was 
90.3% [82.4, 95.5] (n=93). For the Lot consistency study in the same age group, Day 11 seroconversion 
rate was 93.5% [92.5, 94.4] (n=2687). In older adults the Day 11 seroconversion rate was 90.4% [86.4, 
93.5] (n=291). In paediatric patients the seroconversion rate in children aged 6-18 was 97.7% [95.4, 98.9]. 
Although the seroconversion rate and SVA titres were higher in the lot consistency study with younger adults 
(age 18-45) compared to the study with older adults (aged 46-64) and in the challenge study (age 18-45), 
the differences in seroconversion rates satisfied the predefined requirement for non-inferiority.    
The key favourable effects were the robust protective efficacy of 90% against moderate and severe diarrhoea 
at 10 days post-vaccination and the non-inferior seroconversion rates to the Classical Inaba biotype and 
serotype of the vaccine in all other age groups tested (children >6YOA and older adults <64YOA), which 
allowed to infer efficacy in these age groups. The immunobridging strategy was further strengthened by the 
fact that seroconversion correlates with protection. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Vaxchora will not protect against disease caused by the O139 serogroup of V. cholerae, and therefore the 
indication is limited to the O1 serogroup. As with other vaccines, the protective efficacy induced by the 
vaccine is not 100% and thus normal hygiene measures are essential to prevent the disease.  
The main uncertainties lie in the duration of protection because protective efficacy was reduced from 90.3% 
at 10 days post-vaccination to 79.5% at 3-months post-vaccination. Similarly, protective efficacy against 
mild or worse diarrhoea was reduced from 84.5% at 10-days post-vaccination to 50.8% at 3-months post-
vaccination. Duration of protection after 3 months is not known and consequently no recommendation can be 
made at this time on when re-vaccination should be carried out. Furthermore, the potential effects of residual 
immunity from the primary vaccination on the efficacy of booster vaccination is not known. This is particularly 
relevant for health care workers living in cholera affected regions for long periods of time or travelling back 
and forth to cholera affected regions over time.  
Protective effect was determined in participants 18-45 years of age, and this was bridged to individuals aged 
45-64 and >6 – 18 years of age based on seroconversion rates. However, it is not known whether other 
factors may affect the efficacy of Vaxchora in these older and younger populations. 
SVA seroconversion rates at Day 11 have mainly focussed on responses to the vaccine strain, Classical 
biotype, Inaba serotype. Seroconversion rates at Day 11 were similar for the El Tor biotype, Inaba serotype

(Challenge study 91.4% [83.8, 96.2] n=94; Older adults 91% [87.1, 94.1] n=291). However, responses to 
the Ogawa serotypes were lower (Challenge study seroconversion day 11 to Classical Ogawa 87.1% [78.5, 
93.2]; El Tor Ogawa 89.2% [81.1, 94.7]; Older Adults seroconversion day 11 Classical Ogawa 73.2% [67.7, 
78.2], El Tor Ogawa 71.4% [65.8, 76.5]. The lower seroconversion rates to the Ogawa serotype, particularly 
in older adults coupled with the observation that seroconversion rates decline with both time and age, 
remains a concern.  
No data is available in adults >64 years of age. In subjects 46-50 years of age the seroconversion rate was 
92% [86%, 96%], whereas the seroconversion rate in subjects aged 60-64 years was 87% [74%, 95%] 10 
days post-vaccination. However older participants (aged 46-64) showed overall non-inferior seroconversion 
rates at 10-days post-vaccination vs. young adults, for whom efficacy was demonstrated. Since protection 
wanes over time, the protective efficacy will likely be lower vs. young adults at 3 months post-vaccination.    
A limitation of the immune correlate of protection analyses is that SVA titres -and thus seroconversion rates- 
are an immunological marker that is only indirectly coupled to protection because it measures immune 
responses in serum and not at the site of infection, i.e. the intestinal tract.  
As a live attenuated vaccine that needs to infect the digestive tract in order to raise protective immunity, 
concomitant use of Vaxchora with antibacterial agents is not advisable.  
It is uncertain how efficacy may be affected in subjects with gastrointestinal disease, or autoimmune 
conditions affecting the intestinal tract such as coeliac disease. Use of immunosuppressive medication or the 
presence of an immunosuppressive condition could also attenuate the immune response to the vaccine, and 
these risks are reflected in the Product Information.  
The use of Vaxchora was not studied in subjects previously exposed to cholera (e.g. from previous travel or 
consequently to residency in cholera endemic areas). The historical experience with CVD 103-HgR suggests 
that a higher dose may be necessary in this population. However, this gap in knowledge is not immediately 
relevant for a European population since cholera is not endemic in any region within the EU. In lack of such 
data, the vaccine is only recommended in travellers.  
The concomitant use of Vaxchora with other travel vaccines or drugs was not studied. Vaxchora should not be 
administered together with oral typhoid vaccine or anti-malaria chloroquine as their respective efficacy may 
be diminished.    
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety database was based on four studies in adults (one phase 1 and three phase 3 studies) which were 
pooled. In addition, interim data from a phase 4 study in children have been submitted. A total of 3235 
adults and 328 children/adolescents (6 - <18 years) are included in the pooled safety database. Safety data 
are available from 562 adults and 50 children/adolescents who received placebo. Safety assessment of the 
vaccine included evaluation of solicited AEs (reactogenicity) as well as unsolicited AEs (treatment-emergent 
AEs). Solicited AEs were assessed Day 1-7 following vaccination. Unsolicited AEs were assessed through day 
29 and SAEs were assessed through day 181. Solicited AEs were reported by about 50% of the vaccine 
recipients and about 46% of the placebo recipients in adults. In adults, the incidence of subjects with at least 
one related unsolicited AEs was also comparable between the placebo group (8.5%) and the vaccine group 
(7.9%).  
Based on solicited AEs, the most common adverse reactions are fatigue, headache and various 
gastrointestinal disorders (frequency ≥1/10) which were reported with the same incidence among vaccine- 
Assessment report

Page 105/111 
  
  
and placebo-recipients. Only diarrhoea occurred at a significantly higher incidence with the vaccine (3.6%) 
compared to placebo (1.6%). Based on related unsolicited AEs, the most common adverse reactions by SOC 
were different gastrointestinal disorders, reported in 3.7% of subjects both in the vaccine- and placebo 
group. Most adverse reactions are mild, occur within 1-3 days following vaccination and reversible. 
In children, solicited AEs were reported by about 60% of the subjects both in vaccine and placebo recipients. 
This incidence is higher than the corresponding incidence reported in adults (about 50% in vaccine and about 
46% in placebo recipients). Furthermore, in the paediatric population the incidence of subjects with at least 
one related unsolicited AE was higher for the vaccine group (14.6%) than for the placebo group (10.0%). 
Also for children the most frequent events by SOC were gastrointestinal disorders. Comparing children with 
adults, the reported incidence of subjects with at least one vaccine-related unsolicited AE, was higher for 
children (14.6%) than for adults (7.9%). Corresponding incidences for the placebo-group were 10.0 % 
(children) and 8.5% (adults).  
No serious adverse events or deaths considered to be related to the vaccine have been reported.  
Shedding of the vaccine strain was evaluated in the first 7 days post-vaccination in a phase I study of 53 
healthy adult vaccine recipients. Vaxchora was shed in the stools of 11.3% of vaccine recipients cumulatively 
through to Day7 post-vaccination. During daily visits in the 7 days post-vaccination, the proportion of 
subjects with shedding was highest on day 7 (7.3%). No transmission to household contacts could be 
detected. The duration of shedding of the vaccine strain is unknown, but in a study with CVD 103-HgR in Mali 
(Perry 1998), no vaccine shedding was seen at days 12 post-immunisation.   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A major limitation of the safety database is that no data are available for older adults > 64 years of age.  
No interaction studies have been performed with other medications or vaccines.  
There is a risk of medication errors. For instance, the vaccine is acid-labile and should be administered with a 
buffer. Thus, it is important that eating and drinking should be avoided for 60 minutes before and after 
administering the vaccine. Furthermore, the vaccine should be kept refrigerated. It was also considered that 
the sort shelf-life of the reconstituted vaccine could also give rise to medication errors. The product was 
licensed in the US in 2016, and there have been post-marketing reports of medication errors even though the 
vaccine is administered in a health care setting. In EU it is proposed that the vaccine is prepared and 
administered by the user, which can increase the risk of medication error. In the worst case, medication 
errors may lead to vaccine failure.  
However, additional stability data indicate that the shelf-life of the vaccine at room temperature and the 
reconstituted vaccine are longer than previously anticipated. Based upon the data submitted, storage periods 
should be limited to 12 hours at 25°C or less before reconstitution and 15 minutes after reconstitution to 
minimise the risk of medication error. Further, detailed instructions on how to prepare and administer the 
vaccine is given in the SmPC and PL. In addition, a HCP guide and user guide will be provided to ensure 
adequate information on the risks and on related minimisation measures. These measures are reflected in 
Annex II of the Marketing Authorisation.  
The risk of serious allergic reactions is anticipated to be very low based on the data assessed. The PL 
adequately informs on how serious allergic reactions should be handled in case of such an unexpected event, 
including a description of the symptoms of serious allergic reactions and the recommendation to contact a 
physician without delay, should they occur.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The proposed indication is supported by clinical efficacy data generated in a human challenge study in 
healthy individuals aged 18-45 years, which shows a protective efficacy against moderate/severe disease of 
90.3% at 10 days post-vaccination and 79.5% at 3-months post-vaccination. Seroconversion rates based on 
SVA was found to correlate with protection and was used as an immunological marker to infer efficacy in 
older adults (45-64 years) and children (>6-18 years) based on non-inferior immune responses to young 
adults for whom efficacy was demonstrated. However, it is not known whether efficacy will be comparable in 
these different age groups over time.   
SVA seroconversion rates at Day 11 have mainly focussed on responses to the vaccine strain, Classical 
biotype, Inaba serotype. Seroconversion rates at Day 11 were similar for the El Tor Biotype, Inaba serotype 
but lower to the Ogawa serotypes in both the Classical and El Tor biotypes. These observations cast some 
uncertainty as the protective efficacy may be reduced in some endemic regions where the Ogawa serotype 
may predominate. In addition, the protective effect 3-months post-vaccination was lower compared to 10-
days post-vaccination. This is particularly concerning for individuals 60-64 years of age who have been shown 
to have reduced seroconversion rates compared to younger adults (46-50 years). Furthermore, no data was 
generated in individuals above 65 years of age.  
The duration of efficacy is unknown beyond three to six months, and therefore the most appropriate time 
interval for re-vaccination is not known. This is concerning for aid workers who may be residing in cholera 
affected areas for longer periods, or who return to cholera affected areas after an interval of time. No booster 
studies have been carried out so the effect of residual immune responses following primary infection on the 
efficacy of a booster dose is not known. This is particularly important for live vaccines that replicate in vivo.  
In general, the vaccine was safe and well tolerated. No serious adverse events were observed. However, as a 
live attenuated vaccine that infects the digestive tract, it is uncertain how efficacy may be affected in 
participants with gastrointestinal disease, or autoimmune conditions affecting the intestinal tract such as 
ulcerative colitis and coeliac or Crohns disease.    
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Vaxchora is a live attenuated oral vaccine to protect against disease in adults and children over the age of 6 
years. The vaccine was developed as a travel vaccine and was tested in healthy individuals not living in 
endemic areas. Participants with previous cholera episodes, or who travelled to cholera endemic areas within 
the previous 5 years were excluded from clinical studies. Thus, vaccine efficacy cannot be inferred in people 
with natural immunity to V. cholerae. Vaxchora is therefore only indicated for individuals who live in non-
endemic areas who travel to endemic areas. This limitation of the dataset was reflected only in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC instead of as a restriction of indication in section 4.1, since there are no regions in the EU where 
cholera is endemic, so such use of the vaccine is not foreseen within the EU. Official recommendations should 
be followed. 
The vaccine has been tested in a sufficient number of subjects and was well tolerated. The challenge clinical 
study to demonstrate efficacy met its primary endpoints showing robust efficacy in young healthy adults.   
The duration of protection is not known at this stage and therefore the timing for re-vaccination is not known. 
This remains an uncertainty and no recommendation can be made at this stage, impacting especially some 
Assessment report  
EMA/82271/2020 
Page 108/111 
  
  
categories of individuals who may need to travel to and reside in cholera endemic regions for longer periods 
(more than three months). The effect of previous exposure to Vaxchora and the consequently developed 
immunity on vaccine efficacy of a booster dose is not known.  
The vaccine will not be 100% effective against all cholera biotypes and subtypes. Vaccinees should 
nevertheless develop a milder disease course compared to non-vaccinated individuals.  
Based on improved stability data provided by the Applicant, the risk for medication errors associated with 
self-administration is reduced to an acceptable level provided the recommendation to minimise potential 
storage and reconstitution errors are followed. The risk of serious allergic reactions is anticipated to be very 
low, and it is considered that they can be adequately handled when the vaccine is self-administered. 
Overall, the favourable effects are considered to outweigh the unfavourable effects of vaccination with 
Vaxchora. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Vaxchora is positive provided that the conditions identified in the recommendation section 
are complied with. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Vaxchora is favourable in the following indication: 
Vaxchora is indicated for active immunisation against disease caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 in 
adults and children aged 6 years and older.  
This vaccine should be used in accordance with official recommendations. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

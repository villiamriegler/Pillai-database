Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
ISENTRESS 
raltegravir 
On 26 June 2014, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product ISENTRESS. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Merck Sharp & 
Dohme Limited. They may request a re examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify the 
European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a change to an indication as follows: 
"ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment 
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adults, adolescents, children, toddlers and 
infants  from the age of 4 weeks (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2)". 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
For information, the full indication(s) for ISENTRESS will be as follows2: 
"ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment 
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adults, adolescents, children, toddlers and 
infants  from the age of 4 weeks (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2)".

within 44 days (Type II variations) and 67 days (Annex II applications) from adoption of the opinion.

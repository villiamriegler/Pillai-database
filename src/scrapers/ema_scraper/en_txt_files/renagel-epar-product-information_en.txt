1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Renagel 400 mg film-coated tablets 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each tablet contains 400 mg sevelamer hydrochloride. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Film-coated tablet (tablet) 
The off-white, oval tablets are imprinted with “Renagel 400” on one side. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Renagel is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis 
or peritoneal dialysis. Renagel should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, 
which  could  include  calcium  supplements,  1,25-dihydroxy  Vitamin  D3  or  one  of  its  analogues  to 
control the development of renal bone disease. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Starting dose 
The recommended starting dose of sevelamer hydrochloride is 2.4 g, 3.6 g or 4.8 g per day based on 
clinical needs and serum phosphorus level.  Renagel must be taken three times per day with meals. 
Serum phosphate level in patients not on 
phosphate binders 
1.76 – 2.42 mmol/L (5.5-7.5 mg/dl) 
2.42- 2.91 mmol/L (7.5-9 mg/dl) 
> 2.91 mmol/L 
Starting dose of Renagel 400 mg 
tablets 
2 tablets, 3 times per day 
3 tablets, 3 times per day 
4 tablets, 3 times per day 
For patients previously on phosphate binders, Renagel should be given on a gram for gram basis with 
monitoring of serum phosphorus levels to ensure optimal daily doses. 
Titration and maintenance 
Serum phosphate levels should be closely monitored and the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride titrated 
by 0.4 g or 0.8 g three times per day (1.2 g/day or 2.4 g/day) increments with the goal of lowering 
serum phosphate to 1.76 mmol/L (5.5mg/dl) or less. Serum phosphate should be tested every two to 
three weeks until a stable serum phosphate level is reached and on a regular basis thereafter. 
The dose range may vary between 1 and 10 tablets per meal.  The average actual daily dose used in the 
chronic phase of a one year clinical study was 7 grams of sevelamer. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of this product have not been established in patients below the age of 18 years.

Renal impairment 
The safety and efficacy of this product have not been established in predialysis patients.  
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Patients should take Renagel with meals and adhere to their prescribed diets. The tablets must be 
swallowed whole. Do not crush, chew or break into pieces prior to administration. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to sevelamer or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypophosphataemia 
Bowel obstruction. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Efficacy and safety of Renagel has not been studied in patients with: 
swallowing disorders 
active inflammatory bowel disease 
• 
• 
•  gastrointestinal motility disorders including untreated or severe gastroparesis, diverticulosis 
retention of gastric contents and abnormal or irregular bowel motion 
•  patients with a history of major gastrointestinal surgery  
Therefore caution should be exercised when Renagel is used in patients with these disorders. 
Intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus 
In  very  rare  cases,  intestinal  obstruction  and  ileus/subileus  have  been  observed  in  patients  during 
treatment with sevelamer hydrochloride. Constipation may be a preceding symptom. Patients who are 
constipated should be monitored carefully while being treated with sevelamer hydrochloride. Renagel 
treatment  should  be  re-evaluated  in  patients  who  develop  severe  constipation  or  other  severe 
gastrointestinal symptoms. 
Fat-soluble vitamins 
Depending on diet intake and the nature of end stage renal failure, dialysis patients may develop low 
vitamin A, D, E and K levels. It cannot be excluded that Renagel can bind fat-soluble vitamins 
contained in ingested food. Therefore, in patients not taking these vitamins, monitoring vitamin A, D 
and E levels and assessing vitamin K status through the measurement of thromboplastin time should 
be considered and the vitamins should be supplemented if necessary. Additional monitoring of 
vitamins and folic acid is recommended in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis, since in the clinical 
study, vitamin A, D, E and K levels were not measured in these patients. 
Folate deficiency 
There is at present insufficient data to exclude the possibility of folate deficiency during long term 
Renagel treatment. 
Hypocalcaemia/hypercalcaemia 
Patients with renal insufficiency may develop hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia. Renagel does not 
contain calcium. Serum calcium levels should be monitored as is done in normal follow-up of a 
dialysis patient. Elemental calcium should be given as a supplement in case of hypocalcaemia.  
Metabolic acidosis 
Patients with chronic renal failure are predisposed to developing metabolic acidosis. Worsening of 
acidosis has been reported upon switching from other phosphate binders to sevelamer in a number of 
studies where lower bicarbonate levels in the sevelamer-treated patients compared to patients treated 
with calcium-based binders were observed. Closer monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels is therefore 
recommended. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Peritonitis 
Patients receiving dialysis are subject to certain risks for infection specific to the dialysis modality. 
Peritonitis is a known complication in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) and in a clinical 
study with Renagel, a number of peritonitis cases were reported. Therefore, patients on PD should be 
closely monitored to ensure the reliable use of appropriate aseptic technique with the prompt 
recognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with peritonitis. 
Swallowing and choking difficulties 
Uncommon reports of difficulty swallowing the Renagel tablet have been reported. Many of these 
cases involved patients with co-morbid conditions including swallowing disorders or oesophageal 
abnormalities. Caution should be exercised when Renagel is used in patients with difficulty 
swallowing. 
Hypothyroidism 
Closer monitoring of patients with hypothyroidism co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride and 
levothyroxine is recommended (see section 4.5). 
Long term chronic treatment 
As data on the chronic use of sevelamer for over one year are not yet available, potential absorption 
and accumulation of sevelamer during long-term chronic treatment cannot be totally excluded (see 
section 5.2). 
Hyperparathyroidism 
Renagel alone is not indicated for the control of hyperparathyroidism. In patients with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism Renagel should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, 
which could include calcium supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to lower 
the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. 
Serum chloride 
Serum chloride may increase during Renagel treatment as chloride may be exchanged for phosphorus 
in the intestinal lumen. Although no clinically significant serum chloride increase has been observed in 
the clinical studies, serum chloride should be monitored as is done in the routine follow-up of a 
dialysis patient. One gram of Renagel contains approximately 180 mg (5.1 mEq) chloride. 
Inflammatory Gastrointestinal Disorders  
Cases of serious inflammatory disorders of different parts of the gastrointestinal tract (including 
serious complications such as haemorrhage, perforation, ulceration, necrosis, colitis and colonic/caecal 
mass) associated with the presence of sevelamer crystals have been reported (see section 4.8).  
Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer discontinuation. Sevelamer hydrochloride 
treatment should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Dialysis 
Interaction studies have not been conducted in patients on dialysis. 
Ciprofloxacin 
In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride decreased the bioavailability of 
ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% when co-administered with Renagel in a single dose study. 
Consequently, Renagel should not be taken simultaneously with ciprofloxacin. 
Anti-arrhythmics and anti-seizure medicinal products 
Patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure 
medicinal products for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials.  Caution 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should be exercised when prescribing sevelamer hydrochloride to patients also taking these medicinal 
products. 
Levothyroxine 
During post marketing experience, very rare cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. 
Closer monitoring of TSH levels is therefore recommended in patients receiving both medicinal 
products. 
Ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus in transplant patients 
Reduced levels of ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have been reported in transplant 
patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (i.e 
graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded and a close monitoring of blood 
concentrations of mycophenolate mofetil,  ciclosporin and tacrolimus should be considered during the 
use of combination and after its withdrawal.  
Digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol  
In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, Renagel had no effect on the bioavailability of digoxin, 
warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol. 
Proton pump inhibitors 
During post-marketing experience, very rare cases of increased phosphate levels have been reported in 
patients taking proton pump inhibitors co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride.  
Bioavailability 
Renagel is not absorbed and may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. When 
administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically 
significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour 
before or three hours after Renagel, or the physician should consider monitoring blood levels. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
The safety of sevelamer hydrochloride has not been established in pregnant women. In animal studies 
there was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryo-foetal toxicity. Renagel should only be given to 
pregnant women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis has been conducted for both 
the mother and the foetus (see section 5.3). 
Breast-feeding 
The safety of sevelamer hydrochloride has not been established in breast-feeding women. Renagel 
should only be given to breast-feeding women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis 
has been conducted for both the mother and the infant (see section 5.3). 
Fertility 
There are no data from the effect of sevelamer on fertility in humans.  Studies in animals have shown 
that sevelamer did not impair fertility in male or female rats at exposures at a human equivalent dose 2 
times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative body surface 
area. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Sevelamer has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Treatment of hyperphosphatemia. ATC code: V03AE02. 
Renagel contains sevelamer, a non-absorbed phosphate binding poly (allylamine hydrochloride) 
polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the 
polymer backbone. These amines become partially protonated in the intestine and interact with 
phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the 
gastrointestinal tract, sevelamer lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum. 
In clinical trials, sevelamer has been shown to be effective in reducing serum phosphorus in patients 
receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 
Sevelamer decreases the incidence of hypercalcaemic episodes as compared to patients using calcium 
based phosphate binders alone, probably because the product itself does not contain calcium. The 
effects on phosphate and calcium were proven to be maintained throughout a study with one year 
follow-up. 
Sevelamer has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Bile 
acid binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol. In 
clinical trials mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%. This effect is observed after 2 
weeks is maintained with long-term treatment. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not 
change.  
In the clinical studies in haemodialysis patients, sevelamer alone did not have a consistent and 
clinically significant effect on serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). In the 12 week study 
involving peritoneal dialysis patients however, similar iPTH reductions were seen compared with 
patients receiving calcium acetate. In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism Renagel should be 
used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 
1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to lower the iPTH levels. 
In a clinical trial of one-year duration, Renagel had no adverse effect on bone turnover or 
mineralisation compared to calcium carbonate.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Renagel is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract according to a single dose pharmacokinetic 
study in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been carried out in renal failure patients 
(see section 4.4).  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, Renagel at a dose of 10 times the maximum human doses 
reduced absorption of fat soluble vitamins D, E and K, and folic acid. 
In a study in rats, administering sevelamer in 15-30 x the human dose, an increase in serum copper 
was detected. This was not confirmed in a dog study or in clinical trials. 
Currently,  no  formal  carcinogenicity  data  are  available.  However,  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  have 
indicated that Renagel does not have genotoxic potential. Also the medicinal product is not absorbed 
in the gastrointestinal tract. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In reproduction studies there was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryolethality, foetotoxicity or 
teratogenicity at the doses tested (up to 1 g/kg/day in rabbits and up to 4.5 g/kg/day in rats). Deficits in 
skeletal ossification were observed in several locations in fetuses of female rats dosed with sevelamer 
at 8-20 times the maximum human dose of 200 mg/kg. The effects may be secondary to vitamin D 
and/or vitamin K depletion at these high doses.

Bowel obstruction. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Efficacy and safety of Renagel has not been studied in patients with: 
•  swallowing disorders 
•  active inflammatory bowel disease 
•  gastrointestinal motility disorders including untreated or severe gastroparesis, diverticulosis 
retention of gastric contents and abnormal or irregular bowel motion 
•  patients with a history of major gastrointestinal surgery 
Therefore caution should be exercised when Renagel is used in patients with these disorders.

Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Dialysis 
Interaction studies have not been conducted in patients on dialysis. 
Ciprofloxacin 
In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride decreased the bioavailability of 
ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% when co-administered with Renagel in a single dose study. 
Consequently, Renagel should not be taken simultaneously with ciprofloxacin. 
Anti-arrhythmics and anti-seizure medicinal products 
Patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure 
medicinal products for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials.  Caution 
should be exercised when prescribing sevelamer hydrochloride to patients also taking these medicinal 
products.

Levothyroxine 
During post marketing experience, very rare cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. 
Closer monitoring of TSH levels is therefore recommended in patients receiving both medicinal 
products. 
Ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus in transplant patients 
Reduced levels of ciclosporin,  mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have been reported in transplant 
patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (i.e 
graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded and a close monitoring of blood 
concentrations of mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin and tacrolimus should be considered during the 
use of combination and after its withdrawal.  
Digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol  
In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, Renagel had no effect on the bioavailability of digoxin, 
warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol. 
Proton pump inhibitors 
During post-marketing experience, very rare cases of increased phosphate levels have been reported in 
patients taking proton pump inhibitors co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride.  
Bioavailability 
Renagel is not absorbed and may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. When 
administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically 
significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour 
before or three hours after Renagel, or the physician should consider monitoring blood levels. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
The safety of sevelamer hydrochloride has not been established in pregnant women. In animal studies 
there was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryo-foetal toxicity. Renagel should only be given to 
pregnant women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis has been conducted for both 
the mother and the foetus (see section 5.3). 
Breast-feeding 
The safety of sevelamer hydrochloride has not been established in breast-feeding women. Renagel 
should only be given to breast-feeding women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis 
has been conducted for both the mother and the infant (see section 5.3). 
Fertility 
There are no data from the effect of sevelamer on fertility in humans.  Studies in animals have shown 
that sevelamer did not impair fertility in male or female rats at exposures at a human equivalent dose 2 
times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative body surface 
area. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Sevelamer has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently occurring (≥5% of patients) adverse reactions were all in the gastrointestinal 
disorders system organ class.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In parallel design studies involving 244 haemodialysis patients with treatment duration of up to 54 
weeks and 97 peritoneal dialysis patients with treatment duration of 12 weeks were conducted. 
Adverse reactions from these studies (299 patients),  from uncontrolled clinical trials (384 patients), 
and that were spontaneously reported from post-marketing experience are listed by frequency in the 
table below. The reporting rate is classified as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known 
(cannot be estimated form the available data).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Renagel has been given to normal healthy volunteers in doses up to 14 grams, the equivalent of 
seventeen 800 mg tablets per day for eight days with no undesirable effects.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Treatment of hyperphosphatemia. ATC code: V03AE02. 
Renagel contains sevelamer, a non-absorbed phosphate binding poly (allylamine hydrochloride) 
polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the 
polymer backbone. These amines become partially protonated in the intestine and interact with 
phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the 
gastrointestinal tract, sevelamer lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum. 
In clinical trials, sevelamer has been shown to be effective in reducing serum phosphorus in patients 
receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 
Sevelamer decreases the incidence of hypercalcaemic episodes as compared to patients using calcium 
based phosphate binders alone, probably because the product itself does not contain calcium. The 
effects on phosphate and calcium were proven to be maintained throughout a study with one year 
follow-up. 
Sevelamer has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Bile 
acid binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol. In 
clinical trials mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%. This effect is observed after 2 
weeks is maintained with long-term treatment. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not 
change.  
In the clinical studies in haemodialysis patients, sevelamer alone did not have a consistent and 
clinically significant effect on serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). In the 12 week study 
involving peritoneal dialysis patients however, similar iPTH reductions were seen compared with 
patients receiving calcium acetate. In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism Renagel should be 
used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 
1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to lower the iPTH levels. 
In a clinical trial of one-year duration, Renagel had no adverse effect on bone turnover or 
mineralisation compared to calcium carbonate.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Renagel is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract according to a single dose pharmacokinetic 
study in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been carried out in renal failure patients 
(see section 4.4).  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, Renagel at a dose of 10 times the maximum human doses 
reduced absorption of fat soluble vitamins D, E and K, and folic acid. 
In a study in rats, administering sevelamer in 15-30 x the human dose, an increase in serum copper 
was detected. This was not confirmed in a dog study or in clinical trials. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Currently,  no  formal  carcinogenicity  data  are  available.  However,  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  have 
indicated that Renagel does not have genotoxic potential. Also the medicinal product is not absorbed 
in the gastrointestinal tract. 
In reproduction studies there was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryolethality, foetotoxicity or 
teratogenicity at the doses tested (up to 1 g/kg/day in rabbits and up to 4.5 g/kg/day in rats). Deficits in 
skeletal ossification were observed in several locations in fetuses of female rats dosed with sevelamer 
at  8-20 times the  maximum  human  dose  of  200 mg/kg.  The  effects  may  be  secondary to  vitamin D 
and/or vitamin K depletion at these high doses.

Renagel 400 mg film-coated tablets 
sevelamer hydrochloride 
Read  all  of  this  leaflet  carefully  before  you  start  taking  this  medicine  because  it  contains 
important information for you. 
-  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
- 
-  This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, 
If you have further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
- 
even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. 
If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. 
What is in this leaflet 
1. What Renagel is and what it is used for 
2. What you need to know before you take Renagel 
3. How to take Renagel 
4. Possible side effects 
5. How to store Renagel 
6. Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Renagel is and what it is used for 
Renagel contains sevelamer as the active ingredient. It binds phosphate from food in the digestive tract 
and so reduces serum phosphate levels in the blood. 
Renagel is used to control the levels of phosphate in the blood of adult kidney failure patients on 
haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis treatment.  
Adult patients whose kidneys have failed and who are undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis 
are not able to control the level of serum phosphate in their blood. The amount of phosphate then rises 
(your doctor will call this hyperphosphataemia). Increased levels of serum phosphorus can lead to hard 
deposits in your body called calcification. These deposits can stiffen your blood vessels and make it 
harder for blood to be pumped around the body. Increased serum phosphorus can also lead to itchy 
skin, red eyes, bone pain and fractures. 
Renagel may be used with other medicines which include calcium or vitamin D supplements to control 
the development of renal bone disease. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Renagel  
Do not take Renagel: 
• 
• 
• 
if you have low levels of phosphate in your blood (your doctor will check this for you). 
if you have bowel obstruction.  
if  you  are  allergic  to  sevelamer  or  to  any  of  the  other  ingredients  of  this  medicine  (listed  in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Renagel if any of the following applies to you: 
•  if you are not on dialysis 
•  if you have swallowing problems 
•  if you have problems with motility (movement) in your stomach and bowel 
•  if you have symptoms of delayed emptying of stomach contents such as feeling of fullness, 
nausea and/or vomiting  
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• if you have prolonged diarrhoea or pain in the abdomen (symptoms of active inflammatory 
bowel disease) 
•  if you have undergone major surgery on your stomach or bowel 
Talk to your doctor while taking Renagel: 
•  if you experience severe abdominal pain, stomach or intestine disorders, or blood in the stool 
(gastrointestinal bleeding). These symptoms can be due to serious inflammatory bowel disease 
caused by sevelamer crystals deposit in your bowel. Contact your doctor who will decide on 
continuing the treatment or not. 
Additional treatments: 
Due to either your kidney condition or your dialysis treatment you may: 
•  develop a low or high level of calcium in your blood. Since Renagel does not contain calcium 
your doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. 
•  have a low amount of vitamin D in your blood. Therefore, your doctor may monitor the levels 
of vitamin D in your blood and prescribe additional vitamin D as necessary. If you do not take 
multivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid in 
your blood and therefore your doctor may monitor these levels and prescribe supplemental 
vitamins as necessary. 
Changing treatment: 
When you switch from another phosphate binder to Renagel, your doctor might consider monitoring 
the levels of bicarbonate in your blood more closely because Renagel may decrease the levels of 
bicarbonate. 
Special note for patients on peritoneal dialysis 
You may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal 
dialysis. This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes. You 
should tell your doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal 
distress, abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, 
constipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting. 
You should expect to be monitored more carefully for problems with low levels of vitamins A, D, E, 
K and folic acid. 
Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy in children (below the age of 18 years) has not been studied. Therefore 
Renagel is not recommended for use in this population. 
Other medicines and Renagel 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
•  Renagel should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). 
•  If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult your 
doctor when taking Renagel. 
•  The effects of medicines such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus 
(medicines used in transplant patients) may be reduced by Renagel. Your doctor will advise 
you if you are taking these medicines. 
•  In certain people taking levothyroxine (a thyroid hormone) and Renagel, increased levels of 
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, a substance in your blood which helps control your body’s 
chemical functions) may very rarely be observed. Therefore your doctor may monitor the 
levels of TSH in your blood more closely. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
If you are taking medicine such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, or lansoprazole to treat heartburn, 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or gastric ulcers, you should consult your doctor when 
taking Renagel. 
Your doctor will check for interactions between Renagel and other medicines on a regular basis. 
In some cases where Renagel should be taken at the same time as another medicine, your doctor may 
advise you to take this medicine 1 hour before or 3 hours after Renagel intake, or he/she may consider 
monitoring the blood levels of that medicine. 
Pregnancy and  breast-feeding 
The safety of Renagel has not been established in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Renagel should 
only be given to pregnant or breast-feeding women if clearly needed. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  
Driving and using machines 
Renagel is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines. 
3. 
How to take Renagel  
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. He will base the dose on your serum phosphate level. The recommended starting dose of Renagel 
for adults and the elderly (>65 years) is two to four tablets with each meal 3 times a day. 
Initially your doctor will check the levels of phosphate in your blood every 2-3 weeks and  may adjust 
the dose of Renagel when necessary (between 1 and 10 tablets of 400 mg per meal) to reach an 
adequate phosphate level. 
The tablets must be swallowed whole. Do not crush, chew or break into pieces prior to swallowing. 
Patients taking Renagel should adhere to their prescribed diet and liquid intake.  
If you take more Renagel than you should 
In the event of a possible overdose you should contact your doctor immediately. 
If you forget to take Renagel 
If you have missed one dose, this dose should be omitted and the next dose should be taken at the 
usual time with a meal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
4. 
Possible side effects   
Like all medicines, this medicine  can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Since constipation may be a preceding symptom in very rare cases of blockages in your intestine, it is 
important to inform your doctor or pharmacist of this symptom before or during the use of Renagel.

Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10000 people): 
hypersensitivity. 
Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): 
cases of itching, rash, abdominal pain, slow intestine motility (movement), inflammation of abnormal 
small pouches (called diverticula) in the large intestine, blockages in the intestine (signs include: 
severe bloating; abdominal pain, swelling or cramps; severe constipation),  rupture in the intestine wall 
(signs include: severe stomach pain, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, or a tender abdomen), serious 
inflammation of the large bowel (symptoms include: severe abdominal pain, stomach or intestine 
disorders, or blood in the stool [gastrointestinal bleeding]) and crystal deposit in the intestine have 
been reported.

•  develop a low or high level of calcium in your blood. Since Renagel does not contain calcium 
your doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. 
•  have a low amount of vitamin D in your blood. Therefore, your doctor may monitor the levels 
of vitamin D in your blood and prescribe additional vitamin D as necessary. If you do not take 
multivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid in 
your blood and therefore your doctor may monitor these levels and prescribe supplemental 
vitamins as necessary. 
Changing treatment: 
When you switch from another phosphate binder to Renagel, your doctor might consider monitoring 
the levels of bicarbonate in your blood more closely because Renagel may decrease the levels of 
bicarbonate. 
Special note for patients on peritoneal dialysis: 
You may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal 
dialysis. This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes. You 
should tell your doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal 
distress, abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, 
constipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting.  
You should expect to be monitored more carefully for problems with low levels of vitamins A, D, E, 
K and folic acid. 
Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy in children (below the age of 18 years) has not been studied. Therefore 
Renagel is not recommended for use in this population. 
Other medicines and Renagel 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
•  Renagel should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). 
• 
If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult your 
doctor when taking Renagel. 
•  The effects of medicines such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus 
(medicines used in transplant patients) may be reduced by Renagel. Your doctor will advise 
you if you are taking these medicines. 
• 
In certain people taking levothyroxine (a thyroid hormone) and Renagel, increased levels of 
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, a substance in your blood which helps control your body’s 
chemical functions) may very rarely be observed. Therefore your doctor may monitor the 
levels of TSH in your blood more closely. 
•  If you are taking medicine such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, or lansoprazole to treat heartburn, 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or gastric ulcers, you should consult your doctor  
when taking Renagel. 
Your doctor will check for interactions between Renagel and other medicines on a regular basis. 
In some cases where Renagel should be taken at the same time as another medicine, your doctor may 
advise you to take this medicine 1 hour before or 3 hours after Renagel intake, or he/she may consider 
monitoring the blood levels of that medicine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
The safety of Renagel has not been established in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Renagel should 
only be given to pregnant or breast-feeding women if clearly needed. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Renagel is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines. 
3. 
How to take Renagel 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. He will base the dose on your serum phosphate level. The recommended starting dose of Renagel 
for adults and the elderly (>65 years) is one or two tablets with each meal 3 times a day.  
Initially your doctor will check the levels of phosphate in your blood every 2-3 weeks and may adjust 
the dose of Renagel when necessary (between 1 and 5 tablets of 800 mg per meal) to reach an 
adequate phosphate level. 
The tablets must be swallowed whole. Do not crush, chew or break into pieces prior to swallowing. 
Patients taking Renagel should adhere to their prescribed diet and liquid intake.  
If you take more Renagel than you should 
In the event of a possible overdose you should contact your doctor immediately. 
If you forget to take Renagel 
If you have missed one dose, this dose should be omitted and the next dose should be taken at the 
usual time with a meal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Ibandronic acid is a 3rd generation bisphosphonate which inhibits bone resorption. It is an analogue of 
pyrophosphate, the naturally occurring inhibitor of mineralization in bone. It is taken up by osteoclasts 
and inhibits their bone resorbing activity in a dose-dependent manner. It is given orally or 
intravenously, and is used in the prevention of skeletal events in breast cancer patients with bone 
metastases, in the treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, and in the treatment of post-
menopausal osteoporosis. 
The safety and efficacy profile of ibandronic acid has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, 
details of which can be found in the EPAR for Bondronat. In addition, there is a long-term post-
marketing experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this 
application is a generic application referring to the reference medicinal product Bondronat, summary of 
the clinical data of Ibandronic acid is available and no new clinical studies, except a bioequivalence 
study, have been conducted with Ibandronic acid Sandoz. 
The indication and posology proposed for Ibandronic acid Sandoz  50 mg (film coated tablets) is the 
same as the indication and posology authorised for the reference medicinal product Bondronat 50 mg 
(film coated tablets): 
Tablets:  
Prevention of skeletal events (pathological fractures, bone complications requiring radiotherapy or 
surgery) in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. 
The recommended dose is one 50 mg film-coated tablet daily.

For patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr ≥50 and <80 mL/min) no dosage adjustment is 
necessary. For patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr ≥30 and <50 mL/min) or severe renal 
impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) being treated for the prevention of skeletal events in patients with 
breast cancer and metastatic bone disease the dosing recommendations as provided in the SmPC 
should be followed. 
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment, nor the elderly. 
Ibandronic acid Sandoz is not recommended for patients below age 18 years due to insufficient data on 
safety and efficacy. 
Complete information on posology and administration times can be found in the SmPC. 
The applicant did not apply for the other pharmaceutical form of the reference product (Bondronat 
concentrate for solution for infusion), which is indicated for the prevention of skeletal events 
(pathological fractures, bone complications requiring radiotherapy or surgery) in patients with breast 
cancer and bone metastases and for the treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia with or without 
metastases.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Ibandronic acid Sandoz presented as film-coated tablets contain 50 mg of ibandronic acid as active 
substance (corresponding to 56.26 mg of ibandronic sodium monohydrate). The other ingredients are 
povidone K30, cellulose microcrystalline, starch pregelatinised, crospovidone, purified water, silica 
colloidal anhydrous and glycerol dibehenate. The film coating consists of titanium dioxide, lactose 
monohydrate, hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 400, ethanol and purified water. The film-coated 
tablets are marketed in Polyamide/Al/PVC - Aluminum (PA/ALL/PVC/alu) blisters packed in cartons. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The active substance in this product is ibandronate sodium monohydrate or 3-(N-methyl-N-pentyl) 
amino-l-hydropropane-l, 1- di phosphonic acid, monosodium salt, monohydrate, and has the following 
structure: 
Figure 1: Chemical structure of Ibandronate sodium monohydrate 
Ibandronate sodium monohydrate is an off white to white coloured powder. It is sparingly soluble in 
water. This active substance is also slightly hydroscopic.  
Ibandronate sodium monohydrate has no chiral centres and is therefore not optically active.

2.2.2.1.  Manufacture 
Information about manufacturing process has been provided using Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure. A 2 step synthesis has been well described.  Controls of critical steps and 
intermediates are sufficient to ensure quality of the active substance. Specifications for starting 
materials, reagents, and solvents have been provided. Adequate control of critical steps and 
intermediates has been presented. The purified active substance is packed in clear white polyethylene 
bag that is filled with nitrogen and tied. This bag is then put in a triple laminated black bag with a silica 
gel bag and is sealed before being put in a HDPE container with a HDPE lid. 
The chemical structure of ibandronate sodium monohydrate has been confirmed by appropriate testing 
at release and during stability spectroscopy (IR, 1H-NMR, UV, MS, and 13C-NMR). In addition the 
molecular weight was determined by elemental analysis. The X-ray diffraction studies demonstrated 
that polymorphic form B is indeed manufactured routinely by the defined synthetic route. For 
confirmation, an XRD polymophic form test is included in the drug substance specification and is also 
monitored during stability. 
2.2.2.2.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for physical appearance, solubility, identification (IR 
and HPLC), solubility, loss on drying, heavy metals, impurities (HPLC), phosphate and phosphate 
content, assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), sodium content and physical form by XRD. It was noted 
that all specifications reflect the relevant quality attributes of the active substance. 
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was 
provided for the in-house analytical methods and are in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines.  
In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance  
Impurities have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety.  
Data on three production scale batches of ibandronate sodium monohydrate have been provided and 
the requirements in the drug substance specification were met. 
2.2.2.3.  Stability 
The stability results from long-term (25°C/60%RH) and accelerated studies (40°C/75%RH) were 
completed according to ICH guidelines demonstrated adequate stability of the active substance. The 
following parameters were monitored during the stability studies: description, identification, loss on 
drying, related substances, phosphate & phosphate content, XRD and assay. It was noticed that the 
test methods applied are those used for release of the active substance.  
In can be concluded that the proposed re-test is justified based on the stability results when the active 
substance is stored in the original packing material. 
2.2.3.  Medicinal Product 
2.2.3.1.  Pharmaceutical Development 
All information regarding the choice of the active substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/94879/2011 
Page 6/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The main aim of the applicant was to develop a medicinal product essentially similar to the reference 
product and demonstrating acceptable stability in the proposed container closure systems. In this 
context, the characteristics of the reference product have been studied in terms of its qualitative 
composition along with its physico-chemical properties. The excipients for this particular formulation 
were selected carefully and are commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations. The comparative 
dissolution profiles were provided. The results demonstrated that the generic batches used for the 
bioequivalence studies and the EU brand leader batches are similar with respect to dissolution rate.  
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product 
The proposed commercial manufacturing process involves standard technology and it is divided into 
nine main steps: weighing of the raw materials, first mixing, wet granulation, drying, dry granulation, 
second mixing, compression, coating and packaging. 
Furthermore, the equipment used is commonly available in the pharmaceutical industry. The critical 
steps in the manufacturing process have been identified and controlled. 
It was noticed that the manufacturing process has been adequately validated for one pilot and two 
scale batches the results of the manufacturing validation reports were considered satisfactory. 
2.2.3.3.  Product specification 
The product specification is standard for tablets and contains tests with suitable limits for appearance, 
average mass (Ph.Eur), loss on drying (Ph.Eur), disintegration (Ph.Eur), hardness (Ph.Eur), 
identification (HPLC and FTIR), assay (HPLC) impurities (HPLC), dissolution, residual solvents (GC), 
microbial contamination (Ph.Eur), identification of titanium dioxide, tightness of blister (Ph.Eur) and 
packaging.  
Impurities and degradation products have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of 
view of safety. Their limits are justified by reference to stability studies. 
All analytical procedures that were used for testing the finished product were properly described. 
Moreover, all relevant methods were satisfactorily validated in accordance with the relevant ICH 
guidelines.  
The batch analysis data for three scale batches confirm that the tablets can be manufactured 
reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specifications. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Three batches of each of the film-coated tablets packed in intended market containers were placed on 
stability under ICH conditions 25º C/60% RH, 30º C/65% RH and 40º C/75% RH. The following 
parameters were controlled: appearance, identification, average mass, loss on drying, assay, 
degradation products, dissolution, hardness, disintegration, tightness of blisters and microbial 
contamination.  
It was noted that a forced degradation study has also been conducted on a single batch of the drug 
product (heat, water hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis, base hydrolysis, photo degradation and hydrogen 
peroxide). No significant changes were observed in the finished product. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/94879/2011

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC 
are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture, control of the active substance and the finished product 
have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant CHMP and ICH 
guidelines. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of the 
finished product. Therefore, this medicinal product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance 
in the clinic. Dissolution results (film coated tablets) indicate comparability with the reference product 
(Bondronat) and this is confirmed by in-vivo bioequivalence results (see the clinical part of the report).  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, all quality issues have been resolved quality. In this context, it can be 
concluded that the quality characteristics of the finished product are adequate and should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.3.  Non-Clinical aspects   
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Ibandronic Acid Sandoz manufactured by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals GmbH is considered 
unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all ibandronic acid 
containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is 
expected to be similar and not increased.

2.4.  Clinical Aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an abridged application for film-coated tablets containing ibandronic acid. 
To support the marketing authorisation application the applicant has submitted a single bioequivalence 
study, IAT-P9-457. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of ibandronic acid based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with 
the SmPC of the reference product for the pharmaceutical form applied for. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical 
assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its 
current version is of particular relevance. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Bioanalytical and PK inspections have been performed in October 2007 and July 2008. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Methods 
Study design  
Single dose, replicate, crossover, laboratory blinded, 4-period, 2 sequence, comparative bioavailability 
study of Ibandronate 50 mg film-coated tablets in healthy male and female volunteers under fasting 
conditions and a wash-out period of 21 days between each of the 4 administrations. 1x 50 mg was 
administered in each period. 
Dosing period 1: 16/4-2009 
Dosing period 2: 7/5-2009 
Dosing period 3: 28/5-2009 
Dosing period 4: 18/6-2009 
Test and reference products  
The test formulation of Ibandronic acid 50mg tablets manufactured by Pharmathen S.A. (batch No. 
0900628, batch size 100.000 tablets, exp. date 08/2009) has been compared to Bondronat 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/94879/2011 
Page 9/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
manufactured by Roche Pharma AG (Batch No: B1014B71, from the UK=EU market, exp. date 
07/2011). 
Population(s) studied   
40  healthy  (black  (33)/white  (4)/other  (3))  male/female  subjects  (19-51  years)  participated  in  the 
study. 
Analytical methods   
The blood samples were analysed by HPLC MS/MS method for detection of ibandronate. The linear 
concentration range for the analysis of plasma samples is between 0.250 ng/ml (=LOQ) to 250.000 
ng/ml. 
Date of start and finish of the bio-analytical phase: 30/6-2009 to 22/7-2009.  
Time from first blood sample collection to last sample analysis was 97 days (16/4-2009 to 22/7-2009). 
The long-term stability of Ibandronate in human plasma covers 158 days at a temperature of -20°C. 
Reanalysis of samples:  There were no samples retested for pharmacokinetic reasons in this study. The 
criteria for determining which sample values were to be re-assayed for pharmacokinetic reasons are 
described in SOP of the study sponsor. 
Drop-out subjects were not analysed.  
A validated HPLC method using MS/MS detection was employed in determining the concentrations of 
ibandronate in human plasma. Of 2352 analysable subject samples received, 2349 samples were 
successfully assayed at the CRO’s Lab. The method has met acceptance criteria with respect to 
specificity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, linearity and dilution integrity. Stability 
evaluations in matrix and solutions have also met acceptance criteria, demonstrating insignificant 
degradation of ibandronate and ibandronate-d3 (IS) over the specified storage durations and 
conditions. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Bioequivalence was determined based on AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax as primary variables with 90% 
confidence intervals of 0.80 to 1.25 for each parameter.  
The parameters calculated were AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, tmax, Kel and t½ el. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters assessed are considered adequate.  
Statistical methods   
ANOVA was performed on the ln-transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞. The ANOVA model included 
sequence, subject nested within sequence, period and treatment. Nonparametric test was carried out 
on tmax. Statistical and pharmacokinetic analysis were generated using Kinetic, version 9.00, an 
application developed at the CRO and SAS® version 9.1 (Mixed procedure). 
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence: 
Statistical Analysis based on a parametric ANOVA model was performed on two sided 90% confidence 
interval of the ratio of geometric means for the Cmax, AUCt , AUC∞, based on ln-tranformed data, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/94879/2011 
Page 10/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rank transformed test for Tmax. Level of significance was assessed at the two-sided 5% level. For the 
Cmax, the observed intra-subject variation for the reference product (Bondronat 50 mg film-coated 
tablets) was greater than 30%. As per protocol, a widened acceptance range of 75 to 133% was 
therefore considered in the assessment of bioequivalence for the Cmax parameter. The Test to 
Reference ratio of geometric LSmeans and corresponding 90% confidence interval for the Cmax were 
within the acceptance range of 75 to 133%. In fact, they were also within the conventional 
bioequivalence range of 80-125%.  
For the AUCt and AUC∞, the Test to Reference ratio of geometric LSmeans and corresponding 90% 
confidence interval were all within the acceptance range of 80 to 125%. 
Ibandronate exhibits a high intra-individual variability with a CV greater than 30%. Furthermore, 
pharmacokinetic parameters do not significantly affect the clinical response. In fact, ibandronate bone 
concentration has more influence on the efficacy parameters than the plasma concentration. In 
addition, ibandronate is well tolerated in humans without any adverse effects on hepatic and renal 
function and has a wide therapeutic index. No relation between adverse events frequency and oral 
dose has been observed. Thus, according to this justification, the bioequivalence range for Cmax 
criterion may be widened to 75-133%. 
Results 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for the 35 subjects who completed the study are presented in table 1.  
The terminal phases of ibandronate could not be adequately estimated for one subject. Therefore the 
parameters AUC, T1/2  and Kel were not calculated for this subject.

No statistically significant between-treatment differences were observed for any of the pharmacokinetic 
parameters under study. The 90% confidence intervals for each primary parameter were within the 
predefined limits and therefore bioequivalence with the reference product is established. 
Safety data 
The bioequivalence study showed no difference in safety profile between the test and the innovator 
product. 
Twenty (20) of the forty (40) subjects experienced a total of forty-three (43) adverse events during 
the study. Eighteen (18) adverse events (11 different types) were reported after the single dose 
administration of the test product and twenty-seven (27) adverse events (18 different types) were 
reported after the single dose administration of the reference product. Two (2) adverse events (blood 
potassium increased and platelet count increased) associated with the post-study laboratory test 
results were imputed to both formulations. Fifteen (15) adverse events judged to be possibly related to 
the investigational products (ear pain, fatigue, oedema peripheral, platelet count increased, dizziness, 
headache (4 episodes) and somnolence (6 episodes) were unexpected. No serious adverse events 
(SAEs) were recorded in this study. 
All reported adverse events, for subjects that were included in the statistical analysis, were considered 
to have negligible impact or no impact on the pharmacokinetic profiles of the drugs and the 
assessment of bioequivalence. 
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study, Ibandronic acid Sandoz (as the duplicate of Iasibon) is 
considered bioequivalent with Bondronat. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No  new  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  presented  and  no  such  studies  are  required  for  this 
application.  
2.4.4.  Additional data 
Not applicable. 
2.4.5.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available for this generic medicinal product; it has not been marketed in 
any country.

2.4.6.  Discussion on Clinical aspects 
The CHMP assessment addressed pharmacokinetic data in respect of a single bioequivalence study 
(IAT-P9-457). The study design is considered adequate with regard to wash-out period, sampling 
period and sampling scheme according to expected Tmax and T½.The study was conducted in line with 
GCP.  
The CHMP had requested justification of the chosen population as the majority of study subjects in 
study IAT-P9-457 are black, while the SmPC of the reference product states that there are only very 
few data available on patients with African origin. Clarification and justification had also been 
requested for exclusion from the statistical analyses of plasma concentrations for a number of samples.  
Additional analyses had been provided and based on the justifications and clarifications provided, the 
CHMP considered that these aspects did not impact on the validity of the study results. 
The results of the bio-equivalence study show that the 90% confidence intervals for each primary 
parameter fall within the normal acceptance limits of 80-125% and therefore bioequivalence with the 
reference product is established. 
2.4.7.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study the test formulation of ibandronic acid 50mg film-coated 
tablets is considered bioequivalent with Bondronat 50mg film-coated tablets.  
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
PSUR 
The next data lock point for the reference medicinal product is 24 June 2011. 
The PSUR of the reference medicinal product is on a 1-yearly cycle. The PSUR submission schedule 
should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference product. 
The  PSUR  submission  schedule  for  Ibandronic  acid  Sandoz  film-coated  tablets  should  follow  PSURs 
submission schedule for the reference medicinal product. 
Description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1. of the 
Marketing Authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market. 
Risk Management Plan 
The applicant has submitted a justification for the absence of a risk management plan, on the basis 
that the active ingredient has been in use for many years and has a well established safety profile.  
Routine pharmacovigilance activities according to volume 9A/ICH will be undertaken whilst the product 
is in the market, including careful review of individual case safety reports, literature review, signal 
detection procedures and generation of the required safety reports.  
The risk minimisation measures agreed for the reference product should be followed.

2.6.  User consultation 
The results of user consultation provided indicate that the Package leaflet is well structured and 
organised, easy to understand and written in a comprehensible manner. The test shows that the leaflet 
is readable and users are able to act upon the information that it contains. 
2.7.  Benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment 
This application for Ibandronic acid Sandoz concerns a generic version of ibandronic acid 50 mg 
tablets. The reference product Bondronat 50mg tablets is indicated for prevention of skeletal events 
(pathological fractures, bone complications requiring radiotherapy or surgery) in patients with breast 
cancer and bone metastases. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this generic application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
The pivotal basis forms a bioequivalence study with a single dose, replicate, crossover, laboratory 
blinded, 4-period, 2 sequence design under fasting conditions. The study design was considered 
adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective 
European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points and overall sampling time as well as wash-out 
period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods 
applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of ibandronic acid 50mg film-coated tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for 
bioequivalence when compared with the reference product Bondronat 50 mg film-coated tablets. The 
point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-, and Cmax 
were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. 
Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk 
ratio of Ibandronic acid Sandoz in prevention of skeletal events (pathological fractures, bone 
complications requiring radiotherapy or surgery) in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases, 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

FAST study was a prospective, randomised, open-label, 
SmPC based on the final results from study FAST 
(Febuxostat versus Allopurinol Streamlined Trial) 
listed as a category 3 study in the RMP; this is an 
interventional study investigating the cardiovascular 
safety of febuxostat in comparison with allopurinol in 
patients with chronic symptomatic hyperuricaemia. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP 
version 8.0 has also been submitted. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet and to update 
the warning relevant to the content of sodium 
according to the Annex to the European Commission 
guideline on `Excipients in the labelling and package 
leaflet of medicinal products for human use'.

blinded-endpoint study comparing the cardiovascular (CV) 
safety profile of febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients 
with chronic hyperuricaemia (in conditions where urate 
deposition had already occurred) and CV risk factors (i.e. 
patients 60 years or older and with at least one other CV 
risk factor). In this study, treatment with febuxostat was 
not associated with an increase in CV death or all-cause 
death, overall or in the subgroup of patients with a baseline 
history of myocardial infarction, stroke or unstable angina. 
Nevertheless, considering that a higher number of fatal 
cardiovascular events were observed with febuxostat when 
compared to allopurinol in patients with pre-existing major 
cardiovascular diseases during the development of the 
product and in one post registrational study (CARES), 
treatment of this patient group should be exercised 
cautiously and they should be monitored regularly. For 
more information, please refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics.

CARES Study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
order to include the results of the post authorisation 
safety study CARES (TMX-67_301) to compare the 
cardiovascular outcomes of febuxostat and 
allopurinol in subjects with gout and cardiovascular 
comorbidities. This was a Multicenter, Randomized, 
Active-Control, Phase IIIB Study conducted at the 
non inferiority trial comparing CV outcomes with febuxostat 
versus allopurinol in patients with gout and a history of 
major CV disease including MI, hospitalization for unstable 
angina, coronary or cerebral revascularization procedure, 
stroke, hospitalized transient ischemic attack, peripheral 
vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus with evidence of

request of the FDA. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list 
of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. At the 
CHMP request, the RMP has been updated (version 
7.0) and a DHPC was agreed to inform prescribers of 
the findings of the CARES study.

microvascular or macrovascular disease. To achieve sUA 
less than 6 mg/dL, the dose of febuxostat was titrated from 
40 mg up to 80 mg (regardless of renal function) and the 
dose of allopurinol was titrated in 100 mg increments from 
300 to 600 mg in patients with normal renal function and 
mild renal impairment and from 200 to 400 mg in patients 
with moderate renal impairment. 
The primary endpoint in CARES was the time to first 
occurrence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events 
(MACE), a composite of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, CV 
death and unstable angina with urgent coronary 
revascularization. 
The endpoints (primary and secondary) were analysed 
according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis including 
all subjects who were randomized and received at least one 
dose of double-blind study medication. 
Overall 56.6% of patients discontinued trial treatment 
prematurely and 45% of patients did not complete all trial 
visits. 
In total, 6,190 patients were followed for a median of 32 
months and the median duration of exposure was 728 days 
for patients in febuxostat group (n 3098) and 719 days in 
allopurinol group (n 3092). 
The primary MACE endpoint occurred at similar rates in the 
febuxostat and allopurinol treatment groups (10.8% vs. 
10.4% of patients, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 1.03; 
two-sided repeated 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-
1.23). 
In the analysis of the individual components of MACE, the 
rate of CV deaths was higher with febuxostat than 
allopurinol (4.3% vs. 3.2% of patients; HR 1.34; 95% CI 
1.03-1.73). The rates of the other MACE events were 
Page 7/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar in the febuxostat and allopurinol groups, i.e. non-
fatal MI (3.6% vs. 3.8% of patients; HR 0.93; 95% CI 
0.72-1.21), non-fatal stroke (2.3% vs. 2.3% of patients; 
HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.73-1.41) and urgent revascularization 
due to unstable angina (1.6% vs. 1.8% of patients; HR 
0.86; 95% CI 0.59-1.26).  The rate of all-cause mortality 
was also higher with febuxostat than allopurinol (7.8% vs. 
6.4% of patients; HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.47), which was 
mainly driven by the higher rate of CV deaths in that 
group. 
Rates of adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure, 
hospital admissions for arrhythmias not associated with 
ischemia, venous thromboembolic events and 
hospitalization for transient ischemic attacks were 
comparable for febuxostat and allopurinol.” 
Based on these results sudden cardiac death was added as 
a rare adverse reactions and the following recommendation 
was made: Treatment with febuxostat in patients with pre-
existing major cardiovascular diseases (e.g. myocardial 
infarction, stroke or unstable angina) should be avoided, 
unless no other therapy options are appropriate. In the 
post registrational CARES trial  the rate of MACE events 
was similar in febuxostat versus allopurinol treated patients 
(HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.87-1.23), but a higher rate of 
cardiovascular deaths was observed (4.3% vs. 3.2% of 
patients; HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.03-1.73). The PL has been 
updated accordingly.

inhibition of xanthine oxidase by febuxostat may cause 
increased plasma concentrations of 
mercaptopurine/azathioprine that could result in severe 
toxicity. No interaction studies have been performed in 
humans. Where the combination cannot be avoided, a 
reduction of the dose of mercaptopurine/azathioprine is 
recommended. Based on modelling and simulation analysis 
of data from a pre-clinical study in rats, when 
coadministered with febuxostat, the dose of 
mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be reduced to the 20% 
or less of the previously prescribed dose in order to avoid 
possible haematological effects. The patients should be 
closely monitored and the dose of 
mercaptopurine/azathioprine should be subsequently 
adjusted based on the evaluation of the therapeutic 
response and the onset of eventual toxic effects.

SmPC 
Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 in 
with the results of the in vivo drug-drug interaction 
study with rosiglitazone regarding the effect of 
multiple oral doses of febuxostat 120 mg on the 
pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 
rosiglitazone and its metabolite N-
desmethylrosiglitazone in healthy subjects.

new additional data submitted by the MAH 
vitro. In a study in healthy subjects, coadministration of 
120 mg febuxostat QD with a single 4 mg oral dose of 
rosiglitazone had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
rosiglitazone and its metabolite N-desmethylrosiglitazone, 
indicating that febuxostat is not a CYP2C8 enzyme inhibitor 
in vivo. Thus, co administration of febuxostat with 
rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to 
require any dose adjustment for those compounds.

febuxostat on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 
theophylline. The results showed that the co-administration 
of febuxostat 80 mg QD with theophylline 400 mg single 
dose has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or safety of 
theophylline. Neither the mean clearance nor the mean 
half-life values of theophylline were affected by co-
administration of febuxostat. Therefore no special caution is 
advised when febuxostat 80 mg and theophylline are given 
concomitantly.

Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of Adenuric continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considers that the 
benefit risk profile of Adenuric continues to be favourable in 
the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in conditions 
where urate deposition has already occurred (including a 
history, or presence of, tophus and/or gouty arthritis). The 
CHMP is also of the opinion that the renewal can be granted 
with unlimited validity.

Additionally, although interaction studies of febuxostat with 
drugs that are metabolised by xanthine oxidase (XO) have 
not been performed, inhibition of XO is known to result in 
an increase in mercaptopurine or azathioprine levels. On 
the basis of the mechanism of action of febuxostat on XO

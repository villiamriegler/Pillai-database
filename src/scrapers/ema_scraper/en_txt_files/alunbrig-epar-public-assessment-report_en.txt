2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.   Problem statement 
Despite other therapies being available or investigated for NSCLC more generally (e.g., chemotherapy, 
immunotherapy,  and  anti-angiogenesis  therapy),  ESMO  treatment  guidelines1  recommend  that  first-
line treatment with crizotinib is preferred for patients with ALK+ NSCLC. In patients who progress after 
crizotinib,  further  treatment  with  second  generation  ALK-inhibitor  therapy  (such  as  ceritinib,  which  is 
currently approved in the EU) is recommended. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Alunbrig is intended as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with crizotinib. 
2.1.2.   Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world (1.8 million new cases in 2012), 12.9% 
of all new cancers worldwide2. 
Estimates of the frequency of ALK rearrangement in the overall population of NSCLC patients range 
from 2% to 7%34), which represent approximately 7,000-25,000 ALK+ NSCLC patient in the US and 
5,800-20,000 patients in the EU in 2016. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features/Aetiology and pathogenesis 
ALK  is  a  tyrosine  kinase  encoded  on  chromosome  2  and  is  primarily  involved  in  developmental 
processes  and  expressed  at  low  levels  in  adults5.  The  first  genetic  rearrangement  of  ALK  seen  in 
NSCLC  involved  a  fusion  between  the  echinoderm  microtubule-associated  protein-like  4  (EML4)  gene 
and  the  ALK  tyrosine  kinase  domain.  EML4-ALK  has  the  capacity  to  transform  fibroblasts  grown  in 
culture  and  as  subcutaneous  xenografts  to  induce  tumor  formation6.  Since  then,  a  number  of 
additional  ALK  fusion  partners  have  been  described  in  NSCLC  that  are  believed  to  result  in  aberrant 
signaling  and  oncogenic  transformation7  8.  ALK  rearrangements  are  more  common  among  patients

with  adenocarcinoma  histology,  patients  who  have  never  smoked,  and  patients  who  have  wild-type 
EGFR and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS)9. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Approximately,  one-third  of  the  patients  with  Stage IIIA  disease  are  considered  operable.    However, 
the  majority  of  patients  with  Stage IIIA/B  have  inoperable  (unresectable)  disease,  and  are  amenable 
to  receiving  curative  intention  chemoradiation  treatment.    The  biological  characteristics  of  locally 
advanced,  Stage III  disease  are  poorly  defined;  the  clinical  characteristics  associated  with  prognosis 
are  nodal  station  involvement,  size  of  primary  tumor,  baseline  pulmonary  function,  gender,  presence 
or absence of significant weight loss, and performance status (PS). 
Pathological diagnosis based on tumour samples includes immunohistochemistry (IHC) to identify 
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Molecular testing should be carried out to determine 
genetic alterations such as EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements which determine choice of 
targeted treatment. The break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) test remains a core 
approach to detect ALK rearrangements 
2.1.5.  Management 
While the standard treatment algorithm for unselected NSCLC patients has historically involved front-
line  treatment  with  chemotherapy,  recent  clinical  studies  have  demonstrated that  patients  with  ALK+ 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC respond well to treatment with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib10.  
Approval of crizotinib was based on results from two single-arm studies11.  
In one study (N = 136) with a median duration of treatment of 22 weeks, the objective response rate 
(ORR)  was  50%  (95%  CI:  42,  59%)  and  the  median  duration  of  response  was  41.9  weeks.  In  the 
other study (N = 119) with a median duration of treatment of 32 weeks, the ORR was 61% (95% CI: 
52,  70%)  and  the  median  duration  of  response  was  48.1  weeks.  In  a  randomized  study  of  crizotinib 
versus  chemotherapy  (pemetrexed  or  docetaxel)  in  ALK+  NSCLC  patients,  a  statistically  significant 
improvement  in  progression–free  survival  (PFS)  was  observed  in  patients  treated  with  crizotinib 
(hazard ratio [HR] 0.49 [95% CI: 0.37 0.64], p<0.001). In patients treated with crizotinib, median PFS 
and overall survival (OS) were 7.7 months and 20.3 months, respectively12. In a separate randomized 
study  of  crizotinib  against  pemetrexed-platinum  doublet  chemotherapy  in  patients  with  advanced, 
previously untreated non-squamous ALK+ NSCLC,  median PFS was 10.9 months in the crizotinib arm 
and 7.0 months in the chemotherapy arm (HR 0.45 [95% CI: 0.35–0.60], p<0.001)13.   
Therefore, Crizotinib is currently recommended as first-line therapy for ALK positive NSCLC. Although 
crizotinib  is  an  effective  treatment  for  ALK+  NSCLC,  26 to 35% of  patients  fail  to  respond14,  and  the 
majority  of  patients  progress  within  1  year,  with  multiple  mechanisms  of  resistance  having  been 
identified.  ALK-dependent  mechanisms  of  resistance,  observed  in  approximately  30%  of  patients15, 
include  the  acquisition  of  secondary  mutations  in  ALK  that  interfere  with  crizotinib  binding,  and/or 
amplification of the ALK fusion gene. More than 10 secondary mutations in ALK have been associated

with  crizotinib  resistance  in  patients,  with  the  most  common  being  L1196M  and  G1269A 16  17.  The 
central  nervous  system  (CNS)  is  the  first  site  of  progression  in  approximately  50%  of  patients18  19, 
suggesting  inadequate  penetration  of  crizotinib  into  the  brain  (i.e.,  pharmacologic  failure)  as  the 
primary cause of resistance in these patients. Therefore, an ALK inhibitor that can overcome secondary 
resistance  mutations  in  ALK  and  is  less  susceptible  to  pharmacologic  failure  may  be  required  to 
overcome resistance. 
Recently, two other ALK inhibitors, ceritinib and alectinib, have become available for NSCLC patients 
with  ALK  rearrangements  who  have  disease  progression  or  are  intolerant  to  crizotinib.  Also,  ceritibib 
and  alectinib  are  authorized  as  monotherapy  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
anaplastic  lymphoma  kinase  (ALK)-positive  advanced  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC).  Also, 
ceritibib and alectinib are authorized as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
anaplastic  lymphoma  kinase  (ALK)-positive  advanced  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC).ALK 
secondary  mutations  associated  with  clinical  resistance  to  ceritinib  and  alectinib  have  also  been 
identified, including L1152R and F1174C/V for ceritinib, I1171N/T/S for alectinib, and G1202R for both 
agents20 21 22 23 24 25. A highly potent ALK inhibitor that is both CNS-penetrant and well tolerated is still 
needed  to  better  treat  patients  with  oncogenic  ALK-activating  mutations  and  rearrangements.  Up  to 
50% of patients with NSCLC will have brain metastases during the course of the disease, resulting in 
reduced  quality  of  life  and  limited  survival26  27.  Survival  of  patients  with  brain  metastases  has  been 
considered  very  poor  28,29,  with  risk  of  death  and  significant  impairments  in  quality  of  life  being 
increased  by  a  factor  of  4  30,  31.  The  median  survival  of  patients  with  untreated  brain  metastases  is 
reported to be 1 to 3 months 32, 33, 34.

About the product 
Brigatinib  is  a  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  that  targets  ALK,  c-ros  oncogene  1  (ROS1),  and  insulin  like 
growth  factor  1  receptor  (IGF  1R).Brigatinib  inhibited  autophosphorylation  of  ALK  and  ALK  mediated 
phosphorylation  of  the  downstream  signalling  protein  STAT3  in  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  assays  (SmPC, 
section 5.1)..  
Brigatinib  inhibited  the  in  vitro  proliferation  of  cell  lines  expressing  EML4  ALK  and  NPM  ALK  fusion 
proteins and demonstrated dose dependent inhibition of EML4 ALK positive NSCLC xenograft growth in 
mice. Brigatinib inhibited the in vitro and in vivo viability of cells expressing mutant forms of EML4-ALK 
associated with resistance to ALK inhibitors, including G1202R and L1196M (SmPC, section 5.1). 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
Alunbrig  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult 
patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
previously treated with crizotinib. 
The recommended indication for approval is:   Alunbrig is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment 
of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) previously treated with crizotinib. 
Brigatinib  is  available  as  30  mg,  90  mg  and  180  mg  film-coated  tablets.  The  recommended  starting 
dose is 90 mg orally once daily for the first 7 days, then 180 mg orally once daily (SmPC, section 4.2).  
If  Alunbrig  is  interrupted  for  14  days  or  longer  for  reasons  other  than  adverse  reactions,  treatment 
should be resumed at 90 mg once daily for 7 days before increasing to the previously tolerated dose. 
If  a  dose  is  missed  or  vomiting  occurs  after  taking  a  dose,  an  additional  dose  should  not  be 
administered and the next dose should be taken at the scheduled time. 
Treatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed. 
Dose adjustments 
Dosing interruption and/or dose reduction may be required based on individual safety and tolerability.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
In  2013,  ARIAD  engaged in  scientific  advice  meetings  with  Medicines  and  Health  Products  Regulatory 
Agency (MHRA), Medical Products Agency (MPA), Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des 
Produits  de  Santé  (ANSM),  EMA  Scientific  Advice  Working  Party  (SAWP)/CHMP.  European  agencies 
provided  similar  feedback  to  obtain  preliminary  data  on  an  effect  of  food  on  the  PK,  and  safety  of 
brigatinib  prior  to  Study  AP26113  13-201.  Results  from  all  completed  clinical  pharmacology  studies 
requested by regulatory agencies are included in the present MAA.

Regulatory Advice on the Phase 2 Trial (AP26113-13-201, ALTA) 
The  study  design  aspects  of  the  phase  2  Study  AP26113-13-201  were  discussed  with  regulatory 
agencies,  including  the  patient  eligibility  criteria,  primary  endpoint,  sample  size  calculation,  and 
secondary  endpoints.  Initially,  the  study  design  of  Study  AP26113-13-201  only  included  a  single 
brigatinib 180 mg QD treatment arm with a sample size of approximately 150 patients. The study was 
subsequently amended to a randomized study that includes two arms: (1) 90 mg QD continuously and 
(2) 180 mg QD after a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg QD, with an increased total sample size of 218 patients 
(actual enrollment was 222 patients).  
Regulatory Advice on the Phase 3 Study, AP26113-13-301 (ALTA 1L) 
In  November  2013,  according  to  the  feedback  received  from  EMA/CHMP/SAWP,  the  proposed 
randomized  phase  3  study  (Study  AP26113-13-301)  comparing  brigatinib  to  crizotinib  with  PFS  as 
primary  endpoint  could  potentially  serve  to  support  the  transformation  of  the  conditional  MA  into  a 
regular  approval  in  ALK+  NSCLC  patients  previously  treated  with  crizotinib.  However,  the  Agencies 
commented  on  the  proposed  planned  interim  analyses  and  the  overall  size  of  the  study  (i.e.,  1050 
patients)  as  being  challenging  to  complete  given  the  size  of  the  patient  population.  ARIAD  has  taken 
this  feedback  into  consideration,  and  in  light  of  the  emerging  data  from  Study  AP26113-13-201, 
adjusted  the  study  sample  size  to  enroll  approximately  270  patients,  and  two  interim  analyses  are 
planned  after  approximately  50%  and  75%  of  the  total  expected  events  (progression  or  death)  have 
been observed in Study AP26113-13-301.  
General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP  
GMP: 
Active substance:  
The  EU  batch  releaser  Penn  Pharmaceutical  Services  Ltd  (United  Kingdom)  has  provided  a  QP 
declaration  confirming  that  manufacture  of  the  drug  substance  is  performed  in  accordance  with  the 
detailed  guidelines  on  good  manufacturing  practices  for  starting  materials,  as  defined  in  “Volume  4-
Medicinal  Products  for  Human  and  Veterinary  Use:  Good  Manufacturing  Practice/Part  II  –  Basic 
Requirements for Active Substances used as the Starting Materials”.  
The QP declaration is dated 23 January, 2017 and signed by an EU Qualified Person. The presented QP 
declaration is considered acceptable.  
Final product: 
GMP  certificates  have  been  included  in  the  file.  The  European  Medicines  Agency  Compliance  and 
Inspection  Sector  has  reviewed  the  manufacturer  information  contained  in  the  application  form 
(Module 1) and available from the EEA National Competent Authorities and determined that all relevant 
sites  have  valid  manufacturing  authorizations  or  valid  GMP  certificates  as  appropriate,  with  the 
exception of 3 sites for which an inspection has been agreed by the CHMP.  
A GMP inspection at three sites, responsible for manufacture, packaging and quality control testing of 
the  finished  product  conducted  between  10-14  July  2017.  The  outcome  of  the  inspection  carried  out 
was issued on 18 and 31 October 2017. 
GCP: 
GCP inspections at a CRO facility in USA and two investigator sites, located in Germany and Denmark 
were  conducted  between  June-July  2017  in  connection  with  the  conduct  of  pivotal  trial  with  protocol 
number  AP26113-13-201.  The  outcome  of  the  inspection  carried  out  was  issued  on  28  September 
2017.

All  the  studies  included  in  this  submission  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  Good  Clinical  Practice 
(GCP)  guidelines.  The  appropriate  Ethics  Committees  and  Institutional  Review  Boards  reviewed  and 
approved all the studies. 
GLP 
All  safety  pharmacology  in  vivo  studies  as  well  as  the  pivotal  toxicology  studies  were  conducted  in 
compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Regulations.  
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that treatments are 
already authorised in the applied indication for brigatinib, furthermore, brigatinib does not offer a novel 
mechanism of action and there is no indication that the safety profile will be improved compared to 
authorised treatments.

6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of brigatinib is 5-chloro-2-N-{4-[4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl]-2-
methoxyphenyl}-4-N-[2-(dimethylphosphoryl)phenyl]pyrimidine-2,4-diamine corresponding to the 
molecular formula C 29H39ClN7O2P. It has a relative molecular mass of 584.9 and the following 
structure:

Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of brigatinib was elucidated by a combination of 1H, 13C and 31P nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), single crystal X-ray 
crystallography, elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and ultraviolet 
(UV) spectroscopy. 
The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (DVS) and x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). 
The active substance is an off-white to beige, non-hygroscopic solid. Brigatinib is considered a 
Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class 1 substance based on relevant solubility and 
permeability studies. However, the finished product is not considered to be rapidly dissolving as 
defined by the Biopharmaceutics Classification System Guidance, which is discussed in the 
pharmaceutical development section of this report. 
Brigatinib is achiral. 
Polymorphism has been observed for brigatinib. Multiple solid forms and pseudo solid forms of 
brigatinib have been observed during solid state characterization studies. Solid Form A is the preferred 
form as it has shown to be anhydrous, non-hygroscopic, and physically and chemically stable under 
normal handling and storage conditions. Solid Form A is consistently produced utilizing the intended 
commercial manufacturing process. Once the most thermodynamically stable solid Form A is obtained, 
no conventional method has been found to convert it to another form via solvent mediated or solid-
solid transition, exposure to elevated temperature or humidity, mechanical pressure or grinding. 
Moreover, development stability studies of the finished product demonstrate that no form change 
occurs following storage at 25 °C / 60% RH and 40 °C / 75% RH minimally through 6 months. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Brigatinib is synthesized in numerous steps with multiple manufacturers. 
The process involves synthesis between starting materials, intermediates to generate brigatinib 
(AP26113) crude, which is generated and isolated as a free base producing the active substance. 
Following a thorough process risk-assessment of potential genotoxic impurities, focused control 
strategies have been identified in order to limit potential mutagenic impurities. These strategies include 
controls implicit in the design of the manufacturing process, in-process tests and parameters, and 
appropriate specifications for starting materials and intermediates.  
Assessment Report - Alunbrig 
EMA/696925/2018  
Page 18/132 
 
 
 
 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Critical process 
parameters (CPPs), which impact the active substance critical quality attributes (CQAs) have been 
defined, and the overall control strategy is considered suitable. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. The modifications made to the manufacturing process throughout 
development are the basis for the proposed commercial process (Process B2) and include optimizations 
derived through a quality risk-based approach to bring more robust control of the CQAs of the active 
substance across a broader range of manufacturing scales i.e. lab, clinical, and the intended 
commercial scale. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and elements of QbD such as risk assessment and design of experiment (DOE) studies, which were 
conducted in order to enhance the process knowledge. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  a  polyethylene  continuous  liner  and  an  outer  polyethylene  bag 
which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), identity (FT-IR, HPLC), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (HS-GC), solid form confirmation (XRPD), heavy metals 
(colorimetric), particle size distribution (laser diffraction), residual metal catalysts (ICP-OES, ICP-MS, 
residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) and water content (KF). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set.  
The absence of controls on microbiological enumeration for the active substance is acceptable based on 
water activity testing of registration batches. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 27 pilot to production scale batches of the active substance were provided. 
The results were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
The  active  substance  specifications  are  based  on  the  active  substance  CQAs  which  are  appearance, 
identity,  assay,  impurities,  residue  on  ignition,  residual  solvents,  heavy  metals,  solid  form  and  batch 
homogeneity.  
Stability 
Stability data from 7 batches manufactured at approximately a third of the commercial scale of the 
active substance from proposed manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Assessment Report - Alunbrig 
EMA/696925/2018  
Page 19/132 
 
 
 
Subsequent to the production of the above mentioned registration batches, the active substance 
manufacturing process was scaled up to the intended commercial scale. The increase in batch size 
from registration to commercial scale was performed using essentially the same equipment and 
processes with only minor changes relating to the increase in scale. All registration batches are 
considered representative of the commercial manufacturing process and of both manufacturers. 
Supportive data from 5 commercial scale batches of the active substance from proposed 
manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
No significant changes or trends were identified with the exception of specified impurity. Although 
reportable levels of the impurity show a slight increase during storage, all impurity results for all 
registration batches at all conditions are well within the qualified specification limit throughout the 
duration of testing. Linear regression analyses of the available stability data demonstrate that specified 
impurity will remain well within the specified limit with 95% confidence limit, minimally through 36 
months of storage at the 25 °C / 60% RH condition. All tested parameters were within the 
specifications. The parameters tested are the same as for release.  The analytical methods used were 
the same as for release and are stability indicating. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The photostability 
study performed on the active substance manufactured at the manufacturer is considered 
representative of the active substance at other manufacturers. All specifications were met for all tests 
and conditions. 
Analytical data on one batch exposed as a solution or suspension to heat, acid, base, and hydrogen 
peroxide, were also provided. Brigatinib prepared in 2% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution and 
stored at ambient conditions showed only minimal degradation after two hours. A solution in 1N HCl 
stored for 120 hours (5 days) at 80 °C exhibited moderate degradation. A suspension in 1N NaOH 
stored for 48 hours (2 days) at 80 °C exhibited significant degradation. The active substance prepared 
as an aqueous solution and stored for 120 hours (5 days) at 105 °C exhibited significant degradation. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months with no special 
storage conditions in the proposed container, a polyethylene continuous liner and an outer 
polyethylene bag. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as white to off-white film-coated tablets in 30 mg, 90 mg and 180 
mg dose strengths. Alunbrig 30 mg film-coated tablets are round, approximately 7 mm in diameter 
debossed with “U3” on one side and plain on the other. Alunbrig 90 mg film-coated tablets are oval, 
approximately 15 mm in length debossed with “U7” on one side and plain on the other side. Alunbrig 
180 mg film-coated tablets are oval, approximately 19 mm in length debossed with “U13” on one side 
and plain on the other side. Strengths can be distinguished by their shape, size and debossing. The 
core tablets of the three dosage strengths are proportional in composition. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The quality target product 
profile (QTPP) is presented in Table 3. 
Assessment Report - Alunbrig 
EMA/696925/2018  
Page 20/132 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 3: Alunbrig Quality Target Product Profile 
The critical quality attributes (CQAs) are identified, along with the rationale for defining as CQAs. 
The formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of risk 
assessment and design of experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical 
process parameters (CPPs). A risk analysis was performed in order to define critical process steps and 
process parameters that may have an influence on the finished product quality attributes. 
As discussed earlier in this report, brigatinib is a BCS class I substance exhibiting high solubility and 
permeability. However, the finished product does not meet the criteria for rapidly dissolving as defined 
by the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Guidance. Therefore, no biowaiver claims are 
made. 
Particle size distribution of the active substance was determined during development using dry 
dispersion laser diffraction. The available data demonstrate the capacity of the intended commercial 
manufacturing process to produce active substance batches exhibiting consistent particle size 
distribution at both manufacturing sites. The data presented show that the active substance particle 
size distribution has no effect on the finished product content uniformity. Additional clinical data 
demonstrate that the performance of oral brigatinib is dependent on the rate of brigatinib absorption in 
the gastrointestinal tract rather than being limited by disintegration of the dosage form or dissolution 
of the active substance in the stomach. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The active substance has 
been assessed for compatibility with a range of commonly used pharmaceutical excipients suitable for 
immediate release solid oral dosage forms. An excipient compatibility study using twelve excipients 
was conducted with binary and ternary mixtures supporting the choice of excipients. 
Initial clinical studies were performed using Formulation-0. Subsequently, a 30 mg tablet formulation, 
Formulation-1, was developed to accommodate continued clinical trials and the intended commercial 
dosage form. Minor formulation optimisations led to Formulation-2 allowed for improvements in 
manufacturability, as did Formulation-3. Formulation-3 is the intended commercial formulation used at

EMA/696925/2018

finished product manufacturing sites for the manufacture of 30 mg, 90 mg, and 180 mg tablets. This 
formulation was used in Phase 3 clinical studies. In vitro dissolution studies to compare batches 
manufactured at different sites showed equivalent dissolution profiles. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated in terms of its ability to 
detect differences in formulation and process variability.  
The product is available in round wide mouth high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with two piece 
polypropylene child resistant screw cap closures with foil induction seal liners. Each bottle contains an 
HDPE canister containing a molecular sieve desiccant. 
The product is also available in clear thermoformable polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) blisters with 
heat  sealable  paper  laminated  foil  lidding  in  a  carton.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Alunbrig  film-coated  tablets  are  manufactured  from  a  common  blend  by  a  standard  manufacturing 
process.  
The  finished  product  manufacturing  sites  incorporate  slightly  different  equipment,  but  the  equipment 
class, operating principles and each unit of operation are comparable for the manufacturers. 
Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been defined for the medicinal product. The available 
development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale 
batches fully support the proposed PARs. However, no regulatory flexibility (variation of multiple 
parameters at a time which would constitute a design space) is claimed. 
It has been demonstrated during production of clinical and development batches that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of the intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. A process validation scheme has been provided which is deemed acceptable. 
Process validation will be carried out on a minimum of three commercial scale batches of each of the 
tablet strengths prior to commercialization. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description  (visual),  identity  (FT-IR,  RP-HPLC),  assay  (RP-HPLC),  degradation  products  (RP-HPLC), 
uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  water  content  (KF),  dissolution  (RP-HPLC)  and  microbial 
enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
The omission of XRPD analysis for the finished product is justified based on data showing that the 
desired polymorphic form (form A) does not change when the finished product is stored under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for 6 months and in an open dish for 24 weeks. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 56 pilot to production scale batches of the finished product manufactured at 
the manufacturing sites and using the active substance from active substance manufacturing sites 
were provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Assessment Report - Alunbrig 
EMA/696925/2018  
Page 22/132 
 
 
 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 60 batches including each strength of the finished product and both manufacturers 
stored for up to 12 months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches 
of  medicinal  product  are  representative to those  proposed  for  marketing  and were  packed  in primary 
packaging  representative  of  the  ones  proposed  for  marketing.  Active  substance  sourced  from  the 
manufacturers was used in different batches of finished product. It is noted that the active substance 
manufacturing  processes at  both  manufacturers  are  essentially  the  same.  Therefore,  finished  product 
registration  batches  are  considered  representative  of  commercial  product  produced  with  active 
substance. 
Finished  product  may  be  packaged  in  either  HDPE  screw  cap  bottles  or  a  Aclar  /  foil  blisters.  As 
described in ICH Q1D, Bracketing and Matrixing Designs for Stability Reduced design has been applied 
in the case of Alunbrig tablets. For 30 mg, 90 mg, and 180 mg tablets packaged in HDPE bottles, there 
are multiple fill counts for each tablet strength, where the bottle size, closure and inclusion of desiccant 
remain  unchanged.  Consequently,  a  bracketing  design  for  each  tablet  strength  has  been  used  within 
the  registration  stability  protocols  in  order  to  assess  the  stability  profile  of  multiple  packaging 
configurations,  where  the  high  and  low  tablet  fill  counts  represent  the  bracketing  extremes.  A 
bracketing design was not used for the blister strip packaging configuration (all tablet strengths). 
Samples were tested for description (visual), assay (RP-HPLC), degradation products (RP-HPLC), water 
content  (KF),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.)  and  microbial  enumeration  (Ph.  Eur.)  The  analytical  procedures 
used are stability indicating. 
Overall, there were no significant trends or changes in description, assay and dissolution results for the 
registration lots throughout the duration of testing under long-term and accelerated storage conditions. 
The  description,  assay  and  dissolution  results  are  generally  consistent  for  registration  lots  (of  all 
strengths) when packaged in bottle and blister configurations. Specified degradant has been observed 
in 30 mg registration lots at the accelerated and long term storage conditions. Additionally, degradant 
is also observed in 90 mg and 180 mg registration lots at the accelerated storage conditions. Although 
reportable  levels  of  the  degradant  show  a  slight  increase  during  storage,  all  degradant  results  for  all 
registration lots at all conditions are well within the qualified specification limit throughout the duration 
of testing. Linear regression analyses of the available stability data for all three strengths (i.e. 30 mg, 
90 mg, 180 mg) demonstrate that specified degradant will remain within the specified limit for at least 
36 months at 30 °C / 75%RH. 
In addition, two batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products. Available photostability results showed no significant change in 
the  description,  assay,  degradants,  water  content  and  dissolution  profile  of  brigatinib  tablets,  30  mg 
and 180 mg. Therefore, the finished product is not considered photosensitive. 
An  in-use  period  of  60  days  has  been  proposed  for  all  dosage  strengths.  Stability  data  has  been 
provided  for  30  mg  tablets  at  the  beginning  of  shelf  life.  The  results  demonstrate  that  all  test 
parameters  are  well  within  the  specification  through  60  days  of  testing  which  is  beyond  the  intended 
use period (1 month patient supply). Based on available data, the in-use period is considered justified. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months with no special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and the finished 
product and their manufacturing processes. However, no design spaces were claimed for either. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.1.  Introduction 
All safety pharmacology in vivo studies as well as the pivotal toxicology studies were conducted in 
compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Regulations. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Four sets of studies were performed to assess the primary pharmacodynamic activities of brigatinib.  
A broad in vitro screen was conducted to understand the kinase selectivity profile of brigatinib, and a 
crystal structure of brigatinib in complex with ALK was determined. In addition, the anti-ALK and anti-
ROS1 activities of brigatinib were characterized through a series of in vitro and in vivo studies. These 
studies included assessment of the mechanism, potency, and specificity of kinase target inhibition by 
brigatinib. Cell lines used include those derived from NSCLC and anaplastic large cell lymphoma 
(ALCL), as well as engineered cell lines. Because brigatinib also inhibits certain mutant variants of 
EGFR, studies were also performed to analyze anti-EGFR activities.

Analysis of the In vitro Kinase Profile of Brigatinib and its Primary Metabolite, AP26123 (ARP227) 
The  in  vitro  kinase  activity  screens  showed  that  brigatinib  inhibits  both  wild  type  ALK  and  several 
known ALK mutant variants including G1202R with IC50 values of 0.5 to 4.9 nM.  
The metabolite AP26123 inhibited ALK, 4 members of the EGFR family of kinases, IGF-1R, and INSR, 
with potency similar to, or slightly reduced (by ≤4.5-fold) than that of brigatinib.

The highest levels of brigatinib detected, all at 2 h, were 579, 1829, and 2731 ng/mL and AUCs were 
3039,  11827,  and  26211  hr.ng/mL  for  the  10,  25,  and  50  mg/kg  doses,  respectively.  Compared  to 
vehicle-treated mice, greater than 90% inhibition of p-ALK was observed in tumours at the 2 and 10 h 
time  points  for  all  3  brigatinib  dose  levels.    At  24  h,  p-ALK  levels  were  inhibited  by  60%,  83%,  and 
90%, in the 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. Plasma concentrations of crizotinib at 25 
and 50 mg/kg (2 h and AUC) were comparable to concentrations of brigatinib at the same doses (e.g 
levels at 2 h were 2000, and 4049 ng/mL, respectively); however the degree of p-ALK inhibition in the 
tumour was less than that observed with brigatinib (eg, 11% and 31% at 24 h). In general, including 
analysis of mice treated with 100 mg/kg crizotinib, plasma levels of crizotinib that were at least 3-8-
fold greater than brigatinib were required to achieve a similar level of p-ALK inhibition in the tumour. 
Oral  Efficacy  Study  of  Brigatinib  in  a  Subcutaneous  Xenograft  Model  Using  the  H3122  Human  NSCLC 
Cell Line (ARP202) 
Brigatinib  induced  a  dose-dependent  inhibition  of  tumour  growth,  with  significant  tumour  regression 
(p<  0.01)  achieved  at  all dose levels.  Relative  to  the  tumour  size  before treatment,  tumour  size  was 
reduced by 36% at the 10 mg/kg dose level and by >90% at the 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg dose levels.  
Tumour  regression  was  maintained  for  at  least  60  days  after  treatment  ended  in  the  25  mg/kg,  and 
higher, dose groups. All dose levels used in this study were well tolerated with no clinical signs or drug 
related mortality at any dose level.

The  highest  levels  of  brigatinib  were  detected  2  h  post  dosing.    A  concomitant  decrease  in 
phosphorylation  of  signalling  proteins  downstream  of  ALK,  including  ERK,  AKT,  STAT3,  and  S6,  was 
also observed.

regression  (p<0.001)  achieved  at  all  dose  levels.  Relative  to  vehicle  treated  mice,  brigatinib  induced 
tumour  regression  by  66%,  82%,  85%,  and  89%  at  the  5,  10,  25,  and  50  mg/kg  dose  levels,

Effect of Brigatinib on Viability of Ba/F3 cells Expressing Native EML4-ALK, and 17 Resistance Mutants, 
Compared to Crizotinib, Ceritinib and Alectinib (ARP618) 
A panel of Ba/F3 cell lines was engineered so their viability was dependent on activity of a native 
EML4-ALK fusion, or 17 variants with secondary mutations in the ALK kinase domain that have been 
associated with clinical or nonclinical resistance to crizotinib, ceritinib, and/or alectinib. Brigatinib was 
found to potently (IC50 <200 nM), and selectively (>15-fold selectivity over ALK-negative cells), 
inhibit viability of all 17 ALK variants. These include the mutations most commonly associated with 
clinical resistance to crizotinib (L1196M and G1269A) and the only mutation thus far associated with 
clinical resistance to all three approved ALK inhibitors (G1202R).

Mutant EML4-ALK Tumour Model 
ROS1 Inhibitory Activity of Brigatinib 
In  cellular  and  in  vivo  assays  such  as  the Effect  of Brigatinib  on  Signalling  and  Viability  of  Ba/F3  Cell 
Lines Expressing ROS1 Fusions (ARP622) and Oral Efficacy Study of Brigatinib in a Ba/F3 CD74-ROS1 
Subcutaneous Tumour Model (ARP623), brigatinib inhibited ROS1 with potency similar to that of ALK. 
Brigatinib  inhibited  viability  of  Ba/F3  cells  expressing  ROS1  fusions  observed  in  NSCLC  patients  with 
IC50s of 16-31 nM. Once daily oral administration of 50 mg/kg brigatinib induced tumour regression in 
mice implanted with such tumours. 
EGFR Inhibitory Activity of Brigatinib 
In cellular and in vivo assays, brigatinib exhibited varying levels of activity against mutant variants of 
EGFR. 
The variant that was most sensitive to brigatinib was EGFR-Del, which contains a deletion in exon 19 
and is one of the two most common activated EGFR variants in NSCLC patients. Brigatinib inhibited the 
viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing EGFR-Del (ARIAD  Report ARP624) with an  IC50 of 95 nM and once 
daily  oral  administration  of  25  mg/kg  brigatinib  induced  tumour  regression  in  mice  implanted  with  a 
NSCLC  cell  line  expressing  EGFR-Del  (ARIAD  Report  ARP216).  In  contrast,  brigatinib  inhibited  EGFR-
L858R  (the  second  most  common  activated  variant),  and  variants  containing  an  activating  mutation 
and  a  T790M  resistance  mutation,  less  potently  in  cellular  assays  (IC50s  272  -  489  nM).  In  ARIAD 
Report  ARP205,  the  IC90s  for  inhibition  of  variants  containing  a  T790M  resistance  mutation  (IC90s 
2461-2968  nM)  were  greater  than  the  IC90s  for  variants  containing  activating  mutations  alone, 
especially EGFR-Del (IC90 314 nM). Consistent with these Reports ARP219 and ARP625, once daily oral 
administration  of  50  mg/kg  brigatinib  to  mice  did  not  significantly  inhibit  growth  of  a  patient-derived 
tumour containing EGFRL858R/ T790M. Brigatinib did not inhibit native EGFR activity in a cellular assay 
(IC50 >3000 nM).

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In  secondary  pharmacology  studies  brigatinib  exhibited  minimal  off-target  activity  against  a  panel  of 
targets,  indicating  lack  of  promiscuity  for  binding  to  non-specific  pharmacological  effectors.  In  the 
presence  of  10  μM  brigatinib,  only  2/62 targets  (3%)  were  inhibited  by  ≥50%  (sigma  receptor  [non-
selective] and sodium ion channel [site 2]). In comparison, 10 μM crizotinib inhibited 11 targets (18%) 
by ≥50% (including sigma receptor and sodium ion channel) (ARP630).  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Brigatinib  plasma  concentration  multiples  are  reported  relative  to  the  human  steady  state  GeoMean 
Cmax  of  1452  ng/mL  (2485  nM)  at  the  180  mg  QD  dose  of  brigatinib  (hereafter  referred  to  as  “the 
human Cmax”). 
In vitro hERG study (Report No. AA778105 non-GLP): Brigatinib was tested in a non-GLP hERG assay 
to  determine  the  potential  to  impair  cardiac  repolarization.  The  IC50  in  this  study  was  determined to 
be >10µM which is well above the human Cmax concentration (2458 nM). 
Cardiopulmonary  Assessment 
in  Radiotelemetry  Instrumented  Cynomolgus  Monkeys  (69507 
GLP): Administration of brigatinib resulted in acute effects of small decreases in heart rate (8 to 10%) 
at all dose levels and pulse pressure (8 to 9%) at 20 and 30 mg/kg from 1 to 6 hours post-dose. There 
were  also  brigatinib-related  delayed  effects  (generally  manifesting  32-42  hours  post-dose)  that 
resulted  in  higher  heart  rate  (20  and  30  mg/kg),  systolic  blood  pressure  (10,  20,  and  30  mg/kg), 
diastolic blood pressure (30 mg/kg), mean arterial blood pressure (30 mg/kg), and body temperature 
(30  mg/kg).  Delayed  respiratory  effects  (manifesting  19-42  hours  post-dose)  included  increased 
respiratory  frequency  at  20  and  30  mg/kg.  Brigatinib  administration  did  not  result  in  any  changes  in 
ECG waveform morphology, ECG intervals (PR, QRS, QT or QTcB), or minute volume.   
Neurofunctional  safety  pharmacology  study  in  rats  (6900915):  There  were  no  brigatinib-related  CNS 
effects noted. The NOEL was 100 mg/kg. 
Renal System (6900893): The lowest dose of 25 mg/kg administered to the male Sprague-Dawley rat 
resulted  in  moderate  increases  in  urea  nitrogen  and  creatinine  in  the  blood.  Doses  of  50  and  100 
mg/kg resulted in an increase in urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose, and a decrease in triglycerides 
and  phosphate  in  the  blood,  as  well  as  an  increase  in  creatine  kinase  in  the  blood.  Additionally, 
increased urinary phosphorus fractional excretion and decreased urine creatinine were noted at 50 and 
100 mg/kg, and increased fractional urinary sodium excretion was noted at 100 mg/kg. The NOEL was 
25 mg/kg.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies were performed.

Single Dose Pharmacokinetic Studies of Brigatinib in Multiple Species 
Brigatinib was well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract despite being an efflux substrate. The oral 
bioavailability  in  rat  and  monkey  was  approximately  40%  to  53%.  Brigatinib  was  of  low  clearance  in 
rat and monkey, with a moderate volume of distribution, and moderate-to long elimination half-life. In

vitro, brigatinib was moderately bound (64.1% to 73.0%) to mouse, rat, monkey, and human plasma 
proteins.  Brigatinib  did  not  show  preferential  distribution  into  red  blood  cells  over  plasma  in  mouse, 
rat, monkey, and human blood.

Note: Values in the table represent the mean or mean ± SD of n=3 animals 
Distribution: 
[14C]brigatinib-derived  radioactivity  was  widely  distributed  to  tissues  of  albino  and  pigmented  rats 
reaching  Cmax  in  most  tissues  at  or  before  4  h  post-dose  in  albino  rats  and  at  or  before  24  h  post-
dose  in  pigmented  rats,  and  declined  thereafter.  The  tissues  of  albino  and  pigmented  rats  with  the 
highest  relative  tissue  concentrations  (range:  51.942  to  253.475  μg-equiv/g)  were  small  intestine, 
thyroid, liver, stomach, Harderian gland, pituitary gland, kidney cortex, spleen, adrenal gland medulla, 
and pigmented eye uvea. High concentrations were also present in the alimentary canal contents, bile, 
and  urine,  which  demonstrated  that  both  renal  and  biliary  excretion  were  routes  of  elimination  of 
brigatinib.  Tissues  with  the  lowest  concentrations  (<2.0  μg-equiv/g)  in  albino  and  pigmented  rats 
included the central nervous system, eye lens, white adipose, and bone. Although Cmax in the uvea of 
the  eye of  the pigmented rats  was  higher  (177.806 μg-equiv/g  at  24  h)  than  that  observed in  albino 
rats  (Cmax  of  7.545  μg-equiv/g  at  0.5  h),  the  concentrations  of  radioactivity  in  the  eye  uvea  of 
pigmented  rats  showed  a  steady  but  slow  decline  from  24  to  672  h  post-dose.  Drug-related 
radioactivity  was  detected  in  the  brain  of  Sprague  Dawley  rats  with  a  combined  area  under  the 
concentration-time  curve  from  time  0  to  infinity  (AUC∞)  of  5.73  μg-eq*hr/g  across  the  cerebellum, 
cerebrum, and medulla. In addition, drug-related radioactivity was measurable in the spinal cord with 
an AUC∞ of 5.11 μg-eq*hr/g.

Metabolism 
The  in  vitro  metabolite  profiles  in  rat,  monkey,  and  human  liver  microsomes  and  hepatocytes  were 
qualitatively  similar.  All  in  vitro  metabolites  of  brigatinib  in  human  liver  microsomes  and  hepatocytes 
were  also  observed  in  mouse,  rat  or  monkey  liver  microsomes  and/or  hepatocytes.  The  primary 
metabolic pathway of brigatinib in liver microsomes across all species tested and in human hepatocytes 
was N-demethylation to form M36 (N-desmethyl brigatinib; AP26123). The major metabolite in mouse, 
rat  and  monkey  hepatocytes  was  M21  (brigatinib  GSH  conjugate),  while  M36  (AP26123)  was  the 
second most abundant metabolite in rat and monkey hepatocytes. In rat and monkey hepatocytes the 
minor metabolites included M4 and M21a (brigatinib GSH conjugates), M5 (hydroxy-brigatinib-ene GSH 
conjugate),  M22  (brigatinib  N-oxide;  AP32831);  M25  (brigatinib  N-oxide;  AP32830),  and  M13 
(monooxy-brigatinib glucuronide). 
In  vivo,  following  oral  administration  of  [14C]brigatinib  to  rats,  monkeys,  and  humans,  metabolite 
profiles  were  qualitatively  similar  with  no  unique  human  metabolites  observed.  N-demethylation  was 
the  primary  biotransformation  pathway  of  brigatinib  leading  to  the  formation  of  M36  (N-desmethyl 
brigatinib;  AP26123).  The  parent  drug,  brigatinib,  was  the  major  circulating  radioactive  component 
accounting for approximately 75-92% of total radioactivity (TRA) in plasma accompanied by <10% of 
M36 (AP26123). In humans, the oxidative metabolite M36 (AP26123) accounted for 3.5% of the total 
circulating radioactivity and <10% of parent AUC.  
Elimination 
The predominant route of elimination of brigatinib in rats, monkeys, and humans was fecal excretion, 
although in humans renal excretion also contributed to drug elimination (Report No. ARP609, ARP610, 
and  ARP611).  Excretion  of  radioactivity  was  essentially  complete  in  all  species.  Unchanged  brigatinib 
accounted for 55.74%, 14.58%, and 26.49% of the radioactive dose in rat, monkey, and human feces, 
respectively.  In  urine,  unchanged  brigatinib  accounted  for  5.18%,  5.02%,  and  21.38%  of  the 
radioactive dose in rat, monkey, and human  urine,  respectively and 2.89% of the radioactive dose in 
rat bile. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In  vitro  studies  indicated  that  CYP2C8  and  CYP3A4  are  the  major  isozymes  responsible  for  brigatinib 
metabolism, with minor contribution from CYP3A5. In vitro, brigatinib and its metabolite, AP26123, did 
not  inhibit  CYP1A2,  2B6,  2C8,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6,  or  3A4/5  at  clinically  relevant  drug  concentrations. 
IC50  values  for  reversible  inhibition  of  CYPs  by  brigatinib  and  AP26123  were  >100  μM;  the  only 
exception was the IC50 of 72.9 μM (brigatinib) and 63.8 μM (AP26123) for inhibition of midazolam 1’-
hydroxylation mediated by CYP3A4/5. The Ki values (IC50/2) for brigatinib and AP26123 are 36.5 μM 
and 31.9 μM, respectively. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Two species were selected based on in vitro metabolism data. The cynomolgus monkey has also been 
used to study toxicology in line with other ALK TKIs.

AP26113: brigatinib 
Genotoxicity 
The  in  vitro  studies  of  genotoxicity  showed  that  brigatinib  is  toxic  to  the  cells  and  induced  cell  cycle 
arrest (9600382, 9600383, and 9800314). However, the in vivo chromosomal aberration test showed 
that  brigatinib  demonstrated  potential  for  clastogenic  effects  caused  by  disruption  of  the  mitotic 
apparatus  through  micronuclei  formation  in  bone  marrow  polychromatic  erythrocytes  of  male  rats, 
when tested up to the MTD of 125 mg/kg/day.

No local tolerance studies were performed. In the repeat dose toxicity studies, gastrointestinal toxicity 
was observed in animals that were terminated moribund. Furthermore, erosions atrophy and/or 
necrosis was observed in the gastrointestinal system in both nonclinical species used. Clinical signs 
consisting of emesis and/or loose stools were also observed in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity  
A study was performed to ascertain the potential of brigatinib following a single PO dose of 15, 30 or 
60 mg/kg/day to cause ocular or dermal toxicity in pigmented rats (20011745).

Impurities 
No separate studies were performed to qualify impurities or metabolites. AP26123 was identified as an 
impurity in the drug substance, and a level of NMT 0.5% was proposed by the Applicant. AP26123 was 
also found to be a metabolite in both rat, cynomolgus monkey and human. In the nonclinical species 
used in the repeat dose studies (rat and cynomolgus monkey), AP26123 was detected in the 
toxicokinetic assessments, and AP26123 was identified as a metabolite of AP26113.

Considering the above data, brigatinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
Brigatinib is not readily biodegradable. However based on the results of the short and chronic toxicity 
assessment, the Daphnia reproduction and zebra fish early life cycle test it is unlikely that brigatinib 
drug product will pose a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Brigatinib is a novel, orally-active tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Primary targets are activated, mutant 
forms of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), which play important roles 
in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancers.  
In several in vitro kinase assays as well as cell based assays brigatinib was showed to inhibit ALK 
as  well  as  17  mutated  variants  of  ALK,  including  G1202R.  The  G1202R  mutation  is  associated  with 
resistance  to  treatment  with  the  currently  approved  ALK  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors.  Brigatinib  inhibits 
both native and mutated ALK at lower concentrations, and clinical Cmax following 180 mg/day is above 
the determined IC90 in all cases. However, the lower daily dose of 90 mg/day does not give the same 
result, where the IC90 of G1202R exceeds the projected Cmax.  
In  the  in  vivo  studies  brigatinib  was  shown  to  inhibit  tumour  growth  as  well  as  cause  tumour 
regression  at  lower  doses  than  crizotinib  across  several  tumour  models  expressing  e.g.  EML4-ALK  or 
NPM-ALK.  At  doses  of  up  to  50  mg/kg/day  of  brigatinib,  tumour  regression  and  inhibition  of  ALK 
signalling  was  achieved,  and  the  doses  utilised  was  well  tolerated.  In  study  ARP621,  intracranial 
tumours were generated in SCID mice, and the mice were subsequently treated with brigatinib (25 or 
50 mg/kg/day). Mean survival time was increased in all treated groups, 62 days to more than 64 days 
(25  and  50  mg/kg/day  respectively),  compared  to  28  days  for  the  control  group.  The  Applicant 
speculates  that  the  efficacy  of  brigatinib  in  this  mouse  model  of  brain  tumours  would  be  due  to 
enhanced CNS penetration, however, this was not shown in the tissue distribution studies, where CNS 
was highlighted as a tissue with very little brigatinib associated radioactivity. Although no evidence on 
CNS  penetration  was  shown,  it  is  supported  that  brigatinib  administered  orally,  does  show  efficacy 
towards brain tumours in mice. 
The  safety  pharmacology  studies  showed  that  following  a  single  dose  of  brigatinib  there  were  effects 
on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, as well as the renal system. No effects were observed 
in the CNS study. Brigatinib did not show any potential for QT prolongation or neurofunctional effects, 
but  identified  potential  for  pulmonary  effects  (altered  respiration  rate;  1-2x  the  human  Cmax  at  the 
MHRD),  cardiovascular  effects  (altered  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure;  at 0.5x  the  human  Cmax  at  the 
MHRD),  and  renal  effects  (reduced  renal  function;  at  1-2.5x  the  human  Cmax  at  the  MHRD)  (SmPC, 
section 5.3). In the clinical setting, renal effects such as proteinuria, haematuria and renal impairment 
have  been  noted  in  lung  cancer  patients  treated  with  brigatinib,  and  suggest  a  potential  clinical 
correlate  of  the  nonclinical  renal  safety  pharmacology  findings.  Pulmonary  (dyspnoea,  hypoxia)  and 
cardiovascular (bradycardia) effects have been in noted in cancer patients treated with brigatinib and 
suggest a potential correlation with the nonclinical cardiovascular and pulmonary safety pharmacology 
findings.  In  the  toxicity  studies,  brigatinib  had  a  multitude  of  effects,  including  moribundity  and 
mortality at high doses. Toxicological effects were noted in multiple organs such as the gastrointestinal 
tract,  eye,  kidney,  lung,  liver,  heart,  pancreas,  testes/epididymis,  bone,  hematopoietic  system,  and 
immune-system related organs. The principal dose-limiting nonclinical toxicities were gastrointestinal, 
cardiac,  and  renal  effects.  The  systemic  exposure  associated  with  key  toxicities  in  rat  and  monkey 
general toxicology studies and the rat embryofoetal study was generally at or below the human AUC.  
Adverse  reactions  seen  in  animals  at  exposure  levels  similar  to  clinical  exposure  levels  with  possible 
relevance  to  clinical  use  were  as  follows:  gastrointestinal  system,  bone  marrow,  eyes,  testes,  liver, 
kidney,  bone,  and  heart.    These  effects  were  generally  reversible  during  the  non-dosing  recovery 
period;  however,  effects  in  the  eyes  and testes  were  notable exceptions  due to lack  of  recovery  (see 
section 5.3 of the SmPC).

EMA/696925/2018  
Page 48/132 
 
 
 
In repeated dose toxicity studies, lung changes (foamy alveolar macrophages) were noted in monkeys 
at ≥ 0.2 x the human AUC; however, these were minimal and similar to those reported as background 
findings in naive monkeys, and there was no clinical evidence of respiratory distress in these monkeys. 
Carcinogenicity  studies  have  not  been  performed  with  brigatinib  which  is  acceptable,  as  brigatinib  is 
intended for treatment for advanced cancer.  
Brigatinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) or the mammalian cell 
chromosomal aberration assays, but slightly increased the number of micronuclei in a rat bone marrow 
micronucleus  test.  The  mechanism  of  micronucleus  induction  was  abnormal  chromosome  segregation 
(aneugenicity)  and  not  a  clastogenic  effect  on  chromosomes.  This  effect  was  observed  at 
approximately five fold the human exposure at the 180 mg once daily dose. 
In  an  embryo  foetal  development  study  in  which  pregnant  rats  were  administered  daily  doses  of 
brigatinib  during  organogenesis;  dose  related  skeletal  anomalies  were  observed  at  doses  as  low  as 
approximately 0.7 times the human exposure by AUC at the 180 mg once daily dose. Findings included 
embryo lethality, reduced foetal growth, and skeletal variations. 
Brigatinib may impair male fertility. Testicular toxicity was observed in repeat-dose animal studies. In 
rats,  findings  included  lower  weight  of  testes,  seminal  vesicles  and  prostate  gland,  and  testicular 
tubular  degeneration;  these  effects  were  not  reversible  during  the  recovery  period.  In  monkeys, 
findings  included  reduced  size  of  testes  along  with  microscopic  evidence  of  hypospermatogenesis; 
these  effects  were  reversible  during  the  recovery  period. Overall,  these  effects  on  the  male 
reproductive  organs  in  rats  and  monkeys  occurred  at  exposures  ≥ 0.2-times  the  AUC  observed  in 
patients  at  the  180 mg  once  daily  dose.  No  apparent  adverse  effects  on  female  reproductive  organs 
were  observed  in  general toxicology  studies in  rats and  monkeys  (see  section  5.3  of the  SmPC).  The 
risk of embryofetal and developmental toxicity as a potential risk in the RMP and the effects on male 
and/or female fertility as missing information (see RMP). 
Brigatinib showed no evidence of cutaneous or ocular phototoxicity after a single oral administered to 
pigmented Long-Evans rats. 
The metabolite AP26123 and the impurities present in the brigatinib lots have been qualified in pivotal 
general toxicology studies. 
On the basis of the submitted ERA, brigatinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Additionally, population PK analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of subject characteristics. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Single dose and steady state PK was investigated in the clinical study AP26113-11-101 in patients. 
Clinical studies to investigate food effect, drug-drug interactions, ethnobridging Caucasian/Japanese, 
bioequivalence and mass balance (ADME) was conducted in healthy subjects. 
The two LC-MS-MS based bioanalytical methods for brigatinib and the metabolite, AP26123, in human 
plasma are adequately validated. Assay performance, in terms of inter-assay precision and inter-assay 
relative error is considered acceptable.  
The brigatinib PK was best described by a three-compartment model with delayed, first-order 
absorption. A flexible transit compartment absorption model (TCAM) was included to describe variable 
absorption between subjects.

Absorption 
Brigatinib is an oral administered ALK inhibitor. The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily for one 
week followed by 180 mg once daily. 
In Study 101, following administration of a single oral dose of brigatinib (30-240 mg) in patients, the 
median time to peak concentration (Tmax) was 1-4 hours postdose. After a single dose and at steady 
state, systemic exposure was dose proportional over the dose range of 60-240 mg once daily. Modest 
accumulation was observed upon repeated dosing (geometric mean accumulation ratio: 1.9 to 2.4). 
The geometric mean steady state Cmax of brigatinib at doses of 90 mg and 180 mg once daily was 
552 and 1452 ng/mL, respectively, and the corresponding AUC0-τ was 8165 and 20276 h∙ng/mL, 
respectively (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
•  Bioavailability 
The absolute oral bioavailability of brigatinib in humans has not been determined.  
• 
Influence of food 
In two separate studies, brigatinib absorption under fasting and fed conditions was evaluated. In both 
the exploratory (AP26113-13-103), as well as the pivotal food-effect studies (AP26113-16-109), 
plasma brigatinib Cmax was reduced by 24%(AP26113-13-103),  to 13%(AP26113-16-109) and Tmax 
was delayed by 3.0 to 3.5 hours with a high fat meal. However, in both food effect evaluations, 
changes in the initial rate of absorption did not result in changes in the overall exposure of brigatinib 
(either AUC0-t or AUC0-inf). In the pivotal clinical studies, patients were instructed to self-administer 
brigatinib orally without regards to meals.

Two clinical studies (Study AP26113-15-106 and Study AP26113-16-110) have been conducted to 
establish the bioequivalence of brigatinib 90 and 180 mg oral tablets to 30 mg oral tablets in healthy 
volunteers. 
Bioequivalence Study 90 mg versus 30 mg Tablet (Study AP26113-15-106): Median brigatinib Tmax 
was 2.0 hours postdose for three 30 mg tablets (range 1 to 4 hours) and 2.5 hours postdose for one 
90 mg tablet (range 1 to 6 hours). The observed GeoMean Cmax was similar for the 2 treatments, with 
values of 354.8 ng/mL for three 30 mg brigatinib tablets and 352.7 ng/mL for one 90 mg brigatinib 
tablet. GeoMean values for AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were also similar following administration of three 30 
mg brigatinib tablets (6680 h•ng/mL and 6737 h•ng/mL, respectively) and one 90 mg tablet (6924 
h•ng/mL and 7133 h•ng/mL, respectively).

Bioequivalence Study 180 mg versus 30 mg Tablet (Study AP26113-16-110): Median brigatinib Tmax 
was similar between the two treatments - 2.0 hours postdose for six 30 mg tablets (range 1 to 6 
hours) and 2.0 hours postdose for one 180 mg tablet (range 1 to 4 hours). The observed GeoMean 
Cmax was similar for the 2 treatments, with values of 756.5 ng/mL for six 30 mg brigatinib tablets and 
766.3 ng/mL for one 180 mg brigatinib tablet.  
Geometric mean values for AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were also similar following administration of six 30 mg 
brigatinib tablets (13614 h•ng/mL and 13881 h•ng/mL, respectively) and one 180 mg tablet (13229 
h•ng/mL and 13466 h•ng/mL, respectively). Variation in Cmax and AUC0-t was moderate for both 
treatments, with geometric CVs of 36.9% and 37.6%, respectively, for the six 30 mg tablets and 
36.1% and 36.7%, respectively, for the one 180 mg tablet. The mean and median brigatinib t½ values 
for both treatments were similar.

Distribution 
In patients given brigatinib 180 mg QD, (study AP26113-11-101) the GeoMean (coefficient of 
variation; CV%) apparent volume of distribution unadjusted for bioavailability (Vz/F) of brigatinib at 
steady state was 153.4 L (46.6%).  Brigatinib has high in vivo binding to plasma proteins (91 %) and 
low affinity to human red blood cells (0.69 blood/plasma partition ratio). 
Results from in vitro transporter studies suggest that brigatinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but 
not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2K, or BSEP. 
Elimination 
In  vitro  studies  indicate  that  CYP2C8  and  CYP3A4  are  the  major  isozymes  responsible  for  brigatinib 
metabolism,  with  minor  contribution  from  CYP3A5.Metabolic  clearance  is  mainly  N-demethylation 
(forming  the  active  metabolite  M36)  and  cysteine  conjugation.  The  contribution  of  the  cysteine 
conjugation pathway is minor compared to demethylation. No multi-modality in the observed clearance 
distribution  was  identified  and  impact  of  genetic  polymorphisms  in  CYP2C8  and  CYP3A  on  PK  is  not 
expected. AP26123 is an active metabolite with comparable PK, though a slightly longer T½ and similar 
or  slightly  reduced  potency  against  ALK  and  EGFR.  The  metabolite  accounted  for  <  3.5  %  of  the 
circulation radioactivity in the ADME study.  
An ADME/mass balance study was conducted with [14C]-Brigatinib in healthy volunteers (Study 
AP26113-13-104). Of the 180 mg [14C]brigatinib oral dose administered, 47.87%, 26.88%, and 9.09% 
of the radioactive dose was excreted as unchanged brigatinib, M36 (N-desmethyl brigatinib; AP26123), 
and M28 (brigatinib cysteine conjugate), respectively in urine and feces combined. The estimated 
CLss/F of brigatinib at the recommended 180 mg dose is 12.71 L/h (CV=67.5%, N=63). The median 
terminal elimination half-life of brigatinib at steady state at a dose of 180 mg QD was 23.9 hours, 
resulting in a 2-fold accumulation at steady state. Following oral administration of [14C]brigatinib, 
parent brigatinib was the major circulating radioactive component accounting for 91.5% of the plasma 
radioactivity. AP26123 was the principal metabolite observed and was present at 3.5% in the plasma. 
In patients, at steady state, the plasma AUC of AP26123 was < 10% of brigatinib exposure. 
The total recovery of a 180 mg [14C]brigatinib dose was 89.75±1.44%, of which 24.99±1.89% and 
64.76±2.36% were recovered in urine and feces, respectively.  Unchanged brigatinib represented 41% 
and 86% of the total radioactivity in faeces and urine, respectively, the remainder being metabolites.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
•  Dose proportionality 
Dose proportionality was assessed in study AP26113-11-101. After single (C1D1) and repeated (C2D1) 
doses, systemic exposure increased in a dose-dependent manner in the dose range of 30–240 mg QD. 
A dose proportional increase in brigatinib Cmax and AUC0-τ was observed over the dose range of 60-
240 mg QD. At the 90 mg and 180 mg QD doses, the GeoMean steady state Cmax was 552.02 and 
1451.7 ng/mL, respectively, and the corresponding AUC0-τ was 8164.6 and 20276 h∙ng/mL, 
respectively. At the brigatinib oral dose of 180 mg QD, for the evaluable 63 patients, GeoMean 
estimates (CV%) of CLss/F, apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) and half-life were 12.7 L/h 
(67.5%), 153.4 L (46.6%) and 23.9 h (29.9%), respectively. These characteristics lead to modest 
drug accumulation (mean accumulation ratio [SD] in 180 mg cohort was 2.1 [0.4] at steady state). 
•  Time dependency 
In study AP26113-11-101, at the brigatinib oral dose of 180 mg QD, for the evaluable 63 patients, 
GeoMean estimates (CV%) of CL ss/F, apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) and half-life were 12.7 L/h 
(67.5%), 153.4 L (46.6%) and 23.9 h (29.9%), respectively. Mean accumulation ratio [SD] in 180 mg 
cohort was 2.1 [0.4] at steady state. 
 In Study AP26113-13-201, GeoMean steady state predose (trough) brigatinib concentrations at steady 
state in Cycles 2, 3, 4, and 5 were similar, and ranged from 168.2 to 225.5 nanogram (ng)/mL for 
90 mg QD (Arm A), and 398.0 to 466.9 ng/mL for 90 mg QD → 180 mg QD. This was in close

agreement with GeoMean concentrations of 226.3 and 519.9 ng/mL at 24 hours following the Cycle 2 
Day 1 dosing at 90 mg and 180 mg QD, respectively, in Study AP26113-11-101. 
Special populations  
Population PK analyses of pooled data from 5 clinical studies with brigatinib (AP26113-11-101, 
AP26113-13-201, AP26113-13-102, AP26113-13-103, and AP26113-15-105) evaluated the effect of 
body weight, sex, age, race, liver enzyme levels, and creatinine clearance (CLCR) on brigatinib PK. 
•  Race 
Ethnobridging Study (Study AP26113-13-102) was a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, 
single ascending dose study of orally administered brigatinib in healthy subjects (24 Japanese and 24 
Caucasian subjects). Single doses of brigatinib tested were 90 mg, 120 mg and 180 mg administered 
under fasting conditions. The arithmetic mean Cmax increased with increase in dose for Japanese and 
Caucasian subjects over the dose range of 90 mg to180 mg. There was also higher variability for both 
Cmax and AUC0-∞ with Caucasians compared with Japanese. The mean AUC0-∞ increased from 
6064 h•ng/mL and 6782 h•ng/mL for Japanese and Caucasian subjects at 90 mg, respectively, to 
9910 h•ng/mL and 12149 h•ng/mL for Japanese and Caucasian subjects at 180 mg, respectively.  
•  Elderly 
No studies have been performed to evaluate brigatinib pharmacokinetics in elderly patient populations. 
As part of the integrated population pharmacokinetic analysis completed for brigatinib the effect of 
baseline patient age (years) was considered. The median (range) age of the PopPK study population 
(n=443) was 52 (19 to 83) years. Brigatinib CL/F was identified to decrease with increasing age by 
0.7% per year. A subject of 75 years old is expected to have a 29.2% lower CL/F compared to a 20 
year old subject which corresponds to a 41.2% higher AUC0-24.

Impaired renal function 
Clinical study AP26113-15-108, is an open-label, single-dose, parallel-group, in-patient, non-
randomized study, investigating the effect of chronic renal impairment on brigatinib clearance. 
Unbound AUC0-INF was 94% higher in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min, N=6) 
as compared to patients with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min, N=8). 
PK in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment has not been investigated, though this was 
originally planned.  
The pharmacokinetics of brigatinib is similar in patients with normal renal function and in patients with 
mild or moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min) based on the results of population 
pharmacokinetic analyses. 
Creatinine clearance was not found to be a relevant covariate in the Pop PK analysis.

Impaired hepatic function 
Clinical  study  AP26113-15-107  was  an  open-label,  single-dose,  parallel-group, 
in-patient, 
non-randomized  study  conducted  in  subjects  with  varying  grades  of  chronic  hepatic  impairment  (6 
patients  with  Child-Pugh  A,  B,  C,  respectively)  and  9  matched  healthy  volunteers.  Unbound  PK 
parameters  were  unaffected  by  mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  A  and  B),  but 
patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  C)  had  increased  exposure,  including  a  37  % 
increase  in  AUC0-inf  compared  to  healthy  subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function.  Hepatic  CYP3A  is  the 
major  CYP  isozymes  (51  %)  responsible  for  brigatinib  metabolism,  and  CYP2C8  a  minor  metabolic 
pathway (15 %). 
The  population  PK  analysis  dataset  included  369  subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function,  68 subjects 
with mild hepatic impairment, 5 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, and 1 subject with severe 
hepatic impairment. Brigatinib CL/F and dose-normalized AUC estimates were similar between subjects 
with normal hepatic impairment and subjects with mild hepatic impairment. 
• 
Age, body weight and albumin 
No paediatric studies have been conducted. 
Relevant  covariates  with  potential  to  influence  distribution  and/or  elimination  of  brigatinib  were 
investigated. Age, body weight and albumin were found in the Pop PK analysis to have impact on the 
PK of brigatinib.  
Weight as covariate had impact on PK in the PopPK analysis with increase in clearance (CL/F increase 
with  1.0%  for  every  kg  increase  in  body  weight)  and  therefore  decrease  in  exposure.  Age  was  a 
significant covariate in the PopPK analysis with a CL/F decrease of 0.6 % per year. Brigatinib CL/F was 
identified  to  increase  with  increasing  albumin  concentrations.  Across  a  normal  range  of  albumin 
concentrations of 34 to 54 g/L, CL/F is expected to change  30.4% (from 11 L/h to 14.4 L/h). 
Body weight quartiles had considerable overlap for AUCt,ss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss. Though a clear trend of 
reduction in exposure with increasing body weight was observed, this had no clinical impact on safety 
and efficacy.  
• 
Intra-/inter-individual variability 
In  the  clinical  study  AP26113-11-101,  PK  parameters  were  estimated  for  brigatinib  in  patients 
receiving escalating oral doses (range 30-240mg) on Day 1 of cycles 1 and 2. Moderate to high degree 
of  inter-individual  variability  was  observed  in  the  Cmax  and  AUC  for  both  C1D1  and  C2D1  (CV% 
ranging from 11% to 119 %).  Inter-occasion variability % for Cmax and AUC0-t/24 in healthy subjects 
and  patients  was  <  17  %  and  ≤  47%  respectively.    The  median  time  to  peak  concentration  (Tmax) 
was 1 to 4 hours postdose. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro studies do not indicate that either brigatinib or the metabolite AP26123 have the potential to 
inhibit other CYP-enzymes and cause drug-drug interactions in vivo if co-administered with 
medications primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or  CYP2D6. 
Brigatinib is a substrate of the transporters P-gp and BCRP and has in vitro inhibitory effect on both P-
gp, BCRP, OCT1, MATE1 and MATE2K at clinically relevant concentrations. No further in vivo studies 
have been conducted to investigate these transporters.

As part of the PBPK analysis, 2 separate models were developed. One model (Model A) assumed that 
the  unchanged  brigatinib  in  faeces  was  due  to  unabsorbed  drug,  and  therefore  assigned  a  fraction 
absorbed (fa) of 0.63 on the basis of the mass balance data from Study AP26113-13-104. The second 
model  (Model  B)  used  a  fa  value  of  1,  based  on  the  assumption  of  complete  absorption  of  brigatinib 
and  attribution  of  biliary  clearance  to  explain  the  unchanged  drug  in  faeces.  Importantly,  both  PBPK 
models were able to generate plasma concentration-time profiles and exposures of brigatinib that were 
consistent with observed data. Additionally, both models were able to capture the observed effects of 
itraconazole and rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of brigatinib. The PBPK model-predicted geometric 
mean  Cmax  and  AUC  ratios  for  brigatinib  with  and  without  itraconazole  coadministration  were  within 
1.10-fold  and  1.04-fold  of  the  observed  values  for  Model  A  and  Model  B,  respectively.  Similarly,  the 
PBPK model-predicted geometric mean Cmax and AUC ratios for brigatinib with and without rifampicin 
coadministration were within 1.20-fold and 1.28-fold of the observed values for Model A and Model B, 
respectively.  The  comparable  results  between  the  two  PBPK  models  indicate  that  the  disposition  of 
brigatinib can be explained irrespective of the underlying mechanism (ie, incomplete absorption, biliary 
clearance) responsible for the presence of unchanged brigatinib in the faeces.Because Model B included 
a  biliary  clearance  component  for  brigatinib,  it  was  used  to  assess  the  worst-case  scenario  for  P-gp 
inhibition  by  assuming  that  a  virtual  P-gp  inhibitor  completely  abrogated  biliary  clearance.  The 
predicted geometric mean Cmax and AUC ratios for brigatinib in the presence versus absence of such a 
virtual  P-gp  inhibitor  were  1.07  and  1.41,  respectively.  This  worst  case  41%  increase  in  brigatinib 
systemic exposure (AUC) is not thought to be clinically meaningful when considered in the context of 
the  observed  variability  in  AUC  (62%  coefficient  of  variation  in  the  area  under  the  plasma 
concentration-time curve during a dosing interval [AUC0-tau] after repeat dose administration of 180 
mg in Study AP26113-11-101). 
The DDI study AP26113-15-105 was conducted to determine if strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 
(gemfibrozil and itraconazole, respectively) and a strong inducer of both enzymes, as well as P-gp, 
(rifampin) alter the single dose PK of brigatinib in healthy subjects. The DDI study was a single-center, 
3-part, open-label, single-dose, 1-sequence, crossover study of the effects of gemfibrozil (Part 1), 
rifampin (Part 2), and itraconazole (Part 3) when each inhibitor or inducer was coadministered with 
brigatinib in healthy subjects.

Itraconazole:  Co-administration  with  brigatinib  caused  an  increase  in  Cmax  of  21.2  %,a  2-

The  potential  for  reversible  DDIs  via  inhibition  of  CYP3A4/5  by  brigatinib  has  been investigated  using 
PBPK modelling. The predicted geometric mean Cmax and AUC ratios for midazolam with and without 
co-administered  brigatinib  were  both  1.07,  which  indicates  that  brigatinib  is  unlikely  to  produce 
clinically significance inhibition of CYP3A in vivo. 
Model-predicted  changes  in  brigatinib  systemic  exposures  during  coadministration  with  moderate 
CYP3A  inhibitors  (e.g.,  verapamil  and  diltiazem)  or  inducers  (e.g.,  efavirenz)  were  also  investigated 
using  PBPK  modelling  and  were  found  to  be  similar  irrespective  of  the  estimated  unbound  fraction 
value. AUC of brigatinib was increased by approximately 40 % when coadministered with verapamil or 
diltiazem according to the PBPK model. No uniform dose reduction is required, but patients should be 
closely monitored. The PBPK model predicted a significant decrease in brigatinib AUC if coadministered 
with efavirenz. Coadministration of brigatinib with moderate CYP3A inducers should be avoided.

Mechanism of action 
Brigatinib was designed to be a potent, selective inihibitor of ALK capable of overcoming mechanisms 
associated  with  resistant  to  other  ALK  inhibitors  including  crizotinib,  ceritinib  and  alectinib,  including 
point mutations in the ALK kinase domain (KD). 
Brigatinib is a substantially more potent inhibitor of ALK than crizotinib. Across a panel of 8 ALK+ cell 
lines,  brigatinib  inhibited  ALK  (median  50%  inhibitory  concentration  of  10  nanomolar  [nM])  with  12-
fold greater potency than crizotinib. In in vivo models, compared to brigatinib, higher dose and plasma

levels  of  crizotinib  were  required  to  achieve  a  similar  degree  of  efficacy  and  ALK  inhibition  (see  non-
clinical aspects). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Brigatinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of ALK in in vitro kinase assays. The activity of EML4-ALK 
and 17 mutated forms were inhibited in vitro by ≤ 500 nM brigatinib, i.e. therapeutic concentrations.  
The steady state GeoMean Cmax (2485 nM), free Cmax (852 nM), and Cmax values corrected for the 
functional  effects  of  protein  binding  (1243  nM)  in  patients  dosed  with  brigatinib  at  180  mg  QD, 
exceeded the IC90 values for native ALK (38 nM) and all 17 ALK resistance mutants tested (range 22-
762  nM),  including  L1196M  and  G1202R  (study  AP26113-11-101).  Brigatinib  has  a  12-fold  higher 
potency than crizotinib in vitro.

Secondary pharmacology 
No  thorough  QT  study  has  been  conducted.  Brigatinib  has  a  low  potential  to  cause  QT  prolongation 
based  on  in  vitro  hERG  data,  and  non-clinical  studies  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  did  not  find  significant 
ECG changes following 28 days administration.  
Changes  from  baseline  in  QTc  interval  were  investigated  in  the  clinical  study  AP26113-11-101.  The 
mean  change  from  baseline  for  QTcF  ranged  from  -5.1  ms  to  +8.8  ms  over  the  dose  groups  without 
any relationship to dosage. Among all patients treated with brigatinib the mean time averaged change 
from baseline for QTcF was -0.1 ms. No patient had an increase in QTcF > 60 ms or a new QTcF > 500 
ms. Based on an independent review of the ECGs identified by the centralized core lab as having new 
morphologic  ECG  findings,  no  patients  developed  new  abnormal  U  waves.  Approximately  15%  of 
subjects  met  the  non-specific  criterion  of  a  30-60  ms  change  from  baseline  among  the  various  dose 
groups  without  any  correlation  with  brigatinib  dosage.  There  was  no  exposure-response  relationship 
between brigatinib concentration and QTcF identified the study.  
Exposure-response relationship 
Exposure-response analysis has been conducted with data from two clinical studies.  
In study AP26113-13-201 brigatinib exposure parameter was Ctrough at steady state. There was overall 
no significant association between brigatinib exposure (in quartiles) and objective response. Response 
was  high  across  all  exposure  cohorts  and  quartiles  of  exposure.  Patients  with  confirmed  intracranial 
objective  response  had  higher  exposure.  A  trend  of  increased  probability  of  SAEs,  EOPE  and 
discontinuations was seen with higher Cmax and higher GeoMean trough showed a trend in more SAEs 
and  Grade  3  events.  A  clear  trend of  higher exposure  in lower  weight patients  is  seen,  but  without  a 
clinical relevant impact on safety or efficacy.  
Data from the two studies AP26113-11-101 and AP26113-13-201 support the recommended dose with 
90  mg  once  daily  for  a  week  followed  by  180  mg  once  daily.  High  and  durable  response  rates  are 
observed with the recommended dose with no increasing trend with higher exposure and an up going 
trend for AEs with higher exposure supports not to dose higher than 180 mg once daily.  
Dosing recommendations for brigatinib are based on a combination of factors: primarily based on 
clinical efficacy and safety findings, supported by PK and exposure response analyses as well as 
nonclinical studies.  
In the pivotal study, Study AP26113-13-201, comparing 90 mg QD to 90 mg QD → 180 mg QD, the 
following is observed:  
1. A numerical increase in investigator-assessed confirmed ORR (53.6% [97.5% CI: 42.6, 
64.5] for 90 mg QD → 180 mg QD and 44.6% [97.5% CI: 34.0, 55.6] for 90 mg QD), 
supported by IRC assessments (52.7% [95% CI: 43.0, 62.3] for 90 mg QD → 180 mg QD and 
48.2% [95% CI: 38.7, 57.9] for 90 mg QD).  
2. A clinically meaningful difference in PFS median values (12.9 vs 9.2 months) favoring 90 mg 
QD →180 mg QD vs 90 mg QD and a post-hoc analysis to aid in dose selection that showed HR 
for PFS between doses of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.86). In addition, the IRC-assessment of PFS 
(15.6 vs. 9.2 months, respectively; post-hoc HR of 0.57 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.89]) supported the 
investigator-assessed PFS findings. 
3. Greater intracranial, IRC-assessed confirmed ORR for 90 mg QD →180 mg QD vs. 90 mg 
QD, particularly in patients with measurable, active metastases (at baseline) (73.3% [11/15]

and 42.1% [8/19]), but also in patients with measurable metastases (66.7% [12/18] vs. 
42.3% [11/26])  
4. Higher 1 year probability of survival (OS) for 90 mg QD →180 mg QD (79.5%) vs. 90 mg 
QD (70.6%) 
5. Fewer discontinuations due to documented progressive disease in 90 mg QD →180 mg QD 
(14.5% [16/110]) vs. 90 mg QD (25.9% [29/112]). 
6. Fewer deaths within 30 days of last dose of study drug for 90 mg QD → 180 mg QD ([14.6% 
[18/123] in 90 mg mg QD vs. 6.5% [9/138] in 90 mg QD →180 QD] and specifically due to 
neoplasm progression (8.1% [10/123] in 90 mg QD vs. 3.6% [5/138] in 90 mg QD →180 mg 
QD]  
The safety findings in Study AP26113-13-201 suggest that brigatinib has an acceptable safety profile 
for both regimens evaluated. Deaths due to disease is the largest risk in this patient population. The 
most common cause of death during treatment or within 30 days of last dose was neoplasm 
progression and there were fewer such deaths in this timeframe in Arm B (Arm A vs Arm B: 8.3% vs 
3.6%); deaths due to non-disease progression AEs are actually higher in Arm A, suggesting this 
difference is not a treatment related effect.  
The PK data from Study AP26113-11-101 showed that the average steady state brigatinib plasma 
concentrations in patients dosed at 90 mg QD or 180 mg QD were found to exceed the IC50 values for 
native EML4 ALK and all 17 resistance mutants by at least 2-fold, with the exception of the G1202R 
mutant. 
Overall, for Study AP26113-11-101 in patients with advanced malignancies, the combination of high 
response rates and long PFS in the lower quartiles of exposure, along with fewer early 
discontinuations, a lower risk of early onset pulmonary adverse events, and a lower risk of SAEs 
supported the doses chosen for further evaluation study: 90 mg QD and 180 mg QD with 7-day lead-in 
at 90 mg QD.

2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of brigatinib has been thoroughly investigated in both healthy subjects and 
patients and has been described using non-compartmental analysis and population PK model. The 
pharmacokinetics of brigatinib and relevant covariates have been adequately described, including PK 
studies in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. Population PK analysis was conducted to 
evaluate the effect of subject characteristics. 
In healthy subjects, compared to overnight fasting, a high fat meal reduced brigatinib Cmax by 13% 
with no effect on AUC. Brigatinib can be administered with or without food (SmPC section 5.2). 
Brigatinib was moderately bound (91%) to human plasma proteins and binding was not concentration 
dependent.  In patients given brigatinib 180 mg once daily, the geometric mean apparent volume of 
distribution (Vz/F) of brigatinib at steady state was 153 L, indicating moderate distribution into tissues. 
The flat dose of 180 mg QD is appropriate for the expected weight range. 
Pop PK analysis indicated that no dose adjustments are necessary in patients with either mild renal or 
hepatic  impairment.  No  dose  adjustment  of  Alunbrig  is  required  for  patients  with  mild  hepatic 
impairment  (Child-Pugh  class  A)  or  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  class  B).  A  reduced 
starting  dose  of  60 mg  once  daily  for  the  first  7 days,  then  120 mg  once  daily  is  recommended  for 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 
Creatinine clearance was not found to be a relevant covariate in the Pop PK analysis and no dose 
adjustment of brigatinib is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min). However, a clear trend is observed for a decrease in 
clearance and an increase in AUC for patients with mild and especially moderate renal impairment. A 
reduced starting dose of 60 mg once daily for the first 7 days, then 90 mg once daily is recommended 
for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC). Patients with severe renal impairment should be closely monitored for new or worsening 
respiratory symptoms that may indicate ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnoea, cough, etc.) particularly in 
the first week (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).  
The Population PK analysis identified body weight, age and albumin to have impact on the PK of 
brigatinib. Exposure is decreased in patients with high body weight and higher in patients with low 
body weight, but without a clinical relevant impact on safety or efficacy. The changes related to age 
and albumin are not considered to be clinically relevant. The limited data on the safety and efficacy of 
Alunbrig in patients aged 65 years and older suggest that a dose adjustment is not required in elderly 
patients. There are no available data on patients over 85 years of age (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Brigatinib is a substrate of the transporters P-gp and BCRP. P-gp is involved in the blood-brain barrier.  
No further in vivo studies have been conducted to investigate these transporters. One of the reasons is 
that the result of 123 reported digoxin DDI clinical studies 35 indicated that interactions of digoxin (the 
recommended P-gp substrate) with P-gp inhibitors are limited, i.e., P-gp inhibitors did not increase 
digoxin AUC or Cmax. In vitro studies have shown that brigatinib inhibits both P-gp and BCRP. However, 
given that brigatinib exhibits high solubility and high permeability, inhibition of P gp and BCRP is not 
expected to result in a clinically meaningful change in the systemic exposure of brigatinib. No dose 
adjustment is required for Alunbrig during coadministration with P gp and BCRP inhibitors. 
Coadministration of brigatinib with substrates of P-gp, (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran, colchicine, 
pravastatin), BCRP (e.g., methotrexate, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine), organic cation transporter 1

(OCT1), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1), and 2K (MATE2K) may increase their plasma 
concentrations. Patients should be closely monitored when Alunbrig is coadministered with substrates 
of these transporters with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran, methotrexate). 
Brigatinib is metabolized mainly by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. A clinical DDI study in healthy subjects has 
been conducted to investigate the effect of CYP3A/CYP2C8 inhibitors and CYP3A inducer to brigatinib 
PK.  
Concomitant administration of brigatinib with a strong CYP3A4 inducer or a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 
gave the expected results with decrease and increase respectively in PK exposure (Cmax and AUC). 
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors with Alunbrig, including but not limited to certain 
antivirals (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin, 
telithromycin, troleandomycin), antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, voriconazole), mibefradil, and 
nefazodone should be avoided. If concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, the 
dose of Alunbrig should be reduced by approximately 50% (i.e. from 180 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg 
to 60 mg). After discontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, Alunbrig should be resumed at the dose 
that was tolerated prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor (see sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the 
SmPC). 
Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem and verapamil) may increase the AUC of brigatinib by 
approximately 40% based on simulations from a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. No 
dose adjustment is required for Alunbrig in combination with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Patients 
should be closely monitored when Alunbrig is coadministered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (SmPC, 
section 4.5).. 
Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may also increase plasma concentrations of brigatinib and should be 
avoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
The result of the study with the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor gemfibrozil together with PBPK modelling 
indicated that the effect of gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics of brigatinib is not clinically 
meaningful. No dose adjustment is required during coadministration with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors. 
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers with Alunbrig, including but not limited to rifampicin, 
carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, and St. John’s wort should be avoided (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC).  
Moderate CYP3A inducers may decrease the AUC of brigatinib by approximately 50% based on 
simulations from a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. The concomitant use of moderate 
CYP3A inducers with Alunbrig, including but not limited to efavirenz, modafinil, bosentan, etravirine, 
and nafcillin should be avoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
In vitro studies in hepatocytes have shown that brigatinib is an inducer of CYP3A4. Clinical drug-drug 
interaction studies with CYP3A sensitive substrates have not been conducted. Brigatinib may reduce 
plasma levels of coadministered medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP3A. 
Therefore, coadministration of Alunbrig with CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., 
alfentanil, fentanyl, quinidine, cyclosporine, sirolimus, tacrolimus) should be avoided as their 
effectiveness may be reduced. 
Alunbrig  may  also  induce  other  enzymes  and  transporters  (e.g.,  CYP2C,  P-gp)  via  the  same 
mechanisms responsible for induction of CYP3A (e.g., pregnane X receptor activation). 
A clinical DDI study in patients to evaluate the net effect of repeated dosing of brigatinib on the single-
dose pharmacokinetics of the sensitive CYP3A substrate, midazolam is recommended.

Other TKIs have been associated with QT prolongation, and no thorough QT study has been conducted 
with brigatinib. ECG and exposure data are available from study AP26113-11-101 and no effect on ECG 
elements of significance was found. Few patients included in the ECG investigation have been dosed 
with the therapeutic dose.  
Exposure-Response analyses were conducted as part of clinical studies 101 and 201. In general, no 
associations were observed between GeoMean trough brigatinib plasma concentrations and confirmed 
ORR or PFS in the two clinical studies. In addition, higher Ctrough was associated with a trend for 
higher probability of SAEs or Grade 2 or higher AEs.   
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall,  the  clinical  pharmacology  of  brigatinib  has  been  adequately  addressed  in  a  structured  and 
rationale designed clinical development program.  
2.1.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of brigatinib in the proposed indication is supported by three clinical studies, a phase 1/2 
study (AP26113-11-101), and a pivotal phase 2 study (AP26113-13-201), and top-line results from a 
phase 3 study (AP 26113-13-301). 
2.2.  Dose response study 
Study AP26113-11-101: A (study 101): A Phase 1/2 Study of the Safety, Tolerability, 
Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Anti-Tumor Activity of the Oral ALK/EGFR Inhibitor 
AP26113 
This on-going open-label study was designed in two parts: a dose escalation phase using a 3+3 design 
to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), followed by an expansion cohort. The initial dose 
escalation  cohort  included  patients  with  advanced  malignancies  (other  than  leukaemia).  Eligible 
patients were over 18 years of age, had measurable disease by RECIST v1.1, had ECOG performance 
status 0 or 1 and were refractory to available therapies. Daily doses of brigatinib were escalated from 
30  mg  to  300  mg  orally.  The  expansion  phase  included  mainly  patients  with  ALK+  advanced  NSCLC. 
The  initial  RP2D  was  180  mg  QD  (see  section  on  clinical  pharmacology).  However,  based  on  safety 
findings  of  early  onset  pulmonary  events  (EOPEs),  the  180  mg  QD  dose  was  not  evaluated  further. 
Instead, 90 mg QD and 90 mg QD for 7 days followed by escalation to 180 mg QD (90 /180 mg) were 
tested in the phase 2 portion. Overall response rate (ORR) by investigator assessment was the primary 
efficacy endpoint.  
At the data cut-off of 31/05/2016, a total of 137 patients were enrolled and dosed. For the purpose of 
the  analysis,  dose  groups  were  collapsed  and  data  from  dose  escalation  and  expansion  cohorts  were 
combined.  The  study  population  included  79  patients  with  ALK+  NSCLC;  the  majority  had  been 
previously treated with crizotinib: 71/79. A total of 50 ALK+ NSCLC patients had brain metastases at 
baseline. The median duration of treatment for patients with ALK+ NSCLC was 20 months. The median 
age of ALK+ NSCLC patients in the study was 54 years. Females made up 49%. ECOG status was 0 for 
34% and 1 for 65%. The majority (94%) had adenocarcinoma.   
The  90  /180  mg  group,  corresponding  to  the  proposed  dose  for  this  application,  included  25  ALK+ 
NSCLC  patients  previously  treated  with  crizotinib.  In  this  group,  19/25  patients  (76.0%;  95%  CI 
54.9%,  90.6%)  had  a  confirmed  objective  response,  of  which  3/25  (12.0%;  95%  CI:  2.5%,  31.2%) 
showed  a  confirmed  complete  response  (CR).    The  median  time  to  response  was  1.9  months  (range 
1.2 – 6.0 months). The KM estimate median duration of response (n=19) was 26.1 months (95% CI:

7.9,  26.1).  The  KM  estimate  of  median  PFS  was  16.3  months  (95%  CI:  9.2,  not  reached).  Median 
overall survival (KM estimate) was not reached.

Study AP26113-13-201: A Randomized Phase 2 Study of AP26113 in 
Patients with ALK-positive, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Previously 
Treated with Crizotinib 
Methods 
This was a phase 2, open-label, randomized, multicentre, international study of the efficacy and safety 
of brigatinib in patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib. All patients were 
randomized to one of two regimens of brigatinib until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. There 
was no placebo or active control arm. 
After end of treatment, or in the event of premature discontinuation, patients were followed up every 3 
months (e.g. for survival and subsequent anticancer therapy) for 2 years after the last patient enrolled 
in the study.

Treatments 
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive brigatinib 90 mg QD (Arm A) or 90/180 mg QD (i.e. 90 mg 
QD for 7 days then 180 mg QD) (Arm B). A cycle comprised 28 days of treatment. Brigatinib was taken 
orally with 240 mL of water, with or without food.  
Patients were dosed with brigatinib until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Treatment could be 
continued after progression, at the discretion of the investigator. Patients allocated to the 90 mg QD 
group could be escalated to 180 mg QD at progression. 
The drug product was supplied as 30 mg tablets (formulation 3).  
Palliative and supportive care was permitted during the study. However anticancer therapy or 
extensive surgery was prohibited for the duration of the study. Patients with CNS lesions requiring 
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) were allowed to continue study drug after appropriate interruption, as 
determined by the investigator; however, for analysis purposes, these patients were considered to 
have progressive disease (PD).  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of brigatinib, as evidenced by confirmed ORR (by 
investigator), in patients with ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose disease has 
progressed on therapy with crizotinib.  
The secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
To  further  characterize  the  efficacy  of  brigatinib  in  patients  with  ALK+,  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic  NSCLC  whose  disease  has  progressed  on  therapy  with  crizotinib,  as  shown  by 
disease control rate, time to response, duration of response, PFS, OS, and time on treatment. 
To  assess  CNS  response  and  PFS,  per  RECIST  v1.1,  in  those  patients  who  had  active  brain 
metastases. 
To assess the safety and tolerability of brigatinib in study patients.

• 
• 
To measure steady state plasma levels of brigatinib for use in population PK modelling. 
To  assess  patient-reported  symptoms  and  health-related  quality-of-life  (HRQoL)  with  the 
European  Organisation  for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer  (EORTC)  Quality  of  Life 
Questionnaire (QLQ) C30 (v3.0). 
Exploratory objectives were: 
•  Correlation of brigatinib exposure with both efficacy and safety. 
•  Correlation of tumour and plasma biomarkers with brigatinib efficacy and safety. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint, confirmed ORR assessed by the investigator, was defined as the proportion of 
patients who were confirmed to have achieved CR or PR, as determined per RECIST v1.1; confirmed 
responses were those that persisted on repeat imaging 4 weeks or more after initial response. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Confirmed ORR assessed by IRC.  
For randomized patients with active brain metastases at enrollment:

Sample size 
Assuming that the true ORR is 35% a total of 109 subjects in each treatment regimen is needed in 
order to have approximately 90% power to rule out the uninteresting rate of 20% at a two-sided alpha 
level of 0.025 using exact binomial test.  
Randomisation 
Patients  were  allocated  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  each  dosing  regimen  (Arm A  and  Arm B)  in  a  randomized 
manner, and with two stratification factors: 
• 
• 
Brain metastases at baseline (present vs absent) 
Best response to prior crizotinib therapy as assessed by the investigator (complete response 
[CR] or partial response [PR] vs any other response or status unknown)

Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  endpoint  was  ORR  and  the  95%/97.5%  confidence  intervals  were  calculated  as  exact 2-
sided binomial confidence intervals. The study was considered to have achieved the primary endpoint, 
if  the  ORR  was  shown  to  be  significantly  higher  than  20%  at  a  two-sided  alpha  level  of  0.025  at  the 
final analysis for that regimen.  
Patients were stratified at randomisation by brain metastases at baseline (present vs absent) and best 
prior response to crizotinib therapy (CR or PR vs any other response or status unknown).

Seventy-one investigational sites in 18 countries enrolled 222 patients into the study from the 
following regions: Asian Pacific region (68 patients), Europe (105 patients), and North America (49 
patients). The study is ongoing. The last patient was randomized on 21/09/2015. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments: 
The original protocol (dated 27 June 2013) was amended twice, with an additional third amendment 
applicable only to South Korea.  
Protocol amendment 1 (dated 03 February 2014) made the following key changes to the original 
protocol. 
•  Adjusted the study design to allow for randomization into two different study arms, each with a 
different dosing regimen (90 mg QD or 180 mg QD with a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg QD). 
• 
Increased enrolment projections to fill both study arms (and added at least 6 more months to 
accrue patients). 
•  Updated the statistical testing methods to address both study arms. 
•  Updated the clinical summary of data from the phase 1/2 study of brigatinib, including an 
assessment of the respiratory events and reports of early onset pulmonary syndrome. 
•  Updated the sections describing sampling for molecular genetic testing to allow for analysis of 
various tumour and plasma biomarkers as is feasible at different sites. 
Assessment Report - Alunbrig 
EMA/696925/2018  
Page 73/132 
 
 
 
•  Modified the wording of protocol eligibility criteria to further clarify the type of patients to be 
enrolled. 
Protocol deviations: There were 42 protocol deviations considered by the Sponsor as major (e.g. 
involving inclusion or exclusion criteria, prohibited concomitant medication).

Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT population of 222 patients (i.e. all patients randomized to 
each regimen were analysed according to randomized allocation). Sensitivity analyses were conducted 
using the per-protocol population, which excluded 33 patients (22 without confirmed baseline ALK 
rearrangement by Vysis FISH test). The median follow-up time at the time of data extraction 
(31/05/2016) was 10.8 months.

Time to Response 
The median time to response among patients with investigator-assessed, confirmed ORR was 1.8 
months (range: 1.7–7.3) for the 90 mg group and 1.9 months (range: 1.0–11.0) for the 90/180 mg 
group. For IRC-assessed response, the respective medians were 1.8 months (range: 1.6-7.3) and 1.9 
months (range: 1.0-9.3).  
Duration of response 
The KM estimate median investigator-assessed duration of response was 12.0 months (95% CI: 7.4, 
not reached) for patients in the 90 mg group and 13.8 months (95% CI: 9.2, not reached) for patients 
in 90/180 mg group.  The KM estimate median IRC-assessed duration of response was 16.4 months 
(95% CI, 7.4-24.9) for patients in the 90 mg group Arm A and 15.7 months (95% CI, 12.8-21.8) for 
patients in 90/180 mg group.

(3.7, 24.9) 
(3.7, NE) 
In patients with any brain metastases at baseline, intracranial disease control rate was 77.8% (95% CI 
67.2-86.3) in the 90 mg arm (N = 81) and 85.1% (95% CI 75—92.3) in the 180 mg arm (N = 74).  
The  KM  median  duration  of  intracranial  response  for  patients  with  measurable  brain  metastases  at 
baseline was 9.4 months (95% CI, 3.7-24.9) in the 90 mg arm  and was 16.6 months (95% CI, 3.7-
NR)  in  the  180  mg  arm.  For  both  arms,  respectively,  61.5%  (8  of  13)  and  41.7%  (5  of  12)  of 
responders had an event. 
The  median  time  to  intracranial  response  among  patients  with  confirmed  intracranial  ORR  was  1.8 
months  (range:  1.6–9.2)  for  Arm  A  (n=12)  and  1.8 months  (range:  1.6–2.3)  for  Arm  B  (n=12)  for 
patients with measurable brain metastases.  
The  KM  estimated  median  intracranial  PFS  for  patients  with  measurable  brain  metastases  at  baseline 
was 11.1 months (95% CI, 5.6-23.7) for patients in the 90 mg arm (11 events, 26 patients [42.3%]) 
and 18.5 months (95% CI, 4.9-NR) for patients in the 180 mg arm (7 events, 18 patients [38.9%]). 
Only Nonmeasurable Brain Metastases: 
 A confirmed CR was observed in 9.1% (5 of 55) of patients in the 90 mg arm and 17.9% (10 of 56) of 
patients in the 180 mg arm. The intracranial disease control rate was 81.8% (27 of 33) of patients in 
the 90 mg arm and 88.9% (32 of 36) of patients in the 180 mg arm. The median time to intracranial 
ORR among patients with confirmed intracranial response was 4.6 months (range: 3.5-7.4) for the 90 
mg arm (n=4) and 2.4 months (range: 1.6-3.8) for the 180 mg arm (n=10).  
Nonmeasurable and Active Brain Metastases:  
It is possible that response could be affected by previous irradiation of CNS metastases, including 
pseudoprogression and therefore intracranial response according to history of CNS irradiation was 
requested and are presented in the below table.

Figure 18: Investigator-Assessed Systemic PFS (ITT Population: by Treatment Group) 
The KM estimate median IRC-assessed PFS was 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.4, 12.8) for the 90 mg group 
(65 events [58.0%]) and 16.7 months (95% CI: 11.6, 21.4) for the 90/180 mg group (54 events 
[49.1%]). In a post-hoc analysis, the HR for IRC-assessed PFS between the two arms was 0.75 (95% 
CI: 0.37, 1.08). 
In sensitivity analysis of investigator-assessed PFS (cut-off 31 May2016), all patients with an observed 
progression or death (regardless of timing) are classified as events. The KM estimate median PFS was 
8.2 months (95% CI: 6.7, 11.0) for the 90 mg group and 12.9 months (95% CI: 10.8, 18.4) for the

The KM median overall survival (OS) is 29.5 months in the 90 mg group (95% CI, 18.2-not reached 
[NR]) and is 34.1 months (95% CI, 27.7-NR) in the 90/180 mg group, with 50 of 112 (44.6%) and 40 
of 110 (36.4%) events observed in the 90 mg group and the 90/180 mg group, respectively. The HR 
observed between the 2 arms is 0.70 (95% CI, 0.46-1.07), 
The 12- and 24-month probabilities of survival were 70.3% and 54.6%, respectively, for patients in 
the 90 mg group and 80.1% and 66.1%, respectively, for patients in the 90/180 mg group.

At baseline the mean (SD) transformed Global Health Status/QOL score, for 216/222 patients in the 
ITT population was 55.44 (25.61), with mean (SD) scores of 52.39 (27.42) for Arm A and 58.49 
(23.40) for Arm B. There was no evidence that Global Health Status/QOL Scale scores differed between 
Arm A and Arm B (p=0.8578).

Ancillary analyses 
Imbalances in baseline characteristics 
The baseline differences that are expected to affect prognosis (age and ECOG performance score) are 
not  balanced  between  the  treatment  groups.  The  Applicant  has  provided  an analysis  on  the  effect on 
the hazard ratio of adjusting for these factors, see below.

The results across endpoints are generally consistent between the unadjusted and adjusted analyses, 
with the adjusted analyses showing similar or lower hazard ratios compared with the unadjusted 
analyses.

Responses by ALK mutation status 
Tumour  tissue  samples  collected  after  progression  on  crizotinib  but  prior  to  initiation  of  brigatinib 
treatment  (baseline),  or  samples  collected  after  disease  progression  on  brigatinib  therapy  (post-
baseline)  were  analyzed  by  DNA  sequencing  using  the  FoundationOne  Next  Generation  Sequencing 
(NGS) platform. Baseline samples were evaluable in 17 patients. ALK rearrangements were detected in 
13/17  patients  centrally  by  NGS  and  secondary  mutations  in  the  ALK  kinase  domain  (KD)  were 
detected in 4/17 patients; secondary mutations were only observed in patients with a NGS-detectable 
ALK rearrangement. Confirmed responses were observed in patients with ALK rearrangements by NGS

in  the  90  mg  and  90/180 mg  group  (PR  in  3/6  and 6/7  patients,  respectively),  including  a confirmed 
PR  in  a  patient  with  the  G1202R  mutation  at  baseline.  Of  the  13  patients  with  NGS-detected  ALK 
rearrangements, confirmed responses were observed in 6 of the 9 patients without secondary ALK KD 
mutations (6 PR), and 3/4 patients with secondary mutations (3 PR). Of the 4 patients in whom no ALK 
rearrangement  was  detected  by  NGS  at  baseline,  1  had  a  confirmed  response  (PR).  A  post-baseline 
tumour  tissue  sample  was  evaluable  in  one  patient  (90  mg  QD).  Two  secondary  ALK  KD  mutations 
were  detected  in  this  sample  -  F1174L  and  E1210K  (both  mutations  in  the  same  ALK  allele).  This 
patient  had  a  confirmed  response  with  a  time  to  progression  of  225  days.  No  baseline  tissue  for  this 
patient was available for analysis.

Supportive studies 
Study 101 provides supportive evidence of efficacy for the proposed dose in the target population (see 
above).  
In addition, top-line results from the ongoing phase 3 trial (AP-26113-13-301) were submitted. 
Top-line results from AP-26113-13-301 
This  study  was  a  phase  3,  randomised,  open-label,  comparative,  multicentre,  international  study  in 
patients  with  advanced  ALK+  NSCLC  who  had  not  previously  received  an  ALK  inhibitor,  or  any  other 
TKI,  or  more  than  one  regimen  of  prior  systemic  therapy  in  the  advanced  setting.  Patients  were 
required  to  have  at  least  one  measurable  lesion  per  RECIST  version  1.1.  ALK  testing  could  be 
conducted locally for eligibility, but confirmed centrally retrospectively. Patients with symptomatic CNS 
metastases  were  excluded.  Patients  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  fashion  to  receive  either  brigatinib  at 
the proposed dose (90 mg → 180 mg QD) or crizotinib (250 mg BID).

Primary endpoint: BIRC-assessed PFS per RECIST 1.1
Statistical considerations: ~270 patients (198 events); 135 per arm to detect a 6-month improvement in PFS 
(HR=0.625), assuming:
• 10-month PFS in crizotinib arm
• 2 planned interim analyses when 50% and 75% of total expected events have been observed

Efficacy Endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  BIRC-assessed  PFS  per  RECIST  v1.1.  Key  secondary  endpoints  were 
confirmed ORR, confirmed intracranial ORR, intracranial PFS and OS. Global health status/quality of life 
(EORTC QLQ C30) and time to deterioration of dyspnoea (EORTC QLQ-LC13) were also evaluated. The 
primary endpoint, PFS by blinded independent review (BIRC) is endorsed, as the study was not blinded 
and  PFS  is  considered  a  clinically  relevant  endpoint  in  the  first-line  palliative  treatment  setting  in  a 
randomized trial. The other secondary endpoints are also appropriate. 
Patients 
The median duration of follow-up is considered short, with 11 and 9.3 months follow-up in each arm. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics reflect the target population: the majority were female, 
never smokers, had stage IV disease and had not received prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. 
Median age was 58 years. Around 30% had intracranial CNS metastases at baseline.

Efficacy Results 
The planned IA shows results after 26.3% events in arm A and 45.7% events in arm B. The analysis 
met the predefined number of events (103) assessed by the investigator, and there were significantly 
more  events  in  patients  receiving  crizotinib.  The  PFS  HR  of  0.492  (95%  CI:  0.33,  0.74)  between  the 
arms is statistically significant.

2.2.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy assessment is based on three studies: 
Study  101  is  an  ongoing  phase  1/2  study  which  included  an  evaluation  of  anti-tumour  activity.  This 
open-label study included a dose-escalation phase followed by expansion cohorts, and provided some 
data relevant to the target population at the proposed dose. 
Study 201 is the pivotal study for this application. This is an ongoing open-label multicentre phase 2 
study  in  patients  with  advanced  ALK+  NSCLC  previously  treated  with  crizotinib.  The  eligibility  criteria 
were appropriate. Patients were randomised 1:1 to brigatinib 90 mg QD or brigatinib 180 mg QD with 
a 7 day lead-in at 90 mg QD (90/180 mg) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The initially 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was determined to be 180 mg QD, but the dose was changed due 
to  acute  dose-related  early  onset  pulmonary  events.  Therefore,  the  phase  II  study  was  designed  to 
test two dosing regimens. 
There  were  a  number  of  protocol  amendments  and  deviations;  however,  these  do  not  affect  the 
interpretation of the study results. The chosen endpoints are appropriate for a phase 2 study.  
Although  this  is  a  randomised  study,  no  placebo  or  active  comparator  arm  has  been  included.  The 
comparison  of  the  proposed  90/180  mg  dose  against  the  90  mg  dose  provides  some  evidence  of 
efficacy in terms of dose response, but it should be noted that the study was not powered for statistical 
comparison between the treatment arms regarding differences in efficacy as the purpose was to assess 
the potential dose effect.  
During  the  procedure,  the  applicant  submitted  top-line  results  from  the  ongoing  phase  3  study  (AP-
26113-13-301), comparing brigatinib and crizotinib in the first-line setting. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study 101, a total of 137 advanced cancer patients were enrolled and dosed, including 79 patients 
with ALK+ NSCLC, of which 71 had been treated with crizotinib. A total of 50 ALK+ NSCLC patients had 
brain  metastases  at  baseline.  The  90  mg/180  mg  cohort  included  25  patients  with  ALK+  NSCLC 
previously treated with crizotinib, and therefore of relevance for this application. In this group, 19/25 
patients  (76.0%;  95%  CI:  54.9%,  90.6%)  had  a  confirmed  objective  response.  The  median  time  to 
response  was  1.9  months  (range  1.2  –  6.0  months).  The  KM  estimate  median  duration  of  response

was  26.1  months  (95%  CI:  7.9,  26.1).  The  KM  estimate  of  median  PFS  was  16.3  months  (95%  CI: 
9.2, not reached). Median overall survival (KM estimate) was not reached in this group. Of those with 
ALK+  NSCLC  previously  treated  with  crizotinib  in  the  90/180  mg  QD  group,  there  were  18  evaluable 
patients  with  brain  metastases  at  baseline,  of  which  8  (44.4%;  95%  CI:  21.5%,  69.2%)  had  a 
confirmed  response  by  IRC.  The  KM  estimate  median  intracranial  duration  of  response  was  11.4 
months (95% CI: 5.6, 11.4) and the KM estimate median intracranial PFS was not reached. 
In  study  201,  a  total  of  222  patients  were  randomised  to  brigatinib  90  mg  (n=112)  or  brigatinib 
90/180  mg  (n=110).  Around  half  were  European. At  the  29  September  2017 data  extraction,  26.6% 
remain in study treatment overall. The median follow-up time is 24.3 months. The phase 2 results are 
considered mature and robust.  
For the primary outcome of confirmed ORR by investigator assessment in the ITT population, the rate 
was 45.5% (97.5% CI: 34.8, 56.5) for the 90 mg group compared to 56.4% (97.5% CI: 45.2, 67.0) 
for the 90/180 mg group. Confirmed CR by investigator assessment was also increased for the 90/180 
mg  group:  4.5%  vs  1.8%.  The  ORR  by  IRC  were  in  line,  however  the  CR  was  higher  in  the  90  mg 
group assessed by IRC (5.4%).  
The  median  time to  response  was  1.8  to  1.9  months.  The  updated  KM estimate  median  investigator-
assessed duration of response was 12.0 months (95% CI: 9.2, 17.7) for patients in the 90 mg group 
and 13.8 months (95% CI: 10.2, 19.3) for patients in 90/180 mg group.   
IRC assessed duration of response was in line. Therefore, responses appear rapid and are durable. The 
updated KM estimate median PFS was 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.4, 11.1) for the 90 mg group and 15.6 
months (95% CI: 11.1, 21.0) for the 90 mg/180 mg group. PFS results by IRC were also in line. PFS is 
considered  more  clinically  meaningful  for  patients  than  ORR.  The  median  PFS  estimate  for  the 
proposed  90/180  mg  QD  regimen  is  significantly  longer  than  that  estimated for  the  lower  dose  of  90 
mg QD, whether investigator or IRC-assessed. 
The  median  OS  estimate  for  brigatinib  is  34.1  months  (95%  CI  27.7-NR)  in  the  90/180  mg  group, 
which is considered encouraging in this post-crizotinib second-line setting. Of note, the median OS for 
crizotinib as first-line treatment is 20.3 months. 
It is acknowledged that patients with brain metastases have a special medical need for efficacy in the 
CNS and that it poses a major problem after crizotinib as approximately 60% of patients are afflicted 
at  the  time  of  second-line  treatment.  Brigatinib  has  shown  promising  efficacy  in  the  CNS,  especially 
regarding  the  intracranial  PFS  of  18.4  months  for  patients  with  ANY  brain  metastases  at  baseline 
(n=73,  measurable  and  non-measurable  only).  For  patients  with  measurable  brain  metastases  at 
baseline (n=12), the ORR is 66.7% (95% CI: 41-86.6). The median duration of intracranial response 
of 16.6 months may be considered unreliable due to the small sample size. However, based on the KM 
estimates, over half of responders maintained response for at least 12 months.  
Subgroup  analyses  for  investigator  assessed  ORR  were  generally  in  line  with  the  overall  outcome, 
bearing  in  mind  that  some  subgroups  are  small.  There  appeared  to  be  improved  outcomes  for  the 
subgroup with a best response to crizotinib of CR/PR compared to other/unknown: 65.8% vs 32.4%. It 
might be expected that tumours sensitive to crizotinib are more likely to be sensitive to brigatinib. 
Patients who never smoked and were former smokers had no clinically significant impact on confirmed 
ORR. However, although numbers are limited, out of the 10 patients who were current smokers, none 
had  an  objective  response  to  treatment  and  this  may  be  an  important  signal.  On  that  basis,  the 
Applicant should analyse the future collected data on this patient population (current smokers) in the 
ongoing 301 study and report them as part of the post-authorisation commitment (Annex II).

Overall, the adjusted (for baseline scores) mean scores for the transformed Global Health Status/QOL 
Scale increased over time up to cycle 7, and tailed off slightly from then onwards, although at cycle 18, 
means  remained  above  baseline  levels.  There  was  no  difference  between  treatment  groups.  Hence, 
there were no detrimental effects on quality of life in the pivotal study compared to baseline. 
In  order  to  select  patients  most  likely  to  benefit  from  treatment,  it  is  important  to  have  an 
understanding of genetic biomarkers such as secondary mutations in the ALK kinase domain that could 
predict  response  to  brigatinib  (or  inform  subsequent  treatment  options).  The  Sponsor  planned  to 
collect  tissue  samples  at  baseline  (after  progression  on  crizotinib),  and  where  possible  after 
progression  on  brigatinib, for  analysis  by  next  genome  sequencing  (NGS).  However,  only  17  baseline 
samples out of a possible 222 samples were evaluable.  The Applicant has provided available data on 
resistance mutations before and after brigatinib, however the clinical data are still limited. During the 
procedure,  data  from  the  expanded  access  program  was  also  submitted  in  support  of  the  efficacy  of 
brigatinib  (data  not  shown).  Eleven  ALK+  NSCLC  patients  previously  treated  with  alectinib  have 
received  brigatinib.  Treatment  outcomes  are  reported  by  the  Applicant,  based  on  physician 
assessments.  Three  patients  who  had  progressed  on  alectinib  responded  to  brigatinib  (1  CR,  2  PR). 
This  data,  although  less  robust  than  clinical  trial  data,  suggests  that  brigatinib  may  overcome  some 
resistance  mechanisms  associated  with  alectinib.  It  is  currently  premature  to  conclude  on  the  actual 
clinical use of these results. However, it is endorsed that the Applicant is collecting tumour and plasma 
samples from patients enrolling in the phase 3 study, as these data may be key in the future handling 
of  ALK-positive  patients  both  up  front  and  in  the  case  of  progression.  The  applicant  should  submit 
these data post-authorisation (Annex II). 
The  Applicant  has  submitted  top-line  results  from  the  ongoing  phase  3  study  (AP26113-13-301), 
comparing brigatinib and crizotinib in the first-line setting.  
The design, dosing and endpoints are generally endorsed; however, the allowance of crossover for the 
patients receiving crizotinib makes the interpretation of the OS results more difficult. 
The median duration of follow-up is considered short, with 11 and 9.3 months follow-up in each arm. 
The planned IA shows results after 26.3% events in arm A and 45.7% events in arm B. The analysis 
met the predefined number of events (103) assessed by the investigator, and there were significantly 
more  events  in  patients  receiving  crizotinib.  The  PFS  HR  of  0.492  (95%  CI:  0.33,  0.74)  between  the 
arms is statistically significant and clinically relevant.  
Confirmed  ORR  by  BIRC  was  70.8%  for  brigatinib  vs  60.1%  for  crizotinib.  Confirmed  complete 
response was 3.6% for brigatinib vs 5.1% for crizotinib. The preliminary results from phase 3 confirm 
the mature efficacy data observed in phase 2. The median DOR was only reached with crizotinib (~11 
months)  although  there  were  97  and  83  patients  in  arm  A  and  B,  respectively,  who  were  evaluable, 
indicating a longer duration of response with brigatinib. The OS data is not mature for assessment at 
this point in time, although no evidence for detrimental effect on survival is observed. 
Intracranial efficacy are assessable for a limited number of patients with measurable CNS metastases, 
i.e. 18 and 21 patients in arm A and B, respectively. For these patients confirmed intracranial ORR was 
14/18  (77.8%)  and  6/21  (28.6%)  for  brigatinib  and  crizotinib,  respectively.  Median  intracranial  DOR 
was  NE  in  the  brigatinib  arm  and  9.2  months  in  the  crizotinib  arm.  Although  numbers  are  small,  the 
difference in intracranial ORR suggests that brigatinib is associated with increased intracranial activity 
compared  to  crizotinib,  supporting  its  efficacy  in  second  line.  The  results  are  also  consistent  when 
evaluating  the  full  ITT  population,  where  there  are  very  few  intracranial  PFS  events  with  brigatinib 
(16.1%) compared to arm B (28.3%).

The applicant is requested to submit the final CSR of study AP26113-13-301 to further characterise the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  brigatinib  which  is  currently  based  on  data  which  requires  confirmation  of 
previous efficacy assumptions (see Annex II) 
2.2.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with crizotinib is demonstrated on the 
basis of high ORR and long duration of response. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
In order to further characterise the efficacy and safety of brigatinib in the treatment of patients with 
ALK-positive NSCLC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the phase III study AP26113-
13-301 comparing brigatinib versus crizotinib in patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC who have not 
previously received ALK-directed therapy. 
2.3.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety database is primarily derived from two studies, a phase 1/2 study (101) and a 
phase 2 study (201). The data extraction date for both studies was 31 May 2016 however updated 
safety data from the 201 study are based on the 29 September 2017 data extraction. Study 201 only 
included patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC who had received prior crizotinib; 110 patients were 
treated at the proposed dose. Therefore, study 201 provides the primary basis for the safety 
evaluation in ALK+ NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib. 
Study AP26113-13-301 (study 301) is an ongoing, phase 3, randomized, multicentre study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of brigatinib in patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC who have not 
previously received ALK-directed therapy. During the procedure, the applicant submitted safety data 
from the 301 study, based on a data extraction date of 19 February 2018. 
The brigatinib expanded access programs (EAPs) were initiated in both Europe and US in 2016 for 
patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  ALK+  NSCLC  with  disease  that  has  progressed  during 
treatment  with  or  is  intolerant  to  at  least  one  prior  ALK  inhibitor.  The  safety  data  from  the  EAPs 
(n=61) consists of reported SAEs, based on a data extraction date of 16 October 2016.

Adverse drug reactions 
The methodology for the identification and presentation of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is presented 
below: 
• 
Pooled  safety  data  from  Study  AP26113-13-201  (data  extraction:  29  September  2017)  and 
Study  AP26113-11-101  (data  extraction:  31  May  2016)  at  the  recommended  dose  of  90  mg 
QD 180 mg QD was used for the ADRs determination. 
•  All  treatment  related  adverse  events  were  reviewed  and  PTs  reported  at  ≥  2%  in  either 
treatment regimen [90 mg (n=123) or 90 mg QD 180 mg QD (n=138)] were determined as 
ADRs. 
 Actual  frequencies  of  these  ADRs  were  based  on  frequencies  of  treatment  emergent  adverse 
events (pooled data) at the recommended dose (90 mg QD 180 mg QD regimen) (n=138). 
The  ADR  table  was  created  considering  both  these  parameters  of  treatment  related  adverse 
events involving percentages from treatment emergent pooled table.  
• 
The  frequency  categories  in  the  tabulated  list  of  adverse  reactions  for  events  fulfilling  the 
causality requirement of ADR were based on the frequencies of all causality AEs (irrespectively 
of investigators’ assessments) to minimize bias.  
•  ADRs  associated  with  chemistry  and  haematology  laboratory  abnormalities  were  identified 
using  laboratory  shift  from  normal/baseline  tables.  A  laboratory  abnormality  was  included  as 
an  ADR  if  the  overall  shift  from  normal/baseline  (all  grades)  percentage  was  ≥20%  in  either 
arm.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
In study 201 and 101, respectively 12 and 10 patient deaths within 30 days of the last dose were not 
lung cancer-related. Based on patient narratives, 1 out of the 12 deaths in study 201 and 5 out of the 
10 deaths in study 101 is possibly related to brigatinib.  
Brigatinib-related  early-onset  pulmonary  events  (EOPEs)  may  have  contributed  to  the  deaths  of  4 
patients, of which 3 patients from study 101 were on doses higher than that proposed (90/180 mg) at 
the onset of the event.

Adverse events of special interest 
Pulmonary Adverse Events: Early Onset Pulmonary Events and Later Onset Pneumonitis Events 
In  study  201,  6.4%  of  patients  experienced  pulmonary  adverse  reactions  of  any  grade,  including 
ILD/pneumonitis, pneumonia and dyspnoea, early in treatment (within 9  days, median onset: 2 days); 
2.7%  of  patients  had  Grade  3-4  pulmonary  adverse  reactions  and  1  patient  (0.5%)  had  fatal 
pneumonia.  Following  Grade  1-2  pulmonary  adverse  reactions,  treatment  with  brigatinib  was  either 
interrupted  and  then  restarted  or  the  dose  was  reduced.  Early  pulmonary  adverse  reactions  also 
occurred  in  study  101  (N  =  137)  including  three  fatal  cases  (hypoxia,  acute  respiratory  distress 
syndrome and pneumonia). 
Additionally,  2.3%  of  patients  in  study  201  experienced  pneumonitis  later  in  treatment,  with  2  
patients having Grade 3 pneumonitis.  
Hepatic events 
In  study  201,  elevations  of  ALT  and  AST  were  reported  in  46%  and  65%  of  patients  treated  with 
Alunbrig, respectively at the 180 mg regimen. For elevations to Grade 3 and 4, the incidences for ALT 
and AST were 5.5% and 3.6%, respectively.  
No patients had dose reductions due to elevation of ALT or AST. 
Elevated creatine phosphokinase 
In study 201, elevations of CPK were reported in 50% of patients treated with Alunbrig at the 180 mg 
regimen. The incidence of Grade 3-4 elevations of CPK was 13.6%. The median time to onset for CPK 
elevations  was  27 days.  Dose  reduction  for  CPK  elevation  occurred  in  6.4%  patients  at  the  180 mg

Serious Adverse Events 
The incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) was similar across the 2 arms (25.0% patients receiving 
brigatinib and 32.8% patients receiving crizotinib).  
SAE in the vascular, psychiatric, respiratory and general disorders SOC disorders were more frequent 
in patients receiving brigatinib. 
SAE in the infestations, eye, ear, gastrointestinal and disorders SOCs were more frequent in Arm B. 
SAE in the neoplasm, nervous system, cardiac, musculoskeletal, renal disorders, investigations, injury

Other Significant Adverse Events 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reduction 
Dose reductions due to TEAEs were reported in 28.7% of patients in the brigatinib arm and 21.2% of 
patients in the crizotinib arm. Dose interruptions due to TEAEs were reported in 52.9% of patients in 
the brigatinib arm and 42.3% of patients in the crizotinib arm.

Overall,  50.7%  of  patients  in  the  brigatinib  arm  and  43.8%  of  patients  in  the  crizotinib  arm  had  at 
least 1 dose interruption of ≥3 days. The median duration of the longest dose interruption ≥3 days was 
8.0 days (range, 3-41) in the brigatinib arm and 11.5 days (range, 3-32) in the crizotinib arm. 
TEAEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  occurred  in  similar  proportions  in  the  brigatinib  and 
crizotinib arms (11.8% vs 8.8%, respectively)

Early Onset Pulmonary Events and Later Onset Pneumonitis Events 
Events classified as EOPEs were all reported as ILD or pneumonitis in this study and occurred in 4 of 
the  136  patients  (2.9%)  in  the  brigatinib  arm  and  no  patients  in  the  crizotinib  arm.  Two  patients 
experienced pneumonitis, and 2 patients experienced ILD. The onset of these events ranged from Day 
3  to  Day  8.  All  4  patients  discontinued  brigatinib  because  of  the  early  onset  ILD/pneumonitis.  All 
events resolved or had improved in severity at the time of the last report. 
One of the 136 patients (0.7%) in the brigatinib arm and 3 of the 137 patients (2.2%) in the crizotinib 
arm  had  later-onset  pneumonitis.  The  event  in  the  brigatinib  arm  was  Grade  1  and  resolved  after 
treatment  interruption  and  dose  reduction.  The  patient  subsequently  experienced  a  second  event  of 
Grade  1  pneumonitis  and  brigatinib  was  discontinued.  In  the  crizotinib  arm,  the  later-onset 
pneumonitis  events  included  1  Grade  4  event.  One  patient  discontinued  crizotinib  because  of 
pneumonitis,  and  1  patient  had  study  drug  interrupted  because  of  the  event;  the  third  patient  had 
discontinued crizotinib 2 days before the onset of pneumonitis. All events in the crizotinib arm resolved 
or had improved in severity at the time of the data cutoff. 
One of the 35 patients in the crizotinib arm who crossed over to brigatinib after PD experienced Grade 
3 pneumonitis on Day 3 of crossover to brigatinib. Notably, this patient had ground glass opacities on 
chest computed tomography before starting brigatinib. Brigatinib was discontinued, and the event was 
ongoing at the time of the last report. 
Overall, 3.7% of patients in the brigatinib arm and 2.2% of patients in the crizotinib arm had an event 
of ILD/pneumonitis. 
• 
Other events 
Other  events  that  occurred  more  frequently  with  brigatinib  than  crizotinib  included  CPK  elevation, 
hypertension,  pancreatic  enzyme  elevation,  and  pruritus/rash.  Eye  disorder  AEs  (including  visual 
impairment),  oedema  peripheral,  GI  toxicity  (including  diarrhoea,  nausea,  vomiting,  constipation, 
decreased  appetite,  dyspepsia,  dysgeusia,  and  abdominal  pain  upper),  and  ALT  increased  were  seen 
more frequently with crizotinib than with brigatinib. 
2.3.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Study 201 only included patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC who had received prior crizotinib; 110 
patients received at least one dose of the proposed dose of 90/180 mg QD and 109 patients received 
at least one dose of 90 mg QD. Therefore, study 201 provides the primary basis for the safety 
evaluation in ALK+ NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib. Study 101 included 28 patients with 
ALK+ NSCLC treated at the proposed dose. New safety data from the ongoing phase III study (301) 
was also submitted. Baseline data showed that the study population was older (median 59 years vs 54 
years); ECOG status were slightly better (44% at 0 vs 36% at 0); a lower proportion have CNS 
metastases (29% vs 69%); and a lower proportion had prior chemotherapy (26.5% vs 73.9%). Other 
baseline characteristics were similar to study 201. 
A study population of 138 patients from phase 2 and 136 patients from phase 3 with ALK+ NSCLC 
have been exposed to brigatinib at the proposed dose of 90 mg QD for 7 days, then 180 mg QD. Of 
Assessment Report - Alunbrig 
EMA/696925/2018

these, only the phase II patients have been exposed to prior crizotinib and therefore reflect the target 
population. The median duration of follow-up in study 201 is 17.9 months. These updated data from 
the 201 study showed that the median duration of exposure was 402.0 days (13.2 months) in the 90 
mg group and 522.0 days (17.2 months) in the 90/180 mg group. At the time of the latest data 
extraction, 26.6% (59/222) of patients were ongoing. In the 301 study, the median duration of 
exposure with brigatinib was 9.22 months (range 0.1-18.4 months), with 105 patients being exposed 
for more than 6 months. 
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 25%) reported in patients treated with Alunbrig at the 
recommended dosing regimen were increased AST, hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, anaemia, 
increased CPK, nausea, increased lipase, decreased lymphocyte count, increased ALT, diarrhoea, 
increased amylase, fatigue, cough, headache, increased alkaline phosphatase, hypophosphataemia, 
increased APTT, rash, vomiting, dyspnoea, hypertension, decreased white blood cell count, myalgia, 
and peripheral neuropathy. 
The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2%) reported in patients treated with Alunbrig at the 
recommended dosing regimen other than events related to neoplasm progression were pneumonitis, 
pneumonia, and dyspnoea.  
Clinical toxicities shared with other ALK inhibitors include pneumonitis (later onset), CPK elevations, 
gastrointestinal toxicity, neuropathy, pancreatitis, fatigue, bradycardia, rash, visual disturbances and 
hepatic effects. Hypertension is not reported for other ALK inhibitors, but appears to be an ADR for 
brigatinib based on the observed dose response.  
In study 201, excluding patients with lung cancer-related reasons for death, there were 12 patient 
deaths within 30 days of the last dose. In study 101, excluding patients with lung cancer-related 
reasons for death, there were 10 patient deaths within 30 days of the last dose. Due to the nature of 
the underlying disease, it is challenging to assign causality for respiratory deaths. However, it appears 
that brigatinib-related early onset pulmonary events (EOPEs) may have contributed to the deaths of 4 
patients, of which the 3 patients from study 101 were on doses ≥ 180 mg QD at the onset of the event 
(further discussed below).   
There were 9 deaths in the pooled clinical trial database during survival follow-up for which the reason 
is unknown. The Applicant has reported that all deaths occurred > 30 days after last dose of brigatinib 
and therefore the issue will not be pursued any further.  
Severe, life-threatening, and fatal pulmonary adverse reactions, including those with features 
consistent with ILD/pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with Alunbrig (see section 4.8).  
Most pulmonary adverse reactions were observed within the first 7 days of treatment. Grade 1-2 
pulmonary adverse reactions resolved with interruption of treatment or dose modification. Increased 
age and shorter interval (less than 7 days) between the last dose of crizotinib and the first dose of 
Alunbrig were independently associated with an increased rate of these pulmonary adverse reactions. 
These factors should be considered when initiating treatment with Alunbrig. Patients with a history of 
ILD or drug-induced pneumonitis were excluded from the pivotal trial.  
Some patients experienced pneumonitis later in treatment with Alunbrig. Patients should be monitored 
for new or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnoea, cough, etc.), particularly in the first week 
of treatment. Evidence of pneumonitis in any patient with worsening respiratory symptoms should be 
promptly investigated. If pneumonitis is suspected, the dose of Alunbrig should be withheld, and the 
patient evaluated for other causes of symptoms (e.g., pulmonary embolism, tumour progression, and 
infectious pneumonia). The dose should be modified accordingly (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC).

The Applicant reviewed cases of pulmonary AEs for evidence of brigatinib-related EOPEs or later onset 
pneumonitis events. There were 14 cases of at least possible EOPE (6.4%) in study 201, all on the 90 
mg QD dose. One event was fatal. In study 102, 11 cases (8.0%) were identified, all but one at 
starting doses > 90 mg QD. There were 4 fatal cases after clarification from the Applicant. The 
identified cases were characterised by a pneumonitis-like process during the first week of treatment 
which in most cases responded to dose interruption and steroids. Two thirds of the cases were severe 
and over half of cases required discontinuation. Five events (2.3%) of later onset pneumonitis were 
identified in study 201. There were 2.9% (4/136) brigatinib patients in the 301 study with early onset 
ILD/pneumonitis, of which 3 cases were severe. It is considered reassuring that the rate of EOPE 
continues to be low and that all events had resolved or improved at the time of submission, and no 
deaths from EOPE have so far been observed in the phase 3 trial. This is probably due to increased 
attention and better handling of these early-onset serious events and may reflect the future risk of 
EOPE better than the phase 1 and 2 results. In fact, 3 patients died from EOPE in phase 1, 1 patient 
died in phase 2, and so far no patients have died from this in phase 3, demonstrating a learning curve 
of better handling and consequential diminished seriousness of this potentially fatal adverse event over 
time. The rate of later-onset pneumonitis was 0.7% for brigatinib vs 2.2% for crizotinib.  The Applicant 
has not yet any more knowledge about the pathogenesis/etiology, but are endorsing an investigator-
initiated study, where it will be explored whether peak reduction in DLCO may be a biomarker for EOPE 
as well as other relevant secondary endpoints such as systemic inflammatory signatures, immunologic 
phenotype (e.g. HLA-phenotype), clinical, demographic, and molecular characteristics. EOPE is an 
important safety issue with brigatinib, and it is noted that patients have died following this event. 
Therefore, the applicant has agreed to put in place a patient alert card in order to minimise the risk of 
EOPE and initiate a PASS to further investigate the risk of EOPE and to measure the effectiveness of 
the patient alert card. In addition, pneumonitis is a known adverse drug reaction to TKI’s in this class. 
Elevations of hepatic enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) and bilirubin 
have occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig (see section 4.8). Liver function, including AST, ALT 
and total bilirubin should be assessed prior to the initiation of Alunbrig and then every 2 weeks during 
the first 3 months of treatment. Thereafter, monitoring should be performed periodically. Based on the 
severity of the laboratory abnormalities, treatment should be withheld, and the dose modified 
accordingly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Elevations of CPK have occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig. Patients should be advised to report 
any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. CPK levels should be monitored regularly 
during Alunbrig treatment. Based on the severity of the CPK elevation, treatment with Alunbrig should 
be withheld, and the dose modified accordingly (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Elevations of amylase and lipase have occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig. Lipase and amylase 
should be monitored regularly during treatment with Alunbrig. Based on the severity of the laboratory 
abnormalities, treatment with Alunbrig should be withheld, and the dose modified accordingly (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Peripheral neuropathy has occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig. Peripheral neuropathy can cause 
functional impairment and affect quality of life. Peripheral neuropathy is listed as a very common ADR 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Hypertension has occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig. Blood pressure should be monitored 
regularly during treatment with Alunbrig. Hypertension should be treated according to standard 
guidelines to control blood pressure. Heart rate should be monitored more frequently in patients if 
concomitant use of a medicinal product known to cause bradycardia cannot be avoided. For severe 
hypertension (≥ Grade 3), Alunbrig should be withheld until hypertension has recovered to Grade 1 or 
to baseline. The dose should be modified accordingly (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Assessment Report - Alunbrig 
EMA/696925/2018

Bradycardia has occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig. Caution should be exercised when 
administering Alunbrig in combination with other agents known to cause bradycardia. Heart rate and 
blood pressure should be monitored regularly. If symptomatic bradycardia occurs, treatment with 
Alunbrig should be withheld and concomitant medicinal products known to cause bradycardia should be 
evaluated. Upon recovery, the dose should be modified accordingly. In case of life-threatening 
bradycardia, if no contributing concomitant medication is identified or in case of recurrence, treatment 
with Alunbrig should be discontinued (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Visual disturbance adverse reactions have occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig. Patients should 
be advised to report any visual symptoms. For new or worsening severe visual symptoms, an 
ophthalmologic evaluation and dose reduction should be considered (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of 
the SmPC). Retinal degeneration was included as an important potential risk in the RMP (see section 
2.4). 
In  study  201,  69%  of  patients  experienced  hyperglycaemia.  No  patients  had  dose  reductions  due  to 
hyperglycaemia. Grade 3 hyperglycemia occurred in 7.3% of patients. Fasting serum glucose should be 
assessed  prior  to  initiation  of  brigatinib  and  monitored  periodically  thereafter.  Antihyperglycaemic 
treatment  should  be  initiated  or  optimised  as  needed.  If  adequate  hyperglycaemic  control  cannot  be 
achieved  with  optimal  medical  management,  brigatinib  should  be  withheld  until  adequate 
hyperglycaemic control is achieved; upon recovery reducing the dose may be considered or brigatinib 
may be permanently discontinued (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Dose interruptions, reductions and discontinuations due  to  AEs  were  reported in  54.5%, 29.1% 
and 7.3% of the 90/180 mg group, respectively. The proportions were reduced for the 90 mg group. 
The  PTs  most  commonly  involved  were  pneumonitis,  pneumonia  and  blood  CPK  increased.  Dose 
reductions and discontinuations of brigatinib in the 301 study were 28.7% and 11.8%, respectively. 
Study AP26113-13-301 (301) is an ongoing, phase 3, randomized, multicentre study to evaluate the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  brigatinib  in  patients  with  advanced  ALK+  NSCLC  who  have  not  previously 
received ALK-directed therapy. As mentioned, the exposure is considered short in the phase 3 study, 
and this may cause an overly optimistic assessment of the safety profile of brigatinib. However, more 
than grade 3 TEAEs of any causality were greater with brigatinib (61.0% vs 55.5%) and some of the 
most  important  adverse  events  occur  early  on,  such  as  early-onset  pneumonitis  (EOPE).  A  lower 
fraction  had  SAEs  with  brigatinib  (25%  vs  32.8%), but  there  were  a  greater need  for  dose  reduction 
(28.7%  vs  21.2%)  and  study  drug  discontinuation  (11.8%  vs  8.8%)  with  brigatinib  treatment.  It  is 
also noted that significantly more patients had CPK increase (39% vs 15.3%), hypertension (22.8% vs 
7.3%),  and  amylase  increased  (14  vs  6.6%)  with  brigatinib.  Conversely,  more  patients  had  nausea 
(56.2%  vs  26.5%)  and  other  GI  related  symptoms  such  as  constipation,  vomiting,  and  decreased 
appetite with crizotinib. Hence, brigatinib is associated with reduced GI toxicity and peripheral oedema 
compared  to  crizotinib.  However,  brigatinib  is  particularly  associated  with  hypertension,  as  well  as 
creatine  phosphokinase,  lipase  and  amylase  elevations,  confirming  these  as  ADRs.  The  incidences  of 
AEs  by  PT  were  consistent  with  the  31  May  2016  cut-off  of  study  201,  when  brigatinib  median 
exposure was 10.6 months (similar exposure to current study 301 data). 
SAEs leading to death were rarely occurring in more than 2% of the patients in each arm and the data 
are apparently consistent with the phase 2 safety data, although the incidence was lower compared to 
study  201,  as  might  be expected  for  an  earlier  line  setting.  Additionally,  most  of  the  serious  adverse 
events  are  deemed  complications  to  the  underlying  cancer  disease  and  not  to  the  given  treatments.  
No new signals were apparent on review of deaths, SAEs and discontinuations due to AE.  
Women of childbearing age being treated with Alunbrig should be advised not to become pregnant and 
men  being treated  with  Alunbrig  should  be  advised not  to  father  a  child during  treatment.  Women  of 
reproductive potential should be advised to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment

with  Alunbrig  and  for  at  least  4 months  following  the  final  dose.  Men  with  female  partners  of 
reproductive  potential  should  be  advised  to  use  effective  contraception  during  treatment  and  for  at 
least 3 months after the last dose of Alunbrig. 
Alunbrig  may  cause  foetal  harm  when  administered  to  a  pregnant  woman.  Studies  in  animals  have 
shown  reproductive  toxicity  (see  section 5.3).  There  are  no  clinical  data  on  the  use  of  Alunbrig  in 
pregnant  women.  Alunbrig  should  not  be  used  during  pregnancy  unless  the  clinical  condition  of  the 
mother  requires  treatment.  If  Alunbrig  is  used  during  pregnancy,  or  if  the  patient  becomes  pregnant 
while taking this medicinal product, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a foetus. 
It  is  unknown  whether  Alunbrig  is  excreted  in  human  milk.  Available  data  cannot  exclude  potential 
excretion in human milk. Breast-feeding should be stopped during treatment with Alunbrig. 
No human data on the effect of Alunbrig on fertility are available. Based on repeat-dose toxicity studies 
in male animals, Alunbrig may cause reduced fertility in males (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance 
of these findings to human fertility is unknown (see also non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of brigatinib is as expected for ALK inhibitors with the exception of pulmonary 
adverse reactions. Brigatinib is frequently associated with gastrointestinal effects, cough, blood CPK 
increased, headache, fatigue, dyspnoea and hypertension. Most toxicities appear manageable, 
although gastrointestinal effects, fatigue and neuropathy are likely to affect quality of life. The 
discontinuation rate is only 6.4% and considered relatively low in this heavily pre-treated patient 
population.   
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
PAES: In order to further characterise the efficacy and safety of brigatinib in the treatment of patients 
with ALK-positive NSCLC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the phase III study 
AP26113-13-301 comparing brigatinib versus crizotinib in patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC who 
have not previously received ALK-directed therapy.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 5.0 is acceptable.  
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR

cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 28 April 2017. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.6.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of brigatinib with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers brigatinib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Alunbrig (brigatinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The  claimed  indication  is  as  monotherapy  for  adult  patients  with  anaplastic  lymphoma  kinase  (ALK)-
positive  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  who  were  previously 
treated with crizotinib.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
ALK  inhibitors  are  currently  the  main  treatment  options,  and  crizotinib  was  approved  for  first-line 
treatment  at  the  time  of  application.  Since  then,  alectinib  and  ceritinib  have  gained  approval  in  the 
first-line setting and in the second line post-crizotinib. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Data from two early studies are provided, a phase 1 study AP26113-11-101, the pivotal phase 2 study 
AP26113-13-201, supported by top-line results from the ongoing phase 3 study AP26113-13-301. The 
phase  1  and  2  studies  were  both  open-label  studies,  non-randomised,  single  arm  studies  with  no 
comparator as the phase 2 study randomised patients for two dosing regimens and was not designed 
for comparison regarding differences in efficacy.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The  90/180  mg  cohort  of  study  101  included  25  patients  with  ALK+  NSCLC  previously  treated  with 
crizotinib,  and  therefore  of  relevance  for  this  application.  In  this  group,  76.0%  (95%  CI:  54.9%, 
90.6%)  had  a  confirmed  objective  response.  The  KM  estimate  median  duration  of  response  for  the 
90/180  mg  dose  group  was  26.1  months  (95%  CI:  7.9,  26.1).  The  KM  estimate  of  median  PFS  for 
patients in the 90 mg/180 mg QD group was 16.3 months (95% CI: 9.2, not reached). Median overall 
survival (KM estimate) was not reached in this group. 
Of those with ALK+ NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib in the 90/180 mg QD group of study 101, 
there  were  18  evaluable  patients  with  brain  metastases  at  baseline,  of  which  8  (44.4%;  95%  CI: 
21.5%,  69.2%)  had  a  confirmed  response  by  IRC.  The  KM  estimate  median  intracranial  duration  of 
response was 11.4 months (95% CI: 5.6, 11.4).  
In  study  201,  a  total  of  222  patients  were  randomised  to  brigatinib  90  mg  (n=112)  or  brigatinib 
90/180 mg (n=110). For the primary outcome of confirmed ORR by investigator assessment in the ITT 
population,  the  rate  was  55.5%  (97.5%  CI:  44.3,  66.2)  for  the  90/180  mg  group.  The  KM  estimate 
median investigator-assessed duration of response was 13.8 months (95% CI: 10.2, 17.5) for patients 
in 90/180 mg group. The KM estimate median PFS was 15.6 months (95% CI: 11.1, 19.4) for the 90 
mg/180 mg group. The median OS was 27.6 months (95% CI: 27.6; not reached) in the 90/180 mg 
group.  
Brigatinib  showed  promising  efficacy  in  the  CNS,  especially  regarding  the  intracranial  PFS  of  18.4 
months  for  patients  with  any  brain  metastases  at  baseline  (n=73,  measurable  and  non-measurable 
only).  In  patients  with  measurable  brain  metastases  at  baseline,  the  intracranial  ORR  by  IRC  was 
66.7% i.e. 12/18 patients (95% CI: 41.0, 86.7) at the 90/180 mg dose level. The median duration of 
intracranial  response  was  16.6  months,  and  over  half  of  responders  maintained  response  for  at  least 
12 months. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although study 201 was randomised, the design was open-label and no placebo or active comparator 
arm  has  been  included.  Thus,  the  effect  on  time-related  endpoints  like  OS  and  PFS  is  unknown.    In 
order  to  further  confirm  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  brigatinib  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  ALK-
positive  NSCLC,  the  MAH  should  submit  the  clinical  study  report  of  the  phase  III  study  AP26113-13-
301  comparing  brigatinib  versus  crizotinib  in  patients  with  advanced  ALK+  NSCLC  who  have  not 
previously received ALK-directed therapy.  
The  study  population  was  not  a  reflection  of  the  patient  population  regarding  performance  status,  as 
only a few patients (8.2% in the high dose group) were PS 2 and the rest PS 0-1, and this may lead to 
selection bias. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  most  common  adverse  reactions  (≥ 25%)  reported  in  patients  treated  with  Alunbrig  at  the 
recommended  dosing  regimen  were  increased  AST,  hyperglycaemia,  hyperinsulinaemia,  anaemia, 
increased  CPK,  nausea,  increased  lipase,  decreased  lymphocyte  count,  increased  ALT,  diarrhoea, 
increased  amylase,  fatigue,  cough,  headache,  increased  alkaline  phosphatase,  hypophosphataemia, 
increased  APTT,  rash,  vomiting,  dyspnoea,  hypertension,  decreased  white  blood  cell  count,  myalgia, 
and peripheral neuropathy. 
Assessment Report - Alunbrig 
EMA/696925/2018  
Page 127/132 
 
 
 
The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2%) reported in patients treated with Alunbrig at the 
recommended  dosing  regimen  other  than  events  related  to  neoplasm  progression  were  pneumonitis, 
pneumonia, and dyspnoea.  
Clinical  toxicities  shared  with  other  ALK  inhibitors  include  pneumonitis  (later  onset),  CPK  elevations, 
gastrointestinal  toxicity,  neuropathy,  pancreatitis,  fatigue,  bradycardia,  rash,  visual  disturbances  and 
hepatic  effects.  Hypertension  is  not  reported  for  other  ALK  inhibitors,  but  appears  to  be  an  adverse 
drug reaction (ADR) for brigatinib based on the observed dose response. 
Brigatinib  is  associated  with  early  onset  pulmonary  events  (EOPEs),  characterised  by  a  pneumonitis-
like  process  during  the  first  week  of  treatment.  There  were  14  cases  of  definite  or  possible  EOPEs 
(6.4%)  in  study  201,  all  on  the  90  mg  QD  dose  at  the  time  of  onset.  One  event  was  fatal.  In  study 
102,  11  cases  (8.0%)  were  identified,  all  but  one  at  starting  doses  >  90  mg  QD.  There  were  4  fatal 
cases. Two thirds of the EOPE cases were severe and over half of cases required discontinuation. Five 
events (2.3%) of later onset pneumonitis were identified in study 201.   
Peripheral  neuropathy  was  reported  by  28%  of  patients  treated  with  90/180  mg  regimen  in  studies 
101 and 201. In patients who reported peripheral neuropathy AEs (Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy and 
Paraesthesia) in the 90/180 mg group of study 201, the event lasted more than 6 months in half of the 
cases. In more than half of patients, there was no resolution of any peripheral neuropathy events. 
During the procedure, the Applicant submitted safety data from the ongoing 301 study, and the results 
did  not  alter  the  safety  profile  of  brigatinib.  Especially,  no  new  fatal  cases  of  EOPE  were  observed, 
indicating that this event may be more manageable than anticipated. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
It is still not known whether any biomarkers such as HLA allelic variants are associated with brigatinib-
related  EOPEs.  However,  the  Applicant  are  endorsing  an  investigator-initiated  study,  where  it  will  be 
explored  whether  peak  reduction  in  DLCO  may  be  a  biomarker  for  EOPE  as  well  as  other  relevant 
secondary  endpoints  such  as  systemic  inflammatory  signatures,  immunologic  phenotype  (e.g.  HLA-
phenotype), clinical, demographic, and molecular characteristics. In addition, the Applicant has agreed 
to put in place a patient alert card in order to minimise the risk of EOPE and initiate a PASS to further 
investigate the risk of EOPE and to measure the effectiveness of the patient alert card.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The ORR and the KM duration of response support the efficacy of Brigatinib in ALK+ NSCLC patients 
previously treated with crizotinib. Updated phase 2 results are consistent with previously submitted 
data both regarding safety and efficacy and the submitted phase 3 top-line results further support the 
efficacy of brigatinib.  
An effect on brain metastases is particularly relevant in this patient population as half of them have 
brain metastases at progression.

The unfavourable effect of most concern is a 6% incidence of early onset pulmonary events 
characterised by a pneumonitis-like process during the first week of treatment. Two thirds of the cases 
were severe and over half of cases required discontinuation. Four fatal cases were reported, 3 patients 
in phase 1 and 1 patient in phase 2. An incidence of EOPE of 2.9% was reported in the 301 study, 
however, all events had resolved or improved at the time of submission, and so no deaths from EOPE 
have so far been observed in the phase 3 trial. This is probably due to increased attention to these 
early onset serious events and may reflect the future risk of EOPE. This effect appears to be unique to 
brigatinib, among ALK inhibitors, but with appropriate precautions, it should be acceptable in this 
palliative treatment setting. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity appears to be manageable, with a low frequency of severe events, however, 
even low grade events may affect quality of life. Other common toxicities that are likely to affect 
quality of life include fatigue and peripheral neuropathy. The 10% discontinuation rate mainly reflected 
pulmonary AEs, suggesting that overall, the other toxicities were manageable, having in mind that the 
study population was heavily pre-treated, with a less than optimal performance status. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit of brigatinib following failure on crizotinib is considered clinically relevant. Additionally, the 
safety profile of brigatinib is acceptable. Therefore, the benefit risk balance is positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Alunbrig is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Alunbrig is favourable in the following indication: 
Alunbrig is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with crizotinib.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

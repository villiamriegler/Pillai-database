Introduction 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
The pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterised by deficient insulin activity 
arising from decreased insulin secretion secondary to beta cell failure, and/or compromised insulin 
action in peripheral target tissues (insulin resistance). This abnormal metabolic state is exacerbated by 
excess hepatic glucose production and altered metabolism of proteins and lipids, which along with 
hyperglycaemia, contribute to microvascular and macrovascular complications.  
T2DM accounts for approximately 85% to 95% of diabetes cases in developed regions like the 
European Union.   Age and weight are established risk factors for T2DM. The majority of patients 
with T2DM are overweight or obese. Diet modification and exercise is the first line of treatment for 
T2DM.   Pharmacologic intervention with one oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) is usually the next step in 
treatment.  After 3 to 9 years of OAD monotherapy, patients typically require an additional 
intervention.   The recommended first line treatment is metformin, which restrains hepatic glucose 
production and decreases peripheral insulin resistance.  Sulphonylureas, which are insulin 
secretagogues, may be used as an alternative to patients intolerant to metformin, or as an addition to 
metformin.  Other second line oral treatment alternatives include alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, 
meglitinides and thiazolidinediones. Although being efficient in attenuating hyperglycaemia, all of 
these treatment alternatives have more or less serious side effects and there is a need for development 
of efficient drugs without metabolic or other side effects. 
Vildagliptin belongs to a new class of oral anti-diabetic drugs and is a selective and reversible 
inhibitor of Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), the enzyme which inactivates the incretin hormones, 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), hormones 
which significantly contribute to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.  
The therapeutic indication granted is: Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as dual oral therapy in 
combination with 
•  metformin, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of 
• 
• 
monotherapy with metformin, 
a sulphonylurea, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose 
of a sulphonylurea and for whom metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or 
intolerance, 
a thiazolidinedione, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control and for whom the use of a 
thiazolidinedione is appropriate. 
The recommended dose is 100 mg daily administered either once daily or divided into two doses of 50 
mg given in the morning and evening, except for the combined use with a sulphonylurea, where the 
recommended dose is 50 mg given in the morning.

Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Galvus  an  immediate  release  dosage  form  is  presented  as  tablets  containing  50  mg  and  100  mg  of 
vildagliptin  as  active  substance.  The  other  ingredients  are  microcrystalline  cellulose,  lactose 
anhydrous, sodium starch glycolate and magnesium stearate.  
The film-coated tablets are marketed in aluminium/aluminium (PA/Al/PVC//Al) blisters. 
Active Substance  
The active substance is vildagliptin. Its chemical name is (S)-1-[2-(3-Hydroxyadamantan-1-ylamino) 
acetyl]pyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile according to the IUPAC nomenclature. 
Vildagliptin is a white to slightly yellowish or slightly greyish crystalline powder and no polymorphs 
or solvates have been identified so far. Vildagliptin is non-hygroscopic and freely soluble in water and

polar organic solvents. The above-mentioned active substance has one chiral centre and is used as a 
single enantiomer (S).  
•  Manufacture 
Vildagliptin  is  synthesised  in  two  reactions  steps  followed  by  purification  (recrystallisation).  The 
manufacturing process for vildagliptin has been adequately described. Critical parameters have been 
identified  and  adequate  in-process  controls  included.  Specifications  for  starting  materials,  reagents, 
and  solvents  have  been  provided.  Adequate  control  of  critical  steps  and  intermediates  has  been 
presented.  
Structure  elucidation  has  been  performed  by  elemental  analysis,  ultraviolet  spectroscopy,  infrared 
absorption spectroscopy, 1H-NMR spectroscopy, 13C-NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy. The 
molecular  weight  was  determined  by  elemental  analysis  which  is  in  agreement  with  the  expected 
molecular weight.   The proposed molecular structure was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction and 
X-ray single crystal structural analysis. 
•  Specification 
The  vildagliptin  specifications  include  tests  for  appearance  (slightly  yellowish  or  slightly  greyish 
powder),  particle  size  (by  laser  light  diffraction),  identification  (by  IR-KBr,  IR-ATR  and  X-ray 
diffraction),  Related  substances  (HPLC  and  IC),  R-enantiomer  of  vildagliptin  (HPLC),  residual 
solvents (Head-space GC), loss on drying (thermogravimetry), sulphated ash, heavy metals, clarity of 
solution, colour of solution, assay (by HPLC) and microbiological limit tests. 
It was verified that all specifications reflect the relevant quality attributes of the active substance. The 
analytical methods, which were used in the routine controls, were well described and their validations 
are in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines.   
Impurities were described, classified as process related impurities and possible degradation products, 
and qualified. Residual solvents were satisfactorily controlled in the active substance according to the 
relevant  ICH  requirements.  Certificates  of  analyses  for  the  active  substances  were  provided  and  all 
batch analysis results comply with the specifications and show a good uniformity from batch to batch.  
•  Stability 
The stability results from long-term accelerated and stress studies were completed according to ICH 
guidelines demonstrated adequate stability of the active substance. The active substance is not 
susceptible to degradation under the influence of light and temperature exposure. The results of the 
long-term and accelerated studies fulfil the proposed specification and for that reason support the 
proposed retest period.  
Medicinal Product 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
All  information  regarding  the  choice  of  the  active  substance  and  the  excipients  are  sufficiently 
justified.  
Galvus tablets were developed five tablet strengths which were used in clinical trials. However, only 
two tablet strengths (50 mg and 100 mg) will be marketed. 
The main aim of the applicant was to develop robust final formulation that would be suitable for 
routine manufacturing at the production scale for that reason different formulation containing different 
excipients were investigated and optimised.  
Having investigated different formulations the applicant selected for commercialisation a direct 
compression tablet formulation. 
Lactose monohydrate is manufactured from bovine milk. The supplier confirms that the milk used in 
the manufacture of the lactose is sourced from healthy animals under the same conditions as for 
human consumption.

•  Manufacture of the Product 
The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  involves  standard  technology  using  standard 
manufacturing processes such as mixing, blending and compressing. 
Furthermore,  the  equipment  used  is  commonly  available  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry.  It  was 
demonstrated that there are no critical steps in the manufacturing process. 
The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly 
according the agreed finished product specifications. 
•  Product Specification 
The  finished  product  specifications  were  established  according  the  ICH  guidelines  and  include  the 
following  tests:  appearance,  identification  (TLC  and  HPLC),  mean  mass,  dissolution,  water  (Karl 
Fischer),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  by  mass  variation  (Ph  Eur),  or,  
alternatively, uniformity of dosage units by content uniformity (Ph Eur), assay (HPLC) and microbial 
limits (Ph Eur). 
All  analytical  procedures  that  were  used  for  testing  the  drug  product  were  properly  described. 
Moreover,  all  relevant  methods  were  satisfactorily  validated  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ICH 
guidelines.  
Batch analysis data on three stability batches and three production scale batches (validation batches) 
confirm satisfactory uniformity of the product at release. 
•  Stability of the Product 
The stability studies were conducted according to the relevant ICH guidelines. Three full production 
scale batches of each strength, as well as a supportive production batch of 100 mg have been stored at 
long term and accelerated conditions in the proposed market packaging.  
One production batch per strength was stored under elevated temperature conditions for 3 months and 
at ICH conditions, and under low temperature conditions for 6 months and for photostability at ICH 
conditions. 
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the 
SPC are acceptable. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture,  control  of  the  active  substance  and  the  finished  product 
have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant CHMP and ICH 
guidelines.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  the 
finished  product.  Therefore,  this  medicinal  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform 
performance in the clinic.

Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
All pivotal toxicology and safety studies were performed in accordance with GLP regulations.

Pharmacology 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
In vitro studies 
The non-clinical pharmacology program has demonstrated that vildagliptin is a selective and potent 
inhibitor of DPP-4. The IC50 value for inhibition of human DPP-4 is about 3 nM and similar activity 
was observed with the rat enzyme, demonstrating the lack of species selectivity. Vildagliptin showed 
some activity at the related enzymes DPP-8 and DPP-9 (Ki values of 506 nM and 65 nM, 
respectively). Although these values are 253 and 32 times higher than the Ki for DPP-4, activity at 
Cmax in humans (2.3 μM) is likely. No assays exist allowing evaluation of DPP-8/DPP-9 inhibition in 
vivo. The possibility of activity at one or both of these targets is considered a safety concern in 
relation to the occurrence of skin lesions in monkeys (see below). No, or minimal, inhibition was seen 
with other related enzymes. 
In vivo studies 
In vivo pharmacodynamic studies were performed in rats and monkeys. These studies demonstrated 
the in vivo inhibition of DPP-4 and increased plasma levels of GLP-1. Studies in diabetic rats and in 
insulin-resistant monkeys demonstrated a glucose-lowering effect of vildagliptin.   Chronic effects of 
vildagliptin were studied in pre-diabetic and insulin-treated diabetic monkeys. Beneficial effects were 
observed on HbA1c, fasting insulin, fibrinogen and PAI-1. 
Vildagliptin increased β-cell mass in neonatal rats, and improved β-cell function in streptozotocin-
induced diabetic mice. These data could suggest that vildagliptin has the potential to mitigate the 
progressive loss of islet function in type 2 diabetes patients. 
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Vildagliptin showed no significant effect on gastric emptying in monkeys. This is in contrast to what 
has been observed with exogenously-administered GLP-1 and GLP-1 analogues. 
As discussed above, activity at the related enzymes DPP-8 and/or DPP-9 can not be excluded at 
clinical exposures. Concerns related to secondary pharmacology can also arise from the importance of 
DPP-4 in enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions other than inhibiting the inactivation of GLP-1 and 
GIP. 
DPP-4 (CD26) is present as a cell surface molecule on immune cells and has been characterised as an 
important costimulatory molecule in immune activation. Although some studies applying DPP-4   
inhibitors have suggested a role for the enzyme activity for the immune function, other studies have 
suggested costimulation to be unrelated to the enzyme activity. The studies performed with 
vildagliptin and discussed in the dossier support the view that the immune function of CD26 is 
independent of its enzyme activity. 
There are no indications for safety issues related to other DPP-4 substrates than GLP-1 and GIP.  
Potential effects on the immune system, resulting in an increased risk for infections and on substance 
P and neurokinin resulting in an increased risk of angioedema are discussed in the Risk Management 
Plan. No increased risk has been observed during clinical development for any of these adverse events. 
•  Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies have been conducted to evaluate neuropharmacological, respiratory and 
cardiovascular effects of vildagliptin in animals.  
Cardiovascular changes were observed in dogs at high doses, occasionally resulting in mortality. 
Possible mechanisms were examined in an extensive battery of in vitro and in vivo studies of 
cardiovascular parameters. These effects are possibly related to inhibition of SCN5A sodium channels 
4/34 
© EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which was observed in in vitro studies. Based on dog exposure data (Cmax > 7-fold higher at NOAEL 
than seen at maximum dose in humans) and the in vitro IC50 for sodium channels (365 μM versus 
clinical Cmax of 2 μM), a clinical effect is unlikely. However, conduction disturbances were further 
investigated in humans. 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The effects of combinations of vildagliptin with the rapid-onset insulinotropic agent, nateglinide 
(Starlix) and with the insulin sensitizer, pioglitazone (Actos) were assessed in Zucker fatty rats and 
resulted in an additive or more than additive effect on several plasma glucose-related parameters. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Vildagliptin was rapidly absorbed with a high bioavailability in all species. There were no important 
differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between the tested animal species and humans. 
Vildagliptin showed low binding to plasma proteins in all species (<10%).  In a whole body 
autoradiography study in rats, vildagliptin-related radioactivity was widely distributed to most tissues. 
Drug-related radioactivity was bound to melanin. There was a low passage for drug-related 
radioactivity across the blood-brain barrier. No radioactivity was detected in any tissue at 48 h post-
dose. Studies in pregnant rats and rabbits demonstrated placental transfer of vildagliptin. 
The parent compound was one of the major circulating components in all species and all metabolites 
observed in humans were also found in the animal species. Hydrolysis was the main mechanism of 
vildagliptin metabolism in all species and exposure to the major metabolites was broadly similar in the 
rat, dog and human. In humans, the predominant metabolic pathway was hydrolysis at the cyano 
moiety to form a carboxylic acid metabolite (M20.7/LAY151), accounting for approximately 55% of 
circulating drug-related material following an oral dose. M20.7 was the main metabolite both in the rat 
(54%) and the dog (33%). In the rabbit, another hydrolysis product M15.3 was the main metabolite 
(53%). 
Vildagliptin is produced as a pure S-enantiomer. A clinical study showed that chiral conversion in vivo 
is unlikely. 
Urinary excretion was the main route in all species except the rat, where equal amounts were excreted 
with urine and feces. Milk transfer of vildaglitin and metabolites were demonstrated in the rat, which 
is therefore mentioned in the SPC section 4.6, with a milk/plasma ratio for total radioactivity of 4. 
In vitro studies demonstrated that vildagliptin is unlikely to exhibit a potential for pharmacokinetic 
drug interactions. Vildagliptin did not inhibit Pgp or any of a series of CYP enzymes. There was no 
evidence for enzyme induction. 
Toxicology 
•  Single dose toxicity 
Vildagliptin exhibits low acute toxicity. In mice and rats no toxicological signs were observed after a 
single oral dose of 2000 mg/kg. 
•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
Repeat dose toxicity studies were performed in rats (up to 26 weeks) and dogs (up to 52 weeks). These 
models are considered relevant, based on the lack of species specificity for the pharmacological 
activity of vildagliptin, and the similarities in metabolism to humans.  
The main toxicological effect noted in rats was the accumulation of clusters of foamy alveolar 
macrophages in the lung. Similar observations were made in mice. This finding was proposed to be 
5/34 
© EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
due to an exaggerated pharmacological effect of DPP-4 inhibition in the rat. The clinical relevance of 
the lung findings in rats cannot be fully excluded. There is a considerable safety margin (5 x human 
AUC at NOAEL) and the findings are considered of limited importance.  
The most consistent toxicological finding in the dog was the appearance of gastrointestinal symptoms, 
particularly soft faeces, mucoid faeces, diarrhea and at higher doses, faecal blood. These signs were 
observed at relatively low systemic exposures (observed already at lowest dose representing 2 x 
human AUC). GI findings were not observed in any other species and according to the applicant no GI 
disorders have been observed in clinical trials. The CHMP was of the opinion, that these findings are 
unlikely to be of clinical importance. 
•  Genotoxicity 
The data from genotoxicity studies conducted with vildagliptin in several standard genotoxicity tests 
do not indicate a genotoxic potential. 
•  Carcinogenicity 
Life-time carcinogenicity studies were performed in mice and rats. No evidence for a carcinogenic 
potential was observed in the rat. An increased incidence of hemangiosarcomas was observed at the 
highest dose in female rats while in male rats, the incidence was slightly decreased. Given the mouse 
findings discussed below, a relation to treatment cannot be fully excluded. In the mouse there was an 
increased incidence of hemangiosarcomas and mammary carcinoma. The increased incidence of 
hemangiosarcoma in mice occurred only in organs where this tumour occurs as a relatively common 
spontaneous finding in the mouse (liver, spleen, uterus etc.). It is suggested that a predisposition to 
spontaneous hemangiosarcoma at the affected site is needed for vildagliptin to promote an increased 
incidence. A study in the mouse demonstrated that vildagliptin inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis. 
Based on these mechanistic data the applicant proposes a mechanism whereby inhibition of VEGF-
induced angiogenesis over a long period exerts selection pressure in favour of endothelium that 
proliferates independently of VEGF and hence increases the likelihood of endothelial neoplasia. There 
was a disproportionate increase in hemangiosarcoma involving the liver in treated male mice at ≥ 250 
mg/kg/day. At the same time there was a decreased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in male 
mice. The applicant hypothesizes that hemangiosarcomas may originate within early hepatocellular 
tumours or preneoplastic lesions followed by obliteration of the hepatocellular tumour and its 
replacement with the more aggressive hemangiosarcoma. There is a substantial safety margin 
(exposure margin at NOAEL = 16). It was considered that vildagliptin is likely to act by promoting 
development of a tumour form that appears commonly mice, and that the data do not suggest an 
increased risk for hemangiosarcoma development in humans where this tumour form is uncommon. 
The fact that the incidences of other common spontaneous tumours were not increased by vildagliptin 
treatment supports the view that a more general tumour promoting effect of vildaglitin is unlikely. The 
applicant will further study the mechanism for tumour development in the liver of mice, and the 
findings were considered by the CHMP not to represent a significant risk to humans. 
In the case of mammary adenocarcioma, the applicant suggested that tumours noted in the mouse 
carcinogenicity study are likely the result of an effect on the pituitary-gonadal axis that is unlikely to 
be of relevance to humans. In mammary tissue from mice treated with vildagliptin for 53 weeks there 
was a dramatic upregulation of genes related to milk production, such as casein-beta, casein-gamma 
and lactalbumin, suggesting that hormonally-driven changes are occurring in the mammary gland of 
mice treated with vildagliptin. The CHMP was of the opinion that these effects are unlikely to be of 
relevance to humans. 
•  Reproduction Toxicity 
Vildagliptin showed no effects on fertility, reproductive performance or early embryonic development 
in the rat. Embryo-foetal toxicity was evaluated in rats and rabbits. In the rat, an increased incidence of 
wavy ribs was observed at ≥ 225 mg/kg/day, in association with reduced maternal body weight 
parameters. Although classified as a malformation, literature data suggest that wavy ribs in the rat may 
6/34 
© EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
be reversible. In rabbits, decreased foetal weight and skeletal variations indicative of developmental 
delays were noted in rabbits at 150 mg/kg/day, in the presence of severe maternal toxicity (including 
mortality). It is concluded that vildagliptin is not selectively embryotoxic and does not exhibit a 
teratogenic potential. In the peri- and postnatal toxicity study in rats, maternal toxicity was observed at 
all doses. Transient decrease in F1 generation body weight and a decreased number of central beam 
breaks in open-field motor activity tests were observed at ≥ 150 mg/kg/day. 
•  Local tolerance  
Local tolerance of vildagliptin was investigated as part of the intravenous toxicity. No local effects due 
to vildagliptin were observed in either species. A skin irritation study conducted in rabbits did not 
indicate any dermal irritant properties.  
•  Other toxicity studies 
Vildagliptin showed no effect on the immune response in KLH-immunised rats. As discussed in the 
section on Pharmacology, the lack of immunotoxicity supports the view that the immune function of 
DPP-4/CD26 is independent of its enzymatic activity. 
No toxicity studies with metabolites were performed. The main human metabolites were present at 
similar amounts in the toxicology species. In patients with renal impairment, the exposure to the 
pharmacologically inactive metabolite LAY151 may be increased up to 6 times. There are no 
indications for any toxicity related to the metabolite and no further studies are warranted. 
Drug impurities requiring toxicological qualification were tested in repeat-dose toxicity and 
genotoxicity studies with a vildagliptin preparation spiked with the impurities at levels of 2-3%. There 
were no findings suggesting a change in toxicity profile. 
Available data indicate that the administration of DPP-4 inhibitors to monkeys results in dose and 
duration-dependent increases in necrotic lesions of the tail, digits, ears, nose and scrotum. The 
mechanism is unknown and such lesions have not been described in humans, rats or dogs. Data from 
the safety pharmacology study in monkeys suggest that vildagliptin may cause skin lesions in the 
monkey. A 13-week toxicology in cynomolgus monkeys shows occurrence of necrotic lesions with a 
lack of safety margin and lack of reversibility at higher doses. The skin lesions are proposed to result 
from peripheral vasoconstriction.The skin lesions were observed at doses that produced a tachycardic 
and a prohypertensive action indicating a sympathomimetic effect of vildagliptin at these doses in 
monkeys.The applicant argues that these findings were related to DPP4 inhibition, and that monkeys 
are much more sensitive to DPP4 inhibition than humans. The lack of skin lesions with sitagliptin in 
rhesus monkeys speaks against this proposal suggesting that other factors may be involved in causing 
the skin lesions result, such as inhibition of DPP8 and or DPP9, the occurance of which in vivo is not 
known. 
Based on mechanistic considerations, no firm conclusion on the relevance of the skin lesions in 
monkeys for clinical safety can be drawn at this time. The CHMP considered these findings acceptable 
for a market authorisation, considering the clinical safety documented so far, and appropriate means 
taken by the applicant to identify any signals in the post-marketing phase. Further studies on the 
mechanism of skin lesions in the monkeys will be performed as follow-up measures. In addition to 
describing the findings in SPC section 5.3, a warning is included in section 4.4 with a reference to 
section 5.3. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment does not indicate any important risk to the environment.

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Vildagliptin is a selective and reversible inhibitor of DPP-4, and thus belongs to a new class of oral 
anti-diabetic drugs. 
The applicant received repeated Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 21 November 2003, 24 June 
2004 and on 22 October 2004. The Scientific Advice focused on clinical aspects, including study 
design, documentation of cardiac safety, and discussion of study endpoints.  
During the clinical development program, there were 2 events of note:  
1. The 100 mg dose was initially discontinued by amendment in 2 phase II dose selection studies 
(because of cardiac findings in dogs at very high exposures, which were subsequently mitigated) and 
resumed in phase III studies. 
2. Unreliable HbA1c assessments in 6 key phase III studies and the 1 phase III dose regimen study 
required reanalysis in retention samples.  As some patients had no retention samples for re-analysis, 
and others did not reach the entry requirements for HbA1c upon re-analysis, replacement patients were 
recruited in each study prior to database lock and patients without reliable baseline values or required 
entry values were excluded from the full analysis in accordance with ICH guidance. 
The therapeutic indication for vildaglitpin claimed by the applicant was treatment of T2DM: 
•  As monotherapy, in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for whom metformin 
is inappropriate because of intolerance or contraindications, 
•  As dual oral therapy with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione, in patients with 
insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated doses of monotherapy with these 
agents, 
In combination with insulin. 
• 
During the evaluation of the MAA, the CHMP had concerns about the proposed monotherapy 
indication, as well as about the proposed use in combination with insulin. The applicant initially 
proposed a further restriction of the combination usage with insulin but finally withdrew this part of 
the indication. In addition, on 5 July 2007, the applicant also withdrew the part of the indication 
proposing vildagliptin as monotherapy in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for 
whom metformin is inappropriate because of intolerance or contraindications, thus addressing the 
remaining concerns by the CHMP. 
The therapeutic indication finally granted is therefore: treatment of T2DM, as dual oral therapy in 
combination  with 
•  metformin, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of 
• 
• 
monotherapy with metformin, 
a sulphonylurea, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose 
of a sulphonylurea and for whom metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or 
intolerance, 
a thiazolidinedione, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control and for whom the use of a 
thiazolidinedione is appropriate. 
The recommended dose is 100 mg daily administered either once daily or divided into two doses of 50 
mg given in the morning and evening, except for the combined use with a sulphonylurea, where the 
recommended dose is 50 mg given in the morning. 
No study in the paediatric population was performed and therefore the use in this population is not 
recommended. Experience in patients aged 75 years and older is limited and caution should be 
exercised with the use in this population.

GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 38 clinical pharmacology studies enrolling approximately 1014 subjects have been 
conducted with vildagliptin to evaluate PK, dose-response, PK/PD relationship, mode of action and 
potential for drug-drug interactions.  
Vildagliptin is analyzed in plasma and urine using a specific LC-MS method. The analytical methods 
are adequate for accurate determination of vildagliptin (LAF237) and its major inactive metabolite 
LAY151 in human biological fluids.  
•  Absorption  
Bioavailability: Vildagliptin is rapidly absorbed with a median tmax of about 1.5 hr after oral dosing 
and has a mean absolute oral bioavailability of 85%. An in vitro study with Caco-2 cell monolayer 
suggests that vildagliptin is a substrate of P-gp, with low affinity, however.  
The rate of absorption is reduced when vildagliptin final marketing tablets are taken with a high fat 
meal and there is also a slight reduction of extent of absorption as reflected by an increase in tmax from 
1.75 h under fasting conditions to 2.5 h after a high fat meal, a 19% decrease in Cmax and 10% decrease 
in AUC. These effects are not considered clinically relevant. Galvus can be taken with or without food 
(mentioned in the SPC, section 4.2). 
Bioequivalence: Formulations used in early studies included a solution and a pilot capsule 
formulation, respectively. Subsequent phase I and II clinical studies used a tablet formulation (market 
formulation, MF). The capsule was shown to be of similar bioavailability to the Phase 2 MF tablet. 
Subsequent pivotal Phase 3 studies employed the FMI (final marketing image) formulation, which was 
also used in subsequent PK, PK/PD and mechanistic studies. Bioequivalence has been shown between 
the Phase 2 MF tablet and the FMI tablet. 
The mean AUC in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus at the therapeutic dose (2160 ± 520 
ng·hr/mL, N=71) was comparable to healthy subjects (2275 ± 459 ng·hr/mL, N=150). 
•  Distribution 
The protein binding of vildagliptin to human plasma is low (9.3%). Vildagliptin distributes equally 
between plasma and red blood cells. The volume of distribution (Vss) is 70.7±16.1 L, indicating 
distribution to the extravascular tissue compartment. Drug-drug interactions linked to protein 
displacement are not expected. 
•  Elimination 
Vildagliptin is eliminated mainly by metabolism and subsequent urinary excretion of metabolites. 
After administration of 14C-vildagliptin 100 mg   oral solution 85.4±4.4% of the dose was excreted in 
urine and 14.8±3.5% in faeces. About 33% of dose was excreted in urine as unchanged vildagliptin 
after intravenous administration. Mean total plasma clearance (CL) determined after intravenous 
administration of 25 mg was 40.6±8.97 L/hr and renal clearance (CLR) 13.0±2.35 L/hr (> 216 ml/min). 
Hence, tubular secretion by active transport proteins is involved in vildagliptin elimination to some 
extent. The mean plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) of vildagliptin oral administration was about 2-3 h

The metabolism of vildagliptin has been well characterised. It is extensive since only 1/3 of the dose is 
recovered as unchanged drug. Compound M20.7 or LAY151 is the major and inactive metabolite with 
plasma exposure 3-fold that of vildagliptin. Glucuronidation is only a minor pathway accounting for 
less than 5% of the initial dose and oxidation accounts only for 1.6% of the dose. Multiple tissues can 
hydrolyse  vildagliptin  to  the  major  metabolite  LAY151.  CYP450  isoenzymes  are  involved  in 
vildagliptin metabolism only to a minor extent. Hence, the potential for interactions with vildagliptin 
metabolism  is  very  small.  Vildagliptin is  an  S-enantiomer.  Available  data  suggest  that  in  vivo  inter-
conversion to the D-enantiomer is unlikely. 
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose and time dependency 
The pharmacokinetic of vildagliptin is roughly dose proportional. Data on single dose administration 
of 25-600 mg and multiple dose administration of 25 – 400 mg show that AUC and Cmax increase 
slightly more than in proportion to dose, however, the deviation from linearity is minor with a 2.2-fold 
increase in AUC as the dose is increased 2-fold.  
No accumulation of vildagliptin is observed following single administration per day of a dose ranging 
from 25 mg to 200 mg for 10 days. This suggests that the clearance is not time-dependent.  
Variability 
The inter-subject coefficient of variation for plasma AUC is in the range of 15-20% and in Cmax about 
25% in healthy volunteers after an oral dose. The inter-individual variability in CL/F was 42% in the 
population PK analysis. 
Target population

•  Special populations 
The influence of renal and hepatic function, gender, age, weight and race on the pharmacokinetics of 
vildagliptin has been evaluated both in specific studies and in a population PK analysis. The 
population PK analysis identified renal function and gender as significant covariates affecting CL/F 
and lean body weight affecting V/F. The effects of these covariates on the pharmacokinetics were 
quite small and not considered clinically relevant. There were some deficiencies in the population 
analysis limiting the robustness of the analysis and the reliability in the results. The evaluation of PK 
in special populations has mainly been based on data from other studies. 
Vildagliptin total and renal clearance are decreased in patients with renal impairment. Vildagliptin 
AUC was increased by 101%, 32%, 134% and 42%, respectively, in patients with mild, moderate and 
severe renal impairment, and ESRD.  The relationship between renal function (as determined by 
creatinine clearance) and vildagliptin total clearance is variable, while vildagliptin renal clearance is 
better correlated to renal function. The applicant’s explanation that vildagliptin is eliminated by 
filtration, tubular secretion and metabolism (hydrolysis) in the kidney and that GFR is a poor predictor 
of renal metabolism of vildagliptin is plausible.  
The exposure of LAY151 increased several-fold and was closely related to renal function. AUC0-24h of 
the main metabolite (LAY151) was 1.6, 2.4, 5.4 and 6.7 - fold, respectively, in patients with mild, 
moderate and severe renal impairment, and ESRD. Estimates of AUC0-∞ suggest 1.7, 3.1, 13 and 17-
fold increase in exposure respectively, in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, 
and ESRD. Use in moderate and severe renal impairment and ESRD is not recommended (mentioned 
in the SPC, section 4.2, 4.4, and 5.2). 
The applicant intends to conduct additional studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and 
safety in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.  
Hepatic impairment has a limited influence of vildagliptin PK, with no effect in mild and moderate 
hepatic impairment and only a 22% increase in vildagliptin AUC in patients with severe hepatic

impairment. AUC of LAY151 increased with decreased hepatic function. There was a 2-fold increase 
in exposure of LAY151 in severe hepatic impairment. It is agreed that no dose adjustment is needed in 
patient with mild or moderate liver disease but use in severe hepatic impairment is not recommended 
due to inexperience of use  
Gender, age, weight and race had no clinically significant effects on vildagliptin exposure. 
Vildagliptin pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated in children or adolescents. 
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The main metabolic pathway is hydrolysis accounting for about 60% of the dose. Glucuronidation is a 
minor elimination pathway accounting for 4.4% of the dose and oxidation accounts only for 1.6% of 
the dose. Multiple tissues can hydrolyse vildagliptin to the major metabolite LAY151. CYP450 
isoenzymes are involved in vildagliptin metabolism only to a minor extent. Hence, the potential for 
interactions with vildagliptin metabolism is very small. Vildagliptin is a substrate of P-gp. However, 
the risk for clinically relevant interactions with inhibitors of P-gp or other transport proteins seems to 
be low. 
In vitro studies suggested a low potential for interaction with CYP450 isoenzymes. The potential for 
inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2E1, 3A4 and P-gp and potential for induction of 
CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, UGT1A1, Pgp and MRP2 has been evaluated in 
vitro. Data on potential for inhibition of CYP2B6, UGT1A1 and MRP2 are lacking and this is 
addressed as a post-authorisation follow-up measure.  
In vivo interaction studies were conducted with other antidiabetic agents (glyburide, pioglitazone, 
metformin), some cardiovascular drugs (amlodipine, valsartan, ramipril, simvastatin) and the narrow 
therapeutic drugs digoxin and warfarin. There were no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions 
between vildagliptin and the studied drugs. A small effect on digoxin renal clearance (19% reduction) 
might suggest a mild inhibition of P-glycoprotein. However, this is unlikely to be clinically relevant 
for digoxin or for other P-gp substrates. Simvastatin is a substrate for CYP3A4, S-warfarin is a 
substrate of CYP2C9 and pioglitazone is a substrate of CYP2C8. Lack of in vivo interaction with these 
substrates support the in vitro prediction that vildagliptin is not expected to affect the PK of substrates 
of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C8. 
In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic interaction potential of vildagliptin is considered to be low. 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin has been well documented. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamics was studied in 133 healthy volunteers and 185 diabetic patients. 
•  Mechanism of Action 
Vildagliptin belongs to a new class of oral anti-diabetic drugs and acts as a selective and reversible 
inhibitor of DPP-4. This enzyme inactivates the incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), 
and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). The inhibition of DPP-4 therefore increases 
the levels of these hormones which is likely to be the most significant contribution to the improvement 
of glucose homeostasis by vildagliptin. 
•  Primary and Secondary Pharmacology 
Mechanistic studies focused on examining each of the components of the proposed mechanism of 
action: 
Increase in GLP-1 and GIP levels (intended response)  
•  DPP-4 inhibition (main action) 
• 
•  Effects on pancreatic islet cell function and on insulin resistance  
•  Glucose-lowering effects (on post-prandial (PPG) or fasting glucose (FPG), on glucose 
profiles, and endogenous glucose production) 
•  Post-prandial lipid-lowering effect and effect on gastric emptying

A single dose of vildagliptin in patients with T2DM lead to inhibition of DPP-4 activity in plasma by 
more than 90% at all doses from 10 to 400 mg. The duration of DPP-4 inhibition was dose dependent 
and to achieve a lasting result the DPP-4 inhibition should be >70 % which corresponds to a 
vildagliptin dose of >10 mg bid. PK/PD modelling and simulations showed that with 50 mg bid dosing 
DPP-4 inhibition is maintained at >80% over the entire dosage interval, while with 100 mg qd DPP-4 
inhibition is decreased to about 60% at the end of the dosage interval. Increases of GLP-1 and GIP 
concentrations are the expected results of DPP-4 inhibition and studies confirmed that meal-stimulated 
as well as between-meal concentrations were raised after 4 week treatment with vildagliptin. The 
expected result of increased concentrations of incretin hormones is increased sensitivity to glucose of 
both the alpha- and beta-cells stimulation resulting in increased secretion of insulin and reduced 
glucagon secretion when glucose levels are greater than normal fasting levels. These effects were 
shown using several different analyses in a number of studies. 
Measures of insulin resistance assessed during mechanistic studies of vildagliptin showed tendencies 
towards increased insulin sensitivity. An improved metabolic state associated with lower glucose 
levels is predicted to reduce the demand for insulin and thus by definition attenuate insulin resistance. 
There are few, if any evidences that vildagliptin has an effect per-se on insulin resistance. It is 
suggested that relief from lipotoxicity may contribute to the amelioration of insulin resistance, but this 
explanation must be considered as hypothetical. 
Chronic treatment as well as treatment with a single dose of vildagliptin resulted in reductions of 
postprandial glucose. The areas under the glucose concentration time profiles during treatment with 
vildagliptin 25 mg and 100 mg bid were significantly lower compared to that during placebo 
treatment, but no effects on the glucose profiles were observed with the vildagliptin 10 mg bid. 
One-hundred mg and 200 mg vildagliptin was equally effective. There were also evidences for 
reduced fasting and mean 24 hour glucose.  It was found that vildagliptin could decrease endogenous 
glucose production which most likely is a result of decreased glucagon to insulin ratio concentrations. 
Vildagliptin reduced postprandial chylomicron TG in one study.  The underlying mechanisms and 
clinical significance of these findings  remain to be more fully explored. Vildagliptin had no effects on 
gastric emptying in the referred studies. 
Animal studies showed that vildagliptin has an inhibitory effect on rapid inward sodium channels at 
high concentration.   Based on human therapeutic plasma levels, the exposure ratio demonstrates a 
safety margin of 159-fold for the sodium channel blockage.  The inhibition of cardiac sodium currents 
may theoretically lead to a negative inotropic effect.  Myocardial contractility was not directly 
measured in preclinical studies, but macroscopic and microscopic investigations in the general toxicity 
studies did not reveal any indications of effects on myocardial contractility. 
There are unanswered questions concerning secondary pharmacology as the risk of inhibition or 
activation of other DPP-4 substrates is unclear. These could potentially include vasoactive intestinal 
peptide (VIP) and neuropeptide Y (potential to alter blood pressure control), bradykinin and substance 
P (associated angioedema in patients with low DPP-4 activity and taking ACEIs), gastrin and growth 
hormone release mediators, or immune cytokines. Potential risks associated with these effects are 
identified in the risk management plan.  
In conclusion, the pharmacodynamic actions of vildagliptin fully explain the lowering of blood 
glucose.  
Clinical efficacy  
Overview 
Data establishing the clinical efficacy of vildagliptin are based on 9 core studies: 
3 monotherapy placebo- and active comparator (metformin and rosiglitazone) controlled studies, 4 
add-on placebo-controlled studies (add-on to metformin, pioglitazone, glimepiride and insulin) and 1 
initial combination therapy with pioglitazone (Tab. 1). An additional monotherapy study (study 2384) 
has been finalised during the on-going MAA procedure and data from this study has been provided. 
Study 2384 included 354 patients and had a design identical to study 2301.

Dose-finding studies 
The doses of vildagliptin chosen for the phase III studies were based on 3 pharmacodynamic studies 
and 3 short-term monotherapy and add-on combination studies. In these studies there were indications 
that  the  doses  50  mg  qd  and  50  mg  bid  were  equally  effective.  According  to  results  from  a  meta-
analysis, there is an increase in the placebo-subtracted effect of vildagliptin when the dose is increased 
from 50 mg to 100 mg. This increase is greater in patients with baseline HbA1c of 9.5% (-0.45%) than 
in  those  with  baseline  HbA1C  of  8.5%  (-0.28%).  Although  this  difference  is  small,  it  was  thus 
considered  justified  using  100mg  instead  of  50mg.  The  reductions  in  HbA1c  observed  with  the 
sulfonylurea  combination  are  not  meaningfully  greater  for  100  mg  daily  versus  50  mg  daily  and 
therefore a dose of 50 mg once daily is proposed for this indication. 
Monotherapy studies 
All trials followed the same general randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study 
design, varying only in duration of the run-in and treatment period. 
METHODS 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM, with no or only minimal prior treatment, aged 18-80 years 
(18-78 in study 2309), a BMI between 22 and 45 kg/m2, and an HbA1c of 7.5-11% (7.5-10% in study 
2301). 
Endpoints 
The primary efficacy parameter was HbA1c. Some of the secondary efficacy parameters included were: 
FPG, fasting lipids, body weight, some parameters indicative of beta-cell function and insulin 
resistance, responder rates: (Endpoint HbA1c < 7% / ≤ 6.5%. HbA1c absolute reduction from baseline 
at endpoint ≥ 1%, /   ≥ 0.7%, / ≥ 0.5%). 
Statistical methods 
The statistical methods used, including the approach to deal with the baseline HbA1c assay issue, were 
considered to be adequate. For non-inferiority trials, a pre-specified non-inferiority limit of 0.4% was 
used. 
RESULTS 
The percentages of completers were generally high (68.5-86.9%)   in all study groups. 
Baseline data 
Mean baseline HbA1c was between 8.2 and 8.7% (having the lowest values in study 2301 compared to 
the other studies). Mean BMI was between 31.9 and 32.9 kg/m2. 
Outcomes 
The 24-week data show reductions from baseline in HbA1c with vildagliptin in all studies, ranging 
from - 0.8% to - 1.1% (Fig.1, Tab. 2). In study 2301 (that included 39.2 % of patients diagnosed for < 
3months), a considerable HbA1c reduction (-0.3%) was seen in the placebo group.  In the group of 
patients that was diagnosed for ≥ 3 months, the placebo group showed little change in HbA1c 
(+0.2%). 
Vildagliptin 50 mg bid was demonstrated to be non-inferior to rosiglitazone 8 mg qd in the reduction 
of HbA1c at endpoint.  At 24 weeks, the reduction in HbA1c with vildagliptin 50 mg bid did not reach 
non-inferiority compared to metformin 1000 mg bid. The results in the full ITT population (if different 
from primary ITT population) did not differ from the results in the primary efficacy ITT population in 
any clinically significant manner.

Ancillary Analyses 
Fasting plasma glucose: There were reductions from baseline in FPG with vildagliptin in all studies, 
ranging from - 0.8 to - 1.3 mmol/L. 
Fasting lipids: Compared to placebo and metformin, there were modest improvements that were not 
generally statistically significant.   
Body weight: Changes in body weight from baseline with vildagliptin treatment ranged from - 1.80 kg 
to - 0.02 kg across studies and doses. No relevant changes were found compared to placebo. 
Summary of the monotherapy studies 
The monotherapy studies included patients with characteristic baseline data for T2DM with a rather 
short duration of the disease. Vildagliptin therapy for 24 week resulted in a reduction of HbA1c (~1%) 
(Fig. 1) and FPG (~1 mmol/l). Vildagliptin was statistically inferior to metformin 1000 mg bid and 
may be clinically, although not statistically, inferior to rosiglitazone 8 mg qd (CI for difference 
between treatments -0.01 to 0.39, non-inferiority margin 0.40, ITT population). For HbA1c results in 
the PP population, the upper limit of the confidence interval of the difference between vildagliptin and 
rosiglitazone exceeded the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 0.4%. At present there are no data 
comparing vildagliptin and SU,this is addressed as a post authorisation follow-up measure. 
Vildagliptin treatment was largely lipid and weight neutral.  There were indications of improvements 
in markers of beta cell function including HOMA-b (Homeostasis Model Assessment –b), proinsulin 
to insulin ratio and measures of beta cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance 
test. However, in the phase III studies the effects on beta-cell function were not consistent across 
studies and depended on the parameters tested. 
Add-on combination therapy studies 
All trials followed the same general randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study 
design, varying only in duration of the run-in and treatment period.

Study Participants  
Patients with T2DM whose glycaemic control was not achieved despite treatment were treated for ≥ 3 
months with anti-diabetic drugs and had not achieved adequate glycaemic control.  The initial 
17/34

combination therapy study (2355) was performed in drug-naive patients with T2DM (with no or only 
minimal prior treatment). 
Patients were 18-80 years old (18-78 in study 2303), had a BMI between 22 and 45 kg/m2 and an 
HbA1c of 7.5-11%. 
Further inclusion criteria: 
Study 2303: Patients on a stable dose of at least 1500 mg metformin daily for a minimum of 4 weeks 
prior to first visit 1. For a maximum tolerated dose of metformin < 2000 mg daily, either an attempt to 
reach higher doses in the past was demonstrated or a start with a higher dose at the beginning of the 
trial was performed. The dose of metformin used at randomization had to be maintained unchanged 
throughout the trial. 
Study 2304: Patients on a TZD for at least 3 months demonstrating a therapeutic response by a 
decrease in HbA1c of ≥0.5% or a decrease in FPG of ≥30 mg/dL. Eligible patients were placed on 
pioglitazone 45 mg qd and randomized 4 weeks later.  A 12-week pre-study period was offered to 
eligible patients in which they received open-label pioglitazone at a minimum dose of 30 mg. 
Study 2305: Patients on a sulfonylurea for at least 3 months and at a stable dose (at least 7.5 mg 
glyburide qd, 7.5 mg glipizide qd, or 2 mg glimepiride qd) for a minimum of four weeks prior to first 
visit. Prior sulfonylurea monotherapy was switched to glimepiride 4 mg qd and could be reduced to 2 
mg qd according to specific guidelines. Patients were offered a pre-study period in which they could 
receive open-label glimepiride 2 mg to 4 mg qd.  Patients previously treated with low dose 
sulfonylurea monotherapy were offered a 4-week pre-study period.  Patients previously receiving 
combination therapy with a sulfonylurea and metformin were offered an 8-week pre-study period.   
Study 2311: Patients treated with insulin for at least 3 months, and at least 30 Units of insulin per day 
for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to first visit. The insulin dose could be reduced for safety reasons.  
Additionally, the daily dose of insulin could be reduced as clinically indicated but upward adjustments 
should not exceed 25% of the baseline insulin dose.   
No studies comparing vildagliptin add-on to metformin with other add-on therapies were included in 
the application. 
Overall, patients in study 2303 and 2305 were representative of the target population. The 
requirements for metformin dose was considered to be adequate. The required glimepiride dose was 
considered as rather low and therefore some concerns remained about whether these patients represent 
true SU failures.  
The design of study 2355 involved initial combination therapy, which is not in accordance with 
current therapeutic guidelines, and thus was considered as only supportive. 
Endpoints 
The primary efficacy parameter was HbA1c. The secondary efficacy parameters were in general the 
same as in the monotherapy studies. 
RESULTS 
The proportion of patients completing the studies were considered as rather high. As expected the 
proportions of patients withdrawing because of unsatisfactory therapeutic effect were higher in the 
placebo compared to the vildagliptin groups. 
Baseline data 
The mean baseline HbA1c of patients across studies and groups was 8.3% - 8.7%, with mean baseline 
FPG values ranging from 9.0 to10.9 mmol/L.  The mean duration of diabetes was 5 to 8 years in the 3 
studies conducted as on add-on to oral agents, and longer in the add-on to insulin study (14 to 15 
years).Overall, baseline characteristics were well matched between treatment groups within the studies 
and were typical for T2DM populations.

The addition of vildagliptin resulted in statistically significant decreases in HbA1c (Tab. 3, Fig. 2). 
Efficacy was greater with vildagliptin 50 mg bid compared to 50 mg qd for the combinations with 
metformin and pioglitazone. However, in the population consisting of patients inadequately controlled 
on sulfonylurea therapy, the dose-dependency was less evident. The 50 mg qd dose of vildagliptin was 
not tested in combination with insulin. 
The results in the full ITT population (if different from primary ITT population) did not differ from 
the results in the primary efficacy ITT population in any clinically significant manner.

As in the monotherapy studies vildagliptin was largely lipid neutral.  
When added to metformin, vildagliptin dose-dependently increased weight up to 1.24 kg on average 
compared to metformin alone, but the combined effect of metformin and vildagliptin on weight 
compared to baseline values was largely weight-neutral. Similarly, when vildagliptin at 50 mg per day 
was added to glimepiride, weight increased only slightly (+.31 kg) compared to monotherapy, and the 
combined effect of a SU and vildagliptin on weight compared to baseline values is considered to be 
weight-neutral. Vildagliptin in the combination with pioglitazone resulted in a dose-dependent 
increase in weight up to 2.69 kg compared to the effect of pioglitazone alone (1.41 kg) 
Summary of the add-on combination studies 
The add-on therapy studies included patients with inadequate glucose control on monotherapy with 
metformin, SU, TZD or insulin. Add-on therapy with vildagliptin resulted in clinically and statistically 
significant reductions of HbA1c (mean reductions from baseline of 0.51 – 0.97 % on the 50 mg bid 
dose) and FPG (mean reductions of 0.44-1.13 mmol/l) compared to placebo in all studies. The HbA1c 
reduction in study 2305 (combination with glimepiride) was less pronounced compared to other add-
on studies. However, the reduction in HbA1c was significantly larger compared to placebo and can be 
considered as clinically relevant. 
Vildagliptin was largely weight neutral in combination with metformin and SU, but the combination 
with pioglitazone resulted in a dose-dependent increase in weight. No comparisons have been made 
with other often used add-on alternatives such as metformin plus SU, for which efficacy and safety is 
well documented. This is addressed as a post authorisation follow-up measure. 
The addition of vildagliptin to insulin therapy resulted in a larger reduction in HbA1c compared to 
placebo. However, the CHMP had concerns, whether a difference of 0.27% would be clinically 
meaningful. Even though the results in the elderly population were more pronounced (-0.70%), the 
number of elderly patients was too small to draw reliable conclusions, and further mechanistic and 
clinical studies are needed to support these findings. The applicant therefore withdrew the indication 
for the combination with insulin, as claimed initially, during the evaluation of the MAA. 
Special Populations 
Two-hundred thirty eight patients older than 65 and 41 patients older than 75 years have been treated 
with the recommended dose of vildagliptin as monotherapy in the primary ITT population. The 
reduction in HbA1c was somewhat smaller in patients older than 75 years, but the number of patients 
was limited.  
Non-obese patients responded better to vildagliptin than obese patients. This difference in efficacy 
may, at least partly, be explained by increased insulin resistance in obese subjects and may not be of 
clinical relevance.  
The efficacy in male patients was larger compared to that in females and the efficacy in black people 
was smaller compared to that in Caucasians and Hispanics. There is no evident explanation to these 
differences in efficacy. However, a mean difference of 0.2% between men and women may not be of 
clinical relevance. Furthermore, no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of 
vildagliptin have been observed between male and female healthy subjects or due to ethnicity. 
The efficacy of vildagliptin in patients with mild renal insufficiency is largely similar to that in 
patients with normal renal function. The limited number of subjects with moderate renal impairment 
that were treated with vildagliptin 50 mg bid had similar reduction in HbA1c (-0.90%) compared to 
subjects with normal or mild renal insufficiency. More data is needed before vildagliptin can be 
recommended in patients with moderate renal insufficiency.   
Vildagliptin subgroups of patients with pre-existing CHF also had a decrease in HbA1c at the study 
endpoint. However, caution has to be exercised in interpreting efficacy in this subgroup due to the low 
patient numbers. 
Long-term Efficacy data 
23/34 
© EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concerning  long-term  efficacy  data  for  vildagliptin,  results  have  been  provided  from  one  52  week 
study (metformin-controlled, monotherapy, study 2309) and one 40 week extension study following a 
12 week core study (add-on therapy to metformin, study 2204), both designed to show efficacy over 1 
year (Fig. 3).   The proportion of completers after 52 weeks in the monotherapy study was 72% of 780 
randomised patients and thus this study provide 1 year efficacy data for vildagliptin as monotherapy in 
a substantial group of patients. The results achieved after 24 weeks in this study were less pronounced 
at the week 52 follow-up, but still clinically relevant (mean reduction of HbA1c = 0.96%).

During  the  MAA  procedure,  data  has  been  provided  from  a  1  year  extension  of  the  52  week 
monotherapy study (2309 E1). At 2 years, a 1.0% reduction in HbA1c was observed in the vildagliptin 
50  mg  bid  treatment  group  compared  to  a  1.5%  reduction  in  the  metformin  1000  mg  bid  treatment 
group (Tab. 2, Fig. 4). However, the durability of the efficacy of vildagliptin will be formally assessed 
in  an  ongoing    appropriately  powered  time  to  failure  analysis  intended  to  assess  sustainability  of 
glycaemic control.

Long-term efficacy data for vildagliptin as add-on therapy is more limited. Only 32 patients treated 
with vildagliptin plus metformin completed the extension study and these patients were not treated 
with the recommended dose 50 mg bid. Long-term extension studies are on-going and the Applicant 
has committed to provide results as FUM.  
Clinical safety 
•  Patient exposure 
Safety data was obtained from 3784 patients with T2DM in phase II or III trials of ≥ 12 weeks 
treatment duration, with 2264 patients receiving vildagliptin as monotherapy and 1520 patients 
receiving vildagliptin in combination with another medicinal product.The target dose of 100 mg 
vildagliptin was given to 2682 patients. 274 patients have been exposed to vildagliptin for ≥52 weeks 
as monotherapy which is considered as sufficient according to guidelines.

Overall, the ratios of completers were sufficiently high throughout studies. The number of patients 
discontinuing due to adverse events did not differ between vildagliptin and placebo groups except for 
an increased proportion in the vildagliptin+insulin group compared to placebo+insulin group due to 
gastrointestinal side effects.

The overall incidences of AEs in the three vildagliptin dosing groups in the monotherapy studies were 
largely comparable to those in the placebo groups. Adverse drug reactions reported at an increased 
frequency compared to placebo included dizziness, headache, peripheral oedema, constipation, 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and arthralgia.  
Severe events in the vildagliptin 50 mg bid group were driven by infections and infestations 
(influenza, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis), occurring in 1.4% of patients versus 0.3% on placebo, and 
nervous system disorders (0.9% of patients) versus 0.6% on placebo.   
Adverse events in combination studies 
Adverse drug reactions reported in patients who received Galvus 100 mg in combination with 
metformin (n=208) included tremor, headache, dizziness, fatigue and nausea. 
Tremor, headache, dizziness, asthenia, nasopharyngitis and constipation were more common when 
glimepiride was combined with vildagliptin (n=170) compared to placebo.  
When vildagliptin 100mg was combined with pioglitazone 45 mg daily (n=158), the frequency of 
peripheral oedema was higher compared to pioglitazone plus placebo (7.0% versus 2.5%), and the 
absolute weight increases with placebo, Galvus 50 mg daily and Galvus100 mg daily were 1.4, 1.5 and 
2.7 kg, respectively. Headache and asthenia were also more common than with placebo. The incidence 
of oedema when vildagliptin 100 mg was combined with pioglitazone 30 mg daily as dual initial 
therapy in drug naïve patients was however less than for pioglitazone alone (6.1% vs 9.3%). 
The applicant has commited to further characterize the cardiac safety of the combination of 
vildagliptin and TZD as a post authorisation follow-up measure. 
.  
In the clinical pharmacology studies the adverse events did not differ from those seen in the clinical 
trials. With high doses of vildagliptin (400 mg and 600 mg), peripheral oedema, pain in extremities, 
myalgia and paresthesia emerged as dose-dependent AEs. 
Angioedema 
Rare cases of angioedema have been reported on vildagliptin at a similar rate to controls. These cases 
appear more frequent when vildagliptin is administered in combination with an ACE I.  Angioedema 
will be followed as part of targeted post-marketing activities. Information concerning angioedema is 
included in section 4.8 of the SPC. 
Cardiac adverse events 
Since early studies had shown sudden deaths in dogs at high doses of vildagliptin, and a later telemetry 
study  in  dogs  had  shown  an  effect  on  cardiac  conduction  at  peak  concentrations  of  high  doses  of 
vildagliptin, special focus was placed on the potential for conduction disturbances in human subjects. 
ECG  measurements  during  exposure  to  high  doses  in  healthy  volunteers  showed  no  effect  of 
vildagliptin on QT/QTc or QRS intervals with doses from 100mg daily up to 400mg. In the clinical 
studies, there was a higher incidence of first degree AV block in patients treated with vildagliptin as 
defined by the proportion of patients with PR >200 msec. A majority of the patients with first degree 
AV block had only moderately increased PR lengths. At this stage the association between vildagliptin 
and  first  degree  AV  block  can  be  neither  confirmed  nor  excluded.  Conduction  disorder  and  cardiac 
events  of  hypoxic  and/or  ischemic  origin  will  be  evaluated  as  part  of  targeted  post-marketing 
activities. 
Hypoglycaemia 
In the monotherapy studies the number of patients with hypoglycaemic events was low in all treatment 
groups.  However,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  reported  hypoglycaemic  events  in  the  vildagliptin 
26/34

groups was higher with vildagliptin monotherapy (0.4% on vildagliptin 100mg daily) as compared to 
placebo  (0%),  but  similar  compared  to  some  active  controls  (0.4%  in  both  the  metformin  and 
rosiglitazone groups and 0% in the pioglitazone group) 
With the exception of vildagliptin plus insulin combination, this was also the case with vildagliptin 
add-on therapy. In particular, the proportion of hypoglycaemic events in the vildagliptin plus 
glimepiride group was higher in a dose-dependent manner compared to placebo plus glimepiride. 
Because there was also no additional efficacy demonstrated for vildagliptin 100mg daily in 
combination with glimepiride, a limitation of the dose of vildagliptin to 50 mg once daily is therefore 
recommended for this indication, as described in the SPC. 
No severe hypoglycaemic events were reported on vildagliptin. 
Skin disorders 
Due to the findings of skin lesions in monkeys, the Applicant has performed a review of reported skin 
disorders in the clinical study program for vildagliptin. Overall, the cases were rather few and of mild 
severity. The most frequently reported disorders were those of rash and rash-related events. However, 
rash-related disorders were not similar to the skin lesions observed in the monkey toxicity study.  
Adverse events such as skin lesions, blister and skin ulcer could potentially provide the closest clinical 
correlation to the types of lesions observed in the monkey study. The incidence rates of selected skin-
related events (blister, skin lesion, exfoliation, ulcer and diabetic foot complications) observed for 
vildagliptin 50mg QD and 100mg daily were similar to the placebo incidence. There did not seem to 
be a relationship between the vildagliptin dose and skin events.  
To alert prescribers to notice potential skin disorders and to provide information concerning the 
limited experience in patients with skin complications, a warning has been included in SPC section 
4.4.  Skin events will be part of targeted post-marketing activities 
Other potential risks 
Potential risks associated with vildagliptin due to hypothetical mechanistic considerations or non 
clinical findings include infections, muscle events, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and severe 
hypoglycaemia. These potential risks will be monitored in the PSURs and/ or in the planned post 
authorisation safety study (angioedema, foot ulcer, hepatic toxicity, serious infections, 
hypoxic/ischemic cardiac events, peripheral oedema). 
•  Serious adverse events and deaths 
SAE were uncommon in all studies and there was no clustering of specific advents associated with 
vildagliptin treatment. In total, including ongoing studies, there were 50 SAEs with an outcome of 
death. Of these cases, 26 (6 female and 20 male) patients were exposed to vildagliptin mono- or add-
on combination therapy. All 26 of these cases were considered not suspected to be related to study 
drug. The causes of death included a variety of different conditions and were largely similar in patients 
treated with vildagliptin and in patients in other treatment groups. 
•  Safety in special populations 
Gender:  
In both monotherapy and add-on studies the overall AE rates in females were higher than in males 
which was not the case in the placebo groups. There is no evident explanation to this difference. The 
applicant has committed to monitor this as part as routine pharmacovigilance acivities. 
Elderly:  
Elderly patients, in particular those with moderate renal dysfunction, have a notably higher incidence 
of AEs relative to cardiac disorders and eye disorders although caution is needed in interpretation of 
these difference due to the low patient numbers in this renal category. Safety data regarding this 
population will be monitored specifically.

Renal Insufficiency:  
The number of subjects with MDRD estimated renal impairment for the monotherapy and add-on 
therapy datasets was 1870 patients. Of these 198 vildagliptin-treated patients had moderate renal 
impairment in both datasets combined. In the monotherapy studies there were indications of an 
increased incidence of overall AE and of gastrointestinal and nervous system disorders in patients with 
moderate renal insufficiency. Concerning the add-on studies, there were too few patients with 
moderate renal impairment in each treatment group for an adequate evaluation of safety. However, the 
overall incidence of AE in patients with moderate renal impairment tended to be higher when 
vildagliptin was combined with metformin and pioglitazone compared to placebo. Until more data in 
this patient group is available, vildagliptin should not be recommended to patients with moderate and 
severe renal impairment (mentioned in the SPC in section 4.2 as well as 4.4). The Applicant will, as a 
FUM, provide additional information in patients with moderate and severe renal failure.   
Congestive Heart Failure:  
A limitation of the vildagliptin database is that cardiac function was not proactively assessed at 
baseline; therefore the patients were only categorized as having CHF if they volunteered this 
information as part of the baseline past medical history.  Furthermore, patients with heart failure 
NYHA III-IV were largely excluded from the clinical studies. Upon the concerns expressed by the 
CHMP, the applicant has identified 43 patients with a CHF history treated with vildagliptin in the 
current monotherapy and add-on datasets. In addition, cardiovascular safety data from additional 19 
patients with CHF treated with vildagliptin 100 mg daily from an ongoing study has become available. 
In addition, a population with possible systolic dysfunction (CHF history at baseline, myocardial 
infarction history, cardiac bypass surgery history, ECG finding indicative of myocardial infarction, 
treatment with either digoxin/digitoxin, treatment with a combination of a renin-angiotension-system 
blocking agent and a loop diuretic) and high cardiac risk (criteria as above and coronary artery disease 
history or QRS > 120 msec at baseline) has been identified (n=629 on vildagliptin 100 mg daily). Even 
though the incidence of cardiac adverse events were rather low, there was no apparently different 
pattern of cardiac AE in this group of patients compared to patients treated with other comparators. 
Although the data in patients with CHF class NYHA I-II patients is therefore limited (currently N=62), 
such patients were included in the clinical trials and their safety profile was no different from that in 
patients without CHF. In the SPC, section 4.2, caution is therefore advised for the use in patients with 
CHF stage NYHA  class I-II, and the use is not recommended at all for NYHA class III-IV. Further 
information in this population will be generated as part of the post-authorisation follow-up measures. 
The applicant proposed initially the use of vildagliptin in patients, in whom metformin could not be 
used (e.g. because of intolerance or contraindications). Of concern to the CHMP with regard to this 
indication was the fact, that contraindications for metformin largely overlap with restrictions of usage 
for vildagliptin, i.e. impaired cardiac function (class III-IV) and moderate to severe renal function. 
This would have limited the usage of vildagliptin with regard to this second-line monotherapy 
indication largely to patients intolerant to metformin, representing presumably a small subgroup. The 
applicant withdrew this part of the proposed indication on 5.July 2007, upon the concerns by the 
CHMP. 
•  Laboratory findings 
A small numerical imbalance of reports of generally asymptomatic elevated transaminases was 
reported in patients treated with vildagliptin 100 mg daily in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, it is 
recommended in section   4.4 of the SPC that liver function tests be performed prior to the initiation of 
treatment with Galvus and periodically thereafter. Galvus should not be used in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment.

imbalance of reports of generally 
asymptomatic elevated transaminases was 
reported in patients treated with 
vildagliptin 100 mg daily in controlled 
clinical trials (see section 4.8). Therefore, 
as per routine clinical practice, it is 
recommended that liver function tests be 
performed prior to the initiation of 
treatment with Galvus and periodically 
thereafter. Patients who develop increased 
transaminase levels should be monitored 
with a second liver function evaluation to 
confirm the finding and be monitored 
until the abnormality(ies) return to 
normal. Should an increase in aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) of 3 x ULN or 
greater persist, withdrawal of therapy with 
Galvus is recommended.

Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
There are no unresolved quality issues which may affect the Benefit/Risk balance.  
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Overall,  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  provided  adequate  evidence  of  a  glucose-lowering 
effect of vildagliptin in animal models of diabetes. Vildagliptin was shown to act in vitro and in vivo 
as an inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4, thus modulating glucose metabolism. The general pharmacology 
studies  showed  little  safety  concerns.  Cardiovascular  changes  at  high  concentrations  in  dogs  were 
further investigated in humans and are taken into account within the RMP. From the pharmacokinetic 
point of view, vildagliptin showed high bioavailability and similar kinetics in all species and in man.  
Overall, the toxicology programme raised little concern; there were, however, skin-lesions observed in 
vildagliptin-treated cynomolgus monkeys. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown, but no 
equivalent  was  found  in  clinical  safety  studies.  Nevertheless,  this  issue  is  addressed  in  the  SPC,  as 
well as in follow-up measures. 
Efficacy 
Vildagliptin belongs to a new class of oral anti-diabetic drugs and acts as an inhibitor of DPP-4, thus 
increasing the levels of incretin hormones which is thought to be the principal mechanism of 
improvement of glucose homeostasis by vildagliptin. Data establishing the clinical efficacy of 
vildagliptin are based on a series of sufficiently large core studies: 
Studies with vildagliptin given alone in T2DM patients showed a reduction of HbA1c (~1%) and FPG 
(~1 mmol/l) after 24 weeks. In comparator monotherapy studies, vildagliptin was not non-inferior 
(using a non-inferiority margin of 0.40%) to metformin 1000 mg bid . Statistical non-inferiority to 
rosiglitazone 8 mg qd was shown in an ITT analysis, but failed in a per-protocol analysis. Vildagliptin 
treatment as monotherapy was largely lipid and weight neutral.  
A second line monotherapy indication, as initially sought by the applicant, was of concern to the 
CHMP with regard to the fact, that contraindications for metformin, which is the first line 
monotherapy, largely overlap with contraindications for vildagliptin, i.e. impaired cardiac and renal 
function. This would have limited the usage of vildagliptin with regard to this second-line 
monotherapy indication largely to patients intolerant to metformin, representing presumably a small 
subgroup. The applicant withdrew this part of the proposed indication on 5 July 2007. 
The usage as approved is largely based on 3 pivotal add-on placebo-controlled studies each with 
metformin, pioglitazone, and glimepiride as a base treatment. The populations studied hereby reflected 
sufficiently the populations indicated for use, i.e. for an add-on therapy with vildagliptin in patients 
with: insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin, 
or: in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea 
and for whom metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance, or: in patients with 
insufficient glycaemic control and for whom the use of a thiazolidinedione is appropriate. 
Add-on therapy of vildagliptin to insulin was also studied by the applicant. Upon concerns by the 
CHMP, among them the relatively small decrease of HbA1C values (mean reduction of 0.27%), the 
applicant withdrew the indication of a combined usage of vildagliptin and insulin during the 
evaluation of the MAA. 
The 3 add-on therapy studies included patients with inadequate glucose control on monotherapy and 
achieved clinically relevant reductions of HbA1c (mean reductions of 0.51 – 0.97 % on the 50 mg bid 
dose) and FPG (mean reductions of 0.44-1.13 mmol/l) compared to placebo, when vildagliptin was 
added to either metformin, pioglitazone, or glimepiride. 
31/34

Vildagliptin was largely weight neutral in combination with metformin and glimepiride, but the 
combination with pioglitazone resulted in a dose-dependent increase in weight. No comparisons have 
been made with other often used add-on alternatives such as metformin combined with a sulfonylurea. 
The recommended dose is 100 mg daily administered either once daily or divided into two doses of 50 
mg given in the morning and evening for use in combination with metformin or a thiazolidinedione. 
The proportion of hypoglycaemic events in the vildagliptin plus glimepiride group was higher in a 
dose-dependent manner compared to placebo plus glimepiride. Because there was also no additional 
efficacy demonstrated for vildagliptin 100mg daily in combination with glimepiride, a limitation of the 
dose of vildagliptin to 50 mg once daily is therefore recommended for this indication. 
No study in the paediatric population was performed and therefore the use in this population is not 
recommended.  
Experience in patients aged 75 years and older is limited and caution should be exercised with the use 
in this population. 
Safety 
Safety data was based on a sufficiently large number of  3784 patients with T2DM exposed for ≥ 12 
weeks, both as monotherapy or in combination with another antidiabetic product. 274 patients have 
been exposed to vildagliptin for ≥52 weeks as monotherapy which was considered as sufficient 
according to guidelines. 
The overall incidences of AEs for monotherapy with vildagliptin were largely comparable to placebo. 
Adverse drug reactions reported at an increased frequency compared to placebo included dizziness, 
headache, peripheral oedema, constipation, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and 
arthralgia..  
In combination with metformin, adverse drug reactions were reported to include tremor, headache, 
dizziness, fatigue and nausea.  
Similarly, tremor, headache, dizziness, asthenia, nasopharyngitis and constipation were more common 
when glimepiride was combined with vildagliptin, compared to placebo.  
Combined with pioglitazone 45 mg daily, the frequency of peripheral oedema was higher compared to 
pioglitazone alone (7.0% versus 2.5%). There was also a dose-dependent weight increases of 1.4, 1.5, 
and 2.7 kg, with placebo, Galvus 50 mg daily, and Galvus 100 mg daily, and headache and asthenia 
were more common. The applicant has commited to further characterize the cardiac safety of the 
combination of vildagliptin and TZD as part of the post-marketing follow-up measures.  
Rare cases of angioedema and a small numerical imbalance of reports of elevated transaminases have 
been reported, both of which have been adressed appropriately in the SPC. 
Since early studies had shown sudden deaths in dogs at high doses of vildagliptin, special focus was 
placed  on  the  potential  for  conduction  disturbances  in  human  subjects.  ECG  measurements  during 
exposure to high doses in healthy volunteers showed no effect, however, in the clinical studies, there 
was  a  higher  incidence  of  first  degree  AV  block  in  patients  treated  with  vildagliptin.  Thus,  an 
association between vildagliptin and first degree AV block can neither be confirmed nor excluded, and 
the Applicant has committed to perform appropriate follow-up measures. 
In the monotherapy studies the number of patients with hypoglycaemic events was low in all treatment 
groups. The proportion of patients reporting hypoglycemia was 0.4% in the vildagliptin 100mg daily 
group, and similar to some active controls. With the exception of vildagliptin plus insulin combination 
and vildagliptin plus pioglitazone combination, this was also the case with vildagliptin add-on therapy. 
In  particular,  the  proportion  of  hypoglycaemic  events  in  the  vildagliptin  plus  glimepiride  group  was 
higher  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  compared  to  placebo  plus  glimepiride.  Consequently,  a  dose  of 
vildagliptin limited to 50 mg once daily is recommended for this latter indication. 
Preclinical  studies  with  vildagliptin  found  skin  lesions  in  monkeys.  No  clinical  equivalent  has  been 
detected in the clinical studies, however. Awareness for possible skin alterations is raised by a warning 
32/34

in the SPC. Additional follow-up measures, including planned mechanistic preclinical studies, address 
these concerns. 
SAE  were  uncommon  in  all  studies  and  there  was  no  clustering  of  specific  advents  associated  with 
vildagliptin treatment.  
From vildagliptin monotherapy studies came some evidence of an increased incidence of overall AE in 
patients with moderate renal insufficiency, with inconclusive results from add-on studies. Therefore, 
vildagliptin should not be recommended in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment until 
more data is available, which is expected from a post-approval study. 
Vildagliptin  safety  is  not  sufficiently  assessed  in  patients  with  CHF.  Therefore,  caution  is  urged  for 
patients with CHF class NYHA I-II, and the use is not recommended at all for those in NYHA class 
III-IV, as advised in the SPC. To resolve these uncertainties, the applicant has committed to undertake 
appropriate follow up measure. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these. 
•  User consultation 
The Applicant performed a user consultation testing on the package leaflet. The design of the test 
formed the basis of an adequate and competent testing of the PIL in regard to finding, diagnosing and 
amending possible weaknesses.  The present readability test was well designed to meet its main 
objectives. The results of the user testing described in the user testing report support the changes made 
to the PIL. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
Benefits of vildagliptin as add-on therapy to metformin, glimepiride and pioglitazone include 
clinically relevant and significant reductions of HbA1c and FPG compared to placebo. Vildagliptin 
treatment is also largely lipid and weight neutral in combination with metformin and glimepiride, and 
efficacy (as monotherapy) has been shown for up to 2 years treatment. However, the vildagliptin add-
on therapy to metformin, pioglitazone and glimepiride has not been compared to other add-on 
alternatives and long-term efficacy data for vildagliptin (as add-on therapy) is limited. Both 
uncertainties are addressed in ongoing studies, the results of which will be evaluated as follow-up-
measures. 
Risks of the use of vildagliptin are an increase in weight and peripheral oedema when used with 
pioglitazone (45 mg per day). Combined with sulfonylureas, the risk of hypoglycemia is increased. 
Rare cases of angioedema, and elevations of transaminases have been reported. The findings of skin 
lesions in monkeys had no clinical equivalent so far and is addressed in follow-up measures. 
For populations with CHF and renal insufficiency, there is insufficient safety data, or the possibility of 
an increased rate of AE, respectively. For both populations, the use of vildagliptin is either restricted  
or not recommended. Both populations are investigated with this regard in studies as post-approval 
commitments. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131)  Routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
(cid:131)  No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.

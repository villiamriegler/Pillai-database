2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Breast  cancer  is  the  most  common  type  of  cancer  and  a  leading  cause  of  cancer  mortality  among 
women  in  the  US  and  Europe.  Approximately  246,660  new  cases  of  breast  cancer  are  predicted  this 
year in the US (14.6% of all new cancers) and it is estimated that the disease will contribute to 40,450 
deaths (ACS 2016). In Europe 92,300 deaths due to breast cancer are predicted for 2016 (Malvezzi et 
al 2016).  
Although  treatable,  metastatic  breast  cancer  remains  an  incurable  disease  with  a  median  overall 
survival of 2–3 years and a 5-year survival of only 25% (ESMO Advanced Breast Cancer Guideline). 
Management 
Assessment report  
EMA/490887/2017

Treatment of breast cancer is determined by the extent of the disease. Early or localized breast cancer 
is  treated  by  a  combination  of  surgery  and  radiotherapy.  Adjuvant  systemic  therapy,  consisting  of 
chemotherapy  and/or  endocrine  therapy,  in  tumours  deemed  hormone  responsive,  can  prolong  the 
disease-free  interval  and  improve  overall  survival.  However,  approximately  30%  to  40%  of  patients 
with early breast cancer will ultimately relapse, with either local recurrence or distant metastases, and 
require further systemic treatment for advanced disease.  
Current  treatment  guidelines  emphasise  the  preferential  use  of  endocrine  therapy  in  postmenopausal 
women with HR+ advanced breast cancer, and recommend that chemotherapy should be reserved for 
cases of rapidly progressive disease or proven endocrine resistance (Cardoso et al 2014). The choice of 
first-line endocrine therapy for HR+ advanced breast cancer depends on the type and length of therapy 
received in the adjuvant setting (if any). The endocrine therapy options include, but are not limited to, 
selective  estrogen  receptor  modulators  (SERM;  e.g.  tamoxifen),  estrogen  receptor  antagonists  (e.g. 
fulvestrant),  selective  non-steroidal  aromatase  inhibitors  (NSAI;  e.g.  anastrozole  and  letrozole)  and 
steroidal aromatase inhibitors (e.g. exemestane). These agents may be given in first, second or later 
lines  of  therapy  for  advanced  breast  cancer  (ESMO  Guideline;  NCCN  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  in 
Oncology).  Fulvestrant  is  currently  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  estrogen  receptor  positive,  locally 
advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  in  postmenopausal  women  with  disease  relapse  on  or  after 
adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or disease progression on antiestrogen therapy (see Faslodex SmPC). 
Clinical practice guidelines also refer to palbociclib, a cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, that 
has  recently  been  approved  as  an  add-on  to  endocrine  therapy  (see  Ibrance  SmPC).  Combination  of 
exemestane with everolimus is also an option in postmenopausal women without symptomatic visceral 
disease  after  recurrence  or  progression  following  a  non-steroidal  aromatase  inhibitor  (see  Afinitor 
SmPC).  
Primary or acquired resistance to initial endocrine therapy ultimately results in disease progression in a 
large  proportion  of  breast  cancers.  To  overcome  this  initial  resistance,  sequential  endocrine  therapies 
are used in the advanced disease setting (NCCN 2016; Rugo et al 2016; Cardoso et al 2014).  
About the product 
Fulvestrant is a competitive estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist with an affinity comparable to estradiol. 
Fulvestrant blocks the trophic actions of estrogens without any partial agonist (estrogen-like) activity. 
The mechanism of action is associated with downregulation of estrogen receptor protein levels. Clinical 
studies in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer have shown that fulvestrant significantly 
downregulates ER protein in ER positive tumours compared with placebo. There was also a significant 
decrease in progesterone receptor expression consistent with a lack of intrinsic estrogen agonist 
effects. 
Faslodex  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  postmenopausal  women  with  estrogen  receptor  positive, 
locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  for  disease  relapse  on  or  after  adjuvant  anti-estrogen 
therapy, or disease progression on therapy with an anti-estrogen. 
The  recommended  dose  is  500  mg  at  intervals  of  one  month,  with  an  additional  500  mg  dose  given 
two weeks after the initial dose. 
Type of application and aspects on development 
The applied indication was (new text underlined): 
“Faslodex is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive, 
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women: 
• 
not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or 
Assessment report  
EMA/490887/2017  
Page 8/59 
 
 
 
 
• 
for with disease relapse on or after adjuvant anti-estrogen endocrine therapy, or disease 
progression on endocrine therapy with an anti-estrogen.” 
The application for the new indication (endocrine naïve patients) is based on data from two studies: 
• 
• 
a  supportive  Phase  2  study  (Study  D6995C00006):  open-label  study  of  fulvestrant  500  mg 
versus  anastrozole  1  mg  in  205  women  with  advanced  disease  previously  untreated  with 
endocrine therapy or at least a year after completing adjuvant endocrine therapy (FIRST) 
a pivotal Phase 3 study (Study D699BC00001): Randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study 
of fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg in 462 women with hormone receptor-positive 
locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  who  have  not  previously  been  treated  with  any 
hormonal therapy (FALCON) 
Endocrine  therapy  naïve  patients  include  those  who  have  progressed  after  the  management  of  early 
disease that did not include adjuvant endocrine therapy, or patients who may present for the first time 
with advanced disease. 
The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 22 November 2012 on clinical aspects 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/868022/2011) concerning the study population, double-blind design and PFS as 
primary endpoint.   
The proposal to modify ‘anti-estrogen’ to ‘endocrine’ in the second line indication was based on a 
justification based on changes in treatment guidelines and clinical practice, results from the China 
CONFIRM study, the final overall survival (OS) analysis of the CONFIRM study and published literature, 
to supplement existing clinical data from CONFIRM, FINDER1 and FINDER2 in patients who have 
progressed following an AI. 
The recommended indication is: 
Faslodex is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive, 
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women (new text underlined): 
• 
• 
not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or 
for with disease relapse on or after adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy, or disease progression on 
therapy with an anti-estrogen therapy. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application apart from the ERA (see section 
2.2.1), which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated ERA was provided with this procedure. 
As an oestrogen receptor antagonist, the mechanism of action of fulvestrant has potential to affect 
reproduction in aquatic species. In addition, the octanol:water partition coefficient (Log Pow) is >4.5. 
Therefore, although the refined PECsurface water (0.00046 μg/L) is well below the Phase I action limit 
of 0.01 μg/L, a tailored Phase II assessment has been performed to address the potential mode of 
action and bioaccumulation concerns. 
In the Tier A assessment the toxicity of fulvestrant to aquatic and groundwater species as well as 
micro-organisms were assessed. The PEC/PNEC ratios for surface water and groundwater were below 1 
and for microorganisms below 0.1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/490887/2017  
Page 9/59 
 
 
 
 
Fulvestrant cannot be considered readily biodegradable, is poorly water soluble and has been shown to 
adsorb to physical surfaces. The potential for exposure of the terrestrial environment, via sludge 
application to land, could not be excluded. However, the STP simulation test showed that fulvestrant is 
expected to fully degrade and is unlikely to be present in the sewage sludge applied to land. Therefore, 
an assessment of the degradation rate in soil is not necessary as exposure of the terrestrial 
environment is considered to be negligible, and a worst case risk assessment assuming no degradation 
identified no terrestrial risks. 
In the aquatic environment, fulvestrant, and its degradation products, are anticipated to partition into 
aquatic sediments and undergo significant degradation. As such fulvestrant is not anticipated to be 
persistent. 
In Tier B, the toxicity of fulvestrant to sediment dwelling and terrestrial species was assessed. The 
PEC/PNEC ratios for sediment and the terrestrial environment were below 1. The octanol-water 
partition coefficient, Log Pow, is > 4.5, however the measured assessment of bioaccumulation 
potential in fish, BCF <357, demonstrates that fulvestrant is not bioaccumulative. 
In conclusion, the risk to the environment as a consequence of the use of fulvestrant is low. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data has been submitted with this application which is considered acceptable. The 
MAH has submitted an ERA and it was considered acceptable. Based on the data submitted in this 
application, the new indication may lead to an increase in the environmental exposure of fulvestrant. 
However, considering the available ERA data submitted, fulvestrant is not expected to pose a 
significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The risk to the environment as a consequence of the intended new use of fulvestrant is low. No 
subsequent changes to the SmPC have been proposed.

• Patients randomised to receive anastrozole also received placebo to match the fulvestrant schedule 
(injections on Days 0, 14 [±3], 28 [±3] and every 28 [±3] days thereafter). 
Objectives 
Primary: 
To demonstrate the superior progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with fulvestrant 500 
mg versus patients treated with anastrozole 1 mg. 
Secondary: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To compare the overall survival (OS) of patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg versus 
patients treated with anastrozole 1 mg. 
To compare the objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR) and the expected 
duration of response (EDoR) of patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg versus patients 
treated with anastrozole 1 mg. 
To compare the clinical benefit rate (CBR), the duration of clinical benefit (DoCB) and the 
expected duration of clinical benefit (EDoCB) of patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg 
versus patients treated with anastrozole 1 mg. 
To compare the quality of life (QoL) of patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg versus patients 
treated with anastrozole 1 mg. 
To compare the safety and tolerability of fulvestrant 500 mg treatment versus that of 
anastrozole 1 mg treatment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from randomisation until 
objective disease progression (assessed locally by each investigator, as defined by RECIST 1.1), 
surgery or radiotherapy to manage worsening of disease, or death by any cause in the absence of 
progression. 
Key secondary endpoint: Overall Survival (OS) defined as Time from randomisation until death by any 
cause; Overall response rate (ORR) defined as the percentage of subjects with an objective response 
(CR or PR) with measurable disease during the study. 
Other secondary endpoints (not protected for multiplicity): Duration of response, clinical benefit rate 
(CBR= CR, PR or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks), duration of clinical benefit (DoCB); 
expected duration of response (EDoR), expected duration of clinical benefit (EDoCB), Health-related 
Quality of Life (HRQoL). 
Sample size 
Approximately 450 eligible women were planned to be randomised 1:1 to fulvestrant (N=225) or 
anastrozole (N=225) in this study. The sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint of 
PFS, which was to be analysed when approximately 306 PFS events had occurred. If the true PFS 
hazard ratio (HR) for the comparison of fulvestrant vs. anastrozole was 0.69 (likely to correspond to a 
45% prolongation of PFS) the study had 90% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference 
for PFS with a one-sided type 1 error of 2.5% (two-sided 5%). Assuming the median PFS on 
Assessment report  
EMA/490887/2017  
Page 14/59 
 
 
 
 
anastrozole is 13 months, a PFS HR of 0.69 may translate to a median PFS of 18.8 months on 
fulvestrant. The smallest treatment difference that would be statistically significant is PFS HR=0.80 
(which translates to approximately a 3.3-month median difference, assuming proportional hazards and 
an exponential distribution). 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised strictly sequentially, as patients were eligible for randomisation, to 
fulvestrant or anastrozole using a randomisation ratio 1:1.  
Patients were stratified at randomisation based on whether they have: 
1. 
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer  
2.  received prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer or not 
3.  measurable or non-measurable disease. 
Blinding (masking) 
Double-blind, double-dummy.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets defined were Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and Safety analysis set. Efficacy analyses were based 
on the ITT analysis set, which included all randomised patients and compared the treatment groups on 
the basis of randomised treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received. The safety analysis 
set included all patients who received at least 1 dose of randomised treatment, including patients who 
received only placebo (and no active treatment). 
The overall one-sided type I error rate used was 2.5% (two-sided 5%). Only if the primary endpoint 
(PFS) is significant, the key secondary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and objective response rate 
(ORR) were to be tested. A multiple testing procedure to strongly control type-I error at the overall 
alpha level was implemented, and used to test the key secondary endpoints with an alpha-exhaustive 
recycling strategy (Burman et al 2009). With this approach, the endpoints of OS and ORR are tested in 
a pre-defined order using a weighted proportion of alpha (such that initially α=2% is allocated to OS, 
and α=0.5% is allocated to ORR) and alpha that becomes available after each rejected hypothesis is 
recycled to the secondary endpoint not yet rejected. Other secondary endpoints were not included in 
the multiple testing procedure.  
PFS and ORR were to be analysed at one time-point only, when approximately 306 progression events 
have occurred. The date of data cut-off was 11 April 2016.  
An interim analysis of OS was conducted at the same time as the primary analysis of PFS. A more 
mature OS analysis was planned at a later time-point when it is estimated that 50% of patients will 
have died. After this point, the patient's treatment will be unblinded. The false positive rate will be 
controlled amongst the two OS analyses by using the Lan DeMets (Lan and DeMets 1983) spending 
function that approximates an O’Brien Fleming approach. It was estimated in the sample size 
calculation that, in case that 0.7 of the full death information would be available (i.e., 159/225 deaths) 
at the time of the interim OS analysis, the 1-sided significance level to be applied for the OS interim 
analysis would be 0.0054. If the interim OS is statistically significant, then ORR will be assessed using 
Assessment report  
EMA/490887/2017  
Page 15/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
α=0.025 (i.e., the full 2% of alpha used in the OS analysis will be recycled to ORR). If the interim OS is 
not statistically significant, then ORR will be assessed using α=0.005. 
Methods of analysis of the primary endpoint (PFS) and the key secondary endpoints (OS and ORR) are 
presented in the table below.

Progression 
Stratified log-rank test (Primary analysis) with factors for prior chemotherapy 
free survival 
for locally advanced or metastatic disease (yes/no) and measurable disease at 
(PFS) 
baseline (yes/no) was used to analyze the effect of treatment with fulvestrant 
500 mg vs. anastrozole 1 mg. Additional stratification factor (i.e. prior 
chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease) was pre-planned to 
be included in the analysis, but removed due to very low patient numbers 
(including zero cell) in some of the individual strata. Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS 
and time to censoring were presented by treatment group. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Re-run of the primary analysis on the RECIST1.1 defined disease progression or 
death from any cause. 
Cox proportional hazards regression model with treatment and baseline 
prognostic covariates including all three randomization stratification factors, 
receptor status, use of bisphosphonates/denosumab as concomitant medication 
at baseline, geographic region, prior systemic oestrogen containing hormone 
replacement therapy, and visceral disease. 
Re-run of the primary analysis based on the midpoints of the time between 
progression detected and the previous visit. 
Re-run of the primary analysis whereby patients are censored at the time they 
discontinue treatment and/or receive subsequent therapies prior to disease 
progression. 
Subgroup analysis was performed for subgroups defined by the covariates, 
using an unstratified log-rank test including randomized treatment as the only 
factor. A global interaction test was performed to test if overall the treatment 
benefit was consistent across the covariates. This was done by fitting a Cox 
model with treatment and the covariates, and comparing that (at the 10% 
level) with the model with treatment, the covariates and the factor-by-covariate 
interactions. The subgroups, which are also stratification factors, are defined 
using relevant data in the database, and not the strata according to IVRS.

Recruitment 
The first patient enrolled in the study on 17 October 2012 and the last patient enrolled on 11 July 
2014. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendment 
There was 1 protocol amendment to the original CSP with minor changes that was made at the time 
recruitment started. 
Changes to planned analyses: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Pre-unblinding changes to the planned analyses, as described in the CSP and/or in the original 
SAP (Edition 1, dated 28 June 2012), were as follows: 
Inclusion  of  more  geographic  regions  for  subgroup  analysis  of  PFS  and  more  levels  of 
geographic region in the covariate used for the Cox regression sensitivity analysis of PFS. 
Inclusion of visceral disease (yes/no) for subgroup analysis of PFS and as a covariate used for 
the Cox regression sensitivity analysis of PFS. 
Expanded the bisphosphonate use at baseline subgroup to include denosumab use. 
Inclusion of subgroup analysis and Cox regression sensitivity analysis for OS. 
•  Adjustment to the analysis method for PFS by subgroup to an unstratified log-rank test. 
• 
Inclusion of rules for the removal of 1 stratification factor from the analysis models for log-rank 
and logistic regression due to small sub-strata. 
•  Removal of the inferential statistical analysis for other significant AEs of interest (pre-specified 
AEs). 
There was 1 post-unblinding change to the planned analyses, which was as follows: 
• 
Inclusion  of  an  additional sensitivity  analysis  of  PFS,  which  fitted  stratification  factors  derived 
from the eCRF data (rather than the IVRS system). 
Post-hoc sensitivity analyses performed by: 
• 
• 
fitting stratification factors derived from electronic case report form data (rather than on the 
IVRS system), in order to investigate any effect of mis-stratification on the primary endpoint of 
the study, and 
including all 3 randomisation stratification factors (i.e., adding locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer) in the primary statistical model. 
In addition, analyses have been performed to explore if any potential bias was introduced by censoring 
that is both related to outcome and imbalanced between the treatment arms. Multiple imputation was 
performed using a Cox model to impute event times in subjects who were censored early (i.e., at more 
than 12 weeks before the data cut-off for the primary analysis). Imputations were performed in such 
way that:  
• 
the hazard for progression increases after censoring in both arms, suggesting the censoring 
was related to outcome and was not at random, and  
Assessment report  
EMA/490887/2017  
Page 18/59 
 
 
 
 
• 
the hazard increases following censoring in the fulvestrant arm only. 
Protocol deviations 
A larger proportion of patients in the fulvestrant arm had at least 1 important protocol deviation 
compared with the anastrozole arm (45.2% vs 33.6%).   
A higher proportions of patients in the fulvestrant arm than in the anastrozole arm were randomised 
using an incorrect stratification factor (i.e., mis-stratification in 20.0% vs 16.8% of patients) and 
RECIST timing (14.8% vs 9.5% of patients), respectively. 
Mis-stratification was driven by the prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease 
stratum: overall, 47 (10.2%) patients were assigned as having received prior chemotherapy of these, 
the vast majority (45) were actually recorded as having prior chemotherapy for early disease 
(neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant) on the eCRF.  A further 4 (0.9%) patients were assigned as having 
received no prior chemotherapy on the IVRS system, but reported as having received prior 
chemotherapy on the eCRF. 
Although patients were mis-stratified slightly more frequently in the fulvestrant arm (20.0%) relative 
to the anastrozole arm (16.8%), the incidence of discordance between those data captured on the 
IVRS system at randomisation and those captured on the eCRF was similar in both treatment arms 
across all 3 stratification factors.

The analysis was performed using a stratified log-rank test with factors for prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or 
metastatic disease (yes or no) and measurable disease at baseline (yes or no). 
The overall type-I error rate was 2.5% (1-sided).  A 1-sided 2.5% significance level can also be considered equivalent to a 
2-sided 5% significance level (where the treatment effect is in favour of fulvestrant).  In order to aid interpretation of 
results, 2-sided p-values are used to describe statistical significance.

Health Related Quality of Life 
Compliance with patient-reported outcomes instruments (FACT-B) was high while on treatment 
(approximately 85% to 95% over time, in the study overall) and was broadly comparable between 
treatment arms.  However, compliance post treatment (with or without progression) was poor. 
Mean (standard deviation [SDev]) values for FACT-B total score were high and comparable between 
the fulvestrant and anastrozole treatment arms at baseline (102.2 [16.93] and 101.1 [16.84], 
respectively).  Mean FACT-B total score over time was similar in both treatment arms and remained 
high while on treatment.

Design 
D699BC00001 
FALCON  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  international, 
multicenter Phase III study, designed to compare the efficacy and tolerability 
of  fulvestrant  (500  mg)  with  anastrozole  (1  mg)  in  postmenopausal  women 
with  hormone  receptor-positive  (HR  +ve)  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
breast cancer (confirmed by histology), who had not previously been treated 
with any hormonal therapy. Patients were assessed for eligibility for the study 
based on local laboratory results for hormone receptor status. 
To maintain the double-blind, double-dummy design of the trial, each patient 
received both study treatments, 1 of which was placebo.

Treatment 
Fulvestrant (FASLODEX) 500 mg was administered as two 5 ml intramuscular injections on Days 0, 14 
(±3),  28  (±3)  and  every  28  (±3)  days  thereafter  with  time  windows  extending  to  ±7  days  after  24 
weeks. 
Anastrozole (ARIMIDEX) 1 mg was administered orally as a single daily tablet. 
Treatment continued until disease progression as per RECIST, unless any of the criteria for treatment 
discontinuation were met first. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  the  CBR  in  patients  treated  with  fulvestrant  500 mg  with  the 
CBR in patients treated with anastrozole 1 mg.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary end-point was clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as the % of patients in the Full analysis 
set  with  clinical  benefit,  where  clinical  benefit  is  defined  as  complete  response  (CR),  partial  response 
(PR), or stable disease (SD) ≥ 24 weeks, defined by modified RECIST. 
Secondary  endpoints  included  overall  response  rate  (ORR),  Time  to  progression  (TTP),  Duration  of 
Response (DoR), Duration of clinical benefit DoCB, and OS. 
PFS was in this study called TTP, but all events of death, irrespective of causality, were counted as 
events. “TTP” according to the study definition, is therefore called PFS.   
Sample size 
The clinical benefit rate for anastrozole in hormone receptor positive patients is estimated as 60% from 
previous  studies  of  anastrozole  in  the  current  patient  population.  One-hundred  randomised  patients 
per  treatment  group  were  required  to  give  80%  power  to  rule  out  an  absolute  deficiency  of  20%  in 
clinical  benefit  rate  for  fulvestrant  500  mg;  i.e.,  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval  to  exclude  a  20% 
deficiency. 
The data cut-off for primary analysis was 10 January 2008.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  application  for  the  new  indication  (endocrine  naïve  patients)  is  based  on  data  from  one  pivotal 
study (FALCON) and one supportive study (FIRST). 
The pivotal study FALCON was a double blind study conducted in the target population for the 
proposed new indication and the overall design is considered adequate. The chosen randomisation 
stratification factors are considered to be important prognostic covariates. The statistical methods 
described are endorsed. Exclusion of the stratification factor “prior chemotherapy for locally advanced 
or metastatic disease” was justified by very low patient numbers (including zero cell) in some of the 
individual strata.  
Important protocol deviations were common, but mis-stratification did not result in imbalances of 
importance. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken using the stratification factors recorded on the eCRF 
rather than on the IVRS system and showed an HR for PFS consistent with the primary endpoint. No 
information is available on the root cause of the errors in the stratification procedure which affected as 
many as 85 subjects. Nevertheless, these deviations are considered unlikely to affect the robustness of 
the study.  
With regards to baseline characteristics in study FALCON, about 30% of patients had received no prior 
endocrine therapy despite being diagnosed >1 year prior to study enrolment which is unexpected. 
Otherwise, baseline characteristics essentially look as expected. There were some differences noted 
with regards to baseline demographic and tumour characteristics. Notably, a larger proportion of 
patients in the fulvestrant arm than in the anastrozole arm had visceral disease (58.7% vs. 51.3%). A 
slightly larger proportion of patients in the fulvestrant arm had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy 
compared with the anastrozole arm (15.2% and 11.6%, respectively). These small differences are not 
Assessment report  
EMA/490887/2017  
Page 38/59 
 
 
 
 
 
meaningful and baseline and tumour characteristics are considered balanced between the two 
treatment arms. 
Although the median time from completion of final chemotherapy to randomisation was longer in the 
fulvestrant arm (12.8 months; range: 1 to 283 months) than in the anastrozole arm (5.7 months; 
range: 1 to 207 months), other summary statistics were broadly comparable. Furthermore, a box and 
whisker plot of time from completion of chemotherapy to randomisation showed no clear evidence that 
the patients receiving chemotherapy on the fulvestrant 500 mg arm completed earlier than those on 
the anastrozole 1 mg arm (data not shown). Therefore these imbalances might be due to chance. 
Study FIRST was an open label, anastrozole comparative exploratory study. The study was conducted 
open-label  with  investigator  assessed  PFS  complemented  with  independent  review.  HER2  positive 
patients  could  be  enrolled  (20%)  and  patients  could  have  received  (neo)adjuvant  endocrine  therapy 
(25%).  Approximately  27%  of  patients  in  the  fulvestrant  arm  and  22%  in  the  anastrozole  arm  had 
received  prior  “endocrine  therapy”  which  was  completed  at  least  12  months  prior  to  randomization, 
i.e.,  were  not  “endocrine  naïve”  patients.  Nearly  all  of  them  had  received  tamoxifen  (28  patients  in 
fulvestrant  arm  and  22  patients  in  anastrozole  arm)  and  one  subject  in  each  arm  had  received  prior 
anastrozole.  
This phase II study is considered to provide reasonably strong supportive evidence to FALCON for the 
applied first line indication. At the time of the primary data cut-off, 36% of patients had progressed. A 
follow-up analysis was performed when approximately 75% of patients had failed therapy to provide a 
more complete assessment. The results of secondary analysis for TTP adjusted for baseline covariates 
were consistent with the main unadjusted analysis of TTP. This suggested that the imbalance between 
treatment groups in the proportion of patients with visceral disease at baseline in FIRST did not impact 
the efficacy findings.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study FALCON, more progression events occurred in the anastrozole arm (166 patients [71.6%]) 
than in the fulvestrant arm (143 patients [62.2%], 2-sided p=0.0486). At an event rate of 60% to 
70%, the PFS HR of 0.797 (95% CI 0.637 to 0.999) is likely to be stable. The median difference, 3 
months, appears to reflect the HR and is considered non-trivial. Fulvestrant was statistically borderline 
superior to anastrozole.  
A number of sensitivity analyses were undertaken, all showing borderline “positive/negative 
significance”, the “worst” being p=0.06 (using stratification derived from CRF), the “best” a Cox 
proportional hazard being p=0.03. The results of the sensitivity analyses support the primary PFS 
result and its robustness. 
Overall, the results indicate a more favourable outcome with fulvestrant compared to anastrozole in 
ER+, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women not previously treated 
with endocrine therapy, and support the currently applied indication. Consistent results were observed 
across the majority of pre-specified patient subgroups. Many of the subgroups analysed were small in 
size and consequently resulted in wide confidence intervals. However, in patients with visceral disease 
at baseline, the benefit of fulvestrant over anastrozole was not evident, with median PFS 13.8 months 
vs. 15.9 months (HR 0.993). The subgroup results have been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Approximately 10% of the patients did not have complete data for the primary endpoint of PFS. A 
greater proportion of patients were censored for progression at >12 weeks before data cut-off in the 
fulvestrant arm compared with the anastrozole arm (27 [11.7%] patients vs. 20 [8.6%] patients, 
respectively). The MAH performed a range of analyses to explore the sensitivity of results to the

standard non-informative censoring assumption underlying time to event analyses. Baseline 
characteristics were compared between early and late censored patients and patients who had 
progressed, and modelling was conducted to impute progression times which relax the non-informative 
censoring assumption and assess the impact on treatment effect estimates. Overall, it is considered 
unlikely that the reasons for early censoring differ between the arms, resulting in a biased PFS result. 
In terms of ORR and CBR, rather similar results to anastrozole were observed between fulvestrant and 
anastrozole. Due to the similarity in ORR, duration of response is considered informative (Median DOR 
20 months and 13.2 months in the fulvestrant arm and anastrozole arm respectively). These 
observations i.e. similar ORR and difference in PFS are compatible with delayed resistance 
development and is mechanistically plausible as fulvestrant has been reported to be less affected by 
activating ER mutations (Fribbens et al 2016; Spoerke et al 2016; Toy et al 2016), but serum samples 
were not collected on study for analyses of activating ER mutations. OS results are immature.       
Regarding QoL data, data after progression are sparse, reducing the possibility to detect symptomatic 
differences related to progression, but in principle the curves mimic PFS curves. The HR for time to 
deterioration favoured Faslodex (0.84, p=0.16 not protected from multiplicity). Overall, available 
FACT-B data do not indicate any differences in tolerability between fulvestrant and anastrozole.  
Results from the FALCON study are supported by the results of study FIRST which met its primary non-
inferiority objective in terms of Clinical Benefit response (CBR). The primary efficacy results of clinical 
benefit ratio (CBR) from the FAS and PP populations supported the non-inferiority of fulvestrant 
compared to anastrozole in treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive 
advanced breast cancer. The results (CBR of 72.5% in fulvestrant group vs 67% in the anastrozole 
group) are considered supportive for the applied indication. After exclusion of patients that were 
endocrine therapy naïve, the results remained stable and compatible with statistical borderline 
superiority to anastrozole in terms of PFS and OS. The results in the subgroup of FIRST constructed in 
order to reflect the target population in FALCON were similar to the ITT population, but more 
favourable compared with FALCON. 
In the subgroup analysis of OS, a tendency towards fulvestrant having greater benefit in patients 
without visceral disease vs. those with visceral disease was observed, which is in line with observations 
in the FALCON study.    
In support of the extension of the existing second line indication to AI-resistant patients (i.e. from 
relapse or progression on anti-oestrogen therapy to relapse or progression on endocrine therapy), the 
MAH submitted a justification based on changes in treatment guidelines and clinical practice, results 
from the China CONFIRM study, the final overall survival (OS) analysis of the CONFIRM study and 
published literature, to supplement existing clinical data from CONFIRM, FINDER1 and FINDER2 in 
patients who have progressed following an AI. Out of the trials, CONFIRM, FINDER1 and FINDER2 have 
been assessed previously in attempt to extend the current indication to AI-resistant patients in 2010. 
In this type II variation in 2010 (EMEA/H/C/540/II/0018), based on the CONFIRM study, the MAH 
sought for extension of the indication for disease relapse or disease progression on therapy with an 
anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. At the time the CHMP concluded that a favourable benefit – risk 
balance had not been convincingly demonstrated for fulvestrant 500 mg in patients resistant to 
aromatase inhibitors. As part of the current application, the MAH has not provided any new data in 
postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
for disease relapse on or after adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy, or disease progression on therapy 
with an aromatase inhibitor. Neither the FALCON nor the FIRST studies include clinical data on these 
patients. Overall, the level of evidence available regarding the efficacy of fulvestrant in aromatase 
inhibitor (AI)-resistant postmenopausal ER+ locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients is 
not considered sufficient to support and extension of the second line indication.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Faslodex showed an improvement in PFS and duration of response as compared to anastrazole in 
postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer (confirmed by histology), who had not previously been treated with any hormonal therapy. The 
results from the exploratory phase II FIRST study are consistent with the results from the Phase III 
FALCON study and support the new first line indication. The SmPC has been updated in section 5.1 
with efficacy data in the first line indication.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Faslodex (fulvestrant) was approved in EU in 2004 for the treatment of breast cancer after failure on 
anti-oestrogen therapy. Apart from anti-oestrogen effects, the safety profile includes injection site 
reaction, hepatic events, rash and hypersensitivity reactions.  
Patient exposure 
FALCON included safety data from 228 patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg (median exposure: 
14.8 months) and 232 patients treated with anastrozole 1 mg (median exposure: 13.8 months).  In 
addition to this, 101 patients were treated with fulvestrant 500 mg in FIRST (median exposure at the 
primary data cut-off: 9.2 months). 
As of 25 April 2016, it is estimated that >3500 subjects have been exposed to fulvestrant in clinical 
trials.  In the post-marketing setting there are 344,450 patient years of exposure for the 250 mg dose 
and 211,462 patient years for the 500 mg dose globally.

In the FALCON study, the number of patients who reported an adverse reaction of joint and 
musculoskeletal pain was 65 (31.2%) and 48 (24.1%) for fulvestrant and anastrozole arms, 
respectively. Of the 65 patients in the Faslodex arm, 40% (26/65) of patients reported joint and 
musculoskeletal pain within the first month of treatment, and 66.2% (43/65) of patients within the 
first 3 months of treatment. No patients reported events that were CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 or that required a 
dose reduction, dose interruption, or discontinued treatment due to these adverse reactions.

Adverse drug reactions 
The frequency categories for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were calculated based on the Faslodex 
500 mg treatment group in pooled safety analyses of studies that compared Faslodex 500 mg with 
Faslodex 250 mg [CONFIRM (Study D6997C00002), FINDER 1 (Study D6997C00004), FINDER 2 
(Study D6997C00006), and NEWEST (Study D6997C00003) studies], or from FALCON (Study 
D699BC00001) alone that compared Faslodex 500 mg with anastrozole 1 mg. Where frequencies differ 
between the pooled safety analysis and FALCON, the highest frequency is presented. The frequencies 
in the following table were based on all reported adverse drug reactions, regardless of the investigator 
assessment of causality.

a The event was not observed in major clinical studies (CONFIRM, FINDER 1, FINDER 2, NEWEST). The 
frequency has been calculated using the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the point 
estimate. This is calculated as 3/560 (where 560 is the number of patients in the major clinical 
studies), which equates to a frequency category of ‘uncommon’. 
b The event was not observed in FALCON, incidence is therefore presented for pooled safety analyses

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of fulvestrant in clinical use has been investigated in clinical trials as well as in the post-
marketing experience (344450 patient years of fulvestrant 250 mg/month and 211462 patient years of 
fulvestrant 500 mg/month exposure). The data submitted includes a further 281 + 77 patient years of 
fulvestrant 500 mg/month exposure. 
The incidence of AEs was not significantly different between the two treatment arms in both studies. In 
the FALCON study there were more patients with treatment related AEs in the fulvestrant arm 
compared to the anastrozole arm (39.9% [91/228] vs. 32.8% [76/232], respectively). In the FIRST 
study there were more patients reporting an AE of CTC Grade 3 or higher in the fulvestrant arm 
compared to the anastrozole arm (17.8% [18/101] vs. 10.7% [11/103], respectively). 
In  FIRST  study,  bone  pain,  nausea,  constipation,  vomiting,  and  hypertension  were  more  common  in 
patients  receiving  fulvestrant  while  there  were  more  cases  of  hot  flushes  and  myalgia  in  the 
anastrozole group. 
There were more cases of back pain, myalgia, and pain in extremity in patients receiving fulvestrant in 
FALCON  while  hypertension  and  anaemia  were  reported  more  frequently  from  patients  taking 
anastrozole.  In  FIRST  study  hypertension  was  more  common  in  the  fulvestrant  group  and  myalgia  in 
the anastrozole group. 
Whether there is an increase in arthralgia and related events or not related to fulvestrant was 
discussed in the past. At the time partly conflicting data led to these events not being categorised as 
adverse reaction. It is well known that anastrozole is associated with these events and the numerical 
increase makes it clear that it should be reflected in the SmPC also for fulvestrant. Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC has been updated to include information about joint and musculoskeletal pain. 
Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  were  more  common  in  the  fulvestrant  group  compared  to 
anastrozole group. The difference was driven mainly by rash, alopecia, dry skin, and erythema. 
Only single cases of death not caused by progression of breast cancer were reported for patients 
receiving either fulvestrant or anastrozole. Overall, mortality rate was lower in the fulvestrant group 
compared to anastrozole group (29.4% vs. 32.3% at the DLP of FALCON). 
Serious adverse events involving patients in the fulvestrant group are known from earlier clinical use 
and not unexpected. 
Haematological abnormalities as well as hepatic enzyme and bilirubin elevations were reported at 
similar rates from both treatment arms in FALCON. Anaemia was more common in patients taking 
anastrozole. No changes to the SmPC are required with regards to the laboratory parameter 
abnormalities. 
More patients discontinued fulvestrant. Nevertheless discontinuation rates were observed at an 
acceptable level.

Cases of overdose reported in patients taking FASLODEX was identified as a subject for review while 
analysing FALCON data (one case of overdose was reported, not associated with any other AEs). 
AstraZeneca global database retrieved 48 cases of overdose in which majority of events were 
inconsistent with the signal being evaluated, had limited information and had no adverse event 
associated with it. Section 4.9 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect that there are isolated reports 
of overdose with Faslodex in humans. If overdose occurs, symptomatic supportive treatment is 
recommended. 
The RMP is considered adequate and no new safety concerns were included. However missing 
information “Use during pregnancy and lactation” and “Use in women of childbearing potential” were 
merged into “Reprotoxicity (fertility, pregnancy and lactation)” and upgraded to important potential 
risk based on available data. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The overall safety has remained unchanged and there were no new safety signals raised from the two 
studies presented. Joint and musculoskeletal pain are relatively well known adverse drug reactions of 
anti-oestrogen therapy and the SmPC has been updated to reflect these. The frequency category of 
several adverse drug reactions has also been updated in line with the incidence reported in the pooled 
dataset and FALCON study (see SmPC section 4.8).  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.8, 4.9, and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. Additional minor changes were made to sections 4.4, 5.2 and 5.3. The Package Leaflet has 
been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and 
do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The disease treated is estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in 
postmenopausal women not previously treated with endocrine therapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment guidelines emphasise the preferential use of endocrine therapy in postmenopausal 
women with HR+ advanced breast cancer, and recommend that chemotherapy should be reserved for 
cases of rapidly progressive disease or proven endocrine resistance (Cardoso et al 2014).  
The choice of first-line endocrine therapy for HR+ advanced breast cancer depends on the type and 
length of therapy received in the adjuvant setting (if any). The endocrine therapy options include, but 
are not limited to, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM; e.g. tamoxifen), estrogen receptor 
antagonists (e.g. fulvestrant), selective non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI; e.g. anastrozole and 
letrozole) and steroidal aromatase inhibitors (e.g. exemestane) (ESMO Guideline; NCCN Breast Cancer, 
Version 2.2017). These agents may be given in first, second or later lines of therapy for advanced 
breast cancer (ESMO Guideline; NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology). Fulvestrant is currently 
authorised for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer in postmenopausal women with disease relapse on or after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or 
disease progression on antiestrogen therapy. Combination therapies with other agents are also 
therapeutic options such as exemestane with everolimus, palbociclib with fulvestrant/an aromatase 
inhibitor (NCCN, Breast Cancer, Version 2.2017). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The application for the new indication in endocrine naïve patients is based on data from two studies: 
• 
a  supportive  Phase  2  study  (Study  D6995C00006):  open-label  study  of  fulvestrant  500  mg 
versus  anastrozole  1  mg  in  205  women  with  advanced  disease  previously  untreated  with 
endocrine therapy or at least a year after completing adjuvant endocrine therapy (FIRST) 
Assessment report  
EMA/490887/2017 
Page 55/59 
 
 
  
• 
a pivotal Phase 3 study (Study D699BC00001): Randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study 
of fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg in 462 women with hormone receptor-positive 
locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  who  have  not  previously  been  treated  with  any 
hormonal therapy (FALCON) 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study FALCON (n=230 + 232) showed borderline significant superiority in terms of PFS (HR 0.797, 
p=0.0486, sensitivity analyses 0.03 – 0.06, medians 16.6 months vs. 13.8 months). The odds ratio for 
ORR is close to 1 which indicated similarity between the treatments. OS data are immature at event 
rates of about 30% (HR 0.875). Median DoR was longer in the fulvestrant arm (20.0 months) 
compared with the anastrozole arm (13.2 months). The overall data are compatible with a possible 
delay in the development of resistance of response compared with anastrozole. 
The FIRST study (n=102 + 103) met its primary non-inferiority objective in terms of Clinical Benefit 
response (CBR): CBR of 72.5% in fulvestrant group vs 67% in the anastrozole group; Odds ratio 1.302  
(0.717, 2.380), p-value: 0.386. This was supported by the secondary endpoints PFS (HR 0.7, p=0.01) 
and OS (HR 0.7, p=0.04, medians 54 vs. 48 m.). ORR similar and data are again compatible with 
delayed development of secondary resistance compared with anastrozole. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the FALCON study, the superiority of Faslodex over AI seemed to be lost in the subgroup of patients 
with ER+ breast cancer with visceral metastases (PFS HR 0.99). No satisfactory explanation has been 
identified and the results in these subgroups have been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The objectives of FALCON did not include cross-over and PFS2 data were not collected. Thus the 
possible importance of the sequence of therapy cannot be assessed. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Fulvestrant has been approved for 12 years and the safety is considered reasonably well described. No 
new ADRs were observed in the clinical studies submitted with the application. The most common 
adverse drug reactions are hypersensitivity reactions, hot flushes, nausea, elevated hepatic enzymes, 
rash, joint and musculoskeletal pain, asthenia, and injection site reactions. In FALCON, the expected 
increase in joint and musculoskeletal pain was confirmed and the SmPC has been updated accordingly.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There were no new uncertainties about the unfavourable effects.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The prolonged PFS of approximately 3 months observed in the FALCON (and FIRST) study is of a 
magnitude that is considered meaningful.   
The safety of fulvestrant has not changed and the ADRs are as expected and can be managed 
successfully by the recommendations in the SmPC and by PhV monitoring.  The SmPC has been 
updated with the new ADR frequencies.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, the benefits of fulvestrant outweigh the risks in the treatment of postmenopausal women with 
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior endocrine therapy.   
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Regarding  the  extension  of  the  currently  approved  indication  (second  line  after  “anti-oestrogen 
therapy” to be extended to second line after “endocrine therapy”), the MAH has submitted insufficient 
evidence  to  change  the  conclusions  from  the  previous  variation  (EMEA/H/C/540/II/0018),  and 
therefore  the  proposed  extension  of  the  already  approved  indication  is  not  considered  sufficiently 
justified.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Faslodex is positive in the treatment of postmenopausal women with locally 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior endocrine therapy. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

Extension of indication to include the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women who have not been previously treated with 
endocrine therapy. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8, 4.9, and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated in order 
to update the safety and efficacy information. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

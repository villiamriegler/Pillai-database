White to light yellow opaque aqueous gel.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Mirvaso is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of facial erythema of rosacea in adult patients.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
One application per 24 hours, at any time suitable for the patient, for as long as facial erythema is 
present.
The maximum daily recommended dose is 1 g of gel in total weight, which corresponds to 
approximately five pea sized amounts.
Treatment should be initiated with a smaller amount of gel (less than the maximum) for at least one 
week. The amount of gel can then be increased gradually based on tolerability and patient response. 
Special populations
Elderly patients
The experience of use of Mirvaso in patients aged above 65 years is limited (see also section 4.8). No 
dose adjustment is necessary.
Hepatic and renal impairment
Mirvaso has not been studied in patients with hepatic and renal impairment.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Mirvaso in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available.
2
Mirvaso is contraindicated in children aged less than 2 years because of serious systemic safety risk 
(see section 4.3). Safety concerns related to the systemic absorption of brimonidine have also been 
identified for the age group 2 to 12 years (see section 4.9). Mirvaso should not be used in children or 
adolescents aged 2 to 18 years.
Method of administration
Cutaneous use only.
Mirvaso should be applied smoothly and evenly as a thin layer across the entire face (forehead, chin, 
nose and both cheeks) avoiding the eyes, eyelids, lips, mouth and membrane of the inner nose.
Mirvaso should be applied only to the face.
Hands should be washed immediately after applying the medicinal product.
Mirvaso can be used in conjunction with other cutaneous medicinal products for the treatment 
of inflammatory lesions of rosacea and with cosmetics. These products should not be applied 
immediately before the daily application of Mirvaso; they may be used only after the applied 
Mirvaso has dried.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Children aged less than 2 years.
Patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy (for example selegiline or 
moclobemide) and patients on tricyclic (such as imipramine) or tetracyclic (such as maprotiline, 
mianserin or mirtazapin) antidepressants which affect noradrenergic transmission.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Mirvaso should not be applied on irritated skin (including following laser therapy) or open wounds. 
In case of severe irritation or contact allergy, the treatment with the medicinal product should be 
discontinued.
Exacerbation of rosacea symptoms is very common in patients treated with Mirvaso. Across all 
clinical studies, 16% of patients receiving Mirvaso experienced an event of symptom exacerbation. 
Treatment should be initiated with a small amount of gel and the dose increased gradually, based on 
tolerability and response to treatment (see section 4.2).
Erythema and flushing
The effect of Mirvaso topical gel begins to diminish hours after application. In some patients, 
erythema and flushing were reported to return with greater severity than was present at baseline. Most 
of the cases were observed within the first 2 weeks of starting the treatment (see section 4.8).
The onset of flushing relative to application of Mirvaso topical gel varied, ranging from 
approximately 30 minutes to several hours (see section 4.8).
In the majority of these cases, erythema and flushing resolved after discontinuation of 
Mirvaso topical gel.
In case worsening of erythema occurs, Mirvaso topical gel should be discontinued. Symptomatic 
measures, such as cooling, NSAID and antihistamines, may help in alleviating symptoms.
Recurrences of aggravated erythema and flushing have been reported after re-administration of 
Mirvaso topical gel. Prior to resuming treatment after temporary discontinuation due to aggravated 
3
erythema or flushing, perform a test application on a small area of the face for at least one day before 
full facial application is resumed.
It is important to inform the patient not to exceed the recommended maximum dose (5 pea size 
amounts) and frequency of application (once daily).
Mirvaso should not be applied close to the eyes.
Concomitant use of other systemic alpha adrenergic receptor agonists
The concomitant use of other systemic alpha adrenergic receptor agonists may potentiate the 
undesirable effects of this class of medicinal products in patients:
-
-
with severe or unstable or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease;
with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud’s phenomenon, orthostatic 
hypotension, thrombangiitis obliterans, scleroderma, or Sjögren’s syndrome.
Other
Any increase in the daily amount applied above 5 pea sized amounts and/or increase in frequency of 
daily application of the medicinal product should be avoided, since the safety of higher daily doses or 
repeated daily application has not been assessed.
One gram of gel contains 1 mg methylparahydroxybenzoate (E218) which may cause allergic reactions 
(possibly delayed). This medicine also contains 55 mg propylene glycol (E1520) in each gram which 
is equivalent to 5.5% w/w, it may cause skin irritation.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
Mirvaso is contraindicated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy 
and patients on tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants which affect noradrenergic transmission 
(see section 4.3).
The possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with central nervous system depressants 
(alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anaesthetics) should be considered.
No data on the level of circulating catecholamines after Mirvaso administration are available. Caution, 
however, is advised in patients taking substances which can affect the metabolism and uptake of 
circulating amines e.g. chlorpromazine, methylphenidate, reserpine.
Caution is advised when initiating (or changing the dose of) a concomitant systemic substance 
(irrespective of pharmaceutical form) which may interact with alpha adrenergic receptor agonists or 
interfere with their activity i.e. agonists or antagonists of the adrenergic receptor e.g. (isoprenaline, 
prazosin).
Brimonidine may cause clinically insignificant decreases in blood pressure in some patients. Caution 
is therefore advised when using medicinal products such as anti-hypertensives and/or cardiac 
glycosides concomitantly with brimonidine.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of brimonidine in pregnant women. Animal 
studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Mirvaso during 
pregnancy.
4
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether brimonidine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Mirvaso should not be used during breast-feeding.
Fertility
Brimonidine did not present any special reproductive or developmental hazard in animal species.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Mirvaso has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are erythema, pruritus, flushing and skin burning 
sensation, all occurring in 1.2 to 3.3% of patients in clinical studies. They are typically mild to 
moderate in severity, and usually do not require discontinuation of treatment. Aggravated erythema, 
flushing and skin burning sensation have been reported during the post-marketing period (see 
section 4.4).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The adverse reactions are classified by System Organ Class and frequency, using the following 
convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), 
rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data) and were reported with Mirvaso either in clinical studies, or during the post-marketing 
experience (identified by an asterix (*) in Table 1).

have been reported, some of which required hospitalisation. Some cases involved application of 
Mirvaso following laser procedures (see section 4.4).
5
Other special populations
Elderly patients
No meaningful differences in the safety profiles were observed between the elderly subject population 
and subjects 18 to 65 years of age.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. 
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Overdoses after oral use of other alpha2-agonists have been reported to cause symptoms such as 
hypotension, asthenia, vomiting, lethargy, sedation, bradycardia, arrhythmias, miosis, apnoea, 
hypotonia, hypothermia, respiratory depression and seizure.
Treatment of an oral overdose includes supportive and symptomatic therapy; a patent airway should 
be maintained.
Paediatric population
Serious adverse reactions following inadvertent ingestion of Mirvaso by two young children of one 
clinical study subject have been reported. The children experienced symptoms consistent with 
previously reported oral overdoses of alpha2-agonist in young children. Both children were reported 
to have made a full recovery within 24 hours.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other dermatological preparations, Other dermatologicals, 
ATC code: D11AX21.
Mechanism of action
Brimonidine is a highly selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist that is 1000-fold more selective 
for the alpha2-adrenergic receptor than the alpha1-adrenergic receptor.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Cutaneous facial application of a highly selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist reduces erythema 
through direct cutaneous vasoconstriction.
Clinical efficacy and safety
The efficacy of Mirvaso in the treatment of moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea has been 
demonstrated in two randomised, vehicle controlled blinded clinical trials, which were identical in 
design. Moderate to severe erythema was defined as a grade 3 or greater on both the Clinician 
Erythema Assessment (CEA) scale and Patient Self-Assessment (PSA) scale. The studies were 
conducted in 553 randomised subjects aged 18 years and older who were treated once daily 
for 4 weeks with either Mirvaso or vehicle. Of these, 539 completed 29 days of treatment and had data 
available to be included in the efficacy analysis at Day 29, with the majority being Caucasians 
between 18 and 65 years of age.
The primary endpoint was expressed in terms of composite success i.e. subjects responding with 
a 2-grade reduction on both baseline CEA score and baseline PSA score on Day 29. The results from 
both clinical studies demonstrated that Mirvaso was significantly more effective (p<0.001) in the 
reduction of facial erythema of rosacea than vehicle gel when applied once daily for 29 days (primary 
endpoint, see Table 2). For the population subset of patients with severe erythema at baseline 
6
Day 1 (i.e. subjects with CEA or PSA grade of 4) which represented 26% of the randomised subjects, 
the results on the primary endpoint on Day 29 were similar to those results observed in the overall 
population (see Table 3) and were statistically significant for both studies combined (p=0.003). In 
addition, for the overall population, Mirvaso demonstrated statistical superiority (p<0.001) over 
vehicle gel with respect to rapid initial onset of a clinically meaningful effect (1-Grade Composite 
Success for CEA and PSA) after the first application at 30 minutes on Day 1(secondary 
endpoint 27.9% vs. 6.9% for Study 1, 28.4% vs. 4.8% for Study 2), and to achievement of a clinically 
meaningful effect (1-Grade Composite Success for CEA and PSA) on Day 29 (tertiary endpoint, see 
Table 4).
CEA and PSA were defined as follows:
CEA: Clinician Erythema Assessment: 0=Clear skin with no signs of erythema, 1=Almost clear; slight 
redness, 2=Mild erythema; definite redness, 3=Moderate erythema+ marked redness and 4=Severe 
erythema+ fiery redness
PSA: Patient Self-Assessment: 0=No redness, 1=Very mild redness, 2=Mild redness, 3=Moderate 
redness and 4=Severe redness

No clinically meaningful trends with respect to tachyphylaxis or rebound effects (worsening of 
baseline erythema after cessation of treatment) were observed with use of Mirvaso for 29 days.
The results from a long term open label study in 449 patients, with continuous treatment for up to one 
year, confirmed that chronic use of Mirvaso is safe and effective. Daily reductions in erythema for the 
7
first month of use (as measured with the CEA and PSA scales) were similar to those observed in the 
controlled trials, and those reductions were achievable for up to 12 months with no apparent loss 
of effect over time. The overall frequencies of adverse reactions in this study are reflected in 
Table 1 above, with the highest rates occurring in the first 29 days of use. No adverse reactions 
had an increase in frequency over time, and there was no evidence that long-term use of 
Mirvaso conveyed an increased risk of occurrence of any specific type of adverse reaction.
Concomitant use of Mirvaso with other medicinal products for the treatment of inflammatory lesions 
of rosacea has not been systematically investigated. However, in the long term open label study, the 
efficacy and safety of Mirvaso, as described above, was not affected by the concomitant use of 
cosmetics or other medicinal products (e.g. topical metronidazole, topical azelaic acid, and oral 
tetracyclines including low dose doxycycline) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea 
in the concerned subpopulation (131/449 patients in the study used concomitant rosacea medicinal 
product).
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Mirvaso in all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of rosacea (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
The absorption of brimonidine from Mirvaso was evaluated in a clinical study in 24 adult subjects 
with facial erythema of rosacea. All enrolled subjects received a single-day ocular administration of 
a 0.2% eye drops solution of brimonidine followed by a once daily cutaneous application of Mirvaso 
for 29 days (intra-individual comparison of systemic exposure). On Day 1 of the study, all subjects 
received 1 drop of the 0.2% eye drops solution in each eye, every 8 hours over a 24-hour period 
(3 doses in total).
After repeated cutaneous application of Mirvaso on facial skin, no drug accumulation in plasma was 
observed throughout the treatment duration: the highest mean (± standard deviation) plasma maximum 
concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24hr) 
were 46 ± 62 pg/mL and 417 ± 264 pg.hr/mL respectively. These levels are significantly lower 
(2-fold) than those observed following single-day ocular administration of a 0.2% eye drops solution 
of brimonidine.
Distribution
The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied.
Biotransformation
Brimonidine is extensively metabolised by the liver.
Elimination
Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Mirvaso is and what it is used for
Mirvaso contains the active substance brimonidine which belongs to a group of medicines commonly 
referred to as “alpha agonists”.
It is applied to the skin of the face to treat redness due to rosacea in adult patients.
Redness of the face due to rosacea is caused by high levels of blood flow in the facial skin, which is 
the result of enlargement (dilation) of the small blood vessels of the skin.
When applied, Mirvaso acts to narrow these blood vessels again which reduces the excess blood flow 
and redness.
2. What you need to know before you use Mirvaso
Do not use Mirvaso:
-
-
-
if you are allergic to brimonidine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
in children below 2 years of age, as they may be at greater risk of side effects from any of the 
medicine absorbed through the skin.
if you are taking certain medicines used for depression or Parkinson’s disease including 
so-called monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (for example selegiline or moclobemide)
or tricyclic antidepressants (such as imipramine) or tetracyclic antidepressants (such as 
maprotiline, mianserin or mirtazapin). Use of Mirvaso when taking these medicines may result 
in a fall in blood pressure.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist, before using Mirvaso especially if:
-
-
the skin of your face is irritated or has open wounds.
you have problems with your heart or your blood circulation.
23
-
-
-
you have depression, decreased blood flow to the brain or the heart, fall in blood pressure on 
standing up, decreased blood flow to the hands, feet or skin, or Sjögren’s syndrome (a chronic 
disease in which the body’s natural defence - the immune system - attacks the 
moisture-producing glands).
you have kidney or liver problems or have had them in the past.
you have had, or plan to have any laser procedure on the skin of your face.
It is important to start treatment with a small amount of gel, increase the dose gradually but do not 
exceed the maximum dose of 1 gram (approximately 5 pea sized amounts). See also instructions ‘How 
to use Mirvaso’.
Do not apply Mirvaso more than once a day and do not exceed the maximum daily dose of 1gram
(approximately 5 pea sized amounts). See also instructions ‘How to use Mirvaso’.
Worsening of skin redness, flushing or burning feeling of the skin
Up to 1 in 6 patients experience the return of their redness worse than it was initially. Such worsening 
of redness usually develops within the first 2 weeks of treatment with Mirvaso. Generally, it resolves 
spontaneously after treatment is stopped. The effect should gradually disappear within a few days in 
most cases. Before you restart the treatment with Mirvaso, test it on a small area of the face on a day 
when you can stay at home. If you do not experience worsening of redness or burning, continue with 
the usual treatment (see section 3).
In case of worsening or unexpected redness, discontinue the treatment and contact your doctor.
If any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor since this medicine may not be suitable for you.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the safety and 
efficacy has not been established for this age group. This is particularly important in children under 
the age of 2 years (see ‘Do not use Mirvaso’).
Other medicines and Mirvaso
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, because these medicines could affect your treatment with Mirvaso or Mirvaso could affect 
your treatment with these medicines.
Do not take Mirvaso with selegiline, moclobemide, imipramine, mianserin, or maprotiline, which are 
medicines that can be used for depression or Parkinson’s disease, as this could lead to a change in the 
effectiveness of Mirvaso or could increase the chances for side effects such as a fall in blood pressure 
(see under ‘Do not use Mirvaso’).
Also, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines:
-
-
medicines used for the treatment of pain, sleep disorders, or anxiety disorders
medicines used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders (chlorpromazine) or used for 
hyperactivity (methylphenidate) or used for high blood pressure (reserpine).
medicines which act on the same body mechanism as Mirvaso (other alpha agonists, e.g. 
clonidine; so-called alpha blockers or alpha antagonists, e.g. prazosin, isoprenaline which are 
most often used for treatment of high blood pressure, slow heart rate or asthma).
cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin), used to treat heart problems.
blood pressure lowering medicine such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers (e.g. 
propranolol, amlodipine).
-
-
-
If any of the above applies to you, or if you are unsure, talk to your doctor.

How to use Mirvaso
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.
Important: Mirvaso is intended for adults and only for use on the skin of the face. Do not use this 
medicine on other parts of your body, especially moist body surfaces, e.g. your eyes, mouth, nose or 
vagina.
Do not swallow.
Keep Mirvaso gel away from children.
How to use Mirvaso
Mirvaso is recommended to be applied to the face once a day only.
During the first week, start the treatment with a small amount of gel (a pea-sized amount) as explained 
by your doctor or nurse. 
If your symptoms remain the same or improve only slightly, you may then gradually increase the 
amount of gel. Spread it smoothly and evenly as a very thin layer as directed by your doctor or nurse. 
It is important not to exceed the maximum daily dose of 1gram (5 pea sized amounts applied to the 
whole face).
You should wash your hands immediately after applying this medicine.
If your symptoms worsen during treatment with Mirvaso (increased redness, or burning), stop 
treatment and make an appointment to see your doctor – see also section 2 under `Warnings and 
precautions’.
You must avoid the eyes, eyelids, lips, mouth, and the inside of the nose. Should any gel get onto these 
areas, wash them immediately with plenty of water. If you experience worsening of redness or burning 
you should stop using Mirvaso and contact your doctor if needed.
Do not apply any other skin medicines or cosmetics immediately before the daily application of 
Mirvaso. You should use these products only after the applied Mirvaso has dried.
Pay attention when opening the tube / pump for the first time, not to spill a larger quantity of gel than 
what is needed. If this occurs, you should discard the excess gel so as not to apply more than the 
recommended dose. See paragraph “How to use Mirvaso” above.

If you use more Mirvaso than you should
26
If you use more than the maximum daily dose of 1 gram within a 24 hour period, it could lead to skin 
irritation or other side effects at the application site. Repeated doses within the same 24 hour period 
could result in side effects, such as low blood pressure, drowsiness or sleepiness.
Please contact your doctor, who will advise you on what action to take.
If anyone, especially a child, accidentally swallows Mirvaso, they may have serious side effects 
and need to be treated in a hospital.

pressure, vomiting, tiredness or drowsiness, decreased or irregular heartbeats, small pupils (constricted 
pupils), difficult or slow breathing, floppiness, low body temperature and convulsions (fits). Take the 
medicine pack with you, so the doctor knows what was swallowed.
If you forget to use Mirvaso
Mirvaso works on a daily basis, starting with the first day of treatment. If you miss a daily dose, your 
redness will not be reduced for that day. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose and 
continue your treatment as prescribed.
If you stop using Mirvaso
A potential consequence of stopping the treatment before finishing the course of treatment is the 
disease to come back to its initial state. Please contact your doctor before stopping your treatment, so 
that he could advice a replacement treatment as appropriate.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene that result 
in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface.  CFTR is an epithelial chloride 
channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. The failure 
to regulate chloride transport in these tissues results in a multisystem pathology.  In the lungs, 
obstruction of airways with thick mucus, establishment of a chronic bacterial infection in the airways, 
and damaging inflammatory responses are all thought to play a role in causing irreversible structural 
changes in the lungs and respiratory failure. Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of 
mortality.  
Over 2000 CFTR variants have been discovered but only around 200 have been characterised in terms 
of disease liability due to the extreme rarity of most of them.  
Until very recently available CF treatments target the downstream consequences of diminished CFTR 
function, particularly those related to the lung and/or the pancreatic manifestations of the disease. 
However, the understanding of the different molecular mechanisms of CFTR dysfunction provided the 
scientific basis for the development of targeted drugs for mutation-specific therapy of CF. Modulators 
of CFTR are aimed at rescuing the expression and/or function of mutated CFTR.  
There are two main types of modulators, potentiators and correctors. Potentiators recover the function 
of the CFTR protein at the apical surface of epithelial cells that is disrupted in class III and IV genetic 
mutations, while correctors improve intracellular processing of the CFTR protein, increasing surface 
expression, in class II mutations. A third type is production correctors or read-through agents, which 
promote transcription of CFTR in class I mutations.  Potentiators help chloride flow through the CFTR 
protein channel at the cell surface. The CFTR protein is shaped like a tunnel that can be closed by a 
gate. Potentiators hold the gate open so chloride can flow through. By holding the gate on the CFTR 
protein open, potentiators allow more chloride to flow through and reduce the symptoms of CF. 
However, as acknowledged in the scientific literature, there is an inter-dependence between channel 
gating and cellular processing given that each depend on CFTR protein folding, thus a sharp distinction 
between potentiators and correctors is somewhat artificial. Furthermore, compounds with both 
potentiator and corrector activity have been identified. Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA) and Orkambi 
(lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA) are the CFTR modulators approved for CF patients with specific 
mutations. Clinical efficacy of ivacaftor monotherapy has been established in some Class III mutations 
that cause defects in channel gating as well as in the Class IV mutation R117H which also has a defect 
in channel gating. Clinical efficacy of the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor has been established 
in patients homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. However, some patients are not 
able to tolerate treatment with LUM/IVA due to respiratory events related to off-target effects of the 
lumacaftor component. In addition, lumacaftor is a strong CYP3A inducer and some patients may not 
take it because of drug-drug interactions. It is therefore suggested that patients homozygous for 
F508del could benefit from new treatment options with improved efficacy/safety profile than that of 
LUM/IVA. For patients with the residual function mutations, no CFTR modulators are currently 
approved in the EU so far.  
The proposed therapeutic indication for Kalydeco 150 mg film-coated tablets was:  
Kalydeco  tablets  are  also  indicated  in  a  combination  regimen  with  Symkevi  for  the  treatment  of 
patients  with  cystic  fibrosis  (CF)  aged  12  years  and  older.  For indicated  CFTR  mutations,  refer  to  the

Summary of Product Characteristics of Symkevi. 
The  claimed  indication  for  Symkevi  100  mg/150  mg  film-coated  tablets  (EMEA/H/C/004682/0000) 
was: 
Symkevi  is  indicated  in  a  combination  regimen  with  Kalydeco  (ivacaftor  150  mg  tablet)  for  the 
treatment  of  patients  with  cystic  fibrosis  (CF)  aged  12  years  and  older  who  are  homozygous  for  the 
F508del mutation or who have at least one mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator  (CFTR)  gene  that  is  responsive  to  tezacaftor/ivacaftor  based  on  in  vitro  and/or  clinical 
evidence (see section 5.1). 
More  explicitly,  the  TEZ/IVA  combination  therapy  was  proposed  to  be  dosed  orally  each  day  in  2 
tablets as follows:

Morning  dose:  1  fixed-dose  combination  tablet  containing  100  mg  TEZ  and  150  mg  IVA, 
supplied as a yellow, film-coated tablet. 
- 
Evening dose: 1 tablet containing 150 mg IVA, supplied as a blue, film-coated tablet. 
The list of proposed mutations for approval was suggested to be cross referenced from the indication 
statement to Section 5.1 of the SmPC of Symkevi. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
The MAH has applied for two additional pack sizes for the finished product: 
•  Blister pack containing 28 film-coated tablets for the 150 mg film-coated tablets 
(EU/1/12/782/005) 
•  Blister card pack containing 28 film-coated tablets for the 150 mg film-coated tablets 
(EU/1/12/782/006)  
During the procedure the MAH has decided that the blister pack presentation containing 28-tablets for 
the 150 mg film-coated tablets is no longer pursued. 
Documentation to be supplied: 
1.  Amendment of the relevant section(s) of the dossier (presented in the EU-CTD format or NTA 
volume 6B format for veterinary products, as appropriate) including revised product information as 
appropriate.  
Sections 3.2.P.7 Container Closure System–Tablet, 6.5 of the SmPC, Annex A, Package Leaflet and 
Labelling have been updated in accordance. 
2.  Justification for the new/remaining pack-size, showing that the new/remaining size is/are 
consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of treatment as approved in the summary of 
product characteristics  
The new pack size proposed for Kalydeco (ivacaftor 150 mg) film-coated tablets is a 28-tablet pack in 
an Aclar/PVC/Alu blister. The existing approved pack size is a 56-tablet pack.  
The currently approved posology for Kalydeco monotherapy is one tablet taken orally every 12 hours; 
a one-day supply is therefore two tablets. The presently-approved pack size of 56 tablets is sufficient 
for 28 days, or four weeks of treatment.  
Vertex has submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application for Symkevi (tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 
150 mg) fixed dose combination (product ref: H0004682) to the EMA on the 25 July 2017. Symkevi 
will be used in a combination regimen with Kalydeco (ivacaftor 150 mg) film-coated tablets. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 11/144 
 
 
 
 
 
proposed posology for the Symkevi/Kalydeco combination regimen is one Symkevi tablet in the 
morning and one Kalydeco tablet in the evening. A four week supply of Kalydeco tablets for the 
proposed Symkevi/Kalydeco combination regimen is therefore 28 tablets.  
The purpose of this Type IB B.IIe.5.a)2 variation is to register the additional Kalydeco 28-tablet pack 
required to provide patients receiving the Symkevi/Kalydeco combination regimen with the correct 
number of Kalydeco tablets for a four week treatment period. 
3.  Declaration that stability studies will be conducted in accordance with the relevant guidelines for 
products where stability parameters could be affected. Data to be reported only if outside 
specifications (with proposed action).  
In accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 71212012, B.Jl.e.5 a) 1 required documentation, 
the Marketing Authorisation Holder declares that the stability parameters for Kalydeco (ivacaftor) are 
not affected by the new pack size and are the same as the previously approved. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
This is an application for the combined use of ivacaftor (as an evening dose) with Symkevi. Since 
Kalydeco is already authorised and its nonclinical profile is known, the main part of the information in 
this section refers to results from newly performed tests on tezacator. 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Tezacaftor (VX-661) is developed as a CFTR corrector, improving the processing of CFTR in the 
endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus as well as the trafficking of the protein to the 
membrane. Ivacaftor, already on the market, was shown to be a CFTR potentiator, increasing the 
chloride transport by the protein present on the membrane.  
The CFTR potentiator, e.g. the already authorised ivacaftor, is a small molecule that potentiates the 
channel open probability (channel gating activity) of both normal and some mutant forms of CFTR at 
the cell surface to enhance chloride transport. Because the channel gating activity of both normal and 
some mutant forms of CFTR delivered to the cell surface by CFTR correctors can be potentiated by 
CFTR potentiators, CFTR correctors and potentiators provide complementary therapeutic approaches to 
enhance chloride transport in people with CF. Tezacaftor (TEZ) is a new CFTR corrector being 
developed in combination with IVA (TEZ/IVA) for the treatment of CF. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In an in vitro competition assay it was shown that tezacaftor indeed binds to the first membrane 
spanning domain (MSD1, aa 1-437) of CFTR. In addition, it was shown that tezacaftor selectively 
corrects CFTR as tezacaftor does not correct processing and trafficking of two other mutated and 
misfolded proteins from the ABC superfamily, G601S-hERG and G268V-PgP.  
Due to the lack of an animal model system, in vivo non-clinical efficacy studies to show the activity 
potential of tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor were not conducted. Instead, two in vitro model systems were 
used:  
• 
Primary human bronchial epithelial cells, isolated form CF (double F508del) and non-CF lung 
explants. Efficacy of tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor in improving processing & trafficking and 
chloride transport of F508del CFTR was studied. 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 12/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
FRT cells without background CFTR were transfected with a (mutated) CFTR gene, using a 
single Flp-InTM genomic site. Efficacy of the tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor in improving 
processing & trafficking and chloride transport of each single CFTR was studied.  
In vitro HBE model system  
Tezacaftor was able to ‘transform’ a portion of the majority of immature F508del CFTR mutant to the 
‘mature’ situation as recognized by an increase in molecular weight detectable on protein level on 
western blot. The ratio of mature/total was related to the amount of the ratio mature/total levels 
wildtype CFTR levels. The increase in the ratio mature/total CFTR (from 20 to ~45% of normal CFTR) 
was not equally translated into an increase in chloride transport (from 2% to 8% of normal CFTR). This 
suggests that tezacaftor increased the amount of F508del, now correctly edited with oligosaccharides, 
on the membrane, but did not alter the chloride transport functionality of the mutated CFTR. Ivacaftor 
may be required to make the F508del CFTR, now present on the membrane, more capable to transport 
chloride. 
Indeed, tezacaftor and ivacaftor both slightly increased the chloride transport by F508del CFTR but the 
combination of the two was more successful in increasing chloride transport than the sum of the effect 
of the two compounds separately in HBE cells. The height of the airway surface liquid and the ciliary 
beat frequency, two other functional parameters to demonstrate efficacy were also statistically 
significantly improved. The potency (EC50) of tezacaftor in combination with maximally effective 
concentration of ivacaftor is 0.6 µM and the potency of ivacaftor in the presence of a maximally 
effective concentration of tezacaftor is 0.006 µM. Addition of 20% human serum, mimicking human 
situation, shifted the EC50 for tezacaftor (in presence of ivacaftor) from 0.6 µM to 3 µM, and for 
ivacaftor (in presence of tezacaftor) was shifted from 0.006 µM to 0.013 µM. In addition to the shift in 
potency, efficacy (magnitude of response) of the combination of TEZ and IVA was improved.  
In vitro FRT model system: Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor 
The FRT system was used to analyse the effect of Tezacaftor and/or Ivacaftor on processing and 
trafficking and chloride transport of normal CFTR, F508del-CFTR, a number of Residual Function 
mutants and a set of Kalydeco responsive gating mutants. The combined incubation of both drug 
substances in vitro, leads to an even higher increase in chloride transport. As stated by the MAH, in 
vitro studies showed that the combination of Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor is more efficacious than the two 
drugs separately in increase of chloride transport for the RF mutants: E56K, P67L, R74W, D110E, 
D110H, R117C, E193K, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, S945L, S977F, F1052V, K1060T, A1067T, 
R1070W, F1074L, D1152H, and D1270N, the Kalydeco responsive gating mutants: G178R, S549N, 
S549R, G551D, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, G1349D and R117H. The F508del-CFTR appeared 
not responsive in the FRT system as it did not exceed the criterion of ≥10 pp increase in chloride 
transport. The in vitro efficacy of the combination for the splice mutants 711+3A->G, 2789+5G->A, 
3272-26A->G, or 3849+10kbC->T and E381X was not investigated. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Tezacaftor showed only significant binding affinity to the sodium channel Site 2 target receptor at 
concentrations below 10 μM (Ki = 6.6 μM). However, in a functional assay no significant binding to any 
of the NaV channels; NaV1.1, NaV1.3, NaV1.5, NaV1.7, and NaV1.8, could be determined. Based on 
Studies 106 and 107, a TEV Cmax of 6 mg/l is obtained under steady-state conditions when given 100 
mg OD to CF patients. With >99% protein bound, the free tezacaftor Cmax is 0.06 mg/ml, which equals 
to 0.11 µM. Thus no secondary pharmacology effects of tezacaftor are anticipated in human. 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 13/144 
 
 
 
 
 
Ivacaftor was evaluated in a similar panel of in vitro receptor, channel and enzyme radioligand assays. 
Sub-micromolar potency was identified for two targets: the monoamine transporter and the serotonin 
receptor (5-HT2C). Since ivacaftor has a low potency to cross the blood-brain-barrier, interaction with 
these targets was considered unlikely upon treatment of patients. Based on Studies 106 and 107, a 
IVA Cmax of 1.20 mg/l is obtained under steady-state conditions when given 150 mg OD. With >99% 
protein bound, the free ivacaftor Cmax is 0.012 mg/ml, which equals 0.03 µM. Thus no secondary 
pharmacology effects of ivacaftor are anticipated in human.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Tezacaftor: As recommended in the ICH S7A and ICH S7B Guidelines, a comprehensive program of 
safety pharmacology studies was conducted to assess TEZ effects on vital organ systems and potential 
for adverse PD effects: an in vitro study to investigate potential interactions with the human cardiac 
IKr human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) channel and in vivo studies evaluating the effects on 
several vital organ systems including the CNS and respiratory, CV and GI systems. These studies were 
considered pivotal to the human safety assessment and were conducted in compliance with GLP 
regulations. 
Tezacaftor inhibited hERG potassium current by (Mean ± SEM) 16.6 ± 3.7% (significantly) at 10 μM (n 
= 4) and the IC50 was estimated to be greater than 10 μM. M2-Tezacaftor inhibited hERG current by 
2.4 ± 0.8% at 10 μM (n = 3) and the IC50 was estimated to be greater than 300 µM. Tezacaftor and 
M2-Tezacaftor are not considered potent hERG inhibitors. As the clinical free fraction of tezacaftor is 
0.11 µM, the hERG channel inhibition by tezacaftor is not regarded clinical relevant. Tezacaftor had no 
effect on CNS or respiratory function in Sprague Dawley rats dosed 0, 20, 60 or 200 mg/kg. 
Cardiovascular examination was done in conscious telemetered beagle dogs’ dose after single doses of 
tezacaftor (0, 25, 75 and 250 mg/kg). Increased ABP (17 to 25%) and decreased QT and QTc intervals 
(2 to 8%) generally between 6 to 14 hours after oral administration the high dose were only observed 
in 2 of 4 dogs, but were consistent between the 2 animals. The exposure level (AUC0-24h) in dogs after 
single dose of 75 mg/kg is ~3 fold the AUC in CF patients when given 100 mg of TEZ. Since in human, 
QTc effects were not noted, this observation is not likely to be clinically relevant.  
Fasted Sprague Dawley Rats administered 100 or 200 mg/kg tezacaftor once daily by oral gavage for 4 
days, showed significantly delayed gastric emptying of the charcoal test meal. No safety margin has 
been established for this effect but it was not observed in the clinical study. 
Ivacaftor: A comprehensive program of safety pharmacology studies in line with the ICH guidances 
mentioned above was previously conducted for IVA in support of the registration of Kalydeco. The 
effects of IVA on a number of voltage gated and non-voltage gated ion channels were limited to 
moderate inhibition of Cav1.2 and Kv1.5 channels, in addition to a concentration-dependent inhibition 
of hERG channel tail current. However, these ion channel effects were not considered clinically relevant 
given that IVA is highly protein bound across all species and the free fraction at therapeutic exposures 
in the combination regimen are relatively low (approximately 4 nM). Most conclusions from these in 
vitro studies were confirmed in vivo, where with exception of a noted dose-related decrease in GI 
motility and stomach emptying, IVA did not produce any adverse PD effects on the CNS, respiratory 
system, or CV system in vivo. 
Effects on the GI system were observed only at doses ≥500 mg/kg in rats, with no evidence of GI 
motility dysfunction noted in the chronic repeat-dose toxicity studies evaluating IVA at doses as high 
as 150 mg/kg/day in rats and 60 mg/kg/day in dogs. Together these data suggest that GI motility 
dysfunction is not likely to occur at therapeutic dose levels in humans.

Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor: Combination safety pharmacology studies involving the co-administration of TEZ 
and IVA were not performed because the studies conducted on each individual entity were considered 
adequate and provided no evidence for potential for additive or synergistic interaction in any of the 
endpoints evaluated. This is acceptable to the CHMP; potential adverse effects of the combination on 
CNS, cardiovascular, respiratory and GI systems can also be assessed in the combination repeat dose 
toxicity studies. 
Pharmacologic Profiles of Metabolites 
Tezacaftor Metabolites: TEZ has 3 major metabolites in humans: M1-TEZ (VRT-0996107), M2-TEZ 
(VRT-1189001), and M5-TEZ (VRT-1074233). The pharmacologic activity of these metabolites was 
evaluated in vitro using F/F-HBE. In plasma, TEZ and its major circulating metabolites M1- tezacaftor, 
M2-tezacaftor and M5- tezacaftor accounted for 7%, 15%, 31% and 33% of AUC values of the total 
radioactivity, respectively. Of these, M1-tezacaftor and M2-tezacaftor appears pharmacologically 
active. The potency of M1-TEZ and TEZ in the presence of continuous IVA in Cultured F/F- (F508del) 
HBE Cells were similar with EC50 values of 3.24 µM for M1-TEZ and 5.95 µM for tezacaftor. M2-TEZ had 
lower potency than TEZ (about 5-fold less than TEZ: EC50 of 1.5 µM for M2-TEZ and 0.3 µM for TEZ) 
and lower maximum efficacy than TEZ (37 ± 4% the maximum efficacy of TEZ). 
Ivacaftor Metabolites (M1-IVA and M6-IVA): Two ivacaftor metabolites are substantially present in 
human, M1 and M6. In plasma, ivacaftor and its major circulating metabolites M1-ivacaftor and M6-
ivacaftor accounted for 12%, 66% and 21% of AUCinf. Of these, M1-ivacaftor was pharmacologically 
active with a 6-fold lower potency than ivacaftor. Mean EC50 value was 1.2 µM for M1-ivacaftor and 0.2 
µM for ivacaftor.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination properties of tezacaftor (TEZ) and ivacaftor 
(IVA) have been investigated in CD-1 and Tg.rasH2 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, New Zealand White 
rabbits, Beagle dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys as single entities, and in combination in rats and dogs. 
Most studies were carried out using the oral route of administration, the intended therapeutic route in 
humans. In order to provide sufficient solubility and exposure for nonclinical studies, a 500 mg/g TEZ 
spray-dried dispersion (SDD) using HPMCAS as physical stabilizer was developed and dosed in all GLP 
studies. 
Methods of analysis: Validation reports for the analytical methods used were provided, demonstrating 
the  suitability,  storage  and  handling  for  the  purpose  of  analysis  of  TEZ  and  its  metabolites  (M1-TEZ 
and  M2-TEZ)  and  of  IVA  and  its  metabolites  M1-IVA  and  M6-IVA.  Specific  and  sensitive  bioanalytical 
assays  have  been  developed  and  validated  for  the  quantitative  determination  of  these  compounds  in 
rat,  mouse,  rabbit  and  dog  plasma.  In  these  methods,  biological  samples  were  extracted  by  liquid–
liquid extraction (GLP studies) or by protein precipitation (non-GLP studies) and analysed by LC-MS/MS 
with  stable  isotope  labeled  analogues  of  the  analytes  used  as  internal  standards.  The  assay 
reproducibility  was  demonstrated  at  least  once  per  species  /  per  assay  using  an  incurred  samples 
reanalysis  approach  during  sample  analysis.  The  radiochemical  procedures  (QWBA,  LSC  and 
radiometric detector attached to HPLC) used to detect  14C-TEZ or  14C-IVA and its metabolites 14C-M1-
IVA  and  14C-M6-IVA  are  adequate.  The  radiolabelled  compounds  are  of  sufficient  chemical  and 
radioactive purity. 
Absorption: The permeability of TEZ and its metabolites were evaluated in the Caco-2 cells and in the 
MDCK-MDR1 cell bidirectional assay. The in vitro studies demonstrated that TEZ and M1-TEZ have high 
passive permeability, whereas M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ have low passive permeability. TEZ and M1-TEZ

are Pgp substrate, and M2-TEZ may be a Pgp substrate. Summaries of plasma PK parameters for TEZ 
and IVA, administered alone or in combination in laboratory animals following single and repeated 
administration are presented in Tables below. When co-administered in combination studies in rats and 
dogs, systemic exposures to TEZ and IVA were similar to exposures achieved when these compounds 
were administered individually. The exposure of TEZ and IVA generally increased as the dose 
increased, and the increase in exposure was dose proportional at lower dose levels and was less than 
dose proportional at higher dose levels. No significant sex differences (<2-fold) in exposure were 
observed for either TEZ or IVA. Upon repeat dose oral administration, accumulation was not 
consistently observed for TEZ; whereas, accumulation was evident for IVA. In mice, TEZ exposure was 
reduced upon repeat dose oral administration, likely due to cytochrome P450 induction. The presence 
of food improved the absorption of TEZ. The oral bioavailability of TEZ increased ~ 4.0 to 6.2 folds in 
the presence of food compared to fasted animals with capsules, and the increase was less, ~1.4 to 1.8 
folds for tablets.

Distribution: Protein binding of TEZ and IVA is high (>98%) in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human 
plasma. M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ, M5-TEZ, M1-IVA, M6-IVA are also highly bound to plasma proteins and 
similarly across species (>97.5%), except that M2- TEZ is less protein-bound in mouse plasma 
(93.6%). Human serum albumin is the major human plasma protein for TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ, M5-
TEZ, M1-IVA and M6-IVA binding. Besides human serum albumin, IVA is also highly bound to other 
human plasma proteins (AAG, HGG). TEZ and IVA do not preferentially partition into red-blood cells. 
When orally administered to rats, both TEZ and IVA were rapidly distributed across most tissues. GI 
tract, liver, adrenal glands, kidney, pancreas, heart and lungs showed the highest mean maximum 
concentrations of radioactivity. The lowest exposures were observed in the brain, eyes, and testes. 
Neither TEZ nor IVA bind to melanin-containing tissues (skin and/or eyes). Placental transfer of both

14C-TEZ and 14C-IVA was observed in pregnant rats, and both were shown to be excreted in the milk of 
lactating rats. 
In a tissue distribution study conducted with non-radiolabelled TEZ at 30 mg/kg, both TEZ and M1-TEZ 
distribution was determined in brain, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, testes, fat, skin and spleen. The 
tissue to plasma AUC ratio for TEZ was highest in liver (~7.0) and lowest in brain (0.08). The lung to 
plasma AUC ratio was approximately 2.5, and the skin to plasma AUC ratio was approximately 0.3 for 
TEZ. For M1-TEZ, the tissue to plasma AUC ratio was highest in the liver (~8.7), and was ~5.3 for the 
lung, ~0.08 for the brain and ~0.2 in the skin. 
Metabolism: Both phase I and phase II pathways were involved in the metabolism of TEZ, including 
oxidation, glucuronidation, phosphorylation and various combinations thereof. Following administration 
of 14C-TEZ to rats, most of the circulating radioactivity was associated with unchanged TEZ, M1-TEZ 
(dehydrogenation metabolite) and M5-TEZ (phosphate conjugate of M1-TEZ). M1-TEZ is a 
pharmacologically active major human metabolite of TEZ. M2-TEZ, a major disproportionate human 
metabolite of TEZ that is significantly less active than TEZ, was the major excreted metabolite in rats. 
M5-TEZ is a major circulating metabolite of TEZ in humans and in rats. M5-TEZ is a phase II 
metabolite (phosphate conjugate of M1-TEZ) that was poorly permeable to cell membranes and 
pharmacologically inactive. TEZ in vitro metabolic profiles were qualitatively similar in all species 
studied, with major metabolites identified from the in vivo studies in rats and humans summarized in 
figure below. 
Figure 1 Proposed metabolic pathway of TEZ in rats and humans 
The IVA metabolites, M1-IVA (M1-IVA; significantly less pharmacologically active than IVA) and M6-
IVA (M6-IVA; pharmacologically inactive), were prominent circulating metabolites in all species 
studied. Metabolites identified from in vivo studies in rats and humans are summarized in Figure 2. The 
metabolism of IVA was catalysed primarily by phase I metabolic enzymes, with minor contribution by 
phase II conjugation enzymes. IVA was primarily metabolized to M1-IVA and M6-IVA by oxidation. 
Assessment report

Other minor metabolites observed were products of structural modification (oxidation and/or 
conjugation) of M1-IVA or M6-IVA. A direct conjugation of IVA led to M3 metabolite formation, which 
was observed in plasma and urine.  
Figure 2 Proposed metabolic pathway of IVA in rats and humans 
The extent of metabolism was evaluated in 8 major human recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYPs) and 
hepatocytes from multiple species, including rat, dog, monkey and human. In a panel of 8 recombinant 
CYPs (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5), TEZ when tested 
at 1 and 10 μM, was stable over 1 hour incubation except for significant metabolic turnover in 
CYP3A4/5, which suggests that CYP3A4/5 is likely involved in the oxidative metabolism of TEZ (Table 
4).

In a panel of 8 CYPs (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5), 
M1-TEZ tested at 1 μM, was stable over 1 hour incubation except for metabolic turnover in CYP3A4/5, 
which suggests that CYP3A4/5 is likely involved in the oxidative metabolism of M1-TEZ CYP3A4/5 was 
involved in transformation of M1-TEZ to M2-TEZ. In addition, M2-TEZ was detected in human liver 
cytosol preparations incubated with M1-TEZ in the presence but not absence of NAD+, suggesting that 
aldehyde dehydrogenase might be involved in converting M1-TEZ to M2-TEZ (Table 5).

Table 5 M1-TEZ Metabolism by Human Recombinant CYPs 
Excretion: In intact rats, intact dogs and humans, the main route of excretion of tezacaftor is via the 
faeces (75% - 79%, 58% and 72% of dose, respectively). Faecal excretion in intact dogs was relatively 
low probably due to liquid faeces in some of the animals as also a high amount in the cage rinse (18%) 
was found. Studies with bile duct cannulated (BDC) rats and dogs showed that large part of faecal 
excretion was due to excretion via the bile (53% and 50% of dose in orally dosed BDC rats and dogs 
respectively). Excretion via the urine was low, generally below 10% of dose in rats and dogs and 14% 
in humans. In rats, total radioactivity in faeces was excreted primarily as unchanged tezacaftor and 
M2-TEZ and in bile primarily as M2-TEZ. In dogs, radioactivity in bile was excreted primarily as 
glucuronides of tezacaftor and of M1-TEZ. Tezacaftor was excreted in milk of rats with a Cmax in milk of 
1.5 times the Cmax in maternal plasma.  
Faecal elimination is the predominant route of excretion of ivacaftor in rat and humans. As the result of 
extensive metabolism, only 2.5% of the total radioactive dose of ivacaftor was excreted as unchanged 
parent in humans. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Transporter substrate potential in vitro: In vitro studies were performed to evaluate if TEZ, M1-TEZ, 
M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ were substrates for hepatic uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) and efflux 
transporters (P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP). Based on these, TEZ is a substrate for 
the uptake transporter OATP1B1, but not for OATP1B3. TEZ is also a substrate for efflux transporters 
P-gp and BCRP. M1-TEZ and M2-TEZ are substrate for P-gp. Furthermore, M2-TEZ is substrate for 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ are not substrates for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 
CYP induction potential in vitro: TEZ is predicted to have low potential to cause DDIs via CYP induction. 
In human hepatocyte assay, TEZ did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 mRNA. Induction of CYP3A4 
mRNA was observed, but considering unbound Cmax at therapeutic dose, TEZ is not likely to be a 
significant inducer in the clinic. In human hepatocyte assay, M1-TEZ did not induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 
at clinically relevant concentration and M2-TEZ did not show induction of CYP3A4 mRNA. M5-MEZ did 
not induce CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 and showed weak CYP3A4 mRNA induction. In cryopreserved human 
hepatocytes TEZ had no substantial impact on the metabolism of IVA. The prediction of low induction 
risk is supported by the observation that systemic exposures to TEZ and IVA when co-administered 
were similar to the exposures achieved when dosed individually in rats, dogs and humans, as well as 
the result from clinical DDI study with midazolam (a CYP3A substrate). 
CYP inhibition potential in vitro: The inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes by TEZ and its major 
human circulating metabolites (M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ) were assessed by using pooled human 
liver microsomes. The IC50 values for inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were ≥25 μM for TEZ, were ≥12 μM for M1-TEZ, and were ≥ 75 μM for 
M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ. Based on the free Cmax of TEZ and its metabolites of approximately 0.11 µM or 
less no in vivo inhibition of CYPS by these substances are expected. 
Transporter inhibition potential in vitro: Bidirectional transport studies were conducted with Madin-
Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells overexpressing human MDR1. Inhibition of Pgp in MDCK-hMDR1

cells was evaluated by monitoring the inhibition of the Pgp mediated transport for digoxin (10 μM) at 
varying test compound concentrations (0 - 100 μM). The IC50 values were 28.6 μM for TEZ, >30 μM for 
M1-TEZ and >100 μM for M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ. At oral dose of 100 mg QD of TEZ, the Cmax of TEZ at 
steady state is 12.5 μM, and Cmax/IC50 >0.1, suggesting potential drug-drug interaction due to Pgp 
inhibition in the clinic. Therefore, a clinical DDI study with digoxin was conducted for TEZ in 
combination with IVA, and the result suggests minimal contribution of TEZ to Pgp inhibition. The 
potential of TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ to inhibit the transport of probe substrate by human 
BCRP, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2 was evaluated at 10 μM concentration. The probe substrate for these 
transporters were 2 μM p-aminohippurate (OAT1), 10 μM p-aminohippurate (OAT3), 10 μM metformin 
(OCT2) and 25 nM genistein (BCRP). Percent inhibition was below 27% for all 4 transporters tested, 
with the exception of 51% inhibition observed for TEZ on OAT3. A follow-up dose In IVA study 770-
010study was carried out and IC50 was determined to be > 60 μM. Thus, the DDI potential for TEZ, 
M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ through inhibition of BCRP, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2 is predicted to be low. 
TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ inhibited atorvastatin uptake into OATP1B1 overexpressed HEK-293 
cells in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 3.24 μM, 6.22 μM, 7.60 μM, and 11.4 
μM, respectively. TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ inhibited atorvastatin uptake into OATP1B3 
overexpressed HEK-293 cells in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 28.8 μM, 19.8 
μM, 21.5 μM, and 12.9 μM, respectively. The DDI potential for TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ 
through inhibition of uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 is predicted to be low, as calculated 
R-values were less than 1.25 with exposure achieved at clinical dose of TEZ 100 mg QD. 
In IVA study 770-010IVA and M1-IVA are not substrates for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. M6-IVA is 
substrate for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. IVA is not a substrate of Pgp. M1-IVA appears to be a Pgp 
substrate, while M6-IVA does not appear to be a Pgp substrate, but potentially could be a substrate for 
other efflux transporters. BCRP is not expected to influence IVA PK because it is highly permeable (Papp 
(A→ B) = 11.9 x 10-6 cm/sec in Caco-2 cells), is well-absorbed upon oral administration, and is not 
excreted unchanged. However, an in vitro test for substrate characteristics towards BCRP is considered 
a basic requirement for new drugs. Further, effects of BCRP on IVA metabolites M1-IVA and M6-IVA 
cannot be excluded. Therefore, investigations elucidating whether ivacaftor and its substrates are 
substrate for BCRP have been initiated by the MAH and results will be submitted post-approval. In vitro 
studies showed that IVA and M1-IVA have a potential for DDI through inhibition of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 
and CYP3A. M6-IVA did not inhibit any CYP enzymes significantly with in vitro IC50 values ≥ 63 μM. IVA 
is predicted to have low potential to cause DDIs via CYP induction. In human hepatocytes, IVA, M1-IVA 
and M6-IVA were not inducers of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4/5.  
IVA has the potential to inhibit Pgp with IC50 of 0.17 μM, and BCRP with IC50 of 12.4 μM. IVA is not 
expected to inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. M1-IVA showed inhibition of Pgp 
(IC50 8.2 μM), but not M6- IVA. M1-IVA and M6-IVA showed weak inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, 
with low predicted DDI risk due to low unbound Cmax at the therapeutic dose (R-values <1.004). 
2.3.3.  Toxicology  
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies were not conducted with TEZ in mice or rats, since they are no longer 
recommended in the ICH M3(R2) guidelines. TEZ was dosed at a single dose up to 2000 mg/kg in male 
and female mice in a micronucleus assay; the MTD was established at 2000 mg/kg. The single-dose or 
acute oral toxicity profile of IVA was previously established in GLP-compliant studies (mouse and rat) 
conducted in support of the initial MAA for Kalydeco. While these studies are not considered pivotal to 
the safety assessment of the proposed combination regimen, the MTD in mice and rats was established 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 23/144 
 
 
 
 
 
at 2000 and 500 mg/kg, respectively. Thus, the acute oral toxicity of IVA was considered to be of low 
order, particularly considering the exposures achieved in these studies. 
Repeat dose toxicity  
Repeat-dose oral toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats and dogs to explore the toxic potential 
of TEZ following repeated oral exposure up to 52 weeks. In both species decreased food consumption 
accompanied by a decrease in bodyweight gain was observed, especially in the first weeks of dosing. 
In  addition,  in  rats,  a  decrease  in  erythrocytic  parameters  and  subsequent  increase  in  circulating 
reticulocytes  was  observed.  However,  these  finding  were  not  seen  in  clinical  studies  conducted  with 
TEZ  and  IVA  combined  therapy.  Also  observed  in  both  rats  and  dogs  was  the  microscopic  finding  of 
minimal  to  mild  dilated lacteals  in  the  villi  tips  of  the  duodenum,  jejunum  and/or  ileum.  Dilatation  of 
lacteals was considered non-adverse in all toxicity studies based on a lack of progression over time and 
severity  of  the  finding.  It  should  be  noted  that  safety  factors  for  this  effect  are  low  or  absent:  TEZ 
exposures at the NOAEL in rats (50 mg/kg/day) and dogs (10 mg/kg/day), were 2.2-2.6 fold (rat) or  
0.3–0.4 (dogs) fold times the expected exposure (steady-state AUC0-24hr) at the human therapeutic 
dosage.  However,  since  there  is  an  absence  of  TEZ-related  clinical  signs  and/or  clinical  pathology 
findings  that  could  be  related  to  this  effect,  it  can  be  concluded  that  dilated lacteals  is  unlikely  to be 
relevant for humans.  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were previously conducted in support of the registration of Kalydeco and 
ranging  from  sub-acute  to  chronic  in  duration  identified  the  liver  (mice  and  rats)  as  the  only  IVA-
related  target  organ  of  toxicity.  The  mechanism  of  hepatotoxicity  is  believed  to  be  a  rodent-specific 
phenomenon and not relevant to humans. 
Combination  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  involving  the  co-administration  of  TEZ  and  IVA  up  to  3 
months in duration in rats and 28 days in duration in dogs did not produce any unexpected toxicities or 
interactions.  Noteworthy,  test  article-related  microscopic  findings  in  both  rats  and  dogs  were  non-
adverse  minimal-to-mild  dilated  lacteals  noted  in  the  duodenum,  jejunum,  and/or  ileum  of  the  small 
intestine.  This  was  also  noted  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  with  TEZ  suggesting  no 
additive  or  synergistic  effects  noted  with  the  combination  of  TEZ/IVA  for  this  finding.  In  a  3  month 
combination  toxicity  study,  the  death  of  a  rat  was  attributed  to  the  oral  administration  of  80/20 
mg/kg/day TEZ/IVA. This animal showed a marked reduction in food consumption and body weight in 
addition  to  other  effects.  The  systemic  exposure  detected  in  this  animal  was  reported  to  be 
approximately 4 and 19 times the exposures noted in patients at the daily clinical dose of 100 mg TEZ 
and 300 mg IVA, respectively.   In the 28-day TEZ/IVA  combination toxicity study conducted in dogs, 
no  effects  on  body  weight  or  food  consumption  were  noted  at  doses  up  to  100/60  mg/kg/day  of 
TEZ/IVA  where  the  relative  exposure  to  TEZ  and  IVA  were  5-  and  19-fold  the  clinical  exposures  at  a 
daily dose of 100 mg TEZ and 300 mg IVA.  In addition, body weight changes (i.e. increases in mean 
BMI  and  weight)  observed  in  patients  treated  with  the  combination  of  TEZ/IVA  were  similar  to  those 
who received placebo. Thus, the degree of reduced body weight and food consumption observed in the 
rat  that  died  in  the  28  day  toxicity  study  with  TEZ/IVA  did  not  seem  to  translate  to  patients  treated 
with TEZ/IVA.   
Genotoxicity 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor were found to be negative in the Ames assay, in vitro chromosomal aberration 
assay and in vivo micronucleus test. 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018

Carcinogenicity 
TEZ was concluded to be non-carcinogenic in the 26-week Tg.rasH2 transgenic mouse carcinogenicity 
assay at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (highest dose), which provides similar exposure level to TEZ (1.1-
1.8 fold) that those reached in patients at the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD).  
Benign  cholangiomas  were  observed  in  2/70  females  at  high  dose  and  the  increased  incidence  was 
statistically significant. However, there was an absence of tezacaftor-related bile duct proliferation and 
effects  on  the  bile  duct  were  also  not  observed  in  repeated  dose  studies  in  rat.  Increased  incidences 
were  noted 
in  a  dose  responsive  manner 
for  other  tumour  types, 
including  malignant 
pheochromocytomas  in  males,  malignant  lymphomas  in  males,  and  pars  distalis  carcinomas  of  the 
pituitary gland in females. The company provided historical control data and discussed the relevance of 
tumour  findings  of  the  rat  2  year  carcinogenicity  study  for  tezacaftor  The  incidence  of  pars  distalis 
carcinoma  in  the  pituitary  gland  in  female  rats  was  below  historical  control.  Benign  cholangiomas  in 
females, malignant pheochromocytomas in males and malignant lymphomas in males occurred slightly 
above  historical  control.  However,  as  the  incidence  of  these  findings  was  low  and  the  effects  are 
considered rat specific in literature, these effects are not considered relevant for human.  
IVA  was  also  concluded  to  be  non-carcinogenic  in  the  2-year  rodent  bioassays  at  doses  up  to  200 
mg/kg/day  in  mice  and  50  mg/kg/day  in  rats  (highest  doses  tested  for  each species).  At  the  highest 
dose tested, ivacaftor exposure was 10.3-18.7 and 42.8-78.3 fold exposure at the MRHD in human, for 
mice and rat, respectively.  
Non-neoplastic  findings  with  either  TEZ  or  IVA  were  either  considered  non-adverse  and/or  species-
specific and not relevant to humans. 
Combination  carcinogenicity  studies  involving  the  co-administration  of  TEZ  and  IVA  were  not 
performed as the studies conducted on each individual entity were considered adequate to assess the 
carcinogenic risk associated with co-administration and provided no evidence for potential for additive 
or synergistic interaction. This is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Fertility:  Tezacaftor  did  not  have  an  adverse  effect  on  male  or  female  fertility  or  early  embryonic 
development  in  rats  up  to  2.6  fold  exposure  at  the  MRHD.  At  this  dose,  number  of  abnormal  sperm 
was slightly increased, but did not affect male fertility and was within historical control. Ivacaftor was 
associated with a decrease of overall fertility index and number of pregnancies in females mated with 
treated  males,  with  significant  reductions  in  number  of  corpora  lutea  and  implantation  sites  with 
subsequent  reductions  in  the  average  litter  size  and  average  number  of  viable  embryos  per  litter  in 
treated  females.  In  males  significant  weight  decrease  of  the  seminal  vesicles  without  fluid  was 
observed. The ivacaftor margin of safety for male and female fertility is 4 times the systemic exposure 
of  ivacaftor  and  its  metabolites  in  adult  humans  at  the  MRHD  (animal  pharmacokinetic  data  from 
studies VX-770-TX-010 and VX-770-TX-006 and human pharmacokinetic data from study G198). 
Embryo-fetal development: The effect of tezacaftor on embryo-fetal development was tested in rat and 
rabbit.  Maternal  toxicity  included  decreases  of  body  weight  and  food  consumption  during  treatment, 
which  was  partially  recovered  after  treatment  in  both  species.  In  rat,  no  adverse  effects on  the  fetus 
were  observed.  In  the  rabbit,  at  maternal  toxic  doses  fetal  weight  was  decreased.  Exposure  at  the 
embryo fetal NOAEL was 3.1 and 0.2 fold exposure at MRHD in human, for rat and rabbit, respectively. 
Ivacaftor was not teratogenic dosed orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis. In rats, 
at moderate to severe maternal toxic doses, reductions of fetal body weight and increases in variations 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018

of  skeletal  development  were  observed,  including  cervical  ribs,  incompletely  ossified  ribs,  wavy  ribs 
and sternal irregularities. These variations are commonly observed in the presence of maternally toxic 
doses,  and  are  therefore  in  this  study  not  considered  adverse.    In  rabbit,  extreme  maternal  toxicity 
was observed at the high and mid dose tested, leading to moribundity and resulting in abortions and 
total litter loss. 
Prenatal  and  postnatal  development,  including  maternal  function:  In  the  pre-  and  postnatal  study, 
tezacaftor induced maternal toxicity at mid and high dose. Due to severe toxicity, the high dose (100 
mg/kg/day)  was  terminated  early  at  lactation  day  (LD)  17/18  and  one  animal  was  euthanized  in 
extremis at GD13 due to severe body weight loss and decreased food consumption. Maternal adverse 
effects  included  decreased  body  weight  during  gestation  and  lactation  (up  to  -17%)  and  decreased 
food  consumption  at  both  mid  (50  mg/kg/day)  and  high  dose  and  thinness  at  high  dose  only.  In 
addition at high dose, poor pup survival was observed. Pups showed clinical signs including decreased 
activity, thin appearance, skin cold to touch and skin discoloured purple in pups during lactation, pre-
weaning  developmental  delays  (pinna  detachment,  eye  opening  and  static  righting  reflexes),  sexual 
maturation  delays  (vaginal  opening  and  preputial  separation),  effect  on  pup motor  activity  (increases 
in  total  distance  travelled),  and  in  F1  female  animals  lower  corpora  lutea  counts,  fewer  uterine 
implantation sites and fewer viable embryos in the GD13 uterine fertility assessments were noted. In 
addition,  at  mid  dose only,  fertility  index  was  low  in  female  F1  animals  and  effects  on  oestrous  cycle 
were observed. These effects were not observed at high dose, but cannot be excluded as a tezacaftor 
induced effect, as exposure at high dose was discontinued early and due to small number of litters at 
high dose for continuation of the study. The NOAEL for pre and post natal toxicity and maternal toxicity 
was  25  mg/kg/day.  Exposure  at  this  dose  is  0.9  fold  exposure  at  the  MRHD.  Ivacaftor  exposure  was 
associated with reductions of survival and lactation indices and decreased pup body weight in the pre- 
and  postnatal  development  study.  No  developmental  effects  were  observed  at  the  NOAEL  of  100 
mg/kg/day, which corresponds to an exposure of approximately 3 fold at the MRHD, based on the AUC 
for IVA and its metabolites. M1 and M6 were not measured in the reproductive toxicity studies, so the 
metabolite values were extrapolated from the ratio of M1 and M6 to IVA in females in the 6-month rat 
study  (VX-770-TX-010)  (ratios of  M1:IVA  at  100  mg/kg/day  and  150  mg/kg/day  were  10%  and  9%, 
respectively, so average is 10%; ratios of M6:IVA at 100 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day were 3% and 
4%, respectively, so average is 4%).Studies in juvenile animals. 
Juvenile  toxicity  studies  conducted  in  rats  to  support  the  treatment  of  young  children  less  than  two 
year of age with ivacaftor (Kalydeco)  identified the eye (lens opacities/cataracts) as a target organ of 
IVA-related  toxicity;  the  aetiology  of  this  finding  remains  unknown  and  ocular  effects  were  not 
detected in repeat-dose studies conducted in older mice, rats, or dogs.  
Local tolerance 
Dermal and ocular local tolerance studies with tezacaftor were performed worker safety testing. 
Tezacaftor was predicted to be a dermal non-irritant in the EPIDERM assay and a mild eye irritant in 
vivo in the rabbit. 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity: Potential phototoxicity of tezacaftor was tested by measuring relative reduction in 
viability of Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts exposed to tezacaftor and ultraviolet radiation (+UVR). 
Tezacaftor was tested at concentrations of 1.00, 1.78, 3.16, 5.62, 10.0, 17.8, 376 and 56.2 μg/mL. 
Tezacaftor did not demonstrate phototoxic potential in this assay and therefore does not appear to 
present any risk of phototoxicity in humans.

Antigenicity: Tezacaftor and ivacaftor were both negative for antigenicity in the murine local lymph 
node assay. 
Studies on metabolites: Major metabolites of tezacaftor identified in human are M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and 
M5-TEZ. The M1-TEZ metabolite was not evaluated independently in toxicity studies. The rationale for 
not doing so was supported by the facts that M1-TEZ exposures in rats were considered to be high 
enough at the tezacaftor NOAEL in rats to provide adequate toxicology coverage for human exposures 
at intended therapeutic dose levels. M1-TEZ metabolite exposure ratios at the NOAELs in the longest 
duration non-clinical studies compared to human at a dose of 100 mg QD were 4-fold for rats and 1-
fold for dogs. The M5-TEZ metabolite is a no pharmacologically active Phase 2 and was also detected 
at levels in a rat oral PK study that were estimated at steady state to be approximately 1.5-fold 
compared to human at a dose of 100 mg QD. M2-TEZ is classified as a major disproportionate human 
metabolite at steady-state . M2-TEZ was evaluated independently in separate repeat-dose toxicity, 
genotoxicity, and embryo-fetal development (EFD).  
No dedicated genotoxicity tests have been performed for the metabolites M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ. In 
genotoxicity test S9 metabolic activation is expected to result in TEZ-M1 and TEZ-M5 exposure.  
Exposure of the M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ metabolites was at a sufficient level in the tezacaftor in vivo 
mouse chromosome aberration assay and tezacaftor mouse and rat carcinogenicity assays. All 
genotoxicity tests for tezacaftor were negative, and therefore M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ are also not 
considered genotoxic. As highest dose tested in the carcinogenicity studies was the MTD, these studies 
are considered sufficient for studying possible carcinogenicity of M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ.  
Metabolites of IVA were not evaluated independently in toxicity studies in support of the registration of 
Kalydeco. This was because M1-IVA exposures in male rats were considered to be high enough at the 
IVA NOAEL in rats to provide adequate toxicology coverage for human exposures at intended 
therapeutic dose levels, chemical synthesis of M1-IVA and M6-IVA beyond small mg quantities was 
prohibitive, M1-IVA and M6-IVA had limited exposure after oral administration due to a combination of 
solubility-limited absorption with moderate to high clearance, and while both M1-IVA and M6-IVA 
demonstrated some exposure upon IV administration, both were practically insoluble in aqueous 
vehicles suitable for IV dosing in repeat-dose studies. 
Studies with tezacaftor metabolite M2-TEZ: Repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity and reproductive 
developmental toxicity studies were conducted with the metabolite M2-TEZ. M2-TEZ was evaluated 
independently in separate repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and embryo-fetal development (EFD) 
studies discussed below. M2-TEZ subcutaneous repeat-dose toxicity was evaluated in rats and dogs up 
to 28 days. However in rats, severe adverse injection site reactions were observed on day 1 and 2 in 
the middle- and high dose animals. Therefore, animals were necropsied on day 3. M2-TEZ was better 
tolerated in dogs and clinical observations were limited to the injection sites including epidermal 
erosion/ulcer and associated inflammation, oedema, and other dermal and/or subcutaneous findings. 
M2-TEZ was not found to be genotoxic in the Ames assay and chromosomal aberration assay in HPBL 
cells.No M2-TEZ associated effects on fetal development or survival were observed at doses that 
suppose exposure level 1.8 fold the exposure at the MRHD. 
Studies on impurities: Impurities are considered toxicologically qualified based on in silico data 
generated by DEREK and SARAH or data of repeat dose toxicity studies in dog and rat. Four potential 
impurities (VRT-0826681, VRT-0909604, VRT-0910507, and VRT-0911436) were found negative for 
genotoxicity. No specified impurities were identified in the IVA SDD drug product. All other impurities 
were controlled to the applicable ICH Q3 limits.

Study on bioaccumulation of ivacaftor is not available yet and the PBT assessment cannot be finalised 
in the current evaluation. Furthermore, the ivacaftor and the tezacaftor ERAs cannot be finalised for 
the STP, surface water, groundwater, sediment and terrestrial compartment because of the absence of 
relevant study reports. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The FRT system was used to analyse the effect of tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor on processing and 
trafficking and chloride transport of normal CFTR, F508del-CFTR, a number of RF mutants, and a set of 
Kalydeco responsive gating mutants.  
The combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor is regarded effective in vitro when  
(1) a statistically significant increase in chloride transport over baseline normal;   
(2) a ≥10 pp increase in chloride transport over baseline as a percentage of normal CFTR;  
(3) a statistically significant increase in chloride transport compared to treatment with ivacaftor alone, 
are demonstrated.  
To include mutants in the indication based on in vitro data only, the MAH would have to convincingly 
demonstrate that the in vitro FRT model is valid.  In this respect, the MAH claimed that this system in 
which a single CFTR form is expressed was a validate assay to predict possible clinical response in 
subjects carrying at least one of the mutations of interest. Given that Van Goor and colleagues (2014) 
also characterised various missense mutations associated with defects in protein processing or function 
in FRT cells in response to ivacaftor alone, the MAH was requested to describe the experimental 
conditions used in Western Blot and Ussing chamber studies, including whether mRNA expression for 
each of the mutants has been quantified. A comparison versus the results published by Van Goor 
(2014) was also requested.  
Differences were observed in the baseline values of mature CFTR protein (expressed as % of normal 
CFTR) and of chloride transport (expressed as % of normal CFTR) compared to the data provided in 
the TEZ/IVA dossier. It was concluded, however, that these differences may be caused by the 
experimental conditions used in the studies performed, a fact that could not be circumvented. In 
addition, an unexpected result was observed in the FRT cell system regarding the F508del-CFTR 
mutant as tezacaftor/ivacaftor failed to increase chloride transport by ≥ 10% over baseline which is 
inconsistent with the results of study 106 where homozygous F508del patients demonstrated a clinical 
Assessment report

Page 30/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
benefit for TEZ/IVA over placebo suggesting that there may be a gene dosage effect that in vivo is 
important.  
 As an overall conclusion of the response provided by the MAH, it is considered that the stably 
transfected FRT cell line is useful for gathering information on the underlying defect of certain CFTR 
mutant proteins as they allow transepithelial ion transport and Western blot studies. However, the 
relevance of the results observed in vitro for the in vivo situation is not fully established, given the 
non-human origin of the cell line, the high levels of transfected CFTR expression in this system (see 
section 2.4) and the fact that only a single allele can be expressed. In addition, this system seems 
highly susceptible to the experimental conditions used (e.g. concentration of the test agents, acute 
versus chronic addition of the test agents, temperature etc.). This has been shown by comparing the in 
vitro results available in the public domain in the same system versus the ones reported by the MAH. 
There seems to be an overall agreement between both sets of data in terms of which is the functional 
defect of each of the CFTR mutations considered for approval. However, some discrepancies arise, e.g. 
the magnitude of the changes observed for some specific mutations. The data presented are not 
reassuring of an in vitro – in vivo correlation and point to limitations of the FRT system to predict 
clinical efficacy. The scatterplots and clinical response in study 108 may only indicate that the cut-off 
of 10 pp over baseline expressed as a percentage of normal CFTR in the FRT cell line would have been 
well chosen, but this could only be concluded in the presence of data on the ‘negative’ side of the cut-
off. Therefore, there continues to be substantial degree of uncertainty over the sufficiency of the in 
vitro data based identification of on the FRT system to identify mutations using a panel of Fischer rat 
thyroid (FRT) cells for inclusion within the scope of the indication. Thus, considering the lack of a multi-
pronged approach for the identification of patients with genotypes suitable for treatment, the in vitro 
model used is not sufficiently reliable to predict a clear clinical efficacy in patients with mutations 
where clinical date are missing.  
As a result of these considerations, the indication of Symkevi was restricted to those mutations, where 
clinical data from patients were presented. In addition, the Kalydeco responsive mutants, were also 
retracted from the indication, due to the negative clinical data observed in a clinical trial, please refer 
to section 2.5 for detailed discussion.  
In the rat 2-year carcinogenicity study for tezacaftor, the incidence of pars distalis carcinoma in the 
pituitary gland in female rats was below historical control data. Benign cholangiomas in females, 
malignant pheochromocytomas in males, and malignant lymphomas in males occurred slightly above 
historical control. However, as the incidence of these findings was low or considered to be specific to 
rat as per the published literature, these effects are not relevant for the use in humans. Juvenile 
toxicity studies have not been conducted with tezacaftor, as the MAH states they are not required to 
support the current proposed indication for treatment of patients of 12 year and older. This is in line 
with the guideline on the need for non-clinical testing in juvenile animals of pharmaceuticals for 
paediatric use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/169215/2005), as there are no suggestions that tezacaftor has an 
effect on the CNS, reproductive organs or bone growth. Based on available data from toxicity studies, 
it is not expected that tezacaftor is potentially immunotoxic, or that it will have an effect on 
dependence. 
There were no human specific metabolites identified. However, the exposure safety margins of TEZ 
and IVA metabolite (M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ, M1-IVA and M6-IVA) at the NOAEL in repeat dose toxicity 
studies were low in some instances. Clinical experience, including placebo-controlled and long-term 
safety data from TEZ/IVA clinical studies and the established safety profile of ivacaftor, have 
demonstrated lack of translatability of adverse non-clinical findings. Therefore, the exposure-based 
margins are considered adequate for the proposed clinical use.

As for the environmental risk assessment, both, tezacaftor and ivacaftor ERA studies were not 
completed but the MAH agreed to conduct further tests and submit their results post-authorisation. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In the pharmacodynamic investigation of tezacaftor monotherapy and TEZ/IVA combination, 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor showed a consistent positive effect in the investigated subjects with CF 
homozygous for F508del or heterozygous F508del/G551D or heterozygous for F508del and a residual 
function mutation (F/RF).  The pharmacokinetics of tezacaftor and ivacaftor has been investigated to a 
reasonable degree. Some concerns remain to be resolved via post-authorisation measures and these 
have been committed to by the applicant in a letter of recommendation.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of tezacaftor (and ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor) as well as its major 
metabolites were investigated both in healthy subjects and CF patients. Studies in healthy subjects 
were performed to understand dose-proportionality, effect of food on exposure, bioavailability from 
different formulations, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) characteristics, DDI 
potential of tezacaftor/ivacaftor as CYP3A substrate and a potential CYP3A and P-gp inhibitor, DDI with 
oral contraceptives, effect of moderate hepatic impairment on PK of tezacaftor/ivacaftor and effect of 
tezacaftor on the ECG QT interval. Further PK data were obtained from 2 Phase 2 studies (Studies 101, 
103) and 3 Phase 3 studies (Studies 106, 107, and 108) to assess the effects of demographic 
characteristics and other covariates on tezacaftor/ivacaftor PK and to characterize the exposure-
response relationships (population PK [popPK] and PK/ pharmacodynamics [PK/PD]).  
Table 8 below provides an overview of the clinical pharmacology studies conducted throughout 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor clinical development.

Table 8 List of Clinical Pharmacology Studies 
Absorption 
Tezacaftor is considered to be a BCS Class 2 (low solubility/high permeability) compound, using the 
criteria described in the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. Tezacaftor and M1-TEZ are P-
glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates. Both M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ had low apparent permeability. Studies with 
Caco-2 and recombinant MDCK-MDR1 cells indicate that IVA and M6-IVA are not substrates of P-gp 
and that M1-IVA is a P-gp substrate. Tezacaftor is orally available, with a median time to maximum 
concentration (tmax) of approximately 3 hours in healthy subjects (100-mg tablet, under fed 
conditions). Cmax and AUC (AUC0-24) of TEZ increased approximately dose-proportionally following 
doses of 50 to 300 mg qd (Study 001). After a single dose of TEZ 50 mg/IVA 150 mg FDC in the fed 
state, the median (range) tmax for TEZ was approximately 4 hours (2 to 6 hours), and the median 
(range) tmax for IVA was approximately 6 hours (3 to 10 hours; Study 004). The median (range) tmax 
values were similar after a single dose of TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150 mg FDC in the fed state in: TEZ: 4 
hours (2 to 8 hours); IVA: 6 hours (4 to 8 hours; Study 006 Cohort 2 Day 6). In Study 001 Part B, a 
high-fat meal had no significant effect on the TEZ AUC0-∞ from either tablet or solution formulation 
but reduced the Cmax of both formulations by approximately 30%. 
Administration of food with the TEZ 50 mg/IVA 150 mg FDC formulation had no clinically relevant 
effect on TEZ exposures but significantly increased IVA exposures: IVA Cmax increased 4-fold and IVA 
AUC0-∞ increased 3-fold (Study 004). These results are consistent with the food effect observed for

IVA monotherapy and the dosing recommendations for IVA monotherapy. As a result, the FDC 
formulation is recommended to be administered with food. 
Distribution 
In vitro, both protein binding of tezacaftor, M1-tezacaftor, M2-tezacaftor, and M5-tezacaftor as well as 
that of ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor is high in human plasma, with approximately more 
than 99% bound to plasma proteins. Tezacaftor primarily binds to albumin and ivacaftor primarily to 
alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. After oral administration of tezacaftor 100 mg once daily in 
combination with ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours in patients with CF in the fed state, the mean range 
for apparent volume of distribution of tezacaftor and ivacaftor was approximately 270-300 L and 206-
220 L, respectively. Neither tezacaftor nor ivacaftor partition preferentially into human red blood cells. 
Elimination 
In vitro data indicate that tezacaftor and M1-tezacaftor are metabolized extensively by human CYP3A4 
and CYP3A5. Following oral administration of a single dose of 100 mg 14C-tezacaftor to healthy male 
subjects, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ, and M5-TEZ were the 3 major circulating metabolites of tezacaftor in 
humans (contributing to 15%, 31%, and 33% of total radioactivity, respectively). Tezacaftor 
represents 7% of total radioactivity. M1-TEZ has similar potency to that of tezacaftor and is considered 
pharmacologically active. M2-TEZ is much less pharmacologically active than tezacaftor or M1-TEZ, 
and M5-TEZ is not considered pharmacologically active. A minor circulating metabolite, M3-TEZ, is 
formed by direct glucuronidation of tezacaftor. Based on data from the original ivacaftor dossier, it is 
known that ivacaftor is also metabolized extensively in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that 
ivacaftor is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. M1-IVA and M6-IVA are the two major 
metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. M1-IVA has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and 
is considered pharmacologically active. M6-IVA is not considered pharmacologically active. 
After single dose administration of 100 mg tezacaftor in healthy volunteers, the mean elimination half-
lives for unchanged TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ were similar and ranged from 109 to 122 h 
after single dose administration. In the CF patient study 101, tezacaftor clearance under steady-state 
conditions in CF patients was 1.31 (0.41) l/h, and its elimination half-life was 156 (52.7) h. The t1/2 
for M1-661 and M2-661 under steady state conditions were 128 (39.5) h and 129 (26.7) h, 
respectively. 
In a mass balance study, a mean of 72.2% of the radioactive TEZ dose was recovered in faeces and 
13.7% was recovered in urine through the last collection interval, resulting in a mean overall recovery 
of 85.9%. Tezacaftor is therefore mainly eliminated via the faeces, either as parent compound (34%) 
or as M2-TEZ (26% of the administered dose). Renal excretion accounts for approximately 13% of the 
administered dose (10% as M2-TEZ and 2.5% as M3-TEZ). Less than 1% of the dose is excreted as 
parent compound via the urine. These results indicate that the majority of tezacaftor is excreted from 
the body via faeces following oral administration.  
In the CF patient Study 101, after administration of 100 mg tezacaftor QD and 150 mg ivacaftor q12h, 
ivacaftor clearance under steady-state conditions was 15.7 (6.38) l/h, and its elimination half-life was 
9.3 (1.72) h. The t1/2 for M1-IVA and M6-IVA were 11.3 (2.12) h and 14.4 (6.14) h, respectively. 
From the original dossier, it is known that ivacaftor is mainly eliminated as metabolites via the faeces, 
with negligible renal excretion as parent compound. 
Pharmacokinetics of TEZ metabolites has been investigated to a reasonable extent. TEZ metabolites 
M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ have a t1/2 that is comparable to that of TEZ. Under steady-state, for 
Assessment report

Page 37/144 
 
 
 
 
 
each of the metabolites, exposure to M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ is approximately 1.5-fold higher 
than for TEZ. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Exposure to tezacaftor (administered alone or in combination with ivacaftor) increase in an 
approximately dose-proportional manner with increasing doses from 10 mg to 300 mg once daily. The 
pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are generally linear with respect to time or dose ranging from 25 mg to 
250 mg (Kalydeco SmPC). Considering the lack of relevant PK interaction between ivacaftor and 
tezacaftor, this is expected also to be the case when given in combination with tezacaftor. 
The accumulation ratio of 1.5-3 for tezacaftor when given once daily is in line with the t1/2 of 
approximately 155 h. Accumulation ratio’s for the tezacaftor metabolites are higher (ranging from 2.9 
to 18 for the different metabolites), since tmax for these metabolites is later than for tezacaftor (12-72 
hours), with comparable t1/2 of approximately 130 hours. For this reason, the relative amount of 
tezacaftor metabolites increases under steady state conditions as compared to single dose, exposure 
being approximately 1.5 higher than that of tezacaftor. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function: A dedicated study in subjects with renal impairment has not been performed 
during the clinical development of tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. This is also the case for 
ivacaftor as a single agent. Less than 1% of the administrated tezacaftor dose was excreted in urine as 
unchanged drug. Similarly, there was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine 
(6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine) with less than 0.01% as unchanged parent 
(Kalydeco SmPC). Therefore, renal clearance is likely to play a minimal role in the elimination of 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor, and therefore no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to 
moderate renal impairment. In the absence of clinical data, caution is recommended when 
administering tezacaftor and ivacaftor in combination therapy to patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance less than or equal to 15 to 29 mL/min) or with end-stage renal disease. 
Impaired hepatic function: The majority of tezacaftor is excreted from the body via faeces following 
oral administration and is primarily metabolized via dehydrogenation, oxidation, and glucuronidation in 
the liver. Ivacaftor is also predominately cleared via a hepatic route. Based on the results of the 
hepatic impairment study with ivacaftor alone, a dose reduction (from 150 mg q12h to 150 mg qd) 
during ivacaftor monotherapy is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
(Kalydeco SmPC). The impact of mild to moderate hepatic impairment on tezacaftor/ivacaftor exposure 
in vivo was assessed in subjects with Child-Pugh Class B liver disease (study 009). Based on results 
from this study, which showed higher exposure of tezacaftor (36% for AUC, 20% based on the total 
increase in active TEZ/TEZ-M1 exposure) and ivacaftor (52% for AUC) in subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment, the company proposed that the dose for patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced to a single tablet of tezacaftor 100mg/ivacaftor 
150 mg once daily. The evening dose of 150 mg ivacaftor should not be taken as also reflected in the 
SmPC. The impact of mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) on the PK of TEZ/IVA has not been 
studied, but the increase in exposure is expected to be less than that observed in subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dose adjustment is deemed necessary for patients with 
mild hepatic impairment. Similarly, the impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) on the PK 
of tezacaftor/ivacaftor has not been studied, but the increase in exposure is expected to be more than 
that observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. The dose for patients with severe hepatic 
impairment should be reduced to a single tablet of tezacaftor 100mg/ivacaftor 150 mg once daily (or 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018

less frequently). The evening dose of 150 mg ivacaftor should not be taken as also reflected in the 
SmPC. Caution is recommended when tezacaftor/ivacaftor is used in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment.  
Gender: An exploratory assessment in Study 001 suggested no sex-related effect on TEZ PK. In the 
population PK analysis, female sex was a statistically significant covariate (13% increase in TEZ CL/F; 
95% CI: 7%, 19%); however, the effect is not considered clinically meaningful. Regarding ivacaftor as 
a single agent, females had a similar CL/F when compared to males, with a point estimate of 1.03 
(95% CI: 0.920, 1.14). 
Race: The effect of race on PK of tezacaftor could not be adequately evaluated due to the small 
number of non-White subjects. The information on different races is considered to be very limited, as 
reflected in the SmPCs.  
Weight: 
Tezacaftor: In the population PK analysis, body weight was a predictor of variability in tezacaftor 
clearance. Tezacaftor CL/F was 1.32 L/h (95% CI: 1.19, 1.47) for a 70-kg subject, using allometric 
scaling with a fixed coefficient of 0.75. Using this scaling, tezacaftor CL/F for a 40-kg subject would be 
34.3% lower than that for a 70-kg subject.. No clinically relevant effects on efficacy or safety are 
expected and therefore no dose adjustment based on weight is deemed necessary. 
Ivacaftor: In the IVA popPK model, body weight was the only significant predictor of IVA disposition 
(Report K199). No dose modification based on weight was deemed necessary for subjects aged 12 
years or older.  
Age: only a low number of elderly patients 65-74 years of age (13 patients) were included in the 
clinical studies conducted for tezacaftor/ivacaftor. This is also the case for ivacaftor as a single agent. 
Overall, age does not appear to be a relevant covariate in the pop-PK study. The recommended dose of 
tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor is the same for adolescents and adult subjects. Adolescent 
subjects aged 12 to less than 18 years were enrolled in the clinical studies and PK samples collected 
from them. A population PK approach was used to evaluate the effect of age on TEZ PK parameters.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Substrate in vitro 
Based on in vitro data, CYP3A4/5 are the main CYP isoforms involved in tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
metabolism. Co-administration with CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers may therefore result in change in 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor exposure. With regard to drug transporters, in vitro, tezacaftor is a substrate 
for the uptake transporter OATP1B1 as well as for efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP. Tezacaftor is no 
substrate for OATP1B3. M1-tezacaftor is substrate for P-gp. However, exposure to tezacaftor is not 
expected to be affected significantly by concomitant inhibitors of OATP1B1, P-gp, or BCRP due to its 
high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact.  
Inhibition/induction in vitro 
Based on in vitro data, tezacaftor and its metabolites are predicted not to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 and they are not expected to induce CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. With regard to drug transporters, tezacaftor does not inhibit transporters P-gp, 
BCRP, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. Only limited inhibition of OATP1B1 (IC50 3.2 μM) was 
observed in vitro. Based on in vitro data, ivacaftor has the potential to inhibit CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and P-

gp. No induction was noted by ivacaftor and its metabolites. In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is 
not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or P-gp 
Effect of co-administered drugs on tezacaftor/ivacaftor in vivo 
In vivo, co-administration of strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole caused a substantial increase in the 
exposure of TEZ (4-fold) and IVA (16 fold) when administered in combination. Therefore, a reduction 
in the dose of TEZ and IVA combination therapy is recommended for co-administration with strong 
CYP3A inhibitors.  Using a PBPK model, the effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors fluconazole, verapamil 
and erythromycin on TEZ exposure was investigated. The PBPK model is considered sufficiently 
validated, comparing simulated exposure data with actual TEZ exposure data with or without 
itraconazole and ciprofloxacin.   Based on the results of these PBPK analyses, in the presence of 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, tezacaftor steady-state AUC and Cmax are predicted to increase 2.1-fold 
and 1.7-fold with fluconazole, 1.7- and 1.4-fold with verapamil and 2.6- and 2.0-fold with 
erythromycin, respectively.  
Further, PBPK simulations with the proposed dose of tezacaftor (i.e., 100 mg TEZ every other day) in 
the presence of moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, sufficiently assure adequate exposure to tezacaftor in 
the presence of these 3 different moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4. 
In a previous ivacaftor study from the ivacaftor application (Study 770-010), multiple-dose co-
administration of ivacaftor and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole increased ivacaftor exposure 
approximately 3-fold and increased M1-IVA exposure approximately 2-fold. These results indicate that 
fluconazole would cause a clinically relevant increase in TEZ and IVA exposures. Therefore, a reduction 
in the dose of TEZ and IVA combination therapy is recommended for co-administration with moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors. For ivacaftor, the dose reduction was already known from the Kalydeco dossier. In 
case of co-administration of the CYP3A4 inhibitor ciprofloxacin, no clinically relevant increase was 
noted for TEZ and IVA. Therefore, no dose adjustment is needed upon ciprofloxacin co-medication. 
Co-administration of the strong CYP3A inducer rifampicin substantially decreased ivacaftor exposure 
(Study 770-009), which is consistent with ivacaftor being a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Although not 
investigated, tezacaftor exposure would also be expected to decrease with co-administration of strong 
CYP3A inducers, although it is not a sensitive CYP3A substrate based on the smaller (<5-fold) effect of 
itraconazole on tezacaftor compared to ivacaftor. Nevertheless, co-administration of medicinal products 
that strongly induce CYP3A (e.g., rifampicin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and 
St. John's wort) with the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor are not recommended as they may 
decrease the tezacaftor and ivacaftor exposures and limit the effectiveness of the combination. These 
recommendations are consistent with the labelling for ivacaftor monotherapy. 
TEZ/IVA co-administered with drugs in vivo 
Administration of TEZ/IVA did not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of CYP3A4 substrate 
midazolam. These results indicate that no dose adjustment is necessary when co-administering 
TEZ/IVA with a CYP3A substrate. Administration of TEZ/IVA increased P-gp substrate digoxin exposure 
approximately 1.3-fold compared with digoxin administered alone. These results are similar to the 
effect of IVA alone on digoxin (Study 770-016) and suggest a weak inhibition of P-gp by TEZ/IVA. 
Caution and appropriate monitoring are recommended when co-administering TEZ/IVA with sensitive 
P-gp substrates, e.g., digoxin, cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or other medicinal 
products that are substrates of P-gp with narrow therapeutic windows. No significant DDI between 
ethinyl estradiol (EE) and norethindrone estradiol (NE) and TEZ/IVA was observed when the oral 
contraceptive was co-administrated with TEZ/IVA in healthy subjects. The results are consistent with 
DDI results between IVA and oral contraceptives in healthy subjects (Study 770-005). These results 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 40/144 
 
 
 
 
 
indicate that co-administration with TEZ/IVA is not expected to reduce the effectiveness of hormonal 
contraceptives. Because based on in vitro studies IVA and M1-IVA may have the potential to inhibit 
CYP2C9, caution and monitoring is recommended when substrates of this isozyme with narrow 
therapeutic index (such as warfarin) are co-administered with TEZ/IVA.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The claimed indication for Kalydeco 150 mg tablets in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor 
is for the treatment of subjects (adult and adolescents) with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del 
and for the treatment of subjects who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and who have a 
certain, pre-specified second mutation of residual function of the CFTR gene. Tezacaftor is said to be a 
CFTR corrector that facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of normal or multiple mutant 
forms of CFTR to increase the amount of functional CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface, resulting 
in increased chloride transport. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that enhances the channel-open 
probability (or gating) of CFTR at the cell surface to increase chloride transport. For ivacaftor to 
function CFTR protein must be present at the cell surface. Ivacaftor can potentiate the CFTR protein 
delivered to the cell surface by tezacaftor, leading to a further enhancement of chloride transport than 
either agent alone.  
Two in vitro systems have been used to support the two indications above mentioned. In human 
bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) cells, which are derived from CF-patient donors, the functional impact 
and response to CFTR modulators for both CFTR alleles that the patient had are evaluated. Because 
HBE cells are primary cell lines, it is not possible to obtain HBE cell lines expressing all CFTR mutations. 
Therefore, Fisher Rat Thyroid (FRT) cell lines were engineered to express a single CFTR form to study 
TEZ/IVA-responsiveness of less prevalent mutations, including residual function and gating mutations. 
In the FRT system, CFTR function is driven by the type of mutation that is introduced and reflects on 
the contribution of only a single CFTR form, as compared with HBE cells in which function of CFTR 
represents the contributions from two alleles.  
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology  
Effects on Sweat Chloride: Sweat chloride was included in the Phase II studies, Study 101 and 103, 
and in the Phase 3 studies, Study 106 and Study 108, as a measure of the effect of 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor on CFTR activity.  The studies included CF patients with different mutations. 
Patients with CF heterozygous for F508del/G551D: In study 101 (Group 7), the effect of TEZ 100 mg 
qd/IVA 150 mg q12h was assessed in F/G551D subjects who were taking physician-prescribed 
Kalydeco (IVA 150 mg q12h) before enrolling in the study. Subjects were randomized to receive TEZ 
100 mg qd or placebo, and all subjects continued taking Kalydeco. For the tezacaftor/ivacaftor group, 
the within-group decrease in sweat chloride was -7.02 mmol/L (P = 0.053) compared to 10.18 mmol/L 
(P= 0.1066) for Kalydeco (placebo group) alone; the difference in sweat chloride relative was -17.20 
mmol/L (P = 0.0238). The proportion of subjects with ≥10 mmol decrease in sweat chloride at the 
Assessment report

average through Day 28 was 0 subjects (Placebo + Kalydeco) and 4 (30.8%) subjects for tezacaftor + 
ivacaftor.  
Patients with CF homozygous for F508del (F/F): The changes in sweat chloride were measured in 
patients with CF homozygous for F508del in 3 studies.  
In study 101, different doses of tezacaftor alone of 10, 30, 100, and 150 mg once daily and in 
combination with ivacaftor were tested.  Ivacaftor 150 mg twice daily was selected because it is the 
approved Kalydeco dose for patients aged 12 years and older, and there is no clinically meaningful 
drug-drug interaction between tezacaftor and ivacaftor.   
A reduction in the mean sweat chloride compared to baseline was observed in all groups, with the 
exception of tezacaftor 10 mg once daily. The largest effect is seen with tezacaftor 100 mg either as 
monotherapy or combination therapy. In the monotherapy groups, the least square (LS) means 
absolute change in sweat chloride for the monotherapy ranged from + 3.92  to -20.43 mmol/L. For the 
combined therapy, the least square mean absolute change ranged from -2.63 to -6.04 mmol/L. 
In a responder analysis the proportion of subjects with ≥10 mmol decrease in sweat chloride through 
Day 28 was 2 (11.8%) subjects for tezacaftor 100 mg once daily/ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours, 5 
(27.8%) for subjects for tezacaftor 50 mg q12h/ivacaftor 150 mg q12h.  
Study 103 was a multicenter, 2-part study in subjects 18 years of age or older with CF, homozygous 
for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Two doses were included, tezacaftor doses of 50 mg q12h (Group 1) 
and 100 mg qd (Group 2) both combined with ivacaftor 150 mg q12h.  
The within-group LS mean for average absolute change level from baseline in sweat chloride through 
Week 12 was -4.7 mmol/L (P = 0.0163) for Group VX-661 100 mg qd/ IVA 150 mg q12h (n=15), and 
-10.6 mmol/L (P = 0.0011) for Group VX-661 50 mg q12h/IVA 150 mg q12h (n=6), and 1.9 mmol/L  
(P = 0.2872) for Overall Placebo (n=18). The LS mean treatment difference for Group  VX-661 100 mg 
qd/ IVA 150 mg q12h versus Overall Placebo was -6.5 mmol/L (P = 0.0161). The LS mean absolute 
change from baseline in sweat chloride level was -6.6 mmol/L (P = 0.0002) during the 40-week OLE 
Phase. 
In the clinical study 106 in patients with CF homozygous for F508del, the difference in sweat chloride 
compared to placebo was −9.1 mmol/L (P<0.0001) and −10.1 mmol/L (-11.4, -8.8) (P<0.0001) after 
4 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment, respectively. 
Patients heterozygous for F508del and a residual function mutation (F/RF): In Study VX14-661-108, 
the LS mean treatment difference versus placebo for the absolute change in sweat chloride from study 
baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was -9.5 mmol/L (P<0.0001) for TEZ/IVA and -4.5 
mmol/L (P<0.0001) for IVA. The LS mean treatment difference for the absolute change in sweat 
chloride from study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was -5.1 mmol/L in favour of 
TEZ/IVA compared to IVA (P<0.0001). 
Secondary pharmacology  
QT/QTC Evaluation: Potential QTc prolongation has been evaluated in Study VX15-661-010 in 116 
healthy volunteers. Study 010 was a randomized, active and placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel 
arm, study, conducted in 2-part (Parts A and B). The objective of Part A was designed to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of TEZ; the objective of Part B was to evaluate the 
effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of TEZ compared with placebo on the QTc interval.  
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 42/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) was used for testing the treatment difference of 
the ΔQTcF between the therapeutic dose and placebo was tested using. Prolongation was declared 
negative if the upper limit of the 1-sided 95% CI for the mean difference of the therapeutic dose 
versus placebo fell below 10 msec for every time point. In Part A, no subject had an increase of QTcF 
>30 msec. The upper limit of the 2-sided 90% CI for the mean difference of the 100-mg dose versus 
placebo fell below 10 msec at every time point. In Part B, no subject had an increase of QTcF >60 
msec. The upper limits of the 2-sided 90% CIs for the mean difference in ΔQTcF between the VX-661 
300-mg dose and placebo, fell below 10 msec at every time point for Day 14. The positive control 
(moxifloxacin) behaved appropriately (positive QTc signal); the study had assay sensitivity to allow for 
conclusions on QTc prolongation.  
There were no clinically relevant trends in standard ECG parameters, including no clinically significant 
increases or decreases over time in mean heart rate in subjects receiving TEZ 200-mg and 300-mg 
doses, compared to subjects receiving placebo or moxifloxacin. There were no obvious differences 
between the therapeutic and supratherapeutic TEZ doses. 
2.4.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Population PK analyses were conducted on pooled data from Studies 101, 103, 106, 107, and 108. A 
2-compartment popPK model with absorption driven by a sequential zero-order/ first-order process 
was used to describe the PK of TEZ. PopPK analyses for IVA were conducted with a prior popPK model.  
Nonlinear mixed-effects models were developed to describe the exposure-response (PK/PD) 
relationship for the absolute change in ppFEV1 and sweat chloride for F/F subjects. Exposure-response 
(E-R) analyses used clinical data from Studies 101, 103, and 106. The exposure-response (E-R) 
modelling incorporated all TEZ monotherapy data from the Phase 2 Study 101. In addition to the on-
treatment data, post-treatment washout data (the largest amount of which was collected in Study 101 
following the 4-week treatment period) also contributed to the E-R analysis. Due to the long terminal 
elimination of TEZ, these data provided additional response data for exposures similar to the TEZ 10 
mg qd dose. Due to limited IVA dose-ranging data, the contribution of IVA was modelled as a binary 
effect.  
During evaluation, additional comparative TEZ versus TEZ/IVA exposure-response data (for ppFEV1 
and SwCl) were requested by the CHMP for study 101 alone, excluding TEZ/IVA washout data as a 
surrogate for TEZ monotherapy exposure. Figures 3-4 show the difference between TEZ/IVA and TEZ 
based on data from study 101, 103 and 106 (grey colour) and with only data from study 101 (blue) for 
ppFEV 1 and sweat chloride respectively.

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics   
The pharmacokinetics of tezacaftor (and ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor) as well as its major 
metabolites were investigated both in healthy subjects and CF patients. For the bioanalysis, non-chiral 
assays were used. Analytical methods for tezacaftor and its metabolites as well as for ivacaftor and its 
metabolites were adequately validated, with accuracy, specificity and stability meeting appropriate 
requirements.  
The dose advice for TEZ in the presence of various inhibitors of CYP3A4 was supported by a PBPK 
model. The PBPK model-predicted TEZ and M1 plasma-concentration-time curves in the absence and 
presence of itraconazole or fluconazole, as well as the prediction of the t1/2 were presented. The PBPK 
model was validated for baseline tezacaftor PK and the combination of tezacaftor and the strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole as well as the mild CYP3A4 inhibitor ciprofloxacin. This is considered 
sufficient by the CHMP. In addition, the MAH provided further qualifications for the PBPK model, i.e., 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 45/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other substrates have been studied with itraconazole and fluconazole in the platform, e.g., midazolam, 
simvastatin, and zolpidem.  
However, the CHMP considered that insufficient information was provided on the effect of genetic 
variations related to pharmacokinetics. Both TEZ and IVA are mainly metabolised by CYP3A4. For this 
enzyme, a relevant and relatively abundant variant with reduced activity has been reported, i.e., 
CYP3A4 *22. At present, it remains unclear if high ratio’s in trough levels for TEZ and IVA and their 
metabolites which were identified could be related to the occurrence of e.g. a CYP3A4*22 genotype in 
the patients involved. Instead, the variation in Ctrough and the lack of concordance between the 
deviation from average levels for TEZ and IVA in the same patient was used as argument that 
CYP3A4*22 is not important for the high ratio’s that were observed at certain occasions. Such 
conclusion is not possible based on the provided data, since the MAH did not demonstrate that the 
CYP3A4*22 genotype indeed was present in the patients at stake nor if there were other CYP3A4*22 
patients in the study population. Therefore, in the absence of such data, and bearing in mind that dose 
modifications are proposed for TEZ/IVA in combination with moderate (and strong) inhibitors of 
CYP3A4, a potential effect of CYP3A4 variants on exposure to TEZ and IVA cannot be excluded. 
Therefore, the MAH committed in the post authorisation phase to either provide the CYP3A4 genotype 
of the patients included in the already submitted clinical studies, followed by further analysis of 
potential relationship between exposure (AUC, Cmax and Ctrough) and genotype, or provide additional 
in vivo data in healthy subjects, comparing exposure (AUC, Cmax and Ctrough) to TEZ and IVA in 
patients with CYP3A4*22 genotype and subjects with CYP3A4 wild-type phenotype.  
With respect to hepatic impairment, based on results from Study 009, which showed higher exposure 
of TEZ (36% increase for AUC, 20% based on the total increase in active TEZ/TEZ-M1 exposure) and 
IVA (52% increase for AUC) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, the dose for patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced to 1 TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150 mg 
tablet once daily. The evening dose of 150 mg IVA should not be taken. With respect to IVA, the 
proposed dose is in line with the dose advised for IVA as single agent. This is reflected in the SmPC, 
section 4.2. The lack of a dose-adjustment for TEZ in case of moderate hepatic impairment is agreed 
by the CHMP.  
The TEZ exposures in different weight categories are considered to be within the therapeutic window, 
and no clinically relevant effects on efficacy or safety are expected. The total number of patients over 
65 years of age included in the clinical studies is limited. No patients over 75 years of age have been 
included. Overall, age does not appear to be a relevant covariate in the pop-PK study N021. Based on 
the overview of the number of adolescents per study, and the plot showing simulated AUC vs age 
based on the pop-PK Study N021 model, comparing TEZ exposure in the age range 12-17 and >17 
years of age, no clinically relevant increase in TEZ exposure is observed in adolescents as compared to 
adult patients. Further, exposure to IVA in adolescents, when given in combination with 100 mg TEZ is 
comparable to that in adults. 
No changes were proposed for section 5.2 of the SmPC of Kalydeco. The MAH was requested to further 
substantiate this approach by providing PK parameters of ivacaftor alone and in combination with 
tezacaftor and discuss the clinical relevance (or lack of it) in view of these PK parameters. Based on 
actual study data (interstudy comparisons), IVA and M1-IVA Cmax and AUC0-12h were approximately 
30% higher after administration of TEZ/IVA than after administration of IVA alone. This increase is 
somewhat higher than reported based on the Pop-PK model (17% increase). However, this increase is 
not expected to result in clinically relevant changes in safety of IVA, as compared to the situation 
where IVA is given as single agent. Therefore, the approach taken for the clinical pharmacology

program of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in which most of the PK attributes of ivacaftor have been assumed to 
be similar to those of the single ivacaftor agent is considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
Based on current regulatory requirements, the potential for drug-drug interactions should be evaluated 
for a new drug and the relevant metabolites. The MAH has not fulfilled this requirement with respect to 
induction of CYP1A2 and 2B6 for M1-TEZ and M2-TEZ, based on the assumption that nowadays the 
likelihood that TEZ/IVA is combined with a relevant drug is low. However, it cannot be excluded that in 
the future new drugs will be marketed that indeed may be combined with TEZ/IVA and are substrate 
for a relevant enzyme. The MAH has initiated an in vitro induction study regarding potential induction 
of CYP2B6 by M1-TEZ and of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 by M2-TEZ, results of which will be submitted post-
approval. This is agreed by the CHMP. 
The possible DDI between TEZ and M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ metabolites and warfarin due to 
displacement of warfarin from protein binding sites might not be clinically relevant due to the low 
hepatic extraction ratio of warfarin. Since monitoring of INR is already advised in the SmPC due to the 
fact that ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9, this is considered sufficient.  
With regard to drug transporters, TEZ appears to inhibit OATP1B1 in vitro (IC50 3.2 μM). Since the 
TEZ I/IC50 for OATP1B1 is higher than the criteria of 0.02 and co-administration of an OATP1B1 
substrate drug in the future cannot be excluded, an in vivo study investigating the potential DDI 
between TEZ/IVA and an OATP1B1 substrate should be conducted. Further, as requested in the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1) and since future 
combination with OCT1, MATE and BSEP substrate drugs cannot be excluded, the MAH has initiated an 
in vitro study investigating the inhibitory effect of TEZ and its metabolites on OCT1 (SLC22A1), MATE1 
(SLC47A1) and MATE2 (SLC47A) and BSEP (ABCB11) results of which will be submitted post-approval. 
Finally, an in vitro test for substrate characteristics towards BCRP is considered a basic requirement for 
new drugs like ivacaftor (in combination with tezacaftor). Effects of BCRP on IVA metabolites M1-IVA 
and M6-IVA cannot be excluded. Therefore, investigations elucidating whether ivacaftor and its 
metabolites are substrate for BCRP have been initiated by the MAH and results will be submitted post-
approval, which is agreed by the CHMP. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The proposed mechanism of action is based on in vitro studies in two systems, human bronchial 
epithelial cells (HBE) cells and stably transfected Fisher Rat Tyroid (FTR) cells that express a single 
CFTR mutant to study the response of less prevalent mutations to tezacaftor, ivacaftor and the 
combination. A search has been done in CFTR2 (www.cftr2.org) for all the CFTR mutations with 
residual function that are being proposed for approval. The following is a brief summary of the 
findings: 
• 
 Out of the 25 residual function mutations that were initially proposed for approval, E193K-, 
K1060T-, and A1067T-CFTR mutations cannot be found in CFTR2. Clinical data are either not available 
from study 108.  
• 
 R74W- (complex allele), D110E-, D579G-, S977F-, F1052-, R1070W- (complex allele), 
D1257H-, and D1270N-CFTR mutations are mutations of varying clinical consequences. The remaining 
ones are expected to result in CF when combined with another CF-causing variant.  
• 
 No clinical data are available from study 108 for subjects carrying the following mutations, 
E56K-, R74W-, D110E-, E193K-, F1052V-, K1060T-, A1067T-, F1074L-, and D1270N-CFTR. Very 
limited clinical data are available for other mutations such as D110H and R117C.   
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018

• 
 For the five splice mutations proposed sufficient clinical data are available from study 108 with 
the exception of E831X (n=1, ivacaftor-treated subject) and 711+3A->G (n=2). All the splice 
mutations considered are expected to result in CF when combined with another CF-causing variant. 
None of these mutations could be assessed in vitro in the FRT cell system.  
Change in sweat chloride (as a biomarker of CFTR activity) in response to treatment with tezacaftor 
alone or in combination with ivacaftor was investigated in the phase 2 studies 101 and 103, and in the 
phase 3 studies 106 (subjects homozygous F508del), and 108 (subjects heterozygous for F508del and 
a residual function mutation (F/RF). Study 101 included also subjects with CF who are heterozygous 
F508del/G551D.  
TEZ 100 mg qd//IVA 150 mg q12h has shown a reduction (improvement) in mean sweat chloride 
levels in all investigated populations. In the two pivotal studies 106 and 108 the reduction in sweat 
chloride observed was in the same range as observed with Orkambi. In study 108 in subjects 
heterozygous for F508del, the reduction in sweat chloride concentration was also higher with TEZ/IVA 
than IVA supporting the combination. The reduction is considered relevant for patients with F/F 
mutations from the perspective that mutations with residual function have sweat chloride levels 
approximately 10% lower (improved) than severe mutations and have disease manifestations that are 
either less severe or demonstrate a delay in onset compared with the most severe mutations.    
TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h was also compared with different doses of TEZ monotherapy. For 
sweat chloride TEZ monotherapy at 100 mg and 150 mg qd appeared more effective than the 
combination at reducing sweat chloride. Inconsistences are acknowledged between the combination 
and the mono-component tezacaftor and also between the TEZ monotherapy groups. Evaluation of 
treatment differences versus pooled placebo across cohorts demonstrated also inconsistency between 
sweat chloride and FEV1 data. Overall, however the results for ppFEV1 demonstrated quite consistently 
a greater effect for TEZ/IVA combination with the highest response for TEZ 100 mg qd /IVA 150 mg 
q12h and a clinically relevant difference with TEZ 100 mg.  
Results of population PK/PD analyses suggested an exposure-response (E-R) relationship for change in 
ppFEV1 as a function of TEZ exposure at a fixed IVA dose of 150 mg q12h, and estimated TEZ 100 mg 
qd/IVA 150 mg q12 to be near the maximum achievable response. The E-R analyses indicated that the 
combination has an added value over monotherapy of tezacaftor in ppFEV1 in subjects with the F/F 
genotype. The combining data from studies 101, 103 and 106, for E-R analysis, comparing TEZ 
monotherapy versus TEZ/IVA in combination was considered not valid, given that studies 103 and 106 
lacked a TEZ monotherapy comparator arm. To account for this, post-treatment washout data from 
TEZ/IVA treated patients were included in the model in order to provide additional response data for 
exposures similar to the TEZ 10 mg qd dose. This was not considered acceptable and therefore 
additional E-R analyses were provided on request of the CHMP. In the re-analysis, the results for 
ppFEV1 were confirmed; 44% greater median change from baseline ppFEV1 with TEZ/IVA compared 
with TEZ (versus 60% difference in the previous analysis). The 95% CI was extremely wide however: 
−25% to 373%. The model predicted a within-group ppFEV1 response of 3.2 percentage points (95% 
CI: 2.2, 4.4) in Study 101, consistent with the observed within-group response of 3.4 percentage 
points (95% CI: 2.7, 4.0) in study 106. The re-analysed E-R data for sweat chloride again demonstrate 
a greater reduction in sweat chloride with TEZ monotherapy versus TEZ/IVA. For sweat chloride, the 
TEZ/IVA sweat chloride response in Study 106 was under-predicted using the model developed on the 
data from Study 101, i.e.  -5.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -6.9,-3.4) whereas the improvement observed in 
Study 106 was -9.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -10.9, -8.9). Thus overall, the model, within the limitations, 
appears to be more accurate for FEV1 than for sweat chloride. This is consistent with the known 
variability in measurements of sweat chloride.

EMA/636932/2018

The interpretation of the results of study 101 is limited by the 4-week duration of the study 101.    
The effect of IVA in subjects with the F/F genotype was been investigated before (study 104). A small, 
not relevant difference in the adjusted mean absolute change from baseline for sweat chloride values 
of -2.87 mmol/L (P = 0.0384) has been observed.  
For the secondary pharmacology, potential QTc prolongation of tezacaftor has been evaluated in Study 
VX15-661-010 in 116 healthy volunteers. As the study had assay sensitivity, the results allow to 
conclude on the potential for QTc prolongation. As at all time points the treatments differences fell 
below the predefined 10 msec and normality can be assumed as the median and mean are almost 
equal for almost all time points, it is concluded that tezacaftor at supratherapeutic dose did not prolong 
the QTcF interval in healthy subjects. The conduct of a dedicated QTc study with only TEZ is considered 
justified because tezacaftor has only a modest effect on the exposure of IVA. Since IVA has been 
shown not to prolong the QTc interval at supratherapeutic doses of 450 mg q12h, the increased IVA 
exposure in combination with TEZ is not considered relevant with respect to the probability to influence 
the QTc. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In the pharmacodynamic investigation of tezacaftor monotherapy and TEZ/IVA combination, 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor showed a consistent positive effect on sweat chloride in the investigated subjects 
with CF homozygous for F508del or heterozygous F508del/G551D or heterozygous for F508del and a 
residual function mutation (F/RF). However, the inferior effect of TEZ/IVA compared with TEZ on sweat 
chloride in study 101 is not completely understood. The demonstrated inconsistencies in study 101 are 
still not sufficient reason to exclude the possibility that TEZ as monotherapy may have clinically 
relevant pharmacodynamic activity, particularly when there are also discrepancies within the in vitro 
data and there is evident complexity in the mechanisms involved in correcting CFTR function. 
Therefore the possibility that tezacaftor may be beneficial on its own in subjects with F508del-CFTR 
cannot be confidently excluded. However, this ongoing uncertainty is set against i) the high level of 
unmet need in F508del homozygous patients who cannot tolerate LUM/IVA or where LUM/IVA is 
inadvisable; and ii) the  demonstration of superiority for TEZ/IVA over placebo in homozygous F508del 
patients resulting in relevant improvements in this population. The pharmacokinetics of tezacaftor and 
ivacaftor has been investigated to a reasonable degree. Several concerns will be resolved via post-
authorisation measures, which have been committed to by the MAH in a letter of recommendations. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical package for TEZ/IVA to be administered together with IVA, comprises of six clinical studies 
in total, consisting of one phase 2 PD study,  one phase 2 dose finding study, three placebo-controlled 
phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and one long term open label study evaluating safety and efficacy. 
The phase 2 PD study (study 101) is handled as a dose ranging study and described in this section. 
Dose finding studies: Study VX11-661-101 (study 101) evaluated TEZ monotherapy and TEZ/IVA co-
therapy in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for the F508de-CFTR mutation or 
heterozygous for F508del and have G551D mutation. Study VX13-661-103 (Study 103) evaluated 
different doses of TEZ/IVA with long-duration of dosing (52 weeks in total).  
Efficacy and safety studies: Each of the 5 phase III studies CF in patients aged 12 years and older 
enrolled a different patient population: 
•  Study 103: subjects homozygous for F508del (F/F)  
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 49/144 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Study 106: subjects homozygous for F508del (F/F)  
•  Study 108: subjects heterozygous for F508del and a residual function mutation (F/RF).  
•  Study 107: subjects heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation that is 
nonresponsive to TEZ and/or IVA (F/MF).  
•  Study 110: subjects with CF who are homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR 
mutation and who participated in Studies VX13-661-103, VX14-661-106, VX14-661-107, 
VX14-661-108, VX-14-661-109, VX14-661-111, or other Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 
(Vertex) studies investigating TEZ in combination with IVA. 
Studies 106 and 108 are the core efficacy studies supporting the proposed indication. In vitro response 
to TEZ/IVA provides evidence of response of eligible mutations without clinical data available. Study 
107 was stopped because results of a planned interim analysis met the pre-defined futility rule. Study 
110 is an open label uncontrolled extension study to support durability of efficacy and safety in 
subjects who completed Studies 103, 106, 107, 108 and 109. Study 110 was ongoing at the time of 
filing. During the evaluation, the MAH communicated to the CHMP that Study 109 in patients with 
F508del/CFTR-gating mutations failed to meet its primary endpoint and therefore clinical superiority for 
TEZ/IVA versus IVA could not be concluded. As a consequence, during the evaluation, gating 
mutations (including R117H) were excluded from the originally proposed indication.   
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Two Phase 2 studies, Study VX11-661-101 (Study 101) and Study VX13-661-103 (Study 103), 
evaluated different doses of TEZ monotherapy and TEZ/IVA combination therapy in CF subjects with 
homozygous or heterozygous for F508del mutation. 
Study 101 was a randomized, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the 
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and safety of TEZ and TEZ/IVA at multiple 
dose levels in adult subjects with F/F genotype and in adult and adolescent subjects with F/G551D. 
Subjects were randomised across a range of dose combinations as shown in the following table.

The primary efficacy variable is the absolute change in sweat chloride (mmol/L) from baseline through 
Day 28 (analysed based on an MMRM). Other endpoints included FEV1 (L), ppFEV1 (value, and 
absolute and relative change from baseline [to each visit and average through Day 28]. A model to 
assess the off treatment period was also be produced and analysed the change from Day 28 through 
Day 56), CFQ-R.  
Results  
Overall, 194 subjects were randomised in study 101. Four subjects discontinued the study before 
receiving their first dose of study drug; therefore, the FAS included 190 subjects: 172 in Groups 1 to 
6d (33 subjects in the placebo group, 33 subjects in the VX-661 monotherapy group, and 106 subjects 
in the VX-661/IVA group) and 18 subjects in Group 7 (4 subjects in the Placebo + Kalydeco group and 
14 subjects in the VX-661 + Kalydeco group).  
A total of 179 (94.2%) subjects completed study drug treatment, and 185 (97.4%) subjects completed 
the study/Safety Follow-Up Visit. The most common reason for discontinuation from study drug 
treatment across all treatment groups was an AE (5 [2.6%] subjects overall). 
In Groups 1 to 6d, 2 (6.1%) subjects in the placebo group, 1 (3.0%) subject in the VX-661 
monotherapy group, and 8 (7.5%) subjects in the VX-661/IVA group discontinued study treatment. In 
Group 7, all 18 subjects completed study drug treatment and completed the study.  
CF patients 18 years or older with the F508del/F508del genotype (F/F) 
Table below summarizes the absolute change from baseline through Day 28 in sweat chloride (mmol/L)

Increases in ppFEV1 for the VX-661 monotherapy groups were variable and not dose-dependent. The 
increases for the VX-661/IVA groups were dose-dependent, with the highest increase for the proposed 
dose TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h. The group that showed the greatest improvement in absolute 
change in ppFEV1 compared to placebo was TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h (3.89 %, P = 0.0101). 
No additional benefit was observed at a higher TEZ dose of 150 mg qd/ IVA 150 mg q12h (ppFEV1 
3.75 %; P =0.00125). 
These results were consistent with the Phase 2/3 PK/PD analysis showing that exposures observed with 
the clinical dose of TEZ (100 mg qd) were on the flat part of dose-response curve.  
CF patients 12 years or older with the F508del/G551D genotype (study 101) (Group 7, n=18 patients)   
The TEZ/IVA group had increases in mean ppFEV1 of 4.60 % (P = 0.0120; Day 28; within-group), with 
a treatment difference of 3.20 % compared to placebo (P = 0.3646). Table below summarises the 
absolute change from baseline through day 28 in ppFEV1 by MMRM (Full Analysis Set). 
Table 12 
In study 103 (18 years of age or older with the F/F genotype), subjects were enrolled into 2 groups. 
Within each group, the subjects were randomized to active treatment or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. 
Group 1: Active: VX-661 50 mg q12h + IVA 150 mg q12h or placebo 
Group 2: Active: VX-661 100 mg qd + IVA 150 mg q12h or placebo 
The placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind part of the study evaluated safety, efficacy, and PK 
of TEZ/IVA when administered for 12 weeks followed by an open-label extension of TEZ/IVA 
administered for 40 weeks. The within-group LS mean for average absolute change from baseline in 
ppFEV1 through Week 12 was 3.0 % (95% CI: 0.4, 5.5; P = 0.0226) for TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150 mg,  0.9 
% (95% CI: −3.1, 5.0; P = 0.6437) for TEZ 50 mg/IVA 150 mg, and 0.9 % (95% CI: -1.7, 3.5; P = 
0.4801) for Overall Placebo. The LS mean treatment difference for TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150 mg versus 
placebo was 2.1 % (95% CI: -1.5, 5.7; P = 0.2536).

An alternative regimen with the same total daily dose of TEZ was also evaluated in Studies 101 and 
103 (TEZ 50 mg q12h/ IVA 150 mg q12h), but resulted in a lower mean change in ppFEV1 versus 
placebo. 
Dosing in adolescents 
The use of the adult dosing regimen in subjects with CF who are 12 to 17 years of age in the Phase 3 
studies was based on allometric scaling of doses. Both TEZ and IVA are predominantly eliminated by 
metabolism via the CYP3A4/5 pathway. The maturity of the CYP enzymes in adolescents is similar to 
adults, and thus metabolism of TEZ and IVA are expected to be similar in adolescents and adults.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Studies 106 and 108 are the key efficacy studies supporting the proposed indication. Study 106 
investigated the efficacy of TEZ/IVA in subjects homozygous for F508del (F/F), while Study 108 
investigated it in subjects heterozygous for F508del and a residual function mutation (F/RF).

Figure 5 Design of pivotal studies 106 and 108 for Symkevi 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria were for both studies, aged 12 years or older and FEV1 ≥40% and ≤90% of 
predicted normal for age, sex, and height. In study 106 participants were to be homozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation, while in study 108 the patients were heterozygous for F508del and a mutation 
that results in RF of the CFTR protein (F/RF). Diagnoses of CF had to be confirmed, in study 106 by a 
sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L, while in study 108, by a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L or if the 
sweat chloride value was <60 mmol/L, documented evidence of chronic sinopulmonary disease.  
Key exclusion criteria for Studies 106 and 108 decreased potential confounders of study endpoint 
evaluations. The main exclusion criteria were similar in both trials:  
•  Abnormal liver function defined as any 2 or more of the following: ≥3 x upper limit of normal 
(ULN) aspartate transaminase (AST), ≥3 x ULN alanine transaminase (ALT), ≥3 x ULN gamma-
glutamyl transferase (GGT), ≥3 x ULN alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or ≥2 x ULN total bilirubin 
•  Abnormal liver function defined as any increase of ≥5 x ULN AST or ALT 
•  Abnormal renal function defined as glomerular filtration rate ≤50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated by 
the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Equation) for subjects ≥18 years old and ≤45 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated by the Counahan-Barratt equation) for subjects aged 12 to 17 years 
(inclusive) 
•  An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, PEx, or changes in therapy (including antibiotics) for 
pulmonary disease within 28 days before Day 1 (first dose of study drug) 
•  A 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc >450 msec at screening

For the CFQ-R 3 different versions of CFQ-R forms were used: 
•  CFQ-R for Children Ages 12 and 13 version had a total of 35 questions to form 8 domains.  
•  CFQ-R for Adolescents and Adults version (subjects 14 years old and older) had a total of 50 
questions to form 12 domains.  
•  CFQ-R for Parents/Caregivers version (subjects 13 years old and younger) had a total of 44 
questions to form 11 domains. 
Pulmonary exacerbation is defined as a clinical deterioration in respiratory status necessitating a 
change in antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, or oral) for any 4 or more of the following signs or 
symptoms: change in sputum; new or increased haemoptysis; increased cough; increased dyspnoea; 
malaise, fatigue, or lethargy; temperature above 38°C (equivalent to approximately 100.4°F); 
anorexia or weight loss; sinus pain or tenderness; change in sinus discharge; change in physical 
examination of the chest; decrease in lung function by at least 10%; or radiographic changes 
indicative of pulmonary infection.

The study was powered for both the primary endpoint (absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1) and 
a secondary endpoint of clinical interest (relative risk of PExs). The primary efficacy endpoint was the 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24. The null hypothesis to be tested was that 
the mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 was the same for TEZ/IVA and 
placebo groups. Assuming a common SD of 8% in each treatment group, a sample size of 220 subjects 
in each treatment group was to have at least 90% power to detect a treatment difference of 2.5% in 
ppFEV1 between treatment groups, using a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. If the above null 
hypothesis was rejected, the efficacy of TEZ/IVA was considered established. 
Assuming the PEx rate for placebo was 0.5 events in 24 weeks, with 220 subjects in each treatment 
group, the power to detect a 40% reduction in the PEx rate in the active arm versus the placebo arm 
was approximately 92%. The power to detect a 33% reduction in the PEx rate was about 78%. This 
power calculation was based on an R simulation with 10000 replications. To adjust for a 10% dropout, 
a total sample size of approximately 490 subjects was needed 
Study VX14-661-108 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change in ppFEV1 from study baseline to the average 
of the Week 4 and Week 8 measurements in each Treatment Period. The null hypotheses to be tested 
was that the mean absolute change from study baseline in ppFEV1 to the average of the Week 4 and 
Week 8 measurements was the same for (i) TEZ/IVA and placebo; and (ii) IVA monotherapy and 
placebo. 
Assuming an SD of 7 percentage points, 30 subjects per sequence were needed to have at least 90% 
power to detect a 3 percentage point treatment difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo when the 
mean values of the primary endpoint were being compared. A 2-sided significance level of 0.05 was 
used in the sample size calculations. Accounting for the testing strategy, the proposed sample size 
yielded approximately an 85% chance of observing a statistically significant difference between IVA 
monotherapy and placebo for the primary endpoint, under the assumption that IVA monotherapy is 
also 3 percentage points better than placebo. The sample size estimate was based on 10,000 
simulation runs with an incomplete block design assuming no dropouts. In the simulation, the 
correlation between responses to the 2 treatments within a subject was assumed to be zero. After 
adjusting for an assumed dropout rate of 10%, the sample size was increased to 34 subjects per 
sequence (204 total subjects). 
Randomisation 
Study VX14-661-106  
Approximately 490 subjects (245 per arm) who meet eligibility criteria will be stratified by age at 
Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), sex (male versus female), and percent predicted FEV1 
severity determined during the Screening Period (<70 versus ≥70), and then randomized (1:1) to 
either TEZ/IVA or placebo. An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used for randomization 
following a list of randomization codes generated by a designated vendor. 
Study VX14-661-108 
Subjects who met the eligibility criteria were randomized (1:1:1:1:1:1) to 1 of the 6 treatment 
sequences. Randomization was stratified by age at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), 
FEV1 severity (determined at the Screening Visit; <70% versus ≥70% predicted), and type of RF 
mutation on the second CFTR allele (Class V non-canonical splice mutation versus Classes II to IV RF

mutation). An interactive web response system (IWRS) was used to assign subjects to treatment and 
to ensure enrolment of at least 25% of subject with Classes II to IV RF mutations.  
Blinding (masking) 
Study VX14-661-106  
This is a double-blind study. The blinded data review before database lock is considered acceptable 
(ICH E9, section 7).  
Study VX14-661-108 
This was a double-blind study. Blinding measures are considered sufficient to have the study team 
blinded, although if individual physicians in the trial may have known the allocation based on 
spirometry, sweat chloride, FE-1 and IRT results. However, the treatment discontinuation is very low 
(at least 96.43% completed treatment in both periods, see subject disposition), so this is considered 
not to have impacted the results.  
Statistical methods 
Study 106: A hierarchical fixed-sequence testing strategy was used to control the overall type I error 
rate of 0.05 for the primary and key secondary endpoints. After the primary endpoint, the key 
secondary endpoints were tested in the following order: relative change from baseline in ppFEV1, 
number of PEx, absolute change from baseline in BMI at Week 24, and absolute change from baseline 
in CFQ-R through Week 24. 
Study 108: To control the overall Type I error rate with multiple treatment comparisons (TEZ/IVA 
versus placebo, and IVA versus placebo) for both primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, a 
gatekeeping approach was used where statistical significance could be claimed for the key secondary 
endpoint (CFQ-R respiratory domain) only if the primary endpoint (absolute change in ppFEV1) 
achieved statistical significance, and statistical significance of IVA versus placebo could be claimed only 
if TEZ/IVA versus placebo for the same endpoint was significant. Each of the hypothesis tests defined 
within the testing hierarchies was conducted at the significance level (alpha) of 0.05 (2-sided). 
As Study 108 was a 2-period cross-over design, carryover effect and treatment-by-period interaction 
for the primary analysis were assessed. Carryover effect for the primary analysis was assumed to be 
negligible due to the adequately long washout period of 8 weeks. Based on the results from the model 
for the primary analysis and the other sensitivity analyses, no statistical evidence suggested that there 
was a carryover effect. 
Results 
Participant flow 
In study 106, 510 subjects were randomized: 259 subjects in the placebo group and 251 subjects in 
the TEZ/IVA group. One subject in the placebo group did not receive any study drug dose due to a PEx 
before the Day 1 visit. Of the 509 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 475 (93.3%) 
completed dosing. The percentage of subjects who discontinued treatment due to AE was low in both 
treatment groups (TEZ/IVA: 2.8%; placebo: 3.1%). 
In study 108, all 248 subjects randomized to treatment sequence were included in the All Subjects and 
Randomized Sets. The Safety Set included 246 randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of

study drug. Two subjects who were randomized and received treatment but did not have eligible CFTR 
mutations were excluded from the efficacy analysis. Consequently, the FAS included 244 subjects: 161 
who received placebo, 156 who received IVA, and 161 who received TEZ/IVA. 
Recruitment 
Study 106 was conducted at 91 sites in the US, Canada, and Europe. Study period was from 30 
January 2015 (date first eligible subject signed the informed consent form) up to 20 January 2017 
(date last subject completed the last visit). Study 108 was conducted at 81 sites in North America, 
Europe, Israel, and Australia. Study period was from 27 March 2015 (date first eligible subject signed 
the informed consent form) up to 16 February 2017 (date last subject completed the last visit).  
Conduct of the study 
The Study 106 protocol was amended 3 times, see below. All the changes are considered not to have 
affected the size and interpretation of effects substantially.   
Table 15 Summary of Study VX14-661-106 Protocol Amendments
The original protocol of study 108 was amended 2 times and major changes for each of the 
amendments are summarized the below table.

Added ophthalmologic examination at the Early Termination of Treatment  
Visit or Safety Follow-up Visit for subjects <18 years of age at Screening 
and further instructions regarding examination 
Added spirometry assessments in subjects <18 years of age at Screening at 
2 and 4 hours after dosing on Day 1 and Day 15 of each Treatment Period 
and further instructions regarding assessment 
Changed sweat chloride from the key secondary endpoint to a secondary 
endpoint; changed CFQ-R respiratory domain from a secondary endpoint to 
a key secondary endpoint 
Added washout requirements for subjects who have previously used a 
commercially available CFTR modulator. 
Added detail about the criteria used to determine eligible CTFR mutations; 
updated criteria to require all mutations to be potentially responsive to IVA 
monotherapy: Revised list of eligible mutations: removed P205S, A1067T, 
and R1070Q, and added E831X 
Revised the formula for calculating the number of days hospitalized for PEs 
Version 3.0  
10 June 2016 
Subjects whose screening genotype results do not confirm study eligibility 
will not be included in the FAS because they are not in the target population 
for the study. 
Reduced the sample size from 300 subjects (50 subjects per sequence) to 
approximately 204 subjects (34 subjects per sequence), based on the 
change to the testing strategy (see below). The revised power calculations 
with a sample size of 204 subjects are provided. 
Moved the relative change in ppFEV1 from a key secondary endpoint to a 
secondary endpoint and removed from the testing hierarchy because 
relative change provides similar information to the absolute change in 
ppFEV1 (the primary endpoint). 
Specified that the annualized duration of hospitalizations due to PExs will be 
calculated using data up to Week 8 in each Treatment Period. 
Removed responder analysis for ppFEV1 because it is difficult to interpret in 
the absence of an identified and validated minimal clinically important 
difference in the ppFEV1. 
Removed the statistical comparison of TEZ/IVA and IVA monotherapy from 
the testing strategy to be consistent with the primary objective. The testing 
strategy was accordingly replaced with a single, stepwise hierarchical 
approach.

After the database lock, a post-hoc analysis to investigate cross-over effects were performed: change 
of study baseline to average of week 4 and 8 in period 1 and in period 2. The major amendments are 
acceptable. 
Baseline data 
With very few exceptions, subject demography and baseline characteristics were well-balanced across 
treatment groups and were generally similar in Studies 106 and 108, as stated in the below table.  
Subjects with the F/F genotype (study 106) typically have CF that has an earlier onset and is more 
rapidly progressive than with subjects with the F/RF genotype (study 108). Consistent with this, the 
study 106 population versus the study 108 population was younger (mean age of 26.3 versus 34.8 
years), had higher mean baseline sweat chloride values (100.9 versus 69.9 mmol/L), had lower mean 
BMI (21.04 versus 24.22 kg/m2), and had higher use of inhaled antibiotics (58.7% versus 31.2%) that 
were started within 28 days prior to the screening period until the safety follow-up visit (study 106) or 
during the first treatment period (study 108). 
The status of the subjects at enrolment regarding chronic lung infection due to P. aeruginosa was not 
collected.  Instead, what was collected was whether the subjects had been tested positive to any 
respiratory pathogen in the two years prior to the initiation of the trials. Therefore, the characteristic 
“Colonisation of P aeruginosa” should not be understood as if the subjects quoted in table below were 
all colonised by P aeruginosa at the time of the study entry or during it.   
In study 106, 1.0% of patients overall were obese (defined as a BMI > 30 kg/m2) while 29.6% were 
undernourished (defined as BMI < 18.5 Kg/m2). No adolescent subjects were obese but the 
percentage of undernourished subjects in this age group was considerably higher than in the adult 
group (69.8% vs. 17.5% respectively). Approximately 98% of subjects in Study 106 had exocrine 
pancreatic insufficiency and up to 97% of these subjects received pancreatic enzyme replacement 
therapy.  
In study 108, the baseline value of sweat chloride in the TEZ/IVA group in both periods is around 10 
mEq/l less than in the other two groups (i.e., around 66 mEq/l in both periods vs. 70 mEq/l on placebo 
and 75 mEq/l on ivacaftor). In Period 1 of study 108 the percentage of subjects with sweat chloride 
less than 30 mEq/l was 18.1% in the TEZ/IVA group vs. 5.0% and 4.9% on placebo and ivacaftor 
respectively. Within-subject comparisons of Period 1 and Period 2 baselines for ppFEV1, CFQ-R 
respiratory domain score, and sweat chloride concentrations were compared using paired-t-tests. The 
within-subject differences of Period 1 and Period 2 baselines in ppFEV1, CFQ-R respiratory domain 
score, and sweat chloride were consistently negligible across treatments and support the lack of 
carryover effect. Overall, 30% of the patients received pancreatic enzymes while only 13.5% were 
identified as pancreatic insufficient (defined as faecal elastase-1 concentration <200 μg/g). A total of 
146 subjects (59.8%) had a Class V non-canonical splice mutation, and 98 (40.2%) had Class II to IV 
mutations.

Numbers analysed  
Study VX14-661-106 
Of the 509 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 475 (93.3%) completed dosing. The 
percentage of subjects who discontinued treatment due to AE was low in both treatment groups 
(TEZ/IVA: 2.8%; placebo: 3.1%). A total of 231 (92.0%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 230 
(89.1%) subjects in the placebo group rolled over into the Treatment Cohort of Study 110.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Study VX14-661-106  
The efficacy analysis in study 106 was performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS): all randomized 
subjects who carry the intended CFTR allele mutation and have received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
A total of 510 subjects were randomized: 259 subjects in the placebo group and 251 subjects in the 
TEZ/IVA group. One subject in the placebo group did not receive any study drug dose due to a PEx 
before the Day 1 visit. Of the 509 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 475 (93.3%) 
completed dosing. The percentage of subjects who discontinued treatment due to AE was low in both 
treatment groups (TEZ/IVA: 2.8%; placebo: 3.1%).A total of 19 (3.7%) subjects had protocol 
deviations (IPDs). 
Overall, 461 (90.6%) subjects enrolled in the treatment cohort of the extension study, and 3 (0.6%) 
subjects enrolled in the observational cohort in the extension study (Study VX14-661-110). 
Primary endpoint 
The LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups was 4.0 percentage points 
(95% CI: 3.1, 4.8) and was statistically significant in favour of TEZ/IVA (P<0.0001) (see table 18).

Key Secondary Efficacy Variables  
Relative change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through Week 24: The key secondary 
endpoint of relative change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 analysed by MMRM was met. 
The LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups was 6.8% (95% CI: 5.3, 
8.3) and was statistically significant in favour of TEZ/IVA (P<0.0001). Within group, the LS mean 
relative change in ppFEV1 through Week 24 was statistically significant in the TEZ/IVA group (6.3%; 
P<0.0001) but not in the placebo group (-0.5%; P = 0.3823). 
Number of PEx through Week 24: The number of pulmonary exacerbations (PExs) through Week 24 
was analysed using a negative binomial regression model. TEZ/IVA treatment was associated with a 
lower event rate per year of pulmonary exacerbations (0.64) compared to placebo (0.99). The rate 
ratio versus placebo was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.88; P = 0.0054). In addition, treatment with TEZ/IVA 
was associated with a lower event rate per year of pulmonary exacerbations requiring IV antibiotic 
therapy (0.32) compared to placebo (0.59). The rate ratio versus placebo was 0.53 (95%CI: 0.34, 
0.82; P = 0.0042).  
Absolute change from baseline in BMI at Week 24: The absolute change from baseline in BMI at Week 
24 was analysed using an MMRM model. The LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and 
placebo groups was −0.04 kg/m2 (95% CI: −0.15, 0.07, P = 0.4127).  Therefore, the hierarchical 
multiple testing procedure was stopped at the level of BMI. Although a statistically significant 
treatment difference was not achieved, the mean absolute change from baseline in BMI was 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018

numerically greater in the TEZ/IVA group (0.18 kg/m2) than in the placebo group (0.12 kg/m2) at 
Week 24.  
In response to the CHMP’s request, the MAH provided an analysis of change from baseline for 
undernourished subjects (defined as subjects < 20 years of age with a baseline BMI-z-score <0; 
subjects ≥ 20 years of age with a baseline BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) and an analysis of undernourished 
subjects who met or exceeded a target BMI (i.e., for subjects < 20 years if their BMI-z-score was ≥ 0; 
for subjects  ≥ 20 years if their BMI value was greater than the median baseline BMI value for healthy 
subjects ≥20 years [healthy being defined as those with BMI ≥18.5 kg/m2)].  
At week 24 of study 106, the LS mean change from baseline in BMI in undernourished subjects in the 
placebo group was 0.30 (Min, Max: -1.71, 2.11) while in the TEZ/IVA group the LS mean change was 
0.15 (Min. Max: -2.23, 1.63). The responder analysis showed that the percentage of undernourished 
subjects who met or exceeded the target BMI at Week 24 was 28.6% in the placebo group versus 
32.4% in the TEZ/IVA group.  
Absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score through Week 24: The last key 
secondary endpoint in the testing hierarchy was a self-reported measure of respiratory symptoms, the 
CFQ-R respiratory domain score, analysed by MMRM through Week 24. The pooled CFQ-R “Children 
Ages 12 and 13” and “Adolescents and Adults” versions were used for the analysis. Treatment with 
TEZ/IVA resulted in improvements in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score. Within group, the LS mean 
absolute change from baseline in the pooled CFQ-R respiratory domain score through Week 24 was 5.0 
points (P<0.0001) in the TEZ/IVA group and -0.1 points (P = 0.8889) in the placebo group. The LS 
mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups in pooled CFQ-R respiratory 
domain score was 5.1 points (95% CI: 3.2, 7.0; nominal P<0.0001). 
Other Secondary Efficacy Variables 
Time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation through Week 24: TEZ/IVA reduced the risk of PEx compared to 
placebo, with a hazard ratio of 0.637 (95% CI: 0.459, 0.884; P = 0.0069). The 75th percentile of 
event-free time of the time-to-first PEx was 14.6 weeks in the placebo group and 22.6 weeks in the 
TEZ/IVA group. The hazard ratio was 0.553 (0.357, 0.857; P= 0.0080) for time-to-first pulmonary 
exacerbation requiring IV antibiotic therapy. The estimated week 24 event-free rate (95% CI) was 
0.87 (0.82, 0.91) in the TEZ/IVA group and 0.79 (0.73, 0.83) in the placebo group. No statistically 
significant differences versus placebo were detected in the time to first pulmonary exacerbation leading 
to hospitalisation (hazard ratio versus placebo 0.78 [95%CI: 0.44, 1.36; P = 0.3801]).

Absolute change in BMI z-score from baseline at Week 24 (in subjects <20 years of age at time of 
screening): The absolute change from baseline in BMI z-score at Week 24 for subjects <20 years old at 
screening (80 subjects in the TEZ/IVA group and 76 subjects in the placebo group) was analysed using 
an MMRM model. No clinically meaningful within-group changes in the LS mean BMI z-score at Week 
24 were observed in the TEZ/IVA (-0.06) or placebo (-0.02) groups; the LS mean treatment difference 
was −0.04 (95% CI: -0.15, 0.07; P = 0.4713). 
Subgroup analysis 
In the age group < 18 years,  the LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo 
groups for the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 was 3.9 percentage points 
(95% CI: 2.2, 5.5) and was statistically significant in favour of TEZ/IVA (P<0.0001). In the age group 
≥18 years, the LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups was 4.0 % 
percentage points (95% CI: 3.1, 4.9; P<0.0001).  
Consistent results in ppFEV1 favouring TEZ/IVA compared to placebo were observed across all 
prespecified subgroups: age (<18 or ≥18 years old), sex, baseline lung function (ppFEV1 <40, ≥40 to 
<70, or ≥70 %), region (North America or Europe), and baseline use of common CF medications (i.e., 
azithromycin and inhaled antibiotics, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and hypertonic saline).

The efficacy analysis was performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS): all randomized subjects who carry 
the intended CFTR allele mutation and have received at least 1 dose of study drug. Among the 248 
subjects who were randomly assigned to treatment, 246 subjects received at least 1 dose of study 
drug in Period 1 (81 received placebo, 81 received IVA, and 84 received TEZ/IVA). One subject 
assigned to placebo and 1 subject assigned to IVA in Period 1 were later deemed to be screen failures 
and did not receive treatment. In Period 2, 81 subjects received placebo, 76 subjects received IVA, 
and 78 subjects received TEZ/IVA. Across both periods, 162 subjects received at least 1 dose of 
placebo, 157 subjects received at least 1 dose of IVA, and 162 subjects received at least 1 dose of 
TEZ/IVA (see table below).

Table 19 Study 108 Subject Disposition, All Subjects Set 
A total of 14 subjects were identified who had IPDs. Subjects could have IPDs in more than 1 category. 
A review of the results for the subjects with IPs did not suggest that the IPDs had a clinically 
meaningful effect on the study conclusions.  
Overall, 227 (92.3%) subjects enrolled in the treatment cohort of the extension study, and no subjects 
enrolled in the observational cohort in the extension study (Study VX14-661-110). 
Primary endpoint 
Absolute change from study baseline in ppFEV1 to the average of Week 4 and Week 8: Treatment with 
TEZ/IVA and IVA resulted in statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 compared to placebo. The 
LS mean treatment difference versus placebo for absolute change in ppFEV1 from study baseline to the 
average of Week 4 and Week 8 was 6.8 percentage points (95% CI: 5.7, 7.8; P<0.0001) for the 
TEZ/IVA group and 4.7 percentage points (95% CI: 3.7, 5.8; P<0.0001) for the IVA group. TEZ/IVA 
treatment resulted in statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 compared to IVA. The LS mean

Sensitivity Analysis for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
A sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint was performed using an MMRM model with 
treatment, period, visit within period, treatment-by-visit interaction, and ppFEV1 at study baseline as 
the covariates. Using this model, the LS mean treatment difference for the TEZ/IVA group versus 
placebo for the absolute change from study baseline in ppFEV1 to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 
was 6.8 percentage points (95% CI: 5.6, 8.0; P<0.0001). Treatment with TEZ/IVA also demonstrated 
statistically significant improvement in absolute change in ppFEV1 compared to IVA. The LS mean 
treatment difference for the IVA group versus placebo for the absolute change from study baseline in 
ppFEV1 to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was 5.1 percentage points (95% CI: 3.8, 6.3; 
P<0.0001). 
Key Secondary Efficacy Variable 
Absolute Change from Study Baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain to the Average of Week 4 and 
Week 8: The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for the CFQ-R respiratory domain score is 
4 points.  Compared to placebo, the LS mean treatment difference from study baseline to the average 
of Week 4 and Week 8 was 11.1 points (95% CI: 8.7, 13.6; P<0.0001) for TEZ/IVA and 9.7 points 
(95% CI: 7.2, 12.2; P<0.0001) for IVA. The absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score was 
numerically greater in the TEZ/IVA group than the IVA group. The LS mean treatment difference for 
absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain from study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 
8 was 1.4 points (95% CI: -1.0, 3.9; P = 0.2578), in favour of TEZ/IVA. 
Other Secondary Efficacy Variables 
Relative Change in ppFEV1 from Study Baseline to the Average of Week 4 and Week 8: Treatment with 
TEZ/IVA and IVA resulted in improvement in relative change in ppFEV1 compared to placebo. The LS 
mean treatment difference versus placebo for the relative change in ppFEV1 from study baseline to the 
average of Week 4 and Week 8 was 11.4% (95% CI: 9.6, 13.2; P<0.0001) for TEZ/IVA and 8.1% 
(95% CI: 6.3, 9.9; P<0.0001) for IVA. The relative change in ppFEV1 was greater in TEZ/IVA than 
IVA. The LS mean treatment difference for the relative change in ppFEV1 from study baseline to the 
average of Week 4 and Week 8 was 3.3% in favour of TEZ/IVA (95% CI: 1.8, 4.8; P<0.0001) 
Absolute Change in Sweat Chloride from Study Baseline to the Average of Week 4 and Week 8: The LS 
mean treatment difference versus placebo for the absolute change in sweat chloride from study 
baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was -9.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.7, -7.3; P<0.0001) for 
TEZ/IVA and -4.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -6.7, -2.3; P<0.0001) for IVA. The reduction in sweat chloride 
concentration was greater in TEZ/IVA than IVA. The LS mean treatment difference for the absolute 
change in sweat chloride from study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was -5.1 mmol/L 
in favour of TEZ/IVA (95% CI: -7.0, -3.1; P<0.0001). 
Additional Efficacy Variables and Other Endpoints 
•  Additional Spirometry Variables 
Analysis of additional lung function parameters, including (predose) FEV1, FVC, ppFVC, FEF25%-75%, 
ppFEF25%-75%, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ppFEV1/FVC ratio were also performed. Improvements were 
observed for both TEZ/IVA and IVA compared to placebo for all parameters. To evaluate changes in 
small airways, the effect on ppFEF25%-75% was analysed. The mean (SD) absolute change from 
study baseline to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 in ppFEF25%-75% was 7.8 % (10.6) in the 
TEZ/IVA group, 6.6 % (10.3) in the IVA group, and -0.1 % (7.9) in the placebo group. 
•  Analysis of Response in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 71/144 
 
 
 
 
 
The MCID for the CFQ-R respiratory domain score is considered to be 4 points. At the average of Week 
4 and Week 8, the percentages of subjects who exceeded the improvement threshold was 65.2% in 
the TEZ/IVA group, 58.3% in the IVA group, and 32.9% in the placebo group. The odds ratio versus 
placebo was 7.418 (95% CI: 3.649, 15.080; P<0.0001) for TEZ/IVA, and 4.847 (95% CI: 2.447, 
9.605; P<0.0001) for IVA. The odds ratio for TEZ/IVA versus IVA was 1.530 (95% CI: 0.849, 2.759; P 
= 0.1562). 
•  Variables Related to BMI 
Increases in BMI and weight were observed in all treatment groups at Week 8. The mean absolute 
change from study baseline in BMI at Week 8 was 0.34 kg/m2 for TEZ/IVA, 0.47 kg/m2 for IVA, and 
0.18 kg/m2 for placebo. 
• 
Pulmonary Exacerbations 
PEx events occurred in 11 (6.8%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group, 9 (5.8%) subjects in the IVA group, 
and 19 (11.8%) subjects in the placebo group. The estimated event rate of PEx was lower for TEZ/IVA 
(0.34 events per year) and IVA (0.29 events per year) than for placebo (0.63 events per year). 
Compared to placebo, the rate ratio was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.13; P = 0.1031) for TEZ/IVA and 0.46 
(95% CI: 0.21, 1.01; P = 0.0532) for IVA. The rate ratio was 1.18 (95% CI: 0.49, 2.87; P = 0.7131) 
for TEZ/IVA compared to IVA. 
Subgroup analysis  
Subgroup Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
For the FAS, subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint were performed using a model similar to that 
for the primary analysis, but included an additional covariate for the relevant grouping factor as well as 
a term for grouping factor by treatment interaction. All of the subgroup analyses demonstrated that 
TEZ/IVA and IVA treatment resulted in statistically significant improvement over placebo in mean 
absolute change from study baseline in ppFEV1 to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 regardless of 
age, gender, baseline lung function, region, use of common CF medications, P. aeruginosa 
colonization, and RF mutation group (Class V non-canonical splice or Classes II to IV missense). 
Regarding gender, the treatment effect for TEZ/IVA versus IVA was greater in males (2.6 pp) 
compared with females (1.6 pp)). The subgroup analysis of sweat chloride and CFQ-R in males and 
females were consistent with the primary analysis. 
For TEZ/IVA, the mean treatment differences for absolute change in ppFEV1 through the average of 
Week 4 and Week 8 compared to placebo ranged from 4.4 (95% CI:1.1, 7.8) to 12.0 percentage 
points (95% CI:9.3, 14.8) across subgroups (P<0.05). The comparison of TEZ/IVA and IVA for ppFEV1 
was in favour of TEZ/IVA, overall and for the majority of predefined subgroups. Overall, the LS mean 
treatment difference for the TEZ/IVA group versus IVA for the absolute change from study baseline in 
ppFEV1 to the average of Week 4 and Week 8 was 2.1 percentage points (95% CI: 1.2, 2.9; P 
<0.0001), see tables below.

Upon request of CHMP, individual subject-level data from Study 108 were presented in box-and-

Figure 10 Box-and-Whisker Plot of Absolute Change from Baseline in ppFEV1 and Sweat 
chloride for Residual Function, Gating (IVA-naïve), and Minimal Function Mutations by 
Treatment Group 
Mixed model 
At request of the CHMP, mixed models to describe the between- and within-mutation variance and 
investigate the possibility to predict generalisation to mutations not enrolled in study 108 were 
submitted. 
The linear mixed effect model included the absolute change from study baseline in ppFEV1 or sweat 
chloride to the average of the Week 4 and Week 8 measurements as the dependent variable, 
treatment as a fixed effect, and mutation as a random effect. Compared to placebo, improvements in 
ppFEV1 were larger for TEZ/IVA and IVA. In addition, improvements with TEZ/IVA were larger than 
with IVA. Placebo behaved as expected for all mutations, with estimated mean changes from baseline 
for ppFEV1 close to 0 percentage points. The results based on the linear mixed effects model are 
consistent with the pre-planned primary analysis model.  Furthermore, the results of the model 
suggest a consistent treatment benefit of TEZ/IVA for all individual mutations in the proposed 
indication. The between-mutation variability is quite small (1.7 percentage points, SD = 1.3) compared 
with the within-mutation variance (37.3 percentage points, SD = 6.1). 
Based on the linear mixed model, the range of mean responses for mutations that were eligible but not 
enrolled in Study 108 was predicted. For subjects treated with TEZ/IVA, the range of the mean 
increase for a mutation is 5.1 to 8.5 percentage points based on the model. For any mutation that was 
eligible for Study 108, the mean response is predicted to be 4.6 percentage points or greater for

TEZ/IVA with 95% probability. For IVA, the mean response for a randomly selected mutation would be 
2.7 percentage points or greater with 95% probability. For sweat chloride for subjects treated with 
TEZ/IVA, the range of the mean improvement for a mutation is -2.6 to -28.5 mmol/L based on the 
model.

Analysis description  Secondary analysis 
As other secondary efficacy endpoints, time-to-first pulmonary 
exacerbation, absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline, absolute 
change in BMI z-score from baseline (in subjects <20 years of age at time 
of screening) and absolute change in body weight from baseline were 
investigated. Most of them showed a positive effect for TEZ/IVA compared 
to placebo.  
Ancillary analysis 
The Forest Plot for the subgroups analysed, shows a consistent beneficial 
effect for TEZ/IVA compared to placebo. The lowest point estimate is 3.5 
difference in the group of patients with low baseline FEV1 (ppFEV1 < 40%) 
and female sex.

The Forest Plot for the subgroups analysed, shows a consistent beneficial 
effect for TEZ/IVA compared to placebo. The lowest point estimate is 4.4 
difference in the group of patients with low baseline FEV1 (ppFEV1 < 40%). 
The highest results are observed in the group of age < 18 years (12.0), 
FEV1 ≥70% or no use of bronchodilator (8.3). 
The number of patients per specific RF mutation is very small. Nevertheless 
the effects observed are supportive with the overall effects except for the 
deletions F508del/D110H and F508del/E831X.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No additional across analysis were performed. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The clinical studies were primarily based on the genetic mutation. Hence, the results are presented in 
the clinical studies. Clinical data for splice mutations were analysed as a subgroup for the primary 
endpoint of ppFEV1 and demonstrated a treatment effect compared to placebo of 7.4 pp (95% CI: 6.0, 
8.7; P <0.0001). The treatment effect for the splice mutation subgroup compared to IVA monotherapy 
was 1.9 pp (95% CI: 0.8, 3.0; P = 0.0008), confirming the contribution of TEZ in this sub-population.

In all phase 3 studies together, there were 6 patients over 65 years of age at screening.   
Adolescents and adults were included together in the trials. Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint 
were done using a model similar to that for the primary analysis. Subgroup analyses showed 
statistically significant and consistent changes in ppFEV1 regardless of age, sex, baseline lung function, 
geographic region, use of common CF medications, and P. aeruginosa colonization status (documented 
within two years prior to enrolment into the pivotal studies).   
Supportive studies 
Two supportive studies are submitted in the addition to the two pivotal studies and two dose finding 
studies: Study VX08-770-104 (Study 104) and Study VX14-661-110 (Study 110). 
Study 104 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, study that evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of IVA monotherapy in subjects with the F/F genotype. This study was already 
submitted as a variation in the ivacaftor dossier.  
Study 110 is an open label uncontrolled extension study to support durability of efficacy and safety in 
subjects who complete Studies 103, 106, 107, 108 and 109. Study 110 is of importance as it provides 
long term data on efficacy and safety. The study is still ongoing and the results of an interim analysis 
are submitted.  
The results of a third study (Study VX14-661-107) are also submitted, but this study was not 
considered a fully supportive study by the MAH, because it was prematurely stopped because results of 
a planned interim analysis met the pre-defined futility rule. During the evaluation, results from Study 
VX14-661-109 were also provided.  
Study VX14-661-110 (Interim analysis 1, IA1, 70% patients analysed) 
Study VX14-661-110 (study 110) is an open-label rollover study that enrolled subjects from the Phase 
2 and 3 studies of TEZ/IVA.  An interim analysis (IA1, dated 6 March 2017) was submitted at the time 
of MAA.  A second interim analysis (IA2) was submitted upon CHMP’s request. 
Study 110 has a Treatment Cohort and an Observational Cohort. Subjects were eligible to enrol in the 
Treatment Cohort if they completed study drug treatment in the previous study and met the eligibility 
criteria. Subjects in the Treatment Cohort will receive TEZ/IVA for approximately 96 weeks. Subjects 
remained on their stable medication regimens for CF defined as the regimen subjects followed for at 
least 28 days before the first dose of study drug in study 106 or study 108. Subjects in the 
Observational Cohort did not receive study drug. A schematic of the study design is shown in figure 
below.

Notes: All subjects received a TEZ 100-mg/IVA 150-mg fixed-dose combination tablet qd in the morning and an IVA 150-mg tablet 
qd in the evening. 
The primary objective of study 110 is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of TEZ in 
combination with IVA in subjects with CF, homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation 
who are in the Treatment Cohort. Secondary objective was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of TEZ in 
combination with IVA for subjects in the Treatment Cohort.  
Efficacy Analysis Sets 
Efficacy analysis sets in Study 110 were based on the parent study. The efficacy analysis sets were 
defined differently for PEx analysis and other efficacy analyses. The Efficacy Analysis Populations for all 
efficacy analyses except the PEx analyses were: Study 106/110 Efficacy Set (ES) and Study 108/110 
ES. They included all subjects who entered the Treatment Cohort of Study 110. Treatment groups for 
data presentations are defined in table below. 
Table 26 Study 110 Efficacy Analysis Population and Treatment Group Assignments 
The PEx efficacy analysis populations for the PEx analysis were: Study 106/110 Pulmonary 
Exacerbation (PE) Analysis Set and Study 108/110 PE Analysis Set. They included subjects who 
received TEZ/IVA during either the parent study or during Study 110. Treatment groups for data 
presentations are defined in table below.

Table 28 PEx Analysis Period for Subjects who Enrolled in Study 110 
Continuous endpoints during the Study 110 Analysis Period were analysed using a separate MMRM for 
subjects in the Study 110 analysis population. However, the MMRM analysis for the Study 110 Analysis 
Period was restricted to the last visit at which the total number of subjects still on study was 
approximately 70% of the subjects from the parent study (Studies 106 or 108). The MMRM was used 
for the following analyses: 
• Absolute change from baseline in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(ppFEV1) 
• Relative change from baseline in ppFEV1 
• Absolute change from baseline in BMI 
• Absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R respiratory domain score 
• Absolute change from baseline in body weight 
The efficacy analysis baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement (scheduled or 
unscheduled) collected prior to the first dose of study drug in the parent studies for all subjects, except 
for subjects randomized to the placebo arm in Study 106. The efficacy analysis baseline for subjects 
randomized to the Study 106 placebo arm was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement 
(scheduled or unscheduled) collected prior to the first dose of study drug in Study 110. The parent 
study baseline was used to calculate the absolute and relative change from baseline unless otherwise 
specified. 
Study 110 was not designed or powered to assess the difference of TEZ/IVA effects for subjects 
transitioning from the various treatments in Study 106 or 108 to TEZ/IVA in Study 110. All P values 
provided for within-group changes are therefore nominal. 
Results 
Subject disposition 
At the time of the interim analysis 1 (IA1) data cut (06 March 2017), 870 subjects were enrolled and 
867 subjects had received at least 1 dose of TEZ/IVA in the Study 110 Treatment Cohort from the 
Assessment report

following parent studies: 23 subjects from Study 103, 462 subjects from Study 106, 159 subjects from 
Study 107, and 223 subjects from Study 108. No subjects were enrolled in the Observational Cohort at 
the time of IA1. Overall subject disposition for the Study 110 Treatment Cohort is summarized in table 
below. 
 Table 29 Subject Disposition (Study 110 Treatment Cohort), All Subjects Set 
Of the 867 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Study 110, 185 (21.3%) prematurely 
discontinued treatment. The majority of discontinuations were due to the early termination of Study 
107 for futility: 154 (17.8%) subjects discontinued treatment in Study 110 due to study termination by 
Sponsor. The percentages of subjects who discontinued treatment due to AEs (0.7%) or discontinued 
the study due to AEs (0.5%) were low. The total number of subjects with data was approximately 70% 
of subjects in the Efficacy Set (ES) for the respective parent study (Study 106/110 ES or Study 
108/110 ES). 
For the F/F population, 459 subjects received TEZ/IVA in Study 110. Of these, 231 subjects switched 
from placebo in Study 106 to TEZ/IVA in Study 110 (PBO-TEZ/IVA group), and 228 subjects continued 
to  receive  TEZ/IVA  (TEZ/IVA  group).  At  the  time  of  the  IA,  14  subjects  (6.1%)  in  the  PBO-TEZ/IVA 
group and 8 subjects (3.5%) in the TEZ/IVA group had discontinued treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 86/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the F/RF population, 222 subjects received TEZ/IVA in Study 110. Of these, 78 subjects received 
placebo in Study 108 Period 2 (PBO-TEZ/IVA group), 69 subjects received IVA in Study 108 Period 2 
(IVA-TEZ/IVA group), and 75 subjects received TEZ/IVA in Study 108 Period 2 (TEZ/IVA group). At the 
time of the IA, 3 subjects (1.4%) had discontinued treatment (1 subject in each group). 
Demographics and baseline characteristics  
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics are provided in IA1 for 459 subjects in Study 
106/110 ES. Out of these, 231 were subjects randomised to placebo in the parent study 106 (PCBO-
TEZ/IVA group) and 228 were randomised to TEZ/IVA in the parent study (TEZ/IVA group). In Study 
108/110 ES, data are provided for a total of 222 subjects distributed as follows: 78 in the PBO-
TEZ/IVA group, 69 subjects in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group, and 75 subjects in the TEZ/IVA group.  The 
baseline demographic and disease characteristics data presented below were derived from Study 106 
and study 108.   
In Study 106/110 Efficacy Set, the median age of subjects was 25 years (range: 12, 64). A total of 
51.6% of subjects were male. The majority of subjects had baseline ppFEV1 ≥40 to <70 (61.7%) or 
≥70 to ≤90 (27.2%). Median BMI was 20.72 kg/m2 (range: 13.67, 32.24). 
In the study 108/110 Efficacy Set, the median age of subjects was 35 years (range: 12, 72). A total of 
46.8% of subjects were male. The majority of subjects had baseline ppFEV1 ≥40 to <70 (58.1%) or 
≥70 to ≤90 (31.1 %). Median BMI was 23.53 kg/m2 (range: 15.19, 49.65). The most common 
medical history and prior medications used were consistent with the expectations for a population with 
CF. The different disease phenotype of both study populations (e.g., most subjects with residual 
function mutations are pancreatic sufficient when compared to patients homozygous for F508del) is 
reflected by these data.   
There were 26 IPDs prior to the cut-off date for IA1. None of these IPDs were considered to adversely 
affect subjects or the interpretation of study results. Twelve subjects had IPDs due to <80% study 
drug compliance; 7 subjects >70%, 3 subjects >50%, and 1 subject each had 48.8% and 4.7% 
compliance. The most common reasons were treatment interruption i.e., to take a prohibited 
concomitant medication, a non-LFT-related AE, or for both of these reasons. The subject with 48.8% 
compliance had treatment interruption due to renal failure. 
• 
 Outcomes and estimation of efficacy variables (secondary endpoints, IA1) 
At the time of data cut for IA1, approximately 70% of subjects that rolled over from Study 106 had 
completed the Week 24 Visit in Study 110 and approximately 70% of subjects that rolled over from 
Study 108 had completed the Week 16 Visit in Study 110.  
Absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline: For subjects who received placebo in study 106, the within-
group mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from study 110 baseline at Week 24 of Study 110 was 4.5 
percentage points (95% CI: 3.3, 5.7; nominal P<0.0001) compared to 3.4 pp at week 24 of study 106 
in the TEZ/IVA group. For subjects randomised to TEZ/IVA in study 106, at Week 24 of study 110, the 
within-group mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from study 106 baseline was 3.1 pp (95% CI: 1.9, 4.3; 
nominal P<0.0001) after 48 weeks treatment in total. 
For subjects who received placebo in Period 2 of Study 108 (PCBO-TEZ/IVA group), at Week 16 of 
study 110 the within-group mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from study 108 baseline was 4.6 pp 
(95% CI: 2.9, 6.3; nominal P <0.0001) compared to 6.5 pp at week 24 of study 108 in the TEZ/IVA 
group. For subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Study 108 Period 2, the within-group  mean absolute 
change in ppFEV1 from study 108 baseline at Week 16 of study 110 was 5.9 pp (95% CI: 4.1, 7.7; 
nominal P<0.0001) in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group and 7.4 pp (95% CI: 5.6, 9.1; nominal P<0.0001) in the

Notes: The MMRM analysis for Study 110 analysis period is restricted to the last visit at which the total number of subjects was 
approximately 70% of subjects in the parent study (106 or 108) FAS.  
Study 106: During Study 106, the last non-missing measurement before the first dose of study drug in Study 106 was used to 
calculate the change from baseline. For subjects in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group, the last non-missing measurement before the first dose 
of study drug in Study 110 was used to calculate the change from baseline during study 110.  
Study 108: For both the Study 108 and 110 Analysis Periods, baseline was the most recent non-missing measurement before the 
first dose of study drug in Study 108. Treatment assignment in the period of Study 110 was based on assigned treatment in Period 2 
of Study 108. Study 108 Analysis Period includes Treatment Periods 1 and 2, and subjects were included in more than 1 treatment 
group during the Study 108 Analysis Period

Number of Pulmonary Exacerbations: Tables below show the results of pulmonary exacerbations for 
both PEx efficacy analysis populations.  
Table 30 Results of pulmonary exacerbations for both PEx efficacy analysis populations 
(106/110 and 108/110) 
Subjects in the 106/110 PE analysis set who received placebo in Study 106 had an estimated event 
rate per year of PEx of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.75) in Study 110 that was lower than the event rate in 
the placebo (0.99) and TEZ/IVA groups (0.64) in Study 106. Subjects in the 106/110 PE analysis set 
who received TEZ/IVA in Study 106 maintained an estimated annualised event rate of pulmonary

exacerbations of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.88) that was slightly higher than the event rate observed at 
week 24 of study 106 (0.64) and lower than the event rate per year of PEx in the placebo group in 
Study 106 (0.99).  
Subjects in the 108/110 PE analysis set who received placebo in Study 108 had a similar estimated 
event rate of PEx per year (0.34, [95% CI: 0.19, 0.61]) in Study 110 than the estimated event rate at 
week 8 of study 108 in the TEZ/IVA group (0.34). The event rate was lower than the one estimated in 
the PCBO group at week 8 of study 108 (0.63). Subjects in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group of the Study 
108/110 PE Analysis Set had a higher estimated event rate per year of pulmonary exacerbations (0.39 
[95% CI: 0.22, 0.70]) than the IVA group at week 8 of study 108 (0.29). Subjects in the 108/110 PE 
analysis set who received TEZ/IVA in Study 108 had a lower PEx event rate per year in Study 110 
(0.20, [95% CI: 0.10, 0.39]) than during Study 108 (0.34).   
Regarding PEx that require IV antibiotic therapy, for subjects in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group of the Study 
106/110 PE Analysis Set, the event rate was decreased from 0.54 in study 106 to 0.27 (95% CI: 0.19, 
0.40). Subjects in the TEZ/IVA group of the Study 106/110 PE Analysis Set had a higher estimated 
event rate per year (0.39 [95% CI: 0.22, 0.70]) than in study 106 (0.29). The event rate for the 
number of PEx requiring IV antibiotics was low for all 3 groups in Study 110 for subjects in the 
108/110 PE analysis set (F/RF population). 
Time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation: For subjects who received placebo in Study 106, the estimated 
exacerbation-free probability at Week 24 in Study 110 was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.81), which was 
higher than the estimated exacerbation-free probability at Week 24 of Study 106 in the placebo group 
(0.65) and similar to the estimated exacerbation-free probability at Week 24 of Study 106 for subjects 
who received TEZ/IVA (0.75). For subjects in the 106/110 PE analysis set (F/F population), the 
estimated exacerbation-free probability for subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Study 106 was 0.60 
(95% CI: 0.53, 0.66) after 48 weeks of TEZ/IVA treatment.  
For subjects who received the first dose of TEZ/IVA in Study 110, the estimated exacerbation-free 
probability at Week 16 of the PE Analysis Period (reflecting 16 weeks of treatment in Study 110) was 
0.88 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.94) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.90) in the IVA-
TEZ/IVA group. For subjects in the 108/110 PE analysis set (F/RF population), the estimated 
exacerbation-free probability for subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Study 108 was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75, 
0.92) after 24 weeks of TEZ/IVA treatment.  
Absolute change from baseline in BMI: For subjects who received placebo in Study 106, the within-
group change in BMI from study 110 baseline was 0.26 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.40) at Week 24 of 
Study 110 compared to 0.18 kg/m2 at Week 24 of Study 106 in the TEZ/IVA group. For subjects who 
received TEZ/IVA in Study 106, the within-group change in BMI from study 106 baseline was 0.26 
kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.39) at Week 24 of Study 110. 
In response to the CHMP’s request, the MAH provided an analysis of change from baseline for 
undernourished subjects and an analysis of undernourished subjects who met or exceeded a target 
BMI. At week 24 of study 110, the LS mean change from study 110 baseline in BMI in undernourished 
subjects in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group was 0.73 (Min, Max: -2.77, 2.86) while in the TEZ/IVA group the 
LS mean change from study 106 baseline was 0.38 (Min, Max: -1.25, 2.40). The responder analysis 
showed that the percentage of undernourished subjects who met or exceeded the target BMI at Week 
24 was 35.2% in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group versus 33.8% in the TEZ/IVA group.

Figure 13 MMRM analyses of absolute change from baseline in BMI (kg/m2) at each visit, 
Study 106 FAS and Study 106/110 ES  
Notes: The MMRM analysis for the Study 110 analysis period was performed on the Study 106/110 ES and was restricted to the last 
visit at which the total number of subjects with data was approximately 70% of subjects in the Study 106/110 ES. BL was generally 
defined as the last non-missing measurement before the first dose of study drug in Study 106; however, changes during the Study 
110 analysis period for subjects in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group were based on the Study 110 BL (most recent non-missing measurement 
before the first dose of study drug in Study 110); the Study 110 BL time point is not depicted in the figure.  
For subjects who received placebo in Period 2 of Study 108, the within-group change in BMI from study 
108 baseline was 0.52 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.83) at Week 16 of Study 110 compared to 0.34 kg/m2 
at Week 8 of Study 108 in the TEZ/IVA group. For subjects who received IVA in Period 2 of Study 108, 
the within-group change in BMI from study 108 baseline was 0.60 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.93) at 
Week 16 of Study 110. For subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Period 2 of Study 108, the within-group 
change in BMI from study 108 baseline was 0.74 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.43, 1.06) at Week 16 of Study 
110. 
Absolute change from baseline in weight: For subjects who received placebo in Study 106, the within-
group change in weight from study 110 baseline was 1.0 kg (95% CI: 0.6, 1.4) at Week 24 of Study 
110 compared to 0.7 kg at Week 24 of Study 106 in the TEZ/IVA group. For subjects who received 
TEZ/IVA in Study 106, the within-group change in weight from study 106 baseline was 1.2 kg (95% 
CI: 0.8, 1.6) at Week 24 of Study 110. For subjects who received placebo in Period 2 of Study 108, the 
within-group change in weight from study 108 baseline was 1.7 kg (95% CI: 0.8, 2.6) at Week 8 of 
Study 108 compared to 1.0 kg at Week 8 of Study 108 in the TEZ/IVA group. For subjects who 
received IVA in Period 2 of Study 108, the within-group change in weight from study 108 baseline was 
2.1 kg (95% CI: 1.1, 3.1) at Week 16 of Study 110. For subjects who received TEZ/IVA in Period 2 of 
Study 108, the within-group change in weight from study 108 baseline was 2.3 kg (95% CI: 1.4, 3.3) 
at Week 16 of Study 110. 
Absolute Change in the CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score: Subjects in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group who 
began receiving TEZ/IVA in Study 110 showed at Week 24 of Study 110, a within-group  mean 
absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score from study 110 baseline of 3.3 points (95% CI: 
0.8, 5.7) compared to 5.5 points in the TEZ/IVA group at week 24 of study 106. For subjects in the 
TEZ/IVA group at Week 24 of Study 110, the mean absolute change from study 106 baseline in CFQ-R 
respiratory domain score was 3.1 points (95% CI: 0.6, 5.5).   
Subjects in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group who received placebo in Period 2 of Study 108 showed at Week 16 
of Study 110, a within-group change in the mean absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score 
from study 108 baseline of 10.8 points (95% CI: 6.9, 14.7) compared to 10.1 points in the TEZ/IVA 
group at the average of week 4 and week 8 in study 108. At Week 16 of Study 110, the LS mean

absolute change from study 108 baseline in CFQ-R respiratory domain score was 11.0 points (95% CI: 
6.8, 15.1) in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group and 9.9 points (95% CI: 6.0, 13.9) in the TEZ/IVA group.

 Outcomes and estimation of efficacy variables (secondary endpoints, IA2) 
With the responses to the CHMP’s request during the evaluation, a second interim analysis (IA2) of 
study 110 was submitted. In this second interim analysis (IA2), baseline is defined as the last non-
missing assessment before the first dose of TEZ/IVA in Study 110 for all “treatment” groups while in 
the first interim analysis (IA1) the parent study baseline was used to calculate the absolute change 
from baseline in continuous variables, except for subjects randomized to the placebo arm in Study 
106. In IA1, for placebo subjects in the parent study 106, the efficacy analysis baseline was defined as 
the most recent non-missing measurement collected prior to the first dose of study drug in Study 110.  
The start of the PEx Analysis Period for subjects from Studies 106 and 108 who enrolled in Study 110 
was similar. The only difference between IA1 and IA2 for the PE Analysis Sets was the duration of 
exposure to TEZ/IVA which was longer at the time of IA2 (as the data cut for IA2 was on 14 November 
2017 and the data cut for IA1 was on 06 March 2017).  
For F/F subjects from parent study 106, the results (expressed as mean within-group changes [95% 
CI] for all variables except for pulmonary exacerbations) were as follows:  
At Week 24 of Study 110, the LS mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 for subjects in PBO-
TEZ/IVA group was 4.2 pp (3.3, 5.1) while for subjects in the TEZ/IVA group the mean change was 
−0.2 pp (-1.1, 0.7). For adolescents subjects (less than 18 years old), these figures were 5.3 pp (3.9, 
6.8) and -0.8 (-2.3, 0.7) in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA groups, respectively. 
The estimated event rate per year of PEx was 0.65 (0.52, 0.80) and 0.72 (0.60, 0.87) in PBO-TEZ/IVA 
and TEZ/IVA groups, respectively. The estimated evet rate per year of pulmonary exacerbations that 
require intravenous therapy was 0.32 (0.24, 0.42) in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group and 0.35 (0.27, 0.45) 
in the TEZ/IVA group.  
The change in BMI was 0.23 kg/m2 (0.11, 0.34) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group, and 0.00 kg/m2 (-0.11, 
0.11) in the TEZ/IVA group, while the change in weight was 0.9 kg (0.5, 1.2) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA 
group, and 0.2 kg (-0.1, 0.6) in TEZ/IVA group.  
The change in BMI z-score restricted to adolescent subjects was 0.10 (0.00, 0.19) and -0.04 (-0.13, 
0.06) in the in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA groups, respectively. Regarding weight z-score, these 
figures were 0.06 (-0.01, 0.14) and -0.02 (-0.09, 0.05).  
The change in CFQ-R was 3.3 points (1.4, 5.3) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group, and 0.4 points (-1.3, 2.4). 
At Week 24 in Study 106, the proportion of patients who had at least a 4 point increase in CFQ-R 
respiratory domain score was 51.3% in the TEZ/IVA group and 35.7% in the placebo group. In 
subjects who received TEZ/IVA for 48 weeks, the proportion of subjects who met or exceeded the 
MCID at Study 106 Week 24 was sustained through 24 weeks of additional TEZ/IVA treatment in Study 
110 (48.6%). 
For F/RF subjects from parent study 108, the results (expressed as mean within-group changes [95% 
CI] for all variables except for pulmonary exacerbations) were as follows:  
At Week 16 of Study 110, the LS mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 for subjects in PBO-
TEZ/IVA group was 4.9 pp (3.7, 6.2), for subjects in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group this value was 2.4 pp 
(1.1, 3.7) and 0.0 (-1.2, 1.3) for subjects in the TEZ/IVA group. These figures for adolescent subjects 
were as follows: 7.2 (4.8, 9.7), 1.6 (-1.5, 4.8), and 0.7 (-2.2, 3.6) respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018

The change in the respiratory domain of CFQ-R was 8.1 points (18.7) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group while 
in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group it was 3.9 points (0.6, 6.5) and 4.4 points (1.2, 7.6) in TEZ/IVA group. The 
proportion of patients who met or exceeded the MCID at the conclusion of Study 108 (53.9%) was 
maintained through an additional 16 weeks of TEZ/IVA treatment in Study 110 (62.2%).  
The estimated event rate per year of PEx was 0.38 (0.24, 0.61) in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group, 0.26 
(0.15, 0.44) in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group and 0.22 (0.13, 0.37) in the TEZ/IVA group.  
The change in BMI was 0.35 kg/m2 (0.14, 0.56) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group, 0.15 kg/m2 (-0.07, 0.38), 
in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group and 0.54 kg/m2 (0.32, 0.76) in TEZ/IVA group. Mean changes in body 
weigth were 1.0 kg (0.5, 1.6), 0.6 (0.0, 1.2), and 1.5 (0.9, 2.1) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA, IVA-TEZ/IVA, 
and TEZ/IVA groups respectively. Analysis of within-group changes in BMI z-scores in adolescent 
subjects show the following results: 0.04 (-0.07, 0.14), -0.13 (-0.26, 0.01), and 0.16 (0.04, 0.28) in 
the PCBO-TEZ/IVA, IVA-TEZ/IVA, and TEZ/IVA groups respectively. Regarding the within-group mean 
change in weigth z-score, these figures were as follows 0.02 (-0.09, 0.12), -0.06 (-0.20, 0.08), and 
0.13 (0.01, 0.26) respectively.  
The MAH was requested to contextualise the results of change in ppFEV1 and rate of pulmonary 
exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis with the mutations of interest. To that end, two sets of 
data were provided.  
The rate of decline in ppFEV1 was retrospectively analysed by Sawicki et al. (2017) in the Cystic 
Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR). Patients in the CFFPR from 2006 to 2014 with a residual 
function mutation heterozygous for F508del were compared to patients homozygous for F508del 
(Sawicki GS, Konstan M, McKone E, Moss RB, Johnson C, Lubarsky B, Suthoff E, Millar S, Pasta DJ, 
Mayer-Hamblett N, Goss C, Morgan W. Rate of Lung Function Decline in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis 
(CF) Having a Residual Function Gene Mutation. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care 
Medicine; p:A4847; 2017 American Thoracic Society.). Residual function mutations were identified 
based on clinical or in vitro evidence of residual ion transport. Annual rates of ppFEV1 decline were 
estimated over 2-year periods using all available measurements using the 2012 Global Lung Initiative 
equations. In homozygous F508del subjects the estimated annual rate of decline in ppFEV1 overall 
(subjects aged 6 years or older) was −1.91 (SE, 0.05), with the most rapid rate of decline observed in 
the 18-24 year group (−2.52 [0.09]). For heterozygous subjects (excluding those with an R117H-CFTR 
mutation), the estimated annual rate of decline in ppFEV1 overall (subjects aged 6 years or older) was 
−1.05 (0.39). Similarly, the most rapid rate of decline was observed in the young adult group (−1.85 
[SE not provided]). In the 13-17 year group the annual rate of decline in ppFEV1was −2.37 (F508del 
homozygous subjects) and −0.57 (heterozygous subjects excluding those with an R117H-CFTR 
mutation). 
Regarding the natural history data of pulmonary exacerbations, the MAH provided unpublished data on 
the rate of these events from the CFF Patient Registry. The definition of pulmonary exacerbation  as 
used in the registry, i.e. requiring IV antibiotics or hospitalization was used to compare the rate of 
pulmonary exacerbations leading to hospitalization or IV antibiotic treatment from Studies 106/110 
and 108/110 at the time of IA2 to the natural history data. The annual risk of PEx from CFF Registry 
data are provided in table below.

Table 31 Prevalence of pulmonary exacerbations from 20121o 2014 among CF patients for 
homozygous for F508del or heterozygous for F508del with an RF mutation aged >12 years  
Study VX14-661-107 
Study VX14-661-107 (study 107) was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, multicenter study in subjects with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR 
mutation and with a second CFTR mutation that is not likely to respond (NR) to TEZ and/or IVA 
therapy. TEZ 100 mg once daily qd)/IVA 150 mg q12h was administered for up to 12 weeks.  
The rationale for designating NR second allele mutations is based on the following: 
• 
• 
biologic plausibility due to a predicted lack of full-length CFTR protein (e.g., nonsense, 
noncanonical splice, and frameshift mutations) 
evidence of clinical severity on a population basis based on the patient registry CFTR2 (average 
sweat chloride >86 mmol/L, percentage of patients with pancreatic insufficiency [%] is >50%), 
and 
• 
in vitro testing (mutations that responded with chloride transport <10% of wild-type CFTR 
were considered minimal function and NR). 
Efficacy Results 
The LS mean treatment difference for the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 12 
for the TEZ/IVA group versus the placebo group was 1.2 % (95% CI: -0.3, 2.6; P value: 0.1176). The 
LS mean treatment difference for the TEZ/IVA group versus the placebo group by visit was similar to 
the difference observed through Week 12 and ranged from 0.6 to 1.9 %. Treatment with TEZ/IVA did 
not demonstrate statistically significant treatment differences in the absolute change in ppFEV1 from 
baseline through Week 12. The 1-sided 80% UCB for LS mean treatment difference in the absolute 
change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 12 was 1.79 %, which was below the predefined futility 
boundary of 2.5% and the 1-sided 80% UCB for LS mean within treatment difference in the absolute 
change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 12 for the TEZ/IVA group was 1.52 %, which was below 
the futility boundary of 1.75 %. There were no clinically relevant differences for the change in CFQ-R 
respiratory domain score (2.1 points), the number (event rate per year) of pulmonary exacerbations 
(23 [0.98] events) vs. 22 [0.97] events), BMI (-0.08 kg/m2), BMI z-score (-0.05)). The within-group 
LS mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 12 was greater in the TEZ/IVA

group (-4.7 mmol/L) compared with the placebo group (-1.2 mmol/L), however the difference is not 
clinically relevant. 
Study VX14-661-109 
The results of this study were submitted during evaluation. Study VX14-661-109 compared TEZ/IVA 
with IVA in 156 subjects aged 12 years and older with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR 
mutation and a second CFTR allele with a gating defect that is clinically demonstrated to be IVA-
responsive. The objectives and design are presented in figure below.  
Table 32 Summary of design of study 109 
The primary endpoint was the average absolute change in ppFEV1 through Week 8 of the Active 
Comparator Treatment Period (the baseline was the conclusion of the Run-in Period.) The majority of 
subjects were White (96.7%). A total of 56.0% of subjects were male. The overall median age was 
32.0 years (range: 12 to 71 years), with 18 (12.0%) subjects in the 12 to <18 years old subgroup. 
Demographic parameters were similar between the TEZ/IVA and IVA groups and similar in the Active 
Comparator Treatment Period (ACTP) and the IVA Run-in Period. Subjects were using similar 
concomitant medications during the IVA Run-in Period.  
Within group, the mean treatment difference in absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through 
Week 8 was 0.2 percentage points (95% CI: -0.5, 1.0; P = 0.5355) in the IVA group and 0.5 
percentage points (95% CI: -0.2, 1.3; P = 0.1548) in the TEZ/IVA group. The LS mean treatment 
difference between the TEZ/IVA and IVA groups for absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through 
Week 8 was 0.3 percentage points (95% CI: -0.8, 1.4; P = 0.5846). 
Key secondary endpoints were relative changes in ppFEV1 and change in CFQ-R. Change in sweat 
chloride was a secondary efficacy endpoint. Treatment with TEZ/IVA resulted in a greater reduction 
(improvement) in sweat chloride concentration compared to IVA. The mean treatment difference 
between the TEZ/IVA and IVA groups in absolute change in sweat chloride from study baseline through 
Week 8 was -5.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -10.7, -0.9; P = 0.0216). The relative change in ppFEV1 and 
change in CFQ-R between the TEZ/IVA and IVA group were similar.

Based on the above results, patients with gating mutations were removed from the originally claimed 
indication.   
In vitro-in vivo relationship 
In vitro studies were used to identify mutations that are likely to respond to TEZ/IVA.  
In vitro models 
HBE cells and FRT in vitro model systems were used to understand the biology of CFTR mutations and 
effect of CFTR modulators on chloride transport (refer for details to the non-clinical assessment).  
In the FRT in vitro model, the F508del-CFTR response to TEZ/IVA, which represents the response of a 
single allele, did not reach the threshold of an increase in chloride transport over baseline of ≥10% of 
normal. 
Residual Function and IVA-Responsive Gating Mutations: The FRT model was used to evaluate the 
effect of TEZ/IVA on the CFTR mutations eligible for Studies 108 (and 109). Normal CFTR, the 20 
missense RF CFTR forms eligible for Study 108, and the 10 IVA-responsive mutations eligible for Study 
109 responded to TEZ/IVA with an increase in chloride transport of at least 10% higher than normal 
CFTR. The 5 splice mutations eligible for Study 108 produce both correctly and aberrantly spliced CFTR 
transcripts; thus epithelial cells with these mutations express normal CFTR on the surface, although at 
reduced levels. FRT cells which express normal CFTR respond to TEZ/IVA with increased chloride 
transport, supporting that these 5 splice mutations will be responsive in vivo. 
Of the 25 CFTR mutations with residual function eligible for Study 108, subjects with 17 mutations 
were enrolled. The ppFEV1 response in this group is used to support the ability of the in vitro model to 
predict clinical response to TEZ/IVA. The Study 108 subgroup analysis in subjects with splice mutations 
demonstrated a clinical response to TEZ/IVA. The R347H-CFTR mutant was excluded from the 
indication based on an in vitro increase in chloride transport below the pre-defined threshold of 10%. 
Out of these 26 mutations of residual function, there were 9 for which no subjects were enrolled in 
study 108; all of these mutations were responsive to TEZ/IVA in the FRT model system. These 9 
mutations were initially included in the proposed label. Additionally, for some mutations the number of 
subjects enrolled in study 108 was very limited (e.g., E831X and D110H). The 10 gating mutations 
eligible for Study 109 were responsive to TEZ/IVA in vitro and had a greater increase in chloride 
transport for TEZ/IVA than IVA and were initially proposed for the indication. In response to the 1st 
RSI, they were removed as the consequence of the results of the finalised study 109, which showed no 
difference in clinical response between ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor. 
TEZ/IVA-nonresponsive CFTR mutations: In vitro responses are also used for prediction of negative 
clinical responses. Many mutations included in Study 107 are not amenable to in vitro study due to the 
lack of any CFTR protein produced (truncation mutations). Two mutations in Study 107 (R1066C and 
N1303K) result in CFTR protein with processing and trafficking defects, and these CFTR forms were not 
responsive to TEZ/IVA in vitro in the FRT assay. These in vitro results were confirmed by the outcomes 
of Study 107.  
In response to the CHMP’s request, scatterplots of the in vitro and in vivo responses were submitted on 
request of the CHMP (see figure below). The scatterplots show the in vitro response in the FRT assay 
and clinical endpoints (i.e. ppFEV1, sweat chloride) for individual subjects in Study 108, 109 (ivacaftor 
naive) and 107 (R1066C, N1303K). The 5 splice mutations from Study 108 (i.e., 711+3A→G, 
2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, or 3849+10kbC→T, and E831X) were not included in the scatterplots 
because FRT cells expressing the different splice mutations were not generated.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
At the time of the submission, tezacaftor/ivacaftor was claimed to be indicated in a combination 
regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets “for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 
years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who have at least one mutation in 
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that is responsive to 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor based on in vitro and/or clinical evidence (see section 5.1). A table with these 
mutations was included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Hence, the proposed indication for heterozygous subjects did not reflect the population that was 
clinically investigated in study 108, i.e. patients with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del/residual 
function mutation. In addition, inclusion of CFTR mutations with residual function identified as 
responsive to TEZ/IVA was based on in vitro data models and was also initially proposed by the MAH. 
For the responsiveness in vitro, HBE and mainly FRT models were used. These models were suggested 
to be useful as support for distinguishing patients with CFTR mutations expected to benefit from 
treatment for which clinical data are not available. The use of in vitro data would then be justified by a 
scientific understanding of the molecular basis of CFTR dysfunction, the known mechanism of action of 
the drug and the HBE/FRT models which the MAH asserts to be considered robust and established. A 
10% increase in chloride transport was specified without clinical validation that this threshold of 
response would be decisive to predict clinical efficacy. The stably transfected FRT cell line appears to 
be particularly useful for gathering information on the underlying defect of certain CFTR mutant 
proteins. However, their relevance for the in vivo clinical situation is very questionable given their non-
human origin and the high artificially overexpressed levels of transfected CFTR mutant protein in this

system (please refer to non-clinical part for a detailed discussion).  
Scatterplots were provided with the results of all patients in study 108, of the ivacaftor-naive patients 
in study 109, and of the patients with mutations R1066C and N1303K in study 107 as for these 
patients/mutations baseline ppFEV1 and in vitro data were available. Although, the majority of data 
points for individual subjects fall into the upper right quadrant for ppFEV1 and lower right quadrant for 
sweat chloride suggesting that the cut-off may have been well chosen, in the absence of ‘negative’ 
data it is difficult to conclude on the validity of the threshold.  Moreover, the absence of a scatter 
around a diagonal demonstrated the lack of a correlation between chloride transport and ppFEV1 
increase as well as the lack of a clinically relevant increase in ppFEV1. Furthermore, while IVA alone 
mostly appears to produce smaller increases from baseline in chloride transport compared to TEZ/IVA, 
there appears to be a similar spread of ppFEV1 and sweat chloride values for IVA monotherapy as for 
TEZ/IVA. The wide spread of the clinical response within a certain mutation is clearly demonstrated in 
the box-and-whisker plots.  
For generalisability/extrapolation purposes to mutations that were not clinically investigated, Mixed 
Model analyses were requested by the CHMP and were provided by the MAH. When comparing the 
predicted means with the observed medians (and constructing a range based on +/-1.96 times the 
within mutation SD), the model seems to overestimate the effect size for the majority of mutations 
with small sample size (< 10) and to predict well for mutations with a larger sample size (≥10). Thus 
the model is driven by the mutations with the larger number of patients. This is confirmed in the 
threshold analysis as in 6 out of the 10 mutations with a small number of subjects, the predicted 
percentage of patients with ≥ 2% improvement is higher than observed.  
As the consequence of the above shortcomings of the in vitro model itself and the unclear relation 
between in vitro and in vivo results, the CHMP concluded that the originally proposed clinical indication 
including mutations based on in vitro evidence solely is not sufficiently justified.  Further investigations 
for validation of this model with FRT cell or other in vitro systems would be needed. The MAH is 
encouraged to discuss the validation of the in vitro models (FRT cells or primary human cells) as well 
as the in vitro-in vivo relation within an EMA/CHMP qualification advice, during the post-authorisation 
phase. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose-finding studies 
Multiple doses of tezacaftor alone and combinations of tezacaftor with ivacaftor have been investigated 
in two phase II studies, Study 101 a dose ranging study in adult subjects with F/F genotype and in 
adult and adolescent subjects with F/G551D, and Study 103 a dose confirming study in adult CF 
patients, homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. The same dosing was used in adolescents as for 
adults based on similar maturity of the CYP enzymes. The specified primary efficacy analysis 
variable/endpoint was the absolute change in sweat chloride (mmol/L) from baseline through Day 28. 
Given the acceptance of sweat chloride as a diagnostic criterion and an important pharmacodynamic 
marker of CFTR activity, this is considered appropriate. Absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 was 
evaluated as a secondary endpoint. The use of MMRM as the primary analysis is generally not 
supported in the presence of missing data, but in the context of an exploratory study this is less of a 
concern. 
Main studies 
Efficacy and safety have been evaluated in 5 phase III studies in CF patients aged 12 years and older.

F508del and a residual function mutation (F/RF) are the core efficacy studies. Study 110 was designed 
to support long-term safety and maintenance of effect. Results of study 110 are currently submitted as 
an interim analysis. The supportive studies Study 107 investigated TEZ/IVA  in subjects heterozygous 
for F508del and a minimal function (MF) mutation that is likely nonresponsive to TEZ and/or IVA 
(F/MF), while study 770-104  investigated ivacaftor monotherapy in subjects with the F/F genotype. 
Study 109 (ongoing at the time of MAA filing and closed during the CHMP assessment process) 
compared TEZ/IVA versus IVA in patients with the F508del/gating genotype (F/pre-specified gating 
mutations). 
All main studies were randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled except the open-label, single-
arm extension study 110. Studies 101, 103, 109 and 108 were also active controlled by ivacaftor. 
Placebo was deemed necessary, because no CFTR modulators were approved for the F/F population at 
the time of study initiation and for adequate assessment of the benefit in the absence of an approved 
CFTR modulator in subjects with F/RF genotypes. The ivacaftor control arm allowed for assessment of 
contribution of tezacaftor to ivacaftor. Study 110 included a Treatment Cohort and an Observational 
Cohort. The in-and exclusion criteria for the dose-response studies, studies 101 and 103, and pivotal 
trials 106 and 108 were largely similar, except for the genotype of subjects enrolled. In all studies the 
patients were 12 years and older. Patients had to have FEV1 ≥40% and ≤90% and stable CF. 
Diagnosis of CF was confirmed with standard methods of sweat chloride testing. While for study 106, a 
confirmed diagnosis of CF defined as a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L by quantitative pilocarpine 
iontophoresis was requested, for study 108 if the sweat chloride value was <60 mmol/L, there must 
have been a documented evidence of chronic sinopulmonary disease. This is acceptable due to 
differences between the two study populations with patients with residual function mutations expected 
to have less severe disease than that of F508del homozygous patients. 
In study 108, patients needed to have a pre-specified mutation of residual function based on 
population-level clinical phenotypic data and in vitro responsiveness to ivacaftor. Given the 
heterogeneity of the mutations with residual function, further characterisation in terms of the 
functional class as well as whether all of them were disease-causing were presented as requested, 
although summarily. Compared to class II (e.g., F508del), classes IV and V had a significantly lower 
mortality rate and milder clinical phenotype.  Patients with CF and a RF mutation (excluding subjects 
with an R117H-CFTR mutation) have a reduced rate of lung function decline compared to F508del 
homozygous subjects (−1.05 compared to −1.91).  However, patients with an RF mutation still 
demonstrate progressive lung disease. 
The duration of the dose finding studies 101 and 103 of 28 days and 12 weeks, respectively, is 
acceptable for the objective of the trials. The 24 week treatment period of pivotal study 106 is in line 
with the EMA guideline on CF (CHMP/EWP/9147/08) and in accordance with the CHMP’s scientific 
advice. Pivotal study 106 had a parallel design. Study 108 had a cross-over design with two 8 week 
treatment periods with a wash-out period of 8 weeks in between. The wash-out period is justified from 
a pharmacokinetic perspective, while clinically a comparison for the baseline values of ppFEV1, CFQ-R 
and sweat chloride per period further excluded a carry-over effect. Treatment duration is however very 
short, thus a difference may not have been captured in the trial. Longer-term data will be provided by 
Study 110 with a duration of approximately 96 weeks. A first interim analysis (Interim analysis 1, IA1) 
was submitted including data from 70% of subjects up to 24 weeks (subjects who rolled over from the 
parent study 106) or  up to 16 weeks (subjects who rolled over from the parent study 108. Upon 
CHMP’s request, a second interim analysis (IA2) of study 110 was submitted in which within-group 
changes in continuous variables were calculated using as baseline the last non-missing assessment 
before the first dose of TEZ/IVA in Study 110, while in the first interim analysis (IA1) the parent study 
baseline was used to calculate the absolute changes from baseline, except for subjects randomized to

the placebo arm in Study 106.  
Endpoints 
All studies included the following endpoints: absolute change in ppFEV1, change of sweat chloride, 
height and weight, respiratory domain of CFQ-R, pulmonary exacerbations and BMI. Depending on the 
type of study and the objectives of the study, primary and secondary endpoints were appointed. The 
primary endpoints in the phase II studies were change of sweat chloride in study 101 and absolute 
change in ppFEV1 in study 103, primarily for the purpose of PD assessments and dose finding 
respectively. These endpoints are acceptable to the CHMP. 
For the pivotal studies 106 and 108, the primary endpoint is absolute change in ppFEV1. FEV1 is the 
advocated primary endpoint in EMA’s guideline on CF (CHMP/EWP/9147/08). Rate of decline in FEV1 
has been demonstrated to correlate with survival and to be the strongest clinical predictor of mortality, 
while FEV1 is repeatable and, adjusted for age and sex, has been shown to be a cofactor for mortality. 
However, in study 108, the average of ppFEV1 from Week 4 to Week 8 is used. The results of a post-
hoc analysis of the mixed-effects model at Week 8 alone were consistent with the primary analysis. 
The key secondary endpoints in study 106 (relative change in percent predicted FEV1, number of 
pulmonary exacerbations, absolute change in body mass index (BMI), change in the respiratory 
domain score of the CFQ-R) and in study 108 (absolute change in CFQ-R, with the remaining as 
additional endpoints given the short duration of the treatment period) are all accepted endpoints in 
clinical trials on CF, although the relative change in ppFEV1 is clearly dependent on the absolute 
change in ppFEV1. Each of them is able to measure a different aspect of the disease, and together able 
to support a benefit for CF patients. In the extension study 110, the same endpoints of efficacy 
(secondary) were used as in the parent studies. 
Statistical methods 
The analysis methods for the continuous repeated measures data e.g. ppFEV1 and CFQ-R, and the 
rates and timing of exacerbations are appropriate. Head-to-head comparisons of TEZ/IVA to IVA in 
study 108 were removed via protocol amendment from the set of endpoints for which type I error was 
protected, so these cannot be considered statistically significant in a formal sense. The MAH explained 
that the comparison of TEZ/IVA vs IVA was considered of interest, but no reason is provided for the 
removal of statistical testing. As for Symkevi no mutations that are already registered for Kalydeco in 
the EU are proposed, this decision is acceptable. Finally, no convincing methods to investigate carry-
over in study 108 were planned, but on request of CHMP a post-hoc analysis was performed. The 
protocol amendments made appeared to be acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose regimen 
For CF patients 18 years or older with F/F mutation (n=194 included in study 101, ppFEV1 increased 
more with TEZ100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h compared to TEZ 150 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h (4.44 pp 
vs. 4.13 pp) and to VX-661 50 mg q12h/IVA 150 mg q12h  (3.66 pp vs 2.31 pp). There was no clear 
evidence of a TEZ dose response on ppFEV1. 
In study 101 there was discrepancy between sweat chloride and ppFEV1 outcomes, with TEZ 
monotherapy achieving consistently superior reductions in sweat chloride compared to TEZ/IVA; 
whereas change in ppFEV1 was superior with TEZ/IVA versus TEZ at the proposed combination dose. 
As discussed in the PD section, overall, the results for ppFEV1 demonstrated quite consistently a 
greater effect for TEZ/IVA combination with the highest response for TEZ 100 mg qd /IVA 150 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 100/144 
 
 
 
 
 
q12h and a clinically relevant difference with TEZ 100 mg. However, there was no clear dose response 
and TEZ monotherapy at 10 mg qd which appeared to produce improvement in ppFEV1 not dissimilar 
to that with the combination. TEZ monotherapy at 100 mg and 150 mg qd appeared more effective 
than the combination at reducing sweat chloride, but there were inconsistences between the 
combination and the monocomponent tezacaftor and also between the TEZ monotherapy groups. 
Evaluation of treatment differences versus pooled placebo across cohorts demonstrated also 
inconsistency between sweat chloride and FEV1 data. However, in all groups the number of patients in 
the groups was small, e.i. 8 (monotherapy) or 16 (combination therapy).  
Exposure-response modelling, submitted to support clinical superiority of TEZ/IVA over TEZ was also 
not reassuring. In vitro data were not conclusive either. There is discrepancy between the patch clamp 
data and the Ussing chamber chloride conductance data when F508del is expressed in the same FRT 
cell system. Moreover, the patch clamp data are discrepant with the in vivo data in study 101 which 
appeared to demonstrate an effect of tezacaftor on its own to reduce sweat chloride which the MAH 
acknowledges is not fully understood.  
The effect of IVA in subjects with the F/F genotype was been investigated in study 104. The estimated 
treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 1.72 percentage points (95% CI: -0.6349, 
4.0754, P = 0.1509) suggesting that the effects of TEZ/IVA in study 106 (LS mean absolute change 
from baseline for placebo -0.6 pp and for TEZ/IVA 3.4 pp) is partly due to effect of ivacaftor. For the 
18 CF patients 12 years or older with F/G551D in study 101, change in sweat chloride was ‒7.02 
mmol/L for TEZ 100 mg qd + Kalydeco, with a treatment difference of ‒17.2 mmol/L compared to 
Placebo + Kalydeco (P = 0.0238). A clinically relevant response was also observed in ppFEV1 within 
treatment and compared to Kalydeco alone.   
Adolescents 
The same dosing was used in adolescents as for adults based on similar disease severity and similar 
maturity of the CYP enzymes. A comparable exposure was confirmed by simulated AUC vs age based 
on the pop-PK model.  
CF patients 12 years or older homozygous for F508del (F/F) 
In the pivotal study 106 (n=510), baseline demographics, disease characteristics and concomitant 
medication appear to be balanced overall. Thirty percent (29.6%) of patients were undernourished 
(defined as a BMI z-score <0 for subjects <20 years of age and as a BMI <18.5 kg/m2 for subjects ≥ 
20 years of age). The percentage of undernourished subjects in the adolescent age group was higher 
than in the adult group (69.8% vs. 17.5% respectively). This finding is in line with the nutritional 
decline that has been reported by several studies during adolescence and that commonly persists into 
early adult life. The inclusion of patients with ppFEV1 <40, despite the exclusion criterion, is caused by 
a difference in ppFEV1 at screening and at the baseline study visit and it is therefore considered not 
potentially biased. In study 106, a total of 47 subjects had a decrease in ppFEV1 below 40 pp from 
screening to baseline. Out of these 47 subjects, 38 (80.9%, 21 subjects on placebo and 17 on 
TEZ/IVA) received inhaled antibiotics prior to Day 1. Most of these subjects continued to receive them 
at day Day 1 and afterwards. 
The status of chronic lung colonisation due to P. aeruginosa was not collected at the time of study 
enrolment. Pseudomonas lung colonisation was documented by the finding of P. aeruginosa within two 
years prior to the start of the study. 
Missing data for repeated measures was not an issue (less than 10%). The LS mean treatment 
difference in absolute change in ppFEV1 between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups was 4.0 percentage 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 101/144 
 
 
 
 
 
points (pp) (95% CI: 3.1, 4.8) in favour of TEZ/IVA (P<0.0001). In adolescent subjects (n=58 per 
treatment group), the mean treatment difference in the TEZ/IVA group vs. placebo for the absolute 
change in ppFEV1 from baseline through week 24 was 3.9 pp (95% CI: 2.2, 5.5). The obtained 
difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo in the overall population of study 106 was above the 
predefined threshold (2.5 pp) and also above the definition of clinical relevance of 2.5 percentage 
points quoted as the average natural decline in CF patients (Report of the workshop on endpoints for 
cystic fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/769571/2012)). Results from MMRM analysis demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement in absolute change in ppFEV1 compared to placebo that was 
evident at Day 15 of 3.4 pp. This improvement was sustained during the treatment period, with an 
increasing difference with placebo because of the gradual decrease in the placebo group of -1.3 pp at 
week 24. The post–hoc sensitivity analyses supported the primary analysis, also by 95% CI and 
statistical significance. A requested ANCOVA model with an imputation method for the missing data 
shows a treatment difference in ppFEV1 similar in magnitude to the LS mean treatment difference of 
5.0 percentage points in the ANCOVA analysis with no imputations, and remains highly statistically 
significant.   
The results of the key secondary endpoint, relative change from baseline in ppFEV1, support the 
primary endpoint. However, this parameter is not independent from the primary endpoint.  
The estimated annual event rate ratio of pulmonary exacerbations for TEZ/IVA versus placebo was 
0.65 (95% CI 0.48, 0.88; p = 0.0054). The estimated annual event ratio of pulmonary exacerbations 
requiring IV antibiotic therapy (which is considered a marker of severity) was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.34, 
0.82; P = 0.0042). Regarding pulmonary exacerbations leading to hospitalisation, no statistically 
significant differences versus placebo were detected (rate ratio versus placebo 0.78 [95% CI: 0.44, 
1.36; P = 0.3801]). In additional secondary efficacy evaluation, subjects in the TEZ/IVA group had a 
longer time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation than subjects in the placebo group, with a hazard ratio of 
0.637 favouring the TEZ/IVA group (P = 0.0069). The 75th percentile of pulmonary exacerbations-free 
time was 14.6 weeks in the placebo group and 22.6 weeks in the TEZ/IVA group. For pulmonary 
exacerbations that require intravenous therapy, less than 25% of patients in each group had such an 
event during the study period.  
The secondary endpoint hierarchy was broken by the results of BMI. For this important extra-
pulmonary parameter the mean absolute change was numerically greater in the TEZ/IVA group (0.18 
kg/m2) than in the placebo group (0.12 kg/m2) at Week 24, but the treatment difference was not 
statistically significant. The mean treatment difference between groups in the absolute change from 
baseline in BMI was 0.06 (95% CI: -0.08, 0.19; P= 0.4127). Therefore, the hierarchical multiple 
testing procedure was stopped at the level of BMI. 
In additional analyses in undernourished subjects, the mean change from baseline in BMI was 
numerically greater with placebo (0.30 kg/m2) than with TEZ/IVA (0.15 kg/m2). The responder 
analysis of under-nourished patients who achieved a target BMI revealed a slightly higher percentage 
of responders in the TEZ/IVA group (32.4%) compared to the placebo group (26.8%). 
The last key secondary endpoint in the testing hierarchy (after BMI) was the CFQ-R respiratory domain 
score. The LS mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups in pooled CFQ-R 
respiratory domain score was 5.1 points (95% CI: 3.2, 7.0; nominal P<0.0001). 
Other secondary endpoints were overall supportive, although some only numerically. The reduction in 
sweat chloride is modest, given that homozygous F508del/F508del patients have baseline sweat 
chloride in the region of 100 mmol/L. Based on natural history data, mutations with residual CFTR 
activity that have sweat chloride levels approximately 10% lower (improved) than severe mutations 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018

have disease manifestations that are either less severe or demonstrate a delay in onset compared with 
the most severe mutations. The reduction is therefore acceptably relevant.  
No clinically meaningful within-group changes in the mean BMI z-score were observed in the TEZ/IVA 
(n= 80, 0.06) or placebo (n = 76, ‒0.02) groups in subjects under 20 years of age; the mean 
between-group treatment difference was -0.04 (95% CI: -0.15, 0.07; P = 0.4713). 
Consistent and significant benefits in ppFEV1 favouring TEZ/IVA were observed across all prespecified 
subgroups: age, sex, baseline lung function, region, P. aeruginosa colonisation (documented within the 
two years prior to study start but not at the time of enrolment into the study), and baseline use of 
common CF medications. The lowest point estimate of 3.5 pp difference in the groups of patients with 
ppFEV1 < 40% and in female sex is still above clinical relevance. 
Preliminary results of the open label extension study 110 at the time of the first interim analysis 1 
(including approximately 70% of the subjects who had completed the Week 24 Visit in Study 110) 
seem suggestive for the maintenance of the effect. The efficacy picture in Study 106 is mirrored in the 
PCBO-TEZ/IVA group of study 110. At week 24 of study 110 (IA1), the mean absolute change from 
study 110 baseline in ppFEV1 was 4.5 pp (95% CI: 3.3, 5.7) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group. The mean 
absolute change from study 106 baseline at week 24 of study 110 was 3.1 pp (95% CI: 1.9, 4.3) in 
the TEZ/IVA group. Thus, both groups achieved a clinically relevant improvement from baseline of the 
parent study (TEZ/IVA group) or of study 110 (PCBO-TEZ/IVA group).  
The second interim analysis (IA2) showed a loss of 0.2 percentage points in ppFEV1 during the 
additional 24 weeks of treatment with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in the TEZ/IVA group. This is considered 
reasonable as the decline in ppFEV1 after 48 weeks of treatment with tezacaftor/ivacaftor is below the 
estimated annual rate of decline experienced by untreated (with CFTR modulators) F508del 
homozygous subjects according to the data discussed by the MAH (Sawicki et al. 2017) which is −1.91 
(including subjects aged 6 years and older).  
In Study 106 week 24, the annualised event rate of PEx requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy was 
0.29 in the TEZ/IVA group and increased to 0.35 after 24 weeks in Study 110 (IA2). With this increase 
in the duration of TEZ/IVA exposure the PEx rate was still lower than the rate in the placebo group in 
Study 106 (0.54). Moreover, in patients who started TEZ/IVA in either Study 106 (parent study) or 
Study 110, the risk of PEx that led to hospitalization or IV antibiotic treatment was 29.6% overall, 
while in the CFF Registry the risk of PEx (also defined as those requiring IV antibiotics or 
hospitalization) ranged from 47.6% to 49.5% from 2012 to 2014. These natural history data on 
pulmonary exacerbations have been generated in the CFFPR and are on file (i.e., not available in the 
public domain yet). The results in study 110 are not unexpected given that the percentage of subjects 
with pulmonary exacerbations requiring intravenous therapy was less than 25% in each group of study 
106 at week 24. 
A limited gain in BMI was observed at week 24 of study 106 in the TEZ/IVA (0.18 kg/m2) group vs.  
the placebo group (0.12 kg/m2). At week 24 of study 110 the mean within-group change increased to 
0.23 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.34) in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group while no additional gain was observed in 
the TEZ/IVA group as shown by a mean within-group change of 0.00 (-0.11, 0.11). An analysis 
restricted to undernourished subjects showed that at week 24 of study 110, the LS mean change from 
study 110 baseline in BMI in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group was 0.73 kg/m2 (Min, Max: -2.77, 2.86) while in 
the TEZ/IVA group the LS mean change from study 106 baseline was 0.38 kg/m2 (Min, Max: -1.25, 
2.40). In the responder analysis the percentage of undernourished subjects who met or exceeded the 
target BMI at Week 24 was 35.2% in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group versus 33.8% in the TEZ/IVA group.  
Assessment report

The improvement observed in the CFQ-R respiratory domain at week 24 of study 106 in the TEZ/IVA 
group (5.5 points) was partially maintained at week 24 of study 110 as shown by a mean within-group 
change of 0.4 points while in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group the mean change was 3.3 (1.4, 5.3). The 
responder analysis further support a benefit in favour of TEZ/IVA as 51.3% patients were responders 
after 24 weeks (study 106), only reduced to 48.6% after 48 weeks (study 110) of treatment with 
TEZ/IVA. 
As specific data for adolescents were not provided with IA1, these were requested within the interim 
analysis 2 (IA2). At screening of the parent study 106 there were 116 subjects from 12 to less than 18 
years old. Out of these, at the time of IA2, 55 subjects were analysed in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group and 
54 in the TEZ/IVA group. The majority of subjects had baseline ppFE ≥ 40 to <70 (44.0%) or ≥70 to ≤ 
90 (48.6%).  
The MMRM analysis of the absolute change in ppFEV1 from study 110 baseline at Week 24 of study 
110 shows a mean within-group change of ‒0.8 pp (95% CI: ‒2.3, 0.7) in the TEZ/IVA group 
compared to ‒0.3 (−1.2, 0.7) in subjects ≥ 18 years old. In the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group, this figure was 
5.3 pp (3.9, 6.8). Regarding BMI z-score, at week 24 of study 110, the mean within-group change in 
the PCBO-TEZ/IVA was 0.10 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.19) while in the TEZ/IVA group this figure was -0.04 
(95% CI: -0.13, 0.06). The analysis above mentioned limited to undernourished patients is relevant for 
this age subset given that the percentage of undernourished subjects in the adolescent group was 
considerably higher than in the adult group (69.8% vs. 17.5% respectively). Overall, these results 
suggest that young subjects homozygous for F508del are at higher risk of lung status decline as a loss 
of 0.8 pp in ppFEV1 is seen at week 24 of study 110 in the TEZ/IVA group compared to -0.3 in the 
adult population.    
For F508del homozygous patients, the place in treatment of a combination of a corrector and a 
potentiator has already been established by the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor (Orkambi). 
The initial improvement of ppFEV1 is higher with tezacaftor/ivacaftor than with Orkambi in its 
registration trials (1.68 pp and 2.63 pp at 24 weeks, see EPAR Orkambi).  
In study 104, a small not relevant difference in the adjusted mean absolute change from baseline 
through Week 16 in ppFEV1 has been observed between the ivacaftor group (1.54%) and placebo 
group (-0.18%) with an estimated treatment difference of 1.72% (p = 0.15). A similar picture was 
observed for sweat chloride values with a difference of -2.87 mmol/L (P = 0.038). In the open label 
extension phase, subjects treated with ivacaftor for 64 weeks (IVA/IVA), the small improvement in 
FEV1 in the parent part was not sustained through Week 64. The efficacy of ivacaftor alone is not 
established in CF patients with F/F genotype. 
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del, and a second allele with residual 
function (F/RF)  
In the pivotal study 108, 81 subjects received placebo in Period 1 and 81 in Period 2, 81 subjects 
received IVA in Period 1 and 76 in Period 2, and 84 received TEZ/IVA in Period 1 and 78 in Period 2. 
Baseline demographics, disease characteristics and concomitant medication were overall balanced, but 
there were more females than males in all study arms with the greatest imbalance between males and 
females (more females) in the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups, with a lesser imbalance in the IVA arm. A 
total of 23 patients had baseline sweat chloride levels within the normal range. All of them were 
heterozygous F508del/D1152H (n= 16) or F508del/3849+10kbC->T (n=7). In that case patients had 
to have documented evidence of chronic sinopulmonary disease.

Twenty-eigth percent (28.6%) of subjects in the placebo group, 34% on ivacaftor, and 31.1% on 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor received pancreatic enzymes while the number of those with a diagnosis of 
exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (defined as faecal elastase-1 concentration <200 μg/g) is 
considerably lower (13.8%, 13.6%, and 13.3% respectively) a discrepancy that remains unexplained. 
The inclusion of patients with ppFEV1 <40%, despite the exclusion criterion, is caused by a difference 
in ppFEV1 at screening and at baseline study visit. In study 108, 22 subjects had a decrease in ppFEV1 
below 40 pp from screening to baseline. Out of these 22 subjects, 13 (59.1%, 2 subjects on placebo, 5 
on ivacaftor and 6 on TEZ/IVA) received inhaled antibiotics at some point between screening and 
baseline but all of them could stop treatment with inhaled antibiotics before Day 1.  
The status of chronic lung colonisation due to P. aeruginosa was not collected at the time of study 
enrolment. The sub-analysis by this factor was based on the finding of P. aeruginosa within the two 
years prior to the study start. This may not reflect the true incidence of subjects with chronic lung 
infection as some infections would be expected to resolve prior to enrolment. Therefore, the results of 
subgroup analysis by colonization with Pseudomonas may not accurately reflect the effect of treatment 
in study 108. 
The majority of the patients were heterozygous F508del/non-canonical splice mutations. These 
mutations were not tested for in vitro responsiveness to ivacaftor as required in study 108. The 
inclusion of these mutations was justified by the MAH based on the fact that they produce both 
correctly and aberrantly spliced CFTR transcripts; thus epithelial cells with these mutations express 
normal CFTR on the surface, although at reduced levels. FRT cells which express normal CFTR respond 
to TEZ/IVA with increased chloride transport, supporting that these 5 splice mutations will be 
responsive in vivo. The inclusion is considered acceptable as indeed in vitro responsiveness cannot be 
shown in FRT cells but in other systems.  
The LS mean treatment difference of ppFEV1 compared to placebo was 6.8 pp (95% CI: 5.7, 7.8; 
P<0.0001) and to IVA was 2.1 pp (95% CI: 1.2, 2.9; P<0.0001) in favour of TEZ/IVA. The sensitivity 
analysis is supportive for the primary analysis as the obtained difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo 
was above the predefined threshold and was statistically significant. The multiple testing procedure for 
study 108 is not proven to protect type I error, but due to the strong statistical significance, many 
conceivable multiplicity procedures would produce similar results, so this is not considered critical.  
The clinical relevance of responses of the mutations with clinical data was determined by using 
different thresholds and the annual loss of ppFEV1 of -1.05 found by Sawicki et al (2017) excluding 
subjects with an R117H-CFTR mutation with most rapid loss in the 18 to 24–year age group (−1.85, 
excluding R117H). Given the fact that the MAH powered the sample size to detect a 3 percentage point 
treatment difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo, 2 percentage points was chosen as a reasonable 
difference compared with placebo to have an impression of responders. An additional threshold 
analysis of changes in ppFEV1 ≥0 percentage points was proposed by the MAH because it was 
considered that any improvement or stabilization in this measure would be considered clinically 
meaningful as CF subjects with RF mutations experience annual declines in ppFEV1. Although this is 
agreed in general, for studies of duration of 8 week treatment a stabilisation cannot fully appointed to 
a treatment effect yet. Furthermore, in the sub-analysis of the mutations in study 108 when taken a 
clinically relevance as for the null hypothesis i.e. 3% only three mutations would not fulfil this 
threshold, while when using 2% this concerns 2 mutations. 
For the following mutations, sufficient clinical evidence is considered present: 2789+5G->A, 3272-26A-
>G, 3849+10kbC->T, A455E, D1152H, P67L, and S945L. Because of the very limited data, 
711+3A→G, D579G, L206W, R1070W, R117C, R352Q, and S977F do not fulfil strictly the requirement 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 105/144 
 
 
 
 
 
of robust clinical data and the modelling did not add new insights to overcome this issue. However, 
CFTR mutations 711+3A→G, R1070W, R117C, R352Q, and S977F fulfil the criteria for passing the 
different thresholds of ppFEV1 and might also be considered acceptably established. For mutations 
D579G and L206W, although patient numbers are very low, 50% of the patients have a clinically 
relevant response. Given the rarity of these mutations and the difficulty of obtaining what would 
ordinarily be deemed robust clinical data, the sparse but promising data are considered sufficient. 
Independent of de method for threshold or calculation, mutation D110H does not meet any criterion. 
Mutation R347H was never proposed for the indication due to an in vitro increase in chloride transport 
below the pre-defined threshold of 10%. 
The rationale for the need for TEZ in a TEZ/IVA combination can be considered somewhat more 
persuasive for patients with missense mutations that express misfolded CFTR protein. Patients with 
missense mutations demonstrated a greater mean treatment difference in both ppFEV1 and sweat 
chloride for TEZ/IVA versus IVA (difference of 2.3 pp ppFEV1 and -8.5 mmol/l for missense mutations; 
versus 1.9 pp ppFEV1 and -3.0 mmol/l for splice mutations). However, in vitro data through FRT cell 
data are absent for non-canonical splice mutations as DNA constructs are not available. Patients with 
such mutations were nonetheless included in study 108. The rationale behind inclusion was that non-
canonical splice mutations result in low levels of normally folded CFTR protein. 
For the key secondary endpoint CFQ-R Respiratory Domain, the mean treatment difference of TEZ/IVA 
compared to placebo of 11.1 points (95% CI: 8.7, 13.6) and the difference compared to baseline of 
10.1 points is clinically relevant as it is above the threshold of 4 points. The percentage of subjects 
who had an increase of at least 4 points was higher for TEZ/IVA and IVA compared to placebo: 65.2%, 
58.3%, and 32.9% respectively with a favourable odds ratio for TEZ/IVA of 7.42 and 1.53 against 
placebo and IVA, respectively.  Mean absolute change in sweat chloride (-9.5 mmol/l) and change in 
BMI (0.34 kg/m2) were all supportive for TEZ/IVA. Pulmonary exacerbations occurred in 11 (6.8%), 9 
(5.8%), and 19 (11.8%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA, IVA, and placebo groups, respectively.  The 
estimated event rate of PEx was lower for the TEZ/IVA (0.34 events per year) and the IVA (0.29 
events per year) groups than for the placebo group (0.63 events per year). Although suggestive for a 
benefit, exacerbation rate is not a reliable parameter measured over such a short time. 
In sub-analyses, TEZ/IVA and IVA treatment resulted in statistically significant improvement over 
placebo regardless of age, sex, baseline lung function, region, use of common CF medications, and P. 
aeruginosa colonization (documented within two years prior to study start). The lowest point estimate 
is 4.4 difference in the group of patients with low baseline FEV1 (ppFEV1 < 40%). The inclusion of 
patients with ppFEV1 <40, despite the exclusion criterion, is caused by a difference in ppFEV1 at 
screening and at baseline study visit. Although TEZ/IVA showed clinically relevant differences over 
placebo, the benefit in ppFEV1 over ivacaftor monotherapy is small (2.1 percentage points), but is 
relevant, in relation to an overall estimated annualized ppFEV1 rate of decline of –1.05 percentage 
point in F/RF patients. The male and female subgroups had trends that were consistent with this 
finding. The reduction of the estimated event rate was even higher with ivacaftor monotherapy (0.29 
events oer year) than for TEZ/IVA (0.34 events per year). However, as previously discussed, the 
exacerbation rate is not a reliable parameter measured over such a short time.  
In the secondary endpoint CFQ-R a numerical higher but not clinically relevant score was observed 
(mean treatment difference of TEZ/IVA vs. IVA of 1.4 points), but the responder analysis showed a 
somewhat more distinctive difference (65.2% versus 58.3%). For sweat chloride and pulmonary 
exacerbation rate there were no meaningful differences. Taking all data together, there is a benefit for 
TEZ/IVA over ivacaftor monotherapy. Some support is derived from study 101 in patients with 
F/G551D mutations taking TEZ on top of physician prescribed Kalydeco, who had an improvement in 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 106/144 
 
 
 
 
 
ppFEV1 of 3.20 percentage points compared to Kalydeco alone, but the duration of the treatment 
period was rather short (28 days). 
The preliminary results of study 110 at the time of first interim analysis (IA1), including 70% of the 
sample size of study 108 who had completed the Week 16 visit in study 110, support the maintenance 
of the effect.  At Week 16 of interim analysis 1, all groups achieved a clinically relevant improvement 
from baseline of the parent study for absolute change in ppFEV1:  5.9 pp (95% CI: 4.1, 7.7) in the 
IVA-TEZ/IVA group, 7.4 pp (5.6, 9.1) in the TEZ/IVA group and 4.6 pp (2.9, 6.3) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA 
group. Improvement of ppFEV1 was evident at Day 15 for patients on previous placebo treatment. 
Results from the second interim analysis (IA2) show that at week 16 of study 110 the mean within-
group change was 0.0 pp (-1.2, 1.3) in the TEZ/IVA group, i.e., the effect achieved in the parent study 
108 is kept at week 16 of study 110 although further gain over that achieved in the parent study is not 
observed at the time of the interim analysis 2.  
The results of the CFQ-R respiratory domain score for the 108/110 efficacy set are reassuring but 
these patients are only treated for 24 or 16 weeks with TEZ/IVA. The proportion of patients who met 
or exceeded the MCID at the conclusion of Study 108 (53.9%) was maintained through an additional 
16 weeks of TEZ/IVA treatment in Study 110 (62.2%) and also supports the maintenance of effect. 
The annualised event rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 0.34 for PBO-TEZ/IVA, 0.39 for IVA-
TEZ/IVA and 0.20 for TEZ/IVA in the study 108/110 PEx efficacy set (IA1). This is lower than the event 
rate for the placebo group in Study 108 (0.63). However, the overall time was still too short for 
measuring exacerbations, i.e., 8 weeks in study 108 and 16 weeks in study 110. At IA2 of Study 110, 
the low PEx event rate was maintained at 0.22 events per year in the TEZ/IVA group. Thus, the PEx 
rate was unchanged between IA1 and IA2. The event rate of pulmonary exacerbations requiring IV 
antibiotic therapy is low given the usually milder disease of subjects with CFTR mutations with residual 
function. 
A gain in BMI and weight is consistently present from the start of treatment of TEZ/IVA, with an 
additional mean (SD) improvement in BMI of 0.54 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.76) at Week 16 of Study 
110 (IA2) in the TEZ/IVA group while in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group the mean change was 0.35 kg/m2 
(0.14, 0.56).  
In study 110 IA2 there were 32 adolescent subjects (< 18 years old). Fourteen (14) were analysed in 
the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group, 8 in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group, and 10 in the TEZ/IVA group. Their mean (SD) 
BMI z-scores were 0.14 (1.26), −0.22 (1.03), and −0.03 (122) respectively. All subjects had baseline 
ppFEV1 40 to <70 (53.1%) or ≥70 to ≤ 90 (46.9%). At baseline, the majority of subjects less than 18 
years old with ppFEV1 below 70 were in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA and IVA-TEZ/IVA groups (i.e., 57.1% and 
62.5% respectively vs. 40% in the TEZ/IVA group).  
Results from mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of the absolute change from 
baseline in ppFEV1 for subjects <18 years old at screening of the parent study show that the mean  
within-group absolute change from baseline at study 110 week-16 in ppFEV1 was 7.2 pp (95% CI: 4.8, 
9.7) in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group, 1.6 pp (−1.5, 4.8) in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group and 0.7 (−2.2, 3.6) in 
the TEZ/IVA group compared to 4.4 pp, 2.5 pp, and 0.0 pp in adult subjects. In terms of BMI z-score, 
the mean change was as follows: 0.04 (−0.07, 0.14) in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group, −0.13 (−0.26, 0.01) 
in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group, and 0.16 (0.04, 0.28) in the TEZ/IVA group. Of note, the mean (SD) BMI z-
scores at baseline were 0.14 (1.26), −0.22 (1.03), and −0.03 (1.22) respectively suggesting a benefit 
for adolescents treated with tezacaftor/ivacaftor. However, numbers are small and these data should 
be interpreted with caution.

The pivotal study faces the concern of the short duration and would not fulfil the requirement as laid 
down in the CF guideline. However, the 16 weeks extension data provided supportive evidence up to 
24 weeks. Moreover, as already indicated in the CHMP SA support can also be derived for the data in 
other populations; the similar pattern of effect to the CF patients with F/F mutation and the similar 
early improvement at Day 15 supports extrapolation of the results in CF patients with F/F mutation to 
subject with F/RF mutation. 
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second 
mutation that is not likely to respond to TEZ and/or IVA therapy (F508del/NR) 
In study 107 (N= 168 patients), the difference in absolute change in ppFEV1 between TEZ/IVA and 
placebo group was 1.2 pp (95% CI: -0.3, 2.6; P = 0.1176). The 1-sided 80% upper confidence bound 
(UCB) was below the predefined futility boundary of 2.5pp. The study has been prematurely stopped 
because of lack of efficacy.  
All patients 
The number of patients ≥ 65 years old was initially not presented. There were 6 patients in this age 
group, all of them enrolled in study 108. No notable trends were observed in these subjects compared 
to the overall study population. However, as the follow up of the benefit in elderly is warranted, it is 
part of the regular follow-up within the RMP.   
Withdrawal effect  
Studies 101 and 103 provide information about treatment withdrawal on ppFEV1. Changes in ppFEV1 
after discontinuation of treatment showed that the improvements in ppFEV1 during 4 weeks of 
TEZ/IVA treatment were lost 1 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of dosing. However, as preservation of 
lung function by a CTFR modifier will need much longer time than 1 month, this loss of effect is not 
considered indicative for long term effects.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Adolescents were included together with adults in the pivotal trials. Subgroup analyses of the primary 
endpoint were done using a model similar to that for the primary analysis. Subgroup analyses showed 
statistically significant and consistent changes in ppFEV1 regardless of age. The changes in ppFEV1 
were similar (study 106) or better (study 108). Adolescent data were, however, not specifically 
discussed for study 110. Adolescents are at higher risk of lung function and nutritional status decline. 
This is the reason why analyses of various efficacy endpoints restricted to them were requested in the 
frame of the interim analysis 2 of study 110. These have been discussed, see above.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype 
Although there is consistency of responses in FEV1 between phase II and phase III studies, suggesting 
superiority of the combination, this is in contrast to the sweat chloride results. The absence of evidence 
comparing TEZ/IVA versus TEZ in homozygous F508del-CFTR patients leaves a number of questions 
unanswered. However, this ongoing uncertainty is set against i) the level of unmet need in F508del 
homozygous patients who cannot tolerate or take LUM/IVA or where LUM/IVA is inadvisable; and ii) 
the demonstration of superiority for TEZ/IVA over placebo in homozygous F508del patients resulting in 
relevant improvements in this population.

Efficacy is supported by a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 
compared to placebo. The results of the primary analysis were confirmed by the sensitivity analysis 
and by the secondary endpoints such as number/rate of exacerbations. Consistent and significant 
benefits in ppFEV1 favouring TEZ/IVA were observed across all pre-specified subgroups. In addition, in 
a comparison with natural history data, the benefit of the treatment seems established although some 
uncertainty remains regarding that the data provided to put in context the results of the treatment 
with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in study 106 and in study 110 are not fully available in the public domain.  
The results of the first interim analysis (IA1) of study 110, an open label extension study, point to the 
maintenance of the effect seen in the parent study 106 after a period of treatment with 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor of approximately 48 weeks in the TEZ/IVA group. The results of interim analysis 2 
(IA2) suggest that further gain over that achieved after 24 weeks of treatment with 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor in study 106 is not obtained. Data for adolescents were provided in the frame of 
IA2.  Overall, these results suggest that young subjects homozygous for F508del are at higher risk of 
lung and nutritional status decline.  
Compared to Orkambi in its registration trials, the results of ppFEV1 appear better, but for the long 
term data, this still needs to be confirmed when additional analysis of data of study 110 are available 
(e.g.,  data beyond 24 weeks).    
The results of study 104 confirmed that ivacaftor alone is not efficacious in subjects with F/F genotype. 
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second 
allele with residual function  
The current proposed indication reflects the evidence collected in patients. The actual and precise 
relationship of the extent of in vitro responsiveness and in vivo effectiveness in patients with CF is still 
unclear and therefore inclusion of CFTR mutations identified as responsive to TEZ/IVA based only on 
the FRT in vitro model is not pursued anymore.   
Efficacy is supported by a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 
compared to placebo. The improvement in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain of 11.1 points (average of week 
4 and week 8) is above the MCID of 4 points and apparently sustained for up to 24 weeks in total. 
Other (non-key) secondary endpoints supported the results of the primary endpoint. Thus overall, the 
benefit of TEZ/IVA compared to placebo is considered demonstrated. Due to the statistical approach 
statistical significance cannot be declared against ivacaftor.    
However, continuous treatment duration with TEZ/IVA was too short to assess maintenance of efficacy. 
The similar pattern of effect to the CF patients with F/F mutation and the similarity in early 
improvement at Day 15 provides further support.  In addition, as for the patients with F/F mutation a 
comparison with natural history data, the benefit of the treatment seems established. Some 
uncertainty remains regarding the fact that the data provided to put in context the results of the 
treatment with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in study 108 and in study 110 are not fully available in the public 
domain.  
TEZ/IVA was also numerically better than IVA alone, indicating the additional effect of tezacaftor to 
ivacaftor. However, the benefit over ivacaftor monotherapy is small (2.1 percentage points), but is 
considered relevant, in relation to an overall estimated annualized ppFEV1 rate of decline of –1.05 
percentage point in F/RF patients (excluding subjects with an R117H-CFTR mutation). Taking all data 
together, there appears to be a benefit for TEZ/IVA over ivacaftor.  
The results for most of the mutations with clinical data are considered sufficient.

Finally, the CHMP agreed that Kalydeco 150 mg tablets can be indicated in combination regimen with 
Symkevi tablets for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one 
of the following mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: 
P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 
2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety analysis included all safety data available from 14 clinical studies with tezacaftor (TEZ) 
monotherapy or tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA), see figure Figure 15 below. 
Figure 15 Overview of Studies (N=14) Included in SCS 
Three safety datasets were defined. 
Phase 3-controlled Safety Set (PC-SS): Main safety data is derived from pooled analyses of the 3 
completed Phase 3 studies of TEZ/IVA combination therapy (Studies 106, 107 and 108) and was called 
the Phase 3-controlled Safety Set (PC-SS). The 3 Phase III studies were designed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of TEZ 100 mg once daily in combination with IVA 150 mg every 12 hours versus 
placebo for up to 24 weeks. 
Long term safety data sets (OLE-SS and LT-SS): Long-term safety of TEZ/IVA in patients with CF was 
presented from open label extension Study 110 (OLE-SS) and from all patients with ≥ 48 weeks of 
TEZ/IVA exposure during the parent study and/or Study 110 (long term safety data set, LT-SS).  
Supportive studies: Supportive analyses included pooled safety data from 8 Phase 1 studies in healthy 
subjects, and safety data from two individual Phase II studies.

Patient exposure 
Pooled safety Analysis of Phase III Placebo-controlled Studies (PC-SS): Total exposure (patient years, 
[PY]), total number of subjects included in the PC-SS, number of subjects by study, and number of 
subjects by exposure duration interval were well balanced between the placebo and TEZ/IVA groups 
(see table below). The mean (SD) treatment duration was similar for the placebo (16.3 [7.5] weeks) 
and the TEZ/IVA (16.2 [7.7] weeks) groups. There were 245 (48.5%) subjects in the placebo group 
and 238 (48.0%) subjects in the TEZ/IVA group who had >16 weeks exposure. 
Table 33 Summary of Exposure: Placebo-controlled Safety Set 
Study 110 Interim Analysis (OLE-SS): Study drug exposure for subjects in the OLE-SS is summarized 
in the Table 34. Exposure durations include duration of study drug exposure in Study 110 only; study 
drug exposure during the parent studies is not included. A total of 867 subjects were exposed to 
TEZ/IVA in the OLE-SS: 390 subjects (45.0%) in the Placebo-TEZ/IVA group who had received placebo 
in the parent study treatment period before enrolling in Study 110 and 477 subjects (55.0%) in the 
Active-TEZ/IVA group who had received active study drug (either IVA or TEZ/IVA) in the parent study 
treatment period before enrolling in Study 110. Mean exposure duration for subjects in the OLE-SS 
(includes duration of study drug exposure in Study 110 only; exclusive of the exposure duration in the 
parent studies) was 33.5 weeks overall (32.5 weeks in the Placebo-TEZ/IVA group and 34.3 weeks in 
the Active-TEZ/IVA group). Thus, mean exposure duration for subjects in the OLE-SS is approximately 
2-fold that of subjects in the pooled Phase 3 PC-SS (16.3 weeks).

Table 34 Summary of Exposure: OLE Safety Set 
Long-term Safety Set (LT-SS): Study drug exposure is summarised for subjects in the LT-SS in the 
Table 35. In accordance with ICH E1 guidelines, the LT-SS was designed to evaluate safety in subjects 
who have approximately 1 year of exposure to TEZ/IVA. A total of 326 subjects were included in the 
LT-SS and received ≥48 weeks of TEZ/IVA treatment during the parent study and/or Study 110. 
Median exposure for subjects in the LT-SS was 67.7 weeks; mean (SD) exposure duration was 69.0 
(15.3) weeks, ranging from 48 to 116 weeks. Thus, mean exposure duration for subjects in the LT-SS 
was approximately 4-fold that of the pooled Phase 3 PC-SS (16.3 weeks).

Adverse events 
AEs were collected continuously during all studies. An AE was defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a subject during the study; the event did not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
the active treatment. TEAEs were defined as any AEs that increased in severity or that were newly 
developed at or after the first dose of study drug through the end of the treatment-emergent period. 
For consistency, AEs from all studies included in the pooled safety sets were aligned to MedDRA 
Version 19.1. 
Pooled Analysis of Phase 3 Placebo-controlled Studies (PC-SS): Across all endpoints, incidences of AEs 
were either similar between the placebo and TEZ/IVA groups or lower in the TEZ/IVA group. The 
overall percentage of subjects with AEs was higher in the placebo group (86.9%) versus the TEZ/IVA 
group (82.3%). There were no deaths. The percentage of subjects with SAEs was lower in the TEZ/IVA 
group (10.1%) than in the placebo group (14.9%). The percentages of subjects with Grade 3 (severe) 
and Grade 4 (life-threatening) AEs, related SAEs, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation and AEs 
leading to treatment interruptions were low and similar between the placebo and TEZ/IVA group (see 
table 36).  
Table 36 Overview of the Adverse Events: Placebo-controlled Safety Set 
Study 110 Interim Analysis (OLE-SS): The overall percentage of subjects with AEs in the OLE-SS 
(82.2%) was similar to the placebo (86.9%) and TEZ/IVA (82.3%) groups in the pooled Phase 3 PC-
SS. There were no deaths reported in the OLE-SS. Given the approximately 2-fold increased duration 
of exposure in the OLE-SS compared to the PC-SS, the percentage of subjects in the OLE-SS with SAEs 
was comparable (20.0%) to the percentage of subjects with SAEs in the placebo (14.9%) and TEZ/IVA 
(10.1%) groups in the pooled Phase 3 PC-SS, despite an approximately 2-fold higher mean exposure 
duration to TEZ/IVA in the OLE-SS. The percentages of subjects with Grade 3 (severe) and Grade 4 
(life-threatening) AEs, related SAEs, and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation in the OLE-SS were 
low and similar to the pooled Phase 3 PC-SS, see table 37.

Table 37 Overview of the Adverse Events: OLE Safety Set 
Long-term Safety Set (LT-SS): Mean exposure duration for subjects in the LT-SS was approximately 4-
fold that of the pooled Phase 3 PC-SS. There were no deaths reported in the LT-SS. The percentage of 
subjects with SAEs was 29.1%, and the percentage of subjects with Grade 3 (severe) and Grade 4 
(life-threatening) AEs was 16.3%. A low percentage of subjects had related SAEs (1.8%) and AEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation (0.3%).  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Respiratory events and elevated transaminases were specified to be of particular interest due to a risk 
of transient decline in FEV1 following treatment initiation with Orkambi and elevated transaminases in 
patients receiving Kalydeco who have pre-existing hepatic enzyme elevation and also in some patients 
receiving Orkambi.  
Transaminase elevations: These are common in CF due to the disease, and have also been 
documented in some patients receiving Kalydeco and Orkambi. A comprehensive review of the PC-SS 
data was conducted for AEs associated with elevated transaminases, AEs related to hepatobiliary 
events, and liver function test laboratory changes (i.e., alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST]). During the placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (up to 24 weeks), the 
incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, or >3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
were similar between Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor- and placebo-treated patients; 0.2%, 
1.0%, and 3.6% in Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor-treated patients, and 0.4%, 1.0%, and 
3.4% in placebo-treated patients. One patient (0.2%) on therapy and 2 patients (0.4%) on placebo 
permanently discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases. The majority of the elevated 
transaminase events were mild or moderate in severity. There were no elevated transaminase events 
that were considered serious. No patients treated with Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor 
experienced a transaminase elevation >3 x ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin >2 x ULN. The 
incidence and patterns of events for subjects who received ≥48 weeks of TEZ/IVA (LT-SS) remained

lowed (6.7%) and similar to the incidence in subjects in PC-SS (3.6% in the placebo group and 3.4% 
in the TEZ/IVA group). 
Respiratory Adverse Events and Spirometry: Due to the warning and precaution about respiratory AEs 
in the label for Orkambi, which has the same mechanism of action as TEZ/IVA, respiratory AEs and 
serial post-dose spirometry were evaluated in the TEZ/IVA Phase 3 studies. Respiratory events in the 
PC-SS were collectively assessed and included the following PTs: asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, 
bronchospasm, wheezing, chest discomfort, dyspnea, and respiration abnormal. The incidence of 
subjects with respiratory events was numerically lower for TEZ/IVA (11.3%) than placebo (14.7%). No 
individual respiratory events occurred in a greater incidence in subjects in the TEZ/IVA group than in 
the placebo group. All respiratory events were mild to moderate in severity. No subjects in the TEZ/IVA 
group had an event leading to discontinuation. A sub-analysis of PTs related to respiratory symptoms 
(i.e., chest discomfort, dyspnoea, and respiration abnormal) also demonstrated a lower incidence in 
TEZ/IVA (8.9%) than placebo (11.5%). No apparent pattern of time course in the onset of respiratory 
events or respiratory symptoms was identified from the Study 106 or Study 110 data. 
In the PC-SS, subjects <18 years of age had postdose spirometry assessments to detect any postdose 
decline in ppFEV1. On Days 1 and 15, the postdose (2 and 4 hour) ppFEV1 values showed no evidence 
of decline from the predose ppFEV1 for the placebo or TEZ/IVA groups. A subgroup analysis of AEs by 
baseline lung disease (baseline ppFEV1 <40, ≥40 to <70, or ≥70) found a trend of lower incidence of 
respiratory adverse events for subjects receiving TEZ/IVA compared to placebo for all subgroups, 
including those with the most severe lung disease (ppFEV1 <40). 
Adverse drug reactions: AEs that were identified as potential ADRs and occurred in at least 3% of 
subjects who received TEZ/IVA and that had at least a 1% greater incidence than in the placebo group 
were headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea, sinus congestion, and dizziness. These are proposed for 
inclusion as adverse reactions in the SmPC. A similar safety profile regarding related AEs was observed 
in the OLE-SS and LT-SS analyses.  
Adverse Events by Severity: The majority of AEs in both the placebo and TEZ/IVA treatment groups 
were mild or moderate in severity. There were no imbalances in the incidence of mild (Grade 1), 
moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), or life-threatening (Grade 4) AEs between the placebo and 
TEZ/IVA group, see table below.

There were no imbalances in the incidence of Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs in the TEZ/IVA group (7.1%) 
relative to the placebo group (8.5%). Most of the Grade 3 or 4 AEs were respiratory and 
gastrointestinal events. Infective pulmonary exacerbations of CF and hemoptysis were the only Grade 
3 or 4 AEs that had an incidence of at least 1% in either treatment group. Similarly, the majority of 
subjects in the OLE-Safety Set had AEs that were mild or moderate. Grade 3 (severe) or Grade 4 (life-
threatening) AEs occurred in 10.3% of patients. There were no imbalances in the incidence of mild 
(Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), or life-threatening (Grade 4) AEs between the 
Placebo-TEZ/IVA and Active-TEZ/IVA group. The only Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE that was reported in >1% 
of all patients in the OLE-SS was infective PEx of CF (4.6%). 
The majority of subjects in the LT-SS (78.8%) had AEs that were mild or moderate, similar to the 
incidence in the pooled Phase 3 PC-SS (placebo group [78.4%], TEZ/IVA group [75.2%]). Grade 3 or 4 
AEs occurred in 16.3% of subjects in the LT-SS. 
The second most common Grade 3 or 4 AE was gastroenteritis, occurring in 1.2% of patients in the LT-
SS. All other Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in <1% of subjects. As noted above, 2 patients in the LT-SS  
had Grade 4 life-threatening AEs (2 suicide attempts) during Study 110. 
Other significant events: The incidence of SAEs was higher in the placebo group (14.9%) than in the 
TEZ/IVA group (10.1%; see table 39). The only SAEs that occurred in ≥1% of patients in either 
treatment group were infective PEx of CF and haemoptysis. The incidence of infective PEx of CF was 
higher in the placebo group (10.3%) than in the TEZ/IVA group (6.7%); the incidence of haemoptysis 
was similar between the placebo (1.2%) and the TEZ/IVA (1.0%) group.

Related SAEs: The incidence of related SAEs was similar between the placebo group (1.4%) and 
TEZ/IVA group (1.0%). Related SAEs that occurred in 2 or more patients in either treatment group 
were hemoptysis (0% in the placebo group and 0.4% in the total TEZ/IVA group) and infective PEx of 
CF (0.6% in the placebo group and 0.2% in the total TEZ/IVA group). In the OLE-SS, SAEs were 
reported in 20.3% of patients in the Active-TEZ/IVA arm and 19.5% in the Placebo-TEZ/IVA arm. The 
most common SAEs (occurring in at least 2 patients) were infective PEx of CF (117 [13.5%] patients), 
hemoptysis (16 [1.8%] patients), distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS, 7 [0.8%] patients), 
constipation (4 [0.5%] patients), abdominal pain (3 [0.3%] patients), and influenza (3 [0.3%] 
patients). SAEs considered related to treatment that occurred in more than 2 patients were infective 
PEx of CF (5 [0.6%] patients) and blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased (2 [0.2%] patients). 
Overall, 29.1% of patients in the LT-SS had an SAE. SAEs considered related to treatment occurred in 
6 (1.8%) patients in the LT-SS, similar to the incidence in patients in the pooled Phase 3 PC-SS (1.4% 
in the placebo group and 1.0% in the TEZ/IVA group). SAEs that occurred in more than 2 patients in 
the LT-SS were similar to those that occurred in the pooled Phase 3 PC-SS and the OLE-SS, and 
included infective PEx of CF (63 [19.3%] patients), hemoptysis (11 [3.4%] patients), influenza (4 
[1.2%] patients), DIOS (3 [0.9%] patients), and pneumonia (3 [0.9%] patients). As in the OLE-SS, 
the only SAE considered related to treatment to occur in more than 2 patients in the LT-SS was 
infective PEx of CF (3 [0.9%] patients). There were no deaths reported in the TEZ/IVA clinical 
development program. 
Laboratory findings 
The descriptive statistics and threshold analyses for clinical laboratory parameters (serum chemistry, 
haematology, and coagulation studies), vital signs, physical examinations, and ECGs assessed in PC-SS 
showed minor differences between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups that were not considered to be 
clinically meaningful. Patients with CF are chronically ill, experience frequent infections, take numerous 
medications, and have disease-related metabolic abnormalities. Thus, fluctuations in laboratory 
parameters are common. The incidence of laboratory abnormalities resulting in reports of adverse 
events was generally similar between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups. 
In the PC-SS, there were no clinically meaningful differences in any ECG parameter between TEZ/IVA 
and placebo. Earlier safety data in healthy volunteers suggest that VX-661 and its major metabolites 
may have low potential for drug-induced QT prolongation. A QT/QTc study was performed and showed 
no clinically relevant trends in standard ECG parameters, including no clinically significant increases or 
decreases over time in mean HR in patients receiving TEZ, compared to patients receiving placebo or 
moxifloxacin. There were no relevant differences between the therapeutic and supra-therapeutic TEZ 
doses. No evidence was observed for QT prolongation, and no subject receiving TEZ at therapeutic and 
supratherapeutic doses had QTcF interval of >450 msec, or increase of >60 msec. 
Results of study 103 confirmed that there was no evidence of clinically meaningful changes in 
gastrointestinal function observed in VCE at Week 13, or in laboratory data or AEs after up to a 
minimum of 40 weeks and maximum of 48 weeks of treatment (OLE phase) with TEZ/IVA. 
Due to existing warnings and precautions for IVA related to cataracts, ophthalmologic assessments 
were performed. Only Study 106 was long enough (24-week treatment duration) to allow detection of 
treatment-emergent cataracts. In this study, the incidences of treatment-emergent cataracts (not 
present at baseline) were 5.2% in the placebo group and 6.9% in the TEZ/IVA group. The incidence of 
resolved cataracts (presents at baseline and not present at the follow-up exam) were 25% in the 
placebo group and 33% in the TEZ/IVA groups. There were no SAEs or discontinuations due to 
cataracts in the TEZ/IVA group. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are

recommended in paediatric patients initiating ivacaftor treatment, either in monotherapy or in a 
combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor, as stated in the SmPC of Kalydeco. 
Safety in special populations 
Age: Of 1001 patients who received study drug, 199 patients (19.8%) were ≥12 to <18 years of age. 
The safety profile of TEZ/IVA was largely similar in patients ≥12 to <18 years of age and adults. The 
incidence of SAEs in the TEZ/IVA group was slightly higher (4% difference between groups) in 
adolescent patients ≥12 to <18 years of age compared to adults >18 years, but the incidences were 
lower than in the placebo arms of each subgroup. AEs that were at least 5% more common in subjects 
≥12 to <18 years of age than in subjects ≥18 years of age in the TEZ/IVA group were cough, infective 
PEx of CF, and headache. Of these, only the incidence of headache was slightly higher in subjects in 
the TEZ/IVA group than in the placebo group within each age subgroup. AEs that were at least 5% 
more common in subjects ≥18 years of age than in subjects ≥12 to <18 years of age in the TEZ/IVA 
group were nasopharyngitis and haemoptysis. Only the incidence of nasopharyngitis was slightly higher 
in the TEZ/IVA group compared to placebo within each age subgroup. 
Safety data in patients ≥65 years old are limited because the Phase 3 studies of TEZ/IVA did not 
include sufficient numbers of patients in this age group. 
Gender: Approximately equal numbers of females (506 [50.5%]) and males (495 [49.5%]) were 
included in the PC-SS. The most common AEs by PT for males and females were similar to the most 
common AEs observed in subjects overall. The only SAE to occur in >10% of subjects overall in any 
group was infective PEx of CF, which had a higher incidence for females than males, consistent with 
the overall trend observed for all AEs. However, the incidences of infective PEx of CF were lower for 
both sexes with TEZ/IVA treatment (male: 20.2%; female: 26.9%) compared to placebo (male: 
25.4%; female: 35.0%). 
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful trends associated with sex in subjects receiving TEZ/IVA in 
the pooled Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies. While there was a higher overall incidence of females 
who had AEs than males, the incidences of subjects with AEs were typically lower in the TEZ/IVA 
groups than in the placebo groups, suggesting that this difference was unlikely attributable to TEZ/IVA 
treatment. 
Race: A subgroup analysis by race was not conducted for any of the Pooled Safety Sets, as the number 
of subjects in the other racial subgroups was too small for reliable comparative analyses. 
Renal Impairment: Renal clearance was not expected to play a major role in the elimination of TEZ and 
IVA. PK studies of TEZ/IVA have not been done in subjects with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 
59 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance 15 to 29 mL/min) renal impairment. Therefore, a safety 
assessment of TEZ/IVA in subjects with renal impairment was not conducted. No dose adjustment is 
recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Caution 
is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, as per the SmPC 
recommendation. 
Hepatic Impairment: Hepatic metabolism plays a major role in the elimination of TEZ and IVA. 
Moderate hepatic impairment increased TEZ and IVA exposures, and a reduced dose is recommended. 
There is no experience with TEZ/IVA with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, its use is not 
recommended in section 4.2 of the SmPC, unless the benefits outweigh the risks. In such cases, 
TEZ/IVA should be used in a reduced dose and ivacafotr should not be administered in the evening.

CFTR Genotype: Based on the similar safety profile observed with approved CFTR modulators across 
genotypes, all genotypes were pooled for the placebo-controlled database to provide the largest 
possible safety database. There were no meaningful differences in safety profile of TEZ/IVA in Studies 
106, 107, or 108.  
Baseline ppFEV1: Pooled placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies enrolled subjects with FEV1 ≥40% and 
≤90% of predicted normal for age, sex, and height at screening. Patients were stratified at 
randomization for ppFEV1 <70% and ≥70% at screening. To assess the impact of pp FEV1 on safety, 
subgroup analyses were conducted in patients with ppFEV1 ≥40 and <70, patients with ppFEV1 ≥70 
and in patients with ppFEV1 <40 at baseline. The majority (61.3%) had baseline ppFEV1 ≥40 to 
<70%, followed by those with baseline ppFEV1 ≥70 (29.4%). Although patients were excluded if they 
had a ppFEV1 <40% at screening, some patients (9.2%) had ppFEV1 <40% at baseline (43 placebo 
patients; 49 TEZ/IVA patients). The numbers of patients in each ppFEV1 category were similar in the 
TEZ/IVA and IVA groups.  
The incidence of patients with AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was low (≤2.1%) and similar to 
placebo (≤2.6%) across all ppFEV1 subgroups for patients receiving TEZ/IVA. Overall, there were no 
clinically meaningful differences in the pattern of adverse events rates related to severity of lung 
disease at baseline between TEZ/IVA and placebo 
Geographic Region: There were no clinically meaningful trends associated with geographic region 
(European, including Australia and Israel [61.5%] vs. North American [38.5%]) in subjects in the 
pooled Phase 3 PC-SS. 
Pregnancy and lactation: The effects of TEZ and IVA on conception, pregnancy, and lactation in 
humans are not known as no adequate and well-controlled studies of TEZ and IVA in pregnant or 
lactating women have been conducted. There were 5 pregnancies reported in phase 3 trials; the 
outcome is known for 3 of them. Three healthy children were born. For the remaining two, the 
outcome is not known due to lost to follow-up and to lack of agreement to sign pregnancy informed 
consent form. Given the limited data available on pregnancy outcomes after TEZ/IVA exposure during 
pregnancy or lactation, TEZ/IVA combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy or lactation 
unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the potential risk, as stated in the SmPC. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Please refer to earlier discussion regarding PK interactions (CYP3A inducer/inhibitor interactions). No 
additional safety information regarding interactions has been identified in the pooled safety database. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation of study drug: The rate for AE leading to treatment discontinuation in the PC-SS was 
2.0% for the placebo group and 1.6% for TEZ/IVA. In the PC-SS, the AEs leading to discontinuation 
that occurred in at least 2 patients in either treatment group were abdominal pain, alanine 
aminotransferase increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, fatigue, headache, and 
oropharyngeal pain. Of these events occurring in at least 2 patients, the only AE leading to treatment 
discontinuation that had a higher incidence in the TEZ/IVA group (0.4%; 2 patients) than the placebo 
group (0 patients) was abdominal pain. 
Interruption of study drug: The incidence of AEs leading to treatment interruption was low and 
balanced between the placebo (3.6%) and TEZ/IVA (2.4%) group in the PC-SS. There were no AEs 
leading to treatment interruption occurring in >1% of patients in either treatment group. The AEs that 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018

occurred in at least 2 patients that led to treatment interruption in either group were distal intestinal 
obstruction syndrome (DIOS), alanine aminotransferase increased, infective PEx of CF, hemoptysis, 
abdominal pain, nausea, and aspartate aminotransferase increased. Of these, DIOS was the only AE 
that occurred in a higher incidence in patients in the TEZ/IVA group (0.6%, 3 patients) than the 
placebo group (0 patients). The 3 events of DIOS were considered not related to treatment. 
Post marketing experience 
TEZ/IVA is not marketed in any EU country. As of June 2017, IVA monotherapy (Kalydeco) is approved 
for the treatment of CF in patients as young as 2 years old with certain CFTR mutations in Australia, 
Canada, EU, Israel, Liechtenstein, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the US. The age groups and 
genotypes included in the indication differ by region. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient population and exposure 
Main safety data was derived from pooled analyses of the 3 completed Phase 3 studies of TEZ/IVA 
combination therapy (Studies 106, 107 and 108). In this Phase III controlled safety set (PC-SS), 496 
patients received TEZ/IVA and 505 patients received placebo. Mean treatment duration was 16 weeks 
in both groups. Long-term safety of TEZ/IVA in patients with CF was presented from open label 
extension Study 110 (OLE-SS). Furthermore, long-term safety data was presented separately for a 
selection of these patients, i.e. those with minimal 48 weeks of TEZ/IVA exposure (long term safety 
data set, LT-SS). Mean treatment duration was approximately 2-fold in the OLE Study (33.5 weeks) 
compared to the PC-SS, and 4-fold in the LT-SS (69 weeks). More than 100 patients (i.e. n=326) have 
been exposed to TEZ/IVA combination therapy for at least 48 weeks in line with the guidelines on 
minimum exposure data for safety analyses of long-term therapy. In response to CHMP’s request 
during the evaluation, the MAH recalculated exposure duration, accounting for interruptions and 
discontinuations. Recalculated exposure data were, similar to original exposure data, well balanced 
between treatment arm, which was reassuring. 
Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths 
Nearly all patients in both arms of the PC-SS experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE (82.3% 
of patients in the TEZ/IVA arm and 86.9% in the placebo arm). The most common AEs (respiratory 
and gastrointestinal events) in patients who received TEZ/IVA in clinical studies were mild to moderate 
in severity and were common manifestations typical for patients with CF. The only TEAEs with an 
incidence of at least 5% in either treatment group, that were numerically higher in the TEZ/IVA group 
than in the placebo group, were headache (13.7% versus 11.3%), nasopharyngitis (11.5% versus 
9.7%), and nausea (7.7% versus 6.7%). Related AEs occurred in similar frequencies between the 
TEZ/IVA (23.6%) and placebo group (22.2%). The MAH’s response to the CHMP’s questions provided 
reassurance that the incidences of related AEs in the TEZ/IVA group were consistently lower or similar 
to the incidence in the placebo group in the PC-SS. There was no increase in the incidence of related 
AEs in the OLE-SS and LT-SS, when considering the increased exposure in the long term safety sets.  
Grade 3-4 AEs were also reported with similar frequencies in both arms. Infective PEx of CF and 
hemoptysis were the only Grade 3 or 4 AEs that had an incidence of at least 1% in either treatment 
group.  
Blood creatinine phosphokinase increased has been reported by patients who received Orkambi but it 
was not considered an adverse reaction (due to similar incidence on placebo arm). In the PC-Safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 120/144 
 
 
 
 
 
Set, 3 subjects reported a Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse event of blood creatinine phosphokinase 
increased (2 on placebo; 1 on TEZ/IVA).  
The rate for AE leading to treatment discontinuation (1.6% TEZ/IVA vs. 2% placebo) or treatment 
interruption (2.4% vs. 3.6%) in the PC-SS was low and balanced. Infective PEx of CF was the most 
common AE leading to treatment discontinuation, which, however, could be expected for patients with 
CF. 
The incidence of SAEs was lower in the TEZ/IVA group (10.1%), than in the placebo group (14.9%), 
driven largely by a reduced incidence of infective PEx of CF events in subjects in the TEZ/IVA group. 
There were no serious liver-related or respiratory AEs, as previously observed with Kalydeco/Orkambi.  
No deaths were reported in the TEZ/IVA clinical development program. 
The long term safety data sets OLE-SS and LT-SS showed increased frequencies of (related AEs), 
Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation with TEZ/IVA compared to the 
pooled Phase III PC-SS. However, it is agreed with the MAH that this is probably related to the 
increased mean exposure in the long term safety data sets (2-4 fold compared to the PC-SS). 
Moreover, the placebo-TEZ/IVA arm in the OLE-SS, that received TEZ/IVA for a much shorter time 
period compared to the Active-TEZ/IVA arm, showed a similar pattern. The type of AEs was similar to 
the pooled Phase 3 PC-SS, and consistent with AEs commonly observed in subjects with CF. As in the 
pooled Phase 3 PC-SS, the majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in the long term 
safety data sets. 
During the evaluation, the MAH clarified that a few immunological events have been reported, but none 
of the events that occurred among patients treated with TEZ/IVA were considered related to TEZ/IVA 
or resulted in treatment discontinuation, and all of these events were attributed to alternative 
etiologies.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Hepatic toxicity is a known adverse event for Kalydeco and Orkambi. In the current application, liver-
related AEs occurred in similar frequencies in the TEZ/IVA and placebo treatment groups in the PC-SS, 
and no serious elevated transaminase events were observed. However, in the Symkevi trials, exclusion 
criteria for patients with pre-existing liver function impairments were more stringent compared to the 
Orkambi trials. In the Symkevi trials patients were excluded when 2 out of the defined impairments 
were present while in the Orkambi trial this was the case for 3 out of these impairments. It is therefore 
not possible to directly compare the risk for hepatic toxicity in Orkambi and Symkevi. Despite the low 
incidence of liver related AEs in the current clinical trials with TEZ/IVA, it is therefore endorsed that a 
warning regarding the potential risk for elevated transaminases has been included in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC (similar to Kalydeco and Orkambi), and that it has been included as important potential risk in 
the summary of safety specifications in the RMP. 
Due to the warning and precaution about respiratory AEs in the label for Orkambi, respiratory AEs and 
serial post-dose spirometry were evaluated in the TEZ/IVA Phase 3 studies. No clinically meaningful 
trends in the respiratory-related AEs or post-dose spirometry data were observed, including those for 
patients with ppFEV1 <40 at baseline. 
Safety in special populations 
Age: no clinically relevant differences in safety profile of TEZ/IVA between patients ≥12 to <18 years 
of age and ≥18 years of age have been observed. It is acknowledged that data in the elderly 
population (>65 years) were very limited, as CF leads to a shortened life expectancy. Only 6 patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 121/144 
 
 
 
 
 
in the 3 placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical studies, were aged 65 years or older at screening. Of these 
6 patients, 4 received TEZ/IVA. Due to the small number of patients in this age group, no final 
conclusions regarding safety can be drawn. It is nevertheless reassuring that no apparent new safety 
signals were observed. 
CFTR genotype: the patient populations in the respective individual studies of the PC-SS differ 
substantially, as patients from numerous genotypes were included. Patients homozygous for the 
F508del mutation, as included in Study 106 generally have a relatively rapid disease progression, 
whereas mutations that result in a more modest reduction in CFTR mediated chloride transport 
(residual function CFTR mutation), may result in CF that is more slowly progressive. It is therefore 
anticipated that patients included in Study 108 might show a better safety profile compared to patients 
in Study 106. As this might influence the overall safety profile as observed in the PC-SS, the safety 
results have been assessed for the 3 separate Phase III Studies as well.  
The individual study reports of the three Phase III studies included in the integrated PC-SS analysis 
showed that AEs and SAEs indeed occurred most frequently in Study 106 (90.4% AE and 12.4% SAE 
Study 106 vs. 72.2% and 4.9% Study 108). However, a similar pattern is observed in the placebo 
arms of these studies. Moreover, differences in related (S)AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs between the three 
studies were less pronounced. In addition, the longer duration of study 106 compared to study 108 is 
prone to a higher incidence of AEs due to the longer exposure. Altogether, it is reassuring that as 
observed with the integrated PC-SS, the safety profile of TEZ/IVA treatment in the individual studies 
was similar or sometimes even better compared to the respective placebo arms. 
From the perspective of the current procedure, i.e., administration of ivacaftor in combination with 
tezacaftor, study 108 is the only that allows a direct comparison of ivacaftor monotherapy vs. the 
combination. This comparison is of interest, since all mutations that are registered for Kalydeco were 
investigated in clinical trials and are proposed for the indication. It is therefore reassuring that the 
frequency and type of AEs was largely similar between TEZ/IVA and IVA monotherapy. The presented 
data even suggested a numerical difference in favour of TEZ/IVA with regard to grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs 
and AEs leading to discontinuation. 
Pregnancy/lactation: the effects of TEZ/IVA on conception, pregnancy, and lactation are unknown. It is 
advised that TEZ/IVA should be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding only if the potential benefits 
are considered to outweigh the potential risks, as per the SmPC.  
As part of the marketing authorisation of Symkevi, the MAH also proposed category 3 for Study 117, 
as non-interventional post-authorization safety study (PASS) as per GVP Module VIII 
(EMA/813938/2011 Rev 3*). This registry study is expected provide further reassurance on the safety 
profile of the tezacaftor/ ivacaftor combination but the lack of a concurrent non-treated cohort is a 
significant unavoidable methodological limitation of the study. Taking into account that no new 
significant safety concerns have so far been identified with tezacaftor/ ivacaftor, the experience to date 
with ivacaftor, and the methodological limitations with the proposed registry study, it is accepted that 
the study be included in the RMP as a category 3 study. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
During the development programme of Kalydeco to be co-administered with Symkevi, no significant 
new or additional safety concerns were identified with the addition of TEZ to IVA.  
Overall, the safety profile of TEZ/IVA appeared similar across studies. There were no latent, late onset 
safety issues or risks identified in the long term safety sets. TEZ/IVA was well tolerated with low 
discontinuation rates due to AEs. As IVA is a component of the TEZ/IVA regimen, similar

recommendations to those in place for Kalydeco are proposed including routine monitoring of 
transaminases (in all patients) and baseline and follow-up eye examination (in paediatric patients). The 
safety data remain limited and further characterisation of the safety profile in paediatric patients is 
required in the post authorisation setting. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle

2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence, section 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 7 and 8 of the SmPC 
are updated. Annex A, the Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance. 
Annex II has been modified to remove a condition already fulfilled. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which 
were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Kalydeco. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has 
been found acceptable. 
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kalydeco (ivacaftor) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it has a PASS imposed either at the time of authorisation or afterwards; 
[REG Art 9(4)(cb), Art 10a(1)(a), DIR Art 21a(b), Art 22a(1)(a)]; 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities and 
high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene 
that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface that regulates salt and 
water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport results in the accumulation of 
thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal 
absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. Lung disease is the 
primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF. 
The claimed indication for Kalydeco 150 mg film-coated tablets in combination with Symkevi is: 
Kalydeco tablets are also indicated in a combination regimen with Symkevi for the treatment of 
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older. For indicated CFTR mutations, refer to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics of Symkevi. 
The proposed indication was not acceptable to the CHMP, due to the lack of reliable clinical data for 
some mutations. Hence, the indication was restricted to those mutations where sufficient clinical 
information has been provided by the MAH: 
Kalydeco tablets are also indicated in a combination regimen with tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg 
tablets for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one 
of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 
711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. 
Symkevi (TEZ/IVA) consists of two substances, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, that work by improving 
activity of CFTR in the lungs. Treatment with Symkevi is expected to thin the abnormal secretions, 
reduce symptoms of the disease and improve lung function. For the patients with CF heterozygous for 
the F508del/RF mutation, the indication reflects the clinical data collected in patients with RF- CFTR 
mutations identified as responsive to TEZ/IVA in in-vitro data models.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The vast majority of CF therapies target the symptoms of the disease such as nutritional supplements, 
antibiotics, and mucolytics. A few years ago, CFTR modulators became available which may have the 
potential to modify the progression of the disease. Two CFTR modulators are approved for the 
treatment of CF in the EU, Kalydeco (ivacaftor) and Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor). 
KALYDECO 
•  Kalydeco tablets are indicated for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 6 
years and older and weighing 25 kg or more who have one of the following gating (class III) 
mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, 
S549N or S549R.  
•  Kalydeco tablets are also indicated for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 
18 years and older who have an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene

•  Kalydeco granules are indicated for the treatment of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 2 
years and older and weighing less than 25 kg who have one of the following gating (class III) 
mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, 
S549N or S549R 
ORKAMBI 
•  Orkambi is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older 
who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. 
Symkevi (tezacaftor + ivacaftor) is a combination therapy combining the CFTR corrector tezacaftor, a 
compound designed to move the defective CFTR protein to the proper place in the airway cell surface, 
with the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor, which helps facilitate the opening of the chloride channel on the 
cell surface to allow chloride and sodium (salt) to move in and out of the cell. The distinction between 
correctors and potentiators is nonetheless questioned in the scientific literature due to the 
interdependence of chloride channel opening and CFTR subcellular localisation on protein folding.  
Symkevi targets several CFTR genotypes for which approved modulator therapies are not available. 
The F508del/Residual Function (RF) mutations represent ~ 9% of the CF population. The patients who 
harbour a mutation with a residual function are characterised by slower disease progression than the 
homogeneous F508 population, but they will eventually experience the clinical consequences of CF 
including a reduced lifespan. However, it is difficult to quantify the difference in survival or the 
development of irreversible damage over a short trial period considering the slower progression of 
disease.  
TEZ/IVA is also claimed to be an alternative for patients, who are homozygous for F508del and cannot 
tolerate or take LUM/IVA because of serious adverse events or certain concomitant medications, 
respectively.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study 106 in CF patients 12 years or older is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study in subjects homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. A total of 510 subjects were 
randomized. Placebo was used as the control treatment, because no CFTR modulators were approved 
at the time the study was conducted. Study 106 was powered for ppFEV1 and pulmonary 
exacerbations. Study 106 provided 24 weeks data. 
Study 108 in CF patients 12 years or older is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and 
ivacaftor-controlled, crossover study in subjects aged 12 years and older, heterozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second allele with a CFTR mutation predicted to have residual function. 
Alongside placebo, ivacaftor was deemed necessary because in vitro and clinical data support the 
potential efficacy of IVA monotherapy. Study 108 was powered for ppFEV1 and provided 8 weeks data. 
Study 110 is an open-label rollover study that enrolled subjects from the Phase 2 and 3 studies of 
TEZ/IVA. This study is designed to support long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy. An interim 
analysis was submitted allowing for evaluation of the persistence of efficacy beyond the treatment 
duration in the pivotal studies. As the date of data cut of the first interim analysis (IA1), 870 subjects 
had been enrolled from 4 parent studies among which 462 subjects from Study 106 with additional 24 
week treatment and 223 subjects from Study 108 with additional 16 week treatment. Upon CHMP 
request, a second interim analysis (IA2) of study 110 was submitted in which within-group changes in 
continuous variables were calculated using as baseline the last non-missing assessment before the first 
dose of TEZ/IVA in Study 110, while in the first interim analysis (IA1) the parent study baseline was 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 127/144 
 
 
 
 
 
used to calculate the absolute changes from baseline for all “treatment” groups, except for subjects 
randomized to the placebo arm in Study 106. As specific data for adolescent subjects were not 
discussed within IA1, these were requested with IA2.   
Two additional studies were submitted providing results for further mutations possibly beneficial from 
treatment of Symkevi, i.e., study 104 in CF patients 12 years or older with the F508del/F508del 
genotype in which ivacaftor monotherapy was assessed and study 107 in CF patients 12 years or older 
heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second allele not likely to respond to TEZ/IVA or 
ivacaftor therapy (F508del/NR).  
Study 109 was also submitted, which compared TEZ/IVA with IVA in 156 subjects aged 12 years and 
older with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and a second CFTR allele with a 
gating defect that is clinically demonstrated to be IVA-responsive. However, this study failed to show 
beneficial effect over ivacaftor. 
Dose finding was performed in two phase 2 studies. Study 101 and Study 103 evaluated different 
doses TEZ monotherapy and TEZ/IVA combination therapy in adult subjects with F/F genotype and 
study 101 also in adult and adolescent subjects with F508del/G551D. 
Potential QTc prolongation has been evaluated in Study VX15-661-010 in 116 healthy volunteers for 
therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of TEZ compared with placebo and moxifloxacin. Similarly, a 
dedicated QTc study of ivacaftor monotherapy was assessed at the time of MAA of Kalydeco. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype 
Changes in sweat chloride were assessed as a marker of the activity of CFTR. The mean change in 
sweat chloride was -9.9 mmol/l and 0.2 mmol/l for TEZ/IVA and placebo groups respectively. In study 
106 (n= 510), TEZ/IVA showed a statistically significant mean treatment difference in absolute change 
of ppFEV1 from baseline through week 24 of 4.0 percentage points (pp) compared to placebo i.e., for 
TEZ/IVA 3.4 pp and for placebo – 0.6 pp, a difference that was evident at Day 15. The improvement 
was sustained during the treatment period (3.5pp at week 24), while in the placebo group a gradual 
decrease of -1.3 pp has been observed. In patients with ppFEV1 < 40%, an increase of 3.5 pp in 
ppFEV1 was observed. In adolescent subjects in study 110, the mean treatment difference in the 
TEZ/IVA group vs. placebo for the absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through week 24 was 3.9 
pp (95% CI: 2.2, 5.5).  
For key secondary endpoints, the estimated event rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 0.64 events 
per year in the TEZ/IVA group compared to the placebo group (0.99 events per year). The rate ratio 
vs. placebo was statistically significant. TEZ/IVA treatment was also associated with a lower event rate 
per year of pulmonary exacerbations requiring IV antibiotic therapy (0.32) compared to placebo 
(0.59). The rate ratio versus placebo was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.82). 
As indicative for nutritional status, the absolute change in BMI was numerically favourable for TEZ/IVA 
when compared to placebo: an increase of 0.18 kg/m2 compared to 0.12 kg/m2, respectively although 
the treatment difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.4127).  
The mean treatment difference between the TEZ/IVA and placebo groups in pooled CFQ-R respiratory 
domain score was 5.1 points (95% CI: 3.2, 7.0; nominal P<0.0001). 
The other (non-key) secondary endpoints were overall supportive, although some only numerically. 
Assessment report

Consistent improvements in ppFEV1 favouring TEZ/IVA were observed across all pre-specified 
subgroups: age, sex, baseline lung function, region, Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation 
(documented within the 2 years prior to study), and baseline use of common CF medications. The 
lowest point estimate was 3.5 pp difference in the group of patients with ppFEV1 < 40% and in 
females. No confidence interval of any subgroup crossed 0.  
Preliminary results of study 110 from the first interim analysis (IA1) mirror the results of study 106 in 
the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group as shown by a within-group mean change from study 110 baseline of 4.5 pp 
in ppFEV1 at week 24 of study 110. Similar improvements to those observed in subjects randomised to 
TEZ/IVA in the parent study 106 were observed for key secondary endpoints of efficacy in this group in 
study 110.  In the TEZ/IVA group, the mean absolute change from study 106 baseline in ppFEV1 was 
3.1 pp. In adolescents, the same trend was observed in the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group, i.e., the mean 
within-group absolute change from study 110 baseline in ppFEV1 was 5.3 percentage points (95% CI: 
3.9, 6.8) while the mean absolute change in BMI z-score was 0.10 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.19). 
In study 104 in 94 patients, the LS mean absolute change from baseline through Week 16 in ppFEV1 
was in the ivacaftor group 1.54 pp and in the placebo group -0.18 pp (P = 0.1509). In the open label 
extension phase, the improvement in FEV1 in the parent part was not sustained through Week 64. The 
difference in decrease in sweat chloride was -2.87 mmol/L between the ivacaftor group and the 
placebo group (P = 0.0384). 
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second 
allele with residual function 
In study 108, TEZ/IVA (n = 162) treatment  resulted in an increase in absolute change in ppFEV1 
averaged for Week 4 and Week 8 of 6.5 pp  with a mean  difference of 6.8 pp (95% CI: 5.7, 7.8) 
compared to placebo (n =162) which was statistically significant. The mean treatment difference 
compared to IVA (n = 157) was 2.1 pp (95% CI: 1.2, 2.9) in favour of TEZ/IVA. The sensitivity 
analysis showed similar results. In patients with ppFEV1 < 40%, an increase of 4.4 pp in ppFEV1 was 
observed. In adolescents, the mean treatment difference in the TEZ/IVA group vs. placebo for the 
absolute change in ppFEV1 through the average of Week 4 and Week 8 compared to placebo was 12.0 
pp (95% CI: 9.3, 14.8). 
For the key secondary endpoint CFQ-R Respiratory Domain, the mean  treatment difference of TEZ/IVA 
compared to placebo was 11.1 points (95% CI: 8.7, 13.6) which was also statistically significant. The 
mean treatment difference versus IVA was 1.4 points (95% CI: -1.0, 3.9). The percentage of subjects 
who had an increase of at least 4 points was higher for TEZ/IVA and IVA when compared to placebo: 
65.2%, 58.3%, and 32.9%, respectively.  
For other secondary parameters, differences in absolute change in sweat chloride and BMI were higher 
in TEZ/IVA compared to placebo. The absolute change in sweat chloride was -9.5, -4.5 and 0.2 mmol/l 
for TEZ/IVA, IVA and placebo groups respectively while the respective changes for BMI were 0.34, 0.47 
and 0.18 kg/m2. Consistent improvements in ppFEV1 favouring TEZ/IVA were observed across the pre-
specified subgroups, age, sex, baseline lung function, region, use of common CF medications, and P. 
aeruginosa colonization (documented within the 2 years prior to study start).  
Preliminary results of study 110 from the first interim analysis (IA1) mirror the results of study 108 in 
the PCBO-TEZ/IVA group as shown by a within-group mean change from study 108 baseline of 4.4 pp 
(95% CI: 2.9, 6.3) in ppFEV1 at week 16 of study 110. Similar improvements to those observed in 
subjects randomised to TEZ/IVA in the parent study 108 were observed for key secondary endpoints of

efficacy in this group. In the TEZ/IVA group, the mean absolute change from study 108 baseline in 
ppFEV1 was 7.4 pp (95% CI: 5.6, 9.1).  
Results of the second interim analysis (IA2) of study 110 showed that the improvement achieved in 
ppFEV1 in the placebo group of study 108 was maintained at week 16 of study 110 in the TEZ/IVA 
group.  The mean intragroup change in ppFEV1 at the average of week 4 and week 8 of study 108 was 
6.5 pp in the TEZ/IVA group, while at week 16 of study 110 no differences were seen with respect to 
the within-change observed in study 108. For CFQ-R the mean within-change from baseline at week 16 
of study 110 was still 4.4 points (95% CI: 1.2, 7.6) in the TEZ/IVA group compared to a mean within-
group change of 10.1 points in study 108. In Study 110, subjects who continued TEZ/IVA maintained a 
low pulmonary exacerbation event rate of 0.20 at IA1 and 0.22 at IA2. The risk of PEx that led to 
hospitalization or IV antibiotic treatment was 12.9%, while in the CFF Registry the annual risk of PEx in 
need of hospitalisation or IV therapy ranged from 27.0% to 31.6% from 2012 to 2014.  
In adolescents, the mean absolute change from baseline at study 110 week-16 in ppFEV1 was 7.2 pp 
(95% CI: 4.8, 9.7) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group, 1.6 pp (−1.5, 4.8) in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group and 0.7 
(−2.2, 3.6) in the TEZ/IVA group as compared to adults, i.e., 4.4 pp (3.1, 5.7), 2.5 pp (1.1, 3.8), and 
0.0 pp (−1.3, 1.3) respectively. Overall, better results are observed in adolescents. Regarding BMI z-
score, the mean absolute change from baseline at study 110 week-16 were 0.04 (95% CI: −0.07, 
0.14) in the PBO-TEZ/IVA group, −0.13 (−0.26, 0.01) in the IVA-TEZ/IVA group, and 0.16 (0.04, 
0.28) in the TEZ/IVA group. The mean absolute change in BMI (kg/m2) for the overall population was 
0.35 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.56), 0.15 kg/m2 (−0.07, 0.38), and 0.54 kg/m2 (0.32, 0.76) 
respectively. 
In Study 101, patients with F/G551D mutations taking TEZ on top of physician prescribed Kalydeco 
showed an improvement in ppFEV1 of 3.20 percentage points compared to Kalydeco alone, 
demonstrating a treatment benefit in a gating mutation. 
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second 
mutation that is not likely to respond to TEZ and/or IVA therapy (F508del/NR) 
In study 107 in patients with F508del/NR mutation, the difference in absolute change in ppFEV1 
between TEZ/IVA and placebo group was 1.2 pp (95% CI: -0.3, 2.6; P = 0.1176). The 1-sided 80% 
UCB was below the predefined futility boundary of 2.5 pp.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Dose regimen and drug-drug interactions 
When testing multiple combinations of tezacaftor and ivacaftor (study 101) in patients homozygous for 
the F508del-CFTR mutation, the regimen TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h was favourable in ppFEV1 
compared to other dose combinations as well as compared to the almost all TEZ monotherapy groups. 
However, the greatest reduction in absolute change in sweat chloride has been observed in some 
monotherapy groups of tezacaftor (ranging from +3.92 to ‒20.43 mmol/l). A clear dose response could 
not be observed for ppFEV1. The treatment effect of the combination therapy compared to placebo 
ranged from 1.44 to 3.89 pp, and for the monotherapy from 1.74 to 3.63 pp, with the greatest 
treatment effect at the lowest TEZ dose of 10 mg once daily.  The model, within the limitations, 
appears to be more accurate for ppFEV1 than for sweat chloride but cannot be considered conclusive.  
In F/RF patients, the combination regimen for study 108 was supported by in vitro data only.  
Both TEZ and IVA are substrate for CYP3A4, an enzyme for which potentially important genetic 
variation has been reported (i.e. CYP3A4*22) that may lead to TEZ and IVA exposures comparable to 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 130/144 
 
 
 
 
 
those obtained when given in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. For this reason, either 
additional information on the genetic profile of patients included in the studies with respect to this 
enzyme, or additional in vivo data in healthy subjects should be provided. In both situations, further 
analysis of the potential relationship between TEZ and IVA exposure (AUC, Cmax and Ctrough) and 
genotype in subjects with CYP3A4*22 genotype and subjects with CYP3A4 wild-type phenotype should 
be provided. Based on the outcome of this analysis, potential consequences of such pharmacogenetic 
variations related to CYP3A4 for exposure and/or dose advice should be further discussed. Additional 
information will be provided post-approval on the substrate, inhibiting and inducing characteristics of 
TEZ and metabolites, as well as IVA and its metabolites, and towards a number of enzymes and 
transporters, in order to be able to predict potential consequences for drug-drug interactions.  
All patients  
Overall, the characterisation of the study population with respect to some relevant factors is not as 
accurate as it would have been desirable. This mainly applies to the status of chronic lung colonisation 
due to P. aeruginosa which was not known at the time of study entry. While for subjects enrolled in 
study 108 it is expected that this percentage is relatively low, this is not the case for patients 
homozygous for F508del. In study 108, discrepancies have been found between the number of 
subjects declared as having exocrine pancreatic insufficiency based on faecal elastase-1 values and 
those receiving exogenous pancreatic enzymes.  
Only 6 patients ≥ 65 years of age were included in the phase III program, all were in study 108.  
Only interim data from study 110 are available for a total treatment duration of up to 48 weeks for 
patients with F/F genotype and up to 24 weeks for patients with F/RF genotype, although the study is 
planned to provide up to a follow-up duration of 120 and 104 weeks respectively. A second interim 
analysis was requested by CHMP where baseline was defined as study 110 baseline for all “treatment” 
groups of study 110. Some uncertainties remain regarding the datasets used for the various analyses 
that have been provided as part of IA2. Study 110, however, was not designed or powered to assess 
the difference of TEZ/IVA effects for subjects transitioning from the various treatments in Study 106 or 
108 to TEZ/IVA in Study 110, i.e., it is a descriptive in nature. All P values provided for within-group 
changes of the MMRM analyses performed are nominal. Furthermore, this study is expected to provide 
data beyond 24 weeks or 16 weeks of treatment with TEZ/IVA for homozygous F508del subjects and 
for heterozygous F508del/pre-specified residual function mutations, respectively.  
CF patients 12 years or older homozygous for F508del (Study 106) 
The reduction in sweat chloride is only modest, given that homozygous F508del/F508del patients have 
baseline sweat chloride in the region of 100 mmol/L. Based on natural history data, mutations with 
residual CFTR activity with sweat chloride levels of approximately 10% lower than severe mutations, 
such as homozygous F508del/F508del patients, have less severe disease manifestations or 
demonstrate a delay in onset. The reduction is therefore acceptably relevant.  
The secondary endpoint hierarchy was broken by the results of BMI, the fourth endpoint in the testing 
hierarchy (after the absolute and the relative change in ppFEV1 and the rate of pulmonary 
exacerbations) for which the difference between treatments groups was not statistically significant, 
i.e., the mean treatment difference between groups was 0.06 kg/m2 (95% CI: -0.08, 0.19; P = 
0.4127). The percentage of undernourished subjects was considerably higher in the adolescent group 
than in the adult group (69.8% vs. 17.5% respectively). No clinically meaningful changes in BMI z-
score were observed either. The mean between-group treatment difference was -0.04 (95% CI: -0.15, 
0.07).    
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 131/144 
 
 
 
 
 
The last endpoint in the testing hierarchy, the respiratory domain of CFQ-R cannot be claimed as 
statistically significant.  
In the second interim analysis (IA2) of the open label extension study 110, using study 110 as 
baseline, a loss of 0.2 pp in ppFEV1 was observed in the TEZ/IVA group during the additional 24 weeks 
of treatment. In adolescent subjects, the loss was slightly higher, i.e., -0.8 pp. This appears acceptable 
as it is lower than the annualized loss in this group of patients with F/F mutation i.e., −1.91 
percentage points overall and -2.37 pp in the 13-17 year group (Sawicki 2017).  
The event rate of pulmonary exacerbations requiring IV antibiotic therapy was 0.35 in the TEZ/IVA 
group after 24 weeks of additional treatment in Study 110 (IA2) as compared to 0.29 at week 24 of 
study 106. In F/F subjects who began receiving TEZ/IVA in either Study 106 (parent study) or Study 
110, the average duration of follow-up was 1.67 years per subject and the risk of PEx that led to 
hospitalization or IV antibiotic treatment was 29.6%, while in the CFF Registry, the annual risk of PEx 
ranged from 47.6% to 49.5% from 2012 to 2014. This is not unexpected given that the percentage of 
subjects with pulmonary exacerbations requiring intravenous therapy was less than 25% in each group 
at week 24 of study 106. 
In study 110 week 24, subjects in the TEZ/IVA maintained the limited improvement in BMI seen at 
week 24 of study 106 as no differences were seen with respect to the within-change observed in study 
106. The mean within-group change in BMI from baseline at study 110 week-24 in BMI z-score for 
adolescent subjects was -0.04 (-0.13, 0.06) in the TEZ/IVA group.  
The initial improvement in CFQ-R was partly maintained (0.4 points). In the responder analysis 51.3% 
patients treated with TEZ/IVA were responders after 24 weeks (study 106) and 48.6% after 48 weeks 
(study 110) compared with placebo 35.7%.  
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second allele with 
residual function (study 108) 
For study 108, mutations were eligible based on in vitro evidence of responsiveness to ivacaftor 
defined by a 10% increase in chloride transport AND on the availability of population-level phenotypic 
data compatible with residual CFTR activity.  
The Fischer Rat thyroid (FRT) cell lines expressing mutations of residual function, and possibly 
predicting a clinical response, was claimed by the MAH as a validated assay. However, there is no 
clinical validation that the threshold of at least 10% increase in in vitro chloride transport is sufficient 
to predict clinical efficacy. The scatterplots provided were not conclusive to show a relationship for the 
extent of in vitro responsiveness and in vivo.  
For most of the mutations, the number of patients was small limiting the interpretation of the results.  
For the following mutations, it is considered that sufficient clinical evidence is present: 2789+5G->A, 
3272-26A->G, 3849+10kbC->T, A455E, D1152H, P67L, and S945L. Because of the very limited data, 
711+3A→G, D579G, L206W, R1070W, R117C, R352Q, and S977F CFTR mutants do not fulfil strictly 
the requirement of robust clinical data and the modelling did not add new insights to overcome this 
issue. However, mutations 711+3A→G, R1070W, R117C, R352Q, and S977F fulfil the criteria for 
passing the different thresholds of responder analysis ppFEV1 > 2% or ppFEV1 ≥ 0%, mean and 
median of the subanalysis, and are also considered acceptably established. For mutations D579G and 
L206W, although patient numbers are very low, 50% of the patients have a clinically relevant 
response. Given the rarity of these mutations and the difficulty of obtaining what would ordinarily be 
deemed robust clinical data, the sparse but promising data are considered sufficient. Regardless of the 
method for threshold or calculation, mutation D110H does not meet any criteria. The R347H-CFTR 
Assessment report

mutation (which was eligible for study 108) was never proposed to be part of the indication based on 
an in vitro increase in chloride transport below the pre-defined threshold of 10%.   
For the primary analysis of the absolute change in ppFEV1, the multiple testing procedure for study 
108 is not proven to protect type I error, but due to the strong statistical significance, many 
conceivable multiplicity procedures would produce similar results. Therefore, this is not considered 
critical and it is not further pursued. Head-to-head comparisons of TEZ/IVA vs. IVA were removed from 
the testing hierarchy in study 108 and therefore treatment differences between these two groups 
cannot be considered statistically significant in a formal sense.  
The analysis of the event rate of pulmonary exacerbations in study 108 was annualised. However, the 
exacerbation rate even if annualised, is not a reliable parameter measured over such a short time 
period, i.e., 8 weeks in study 108 and 16 weeks in study 110. 
The results of a second interim analysis of study 110 showed trends in maintenance of effect in 
ppFEV1, CFQ-R respiratory domain and BMI. However, the conclusion is based on interim results of 
study 110. The improvement in ppFEV1 of 3.20 percentage points compared to Kalydeco alone in 
patients with F/G551D mutations has been observed in a short period of only 28 days and could not be 
confirmed in the pivotal study 109. 
Adolescents 
The number of adolescent subjects was 116 in study 106 while it was 34 in study 108. The small 
number of adolescent subjects in study 108 calls for a word of caution when interpreting the results in 
this age group. Adolescent data were not specifically discussed in the first interim analysis of study 110 
in spite of the fact that subjects in this age subset are at higher risk of lung function decline. Similarly, 
a decline in nutritional status is usually seen in adolescents that can be attributed to various factors. In 
study 106, the percentage of under-nourished subjects was higher in the adolescent group than in 
adult group. No meaningful changes in BMI-for-age z-score were seen in adolescent subjects in the 
TEZ/IVA group in study 106.  
As a consequence, subgroup analyses of change of ppFEV1 and BMI z-score were requested as part of 
the interim analysis 2 of study 110.  These suggest that young subjects homozygous for F508del are at 
higher risk of lung status decline as a loss of 0.8 pp in ppFEV1 is seen at week 24 of study 110 in the 
TEZ/IVA group compared to -0.3 in the adult population.    
All populations 
A withdrawal effect has been observed 1 to 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation of dosing. 
However, as preservation of lung function by a CTFR modifier will need much longer time than 1 
month, this loss of effect is not considered indicative for long term effects.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Treatment-emergent AEs were reported for nearly all patients in both arms of the Phase III placebo 
controlled safety data set PC-SS (82.3% of patients in the TEZ/IVA arm vs. 86.9% in the placebo 
arm).TEAEs with an incidence of at least 5% in either treatment group, that were numerically higher in 
the TEZ/IVA group than in the placebo group, were headache (13.7% versus 11.3%), nasopharyngitis 
(11.5% versus 9.7%), and nausea (7.7% versus 6.7%). Related AEs occurred in 23.6% of patients 
treated with TEZ/IVA and in 22.2% treated with placebo. Grade 3-4 AEs were reported for 7.1% 
(TEZ/IVA) vs. 8.5% (placebo) of patients. Infective PEx (3.6% vs. 3.8%) of CF and haemoptysis (0.8% 
vs. 1.0%) were the only Grade 3 or 4 AEs that had an incidence of at least 1% in either treatment 
group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 133/144 
 
 
 
 
 
SAEs were reported for 10.1% (TEZ/IVA) vs. 14.9% (placebo). The SAEs that occurred in ≥1% of 
patients in either treatment group were infective PEx of CF (6.7% vs. 10.3%) and haemoptysis (1.0% 
vs. 1.2%). Related SAEs occurred in 1.0% (TEZ/IVA) vs. 1.4% (placebo). Related SAEs that occurred 
in 2 or more patients in either treatment group were haemoptysis (0.4% vs. 0%) and infective PEx of 
CF (0.2% vs. 0.6%). 
The long-term safety data sets OLE-SS and LT-SS showed increased frequencies of (related AEs), 
Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation with TEZ/IVA compared to the 
pooled Phase III PC-SS. Of note: the placebo-TEZ/IVA arm in the OLE-SS showed a similar pattern and 
the mean exposure in the long-term safety data sets was increased 2-4 fold compared to the PC-SS. 
Discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 1.6% (TEZ/IVA) vs. 2% (placebo). Of the events occurring in 
at least 2 patients, the AE leading to treatment discontinuation that had a higher incidence in the 
TEZ/IVA group (0.4%; 2 patients) than the placebo group (0 patients) was abdominal pain. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety data package, while in principle adequate to inform long term administration, is still lacking 
in sufficient patient-years of exposure to inform long latency or rare adverse effects. This information 
will become available during post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Thirteen subjects older than 65 years 
have been enrolled in the clinical program, with 6 of them enrolled in study 108. Of these 6 patients, 4 
received TEZ/IVA. Due to the small number of patients in this age group, no final conclusions 
regarding safety can be drawn. However, no apparent new safety signals were observed in these 
subjects. Out of the 5 pregnancies reported in phase 3 trials, the outcome is known for 3 of them. 
Three healthy children were born. For the remaining two, the outcome is not known due to lost to 
follow-up and to lack of agreement to sign pregnancy informed consent form. There is still limited 
experience in pregnant women, as stated in the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The FEV1 as a surrogate endpoint is a well-established endpoint and slowing the rate of decline of 
FEV1 is related to improved survival. Pulmonary exacerbations and decline of lung function have an 
impact on survival in cystic fibrosis and reduce health-related quality of life. Preservation of lung 
function alongside reductions of the rate of pulmonary exacerbations are the main goals of treatment 
of cystic fibrosis. Body weight is related to lung function and improving this extra-pulmonary endpoint 
is also a clinical relevant objective of the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The dose regimen for adolescents 
has been established in the clinical studies and supported by population PK model. Adolescents are at a 
higher risk of lung function decline. Similarly, a decline in nutritional status is usually seen in this age 
subset that can be attributed to various factors.  
CF patients 12 years or older homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation 
Importance of the favourable effects 
The observed difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo of 4.0 pp in absolute change of ppFEV1 is 
above the predefined threshold (2.5 pp) and also above the definition of clinical relevance in the

context of the natural decline in CF patients (Report of the workshop on endpoints for cystic fibrosis 
clinical trials (EMA/769571/2012)) in the pivotal study 106. The interim results in study 110 in the 
patients on previous placebo treatment in study 106 mirror the results of week 24 study 106, showing 
the consistency of the results. The maintenance of effect is shown by the results of the patients who 
received active treatment for 48 weeks, still being above 3pp. A rate reduction of 0.35 was seen in 
pulmonary exacerbations. For pulmonary exacerbations that require IV antibiotic therapy the rate 
reduction was 0.25. These are positive findings given the impact these events have in the quality of life 
and disease progression.  
Strength of the evidence 
The primary analysis provided evidence for the efficacy of TEZ/IVA in absolute change in ppFEV1 (p 
<0.0001, 95% CI 3.1, 4.8). The sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. 
Furthermore, consistent improvements in ppFEV1 favouring TEZ/IVA were observed across all pre-
specified subgroups with the lowest point estimate still clinically relevant. The results of the primary 
parameter are supported by some of the secondary endpoints, namely the rate reduction in pulmonary 
exacerbations (95% CI: 0.48, 0.88; P = 0.0054). Changes in BMI although not statistically significant, 
favour TEZ/IVA numerically. A responder analysis of under-nourished patients based on the 
achievement of a target BMI revealed more responders in the TEZ/IVA compared with placebo group 
(i.e., 32.4% vs. 26.8% respectively at week 24 of study 106) which is particularly relevant for 
adolescent subjects as most undernourished subjects were in this age group. Also, numerically, the 
change in the respiratory domain score of CFQ-R favours TEZ/IVA (p-value N/A).  
The data of the extension study 110 confirmed the results as similar results were demonstrated in the 
previously placebo treated patients; the patients who continued treatment with TEZ/IVA kept overall 
more or less the changes experienced during the parent study. It has been confirmed that ivacaftor 
alone is not efficacious in CF patients with F/F mutation (study 104). 
Impact of the uncertainties 
The proposed dose regimen is questioned especially from the perspective that tezacaftor as 
monotherapy has not been investigated in the phase 3 program. The in vitro discrepancies, study 101 
data and the exposure-response analyses fail to substantiate a need for ivacaftor to treat homozygous 
F508del patients.  
The secondary endpoint hierarchy was broken at the level of BMI. For this important extra-pulmonary 
parameter no clinically meaningful within-group changes in the mean BMI were observed in the 
TEZ/IVA or placebo groups (95% CI: -0.08, 0.19; P = 0.4127). This also applies to the adolescent 
group in which no meaningful differences in BMI z-scores between treatment groups were seen either.  
The respiratory domain of the CFQ-R was the last key secondary endpoint in the testing hierarchy and 
therefore, although the change favours TEZ/IVA group, the result cannot be formally declared as 
statistically significant. 
For pulmonary exacerbations that require intravenous therapy, less than 25% of patients in each 
group had such an event during the parent study period which is below the annual risk reported in the 
CFF Patient Registry (around 45%, unpublished data). In particular, in the placebo group the 
percentage of subjects with pulmonary exacerbations that require intravenous therapy was 21.1% 
(n=54). This may partially reflect the fact that study duration is still too short to properly assess 
pulmonary exacerbations. 
Based on the second interim analysis of the open label extension study, the data suggest the 
maintenance of the effect seen as observed in the parent study although additional improvement is not

usually observed over that achieved in the parent study. This conclusion is based on interim results of 
study 110. Further data from this study are expected beyond 24 weeks of treatment with TEZ/IVA. An 
accurate and precise interpretation of the data would require a control group as the disease progresses 
over time.  
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second 
allele with residual function 
Importance of the favourable effects 
The obtained difference of TEZ/IVA in absolute change of ppFEV1 of 6.8 pp is above the predefined 
threshold (3.0 pp) and also above accepted clinical relevance in both the parent study 108 as in the 
extension study 110 establishing the benefit of TEZ/IVA over 24 weeks in total. 
The improvement in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain of 11.1 points is substantially above the MCID of 4 
points. The majority of the patients treated with TEZ/IVA achieved an improvement of 4 points. During 
the extension phase of 16 weeks, the improvement was maintained. 
Strength of the evidence 
The primary analysis provided evidence for the efficacy of TEZ/IVA in ppFEV1 (95% CI 5.7, 7.8; p 
<0.0001). The sensitivity analysis confirmed the primary analysis. In addition, the improvements in 
ppFEV1 favouring TEZ/IVA were consistent across the prespecified subgroups. The improvement of 
ppFEV1 in the extension study at Day 15 for patients on previous placebo treatment is similar as in the 
parent study. All these results confirm the robustness and consistency of the primary analysis.  
The (key) secondary endpoints support the results found in the primary endpoint.  
The data of the extension study 110 confirmed the results as similar results were demonstrated in the 
previously placebo treated patients; the patients who continued treatment with TEZ/IVA kept more or 
less the improvements already experienced during the parent study.   
The results of Study 107 confirmed that TEZ/IVA is not efficacious in patients who have the F508del- 
/MF mutation, indicating that the aimed population is CF patients with F/RF mutation.  
The results of Study 109 showed that TEZ/IVA is as efficacious in patients who have the F508del- 
/gating mutation as ivacaftor alone. These patients are not aimed anymore for the indication of 
TEZ/IVA. 
Impact of the uncertainties 
In patients with F/RF mutations, the combination regimen for study 108 was informed by in vitro data 
alone. While the in vitro data suggest that TEZ on its own has substantial chloride transport enhancing 
activity that is separable from a corrector function, the Phase III study 108 data indicate a modest  
incremental clinical benefit for the TEZ/IVA combination versus IVA alone. This suggests that TEZ is 
making a relatively modest contribution to the clinical effect with the TEZ/IVA combination in the F/RF 
patients.  
For the primary analysis, the multiple testing procedure hampered the protection of type I error, but 
due to the strong statistical significance, many conceivable multiplicity procedures would produce 
similar results. Therefore, this is not considered critical. 
Data are only available up to 24 weeks. Especially the placebo controlled phase is short (8 weeks). This 
short treatment duration hampers a proper assessment of the rate of pulmonary exacerbations and 
body weight. However, the 16 weeks extension data provided show that the previous placebo treated 
group when switched to active treatment experienced a similar effect as the initial TEZ/IVA group. The

patients who continued treatment with TEZ/IVA kept overall the changes experienced during the 
parent study. This conclusion is based on interim results of study 110. Further data from this study are 
expected beyond 16 weeks of treatment with TEZ/IVA. An accurate and precise interpretation of the 
data would require a control group as the disease progresses over time. 
Although TEZ/IVA showed clinically relevant differences over placebo, the benefit over ivacaftor 
monotherapy is small and sometimes even not reaching clinical relevance. For ppFEV1 the treatment 
difference was 2.1 pp, but this is still considered relevant in relation to an overall estimated annualized 
ppFEV1 rate of decline of –1.05 percentage points in F/RF patients (excluding subjects with an R117H-
CFTR mutation). Although for pulmonary exacerbations the reduction of event rate was higher with 
monotherapy IVA, the event rate is not reliable because of the short-time period of treatment (8 
weeks).  
For the secondary endpoint respiratory domain of CFQ-R the responder analysis showed a distinctive 
difference (65.2% versus 58.3%). Altogether, there is a clinical benefit over ivacaftor in this population 
of patients with F/RF mutations. The rationale for the need for TEZ in a TEZ/IVA combination can be 
considered somewhat more persuasive for patients with missense mutations. 
Although, study 108 met its primary endpoint overall, for some of the individual mutations, the 
number of patients is small. This limits the interpretation of the results per mutation.  
No significant new or additional safety concerns were identified with the addition of tezacaftor to 
ivacaftor. The safety profile of the combination appeared similar across studies. There were no latent, 
late onset safety issues or risks identified in the long term safety sets analysed. Tezacaftor and 
ivacaftor in combination were overall well tolerated with low discontinuation rates due to adverse 
events.   
3.7.2.  Benefit-risk balance 
CF patients 12 years or older homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation 
The primary analysis in the placebo-controlled study 106 provided evidence for the efficacy of TEZ/IVA 
and is demonstrated that TEZ/IVA provides clinical benefit to CF patients with F/F mutation particularly 
in what refers to pulmonary function as shown by the treatment difference in the absolute change in 
ppFEV1 and the reduction in pulmonary exacerbations. A modest effect is seen in the group of 
TEZ/IVA-treated patients as well as in under-nourished patients in terms of BMI improvement. The 
statistical approach is overall sound. The interim results of study 110 of all the important parameters 
are indicative of the maintenance of the effect in 70% of the available patients. Further data from this 
study are expected beyond 24 weeks of treatment with TEZ/IVA. 
In study 101, the data and the exposure-response analyses do not provide full reassurance of a need 
for IVA to treat homozygous F508del patients. Although there is consistency of response in FEV1 
between phase II and phase III studies, suggesting superiority of the combination, this is in contrast to 
the sweat chloride results, and there remain uncertainties and inconsistencies.  
These data cannot be disregarded as clinically irrelevant when the scientific literature points to the 
interdependence of chloride channel gating and CFTR protein localization on protein folding, which 
blurs the distinction between corrector and potentiator action. From in vitro results, the mechanistic 
argumentation has been strengthened but is not sufficiently convincing because of discrepancy 
between the patch clamp data and the Ussing chamber chloride conductance data and between patch 
clamp data and the in vivo data in study 101. However, this ongoing uncertainty is set against i) the 
level of unmet need in F508del homozygous patients who cannot tolerate LUM/IVA or where LUM/IVA 
Assessment report  
EMA/636932/2018  
Page 139/144 
 
 
 
 
 
is inadvisable; and ii) the clear demonstration of superiority for TEZ/IVA over placebo in homozygous 
F508del patients resulting in relevant improvements in this population. However, this should not be 
interpreted as an endorsement of lack of need for future clinical investigation into this important and 
as yet unresolved issue for these patients. 
Data from other studies confirmed that monotherapy with ivacaftor alone is not efficacious in CF 
patients homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation.  
The overall safety profile of Symkevi in CF patients 12 years or older homozygous for the F508del-
CFTR mutation is considered acceptable.  
CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, and a second 
allele with residual function 
The primary analysis for ppFEV1 in the placebo and active controlled study provided evidence for the 
efficacy of TEZ/IVA in ppFEV1 as well as for other clinical endpoints compared to placebo. The primary 
analysis is sufficiently robust. The statistical approach is overall sound. However, a benefit can only be 
considered established for the mutations that are supported by clinical data. The mutations proposed 
to be included in the indication based only on in vitro responsiveness to TEZ/IVA have not been 
sufficiently justified. A relationship between the extent of in vitro responsiveness in FRT cells and 
clinical response could not be established. 
The pivotal study 108 faces the concern of the short duration while data are available in the extension 
study 110 up to 24 weeks of continuous treatment with TEZ/IVA only in subjects who received TEZ/IVA 
in the second treatment period of study 108.  The data of the first interim analysis of study 110 are 
indicative of maintenance of the effect in 70% of the available patients. Further data from this study 
are expected beyond 16 weeks of treatment with TEZ/IVA. 
Because TEZ/IVA is a new therapy with an indication that includes genotypes eligible for ivacaftor 
treatment, the comparison to ivacaftor is of importance. The clinical relevance of the differences over 
ivacaftor was small, but relevant.  
Overall, the safety profile in CF patients 12 years or older heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation 
and a second pre-specified allele with residual function is considered acceptable. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
CF patients 12 years or older homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation 
For these patients, a combination of a corrector and a potentiator has been established in principle by 
the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor (Orkambi). For Orkambi in its registration trials, the 
results of ppFEV1 were an increase in ppFEV1 from baseline of 2.16 % and 2.85% at 24 weeks (see 
EPAR Orkambi). Thus, there is a difference compared to TEZ/IVA (3.4 % from baseline) presented by 
cross trial comparison. 
The long term data are quite similar i.e. 3.25% for Orkambi compared to 3.1% for TEZ/IVA at 48 
weeks.  
TEZ/IVA offers a CFTR modulator alternative for patients who cannot tolerate Orkambi because of 
adverse events or who could not take Orkambi because of DDIs.

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee 
for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential 
information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification 
by 9 August 2018. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA 
website at 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2012/03/WC500124536.pdf. 
2. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated 
version of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion 
should be submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
3. 
If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the ‘Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU’ and the 
RMP ‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ has been updated in the procedure, the 
MAH is reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the 
‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ as a standalone document, within 14 calendar 
days of the receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free 
of metadata, headers and footers. 
4. 
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after 
the Commission Decision, or prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. For additional 
guidance see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised Technical Guidance for eCTD Submissions in the EU.

The Marketing authorisation holder applied for new indication for prevention and treatment of 
hyperuricaemia in adult patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies at 
intermediate to high risk of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS). Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in 
accordance. 
The variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0117/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0117/2014 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Adenuric  (febuxostat)  is  a  potent,  non-purine  selective  inhibitor  of  xanthine  oxidase  that  inhibits  the 
formation of uric acid from xanthine. The active ingredient in febuxostat immediate-release tablets for 
oral administration is 2-[3-cyano-4-(2-methylpropoxy)phenyl]-4-methylthiazole-5-carboxylic acid. 
Febuxostat is currently approved for the: “Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in conditions where urate 
deposition has already occurred (including a history or presence of tophus and/or gouty arthritis)”. In the 
EU the product was approved on 21st April 2008. 
The recommended oral dose of febuxostat is 80 mg once daily (QD) without regard to food. If serum uric 
acid is >6 mg/dL (357 μmol/L) after 2-4 weeks, febuxostat 120 mg QD may be considered. Febuxostat 
works sufficiently quickly to allow retesting of the serum uric acid after 2 weeks. The therapeutic target is 
to decrease and maintain serum uric acid below 6 mg/dL (357 μmol/L). Gout flare prophylaxis of at least 
6 months is recommended. 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) is the most common disease-related emergency encountered by physicians 
caring  for  patients  with  haematologic  cancers.  It  represents  a  critical  and  possibly  fatal  complication 
resulting from the rapid lysis of large numbers of tumour cells, observed most often after initial treatment 
with chemotherapy.  
The current classification system distinguishes between Laboratory TLS (LTLS) and Clinical TLS (CTLS). 
LTLS is considered to be present if at least 2 laboratory parameters (among serum values of uric acid, 
potassium, phosphate or calcium) are more than or less than normal (see Table 1) at presentation or if 
they change by at least 25% from baseline: 
Table 1. Criteria for LTLS definition 
ANALYTE 
VALUE 
CHANGE FROM 
BASELINE 
Uric Acid 
≥ 476 μmol/L (or 8 mg/dL) 
25% increase 
Potassium 
≥ 6.0 mmol/L 
25% increase 
Phosphorus 
Calcium 
≥ 1.45 mmol/L 
25% increase 
≤ 1.75 mmol/L 
25% decrease 
CTLS is present when LTLS is accompanied by at least one of the following significant clinical 
complications: increased creatinine level, seizures, cardiac dysrhythmia or death. In this condition, the 
rapid release of intracellular metabolites can alter the normal homeostatic and electrolyte balances, 
potentially leading to hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. The 
precipitation/crystallization of uric acid or calcium phosphate in renal tubules may then lead to impaired 
renal function/failure which in turn may further exacerbate the degree of electrolytes imbalances. The 
following algorithm (see figure 1) stratifies malignancies in low risk disease (LRD), intermediate risk 
disease (IRD) and high risk disease (HRD) on the basis of the different risk of developing TLS (<1%, 1-5% 
and >5%) respectively:

Figure 1. TLS risk algorithm 
Note: ATL: Adult T-cell lymphoma; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; WNL: Within Normal Limits; ULN: Upper Limit of 
Normal; WBC: White Blood Cells; LRD: Low Risk Disease; IRD: Intermediate Risk Disease; HRD: High Risk Disease. For 
chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL), IRD is defined not only when treatment targeted and/or biological therapies are 
used instead of only alkylating a gents, b ut a lso i n t he p resence o f a n e levated W BC ( ≥ 5 0 x 1 09/L) 
Though the occurrence of TLS depends not only on serum uric acid (sUA) level but also on potassium, 
phosphorus and calcium values, sUA plays a key role in the developing of TLS. In fact, urate induces acute 
kidney injury not only by intra-renal crystallization but also by crystal independent mechanism, such as 
renal vasoconstriction, impaired auto regulation, decreased renal blood flow oxidation and inflammation. 
According to Coiffier et al, the risk of developing TLS or more simply the risk of developing acute renal 
impairment is significantly increased in patients with higher levels of sUA versus those with lower levels. 
In addition, the risk of developing TLS was increased by a factor of 1.75 for every mg/dL increase in serum 
UA, (p<0.0001) while the risk for renal events was increased by a factor of 2.21 (p=0.0012) for every 
mg/dL increase in sUA. This observation underlines the importance of preventing/containing the UA 
increases during chemotherapy in this patient population. Based on published data, LTLS incidence 
ranges from 12% up to 42%, whereas the range for CTLS rate of occurrence is tighter, being from 3% to 
6%. Though no precise estimation of TLS incidence could be provided, epidemiological data highlight that 
TLS occurs both in adult and paediatric patients at a similar rate, as reported in a large analysis where 
both patient populations were included. The potential severity of TLS complications requires measures for 
TLS prevention and, in case it occurs, for its treatment. Risk oriented prophylaxis and appropriate 
interventions are the key to preventing or managing TLS and are almost identical in adult and paediatric 
populations. Strategies to prevent and treat hyperuricaemia associated with TLS encompass both general 
measures (clinical monitoring and adequate hydratation) and pharmacological measures. In accordance 
with the current recommendations for the evaluation of risk and prophylaxis of TLS as per expert panel 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 8/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consensus (Cairo M et al, 2010) general measures are always recommended regardless of TLS risk grade, 
whereas pharmacological prophylaxis with allopurinol is recommended in patients with IRD and with 
rasburicase in patients with HRD (see Table 2). 
Table 2. Recommendations for TLS prophylaxis by TLS risk grade 
Based on the above mentioned guidelines and recommendations, in patients at low risk the “watch and 
wait” approach is recommended whereas, in patients at intermediate risk, allopurinol is recommended in 
addition to hydration. Finally, in patients at high risk, rasburicase should be used along with hydration 
(Cairo M et al, 2010; Coiffier et al., 2008).  
This variation application proposed to extend the febuxostat’s indication to: “prevention and treatment of 
hyperuricaemia  in  adult  patients  undergoing  chemotherapy  for  haematologic  malignancies  at 
intermediate to high risk of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)”. ADENURIC is already approved in adults for 
the management of hyperuricaemia in conditions where urate/uric acid deposition has already occurred 
(including history, or presence of, tophus and/or gouty arthritis) at doses of 80mg and 120mg once daily. 
The dose proposed for registration in the new indication is 120 mg once daily (QD). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a non-clinical study “Preliminary Juvenile Toxicity Study in the CD Rat by a Four-Week 
Repeated Oral (Gavage) Administration (Dose Range-Finding Study)”, number “KIV0001”. 
The PDCO discussed the completed studies and considered that these are compliant with the latest 
Agency's Decision (P/0117/2014) of 6 May 2014. 
The PDCO finalised on 18 July 2014 this partially completed compliance procedure and confirmed the 
compliance of all those studies contained in the agreed paediatric investigation plan that were to be 
completed until this date. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment (ERA) submitted for the initially approved indication demonstrated 
that febuxostat is considered unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following the prescribed 
usage. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 9/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As regards the use of febuxostat in the new therapeutic indication, it is worth noting that TLS occurs in a 
very limited number of patients (well below the number of patients with gout) and the use of febuxostat 
in  TLS  is  foreseen  only  as  a  short-term  treatment,  not  being  TLS  a  chronic  disease.  Additionally,  the 
proposed posology is limited to a maximum of 120 mg once daily.  
As a whole, the new indication for the treatment of TLS is expected to increase the environmental burden 
of febuxostat to only less than 10%, therefore the potential increase of environmental exposure to the 
drug substance is deemed not significant and it is unlikely that Febuxostat could represent a risk for the 
environment. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Study “KIV0001” was conducted in accordance with the requirements of current Good Laboratory Practice 
Standards. 
The primary objective of this preliminary dose range finding study was to assess the potential toxicity of 
febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, when administered orally to juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats for 4 
weeks from Day 21 of age. The second objective was to aid in the selection of doses for a definitive study 
in juvenile rats which will assess toxicity and evaluate effects on growth and development.  
Febuxostat was administered once daily by oral gavage at doses of 0 (vehicle), 3, 12, and 48 mg/kg/day. 
Six (6) rats per sex were assigned to a group at each dose level. All doses were administered at 5 ml/kg 
in a vehicle consisting of 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose (MC) solution. A further 24 male and 24 female rats 
were assigned to each febuxostat group; these animals were treated with the same dosing procedure for 
one day or daily for four weeks and were used for toxicokinetic evaluation. 
Criteria  for  evaluation  of  potential  toxicity  included  toxicokinetics,  clinical  condition,  detailed  physical 
examinations,  body  weight,  food  consumption,  haematology  (peripheral  blood),  blood  chemistry, 
cholinesterase  analysis,  urinalysis,  organ  weight  (kidneys  and  thyroids  including  parathyroids), 
macropathology  and  histopathology  (kidneys).  Scheduled  necropsy  was  conducted  after  4  weeks  of 
dosing (6 rats/sex/group). 
The dose levels used in this study (0, 3, 12 and 48 mg/kg/day) were selected with reference to the results 
of the previous studies in adult animals. 
In order to compare the toxicity profile of adult and juvenile animals based on the results of the previous 
studies in adult animals, the high dose level for this dose-range finding study in juvenile animals was set 
at 48 mg/kg/day, and middle and low dose levels set at 12 and 3 mg/kg/day, respectively, in a common 
ratio of four (4). 
This preliminary study in juvenile rats identified the kidney as the potential target organ of toxicity. 
Effects in the kidney of rats administered 48 mg/kg/day were marked. This dose exceeds the maximum 
tolerated dose, and is considered too high for the definitive juvenile toxicity study in rats which will assess 
potential toxic effects and effects on growth and development of juvenile rats in detail.  
Febuxostat-related histopathologic changes were detected in the kidney of one male administered 3 
mg/kg/day, therefore, a lower dose should be considered for subsequent studies; however, 3 mg/kg/day 
administered to females did not elicit adverse effects. Thus, within the limitations of this preliminary 
study, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was less than 3 mg/kg/day for males and was 3 
mg/kg/day for females. However, the suggested dose levels in the above outlined conclusion of the MAH 
seem applicable for further evaluations. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 10/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The results of the preliminary study in juvenile rats suggest that dose levels for a definitive juvenile 
toxicity study be 1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day. For the scope of this specific variation application this study 
is not relevant. However, the suggested dose levels seem applicable for further evaluations. 
Considering the above data, febuxostat is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Objectives 
Primary Objective 
- 
To compare the efficacy of Febuxostat with Allopurinol, in terms of serum uric acid (sUA) level 
control and preservation of renal function after seven days of treatment (Day 8) starting from 
2 days prior to chemotherapy (Day 1). 
Secondary Objective 
- 
to compare the efficacy of Febuxostat with Allopurinol in terms of maintenance of sUA levels 
7.5 mg/dL and in terms of occurrence of laboratory TLS (LTLS) and clinical TLS (CTLS) 
according to Cairo-Bishop criteria. 
- 
to compare the safety of Febuxostat with Allopurinol. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the following co-primary endpoints: 
• Area under the curve of sUA from baseline (Day 1) to the evaluation visit (Day 8) (AUC sUA 
1-8). 
• Change in serum creatinine level from baseline (Day 1) to the Evaluation Visit (Day 8). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
• Assessment of the treatment responder rate.  
- Treatment response is defined as the maintenance of sUA <7.5 mg/dL from the start of 
chemotherapy (Day 3) to the Evaluation Visit (Day 8).  
- Treatment failure is defined as the presence of two or more consecutive values of sUA 
missing or > 7.5 mg/dL.   
• Assessment of LTLS, from start of chemotherapy (Day 3) to the Evaluation Visit (Day 8) based 
on local laboratory results.  
According to the Cairo-Bishop criteria, LTLS was defined by the presence of 2 or more laboratory 
abnormalities, including a 25% increase or levels above normal for serum uric acid, potassium, 
and phosphate or a 25% decrease or levels below normal for calcium. 
• Assessment of CTLS, from start of chemotherapy (Day 3) to the Evaluation Visit (Day 8). 
According to the Cairo-Bishop criteria, CTLS was defined by the presence of LTLS in addition to 1 
or more of the following significant clinical complications:  
- renal insufficiency,  
- cardiac arrhythmias,  
- sudden death  
- seizures. 
The grade of CTLS was defined by the maximal grade of the clinical manifestation. 
Sample size 
The expected benefit of the Febuxostat group in respect to the Allopurinol group during the treatment 
period was assumed as: 
• 
at least an absolute reduction of 100 mg x h/dL for the AUCsUA1-8 which correspond to a 15% 
decrease of Allopurinol in case it confirms the published data of AUCsUA1-8 = 646 mg x h/dL, with 
a common SD = 285 mg x h/dL; 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 14/55 
 
 
 
 
• 
no change in mean Serum Creatinine level from baseline to the end of treatment for the 
Febuxostat group while Allopurinol has an increase of 13% in the mean Serum Creatinine 
(corresponding to 0.2 mg/dL considering a baseline mean Serum Creatinine = 1.5 mg/dL with a 
SD = 0.6 mg/dL). 
According to the MAH, 340 patients (170 patients per arm) would be sufficient to achieve approximately 
80% power. Assuming aroud 10% screening failure rate, approximately 380 patients would need to be 
screened. 
Randomisation 
After re-checking the eligibility criteria on Visit 1 (Day 1), eligible patients were randomized to one of the 
2  possible  treatment  arms  (Febuxostat  or  Allopurinol)  as  per  treatment  code,  delivered  through 
IVRS/IWRS, in accordance with the randomization list. Randomization was stratified according to TLS risk 
(intermediate  or  high)  and  baseline  sUA  level  (<7.5  mg/dL  and  >7.5  mg/dL);  this  information  was 
entered by the Investigator during the IVRS/IWRS randomization procedure.  
Blinding (masking) 
The treatment allocation was double-blinded. As the size and the shape of the Allopurinol 100 mg and 
Febuxostat 120 mg tablets differ as well as the posology scheme of Allopurinol high dosage (taken twice 
a  day),  double  blind  conditions  were  secured  by  encapsulation  of  the  treatment  tablets.  Tablets  of 
Febuxostat  and  Allopurinol  were  over-encapsulated.  Likewise,  corresponding  placebo  capsules  were 
produced. Differences in weight were compensated by adequate filling material. The Investigator was to 
unblind the treatment allocation in the course of the clinical trial only if it was relevant to the safety of the 
patient, reporting the reason. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations: 
Four populations were defined for this study: 
- the Safety Population 
- the ITT Population 
- and the PP Population  
Safety  Population:  included  all  randomized  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug 
(N=346). 
Intention-to-Treat  (ITT)  population:  included  all  randomized  patients  (N=346).  The  primary  efficacy 
analysis was run on the ITT population which included 346 patients, 173 allocated to Febuxostat and 173 
to Allopurinol.  
Per  Protocol  (PP)  population:  included  all  patients  of  the  ITT  population  excluding  patients  who 
experienced major protocol violation(s) (N=309). The PP population was used to perform confirmatory 
analysis on the primary efficacy evaluation. 
A total of 346 patients (214 males and 132 females) were randomized and all of them received the study 
treatment, thus constituting both the ITT and the safety and populations. 
All statistical tests were generally two-sided with a significance level of a=0.05, unless otherwise specified. 
The primary efficacy analysis includes stratification variables as covariates;  
The 2 co-primary endpoints were analysed through analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in order to test the 
difference  in  treatment  efficacy  quantified  by  AUC  sUA1-8  and  change  (%)  in  serum  creatinine  level 
between treatment arms.

Participant flow 
Recruitment 
The study was initiated (first subject enrolled) on October the 1st 2012 and was completed on October the 
11th 2013. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was dated February 29th, 2012. There were three amendments, only one of which 
was substantial and concerned changes to improve patient comfort, a clarification regarding ischemic 
heart disease and congestive heart failure in the exclusion criteria section and an update of the SmPC. 
Baseline data 
This study included 346 (214 males and 132 females) adult (20-87 years, mean age 58.4 years) patients 
with haematological malignancies (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), lymphoma and acute leukaemia 
(AL)). 
Regarding ethnicity, 331 (95.6%) patients were Caucasian, 1 (0.3%) was Black and 14 (4.1%) were of 
other ethnicity. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 16/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The large majority of patients were Caucasian (over 95%), with a mean age of 58.4 years, ranging from 
20 to 87 years. There was a higher proportion (around 62%) of male subjects and some other minor 
imbalances (e.g. slightly higher percentage of patients affected by acute leukaemia and lymphoma in the 
Febuxostat arm, higher percentage of patients affected by chronic lymphoid leukaemia in the Allopurinol 
group, differences in medical history and concomitant medication prior to first drug intake etc.) which all 
in all did not have any noteworthy impact on the outcome of the study with its (co-)primary endpoint 
sUA-decrease and unaffected kidney function (latter measured by serum creatinine levels).

Outcomes and estimation 
o  Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The 2 co-primary endpoints were analysed through analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in order to test the 
difference in treatment efficacy quantified by AUC sUA1-8 and change (%) in serum creatinine level from 
baseline  (Day  1)  to  the  Evaluation  Visit  (Day  8)  between  treatment  arms.  The  two  ANCOVA  models 
included the treatment as a major covariate, adjusted for the two stratification factors (i.e.: TLS risk and 
sUA levels). 
One  patient  allocated  to  Febuxostat  and  one  patient  allocated  to  Allopurinol  treatment  group  were 
excluded from “sUA AUC1-8”- analysis due to missing data at baseline. Thus, sUA AUC1-8 was calculated 
on 172 patients in each treatment group. 
Mean (SD) sUA at baseline (Day 1) showed no significant differences between Febuxostat and Allopurinol 
arms (5.6 ± 1.82 and 5.8 ± 1.77 mg/dL respectively, p=0.3008). Mean (SD) sUA at Evaluation Visit (Day 
8) was significantly lower in Febuxostat compared to Allopurinol arm (2.7 ±1.76 and 3.9 ± 1.51 mg/dL 
respectively, p <.0001). 
Area under the curve of sUA (AUC sUA 1-8) 
Mean (SD) sUA AUC1-8 was significantly lower in Febuxostat in comparison with Allopurinol arm (514.0 
± 225.71 vs 708.0 ± 234.42 mg x h/dL respectively with p <.0001). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 18/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The time course of mean sUA from baseline to the Evaluation Visit (Day 8) is shown in Figure 2.  
Figure 2: Time course of mean sUA from baseline to the Evaluation Visit (Day 8)- ITT poulation. 
From Day 2 to the Evaluation Visit (Day 8) mean sUA level was significantly lower in Febuxostat in 
comparison with Allopurinol arm at each time point (details also in Table 14.2.3 of the study report). 
The mean difference between the two treatment arms was of 1 mg/dL or above at each of the above 
mentioned time points. 
Change (%) in Serum creatinine levels from baseline (Day 1) to the Evaluation Visit (Day 8) 
Two patients allocated to Allopurinol treatment group were excluded from this analysis due to missing 
data at baseline. Thus, change (%) in serum creatinine level was calculated on 173 and 171 patients in 
Febuxostat and Allopurinol treatment group respectively. 
Febuxostat was to be considered active in controlling renal function if no positive change in the mean 
serum  creatinine  level  (final  vs.  baseline)  had  occurred  or  if  any  positive  change  in  the  mean  serum 
creatinine level (final vs. baseline) had been significantly lower than that in the allopurinol arm (Figure 3).

Figure 3: Time course of serum creatinine level and of mean absolute change in serum creatinine level. 
Mean (SD) serum creatinine level at baseline (Day 1) showed no significant differences between 
treatment groups (0.94 ± 0.347 and 0.94 ± 0.266 mg/dL in Febuxostat and Allopurinol arm respectively, 
p=0.5689) as well as at the Evaluation Visit (Day 8) (0.91 ± 0.359 and 0.88 ± 0.273 mg/dL in Febuxostat 
and Allopurinol arm respectively, p=0.8881). 
Mean (SD) change (%) in serum creatinine level from baseline (Day 1) to the Evaluation Visit (Day 8) 
showed no significant differences between Febuxostat and Allopurinol treatment group (-0.83 ±26.977 
and -4.92 ± 16.695 % respectively, with p=0.0903 obtained through ANCOVA model). 
No significant difference between treatment groups was found in terms of change (%) of serum creatinine 
level at any time point. 
The time course of both mean serum creatinine level and of mean change in serum creatinine level was 
also  analysed  to  provide  a  quantitative  scenario  of  the  change  in  renal  function  during  the  treatment 
period. As shown in Figure 3, neither mean serum creatinine level nor mean change in serum creatinine 
level showed any significant difference between treatment groups at any time point. 
Sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of primary efficacy analysis  when it was performed without 
imputation  of  missing  data  (ITT  population)  and  when  it  was  performed  on  the  per  protocol  (PP) 
population. Moreover, results of primary analysis with the additional covariate “country” in the ANCOVA 
model confirmed the results obtained in the main primary efficacy analysis showing no significant impact 
for  country  effect  (p=0.4107),  whereas  it  showed  a  highly  significant  treatment  effect  in  favour  of 
febuxostat (p<.0001). 
Sensitivity analysis 
As sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy evaluation the following approaches were used: 
• The primary analysis without any substitution for missing values (ITT population) 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 20/55 
 
 
 
 
 
• The primary analysis applied to the PP population 
• The primary analysis with ‘Country’ as additional covariate in the ANCOVA model (ITT population) 
o  Secondary efficacy analysis 
The secondary efficacy analysis involved the sUA response rate and the assessment for LTLS and CTLS. 
All secondary efficacy analyses were performed only in the ITT population and not repeated in the PP 
population due to the low number of cases. 
sUA response rate 
No  significant  difference  was  detected  between  treatment  groups  in  terms  of  sUA  response  rate 
(p=0.1993). Treatment failure rate was low (2.9%) in the overall ITT population, and even lower in the 
Febuxostat treatment group in comparison to the Allopurinol treatment group (1.7 vs 4.0% respectively). 
Descriptive statistics are provided in Table 4. 
Table 4: Descriptive statistics for sUA Response Rate – ITT population 
Note: “treatment failure sUA”  was defined as the presence of two or more consecutive values of sUA 
missing or >7.5 mg/dL. 
LTLS assessment  
No significant difference was detected between treatment groups in terms of LTLS incidence (p=0.8488). 
LTLS  incidence  was  8.1%  and  9.2%  in  Febuxostat  and  Allopurinol  treatment  group  respectively. 
Descriptive statistics are provided in Table 5. 
Table 5: Descriptive statistics for LTLS assessment – ITT population 
CTLS assessment 
No significant difference was detected between treatment groups in terms of CTLS incidence (p=1.0000). 
CTLS  incidence  was  1.7%  and  1.2%  in  Febuxostat  and  Allopurinol  treatment  group  respectively.

(baseline hyperuricaemia sUA level ≤7.5 mg/dL vs. >7.5 mg/dL, creatinine level ≤ ULN vs. > ULN, type 
of haematological malignancy - AL vs. CLL+Lymphoma, ECOG PS score ≤2 vs. = 3 and TLS risk grade 
Intermediate vs. High) showed that the efficacy profile of febuxostat is maintained in terms of reduction 
of sUA (well established surrogate endpoint for TLS) and preserving renal function, in patients undergoing 
chemotherapy for haematological malignancies at intermediate to high risk of TLS.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This was a pivotal phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicentre study to demonstrate the efficacy of 
febuxostat 120 mg QD in the prevention and treatment of hyperuricaemia in adult patients undergoing 
chemotherapy  for  haematologic  malignancies  at  intermediate  to  high  risk  of  Tumor  Lysis  Syndrome 
(TLS). Febuxostat was to be compared with Allopurinol in terms of sUA level reduction and preserving 
renal function in the intended target population.  
The study design was considered acceptable by CHMP and in accordance with the EMA scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/2153/1/2011/II).  Based  on  guidelines  and  recommendations  of  the  international  TLS 
consensus  expert  panel,  allopurinol  represents  the  current  standard  treatment  for  patients  at 
intermediate  risk  for  TLS,  in  addition  to  hydration.  In  patients  at  high  risk,  rasburicase  is  the 
recommended option (Cairo M et al, 2010; Coiffier et al., 2008).  
The choice of the febuxostat dosage equal to 120 mg daily was based on the observation that this dose 
(which matches the higher dose approved in gout) was safely administered in clinical trials in more than 
1000 subjects (healthy volunteers and gout patients) for a mean duration of treatment of approximately 
400 days displaying a safety profile similar to the 80 mg dose but with a higher efficacy in terms of sUA 
reduction. In this respect, it should be noticed that following the administration of multiple febuxostat 80 
or 120 mg QD oral doses to healthy subjects, the mean serum urate values were reduced from baseline 
by an average of 55% and 66% respectively with steady state urate concentrations achieved within the 
first week of dosing. In addition, no dose adjustment was required for mild to moderate renal impairment. 
Therefore, the most effective dose of febuxostat in gout was deemed to be the best choice in the TLS 
setting with the aim to prevent the acute and extensive increase in sUA following chemotherapy. This 
choice was also endorsed by the CHMP. 
In clinical practice Allopurinol 300 mg is the most commonly used dose in patients at intermediate risk of 
TLS. As Rasburicase is not widely used, high risk patients also receive allopurinol, in a higher dose, mainly 
equal to 600 mg per day. Allopurinol, however, requires a dose adjustment (reduction to 200 mg/day) in 
patients with renal impairment. Therefore, the Allopurinol arm with ‘flexible dosage’ (300 mg/day-600 
mg/day, reduced to 200 mg/day in case of renal insufficiency) was selected by the Investigator according 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 25/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to the locally approved SmPC and local clinical practice. In this study, patients at high risk of TLS were 
included if they  were considered eligible for allopurinol treatment or had no access to treatment with 
rasburicase.  
Only the Allopurinol dose was altered, whilst the Febuxostat dose (120 mg) always remained the same. In 
order to simulate a higher dose in the (blinded) Febuxostat-group, placebo capsules were utilised as a 
second dose as in the regimen of Allopurinol 600 mg. The dose was reduced in case of moderate renal 
insufficiency,  defined  as  an  estimated  CrCl  (Creatinine-Clearance)  between  30  and  59  ml/min  both 
inclusive, calculated with the Cockroft-Gault method. 
Treatment in both groups (febuxostat and allopurinol) was started 2 days prior to chemotherapy due to 
the known slow onset of allopurinol, requiring up to at least 2 days to decrease uric acid. The regular 
scheduled  treatment  duration  was  7  to  9  days,  selected  by  the  investigator  on  the  basis  of  the 
chemotherapy regimen administered to each individual patient. The short treatment period is acceptable 
considering the acuteness of the indication (TLS) sought for, where a rapid decrease in sUA is essential. 
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  acceptable.  As  stated  under  the  inclusion  criteria,  patients 
included in the study were at intermediate or high risk of TLS (284 (82.1%) patients were at intermediate 
risk whereas 62 (17.9%) were at high risk). Overall, baseline sUA level was 7.5 mg/dL in 303 (87.6%) 
patients and > 7.5 mg/dL in 43 (12.4%) patients. The TLS risk (intermediate vs high) and baseline sUA 
level  (7.5  mg/dL  vs  >7.5  mg/dL)  were  balanced  among  treatment  groups  due  to  the  randomization 
procedure. Patients at high risk were only accepted, if they were still eligible to Allopurinol treatment or 
had no access to treatment with Rasburicase and would have been otherwise treated with Allopurinol. 
Nevertheless, this approach has the benefit of not only including intermediate but also high risk patients 
in the study. 
No meaningful differences were found between the 2 treatment groups (febuxostat vs. allopurinol) with 
respect  to  demographic  characteristics  and  the  ethnicities  are  representative  of  the  European  target 
population. 
Evaluation  of  the  co-primary  endpoint  was  based  on  two  pairs  of  hypotheses  to  assess  superiority. 
According  to  the  Statistical  Analysis  Plan  (SAP),  both  null-hypotheses  would  need  to  be  rejected  to 
achieve the primary efficacy endpoint in this trial. In particular, the second pair of hypotheses for change 
in  serum  creatinine  does  not  seem  to  be  an  adequate  reflection  of  the  second  important  objective 
‘preservation  of  renal  function  after  seven  days  of  treatment’,  as  this objective  would  not  necessarily 
require a comparison to the active arm, but could be explored based on change to baseline information in 
the Febuxostat arm. Hypotheses are however put down assuming that renal function would deteriorate 
under Allopurinol (increase of 13% in the mean serum creatinine), and would stay constant over time 
under Febuxostat. In the primary efficacy analysis performed on the intention to treat population, mean 
change in serum creatinine levels from baseline (Day 1) to the Evaluation Visit (Day 8) was negative in 
both  febuxostat  and  allopurinol  groups.  Consistently,  the  time  course  of  mean  change  (%)  in  serum 
creatinine did not show any significant difference between treatment groups at any time point. This was 
due to the fact that renal function stayed equally stable over time on average in both treatment arms, and 
hence  the  superiority  of  febuxostat  over  allopurinol  (as  postulated  in  the  correspondingly  planned 
statistical  superiority  test,  SAP)  could  not  be  demonstrated.  The  underlying  planning  assumption  of 
decreased renal function over time for allopurinol was not confirmed by empirical clinical data in the trial.  
From the data presented by the MAH, it appears that the desired demonstration of preservation of renal 
function  after  seven  days  of  treatment  under  febuxostat  could  have  found  a  better  translation  to 
statistical  testing  objectives,  either  via  a  more  general  non-inferiority  assessment  or  via 
intra-febuxostat-arm  change  to  baseline  evaluation.  The  MAH  acknowledged  that  the  co-primary 
endpoint  was  formally  not  met.  Any  justification  of  why/how  this  issue  can  be  overcome  in  the 
interpretation  of  the  trial  outcome  per  se  illustrates  that  the  original  trial’s  objectives  have  not  been 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 26/55 
 
 
 
 
 
optimally  translated  to  statistically  testable  endpoints  and  hypotheses.  Hence,  from  a  methodological 
point of view the described deficiency persists. However, although this co-primary endpoint failed to show 
superiority, the CHMP is of the opinion that the demonstration of superiority versus allopurinol in terms of 
improved control of sUA levels that is seen as a clinically well-established surrogate endpoint for TLS and 
renal impairment overrules this deficiency from an clinical perspective. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
AUCsUA1-8 was significantly lower with febuxostat than in the allopurinol treatment group (514.0 ± 225.71 
vs 708.0 ± 234.42). The difference was statistically highly significant (p < .0001). 
Morever, the time course of mean sUA showed that from Day 2 to the Evaluation Visit (Day 8) the mean 
sUA level was significantly lower in the febuxostat group compared to the allopurinol group at each time 
point and the mean difference between the two treatment arms was 1 mg/dL or above at each of the time 
point.  
A  significant  sUA  reduction  began  on  Day  2  already,  i.e.  only  24  hours  after  the  onset  of  febuxostat 
treatment  and  was  maintained  over  the  measurement  period  (day  2-8).  The  fact  that  significant  sUA 
reduction with febuxostat begins on Day 2 already (i.e. only 24 hours after beginning treatment) is likely 
to be of clinical relevance for those patients in whom chemotherapy administration cannot be delayed. In 
contrast, allopurinol with its slow onset of action requires up to at least 2 days for a decrease in uric acid, 
which could allow urate nephropathy to develop. 
Sensitivity  analyses  confirmed  the  result  of  primary  efficacy  analysis  when  it  was  performed  without 
imputation of missing data (ITT population) and when performed on the per protocol (PP) population. 
Moreover,  results  of  primary  analysis  with  the  additional  covariate  “Country”  in  the  ANCOVA  model 
confirmed the results obtained in the main primary efficacy analysis, showing no significant impact for a 
“country  effect”  (p=0.4107),  whereas  it  showed  a  highly  significant  treatment  effect  in  favour  of 
febuxostat (p<.0001). 
Finally,  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  confirmed  also  in  different  subpopulations  (i.e.  baseline 
hyperuricaemia  sUA  level  ≤7.5  mg/dL  vs.  >7.5  mg/dL,  creatinine  level  ≤ULN  vs.  >ULN,  type  of 
haematological  malignancy  -  AL  vs.  CLL+Lymphoma,  ECOG  PS  score  ≤2  vs.=  3  and  TLS  risk  grade 
Intermediate vs. High). The primary efficacy analysis performed on the ITT population did not show any 
significant  difference  in  mean  change  (%)  in  serum  creatinine  level  from  baseline  (Day  1)  to  the 
Evaluation Visit (Day 8) between Febuxostat and Allopurinol treatment groups (-0.83 ± 26.98 vs -4.92 ± 
16.70 respectively, p=0.0903). The time course analysis of change (%) in serum creatinine level did not 
show any significant difference between treatment arms at any time point. Moreover, the time course 
analysis of both mean serum creatinine level and of absolute change in serum creatinine from baseline to 
Day 8 showed that the change in serum creatinine was negligible in both treatment groups without any 
significant difference at any time point.  
All sensitivity analyses confirmed the lack of significant differences between treatment groups in terms of 
mean change (%) in serum creatinine level from baseline (Day 1) to the Evaluation Visit (Day 8). 
No significant difference was found in terms of LTLS or CTLS incidence between febuxostat and allopurinol 
(p=0.8488 and p=1.000, respectively). 
During the procedure, the MAH was asked to justify the proposed indication i.e. both “prevention” and 
“treatment” of hyperuricaemia. The MAH clarified that Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) represents a critical 
and possibly fatal complication resulting from the rapid lysis of large numbers of tumour cells, observed 
most often after initial treatment with chemotherapy. The resulting metabolic derangements, including 
hyperuricaemia,  hyperkalemia,  hyperphosphatemia  and  hypocalcemia  may  lead  to  serious  clinical 
complications, such as renal dysfunction, cardiac failure, seizures or death. The risk of developing TLS is 
significantly  increased  in  patients  with  higher  levels  of  UA  versus  those  with  lower  levels.  The 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 27/55 
 
 
 
 
management of hyperuricaemia for prevention and treatment of TLS in adults and children is the same, 
unless a  failure in achieving or maintaining sUA level control occurs. This is  confirmed by the current 
guidelines (Cairo and Bishop, 2004; Coiffier et al., 2008,), with the only exception of patients who develop 
acute hyperuricaemia despite prophylactic treatment with allopurinol, for whom rasburicase is indicated. 
Consistently,  the  indication  approved  for  rasburicase  is  “Treatment  and  prophylaxis  of  acute 
hyperuricaemia, in order to prevent acute renal failure, in adults, children and adolescents (aged 0 to 17 
years) with haematological malignancy with a high tumour burden and at risk of a rapid tumour lysis or 
shrinkage at initiation of chemotherapy”. 
The Phase III pivotal study showed that febuxostat was superior over allopurinol in terms of reduction of 
sUA, in patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematological malignancies at intermediate to high risk of 
TLS.  In  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  hyperuricaemia  at  baseline,  febuxostat  showed  statistically 
significant  lower  sUA  levels  over  time  than  allopurinol,  demonstrating  superiority  of  febuxostat  over 
allopurinol  in  the  treatment  of  hyperuricaemic  patients  at  risk  of  TLS.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  the 
demonstration of superiority versus allopurinol in terms of improved control of sUA levels that is seen as 
a clinically well-established surrogate endpoint for TLS and risk factor for renal impairment sufficiently 
demonstrates efficacy in the new therapeutic indication. 
Currently there are only two options available for treating hyperuricaemia occurring with chemotherapy in 
patients with haematologic malignancies (TLS), namely allopurinol (in patients at intermediate to high 
risk)  and  rasburicase  (in  high  risk  patients).  During  the  procedure  the  MAH  was  also  asked  to  justify 
whether  febuxostat  would  be  sufficient  in  those  cases  where  otherwise  rasburicase  is  considered,  i.e. 
patients at high risk of TLS requiring intensive chemotherapy. The MAH clarified that according to the 
current recommendations for the evaluation of risk and prophylaxis of TLS in adults and children with 
malignant diseases (Cairo et al., 2010), only the TLS risk grade should drive the choice of the treatment 
for prophylaxis, regardless of the intensity of the chemotherapy regimen. Patients with intermediate TLS 
risk grade should receive allopurinol whereas patients at high TLS risk grade should receive rasburicase 
unless clinically contraindicated or unavailable Consistently, the FLORENCE trial included patients who 
were candidate for allopurinol because defined as intermediate TLS risk grade or patients who were at 
high TLS risk but with no access to rasburicase. The exploratory analyses performed in subpopulations of 
patients with different baseline characteristics (including TLS risk grade Intermediate vs. High) showed 
that  the  efficacy  profile  of  febuxostat  is  maintained  in  terms  of  reduction  of  sUA  (well  established 
surrogate  endpoint  for  TLS)  and  preserving  renal  function,  in  patients  undergoing  chemotherapy  for 
haematological malignancies at intermediate to high risk of TLS.  
The CHMP therefore agreed that the indication should read as follows:”ADENURIC is indicated for the 
prevention and treatment of hyperuricaemia in adult patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematologic 
malignancies at intermediate to high risk of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)”. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The Phase III pivotal study showed that febuxostat was superior over allopurinol in terms of reduction of 
sUA  (a  well-established  surrogate  endpoint  for  TLS  and  renal  impairment)  in  patients  undergoing 
chemotherapy for haematological malignancies (HM) at intermediate to high risk of TLS. Moreover, the 
results of this trial provide evidence that febuxostat is effective in preserving renal function.  
The efficacy profile of febuxostat is maintained regardless of baseline hyperuricaemia (sUA level >7.5 
mg/dL), creatinine level, type of HM, ECOG PS score and TLS risk grade as confirmed by the exploratory 
analyses performed in subpopulations of patients with different baseline characteristics. A significantly 
higher sUA reduction compared to allopurinol is achieved after only 24 hours, which is a relevant factor in 
the prevention of urate-nephropathy, especially in patients in whom chemotherapy cannot be delayed. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 28/55 
 
 
 
 
On the whole, efficacy analyses provided clear evidence for a benefit of febuxostat over allopurinol in 
terms  of  control  of  sUA  level  throughout  the  whole  treatment  period  while  preserving  renal  function. 
Furthermore, the risk of TLS and renal events is known to increase for every mg/dl increase of sUA and 
febuxostat provided a mean sUA reduction of at least 1 mg/dL compared to allopurinol in the course of the 
trial. Thus, febuxostat is expected to provide a better control of sUA levels (and thereby lower the risk of 
TLS-consequences, e.g. renal damage) in patients with with intermediate and high risk TLS undergoing 
chemotherapy, as compared to allopurinol. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
A completed clinical development program has fully evaluated the safety and efficacy of Febuxostat 80 
and  120  mg  tablets  for  the  chronic  management  of  hyperuricemia  in  patients  with  gout.  In  addition, 
postmarketing safety information for Febuxostat is available. 
Safety  data  for  the  newly  proposed  indication  (Prevention  and  treatment  of  hyperuricemia  in  adult 
patients undergoing chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies at intermediate to high risk of Tumor 
Lysis Syndrome (TLS)) were available from one randomized, double blind, multicentre, phase III, pivotal 
study  with  Febuxostat  (120  mg  daily),  versus  Allopurinol  (200  mg,  300  mg  or  600  mg  daily,  upon 
investigator choice) in patients undergoing chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies at intermediate 
to high risk of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS). 
Patient exposure 
173 subjects have been exposed to at least one dose of febuxostat 120 mg and 173 subjects received at 
least  one  dose  of  Allopurinol  (200/300/600  mg)  in  the  clinical  development  programme  for  the  new 
proposed indication. 
Mean  exposure  to  study  treatment  was  7.6  ±  0.92  days  for  the  overall  safety  population,  with  no 
differences observed between the treatment groups (7.5 ± 0.85 days in the Febuxostat group and 7.6± 
0.99 days in the Allopurinol group). 
Details on exposure are provided in Table 10 below: 
Table 10: Exposure to study treatments – Safety Population 
Demographic and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 12 and Table 11 respectively. 
As described in Table 11, the number (%) of patients in Allopurinol arm treated at low/standard/high dose 
was 1(0.5%), 143 (82.7%) and 29 (16.8%) respectively.

Adverse events  
The following sections refer to Treatment Emergent Signs or Symptoms (TESSs), which were defined as 
AEs/SAEs occurring for the first time or worsening in terms of seriousness, severity or relationship to the 
medicinal product after first drug intake. 
In total, 229 (66.2%) patients experienced TESSs: n= 117 (67.6%) patients in the Febuxostat group and 
n=112 (64.7%) patients in the Allopurinol group. The overall number of TESS reported in each group was 
635 in the Febuxostat group and 503 in the Allopurinol group. 
Treatment Emergent Signs or Symptoms (TESSs): 
In  the  pivotal  Phase  III  study,  the  overall  proportion  of  subjects  with  at  least  one  TESS  was  similar 
between  treatment  groups,  though  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  Febuxostat  group  experienced 
moderate and severe TESSs (41.0% vs. 37.6% and 31.2% vs. 18.5% for moderate and severe TESSs in 
Febuxostat and Allopurinol group respectively). A total of 7.8% patients in the overall safety population 
experienced serious TESSs, with a higher proportion in Febuxostat treatment group (namely 12.1% vs. 
3.5% in Febuxostat and Allopurinol group respectively). 
A  total  of  45  TESSs  satisfied  the  definition  of  serious,  however  none  of  them  were  judged  by  the 
investigator as treatment related in any treatment group. 
A total of 3 TESSs leading to treatment withdrawal occurred in 1 (0.3%) patient, who was allocated to 
Febuxostat; the events were serious and, as above, were also judged to be not related to study treatment 
by the investigator. 
An overview of TESSs (overall and treatment-related) reported during the study is provided in Table 13:

Table 14: TESSs reported in ≥5% patients in any treatment group by MedDRA SOC, PT, and 
treatment – Safety Population 
At  a  SOC  level,  the  greatest  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  TESSs  was  reported  in  blood  and 
lymphatic system disorders (37.6% patients), gastrointestinal disorders (30.9% patients), investigations 
(21.1%  patients),  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (20.2%  patients)  and  general  disorders  and 
administration site conditions (19.9% patients). 
At  the  Preferred  term  (PT)  level,  the  most  common  TESSs  included  anaemia,  febrile  neutropenia, 
leukopenia,  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  constipation,  diarrhoea,  nausea,  vomiting,  mucosal 
inflammation, pyrexia, platelet count decreased, hyperglycaemia, hyperphosphataemia and headache. 
Among  these  events,  some  imbalance  between  treatment  groups  occurred;  in  particular,  Febuxostat 
group  retained  a  higher  incidence  of  anaemia  (22.5%  vs.  14.5%),  mucosal  inflammation  (6.4%  vs. 
1.7%), pyrexia (13.9% vs. 10.4%) and headache (8.7% vs. 2.9%), whereas Allopurinol treatment group 
retained  a  higher  incidence  of  neutropenia  (23.7%  vs.  17.9%).  No  other  notable  difference  between 
treatment groups was detected for the remaining above mentioned PTs. 
Treatment-related TESSs: 
TESSs which were judged by the investigator as treatment related were reported in a total n= 22 (6.4%) 
patients, without any difference between treatment groups being reported in n=11 (6.4%) patients in 
each treatment group. The majority of patients experiencing treatment-related TESSs had either mild or 
moderate treatment-related events, with a slightly higher proportion of patients experiencing moderate

treatment-related events in Allopurinol treatment group (1.2% vs 4.6% in Febuxostat and Allopurinol 
arm respectively).  
Mild to moderate related TESSs occurring in ≥1% patients in any treatment group are shown in Table 15. 
The SOCs most frequently affected by mild and moderate treatment-related TESSs were investigations 
and gastrointestinal disorders, without imbalances between treatment groups. The most frequent mild 
and moderate treatment-related events were blood uric acid decreased and diarrhoea, both occurring in 
3 (0.9%) patients in total.

A total of 3 treatment-related TESSs judged as severe in intensity occurred in 2 (0.6%) patients, both 
allocated to Allopurinol treatment group (Table 16).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse event: 
A  total  of  45  serious  TESSs  occurred  in  27  (7.8%)  patients,  with  a  higher  proportion  in  Febuxostat 
treatment group (12.1% vs 3.5% in Febuxostat and Allopurinol arm respectively), however none of them 
were judged by the investigator as treatment related in any treatment group. 
The  SOCs  most  frequently  affected  by  serious  TESSs  (including  fatal  events)  were  infections  and 
infestations with 13 events occurring in 10 (2.9%) patients in total, blood and lymphatic system disorders 
with 10 events occurring in 6 (1.7%) patients in total and investigations with 4 events occurring in 4 
(1.2%) patients in total. Apart from a higher number of serious TESSs belonging to the SOC infections and 
infestations  and  a  slightly  higher  percentage  of  patients  experiencing  such  events  in  Febuxostat 
treatment group, namely 11 events in 8 (4.6%) patients and 2 events in 2 (1.2%) patients in Febuxostat 
and Allopurinol arm respectively, no remarkable difference between treatment groups occurred at the 
SOC level.

The most frequently serious TESSs by PT were pneumonia occurring in 7 (2.0%) patients in total and 
febrile neutropenia, occurring in 4 (1.2%) patients in total. Both type of events occurred in a slightly 
higher number and percentage of patients in Febuxostat treatment group, namely 5 (2.9%) and 2 (1.2%) 
patients in Febuxostat and Allopurinol treatment group respectively for pneumonia and 3 (1.7%) and 1 
(0.6%) patients in Febuxostat and Allopurinol treatment group respectively for febrile neutropenia. 
A summary of the serious TESSs reported in ≥1% patients overall by SOC and PT is provided in Table 18. 
Table 18: Serious TESSs reported in ≥1% patients overall by MedDRA SOC, PT, and treatment 
Safety Population 
A total of 3 TESSs leading to treatment withdrawal occurred in 1 (0.3%) patient, who was allocated to 
Febuxostat; the events were serious and, as above, were judged by the investigator as not related to 
study treatment. 
Other serious adverse events: 
Other  serious  events  not  resulting  in  death  are  displayed  in  Table  19.  Twenty-two  serious  TESSs  not 
resulting in death occurred in 17 patients in the Febuxostat treatment group, whereas 8 serious TESSs not 
resulting in death occurred in 6 patients in Allopurinol treatment group. Overall, the types of events were 
expected in the light of the study population, with the exception of cerebral ischaemia which occurred to 
patient 390702, allocated to Febuxostat treatment group, and was assessed as unlikely related to study 
treatment, by both the Investigator and the Sponsor. No serious TESSs with outcome other than fatal led 
to treatment withdrawal.

Table 19: Patients with serious TESSs not resulting in death – Safety Population 
Deaths: 
A total of 15 TESSs with fatal outcome (including also those which started within the study period but 
resulted in death after the End of Study Visit) occurred in 6 (1.7%) patients, all allocated to Febuxostat 
treatment group. None of them was judged by the investigator as related to study treatment. Only 3 out 
of these 6 patients experienced TESSs with a fatal outcome during the study period, i.e. before their End 
of Study Visit (one patient experienced fatal pneumonia, sepsis and septic shock, one patient experienced 
fatal myocardial ischaemia and acute cardiac failure, one patient  experienced fatal haematuria, sepsis 
and shock). The 3 fatal events reported by the third patient  led also to treatment withdrawal (see Table 
21). 
On the other hand, 3 patients experienced TESSs during the study period which had a fatal outcome after 
the  respective  End  of  Study  Visit  (by  PT:  one  patient  experienced  fatal  bronchitis,  one  patient  
experienced  fatal  atrial  fibrillation,  pneumonia  and  renal  failure,  one  patient  experienced  fatal  febrile 
neutropenia, pneumonia and respiratory failure). It should be noted that the second patient  received 
commercial Allopurinol 300 mg twice daily while on study (with “AE renal failure” as indication) up to 2 
days prior patient’s death. This was reported as a protocol deviation. 
Finally, two further patients (one allocated to Febuxostat and another to Allopurinol treatment group) 
experienced not treatment-related TESSs with fatal outcome that were notified to the Sponsor although 
their onset date occurred after the End of Study Visit.  
List of deaths occurred in the study are summarized in Table 20:

Table 21: Patients with TESSs leading to treatment withdrawal – Safety Population 
Other significant adverse events: 
Six TESSs leading to dose reduction occurred in 4 patients in Febuxostat treatment group, whereas no 
TESSs  leading  to  dose  reduction  occurred  in  Allopurinol  treatment  group  (note:  only  Allopurinol  dose 
reduction was actually allowed). These events are displayed in Table 22. 
Three of these events were considered related to study drug and were by PT blood uric acid decreased. 
These events occurred in 3 consecutive patients enrolled at the same study site. The other events leading 
to dose reduction were tumour lysis syndrome, renal failure and hyperphosphataemia, all occurring in one 
patient which was considered by the MAH as a Special Case with lack of drug effect.

Laboratory findings 
Serum biochemistry: 
In the phase III pivotal trial, the following parameters had meaningful changes: 
• 
LDH: a trend for decrease in mean LDH value occurred in both treatment groups with no notable 
difference  between  them.  Such  decrease  was  expected  as  a  result  of  the  efficacy  of  the 
chemotherapy regimens over the haematological diseases 
• 
sUA: a trend for decrease in mean sUA value occurred in both treatment groups and was more 
pronounced in Febuxostat group. Such decrease occurred up to Visit 8 and Visit 9 (for patients 
who prolonged the treatment) consistently with the administration period of study drug. Besides, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 38/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
it was expected as a result of the efficacy of both Febuxostat and Allopurinol in lowering sUA and 
was more pronounced in Febuxostat group consistently with the efficacy results.  
No  consistent  trends  for  change  over  time  were  seen  for  any  of  the  remaining  serum  biochemistry 
parameters during the study in any treatment group. A higher mean LDH value, consistent with its higher 
mean baseline, was detected in Febuxostat group at each visit with the exception of Visit 9. A lower mean 
sUA value was detected in Febuxostat compared to Allopurinol group at each visit since Visit 2 up to the 
end  of  treatment  period,  consistently  with  the  efficacy  results.  No  notable  difference  in  other  serum 
chemistry results was seen between the treatment groups. 
Less than 5% of patients with baseline normal or abnormal (not clinically significant) value experienced a 
shift to a clinically significant abnormal postbaseline result for any serum biochemistry parameters at any 
selected time point (namely at Visit 3, i.e. start of chemotherapy, at Visit 8, i.e. Evaluation Visit and at 
Visit  10,  i.e.  End  of  Study  Visit)  in  any  treatment  group,  with  no  remarkable  differences  between 
treatment groups.  
Haematology: 
In the phase III pivotal trial, the following parameters had meaningful changes: 
•Haemoglobin (Hb): a slight trend for decrease in mean Hb value occurred in both treatment groups with 
no notable difference between them  
•Haematocrit (Htc): a slight trend for decrease in mean Htc value occurred in both treatment groups with 
no notable difference between them  
•Absolute lymphocyte count: a trend for decrease in mean absolute lymphocyte count occurred in both 
treatment groups and was slightly more pronounced in Febuxostat group  
•Absolute  monocyte  count:  a  trend  for  decrease  in  mean  absolute  monocyte  count  occurred  in  both 
treatment groups with no notable difference between them  
•Absolute  neutrophil  count:  a  trend  for  decrease  in  mean  absolute  neutrophil  count  occurred  in  both 
treatment  groups  with  no  notable  difference  between  them.  Its  clinical  relevance  was  remarked  by  a 
relevant  increase  in  the  percentage  of  patients  with  absolute  neutrophil  count  assessed  as  abnormal 
clinically significant at the End of Study Visit, which occurred in the overall safety population (from 4.6% 
at baseline to 20.9% at the End of Study Visit) and in both treatment groups with no notable difference 
between  them  (namely  5.8%  to  20.1%  and  3.5%  to  21.8%  at  baseline  and  End  of  Study  Visit  in 
Febuxostat and Allopurinol group respectively). 
•Platelet count: a slight trend for decrease in mean platelet count occurred in both treatment groups and 
was slightly more pronounced in Febuxostat one 
•White blood cells (WBC) count: a trend for decrease in mean WBC count occurred in both treatment 
groups and was slightly more pronounced in Febuxostat one  
These trends for changes were expected in the light of the study population and the slight differences 
observed  between  treatment  groups  were  likely  due  to  their  differences  in  terms  of  HM  and  of 
chemotherapy  regimens.  No  clinically  relevant  trends  for  change  over  time  were  seen  for  any  of  the 
remaining haematology parameters during the study in either the Febuxostat or Allopurinol group. No 
notable difference in other haematology results was seen between the treatment groups. 
Parameters for which ≥5% of patients with baseline normal or abnormal (not clinically significant) value 
experienced  a  shift  to  a  clinically  significant  abnormal  post-baseline  result  at  any  selected  time  point 
(namely at Visit 3, start of chemotherapy, at Visit 8, Evaluation Visit and at Visit 10, End of Study Visit) 
in any treatment group were as following: 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 39/55 
 
 
 
 
•Absolute neutrophil count: 5.9% and 18.4% patients in total at Visit 8 and Visit 10 respectively, with no 
remarkable differences between treatment groups  
•WBC count: 14.7% at Visit 10, with a slightly higher proportion in Allopurinol treatment group (15.6% 
and 19.6% in Febuxostat and Allopurinol arm respectively) 
•Neutrophil (%): 11.8% patients in total at Visit 10, with no remarkable differences between treatment 
groups  
•Platelet count: 8.8% patients in total at Visit 10, with no remarkable differences between treatment 
groups  
•Hb: 4.1% patients in total at Visit 10, with a higher proportion in Febuxostat treatment group (6.9% and 
2.6% in Febuxostat and Allopurinol arm respectively) 
•Absolute lymphocyte count: 3.1% at Visit 10, with a slightly higher proportion in Febuxostat treatment 
group (5.4% and 1.4% in Febuxostat and Allopurinol arm respectively) 
•Htc: 2.7% patients in total at Visit 10, with a higher proportion in Febuxostat treatment group (5.2% and 
0.6% in Febuxostat and Allopurinol arm respectively) 
These  shifts  occurred  at  time  points  consistent  with  the  expected  haematological  toxicity  of 
chemotherapy,  and  the  differences  observed  between  treatment  groups  were  likely  due  to  the 
heterogeneity of chemotherapy regimens administered to patients. 
Individual clinically significant abnormalities 
Adverse  events  relating  to  haematology  abnormalities  reported  in  ≥5%  of  patients  overall  were 
neutropenia (20.8% patients in total), anaemia (18.5% patients in total), leukopenia (15.6% patients in 
total) and thrombocytopenia (13.0% patients in total). No notable differences between treatment groups 
were seen for leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, whereas there was a higher incidence of anaemia in 
Febuxostat group (22.5% and 14.5% in Febuxostat and Allopurinol treatment group respectively) and a 
higher incidence of neutropenia in Allopurinol group (17.9% and 23.7% in Febuxostat and Allopurinol 
treatment group respectively). 
Serious  TESSs  pertaining  to  haematology  abnormalities  were  reported  in  small  numbers  of  patients: 
leukopenia,  neutropenia  and  platelet  count  decreased  in  2  (0.6%)  patients  in  total  each,  anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia and white blood cell count decreased in 1 (0.3%) patients in total each. No remarkable 
differences were seen between the treatment groups in the reporting of these serious TESSs. 
Serious TESSs relating to serum biochemistry abnormalities were reported in small numbers of patients 
as  well:  blood  bilirubin  increase,  hypokalaemia,  tumour  lysis  syndrome  and  renal  failure  in  1  (0.3%) 
patient/each  parameter.  Hypokalaemia  occurred  in  Allopurinol  treatment  group,  whereas  the  others 
occurred in Febuxostat group. 
Only  one  event  of  haematuria  occurring  in  1  (0.3%)  patients  in  total  (allocated  to  Febuxostat)  was 
reported among serious TESSs pertaining to urinalysis abnormalities. 
Urinalysis: 
No clinically relevant trends for change over time were seen for any of parameter during the study in 
either Febuxostat or Allopurinol group. Less than 2% of patients with baseline normal or abnormal (not 
clinically significant) value experienced a shift to a clinically significant abnormal post-baseline result for 
urinalysis parameters at any selected time point (namely at Visit 3, start of chemotherapy, at Visit 8, 
Evaluation Visit and at Visit 10, End of Study Visit) in any treatment group, with no remarkable differences 
between treatment groups.

Vital Signs, Physical Findings and Other Observations Related to Safety: 
No clinically significant treatment differences or changes from baseline were observed for any vital sign. 
At Visit 10 (End of Study) only a small percentage of patients for each baseline Performance Status (PS) 
score worsened in a higher PS score with no relevant unbalance between treatment groups. At Visit 10 
(End of Study) only a small number of patients for each physical examination parameter worsened from 
either  normal  or  abnormal  not  clinically  significant  to  abnormal  clinically  significant  findings.  The 
parameter with the higher proportion of patients worsening from either normal or abnormal not clinically 
significant to abnormal clinically significant findings not linked with target HM was skin, with no relevant 
unbalance between treatment groups. At Visit 10 (End of Study) only 3 patients in each treatment group 
with  either  normal  or  abnormal  not  clinically  significant  baseline  for  12-lead-ECG  shifted  to  abnormal 
clinically significant findings. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Seven (2.0%) patients, out of 346 randomised, discontinued the study after randomisation, thus 
resulting in a total of 339 patients completing the study. Three patients (allocated to Febuxostat) 
discontinued the study due to “Death”. Two patients (allocated to Allopurinol) discontinued the study due 
to “Withdrawal by patient”. One patient (allocated to Allopurinol) discontinued the study due to “Protocol 
Violation” and another patient (allocated to Febuxostat) discontinued the study due to “Patient refused to 
come to scheduled Visit 10”. None of these 7 discontinued patients attended the End-of-study visit (Table 
23).

Post marketing experience 
The  below  table  (Table  24)  displays  the  worldwide  post-marketing  patient  exposure  by  dose  and  by 
geographic area. Patient exposure, expressed in patient-year (PY) has been estimated by assuming that 
a patient takes 1 tablet a day for 365.25 days, whatever the dose.

Table 24. Estimated cumulative post-marketing patient exposure by dose and by geographic 
area at April 2014. 
Cumulatively, post-marketing exposure amounted to about 2.8 million PY, 725,165 of which in countries 
of the EEA. The EEA exposure at 120 mg amounted to 61,334 PY, corresponding to about 8% of the total 
EEA exposure. It is worth noting that this percentage is similar to the difference between the proportion 
of patients achieving targeted sUA levels <6 mg/dL at 80 (73%) and 120 mg (79%) at the final visit in 
Phase III studies for gout. 
8,287  of  spontaneously  reported  (non  solicited)  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs)  and  55  serious  ADRs 
(SADRs)  from  post-marketing  solicited  sources  have  been  collected  worldwide  in  the  post-marketing 
surveillance. These ADRs were described in 5,057 cases, 971 of which met the seriousness criteria for a 
total of 1,871 SADRs. Table 25 displays ADRs by System Organ Class (SOC) and seriousness.

Table  25.  Cumulative  post-marketing  ADRs  (spontaneous  serious  and  non-serious  and 
serious solicited) by SOC and Seriousness. 
The dose was known in 75% of collected cases: no difference was observed in the overall reporting rate 
by dose (2.37, 2.03 and 1.64 cases per 1000 PY at 40, 80 and 120 mg, respectively). For cases meeting 
the  seriousness  criteria  the  dose  was  known  in  78%  of  cases;  also  for  serious  case  no  trend  for  a 
dose-relationship in the reporting rate was observed (0.36, 0.46 and 0.41 serious cases per 1000 PY at 
40, 80 and 120 mg, respectively). 
The SOC cumulating the greatest number of ADRs was “Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders” (n = 
1,393, 14% of which serious), where the most represented PT was “Rash” (listed, n = 426, 17 of which 
serious). The PT including the greatest number of SADRs was  “Pruritus” (listed, n = 20), followed by 
“Rash”. 
The second SOC in number of events was “Investigations” (n = 1,159, 15% of which serious), where the 
most represented PT was “Liver function test abnormal” (listed, n = 152, 14 of which serious) whereas the 
term cumulating the greatest number of SADRs was “Hepatic enzyme increased” (listed, n = 17). The 
second PT including the greatest number of SADRs was “Liver function test abnormal”. 
The third SOC in number of events was “Gastrointestinal disorders” (n = 925, 12% of which serious), 
where the most represented PT was “Nausea” (listed, n = 225, 12 of which serious). The PT gathering the 
greatest number of SADRs was “Diarrhoea” (listed, n = 26), followed by “Nausea”.

The fourth SOC in number of events was “General disorders and administration site conditions” (n = 890, 
21% of which serious), where the most represented PT was “Drug ineffective” (listed by definition, n = 
141, 1 serious). The PT cumulating the greatest number of SADRs was “Drug interaction” (n = 27) where 
the most commonly reported interaction in serious cases was with azathioprine (listed). The second PT 
including the greatest number of SADRs was “Malaise” (n = 17); this term is unlisted, but it is very generic 
term and, accordingly was described in cases reporting an array of heterogeneous symptoms. 
The fifth SOC in  number of events was  “Metabolism and nutrition disorders” (n = 742, 10% of which 
serious), where the most represented PT was “Gout”, referring to the LLT “Gout flares” (listed, n = 629, 
31  serious),  which  was  also  the  first  PT  in  number  of  SADRs,  whereas  the  second  PT  gathering  the 
greatest number of serious events was “Dehydration” (n = 11, unlisted) which was described in most of 
cases concerning elderly patients often suffering from diarrhea or vomiting. 
The sixth SOC in number of events was “Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” (n = 672, 16% 
of which serious), where the most represented PT was “Arthralgia” (listed, n = 180, 26 of which serious). 
This PT, together “Rhabdomyolysis” (listed), was also the term cumulating the greatest number of serious 
events. 
The seventh SOC in number of events was “Nervous system disorders” (n = 614, 21% of which serious), 
where the most represented PT was “Dizziness” (listed, n = 148, 14 of which serious). The PT cumulating 
the greatest number of SADRs was “Cerebrovascular accident” (n = 25, unlisted), followed by “Dizziness”. 
Concerning cerebrovascular accidents, these events more likely reflects cardiovascular co-morbidities of 
the target patient population, rather than being causally related to febuxostat. In fact, it is worth pointing 
out that hyperuricaemia itself is a risk factor for developing these kinds of events as widely described in 
the literature. 
The eighth SOC in number of events was “Renal and urinary disorders” (n = 437, 45% of which serious), 
where the most represented PT was “Renal failure acute” (listed, n = 79, 78 of which serious), this PT, 
together “Renal failure” (listed n = 55 serious events), was the term cumulating the greatest number of 
SADRs.  As  for  cerebrovascular  accidents,  renal  events,  and  renal  failure  in  particular,  should  be 
considered  a  very  common  consequence  of  hyperuricaemia  (e.g.,  Fuldeore  et  al.,  2011),  rather  than 
being associated to febuxostat treatment; hyperuricaemia itself is in the vast majority of cases a renal 
disease due to the impairment of uric acid excretion at the renal level. Actually there is evidence that 
febuxostat exerts some protection on the deterioration of the renal function in gout patients (Whelton et 
al., 2013). Furthermore, 3 studies (Filiopulos et al., 2013; Ivanov and Ivanova, 2013; Kanai et al., 2013) 
have  confirmed  the  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  of  febuxostat  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe 
chronic kidney disease. Finally, although carried out in a limited number of patients, a recent study on 
patients  under  dialysis  indicated  that  febuxostat  was  effective  and  well  tolerated  in  these  patients 
(Horikoshi et al., 2013). 
The ninth SOC in number of events was “Cardiac disorders” (n = 232, 70% of which serious), where the 
most represented PT was “Palpitations” (listed, n = 50, 9 of which serious). The PT gathering the greatest 
number of serious events was “Myocardial infarction” (unlisted, n = 38), followed by “Cardiac failure” 
(unlisted, n = 27). Again, cardiovascular diseases are a common background of gout and hyperuricaemia, 
as about 26% had history of ischaemic heart diseases including infarction and heart failure (Singh et al., 
2011; Perez-Ruiz et al., 2014). Patients with gout are also predisposed to heart failure and infarction 
because: i) The presence of other cardiovascular comorbidities, and risk factors for myocardial infarction 
and heart failure in about 74% of patients (Singh et al., 2011); ii) previous history of infarction or heart 
failure (Thanassoulis et at., 2010); iii) gout/hyperuricemia is recognised as an independent risk factor for 
heart failure as gout patients had 2 to 3-fold higher incidence of heart failure or myocardial infarction, 
including  events  with  fatal  outcome  (Perez-Ruiz  et  al.,  2014),  as  compared  with  those  without  gout 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 44/55 
 
 
 
 
(Krishnan  et  al,  2012).  Therefore,  these  serious  cardiac  events  are  much  more  likely  representing 
outcomes of gout rather than ADRs caused by febuxostat. 
The tenth SOC in number of events was “Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” (n = 172, 43% 
of which serious), where the most represented PT was “Dyspnoea” (listed, n = 60, 21 of which serious); 
“Dyspnoea” was also the PT gathering the greatest number of serious events, followed by “Pulmonary 
embolism” (unlisted, n = 10). As for other cardiovascular events, gout and hyperuricemia also represent 
risk factors for the development of pulmonary embolism (Yamada et al., 2010). 
Overall  the  safety  profile  emerging  from  the  post-marketing  surveillance  widely  overlaps  to  that  for 
allopurinol,  being  “Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders”,  “Investigations”  (i.e.,  liver  function), 
“Gastrointestinal disorders”, “Metabolism and nutrition disorders”, the most commonly affected SOCs for 
both drugs, thus confirming the findings of clinical trials whereas there is a clear evidence that all the 
above mentioned unlisted events (and also some of the listed ones, i.e., renal failure) are part of the 
natural history of the disease. 
The safety profile which emerged from clinical studies was confirmed in the post-marketing experience, 
however some adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were exclusively collected in the postmarketing, probably 
because  their  frequency  is  rare  enough  to  hinder  the  detection  in  clinical  trials.  Therefore 
skin/hypersensitivity  reactions  such  as  Anaphylactic  reaction,  Drug  hypersensitivity,  Toxic  epidermal 
necrolysis,  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome,  Angioedema,  Drug  reaction  with  eosinophilia  and  systemic 
symptoms, generalised rash and pruritic rash have been added as rare ADRs in the product information 
on the basis of the post-marketing experience. Likewise hepatic events such as Jaundice and Liver injury, 
renal events (Tubulointerstital nephritis), and musculoskeletal events (Rhabdomyolysis) were inserted as 
rare ADRs on the basis of the postmarketing experience. 
Currently 3 safety topics have been considered important identified risks for febuxostat (Serious skin / 
hypersensitivity ADRs, rhabdomyolysis and drug-drug interaction between febuxostat and azathioprine / 
mercaptopurine), whereas 6 additional safety topics such as cardiovascular events, hepatic events, renal 
events,  neurological  events,  haematological  /  bleeding  events  and  thyroid  events  were  considered 
potential risks. 
The important identified risks overlap with known safety issues for allopurinol, likewise allopurinol can be 
associated with cardiovascular events, hepatic events, renal events, neurological events, haematological 
/ bleeding events and thyroid events, although some of these safety issues are due co-morbidities of the 
target patient population. Overall the emerging safety profile overlaps with that of allopurinol, therefore 
all ADRs identified to be causally related to febuxostat can be considered as  class effects of xanthine 
oxidase inhibitors. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  most  common  TESSs  reported  in  the  treatment  groups  were  anaemia,  febrile  neutropenia, 
leukopenia,  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  constipation,  diarrhoea,  nausea,  vomiting,  mucosal 
inflammation, pyrexia, decreased platelet count, hyperglycaemia, hyperphosphataemia and headache. 
Among these events, some imbalance between treatment groups occurred; in particular, the febuxostat 
group showed a higher incidence of anaemia, mucosal inflammation, pyrexia and headache, whereas the 
allopurinol  treatment  group  showed  a  higher  incidence  of  neutropenia.  No  other  notable  difference 
between treatment groups was detected for the remaining PTs mentioned above. 
There  were  3  new  treatment-related  TESSs  observed  in  the  febuxostat  arm  of  the  study:  left  bundle 
branch block, sinus tachycardia and haemorrhage. The MAH proposed to implement these new TESSs in 
the product information of febuxostat which was agreed by the CHMP. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 45/55 
 
 
 
 
A higher proportion of patients in the febuxostat group experienced moderate and severe TESSs (41.0% 
vs. 37.6% and 31.2% vs. 18.5% for moderate and severe TESSs in febuxostat and allopurinol group 
respectively) and also a higher proportion of patients in the febuxostat treatment group experienced 
serious TESSs (namely 12.1% vs. 3.5% in febuxostat and allopurinol group respectively), all of them 
were judged to be not treatment related in any treatment group by the investigator. The MAH provided 
a  discussion  regarding  the  imbalance  of  serious  events,  which  occurred  more  frequently  in  the 
febuxostat group. It was explained that several factors have contributed to an imbalance in adverse 
events between treatment arms: bias caused by the imbalances in terms of types of HM and some other 
medical history conditions, the lack of restriction in terms of number of previous lines of chemotherapy 
and the chemotherapy regimens to be administered to the patients.  The MAH also provided a detailed 
discussion about febrile neutropenia, pneumonia and infection which occurred with greater frequency in 
the febuxostat arm and mentioned that the same factors have contributed to an imbalance for these 
adverse  events  between  treatment  arms.  The  baseline  imbalances  between  treatment  groups  were 
considered a plausible explanation by the CHMP. 
A total of 6 (1.7%) patients experienced TESSs resulting in death and all were allocated to the febuxostat 
group, all of them were judged to be not treatment-related by the investigator. Based on the detailed 
analysis  provided  by  the  MAH  of  each  fatal  outcome  in  the  FLORENCE  study,  a  relation  to  the  study 
treatment cannot be detected. However, currently a post marketing comparative cardiovascular safety 
study  is  ongoing  (as  described  in  the  RMP)  to  clarify  the  cardiovascular  risk  profile  of  febuxostat  vs. 
allopurinol (FAST). In view of the risk for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death associated with TLS the 
CHMP  requested  as  a  precautionary  measure  cardiac  monitoring  as  clinically  appropriate  during  the 
therapy with febuxostat and the product information was updated accordingly. 
Four patients in total experienced TESSs leading to dose reduction. These subjects were all allocated to 
febuxostat, whereas no TESSs leading to dose reduction occurred in allopurinol treatment group. In 3 
patients, the event leading to the dose reduction was considered to be treatment-related as blood uric 
acid concentrations were excessively decreased for these 3 patients, thus reflecting the efficacy of the 
urate lowering treatment. The other events leading to dose reduction were tumour lysis syndrome, renal 
failure and hyperphosphataemia, all of which occurred in one patient. This was considered to be a special 
case of lack of drug effect by the sponsor. During the procedure, the MAH provided a detailed discussion 
about the patient with lack of drug effect. The MAH clarified that some prior or concomitant medications 
may  have contributed  to  the  development  of  the  above  conditions;  therefore  it  is  conceivable  that 
several  factors  have  led  to  their  development.  Particularly,  the  main  contribution  was likely  given 
by some patient’s baseline characteristics and conditions: elderly age, advanced stage DLCBL with bulky 
disease and high proliferative rate (as witnessed by the LDH level), generalized oedemas treated with 
intravenous  diuretics  and  impaired  renal function with reduced renal parenchymal reserve. Finally, it 
is also worth noting that the investigator decided (in blind condition) to continue the study treatment, 
thus  confirming that  the  benefit/risk  assessment  was  still  in  favour  of  continuing  the  urate-lowering 
treatment. Though it is acknowledged that sUA plays a key role in TLS and renal damage development, 
in  some  patients  these complications may  arise due  to other  factors which cannot be  controlled with 
urate- lowering agents; nevertheless, as occurred for this patient, the maintenance of an adequate sUA 
control is essential to prevent further worsening in TLS and renal insufficiency. This rational was found 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
No significant differences or changes from baseline were observed for any vital sign between febuxostat 
and allopurinol group. 
Regarding the patients completing the study (339 out of 346 subjects completed the study), the number 
as well as the reason for the discontinuation were considered to be acceptable.

The  SOCs  with  the  highest  number  of  spontaneous  reported  serious  adverse  events  were  renal  and 
urinary disorders (197 ADRs), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (193 ADRs), general disorders and 
administration site conditions (183 ADRS) and investigations (169 ADRs). 
Additional safety information from a completed clinical development program which has fully evaluated 
the safety and efficacy of Febuxostat 80 and 120 mg tablets for the chronic management of 
hyperuricemia in patients with gout and in addition, postmarketing safety information for Febuxostat was 
available. No new safety information can be identified from postmarketing experience which has not 
already been evaluated during former PSUR assessment procedures. 
The MAH provided an assessment about interactions of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy which 
was based on already known febuxostat data and literature references available on anticancer drugs.  
No drug-drug interaction data of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy are available and possible 
interactions of febuxostat with any concomitantly administered cytotoxic drug cannot be excluded 
definitely. Therefore possible interactions of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy should be closely 
monitored in future PSURs (all cases including possible interactions should be reviewed and discussed). 
The RMP has also been updated accordingly. The MAH has also updated the wording in the PI as follows: 
“Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. In the 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome pivotal trial febuxostat 120 mg daily was administered to patients undergoing 
several chemotherapy regimens, including monoclonal antibodies. However, drug-drug and drug-disease 
interactions were not explored during this study. Therefore, possible interactions with any concomitantly 
administered cytotoxic drug cannot be ruled out”.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In the randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 pivotal FLORENCE study comparing febuxostat with allopurinol 
(in 346 patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies at intermediate-to-high risk of 
TLS), 22 (6.4%) patients overall experienced adverse reactions, namely 11 (6.4%) patients in each 
treatment group. The majority of adverse reactions were either mild or moderate. 
Overall, the FLORENCE trial did not highlight any particular safety concern in addition to the previous 
experience with febuxostat in gout, with the exception of the following three adverse reactions Left 
bundle branch block, sinus tachycardia and haemorrhage which were included in the product information. 
A total of 6 (1.7%) patients experienced TESSs resulting in death and all were allocated to the febuxostat 
group, all of them were judged to be not treatment-related by the investigator. Based on the detailed 
analysis  provided  by  the  MAH  of  each  fatal  outcome  in  the  FLORENCE  study,  a  relation  to  the  study 
treatment cannot be detected. However, currently a post marketing comparative cardiovascular safety 
study  is  ongoing  (as  described  in  the  RMP)  to  clarify  the  cardiovascular  risk  profile  of  febuxostat  vs. 
allopurinol (FAST). In view of the known risk for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death associated with 
TLS the CHMP requested as a precautionary measure cardiac monitoring as clinically appropriate during 
therapy with febuxostat and the product information was updated accordingly. 
No interaction studies have been conducted by the MAH. The Florence study has not been designed to 
deliver information about interactions with cytotoxic chemotherapy and the product information has been 
updated accordingly. The MAH will closely monitor (as described in the RMP) the case reports of drug-drug 
interactions in the next PSURs. In addition, the MAH should submit the following safety data in the next 
PSUR:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to the need to undergo cardiac examination has been 
added to the product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The Phase III pivotal study showed that febuxostat is superior over allopurinol in terms of reduction of 
sUA  (a  well-established  surrogate  endpoint  for  TLS  and  renal  impairment),  in  patients  undergoing 
chemotherapy for haematological malignancies at intermediate to high risk of TLS. Moreover, results of 
this trial provide evidence that febuxostat is effective in preserving renal function.  
The efficacy profile of febuxostat is maintained regardless of baseline hyperuricaemia (sUA level >7.5 
mg/dL), creatinine level, type of HM, ECOG PS score and TLS risk grade as confirmed by the exploratory 
analyses performed in subpopulations of patients with different baseline characteristics. 
A significantly higher sUA reduction compared to allopurinol is achieved after only 24 hours, which is a 
relevant  factor  in  the  prevention  of  urate-nephropathy,  especially  in  patients  in  whom  chemotherapy 
cannot be delayed. 
On the whole, efficacy analyses provided clear evidence for a benefit of febuxostat over allopurinol in 
terms of control of sUA level throughout the whole treatment period while preserving renal function.  
Furthermore, as the risk of TLS and renal events is known to increase for every mg/dl increase of sUA and 
febuxostat provided a mean sUA reduction of at least 1 mg/dL compared with allopurinol in the course of 
the trial, febuxostat is expected to provide a better control of sUA levels (and thereby lower the risk of 
TLS-consequences, e.g. renal damage) in patients undergoing chemotherapy, as compared to allopurinol. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
It has to be noted though, that in the submitted study (FLO-01), patients with only certain types of 
haematological malignancies (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia CLL, acute leukaemia AL and Lymphoma) 
were included. Therefore no data is available regarding other cytostatics and co-medications used in 
haematologic malignancies other than those involved in the study and possible interactions of these with 
Febuxostat, with the risk of having an impact on its efficacy, cannot be excluded at this point.  
Regarding  serum  creatinine  levels,  no  significant  difference  was  found  between  the  two  treatment 
groups. This means that formally the co-primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was not met. This was due 
to the fact that renal function stayed equally stable over time on average in both treatment arms, and 
hence superiority of febuxostat over allopurinol (as postulated in the correspondingly planned statistical 
superiority  test,  SAP)  could  not  be  demonstrated.  However,  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  the 
demonstration of superiority versus allopurinol in terms of improved control of sUA levels that is seen as 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015  
Page 52/55 
 
 
 
 
a clinically well-established surrogate endpoint for TLS and renal impairment overrules this deficiency 
from a clinical perspective. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In the FLORENCE study only 22 (6.4%) patients overall experienced adverse reactions, namely 11 (6.4%) 
patients in each treatment group. The majority of adverse reactions were either mild or moderate. 
Overall, the FLORENCE trial did not highlight any particular safety concern in addition to the previous 
experience with ADENURIC in gout, with the exception of the following three adverse reactions Left 
bundle branch block, sinus tachycardia and haemorrhage which were included in the product information. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No interaction studies have been conducted by the MAH. The Florence study has not been designed to 
deliver information about interactions and the product information has been updated accordingly. The 
MAH will closely monitor the case reports of drug-drug interactions in the next PSURs. The product 
information and RMP have been updated accordingly. 
A total of 6 (1.7%) patients experienced TESSs resulting in death and all were allocated to the febuxostat 
group, all of them were judged to be not treatment-related by the investigator. One of the fatal cases 
concerned a patient who died from myocardial ischaemia and acute cardiac failure, which was judged to 
be not treatment-related by the investigator. Based on the detailed analysis provided by the MAH of each 
fatal outcome in the FLORENCE study, a relation to the study treatment cannot be detected. However, 
currently a post marketing comparative cardiovascular safety study is ongoing (as described in the RMP) 
to clarify the cardiovascular risk profile of febuxostat vs. allopurinol (FAST). In view of the known risk for 
cardiac  arrhythmias  and  sudden  death  associated  with  TLS  the  CHMP  requested  as  a  precautionary 
measure  cardiac  monitoring  as  clinically  appropriate  during  therapy  with  febuxostat  and  the  product 
information was updated accordingly. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Febuxostat at a dose of 120mg per day is an acceptable therapeutic option in the prevention and 
treatment of hyperuricaemia in adult patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies 
at intermediate to high risk of TLS. 
It does not require dose-adjustments (i.e. for patients with renal impairment) as allopurinol does 
In the submitted phase III study: 
 - AUC sUA1-8 was significantly lower in the febuxostat group in comparison with the allopurinol group P 
<0,0001 in the intermediate risk subgroup, p=0,0313 in the high risk group). 
- A more rapid onset of action: sUA reduction through febuxostat begins on Day 2 (i.e. 24 hours after 
starting treatment vs. allopurinol requiring a minimum of 2 days), which could be beneficial for patients 
in whom chemotherapy administration cannot be delayed. 
- A significant mean sUA reduction at each time point from Day 2 to Day 8, to an extent of 1 mg/dL and 
above,  compared  with  allopurinol  was  maintained over  time.  It  is  known  that  for  every  milligram per 
decilitre (mg/dl)- increase in uric acid, the risk of TLS is increased 1.75-fold and the risk for renal events 
is increased 2.21-fold (Coiffier et alii, 2008). 
- A lower rate of treatment failures (defined as presence of two or more consecutive values of sUA missing 
or > 7.5 mg/dL) was observed as compared to allopurinol (1.7 vs 4.0% respectively). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/176388/2015

-  A  comparable  safety-profile  and  no  significant  difference  regarding  mean  change  (%)  of  serum 
creatinine from baseline to Day 8 or at any time point, when compared with allopurinol. 
-  The  oral  administration  of  febuxostat,  in  contrast  to  rasburicase  which  is  the  standard  therapy  for 
patients  at  a  high  risk  of  TLS,  but  needs  to  be  administered  intravenously.  Furthermore,  rasburicase 
cannot be used in patients with G6PD deficiency. 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
As  the  risk  of  TLS  and  renal  events  is  known  to  increase  for  every  mg/dl  increase  of  sUA  and  since 
febuxostat provided a mean sUA reduction of at least 1 mg/dL compared to allopurinol in the course of the 
trial,  febuxostat  is  expected  to  provide  better  control  of  sUA  levels  (and  thereby  lower  the  risk  of 
TLS-consequences, e.g. renal damage) in patients undergoing chemotherapy, as compared to allopurinol. 
In the Florence study one of the fatal cases concerned a patient who died from myocardial ischaemia and 
acute cardiac failure, which was judged to be not treatment-related by the investigator A post marketing 
cardiovascular safety study (FAST) with febuxostat and allopurinol as comparator is being conducted to 
clarify the cardiovascular risk profile of Febuxostat vs. allopurinol (as described in the RMP). In view of the 
vulnerability  of  the  new  target  population  and  the  risk  for  cardiac  arrhythmias  and  sudden  death 
associated with TLS cardiac monitoring as clinically appropriate should be carried out during febuxostat 
treatment (as described in the product information). 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The Phase III pivotal study showed that febuxostat was superior over allopurinol in terms of reduction of 
sUA (a well-established surrogate endpoint for TLS and renal impairment), in patients undergoing 
chemotherapy for Haematological Malignancies (HM) at intermediate to high risk of TLS. Moreover, 
results of this trial provide evidence that febuxostat is effective in preserving renal function.  
The efficacy profile of febuxostat is maintained regardless of baseline hyperuricaemia (sUA level >7.5 
mg/dL), creatinine level, type of HM, ECOG PS score and TLS risk grade as confirmed by the exploratory 
analyses performed in subpopulations of patients with different baseline characteristics. A significantly 
higher sUA reduction compared to allopurinol is achieved after only 24 hours, which is a relevant factor in 
the prevention of urate-nephropathy, especially in patients in whom chemotherapy cannot be delayed. 
On the whole, efficacy analyses provided clear evidence for a benefit of febuxostat over allopurinol in 
terms of control of sUA level throughout the whole treatment period while preserving renal function. 
Furthermore, as the risk of TLS and renal events is known to increase for every mg/dl increase of sUA and 
since febuxostat provided a mean sUA reduction of at least 1 mg/dL compared to allopurinol in the course 
of the trial, febuxostat is expected to provide better control of sUA levels (and thereby lower the risk of 
TLS-consequences, e.g. renal damage) in patients with intermediate and high risk TLS undergoing 
chemotherapy, as compared to allopurinol. 
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy profile of febuxostat is maintained in terms of reduction of sUA in 
both, patients with intermediate and high risk of TLS. The reduction of sUA is deemed to be an established 
surrogate endpoint for TLS. Looking at the creatinine levels, it can also be concluded that the renal 
function in patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematological malignancies is preserved in both, 
patients with intermediate and high risk of TLS. The FLORENCE trial did not highlight any particular safety 
concern in addition to the previous experience with ADENURIC in gout, with the exception of the following 
three adverse reactions Left bundle branch block, sinus tachycardia and haemorrhage which were 
included in the product information.

The benefit-risk balance of febuxostat for the prevention and treatment of hyperuricaemia in adult 
patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies at intermediate to high risk of Tumor 
Lysis Syndrome is considered positive. 
In addition, the CHMP considered that the MAH should submit the following safety data in the next PSUR:

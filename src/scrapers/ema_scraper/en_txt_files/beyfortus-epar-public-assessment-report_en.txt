1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant AstraZeneca AB submitted on 28 January 2022 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Beyfortus, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: “Beyfortus is indicated to immunise infants from 
birth entering their first Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) season for the prevention of RSV lower 
respiratory tract disease.” 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content  
The legal basis for this application refers to Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and 
independent application.  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0296/2021 the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) including a deferral and the 
granting of a (product-specific) waiver applying to the paediatric population from 2 years to less than 
18 years.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0296/2021 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.4.2.  Derogation(s) from market exclusivity 
Not applicable.

1.5.  Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
1.5.1.  Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
1.5.2.  New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance nirsevimab contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
1.6.  PRIME 
Beyfortus (nirsevimab) was granted eligibility to PRIME on 31-01-2019 in the following indication: 
Prevention of lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
1.  RSV is the most important cause of LRTI in infants worldwide. Available prophylaxis options in 
the EU and worldwide are currently limited and targeted to some high-risk paediatric age 
subgroups. Therefore, an unmet need can be agreed in a broader population including healthy 
pre-term infants where the data has been generated so far.  
2.  Data on preclinical activity, both in vitro and in vivo, have been provided in support of the 
proof of principle.  
3.  Data from the presented phase 2b showed that a single intramuscular dose of 50 mg yielded a 
relative risk reduction in the incidence of medically attended RSV confirmed LRTI through D151 
of 70,2% [52,4-81,3%, p<0.0001]  
4.  Similar results were observed using 2 different statistical methods and subgroup analyses 
showed consistent results.  
5.  Therefore, the overall data can support both proof of principle and proof of concept  
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, Mark Ainsworth was appointed by the CHMP as rapporteur and 
was later replaced by Thalia Marie Estrup Blicher. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 24 June 2019. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the 
development programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to 
address the following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures:  
6.  Data from analytical comparability study to support the change from vial to prefilled syringe; 
7.  Exposure-response and Population PK modelling and simulation plan; 
8.  Extrapolation plan to support extending the efficacy and safety data in preterm and term 
infants to the target palivizumab eligible population; 
9.  Plans for post-authorisation measures; 
10. engagement with HTA bodies/EUnetHTA including engagement prior to the start of Phase 3 
studies.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped RNA virus and the principal pathogen responsible for 
LRTI in infants and young children. All infants, including healthy infants born at term, are at risk for 
severe RSV LRTI with primary RSV infection in infancy. Respiratory syncytial virus LRTI is the most 
common reason for admission to hospital in infants < 1 year of age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 9/138 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Based on global estimates from 2015, an estimated 33 million episodes of RSV-associated LRTI occur 
in children < 5 years of age, with 3.2 million episodes necessitating hospitalisation. Approximately 
59600 in-hospital deaths are estimated for this age group, of which 43600 are reported in lower-
middle income countries. Whilst the mortality rate due to RSV infection is low in high-income countries, 
the inpatient disease burden is high, with the highest burden occurring in young infants. 
Respiratory syncytial virus is the principal pathogen responsible for LRTI in infants and young children, 
estimated to cause up to 90% of childhood bronchiolitis and up to 40% of paediatric pneumonias (Hall 
2001). In infants < 1 year of age, mean hospitalisation rates for RSV infection in the USA were 16 
times higher than rates for influenza viral infections. Among German children 0 to 3 years of age, RSV 
hospitalisation rates were found to be 4 and 9 times greater than the hospitalisation rates associated 
with parainfluenza and influenza viral infections, respectively. 
All infants, including healthy infants born at term, are at risk for severe RSV LRTI with primary RSV 
infection in infancy. Respiratory syncytial virus LRTI is the most common reason for admission to 
hospital in infants < 1 year of age (Hall 2001, 2012, Murray et al 2014, Rha et al 2020). The majority 
of infants admitted to hospital with RSV LRTI were born at term, and have no underlying serious 
comorbidity as illustrated with data from England in Figure 1 (Murray et al 2014). This observation is 
further supported by data series from Europe and North America (Bont et al 2016, Hall 2012, Murray 
et al 2014, Rha et al 2020). The burden of RSV disease is focused on the first year of life. Average 
annual RSV-coded admission rates ranged from 8.6 to 22.3 per 1000 children aged < 1 year across 7 
European countries studied (namely Denmark, England, Finland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, and 
Scotland), whereas in children aged 1 to 4 years, rates ranged from 0.2 to 2.24 per 1000 children. 
Admissions peaked in the second month of life but were considerable throughout infancy (Reeves et al 
2020). Comparable rates and patterns were derived from a systematic review of epidemiological 
studies in North America and Europe: annual hospitalisation rates for RSV-associated acute respiratory 
infections in the first year of life ranged from 3.2/1000/year to 42.7/1000/year and decreased with 
increasing age to 0.6/1000/year to 1.78/1000/year in children aged 1 to 4 years (Bont et al 2016). Of 
note, the reported rates of RSV-associated hospitalisation varied considerably between studies and 
across seasons within the same study (Bont et al 2016). 
Whilst the hospitalisation burden is focused in young infants, the outpatient burden is considerable and 
extends throughout the first year of life (Forster et al 2004, Hall et al 2013, Lively et al 2019). Disease 
that is managed in the outpatient setting is almost as severe as that observed in the hospital setting 
with laboured respiration in 73% and 85% of children with office or emergency room visits, 
respectively (Hall et al 2009). In a study in the USA, it was estimated that RSV accounted for 18% of 
emergency room visits and 15% of outpatient visits for acute respiratory infections in children < 5 
years of age during the RSV season (Hall et al 2009). In England, among children < 5 years of age, 
overall 16% of all general practitioner consultations for acute respiratory illness throughout the year 
were attributed to RSV (Cromer et al 2017).  
The socioeconomic costs from paediatric RSV infection on family and workplace productivity are also 
high. Among working parents of infants < 1 year of age hospitalised for RSV studied in Canada, 
Finland, and the USA, mean absenteeism ranged from 49% to 73%, and mean overall work 
impairment ranged from 78% to 81% (Heikkinen et al 2017, Mitchell et al 2017, Pokrzywinski et al 
2019). 
Controlling RSV disease in infants may have added benefits that may become apparent in the long 
term. Infant RSV LRTI has been associated with long-term respiratory morbidity (eg, wheezing, 
asthma, and impaired lung function in adult life). Long-term studies that have prospectively followed 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 10/138 
 
 
 
cohorts from infancy until childhood have suggested an association with increased incidence of 
subsequent wheezing episodes and/or development of asthma in subjects with a history of RSV 
bronchiolitis in infancy (Escobar et al 2013, Pérez-Yarza et al 2007, Romero et al 2010, Ruotsalainen et 
al 2010, Sigurs et al 2005). 
RSV LRTI Seasonality 
Respiratory syncytial virus occurs in largely predictable annual epidemics worldwide. In Europe, whilst 
RSV transmission is active from October to May (ie, approximately Week 40 to Week 20), the majority 
of disease is typically focused in the 4 months of December through to March (ie, approximately Week 
49 to Week 12) (Li et al 2019, Obando-Pacheco et al 2018). In the majority of countries, the start, 
end, and/or peak of RSV activity usually differed by only 1 to 3 weeks from season to season (Table 
1) (Obando-Pacheco et al 2018). These seasonal peaks lead to intense pressure on health care 
services and in particular paediatric intensive care beds. 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 11/138 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1 RSV Seasonality Description per European Country 
This predictable pattern of annual RSV epidemics is illustrated across European countries for recent 
years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 1). Unusually, RSV activity dramatically declined 
during the 2020/2021 season, as COVID-19 mitigation measures impacted RSV circulation. As 
exposure decreased there was a consequent increase in the susceptible population of infants and 
children who did not have the typical level of exposure during the COVID-19 restrictions. 
Epidemiological models predicted that this increase in RSV susceptibility would affect the timing and 
increase the severity of future RSV incidence (Baker et al 2020). Such off-season outbreaks have 
occurred widely (CDC 2021a, 2021b, Ujiie et al 2021, van Summeren et al 2021, Williams et al 2021).

Page 12/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 Respiratory Syncytial Virus Activity in Europe, Wek 40 2016 to Week 20 2021, 
across 17 European Countries  
Seasonal surges in RSV infection, potentially compounded by unseasonal increases in the incidence 
and severity of RSV disease due to COVID-19 mitigation measures, place intense pressure on primary 
care, emergency department, and paediatric critical care services (ACPRC 2021). In data from Europe 
and North America for infants < 2 years of age hospitalised with RSV, the median length of hospital 
stay ranged from 2 to 12 days, with approximately 2% to 12% of infants admitted to the intensive 
care unit (Bont et al 2016).  
Based on National Health Service England analysis of Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network data 
from 2011 to 2015, annual demand for paediatric intensive care peaked in November and December 
largely driven by unplanned admission due to respiratory infection such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia 
primarily in infants < 1 year of age (NHS 2017). This can be impactful, leading to the delay of elective 
surgery in children. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped non-segmented negative-sense single stranded RNA 
virus that belongs to the family of Paramyxoviridae. Its name is derived from the large cells known as 
syncytia that form when infected cells fuse. 
RSV replication initially occurs in the epithelial cells of the nasopharynx, from where it may spread into 
the lower respiratory tract. 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 13/138 
 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Respiratory syncytial virus LRTI is a potentially serious and life-threatening disease characterised by 
infection and inflammation of the alveoli and bronchioles. It is associated with necrosis and sloughing 
of the epithelium of the small airways, with oedema and increased secretion of mucus. This can lead to 
airway obstruction and a typical clinical picture of hyperinflation, atelectasis, and wheezing (Hall 2001). 
It is most severe when the disease occurs in the first year of life associated with smaller airway 
diameter in infants. Known factors increasing the risk of hospitalisation with RSV include male sex, age 
under 6 months, crowding, siblings, and daycare exposure (Bont et al 2016). Some infants with 
serious underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of severe disease, including prematurity, CLD, CHD, 
cystic fibrosis, neuromuscular conditions, Down syndrome, or immunocompromise (Kristensen et al 
2012). Lung immaturity, impaired vascular or pulmonary function, inability to clear secretions, or 
immunocompromise can all exacerbate the pathophysiology of RSV LRTI increasing the severity of the 
disease (Chaw et al 2020a, Chaw et al 2020b). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Management of RSV infection as an outpatient is essentially supportive with the maintenance of 
hydration. Inpatient treatment of RSV infection in an infant who has been hospitalised may include 
oxygen supplementation, nasal CPAP or HFNC therapy, or mechanical ventilation, depending on the 
severity of disease (eg, hypoxaemia, respiratory failure) (Baraldi et al 2014, Turnham et al 2017). 
Bronchodilators and corticosteroids have not shown a benefit for the management of RSV bronchiolitis 
and, therefore, are not recommended (NICE 2021). 
The only approved treatment for severe RSV disease is ribavirin for inhalation, licensed in several EU 
countries, the United Kingdom, and the USA (EMA 2018b, Medicines Complete 2021, PHE 2021, 
Virazole PI 2019). It is a synthetic guanosine nucleoside analogue that inhibits RSV replication and 
needs to be initiated early in the course of the disease. Ribavirin has a number of limitations, including 
the need for prolonged aerosol administration, potential toxic effects among exposed healthcare 
personnel, and cost. More importantly, efficacy has not been established due to limited clinical study 
data (Hoover et al 2018), and its use is not recommended. It is evident that improved modes of 
therapy are needed for children with serious RSV illness. 
Prevention of RSV illnesses in all infants is a major public health priority (Giersing et al 2019). Whilst 
non-pharmaceutical interventions may temporarily reduce RSV incidence, as observed in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, they are not a sustainable long-term preventive approach. Despite more than 
60 years of attempted vaccine development (Ruckwardt et al 2019), there is no licensed vaccine. The 
only currently approved prophylaxis for RSV is palivizumab (Synagis; USA authorisation 1998, EU 
authorisation 1999), licensed only for infants who are at the highest risk for severe RSV disease (ie, 
preterm infants born at ≤ 35 wGA under 6 months of age at the start of the RSV season, children < 2 
years of age with CLD of prematurity or hemodynamically significant CHD) (Synagis PI 2020, Synagis 
SmPC 2021). Palivizumab is a humanised RSV mAb directed against the F protein of RSV (Johnson et 
al 1997). With a half-life of approximately 1 month, palivizumab must be administered monthly (IM 
injection) throughout the RSV season. The burden of monthly healthcare visits during the season can 
be a barrier to compliance, diminishing the benefits of palivizumab (Wong et al 2018). National 
recommendations for use are more restrictive. As palivizumab is indicated only for use in the relatively 
small population of higher-risk infants, its effect on limiting the total disease burden of RSV infection is 
limited.

2.2.  About the product 
Nirsevimab is a fully human, anti-RSV neutralising monoclonal antibody (IgG1/kappa isotypes for the 
heavy/light chains), isolated from memory B cells from human donors.  
It binds to a discontinuous epitope displayed by the native, quaternary structure on the apex of the 
prefusion conformation of the F protein (F protein residues 62-96 and 196-212, within antigenic site Ø, 
site zero). Site Ø is lost as the F protein transitions to the post-fusion conformation, i.e. nirsevimab is 
specific for the pre-fusion state of F (McLellan 2013 and 2015, Zhu 2017, Swanson 2014).  
Nirsevimab was engineered with 9 aminoacid substitutions to increase affinity for the F protein and 
reduce antigenicity, and a triple amino acid substitution (YTE) in the Fc region to extend serum half-
life. Binding to human Fc receptors is maintained, and the mAb is expected to exhibit normal Fc-
mediated effector functions (complement activation, mediation of phagocytosis, antibody-mediated 
killing of virus-infected cells, etc). 
The mAb exhibits neutralising activity against both RSV subtype A and B strains, by locking the F 
protein in the pre-fusion conformation, thereby inhibiting entry of free virions into cells, as well as 
inhibiting spread of cell-associated virus by cell fusion. The mAb does not inhibit attachment of virions 
to cells. This mode of action is similar to the mode of action for palivizumab (palivizumab targets 
epitope site II, binds pre- as well as postfusion conformations of the RSV F protein, and likely 
neutralizes virus by sterically inhibiting the cell fusion step).  
Contribution of Fc-mediated effector functions to protection against RSV disease cannot be ruled out 
(in the opinion of the rapporteur, the preclinical data from the cotton rat model appears ambiguous as 
regards this; see report ID8897-0031 and Zhu 2017). 
The prefusion form of F is the main target for the virus-neutralizing antibody responses generated by 
natural RSV infection in humans (Magro 2012, Ngwuta 2015), and mAbs against prefusion-specific 
antigenic sites (e.g. Ø and V) have been found to exhibit higher in vitro neutralization potency than 
mAbs against antigenic sites which are shared between the pre- and postfusion conformations of F 
(McLellan 2013 and 2015, Zhu 2017).  
The mechanism by which the YTE Fc mutation extends serum half-life is known (increased binding to 
neonatal Fc receptor, allowing rescue and recycling of mAbs from lysosomal degradation) and the YTE 
modification is employed in several marketed mAbs. Also, engineering for increased binding affinity 
and reduced antigenicity is standard in the mAb field (Zhu 2017). 
In short, nirsevimab exhibits the biochemical and mode-of-action characteristics expected for a 
second-generation anti-RSV mAb intended for long-acting prophylaxis against RSV disease. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on:  
“There is an unmet medical need in the prevention of RSV infections in infants that have no risk 
factors. For the infants with risk factors, palivizumab is indication for the prevention of RSV infection. 
The burden of the disease is acknowledged, both in terms of inpatient and outpatient resources spent 
on the disease. 
The clinical development program seems appropriate for the accelerated assessment procedure and no 
major gaps were identified.” 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 15/138 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, it has been sufficiently demonstrated that nirsevimab constitutes a major interest from the 
point of view of public health and from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Nirsevimab, the active substance in Beyfortus, is a recombinant neutralising human immunoglobulin 
G1 kappa (IgG1κ) long-acting monoclonal antibody binding to the prefusion conformation of the 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) protein to prevent the infection of human cells by RSV.  
Nirsevimab finished product is a sterile, preservative-free, solution for intramuscular injection. It is 
supplied as a single-dose pre-filled syringe (PFS) in two strengths: 50 mg (in 0.5 mL solution) and 100 
mg (in 1 mL solution). Nirsevimab is formulated with L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride, L-arginine 
hydrochloride, sucrose, polysorbate 80 (PS80) and water for injections (pH 6.0). 
The PFS is presented without needle at the time of placing Beyfortus on the market. The needles are 
either co-packaged or provided separately. 
Beyfortus is proposed in packs of 1 or 5 PFSs for each strength. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Nirsevimab is composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains.  
Nirsevimab targets a different site of the RSV F-protein compared to palivizumab in Synagis 
(EMEA/H/C/257). Nirsevimab binds to a region within antigenic site Ø on prefusion RSV F and this 
binding site does not overlap with the binding site targeted by palivizumab (antigen site A). 
Nirsevimab has been modified with a triple amino acid substitution (YTE) in the Fc region, enhancing 
its affinity to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and thus extending serum half-life.  
There is a single N-linked glycosylation site in each heavy chain located within the CH2 domain of the 
Fc constant region (Asn-306). Glycosylation is predominantly of complex type. 
The molecular weight of nirsevimab is approximately 150 kDa including glycosylation. 
Nirsevimab is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing process and process controls 
Nirsevimab is manufactured and QC tested at AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Frederick in USA. All 
sites involved in the manufacture, control and storage of the cell banks and the active substance 
operate in accordance with EU GMP.  
Nirsevimab is manufactured using a CHO cell line. A comprehensive process flow and description of the 
manufacturing process has been provided. The commercial process is standard for manufacturing of 
monoclonal antibodies, with inoculation and expansion of cells from a well-characterised working cell 
bank (WCB), cultivation, harvest and purification. The active substance is stored until further 
processing to finished product.

Control of materials 
The generation of the nirsevimab cell substrate and master cell bank (MCB) and WCB establishment 
has been adequately described. The chosen cell line was expanded and stored as the research cell 
bank (RCB). Vials from the RCB were tested for the presence of bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, and virus 
contamination, and no contaminating microorganisms or viruses were detected. 
MCB, WCB and end-of-production cell bank (EOPCB) and limit-of-in-vitro-cell-age (LIVCA) cell bank 
have been prepared and tested for identity, purity and safety in accordance with ICH Q5A, Q5B and 
Q5D and the CHMP guidance on Virus Safety Evaluation of Biotechnological Investigational Medicinal 
Products. No bacterial, microplasma, fungi or viral contamination has been detected in the cell banks. 
All test methods for cell bank identity, purity and safety testing have been briefly described and results 
have been provided. Tests for bacteriostasis and fungistasis, mycoplasma and sterility are conducted 
according to current compendial methods. Non-compendial analytical methods were evaluated to 
ensure that appropriate controls are incorporated into the assay. The methods were confirmed to be 
suitable for the characterisation of the cell banks. Genetic and phenotypic stability of the cell banks 
have been analysed, confirming that the cells can stably express nirsevimab during culture after MCB 
thaw. 
All raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process, including cell banking and cell 
culturing are purchased from Quality-approved suppliers. Upon receipt supplier certificates of analysis 
are reviewed and materials are inspected, tested and released according to specifications.  
No material of human origin was used in host cell culture, cell line development, banking of the MCB 
and WCB, or in active substance manufacturing. No material of animal origin was used in cell line 
development or cell banking after this. Certificate of analysis, certificate of origin and TSE certificate 
equivalent information has been submitted and is found acceptable. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical process parameters (CPPs), Non-CPPs (NCPPs), in-process controls (IPCs) and performance 
attributes have been listed for each process step with acceptable limits, ranges or action limits for each 
parameter. In general, the acceptable ranges for CPPs and NCPPs have been validated in verified 
small-scale studies for each manufacturing step. Some acceptable ranges have not been assessed in 
the small-scale studies for nirsevimab manufacturing but are instead based on previous process 
characterisation results of other CHO cell lines used by the Applicant. This approach for setting 
acceptable ranges is acceptable. Microbial control is ensured throughout the down-stream active 
substance manufacturing process by control of bioburden and endotoxin at all steps with defined action 
limits, in addition to the microbial and viral IPC performed at the production bioreactor stage. As for 
the bioburden test method, the endotoxin test method has been product-specifically validated. A low-
pH treatment virus inactivation step and a virus filtration step are part of the active substance 
manufacturing process to ensure clearance of any potential viral contamination. Effectiveness of these 
steps have been verified in acceptable viral clearance studies. 
A short description of components in and preparation of cell culture medium and nutrient feeds has 
been provided, along with qualitative composition of the culture mediums, nutrient feeds and buffers 
used during cell culture and active substance manufacturing. The medium used for inoculum expansion 
and production and the nutrient feed are either filtered into pre-sterilised containers for storage or are 
filtered directly into the bioreactors. 
Process validation 
Three active substance batches of have been manufactured for active substance process validation 
(PV). The process parameters and process outputs of all three batches were within the predefined 
validation acceptance criteria. 
A small-scale hold time study has been conducted, using samples of process intermediate from the 
three PV batches stored in small-scale containers.  
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 17/138 
 
 
 
Results from microbial challenge studies have been provided to demonstrate effective sanitisation of 
resins, and small-scale studies support the proposed resin lifetimes. Commercial scale studies are on-
going to verify the number for cycles established in the small-scale studies which is acceptable.  
Bubble point and microbial retention have been validated, confirming suitability of the filter for the 
intended use. Filter compatibility and extractable evaluation have been adequately assessed. 
A shipping qualification study, including thermal qualification, distribution qualification, performance 
qualification and microbial integrity study has been conducted and is acceptable. The studies confirm 
that the containers used for active substance storage  can maintain product temperature for the entire 
shipping duration and can withstand the physical rigors of shipping. Finished product manufactured 
from active substance included in the shipping qualification study was tested according to the proposed 
finished product release specification and were within specification limits. 
Manufacturing process development 
A severity assessment has been conducted to identify critical and non-critical quality attributes (CQAs 
and Non-CQAs) of the nirsevimab manufacturing process. Severity scores have been calculated for 
each quality attribute (i.e. product-related impurities, process-related impurities, product-related 
substances, and specification test parameters) based on the attribute’s impact on clinical performance 
(biological activity, PK, safety, and immunogenicity) and uncertainty regarding the information on the 
attribute.  
Process characterisation studies were performed using scale-down models that were verified to predict 
the performance of the commercial-scale process. These studies determined the impact of the process 
parameters on product quality, resulting in their classification as CPPs or NCPPs. This approach for 
defining CPPs and setting acceptable ranges is considered acceptable. 
The commercial control strategy is based on a systematic risk assessment using Failure Mode and 
Effects Analysis (FMEA). Each quality attribute is evaluated with regard to severity (impact on safety if 
the attribute if not well controlled), occurrence (likelihood that a quality attribute will be outside of its 
appropriate limit or range) and detectability (ability to identify whether a quality attribute is outside of 
its appropriate limit or range). Finally, a detectability score is added depending on the ability to test 
each quality attribute. The combined risk prioritisation number (RPN) (severity x occurrence x 
detectability) indicates whether the individual quality attribute is well controlled and thus does not 
pose a risk to patients.  
The defined CQAs for nirsevimab and the identified CPPs are considered acceptable; Overall, the 
proposed control strategy is considered adequate to ensure that the CQAs are maintained within their 
defined acceptable limits or ranges. 
From the provided data, the comparability of the nirsevimab active substance, manufactured according 
to the different processes is supported.  
It is evaluated that there is a low risk for leachables from the product-contact materials used in active 
substance manufacturing based on vendor-provided extractable data, and that no individual leachables 
would exceed the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC). 
Characterisation  
Overall, the structural and physiochemical characterisation of nirsevimab active substance is 
considered comprehensive and sufficient. 
The characterisation studies include release testing using the proposed commercial release analytical 
methods and extended characterisation methods to assess the primary, secondary and higher order 
structure, as well as post-translational modifications. Physiochemical characteristics have also been 
addressed; the molecular weight has been confirmed and the extinction coefficient has been 
determined. The biological and immunological characteristics of nirsevimab have been sufficiently 
addressed. Based on characterisation of ADCC and CDC activity, it is considered demonstrated that 
effector function is not part of the mechanism of action (MOA) for nirsevimab. The MOA for nirsevimab 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 18/138 
 
 
 
is neutralisation. The Fab domains of nirsevimab bind to the pre-fusion conformation of the RSV F 
protein, neutralises the RSV, and thereby prevents RSV infection and infection-induced cell death. 
Furthermore, nirsevimab active substance was subjected to stressed conditions to understand 
degradation pathways and identify changes in the molecule upon exposure to stress conditions. 
Degradation pathways and the predominant degradation products have been identified. The Applicant 
has combined the knowledge gained on degradation pathways/products with experience from 
manufacturing and/or storage and has selected variants for further assessment of criticality.  
Structural characterisation 
Primary structure  
The primary structure and composition of nirsevimab was confirmed. 
Disulfide bonding pattern  
Nirsevimab contains a total of 16 disulfide bonds, which is consistent with the expected structure of an 
IgG1 molecule. Further the identity of the disulfide linked peptides was confirmed; all predicted 
disulfide linked peptides were observed and no unexpected disulfide linkages were detected.   
Higher Order Structure 
The secondary structure of nirsevimab was investigated. The spectrum of nirsevimab showed a profile 
consistent with predominantly beta-sheet structures structure, as expected for a typical IgG molecule. 
Based on deconvolution analysis spectrum, the major secondary structure elements are β-sheets, β-
turns, random coil, and α-helix. The spectrum showed features typical of an IgG molecule; a dominant 
antiparallel β-sheet band, smaller features corresponding to β-turns, and a minor side chain band. The 
spectrum and indicate that nirsevimab is in a folded state with a defined secondary structure. 
Tertiary structure was investigated.  
Size heterogeneity  
The size distribution profile of nirsevimab was evaluated. 
Post translational modifications 
Carbohydrate Structure  
The glycosylation of nirsevimab was characterised  
Isoform pattern 
The charge distribution profile of nirsevimab was evaluated  
Biological activity and immunological characteristics 
The biological properties of nirsevimab including potency, Fcγ receptors binding, FcRn binding, and Fc 
effector functions have been characterised. 
Product-related substances/impurities 
Product variants are categorised as a product-related substance or product-related impurity based on 
their potential impact on safety and efficacy.  
Product-related impurities detected in the active substance and finished product are formed during 
manufacturing and/or under forced degradation conditions.  
Fragments 
Nirsevimab fragmentation was measured using several orthogonal techniques. 
Process-related impurities 
The safety risk due to process-related impurities was found to be minimal.

All stated impurities have been presented in product used in clinical studies. 
Residual HCP and HCP assay development 
Throughout clinical development and process validation, the levels of HCP in the Active substance were 
monitored. The Applicant has included a short description of the characterisation of the HCP assay.  
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Specifications 
The proposed active substance release and shelf-life specifications for nirsevimab have been provided,  
The parameters included in the active substance release and shelf-life specification are found adequate 
to control the quality of the nirsevimab. 
Justification of specification 
The selection of the attributes included in the active substance specification is based on the overall 
control strategy presented. Nirsevimab product quality attributes were evaluated for potential impact 
on safety and efficacy to determine their severity. Severity was then considered along with occurrence 
and detectability to determine the control strategy for each attribute. For attributes for which the 
control strategy includes active substance and finished product release and stability testing, 
acceptance criteria have been established. The acceptance criteria for active substance and finished 
product were established using a combination of approaches. Overall, the selection of specification 
attributes and setting of the acceptance criteria are found in line with ICH Q6B and are acceptable.  
Change during finished product manufacturing 
In cases where formulation characterisation studies show an impact for a given quality attribute within 
the ranges allowed for a given formulation parameter, the acceptance criteria may be set to 
accommodate these ranges in routine manufacturing. 
Analytical procedures  
The analytical procedures are described in sufficient detail. System suitability criteria are specified 
where relevant and the acceptance criteria have been confirmed during validation of the methods. The 
system suitability criteria are found adequate to confirm that the methods are in control during routine 
testing. 
Validation of analytical procedures 
The compendial analytical procedures for the active substance are performed in accordance with the 
methods described in the relevant pharmacopoeia current at the time of testing. The compendial 
procedures for Appearance/Clarity and Colour, Osmolality and pH were verified to be suitable for use.  
The applicant has provided validation overviews as well as validation reports for the non-compendial 
methods. The method applied both for the active substance and finished product are validated using 
active substance samples. This is accepted since the composition of the active substance and finished 
product are identical, no additional formulation or compounding steps is part of the finished product 
manufacturing process. The non-compendial analytical methods have been appropriately validated 
according to ICH Q2 to control nirsevimab.  
Batch analysis  
The batch data overall confirm batch-to-batch consistency and process comparability. Low levels of 
both product and process related impurities are observed in all batches.

Reference standard 
A two-tiered reference standard system, with a primary reference standard (PRS) and a working 
reference standard (WRS), will be implemented for nirsevimab. Currently, the PRS, is used for routine 
active substance and finished product release and stability testing. A WRS will be introduced for use in 
routine testing according to the provided protocol.  
Current PRS 
The preparation, qualification, characterisation, storage and monitoring of the currently applied PRS 
has been described in sufficient detail.  
Future reference standards 
A short description of the preparation, qualification, storage and monitoring of the future PRS and WRS 
has been provided.  
Container closure 
Nirsevimab active substance is filled into container closure system and stored. The active substance is 
shipped frozen from the active substance manufacturing site to the finished product manufacturing 
site.  
The Applicant has assessed the suitability of the for its intended use as an active substance storage 
container with regards to: protection of the active substance from environmental exposure and 
shipping stress, safety of the components of the container closure system, compatibility of the active 
substance with the container closure system, and further the performance of the container closure 
system.  
The Applicant has evaluated the safety by extractables and leachables studies.  
The container closure is appropriate for storage of nirsevimab active substance. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The proposed active substance shelf life is stated for the long-term storage condition. Long-term 
stability studies are on-going for three manufacturing process validation active substance batches.  
Stability data for three active substance validation batches manufactured with the commercial 
manufacturing process at long-term and accelerated conditions are provided for The stability data was 
evaluated against the proposed commercial acceptance criteria. The data for the long-term stability 
study show that the batches meet specification acceptance.  
The post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment are acceptable. The batches included in 
the study will be tested according to the active substance shelf-life specification.  
Taken together, the stability studies are designed in accordance with ICH Q5C Stability testing of 
biotechnological/biological products.  
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development

the fill equipment capability. Target fill volumes are applied which is acceptable. There is no overage of 
the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the finished product. The finished product formulation contains 
100 mg/mL nirsevimab in L-histidine/L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, L-arginine hydrochloride, 
sucrose, PS80, pH 6.0.  
An acceptable description of the finished product and the composition of both 50 mg/PFS and 100 
mg/PFS has been provided. All excipients are of compendial grade. No novel excipients or excipients of 
human or animal origin are used.  
Pharmaceutical development 
Appropriate documentation was provided to support formulation and manufacturing process 
development of Beyfortus finished product. 
Container closure 
The intended commercial primary packaging components consist of a PFS clear and colourless 
borosilicate Type I glass barrel with a polycarbonate Luer Lock adapter closed at one end with a tip cap  
and at the other end with an elastomer plunger stopper. Two device secondary packaging components 
which do not contact the finished product solution are attached to the PFS: a plunger rod is threaded 
into the plunger stopper, and a backstop is attached to the syringe to provide additional support and 
leverage during manual injection. 
The glass barrel is Type 1 glass (compliant with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1) with silicone oil (compliant with Ph. 
Eur. for “Dimeticone”) on the inner surface. The elastomer plunger stopper is qualified according to Ph. 
Eur. 3.2.9. Both the syringe with tip cap and the plunger stopper are supplied ready-to-use and pre-
sterilised in accordance with ISO standards (further information on sterilisation of the PFS is provided 
in section P.7).  
Both the syringe with tip cap and the plunger stopper are supplied ready-to-use and pre-sterilised. The 
syringe is sterilised using ethylene oxide and tested according to Ph. Eur. 2.6.1; the plunger stopper is 
sterilised by gamma irradiation and tested according to relevant ISO standard with a validated test 
method. 
The PFS is packed in a paperboard carton to protect the finished product from light exposure.  
Container closure integrity (CCI) has been validated during finished product process validation. All 
units tested met acceptance criteria.  
Extractables and leachables from the PFS were analysed. It is evaluated that there is very low risk for 
leachables from the PFS. 
The two needles co-packed in some of the packaging configurations are made of stainless steel and 
polypropylene. The needles are covered with silicone oil on the exterior part of the needle for comfort 
during insertion. It has been adequately justified that the collective amount of silicone to which the 
patient is exposed during one dose injection does not exceed PDE limit for silicone.  
An extractable study has been conducted on the polypropylene needle hub and the stainless steel 
needle separately. Compatibility of the needles with the PFS has also been studied to ensure no 
leakage between the PFS and needle when pressure is applied. A valid declaration of conformity and a 
valid CE certificate for the needles has been provided.

Manufacturing process characterisation 
Each step of the finished product manufacturing process has been evaluated through a Process Failure 
Mode and Effects Analysis (pFMEA) to determine the impact of each process parameter on the product 
quality. No impact to relevant CQAs was observed for the initial steps of the manufacturing process; 
filtration flow rate over the sterile filter and vacuum stoppering pressure applied during the PFS 
stoppering were defined as CPPs as they are essential for microbial product safety. The proven 
acceptable ranges for each process parameter have been adequately validated. 
Sensitivity to light exposure and room temperature of the active substance/finished product during 
manufacture was evaluated to be within acceptable ranges at worst case conditions when compared to 
light protected control samples. 
All product contact material used in finished product manufacturing have been evaluated for 
extractables and leachables. No leachables above the TTC for genotoxic impurities described in ICH M7 
for products administered less-than-lifetime were detected. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturing process and process controls 
Batch release in the EEA is performed by AstraZeneca AB, Gärtunavägen, SE-151 85 Södertälje, 
Sweden. All sites involved in finished product operations comply with EU GMP.

The finished product manufacturing process standard for monoclonal antibodies. It consists of thawing 
of active substance, pooling, mixing, bioburden reduction filtration, sterile filtration and aseptic filling 
and stoppering of the PFS. The filled PFSs are 100% visually inspected.  
Each step of the finished product manufacturing process has been adequately described.  
The commercial control strategy and the FMEA risk assessment presented in the active substance 
section covers the entire nirsevimab manufacturing process and all quality attributes of nirsevimab, i.e. 
both active substance and finished product. The control strategy, including the defined CPPs and IPCs 
for both active substance and finished product were evaluated and are found acceptable.  
Process validation 
The finished product manufacturing process has been validated at the commercial manufacturing site. 
All CPPs and IPCs were within their acceptable ranges. The results were comparable between batches 
and between filling time point within each batch. Media fill qualifications were also performed at the 
finished product manufacturing site and are found acceptable. 
After the bioburden reduction filtration the filtered finished product can be held prior to the sterile 
filtration. The in-process hold time) has been validated. 
Overall, the finished product process validation is considered acceptable. Defect categories were 
explained and internal action limits are provided. It is clarified that PFSs with both critical and non-
critical defects are discarded. 
All product-contact materials are single-use, therefore no cleaning validation has been performed. 
Description and documentation for validation of product contact material sterilisation (gamma 
irradiation) performed by the vendors of the materials has been provided. The sterile filter has been 
validated with regards to rinsing and product bubble point, compatibility with finished product, 
microbial retention and extractables from the filter. All results support the suitability of the sterile 
filter.

2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
Specifications  
The proposed finished product release and shelf-life specifications for nirsevimab finished product have 
been provided. Overall, the parameters included in the specification are found adequate to control the 
quality of the nirsevimab finished product.  
The general approach for selection of the attributes included in the finished product specification is 
based on the overall control strategy. The approach for setting of the acceptance criteria is holistic 
considering both the active substance and finished product release and stability acceptance criteria and 
the approach is described in the active substance part of the dossier. The overall approach for selection 
of specification attributes and setting of the acceptance criteria are found in line with ICH Q6B and are 
acceptable.  
Analytical procedures  
The analytical procedures specific to the finished product are described in sufficient details. Information 
on the reference standards are included where relevant. System suitability criteria are specified where 
relevant and the acceptance criteria have been confirmed during validation of the methods. The 
system suitability criteria are in general found adequate to confirm that the methods are in control 
during routine testing. 
The compendial analytical procedures for the active substance are performed in accordance with the 
methods described in the relevant pharmacopoeia applicable at the time of testing. The compendial 
procedures were verified to be suitable for use. The method for Bacterial endotoxins was verified The 
method for sterility was verified for use with the finished product demonstrating the product is not 
bacteriostatic or fungistatic.  
The Applicant has provided validation overviews as well as validation reports for the non-compendial 
methods specific for the finished product; The method applied both for the active substance and 
finished product are validated using active substance samples. The non-compendial analytical methods 
have been appropriately validated according to ICH Q2 to control nirsevimab finished product. 
 Characterisation of impurities 
The finished product formulation is identical to the active substance formulation and no additional 
formulation or compounding step take place as part of the finished product manufacturing process. No 
new impurities are generated during the finished product manufacturing process and all impurities 
observed in the finished product were characterised for the active substance. 
In accordance with ICH Q3D guideline for elemental impurities, a risk assessment has been conducted 
on the manufacturing process and container closure of the active substance and finished product. The 
elemental impurity risk assessment has confirmed that the existing control measures for nirsevimab 
active substance and finished product manufacture adequately control the levels of metal impurities to 
below 30% control threshold of the PDE limits. Based on this it is acceptable that no new measures to 
further control elemental impurities in the nirsevimab manufacturing process are established. 
The nirsevimab manufacturing process has been evaluated for nitrosamines risk, based on risk factors 
for biologicals. Based on the risk evaluation the Applicant has determined the risk of nitrosation or the 
presence of nitrosating reagents during the active substance or finished product manufacturing to be 
very low. It is agreed that the nitrosamines risk can be considered negligible for the nirsevimab and no 
additional testing is considered necessary.  
Leachables risk Assessment for active substance manufacturing has been provided. No risk was found 
for the combined active substance and finished product processes.

with ICH guidance. Overall, the manufacturing process is considered adequately described and the 
applied process parameters and IPCs, as well as their ranges, and the control of starting materials are 
considered adequate to control the process and ensure formation of active substance of adequate and 
consistent quality. The approach taken to validate nirsevimab manufacturing process is considered 
adequate. The process is demonstrated to perform consistently and nirsevimab active substance meets 
all the biochemical, functional and microbiological acceptance criteria. The process development, 
including development of the control strategy, is overall considered adequately described and justified.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Nirsevimab (also known as MEDI8897) is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) of approximately 150 kDa that binds the prefusion conformation of the 
RSV F protein. Nirsevimab was derived from a human mAb D25 that was isolated directly from human 
B cells and binds the prefusion conformation of the RSV F protein in site Ø. The similar mAB, IG7 was 
also derived from D25 by optimizing for RSV neutralisation activity against RSV A and RSV B strains in 
vitro and differs only slightly from nirsevimab in the protein sequence, as nirsevimab contains a 3 
amino acid substitution, M257Y/S259T/T261E, referred to as “YTE” in the heavy chain CH2 fragment 
crystallizable (Fc) region of the mAb. The YTE modification was added to the mAb to prolong the 
terminal half-life of the antibody in humans, though the modification significantly decreases antibody 
exposure in rodents resulting in decreased serum antibody levels relative to the native human Fc. 
Therefore, the parental molecule, 1G7, was utilized for nonclinical pharmacology studies conducted in 
rodents. As nirsevimab and its parental mAb 1G7 exhibit equivalent in vitro antiviral activity in cell 
culture both were studied in the non-clinical pharmacology studies included in the Marketing 
Authorisation Application. 
GLP:  
Safety pharmacology investigations as well as the pivotal toxicity studies were conducted in an OECD 
member country and in general appeared to be GLP compliant. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In an antibody competition study, it was confirmed that nirsevimab/1G7 and D25 bind to the same 
region within antigenic site Ø on prefusion RSV F. None of the mAbs that bind to previously 
characterized RSV F binding sites I (131-2A), II (palivizumab), and IV (133-1H) competed with the 
binding of biotinylated 1G7 to RSV-infected HEp-2 cells, confirming the specific binding to site Ø. It 
was also shown that 1G7 binds to both RSV subtype A2 and B9320 F protein with high affinity. The 
binding site of nirsevimab on RSV A or B is primarily composed of residues 62–69 in the F2 subunit and 
residues 196–212 in the F1 subunit. Further, genotypic analysis identified critical residues associated 
with ≥5-fold significant reduction of viral susceptibility to nirsevimab neutralisation in RSV A F 
(residues K68 and N208) and RSV B F (residues K68, N201, I206, and N208) proteins. 
To identify the mechanism of antiviral activity of nirsevimab, two in vitro studies were conducted to 
assess the inhibition of entry and spread of recombinant RSV A2 using human airway epithelial (HAE) 
tissues. It was shown that by binding to the prefusion RSV F protein, nirsevimab inhibits the essential 
membrane fusion step in the viral entry process, neutralising the virus and blocking cell-to-cell fusion 
in HAE tissues with in vitro potencies 10- and 20-fold higher than palivizumab, respectively. The 
improvement in neutralisation potency exhibited by nirsevimab/1G7 was furthermore documented in a 
microneutralisation assay in HEp-2 cells against D25 and benchmark mAbs palivizumab and 
motavizumab, which showed that 1G7 is approximately 4-fold more potent than D25 and 20- and 150-
fold more potent than motavizumab and palivizumab, respectively, against RSV A and B laboratory 
strains in vitro, confirming that binding site Ø elicits a more potent response that e.g. binding site II 
for palivizumab. When tested in vitro in a panel of 70 RSV A and 49 RSV B clinical HEp-2 cell isolates, 
1G7 neutralized all viruses tested across the most common RSV F sequence polymorphisms found

among currently circulating strains, demonstrating a highly potent and broad antiviral activity 
(calculated median EC50 values of 3.2 ng/mL (range, 0.48 to 15 ng/mL) and 2.9 ng/mL (range, 0.3 to 
59.7 ng/mL) against RSV A and B isolates, respectively).  
Nirsevimab/1G7 also exhibits binding to Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs; FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, or 
FcγRIIIA-158V) on innate immune cells in vitro and based on the article by van Erp et al, 2019, it was 
theorized that an Fc-mediated antibody effector function response may be involved in limiting virus 
replication and spread in vivo. However, in an in vitro microneutralizing study against laboratory 
strains RSV A2 and B9320, it was demonstrated that the antiviral activity of nirsevimab, 1G7 and a 
modified version of 1G7 with reduced FcγR binding and effector function (1G7-TM) were similar, 
showing that the YTE modification in nirsevimab does seem not affect binding affinity or neutralisation 
activity as compared to 1G7 or 1G7-TM. This was further demonstrated in vivo in a cotton rat model of 
RSV infection, as it was shown that 1G7 and 1G7-TM exhibited comparable dose-dependent reduction 
in RSV replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates, further suggesting that protection from RSV 
infection is dependent on nirsevimab neutralisation activity rather than Fc-mediated effector function. 
Contribution from FcγR-binding and effector function on neutralization activity can however not 
completely be ruled out.  
In Zhu et al, 2017, the antiviral activity of 1G7 was investigated in vivo by administering 1G7 i.m. at 8 
different dose levels to cotton rats 1 day prior to challenging with RSV A2 or RSV B9320 strains at 
doses up to 3 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg, respectively. Palivizumab were evaluated in parallel experiments. 
1G7 potently inhibited viral replication, also significantly more potently than palivizumab. Further, 1G7 
was highly active in reducing viral titers in the noses or nasal turbinates of infected cotton rats, 
whereas palivizumab failed to inhibit viral replication in the upper airways even at high doses. It was 
also demonstrated in vivo that 1G7 is 9-fold more potent in reducing pulmonary viral loads by >3-logs 
yielding a 90% protection (EC90) in RSV A- and RSV B-infected cotton rats compared to palivizumab. 
A target serum concentration of 6.8 µg/ml of nirsevimab was estimated based on the calculated EC90 
value, to ensure optimal protection against RSV in patients. 
Antiviral resistance was investigated in vitro in cell culture of RSV A2 and B9320 strains to identify 
amino acid changes that could lead to possible viral escape from nirsevimab neutralization. Analysis of 
F protein sequences from RSV A and B variants revealed several natural polymorphisms, which were all 
located in the nirsevimab binding site AA 62-69 and 196-212, for which one unique RSV A variant and 
6 unique RSV B variants were identified, indicating that RSV B appears to have a faster mutation rate 
than RSV A. Investigations of the binding kinetics of 1G7 to RSV A2 or B9320 pre-F protein containing 
the resistance-associated substitutions showed a correlation between antibody binding and virus 
neutralisation, suggesting that the primary mechanism of viral resistance is linked to amino acid 
changes which prevent or weaken antibody binding. All identified variants exhibited significantly 
reduced susceptibility to nirsevimab neutralization in vitro (ranging from 412- to > 125000-fold). 
Though the development of antiviral resistance raises some concern, the Applicant was able through 
surveillance virology studies to demonstrate that the identified nirsevimab resistance-associated 
substitutions were only rarely identified among RSV isolates collected since 1956.  
For RSV A as well as B subtypes, F protein polymorphisms reducing the in vitro neutralization potency 
of nirsevimab were rare in circulating strains (< approx. 1.3% in global sequences), and these 
potentially concerning strains were detected only sporadically, with no evidence for increased 
frequency over time. It also appears that nirsevimab neutralisation escape variants does not have 
altered growth properties compared to parental strains in vitro, and as previously described, the RSV F 
protein appears to be well preserved, and data in general supports that nirsevimab can be expected to 
exhibit activity against most currently circulating RSV strains (both A and B subtypes).  
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 28/138 
 
 
 
To evaluate the antiviral resistance in vivo of a specific polymorphism, cotton rats were administered 
1G7 (0.3 to 6 mg/kg) and palivizumab i.m. 1 day prior to challenging with recombinant RSV B9320 
harbouring K65Q:S211N in the nirsevimab binding site. It was shown that both 1G7 and palivizumab 
exhibited dose-dependent antiviral activity in preventing RSV replication in the lungs of cotton rats 
infected with RSV B9320 harbouring K65Q:S211N, however, IG7 exhibited an approximate 4.4-fold 
reduced potency at inhibiting viral replication compared to RSV B9320. Thus, it was shown that the 
reduced potency observed in vitro due to amino acid changes in the nirsevimab binding site is 
translatable to reduced in vivo efficacy in cotton rats. Currently, it is not known what impact the 
potential neutralization escape RSV variants may have on treatment of patients regarding prophylactic 
protection, though based on in vivo non-clinical data it is expected that some reduction in potency will 
occur, which should be monitored closely in the clinic. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacology studies were conducted by the applicant as nirsevimab is directed against 
a viral target that is not endogenously expressed in healthy animal or human tissues. In tissue cross-
reactivity studies in a full panel of adult human tissue and adult cynomolgus monkey tissues as well as 
in a panel of selected juvenile, neonatal and fetal human tissues no cross-reactivity binding occurred. 
Thus, due to the specificity of the exogenous antigen target (RSV prefusion F protein), unintended 
immunological reactions are not expected. 
A high concern for the development of vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) exists for all new 
RSV vaccines. This is a result of a series of clinical trials conducted in the 1960s, evaluating a formalin-
inactivated (FI) RSV vaccine in RSV-naïve infants, for which enhancement of the RSV disease was 
observed, which resulted in a higher rate of hospitalization and death among infants compared to the 
control group. RSV disease enhancement was only observed after pre-treated naïve infants were 
subsequently infected with RSV for the first time. Subsequent evaluations identified low ratios of 
neutralizing and fusion-inhibiting activity to total anti-RSV-F binding antibody among vaccinees as well 
as peribronchiolar monocytic infiltration and prominence of eosinophils (Browne et al, 20201). 
A variant of VAED termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease and infection has been 
observed in connection with antibody-based vaccines against for example Dengue and Zika viruses and 
is suspected to potentially also occur in connection with RSV viruses. The in vivo mechanisms of ADE 
are largely unknown, however, in investigations of Dengue vaccines, ADE has been associated with 
antibodies with poor neutralising activity that bind heterotypic virions without achieving neutralisation, 
potentially resulting in an increased ability of the opsonized viral particle to infect Fcy-R-bearing cells 
(i.e. facilitated entry), thus enhancing infection and disease. In in vitro and animal models, a peak 
enhancement titer (i.e., a specific concentration of antibodies that most efficiently enhances Dengue 
virus infection) has been observed (Munoz et al, 20212). By contrast, higher antibody concentrations 
effectively neutralize virions, whereas sub-therapeutic concentrations elicit no effect. Besides the role 
of level of neutralization (antibody titers) in development of ADE, it has also been pointed out by van 
Erp et al (2019) that, Fc-mediated effector function may have a role in ADE of RSV disease, through 
either cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis (ADCP) or complement activation. It is therefore important to 
investigate both the neutralization activity and the Fc-mediated effector function when evaluating the 
potential for ADE of an RSV vaccine agent (van Erp et al, 20193). Thus, the applicant has provided

additional in vitro data assessing the capability of nirsevimab and palivizumab to induce antibody-
dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD), 
antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) and antibody-dependent NK cell activation 
(ADNKA). Nirsevimab slightly induced ADNP and ADNKA and to a greater extend ADCP and ADCD, in a 
comparable range as palivizumab. However, no known cases of enhanced RSV disease in clinical 
studies and post-marketing surveillance of palivizumab were reported. Animal models have however 
identified antibody response patterns that are associated with low risk of VAED including a high ratio of 
neutralizing vs. antigen binding antibodies anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies of high 
affinity (nanomolar range), and antibody kinetics showing sustained IgG responses over time (Munoz 
et al, 2021). 
The risk for antibody-dependent enhancement of disease was explored in a cotton rat model of 
disease. The applicant showed that 1G7 did not induce viral titers above those measured for the 
control group over the range of doses tested, including at the lowest doses of 1G7 of 0.125 mg/kg for 
RSV A2 and 0.03125 mg/kg for RSV B9320. In a subsequent study in cotton rats, the impact of 1G7 on 
the development of anti-RSV immune memory and a subsequent immune response was investigated 
after re-challenge with RSV A2 virus following complete clearance of 1G7 after the initial dosing. It was 
shown that the immune memory and anti-RSV neutralizing antibody titers induced by the first 
challenge were fully protective against detectable RSV replication in the lungs or nasal turbinates of all 
animals. Thus, it appears that 1G7 efficiently neutralizes the viral load of RSV in vivo (EC50, RSV A2 = 
2.9 µg/mL; EC50,RSV B9320 = 5.6-5.8 µg/mL) and that none of the tested dose levels of 1G7 appear 
to enhance the viral titers in vivo. To substantiate that the effect of nirsevimab is independent of Fc-
mediated effector function, the Applicant carried out in vitro and in vivo studies in cotton rats. In vitro, 
it was demonstrated that nirsevimab binds with differing binding affinities to FcγRI (8.94 nM), FcγRIIA 
(18.7 µM), FcγRIIB (530 µM), or FcγRIIIA-158V (CD16; 16.7 µM). In vivo in cotton rats, no difference 
was observed in efficacy of 1G7 and 1G7-T, a mAb with reduced Fc effector function, which leads the 
Applicant to conclude that Fcγ-binding likely plays a minor role in protection from RSV virus. Finally, 
the Applicant informs that no unanticipated worsening of RSV has been observed in the clinical trials to 
date. Though histopathological evaluations of lung tissue were not conducted in cotton rats, which 
could have provided further information on the potential occurrence of alveolitis with (neutrophilic) 
infiltrates, which is an acknowledged marker of ADE in the cotton rat model, the overall weight of 
evidence presented by the Applicant indicates a low risk of ADE of disease for nirsevimab. The risk of 
ADE will further be monitored in the clinic after marketing authorization and is included in the RMP.  
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
In accordance with ICH guidelines S6(R1) and S7A no stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were 
performed. 
Based on the one-month repeat-dose GLP toxicologic study in cynomolgus monkeys there were no 
clinical signs nor microscopic findings indicating any nirsevimab-related effects on the central nervous 
or respiratory systems and there were no adverse treatment-related effects on qualitative or 
quantitative ECG parameters. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Due to the specificity of nirsevimab targeting the exogenous RSV prefusion F protein, it is accepted 
that no studies investigating pharmacodynamic interactions are submitted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022

2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Method of analysis 
The ELISA methods developed to measure nirsevimab and anti-nirsevimab antibody (ADA) in 
cynomolgus monkey serum in support of the GLP pivotal toxicological study has been suitably validated 
to GLP. The method measuring nirsevimab was validated across the concentrations ranging from 
0.50 to 32.00 µg/mL. Validation of the ADA assay demonstrated that ADA levels of>62.5 ng/mL were 
detectable in the presence of 10 μg/mL of nirsevimab and in the presence of 100 μg/mL nirsevimab, 
ADA levels of 500 ng/mL were reproducibly detectable, which is acceptable as serum concentrations of 
nirsevimab were >500 µg/mL. Incurred sample reproducibility is found to comply with guidelines in the 
assessed pivotal study and the accuracy and precision of within-run and between-run values is 
acceptable and in line with relevant guidance (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2). 
Furthermore, dilution integrity and minimum required dilution (MRD) as well as stability during freeze 
thaw cycles was sufficiently addressed. Serum samples containing nirsevimab are stable during 5 
freeze-thaw cycles at -80º C, 20 hours at room temperature, and up to 7 days refrigerated while anti-
nirsevimab antibody samples are stable during 5 freeze-thaw cycles at ≤-70º C, 20 hours at room 
temperature, and up to 7 days refrigerated. Long-term stability sufficiently demonstrated for 
nirsevimab in serum samples, demonstrates stability for 374 days. Long-term stability was not 
investigated for ADA to nirsevimab in cynomolgus monkey serum quality control samples as it was 
indicated that the long-term stability of antibodies in serum at ≤-20º C is generally well documented. 
It is acknowledged that recommendations on antibody stability testing is in general lacking. However, 
with reference to the available body of data on long-term stability of ADA, it is accepted that 
immunoglobulins are generally considered stable for several years when maintained under controlled 
storage conditions, i.e. ≤-20º C (Myler H et al, 20224). Therefore, no further specific information on 
the long-term stability of anti-nirsevimab antibodies in serum samples is required. The ELISA method 
developed for detection of nirsevimab in cynomolgus monkey nasal wash samples (study 1468-038) is 
considered suitably qualified and supports a quantitative range of 50 to 6400 ng/mL nirsevimab. 
Further, the ELISA method for detection of nirsevimab, MEDI-524  and MEDI-557 in cynomolgus 
monkey serum, nasal wash and BAL  samples (non-GLP, study 20089726) is considered suitably 
qualified. 
Absorption 
Toxicokinetics after single and repeat i.m. dosing with nirsevimab was investigated as part of the 1-
month repeat-dose GLP study in cynomolgus monkeys. The study showed that over the dose range of 
50 mg/kg i.v. to 300 mg/kg i.v., nirsevimab exhibited linear and dose proportional TK after the first 
i.v. dose, but TK exposure increased in slightly less than dose-proportional manner after the last (5th) 
weekly dose on Day 29. Only minor accumulation was observed from first to fifth dose. Mean Tmax was 
observed approximately 2.3 days following administration of 300 mg nirsevimab i.m. after the first dose. 
Mean t1/2 was 40.45 and 39.91 days, following administration of 300 mg/kg i.v. and 300 mg i.m., 
respectively. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was observed in the high dose groups administered 300 
mg/kg i.v. (2/3 animals) and 300 mg i.m. (2/3 animals) only during the recovery phase. In 2 of the 4 
animals that tested positive for ADA (1 in 300 mg/kg i.v. and 1 in 300 mg i.m.),  serum concentrations 
declined faster while PK in the other 2 animals remained unimpacted. In general, there were no 
significant gender differences, however, in the recovery groups, males had slightly higher exposures 
compared to females in the 300 mg/kg i.v. group and females had slightly higher exposures in the 300 
mg i.m. group as compared to males, probably due to ADA. Given the long half-life, steady-state 
concentrations were not achieved within the dosing period of 28 days in this study. As a result, steady-
state parameters such as CLss, Vz and Vss were not reported.

Standard tissue distribution studies with nirsevimab have not been conducted, which is considered 
acceptable in accordance with ICH S6 for mAbs. Lung biodistribution in male cynomolgus monkeys (5 
male animals/group) following i.v. administration was however investigated for nirsevimab in 
comparison to two other human IgG1κ mAbs, MEDI-524 (motavizumab) and MEDI-557 (YTE 
modification of motavizumab), both targeting the A epitope of the F glycoprotein of RSV, in order to 
benchmark the distribution of nirsevimab. All three mAbs were detected in nasal wash (NW) samples at 
24 hours and 72 hours and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples at 72 h in all  animals dosed with 
the respective compounds, however, high individual variability was observed. In general, nirsevimab 
concentrations were lower than the comparator mAbs, though absolute mean concentrations of 
nirsevimab in NW were within 2- to 3-fold of the comparator mAbs at 24 hours and within 2- to 7-fold 
at 72 hours, while the absolute mean concentrations of nirsevimab in BAL were within 1- to 2-fold of 
the comparator mAbs. The mean concentration ratios of  nirsevimab in NW samples compared to 
nirsevimab serum concentrations was  approximately 1:10000. 
Metabolism and excretion 
In accordance with ICH S6 it is acceptable that no dedicated metabolism or excretion studies have 
been conducted. Nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody and therefore its expected metabolism is 
degradation to  small peptides and amino acids that is eliminated through the intrinsic clearance by the 
reticuloendothelial system in the same way as that for an endogenous IgG. No renal excretion is 
expected for nirsevimab since the molecular weight is higher than the glomerular filtration. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
It is considered acceptable that no nonclinical studies investigating pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
have been submitted due to the specific mode of action of nirsevimab, which is not likely to impact 
expression levels of metabolic enzymes such as cytochrome P405 enzymes. It is furthermore not 
considered likely that metabolism of nirsevimab is affected by concomitant medication as nirsevimab is 
likely degraded via normal protein catabolism which is not dependent on cytochrome P405 enzymes. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The non-clinical safety programme consisted of a 1-month repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus 
monkeys and tissue cross-reactivity studies in human tissues (adult, juvenile, neonatal and foetal 
tissues). The antigen for nirsevimab (RSV F protein) is not endogenously expressed in humans or 
monkeys. Therefore, use of cynomolgus monkeys as the relevant animal species for the non-clinical in 
vivo program of nirsevimab is endorsed based on the comparable affinity of nirsevimab to human and 
cynomolgus FcRn and the fact that the YTE substitution decreases antibody exposure in rodents. 
Furthermore, it is supported that in the absence of adverse local or systemic effects of nirsevimab and 
in the absence of cross-reactivity with human tissues, additional non-clinical studies to support the use 
of nirsevimab in the proposed patient population were considered not necessary. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No dedicated single-dose studies were performed. Single-dose toxicity was evaluated as a part of the 
one-month repeat study in cynomolgus monkeys and no adverse local or systemic effects of 
nirsevimab were observed based on clinical observations and clinical pathology. This is considered 
acceptable. In general, single-dose studies are not recommended. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
A repeat-dose toxicology study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys to evaluate the potential 
toxicity of nirsevimab (study No 1468-038). The pivotal toxicity study was stated to be GLP-compliant 
with the exception of the nasal wash analysis according to the GLP compliance statement. However, it 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 32/138 
 
 
 
 
was also noted that the formulation analysis and clinical pathology report were not conducted 
according to GLP. Apart from these discrepancies, the study was considered to be in compliance with 
GLP. 
In the 4-week toxicity study with a 25-week recovery period once weekly i.v. or i.m. administration (5 
doses total) of nirsevimab of 0, 300 mg/kg/week i.v. or 0 and 300 mg/kg/week i.m (6 
monkeys/sex/group) or 50 mg/kg/week i.v. to (3 monkeys/sex/group) led to no adverse local or 
systemic effects of nirsevimab through recovery (3 monkeys/sex/group) to necropsy on Day 169.  
Minor nirsevimab-related findings at terminal necropsy on Day 31 included minimal increases in 
globulin (males at 300 mg/kg, i.v.) that were not associated with effects on other clinical pathology or 
microscopic endpoints. These findings were considered test article-related but were not associated with 
effects on leukocytes and had no microscopic correlates, hence they were not regarded as biologically 
relevant. They may have been in-part related to the presence of the test article which is an 
immunoglobulin. In the recovery period (Days 57 to 169), globulin values continued to be mildly 
increased in males receiving 300 mg/kg i.v. and were also statistically increased in the 300 mg i.m. 
group. These observations similarly did not have other correlative findings suggesting these were 
biologically relevant effects. Microscopic changes in the spleen (red pulp macrophage 
hypertrophy/hyperplasia) were noted at the terminal necropsy in some animals (one female and two 
males receiving 300 mg i.m.). This microscopic finding is commonly seen with the administration of 
foreign proteins to monkeys and may be related to the clearance of antibodies from circulation. The 
NOAEL was considered to be the top dose of 300 mg/kg/week i.v. and 300 mg/week i.m. 
Toxicokinetics from the 1 month repeat dose study in monkeys were assessed in the PK section. 
Interspecies comparison data was presented as a comparison of exposures over a 1-month treatment 
period in cynomolgus monkeys and human infants and adults. Based on the NOAEL of 300 mg/week 
i.m. calculated safety margins for a dose of 50 mg i.m. for infants weighing <5 kg and 100 mg i.m. for 
those weighing ≥5 kg entering their first RSV season was 44-fold based on Cmax and 8-fold based on 
AUC. Given that the toxicity profile did not differ between i.m. and i.v. routes in the cynomolgus 
monkey, safety margins were also calculated for the NOAEL of 300 mg/kg/week i.v. which was 118-
fold based on Cmax and 18-fold based on AUC. A relative low safety margin (8-fold) was noted 
observed at a dose of 50 mg i.m. for infants weighing <5 kg and 100 mg i.m. for those weighing ≥5 
kg. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
The lack of genotoxicity studies is acceptable in accordance with ICH guideline S6(R1). 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Nirsevimab binds a non-endogenous viral-specific target that is not expressed in non-clinical models or 
in humans, and is intended for intermittent clinical use. Thus, in accordance with ICH guideline S6(R1) 
the omission of carcinogenicity studies is considered acceptable. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In accordance with ICH guideline S6(R1), no dedicated studies have been conducted to evaluate the 
effects of nirsevimab on fertility, embryo-foetal, and prenatal and postnatal development. Nirsevimab 
binds a viral-specific target that is not expressed endogenously in non-clinical models or in humans, 
and the intended clinical population (infants and children) does not include women of childbearing 
potential. In addition, nirsevimab did not show any adverse effects on reproductive tissues in the 
repeat-dose toxicity study (study No 1468-038) and did not bind to any evaluated human reproductive 
tissues (including placenta) in the tissue cross-reactivity study (study No 20046491). 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 33/138 
 
 
 
In the absence of adverse local or systemic effects of nirsevimab and in the absence of cross-reactivity 
with human tissues the omission of dedicated non-clinical fertility, embryo-foetal and prenatal and 
postnatal development studies is supported. 
The currently available clinical and non-clinical safety data are considered sufficient to support the 
planned paediatric development and registration of nirsevimab. Although the current indication 
includes very young children, the nature of the target and therapeutic modality and knowledge from 
conducted non-clinical studies, a juvenile study is not expected to provide any added value. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics from the 1 month repeat dose study in monkeys were assessed in the PK section. 
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance after i.v. and i.m. injection was assessed as a part of the 1-month repeat-dose study in 
monkeys. Injection sites were evaluated for erythema/eschar and oedema changes according to the 
dermal Draize score. There were no nirsevimab-related signs of local irritation in the non-clinical 
studies conducted. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
The translational value of ADA formation in animal models are limited. Nevertheless, formation of ADA 
was assessed based on data from the 1-month repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys with a 25-
week recovery period. None of the animals in the control or treated groups tested positive for ADA at 
any time point during the treatment phase. ADAs to nirsevimab was only observed in the recovery 
period and in a limited number of animals (four (22.2%) of the recovery animals). Although it is 
unclear what effect ADAs had on the TK, sufficient exposures appear to have been achieved. 
There was no evidence of potential nirsevimab-related immunotoxicity in parameters evaluated. The 
lack of dedicated immunotoxicity studies was considered acceptable. 
In contrast to centrally active small molecules, available data suggests that monoclonal antibodies, as 
a drug class, are unlikely to cause dependence. Consistent with ICH guideline M3(R2) the absence of 
studies to evaluate the potential for nirsevimab abuse or misuse is accepted.  
Nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody and expected to be fully metabolized into small peptides and 
amino acids via catabolic pathways in the body. Therefore, the absence of studies to determine 
metabolites is accepted. 
No concern was identified with regard to impurities. 
Tissue cross-reactivity of nirsevimab was assessed by immunohistochemical methods in a GLP-
compliant study using a full panel of frozen human tissues from normal human donors (study No 
20046491). Results revealed no staining with nirsevimab, and therefore, no tissue cross-reactivity was 
observed. 
Tissue cross-reactivity of nirsevimab was determined by immunohistochemical methods in a GLP-
compliant study against cryosections of selected juvenile, neonatal and foetal human tissues (study No 
20060018). Results revealed no staining with nirsevimab, and therefore, no tissue cross-reactivity was 
identified against a panel of normal human juvenile, neonatal and foetal tissues. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has provided an acceptable justification for not conducting a full Environmental Risk 
Assessment. Since nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody with effect on the prefusion conformation of 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 34/138 
 
 
 
the respiratory syncytial virus F protein, it is expected to be fully metabolized into small peptides and 
amino acids via catabolic pathways in the body with negligible excretion of intact, biologically active 
protein. In accordance to the guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*), nirsevimab is therefore 
considered to be no particular hazard to the environment and no special precautions in terms of use 
and disposal are needed.  
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The pharmacology of nirsevimab was thoroughly described in the provided non-clinical package and no 
other concerns has been raised. The non-clinical documentation shows that nirsevimab efficiently binds 
to the prefusion conformation of the RSV F protein in binding site Ø with high affinity and inhibits the 
essential membrane fusion step in the viral entry process, neutralizing the virus and blocking cell-to-
cell fusion, which has been shown both in vitro and in vivo in a cotton rat model of disease. Several 
polymorphisms of RSV subtype A and B were identified. However, it was shown that the occurrence of 
the polymorphisms is rare and that nirsevimab can be expected to exhibit activity against most 
currently circulating RSV strains (both A and B subtypes). The Applicant performed in vitro and in vivo 
studies to investigate the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease, and the 
documentation is considered sufficient. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of nirsevimab are well described.  
Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of nirsevimab was characterized in a 1-month repeat-dose toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys and two tissue cross-reactivity studies in human tissues (adult, juvenile, 
neonatal and foetal tissues). The antigen for nirsevimab (RSV F protein) is not endogenously expressed 
in humans or monkeys. Therefore, the use of cynomolgus monkeys as the relevant animal species for 
the non-clinical in vivo program of nirsevimab is endorsed based on the comparable affinity of 
nirsevimab to human and cynomolgus FcRn and the fact that the YTE substitution decreases antibody 
exposure in rodents. Furthermore, it is endorsed that in the absence of adverse local or systemic 
effects of nirsevimab and in the absence of cross-reactivity with human tissues, additional non-clinical 
studies to support the use of nirsevimab in the proposed patient population were considered not 
necessary. All pivotal non-clinical safety studies were performed according to the principles of GLP, 
appropriate ICH guidelines and were in line with Scientific Advice given on March 2019.  
In the 4-week toxicity study with a 25-week recovery period once weekly i.v. or i.m. administration (5 
doses total) of nirsevimab to monkeys, up to and including 300 mg/kg i.v. or 300 mg i.m. dose levels, 
was not associated with any treatment-related adverse effects both locally and systemically. Thus, the 
NOAEL was considered to be 300 mg/kg/week i.v. and 300 mg/week i.m. Calculated safety margins for 
a dose of 50 mg i.m. for infants weighing <5 kg and 100 mg i.m. for those weighing ≥5 kg was 44-fold 
based on Cmax and 8-fold based on AUC. Given that the toxicity profile did not differ between i.m. and 
i.v. routes in the cynomolgus monkey, safety margins were also calculated for the NOAEL of 300 
mg/kg/week i.v. which was 118-fold based on Cmax and 18-fold based on AUC. A relative low safety 
margin (8-fold) was noted for a dose of 50 mg i.m. for infants weighing <5 kg and 100 mg i.m. for 
those weighing ≥5 kg, however, this did not give rise to concern considering that it was established at 
the top dose level at which no safety signals were observed. 
Tissue cross-reactivity results showed no staining of any normal human adult, juvenile, neonatal and 
foetal tissues as expected given the target for nirsevimab was a non-endogenous viral-specific target. 
In accordance with ICH guideline S6(R1) no genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were conducted. 
In the absence of adverse local or systemic effects of nirsevimab and in the absence of cross-reactivity 
with human tissues the omission of dedicated non-clinical fertility, embryo-foetal and prenatal and 
postnatal development studies is supported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 35/138 
 
 
 
No concern regarding local tolerance, antigenicity, immunotoxicity, dependence, metabolites and 
impurities were identified. 
ERA 
The active substance is considered a natural substance (as a protein), the use of which will not alter 
the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, nirsevimab is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
An adequate program of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology was conducted for nirsevimab, including a 
disease model, supporting the intended clinical use of nirsevimab. Non-clinical proof of concept as an 
antibody-mediated prophylactic treatment for the prevention of RSV seems established.  
Pharmacokinetics of nirsevimab is well described.  
Overall, the toxicology program of nirsevimab revealed no major concerns. The toxicity studies 
supporting the market authorization of nirsevimab to immunise infants from birth entering their first 
RSV season for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease were performed according to 
appropriate ICH guidelines, taking into consideration the nature of the product being a monoclinal 
antibody directed at a foreign target. Intravenous or i.m. administration of nirsevimab to monkeys in 
GLP repeat-dose toxicity study was not associated with any treatment-related adverse effects both 
locally and systemically. For the proposed indication in the paediatric population, the safety margin for 
nirsevimab was 8-fold based on AUC. Nirsevimab was not considered to be genotoxic. No concern 
regarding reproductive and developmental toxicity, local tolerance, antigenicity, immunotoxicity, 
dependence, metabolites and impurities were identified. Tissue cross-reactivity results with nirsevimab 
showed no staining of any human tissues tested, neither adult, paediatric nor fetal tissues. Nirsevimab 
is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
In conclusion, the non-clinical part of the dossier is considered approvable.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Clinical virology: 
In the three pivotal clinical studies (study 3, MELODY and MEDLEY), for children with lower respiratory 
tract infections requiring medical attention or hospitalization through 150 days post the nirsevimab 
dose, based on RSV RNA obtained from nasal swabs, RSV strains were characterized genetically as 
regards conservation of nirsevimab and palivizumab epitope sites and genotype (based on sequences 
for F and G proteins, respectively), and susceptibility to nirsevimab and palivizumab neutralization in 
vitro was examined (in vitro neutralization in HEp-2 cells using recombinant RSV viruses engineered to 
express the F proteins of clinical strains of interest). 
The documentation that the Lyra RT-PCR assay used to confirm RSV infection in children remained able 
to detect RSV strains circulating during the three pivotal clinical studies is largely satisfactory (some 
data is outstanding, and a question has been raised as to this). 
In cases where RSV breakthrough infections occurred in nirsevimab-treated children, nirsevimab 
resistance-associated substitutions in the F protein (MARMs) were seen only in study 3, at a frequency 
of 2 of the 25 breakthrough infection cases in the study. While RSV A and B subtypes contributed 
equally to the breakthrough infections (11 and 14 caused by RSV A and B subtypes, respectively), the 
2 MARM cases were both of the B subtype, and in both cases the MARMs were essentially completely 
resistant to nirsevimab neutralization in vitro (N208S >387-fold loss in neutralization potency; 
I64T+K68E+I206M+Q209R >447-fold loss in neutralization potency).  
The emergence of RSV B MARMs but not RSV A MARMs in nirsevimab-treated children is in agreement 
with the surveillance virology data and knowledge for RSV biology and the structure of the nirsevimab 
epitope: (i) Amongst naturally circulating RSV strains, the RSV B subtype exhibits a higher degree of 
polymorphism in its F protein than does the RSV A subtype, and RSV B may have a faster evolution 
rate than RSV A (Langedijk 2020 and 2021, Lu 2015, Tabor 2020, Zhu 2017, Lin 2021), and (ii) the 
nirsevimab epitope site locates to the most variable part of the F protein; Magro 2012, Ngwuta 2015, 
McLellan 2013, Mas 2018, Hause 2017).  
The Company considers that there were no signs of unusual clinical course of RSV disease in the 2 
nirsevimab-treated children experiencing breakthrough infections with RSV B MARMs, and this is of 
course encouraging.  
On the other hand, the current data from the MELODY and MEDLEY studies is not informative as 
regards the risk of emergence of MARMs, especially for the RSV B subtype where this risk is likely 
highest (for MELODY, due to preponderance of RSV A cases in the study, for MEDLEY, due to the low 
RSV infection incidence, maybe related to social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic).  
Thus, a more comprehensive picture of the risk of RSV breakthrough infections in nirsevimab-treated 
children is expected to be provided by the final reports from the MELODY and MEDLEY studies.  
Finally, the potential of nirsevimab treatment to interfere with rapid RSV antigen detection assays was 
examined (done for 5 assays employing detection mAbs targeting epitope sites I, II and IV in the F 
protein; Remel X/pect RSV test kit, Quidel QuickVue RSV test kit, Meriden True RSV test, BD Directigen 
EZ RSV test kit, and Binax NOW RSV test kit). The results were satisfactory, but information on 
whether these assays are representative for RSV diagnostics in Europe is relevant.

2.6.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
Nirsevimab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that contains YTE amino acid substitutions in the Fc 
portion of the molecule to extend serum half-life. Five clinical studies contributed data to the PK/PD 
evaluation namely studies 1, 2 and 3, and ongoing studies MELODY and MEDLEY. 
For quantification of nirsevimab in human serum, a validated ELISA based method utilising a 
monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody for capture was used. The nirsevimab assay was transferred to a 
different analytical site, optimised and re-validated to include samples from paediatric (infant) 
patients. The quantification assay was not tolerant for ADAs against nirsevimab at ADA concentrations 
>100 ng/mL. Even 100 ng/mL ADA was shown to interfere with measurement of nirsevimab 
concentrations ≤1000 ng/mL. This will be relevant for interpretation of Day365 serum concentration 
data in ADA positive subjects in the target population. Several methods were validated for detection of 
ADAs to nirsevimab (screening/confirmation), NAbs to nirsevimab and ADAs to the YTE-substitution. 
For the ADA screening methods, the drug tolerance for detection of 100 ng/mL ADA was established to 
10-12.5 µg/mL drug using goat polyclonal antibody as the positive control. The median nirsevimab 
systemic concentration falls below the 100 ng/ml ADA drug tolerance level after about 200 days 
following a 50 mg dose or after about 275 days following a 100 mg dose, thus most samples with low 
ADA titre would not be positive within 200-275 days post-dose. Drug tolerance for detection of 100 
ng/mL NAb was 62.2 ng/mL drug (method applied in study 3) or 50 µg/mL drug (method applied in 
studies MELODY and MEDLEY). One electro-chemiluminescent based assay was validated for the 
detection of anti-drug antibodies specific against the YTE domain of nirsevimab in human serum 
samples. Drug tolerance was established in the method applied in MELODY and MEDLEY to 100 ng/mL 
YTE-antibody positive control could be detected in the presence of 100 μg/mL drug. ELISA methods 
were validated for quantification of palivizumab and for detection of ADAs to palivizumab. A micro-
neutralization assay was developed for detection of anti-RSV neutralizing antibodies (RSV-NAb). A 
multiplexed ECL method for the detection of IgG antibodies specific for the pre-F, post-F, N, Ga and Gb 
antigens of RSV in human serum were also developed. 
Population PK modelling 
Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling software (NONMEM® version 7.4.3), was used for popPK modelling. 
Nirsevimab PK have previously been described by a linear 2-compartment model with variance terms 
estimated for CL and V2, based on data from studies 1, 2 and 3. IM absorption was estimated by use 
of adult IV data and modelled using a first-order rate constant. Residual error was described by a 
proportional error model. Effect of postmenstrual age (PAGE) on CL was modelled by a maturation 
function. Effect of body weight on disposition parameters was allometrically scaled with estimated 
exponents. 
Data as a result of weight-band dosing of infants in studies MELODY and MEDLEY were included 
sequentially to the previous model with data from MELODY first. The updated complete PK dataset 
included 8239 PK observations from 2643 subjects, of these were 102 adults with dense PK profiles. 
The remaining data came from sparsely sampled infants.

Figure 2 Nirsevimab Serum Concentration Versus Time by Study 
A model was first developed after inclusion of additional Study 3 data and data from MELODY. MELODY 
contributed 2539 observations from 962 healthy infants. MEDLEY contributed 1375 observations from 
592 high-risk palivizumab-eligible infants. Using the base MELODY model, data from MEDLEY was 
included followed by a new covariate analysis for the final MEDLEY Pop PK model. No parameters 
changed notably by inclusion of MEDLEY data and GoF plots and VPCs were comparable. Significant 
covariates were body weight on CL, V2, Q, and V3; postmenstrual age (maturation) on CL; race on 
both CL and V2; and ADA on CL. Weight and postmenstrual age had large impact on nirsevimab CL.

decrease in CL of 25%.

Exposure-response modelling 
A previous exposure-response analysis assessed the relationship between AUCbaseline CL and 
“medically attended RSV-confirmed lower respiratory tract infection” (MA RSV LRTI) over a 5-month 
RSV season using Cox proportional hazards modelling. Stepwise univariate covariate analysis was 
conducted to determine relevant factors or exposure metrics that were predictive of efficacy in this 
study population. Exposure evaluated as AUC quartiles was a statistically significant predictor of MA 
RSV LRTI risk. 
Efficacy (and safety) of Study 3 and MELODY were extrapolated as per approved PIP, to the MEDLEY 
palivizumab-eligible population based on PK bridging. The target exposure (AUC 12.8 day·mg/mL) was 
the upper limit of the lowest exposure quartile (Q1), based on individual data from Study 3 in which all 
infants received 50 mg IM. Efficacy was demonstrated if serum nirsevimab exposures in MEDLEY were 
at or above the target exposure in >80% of the study population throughout a 5-month period. 
Specific subgroups in MEDLEY included infants with CLD of prematurity, infants with haemodynamically 
significant CHD, and extremely preterm infants < 29 weeks GA without CLD/CHD.

stratified by study D5290C00003 AUCbaseline CL quartiles  
A Cox proportional hazards model was also estimated based on data from the proposed dose only with 
AUC quartiles as predictor. This E-R analysis included data from Study 3 (infants <5kg) and all data 
from MELODY. All AUC quartiles were significantly different from 1 (p<0.01 or p < 0.001) with point 
estimates of HR <0.3. 
Absorption  
The estimated absorption half-life following IM administration was 1.6 days, based on population PK 
analysis. Bioavailability (F) and absorption rate constant (KA) after IM administration were 85% and 
0.425 day -1, respectively, corresponding to an absorption t½ of 1.6 days, based on population PK 
analysis (note: these are defined primarily based on adult data but are assumed to be the same in 
infants). Interindividual variability on KA was 46%. 
In study 2, mean Cmax after administration of 50 mg IM in pre-term healthy subjects was 71.7 µg/ml. 
Predicted Cmax from final popPK model was 113 µg/ml. In the SmPC, no statement on Cmax is given. 
As absorption information is mainly based on adult data and predicted Cmax might be over- or 
underestimated, this is agreed. 
Distribution and elimination 
The central and peripheral volumes of distribution for a typical infant weighing 5 kg and a 
postmenstrual age of 11.1 months were 249 mL and 241 mL, respectively, based on population PK 
analysis.

Nirsevimab is a human mAb that is degraded by proteolytic enzymes widely distributed in the body. 
Nirsevimab is not metabolised by hepatic enzymes. Based on population PK analyses, the estimated CL 
for nirsevimab is 3.38 mL/day for a typical infant weighing 5 kg and a postmenstrual age of 11.1 
months. The model-predicted mean (SD) terminal elimination half-life of nirsevimab was 69 (10) days 
for infants. 
In the target population, there is a strong impact of body weight (and maturation) on volume of 
distribution and clearance. The volume of distribution in infants weighing 2.2 kg and 8.3 kg were 50% 
and 155% of that of a 5 kg infant. Clearance in infants weighing 2.2 kg and 8.3 kg were predicted to 
be 59% and 139%, respectively, of the CL in a 5 kg infant. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The PK of nirsevimab were dose-proportional following single IV doses of 300 to 3000 mg and single 
IM doses of 100 mg to 300 mg in adults. In infants, dose proportional PK was seen after single IM 
doses of 25 mg to 50 mg.

Nirsevimab is intended for one-time administration only, time dependency has not been studied. 
Interindividual variability implemented on CL, central volume, and KA, were 27%, 40%, and 46%, 
respectively. The intended population are infants and represented in 4 of the 5 studies conducted. 
Special populations 
No studies in special populations have been conducted. Covariates affecting the PK of nirsevimab were 
identified from the PopPK model. Race was identified as a statistically significant covariate on the 
clearance and central volume of nirsevimab in the population PK analysis; however, the estimated 
effects of race (independent of body weight) were generally small relative to the overall variability. 
Predicted exposures per race group for weight-band dosed infants indicated no clinically relevant 
differences between race groups. Clearance and volume of distribution increase with increase in body 
weight.  
Exposure simulations versus body weight 
Simulations were performed for the full nirsevimab serum concentration time course following a single 
dose, according to the proposed weight-band dosing regimen (ie, 50 mg dose for infants weighing < 5 
kg; 100 mg dose for infants weighing ≥ 5 kg). Models included time-varying body weight, based on 
growth curves for preterm and term infants with a minimum weight of 1 kg at the time of dosing.

Nirsevimab has been studied in adults and preterm and term infants. There is a high correlation 
between age and body weight. An effect of postmenstrual age was estimated in the population PK 
analysis. The effect of postmenstrual age (PAGE) gave an estimated 60% lower CL for a term infant at 
birth (40 weeks GA) compared to complete maturation, and a maturation t½ of 11.3 months, resulting 
in a 26% lower CL for a term infant at 12 months of age (postmenstrual age 21 months).  
Infants with CLD or CHD 
CLD or CHD were not significant covariates in the popPK model, and in MEDLEY, infants with CLD 
and/or CHD had similar nirsevimab exposure as preterm infants (Figure 12). In this study, infants 
were dosed with the proposed dose.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No DDI studies have been conducted with nirsevimab. As a mAb, nirsevimab is eliminated by 
intracellular catabolism and not primarily cleared via hepatic or renal pathways. Based on the 
mechanism of action of nirsevimab, which specifically neutralises RSV pre-F to provide protection in 
vivo (and prevent viral entry into target cells), it is unlikely that it could interfere with the immune 
response to vaccines. 
2.6.2.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Nirsevimab is a fully human, anti-RSV neutralising monoclonal antibody (IgG1/kappa isotypes for the 
heavy/light chains), isolated from memory B cells from human donors.  
It binds to a discontinuous epitope displayed by the native, quaternary structure on the apex of the 
prefusion conformation of the F protein (F protein residues 62-96 and 196-212, within antigenic site Ø, 
site zero). Site Ø is lost as the F protein transitions to the post-fusion conformation, i.e. nirsevimab is 
specific for the pre-fusion state of F (McLellan 2013 and 2015, Zhu 2017, Swanson 2014).  
Nirsevimab was engineered with 9 aminoacid substitutions to increase affinity for the F protein and 
reduce antigenicity, and a triple amino acid substitution (YTE) in the Fc region to extend serum half-
life. Binding to human Fc receptors is maintained, and the mAb is expected to exhibit normal Fc-
mediated effector functions (complement activation, mediation of phagocytosis, antibody-mediated 
killing of virus-infected cells, etc). 
The mAb exhibits neutralising activity against both RSV subtype A and B strains, by locking the F 
protein in the pre-fusion conformation, thereby inhibiting entry of free virions into cells, as well as 
inhibiting spread of cell-associated virus by cell fusion. The mAb does not inhibit attachment of virions 
to cells. This mode of action is similar to the mode of action for palivizumab (palivizumab targets 
epitope site II, binds pre- as well as postfusion conformations of the RSV F protein, and likely 
neutralizes virus by sterically inhibiting the cell fusion step).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Following administration of a single dose of nirsevimab in infants in Study 2, Study 3, and MELODY, 
dose-dependent increases in serum anti-RSV-neutralising antibody levels were seen, similar to the 
increases in nirsevimab serum concentrations. Serum anti-RSV neutralising antibody levels were 
correlated with nirsevimab serum concentrations across all dose levels. The RSV-neutralising antibody 
levels for infants passively immunised with nirsevimab decreased between days 151 and 361 but 
remained more than 5 times greater than baseline levels in subjects in both Study 3 and MELODY. 
Immune response to nirsevimab was described in terms of ADA prevalence (percentage of subjects 
who were ADA-positive at any time point during the study, including at baseline) and incidence 
(treatment-emergent ADA or percentage of subjects who were positive post baseline only or subjects 
positive at baseline with post-baseline titre increased by a factor of ≥ 4). 
Based on analyses of pooled data from the primary cohort of subjects in MELODY and Study 3 entering 
their first RSV season, who received the proposed dose of nirsevimab, 
Anti-drug antibody prevalence was 5.7% (88/1556). Treatment-emergent ADA (incidence) were 
detected in 5.6% (84/1498) of subjects with a median of the maximum titre of 200.0. 
The prevalence and incidence of neutralising antibodies to nirsevimab were 0.9% (14/1556) and 1.0% 
(14/1423), respectively. Anti-drug antibodies against the nirsevimab YTE substitution were detected 
with prevalence and incidence of 4.4% (68/1556) and 4.8% (68/1423), respectively. The majority of 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 55/138 
 
 
 
 
nirsevimab-treated subjects who had positive ADA results were positive only 361 days post baseline 
(and not at 151 days). 
Anti-drug antibody results were generally comparable between subgroups (term/preterm, weight, 
CHD/CLD). On Day 361, serum nirsevimab concentrations were generally lower in participants with 
ADA, including a larger proportion being below the limit of quantification, compared with those who 
tested negative; this indicates an influence of ADA on nirsevimab PK between Days 151 and 361.  
An exposure-response analysis performed based on pooled data from MELODY and Study 3 (all 
subjects, figure 15) showed a positive correlation between AUC and a reduction in the risk of MA RSV 
LRTI through 150 days post dose with a target AUC of 12.8 mg*day/mL. The AUCs were divided into 
quartiles based on Study 3 data. MELODY applied weight-band dosing to achieve exposures above the 
serum Q1 efficacy target and the individual AUCs for MELODY subjects were mapped into the quartiles 
defined based on Study 3. Exposures (AUCs) for subjects in the MEDLEY study were derived using post 
hoc estimates of CL at baseline from the MEDLEY final popPK model. Nirsevimab exposures in the 
MEDLEY study were compared to the adjusted target exposure threshold of 12.8 day·mg/mL. Under 
these conditions, AUCbaseline CL was determined to be above the target in >80% of the overall 
MEDLEY population (94.3%) and for all subgroups of special interest: infants with CLD (94.1%), 
infants with hemodynamically significant CHD (80.3%), and extreme preterm infants <29 weeks GA 
(93.6%) (Table 6).

Thus, weight-band dosing (ie, 50 mg for infants weighing < 5 kg and 100 mg for infants weighing ≥ 5 
kg) resulted in exposures above the target in > 80% of the infants studied. No further relationship 
between nirsevimab exposure and the risk of MA RSV LRTI was evident based on data from the 
proposed weight-band dose.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
ELISA based methods were developed and validated for determination of nirsevimab serum 
concentrations, detection of ADAs to nirsevimab (screening/confirmation), NAbs to nirsevimab and 
ADAs to the YTE-substitution of nirsevimab. The quantification assay was not tolerant for ADAs at ADA 
concentrations >100 ng/mL. The drug tolerance of the ADA assay was 12.5 µg/mL for detection of 100 
ng/mL ADA against nirsevimab, which allows detection of sustained ADA positivity after Day 151. The 
Applicant will submit final bioanalytical reports covering MELODY and MEDLEY once they are available.  
Rank-based analysis of Study 3 data identified the optimal 5 kg cut-point for body weight of the 
proposed weight-band dosing, 50 mg <5 kg, 100 mg ≥5kg, applied in the phase 3 trials.  
The final Pop PK models including data from Study 3 (all dosed 50 mg), MELODY and MEDLEY (weight-
band dosing, 50 or 100 mg) are considered to be of high impact. No formal hypothesis testing for 
efficacy of nirsevimab in the higher-risk infant subgroups of MEDLEY was conducted. Individual model 
derived exposure metrics for MELODY and for MEDLEY using post-hoc estimates of CL at baseline, were 
used for extrapolation of efficacy from MELODY to MEDLEY by PK bridging as per approved PIP. A 
scatterplot of individual derived post hoc CL values in paediatric subjects for MELODY versus MEDLEY 
indicated PK comparability. Further PK comparability was demonstrated by fitting the MEDLEY data 
through external validation using the final MELODY Pop PK model. Nirsevimab serum concentration 
time curves following a single dose were simulated using a model that included time-varying body 
weight based on growth curves for preterm and term infants. The predicted exposure metrics indicated 
that the smallest infants of 1 kg could experience a 75% higher Cmax, a 10% lower Day 150 
concentration and a 15% higher AUC0-365 after 50 mg, than a 5 kg child receiving 100 mg. From the 
simulated exposure data for infants down to 1 kg, it is agreed that no dose adaptation is necessary in 
the lightest individuals. A sensitivity analysis for the 41 extremely preterm (≤ 29 wGA at birth) infants 
who received nirsevimab within the first 3 months of life, assuming F=100% and ka*5 only had a 
minimal effect on predicted AUC365 and increased predicted Cmax approximately 1.5-fold. Considering 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 59/138 
 
 
 
 
 
the safety margin compared to phase 1 adult data (with doses up to 3000 mg applied), this is still 
more than 3-fold for both, Cmax and AUC365, for the infant with the highest exposure in the extreme 
scenario (Kax5 and 100% bioavailability).  
The efficacy measure “Medically attended RSV-confirmed lower respiratory tract infection” (MA RSV 
LRTI) over a 5-month RSV season was explored using Cox proportional hazards modelling. Exposure 
evaluated as AUC quartiles, was a statistically significant predictor of MA RSV LRTI risk. Due to 
inclusion of additional Study 3 data, the AUC quartiles were updated using the final MELODY Pop PK 
model and a new and lower exposure threshold was defined (AUC 12.8 day·mg/mL). The exposure 
quartiles used in the updated E-R analysis included data from subjects who were not treated using 
weight-band dosing as applied in MEDLEY. A “proposed dose” E-R analysis excluding Study 3 data from 
infants weighing ≥5kg did not indicate any relation of AUC quartile to efficacy. In this analysis the 
upper limit of the AUCbaseline CL first quartile was 18.8 mg
day/mL.  
Overall, it can be agreed that an extrapolation of efficacy based on exposure is reasonable, as 
nirsevimab has an external target and viral aetiology as well as exposure-response are expected to be 
comparable between populations. Simulations indicate that the AUC 12.8 day·mg/mL threshold value 
was reached in >80% of infants in all investigated subgroups in study MEDLEY. From 66 infants with 
CHD, 53 reached threshold while 13 did not; thus, objective of extrapolation was only just met 
(80.3%).  
⋅
Positive exposure-response relationship was shown for efficacy: between AUC and a reduction in the 
risk of MA RSV LRTI through 150 days post dose. No dose-exposure-response analysis for safety has 
been conducted. As nirsevimab aims at an exogenous target, no target-related AEs are expected. For 
safety parameters investigated (e.g. systemic hypersensitivity, SAEs by PT, deaths), incidence was low 
and exposure-safety analyses are not expected to be robust. Thus, it is acceptable not to perform 
exposure-safety analyses for safety endpoints.  
The metabolic pathways of nirsevimab have not been investigated. This is acceptable for an IgG 
antibody. Commonly the t½ reported for human IgG is around 20 days, though there is a wide range 
in the reported values. Because of the YTE modification that was added to this monoclonal antibody to 
prolong the terminal t1/2 in humans, the terminal elimination half-life of nirsevimab was 69 (10) days 
for infants. The PK of nirsevimab were dose-proportional following single IV doses of 300 to 3000 mg 
and single IM doses of 100 mg to 300 mg in adults. In infants, dose proportional PK was seen after 
single IM doses of 25 mg to 50 mg. 
About ¾ of intramuscularly administered nirsevimab becomes systemically available based on adult 
data. This is well in line with what has been reported for other mAbs (52 -80% after SC or IM 
application). 
Due to the chosen route of administration, Cmax (113 µg/ml based on final popPK model) is reached 
with lag time, which is considered acceptable for a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting. Furthermore, 
much lower values were estimated to be sufficient for treatment effect (6.8 μg/mL). 
Currently, only data after a single dose of nirsevimab are available; PK data on planned re-application 
in the 2nd season are outstanding. No analysis of PK under steady state conditions has been 
performed; the potential for accumulation has not been investigated. 
No dedicated studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of nirsevimab in special 
populations. The effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the clearance of nirsevimab were not 
studied which is considered acceptable since intact nirsevimab is not expected to undergo renal 
elimination or to be metabolised by hepatic enzymes. No clinically relevant effects of race, ADA, or 
concomitant CLD or CHD on the PK of nirsevimab were identified. Age and weight are important 
covariates on the PK of nirsevimab. Baseline body weight and baseline postmenstrual age (PAGE) were 
strongly correlated. PAGE was included in the Pop PK model using a maturation function on CL. A 60% 
lower CL were estimated for a newborn child compared to complete maturation. This is of special 
interest for the infants born <29GA receiving their nirsevimab dose in their first month of life where 
the highest exposure is expected. Thus, the absolute numbers of exposure in these patients have been 
presented and were lower than those in the term infants dosed with the 100mg dose. As seen with 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 60/138 
 
 
 
other mAbs and thus expected for fixed dosing regimens, exposure decreased with increasing body 
weight. Considering the presumed weight ranges of the target population, there will be great 
differences in exposure after the planned weight-band dosing. Based on data presented it is agreed 
that CHD and CLD do not have a relevant impact on nirsevimab PK in infants. 
For study MEDLEY, mean serum concentrations by time point were presented separately for CLD/CHD 
cohorts within each weight/dose group. Results from CLD/CHD cohorts were well in line with results 
obtained in subjects without these pre-existing conditions. However, for all subgroups, inter-subject 
variability was high at some time points. Thus, the applicant presented the overlay of individual PK 
profiles of study MEDLEY for the subgroups CHD/CLD <5kg, and CHD/CLD ≥5 kg, respectively. These 
plots demonstrate that CHD/CLD children covered the extreme ranges of concentrations obtained after 
application of 50 mg and 100 mg nirsevimab, respectively. No apparent outliers were identified. Thus, 
as in overall population, high variability seen in CHD/CLD cohorts is supposed to be mainly attributed 
to the broad range of weights and ages (maturation) treated with the same flat-doses. The treatment 
regimen might therefore also be acceptable for CHD/CLD children.  
Based on data obtained with palivizumab, surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is expected to result in 
decreased exposure. Within study MEDLEY there were 9 infants that underwent surgery, 8 of them 
received a replacement dose. However, only for 4 infants pre- and post-surgery PK data (prior to next 
nirsevimab dose) were available. For these subjects only a small decrease (within assay variation) in 
nirsevimab serum concentration was seen. Thus, a data-based recommendation on an additional dose 
in infants undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass cannot be given. However, it can 
be agreed that an additional dose might be needed to facilitate RSV protection in infants that 
underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and that these children are of particular 
vulnerability. As no safety problems occurred in the limited number of subjects, an additional dose at 
the discretion of the treating clinician to be included in the SmPC is acceptable.  
Due to the nature of the product DDIs are not expected and it is accepted, that no DDI studies have 
been conducted. The PK of nirsevimab is well-described in the target population. Regarding 
concomitantly administration with routine paediatric vaccines it is accepted, that 
interactions/interference with the immune response to those is unlikely. Furthermore, routine vaccines 
were given in the safety pool. 
The primary PD effect of nirsevimab has been assessed by increase in serum anti-RSV neutralising 
antibody levels. These were correlated with nirsevimab serum concentrations across all dose levels in 
study 2, 3 and MELODY and ~93% of the infants with samples measured for RSV-neutralising 
antibodies experienced a ≥ 4- fold rise. This is accepted as a satisfactory PD response. 
The RSV-neutralising antibody levels for infants passively immunised with nirsevimab decreased 
between days 151 and 361 as expected but remained more than 5 times greater than baseline levels 
in subjects in study 3 and MELODY. The impact of maternal antibodies (detected as baseline level of 
anti-RSV antibodies in infants) on efficacy endpoints was investigated in exploratory analyses. The 
distribution of maternal antibodies was similar between treatment arms in each study and no 
correlation between baseline antibody level and efficacy endpoints was observed. 
Immunogenicity is a minor concern, if the product is intended for one time administration only. ADA 
incidence was low and did not affect the PK of nirsevimab before day 151. Beyond day 151 there is 
indication of changed PK due to ADA as serum concentrations of nirsevimab were lower in ADA positive 
subjects at day 361. In the target population, the impact of ADAs on exposure seems to be mainly 
present in elimination phase post day 151 and might presumably be attributed to ADAs against YTE 
substitution. Furthermore, it has to be kept in mind that the nirsevimab PK assay was not tolerant of 
antibody concentrations above 100 ng/mL for detection of nirsevimab concentrations ≤1 µg/mL. Thus, 
nirsevimab concentrations BLOQ post day 151 might also be a matter of assay deficiency in ADA 
positive subjects. As exposure until day 151 was not obviously affected in the large majority of ADA 
positive subjects, findings do not raise a certain concern.  
The surveillance virology data as well as the literature, supports that nirsevimab can be expected to 
exhibit activity against most currently circulating RSV strains (A as well as B subtypes), and the

children will continue in the EU after a potential marketing authorization. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
ELISA based methods were developed and validated for determination of nirsevimab serum 
concentrations, detection of ADAs to nirsevimab (screening/confirmation), NAbs to nirsevimab and 
ADAs to the YTE-substitution of nirsevimab. Final bioanalytical reports covering MELODY and MEDLEY 
are awaited and will be provided post-authorisation (PAM).  
The PK elimination phase of the half-life extended antibody nirsevimab has been adequately described 
in the target population. The absorption phase after the planned IM administration is mainly described 
by adult data due to sparse sampling in infants. PK of nirsevimab highly depends on weight and 
maturation of infants, which is considered by the popPK model developed by the Applicant.  
Clinical data on neutralising RSV antibodies indicate that sufficiently high values for a treatment effect 
will be obtained for up to 5 months. A good correlation between nirsevimab plasma concentration and 
neutralising RSV antibody titers was expected (as kind of concept proof) and is seen with clinical data. 
The prevalence of variants harbouring nirsevimab resistance-associated substitutions was low in the 
surveillance studies conducted.  
The incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was overall low within the clinical trial program.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
The Applicant agrees to submit the final bioanalytical reports covering MELODY and MEDLEY PK, ADA, 
anti-YTE and nAb analysis, when they become available. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The study programme for the assessment of efficacy includes 1 pivotal trial (MELODY), where the 
primary analysis has been completed (follow-up at day 151) and 1 phase IIb study (named Study 3). 
Additionally, a phase II/III study (MEDLEY) is ongoing in preterm infants born < 35 wGA (without CLD 
or CHD) and term and preterm infants with CLD or CHD. This study will only provide data to the 
extrapolation of efficacy. The submitted data provides information on efficacy in subjects entering their 
first RSV season. The Table below shows the details of the 3 studies.

2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies 
In study 3, a predefined subgroup analysis was conducted, and efficacy in subjects with a body weight 
higher than 5 kg was lower than subjects with a body weight lower than 5 kg. Furthermore, modelling 
and simulation study showed that nirsevimab exposure (AUC) was dependent on body weight, and a 
large proportion of infants weighing ≥ 5 kg had suboptimal exposure in Study 3 where only the 50 mg 
dose was used.  
Therefore, a higher dose (100 mg) was selected for MELODY in subjects weighing ≥ 5 kg.

MELODY: A Phase III Randomised, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Safety and Efficacy of MEDI8897, a Monoclonal Antibody With an Extended Half-life Against 
Respiratory Syncytial Virus, in Healthy Late Preterm and Term Infants  
Study 3:  A Phase IIb Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Safety and Efficacy of MEDI8897, a Monoclonal Antibody With an Extended Half-life Against 
Respiratory Syncytial Virus, in Healthy Preterm Infants 
Methods 
1.  Study Participants  
MELODY included healthy infants born at term or late preterm ≥ week 35 gestational age, and Study 
3 included preterm infants born between week 29+0 and week 34+6 gestational age.  
The infants had to enter their first RSV season when entering screening phase. In study 3 in EU, the 
infants had to be below 8 months of age when entering the season to be eligible.  
2.  Treatments 
The solution was 50 mg nirsevimab/ml. Corresponding saline solution was used for placebo. The 
treatment was a single dose. 
In MELODY, the dose was stratified by bodyweight. In infants weighing < 5 kg 50 mg was 
administered, and in infants weighing ≥ 5 kg, 100 mg was administered.  
In Study 3, 50 mg was used in all subjects, including subjects weighing ≥ 5 kg. Hence, only in subjects 
weighing less than 5 kg the proposed dose was used. 
3.  Objectives 
MELODY:

Study 3:  
Primary: Assessed the efficacy of MEDI8897 when administered as a single 50 mg IM dose to healthy 
preterm infants born between 29 weeks 0 days and 34 weeks 6 days GA and entering their first RSV 
season for the reduction of medically attended LRTI due to RT-PCR-confirmed RSV, compared to 
placebo 
Secondary: Assessed the efficacy of MEDI8897 for the reduction of hospitalizations due to RT- PCR-
confirmed RSV, compared to placebo 
4.  Outcomes/endpoints 
In MELODY, the primary endpoint was: Incidence of MA RSV LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) through 
150 days after dosing (ie, during a typical 5-month RSV season).  
In Study 3, the primary endpoint was: Incidence of medically attended LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) 
due to RT-PCR-confirmed RSV over the duration of the 5-month RSV season. 
In both studies, the RSV infection should be confirmed by RT PCR and in both studies, the primary 
analyses were conducted when subjects had reached day 150. 
Additionally, in MELODY, RSV infection after 150 days is stated as an exploratory efficacy endpoint. 
Furthermore, in both studies health care resources were prespecified as exploratory endpoints, e.g. 
ICU admission, duration of stay, respiratory support, oxygen supplementation. Specifically, the 
Applicant defined an endpoint of severe LRTI (MA RSV LRTI very severe), which included hospitalised 
patients with RSV LRTI who required oxygen supplementation or intra venous fluid.  
5.  Sample size 
For both studies, the sample size was aiming at 99% power to detect a 70% relative risk reduction. In 
both studies, the incidence rate in the placebo group was assumed to be 8%.  
In MELODY, the sample size was driven by safety database requirement, and 3000 infants should be 
included, of which 2000 should be exposed to nirsevimab. In study 3, 1500 infants should be included 
of which 1000 should be exposed to nirsevimab.  
6.  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
In both studies, infants were randomised 2:1 to either nirsevimab or placebo. The randomisation was 
stratified by Northern and Southern hemisphere and age (≤ 3.0 months, > 3.0 to ≤ 6.0 months, > 6.0 
months). An interactive web response system was used for the randomisation. 
Both MELODY and Study 3 were double-blind studies. MELODY was blinded until data base lock at 
day 511, except for one single Japanese subject that had completed the day 361 visit. 
7.  Statistical methods 
Intention to treat was used. Estimands were not defined but the influence of drop-outs was assessed 
using imputation methods. Dropout was minimal.  
Poisson regression with Zou's variance estimator is appropriate and standard under the circumstances. 
The implementation with the repeated statement in sas proc genmod is according to Zou's paper. 
Pooling of MELODY and Study 3: The secondary endpoint was analysed in a pooled analysis of 
MELODY and Study 3 using hierarchical testing (Figure 15)

Results 
1.  Participant flow 
Disposition of subjects are shown in Table 8.  
Overall, the disposition was similar between treatment arms within each study and across studies. The 
completion rate at day 151 was high (97.5% in MELODY and 98.0% in Study 3). In the nirsevimab 
arms there were 4 and 2 deaths in MELODY and Study 3, respectively. This is addressed in the safety 
section.

Table 8 Subject disposition – MELODY, study 3, and MEDLEY  
2.  Recruitment 
Study 3 was conducted between 3 November 2016 and 6 December 2018. In MELODY, the first 
subject was enrolled 23 July 2019, and the follow-up is not completed yet. 
3.  Conduct of the study 
There were several protocol deviations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of them were subjects 
missing at least one visit. In MELODY, 1.5% were excluded from the per protocol population and in 
Study 3, 0.2% were excluded from the per protocol population due to missed dose.  
Overall, the proportion of protocol deviations were similar between treatment groups. The Applicant 
has conducted several sensitivity analyses in order to address the missing visits due to COVID-19. 
4.  Baseline data 
The distribution of baseline variables was similar between treatment groups within each study (Table 
9).  
In MELODY, median age at randomisation (min;max) was 2.6 months (0.03;11.10). In Study 3, 
median age at randomisation (min;max) was 2.8 months (0.1;11.9).  
In Study 3, 22 children with a gestational age of 29 weeks were exposed to nirsevimab during the first 
3 months of life, but no children with a gestational age of 29 weeks were exposed before the age of 1 
month in this study. In the MEDLEY study (described below), 17 children with a gestational age 
between 24 weeks and ≤29 weeks were exposed to nirsevimab within the first 3 months of life and 
only 13 children within the age of 2 months. In the posology section in the SmPC, it is stated that 
there is limited data available in extremely preterm infants less than 8 weeks of age, and that no 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 67/138 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical data is available in infants with a postmenstrual age (gestational age at birth plus chronological 
age) of 32 weeks. 
In MELODY, 40% of the subjects had a body weight < 5 kg, and 15.6% had a body weight ≤ 2.5 kg. 
The minimum bodyweight was 1.8 kg in the nirsevimab group. In Study 3, mean bodyweight was 4.6 
kg and the minimum bodyweight was 1.6 kg in the nirsevimab group. 
In the posology section in the SmPC it is stated that safety and efficacy of nirsevimab in infants with 
body weight below 1.6 kg have not been established and no clinical data are available. Furthermore, it 
is stated that dosing in infants with a body weight from 1.0 kg to <1.6 kg are based on extrapolation. 
In MELODY, 7.7% of subjects had a history of respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, 6.7% 
had a history of gastrointestinal disorders, 6.3% had a history of infections and infestations, and 6.1% 
had a history of jaundice neonatal. In Study 3, the overall medical history was similar in both 
treatment groups. However, for atrial septal defects, the prevalence was higher (30/484 (6.2%)) for 
placebo than for nirsevimab (38/969 (3.9%)), and for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome the 
prevalence was 93/484 (19.2%) in the placebo group and 162/969 (16.7%) in the nirsevimab group 
and thereby the prevalence was also higher in the placebo group than nirsevimab for history of 
neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. In order to rule out that the results are confounded by medical 
history of atrial septal defects or neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, the Applicant has conducted 
a post hoc sensitivity analysis in which those two factors were added to the model.

5.  Numbers analysed 
The ITT populations were used for the primary analyses. Furthermore, a pooled population with 
individuals from MELODY and Study 3 were defined for the secondary endpoint (hospitalisation). 
Additionally, a pooled population with individuals dosed with the proposed dose was defined. This 
population consists of all subjects from MELODY and subject < 5 kg in Study 3, as subjects ≥ 5 kg in 
study 3 received 50 mg, which is lower than the proposed dose, which is 100 mg. 
6.  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
In MELODY, 12/994 subjects in the nirsevimab group and 25/496 subjects in the placebo group met 
the primary endpoint, and the relative risk reduction was 74.5% (95% CI: 49.6%, 87.1%) with 
nirsevimab compared with placebo (Table 10).  
In Study 3, 25/969 subjects in the nirsevimab group and 46/484 subjects in the placebo group met 
the primary endpoint, and the relative risk reduction was 70.1% (95% CI: 52.3%, 81.2%) with 
nirsevimab compared with placebo (Table 11).  
Results on the primary endpoints from both studies were statistically significant.

Secondary endpoint 
The secondary endpoints were analysed in the pooled population of MELODY and Study 3 according to 
the statistical analysis plan for MELODY (Table 12).  
First, a pooled analysis of the total population of MELODY and Study 3 was conducted. In this 
population, 14/1963 (0.7%) in the nirsevimab group and 28/980 (2.9%) in the placebo group met the 
secondary endpoint (MA RSV LRTI hospitalisation 150 days post dose). The relative risk reduction 
reached statistical significance with an estimate (95% CI) of 73.5% (50.2%; 85.9%). The absolute 
difference was low with an estimated treatment difference of around 2.2% point.  
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 71/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Applicant also defined a pooled population of individuals receiving the proposed dose – that is all 
subjects in MELODY and subjects <5 kg in Study 3. In this pooled population, the RRR was marginally 
higher (77.3%), and the treatment difference was 2.1% point.  
In MELODY alone, the RRR reduction was lower (62.1%) and not statistically significant, and the 
treatment difference was around 1.0% point. 
In Study 3 alone, the relative risk reduction was 78.4% (95% CI: 51.9%;90.3%).

7.  Ancillary analyses 
Exploratory endpoints 
The analyses of RSV subtype were predefined, and the results showed a numerically higher event rate 
for both RSV A and RSV B in placebo group than nirsevimab group in both studies and in the pooled 
population with the proposed dose (Table 14). The efficacy related to RSV subtype is further 
addressed in the pharmacology section.

Pooled analysis 
The Applicant has conducted a wide range of explorative analyses and explorative endpoints have been 
defined.  
Severity of RSV was defined prior to unblinding and included hospitalisation plus requirement for 
supplemental oxygen or IV fluids. In MELODY, 5/994 subjects (0.5%) in nirsevimab and 7/496 
subjects (1.4%) in placebo met the endpoint with a relative risk reduction of 64.2% (-12.1%;88.6%) 
with nirsevimab compared to placebo. In Study 3, the estimate was numerically higher, and 4/969 
subjects (0.4%) and 16/484 subjects (3.3%) met the endpoint, and the relative risk reduction was 
87.5% (62.9%;95.8%). When pooling the analyses of patients with the proposed dose, the estimate 
was 88.3% (50.3;89.7%). Hence, the exploratory analyses of severity pointed towards an effect 
against severe respiratory illness.  
For alternative case definitions of MA RSV LRTI, a higher number of events were included when LRTI 
was also permitted to be defined by investigator judgement (All MA RSV LRTI), and when RSV was 
permitted to be defined by any (local or central) testing (All MA RSV [any test] LRTI). As shown in 
Figure 16, the estimates were of similar magnitude as the primary and secondary endpoint definition.

Health care utilisation 
In MELODY and Study 3, numerically fewer patients were admitted to ICU, required supplemental 
oxygen, CPAP or mechanical ventilation in the nirsevimab group than the placebo group (Table 15).

dose) Pool 
Sensitivity analyses 
Imputation of missing data showed results consistent with the main analysis. Even with the most 
conservative analysis, where missing events was counted as an event in the nirsevimab group and as 
no event in the placebo group, the effect was statistically significant, although the estimate for relative 
risk reduction was lower 46.1% (8.2;68.4) than the main analysis as anticipated. Sensitivity analysis 
using principal stratum estimand, hypothetical estimand and using laboratory data after intercurrent 
event showed similar results as the main analysis. 
In a requested post-hoc sensitivity analysis atrial septal defects and neonatal respiratory distress 
syndrome were included as covariates in order to analyse whether the results were driven by those 
factors due to the imbalance of those two medical conditions at baseline. The estimate for this analysis 
is 73.1% (56.7%, 83.2%) and is similar to the estimate of the main analysis of 70.1% (52.3%, 
81.2%). 
Subgroup analyses 
MELODY (Figure 17) Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint in MELODY showed a lower estimate 
for children with low birthweight (≤ 2.5 kg) of 39.3% (- 253.2;89.6), as 3/145 subjects in the 
nirsevimab group and 3/88 subjects in the placebo group met the endpoint. In children with a 
birthweight > 2.5 kg, the relative risk reduction was 80%.  
Additionally, children with a body weight <5 kg at randomisation had a lower effect (RRR of 52.4%, 
95% CI: -41.9;84.0) than children >5 kg.  
Study 3 (Figure 18) In children with birth weight ≤ 2.5 kg no differences in effect was seen 
compared with birthweight >2.5 kg. In study 3 it seems that dosing early after birth and in children 
with low weight at time of dosing, there is a tendency towards a higher effect, although not statistically 
significantly different. This is opposite to what is shown in the pooled analysis.  
In neither of the studies, the interaction terms were statistically significant and the confidence intervals 
were overlapping

MEDLEY:  A Study to Evaluate the Safety of MEDI8897 for the Prevention of Medically 
Attended Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRTI) in 
High-risk Children. 
1.  Study participants 
The population consisted of two cohorts: preterm infants ≤ 35+0 weeks gestational age with no lower 
limit of gestational age, besides for the population in Japan in which the gestational age was 29-35 
weeks.  
The second cohort consisted of term and preterm infants in their first year of life with either chronic 
lung disease of prematurity or congenital heart disease.  
2.  Treatments 
Subjects were randomised to weight-based dose of nirsevimab (50 mg or 100 mg) or palivizumab 
15mg/kg once monthly x 5. Relevant placebo injections were used. 
Administration of other medication were allowed at the discretion of the investigators and were 
recorded.

3.  Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate safety. One of the secondary objectives was to assess the effect 
of nirsevimab on MA LRTI and hospitalization in the first and second RSV season. 
4.  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint in the MEDLEY trial was safety. Efficacy endpoints were part of the secondary 
endpoint or explorative endpoints. Criteria for the MA LRTI is the same as in MELODY and Study 3, 
with an addition of prescription of new or increased dose of medications (bronchodilators, steroids, 
diuretics, cardiac medication) because the CLD/CHD cohort were on this background treatment. 
Efficacy was based on extrapolation as agreed by the PDCO. 
5.  Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on safety, and 600 subjects were to be exposed to nirsevimab 
and 300 to palivizumab. Superiority and noninferiority design in terms of efficacy was not feasible.  
6.  Randomisation and blinding 
The randomization was stratified by age group and hemisphere as in the MELODY and Study 3. The 
randomization was not stratified by CLD/CHD disease. The two cohorts (preterm and CLD/CHD) were 
balanced between treatment groups. The study was double-blinded.  
7.  Statistical methods 
Descriptive statistics were used for efficacy variables. Furthermore, extrapolation was used to assess 
efficacy. Please refer to the pharmacology section.

Results 
8.  Participant flow 
Figure 19 Subject Disposition (Season 1) 
9.  Recruitment 
The first subject was enrolled on 30 July 2019, and the study is still ongoing.  
Subjects were enrolled at 126 sites in 25 countries, and 497 subjects were enrolled in EU countries.  
10. Conduct of the study 
Of the total study population 15.7% had at least 1 important protocol deviation. The deviations were 
balanced between treatment groups, but subjects in the CLD/CHD cohort had a lower frequency of 
protocol deviations (10.3% vs 18.4%).  
11. Baseline data 
The baseline characteristics were balanced between the two treatment arms in both cohorts. In the 
CLD/CHD, the median age at baseline was 1.8 months higher than the preterm group. As such, the 
median body weight was also marginally higher (0.7 kg). Minimum bodyweight in the nirsevimab group 
at baseline was 1.8 kg and the minimum age at dosing was 0.07 months corresponding to 2 days. No 
minimum bodyweight is stated in the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 87/138 
 
 
 
 
 
Even though subjects with a gestational age of 22 weeks were included in the study, the minimum 
bodyweight was 1.8 kg. Hence, none of the extremely preterm children were treated with nirsevimab 
early in life. The age of nirsevimab dosing is shown in Table 3 for MEDLEY, Study 3 and MELODY.  
Table 18 Nirsevimab recipients by age of dosing (MEDLEY, MELODY, and Study 3) 
Median gestational age was 32 weeks in preterm subjects and 30 weeks in CLD/CHD subjects, and the 
lowest gestational age was 22 weeks. Overall, 21.1% of the included subjects in the nirsevimab group 
(n=130) were born earlier than week 29 gestational age. Hence, a reasonable large population of 
extremely preterm children were included in the MEDLEY study.

12. Numbers analysed 
In the ITT population, 925 subjects were included. In the CLD/CHD cohort, 310 children were included 
and in the preterm cohort, 615 children were included. 
13. Outcomes and estimation 
The proportion of subjects with a MA RSV LRTI through 150 days post first dose was similar in the two 
treatment groups (1.0% in palivizumab group and 0.6% in nirsevimab group) (Table 20). This was also 
the case when the data was stratified by CHD/CLD and a similar pattern was seen with hospitalisation 
due to MA RSV LRTI (Table 21). The Applicant has not shown the data for health care utilisation for 
the prespecified endpoint. When using the broader definition of endpoint (ALL MA LRTI), the incidence 
of respiratory support use was higher in nirsevimab than palivizumab (0.6% vs 0.3%), and 
supplemental oxygen was also higher (1.9% vs 1.6%) (Table 22). The differences were primarily seen 
in the CLD/CHD cohort. However, the endpoint is not based on RSV, and the numbers are low. No 
formal statistical analysis has been conducted.

14. Extrapolation 
In the pharmacology section, the popPK model used to extrapolate results from MELODY and Study 3 
to high risk population in MEDLEY is addressed. 
In MEDLEY 21.6% of the study population was extremely preterm. Of those, 130 subjects were 
exposed to nirsevimab. The median bodyweight and range are similar to the study population of Study 
3, which is acknowledged in terms of PK and extrapolation. However, none of the extremely preterm 
children were dosed early in life, as the minimum bodyweight in the nirsevimab group was 1.6 kg in 
Study 3, and 1.8 kg in MELODY and MEDLEY.

2.6.5.6.  Supportive studies 
Anti-drug antibodies 
In the pooled analysis, the occurrence of ADA was approximately 6% and 3% in nirsevimab-treated 
and placebo-treated arms, and the occurrence of ADA was comparable amongst the different patient 
populations receiving nirsevimab (i.e. no substantial effect of gestational age and body weight on ADE-
development).  
The occurrence of neutralising antibodies in nirsevimab-treated patients was 1%, and the occurrence 
of YTE-targeting antibodies was approximately 3%-5%. Thus, the occurrence of YTE-targeting 
antibodies was comparable to the occurrence of ADA, which is not surprising, because (i) essentially 
the same assay format was employed for measurement of these 2 parameters, (ii) the YTE 
modification, comprising a surface-exposed non-germline modification of nirsevimab, is expected to 
comprise a major target for ADA. In contrast, the occurrence of neutralizing antibodies was lower than 
the occurrence of ADA. This again is not surprising, as nirsevimab has a high binding affinity for the F 
protein, i.e. the fluid-phase competition assays employed to detect neutralizing antibodies would be 
expected to measure primarily high-affinity neutralizing antibodies.  
There was a tendency of a higher incidence of MA RSV LRTI +/- hospitalisation in subjects with ADA 
compared with subjects without ADA in MELODY (Table 23). As such 13.3% of subjects with ADA had 
an event whereas only 1.0% of subjects without ADA had an event. For hospitalisation, the incidence 
was 6.7% vs 0.5% for ADA positive and ADA negative subjects, respectively. 
This tendency was although not so clear in Study 3, where 3.8% of ADA positive had an event and 
2.5% of ADA negative had an event. For hospitalisation, the opposite was seen 0% vs 0.8%.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of the current application is supported by 3 studies: A phase 3 pivotal trial (MELODY), a 
phase 2b trial (Study 3) and a phase 2 trial (MEDLEY). The 3 studies target different parts of the 
paediatric population entering their first RSV season. In MELODY, healthy infants with a gestational 
age from week 35+0 are included. In Study 3, healthy infants with a gestational age between week 
29+0 to week 35 are included. In MEDLEY, two different cohorts are included: healthy infants with a 
gestational age below week 29 and infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or chronic lung 
disease (CLD).  
In MELODY, which included healthy children, infants with an underlying illness such as cystic fibrosis or 
Down syndrome with no other risk factors were eligible to be enrolled.  
MELODY and Study 3 overall have similar study design, and both studies are randomised placebo-
controlled trials and subjects were randomised 2:1 to receive one dose of nirsevimab or placebo before 
entering the RSV season. In Study 3, a flat dose of 50 mg was administered to all children in the 
nirsevimab group. However, due to lower exposure and lower efficacy in subjects with a bodyweight ≥ 
5 kg, the dose in the phase 3 study (MELODY) was based on bodyweight: 50 mg for children with a 
bodyweight < 5 kg and 100 mg for children with a bodyweight ≥ 5 kg. The proposed dosing regimen is 
considered sufficiently justified and is also the proposed dose stated in the SmPC.  
MEDLEY is an ongoing Phase II/III study in high-risk infants eligible to receive palivizumab when 
entering their first or second RSV season i.e preterm infants born < 35 wGA (without CLD or CHD) and 
term and preterm infants with CLD or CHD. This study was designed to evaluate the safety, PK, ADA 
response, and descriptive efficacy of nirsevimab in comparison to palivizumab. Thus, this study will 
only provide data to the extrapolation of efficacy and is considered supportive in this respect. The 
currently submitted data provides information on efficacy in subjects entering their first RSV season. 
In MEDLEY, subjects were randomised 2:1 to nirsevimab (50 mg or 100 mg and subsequently 4 
monthly doses of placebo) or palivizumab 15mg/kg x 5 monthly. 
The primary endpoint in MELODY and Study 3 was medically attended RSV lower respiratory tract 
infection (MA RSV LRTI) through day 150 post dose. The key secondary endpoint was MA RSV LRTI 
hospitalisation. The primary endpoint is clinically relevant, but the key secondary endpoint might be 
due to biases, as health care service might differ between countries and also differ within countries and 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 94/138 
 
 
 
 
is dependent on hospital occupancy. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, where MELODY was 
conducted, this might have affected the hospitalisation rate. However, to some extend this might also 
be true for the primary endpoint i.e. MA visit especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects might 
have hesitated to visit health care facilities. Since hospitalisation rate shows a trend towards more 
serious disease it is acceptable that it is mentioned in the SmPC although this is not in accordance with 
the CHMP scientific advice. 
Severity of the MA RSV LRTI is considered more relevant. As suggested by the CHMP scientific advice, 
the Applicant has defined an explorative endpoint (very severe RSV), which included hospitalisation 
and requirement of oxygen supplementation or IV fluids. This is considered clinically relevant and is 
included in the SmPC. Furthermore, the Applicant has been asked to consider contriving an ordinal 
composite severity score (4 levels).  
In the original protocol (5 April 2019), thus prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Applicant planned a 
pooled analysis, in which data from MELODY and Study 3 were pooled for the secondary endpoint. The 
Applicant is although focusing on the population from Study 3 receiving the proposed dose and not the 
full population, even though the full population was included in the predefined analysis in the 
hierarchical testing. As stated in the CMHP scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/182016/2019), it is 
important that the two studies can stand alone in order to support an indication for the full paediatric 
population entering their first season of RSV. Therefore, the pooled analysis should be considered 
supportive, only.  
In MEDLEY, the primary endpoint was safety, and secondary endpoints were pharmacokinetics and 
descriptive efficacy endpoints. In order to establish efficacy in the MEDLEY population, extrapolation 
was used. This approach is considered acceptable and is in accordance with the PIP. 
The design of the studies is considered adequate and is in accordance with the PIP, and the selected 
study population is relevant for the applied indication. The comparator used in the studies are relevant, 
and it is acknowledged that an active comparator was used in the MEDLEY population although non-
inferiority could not be evaluated. Delayed or missed doses of palivizumab might have decreased 
protection against RSV in the palivizumab group and a supportive, per-protocol analysis of the relevant 
efficacy endpoints in MEDLEY has been requested. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In MELODY and Study 3, 1,490 and 1,540 subjects, respectively, were randomised to nirsevimab or 
placebo. The proportion of subjects completing the day 151 follow-up visit was high (between 95.5% 
and 98.4%). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, several subjects had at least 1 missing visit. The 
Applicant has conducted several sensitivity analyses to address this issue, and the results pointed in 
the same direction as the main analysis.  
The study populations for the 3 studies were well described in terms of gestational week, bodyweight 
and age, and minimum gestational age was week 22, and the minimum bodyweight at dosing was 1.6 
kg and minimum age at dosing was 0.03 months (~1 days). In the SmPC, no minimum age or 
bodyweight are included, neither for the term and preterm children. This has been discussed by the 
CHMP and based on the data submitted by the Applicant including the modelling of the exposure in 
children from 1 kg and the overall safety data, it can be concluded that efficacy and safety can be 
extrapolated to the youngest and lightest possible individuals both for term and preterm individuals. 
Hence, no minimum age or bodyweight should be included in indication, neither for term or preterm 
children. As requested, the Applicant has stated in the SmPC section 4.2 that no clinical data in 
children with a bodyweight below 1.6 kg exist, and that the dose in children down to 1 kg is based on 
modelling. 
Across the 3 studies included in the dossier, 41 extremely preterm infants (≤29 weeks gestational age) 
received nirsevimab within the first 3 months of life. Only 1 subject (29 weeks gestational age) 
received nirsevimab below 1 month of age, 12 subjects between 1 and 2 months of age, and 28 
subjects between 2 and 3 months of age. None of the children with GA of 24-25 weeks received 
nirsevimab below 3 months chronological age. As discussed in the pharmacology section the minimum 
postmenstrual age at dosing was 7.4 months. In the SmPC section 4.2 it is reflected that there is 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 95/138 
 
 
 
limited data available in extremely preterm infants (Gestational Age] <29 weeks) less than 8 weeks of 
age, and that no clinical data is available in infants with a postmenstrual age (gestational age at birth 
plus chronological age) of 32 weeks.  
Overall, the demographics of the study populations were well balanced between treatment arms, 
although an overview of medical history was missing for Study 3, which the Applicant has provided 
with the day 90 responses. In study 3, the medical history was similar in both treatment groups. 
However, for atrial septal defects, the prevalence was higher (30/484 (6.2%)) for placebo than for 
nirsevimab (38/969 (3.9%)), and for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome the prevalence was 
93/484 (19.2%) in the placebo group and 162/969 (16.7%) in the nirsevimab group and thereby the 
prevalence was also higher in the placebo group than nirsevimab for history of neonatal respiratory 
distress syndrome. As the imbalances in history of atrial septal defects and neonatal respiratory 
distress syndrome could potentially have driven the effect estimates, a post hoc sensitivity analysis 
was requested. 
The event rate of MA RSV LRTI (primary endpoint) was lower for the nirsevimab group than the 
placebo group. As such, 12/994 (1.2%) subjects in the nirsevimab group and 25/496 (5.0) subjects in 
the placebo group met the primary endpoint, and the relative risk reduction was 74.5% (95% CI: 
49.6%, 87.1%) with nirsevimab compared with placebo in MELODY in subjects with GA > 35 weeks. 
Similar pattern was seen in subjects with GA between week 29 and week 35, where the event rate was 
25/969 (2.6%) and 46/484 (9.5%) in the nirsevimab and placebo arm, respectively, corresponding to 
a relative risk reduction of 70.1% (95% CI: 52.3%, 81.2%). Even though the relative risk reductions 
are high, the absolute numbers are low. The event rates in the placebo groups are lower than 
expected, which also turn into a lower absolute effect. However, the relative risk reduction is as 
anticipated in the sample size calculation (70%). 
The key secondary endpoint was MA RSV LRTI with hospitalisation. In MELODY, the relative risk 
reduction was not statistically significant: 62.1% (95% CI: -8.6; 86.8) with 8/496 hospitalisations in 
the placebo group and 6/994 hospitalisations in the nirsevimab group. In Study 3, MA RSV LRTI with 
hospitalization was statistically significant. The relative risk reduction was 78.4% (95% CI: 51.9; 90.3) 
with 20/484 hospitalisations in the placebo group and 8/969 hospitalisations in the nirsevimab group. 
A pooled analysis and part of the statistical hierarchy in the MELODY study was planned after the 
results from Study 3 were available due to anticipated low numbers of hospitalisations. The pooled 
analysis showed a relative risk reduction of 73.5% (50.2; 85.9). As mentioned above, a hospitalisation 
endpoint may be subject to external impact and as such the results are subject to bias. Therefore, a 
more clinically relevant endpoint is acknowledged as the predefined exploratory endpoint, very severe 
RSV. 
This was defined as MA RSV LRTI hospitalisation and requirement of oxygen or intravenous fluid. In 
MELODY, 5/994 subjects (0.5%) in the nirsevimab group and 7/496 subjects (1.4%) in the placebo 
group had severe RSV corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 64.2% (-12.1%;88.6%) with 
nirsevimab compared to placebo. In Study 3, the estimate was numerically higher, and 4/969 subjects 
(0.4%) in the nirsevimab group and 16/484 subjects (3.3%) in the placebo group, had severe RSV; 
with a relative risk reduction of 87.5% (62.9%;95.8%). Hence, the exploratory analyses of severity 
pointed towards an effect against severe respiratory illness with nirsevimab in both studies, although 
the results were not statistically significant in MELODY. This was further supported by explorative 
analysis in Study 3 showing that numerically fewer patients were admitted to ICU, were in need of 
supplemental oxygen, CPAP or mechanical ventilation in the nirsevimab group than the placebo group. 
In MELODY, the numbers were low, and there were no differences between the treatment groups with 
regards to severity measures. 
On request, the Applicant conducted post hoc analysis including a proportional odds model, which 
supported the primary analysis. Additionally, a post hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted in which 
atrial septal defects and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome were included as covariates in order to 
analyse whether the results were driven by those factors due to the imbalance of those two medical 
conditions at baseline. The estimate of the sensitivity analysis was similar to the main analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022

Overall, the two studies showed an effect of nirsevimab on MA RSV LRTI and severe RSV in healthy 
subjects with a GA > 29 weeks, and even though the magnitude of effect compared to placebo, due to 
the overall low event rate, might be considered modest, it is considered clinically relevant.  
For subjects with a GA < 29 weeks and subjects with CLD or CHD extrapolation of efficacy from 
MELODY and Study 3 was used. Furthermore, the event rates from MEDLEY were analysed 
descriptively. In MEDLEY, 616 children were randomised to nirsevimab, and 309 children were 
randomised to palivizumab. The incidence of MA RSV LRTI was lower in this population than MELODY 
and study 3, which was expected due to the high-risk nature of the population and thereby a focus on 
minimising the risk of infections e.g. by social distancing. The event rate in the nirsevimab group was 
4/616 (0.6%) and in the placebo group 3/309 (1.0%).  
The Applicant has conducted relevant subgroup analysis and the effect was consistent across 
subgroups of gender, gestational age, bodyweight and age at treatment.

2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The study design of the three studies are considered relevant for the applied indication. No data in 
children with a bodyweight below 1.6 kg exists, however, based on the data including the modelling of 
the exposure in children from 1 kg and the overall safety data, it can be concluded that efficacy and 
safety can be extrapolated to the youngest and lightest possible individuals both for term and preterm 
individuals. 
Overall, an effect of nirsevimab on MA RSV LRTI and severe RSV in healthy subjects with a GA > 29 
weeks was shown in the studies MELODY and Study 3, and even though the magnitude of effect 
compared to placebo, due to the overall low event rate, might be considered modest, it is considered 
clinically relevant.  
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The preliminary safety evaluation is based on safety data from three pivotal studies on the use of 
nirsevimab (50 mg or 100 mg single IM dose) in 2569 infants in their first RSV season:  
Study 3, a Phase IIb Study D5290C00003/randomised 2:1 nirsevimab: placebo, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled (complete). Very and moderately preterm infants born ≥ 29 to < 35 wGA (Study 3; 
N = 1453). 
MELODY, a Phase III Study D5290C00004 /randomised 2:1 nirsevimab: placebo, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled (ongoing). Term and late preterm infants born ≥ 35 wGA (MELODY; N = 1490). 
Data cut-off date of 11 March 2021, and a data lock date of 14 April 2021.

Table 24 Pivotal Studies Contributing to the Evaluation of the Clinical Safety of Nirsevimab  
Non-clinical findings 
Non-clinical data from toxicology-studies in cynomolgus monkeys, cross-reactivity studies against 
adult, juvenile, neonatal and foetal human tissues did not disclose any safety concerns for Nirsevimab. 
Also, in an RSV challenge study in a cotton rat model of RSV infection no antibody dependent 
enhancement (ADE) of RSV infection was observed. 
Pharmacological Class Effects 
As no non-clinical studies raised concern of safety concerns related to nirsevimab, the potential risks 
were based on the pharmacological class effect of immunoglobulins (including mAbs) and thus included 
focus on adverse events as immediate hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) and immune complex 
disease as AESI’s. This also included thrombocytopenia as such events of were reported in post-
approval use of SYNAGIS® (palivizumab). 
2.6.8.1.  Methods 
Safety data in term and preterm infants born ≥ 29 wGA with a safety follow-up of 360 days post dose 
from MELODY and study 3 were analysed in 2 pools: 
The MELODY/study 3 (All) safety pool that included pooled data of all dosed participants from 
Study 3 and the MELODY primary cohort ((N = 2925 dosed with either nirsevimab [n = 1955] or 
Assessment report

placebo [n = 970]) and a subpopulation; the MELODY/Study 3 (proposed dose) safety pool that 
include pooled data of subjects receiving the proposed dose (50 mg for infants weighing < 5 kg or 100 
mg for infants weighing ≥ 5 kg at the time of dosing) weighing < 5 kg at the time of dosing from Study 
3 and the MELODY primary cohort (N = 2338 dosed with either nirsevimab [n = 1559] or placebo[n = 
779]). The MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool was used to evaluate the AE profile, ADRs, and potential 
risks comprising the largest pool of placebo-controlled data for nirsevimab. Data from the palivizumab-
controlled MEDLEY study in infants at higher risk for severe RSV disease (including subpopulations of 
extremely preterm infants born < 29 wGA and infants with CLD or CHD) through at least 150 days 
post dose was evaluated separately due to differences in study design. 
The safety evaluation was standardised across the studies and adverse events coded using the 
MedDRA version 23.1, evaluations including treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs, discontinuations, NOCDs, 
AESIs, and skin reactions.  
2.6.8.2.  Disposition and baseline characteristics 
Dispositions 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool of infants born at term and preterm (≥ 29 wGA), 3166 
subjects were screened, of whom 2943 were enrolled and randomised (2:1) to nirsevimab (n = 1963) 
or placebo (n = 980). Of the 2943 randomised subjects, 2925 (1953 in the nirsevimab group and 972 
in the placebo group) were dosed and included in the As-treated Population. Disposition data were 
balanced in the nirsevimab and placebo groups with similar percentages of subjects completing the 
Day 151 follow-up, completing the Day 361 follow-up and completing the ongoing study (. For the 96 
(4.9%) subjects in the nirsevimab group and 51 (5.2%) in the placebo group who discontinued the 
study, the main reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal by the parent/guardian and lost to follow-
up, both of which occurred in similar percentage of subjects in each group. 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool of subjects from MELODY + subjects weighing < 
5 kg at the time of dosing in Study 3, 2350 subjects were randomised (2:1) to nirsevimab (n = 1564) 
or placebo (n = 786). Of the 2350 randomised subjects, 2338 (1557 in the nirsevimab group and 781 
in the placebo group) were dosed and included in the As-treated Population. Disposition data were 
balanced in the nirsevimab and placebo groups with similar percentages of subjects completing the 
Day 151 follow-up, completing the Day 361 follow-up and completing the ongoing study. For the 68 
(4.4%) subjects in the nirsevimab group and 38 (4.9%) subjects in the placebo group who 
discontinued the study, the main reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal by the parent/guardian 
and lost to follow-up, both of which occurred in a similar percentage of subjects in each group. 
In MEDLEY, 960 subjects were screened, of whom 925 were enrolled and randomised (2:1) to 
nirsevimab (n = 616) or palivizumab (n = 309). A total of 918 subjects (614 in the nirsevimab group 
and 304 in the palivizumab group) were dosed and included in the As-treated Population. Disposition 
data were balanced in the nirsevimab and palivizumab groups with similar percentages of subjects 
completing dosing, completing follow-up through at least 150 days post first dose, and reaching Day 
361. For the 50 subjects in the nirsevimab group and 22 subjects in the palivizumab group who 
discontinued, the main reasons for discontinuation were being withdrawn by the parent/guardian and 
COVID-19 pandemic.  
In the preterm cohort of subjects born < 35 wGA without CLD/CHD, 615 subjects were randomised to 
nirsevimab (n = 407) or palivizumab (n = 208). Of these subjects, 612 were dosed (1 subject in the 
nirsevimab group and 2 subjects in the palivizumab group were not dosed). A total of 587 subjects, 
including 389 in the nirsevimab group and 198 in the palivizumab group, had completed follow-up 
through at least 150 days post first dose and 250 subjects (40.7%), including 167 (41.0%) in the 
nirsevimab group and 83 in the palivizumab group, completed RSV Season 1 and are considered to 
have completed the study per protocol. In the CLD/CHD cohort, 310 subjects were randomised to 
nirsevimab (n = 209) or palivizumab (n = 101). Of these subjects, 306 were dosed (1 subject in the 
nirsevimab group and 3 subjects in the palivizumab group were not dosed). A total of 299 subjects, 
including 204 in the nirsevimab group and 95 in the palivizumab group, had completed follow-up

through at least 150 days post first dose, and 115 subjects, including 75 in the nirsevimab group and 
40 in the palivizumab group, completed RSV Season 1.

Table 26 Baseline Characteristics (MELODY/Study 3 [All] Safety Pool) 
Baseline demographics and characteristics (Table 25 and Table 26) were overall similar and balanced 
between the nirsevimab and placebo groups among the study population included in the 
MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool and adequate for the intended target population of infants born at 
term and late preterm (≥ 35 wGA) and infants born very and moderately preterm (≥ 29 to < 35 wGA). 
The median age at randomisation was 2.70 months (0.03-11.90 months) in the nirsevimab group and 
a little less in the placebo group: 2.3 (0.03-11.30 months). The percentage of participants with weight 
≤ 2.5 kg were a little fewer in the nirsevimab group: 53.6% compared to 55.4% in the placebo group.  
In the subgroup of participants < 2.5 kg on Day 1, baseline demographics and characteristics were 
overall similar to the study population included in the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool except the

median age at randomisation (0.7 months) and the mean weight on Day 1 (2.1 kg) (39.2% in GA 
groups of ≥ 29 weeks to ≤ 32 weeks and 46.3% in GA group > 32 weeks to < 35 weeks). The 
discrepancies were considered subject to the subgroup characteristics. This was also evident in the 
subgroup of neonates (all infants < 28 days at randomisation) where the median age at randomisation, 
which was 0.5 months and mean weight on Day 1, which was 2.8 kg in nirsevimab and 3.0 kg placebo 
groups for neonates compared with 5.04 kg and 5.05 kg, respectively in the overall MELODY/Study 3 
(All) Safety Pool. 
Medical history for the study population in the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool were overall balanced 
between both treatment arms and considered representative of common pediatric conditions for the 
intended target population (nirsevimab 47.2% and placebo 47.0%, respectively). The majority were 
disorders categorised in the SOCs of Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (17.5%, each), 
most frequently TEA’s by PT neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (8.8% and 10.0%, respectively), 
nasal congestion (2.6% and 2.4%, respectively). Overall baseline demographics, characteristics and 
medical history for the MELODY /Study 3 (All) Safety pool were balanced between nirsevimab and 
placebo groups. Baseline demographics and characteristics were overall similar and balanced between 
the nirsevimab and placebo groups among the study population included in the MELODY/Study 3 
(proposed) Safety Pool and reflecting the intended target population of infants born at term and late 
preterm (≥ 35 wGA) and infants born very and moderately preterm (≥ 29 to < 35 wGA). Medical history 
for the study population in the MELODY/Study 3 (proposed) Safety Pool were overall balanced between 
both treatment arms and considered representative of common pediatric conditions for the intended 
target population. Overall baseline demographics, characteristics and medical history for the MELODY 
/Study 3 (proposed) Safety pool were balanced between nirsevimab and placebo groups. 
In the MEDLEY study cohort, baseline demographics and characteristics were overall similar and 
balanced between treatment groups and represented the intended target population of infants at 
higher risk for RSV disease, including infants born preterm < 35 wGA without CLD/CHD (preterm 
cohort) and infants with CLD or CHD, with some infants born extremely preterm < 29 wGA in both 
cohorts. In the CLD/CHD cohort there were fewer subjects in the weight group < 5kg in the nirsevimab 
treatment group (48.6% vs. 52.0%) and more in the weight group ≥5 kg (51.4% vs. 48.0%). Also, by 
gestational age there were numerical imbalances with fewer subjects <29 weeks in the nirsevimab 
group (38.8% vs. 41.6%) and more in the ≥29 to <weeks (17.7% vs. 11.9%) compared to 
palivizumab. Medical history for the MELODY study population was overall balanced between both 
treatment arms and considered representative of the more complex pediatric conditions this cohort of 
infants at higher risk of RSV disease. Overall baseline demographics, characteristics and medical 
history for the MEDLEY study were balanced between nirsevimab and placebo groups. 
2.6.8.3.  Patient exposure 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool subjects received a single dose of nirsevimab (n=1955) or 
placebo (n=970). In the nirsevimab group, 70.4% (1377) received a 50 mg dose and 29.6% (578) 
received a 100 mg dose. In study 3 there were to subjects that incorrectly received nirsevimab and is 
included in the safety analysis. In the MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool group, 62.9% 
(981) in the nirsevimab group received 50 mg and 37.1% (578) received 100 mg.

Table 27 Summary of Exposure (MELODY/Study 3 [ALL] Safety Pool) 
Table 28 Summary of Exposure (MELODY/Study 3 [Proposed Dose] Safety Pool) 
In the MEDLEY study, a total of 918 subjects (nirsevimab (n=614) and palivizumab (n=304) were 
dosed.  Almost 90% of subjects received all 5 planned doses (nirsevimab:100.0% received at least one 
active dose; palivizumab: 90.1% received at least 5 active doses). 
2.6.8.4.  Adverse events 
All-over in the MELODY/Study 3 (All Safety Pool), the percentage of subjects that experienced at 
least one AE was identical (86.8%) in the nirsevimab and placebo group (overall through 360 days 
post dose) (Table 29).  A little more in the nirsevimab group, however experienced at least one AE 
within the first 1,3- or 14-days post dose (2.1%, 5.9 % and 25.8% compared to 1.5%, 5.6% and 
24.5% in the placebo group). All-over there were a lower percentage in the nirsevimab group that had 
a grade 3 event or worse (5.8% in the nirsevimab group vs. 8.4% in the placebo group), however 
there were a little higher percentage in the nirsevimab group that experienced grade 3 or worse events 
within 3- and 7-days post dose compared to placebo (0.2% and 0.3% vs. 0% and 0.2%). The 
percentage of IP-related AESI based on selected MedDRA PT codes, and IP-related skin reaction was 
also higher in the nirsevimab group; 0.6% and 0.7% vs. 0.4% and 0.6% in the placebo group.

Table 29 Overall Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Through 360 Days Post 
Dose (Melody/Study 3 [All] Safety Pool) 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All Safety Pool) the frequency of AE’s by SOC in the nirsevimab was generally 
balanced and similar to the placebo group. Only in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, 
and General disorders and administration site conditions were the frequencies a little higher (29.6% 
and 14.9% in the nirsevimab group vs. 29.2% and 14.4% in the placebo group). AE’s commonly 
reported by SOC (> 25% of subjects in the nirsevimab group and the placebo group) were Infections 
and infestations (75.1% and 77.5%, respectively); Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (29.6% 
and 29.2%, respectively); Gastrointestinal disorders (28.3% and 29.2%, respectively). AE’s by PT 
most commonly in the nirsevimab groups were; (> 10% of subjects) respiratory tract infection (41.7%

vs. 39.7%), gastroenteritis (10.8% vs. 9.1%). More predominant in the placebo group were: pyrexia 
(13.1% vs. 12.9%), nasopharyngitis (14.9% vs. 11.7%), and bronchiolitis (11.3% vs. 7.9%). 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, AE’s of grade 3 or higher severity by SOC and PT through 
360 days post dose (data not shown) were overall similar or less in the nirsevimab group compared to 
placebo. There were fewer Grade 3 events in the nirsevimab group: 5.1% vs. 7.5% in the placebo 
group and 0.4% Grade 4 events compared to 0.5% in the placebo group. Numbers were generally low. 
There were 0.3% Grade 5 events in both treatment groups). Grade 3 events were most commonly 
bronchiolitis (0.7% in the nirsevimab group vs. 1.8% in the placebo group), lower respiratory tract 
infection (0.8% vs. 1.1%), bronchitis (0.4% vs. 0.8%,) with higher frequencies in the placebo group. 
In the nirsevimab group there was a higher frequency of viral pneumonia (0.4% vs. 0.1%). Grade 4 
and 5 events were few and generally reported in one subject each in both treatment group were. In 
the nirsevimab group there were however 2 deaths (Grade 5), and 2 cases of gastroenteritis. Also, 
there were 2 Grade 4 AE’s in two subjects; congestive heart failure on day 30 in a patient with 
ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, and peripheral pulmonary stenosis and cardiopulmonary 
arrest on Day 64, secondary to pulmonary vein stenosis caused by bronchopneumonia. Both could be 
explained by their medical history 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All Safety Pool) the frequency of participants with any IP-related AE through 
360 days post dose was lower in the nirsevimab group (1.6% vs. 1.8%). Events in the nirsevimab 
group were most frequently by the SOCs; General disorders and administration site conditions (0.5% 
vs. 0.2%), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (0.6% vs.0.6%) and Nervous system disorders 
(0.3% vs. 0.1%). Most events were Grade 1-2 in severity (one Grade 3 severity event of rash in the 
nirsevimab group / investigator-assessed AESI of skin-hypersensitivity) and most commonly a 
reflection of mild reactogenicity; rash (0.3% nirsevimab vs. 0.2% placebo), hypersomnia (0.2% 
nirsevimab vs. 0 placebo), injection site pain (0.1% nirsevimab and 0% placebo) pyrexia (0.1% 
nirsevimab vs. 0.2% placebo). 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All Safety Pool) the frequency of participants with AE’s by SOC and PT in 2 or 
more subjects by time relative to dosing within 1, 3, 7, and 14 days post dose were overall balanced 
between the nirsevimab and placebo groups. There was however a trend of mild but slightly enhanced 
reactogenicity in the nirsevimab treated group compared to placebo within one day post dose, though 
they occurred infrequently: pyrexia 0.2% vs. 0.1%) and injection site reactions 0.4% vs.0%.  
In MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool, the overall the distribution of common AE’s 
resembled the MELODY/Study (ALL) Safety Pool and was balanced between the nirsevimab and 
placebo treatment groups (Table 14), with AEs by SOC most commonly reported being: Infections and 
infestations (73.6% vs. 76.3%); Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (31.0% vs. 31.2%); 
Gastrointestinal disorders (28.3% vs. 29.0%); Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (24.3% 
vs. 25.4%); and General disorders and administration site conditions (14.8% vs. 13.2%). AE’s were 
mostly Grade 1 and there were fewer Grade 3 events in the nirsevimab group (4.2% vs. 7.3%). AEs 
considered related to IP by the investigator, were mainly reflecting mild reactogenicity in the 
nirsevimab treatment group (rash (0.2% vs. 0%), injection site pain (0.1% vs. 0%), and pyrexia 
(0.1% vs. 0.3%). AE’s by time relative to dosing within one day post dose was higher in the 
nirsevimab treatment group: 1.9% vs. 0.8%.

Dose (MELODY/Study 3 [Proposed Dose] Safety Pool) 
In the overall MEDLEY population (including preterm and CLD (CHD cohorts), the distribution ≥1 AE 
through at least Day 150 (up to 14 days post dose) was balanced between nirsevimab and palivizumab 
treatment groups (Table 31). Overall, however with a little higher percentage of ≥1 Grade 3 (or higher) 
AEs in the nirsevimab group (7.2% vs. 6.6%, preterm: 3.4% vs. 3.4%, CLD/CHD: 14.4% vs. 13.3%), 
and also more deaths: 0.8% (n=5 vs. 0.3 (n=1). In the preterm and CLD/CHD cohorts there were also 
more deaths in the nirsevimab group compared to palivizumab (0.5% (2) vs. 0% and 1.4% (3) vs 
1.0% (1)).

As-treated population  
Overall, subjects with more than 1 SAE were more common in the nirsevimab group (11.1% vs. 
10.2%), also in subjects that had ≥ 1 AE or ≥ Grade 3 event (11.9% vs. 10.5%, preterm: 6.9% vs. 
5.3%, CLD/CHD: 19.2% vs. 20.4%). Overall, two subjects in the nirsevimab group (one subject each 
in the preterm and CLD (CHD cohort) had more than one AESI based on investigator assessment 
(0.3% vs. 0%) and there was also a higher percentage of subjects with more than one AESI based on 
selected MedDRA PT codes (17.6% vs. 14.1%). This difference was most evident in the CLD/CHD 
cohort where the percentage was more than double in the nirsevimab group (22.6% (47) vs. 11.2 
(11).

AEs were overall balanced between the treatment groups, with small numerical imbalances, but higher 
percentages (>1%) of subjects receiving nirsevimab with the following PT’s: pyrexia (11.6% vs. 
9.9%), viral upper respiratory tract infection (4.7% vs. 3.3%), bronchiolitis (4.4% vs. 3.0%), nasal 
congestion (6.2% vs. 4.3%), dermatitis diaper (4.2% vs. 2.0%). The pattern of distribution was 
generally similar for the preterm and CLD/CHD cohorts, however there were also higher percentage of 
the following PT’s in the nirsevimab treatment group: otitis media (2.5% (10) vs. 1.0% (2)) and nasal 
congestion (7.4% (30) vs. 5.3% (11)). In the CLD/CHD cohort there were also higher percentages of 
the following PT’s in the nirsevimab group: teething (6.3% (13) vs. 3.1% (3)), rhinitis (11.5% (24) vs. 
7.1% (7)), gastroenteritis (2.9% (6) vs. 1% (1), roseola (2.4% vs. 1.0%), rhinorrhoea (3.4% vs. 
1.0%) and eczema (3.4% vs. 1%). 
Overall, in the nirsevimab group there were more events with higher intensity by the SOC Infections 
and infestations; Grade 3 (3.3% (20) vs. 2.3% (7)), more Grade 4 (0.3% (2) vs. 0%), and more 
Grade 5 (0.5% (3) vs. 0.3% (1)). The same trend was seen in the preterm and the CLD/CHD cohorts. 
Overall, in the MEDLEY study (including preterm and CLD/CHD cohorts), IP-related AEs were few and 
balanced and fewer for nirsevimab (1.6% and 2.0%), with a little more subject by the PT agitation 
(0.5% (3) vs. 0%). Adverse by time relative to dosing (1, 3, 7, 14 days post first dose) pyrexia was 
reported up to 14 days post dose in the nirsevimab group (1 subject within day 1, 3 and 7 and 4 
subjects within day 14, 0 reports in the palivizumab group). 
Overall, in the MEDLEY study (including by preterm and CLD/ CHD cohorts), numerical imbalances for 
AE’s were generally balanced and small (including SAEs, severity). AESIs based on selected MedDRA 
PT codes were more common in the nirsevimab group, most markedly in the CLD/CHD cohort.  
Subpopulations: < 29 wGA, CLD, and CHD 
Overall, for < 29 wGA, CLD, and CHD subpopulations, the number of subjects with ≥ 1 event through 
at least 150 days post first dose were generally balanced between the two treatment groups 
(nirsevimab and palivizumab) with slightly more events in the nirsevimab group for the CHD cohort. 
There were overall more subjects in all three subpopulations that had ≥1 event of ≥Grade 3 in the 
nirsevimab group (see below). Subjects with any AE with the outcome death occurred only in the CHD 
cohort (nirsevimab 4.3% (3) vs. 3.0% (1) palivizumab. There were higher percentages of subjects with 
≥1 AESI based on selected MedDRA codes in the nirsevimab group across all subpopulations (< 29 
wGA: 18.0 % vs. 13.2%, CLD: 16.3% vs. 8.8% and CHD: 38.6% vs. 33.3%).

Table 32 Overall Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events for <29 wGA, CLD, and 
CHD Subpopulations Through at Least 150 Days Post First Dose (RSV Season 1) in MEDLEY, 
As-treated Population  
Overall, AE’s By SOC and PT were generally balanced between nirsevimab and palivizumab treatment 
groups across the subpopulations, however more predominant in the CHD subpopulation (< 29 wGA: 
72.7% (93)) vs. 73.5% (50), CLD: 63.9% (94) vs. 66.2% (45), and CHD: 85.7% (60) vs. 84.8% (28)) 
(Table 16). In the CHD subpopulations, there were higher percentages of AE’s by the SOCs:  Blood and 
lymphatic system disorders (8.6% vs. 3.0%), eye disorders (2.9% vs. 0%), Gastrointestinal disorders 
(37.1 vs. 33.3), immune system disorders (7.1% vs. 3.0%), Infections and infestations in the 
nirsevimab treatment group subpopulations (61.4% vs. 57.6%), Injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications (11.4% vs. 9.1%), investigations (15.7% vs. 12.1%), metabolism and nutrition 
disorders (11.4% vs. 3.0%), nervous system disorders (7.1% vs. 3.0% ), skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders (38.6% vs. 21.2%), surgical and medical procedures (5.7% vs. 0%). 
Adverse events by intensity (Grade 3 or more) were generally more common in the nirsevimab 
treatment group and for both treatment groups most predominantly in the CHD subpopulation; (Grade 
3; < 29 wGA: 9.4% (12) vs. 7.4% (5), CLD: 8.2% (12) vs. 5.9% (4), and CHD: 21.4% (15) vs. 18.2% 
(6). Grade 4 and Grade 5 events only occurred in the CHD cohort and There were more Grade 5 in the 
nirsevimab group (4.3% (3) vs. 3.0% (1)). By subpopulations, also, there were a trend towards more 
events (with higher intensity by the SOC Infections and infestations in the nirsevimab treatment group 
(< 29 wGA; Grade 3: 7.0% vs. 2.9%, CLD: Grade 3: 4.8% vs. 2.9%, and CHD: Grade 3: 8.6% vs. 
6.1%, Grade 4: 1.4% vs. 0 %, Grade 5: 1.4% vs. 3%).  
Overall IP-related AEs occurred infrequently with small numerical imbalances between the nirsevimab 
and palivizumab groups. The PT rash occurred only in the nirsevimab treatment group in all

subpopulations (< 29 wGA: 0.8% (1) vs. 0%, CLD: 0.7% (1) vs. 0%, and CHD: 1.4% (1) vs. 0%), 
however numbers are low. 
For AEs up to 14 days post first dose, in the preterm cohort, there were all over fewer in the 
nirsevimab group that reported at least one AE. In the CLD cohort more subjects in the nirsevimab 
group reported at least one AE within the first 3 days post dose (within 1 day: 2.0% (3) vs. 1.5% (1), 
within 3 days: 4.8% (7) vs. 1.5% (1)) compared to palivizumab. In the CHD there was no clear trend 
of AEs by time relative to dosing. 
All-together, by < 29 wGA, CLD, and CHD subpopulations, AEs were generally balanced between 
nirsevimab and palivizumab treatment groups across the subpopulations, however imbalances were 
markedly more predominant in the CHD subpopulation.  
2.6.8.5.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool there were overall more SAEs in the placebo group compared 
to nirsevimab (12.1% vs. 9.0%). By SOC there were slight numerical imbalances with more SAEs in 
the nirsevimab treatment group in the category Congenital, familial ang genetic disorders (0.2% (n=3) 
vs. 0%), ear and labyrinth disorders (1 vs. 0 subjects), general disorders and administration site 
conditions (0.6% (n=11) vs. 0.1% (n=1), metabolism and nutrition disorders (0.3% (n=5) vs. 0.1% 
(n=1), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (0.4% (n=7) vs. 0.2% (n=2). By PT, SAEs were 
most commonly for nirsevimab (vs placebo) bronchiolitis (1.6% vs 3.4%), LRTI (0.9% vs 1.3%), 
pneumonia (0.9% vs 1.3%), gastroenteritis (0.8% vs 0.4%), and bronchitis (0.7% vs 1.2%).  None of 
the SAEs was considered related to IP by the investigator.  All-over in MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety 
Pool the numbers of SAEs are small, including by PT and no meaningful trends were observed. 
In the MEDLEY study there were slightly more SAEs in the nirsevimab group compared to palivizumab 
in the overall population (11.1% vs 10.2%), including in the preterm cohort (6.9% vs. 5.3%). In the 
CLD/CHD cohort SAEs were overall more frequent, and slightly more in the palivizumab group (20.4% 
vs. 19.2%). Generally, numbers were small, but of note, there was a higher frequency of SAEs in the 
nirsevimab group in the SOC of Infections and infestations (7.2% and 4.3%) including in the preterm 
and CLD/CHD cohort. By PT, SAE’s more frequent in the nirsevimab group were most commonly 
bronchiolitis (1.8% (11) vs. 1.0% (3)) and gastroenteritis (0.8% (5) vs. 0.3% (1)). Also, here none of 
the SAEs was considered by the investigator to be IP-related.  
In the < 29 wGA, CLD, and CHD Subpopulations, the frequency of SAEs was generally similar between 
the nirsevimab and palivizumab groups in each subpopulation, but overall, markedly higher for the 
CHD subgroup; < 29 wGA: (13.3% (17) vs. 13.2% (9)), CLD: (12.2% (18) vs. 14.7% (10)), and CHD: 
34.3% (24) vs. 30.3% (10)). There was overall a higher frequency by the SOC Infections and 
infestations in the nirsevimab treatment group compared to palivizumab: (< 29 wGA: 10.2% vs. 5.9%, 
CLD: 9.5% vs. 7.4%, CHD: 17.1% vs. 9.1%). In the nirsevimab CHD treated subgroup, particularly 
SAEs by the SOCs: Infections and infestations, Cardiac disorders, and Congenital, familial and genetic 
disorders were more frequent compared to Palivizumab. None of the SAEs was considered by the 
investigator to be IP-related. 
All-over in the MEDLEY study percentages of SAEs were balanced between nirsevimab and 
palivizumab, however more frequent in the CLD/CHD cohort and by subgroup SAEs were also markedly 
higher for the CHD subgroup, which can be explained by underlying complex medical conditions in 
these cohorts.  
Overall, there was a higher percentage of SAEs the SOC infections and infestations in the nirsevimab 
group.

In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, overall, the percentage of deaths up to 360 days post dose in 
the two treatment arms (nirsevimab 0.3% (n=5) vs. placebo 0.3% (n=3)) was identical (study days of 
death were 26-343). In the MEDLEY study, there were 6 deaths and more deaths reported through at 
least 150 days post dose in the nirsevimab treated group (nirsevimab 0.8% (n=5) vs.  0.3% (1) in the

palivizumab group) (study days of deaths 19-338 days). None of the deaths was considered related to 
IP by the investigator.  
Three deaths occurred within 3 weeks; In study 3: one death after 26 days (nosocomial pneumonia, e. 
coli meningitis), In the MEDLEY study (CLD/CHD cohort) two deaths after 19 days (pneumonia in an 
infant with medical history of atrial septal defect, coarctation of the aorta, and patent ductus arteriosus 
and one heart failure in an infant with medical history of cerebral ischemia, wound infection fungal, and 
congenital pneumonia and ongoing medical history included congenital pulmonary valve atresia with 
VSD, congenital arterial malformation, congenital pulmonary artery anomaly, cardiovascular 
insufficiency, and hypoxia. Congestive). Two deaths had an unknown cause, one in Study 3 (day 123) 
and one in the MELODY study (day 140).  No concomitant medications were reported prior to study 
enrolment, besides a hepatitis B vaccine on day of birth. The subject died at home of unknown causes. 
An autopsy was not performed. An undiagnosed chronic condition given a history of failure to thrive, 
recent hospitalisation, recurrent vomiting, recurrent hypoglycaemia, and anaemia prior to death was 
suspected by the investigator. Two additional deaths occurred after day 360. 
Other significant events 
Skin Reactions and Skin Hypersensitivity Reactions 
All-over, in the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool the distribution of any skin reaction was balanced 
between nirsevimab and placebo treatment groups (30.3% (592/1955) vs. 30.4% (295/970), with 
generalised skin reactions slightly higher in the nirsevimab treatment group (15.4% (301/1955) vs. 
14.3% (139/970)) and more skin reactions accompanied by any systemic symptoms (9.7% vs. 8.8%). 
Also, there were a little higher percentage of subjects in the nirsevimab group that had been exposed 
to vaccines within 14 days of onset of skin reaction. In the nirsevimab treatment group there were 
higher percentages of the following (>0.5% difference): skin reactions that were erythematous (15.5% 
vs. 14.3%) and the locations of the skin reaction were: head (7.1% vs. 5.1%), face (17.4% vs. 
15.5%), arms (11.5% vs. 9.4%), hands (6.0% vs. 4.8%), legs (11.0% vs. 10.0%), Buttocks/groin 
(3.1% vs. 2.1%). 
In the MEDLEY study there were a higher percentage of any skin reaction in the nirsevimab treatment 
group compared to palivizumab (18.4% (113/614) compared to 15.1% (46/304)), which included both 
generalised (8.1% vs. 5.9%) and symmetrical (7.8% vs. 6.6%) skin distribution. Skin reactions were 
mainly erythematous (8.8% vs. 8.2%) and maculo-papular (5.4% vs. 3.9%). There were also more 
skin reactions that were accompanied by systemic symptoms (5.0% vs. 3.3%), mainly fever (4.9% vs. 
3.3%).  
Generally, in the MELODY/Study 3 (All Safety Pool), numerical imbalances between nirsevimab and 
placebo treatment groups were small, with no meaningful trends. In the MEDLEY study there were 
more skin reactions in the nirsevimab treatment group. 
New Onset Chronic Diseases 
An NOCD was defined as a newly diagnosed medical condition of chronic, ongoing nature observed 
after receipt of the IP and assessed as medically significant by the investigator.

Table 35 Treatment-Emergent New Onset Chronic Disease by System Organ Class and 
Preferred Term though 360 Days Post Dose (MELODY/Study 3 [Proposed Dose] Safety Pool) 
Overall, the percentage of NOCDs was low in the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool and the 
MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool, occurring in 0.3% (5) and (< 0.1% (1)) respectively in 
the nirsevimab group and (0.5% (4)) and 6 (0.6% (6)) subjects in the placebo group. In the MEDLEY 
study NOCDs occurred more frequent in the nirsevimab group (0.3% vs. 0 %).  All together NOCD 
were very infrequent and in no cases where they considered to be related to IP by the investigator.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest by Investigator Assessment 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, AESIs (by SOC and PT) based on investigator assessments 
were infrequent, but comparable between nirsevimab and placebo treatment groups (0.3% (6) vs. 
0.3% (3)). Most common was rash in both groups (0.2%). All events were assessed as Grade 1 in 
severity with the exception of one event of rash in the nirsevimab group from the MELODY study 
reported as a Grade 3 severity (day 6 post dose, 20 days duration) but was deemed late for the 
expected onset of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction. There were no events of immune complex 
disease reported. Also, in the MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool, AESI’s by investigator 
assessment was low but comparable (0.2% (3)) subjects in the nirsevimab group vs. 0% in the 
placebo group. In the MEDLEY study there was an overall higher percentage of AESI’s in the 
nirsevimab treatment group (0.3% (2) vs. 0) including in the preterm cohort (0.2% (1) vs. 0) and in 
the CLD/CHD cohort (0.5% (1) vs. 0%).

All-over numbers are low for AESI’s by investigator assessment, and there is no convincing trend 
towards more AESI’s of skin hypersensitivity reactions in nirsevimab treated subject 
Adverse Events of Special Interest by MedDRA Preferred Term 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, AESI’s by PT was generally balanced between the treatment 
groups (25.7% in nirsevimab vs. 26.2% in placebo, with slight numerical imbalances, but no clinically 
meaningful trends, including for Hypersensitivity events including anaphylactic reactions (25.1% vs. 
25.9%). For thrombocytopenia however, there was a slightly higher percentage in the nirsevimab 
group, though numbers were small (1.0% vs. 0.5%). The trend was the same for the MELODY/Study 3 
(Proposed Dose) Safety Pool. 
In the MEDLEY study AESIs were overall balanced between nirsevimab and palivizumab groups (17.6% 
vs. 14.1%), but higher in the nirsevimab group for hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis (16.9% vs.  
13.8%) for thrombocytopenia (0.8% vs. 0.3%). In the preterm cohort there was 1 case of 
thrombocytopenia (0.2% vs. 0% in placebo). In the CLD/CHD cohort the percentage of total numbers 
of AESI’s was double compared to palivizumab (22.6% vs. 11.2%), including for hypersensitivity 
(including anaphylaxis) (21.2% vs. 10.2%) and thrombocytopenia (1.9% vs. 1.0%). 
2.6.8.6.  Laboratory findings 
Overall, laboratory data was sparse. In the MELODY study, laboratory data was collected on 49 
subjects (32 in the nirsevimab group and 17 in the placebo group) where haematology, hepatic, and 
renal chemistry parameters were registered. Shifts ≥ 2 toxicity grades in haematology parameters 
were reported for 1 subject in the nirsevimab group (and 0 subjects in the placebo group) and no 
worsening for platelets specifically, bearing in mind that thrombocytopenia was included as a potential 
risk due to post-approval reports of severe thrombocytopenia in use of Synagis, a mAb with a similar 
mechanism of action as nirsevimab.  Grade ≥ 3 toxicity for bilirubin was overall balanced in both 
nirsevimab and placebo groups (18.8% vs. 17.6%) and shifts ≥ 2 toxicity grades were evenly 
distributed between treatment groups. Also, no Grade ≥ 3 toxicity or shifts of ≥ 2 grades in toxicity 
were reported liver transaminases, and no creatinine values of Grade ≥ 3 toxicity reported.  
In the MEDLEY study, clinical data included data on 33 Japanese subjects (24 in the nirsevimab group 
and 9 in the palivizumab group). one subject in the nirsevimab group had a Grade 3 haemoglobin 
toxicity which also represented a 2-grade shift from baseline, reported as an AE of iron deficiency 
anaemia (Grade 2 nonserious), onset Day 160, and treated with iron supplementation with resolution 
of anaemia after a duration of 170 days For bilirubin, Grade ≥ 3 toxicity was higher in the palivizumab 
group (77.8% [7/9] vs. 50.0% [12/24], including fewer Grade 3 (20.8%) and 4 (29.2%) bilirubin 
toxicity compared to Palivizumab (grade 3: 22.2%, Grade 4: 55.6%. Two subjects (10.5%) in the 
nirsevimab group (preterm cohort) had ≥ 2 grade worsening in bilirubin vs. 0 subjects in the 
palivizumab group. Both subjects had a reported ongoing medical history of jaundice and shifts from 
Grade 0 (at baseline) to 4. Otherwise no clinically meaningful trends were reported.   
Laboratory AEs were reported by SOCs for the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool and MEDLEY study. 
Numbers were generally low and balanced between treatment groups.  Overall, there were two reports 
of acute kidney injury in the nirsevimab treatment groups, one in the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety 
Pool and one in the MEDLEY Study. In both cases there were concurrent severe infection. Both events 
were considered unrelated to IP by the investigator: Subject 1 had an acute kidney injury (bilateral 
pneumonia and nosocomial sepsis concurrently) Grade 3 nonserious with onset Day 87, with bilateral 
pulmonary vein stenosis Day 97 with cardiac failure and cardiac arrest preceding the acute kidney 
injury. The outcome was fatal. Subject 2 (CHD/CLD cohort) had a reported medical history of Down 
syndrome, atrio-ventricular septal defect, and subclinical hypothyroidism. A Grade 2 nonserious AE of 
acute kidney injury was reported on Day 54 concurrently with a Grade 4 SAE of septic shock during a 
hospitalisation for cardiac failure complicated by nosocomial pneumonia and sepsis. The subject died of 
cardiogenic shock on Day 66.

According to the CSRs of Study 3 MEDLEY and MELODY vital signs ((temperature, blood pressure, 
respiratory rate, and heart rate measurements) were collected at screening/day of dosing and during 
follow-up period.  
2.6.8.7.  Safety in special populations 
1)  Effect of Age 
All together 358 subjects received nirsevimab in MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool (out of 533 subjects 
that were included in the subgroup analyses for neonates (< 28 Days at Randomisation)). All 
nirsevimab-exposed neonates received the proposed dose. Overall, the distribution of AEs was 
comparable between the two treatment groups, but slightly more subjects in the nirsevimab group 
reported at least one serious AE (14.5% vs. 12.0%) and at least one serious and/or ≥ Grade 3 severity 
event (15.1% vs. 12.6%). Also, there was a higher percentage of subjects in the nirsevimab group 
reporting at least one AESI based on investigators assessment (0.6% (n=2) vs. 0%). For age of 
randomisation (≤ 3.0 Months, > 3.0 to ≤ 6.0 Months, and> 6.0 Months) there were no apparent 
discrepancies with regards to distribution of AE’s.  
In the MEDLEY study, the distribution of AEs was generally balanced between the treatment arms for 
the subgroups of ages ≤ 3-months and > 3.0 to ≤ 6.0 Months. However, there was a higher percentage 
AEs in subjects in the > 6-month age subgroup in the nirsevimab treatment arm (68.7% (46/103) vs. 
58.3 (21/36). There was also a higher percentage of ≥1 serious or ≥Grade 3 event (9.0% (6/67) vs. 
2.8% (1/36) and 7.5% (5/67) in the nirsevimab group that had ≥ AESI based on selected MedDRA 
codes. There were 9.0% (6/67) vs. 0% that had ≥ 1 event related to COVID-19.   
2)  Effect of Body Weight 
Infants < 2.5 kg on Day 1 had the highest nirsevimab exposures based on mg/kg body weight. In the 
MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety pool study, the distribution of AE’s was generally balanced between the 
treatment groups, apart from 2 IP-related events in the nirsevimab group (1.0%: decreased appetite 
and petechiae vs. 0/90 in the placebo group. In the MEDLEY study, even though there were fewer 
subjects reporting more than one AE in the nirsevimab group (64.4% vs. 73.3%, there were a higher 
percentage of subjects that reported ≥ 1 event of ≥Grade 3: 13.6% (8/89) compared to 0% in the 
Palivizumab group, and more SAEs were reported; 18.6% (11/59) in the nirsevimab group vs. 10.0% 
(3/30) in the Palivizumab group. Also, one death occurred in the < 2.5 kg on Day 1 subgroup in the 
nirsevimab group (PT: bronchiolitis). 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool and the MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool, 
subjects who had weight on Day 1 < 5 kg, AEs were overall comparable in both treatment groups in < 
5 kg and ≥ 5 kg on Day 1 weight groups. Grade 3 events were slightly higher in the placebo group 
(weight < 5 kg: 12.3% in the nirsevimab group vs. 17.2% in placebo, weight ≥ 5 kg: 7.8% in the 
nirsevimab group vs. 9.8 in placebo) In the nirsevimab group, subjects who had weight on Day 1 < 5 
kg, there was a slightly higher percentage of subjects with an AESI based on investigators assessment: 
0.3% (n=3) vs 0% in the placebo group and in subjects who had weight on Day 1 ≥ 5 kg there were 
two grade 5 severity AE’s (death). 
In the MEDLEY study in infants, weight group ≥2.5 kg to < 5 kg the distribution was overall balanced, 
however a higher percentage in the nirsevimab group reported ≥ AESI based on selected MedDRA PT 
codes (19.9% in the nirsevimab group vs. 11.8% in the palivizumab group). In the weight group ≥ 5 
kg more in the nirsevimab group reported ≥ AE (68.0% vs. 62.3%). Also, more in the nirsevimab 
group compared to palivizumab reported ≥ 1 event of ≥Grade 3: 6.3 (17/269) % vs. 3.8% (5/130), and 
SAEs: 10.0% (27/269) vs.  5.4% (7/130).

Subjects who Received Replacement Dose Following Bypass Surgery 
In the MEDLEY study subjects 8 in the nirsevimab group., and 7 subjects in palivizumab group received 
a replacement dose In RSV Season 1 following bypass surgery. No AESIs or skin hypersensitivity 
reactions were reported.  
Nirsevimab and Vaccines 
No safety concerns were anticipated for with regards to paediatric vaccination schemes and passive 
immunization with nirsevimab. The safety of 6 prespecified vaccine groups (tuberculosis vaccine; 
influenza vaccine; measles/mumps/rubella/varicella vaccine; rotavirus vaccine; polyvalent DPT-
containing vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine) when co-administered within ± 7 or ± 14 days of 
nirsevimab/placebo was however evaluated in the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool and the 
MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool.   Overall few subjects received a vaccination 
concomitantly to nirsevimab or placebo (5.9% vs. 6.0% ± 7 days of IP dosing and 20.8% vs. 22.0% 
within ± 14 days of IP dosing), most commonly polyvalent DPT-containing vaccine, pneumococcal 
vaccine, and rotavirus vaccine.

Table 36 Vaccine Exposure (MELODY/Study 3 [All] Safety Pool) 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, there were higher percentages of subjects in the nirsevimab 
group vs. the placebo group that developed URTI (by PT) in proximity to IP dosing:  Vaccination within 
7 days before or after dosing, AE within 7 days Rotavirus vaccination: 3.3% (2/60) vs. 0% ; 
vaccination within 14 days before or after IP dosing, AE within 7 days Polyvalent DPT-containing 
vaccination: 4.7% (14/297) vs. 3.3% (5/151), pneumococcal vaccination: 4.0% (10/249) vs. 2.3%

after IP dosing, AE within 28 days: polyvalent DPT-containing vaccination: 20.7% (18/87) vs. 11.9% 
(5/42), Pneumococcal vaccination: 21.4% (15/70) vs. 9.4% (3/32), Rotavirus vaccination: 16.7% 
(10/60) vs. 0%, Tuberculosis vaccination: 28.6% (2/7) vs. 0% ; vaccination within 14 days before or 
after IP dosing, AE within 28 days: polyvalent DPT-containing vaccination: 23.6% (70/297) vs. 19.2% 
(29/151), pneumococcal vaccination: 22.9% (57/249) vs. 13.1% (17/130), Rotavirus vaccination: 
21.4% (47/220) vs. 10.2% (11/108), Influenza vaccine: 19.2% (5/26) vs. 16.7% (2/12).   
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Not applicable as Nirsevimab is intended for use in infants. 
Overdose 
Only one case of overdose was reported from the clinical trials (MEDLEY) where an infant accidently 
received double the dose according to weight the infant weighed 4.97 kg (100 mg IM instead of 50 mg 
IM). No related AE’s were reported. It is acknowledged that the treatment is symptomatic in case of 
overdose. The applicant has no anticipation of drug abuse, withdrawal and rebound effects or effects 
on mental ability which is agreed. 
2.6.8.8.  Immunological events 
Antibody-dependent Enhancement 
No safety concern for development of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) after nirsevimab was 
disclosed through non-clinical studies (incl. RSV challenge study in a cotton rat model of RSV 
infection), however as the rats were mature, and exposed to RSV infection at times of maximal 
circulating nirsevimab concentrations, the translability of the finding to highly immature infants is 
unknown.  
In the pivotal studies, infants with prior RSV or RSV infection, receipt of palivizumab or other RSV mAb 
or any RSV vaccine, including maternal RSV vaccination and children with any history of LRTI or active 
LRTI prior to, or at the time of, randomisation were excluded from the pivotal studies. No cases of ADE 
have been reported in the safety data, however in the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, generally, 
numbers of AE’s of grade 3 or higher severity by SOC and PT through 360 days post dose are low. 
Immunogenicity and Safety 
Overall, the percentages of subjects that were ADA-positive in the 3 pivotal safety studies were low 
(ADA positivity was defined as a titre of ≥ 50 for nirsevimab). In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, 
5.9% (110/1880) of subjects in the nirsevimab group and 2.3% (22/942) of subjects in the placebo 
group were ADA positive to nirsevimab post baseline through day 361. In the MEDLEY study, numbers 
were small:  2.1% (12/581) subjects in the nirsevimab group and 5.2% (15/286) in the palivizumab 
group were ADA-positive (90% of subjects had samples available for ADA assessment at Day 151 and 
38% of subjects had available samples at Day 361). 
Overall, no safety concerns related to ADA were raised from safety data from the MELODY/Study 3 
(All) Safety Pool or MEDLEY study (including the preterm and CLH/CHD cohorts). No related 
immunogenicity (IP-related AE, investigator-assessed skin hypersensitivity reaction, or AESI) was 
observed in ADA-positive subjects, including no immune complex diseases. 
2.6.8.9.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Due to the mode of action of nirsevimab, no altered PK/PD relevant to safety is expected from drug-
interactions. Increased adverse events of URTI was observed with nirsevimab vaccine co-
administration compared with placebo vaccine co-administration.

2.6.8.10.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuations of trial product were not evaluated in Study 3 and in the MELODY study, as subjects 
only received a single dose. This is considered acceptable. In the MEDLEY study one subject (0.2%), a 
5.2-month-old male infant in the nirsevimab group discontinued the trial permanently on Day 91 of 
RSV season 1 due to a Grade 1 rash assessed as a skin hypersensitivity event (AESI) after receiving a 
placebo dose and was resolved the same day. The infant had mistakenly received nirsevimab on Day 
31 of RSV Season 1 and had no detectable ADA to nirsevimab post-baseline. Overall, 8.1% (n=50) of 
subjects in the MEDLEY study discontinued due to various reasons (death (n=5), lost to follow-up 
(n=6), withdrawal of consent (n=24), Covid-pandemic (n=11), other (n=3). In the Palivizumab 
treatment group, 7.1% (n=22) discontinued, hereof none due to adverse events. The number of 
discontinuations in the MEDLEY study were low.  
2.6.8.11.  Post marketing experience 
None available. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Methods 
The preliminary safety evaluation was based on safety data from three pivotal studies (Study 3, 
MELODY and MEDLEY) on the use of nirsevimab (50 mg or 100 mg single IM dose) in 2569 infants in 
their first RSV season. The three studies included very and moderately preterm infants born ≥ 29 to < 
35 wGA, term and late preterm infants born ≥ 35 wGA, and infants at higher risk for severe RSV, 
including preterm infants born < 35 wGA and infants with CLD/CHD. Supportive safety data from 
Study 1 and Study 2 was also submitted.  
Safety data in term and preterm infants born ≥ 29 wGA with a safety follow-up of 360 days post dose 
from MELODY and study 3 were analysed in 2 pools: 
The MELODY/study 3 (All) safety pool included pooled data of all dosed participants from Study 3 
and the MELODY primary cohort ((N = 2925 dosed with either nirsevimab [n = 1955] or placebo [n = 
970]) and a subpopulation  
The MELODY/Study 3 (proposed dose) safety pool that include pooled data of subjects receiving 
the proposed dose (50 mg for infants weighing < 5 kg or 100 mg for infants weighing ≥ 5 kg at the 
time of dosing). In study 3 those weighing < 5 kg at the time of dosing and the MELODY primary 
cohort (N = 2338 dosed with either nirsevimab [n = 1559] or placebo [n = 779]).  
The MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool was used to evaluate the AE profile, ADRs, and potential risks 
comprising the largest pool of placebo-controlled data for nirsevimab, which is acceptable for this 
safety evaluation.  
Data from the palivizumab-controlled MEDLEY study in infants at higher risk for severe RSV disease 
(including subpopulations of extremely preterm infants born < 29 wGA and infants with CLD or CHD) 
through at least 150 days post dose was evaluated separately due to differences in study design, which 
is acceptable. Overall the safety evaluation was appropriately standardised across the studies and 
adverse events coded using the MedDRA version 23.1, evaluations including treatment-emergent AEs, 
SAEs, discontinuations, NOCDs, AESIs, and skin reactions.  
Dispositions, baseline demographics and characteristics of the enrolled subjects were considered 
acceptable for all 3 studies. 
Exposure 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool subjects received a single dose of nirsevimab (n=1955) or 
placebo (n=970). In the nirsevimab group, 70.4% (1377) received a 50 mg dose and 29.6% (578) 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 119/138 
 
 
 
received a 100 mg dose. In study 3 there were to subjects that incorrectly received nirsevimab and is 
included in the safety analysis. In the MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool group, 62.9% 
(981) in the nirsevimab group received 50 mg and 37.1% (578) received 100 mg. In the MEDLEY 
study, a total of 918 subjects (nirsevimab (n=614) and palivizumab (n=304) were dosed.  Almost 90% 
of subjects received all 5 planned doses (nirsevimab:100.0% received at least one active dose; 
palivizumab: 90.1% received at least 5 active doses). All-over the exposure data was considered 
appropriate. 
Subjects from the MELODY/Study 3 (all) Safety pool was followed for 360 days and an additional 
follow-up is ongoing. The Primary analysis was complete when subjects in the MELODY primary cohort 
had been followed up through DAY 361. Subjects in the MEDLEY study were followed through DAY 150 
post dose (1st RSV season) and an additional follow up is ongoing. The Primary analysis was complete 
when all subjects completed follow-up through DAY 151.  
Adverse events 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, overall, the safety profile was acceptable with no safety 
concerns. Common AE’s through 360 days post dose, were similar between the nirsevimab and placebo 
treatment group. Numerical imbalances with regards to AEs within the first 1,3- or 14-days post dose 
and severity of AE’s were small and not of concern. 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All Safety Pool) the frequency of AE’s by SOC in the nirsevimab was generally 
balanced and similar to the placebo group. AE’s commonly reported by SOC (> 25% of subjects in the 
nirsevimab group and the placebo group) were Infections and infestations (75.1% and 77.5%); Skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders (29.6% and 29.2%); Gastrointestinal disorders (28.3% and 
29.2%). AE’s by PT most commonly in the nirsevimab groups were; (> 10% of subjects) respiratory 
tract infection (41.7% vs. 39.7%) and gastroenteritis (10.8% vs. 9.1%).  AE’s of grade 3 or higher 
severity by SOC and PT through 360 days post dose were overall similar or less in the nirsevimab 
group compared to placebo. In the nirsevimab group there was a higher frequency of viral pneumonia 
(0.4% vs. 0.1%).. in all cases of viral pneumonia (8 subjects in the nirsevimab group) RSV as the 
causative pathogen was excluded based on central or local RSV test. Grade 4 and 5 events were few 
and generally reported in one subject each in both treatment groups. Grade 4 and 5 AEs when 
categorised by PTs in both treatment groups were reported in one subject each, apart from death (2 
subjects in the nirsevimab group) and gastroenteritis (2 subjects in the nirsevimab group). Two Grade 
4 AE’s in two subjects were resolved; congestive heart failure on day 30 and cardiopulmonary arrest 
on Day 64, both could be explained by their medical history. The frequency of participants with any IP-
related AE through 360 days post dose was lower in the nirsevimab group (1.6% vs. 1.8%), mostly 
Grade 1-2 in severity and most commonly a reflection of mild reactogenicity. The frequency of 
participants with AE’s by SOC and PT in 2 or more subjects by time relative to dosing within 1, 3, 7, 
and 14 days post dose were overall balanced between the nirsevimab and placebo groups. There was 
however a trend of mild but slightly enhanced reactogenicity in the nirsevimab treated group compared 
to placebo within one day post dose, though they occurred infrequently: pyrexia 0.2% vs. 0.1%) and 
injection site reactions 0.4% vs.0%.  In MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool, the 
overall the distribution of AE’s resembled the MELODY/Study (ALL) Safety Pool and was balanced 
between the nirsevimab and placebo treatment groups. 
In the MEDLEY study (including preterm and CLD /CHD cohorts), the distribution ≥1 AE through at 
least Day 151 (up to 14 days post dose) was balanced between nirsevimab and palivizumab treatment 
groups. Overall, however with a little higher percentage of ≥1 Grade 3 (or higher) AE’s in the 
nirsevimab group (7.2% vs. 6.6%, preterm: 3.4% vs. 3.4%, CLD/CHD: 14.4% vs. 13.3%), AEs were 
overall balanced between the treatment groups.  The pattern of distribution was generally similar for 
the preterm and CLD/CHD cohorts. Overall, in the nirsevimab group there were more events with 
higher intensity by the SOC Infections and infestations; Grade 3 (3.3% vs. 2.3%), more Grade 4 
(0.3% vs. 0%), and more Grade 5 (0.5% vs. 0.3%) events. The same trend was seen in the preterm 
and the CLD/CHD subpopulations. Overall (including preterm and CLD/CHD cohorts), IP-related AEs 
were few and balanced with generally lower percentages for nirsevimab. For adverse events by time 
relative to dosing (1, 3, 7, 14 days post first dose) pyrexia was reported up to 14 days post dose in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022

nirsevimab group (1 subject within day 1, 3 and 7 and 4 subjects within day 14, 0 reports in the 
palivizumab group). 
Overall, for < 29 wGA, CLD, and CHD subpopulations, AE’s were generally balanced between 
nirsevimab and palivizumab treatment groups across the subpopulations, however numerical 
imbalances were markedly more predominant in the CHD subpopulation. AE’s by SOC and PT were 
frequent and generally also balanced between nirsevimab and palivizumab treatment groups across 
the subpopulations (< 29 wGA: 72.7% vs. 73.5%, CLD: 63.9% vs. 66.2%, and CHD: 85.7% vs. 
84.8%). In the CHD subpopulations, there were higher percentages of AE’s by the SOCs in the 
nirsevimab treatment group:  Blood and lymphatic system disorders (8.6% vs. 3.0%), eye disorders 
(2.9% vs. 0%), Gastrointestinal disorders (37.1 vs. 33.3), immune system disorders (7.1% vs. 3.0%), 
Infections and infestations subpopulations (61.4% vs. 57.6%), Injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications (11.4% vs. 9.1%), investigations (15.7% vs. 12.1%), metabolism and nutrition 
disorders (11.4% vs. 3.0%), nervous system disorders (7.1% vs. 3.0% ), skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders (38.6% vs. 21.2%), surgical and medical procedures (5.7% vs. 0%). It is 
acknowledged that overall, in the CHD subpopulation in the MEDLEY study the percentage of subjects 
with any AE was similar in the nirsevimab (85.7%) and palivizumab (84.8%) groups. Also, it is noted 
that the 95% CIs for the proportions of adverse events by SOC are wide and overlapping and generally 
similar between the treatment groups. Moreover, there was a higher incidence of cardiac failure 
reported in the medical history in the nirsevimab group (18.6% vs. 9.1%) compared to palivizumab 
group, indicative of more severe disease in the nirsevimab group at baseline.   
Some of the numerical differences, can arguable be attributed to incidental events, with no convincing 
trend suggestive of a safety signal that could potentially be an issue of concern. 
Subjects with more than one AESI occurred more commonly in the nirsevimab group across all 
subpopulations. Adverse events by intensity (Grade 3 or more) were generally more common in the 
nirsevimab treatment group and for both treatment groups most predominantly in the CHD 
subpopulation. Overall, in the MEDLEY study (also by < 29 wGA, CLD, and CHD subpopulations), there 
is a trend of slightly more events with higher intensity by the SOC Infections and infestations in the 
nirsevimab treatment group.  
A review of ≥Grade 3 events in SOC Infections and infestations in 25 subjects the nirsevimab treatment 
group was carried out. None of the events were assessed related to nirsevimab. The cases included 7 
subjects in CLD subpopulation, 8 subjects in CHD subpopulation, 10 subjects in the Preterm cohort (24 
– 36 weeks at gestation), 9 subjects in the < 29 wGA subpopulation (6 subjects in CLD subpopulation, 
3 subjects in the Preterm Cohort with gestational age < 29 weeks). All cases occurred at between > 14 
days – 260 days post nirsevimab administration.  
It is acknowledged and agreed that the slightly more events with higher intensity by the SOC 
Infections and infestations in the nirsevimab treatment group can to some extent be explained by the 
underlying medical conditions and that the higher incidence of congestive heart failure at baseline in 
the CHD subpopulation may have contributed to the higher frequency of infections.  
However, it is noted that in the < 29 wGA group 3,9% out of 7% of Grade 3 cases were the PT 
bronchiolitis (1.5% in the Palivizumab) group. The same was not observed in the CLD/CHD groups, 
however no obvious causative role of nirsevimab can be determined in this regard. No changes are 
required for the proposed SmPC 
Serious adverse events, deaths, and other significant events 
Deaths 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, overall the percentage of deaths up to 360 days post dose in 
the two treatment arms (nirsevimab 0.3% (n=5) vs. placebo 0.3% (n=3)) was identical (study days of 
death were 26-343). In the MEDLEY study, there were 6 deaths and more deaths reported through at 
least 150 days post dose in the nirsevimab treated group (nirsevimab 0.8% (n=5) vs.  0.3% (1) in the 
palivizumab group) (study days of deaths 19-338 days). None of the deaths was considered related to 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 121/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IP by the investigator.  Three deaths occurred within 3 weeks; In study 3: one death after 26 days, In 
the MEDLEY study (CLD/CHD cohort) two deaths after 19 days. Two deaths had an unknown cause, 
one in Study 3 (day 123) and one in the MELODY study (day 140). None of the events were likely 
related to nirsevimab exposure.. Overall no safety concerns are raised from the deaths reported in this 
infant population. There was no suspected causality to the IP exposure and in most cases, there were 
complex medical conditions prior to death. It is unclear whether the overall rates of fatal events are 
similar to the background death rate expected in this population.  A literature review of expected 
background incidences was provided in order to clarify whether the observed deaths reflect the 
expected background incidences in the respective populations, including those subjects with pulmonal 
affections/ pneumonia in the CLD/CHD cohort. Out of 2569 subjects dosed with nirsevimab in the 
pivotal studies, 10 deaths occurred through Day 361 compared with 4 deaths in the comparator arms. 
Of note, there was a 2:1 randomisation in all three pivotal trials. All the deaths reported in the studies 
were considered as not related to study treatment by the investigator. Some of the deaths occurred in 
countries where the neonatal mortality is relatively higher compared to other countries that were 
included in the pivotal studies. Causes of death were also considered to be related to e.g. frequent 
causes of death in those countries, e.g. gastroenteritis and diarrhoea. Hence, there is no concern that 
nirsevimab is associated with an increased mortality rate. 
Serious Adverse Events 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool there were overall more SAEs in the placebo group compared 
to nirsevimab (placebo 12.1% vs. nirsevimab 9.0%). By SOC there were slight numerical imbalances 
with more SAEs in the nirsevimab treatment group in the category Congenital, familial ang genetic 
disorders (0.2% vs. 0%), ear and labyrinth disorders (1 vs. 0 subjects), general disorders and 
administration site conditions (0.6% vs. 0.1%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (0.3 vs. 0.1%), 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (0.4% vs. 0.2%).  By PT, SAEs were most commonly 
for nirsevimab (vs placebo) bronchiolitis (1.6% vs 3.4%), LRTI (0.9% vs 1.3%), pneumonia (0.9% vs 
1.3%), gastroenteritis (0.8% vs 0.4%), and bronchitis (0.7% vs 1.2%). None of the SAEs was 
considered related to IP by the investigator.  No meaningful trends of concern for serious adverse 
events were observed. 
In the MEDLEY study there were overall slightly more SAEs in the nirsevimab group compared to 
palivizumab (11.1% vs 10.2%), including in the preterm cohort (6.9% vs. 5.3%). In the CLD/CHD 
cohort SAEs were more frequent, and slightly more in the palivizumab group (20.4% vs. 19.2%). 
Generally, percentages of SAEs were balanced between nirsevimab and palivizumab, however more 
frequent in the CLD/CHD cohort and by subpopulations (< 29 wGA, CLD, and CHD). SAEs were also 
markedly higher for the CHD subgroup (< 29 wGA: 13.3% vs. 13.2%, CLD: 12.2% vs. 14.7%, and 
CHD: 34.3% vs. 30.3%, which can be explained by underlying complex medical conditions in these 
cohorts.  Overall there was a higher percentage of SAEs in the SOC infections and infestations in the 
nirsevimab group (overall 7.2% and 4.3%, subpopulations < 29 wGA: 10.2% vs. 5.9%, CLD: 9.5% vs. 
7.4%, CHD: 17.1% vs. 9.1%).  . None of the SAEs was considered by the investigator to be IP-related. 
It is acknowledged that in the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, the most frequent SAEs occurred in 
the SOC of Infections and infestations, with a lower incidence in the nirsevimab group compared to 
placebo group (6.9% vs. 10.1%) while in MEDLEY the incidence of SAEs in the SOC of Infections and 
infestations was higher in the nirsevimab group compared with palivizumab for the overall population 
(7.2% vs. 4.3%). The incidence of SAEs in this SOC was higher in the CLD/CHD cohort than in the 
preterm cohort, which can arguably be ascribed to more severe disease baseline in the nirsevimab 
treatment group. This was also reflected in the review of 30 SAE’s for SOC Infections and infestations 
for subjects in MEDLEY in the nirsevimab group who experienced ≥ Grade 3 events in the (see 
assessment of responses to Q124). No specific safety concerns with regards to added risk of infections 
in nirsevimab use is raised. 
Other significant events 
- 
Skin Reactions and Skin Hypersensitivity Reactions 
All-over, in the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool the distribution of any skin reaction was balanced 
between nirsevimab and placebo treatment groups (30.3% vs. 30.4%), with generalised skin reactions 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 122/138 
 
 
 
slightly higher in the nirsevimab treatment group (15.4% vs. 14.3%) and more skin reactions 
accompanied by any systemic symptoms (9.7% vs. 8.8%). Also, there were a little higher percentage 
of subjects in the nirsevimab group that had been exposed to vaccines within 14 days of onset of skin 
reaction.  It is acknowledged that the percentage of subjects with generalized skin reaction is a by-
subject analysis over the entire 360-day post dose reporting period and also that a subject may have 
had multiple skin reactions. The between-group differences are small for each location (≤ 2.1%), and 
are not clinically meaningful.  
In the MEDLEY study there were also higher percentage of any skin reaction in the nirsevimab 
treatment group compared to palivizumab (18.4% compared to 15.1%), which included both 
generalised (8.1% vs. 5.9%) and symmetrical (7.8% vs. 6.6%) skin distribution. There were also more 
skin reactions that were accompanied by systemic symptoms (5.0% vs. 3.3%), mainly fever (4.9% vs. 
3.3%).  
Generally, in the MELODY/Study 3 (All Safety Pool), numerical imbalances between nirsevimab and 
placebo treatment groups were small, with no convincing clinically meaningful trends. In the MEDLEY 
study there were more skin reactions in the nirsevimab treatment group. It is acknowledged that CIs 
across the subpopulations and subject cohorts were wide and overlapping. Also, that the numerical 
difference in the overall population could indeed be driven by the CHD subpopulation where 32.9% vs. 
18.2% reported any skin reaction through at least 150 days post first dose in the nirsevimab group 
compared to the palivizumab group. Hence, the difference between treatment groups could very well 
be driven by rash, which was more frequently reported in the nirsevimab group (11.4% vs. 6.1%) and 
which has been proposed to be included as an ADR occurring within 14 days in section 4.8 in the 
SmPC. 
- 
New Onset Chronic Diseases 
All together NOCD were very infrequent and in no cases where they considered to be related to IP by 
the investigator. No concerns of safety were raised with regards to NOCDs. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Based on the properties of nirsevimab as monoclonal antibody, the following adverse events were 
considered of special interest (AESIs): hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis), immune complex 
disease, and thrombocytopenia. 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool and MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool, AESIs (by 
SOC and PT) based on investigator assessments were infrequent, but comparable between nirsevimab 
and placebo treatment groups (0.3% vs. 0.3% and 0.2% vs. 0%, respectively). Rash was most 
frequent in both groups (0.2%), hereof one Grade 3 event in the nirsevimab treatment group (MELODY 
study, day 6 post dose, 20 days duration). There were no events of immune complex disease reported.  
In the MEDLEY study there was an overall higher percentage of AESI’s based on investigator 
assessments in the nirsevimab treatment group (0.3% (2) vs. 0) including in the preterm cohort 
(0.2% (1) vs. 0) and in the CLD/CHD cohort (0.5% (1) vs. 0%). All-over numbers are low for AESI’s 
by investigator assessment, and there is no convincing trend towards more AESI’s of skin 
hypersensitivity reactions in nirsevimab treated subject, and no concern of such are raised. In the 
MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, AESI’s by PT was generally balanced between the treatment groups 
(25.7% in nirsevimab vs. 26.2% in placebo, with slight numerical imbalances, but no clinically 
meaningful trends, including for Hypersensitivity events including anaphylactic reactions (25.1% vs. 
25.9%). For thrombocytopenia however, there was a slightly higher percentage in the nirsevimab 
group, though numbers were small (1.0% vs. 0.5%). The trend was the same for the MELODY/Study 3 
(Proposed Dose) Safety Pool. In the MEDLEY study AESIs were overall balanced between nirsevimab 
and palivizumab groups (17.6% vs. 14.1%), but higher in the nirsevimab group for hypersensitivity, 
including anaphylaxis (16.9% vs.  13.8%), for thrombocytopenia (0.8% vs. 0.3%). In the preterm 
cohort there was 1 case of thrombocytopenia (0.2% vs. 0% in placebo). In the CLD/CHD cohort the 
percentage of total numbers of AESI’s was double compared to palivizumab (22.6% vs. 11.2%), 
including for hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) (21.2% vs. 10.2%) and thrombocytopenia (1.9% 
vs. 1.0%). No SAEs of anaphylaxis attributable to nirsevimab were reported.  Across the 3 studies, 25 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 123/138 
 
 
 
cases of AESI thrombocytopenia (by SOC) in 24 subjects were reported in the nirsevimab treatment 
group. All cases were of Grade 1 og 2 severity, non-serious and only one event of petechiae was 
considered related to nirsevimab by the investigator. The cases included 12 events of contusion 
reported, 2 events of thrombocytopenia with alternate explanations (Heparin induced 
thrombocytopenia and Thrombocytopenia secondary to nosocomial sepsis), 2 events of hematoma 
related to trauma or concomitant medication, 6 events of epistaxis, 2 events of petechiae. Based on 
the review of cases of the AESI thrombocytopenia (by SOC) in the nirsevimab treatment group, no 
inclusion of thrombocytopenia to the SmPC is currently warranted. 
Laboratory findings (and vital signs) 
Overall laboratory data was sparse and included a total of 82 subjects (MELODY study: 49 subjects 
(32 nirsevimab/17 placebo), MEDLEY study: 33 Japanese subjects (24 nirsevimab/9 palivizumab)). 
Overall, no safety concerns were raised with regards to haematological, hepatic or renal toxicity grade 
shifts. Shifts ≥ 2 toxicity grades in haematology parameters were reported for 1 subject in the 
nirsevimab group (and 0 subjects in the placebo group) and no worsening for platelets specifically, 
bearing in mind that thrombocytopenia was included as a potential risk due to post-approval reports of 
severe thrombocytopenia in use of Synagis. Laboratory related AE’s were reported by SOCs for the 
MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool and MEDLEY study. Numbers were generally low and balanced 
between treatment groups. Overall, no safety concerns were raised for laboratory-related AEs within 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders, Hepatobiliary disorders, Investigations or Renal and urinary 
disorders. Across the studies (Study 3, MEDLEY and MELODY), vital signs ((temperature, blood 
pressure, respiratory rate, and heart rate measurements) were collected at screening/day of dosing 
and during follow-up period.  No differences were observed between treatment groups. Abnormal 
physical examination findings were recorded as an AE and no other observations related to safety were 
reported across the 3 studies. 
Safety in special populations 
- 
Effect of Age 
All together 533 subjects were included in the subgroup analyses, hereof 358 subjects received 
nirsevimab in MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool. For age at randomisation (≤ 3.0 Months, > 3.0 
to ≤ 6.0 Months, and> 6.0 Months) there were no apparent discrepancies with regards to distribution 
of AE’s. .  Overall, through 150 days post first dose, the incidences of AEs, ≥ Grade 3 AEs, and SAEs 
were numerically lower in nirsevimab group than the palivizumab group in neonates (< 28 Days at 
Randomisation), besides from subjects with at least one AESI based on selected MedDRA PT where the 
frequency was higher in the Nirsevimab treatment group compared to Palivizumab (28.3% (13/46) vs. 
17.2% (5/29)). Furthermore, no IP-related events were reported in either treatment group for AEs, 
≥ Grade 3 AEs, SAEs, AESI based on MedDRA PT, and skin reactions. No safety concerns are raised. In 
the MEDLEY study, the distribution of AE’s was generally balanced between the treatment arms for 
the subgroups of ages ≤ 3-months and > 3.0 to ≤ 6.0 Months. Overall, in the MEDLEY study there is 
a trend for more adverse events in neonates > 6-months in the nirsevimab treatment arm (68.7% vs. 
58.3). In the CLD subpopulation, for the nirsevimab treatment group there is only a higher frequency 
of subjects with at least one adverse event in the ≤ 3.0 months age group (67.6% vs. 50%). In the 
CHD subpopulation, for the nirsevimab treatment group there is only a higher frequency of subjects 
with at least one adverse event in the > 3.0 to ≤ 6.0 months age group (85.2% vs. 63.6%). No 
clinically meaningful explanation can be concluded from this observation. Also, for severity there were 
higher percentage of ≥1 serious or ≥Grade 3 event (9.0% vs. 2.8%) for nirsevimab. There were 9.0% 
vs. 0% that had ≥ 1 event related to COVID-19. In the MELODY study, COVID-19 related events in 
both treatment groups were all nonserious grade 1-2 severity events with onset ranging from Day 218 
to Day 353. In the MEDLEY study, COVID-19 related events included some of greater severity (one 
Grade 3, one Grade 4 and one Grade 5) and with onset of events ranged from Day 66 to Day 357. It is

acknowledged that the MEDLEY study population had underlying comorbidities which could explain the 
higher severity grades.  
As the latency of onset of COVID-19 related events in MELODY and MEDLEY was well after dosing of 
nirsevimab with the earliest onset in the nirsevimab group on Day 218 and Day 66, respectively, no 
interference of nirsevimab administration with COVID-19 infection was reported. 
 . An additional review of cases suggestive of reactogenicity (within 1 day, within 3 days and within 7 
days for age groups ≤ 3-months and > 3.0 to ≤ 6.0 months) did not suggest any anticipation of more 
serious events in infants> 6-month. 
- 
Effect of Body Weight 
Infants < 2.5 kg on Day 1 had the highest nirsevimab exposures based on mg/kg body weight.  In the 
MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool and the MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool, subjects who 
had weight on Day 1 < 5 kg, had AE’s (including by severity) that were overall comparable in both 
treatment groups in < 5 kg and ≥ 5 kg on Day 1 weight groups. In the nirsevimab group, subjects 
who had weight on Day 1 < 5 kg, there was a slightly higher percentage of subjects with an AESI 
based on investigators assessment: 0.3% vs 0% in the placebo group. In the MEDLEY study in infants, 
weight group ≥2.5 kg to < 5 kg the distribution was overall balanced, however a higher percentage in 
the nirsevimab group reported ≥ AESI (19.9% vs. 11.8%). In the weight group ≥ 5 kg, more in the 
nirsevimab group reported ≥ AE (68.0% vs. 62.3%). Also, more in the nirsevimab group compared to 
palivizumab reported ≥ 1 event of ≥Grade 3: 6.3 % vs. 3.8%, and SAEs: 10.0% vs.  5.4%.  All-over 
there is a trend towards enhanced severity of AE’s in infants < 2.5 kg on Day 1. It is noted that in the 
MEDLEY study, (subjects < 2.5 kg on Day 1 (N = 89; Nirsevimab N =59, Palivizumab N=30)), the 
incidence of enhanced severity AEs (≥ 1 serious or ≥ Grade 3 severity event) was 18.6% (n= 11) in 
the nirsevimab group, compared to 10% (3 subjects) in the palivizumab group. Among the 11 subjects 
in the nirsevimab group, 16 events were serious or ≥ Grade 3 severity and of these 10/16 events were 
associated with infections and the remaining 6/16 events included exacerbation of underlying medical 
condition etc. From the cases described, no dose-dependent toxicity is suspected. 
Nirsevimab and Vaccines 
The safety of 6 prespecified vaccine groups when co-administered within ± 7 or ± 14 days of 
nirsevimab/placebo was evaluated in the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool and the MELODY/Study 3 
(Proposed Dose) Safety Pool. The single most frequently reported AEs in the nirsevimab group 
compared to placebo (within 7- and 28-days post vaccination) for subjects who received a vaccine 
within 7 or 14 days of dosing were pyrexia and URTI. Overall few subjects received a vaccination 
concomitantly to nirsevimab or placebo (5.9% vs. 6.0% ± 7 days of IP dosing and 20.8% vs. 22.0% 
within ± 14 days of IP dosing), most commonly polyvalent DPT-containing vaccine, pneumococcal 
vaccine, and rotavirus vaccine.  
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, there were higher percentages of subjects in the nirsevimab 
group vs. the placebo group that developed URTI (by PT) in timely association to IP dosing. A grading 
of severity for all AE’s was carried out according to the current version of the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, including in subjects that experienced URTI.  A 
summary provided of URTI by severity post co-administration of any vaccine for the MELODY/Study 3 
(All) Safety Pool, show an overall similar frequency of URTI onset within 28 days post vaccine 
administration (9.6% (11/115) in the nirsevimab treatment group compared to (10.3% (6/58) in the 
placebo group (vaccine received within 7 and 14 days of IP dosing)). There were no URTI events of ≥ 
Grade 3 severity in either of the treatment groups.  It is reassuring that there are no events of Grade 3 
severity 
Numerical imbalances with higher frequencies were observed specifically for co-administration with 
rota-virus vaccine, polyvalent diphtheria-poliomyelitis-tetanus containing vaccine and pneumococcal 
vaccine. For the rota-virus vaccine, the frequency of URTI onset within 28 days post vaccine 
administration was 11.7% in the nirsevimab group compared to 3.7% in the placebo group. For 
Assessment report  
EMA/786523/2022  
Page 125/138 
 
 
 
polyvalent diphtheria-poliomyelitis-tetanus vaccine the frequency of URTI onset within 28 days post 
vaccine administration was 12.6% in the nirsevimab group compared to 2.4% in the placebo group. 
For pneumococcal vaccine the frequency of URTI onset within 28 days post vaccine administration was 
11.4% in the nirsevimab group compared to 3.1% in the placebo group.  
Immunological events 
No safety concern for development of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) after nirsevimab was 
disclosed through non-clinical studies and in the pivotal studies. Infants with prior RSV or RSV 
infection, receipt of palivizumab or other RSV mAb or any RSV vaccine, including maternal RSV 
vaccination and children with any history of LRTI or active LRTI prior to, or at the time of, 
randomisation were excluded from the pivotal studies. No cases suggestive of ADE have been reported 
in the safety data.   It is acknowledged that the risk of developing ADE in infants treated with 
nirsevimab is considered to be low based on preclinical and clinical evidence, and biological plausibility. 
The applicant does not find additional pharmacovigilance activities beyond routine pharmacovigilance 
warranted, as they are not expected to yield additional information beyond what has been provided, 
especially given the Day 361 to 511 follow-up data. Also, the applicant is of the opinion that ADE 
should not be considered an important potential risk based on theoretical considerations. This is 
considered acceptable. 
Overall, the percentages of subjects that were ADA-positive in the 3 pivotal safety studies were low 
and no safety concerns related to ADA were raised and no related immunogenicity (IP-related AE, 
investigator-assessed skin hypersensitivity reaction, or AESI) was observed in ADA-positive subjects, 
including no immune complex diseases. 
Safety related to drug/drug Interactions 
Due to the mode of action of nirsevimab, no altered PK/PD relevant to safety is expected from drug-
interactions.    
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuations were not evaluated in Study 3 and in the MELODY study, as subjects only received a 
single dose, which was acceptable. In the MEDLEY study, the number of discontinuations were low and 
overall acceptable. Only one subject (0.2%) in the nirsevimab group discontinued permanently. In the 
Palivizumab treatment group, 7.1% (n=22) discontinued, none attributed to adverse events. Overall, 
8.1% (n=50) of subjects in the MEDLEY study discontinued due to various reasons (death (n=5), lost 
to follow-up (n=6), withdrawal of consent (n=24), Covid-pandemic (n=11), other (n=3, one subject 
with hepatomegaly and jaundice discontinued due to ethical considerations in a vulnerable population, 
another subject was unable to come to the study site. A third subject was early terminated due to 
wrong cohort assignment (CLD/CHD instead of Preterm cohort) but was reallocated to the Preterm 
Cohort with a data change form.) 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of nirsevimab is adequately characterised and is acceptable.

additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is: 
Beyfortus is indicated to immunise infants from birth entering their first Respiratory Syncytial Virus 
(RSV) season for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease. 
The aim of the therapy is to reduce the risk of RSV infection and hospitalisation of RSV infection.  
The primary endpoint in the pivotal trials were medically attended RSV lower respiratory tract 
infection. Secondary endpoint was hospitalisation, and one of the exploratory endpoints was severe 
RSV determined by hospitalisation AND requirement of oxygen supplement or intra venous fluid.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The only approved treatment for severe RSV disease is ribavirin for inhalation, licensed in several EU 
countries, the United Kingdom, and the USA.  
The only currently approved prophylaxis for RSV is palivizumab (Synagis; USA approval 1998, EU 
approval 1999), licensed only for infants who are at the highest risk for severe RSV disease (ie, 
preterm infants born at ≤ 35 wGA under 6 months of age at the start of the RSV season, children < 2 
years of age with CLD of prematurity or hemodynamically significant CHD). With a half-life of 
approximately 1 month, palivizumab must be administered monthly (IM injection) throughout the RSV 
season. The burden of monthly healthcare visits during the season can be a barrier to compliance, 
diminishing the benefits of palivizumab (Wong et al 2018). National recommendations for use are more 
restrictive. As palivizumab is indicated only for use in the relatively small population of higher-risk 
infants, its effect on limiting the total disease burden of RSV infection is limited. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Three clinical studies have been conducted in three different populations to support the MAA.  
MELODY (phase 3) and Study 3 (phase 2b) are of similar design (2:1 randomised double-blind 
placebo-controlled trials). Both studies included subjects entering their first RSV season. MELODY 
(n=1490) included subjects with a gestational age from week 35, and Study 3 (n=1453) included 
subjects with a gestational age from week 29+0 to week 35.   
Additionally, a phase II/III study (MEDLEY) included preterm infants born < 35 wGA (without CLD or 
CHD) and term and preterm infants with CLD or CHD. This study provided data to the extrapolation of 
efficacy.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint (MA RSV LRTI) during 150 days post dose, was statistically significant in 
MELODY and Study 3. As such, the relative risk reduction was 74.5% (95% CI: 49.6%, 87.1%) in 
MELODY (GA >35+0 weeks) and 70.1% (95% CI: 52.3%, 81.2%) in Study 3 (GA 29+0 to 35 weeks). 
This was based on an event rate of 12/994 in the nirsevimab group and 25/496 in the placebo group in 
MELODY, and 25/969 in the nirsevimab group and 46/484 in the placebo group in Study 3.  
In the cohort of preterm children with GA < 35 weeks in MEDLEY, the event rates were similar with 
nirsevimab and palivizumab (0.5% in both groups), and numerically lower for nirsevimab than 
palivizumab in high-risk infants with CLD or CHD (1.0% and 2.0%). 
For the secondary endpoint (MA RSV LRTI and hospitalisation), the difference between treatment arms 
was not statistically significant in MELODY but was lower for nirsevimab than placebo in Study 3. In 
MEDLEY, the event rate was lower for nirsevimab than palivizumab in subjects with CLD/CHD. For the 
exploratory endpoint (severe RSV), defined as hospitalisation and requirement of oxygen 
supplementation or intra venous fluid, the results in MELODY were not statistically significant, whereas 
a statistically significant difference in Study 3 was observed. As such in MELODY, 5/994 subjects 
(0.5%) in nirsevimab and 7/496 subjects (1.4%) in placebo met the endpoint with a relative risk 
reduction of 64.2% (-12.1%;88.6%) with nirsevimab compared to placebo. In Study 3, the estimate 
was numerically higher, and 4/969 subjects (0.4%) and 16/484 subjects (3.3%) met the endpoint, and 
the relative risk reduction was 87.5% (62.9%;95.8%). 
PK matching has been established between MEDLEY and MELODY. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Across the three studies, the minimum gestational age was 22 weeks, and the minimum bodyweight at 
dosing was 1.6 kg and minimum age at dosing was 0.03 months (~1 day).  
Across the 3 studies, 41 extremely preterm infants (≤29 weeks gestational age) received nirsevimab 
within the first 3 months of life. Only 1 subject (29 weeks gestational age) received nirsevimab below 1 
month of age, 12 subjects between 1 and 2 months of age and none of the children with GA of 24-25 
weeks received nirsevimab below 3 months chronological age. As discussed in the pharmacology 
section the minimum postmenstrual age at dosing was 7.4 months. Data is therefore limited in 
extremely preterm children (gestational age ≤29 weeks) exposed to nirsevimab during the first 2 
months of life, which is reflected in the SmPC.  
It is understood that the complete possible weight range for the target population might not be 
covered in clinical trials. However, it might be unreasonable to excluded children in the extreme low 
weight band from therapy. Based on modelling, the Applicant has proposed that the dose in children 
from 1 kg – 5 kg should be 50 mg. Due to the mechanism of action; the efficacy is considered similar 
in children with a bodyweight below 1 kg. In the SmPC it is stated that no data in children below 1 kg 
exists and that the dosing is based on modelling in children with a bodyweight from 1.0-1.6 kg, and 
the lack of data is therefore sufficiently reflected in the SmPC.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety was characterised from three pivotal studies (Study 3, MELODY and MEDLEY) on the use of 
nirsevimab (50 mg or 100 mg single IM dose) in 2569 infants in their first RSV season. As no non-
clinical studies raised concern of safety concerns related to nirsevimab, the potential risks were based 
on the pharmacological class effect of immunoglobulins (including mAbs) and thus included focus on

adverse events as immediate hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) and immune complex disease as 
AESI’s. This also included thrombocytopenia as such events were reported in post-approval use of 
SYNAGIS® (palivizumab).  
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All Safety Pool) the frequency of AE’s by SOC and PT in the nirsevimab was 
generally balanced and similar to the placebo group. AE’s by PT most commonly in the nirsevimab 
groups were; (> 10% of subjects) respiratory tract infection (41.7% vs. 39.7%) and gastroenteritis 
(10.8% vs. 9.1%).  In the nirsevimab group there was a higher frequency of viral pneumonia (0.4% 
vs. 0.1%).  in all cases of viral pneumonia (8 subjects in the nirsevimab group) RSV as the causative 
pathogen was excluded based on central or local RSV test. AE’s of grade 3 or higher severity through 
360 days post dose were also overall similar or less in the nirsevimab group compared to placebo, and 
grade 4 and 5 events were few and generally reported in one subject each in both treatment groups 
(nirsevimab group: death: 2 subjects and gastroenteritis: 2 subjects). The frequency of participants 
with any IP-related AE through 360 days post dose was lower in the nirsevimab group (1.6% vs. 
1.8%), mostly Grade 1-2 in severity and most commonly a reflection of mild reactogenicity. There was 
however a trend of mild but slightly enhanced reactogenicity in the nirsevimab treated group compared 
to placebo within one day post dose, though they occurred infrequently.  In MELODY/Study 3 
(Proposed Dose) Safety Pool, the overall distribution of AE’s resembled the MELODY/Study (ALL) 
Safety Pool and was balanced between the nirsevimab and placebo treatment groups. In the MEDLEY 
study (including preterm and CLD /CHD cohorts), the distribution ≥1 AE through at least Day 151 (up 
to 14 days post dose) was balanced between nirsevimab and palivizumab treatment groups, however 
with a little higher percentage of ≥1 Grade 3 (or higher) AE’s in the nirsevimab group. Overall, in the 
nirsevimab group there were more events with higher intensity by the SOC Infections and infestations; 
For adverse events by time relative to dosing (1, 3, 7, 14 days post first dose) pyrexia was reported up 
to 14 days post dose in the nirsevimab group with 0 reports in the palivizumab group). 
Overall, for < 29 wGA, CLD, and CHD subpopulations, AE’s were frequent but generally balanced 
between nirsevimab and palivizumab treatment groups across the subpopulations, however numerical 
imbalances were markedly more predominant in the CHD subpopulation in the nirsevimab treatment 
group. Adverse events by intensity (Grade 3 or more) were generally more common in the nirsevimab 
treatment group and for both treatment groups most predominantly in the CHD subpopulation. 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, the overall percentage of deaths was the same in the two 
treatment arms (nirsevimab 0.3% (n=5) vs. placebo 0.3% (n=3)). In the MEDLEY study, there were 
more deaths in the nirsevimab treated group (0.8% (n=5) vs.  0.3% (n=1)). None of the deaths was 
considered related to IP by the investigator and in most cases, there were complex medical conditions 
prior to death.  
There were overall more SAEs in the placebo group compared to nirsevimab in the MELODY/Study 3 
(All) Safety Pool (placebo 12.1% vs. nirsevimab 9.0%), most commonly reported for the nirsevimab 
(vs placebo) were bronchiolitis, LRTI, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, and bronchitis.  None of the SAEs 
was considered related to IP by the investigator.  In the MEDLEY study there were overall slightly 
more SAEs in the nirsevimab group compared to palivizumab (11.1% vs 10.2%), including in the 
preterm cohort (6.9% vs. 5.3%). In the CLD/CHD cohort SAEs were more frequent, and slightly more 
in the palivizumab group (20.4% vs. 19.2%). Generally, percentages of SAEs were balanced between 
nirsevimab and palivizumab, however more frequent in the CLD/CHD cohort and by subpopulations (< 
29 wGA, CLD, and CHD). SAEs were also markedly higher for the CHD subgroup.  Overall, there was a 
higher percentage of SAEs in the SOC infections and infestations in the nirsevimab group (overall 7.2% 
vs. 4.3%; subpopulations < 29 wGA: 10.2% vs. 5.9%, CLD: 9.5% vs. 7.4%, CHD: 17.1% vs. 9.1%).  
None of the SAEs was considered by the investigator to be IP-related.

Skin reactions in the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool was generally balanced between nirsevimab 
and placebo treatment groups (30.3% vs. 30.4%). Also, there were a little higher percentage of 
subjects in the nirsevimab group that had been exposed to vaccines within 14 days of onset of skin 
reaction. In the MEDLEY study there were also higher percentage of any skin reaction in the 
nirsevimab treatment group compared to palivizumab (18.4% compared to 15.1%).  
AESI’s (hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis), immune complex disease, and thrombocytopenia) 
based on investigator assessments were infrequent in MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool and 
MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool, and comparable between nirsevimab and placebo 
treatment groups. There were no events of immune complex disease reported.  In the MELODY/Study 
3 (All) Safety Pool, there was a slightly higher percentage of thrombocytopenia (AESI’s by PT) in the 
nirsevimab group (1.0% vs. 0.5%). In the MEDLEY study AESIs were overall balanced between 
nirsevimab and palivizumab groups, but higher in the nirsevimab group for hypersensitivity, including 
anaphylaxis (16.9% vs.  13.8%) and for thrombocytopenia (0.8% vs. 0.3%). In the preterm cohort 
there was 1 case of thrombocytopenia in the nirsevimab group. In the CLD/CHD cohort the percentage 
of total numbers of AESI’s was double compared to palivizumab (22.6% vs. 11.2%), including for 
hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) (21.2% vs. 10.2%) and thrombocytopenia (1.9% vs. 1.0%). 
In the MEDLEY study there was an overall higher percentage of AESI’s based on investigator 
assessments in the nirsevimab treatment group (0.3% (2) vs. 0) including in the preterm cohort and in 
the CLD/CHD cohort.   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety in special populations 
Regarding the effect of age; in the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, for age at randomisation (≤ 3.0 
Months, > 3.0 to ≤ 6.0 Months, and> 6.0 Months) there were no apparent discrepancies with regards 
to distribution of AE’s. In the MEDLEY study, the distribution of AE’s was generally balanced between 
the treatment arms for the subgroups of ages ≤ 3-months and > 3.0 to ≤ 6.0 Months. Overall, in the 
MEDLEY study there is a trend for more adverse events in neonates > 6-months in the nirsevimab 
treatment arm. Also, for severity there were higher percentage of ≥1 serious or ≥Grade 3 event for 
nirsevimab. There were more subjects in the nirsevimab group that had ≥ 1 event related to COVID-
19.  As the latency of onset of COVID-19 related events in MELODY and MEDLEY was well after dosing 
of nirsevimab with the earliest onset in the nirsevimab group on Day 218 and Day 66, respectively, no 
interference of nirsevimab administration with COVID-19 infection was reported.  A review of cases 
suggestive of reactogenicity did not suggest any anticipation of more serious adverse events in 
infants> 6-month even though infants> 6-month age subgroup that has a more developed immune 
system and thus potential for reactogenicity. 
Regarding the effect of weight; infants < 2.5 kg on Day 1 had the highest nirsevimab exposures 
based on mg/kg body weight.  All-over there is a trend towards enhanced severity of AE’s in infants < 
2.5 kg on Day 1 and it is unclear whether this could reflect a potential toxicity due to higher 
nirsevimab exposure. However, in the MEDLEY study, among the 11 subjects in the nirsevimab group 
experiencing enhanced severity AE’s, 16 events were serious or ≥ Grade 3 severity and of these 10/16 
events were associated with infections and the remaining 6/16 events included exacerbation of 
underlying medical condition etc. From the cases described, no dose-dependent toxicity is suspected. 
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool and the MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool, 
subjects who had weight on Day 1 < 5 kg, had AE’s (including by severity) that were overall 
comparable in both treatment groups for < 5 kg and ≥ 5 kg on Day 1 weight groups. In the MEDLEY 
study in infants, weight group ≥2.5 kg to < 5 kg the distribution was overall balanced, however a 
higher percentage in the nirsevimab group reported ≥ AESI. In the weight group ≥ 5 kg, more in the 
Assessment report

nirsevimab group reported ≥ AE. Also, more in the nirsevimab group compared to palivizumab 
reported ≥ 1 event of ≥Grade 3.  From a review of data and numerical differences, some can arguable 
be attributed to incidental events, with no convincing trend suggestive of a safety signal that could 
potentially be an issue of concern was observed. 
Regarding nirsevimab and vaccine-co administration, the safety of 6 prespecified vaccine groups 
when co-administered within ± 7 or ± 14 days of nirsevimab/placebo was evaluated in the 
MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool and the MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool.  Overall few 
subjects received a vaccination concomitantly to nirsevimab or placebo (5.9% vs. 6.0% ± 7 days of IP 
dosing and 20.8% vs. 22.0% within ± 14 days of IP dosing.  In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, 
there were higher percentages of subjects in the nirsevimab group vs. the placebo group that 
developed URTI (by PT) in timely association to IP dosing. There were no URTI events of ≥ Grade 3 
severity in either of the treatment groups.  
Immunological events 
No safety concern for development of ADE after nirsevimab was disclosed through non-clinical studies 
(incl. RSV challenge study in a cotton rat model of RSV infection) and no cases of suggestive ADE have 
been reported in the safety data.  The risk of developing ADE in infants treated with nirsevimab is 
considered to be low based on preclinical and clinical evidence, and biological plausibility. No additional 
pharmacovigilance activities beyond routine pharmacovigilance are warranted, as they are not 
expected to yield additional information beyond what has been provided, especially given the Day 361 
to 511 follow-up data. ADE is not considered an important potential risk based on theoretical 
considerations.  
As nirsevimab appears to compete with human polyclonal antibodies for binding to neutralizing 
epitopes in the F protein (Ngwuta 2015), there is a potential risk that masking of epitope site Ø/zero 
might impact subsequent natural anti-RSV immune responses in nirsevimab-treated infants (Zhu 
2017). It is acknowledged that there were no signs of this in cotton rats, but as the animals were 
mature, and exposed to RSV infection at times of maximal circulating nirsevimab concentrations, the 
transferability of the finding to highly immature infants are unknown (report ID8897-0032). Measures 
for follow up on infants treated with nirsevimab to monitor their immunity towards RSV should be 
included in the RMP. 
Laboratory findings  
Overall laboratory data was sparse and included only a total of 82 subjects in all three studies 
(MELODY study (32 nirsevimab/17 placebo), MEDLEY study (24 nirsevimab/9 palivizumab)). Overall, 
no safety concerns were raised with regards to haematological, hepatic or renal toxicity grade shifts (or 
laboratory related AE’s). Given that cases of thrombocytopenia were reported post-approval for 
Synagis, thrombocytopenia should be included in the safety specifications as an important potential 
risk for nirsevimab.

Notes: 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In term and preterm infants (GA>week 29), there was a clinically relevant effect on MA RSV LRTI. 
Furthermore, in preterm infants (GA between week 29 and 35), a clinically relevant effect on severe 
RSV defined as RSV hospitalisation and requirement of oxygen supplementation or intravenous fluid 
was shown. In infants with GA > 35 weeks the effect was not statistically significant, but the estimate 
pointed in the same direction, and the lack of statistical significance is considered due to the low event 
rate. No clinical data exist on children with a bodyweight below 1.6 kg, however based on modelling 
and extrapolation of efficacy and safety, the drug is considered suitable for this subgroup. Exposure in 
infants <1kg is although anticipated to yield higher exposures than in those weighing more, and the 
benefits and risks of nirsevimab use in infants <1kg should be carefully considered. 
In high-risk infants (preterm or term/preterm with CLD/CHD) the effect was numerically similar 
between nirsevimab and palivizumab.  
The safety profile of nirsevimab is overall considered acceptable based on the data provided from the 
pivotal safety studies; Study 3, MELODY and MEDLEY. Generally, the safety profile was expected to 
share pharmacological class effect of immunoglobulins (including mAbs) and thus included focus on 
adverse events as immediate hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) and immune complex disease as 
adverse events of special interest (AESI’s). This also included thrombocytopenia as such events were 
reported in post-approval use of Synagis (palivizumab).  
In the MELODY/Study 3 (All Safety Pool) and MELODY/Study 3 (Proposed Dose) Safety Pool the safety 
profile was overall balanced between nirsevimab and placebo treatment group and considered 
acceptable. In the MEDLEY study (including preterm and CLD /CHD cohorts), AE’s were overall 
balanced between nirsevimab and palivizumab treatment groups, however with slightly more Grade 3 
or higher severity AE’s, SAEs, deaths (none considered related), AESI’s and skin reactions in the 
nirsevimab group. The higher rates of adverse events were mainly driven by events in the CLD/CHD 
cohorts, most notably the CHD subpopulation. Across subpopulations (< 29 wGA, CLD, and CHD), AE’s 
were frequent but generally balanced between nirsevimab and palivizumab treatment groups, however 
numerical imbalances were markedly more predominant in the CHD subpopulation in the nirsevimab 
treatment group. Some of the numerical differences, can arguable be attributed to incidental events, 
but no convincing trend suggestive of a safety signal that could potentially be an issue of concern was 
observed. 
Adverse events by intensity (Grade 3 or more) were generally more common in the nirsevimab 
treatment group and for both treatment groups most predominantly in the CHD subpopulation. SAEs 
were balanced between nirsevimab and palivizumab, also more frequent in the CLD/CHD cohort and by 
subpopulations (< 29 wGA, CLD, and CHD), but markedly higher for the CHD subgroup. Overall, there 
was a higher percentage of SAEs in the SOC infections and infestations in the nirsevimab group. The 
incidence of SAEs in this SOC was higher in the CLD/CHD cohort than in the preterm cohort, which can 
arguably be ascribed to more severe disease baseline in the nirsevimab treatment group. No specific 
safety concerns with regards to added risk of infections in nirsevimab use is raised. In the CLD/CHD 
cohort the percentage of total numbers of AESI’s was double compared to palivizumab, including for

hypersensitivity and thrombocytopenia, also most likely due to more severe disease baseline in the 
nirsevimab treatment group.  
Regarding the effect of age in the MEDLEY study there is a trend for more adverse events in 
neonates > 6-months in the nirsevimab treatment arm. Also, there were more subjects in the 
nirsevimab group that had ≥ 1 AE related to COVID-19. As the latency of onset of COVID-19 related 
events in MELODY and MEDLEY was well after dosing of nirsevimab with the earliest onset in the 
nirsevimab group on Day 218 and Day 66, respectively, no interference of nirsevimab administration 
with COVID-19 infection was reported.  A review of cases suggestive of reactogenicity did not suggest 
any anticipation of more serious adverse events in infants> 6-month even though infants> 6-month 
age subgroup has a more developed immune system and thus potential for reactogenicity. 
Regarding the effect of weight; infants < 2.5 kg on Day 1 had the highest nirsevimab exposures 
based on mg/kg body weight.  All-over there is a trend towards enhanced severity of AE’s in infants < 
2.5 kg on Day 1 but from the cases described, no dose-dependent toxicity is suspected. 
Regarding nirsevimab and vaccine-co administration, overall few subjects received a vaccination 
concomitantly to nirsevimab or placebo. In the MELODY/Study 3 (All) Safety Pool, there were higher 
percentages of subjects in the nirsevimab group vs. the placebo group that developed URTI (by PT) in 
timely association to IP dosing.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The provided data on nirsevimab has overall shown a beneficial effect on medically attended RSV LTRI 
and on severe RSV. The safety profile of nirsevimab is overall acceptable and in line with an expected 
safety profile according to the pharmacological class effect. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Beyfortus is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Beyfortus is favourable in the following indication(s): 
“Beyfortus is indicated for the prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract 
disease in neonates and infants during their first RSV season. 
Beyfortus should be used in accordance with official recommendations.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Acute  myeloid  leukaemia  is  a  clonal  disorder  caused  by  malignant  transformation  of  a  bone  marrow-
derived,  myeloid  stem  cell  or  progenitor  cell,  which  demonstrates  arrested  maturation  and  aberrant 
differentiation.  These  (myelo)blasts  accumulate  in  the  bone  marrow,  peripheral  blood,  and  other 
organs such as the central nervous system, lymph nodes, liver, and skin. The effects of uncontrolled, 
exaggerated  growth  and  accumulation  of  blasts  that  fail  to  function  as  normal  blood  cells,  and  the 
resultant  reduction  of  normal  marrow  cells,  are  anaemia,  thrombocytopenia,  and  neutropenia.  The 
clinical presentation of AML is directly related to ineffective haematopoiesis; patients typically present 
with signs and symptoms of fatigue, haemorrhage, as well as infections and fever (Löwenberg 1999). 
Untreated,  AML  is  a  rapidly  progressing  and  fatal  disease  that  requires  prompt  attention  (Gilliland 
2008). 
AML  is  currently  classified  following  the  WHO  classification  system  (Vardiman  2002),  which  reliably 
correlates classification with disease outcome. 
According to recent guidelines from the European Leukemia Net (Dohner 2010), the British Committee 
for Standards in Haematology (Milligan 2006), and the AML guidelines from the US NCCN (2011), the 
management  of  older  patients  with  AML  is  guided  by  performance  status,  cytogenetics,  and  the 
presence  of  comorbidities  (cardiovascular,  cerebrovascular,  pulmonary,  hepatic,  or  renal  dysfunction) 
which limit the ability of the patient to tolerate cytotoxic (combination) induction chemotherapy. 
Standard  therapy  for  patients  with  AML,  aiming  to  attain  a  CR  and  improve  survival,  is  combination 
induction chemotherapy. 
Currently,  low-dose  cytarabine  has  been  established  as  an  active  standard  of  care  for  older  patients 
with  AML  in  the  EU  and  US.  Palliative  therapy  with  hydroxyurea  (HU)  or  6-mercaptopurine  with 
supportive care can be administered for white blood cell count control. 
Azacitidine  (Vidaza)  has  been  approved  only  for  use  in  high-risk  myelodysplasia  (MDS),  including 
patients with 20% to 30% bone marrow blasts with multilineage dysplasia that fall into the AML WHO 
classification. However, this represents a small subset of older patients with AML. 
Histamine dihydrochloride (Ceplene) in combination with interleukin-2 is licensed only as maintenance 
therapy for the treatment of adult patients with AML in first remission. 
The subject of this centralised application is decitabine (INN) (ATC code: L01BC08, Antineoplastic and 
immunomodulating agents, pyrimidine analogues).  Decitabine is a cytosine nucleoside analogue which 
inhibits  DNA  methyltransferase  and  is  intended  for the  treatment  of  Acute  Myeloid  Leukaemia  (AML). 
Dacogen  has  been  approved  in  the  USA  since  May  2006  for  the  treatment  of  Myelodysplastic 
Syndrome.    An  application  for  marketing  authorisation  was  also  submitted  to  the  EMA  in  2005,  but 
subsequently withdrawn.  
The  product  is  presented  as  a  lyophilised  powder,  for  reconstitution  and  further  dilution  prior  to 
administration by intravenous infusion.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product Dacogen 50 mg Powder for Concentrate for Solution for Infusion is presented as a 
white,  sterile,  lyophilised  powder.    The  active  substance  is  decitabine.  The  excipients  used  in  the 
concentrate  are  standard  Ph.Eur.  excipients:  potassium  dihydrogen  phosphate  (buffer),  sodium 
hydroxide  (buffer/pH  adjustment),  water  for  injection  (solvent),  hydrochloric  acid  (pH  adjustment). 
The composition of the product is described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The  product  is  intended  to  be  reconstituted  with  10  ml  of  Water  for  Injections  to  a  solution 
concentration  of  5  mg/ml  and  then  further  diluted  with  intravenous  infusion  solution  (0.9%  sodium 
chloride injection, 5% Dextrose solution or Lactated Ringer’s injection) to concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml 
to 1 mg/ml, prior to administration by intravenous infusion over a 1 hour period. 
The product is packaged in a clear, Type I glass vial, sealed with a bromobutyl elastomer stopper held 
in place with an aluminium overseal with a flip-off, plastic (red) cap.  Each vial is intended for single 
use only.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The  active  substance  decitabine  (INN)  or  4-Amino-1-(2-deoxy-β-D-erythropentofuranosyl)-1,3,5-
triazin-2(1H)-one  (chemical  name)  is  a  white  to  almost  white  powder.  General  physico-chemical 
properties  such  as  solubility  (sparingly  soluble  in  water),  pKa  values,  partition  coefficient, 
hygroscopicity  (hygroscopic),  stereochemistry  (3  chiral  centres)  and  polymorphism  (several 
polymorphs  were  identified  but  it  was  demonstrated  that  the  polymorphs  were  well-controlled  during 
the process) have been adequately presented.  
The active substance is considered by the applicant as a new active substance and is not described in 
any pharmacopoeia. 
The chemical structure of decitabine is as depicted below:

Manufacture 
The  chemical  synthesis  of  decitabine  essentially  comprises  of  three  steps  using  well-defined  starting 
materials  and  including  a  purification  step.  The  narrative  of  the  synthesis  provided  was  considered 
sufficiently detailed; yields and quantities of materials and operating conditions were indicated. 
A summary of specifications for all reagents, solvents and processing agents was provided; and it was 
acceptable. All residual solvents and catalysts are controlled within ICH specifications  
Control of critical steps and intermediates were well detailed. 
Validation was performed on 3 consecutive, full-scale batches of the active substance. Analytical 
results were consistent and met the proposed control limits.   
The  development  of  the  synthesis  route  was  well  explained.  The  impurity  profile  showed  that  no 
impurities above the ICH qualification level of 0.15% could be observed.   
The  chemical  structure  and  absolute  configuration  of  decitabine  has  been  confirmed  by  spectroscopy 
(IR,  UV,  1H-NMR,  13C-NMR),  high  resolution  mass  spectrometry,  elemental  analysis,  optical  rotation 
and single crystal x-ray crystallography.  Physical characterisation was performed using powder X-ray 
diffraction,  differential  scanning  calorimetry,  thermo-gravimetric  analysis,  dynamic  vapour  sorption, 
hot stage microscopy and infrared spectroscopy.  The established structure is shown to be consistent 
with  the  analytical  and  spectroscopic  data  and  is  stated  to  comply  with  that  obtained  from  published 
literature.  The  control  limits  for  specific  optical  rotation  are  accepted  as  adequate  to  assure 
stereoisomeric purity on a routine basis.   
Polymorphism was controlled during the manufacturing process and since the product is reconstituted 
as  a  solution  and  diluted  before  administration  the  polymorphic  form  is  not  considered  as  a  critical 
attribute for the active substance. 
An  extensive  and  satisfactory  discussion  was  presented  on  the  impurities  including  the  potential 
genotoxic impurities.  The active substance itself, a structural analogue of the DNA building block, 2′-
deoxycytidine, has been shown to be genotoxic.  Structure-based assessment (DEREK) has been used 
to identify potential genotoxins among the starting materials, intermediates, reagents, and impurities 
of the active substance.  Given the nature of the active substance, this assessment focused on unique 
alert structures, unrelated to the structure of the active substance.  Those structures which triggered 
an  alert  owing  to  the  nucleoside  structure  shared  with  the  parent  molecule  were  considered  to  be 
qualified  by  decitabine  itself.    This  approach  is  accepted  and  the  impurities  were  found  below 
toxicological qualification limits. The tresholds were in line with the ICH Q3A guideline. 
For the residual solvents, the proposed limits meet or are more stringent than those recommended by 
ICH  Q3C  guidance.    A  suitable  GC  method  has  been  developed  and  validated  to  monitor  residual 
solvent content.  The batch analyses were in compliance with the limits of the ICH Q3C guideline.  
Specification 
Appropriate specification applied to the active substance included: appearance (visual), identification 
(IR and HPLC), clarity of solution (Ph.Eur. ), specific rotation (Ph. Eur.), assay of decitabine (HPLC), 
chromatographic purity (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph.Eur. 2.5.32), residue on 
Assessment report  
EMA/620205/2012

ignition (Ph.Eur. 2.4.14), particle size (laser diffraction), heavy metals (USP, harmonised with Ph.Eur.), 
microbiological quality (Ph.Eur. 2.6.12 and Ph.Eur. 2.6.13) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur. 2.6.14).  
The Analytical methods used have been adequately described and the in-house methods have been 
adequately validated.  
Batch  analysis  of  4  batches  reflecting  a  variety  of  sources,  process  scales  and  synthetic  routes  were 
presented and all data complied with the proposed specification. 
The specification for the active substance are adequately justified and set according to ICH guidelines 
and Ph. Eur. requirements. 
The  container  closure  system  consists  of  double  polyethylene  bags  placed  within  an  opaque,  HDPE 
drum. Silica gel is used as a desiccant. The primary packaging conforms with the requirements of EU 
Directive 2002/72/EC. A suitable specification   has been provided along with the IR  spectrum.  
Stability 
Stability studies were conducted on three commercial batches of decitabine under ICH conditions:  at 
30oC/65%RH (up to 18 month data) and at 40oC/75%RH (6 months data). 
The selected stability parameters comprise appearance and clarity of solution, water  content, specific 
rotation,  assay  and  related  substances. Polymorphism  does  not  affect  the  final  product  therefore  this 
parameter was not assessed during stability  
Under  all  storage  conditions,  minor  variability  but  no  significant  changes  were  observed  for  any 
parameter and the substance complied with the proposed specifications.  
In addition, a photostability study was performed in line with ICH recommendations for exposure to UV 
and  visible  light.  All  test  parameters  above,  supplemented  by  tests  for  microbial  purity  and  bacterial 
endotoxins  satisfactorily  demonstrated  the  photostability  of  decitabine  after  4  weeks  of  ICH 
recommended  light  exposure.  Forced  degradation  studies  (acidic,  basic,  oxidation,  and  high 
temperature) were conducted on one batch of decitabine (solid state and solution). The results showed 
that  decitabine  was  stable  under  oxidation  and  high  temperature  but  was  unstable  under  alkaline 
conditions. 
Based  on  these  data,  the  proposed  re-test  period  was  accepted,  when  packaged  in  the  proposed 
container and under no special temperature storage conditions.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Components of the Drug Product  
Decitabine is a white to almost white powder. Solubility and particle size were discussed, and although 
particle size was not critical for the solubility it was controlled to ensure good manufacturability. Once 
processed,  the  lyophilized  product  is  reconstituted  with  water  for  injection  and  further  diluted  for 
Assessment report  
EMA/620205/2012  
Page 10/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infusion, at  which point active substance particle size is not relevant. Polymorphism is well controlled 
during the manufacturing process. 
The finished product is formulated with compendial and commonly used pharmaceutical excipients. The 
function  of  each  excipient  was  well  described.  Excipients  used  were  mainly  for  pH  adjusting  and 
buffering agents. Nitrogen is a processing aid used during the lyophilization process to provide an inert 
atmosphere  for  reducing  moisture  content.  Stability  data  for  the  drug  product  were  considered 
acceptable  to  demonstrate  the  absence  of  incompatibility  between  the  active  substance  and  the 
excipients.   
Formulation Development   
Since decitabine is heat sensitive and prone to hydrolysis in aqueous solution, it was justified to use a 
lyophilised  powder  for  reconstitution  at  the  time  of  use.  To  optimise  stability  in  aqueous  solution, 
critical parameters such as the pH and temperature were controlled. 
The  parenteral  route  of  administration  was  preferred  due  to  its  maximum  bioavailability,  decitabine 
being degraded in the GI tract. 
Overages 
No overages are applied to this product.    
Physicochemical and Biological Properties  
This section addressed the key physicochemical attributes related to drug product performance. Since 
Decitabine is hygroscopic and degrades in aqueous solutions, minimizing the moisture content of the 
finished product by lyophilization ensures a stable product. The amount of time in aqueous solution 
during the compounding, filling, and lyophilization of the finished product was also carefully controlled 
to minimize the rate of degradation. The selected container/closure system provided an adequate 
moisture barrier as demonstrated by long-term stability data. The pH of the aqueous solution and the 
duration in solution during the compounding, filling, and lyophilization of the finished product were 
carefully controlled to minimise the rate of degradation. 
Manufacturing Process Development  
The  heat  sensitivity  of  decitabine  in  aqueous  solution  was  acknowledged  from  in-use  stability  data.  
Thus,  the  use  of  aseptic  filtration  as  a  means  of  sterilisation  is  accepted  without  additional 
confirmation. Process development, including minor changes implemented on moving from pilot scale 
for Phase I clinical and registration lots to the current production scale were outlined and acceptable.   
Justification of critical process parameters such as mixing time, pH, temperature, and sterile filtration 
was provided.  
The  bulk  solution  holding  time  was  well  established  as  it  is  critical  to  minimise  degradation.  
Development and optimisation of the lyophilisation cycle was adequately described.   
Assessment report  
EMA/620205/2012  
Page 11/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains Quality by design (QbD) elements. 
For each unit operation, a summary of the studies conducted at development, pilot and/or commercial 
scale  was  presented.  The  lyophilization  cycle  parameters  have  been  optimized  and  well  characterized 
during the development and scale-up studies. The information provided was satisfactory.  
The  proposed  proven  acceptable  ranges  for  process  parameters  are  typical  operating  ranges  were 
considered  acceptable.  The  pH  of  the  aqueous  solution  and  the  duration  of  the  active  substance  in 
solution  during  the  compounding,  filling,  and  lyophilization  of  the  finished  product  were  carefully 
controlled to minimise the rate of degradation 
The rationale for the critical parameters identified such as pH was satisfactorily provided.  
All  clinical  batches  have  been  manufactured  at  industrial  scale  according  to  the  commercial 
formulation. All of them used active substance from a previous supplier including pivotal phase 3 study 
(DACO-016) batches. Taking into account that particle size distribution and impurity profile have been 
compared  and  found  similar  between  the  two  decitabine  sources  (current  applied  manufacturer  and 
previous  manufacturer  for  the  clinical  batches)  on  a  significant  number  of  batches,  and  that 
confirmation batches have demonstrated that the commercial manufacturing process leads to finished 
product with the same satisfactory characteristics, clinical batches are thus considered representative 
of the proposed commercial product. 
Container Closure System 
The proposed container closure system (glass vial with elastomer stopper / aluminium crimp seal) was 
typical  for  lyophilised  parenteral  products  and  conform  to  Ph.  Eur.  type  I  standards  including  closure 
integrity.    The  compatibility  of  the  packaging  with  drug  product  was  demonstrated  by  the  stability 
data. 
Microbiological Attributes 
The  manufacturing  process  including  sterile  filtration  of  the  bulk  solution  and  aseptic  processing,  has 
been  correctly  validated.    Sterility  and  bacterial  endotoxins  testing  were  included  in  the  release  and 
shelf life specifications ensuring the compliance of the finished product with compendial requirements.  
The integrity of all container closure systems has been demonstrated by maintenance of sterility. 
Compatibility 
The  finished  product  is  reconstituted  with  Water  for  Injections  prior  to  further  dilution  with  infusion 
fluid.   
Decitabine undergoes hydrolytic degradation in aqueous solutions. Compatibility stability studies were 
performed:  in-use  stability  of  the  reconstituted  and  diluted  solution  and  stability  of  diluted  solution 
delivered through infusion sets, both at room temperature and refrigerated conditions. Data confirmed 
the compatibility and the stability for the reconstituted solution and the diluted infusions as described 
in the SmPC.

Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients used were of human or animal origin. Appropriate declarations were included in 
section 3.2.R.4. No TSE risk was anticipated. 
Manufacture of the product 
In summary, the manufacturing process consists of dissolution of the excipients and active substance 
in Water for Injections, pH adjustment followed by aseptic filtration, filling and lyophilisation. A detailed 
flow  diagram  of  the  manufacturing  process  was  provided,  highlighting  in-process  controls  at  the 
relevant stages such as pH control, filter integrity.   
Process Validation  
Given the reliance upon aseptic processing for achieving and maintaining sterilisation, this process was 
considered to be non-standard.   
In  line  with  the  process  validation  guideline  (CPMP/QWP/848/96),  process  validation  data  at  the 
proposed commercial scale were presented for three batches of finished product. 
Validation  data  included  an  evaluation  of  process  parameters,  in-process  controls  such  as 
compounding,  sterile  filtration  and  filling  and  analysis  to  the  proposed  finished  product  specification. 
This  approach  was  found  acceptable  and  should  ensure  that  the  manufacturing  process  leads  to  a 
product of consistent quality.   
Specifications

water content (Karl Fisher), sterility (Ph.Eur. 2.6.1), bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur. 2.6.14). 
Specifications were well justified and the limits applied to specified impurities were below the qualified 
levels. 
Analytical Procedures  
The  general  methodology  of  the  Ph.  Eur.  was  referenced  for  identification  by  UV,  clarity  of  solution, 
visible  and  sub-visible  particles,  pH,  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (by  mass  variation),  sterility  and 
bacterial  endotoxins.      In-house  methods  are  described  for  appearance,  identification  by  HPLC 
retention  time,  reconstitution  time,  assay,  related  substances  and  water  content  by  Karl  Fischer.  
Validation of the in-house analytical methods has been adequately performed. 
Batch Analyses 
Batch  analysis  data  were  presented  for  five  production-scale  batches.  These  were  supplemented  by 
four registration / validation lots and six clinical lots. Additional data generated at a smaller batch scale 
were also presented.  All data were satisfactory and in compliance with the proposed specifications.    
Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  were  conducted  on  six  batches  (pilot  and  production-scale)  of  the  finished  product 
packed  in  the  commercial  packaging  under  ICH  conditions:  2-8  °C  (1  batch  for  24  months),  25  °C  / 
60% RH (7 batches up to 36months), 30 °C / 75% RH (1 batch for 24 months), 40 °C / 75% RH (6 
batches for 6 months). The active substance was obtained from the different manufacturers used.  
The  tests  performed  were:  appearance,  reconstitution  of  solution  (time,  clarity,  visible  particles), 
assay,  related  substances,  pH,  water,  closure  integrity,  sterility,  and  bacterial  endotoxins.  The 
analytical methods were stability indicating and were the same as those used for the release product 
testing.  
Over  the  stability  period,  product  appearance,  visible  particles  and  clarity  of  reconstituted  solution 
continued to meet specification.  
Under  the  long  term  conditions,  no  significant  change  could  be  observed  in  the  test  parameters,  and 
under higher temperature the results remained also within the specification. 
Photostability  data  generated  in  line  with  ICH  guidance  were  provided  for  a  single  lot  in  primary 
packaging and confirm the photostability of the active substance. 
Overall, the data support the proposed shelf-life and the storage conditions as proposed in the SmPC.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Decitabine  belongs  to  the  deoxycytidine  analogues.  It  is  a  prodrug  that  requires  metabolic  activation 
by deoxycytidine kinase. Indeed, prior to the incorporation of decitabine into the DNA, the drug has to 
be  phosphorylated  by  several  kinases.  Decitabine  triphosphate  is  the  active  moiety  which  is 
incorporated into DNA. 
Decitabine  produces  antitumor  effects  by  specifically  targeting  DNA  methyltransferases  (DNMTs)  that 
maintain  the  epigenetic  silencing  of  tumor  suppressor  genes  and  contribute  to  the  progression  of 
cancers. Decitabine, a cytidine deoxynucleoside analogue, is specifically incorporated into DNA leading 
to the covalent trapping of DNMTs in a complex with the decitabine substituted DNA. This depletes the 
DNMT  activity  in  cells,  leading  to  DNA  hypomethylation  in  gene  promotor  regions.  This  results  in  re-
expression  of  silenced  genes  that  can  inhibit  cellular  proliferation,  induce  differentiation  or  induce 
apoptosis.

In the OCI-AML2 and KG1 human AML cell lines decitabine had antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects. A 
dose-  and  time-dependent  inhibition  of  proliferation  was  observed  following  single  pulse  treatments 
with  1.0  and  5.0  μM.  Analysis  of  DNA  fragmentation  indicated  significant  pro-apoptotic  effects 
(Schmelz, 2005b). 
In  vitro,  it  seems  that  high  doses  of  decitabine  induce  cytotoxicity  while  low  doses  induce 
hypomethylation.  Indeed,  it  was  demonstrated  that  the  dose-dependant  curve  representing 
methylation due to decitabine treatment has a U-shape. It appears that at concentrations higher than 
0.5 or 1.0 µM, methylation increases (Qin, 2007; Qin 2009). 
Similarly, in the human lymphoid CCRF/CEM/0 line, decitabine decreased the methylation level to 47% 
of  baseline  at  0.3  µM,  while  the  IC50  for  cell  survival  attained  1  µM,  suggesting  a  gap  between  the 
hypomethylating doses and the cytotoxic doses (Antonsson, 1987). 
•  Solid tumor 
The activity of decitabine was assessed in different solid tumor models (breast, colon, prostate cancer). 
IC50 values varied from nM to the µM range (Qin, 2009). 
In HT-29 human colon cancer cells, the concentration of 1 µM of decitabine produced a 90% inhibition 
of methylation without causing cell lethality (Glazer, 1984).  
Decitabine resistance 
Phosphorylation  by  deoxycytidine  kinase  represents  the  initial  step  to  decitabine  activation  prior  to 
incorporation into DNA. Complete loss or reduction of deoxycytidine kinase activity results in resistance 
to decitabine (Vesely, 1970).  
Uridine  kinase  activity  was  also  reduced  in  decitabine  resistant  tumors  (a  10%  decrease)  but  the 
decrease  was  more  important  in  5-azacytidine  resistant  tumors  (decrease  of  74%).  The  deletion  of 
both  kinases  could  explain  cross-resistance  of  5-azacytidine-resistant  leukemic  cells  to  decitabine 
(Vesely, 1970). 
Intracellular  pools  of  deoxycytidine  triphosphate  (dCTP)  can  also  alter  the  sensitivity  of  cells  to 
decitabine.  Reduction  of  dCTP  pools  by  treatment  of  the  L1210  leukemia  and  EMT6  murine  breast 
cancer cell lines with 3-deazauridine (3-DU), an inhibitor of cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthetase that 
depletes  intracellular  pools  of  CTP  and  dCTP,  increased  the  antiproliferative  activity  of  decitabine  in 
vitro by increasing the incorporation of decitabine into DNA (Momparler, 1979b). Pools of intracellulars 
dCTP can also be reduced by high doses of exogenous thymidine (Grant, 1982).

Deamination of decitabine by cytidine deaminase may also play a role in mediating lack of response to 
decitabine.  Cytidine  deaminase  is  a  key  enzyme  in  the  metabolism  of  cytosine  nucleoside  analogues 
since their deamination is a major pathway of pharmacokinetic disposition of these agents resulting in 
a complete loss of antileukemic activity. It has been shown that treatment with decitabine is associated 
with an increase in cytidine deaminase activity in decitabine-resistant HL-60 cells and in leukemic cells 
of  some  decitabine-treated  patients  (Momparler,  1990).  Additionally,  the  intracellular  phosphorylated 
decitabine intermediates may also be deaminated by deoxycytidylate deaminase (Momparler, 1984a). 
In  order  to  evaluate  the  interaction  of  decitabine  with  the  P-glycoprotein  efflux  pump,  bi-directional 
permeability of decitabine through MDR1 transfected MDCK cell monolayers was studied. Results from 
these  in  vitro  experiments  indicated  that  decitabine  is  a  poor  P-gp  substrate  and  therefore  is  not 
susceptible to multi-drug resistance mediated by P-gp. 
In  a  panel  of  cancer  cell  lines,  it  was  demonstrated  that  sensitivity  to  decitabine  showed  a  low 
correlation  to  that  of  5-azacytidine  (AZA),  but  a  good  correlation  to  that  of  cytarabine.  The  most 
resistant  cell  lines  to  decitabine  had  a  combination  of  low  deoxycytidine  kinase,  hENT1  and  hENT2 
nucleoside  transporters  and  high  cytosine  deaminase  (Qin,  2009).  However,  the  in  vitro  drug 
sensitivity does not always correlate with drug resistance in patient (Momparler, 1985c). 
In vivo studies 
The  antitumor  activity  of  decitabine  alone  or  in  combination  has  been  studied  in  several  leukaemia 
models. 
Non-comparative studies 
Decitabine anti-tumor activity was tested in several mouse leukaemia models (AKR, P388, L1210) (see 
Table 3).

Decitabine was also tested in a rat myeloid leukaemia model, the Brown Norway rat leukaemia model 
(BNML). A dose-response relationship was demonstrated for doses up to 50 mg/kg (3 times q 12h), a 
higher dose resulted in only a slight increase in median survival time.

Comparative studies 
Studies  were  performed  to  compare  the  activity  of  decitabine  with  cytarabine  and  azacytosine  in 
mouse leukaemia L1210. When mice were treated with increasing doses of each agent up to a maximal 
tolerated dose, decitabine was the most effective compound. Decitabine was the only drug that allowed 
all the treated animals to survive more than 60 days (see Table 4) (Momparler, 1984b).

In the Brown Norway rat leukemia model, decitabine activity was compared with cytarabine. At the 
maximum dose of decitabine (250 mg/kg) and cytarabine (1000 mg/kg) tested, decitabine induced a 
10-day longer survival time than cytarabine which means 2 logs more of leukemic cell kill for 
decitabine (Richel, 1988). 
Combination studies 
•  Combination studies with Histone Deacetylase 
Histone acetylation has been shown to work in concert with methylation to regulate gene transcription. 
Acetylation of histone is required to maintain chromatin in an open and transcriptionnally active state. 
This  permits  binding  of  transcriptional  factors,  histone  acetylases  and  other  regulatory  co-activators 
that  promote  gene  expression.  Conversely,  histone  deacetylases  (HDAC)  act  to  keep  these  residues 
deacetylated  and  thus  maintain  transcriptional  silencing.    Also,  binding  of  HDAC  to  hypermethylated 
chromatin, under DNMTs direction produces a DNA binding complex capable of blocking the access of 
the transcriptional activators to promoters. It should be noted that methylation is dominant to histone 
deacetylation,  so  transcription  cannot  occur  without first  inhibiting  methylation.  Initial  treatment  with 
DNMT  inhibitors  followed  by  HDAC  inhibitors  can  produce  additive  or  synergistic  effects  for  re-
expression of transcriptionnally silenced genes (Baylin, 2005). 
Assessment report  
EMA/620205/2012

In in vitro studies, a synergistic induction of apoptosis was observed when the pan-HDAC inhibitor JNJ-
26481585 (12.5 to 250 nM) was combined with decitabine (1 μM) pretreatment in several leukemic cell 
lines  (U937,HL60,  THP1  and  MOLT4).  In  U937  and  THP1  cells,  significant  induction  of  H3  acetylation 
was  observed  after  pre-treatment  with  decitabine  followed  by  JNJ-26481585,  compared  with  single 
agent JNJ-26481585 (Tong, 2010). 
The in vitro treatment of decitabine and phenylbutyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, in combination 
produced a greater inhibition of growth, DNA synthesis and a greater reduction on colony formation on 
both L1210 and human HL-60 leukemic cells as compared to either drug alone. The combination also 
produced a synergistic activation of the tumor suppressor gene p15CDN2B in the L1210 cells. In mice 
with L1210 leukemia, the combination showed enhanced antineoplastic activity (Lemaire, 2004). 
The activity of the combination of decitabine and the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) was studied in 
two  different  leukemia  cell  lines:  HL-60  and  MOLT4.  When  combined,  decitabine  and  VPA  had  an 
additive  effect  on  leukemia  cell  kill  and  apoptosis,  as  well  as  on  the  reactivation  of  p57KIP2  and 
p21CIP1 (Yang, 2004).  
The  combination  of  decitabine  with  trichostatin  or  depsipeptide  FR901228,  two  potent  inhibitors  of 
histone deacetylase, produced a greater inhibition of growth and DNA synthesis and a greater loss of 
clonogenicity than either agent alone in HL60 and KG1a leukaemia cell lines (Shaker, 2003). 
•  Combination with antimetabolites and drugs used to treat leukaemia 
Cytarabine  is  the  most  active  agent  in  myeloid  leukemia.  Their  combination  was  studied  in  different 
human leukemia cell lines. The combination of decitabine and ara-C showed additive induction of cell 
death in ML-1 and synergistic induction in HL60, Raji, and Jurkat. Sequentially, decitabine followed by 
cytarabine  was  a  synergistic  combination  in  all  cell  lines.  But  antagonism  was  observed  in  terms  of 
epigenetic  effects  (cytarabine  reduced  the  effects  of  decitabine  on  hypometylation  and  gene  re-
expression). However, it is likely that the antagonism is apparent but not real and reflects killing of the 
most hypomethylated cells (Qin, 2007). 
In  vivo,  cytarabine  given  simultaneously  with  decitabine  to  L1210  leukemic  mice  strongly  reduces 
decitabine activity against L1210 leukemia (T/C was 267% and 156% for a single treatment on Day 3 
and  311%  and  211%  for  a  3-time  treatment  on  Day  3,  6  and  9  for  decitabine  and  the  combination 
decitabine+cytarabine  respectively).    This  can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  cytarabine  prevents 
decitabine incorporation into DNA (Colombo, 1986). 
The  combined  effects  of  decitabine  and  hydroxyurea,  a  ribonuclease  reductase  inhibitor  used  in  the 
treatment  of  leukemias  and  sickle-cell  disease,  were  tested  in  HL-60  and  T24  cell  lines  in  vitro.  The 
concomitant treatment of hydroxyurea with decitabine resulted in a reduction of the inhibition of DNA 
methylation induced by decitabine. The reduction in decitabine efficacy was attributed to the arrest of 
the cell cycle induced by  hydroxyurea. By contrast, sequential exposure to the two drugs produced a

Modulation of the haemoglobin gene 
Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) decreases polymerization of sickle haemoglobin (HbS) and the complications of 
sickle  cell  disease  (SSD).  Therefore,  a  therapeutic  goal  in  SSD  is  pharmacologic  reactivation  of  HbF.

Silencing  of  the  γ-globin  (HbF)  gene  is  associated  with  DNA  methylation.  Symptomatic  SSD  patients 
were  treated  with  decitabine.  γ-  Globin  gene  promoter  methylation  decreased.  Treatment  decreased 
neutrophils  and  increased  mean  HbF  and  mean  total  hemoglobin.  Features  of  vaso-occlusive  crisis 
pathophysiology  such  as  red  cell  adhesion,  endothelial  damage,  and  coagulation  pathway  activity 
significantly improved (Saunthararajah, 2003). A study in baboons confirmed that decitabine increases 
fetal hemoglobin in vivo by transcriptional activation of the γ -Globin gene (Akpan, 2010). 
Effects on normal hematopoietic cells 
In  an  in  vitro  model  of  normal  hematopoietic  differentiation,  using  CD34+  cells  from  mobilized 
peripheral  blood,  decitabine  treatment  induced  a  dose-dependant  decrease  of  cell-growth  without 
causing  cytotoxicity. 
It  also 
increased 
the  expression  of  different  markers  (lysosomes, 
myeloperoxidase, CD15) suggesting an induction of differentiation (Guo, 2006). 
Pharmacology of the degradants and α-enantiomer 
In  aqueous  solution,  decitabine  can  degrade  into  several  molecules.  Some  of  the  degradants  were 
evaluated in a toxicity study. 
Decitabine  can  also  isomerise  into  the  α-anomer,  which  involves  the  orientation  of  the  deoxyribose 
moiety.  The  α-anomer  was  much  less  active  as  an  antiproliferative  agent  in  vitro  in  L1210  leukemia 
cells. It was about 100-fold less active (as shown by the increased life span) in L1210 leukemic mice 
after  a  single  i.p.  administration  and  100-less  toxic  after  daily  i.p.  administration  for  1  week  in  mice 
(Vesely, 1984). 
In human lymphoblastoid CCRF-CEM cells, the α-anomer induced hypomethylation of specific DNA loci 
at  concentrations  comparable  to  decitabine  while  cytotoxicity  of  the  α-anomer  was  seen  at  4-fold 
higher concentrations compared to decitabine (IC50 = 2.4 and 0.6 µM, respectively). Since α-anomers 
of nucleosides are generally not incorporated into DNA, it is possible that the α-anomer activity is due 
to its conversion into the ß-anomer (decitabine) (Fojtova, 2007). 
Exposure  to  the  α-anomer  induced  the  down-regulation  of  hTERT  gene  expression  at  lower 
concentrations than decitabine that was more cytotoxic (Hajek, 2008). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Effects on central nervous system 
No  adverse  behavioural  effects,  neurological  impairment  or  adverse  autonomic  responses  were 
reported  in  an  Irwin  Test  in  which  male  mice  were  dosed  with  a  single  i.v.  bolus  injection  of    up  to 
150 mg/m2  (50  mg/kg)  and  plasma  decitabine  levels  greatly  exceeding  clinical  plasma  levels  (mean 
Cmax  137  ng/mL).  At  higher  doses  tested  in  general  toxicity  studies,  ataxia  and  convulsions 
characterized acute toxicity and were clearly related to decitabine Cmax.  
Effects on cardiovascular and respiratory system 
In  vitro,  decitabine  had  no  significant  effect  on  the  membrane  K+  current  (IKr)  in  hERG-transfected 
HEK293 cells up to a concentration of 30 µM (6.8 μg/mL), a concentration that greatly exceeds clinical 
drug plasma levels. This in vitro assay was not performed under GLP. 
The  effects  of  decitabine  on  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  function  were  investigated  in  vivo  in  the 
conscious,  telemetered  male  and  female  cynomolgus  monkey,  which  received  a  single  1-hour  i.v. 
Assessment report  
EMA/620205/2012  
Page 22/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infusion  of  628.8  mg/m2  (52.4  mg/kg).  The  cynomolgus  monkey  was  used  to  allow  for  an  adequate 
evaluation of the cardiovascular parameters by telemetry in a relevant non-rodent species. Decitabine 
had no effects on diastolic or systolic arterial blood pressure, lead II electrocardiogram (ECG) variables 
(PR,  RR,  QT,  QTcB  and  QTcF  intervals,  and  QRS  complex),  ECG  gross  morphology  (rhythm  and 
waveform) or (electromyography-derived) respiratory parameters. A decrease in  heart rate in  vehicle 
(0.9% NaCl) and decitabine treated animals, in comparison with baseline values, was  slightly greater 
and  variable  in  decitabine  dosed  animals,  but  did  not  result  in  a  statistically  significant  difference  in 
heart rate at any time point between the vehicle and decitabine groups and is therefore considered of 
no  relevance.  Decitabine plasma  exposure,  based on  a  separate  single  dose i.v.  1-h  infusion  monkey 
study at the same dose level indicated that the exposure in monkeys was 20 to 30-fold higher than the 
clinical exposure. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No specific pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies with decitabine were performed.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of decitabine was studied in mice, rats, dogs, rabbits and monkeys. The profile was 
roughly the same in every species. Decitabine is unstable in aqueous solution and in plasma in in vivo 
conditions (37°C, pH 7.4). 
Absorption 
After  an  i.v.  single  administration,  decitabine  plasma  levels  declined  bi-exponentially  in  every  tested 
species,  with  a  fast  initial  decline  (few  minutes)  and  a  somewhat  longer  elimination  half-life  (23 
minutes in mice, 44 minutes in rabbits, 1 hour in monkey, 69 to 144 minutes in dogs and 3 hours in 
rats).  This  species  difference  in  the  elimination  of  decitabine  was  also  found  in  the  clearance  values. 
The clearance of decitabine was highest in the monkey, followed by the mouse and the rabbit and then 
the dog and the rat. This species difference is consistent with the species differences in the activity of 
cytidine deaminase, the main metabolizing enzyme of decitabine. 
Decitabine showed a low to moderate oral bioavailability. It was 10% in mice, 57-67% in juvenile rats, 
35% in rabbits and 2% in monkeys. 
In monkeys, food had a low influence on exposure. 
Repeated administration in rats and rabbits did not dramatically alter the pharmacokinetic profile. 
Distribution 
Following i.v. administration, the apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) was about 1.1 
L/kg in mice, about 1.8 L/kg in rats, about 0.8 L/kg in rabbits, about 1.0 L/kg in dogs and 4.3 L/kg in 
monkeys. 
In the QWBA study, the bi-exponential elimination of decitabine was confirmed. An initial rapid decline 
of  total  radioactivity  was  followed  by  a  more  gradual  decrease.  Distribution  was  wide  and  rapid.  The 
highest  radioactivity  levels  by  far  were  found  in  the  lymphatic  system  (bone  marrow,  thymus  and 
spleen) supporting the indication of decitabine in leukemia. 
Decitabine was also demonstrated to be able to penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid.

At physiological pH, protein binding is very low, <1%. 
Decitabine appeared to be neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-gp. 
Decitabine influx is mediated by hENT1 and other members of the nucleoside transporter family. 
Metabolism 
The  comparison  of  in  vitro  metabolic  profiles  of  different  species  showed  that  the  mouse,  the  rabbit 
and  the  monkey  were  the  closest  species  to  humans.  All  the  human  metabolites  were  not  present  in 
rats and dogs. 
In  vivo  studies  in  rats  and  rabbits  demonstrated  that  mice  metabolised  decitabine  more  extensively 
than  humans and rabbits. All the human metabolites were qualitatively covered by mouse and rabbit 
metabolites (except for M6 absent in rabbit). 
The  primary  metabolic  pathways  were  oxidative  deamination  (probably  mediated  by  cytidine 
deaminase), oxidation, hydrolysis and deformylation.  
The unidentified polar metabolites M1 and M2 were the major metabolites in human plasma and urine 
whereas they were much less abundant in animals. 
In  rabbits,  M3  that  resulted  from  decitabine  oxidation  was  the  major  metabolite  (30%).  In  mice,  M4 
that  resulted  from  decitabine  oxidative  deamination  and  deformylation  was  the  major  metabolite 
(25%)  and  degradation  products  represented  10%  of  the  urine  metabolites.  These  degradation 
products were not observed in rabbits and humans. 
Decitabine  is  subjected  to  enzymatic  activation  and  inactivation.  The  main  inactivation  pathway  is 
mediated  by  cytidine  deaminase  that  has  a  20  times  higher  affinity  to  its  natural  substrates  than  to 
decitabine.  Its  degradation 
is  also  mediated  dCMP  deaminase  that  transforms  decitabine 
monophosphate to 5-aza-dUMP. Cytochrome P450-mediated degradation is minor. 
The  phosphorylation  of  decitabine  is  essential  before  its  incorporation  into  DNA.  The  enzyme 
responsible for its activation is deoxycytidine kinase. 
Decitabine did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 or induce CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5  at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Decitabine treatment could induce cytidine deaminase activity at 0.1 µM or higher (22.8 ng/mL). This 
could be relevant in the evaluation of the clinical response of patients. 
Excretion 
In mice  and rabbits, decitabine is rapidly excreted into urine which is the main excretion route (83.4 
and 66.7% respectively). Feces excretion was minor (about 8% in both species). 
Drug-drug interaction 
The metabolic pathway of decitabine can lead to drug-drug interactions. Drugs that can interfere with 
activating  (deoxycytidine  kinase)  or  deactivating  enzymes  (cytidine  deaminase)  involved  in  the 
metabolism of decitabine can change the plasma concentration of the drug.

The mutagenic potential of decitabine was also investigated in several literature studies. 
In a study testing the induction of 6-thioguanine resistance in Chinese hamster ovary cells, decitabine 
was  not  mutagenic  (Momparler,  1984c).  It  was  also  negative  in  an  assay  for  mutation  to  ouabain 
resistance  in  CH3/10T1/2  mouse  fibroblast  or  V79  Chinese  hamster  cells  (Landolph,  1982)  and  in  an 
assay  for  mutation  to  6-thioguanine-  or  ouabain-resistant  mutations  in  the  baby  hamster  kidney  cell 
line BHK-21/cl13 (Bouck, 1984). 
However,  decitabine  induced  chromosomal  aberrations  in  FLEB14  cells  (human  pro-B-cell  line)  (Ji, 
1997). It induced homologous mitotic recombination and minor mutagenicity in the wing somatic and 
recombinant  test  (SMART)  in  Drosophila  melanogaster.  Decitabine  also  produced  chromosome 
anomalies in roots of Vicia faba (Fucik, 1970). 
A published study reported on the mutagenic potential of decitabine in transgenic mice carrying an E. 
coli  trans-reporter  gene.  The  lac-I  gene  contains  94  CpG  dinucleotides  and  a  total  of  299  cytosine 
residues in 1083 base pairs of coding sequence that could serve as targets for decitabine mutagenesis. 
Decitabine was randomly incorporated at both CpG and non-CpG cytosine residues (almost exclusively

at  C:G  base  pairs).  Various  mutations  following  treatment  with  decitabine  were  observed.  Of 
significance,  73%  of  the  mutations  induced  by  decitabine  occurred  at  CpG  sites  implicating 
demethylation as a factor in mutagenesis (Jackson-Grusby, 1997).

No specific studies were conducted. 
However, decitabine has been evaluated extensively in animals and humans using the intended, 
intravenous route of administration, particularly following multiple cycles of repeated i.v. infusion. In 
animals species, the multi-cycle i.v. infusion toxicity studies in rabbits (FEAW-0126) and dogs (FEAW-
117) included histopathological evaluation of the site of administration (femoral vein) and 
demonstrated only minimal pathological changes, indicating good local tolerance to decitabine. Up to 
the highest concentration tested in the monkey no clear decitabine-related changes were visible at the 
site of venous catheter implantation (AA71776).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The data about primary and secondary pharmacodynamics are based on published literature. 
Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. When specifically incorporated into DNA, it covalently 
links  with  DNMT.  The  enzyme  is  therefore  trapped  and  not  available  for  further  methylation.  This 
induces  the  hypomethylation  of  several  gene  promoters  and  allows  re-expression  of  silenced  genes 
such as tumor suppressor genes that can prevent the transformation to malignant cells and induce cell 
differentiation (p15/INK4b, p16, p14, SHP-1, p21WAF1, p73, C/EBPδ). 
Decitabine can also induce re-expression of gene involved in immunogenicity and immune recognition 
of  cancer  cells.  It  could  enhance  the  expression  of  tumor-associated  antigens  and  the  recognition  of 
tumor cell by cytotoxic T cells. 
The  depletion  of  DNMT  could  not  only  be  due  to  covalent  link  with  DNA.  It  has  been  demonstrated 
decitabine may also induce the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of DNMT1. 
Decitabine  also  acts  by  inducing  cytotoxicity.  Incorporation  of  decitabine  into  DNA  generates  DNA-
DNMT  adducts  that  interfere  with  DNA  synthesis  during  cell  replication  and  produce  apoptosis.  The 
induction of apoptosis appeared related to the re-expression of the tumor suppressor p73. 
Additionally, decitabine has an effect on angiogenesis; it decreased vessel formation in different tumor 
models.  
In  vivo,  decitabine  showed  a  strong  activity  in  murine  leukemia  models  (AKR,  P388  and  L1210).  It 
increased the survival of treated animals. This activity was dose-dependant up to a certain dose after 
which  a  plateau  is  reached  or  survival  even  decreases.  The  same  relationship  was  observed  in  a  rat 
myeloid leukemia model. 
The  effects  of  the  combination  of  decitabine  with  other  anticancer  drugs  were  studied.  These  studies 
showed the importance of sequencing when considering combination treatment with decitabine. 
Several potential mechanisms of resistance to decitabine have been investigated in vitro (decrease of 
deoxycytidine kinase activity, increase of dCTP pool, increase of cytidine deaminase activity, low levels 
of  decitabine  transporter  hENT)  but  no  cleat-cut  resistance  pattern  has  been  established  in  clinical 
studies. 
Regarding secondary pharmacodynamics, decitabine showed activity in sickle cell disease treatment by 
allowing  re-expression  of  HbF  gene.  It  was  able  to  induce  cell  growth  without  and  differentiation  in 
normal  hematopoietic  cells.  In  vitro,  the  α-anomer  showed  activity  and  less  cytotoxicity  than 
decitabine. 
Regarding  safety  pharmacology,  decitabine  was  tested  in  an  Irwin’s  test  in  mice,  an  in  vitro  hERG 
study and in telemetered conscious cynolmogus monkeys. In the Irwin’s test, there were no effects on 
rectal temperature, body weight and sensory-motor functions. At the highest dose (50 mg/kg), a non-
statistically significant slight neuro-depression was observed until 5 hours post-dose. Regarding effects

on the cardiovascular and respiratory system, decitabine did not induce relevant effects on IKr current 
in  hERG-transfected  cells  up  to  30  µM.  Non  physiologically  relevant  increase  of  IKr  current  were 
observed  at  concentrations  (3x10-6  M  and  3x10-5  M)  higher  than  Cmax  in  humans.  In  vivo,  the  only 
observed  effect  was  a  decrease  in  heart  rate  within  4  hours  post-dosing  conscious  telemetered 
monkeys treated with 52.4 mg/kg, a dose leading to an exposure far exceeding human exposure. 
Pharmacokinetics of decitabine was studied in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. The profile was roughly 
the same in every species. 
After a single administration of decitabine, the main toxic effects were observed on the hematopoietic 
system  (bone  marrow  hypoplasia  and  thymus  atrophy  in  mice,  leukopenia,  granulocytopenia, 
thrombocytopenia and erythropenia, atrophy of lymphoid tissue and hypocellularity of bone marrow in 
dogs,  decreased  leucocytes  count  in  monkeys).  In  mice,  mortality  was  observed  around  20  mg/kg 
after  i.v.  infusion  and  at  75  mg/kg  after  i.v.  bolus.  Deaths  occurred  at  5  mg/kg  in  dogs  whereas  no 
mortality was observed in monkeys up to 52.4 mg/kg. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies, Decitabine was tested in mice up to once daily for 4 weeks, in rats and 
rabbits  for  3  cycles  of  3-time  daily  injections  for  3  days  and  in  dogs  for  3  days  of  3-time  daily 
injections.  In  all  tested  species,  the  main  toxicity  was  hematological  with  pronounced  anemia, 
leucopenia  and  thrombocytopenia  related  to  bone  marrow  alteration.  These  effects  were  often 
reversible. In most of studies, mortality occurred, even at the lowest doses. Deaths in dogs and rabbits 
were attributed to infection secondary to immunosuppression. The testes were a target organ in mice, 
rats,  dogs  and  rabbits.  Decitabine  induced  irreversible  testicular  toxicity  with  testicular  atrophy, 
decreased germ cells and spermatozoa numbers. The intestine was also damaged in dogs (congestion 
and necrosis) and rabbits (enteropathy). 
The NOAEL in mice was 0.1 mg/kg. No NOAEL can be established in the other species; they were < 1.2 
mg/kg in rats and dogs and < 0.75 mg/kg in rabbits. 
The  genotoxicity  assessment  of  decitabine  was  based  on  two  conventional  in  vitro  tests  and  non-
conventional published studies. In the Ames test, decitabine was not mutagenic. However, it should be 
noted  that  all  the  recommended  strains  were  not  used  (E.  coli  or  S.  typhi  TA102  were  missing)  and 
bacteriotoxicity was observed at low concentrations. It was clearly mutagenic in a gene mutation test 
in  mouse  lymphoma  cells.  Published  studies  gave  conflicting  results  with  regards  to  genotoxicity. 
However,  decitabine  induced  chromosomal  aberrations  in  human  pro-B  cells  and  was  positive  in  the 
SMART test in Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, it was positive in vivo in transgenic mice. Based 
on the submitted data, decitabine should be considered as genotoxic. 
No conventional GLP-compliant carcinogenicity studies were submitted. Studies using different protocol 
are available in the literature and gave conflicting results. However, in the study using a protocol close 
to  the  conventional  2-year  study,  decitabine  showed  a  clear  carcinogenic  potential.  Therefore,  based 
on the submitted data, decitabine should be considered as a potential carcinogen. 
Fertility, embryofetal development and postnatal development studies are published studies. 
Decitabine  affected  male  mice  fertility.  Decreased  testis  weight  associated  with  histological 
abnormalities and decreased fertility parameters (sperm number, spermatozoa motility, early embryos 
survival, pregnancy rate, pre-implantation loss) were observed at 0.1 mg/kg and higher. The alteration 
of fertility can be explained by the fact that decitabine inhibits de novo methylation, a key process in 
gene  regulation  for  development  of  germinal  cells.  No  human  data  on  the  effect  of  decitabine  on 
fertility  are  available.  Because  of  the  possibility  of  infertility  as  a  consequence  of  Dacogen  therapy, 
patients should seek advice prior to initiation of treatment with Dacogen.

Decitabine was clearly teratogenic in mice and rats. It induced a wide-range of skeletal malformations 
at doses of 0.3 mg/kg in mice and 0.4 mg/kg in rats while no maternal toxicity was observed. There 
are  no  adequate  data  on  the  use  of  Dacogen  in  pregnant  women.  The  potential  risk  for  humans  is 
unknown.  Based  on  results  from  animal  studies  and  its  mechanism  of  action,  Dacogen  should  not  be 
used  during  pregnancy  and  in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using  effective  contraception.  If 
Dacogen  is  used  during  pregnancy,  or  if  a  patient  becomes  pregnant  while  receiving  this  medicinal 
product, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus. 
Decitabine-induced  changes  in  gene  expression  may  play  a  role  in  the  abnormal  embryonic 
development. 
Decitabine  reduced  mating  capacity  and  behaviour  and  decreased  fertility  in  mice  exposed  in  utero. 
The  adverse  effects  were  more  pronounced  in  males  than  in  females.  In  F1  males,  decreased  IGF-1 
levels and altered sexual behaviour were also observed.  
The effects observed in juvenile animals were the same as in adult animals. The hematopoietic system 
was  the  main  target  organ  and  irreversible  testicular  toxicity  was  also  caused  by  the  treatment  in 
immature males. 
No  safety  margins  can  be  calculated  for  repeat  dose  in  mice,  carcinogenicity  or  reproductive  toxicity 
because some of the submitted studies were from literature and no toxicokinetic measurements were 
included in the protocols. 
NOAEL  could  not  be  defined  in  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  due  to  hematological  toxicity  and/or 
mortality. Therefore, safety margins were often around 1.  
Decitabine  was  administered  via  the  intended  clinical  route  (i.e.  intravenous)  in  toxicity  studies.  No 
concern about local tolerance was raised from these studies or from clinical practice. 
In  mice,  after  a  single  injection,  degraded  decitabine  showed  similar  toxicity  to  non-degraded 
decitabine as reported in studies 079392 and 079379. However, the relevance of this study is limited 
since  no  analysis  of  the  degraded  solution  is  performed.  In  a  3-day  study,  rabbits  were  treated  with 
decitabine or decitabine spiked with impurities. No obvious differences were noted between the treated 
groups. 
Decitabine PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Pow does not exceed 4.5. 
Therefore decitabine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  main  toxic  effects  were  myelosuppression,  inhibition  of  spermatogenesis  and  intestinal 
enteropathy.  All  toxicities  were  reversible  with  exception  of  the  testicular  toxicity,  which  did  not  fully 
reverse  after  a  recovery  period  of  up  to  6  weeks  in  rabbits.  Most  of  the  toxicities  observed  from 
treatment with decitabine are likely to be related to the cytotoxicity of the molecule. 
The submitted non clinical data support the intended indication.  
Decitabine was highly toxic in animals where it induced death and severe haematological and testicular 
toxicity. It is also considered genotoxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic and it impairs fertility.

A total of 59 patients (44 males and 15 females) contributed to the PK population analysis. The 
characteristics of this PK population were as follows:

o  Median (range) age, weight, BSA and BMI were 70 years (40-87 years), 77 kg (58-129 kg), 
1.9 m2 (1.6-2.5 m2) and 26.7 kg/m2 (18.7-39.7 kg/m2), respectively.  
o  Race was primarily white with only 2 black patients and 1 patient from other race group.  
o  Normalized creatinine clearance was within the normal range for 19 (32.2%) patients. Thirty 
three (55.9%) and 7 (11.9%) patients had respectively mild (50-80 mL/min/1.73m2) and 
moderate (30-50 mL/min/1.73m2) renal impairment. 
o  The patient population included 18 (30.5%) MDS patients and 41 (69.5%) AML patients. 
Absorption  
As Dacogen is administered by intravenous (IV) route it is 100% bioavailable. Therefore, no 
biopharmaceutical studies were conducted. 
Bioequivalence studies were not required as the formulation used in the clinical studies is the same as 
the intended commercial formulation. 
Distribution 
After IV infusion of decitabine  20 mg/m2 over 1 hour over 5 consecutive days the PK of decitabine 
follows a linear 2-compartment model with rapid elimination from the central compartment and slow 
distribution to the peripheral compartment with a large volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) of 
116 L. Steady-state concentrations are reached within 0.5 hour. 
Decitabine concentrations decline biexponentially after the end of the infusion and are measurable up 
to 4 hours after the start of the infusion. 75% of the maximum concentration level is reached within 19 
minutes. After the stop of infusion the concentration drops to 25% of the maximum level within 20 
minutes. 
In vitro data showed a negligible plasma protein binding (<1%). Additionally, decitabine is a poor P-gp 
substrate as well as a poor P-gp inhibitor, suggesting that there is limited potential for inhibition of P-
gp in vivo. 
Elimination 
In the human mass balance study, the predominant route of excretion of total radioactivity was via the 
kidneys with approximately 90% excreted in the urine. Unchanged drug in urine accounted for 
approximately 4.2% of the total radioactive dose. The mean cumulative excretion of total radioactivity 
in feces accounted for approximately 0.48% of the dose. The high total body CL (mean = 267 L/h), low 
urinary excretion of unchanged drug in the urine (4.2% of the dose), and high urinary excretion of 
metabolites indicates that decitabine is predominately eliminated by metabolism. It is clear that 
decitabine CL is much higher than the normal hepatic blood flow (90 L/h) which is due to the 
metabolism of decitabine by cytidine deaminase which is present not only in the liver but in the 
kidneys, intestinal epithelium, and blood, as well. 
Intracellularly, decitabine is activated through sequential phosphorylation via phosphokinase activities 
to the corresponding triphosphate, which is then incorporated by the DNA polymerase. In vitro 
experiments with microsomes suggested that there was only a minor involvement of cytochrome P450 
(CYP) enzymes in the degradation of decitabine.  
Assessment report  
EMA/620205/2012  
Page 42/79 
 
 
 
 
 
The results from the human radiolabeled mass-balance study indicated that the CYP system is not 
involved in the metabolism of decitabine.  
Decitabine is primarily metabolized by enzymatic degradation. In vitro experiments with cytosolic 
fractions, and by making use of inhibitors of cytidine deaminase (ie, tetrahydrouridine [THU]), 
demonstrated that metabolism of decitabine is mainly mediated through liver, kidney, gastro-intestinal 
and/or blood cytidine deaminase rather than by CYP450 isoenzymes. Results from the mass-balance 
study showed that unchanged decitabine in plasma accounted for approximately 2.4% of total 
radioactivity in plasma. The unidentified metabolites M1 and M2, and M4 (the latter confirmed to be 
formed by oxidative deamination combined with ring opening and deformylation) accounted for 
approximately 48.2% to 57.0% (sum of M1 and M2) and 31.2 to 40.3% (M4) of the injected 
radioactivity in plasma. Although the structural identity of the metabolites M1 and M2 is not definitively 
known, evidence was collected that the pivotal toxicology species are also exposed to the 3 major 
human plasma metabolites. The major circulating metabolites do not contribute to the pharmacological 
activity, since the 4-amino-1,3,5-triazin-2(1H)-one ring is no longer intact in metabolite M4, and since 
the polar metabolites M1 and M2 have lost the sugar moiety and are likely to result from cytidine 
deaminase-mediated oxidative deamination. 
No pharmacogenomics evaluation has been conducted. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
No data have been provided on dose proportionality. A comparison of dosing regimens is presented in 
the table below. 
 Table 15- Comparison of dosing regimens PK parameters 
PK parameters were independent of time with no dependency on study cycle and no accumulation 
observed within the cycle.  
Special populations 
According to the population PK, the inter-individual variability was 70.6% and 55.7% for central 
volume and clearance, respectively. Intra-individual variability of decitabine concentrations was 
moderate (CV=31.6%). 
Impaired renal function: The PK of decitabine have not been formally studied in patients with renal 
insufficiency. Results from the mass balance study in cancer patients with radioactive 14C-decitabine 
showed that approximately 90% of the administered dose of decitabine is excreted in the urine with 
only 4.2% of the unchanged drug. The major circulating metabolites are believed to be not 
pharmacologically active as described above. In addition, population PK analysis indicated no 
Assessment report  
EMA/620205/2012  
Page 43/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significant PK parameter dependencies on normalized creatinine clearance, an indicator of renal 
function. Thus, decitabine exposure is not likely to be affected in patients with impaired renal function. 
Impaired hepatic function: The effects of hepatic impairment on the PK of decitabine have not been 
formally studied. Results from human mass-balance study and in vitro experiments mentioned above 
indicated that the CYP enzymes are unlikely to be involved in the metabolism of decitabine. It is 
unknown whether or not hepatic impairment may have an effect on the cytidine deaminase which is 
mainly responsible for decitabine metabolism, but it seems unlikely since this enzyme is not only found 
in the liver, but in the kidneys, intestinal epithelium, and blood as well. In addition, population PK 
analysis indicated no significant PK parameter dependencies on total bilirubin concentration despite a 
wide range of total bilirubin levels (0.2 – 2.9 mg/dL). Thus, decitabine exposure is not likely to be 
affected in patients with impaired hepatic function. 
Gender : Population PK analysis of decitabine showed that men had a slightly higher CL (12.1%) than 
women. However, this difference is small relative to the inter-individual variability in CL (55.7%) and 
thus it is not clinically relevant. 
Race:  Most of the patients studied were Caucasian (95%). There seemed to be no apparent race 
effect on decitabine exposure from the limited data available. 
Weight: The volume of distribution at steady state is proportional to body weight. Clearance has been 
shown to be proportional to BSA. Dosing by BSA would provide similar exposures (AUC) for patients of 
different body sizes. 
Elderly: According to the population PK, Decitabine PK were not dependent on age (range studied 40 to 
87 years; median 70 years). 
Children: No PK data in children have been submitted. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Decitabine metabolism is not mediated by the CYP450 enzyme system but by oxidative deamination. 
In vitro tests of decitabine inhibition and enzyme induction of various human CYP 450 enzymes showed 
decitabine does not inhibit nor induce CYP enzyme systems at concentrations more than 20 fold above 
the therapeutic plasma level. These tests included the following: 
o 
o 
Inhibitory potential of decitabine towards 6 major human CYP isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) in pooled human liver microsomes 
Induction potential of decitabine towards 5 major human drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4/5 and CYP2E1) using cultures of primary human hepatocytes 
The bidirectional permeability of decitabine was studied in MDR1 transfected MDCK cell monolayers, 
both in absence and presence of cyclosporine A, a known P-gp inhibitor. It was demonstrated that 
decitabine was a poor P-gp substrate, suggesting that its biodistribution is not dependent on the 
expression or activity of this efflux transporter protein. Decitabine was also shown to be a poor P-gp 
inhibitor. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement 
of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected. 
No formal clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted for decitabine.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
DNA methylation represents one of the major epigenetic modifications of the genome involved with 
regulation of gene expression without affecting the primary DNA sequence. The methylation of cytosine 
residues at cytosine-guanosine dinucleotides (CpG islands) in DNA is mediated by DNA 
methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNA methylation is associated with the control of gene expression. 
Hypermethylation of CpG islands is seen in MDS and AML tumour types. 
After cellular uptake and phosphorylation, decitabine is incorporated into DNA where it irreversibly 
inhibits DNMTs through covalent adduct formation with the enzyme. The trapping of DNMT results in 
reduced DNA methylation and re-expression of silenced genes that control tumour development and 
progression as well as cell differentiation.  
In addition the incorporation of decitabine into DNA can lead to cytotoxicity via a mechanism that 
remains under investigation. 
A further anti-tumour mechanism is through the stimulation of immune pathways by the re-expression 
of tumour antigens involved in cancer cell surveillance and elimination. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
•  Antiproliferative effect 
In several leukemic cell lines from murine and human origin and at concentrations that inhibited 
cellular DNA methylation and reduced DNMT activity in cell extracts, decitabine induced morphological 
and functional differentiation. 
A dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation was observed: 
Lower concentrations of decitabine seem to be optimal to inhibit DNA methyltransferase, 
induce DNA hypomethylation, whilst higher concentrations will increase the drug-induced 
cytotoxicity. In human leukemic cell lines, cellular differentiation and inhibition of DNA 
methylation reached a plateau, or even decreased above concentration of 0.5 to 1 μM. 
Incorporation into DNA requires transition of target tumor cells through the S-phase of the cell 
cycle. Decitabine does not induce cell cycle growth arrests that could be self-limiting to 
decitabine incorporation into DNA. Once incorporated into DNA, the trapping of DNMT and 
therapeutic effects of decitabine will persist in the absence of circulating plasma levels of 
decitabine. Therefore, intermittent schedules of decitabine administration should be effective in 
managing hematological malignancies given the persistence of the active DNA-decitabine 
complex. 
Decitabine showed strong anti-tumour activity in several in vivo pre-clinical leukemia models and such 
activity was dose dependent in all studies and schedule dependent. Both extending duration of infusion 
or by repeating shorter courses of treatment over several days increased the antitumor effects. 
•  Decitabine resistance 
Assessment report  
EMA/620205/2012  
Page 45/79 
 
 
 
 
 
Phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase represents the initial step to decitabine activation prior to 
incorporation into DNA. Complete loss or reduction of deoxycytidine kinase activity results in resistance 
to decitabine.  
Secondary pharmacology 
It has been demonstrated that decitabine enters the CNS but no relevant effects on CNS were seen in 
preclinical studies.  
In addition, the effects of decitabine on cardiovascular and respiratory function were investigated in 
pre-clinical studies and no relevant changes were seen despite higher exposure levels compared to 
clinical exposure levels. 
Decitabine increases fetal hemoglobin expression in patients with thalassemia or sickle cell disease due 
to the hypomethylation effect. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
In non-clinical in vivo tumour models, exposure time was an important factor relative to the efficacy of 
decitabine; longer exposure via intermittent dosing schedules was more effective than a single higher 
dose at the same dose intensity in producing an anti-tumoral effect while minimizing toxicity. The 
superiority of intermittent dosing is due to the additive incorporation of decitabine into DNA during 
multiple rounds of S-phase in the target cells. 
Studies correlating the PK/PD relationship were not performed. However, in an analysis of PD data 
from an investigator-initiated Phase 1 study of Dacogen for the treatment of subjects with AML or 
MDS, a dose-dependent decrease in global DNA methylation was observed. Also other clinical studies 
in patients with haematological malignancies have analysed peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) from subjects treated with 5, 10, 15, 20, and 100 mg/m2 Dacogen per day for methylation of 
Alu and long interspersed nucleotide element (LINE) DNA sequences. There was a dose dependent 
linear decrease in methylation of both these markers in samples from subjects that received doses of 5 
to 20 mg/m2 per day. There was no significant additional decrease in methylation above 20 mg/m2 per 
day, similar to in vitro observations. The extent of hypomethylation correlated with clinical response.  
The phase II study ID03-0180 evaluated three schedules of decitabine in 128 patients with 
myelodysplasia. Response rate (RR= CR+PR) was assessed after a minimum of 3 cycles of treatment 
in the three arms: 
o  Arm A: 10 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour once a day for 10 consecutive days 
o  Arm B: 20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour once a day for 5 consecutive days 
o  Arm C: 10 mg/m2 SC twice a day for 5 consecutive days 
The cycles were timed every 4 to 8 weeks depending on recovery. Analysis of PBMCs showed that the 
20 mg/m2 regimen had the greatest extent of hypomethylation and the best CR rate compared to the 
alternative regimens. 
No clinical data have been provided on pharmacodynamic interactions or on genetic differences in PD 
response.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  PK  properties  of  decitabine  following  20  mg/m2  DACOGEN  administered  daily  as  a  1-hour  IV 
infusion for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks were evaluated in 45 patients in 2 Phase II studies and 
1  Phase  III  study  In  addition,  a  Phase  I  radiolabeled  mass-balance  study  was  conducted  to 
characterize  the  PK,  metabolism  and  routes  of  excretion  of  20  mg  single  DACOGEN  dose  (14C-
decitabine) given as IV infusion over 3 hours in 4 cancer patients. A study in patients using a 3-day, 15 
mg/m2 regimen (DACO-018) was included in the population PK analysis. 
The  analytical  method  used  for  determination  of  decitabine  plasma  concentrations  (LC/MS/MS) 
presents  adequate  performance  (e.g.,  intra-batch  accuracy  and  precision  ranged  between  [-5.50%  -
1.33%]  and  [5.95%  -  7.77%],  respectively).  Moreover,  blood  sampling  was  performed  using  tubes 
preloaded with tetrahydrouridine (THU) as in vitro inhibitor of plasma cytidine desaminase. 
All PK parameters were calculated using conventional non-compartmental methods and actual times of 
blood sampling. 
The steady-state volume of distribution following daily 1 h intravenous infusion of 20 mg/m2 DACOGEN 
over 5 days for 4 weeks is 116 L for a 70 kg cancer patient with BSA of 1.73 m2, indicating distribution 
of  the  drug  into  peripheral  tissues.  The  in  vitro  plasma  protein  binding  of  decitabine  is  negligible 
(<1%)  and  therefore  decitabine  is  unlikely  to  displace  co  administered  medicinal  products  from  their 
plasma  protein  binding.  In  addition,  decitabine  has  been  shown  to  be  a  weak  inhibitor  of  P-gp 
mediated transport in vitro and is therefore also not expected to affect P-gp mediated transport of co-
administered medicinal products. Similar observations for the volume of distribution were seen in mice, 
rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkey, indicating distribution to peripheral tissues.  
There  is  the  potential  for  a  drug-drug  interaction  with  other  agents  which  are  also  activated  by 
sequential phosphorylation (via intracellular phosphokinase activities) and/or metabolized by enzymes 
implicated  in  the  inactivation  of  decitabine  (e.g.,  cytidine  deaminase,  an  enzyme  for  which  genetic 
polymorphism with significant impact on PK and then on toxicity have been described for other drugs 
such as gemcitabine [Cicollini, J Clin Oncol 2010, Farell, Pharmacogenomics 2011]). Therefore, caution 
should  be  exercised  if  these  drugs  are  combined  with  Dacogen.  Pharmacogenetic  evaluation  has  not 
been performed in addition to PK and Phase I studies, since DNA samples were not available. 
Population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  performed  from  PK  data  obtained  in  59  patients  (44  males 
and  15  females).  According  to  the  results,  the  inter-individual  variability  was  70.6%  and  55.7%  for 
central volume and clearance, respectively. Intra-individual variability of decitabine concentrations was 
moderate  (CV=31.6%).  The  value  proposed  as  intra-individual  variability  (31.6%)  should  correspond 
to  residual  variability.  This  value  is  rather  high  for  pharmacokinetic  analysis  after  IV  infusion.  It  was 
probably  due,  at  least  partly,  to  the  fact  that  no  interoccasion  option  was  used  to  analyse  data  from 
two  cycles.  Use  of  interoccasion  option  is  recommended  since  “ignoring  such  interoccasion  variability 
(IOV)  may  result  in  biased  population  parameter  estimates”  [J  Pharmacokinet  Biopharm.  1993 
Dec;21(6):735-50. The importance of modelling interoccasion variability in population pharmacokinetic 
analyses. Karlsson MO, Sheiner LB.]. 
Pharmacokinetic - pharmacodynamic (PD) studies have not been conducted with DACOGEN due to the 
practical  difficulties  of  conducting  such  studies.  The  modelled  Population  PK  analyses  incorporated 
subjects representative of the vast majority of the target population (i.e., BSA of 1.6 to 2.5 m2). These 
analyses concluded that clearance was proportional to body surface area. 
Decitabine  metabolism  is not  mediated by  the  CYP450  enzyme  system  but  by  oxidative  deamination. 
Therefore  no  formal  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  carried  out.  The  inhibitory  and  induction 
potential  of  decitabine  towards  human  CYP  isoenzymes  as  investigated  in  vitro,  is  considered  very

limited. In addition, there is no known involvement of CYP in the metabolism of decitabine as shown in 
the human mass-balance study. As a consequence, CYP-mediated metabolic drug-drug interactions are 
unlikely.  Furthermore,  patients  in  clinical  studies  were  being  co-administered  a  range  of  other 
medications and no clinically significant interactions were noted. 
Studies  in  patients  with  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  have  not  been  conducted.  The  need  for  dose 
adjustment  in  patients  with  renal  hepatic  impairment  has  not  been  evaluated.  Caution  should  be 
exercised and patients should be monitored closely. 
No  dose-response  or  exposure-response  data  are  available.  No  data  regarding  relationship  between 
degree of DNA demethylation and response rate and/or adverse events or between drug exposure and 
response rate and/or adverse events have been provided. 
In  addition  to  its  role  in  DNA  demethylation  and  cytotoxicity,  decitabine  is  likely  to  have  secondary 
pharmacodynamic  effects,  including  immunosuppressive,  antimicrobial,  mutagenic,  embryotoxic, 
teratogenic,  and  tumourigenic  effects.  These  secondary  effects  are  common  with  other  nucleoside 
analogues used as antiviral and antineoplastic agents. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology of decitabine has been adequately studied. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The AML dosing regimen evaluated in the pivotal DACO-016 study and supportive DACO-017 study was 
20 mg/m2 DACOGEN administered as a 1-hour IV infusion daily for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks. 
The AML dosing regimen was initially based on pre-clinical and pharmacologic observations. 
Exploratory Studies PCH 97-19 and PCH 95-11 used a 3-Day dosing regimen of DACOGEN, 15 mg/m2 
as  a  4-hour  IV  infusion  every  8  hours  for  3  consecutive  days  every  6  weeks  (dose  intensity=  22.5 
mg/m2 per week), and showed clinical activity in subjects with MDS and AML. These studies led to the 
development of 2 Phase 3 studies (Study D-0007 in the U.S. and Study EORTC-06011 in Europe) that 
also evaluated the 3-Day dosing regimen in patients with MDS. Results of D-0007 led to the approval 
of the 3-Day regimen for the treatment of patients with MDS in the U.S. and 35 other countries.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
DACO-016 
The pivotal Study DACO-016 was a randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase III study of DACOGEN 
versus  patient's  choice  of  treatment  (with  physician's  advice)  (treatment  choice,  TC)  of  either 
supportive care or low-dose cytarabine in older patients with AML.

Methods 
Study Participants 
Patients 65 years of age or older who were newly diagnosed with histologically confirmed de novo or 
secondary AML and who had a poor- or intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile, ECOG performance status 
of 0-2, and adequate organ function determined by laboratory evaluation.  
Subjects were to be excluded if they had any of the following main conditions: Acute promyelocytic 
leukemia; any other active systemic malignancies; received previous chemotherapy (except 
hydroxyurea), including azacitidine, cytarabine or DACOGEN, for any myeloid disorder; was considered 
a potential candidate for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant within 12 weeks after randomization. 
Treatments 
DACOGEN was administered at a dose of 20 mg/m2 by 1-hour intravenous infusion once daily for 
5 consecutive days every 4 weeks.  
Cytarabine was administered at a dose of 20 mg/m2 by subcutaneous injection once daily for 
10 consecutive days, repeated every 4 weeks.  
Subjects could continue on therapy until they were no longer deriving clinical benefit. 
Subjects in both two arms above could have received supportive care at the discretion of their treating 
physician and as defined in the study protocol. 
Cycles for the supportive care group were defined as successive 4-week intervals beginning with the 
day of randomization and ending with the date of study treatment discontinuation. 
Supportive care specifically excluded surgery, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiotherapy (with the 
exception of palliative radiotherapy), anticancer hormonal therapy, and oral or systemic chemotherapy 
in which the goal was to either eradicate or slow the progression of the disease. Those therapies 
considered acceptable included, but were not limited to, treatment with antibiotics and antifungal 
agents, packed red blood cells or whole blood transfusions, fresh frozen plasma, platelet transfusions, 
nutritional support (enteral or parenteral), and/or focal external beam radiation given for symptomatic 
control of pain. Subjects were allowed to receive erythropoietin and darbepoetin during this study; 
however, use of G-CSF and GM-CSF was restricted to the treatment of severe infection. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the pivotal study was to compare the overall survival (OS) in patients 65 
years and older who had newly diagnosed de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 
either poor- or intermediate-risk cytogenetics who were randomly assigned to receive either DACOGEN 
or patient's choice with physician's advice of either supportive care or low-dose cytarabine (Treatment 
Choice arm [TC]).  
The key secondary objective was to compare complete remission rates (CR plus CRp [CR without 
complete platelet recovery]) and to characterize and compare the incidence and severity of toxicities 
between treatment arms.  
Assessment report  
EMA/620205/2012  
Page 49/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Key tertiary objectives were to compare between treatment arms, event-free survival (EFS), and 
relapse-free survival (RFS); and to determine the population pharmacokinetics of decitabine. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy: OS was measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from any 
cause or the last date known to be alive.  
Secondary Efficacy: Disease response (CR + CRp) criteria were predefined in the study protocol and 
based upon review of bone marrow assessments, peripheral blood counts, cytogenetic analyses, 
evaluation of extramedullary disease, transfusion requirements and clinical judgement.  
Tertiary Efficacy: EFS, RFS, and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated as tertiary endpoints.  
Sample size 
The planned sample size was 480 subjects and the targeted number of deaths at the final analysis was 
385. The study was designed to detect a 25% reduction in mortality risk (median survival times were 
assumed to be 6 months for TC arm and 8 months for DACOGEN arm) with at least 80% power while 
maintaining an overall significance level of 0.05 (2-sided). 
Randomisation 
485 subjects were randomized. Randomization was stratified for age (<70, 70+ years), cytogenetic 
risk (intermediate, poor), and ECOG performance status (0-1, 2).The primary analysis of OS was 
planned when 385 deaths had occurred.  
Blinding (masking) 
For this open-label study, steps were implemented to minimize potential bias due to unblinded 
treatment assignments. These included: (1) preselection of the preferred comparator (supportive care 
or cytarabine) prior to randomization; (2) a central randomization procedure where the next treatment 
assignment was unknown to all parties prior to randomization; (3) central, blinded outcome 
assessment of all bone marrow samples used to determine response; (4) independent expert 
determination of disease response and progression; and (5) no dissemination of ongoing trial 
information without the prior approval of the Steering Committee in consultation with the DMC. 
Statistical methods 
OS was calculated as the interval from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause 
or the last date the patient was known to be alive. 
Survival data were censored at the date of clinical cut off (CCO) on 28 October 2009 (referred to as 
CCO 2009) for patients who were then known to be alive. Patients lost to follow-up prior to the data 
CCO were right censored at the last date they were known to be alive. The primary treatment 
comparison was based on a stratified log-rank test. Stratification factors were to include age (<70, 
70+ years), cytogenetic risk (intermediate, poor), ECOG performance status (0-1, 2). The significance 
level for the final analysis of the primary endpoint was 0.0462 (2-sided) after adjusting for 2 interim 
analyses. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival function for each treatment arm. 
The hazard ratio estimate (DACOGEN versus Total TC) and its corresponding 95% CI were obtained by 
a stratified Cox’s regression model using age, baseline cytogenetic risk and baseline ECOG 
performance status as the strata, and with treatment group as the only covariate. An additional 
Assessment report

sensitivity analysis was performed where subjects who received subsequent, potentially disease 
modifying therapy (DMT) were censored at the first day of the first subsequent therapy. 
The incidence of CR + CRp was calculated and compared between 2 treatment arms using Fisher’s 
exact test; this was also done for CRc. Event-free survival was calculated as the interval from the date 
of randomization to the date of treatment failure, relapse from CR, death from any cause, or the last 
follow-up examination, whichever occurred first. Progression-free survival was calculated as the 
interval from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression/relapse or death from any 
cause, whichever occurred first. Analyses for EFS and PFS were similar to OS. Relapse-free survival 
was calculated as the interval from the date of CR to the date of relapse, death from any cause, or last 
follow up examination, whichever occurred first. Kaplan-Meier product limit estimators were used to 
describe the results. 
The methods used for the primary OS analysis were applied to the ad hoc analysis of mature survival 
data (clinical cut off 29 Oct 2010; referred to as CCO 2010). The p-value from this analysis was 
considered nominal. 
Results 
Participant flow 
At the time of CCO 2009, 46 subjects (9.5%) were ongoing; 15 (6.2%) in the TC arm and 31 (12.8%) 
in the DACOGEN arm. The number of subjects who discontinued was 439 (90.5%); 228 (93.8%) in the 
TC arm and 211 (87.2%) in the DACOGEN arm. Progressive disease (PD) was the most common 
reason attributed by the investigators for discontinuation from treatment. This occurred in 212 
(43.7%) subjects overall; 116 (47.7%) in the TC arm and 96 (39.7%) in the DACOGEN arm. At the 
time of CCO 2010, 10 subjects (2.1%) remained on treatment (7 [2.9%] in the DACOGEN arm and 3 
[1.2%] in the TC arm, all in the cytarabine group), and 475 subjects (97.9%) had discontinued study 
treatment; mostly due to PD (36%) or an AE (33%).

Recruitment 
Study DACO-16 was a multicenter, multinational study conducted in 65 clinical sites throughout 
Eastern Europe, North America/Australia, Western Europe, and Asia.  
The study was initiated the 12 January 2006 (Date of the first study-related procedure/observation 
recorded as part of the database) and completed the 28 October 2009 (Date of the last subject 
recorded as part of the database; clinical cut-off date for the primary analysis). 
The clinical cut-off for the mature survival and the updated safety analysis date was 29 October 2010. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol, dated 18 July 2005, was never executed. There were a total of 5 protocol 
amendments. Amendment 1 was implemented before the first subject was enrolled.

Outcomes and estimation 
At the time of CCO 2009, 396 total deaths had occurred (199 in the TC arm and 197 in the DACOGEN 
arm). The median OS in the ITT population was 5.0 months (95% CI: 4.3, 6.3) in the TC arm and 7.7 
months (95% CI: 6.2, 9.2) in the DACOGEN arm, which represents a 2.7-month difference or a 54% 
improvement over TC. The estimated hazard ratio (HR; DACOGEN arm/ TC arm) was 0.85 (95% CI: 
0.69, 1.04) representing a 15% reduction in mortality risk for Dacogen relative to TC. The p-value 
from the stratified logrank test was 0.1079. 
A summary of efficacy results is enclosed below in the table below. Results for the analysis of mature 
data are from the CCO 2010; all other results are from CCO 2009.

Supportive study  
Study DACO-017 was a multicenter, single-arm, Phase 2 study of DACOGEN as front-line therapy in 
older patients with AML. Patients at least 60 years of age with newly diagnosed histologically confirmed 
de novo or secondary AML and who had poor- or intermediate-risk cytogenetics at baseline were 
eligible. Eligible subjects had an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 and were considered to have 
adequate renal and hepatic function by laboratory evaluation.  
Treatment with DACOGEN consisted of 20 mg/m2 DACOGEN administered as a 1-hour IV infusion daily 
for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was morphologic CR. Key secondary efficacy endpoints included OS, 
CRc, complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), CRp, PR, time to and duration of 
CR, EFS, and RFS. 
A morphologic CR was achieved in 13 of 55 subjects (23.6%) and 1 additional subject achieved a CRi 
(CR with incomplete blood count recovery). The median time to CR was 4.1 months. Five of the 13 
subjects with CR had relapsed as of the CCO and the median duration of response was 18.2 months. 
The median OS was 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.7, 11.5).  
Overall, these results are consistent with what observed in the pivotal study. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Applicant has provided results mainly taken from one single pivotal study (DACO-016) and one 
supportive phase II study (DACO-017) where decitabine was administered as front-line therapy in 
older patients with AML. 
The pivotal study was a randomized, open-label, phase III study designed to compare decitabine with 
patient's choice with physician's advice of supportive care or low dose of cytarabine (treatment’s 
choice, TC). 
Baseline characteristics were comparable in both studies; however, patients were younger in the 
supportive study. The included patient population was broad and heterogeneous.  
The dosing regimen was the same in both two studies. 
In the pivotal study, the primary efficacy endpoint was OS and the key secondary objective was CR. 
In the supportive study, morphologic CR was the primary endpoint. Key secondary efficacy endpoints 
included OS, CRc, complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), CRp, PR, time to 
and duration of CR, EFS, and RFS. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
An increase in median survival of 2.7 months was considered as clinically meaningful in such a 
particular setting.

Potential factors that could have contributed to the primary analysis not reaching statistical significance 
include an i) imbalance in subgroup characteristics, ii) subsequent therapy usage, iii) data censoring in 
the period following the median of the curve. 
Therefore, 2 sensitivity analyses were performed.  
1) A sensitivity analysis of OS that censored data at the time subjects began receiving subsequent 
disease modifying therapy (DMT), defined as induction chemotherapy, azacitidine, and DACOGEN, 
showed a 20% reduction in the risk of death for subjects in the DACOGEN arm The median (95% CI) 
OS was 5.3 (4.3, 6.7) months in the TC arm and 8.5 (6.5, 9.5) months in the DACOGEN arm, and the 
HR was 0.80 (p=0.0437). 
2) A further sensitivity analysis excluded subjects who received a hypomethylating agent as 
subsequent DMT. In this analysis, a 23% reduction in mortality risk was observed with DACOGEN 
treatment compared with TC. The median OS in months (95% CI) was 4.5 (3.8, 5.5) in the TC group 
and 7.9 (6.0, 9.3) in the DACOGEN group. The HR (95% CI) was 0.77 (0.62, 0.94); p-value= 0.0109 
In addition, an analysis of more mature survival data collected 1 year after the initial CCO was 
provided. The results were consistent with those of the primary study analysis. The median OS (95% 
CI) was 5.0 (4.3, 6.3) months in the TC arm and 7.7 (6.2, 9.2) months in the DACOGEN arm. The 
estimated HR was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.99), nominal p-value=0.0373; representing a slightly larger 
(18%) reduction in the risk of mortality with DACOGEN treatment. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Taken into consideration the data submitted, the CHMP considered that the indication of decitabine 
should be restricted to the treatment of adult patients aged 65 years and above with newly diagnosed 
de novo or secondary AML according to the WHO classification who are not considered candidates for 
standard induction chemotherapy. This proposed age limit is considered acceptable. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Supporting safety data come from 1,114 subjects from 2 studies (Studies DACO-016 and DACO-017) 
in patients with AML (integrated AML population or AML set) and 4 studies in patients with MDS 
(integrated MDS population or MDS set) (Studies DACO-020, ID03-0180, D-0007, EORTC-06011). 
Patient exposure 
The AML set included the two open-label studies DACO-016 and DACO-017. The number of patients 
included in study DACO-017 was small; however, these patients contributed for about 19% of the 
patients exposed to Dacogen, included in AML data set. Patients in study DACO-017 may have dose 
delay and/or 25% dose reduction. Moreover, patients included in the two studies DACO-016 and 
DACO-017 were different in term of duration of exposure. 
Therefore, the two studies data could not a priori be pooled and the results from the provided 
integrated AML studies should be taken with caution. 
Only data collected in study DACO-016 are relevant to provide a comprehensive assessment of the 
safety of DACOGEN in the claimed indication. 
The applicant also presented the MDS set including 4 MDS studies (DACO-020 and ID03-0180; D-0007 
and EORTC-06011). Despite MDS and AML can be considered a continuum of the same myeloid

malignancy, the two diseases are too different in term of prognosis and patient characteristics. 
Moreover population in MDS set was not homogenous. 
Adverse events  
The most frequently observed adverse events in the DACOGEN group of the AML studies (occurring in 
≥ 30% of all subjects) were pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, febrile neutropenia, 
neutropenia, and diarrhea. 
In DACO-16 study report, TEAEs occurring in at least 5% of patients were provided. In the integrated 
AML studies, the limit is 10%. For serious events the limit is 2%.  
All serious AEs >5% reported more frequently in Dacogen group than in Cytarabine group, in study 
DACO-016 are included in SmPC section 4.8. 
For the integrated AML studies, Grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in nearly all subjects in both 
the DACOGEN and cytarabine treatment groups. 
The incidences of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events for subjects in the DACOGEN treatment group were 
slightly higher than those of the cytarabine group. 
The most frequently observed Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were related to myelosuppression, 
consistent with experience in patients with AML. The percentages of AES in relation with 
myelosuppression are higher in DACOGEN treatment group than in cytarabine treatment group. 
In the AML studies, DACOGEN-treated subjects had higher rates of most infections than the cytarabine 
groups, including Grade 3 or 4 infections. Febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection 
were the most common infections. 
Adverse events of special interest: In the integrated AML studies, adverse events of special interest 
were experienced by 89% of subjects in the cytarabine group and 92% in the DACOGEN group: 
•  For all subjects in the AML studies DACO-016 and DACO-017 who received DACOGEN, 73% 
experienced a myelosuppression event; 69% experienced a Grade 3 or 4 event. Leukopenia 
occurred in 13% and 20% of subjects, respectively in the cytarabine and DACOGEN treatment 
groups. 
•  In the AML studies, Decitabine -treated subjects had higher rates of most infections than the 
cytarabine groups, including Grade 3 or 4 infections. Febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and urinary 
tract infection were the most common infections. 
•  In the integrated AML population, bleeding events occurred with similar frequency in DACOGEN 
treated subject (11%) and cytarabine-treated subjects (13%). Gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred 
more frequently with cytarabine treatment, while intracranial bleeding was reported more frequently 
with Decitabine treatment.  
•  In the AML population, skin eruptions occurred more frequently in DACOGEN-treated subjects. These 
were almost exclusively low-grade.  
•  For the AML population, Cardiac Rhythm abnormalities were reported by 20% in the cytarabine 
group, and 19% in the Decitabine group. Tachycardia was experienced by similar percentages of 
subjects in the cytarabine (5%) and Decitabine (6%) groups. In the integrated AML studies, 
neurological events were experienced by 3% of subjects in the cytarabine treatment group and 4%

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were more common in DACOGEN-treated subjects (80%) 
than in subjects treated with cytarabine (73%) due to higher rates of Infections and Infestations, 
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders, and Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders. Moreover 
in Dacogen group, except for “vascular disorders” and “nervous system disorders”, all the percentage 
of serious adverse events are higher than in cytarabine group.

For the AML studies, Grade 3 or 4 serious adverse events were experienced by 34% of subjects in the 
Supportive Care group, 63% in the cytarabine group, and 73% in the Decitabine group. System organ 
classes with the highest incidences of Grade 3 or 4 serious adverse events were Infections and 
Infestations (Supportive Care: 28%; cytarabine: 30%; Decitabine: 47%) and Blood and Lymphatic 
System Disorders (Supportive Care: 0%; cytarabine: 28%; Decitabine: 35%). The most frequently 
reported serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia (Supportive Care: 0%; cytarabine: 15%; 
Decitabine: 24%) and pneumonia (Supportive Care: 10%; cytarabine: 14%; Decitabine: 18%). In the 
integrated AML studies, the percentages of early deaths were comparable between the cytarabine 
(8.7%) and Decitabine (8.5%) treatment groups. 
In the integrated AML studies, the percentages of early deaths were comparable between the 
cytarabine (8.7%) and DACOGEN (8.5%) treatment groups. In the integrated AML studies, the 
percentages of subjects who died during treatment or within 30 days after the last dose of study drug 
were 30.3% in the cytarabine treatment group and 32.8% in the DACOGEN treatment groups. The 
Applicant states that more deaths were attributed to cardiac causes in DACOGEN-treated subjects in 
DACO-016 (13 subjects who received DACOGEN versus 6 who received cytarabine), more than 60% of 
these cases were from a single country (Poland), with 6 cases from a single site.  
Laboratory findings 
A high percentage of subjects entered the study with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil 
count [ANC]; 62% [313/506]) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count; 47% [229/486]). The majority of 
subjects in all treatment groups entered the study with Grade 2 anemia (Hb). Baseline WBC counts 
varied, reflecting both leukopenia and leukocytosis. In the AML study subjects, high percentages of 
subjects experienced Grade 3 or 4 laboratory test results at some time during treatment. In the 
Decitabine group, 89% (236/266) of subjects reported Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (ANC). 
In the DACOGEN group, Grade 4 laboratory test results were reported for no more than 1% of 
subjects. Grade 3 laboratory test results were reported for no more than 1% of subjects with the 
exceptions of ALT (3% [9/278]), and hyperglycemia (10% [28/284]). 
Two (1%) subjects shifted from normal (Grade 0 or 1) creatinine values at baseline to Grade 3 during 
treatment. No subject experienced a Grade 4 creatinine result in any treatment group. 
In the cytarabine group, there were no Grade 4 test results for any chemistry analyse. Grade 3 test 
results were reported for no more than 3% of subjects except hyperglycemia (6% [11/196]). 
Safety in special populations 
In the DACOGEN treatment group, there was a higher incidence of treatment discontinuation due to 
adverse events in women compared to men (43% versus 32%).  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies with decitabine have been conducted. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the integrated AML studies, treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred 
more frequently in the cytarabine group than the DACOGEN group. Drug-related adverse events 
leading to discontinuation were rare and most often due to the expected complications of 
Assessment report

Page 68/79 
 
 
 
 
myelosuppression and infection. Serious adverse events and drug-related serious adverse events 
leading to discontinuation occurred at similar rates in the active treatment groups. 
In the Dacogen arm (integrated AML studies) 37% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse 
events. 
Post marketing experience 
An estimate of cumulative post marketing exposure from launch of DACOGEN to 30 December 2010 
was approximately 43,000 treatment courses assuming the 3-Day dosing regimen, an average body 
surface area of 1.73 m², and 3 cycles of treatment (27 3-hour infusions). The post-marketing safety 
database, which captures spontaneous adverse event reporting, retrieved a total of 448 cases of which 
335 were considered serious (74.7%). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the clinical development programme of Dacogen included 1,114 patients who received at least 
one dose of decitabine, regardless of the disease (AML/MDS), dosage and treatment duration. The 
clinical safety analysis was mainly based on two studies (Studies DACO-016 and DACO-017) in patients 
with AML and four studies in patients with MDS (Studies DACO-020, ID03-0180, D-0007, EORTC-
06011). 
Patients who were included in the AML studies were unfortunately different in term of exposure. 
Therefore, the two studies could a priori not be pooled and results taken from the provided integrated 
AML study analysis should be taken with caution. And only data collected in the pivotal study DACO-
016 are considered relevant to provide a comprehensive assessment of the safety of DACOGEN in the 
claimed indication, i.e. the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary 
AML. 
More than 99% of subjects in the DACOGEN and cytarabine treatment groups experienced adverse 
events. All types of adverse events occurred at lower rates in the TC group.  
Myelosuppression and complications of myelosuppression, including infections and bleeding that occur 
in patients with AML may be exacerbated with Dacogen treatment. In clinical studies, the majority of 
patients had baseline Grade 3/4 myelosuppression. In patients with baseline Grade 2 abnormalities, 
worsening of myelosuppression was seen in most patients and more frequently than in patients with 
baseline Grade 1 or 0 abnormalities. Myelosuppression caused by Dacogen is reversible. Complete 
blood and platelet counts should be performed regularly, as clinically indicated and prior to each 
treatment cycle. In the presence of myelosuppression or its complications, treatment with Dacogen 
may be interrupted or supportive measures instituted. 
The percentage of patients experiencing treatment emergent adverse events leading to dose delay or 
cycle delay was higher in Dacogen group than in cytarabine group. The SmPC section 4.2 highlights 
that approximately one-third of patients receiving DACOGEN required a dose-delay. 
In DACO-016 patients received a median of 10 weeks of cytarabine treatment and 19 weeks of 
DACOGEN treatment. The exposure-adjusted death rate should be used with caution especially in 
oncology area. Therefore, the list of adverse drug reactions presented in Section 4.8 of the SmPC 
highlights those adverse reactions which had a fatal outcome and that in clinical studies, 30% of 
patients treated with DACOGEN and 25% of patients treated in the comparator arm had adverse 
events with an outcome of death during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study drug.

As expected from its mechanism of action interacting with DNA methylation, decitabine is teratogenic 
in animals, causes impairment on male fertility and is mutagenic. No clinical data are available. 
Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults. The incidence of AML 
increases with age and is primarily a disease of older (>60 years) individuals. Over this age 
pregnancies are not expected but we can easily imagine that younger women could be exposed 
especially because of the possible use of decitabine to treat severe sickle cell disease. 
Having all these elements in mind, the CHMP agrees with the wording of section 4.4, as proposed by 
the Applicant.  
Patients with a history of severe congestive heart failure or clinically unstable cardiac disease were 
excluded from clinical studies and therefore the safety and efficacy of Dacogen in these patients has 
not been established. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of decitabine is globally in accordance with what could be expected from a 
cytotoxic compound in such a setting. The incidence of serious and/or drug related AEs was slightly 
higher in the decitabinearm than in the TC/Cytarabine arm. Infections were the most commonly 
reported drug related adverse event: decitabine -treated subjects had higher rates of most infections 
than the cytarabine groups, including Grade 3 or 4 infections. Febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and 
urinary tract infection were the most common infections.  
Percentages of early deaths were comparable between the cytarabine (8.7%) and decitabine (8.5%) 
treatment groups. Percentages of subjects who died during treatment or within 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug were also similar: 30.3% in the cytarabine treatment group and 32.8% in the 
decitabine treatment groups. More deaths were apparently attributed to cardiac causes in decitabine -
treated subjects in DACO-016 (13 subjects who received decitabine versus 6 who received cytarabine).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Decitabine is a cytidine deoxynucleoside analogue intended for the treatment of adult patients with 
newly diagnosed de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia. Acute myeloid leukemia is a clonal 
disorder caused by malignant transformation of a bone marrow-derived, myeloid stem cell or 
progenitor cell, which demonstrates arrested maturation and aberrant differentiation. Untreated, AML 
is a rapidly progressing and fatal disease that requires prompt attention. 
The management of older patients with AML is guided by performance status, cytogenetics, and the 
presence of comorbidities which limit the ability of the patient to tolerate cytotoxic (combination) 
induction chemotherapy. For patients 75 years or older, or those less than 75 for whom intensive 
chemotherapy is not appropriate, palliative therapy with hydroxyurea or 6-mercaptopurine with 
supportive care measures are used for white blood cell count control. Several studies suggested that 
low-dose cytarabine may be effective in this population. 
This MAA is mainly based on one single pivotal study, a Phase III, randomized, multicenter study of 
DACOGEN compared with Treatment Choice (TC) consisting of the subject’s choice (with physician’s 
advice) of the current standard-care options of low-dose cytarabine or supportive care. These results 
are supported by a single-arm, Phase II study, DACO-017, in patients with AML. 
The main objective of the pivotal study was to compare DACOGEN, administered at a dose of 20 
mg/m2 once daily for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks, with TC. Overall, 485 subjects were enrolled. 
The analysis of the primary endpoint shows an increase in median survival of 2.7 months, which is 
considered as clinically meaningful in such a particular setting. However, it did not reach statistical

significance (p=0.1079) during the first analysis. Statistical significance was only reached after a 
second post hoc analysis with methodological concerns (HR 0.82, CI 0.68, 0.99, p=0.0373). 
A statistically significant difference was also shown for the secondary endpoint of CR+CRp rate in 
favour of DACOGEN (17.8%) versus TC (7.8%), p=0.0011 and the median time to response was 
4.3 months (95% CI: 3.8, 5.1) and responses were durable (median: 8.3 months, 95% CI: 6.2, 11.4). 
The median PFS was 2.1 months in the TC arm and 3.7 months in the DACOGEN arm (HR=0.75; 95% 
CI: 0.62, 0.91, p=0.0031). 
The beneficial effects seen in the pivotal study were also seen in the small uncontrolled phase II study 
with a reported median EFS of 5.7 months (CI 3.1, 8.1), response rate of 23.6% (CI 13.2, 37) and 
overall survival of 7.6 months (CI 5.7, 11.5). In addition, patients in the age group between 60 to 64 
years were also recruited in this phase II study and showed similar results to patients in older age 
groups (median OS patients 60-64 years 7.7 months, CI: 3.5, 15.2). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
None. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
More than 99% of subjects in the DACOGEN and cytarabine treatment groups experienced adverse 
events. All types of adverse events occurred at lower rates in the TC group. 
The most frequently observed adverse events in the decitabine group of the AML studies (occurring in 
≥ 30% of all subjects) were pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, nausea, febrile neutropenia, 
neutropenia, and diarrhoea. The most frequently observed Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were related 
to myelosuppression, as expected in AML population. In the AML studies, DACOGEN-treated subjects 
had higher rates of most infections than the cytarabine groups, including Grade 3 or 4 infections. 
Febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection were the most common infections. 
Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were more common in decitabine -treated subjects (80%) 
than in subjects treated with cytarabine (73%) due to higher rates of Infections and Infestations, 
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders, and Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders. Moreover 
in the decitabine group, except for “vascular disorders” and “nervous system disorders”, all the 
percentage of serious adverse events are higher than in cytarabine group. 
In the integrated AML studies, the percentages of subjects who died during treatment or within 30 
days after the last dose of study drug were 30.3% in the cytarabine treatment group and 32.8% in the 
decitabine treatment groups. The Applicant states that more deaths were attributed to cardiac causes 
in decitabine -treated subjects in DACO-016; more than 60% of these cases were from a single 
country (Poland), with 6 cases from a single site. 
Ninety-eight percent of the 530 subjects in the integrated AML studies discontinued treatment, most 
often due to disease progression in the cytarabine (55%) and decitabine (44%) groups. For the 530 
subjects in the integrated AML studies, adverse events led to treatment discontinuation for 10% of 
subjects in the Supportive Care group, 47% in the cytarabine group, and 37% in the Decitabine group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/620205/2012  
Page 76/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported events leading to treatment discontinuation were disease progression 
(cytarabine: 16%; decitabine: 11%), and general physical health deterioration (cytarabine: 13%; 
decitabine: 9%). In the Supportive Care group, the most frequently reported adverse event leading to 
treatment discontinuation was bronchopneumonia (7%; cytarabine: <1%; decitabine: <1%). Drug-
related adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were experienced by 8% of subjects in the 
cytarabine group and 7% in the decitabinegroup. The majority of these were due to myelosuppressive 
events or infections. No drug-related adverse event led to treatment discontinuation for more than 1% 
of subjects in either treatment group. 
The overall safety profile of Dacogen was similar to low dose cytarabine and while some undesirable 
effects were seen more often with Dacogen (such as infections and febrile neutropaenia) it may be due 
to the longer exposure to Dacogen treatment (median 4 cycles Dacogen versus 2 cycles Cytarabine). 
The use of supportive anti-infectives and cytokines was also similar in both treatment arms. 
Non clinical data have shown irreversible inhibition of spermatogenesis but the relevance of this finding 
is considered limited in the older AML patient population. 
No data is available in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment but no significant toxicity was 
seen in relation to the kidneys or liver. There is appropriate caution wording in the SPC for the use of 
Dacogen in patients with liver impairment and renal impairment. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The extent of data submitted (682 subjects treated with Dacogen) is satisfactory and no significant 
uncertainty regarding unfavourable effects has been raised.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The analysis of the primary endpoint of the pivotal study shows an increase in median survival of 2.7 
months, which is considered as clinically meaningful in such a particular setting. Statistical significance 
was reached after a second post hoc analysis.  
Response rates showed also a highly significant benefit in favour of DACOGEN. Most of all, responses 
were  durable.  The  difference  in  median  PFS  was  statistically  significant  and  in  favour  of  the  Dacogen 
arm. Most of these beneficial effects were also observed in the small uncontrolled phase II study. 
Given the very poor prognosis in this cancer population an improvement in survival of at least an extra 
2.7  months  is  considered  of  clinical  relevance.  Other  favourable  effects  in  response  rate,  progression 
free  survival  and  event  free  survival  when  compared  to  standard  of treatment  are  also  considered to 
be very important from the clinical point of view. 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  decitabineis  globally  in  accordance  with  what  could  be  expected  from  a 
cytotoxic compound in such a setting.

Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance is considered positive in view of the clinically relevant effect in terms of overall 
survival and an acceptable safety profile. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Benefits of currently available treatments for AML are diminished with advancing age because of the 
greater frequency of poor prognostic indicators: an increase in median survival of 2.7 months, as 
observed in study DACO-016 is therefore considered as clinically meaningful in such a particular 
setting. 
The issue of a possible positive impact of patients who might benefit from induction therapy on study 
DACO-016 results has been addressed by a post-hoc analysis that only included patients who would 
not be considered suitable for induction chemotherapy.  This analysis, which showed that 
approximately 94% of patients in DACO-016 would not be considered suitable for induction 
chemotherapy, was not meaningfully different from the ITT-analysis.  As a consequence, it is 
considered that the use of Dacogen should be limited to to  adult patients aged 65 years and above 
with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML according to the WHO classification who are not 
considered candidates for standard induction chemotherapy.  
4. Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Dacogen is not similar to Ceplene, Trisenox and Vidaza 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Dacogen in the treatment of adult patients age 65 years and above 
with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), according to the World 
Health Organisation (WHO) classification, who are not candidates for standard induction 
chemotherapy, is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation.

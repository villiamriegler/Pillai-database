.1 
Introduction 
ylagren  75mg  film-coated  tablets  are  generic  medicinal  products  containing  clopidogrel  as 
Z
clopidogrel  hydrogensulphate  as  active  substance.  The  reference  medicinal  product  is  Plavix  75  mg 
film-coated tablets, which contains clopidogrel hydrogensulphate.  
lopidogrel is a non-competitive inhibitor of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at the platelet receptors. 
C
The  effect  of  ADP  on  platelets  is  mediated  by  two  G-protein  coupled  P2Y  receptors  (P2Y1  and 
P2Y12) and the cation channel-coupled P2X1 receptor. The adenylate cyclase-coupled ADP receptor 
P2Y12 is the main target of clopidogrel and lead to inhibition of platelet activation, aggregation, and 
Gp  IIb/IIIa  receptor  activation.  Clopidogrel  is  a  thienopyridine  and  only  the  S-enantiomer  is 
pharmacologically active. 
he safety and efficacy profile of clopidogrel has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, details 
T
of  which  can  be  found  in  the  EPAR  for  Plavix.  In  addition,  there  is  a  long-term  post-marketing 
experience  contributing  to  the  knowledge  of  the  clinical  use  of  this  product.  Zylagren  75mg  film-
coated  tablet  contains  clopidogrel  hydrogesulphate.  Since  this  application  is  a  generic  application 
referring  to  the  reference  medicinal  product  Plavix,  summary  of  the  clinical  data  of  clopidogrel 
hydrogensulphate is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics 
and efficacy and safety have been conducted with clopidogrel hydrogensulphate.  
he  indication  for  Zylagren  is  different  from  the  reference  medicinal  product.  It  is  part  of  the

dihydrothieno[3,2-c] pyridine-5(4H)-acetate hydrogen sulphate.  
ly insoluble in water at neutral pH, 
It is a white to off-white or yellowish crystalline powder practical
freely soluble in water at pH 1 and in some organic solvents like methanol. The chemical structure of 
clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate has been confirmed with nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR, 13C-
NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), infrared spectrometry (IR) and elemental microanalysis. Clopidogr
hydrogen sulphate exists in two polymorphic forms, form I and II. The proposed manufacturing 
process produces consistently the form I and this has been confirmed with X-Ray powder diffract
and FT-IR spectra. The molecule includes a chiral atom of carbon and therefore exhibits 
diasteromerism. The active substance is the S-, (+)- diastereomer.

Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
• 
The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  obtain  immediate-release  tablets  containing 
qualitatively  and  quantitatively  the  same  active  substance  and  exhibiting  the  same  bioavailability  as 
the  already  marketed  reference  product  PLAVIX  75  mg  film-coated  tablets  in  order  to  comply  with 
the regulations pertaining to abridged applications in the European Union. 
Zylagren  does  not  have  exactly  the  same  qualitative  composition  with  the  reference  product  with 
regards to excipients. In Zylagren lactose is used as filler and pregelatinised starch as binder compared 
to  mannitol  and  hypromellose  used  in  Plavix  respectively  However,  the  chosen  excipients  raise  no 
concerns  since  they  are  well-established  and  commonly  used  in  the  manufacture  of  solid  dosage 
forms.  All  excipients  used  in  the  product  are  of  non-animal  origin  and  comply  with  their 
corresponding European Pharmacopoeia monographs. 
As clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate is unstable in the presence of excessive amounts of water direct 
compression was chosen for manufacturing the Zylagren tablets.  In order to cover the unpleasant taste 
of the active ingredient the tablets are film-coated. 
The  immediate  packaging  material  consists  of  OPA-Alu-PVC  blisters  and  has  been  demonstrated 
through stability studies to provide a good protection from water. 
Three batches of CLOPIDOGREL hydrogen sulphate 75mg, film-coated tablets have been compared 
to two batches of the reference PLAVIX.Related substances and enantiomeric purity results show that 
both products are comparable in terms of impurity profile 
A discriminatory dissolution test has been developed for routine testing of the clopidogrel tablets. An 
acidic  dissolution  medium  has  been  chosen  (0.1  M  HCl),  because  the  solubility  of  clopidogrel 
hydrogen  sulphate  decreases  as  the  pH  values  increase  and  the  requirements  for  sink  conditions  are 
met only at acidic conditions (900 ml of 0.1M HCl). The influence of the particle size of the active 
substance (from mean 11 µm to 97 µm) on the dissolution profile has been tested and it was found that 
the dissolution profile is not significantly different whatever the mean particle size is within the range 
that is set in the active substance specifications.  
Comparative dissolution profiles between the reference product and Zylagren were performed in three 
different  dissolution  media (0.1 M Hydrochloric acid, Acetate buffer solution pH 4.5 and Phosphate 
buffer  solution  pH  6.8).  The  results  show  that  Zylagren  expresses  similar  dissolution  profiles  in  all 
three  dissolution  media  and  that  the  dissolution  profiles  are  comparable  with  that  of  the  reference 
product.  
The bioequivalence study was performed using as reference the biobatch No. 600711 of Plavix 75 mg 
tablets  manufactured  by  Sanofi-Synthelabo  Limited,  UK  (expired  date  02/2009)  has  been  used  in 
bioequivalence study. The biobatch No. P11092 of Clopidogrel 75 mg tablets (hydrogen sulphate salt) 
manufactured by Krka, Novo Mestro, d.d., Slovenia in 11/2007 has been used as the tested product in 
the bioequivalence study. 
Manufacture of the Product 
• 
The  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  direct  compression  process  and  consists  of  the  following 
steps: screening, mixing, compression to tablets and film-coating. 
All critical process parameters have been identified and controlled by appropriate in process controls. 
The  validation  report  from  3  production  scale  batches  demonstrates  that  the  process  is  reproducible 
and provides a drug product that complies with the in-process and finished product specifications. 
Product Specification 
• 
The  specification  for  the  finished  product  at  release  and  shelf  life  includes  tests  for  appearance, 
uniformity  of  dosage  units,  identification  (HPLC,  TLC),  assay  (HPLC),  identification  of  titanium 
dioxide and iron oxides, related substances, microbiological quality, enantiomeric purity, dissolution, 
hardness, , disintegration and water content.  
All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. 
Batch analysis data from 3 production scale and 6 supportive batches have been presented. All batches 
met the test limits as defined in the release specification and test methodology valid at the time of 
batch release.

Stability of the Product 
• 
Stability  studies  were  carried  out  on  3  production  scale  batches  of  tablets  according  to  the  ICH 
requirements.  Samples  were  packaged  in  the  same  immediate  packaging  as  the  one  intended  for 
marketing. were stored at 25oC/60 % RH for 24 months and in 40oC/75 % RH for 6 months.  
The parameters tested were appearance, assay, water content, hardness, related substances, 
enantiomeric purity, dissolution, and microbiological tests. The analytical procedures used were the 
same as those used for routine testing and have been shown to be stability indicating. 
In addition photostability tests have been performed in accordance with ICH guideline Q 1 B. 
In all cases the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the 
commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SPC.  
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects. 
The quality of Zylagren is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and 
pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. There are no major 
deviations from EU and ICH requirements. 
The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  and  documented.  The  excipients  are  commonly  used  in 
these  types  of  formulations  and  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  requirements.  The  packaging  material  is 
commonly used and well documented. The manufacturing process of the finished product is a standard 
process  that  has  been  adequately  described.  Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH 
guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life. 
In comparison with the EU reference product Zylagren has been shown to have the same qualitative 
and quantitative composition in terms of the active substance. The excipients used are mostly the same 
with some minor modifications. Both the EU reference product (Plavix) and Zylagren exhibit similar 
dissolution profiles. 
2.3  Non-Clinical aspects   
Clopidogrel  is  widely  used  well-known  substance.  Its  pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and 
toxicological  properties  are  well  characterised  and  new  non  clinical  studies  were  not  provided.  This 
generic application contains the same salt of the active substance as the reference medicinal product. A 
summary  of  the  literature  with  regard  to  non-clinical  data  of  clopidogrel  hydrogensulphate  were 
provided. Further studies are not required, because the active substance used in reference product and 
the  generic  product  are  the  same  and  the  overview  based  on  the  literature  is,  thus,  appropriate. 
Although  the  in  vitro  studies  did  not  reveal  any  mutagenic,  genotoxic  or  clastogenic  potential  of 
clopidogrel, the CHMP raised a major objection with respect to the studies on impurities, which did do 
not  follow  recommendations  of  the  OECD  guideline,  protocol  471  (OECD,  1997,  Test  Guideline 
47:Bacterial  Reverse  Mutation  Test.  In:  OECD  Guideline  for  Testing  of  Chemicals.  Paris, 
Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  &  Development)  and  of  the  Question  &  Answers  on  the 
CHMP  guideline  on  the  limits  of  genotoxic  impurities  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/431994/2007).    In 
response, adequately conducted reverse mutation assays in accordance with GLP standards and OECD 
guideline protocol number 471 was provided. The results of the Ames test performed with potassium 
ethyl  sulphate  and  clopidogrel  isopropyl  sulphate  indicated  that  these  two  substances  do  not  hold  a 
mutagenic  potential.  Thus,  the  content  limit  for  monoalkylsulphates  as  proposed  by  the  applicant  is 
acceptable to the CHMP. 
Introduction  of  the  product  onto  the  market  is  unlikely  to  result  in  any  significant  increase  in  the 
combined sales volumes for all clopidorel hydrogensulphate products, and would thus not be expected 
to have an adverse effect upon the environment. With this regard and on the basis of CHMP Guideline 
on Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (CPMP/SWP/4447/00), a 
formal environmental risk assessment is not considered necessary.

was  conducted  successfully  in  order  to  allow  this  transfer.  However,  there  were  insufficient  data 
submitted with respect to the pre-study validation and validation of the bio-analytical technique used 
for determination of clopidogrel, and the CHMP questioned the validity of the bioequivalence study. 
Thus, a GCP inspection was requested. 
PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES  
The  main  investigated  pharmacokinetics  parameters  for  clopidogrel  and  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid 
were AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax. 
STATISTICAL METHODS   
Parametric ANOVA analysis on ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax was carried out for analytes, 
clopidogrel  and  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid.  The  statistical  model  included  sequence,  period  and 
treatment factors as fixed effects and subject within sequence as random effect. A non parametric test 
was carried out to compare Tmax.

*log-transformed values 
The following acceptance criteria were set as per clinical study report:  
- 
- 
The 90% confidence interval for the exponential of the difference between the test and the 
reference product for the ln-transformed parameters AUC0-t and AUCinf should be within 80-
125%. 
The 90% confidence interval for the exponential of the difference between the test and the 
reference product for the ln-transformed parameter Cmax should be within 75-133%. 
The proposed 90% confidence intervals for AUCt and AUCinf are in line with the recommendation of 
the CHMP guideline CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 and the observed results of the clinical study 
fulfil  this  requirement.  However,  the  widening  of  the  limits  for  bioequivalence  conclusions  for  Cmax 
values, although not in line with the current CHMP recommendations, was not considered necessary 
since  the  Cmax  results  of  the  study  are  within  the  standard  80-125%  limits  required  by  the  NƒG  on 
Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98.  No  significant 
difference in Tmax was evidenced by the non parametric test. 
No serious adverse events (SEAs) were reported during this study. Overall, clopidogrel demonstrated 
a good safety profile. The risk of bleeding is the most important adverse effect of clopidogrel, which 
might be even increased when clopidogrel is concomitantly used with ASA.  No significant changes in 
the subjects' state of health were observed and it is believed that Zylagren 75 mg film coated tablet is 
safe when used according to the SmPC. 
From  the  96  subjects  included  in  the  study,  four  were  withdrawn  for  personal  reasons  or  non-
compliance. 92 subjects finished the study and 91 subjects were included in the data set for statistical 
analysis, since one subject was excluded from the statistical analysis because clopidogrel carboxylic 
acid  was  detected  pre-dose  in  period  one  of  the  trial.  All  withdrawn  and  discontinued  subjects  are 
documented and validity is justified.  
(cid:131)  Conclusions 
Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study  08-210,  Zylagren  is  considered  bioequivalent  with 
Plavix.

Discussion on Clinical aspects 
One clinical bioequivalence trial (08-210) was provided for Zylagren (clopidogrel hydrogensulphate). 
At the time of approval of the reference product Plavix (clopidogrel hydrogensulphate), there was no 
reliable  and  validated  methodology  for  the  determination  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  parent 
prodrug  clopidogrel,  or  of  the  active  metabolite  clopidogrel  thiol.  Thus,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile 
was established based on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel carboxylic acid, which is the major non-
active metabolite.  In the meantime, a reliable bio-analytical method for determination of clopidogrel 
in plasma and urine has been developed. Since the pharmacokinetic profile of the active metabolite is 
still  not  well  established,  the  CHMP  accepted  the  proof  of  bioequivalence  based  on  the  clopidogrel 
parent  compound  data.  Thus,  data  related  to  pharmacokinetics  of  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid  are 
considered  supportive,  whereas  data  on  clopidogrel  parent  drug  is  important  for  the  confirmation  of 
bioequivalence.

The indication of Zylagren is different from that of the reference medicinal product, Plavix (please see 
section  2.1).  Thus,  the  Product  Information  has  been  adequately  amended  to  reflect  this  change  and 
this is considered acceptable.  
Furthermore, the recently published literature data indicate that the bioavailability of a single oral dose 
of clopidogrel and the pharmacokinetic parameters of clopidogrel, especially Cmax and AUCinf, might 
be  increased  by  several  folds  in  the  fed  condition  compared  to  the  fasted  condition.  The  currently 
presented clinical studies were conducted in fasted state and thus, the CHMP requested a clarification 
of  this  approach  and  adequate  justification  why  bioequivalence  for  the  generic  product  should  be 
demonstrated only under fasting condition was provided. Bioequivalence studies in fasting conditions 
are  normally  recommended  as  mentioned  in  the  Questions  &  Answers  on  the  Bioavailability  and 
Bioequivalence  Guideline  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006)  document  as  this  situation  would  be 
more sensitive to differences in pharmacokinetics. In addition the dissolution studies using clopidogrel 
hydrogen sulphate conducted at three different pH values (1.2, 4.5, 6.8) and mimicking the conditions 
of a fed state did not reveal any major differences when compared to the reference product. 
The  bio-analytical  technique  and  methodology  applied  in  the  analysis  of  the  samples  during  the 
bioequivalence  studies  included  validation  with  the  analysis  of  calibration  curves  and  controls  at 
various concentrations. The CHMP questioned whether there is a potential for back-conversion of the 
quantitatively  major  metabolite  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid  to  the  parent  drug.  Considering  that  the 
plasma levels of clopidogrel carboxylic acid are considerably higher than those of the parent drug, a 
minimum back-conversion of the metabolite would lead to a significant over-estimation of clopidogrel 
plasma  levels  and  would  bias  the  outcome  of  the  bioequivalence  study.  The  back-conversion  could 
occur in the presence of alcohol used in sample preparation and analysis. It was, indeed, reported that 
a possible back-conversion of clopidogrel metabolite to clopidogrel parent drug was evidenced in the 
presence  of  methanol.  In  order  to  avoid  this  process,  the  extraction  procedure  was  changed  and 
methanol-free conditions employed. Although it has been indicated that stability tests were performed 
in  order  to  prove  the  reproducibility  and  accuracy  of  clopidogrel  concentration  measurements,  the 
CHMP  questioned  these  results  since  no  clear  description  of  the  analytical  technique  including 
extraction  procedure  actually  used  in  the  initial  pre-study  validation  process  was  provided. 
Information on the validation procedures in study 08-210 was requested by the CHMP. In response, 
details of the bio-analytical methodology and full validation details were provided demonstrating that 
no methanol, which is needed for the conversion the acid metabolite to clopidogrel, was used and thus, 
no  source  of  methylation  exists  within  the  entire  methodology,  including  all  solution  preparation, 
plasma  sample  processing,  handling  storage  and  LC-MS/MS  determination.  The  CHMP  considered 
this issue resolved. 
Considering  the  above  difficulties  in  the  determination  of  clopidogrel  in  plasma  especially  the  issue 
related  to  the  possible  back-conversion  of  the  metabolite  to  the  parent  drug,  a  triggered  GCP 
inspection  of  the  bioequivalence  study  was  requested  by  the  CHMP,  which  was  of  the  opinion  that 
results  of  this  inspection  and  the  satisfactory  responses  to  its  findings  were  an  integral  part  of  the 
evaluation procedure. The inspection identified major and minor findings that seem not to affect the 
overall results of the trial.  
The  bioequivalence  study  08-210  and  its  statistical  evaluation  were  in  accordance  with  accepted 
standards  for  bioequivalence  testing,  as  stated  in  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of 
Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98).  The  parameters  used  to  establish 
bioavailability included the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the maximal plasma 
concentration  of  the  parent  compound  of  clopidogrel.  The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  these 
parameters  were  within  the  recommended  80-125%  range  for  clopidogrel,  required  by  the  above 
mentioned guideline. The proposed widening of the 90% confidence interval for clopidogrel Cmax to 
75%-133% was found to be unacceptable by the CHMP; nevertheless, since the confidence intervals 
for Cmax values of clopidogrel were within the required 80-125% range, the need for widening of the 
intervals was not applicable. The bioequivalence with Plavix was proven.

Pharmacovigilance  
(cid:131)  PSUR 
The  PSUR  submission  schedule  for  Zylagren  should  follow  PSURs  submission  schedule  for  the 
reference medicinal product. 
(cid:131)  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system (DescPhSys 000001/16 (09 January 2009) 
as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.  The company must ensure that this 
system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market. 
(cid:131)  Risk Management Plan 
Risk Management Plan has not been submitted. Since the application concerns generics of respective 
reference  medicinal  products  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring  additional  risk  minimization 
activities have been identified, this considered acceptable. 
2.6 
Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment 
The  application  contains  adequate  quality,  non  clinical  and  clinical  data  and  the  bioequivalence  has 
been shown. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.  
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen 
reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
Recommendation 
”Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  available  data,  the  CHMP  considered  that  by  consensus  the 
benefit/risk ratio of Zylagren in the treatment of: 
“Clopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in: 
−  Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), 
ischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial 
disease.” 
 was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ibritumomab tiuxetan, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
The PRAC considered that the information on myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/ acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) in section 4.8 of the SmPC should be further clarified. It should be specified that the 
frequency ‘common’ attributed to this adverse drug reaction has been derived from a study on 
consolidation therapy after remission induction in previously untreated patients with follicular 
lymphoma. The description of the ADR in the same section of the SmPC should be amended accordingly 
to clarify which statements relate to each of the two indications (consolidation therapy in follicular 
lymphoma vs relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)). The Package Leaflet should also 
be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ibritumomab tiuxetan the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ibritumomab tiuxetan is unchanged subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

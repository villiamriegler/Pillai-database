2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem  statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applied indication is for the field treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic 
keratosis of the face or scalp in adults. 
Actinic keratosis (AK) is an ultra-violet (UV) light-induced pre-cancerous lesion of the skin that 
represents the initial intra-epidermal manifestation of abnormal  keratinocyte proliferation (Röwert-
Huber, 2007; Fernandez Figueras, 2017). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Overall, the prevalence of AK ranges from 33% to 49% in adult males and 14% to 28% in females, 
depending on the country and the study population. AK is common in older, fair-skinned populations of 
European ancestry, and is more frequently observed in men (Flohil, 2013). 
It is by far the most common lesion with malignant potential to arise on the skin. AK is mostly seen in 
fair-skinned persons on skin areas that have had long-term sun exposure (Salasche, 2000). Patients 
with AK tend to have Fitzpatrick type I or II skin (fair skin) which burns and does not tan. In the 
Fitzpatrick classification system skin-types range from very fair (Type I) to very dark (Type VI).  
Epidemiological data show a high occurrence rate of AK.  Regions with higher ultraviolet exposure have 
a higher prevalence of AK. In Europe, a prevalence of 15% in men and 6% in women has been 
documented. Over the age of 70 years, 34% of men and 18% of women were found to have AK 
(Memon et al., 2000). 
AK represents a carcinoma in situ of the skin, and when left untreated, AK can progress to invasive 
SCC (Röwert-Huber,  2007; Werner, 2013; Fernandez Figueras, 2017). Cutaneous SCC represents 20% 
to 50% of skin cancers. Currently, no reliable estimates concerning the frequency of AK developing 
into invasive carcinoma can be given. 
2.1.3.  Biologic  features, aetiology  and pathogenesis 
An actinic keratosis is caused by frequent or intense exposure to UV rays from the sun or tanning beds 
mostly in fair-skinned patients being susceptible to solar damage. The term  actinic keratosis (AK) 
describes clinically ill-defined reddish to reddish-brown scaly lesions on erythematous base in areas 
damaged severely by sunlight. The term does not imply anything about the biology or histopathology 
(Roewert-Huber et al, 2007). 
Actinic keratoses (AKs) have been recognised as precursor of cancer or of precancerous lesions in the 
past but today they are considered as an early in situ squamous cell carcinoma and are categorised in 
several classifications with subdivisions into three grades depending on the amount of atypical 
keratinocytes in the epidermis. The clinical classification following Olsen et al. assesses the severity 
degree of single AK lesions: 
Grade 1: mild (slight palpability,  with actinic keratoses felt better than seen) 
Grade 2: moderate (moderately thick actinic keratoses that are easily seen and felt) 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 9/144 
 
 
 
Grade 3: severe (very thick and/or obvious actinic keratoses) 
2.1.4.  Clinical  presentation,  diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
AK presents as erythematous, scaly patches on the skin of the face, scalp, and extremities and can 
occur as a single lesion or multiple lesions or as an entire field (“field cancerisation”), such as in sun-
exposed areas on the forehead or the back of the hand (Dodds, 2014; Figueras Nart, 2018). An AK 
may regress, persist unchanged, or progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, 
predicting which course each individual lesion will follow is impossible. 
2.1.5.  Management 
AK treatment options consist in two broad categories: surgical destruction of the lesions (e.g. using 
cryosurgery or curettage with or without electrosurgery) and medical therapy (Hofbauer, 2014; 
Werner, 2015; de Berker,  2017; Leitlinienprogramm  Onkologie, 2019). 
The appropriate  treatment is generally chosen based on the number of lesions present and therapy 
may be broadly categorised as either lesion-directed (e.g., cryosurgery) or field-directed (e.g., topical 
products). 
Topical therapy is ideally suited to address multiple lesions and in particular in field cancerisation. 
The following topical field treatments are currently approved in the EU:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Imiquimod 
5-fluorouracil [5-FU] 
5-FU 0.5% in 10% salicylic acid 
Diclofenac sodium  
Aminolevulinic acid 
Methyl aminolevulinate 
The above products vary in terms of tolerability/toxicity and treatment duration. 
Cases of SCC shortly after treatment with Picato (ingenol mebutate) have been reported (Moreno 
Romero,  2015; Maglie, 2018), and a referral for the review of data on skin cancer with Picato was 
concluded by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in April 2020 (EMA/248352/2020). The conclusion 
was that the medicine may increase the risk of skin cancer and that its risks outweigh its benefits. 
Picato is no longer authorised in the EU as the marketing authorisation was withdrawn on 11 February 
2020 at the request of the MAH. 
About the product 
Tirbanibulin disrupts microtubules by direct binding to tubulin, which induces cell cycle arrest and 
apoptotic death of proliferating cells and is associated with disruption of Src tyrosine kinase signalling.   
The initially claimed indication was for the topical field treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-
hypertrophic actinic keratosis of the face or scalp in adults. 
The finally approved indication was for the field treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic 
actinic keratosis (Olsen grade 1) of the face or scalp in adults.  
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 10/144 
 
 
 
Tirbanibulin ointment should be applied to the affected field on the face or scalp once daily for one 
treatment cycle of 5 consecutive days. A thin layer of ointment should be applied to cover the 
treatment field of up to 25cm2 (see SmPC section 5.1).  
Type of Application  and aspects on development 
The clinical development programme  has been structured according to the regulatory advice received 
from Health Authorities.  
Formal guidance was received from the EMA (see section 1.1 Scientific advice). 
At the time of Scientific Advice, the development programme  for the registration dossier consisted of 2 
identical one-year pivotal studies. The CHMP suggested that due to the low but serious risk of 
conversion to squamous cell carcinoma, the applicant may need to gather additional long-term data 
(up to 3 years) and determine the related conversion rate. Given the slow disease progression rate, it 
could be accepted that longer-term than one-year recurrence-rate is provided post-approval.  Plans for 
this longer-term recurrence study (sample size, duration of follow-up) should be part of the MA 
dossier. Since no active comparator  arm is included in the pivotal phase 3 studies, the applicant could 
consider gathering not just safety but also efficacy data in an open, long-term comparative  study, 
where tirbanibulin 1% ointment is compared to an established reference treatment.  
The applicant is planning to conduct a Phase IV, long-term, randomised, active-controlled, 
investigator-blinded, safety and re-treatment study (M-14789-41) in adult patients with AK on the face 
or scalp. 
2.2.  Quality  aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction

431.53 and it has the chemical structure shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Chemical structure of tirbanibulin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 11/144 
 
 
 
 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was adequately elucidated by a combination of elemental 
analysis, mass spectrometry  (MS), IR spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy, Physicochemical properties 
were investigated by thermogravimetric  analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and x-ray powder 
diffraction (XRPD). 
Tirbanibulin appears as white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in 
dimethyl sulfoxide, slightly soluble in ethanol and ethyl acetate, and insoluble in water.  The active 
substance pKas are 3.50, 6.16 (dibasic), and its partition coefficient LogP was found to be 2.78. 
The active substance (AS) is achiral and has no stereocentres. Tirbanibulin exhibits polymorphism. 
Three polymorphic  forms were identified. It has been shown that the manufacturing process 
consistently yields the thermodynamically most stable form. Polymorphism  is controlled in the AS 
specification.  
Manufacture, characterisation  and process controls 
A Major Objection (MO) was raised by CHMP concerning the QP declaration, which was incomplete,  and 
was resolved with the provision of an updated QP declaration.  
The manufacturing process consists of six steps. The choice of the starting materials  has been justified 
in line with ICH Q11, they are controlled by suitable specifications, and are acceptable. Information on 
the manufacturers and suppliers of starting materials has been given. The manufacturing process has 
been described in sufficient detail. Satisfactory information on in-process controls (IPCs) tests and 
critical steps have been provided. Process intermediates were defined and are appropriately  controlled 
The specifications and control methods for intermediate products and reagents have been presented 
and are acceptable. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and have been characterised. Carry-over of impurities  has been discussed and results of 
purging studies have been presented. Genotoxic impurities have been adequately discussed and 
evaluated by two (Q)SAR prediction methodologies performed in line with M7. According to the 
outcome of this evaluation the impurities that need to be controlled in active substance have been 
identified and their limits have been justified. The overall control strategy is acceptable. 
A summary of manufacturing process development activities has been provided. Changes introduced 
have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified.  
The AS container closure system complies with Ph. Eur. requirements for packaging materials.  The 
material used in the manufacture of the primary  packaging material meets the requirement of 
European Directive 10/2011 and all subsequent amendments including 2015/174 and Ph. Eur. 3.1.3. 
Specification 
The AS specification  includes appropriate  tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification 
(HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), palladium (Ph. Eur.), melting point 
(Ph. Eur.), assay, related substances, residual solvents , microbiological  examination (Ph. Eur.) and 
crystal form. 
Specifications for water content, residue on ignition, melting point, and assay are based on batch and 
stability results. The limits for the residual solvents and impurities were established in accordance with 
ICH Q3C and Q3A respectively. The limits for alkylsufonates are below the ICH M7 TTC based on a 
daily dose 20 µg/day. The proposed specifications are justified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 12/144 
 
 
 
The presence of elemental impurities in the AS was evaluated in line with ICH Q3D. Results of batch 
analysis data from three batches obtained by a validated ICP-MS method were below the ICHQ3D PDE. 
Based on this, a test for elemental impurities is accepted not to be included in the specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
the AS has been presented. 
Batch data was provided on representative batches. All the results comply with the proposed AS 
specification and demonstrate consistent manufacture and quality of the AS. 
Stability 
Stability data has been provided for three production scale batches packaged in the proposed container 
closure system. Stability data were provided for up to 36 months stored under long term conditions 
(30±2ºC / 75±5% RH, 2-8ºC and -20±5ºC) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions 
(40±2°C / 75±5% RH), according to the ICH guidelines.  
Samples were tested for appearance, identification, water content, related substances, assay, residue 
on ignition, melting point, microbial  limits and XRPD crystal form. Results met the specifications 
regardless of the storage condition. There was no change in the polymorphic form. No significant 
trends or variability were observed. The 30±2ºC / 75±5% RH condition is not precisely according to 
ICH Q1A (R2) where for long-term stability, recommended conditions are either 30±2°C/ 65±5% RH 
or 25±2°C/ 60±5% RH. However,  because the studied storage conditions are harsher than the typical 
ones at long-term study this is not considered to raise any concerns. 
Stress testing was performed at high humidity, high temperature,  in the presence of acid, alkali, 
oxidant, under reducing conditions and exposure to light. Various degrees of degradation were 
observed. The impurities and assay methods were shown to be stability indicating.  
Photostability testing was carried out on a commercial  scale batch as per ICH Q1B. No degradation was 
found in the light-exposed and the control samples after the exposure of 50 days, indicating that AS is 
not sensitive to light (ICH conditions).  
Based on the available stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage condition, is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description  of the product and pharmaceutical  development 
Klisyri 10 mg/g (1% w/w) ointment is a smooth, creamy white to off-white ointment free from foreign 
particulates. The ointment is composed of the active substance, tirbanibulin, formulated with 
compendial grade excipients, glycerol monostearate 40-55 Type I and propylene glycol, and packaged 
in single-use packets intended for topical use.  Each sachet contains a nominal amount of 250 mg of 
ointment intended for only one single application, which translates into a maximum administration of 
2.5 mg of tirbanibulin over a surface area up to 25 cm2. The development of the finished product (FP) 
has been described in detail and was guided by the quality target product profile (QTPP). 
The AS has sufficient solubility in propylene glycol, the solvent used in the formulation. Tirbanibulin 
can exist in three different polymorphic  forms and the most thermodynamically stable form has been 
used in all clinical supplies and registration stability batches manufactured to date. Polymorphism  and 
particle size are not considered critical quality attributes as tirbanibulin is dissolved in the formulation.

The excipients in tirbanibulin 1% ointment are compendial and commonly used in cutaneous 
formulations. Compatibility of the excipients with the active substance is inferred from the stability 
data on early prototype formulations and as demonstrated on Phase 3 and registration batches. 
The production of the FP involves the dissolution of the AS before incorporation into the dosage form. A 
number of solvents were screened based on the solubility of tirbanibulin. Propylene glycol (PG) is used 
as solvent in the commercial  formulation. The level of PG in the formulation ensures that the AS is 
completely dissolved in PG during formulation processing. 
A series of thickening agents were evaluated for their compatibility in particular with regard to 
appearance of ointment and the miscibility between the solvents and thickening agents. Glycerol 
monostrearate 40-55 was chosen to be used as a thickening agent in the commercial formulation. The 
level of glycerol monostrearate 40-55 in the formulation ensures that the FP has the desired ointment 
consistency. The stability data demonstrated the AS remains solubilised in the FP under long-term and 
immediate storage conditions. To lower the risk of AS precipitation, the recommended storage 
condition for the FP is “do not freeze or refrigerate”. Furthermore, various product batches 
manufactured with different AS batches all yielded smooth ointments with no AS precipitation under 
the recommended storage conditions for up to 24 months for Phase 3 batches and 12 months for 
registration batches. 
Throughout product development, two formulations were used: formula 1 in early trials and formula 2, 
the proposed commercial  formulation, in pharmacokinetic and phase 3 efficacy trials. The differences 
of composition are minor and have been described. In addition, changes to the container closure, 
manufacturer of AS, and manufacturing process parameters  were introduced. These changes were 
evaluated via design of experiments (DoE) and the impact of changes to the formulation were 
compared by batch analysis and in vitro release test (IVRT)  profile comparison.  The batch results show 
the two formulations are comparable,  with some difference in viscosity. The ratios of release rate for 
the 2 formulations (formula 1 and commercial)  was determined using an in vitro release test method 
(IVRT).  The development of the IVRT method, the validation, and the discriminating character over the 
drug load were evaluated and satisfactorily documented. The two formulations can be considered 
comparable.  In addition, the commercial  formulation was used in the pivotal phase 3 studies. The IVRT 
method used to compare formulations during development will be continued for stability testing of the 
registration lots of the FP and release of the process validation batches. Beyond the process validation 
batches, the IVRT test will only be employed to establish comparability  according to the European 
guideline on quality and equivalence of topical products. 
The evolution of the FP manufacturing process from initial prototypes to commercial formulation has 
been clearly described. The process was developed at small scale at a development site and was then 
transferred to a manufacturer which developed the commercial  formulation (formula 2) and 
manufactured clinical supplies packaged into single use sachets. Subsequently, the manufacturing 
process used for Phase 3 clinical material was successfully transferred and optimised at the intended 
commercial  manufacturer, which manufactured the process validation and stability batches. The 
changes to the manufacturing process are overall minor. The process parameters  at the proposed 
commercial  manufacturing site are the same as at the site that produced the clinical batches. The 
formulation evolution was discussed above and was supported by analytical and stability data.  
The applicant has performed and justified a risk assessment on the impact of manufacturing steps on 
the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the FP. Development studies and the results for several batches 
manufactured at commercial  scale support the critical process parameters  (CPPs) target set-points and 
ranges. 
The CQAs of the FP that can potentially be impacted by the formulation and/or process variables were 
identified. All finished product CQAs are included in the FP specification.

EMA/397273/2021  
Page 14/144 
 
 
 
 A comparison of FP batches manufactured at the clinical batches manufacturing site and the proposed 
manufacturer was performed. The manufacturing transfer protocol addressed the minor changes in 
process between the two sites.  
The bulk formulation and product in sachets were compared.  Three batches from each site were tested 
and found comparable.  There are no significant differences in any of the FP quality attributes between 
the batches from either site, including the IVRT assessment of one batch from each site. The results 
indicate that the in vitro release performance of FP batches manufactured at both sites are equivalent. 
The container closure system consists from single-use sachets made from five-layer laminate material 
(web stock) that is heat sealed on four sides. The web stock is composed of linear LDPE (the product 
contact surface)/HPC/aluminum/LDPE/PET. A description including a schematic representation has 
been provided. Compliance with requirements of Ph. Eur. and EC Reg. 10/2011 as amended has been 
declared. A specification for identity of the material  in contact with the finished product has been 
provided. Extractables and leachables were evaluated using ICH M7 (R1) as a guide. The results from 
these studies were provided. The Analytical Evaluation Threshold (AET) was estimated. Detected 
leachables were below the AET and overall below the ADI according to ICH M7. A registration lot will 
continue to be monitored for leachables at the long-term stability condition. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
A MO was raised concerning the manufacturing/importing authorisation (MIA) documentation of the 
proposed site of physical importation into the EU. Another MO was raised because the originally 
submitted GMP documentation for the non-sterility testing site and the physical-chemical testing site 
were older than 3 years; this was resolved by submission of updated compliance documentation.  
The manufacturing process comprises the following main steps: slurry of the active substance in 
propylene glycol; mixing the slurry with propylene glycol and glycerol monostearate 40-55, heating 
under stirring until homogenisation in a single phase, cooling to form the bulk ointment; and filling into 
single use sachets. Critical steps of the process have been identified. The process parameters,  the 
critical steps and IPCs are the same as determined in development of the FP. The methods and the 
limits of IPC parameters were described and are acceptable. The controls implemented assure that the 
manufacturing process is robust and can consistently produce FP meeting the proposed specifications. 
There are no intermediates in the manufacturing process. The holding time of the product in bulk has 
been stated and was supported by relevant stability data and confirmed during process validation. All 
results including microbial purity comply with limits of specification. In addition, the start of shelf-life 
has been stated in line with relevant guideline CPMP/QWP/072/96. 
A MO was raised with regard to the proposed maximum overfill and how the amount dispensed 
corresponds to the actual dose stated in the SmPC. This was addressed by provision of further 
clarification regarding the manufacturing process and materials,  by additional user studies and by 
tightening the relevant IPC limits.  Based on the additional provided data the MO has been resolved 
and the revised overfill range is justified. The FP is considered as a specialised pharmaceutical dosage 
form because of the low AS content (lower than 2% per unit). Therefore, an MO was raised requesting 
validation data from three full production scale batches as per the Guideline on Process Validation for 
Finished Products. The MO has been resolved since the requested data were provided in line with 
validation protocol initially presented in R.3.2. The critical process parameters  for all critical equipment 
and non-critical equipment were documented and met expectations during bulk formulation and 
manufacture of the finished product. The whole manufacturing process is considered adequately 
validated.

Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include tests and limits for appearance 
(visual), identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC, UPLC), apparent viscosity (Ph. 
Eur.), and microbial  limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The product specification covers appropriate  parameters  for this dosage form as per the Ph. Eur. 
monograph for pharmaceutical form “Semi-solid preparations  for cutaneous application”. The 
acceptance criteria have been set based on requirements of relevant quality guidelines, Ph. Eur. and 
available results. Specification limits for viscosity were justified based on results from several batches 
at release and on stability. Overall, the risk of microbial  contamination of tirbanibulin 1% ointment is 
determined as low.  Nevertheless, microbiological quality of the finished product is controlled at release 
and at shelf life. The microbiological  acceptance criteria were set based on Ph. Eur. 5.1.4 
“Microbiological quality of non-sterile pharmaceutical and substances for pharmaceutical use” according 
to the standard acceptance criteria as specified for a cutaneous route of administration. 
A satisfactory risk assessment summary on elemental impurities (EI) in accordance with the ICH Q3D 
guideline was provided. Since ICH Q3D does not provide a permitted daily exposure (PDE) for the 
cutaneous route, PDE limits for finished product (tirbanibulin 1% ointment) are based on the values set 
in ICH Q3D for parenteral routes of administration. The Acceptable Daily Exposure (ADE) limits are set 
to 30% of that value in accordance with ICH Q3D. Batch analysis data on 3 batches using a validated 
ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected 
above 30% of the respective ADE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can 
be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product 
specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
An MO was raised concerning the potential risk of the presence of nitrosamine impurities  in the finished 
product. In response to the MO, a risk evaluation was conducted and submitted considering all 
suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Taking into account the presented information and 
considering the topical use, duration of treatment and risk associated to the formula components 
(negligible or very low) the safety risk associated to the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the FP is 
negligible and thus there is no risk for the patients. Based on the information provided, no additional 
control measures are deemed necessary; the MO has been resolved.  
A justification for not including a test for residual solvents in the specification was provided in line with 
ICH Q3C(R7) “Guideline for Residual Solvents” and Ph. Eur. 5.4 “Residual Solvents,” taking into 
account the recommended maximum  allowed limits. The maximum  daily dose of tirbanibulin is well 
below 10 g (2.5 mg), and the AS and all excipients in the FP meet the limits given in Option 1 of Ph. 
Eur. 5.4 and ICH Q3C(R7). Based on this assessment, it is accepted that a test for residual solvents is 
not included in the FP specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately  validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. The analytical method for viscosity has changed in the course of 
development. The old method was used for release and stability of clinical batches. The new method is 
used for stability studies. An MO was raised requesting bridging data for the two methods in order to 
demonstrate that the proposed specifications for viscosity are representative of the clinical batches. 
Satisfactory bridging data were presented. In addition, the presented results are supportive of the 
proposed respective specifications. While differences are seen between the clinical and registration

batches, these are not considered significant and this is supported by IVRT  results. The MO has been 
resolved. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has 
been presented.   
The finished product is released onto the market based on the release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Batch analysis data have been provided on batches manufactured by the proposed manufacturer. 
Results from five smaller scale development batches used in various phases of the clinical trials and 
manufactured by the development sites were also presented. All the test results remain within the 
proposed specification limits demonstrating consistent product quality.  
Stability  of the product 
Stability data from four commercial scale batches, stored for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (25±2°C / 60±5% RH),  for up to 18 months at 5°C/ ambient RH,  and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40±2ºC / 75±5% RH), according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. 
Data from one of the above batches stored for 12 months at 30±2°C / 75±5% RH was also presented. 
These primary  stability batches were manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site and were 
packaged in the proposed commercial  container closure system.  
Stability samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurities, microscopy,  IVRT,  viscosity, seal 
integrity, and on a yearly basis, microbial  limits.  Appearance met the specification for all batches 
except at 5°C where the product was found to have a gritty consistency at the 6-month timepoint due 
to precipitation of the AS.  There was no observed trend in viscosity, assay or impurities.  All batches 
met all the other acceptance criteria across all stability storage conditions and timepoints.  
Forced degradation studies showed that the FP is most susceptible to oxidation and heat, with modest 
degradation upon exposure to light (as confirmed in the photostability study described above). A 
known impurity  was only detected under basic conditions. The stability-indicating character of the 
analytical methods has been demonstrated. 
A  thermal  cycling  study  was  conducted during  which  FP  in  the  proposed  commercial  primary  and 
secondary packaging was exposed to low  and high temperature  extremes.  The study was designed to 
represent  worst-case  temperature  stress  by  exposing product  to  both  temperature  extremes  in  each 
cycle. Results from  the thermal cycling study indicate that temperature excursions encountered during 
storage or distribution are unlikely to have an impact on product quality.  
Based on the overall submitted stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years with the storage condition 
“do not refrigerate and freeze”, as stated in SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4, is acceptable. 
Adventitious  agents 
No  materials  of  human  or  animal  origin  are  used  in  the  manufacture of  Klisyri.  TSE  statements  for 
propylene glycol and glycerol monostearate 40-55 from the respective suppliers were provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical  and biological  aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and the finished has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.

MOs raised regarding the QP declaration, the manufacturing authorisation and GMP certification of 
certain proposed sites in the supply chain have been addressed by provision of updated valid 
compliance documentation. The MO on the potential presence of nitrosamines in the finished product 
was resolved by performing a risk assessment in line with the requirements of the relevant published 
guidance documents. The MOs on the finished product manufacturing process were resolved by 
providing satisfactory process validation data and results from a sachet filling. Satisfactory bridging 
data was also provided to resolve the MO regarding the change of the viscosity method and the 
respective FP specification. The overall control strategy for the AS and the FP is adequately justified 
and is acceptable.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions  on the chemical, pharmaceutical  and biological  aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and 
biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations  for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical  aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In the non-clinical programme,  data on the anti-proliferative activity and mechanism of action of 
tirbanibulin were submitted based on the applicant’s own studies and on published studies. The 
applicant also submitted studies to identify possible secondary pharmacological effects and potential 
side effects. Pharmacokinetic data were submitted for single oral doses of tirbanibulin in mice and rats 
and single and multiple oral doses in rats and dogs, and for single intravenous doses in mice, rats, and 
dogs. Data for the dermal absorption of tirbanibulin were submitted for rats, rabbits,  and minipigs. 
Further data submitted include the results of a single study of the dose-mass balance, metabolism,  and 
tissue distribution of [3H]tirbanibulin in rats, and results of in vitro metabolic studies in biomaterial 
from rat, dog, minipig, and human. The general toxicology programme  for tirbanibulin consisted of 
dermal and oral studies in the mouse, rat, rabbit,  minipig, and dog, including single and repeat dose, 
genetic, developmental and reproductive, and local tolerability toxicity studies. All pivotal Toxicology 
studies are claimed to be conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations by 
the applicant. Two of the genotoxicity studies (Mouse lymphoma  TK gene mutation assay [Study 7709-
113]; Bone marrow  micronucleus test in rat [Study 321-0044-GT]) and three of the reproductive 
toxicity studies (Study 321-0034-TX in rat and Studies 321-0047-TX and 321-0049-TX in rats and 
rabbits) were conducted at a site located in China, which is neither an OECD nor OECD-MAD member. 
As China does not adhere to the OECD MAD agreement, the Chinese GLP monitoring authority has not 
been assessed by its OECD peer. Thus, one condition of the GLP regulations is not fulfilled (see 
Discussion section). The aforementioned studies did not show any irregularities or signs of GLP non-
compliance and based on inspections from an EU GLP monitoring authority there is evidence that this 
facility conducts studies in compliance with the OECD GLP regulations.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
In the non-clinical programme,  primary  pharmacodynamics data on the anti-proliferative activity and 
mechanism of action of tirbanibulin were obtained from the applicant’s own studies and from published 
studies. 
Primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  
In vitro 
Study ATNXUS-KX01-001: Mechanism of Action and Anti-proliferative Activity In Vitro 
This in vitro study investigated the mechanism of action of tirbanibulin (KX2-391) and its anti-
proliferative activity in cell lines including keratinocytes. 
Tubulin was identified as a specific drug target for tirbanibulin in various assays within this study using 
HT-29, PC-12, HUVEC, PC3-LN4, CCD-1106 KERTr and human peripheral  blood mononuclear cells: 
•  α- and β-tubulins were identified as binders of tirbanibulin through LC-MS/MS; they were the 
most strongly labelled proteins when photoaffinity labelled proteins in colon cancer HT-29 cells 
were resolved by 2D gel analysis. 
• 
Tubulin was observed to be specific binding target for tirbanibulin in photoaffinity labelling 
assays with purified tubulin and competitive binding assays with other tubulin binders. 
•  Dose-dependent inhibition of tubulin polymerisation in vitro was observed with tirbanibulin. 
• 
In immunofluorescence assays tirbanibulin was observed to effectively disrupts the microtubule 
network in vitro in prostate cancer PC3 cells, human PBMCs, and immortalised  keratinocyte 
CCD-1106 KERTr cells 
Tirbanibulin resulted in a G2/M arrest in CCD-1106 KERTr cells, using flow cytometry (Figure 2). An 
increase in apoptotic cells, as indicated by annexin V and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) staining, 
was observed in metastatic prostate PC3-LN4 cells and later in CCD-1106 KERTr keratinocytes. The 
collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, a characteristic event of early-stage apoptosis,  was 
also observed in tirbanibulin-treated PC3-LN4 cells. Tirbanibulin treatment led to hyper-
phosphorylation of Bcl-2, caspase 8 and 9 cleavage, activation of caspase 3, and subsequent poly 
(ADP-ribose) polymerase  inhibitor (PARP) cleavage, as shown by immunoblot analysis.

Figure 2: Tirbanibulin disrupts microtubule architecture and arrests cells at the G2/M stage 
of the cell cycle (Study ATNXUS-KX01-001) 
Given that tirbanibulin was thought to halt cell division at the phase of mitosis via inhibition of tubulin 
polymerisation,  it was expected that fast-growing cells are more susceptible to tirbanibulin-induced 
growth inhibition than slowly growing cells. To test this hypothesis, slowly growing CCD-1106 KERTr 
keratinocytes were established by maintaining them in growth factor-reduced media. Following 
incubation with various concentrations of tirbanibulin, a significantly reduced growth rate was observed 
when cells were maintained in growth factor-reduced media for 72 h compared with cells in regular 
culture media, using analysis by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) 
assay (Figure 3). When cell growth inhibition and viability were compared between the 2 cell cultures 
with different growth rates after 72 h of tirbanibulin treatment, tirbanibulin was more effective in 
inhibiting cell growth and inducing cell death in the fast-growing cells compared to the slow-growing 
cells (GI50: 11 vs. 27 nM, p<0.0001, Student’s t-test).

Study ATH001-01-p-00001: Bioactivity Comparison of Tirbanibulin and its Metabolites 
Tirbanibulin has shown a potent anti-proliferative effect in the low nM range in a human keratinocyte 
cell line (CCD-1106 KERTr) and on a variety of tumour cell lines. None of the identified metabolites of 
tirbanibulin have significant in vitro anti-proliferative activity on CCD-1106 KERTr cells, including the 
major  metabolite in human hepatocyte incubates, KX2-5036, which had no detectable activity at up to 
20 µM. 
Disruption of mitosis and Src signaling in breast cancer cell lines (Kim et al; 2007) 
Nine breast cancer cell lines were treated with tirbanibulin in vitro and inhibitory effects were evaluated 
using an MTT assay. The luminal oestrogen receptor (ER)+ cell lines MCF7 and T47D, the HER2+ cell 
line SK-BR-3, and the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and 
BT-549 were sensitive to tirbanibulin with concentration of an inhibitor where the response (or binding) 
was reduced by 50% (IC50) (synonymous with GI50 in the context of this publication) values <100 
nmol/L, whereas TNBC cell lines Hs578T and HCC1937 could not be completely inhibited by 
tirbanibulin.

To determine if tirbanibulin inhibited the activity of Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Western 
blotting was performed to measure the concentrations of total and phosphorylated proteins after 
treatment. Phosphorylated Src (p-Src) in BT-549 cells significantly decreased following exposure to 
tirbanibulin. FAK and p130cas phosphorylation, which are known to be regulated by Src, also 
decreased. Furthermore, additional downstream signalling molecular-level changes associated with cell 
survival and proliferation (p-AKT, p-ERK, and p-STAT3) decreased in sensitive cell lines following 24 h 
of tirbanibulin treatment. 
Src inhibitors are known to cause arrest of cell cycle phase G1 (Fabarius, 2008). Following tirbanibulin 
treatment, an arrest in G2/M cell cycle phase was observed. TNBC cells sensitive to tirbanibulin (BT-
549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468) displayed a 2- to 4-fold increase in the G2/M cell phase 
population, while G1 and S cell phases decreased. Conversely, the tirbanibulin-insensitive cell line 
(Hs578T) did not show increased G2/M cell phase population in response to up to 100 nM 
concentration of tirbanibulin. In addition, tirbanibulin treatment resulted in an increase in the number 
of multi-nucleated cells in MDA-MB-231 cells, which was presumably the result of microtubule 
polymerisation inhibition. 
Disruption of Microtubule Network in Mucinous Ovarian Carcinoma Cells (Liu et al, 2013) 
In vitro assays were performed to determine if tirbanibulin could directly affect the organisation of the 
microtubule network in RMUG-S and RMUG-L cells. RMUG-S and RMUG-L cells were treated with 
tirbanibulin for 24 or 48 h. These cells were then fixed and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate 
(FITC)-conjugated anti-α/β tubulin antibodies and Hoechst 33342 or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 
(DAPI) to observe the microtubule network and nuclei with fluorescence microscopy.  Cells treated with 
tirbanibulin had a smaller microtubule network with a diffuse stain visible in the cytoplasm when 
compared with the vehicle control. Compared with RMUG-L cells, microtubules in RMUG-S cells were 
affected to a greater extent after treatment with tirbanibulin. 
In vivo 
In vivo data obtained from non-cutaneous mouse xenograft tumour models treated with oral 
tirbanibulin were provided (table below). In human breast, ovarian, and prostate tumour xenograft 
models treated with oral tirbanibulin for up to 30 days, a dose-dependent inhibition of tumour growth 
was observed, without significant adverse clinically relevant signs. In sections of these different 
tirbanibulin-treated xenograft tumours, alterations of the microtubule architecture were detected as a

Secondary pharmacodynamic  studies 
To assess potential secondary pharmacodynamics of tirbanibulin a study evaluated the inhibitory effect 
of tirbanibulin on 63 molecular targets from a diverse range of therapeutic targets (Study 06-3061). 
These targets include receptors for neurotransmitters, steroids, second messengers, prostaglandins, 
growth factors, hormones, brain and GI peptides, as well as ion channels and enzymes. The inhibitory 
effect of tirbanibulin was tested at 1.0 μM. None of the targets was inhibited >50% by tirbanibulin, 
which is considered the threshold for follow-up evaluation. The risk of tirbanibulin having a clinically 
relevant interaction with any of the molecular targets tested in this study is low, given the maximum 
observed tirbanibulin plasma concentration of 1.09 ng/L (2.53 nM) observed in the maximal  usage 
clinical trial (MUsT) (Study KX01-AK-007). 
The kinase binding activity of tirbanibulin and the most abundant metabolite  identified in human 
hepatocyte incubates, KX2-5036 was assessed using a KINOMEscan screening platform to 
quantitatively measure the interactions of tirbanibulin and KX2-5036 with more than 450 human 
kinases and disease-relevant mutant variants (Study ATH002-01-p-00001). In contrast to ponatinib, a 
multi-target kinase inhibitor used as a control, no competition activity >65% was observed for 
tirbanibulin at 5 μM, demonstrating that tirbanibulin did not inhibit the binding of the evaluated kinases 
to their substrates (bait ligands) under conditions of the study. Further, tirbanibulin did not bind to 
kinases in the Src kinase family.

Safety pharmacology  programme 
In vitro 
hERG assay 
In a non-GLP assay in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the hERG channel (Study 5152016) the IC50 for 
tirbanibulin for the hERG channel was 44 μM (18987 ng/mL). A subsequent GLP compliant study was 
completed in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the hERG channel (Study YY91QH). Tirbanibulin inhibited 
hERG tail current in a concentration-dependent manner. A concentration-response curve was 
determined using vehicle-corrected data plotted against the achieved concentrations. The IC50 value 
was 24.67 μM (10600 ng/mL). Terfenadine, a known inhibitor of the hERG channel, was used as a 
positive control at a submaximally effective concentration (50 nM). 
Table 3: Measured tirbanibulin concentrations in hERG assay 
KX2-5036, the major  metabolite of tirbanibulin (KX2-391) in human hepatocyte incubates was also 
investigated in the hERG assay at a nominal concentration of 30 μM (the limit of solubility) and 
included the use of terfenadine as a positive control in a GLP compliant study (Study XV31HF). Analysis 
of the concentration of KX2-5036 attained in the perfusion apparatus showed that substance losses 
were between 0.0% and 0.3%. KX2-5036 had no significant effect (p=0.5328, unpaired Student’s t-
test) on hERG tail current when compared with vehicle-treated cells. Following time-matched vehicle 
correction, hERG tail current amplitude was 96.0±4.7% of baseline in the presence of KX2-5036 at a 
maximum  achieved concentration of 30 μM. 
In vivo 
CNS 
A non-GLP compliant study evaluated the potential of tirbanibulin to cause behavioural, neurological, or 
autonomic effects in vivo, using a Modified Irwin Screen in male Wistar rats at a single dose of 50 
mg/kg via oral gavage (Study 509600-1024091). The animals were also observed for tirbanibulin- or 
vehicle-induced mortality during an 8-day observation period post-dose. Tirbanibulin scored zero (no 
effect) in all 32 observations in all 5 rats. A similar result was obtained for vehicle. 
Cardiovascular and Respiratory 
A GLP-compliant study evaluated potential pharmacologic effects that may have clinical relevance of 
intravenous (IV) doses of tirbanibulin on haemodynamic, respiratory,  blood gas, and 
electrocardiographic parameters in conscious, telemetered Beagle dogs (Study QRV00015). All animals 
were treated via IV administration with 0 (vehicle control), 7.5, and 15 mg/kg of tirbanibulin in a 
cross-over design. The animals received vehicle on Day 1. Tirbanibulin was administered at 7.5 and 15 
mg/kg on Days 4 and 11, respectively. The same 4 animals were dosed in each dose session. The time 
between sessions was extended after Day 4 to allow for an additional washout period between the test 
article doses.

IV administration of tirbanibulin to Beagle dogs at doses up to 15 mg/kg had no adverse effects on 
ECG waveforms, ECG intervals (PR, QRS, QT, or QTc), pH, pO2, SO2, or pCO2. There were dose-
dependent changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory  rate. There was a moderate increase 
in blood pressure with a greater effect observed in diastolic pressure than systolic and mean pressures. 
These effects were observed after 7.5 and 15 mg/kg doses. Blood pressure increases were at a similar 
degree with these 2 doses but more prolonged at the higher dose. There was a moderate but transient 
increase in heart rate that began after the end of the infusion and returned to control levels by 
approximately  30 min after dosing in animals receiving 7.5 and 15 mg/kg of tirbanibulin. Heart rate 
was also elevated for approximately  8 to 12 or 20 h in animals receiving 7.5 and 15 mg/kg, 
respectively. In animals receiving 15 mg/kg tirbanibulin, a mild increase in respiratory  rate beginning 
at the end of the infusion and lasting 120 min was observed, whereas a slight reduction was found 20 
to 22 h after dosing.  
Gastrointestinal system 
A non-GLP compliant study evaluated the potential effects of both oral gavage and subcutaneous 
injection of tirbanibulin (KX01) on the propulsive motility in normal male and female Wistar rats (Study 
21050). Groups receiving tirbanibulin orally were dosed at 2.5 or 10 mg/kg. Dasatinib was 
administered orally at 50 mg/kg. Animals treated subcutaneously were dosed with either 7.5, 15, or 30 
mg/kg tirbanibulin or with 30 mg/kg dasatinib. Thirty minutes after single administration of 
tirbanibulin, vehicle, or dasatinib, 10 mL/kg of a 5% suspension of non-activated charcoal powder 
suspended in a 1% CMC solution in distilled water was administered to the rats via oral gavage. 
Tirbanibulin produced a small but statistically significant increase in mean (±standard error of the 
mean) intestinal transit time vs. the vehicle control following oral dosing at 5 and 10 mg/kg 
(82.9±1.4% and 83.1±1.7% vs. 76.0±1.8%) and subcutaneous dosing at 7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg 
(75.0±1.9%, 76.9±1.2%, and 80.0±1.2% vs. 69.5±1.2%). Dasatinib at 50 mg/kg administered orally 
produced an increase in transit which was not significantly different from control due to the high 
variability of the response (81.7±5.9% vs. 76.0±1.8%). 
A non-GLP compliant study evaluated the potential effects of tirbanibulin (KX01) on the propulsive 
motility (gastric emptying) in normal male and female Wistar rats (Study 21051). Groups receiving 
tirbanibulin orally were administered 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg. Dasatinib was administered orally at 50 
mg/kg. Animals treated subcutaneously were dosed with either 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg of tirbanibulin or 
with 30 mg/kg dasatinib. Thirty minutes after administration of either drug or vehicle, 10 glass beads 
(size: 1 mm)  were administered by oral gavage. After 60 min, the rats were euthanised and the 
stomach was removed. The number of beads remaining in the stomach was counted. Tirbanibulin did 
not produce any significant inhibition of gastric emptying of 1 mm glass beads when administered 
either orally or subcutaneously. There were no signs of gastric bloating or fluid in the stomach and 
intestines. There was no indication of gastric mucosal damage following administration of tirbanibulin. 
Dasatinib at 50 mg/kg orally produced a small but statistically significant inhibition of gastric emptying 
(93±3.0% vs. 99±1.0%), and on necropsy, the stomach and intestines appeared to be full of fluid. 
Pharmacodynamic  drug interactions 
No studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism,  excretion and toxicity of tirbanibulin were initially 
investigated to support oral clinical studies in oncology indications. Therefore, the PK of tirbanibulin 
has been assessed in oral single (mice, rats, and dogs) and repeat (rats and dogs) dose studies and

following single dose IV administration (mice, rats, and dogs). The absorption of tirbanibulin following 
dermal application has been assessed in rats (repeat dose), rabbits (repeat dose), and minipigs (single 
and repeat dose). A single dose mass balance, metabolism,  and tissue distribution study with 
[3H]tirbanibulin was conducted in rats. In vitro metabolism  studies in rat, dog, minipig (Göttingen and 
Bama), and human biomaterials  have also been submitted. 
2.3.3.1.  Methods of analysis 
In PK and toxicity studies, tirbanibulin concentrations in rat, rabbit,  dog, and minipig plasma were 
measured using validated liquid chromatographic (LC) tandem mass spectrometric (MS) (LC-MS/MS) 
methods. Methods were also developed for the quantitation of the tirbanibulin metabolites KX2-5036 
and KX2-5163 in rat and minipig plasma.  The methods used for analysis were partially or fully 
validated across each calibration range.  
Determination of the radioactivity in in vivo biological samples following administration of 
[3H]tirbanibulin was carried out by HPLC-ARCTM.  Plasma samples with very low radioactivity were 
subjected to high performance LC separation, fraction collection, and detected by solid scintillation 
counting. Metabolite characterisation was accomplished by either LC-MS/MS, LC high resolution MS, or 
LC-MS, coupled with an appropriate  radioactivity monitor,  when applicable. 
2.3.3.2.  Absorption  
Single dose studies 
The PK parameters for tirbanibulin after a single dose administration are summarised in the table 
below. Study 7709-118 compared the PK of tirbanibulin (KX2-391) following single oral doses of 2 
tirbanibulin salt forms (2HCl and mesylate), at the same free base equivalent to male (5 mg/kg) and 
female (2 mg/kg) Sprague-Dawley rats (4 males and 4 females per salt form). Study 7709-117 
compared the PK of tirbanibulin (KX2-391) following single oral doses of 2 tirbanibulin salt forms (2HCl 
and mesylate), at the same free base equivalent (0.75 mg/kg) to male and female Beagle dogs (8 
males and 8 females), in a cross-over design with a 7-day washout between doses, 4 males and 4 
females received the 2HCl salt then mesylate salt while 4 other males and 4 other females first 
received the mesylate salt then 2HCl salt.

Repeat dose studies 
Tirbanibulin plasma concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS in repeat dose toxicology studies in 
Sprague-Dawley rats, NZW rabbits,  Beagle dogs, and Bama minipigs. Additionally, plasma 
concentrations of the tirbanibulin metabolites KX2-5036 and KX2-5163 were determined by LC-MS/MS 
in Sprague-Dawley rats and Bama minipigs in repeat dose toxicology studies. 
Rats 
In 5 repeat dose dermal studies (392-0051-TX, 392-0053-TX, 321-0032-TX, 78539 and 
PSA13080020), Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed dermally with tirbanibulin ointment at doses ranging 
from 2 to 40 mg/kg/day tirbanibulin (percentage of tirbanibulin in the ointment ranged from 0.1% to 
2%, respectively) for up to 28 days and, in the 3-month repeated dose study, with 4 cycles of 5 days 
of daily treatment with 23 days without treatment between cycles. Systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC 
from time 0 to 24 h [AUC0-24h]) to tirbanibulin increased with dose and was typically higher in females 
than males. In general, systemic exposure increased with repeat dosing up to 28 days but there was 
no accumulation after the 23-day treatment-free intervals of the 3-month repeat dose study. Plasma 
concentrations of 2 structurally confirmed metabolites of tirbanibulin were evaluated after up to 5 days 
of dermal treatment with tirbanibulin ointment (Study 392-0051-TX [KX2-5036] and Study 392-0053-
TX [KX2-5036 and KX2-5136]). For KX2-5036, systemic exposure increased with repeat dosing. No 
consistent sex difference in systemic exposure was observed. Metabolite to parent (KX2-
5036/tirbanibulin) ratios based on exposure (AUC0-24h) ranged from 0.029 to 0.12. For KX2-5163, 
females typically had higher systemic exposure than males. The systemic exposure of KX2-5163 
increased dose proportionally in both sexes on Day 1 but increased less than dose proportionally  in 
both sexes on Day 5. Metabolite to parent (KX2-5163/tirbanibulin) ratios based on exposure (AUC0-24h) 
ranged from 1.7 to 4.5. 
In two repeat dose oral studies (7709-100 and 7709-102), Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed orally 
with a gavage solution of tirbanibulin at doses ranging from 0.625 mg/kg/dose (female) and 1.25 
mg/kg/dose (male) to 5 mg/kg/dose 2 times a day for up to 28 days. For tirbanibulin, the systemic 
exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24h) generally increased with increasing oral doses, was roughly dose 
proportional,  and was higher in females than males. No increase in systemic exposure (≥2-fold) was 
observed after repeat oral dosing of tirbanibulin. 
NZ White Rabbits  (PSA13100016) 
Male NZW rabbits were dosed with tirbanibulin dermally b.i.d.  (4 h/time, with 4 h interval) for 8 days 
using patches. Dermal doses ranged from 0.21 to 2.07 mg/kg/dose. The tmax for dermal dosing 
occurred 1 to 4 h post-dose. The systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) to tirbanibulin increased with 
increasing doses and with repeat dosing of dermal tirbanibulin. 
Beagle Dogs

In 2 repeat dose oral studies in Beagle dogs (Study 7709-101 and Study 7709-103), animals were 
dosed orally with a gavage solution of tirbanibulin at doses ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/kg/dose 2 times 
a day for up to 28 days. The tirbanibulin tmax generally occurred within the first 2 h post-dose. 
Systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) to tirbanibulin generally increased with increasing doses (roughly 
dose proportional),  and similar in males and females. No increase in systemic exposure was observed 
after repeat dosing. 
Bama minipigs 
In 4 repeat dose dermal studies (44103-13-835, 392-0052-TX, 392-0054-TX and 321-0033-TX), Bama 
minipigs were dosed dermally with tirbanibulin ointment at doses ranging from 2 to 40 mg/kg/day 
tirbanibulin for up to 28 days. For tirbanibulin, tmax was mainly observed between 2 and 8 h post-
dose. Systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24h) to tirbanibulin increased with dose. The exposure was 
higher in females than in males; In general, systemic exposure increased with repeat dosing but there 
was no accumulation after the 23-day recovery periods in the 3-month repeat dose study. Metabolite 
to parent ratios (KX2-5036/tirbanibulin and KX2-5163/tirbanibulin) based on plasma concentration 
were observed between 0.080 and 0.16 and between 0.31 and 0.59, respectively. 
2.3.3.3.  Distribution 
In vitro 
The extent of in vitro protein binding of tirbanibulin to plasma proteins was determined at 
concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 μg/mL in rat,  rabbit, and dog plasma (pooled mixed sex) using 
equilibrium dialysis at 37°C for 4 h. Plasma protein binding of tirbanibulin over the range of 0.01 to 10 
μg/mL was concentration independent. The average protein binding of tirbanibulin to rat, rabbit,  and 
dog plasma was 92.3%, 94.0% and 81.9%, respectively (Study C18091). 
The extent of in vitro protein binding of tirbanibulin to plasma proteins was also determined at 
concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 μg/mL in human plasma (pooled mixed sex) and 0.07% human 
α-1 acid glycoprotein in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline using equilibrium dialysis at 37°C for 4 h. 
The percent bound fraction of tirbanibulin ranged between 87.6% and 89.0% in human plasma and 
between 37.3% and 69.3% in human α-1 acid glycoprotein over the concentration range of 0.01 to 10 
μg/mL. The plasma protein binding of tirbanibulin was concentration independent. The results showed 
that the binding of tirbanibulin to 0.07% human α-1 acid glycoprotein may reach saturation at 
concentrations >0.1 μg/mL (Study XBL17622). 
The binding of KX2-5036, the pyridine acetamide metabolite  of tirbanibulin, to the proteins in plasma 
from rats, rabbits,  dogs, and humans and to human α-1 acid glycoproteins was assessed using 
equilibrium dialysis (Study C18092). Plasma binding of KX2-5036 over the range of 0.01 to 10 μg/mL 
was concentration independent. The average protein binding of KX2-5036 to rat, rabbit,  dog, and 
human plasma and to human α-1 acid glycoproteins was 44.0%, 52.0%, 35.4%, 57.3%, and 3.9%, 
respectively. 
The binding of tirbanibulin and KX2-5036, the pyridine acetamide metabolite of tirbanibulin, to plasma 
proteins in Bama minipig was assessed using equilibrium dialysis (Study 412036-2019052701-PPB). 
Binding of tirbanibulin and KX2-5036 to Bama minipig plasma was concentration independent over the 
range of 0.01 to 10 μg/mL (between 84.4% and 86.5% for tirbanibulin and between >34.3% to 48.1% 
for KX2-5036.

A mass balance study which investigated tissue distribution was conducted with [3H]tirbanibulin 
([3H]KX2-391) in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, following a single oral administration. Fifteen 
male and 15 female rats received a single oral dose of [3H]tirbanibulin (5 mg/kg free base; 200 
μCi/kg) in purified water.  Blood was collected at 15 and 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h post-
dose to measure blood and plasma concentrations of radioactivity and to determine PK parameters of 
total radioactivity. The peak concentration of the total radioactivity was found at 1 h post-dose for all 
organs, except for GI contents, for which the peak concentration was observed at 4 h post-dose. 
Within 72 h post-dose, the decrease of the radioactivity in all organs was in accordance with that in 
plasma.  At all sampling times, liver, stomach, and intestines were the main tissues that contained 
higher radioactivity concentrations compared to plasma. Other organs containing higher radioactivity 
concentrations than plasma at some sampling times were adrenals, kidneys, and thyroids. Brain and 
bone had the lowest content of radioactivity. The radioactivity concentration in all tissues decreased 
significantly at 24 and 72 h. The radioactivity was detectable up to 72 h post-dose in the blood and 
plasma of intact male and female rats. The mean whole blood to plasma ratios ranged from 0.52 to 
1.08, suggesting no significant binding to cellular components. No significant sex differences were 
observed for tissue distribution or PK parameters. 
2.3.3.4.  Metabolism 
In vitro 
The metabolism  of tirbanibulin at a concentration of 1 μM was evaluated in the presence and absence 
of selective chemical inhibitors of 8 major  CYP isozymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, 2B6, 
and 2E1). CYP isoforms responsible for tirbanibulin metabolism were confirmed by incubating 
tirbanibulin with individual recombinant human CYP enzymes (rCYP). Eight major  CYP isozymes 
(rCYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, 2B6, and 2E1) were evaluated for their role in the metabolism of 
tirbanibulin. Tirbanibulin (1 μM) was incubated with individual rCYP isozymes (50 pmol/mL)  for 30 min. 
The CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole inhibited the metabolism  of tirbanibulin 48.4% at a concentration of 
5 μM. In addition, the recombinant human CYP3A4 system efficiently metabolised tirbanibulin 85.2% 
under the conditions of this study. The CYP2C8 inhibitor, quercetin, inhibited the metabolism of 
tirbanibulin 42.2% at a concentration of 20 μM. Recombinant human CYP2C8 did catalyse the 
metabolism  of tirbanibulin but only 13.9% under the condition of this study. Metabolism by the CYP 
isoforms 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1 was not observed in the chemical inhibitor or respective 
rCYP incubations (Study XBL08671). 
Incubation with rat, dog, and human hepatocytes resulted in significant metabolism of tirbanibulin. 
Turnover was most extensive in rat hepatocytes with less than 10% of tirbanibulin remaining following 
incubation at 1 μM for 2 h. Turnover was also extensive, albeit significantly slower, in dog and human 
hepatocytes, with the extent of metabolism  in the range of 50% following a 2 h incubation at 1 μM. 
Fourteen metabolites were characterised from the incubations in the hepatocytes of the 3 species. 
Human hepatocytes produced 5 metabolites,  all of which were observed in either rat or dog 
hepatocytes and in either dog plasma  or urine. No metabolites were found to be unique to human 
hepatocytes. Four of the metabolites were observed in rat plasma,  all of which were also produced by 
rat hepatocytes, in addition to another 2 metabolites. Dog hepatocytes produced 6 metabolites, all of 
which and more were observed in dog plasma, dog urine, or both.

Tirbanibulin, at 1 and 10 μM, were extensively metabolised in minipig hepatocytes with 19.8% and 
21.3% of tirbanibulin remaining after the 2 h incubation, respectively. In addition to unchanged 
tirbanibulin, 11 metabolites were tentatively identified by LC-HR-MS in minipig hepatocyte incubations 
(Study XBL18507). 
In vivo 
After a single oral dose of [3H]tirbanibulin, unchanged drug and 18 metabolites,  designated M1 to M18, 
were characterised in rat plasma,  bile, urine, and faeces. M1 is an amide moiety hydrolysis product of 
M11. M2 and M3 identified in this study were confirmed as KX2-5036 and KX2-5163, respectively. M2 
is a pyridine acetamide metabolite of tirbanibulin and M3 is a pyridine acetic acid metabolite of 
tirbanibulin or KX2-5036. Unchanged [3H]tirbanibulin accounted for 4.19% and 7.49% of the total 
radioactivity in 0 to 24 h male and female rat plasma, respectively. Metabolites KX2-5036 and KX2-
5163 (co-eluted in radioprofiles) were the major  circulating metabolites, together accounting for 
93.9% and 80.2% of the total radioactivity in male and female rat plasma,  respectively. Three minor 
circulating metabolites, M16, M17, and M18, were also observed, accounting for 0.19%, 0.46%, and 
0.45% for males, and 2.20%, 0.95%, and 6.61% for females, respectively (Study XBLC11643N).

2.3.3.5.  Excretion 
Study XBLC11639N investigated mass balance, PK, metabolism,  and tissue distribution of 
[3H]tirbanibulin ([3H]KX2-391) in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, following a single oral 
administration. Three male and 3 female intact rats and 3 male and 3 female BDC rats were orally 
dosed with 5 mg/kg free base equivalent (200 μCi/kg) and housed individually in metabolism  cages 
equipped for the separate collection of bile, urine, faeces, and cage rinse. 
For intact animals, urine was collected at 0 to 6, 6 to 12, 12 to 24, 24 to 48, 48 to 72, 72 to 96, 96 to 
120, 120 to 144, and 144 to 168 h post-dose. Faeces were collected at 0 to 24, 24 to 48, 48 to 72, 72 
to 96, 96 to 120, 120 to 144, and 144 to 168 h post-dose. For BDC rats, bile (collected from bile duct-
cannula) and urine were collected pre-dose and at 0 to 8, 8 to 24, 24 to 48, and 48 to 72 h post-dose. 
Faeces were collected at 0 to 24, 24 to 48, and 48 to 72 h post-dose. 
In rats, faeces was the major route of excretion (61% to 71% of total radioactivity), mainly via biliary 
excretion (>80% of faecal radioactivity); 13% to 27% was excreted in urine. The majority of 
radioactivity was excreted within 24 h post-dose.

CYP inhibition 
Study C18087 evaluated the inhibition potential of tirbanibulin (KX2-391) and KX2-5036, the pyridine 
acetamide metabolite of tirbanibulin, for the enzymatic activities of human CYP isozymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 
2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5 using pooled, mixed sex (n=150) HLM. Both direct and time-
dependent inhibition (TDI) of tirbanibulin and KX2-5036 on CYP were evaluated. The direct inhibitory

potentials of tirbanibulin (0.09 to 90 μM) and KX2-5036 (0.1 to 100 μM) were tested separately in vitro 
in HLM (0.1 mg/mL), using CYP-specific marker substrate reactions. 
For tirbanibulin, no/limited direct and TDI effects were observed on CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 2D6 under 
these experimental conditions. Tirbanibulin showed >50% direct inhibitory effects on 3 CYP-mediated 
reactions, CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4/5-mediated testosterone 6β-hydroxylation, with apparent direct 
IC50 values ranging from 35.2 to 73.5 μM. After a 30 min pre-incubation, the inhibitory effect of 
tirbanibulin increased on CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4/5 (both reactions) and IC50 shifted from 1.5- to 2-
fold.  
Table 8: Summary of direct and time-dependent inhibition of CYP isozymes by tirbanibulin 
(Study C18087) 
To establish if the TDI effect on CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4/5 that was seen in the initial experiments 
described above was irreversible,  an additional set of experiments was conducted. A dilution method 
was used to determine the CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4/5 inhibition reversibility  of tirbanibulin. Tirbanibulin 
over concentration ranges of 6.25 to 200 μM for CYP2C9, 3.44 to 110 μM for CYP2C19, 6.25 to 200 μM 
for CYP3A4/5-mediated midazolam 1’-hydroxylation, and 1.15 to 100 μM for CYP3A4/5-mediated 
testosterone 6β-hydroxylation, was incubated with HLM in the presence and absence of NADPH for 30 
min. After the inactivation incubation, the HLM mixture was diluted 10-fold to buffer systems 
containing CYP-specific marker  substrates at saturated concentrations, and the remaining CYP 
activities were monitored.  
No/limited inhibitory effects of tirbanibulin on CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4/5 were observed after pre-
incubating with HLM in the absence or presence of NADPH. However,  tirbanibulin showed inhibitory 
effects on CYP3A4/5 after pre-incubating with HLM in the presence of NADPH after dilution. At the 
highest testing concentrations, the activity loss for CYP3A4/5-mediated midazolam 1’-hydroxylation 
and testosterone 6β-hydroxylation activities were 59.3% and 39.1%, respectively (table below).

The MBI kinetics parameters of tirbanibulin on CYP3A4/5 for testosterone and midazolam were 
evaluated. Tirbanibulin at a concentration range of 6.25 to 200 μM was incubated with HLM in the 
presence of NADPH for 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min. After the inactivation incubation, the HLM 
mixture was diluted 10-fold to buffer systems containing individual CYP3A4/5 marker substrates and 
the remaining CYP3A4/5 activities were monitored. The experimental MBI characterisation assay 
results are presented in the table below.

For KX2-5036, no/limited direct and TDI effects were observed on CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 
and 3A4/5 (both reactions) under experimental conditions. At 100 μM, remaining enzyme activity 
ranged from 91.6% to 107.5%. 
CYP induction 
Study XBL17621 evaluated the potential of tirbanibulin (KX2-391) to induce human CYP isozymes 
CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 in vitro using cryopreserved plateable human hepatocytes from 3 individual 
donors. Under experimental conditions, >70% of hepatocytes were viable after 3-day treatment with 
tirbanibulin at 0.0003 to 1 μM. Tirbanibulin at 3 μM reduced the hepatocyte viability by approximately 
45% relative to vehicle control. Therefore, the maximum concentration of tirbanibulin used in this 
study was 1 μM. CYP induction potential of tirbanibulin was evaluated by incubating the test article at 
0.01, 0.1, and 1 μM with plated human hepatocytes from 3 individual donors. Tirbanibulin at 
concentrations of up to 1 μM showed no induction potential for the mRNA  expression levels of CYP1A2, 
2B6, and 3A4 in hepatocytes from 3 donors (table below).  Respective positive controls under the same 
conditions showed significant induction relative to untreated hepatocytes. CYP 1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 
expression levels were not affected by the treatment of the negative control, flumazenil.

Study C18089 evaluated the potential of KX2-5036, the pyridine acetamide metabolite of tirbanibulin, 
to induce human CYP isozymes CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 in vitro using cryopreserved plateable human 
hepatocytes from 4 individual donors. CYP induction potential of KX2-5036 was evaluated by 
incubating the test article at 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 μM with plated human hepatocytes from 4 
individual donors. Under experimental conditions, >95.6% of hepatocytes were viable after 3-day 
treatment with KX2-5036 at up to 3 μM. Therefore, the maximum  concentration of KX2-5036 used in 
this study was 3 μM. KX2-5036 at concentrations of up to 3 μM showed no induction potential for the 
mRNA  expression levels of CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 in hepatocytes from 4 donors. Respective positive 
controls under the same conditions showed significant induction relative to untreated hepatocytes. 
CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 expression levels were not affected by the treatment of the negative control, 
flumazenil. 
Uptake and Efflux Transporter Inhibition and Substrate Assays 
The ATP-dependent transport of tirbanibulin by MDR1, BCRP, BSEP, and MRP2 was evaluated in 
membrane  vesicular assays. The transporter-specific ATP-dependent accumulation of tirbanibulin was 
<2-fold at all tested concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 μM), indicating that tirbanibulin is not a 
substrate for MDR1, BCRP, BSEP, or MRP2. 
The inhibition potential of tirbanibulin on the transport activity of human MDR1, BCRP, BSEP, and MRP2 
was tested in inside-out membrane vesicles. No significant inhibitions (<25%) with substrates by 
tirbanibulin at concentrations of up to 10 μM (4315 ng/mL), indicating that tirbanibulin is not an 
inhibitor for MDR1, BCRP, BSEP, or MRP2. 
The inhibitory potential of tirbanibulin on the transport activities of MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, and OCT2 was evaluated in cellular uptake inhibition assays. Under 
experimental conditions, <50% inhibition by tirbanibulin up to 100 μM was observed for OAT1 and 
OAT3. At 100 μM tirbanibulin, >50% inhibition was observed for MATE2-K, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. At 
10 and 100 μM tirbanibulin, >50% inhibition was observed for MATE1, OCT1, and OCT2. 
The follow-up inhibition assays were performed in the presence of 7 concentrations of tirbanibulin to 
obtain IC50 values for MATE1, MATE2-K, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, and OCT2. The estimated IC50 
values ranged from 1.4 to 66.4 μM (604 to 28650 ng/mL), suggesting that tirbanibulin is an inhibitor 
for MATE1, MATE2-K, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, and OCT2 (table below).

Transporter-mediated uptake of tirbanibulin was tested in each of the MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, and OCT2-expressing cell systems. Based on the results, tirbanibulin was 
not a substrate for MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, and OCT2 transporters. 
Study C18090 evaluated The in vitro interaction between KX2-5036, the pyridine acetamide metabolite 
of tirbanibulin, and human ABC efflux transporters (MDR1, BCRP, BSEP, and MRP2) and SLC 
transporters (MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, and OCT2) was evaluated. 
The ATP-dependent transport of KX2-5036 by MDR1, BCRP, BSEP, and MRP2 was evaluated in 
membrane  vesicular assays. The transporter-specific ATP-dependent accumulation of KX2-5036 was 
<2-fold at all tested concentrations in the MDR1 and MRP2 membrane  vesicles. Greater than 2-fold 
accumulation of KX2-5036 at 0.1 and 1 μM was observed in BCRP. In a follow-up assay where 
transport was measured in the absence and presence of Ko143, a specific BCRP transport inhibitor 
showed that BCRP-mediated ATP-dependent accumulation of KX2-5036 did not change in the presence 
of 1 μM Ko143. Greater than 2-fold accumulation of KX2-5036 at 1 μM in BSEP-expressing membrane 
vesicles was observed. At 1 μM, the BSEP-mediated and ATP-dependent accumulation fold (3.5) was 
likely due the low ATP-dependent accumulation fold from the control vesicles (0.5), but not from the 
ATP-dependent accumulation fold from BSEP vesicles, because the ATP-dependent accumulation fold 
was <2 (1.6) from BSEP vesicles. 
Inhibition potential of KX2-5036 on the transport activities of MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, and OCT2 was evaluated in cellular uptake inhibition assays. Under 
experimental conditions, <50% inhibition by KX2-5036 up to 100 μM was observed for MATE1, OAT1, 
OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1. KX2-5036 at 100 μM inhibited MATE2-K and OCT2 by 67.6% 
and 77.7%, respectively. The follow-up inhibition assays were performed in the presence of 7 
concentrations of KX2-5036 to obtain IC50 values for MATE2-K and OCT2. The calculated IC50 values 
are 63.1 and 9.1 μM for MATE2-K and OCT2, respectively. 
Transporter-mediated uptake of KX2-5036 was tested in each of the MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, and OCT2-expressing cell systems and the corresponding control systems. 
No accumulation >2-fold was observed for any transporter except OAT3. Follow-up substrate assays 
showed that the cellular accumulation observed was not inhibited by 100 μM probenecid, as specific 
inhibitor of OAT3.

Single dose toxicity 
A GLP-compliant study evaluated the irritating dermal effects of tirbanibulin ointment and the plasma 
TK of tirbanibulin following a single dermal application of ointment to the intact skin of male and 
female (3 M/F) Bama minipigs (Study 44103-13-835). Ointment at a dose of 0.5 g ointment containing

either 0, 5 mg/g, or 10 mg/g of tirbanibulin was applied to the dosing area (2×3 cm) of each animal 
and covered with a gauze patch, which was held in place with non-irritating tape for approximately  4 h. 
After each 4-h exposure, residual test ointment was cleared using warm  water. Animals were observed 
for up to 14 days post-dose. No mortality, moribundity, or any effect on clinical observations, body 
weight, or dermal observations was noted in the minipigs. All tirbanibulin plasma concentrations were 
below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ, <1 ng/mL). Therefore, no TK analysis could be performed.

Pivotal studies in rats and minipigs (Study 321-0032-TX and Study 321-0033-TX) assessed the 
possible toxic effects of 28 days of daily doses of tirbanibulin ointment applied to approximately  10% 
BSA (2 mL/kg) at body weight doses of 2 to 40 mg/kg/day (0.1% to 2% ointment concentration) for 
up to 20 h/day to male and female animals, with the application site being semi-occluded. 
In rats (Study 321-0032-TX), toxicity, including death, occurred in the control group (due to animal 
wrapping) and in groups administered 20 and 40 mg tirbanibulin/kg/day for up to 28 days. Histology 
findings in thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow  (femur and sternum) and associated 
haematologic changes occurred in males and females. In addition, adverse effects were seen 
histologically in the testes. Changes at the skin application sites included slight to severe eschar and/or 
erythema, and/or skin scaling, and/or ulceration. The NOAEL for systemic toxicity for tirbanibulin 
ointment was 2 mg/kg/day in both sexes. At this dose, mean tirbanibulin systemic exposure (AUC0-
24h) was 205 (males)/216 (females) ng.h/mL. These exposure levels were comparable  to systemic 
exposures not associated with toxicity following oral dosing in rats (Study 7709-102). 
In minipigs (Study 321-0033-TX), treatment-related deaths occurred in groups administered 20 mg/kg 
and 40 mg/kg daily for up to 28 days. Histologic findings in these animals indicated that the deaths 
were related to sepsis and enteropathy. Treatment-related microscopic  observations at the end of the 
dosing phase occurred in the digestive system (tongue, oesophagus, ileum, cecum, colon, rectum, and 
liver), lymphoid and haematopoietic tissues (thymus, mesenteric and axillary lymph nodes, and sternal 
bone marrow),  and reproductive tissues (ovaries, vagina, testes, and epididymides). The NOAEL for 
tirbanibulin ointment was 2 mg/kg/day for 28 days in both sexes. At this dose, mean tirbanibulin 
systemic exposure (AUC0-24h) was 37.4 (males)/32.7 (females) ng.h/mL. 
The toxicity of a less prolonged exposure to dermal tirbanibulin was assessed in 5-day studies in rats 
(Study 392 0053-TX) and minipigs (Study 392-0054-TX), in which tirbanibulin ointment was applied 
daily to approximately  10% BSA at doses of up to 20 mg/kg for 8 h/day for 5 consecutive days to male 
and female animals with no occlusion to the application site in the rat study and with semi-occlusion in 
the minipig study. Systemic toxicity was only observed in rats, was similar to that seen in the 28-day 
rat study and was related to tirbanibulin plasma exposure. Target organs include the intestine 
(epithelium), bone marrow,  thymus, and testes. The NOAEL concentration for systemic toxicity of 
tirbanibulin ointment was 0.1% (2 mg/kg tirbanibulin) (exclusive of testicular effects) in male rats. The 
NOAEL for systemic toxicity was not defined in female rats because of the occurrence of mild bone 
marrow  hypocellularity in 2/10 rats at 2 mg/kg/day. These bone marrow  effects were not observed in 
any of the treatment groups at the end of the recovery phase, indicating these histopathological 
changes to be transient. Therefore, for female rats, 2 mg/kg/day was assigned the LOAEL for dermal 
tirbanibulin ointment. The NOAEL for systemic toxicity in minipigs was 20 mg/kg/day tirbanibulin, the 
highest tested dose. This corresponds to a systemic exposure that is ≥17 greater than maximal human 
exposure in the MUsT clinical study. 
The 3-month repeated dose study in Sprague-Dawley rats tested dermal dosing of tirbanibulin 
ointment in 4 cycles of 5 consecutive days of treatment separated by 23 treatment-free days (Study 
78539). For each treatment cycle, 3 doses of tirbanibulin were tested, with doses of 2, 10, 20 mg/kg in 
the first cycle and doses of 1, 5, 10 mg/kg in the subsequent 3 cycles (this reduction of dose in cycles 
2-4 was due to mortality and adverse clinical signs in females in 10 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day 
groups). During tirbanibulin treatment, there were several cases of erythema and of oedema, of 
differing severity, at the dermal application site. No skin reactions were observed in the untreated 
control animals. The frequency and severity of erythema and oedema did not increase in a dose-
dependent manner but was overall higher in females. At the end of the recovery period, there was full 
recovery, with no observed cases of erythema and oedema, except in the highest dose group, in which 
these reactions persisted in a few females until the end of the 4-week recovery period. There was no

urinalysis or haematology and coagulation. In tirbanibulin treated animals, high incidences of ulcers, 
crust, mixed cell infiltrate and apoptosis in the basal layer of the epidermis were observed 
histopathologically in the skin. No differences were noted between males and females within a given 
treated group, or between the groups. Changes considered to be related to an immune suppressive 
effect were seen in the bone marrow,  thymus and spleen of some females at 5 and 10 mg/kg/day. An 
increased incidence of extramedullary haematopoiesis was detected in the males of the groups treated 
with 1 and 5 mg/kg/day during cycles 2-4, which might be secondary to the inflammatory component 
of the treatment-related skin effects. These systemic effects were absent at the end of the recovery 
period. The TK data indicate tirbanibulin systemic exposure consistent with dermal dosing. Exposure 
was higher in females and Cmax and AUC values increased dose-dependently. The maximum plasma 
concentration of tirbanibulin was reached at 1 to 2 h post dosing. Accumulation was not seen from one 
cycle to the next. The NOAEL values for males and female rats corresponds to a systemic exposure 
(based on AUC0-24h values) that were 124- and 38-times, respectively, greater than maximal  human 
exposure in the MUsT clinical study. 
The 3-month repeated dose study in minipigs tested dermal dosing of tirbanibulin ointment containing 
tirbanibulin at 3 concentrations (1, 5, 10 mg/kg) in separate groups of animals (Study 78537). Each 
animal received a once daily dermal application on 5 consecutive days followed by 23 treatment-free 
days, after which the cycle of treatment was repeated 3 times. During tirbanibulin treatment, there 
were several cases of erythema, of differing severity, and a few cases of oedema, of mild severity, at 
the dermal application site. No skin reactions were observed in the control animals. The frequency and 
severity of erythema and oedema increased in a dose-dependent manner without any differences 
between sexes. At the end of the recovery period, there was full recovery, with no cases of erythema 
and oedema observed. Microscopically, treatment-related skin reactions were confined to the epidermis 
and were categorised as primary  (outcome of direct pharmacology, ie increased mitotic figures and 
apoptosis in the basal cell layer) or secondary (sequelae to the primary  changes). Following the 4-
week treatment-free period, the basal cell layer in each treated animal was within normal limits. Body 
weight, food consumption, ECG parameters and ophthalmoscopy were unaffected by the treatment. No 
organ weight, macroscopic  or microscopic  changes occurred. No tirbanibulin ointment-related effects 
were observed on parameters of clinical chemistry, urinalysis or haematology and coagulation. The TK 
data indicate tirbanibulin systemic exposure consistent with dermal dosing. Exposure was higher in 
females and Cmax and AUC values increased dose-dependently. The maximum  plasma concentration of 
tirbanibulin was reached at 0.5 to 8 h post- dose. Accumulation was not seen from one cycle to the 
next. The NOAEL value for minipigs corresponds to a systemic exposure (based on AUC0-24h vales) that 
is 17- and 23-times, in males and females, respectively, greater than maximal human exposure in the 
MUsT clinical study. 
Local toxicity in both species following 5 and 28 days and 3 months of application was seen at all doses 
and included skin irritation and degeneration/necrosis in the epidermis/dermis. Toxicity was reversible 
or showed a tendency toward recovery following the 2 to 3-week recovery period in the respective 
studies. 
Oral administration 
Oral administration of tirbanibulin in rats twice daily (b.i.d.) for 28 days was generally well tolerated in 
males given up to 2.5 mg/kg/dose and females given up to 1.25 mg/kg/dose. The no observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) was defined as 1.25 mg/kg/dose in both sexes (Study 7709-102). At this 
dose, the mean tirbanibulin systemic exposure (Day 27 AUC0-24h) was 295 (males)/620 (females) 
ng.h/mL. It was not possible to assign a NOAEL value for tirbanibulin following b.i.d. oral 
administration for 28 days in dogs but the lowest dose of 0.25 mg/kg/dose b.i.d. was assigned the 
lowest adverse event level (LOAEL) for both sexes (Study 7709-103). Target organs following oral 
dosing included the thymus, testes, intestine, and bone marrow.  GI toxicity and myelosuppression

were the most common systemic toxicities noted. Microscopic assessment of target tissue commonly 
showed villus atrophy and degeneration/loss of the intestinal epithelium and depletion of the bone 
marrow.  These effects were expected based on the mode of action and were generally reversible or 
showed a tendency toward recovery following the 2- to 3-week recovery phases in the respective 
studies. 
Genotoxicity 
Bacterial reverse mutation test 
A GLP-compliant study evaluated the ability of tirbanibulin to induce reverse mutations either in the 
presence or absence of mammalian  microsomal  enzymes (Study 7709-112). The doses tested in the 
mutagenicity assay were selected based on the results of a DRF experiments. Tirbanibulin was checked 
for cytotoxicity for each of the 10 doses tested, where little or no cytotoxicity was observed in the DRF 
study. Therefore, the highest dose concentration of tirbanibulin used in the mutagenicity assay was the 
same dose as that tested in the DRF study (5000 μg). The doses tested were 33.3, 100, 333, 1000, 
2500, and 5000 μg/plate. Formulation concentration verification analyses met acceptance criteria. The 
results from the positive controls (benzo[a]pyrene, 2-aminoanthracene, 2-nitrofluorene, sodium azide, 
ICR-191, 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide) met the assay validity criteria. Precipitation was found in the 
bacterial background lawn at the 2 highest doses (2500 and 5000 μg/plate), and little to no 
cytotoxicity was observed for tirbanibulin.  
Mouse Lymphoma TK Gene Mutation Assay 
The ability of tirbanibulin (KX2-391) to induce forward mutations at the thymidine kinase locus was 
assessed in the mouse lymphoma  cell line L5178Y TK±3.7.2C (L5178Y), in the presence or absence of 
an exogenous metabolic activation system (S9), as assayed by colony growth in the presence of 
trifluorothymidine (TFT resistance, TFTr) (Study 321-0045-GT). In the first definitive mutagenicity 
assay, precipitate was observed in treatment medium at ≥150 μg/mL at the beginning and at the end 
of the treatment period. Since tirbanibulin showed a steep toxicity curve from the cell concentration 
determined on Day 2, plating for mutant frequency (MF), counting colony of MF and mutant colony 
sizing were not performed in the first definitive assay. A second definitive mutagenicity assay was 
performed based on the cytotoxicity data from the first definitive assay. In all 3 treatment conditions, 
the solvent controls met the study validity criteria for acceptable MF, cloning efficiency, and suspension 
growth. The results from the positive controls also met the study validity criteria. A minimum  of 8 
concentrations of tirbanibulin were evaluated in each treatment series. 
Criteria for a positive or negative response in the assay, the Global Evaluation Factor (GEF) method 
was used. Briefly, for this multi-well version of the Mouse Lymphoma  Assay, the GEF was 126×10−6. 
The test article was considered to be clearly positive if, in any of the treatment conditions examined, 
the increase in MF above the concurrent background exceeds the GEF, i.e.,  the induced MF (IMF) was 
above the GEF, and the increase was concentration related. For the S9 activated 3-h exposure series, 
the IMF was 186.4 and 219.6 at 80 (with 13.8% RTG) and 85 μg/mL (with 14.2% RTG), respectively, 
and a weak dose-related increase was observed (linear regression analysis, R2=0.6804). In the non-
activated 3-h exposure series, tirbanibulin did not induce a MF more  than 126×10−6 over the 
concurrent solvent control at any dose concentration and a dose-related increase was not observed 
(linear regression analysis, R2=0.0381). In the non-activated 24-h exposure series, the IMF was 
118.7, 184.8, and 240.1 at 0.018 (with 38.8% RTG), 0.019 (with 20.3% RTG), and 0.02 μg/mL (with 
7.8% RTG), respectively, and a weak dose-related increase was observed (linear regression analysis, 
R2=0.6074). 
Chromosomal Aberrations in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells 
Assessment report

A GLP-compliant study evaluated the ability of tirbanibulin to induce chromosomal aberrations in 
cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with and without S9 (Study 7709-113). The vehicle and 
negative control cultures were in the historical control range for cells with chromosomal  aberrations 
and the positive control cultures had significant increase in cells with chromosomal  aberrations as 
compared with the vehicle control cultures. The high doses selected for analysis in the assay had 
approximately  50% toxicity as compared with the vehicle control cultures and/or had a precipitate at 
the end of the treatment period. In the confirmatory chromosomal  aberrations assay, the treatment 
period with tirbanibulin was for approximately  20 h without metabolic activation and for 3 h with 
metabolic activation. The cell cultures were harvested approximately  20 h from the initiation of 
treatment. Tirbanibulin concentrations of 6.43, 12.9, 25.7, 41.3, 51.5, 77.2, 103, 147, 210, 255, 300, 
and 400 μg/mL were tested without metabolic  activation and 25.7, 51.5, 103, 147, 210, 255, 300, and 
400 μg/mL were tested with metabolic activation.  
Cultures were treated with concentrations (% mitotic index reduction) of 25.7 (0), 41.3 (2), 51.5 (34), 
and 210 (47) μg/mL without metabolic  activation and 51.5 (0), 103 (0), 147 (1), and 210 (0) μg/mL 
with metabolic.  Precipitates were visible at concentrations ≥103 and ≥210 µg/mL in incubations without 
and with metabolic activation, respectively. Without metabolic activation, a significant increase in cells 
with chromosomal aberrations was observed in the cultures treated with 25.7, 51.5, and 210 μg/mL. 
No significant increase in polyploidy or endoreduplication was observed in the cultures analysed. With 
metabolic activation, a significant increase in cells with chromosomal aberrations was observed in the 
cultures treated with 147 and 210 μg/mL. No significant increase in polyploidy or endoreduplication 
was observed in the cultures analysed. 
In vivo rat micronucleus test  
A GLP-compliant study determined if tirbanibulin has clastogenic activity and/or has the ability to 
disrupt the mitotic apparatus via an induction of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocyte cells (PCE) in 
the bone marrow  of adult Sprague-Dawley rats (Study 321-0044-GT). Tirbanibulin was administered 
as free base, formulated in 3% (v/v) acetic acid in purified water. In the definitive micronucleus assay, 
35 rats/sex were assigned to 7 groups. The dose concentrations were 7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg in males 
and 3.75, 7.5, and 15 mg/kg in females, respectively. Vehicle was administered concurrently with the 
same treatment scheme as tirbanibulin. The positive control article (cyclophosphamide monohydrate) 
was given by single intraperitoneal (IP) injection at 20 mg/kg. The animals were necropsied at 
approximately  at 24 or 48 h. One female rat in Group 1 (vehicle control) was found dead on Day 2. 
This animal showed abnormal respiratory  sounds on Days 1 and 2. Given <5 analysable female rats 
were available in control Group 1, only the results obtained for females at the 48-h and males at the 
24- and 48-h timepoints were evaluated for the effect of tirbanibulin on PCE micronucleus formation. 
Statistically significant increases in micronucleus formation (p<0.05, ANOVA) were observed following 
30 mg/kg tirbanibulin in males and 15 mg/kg tirbanibulin in females, both at the 24- and 48-h 
sampling timepoints. Males dosed at 15 mg/kg also showed statistically significant increased 
micronucleus frequency (p<0.05, ANOVA) at the 24-h sampling timepoint when compared with the 
concurrent vehicle control. 
A GLP-compliant study determined whether tirbanibulin has clastogenic activity and/or has the ability 
to disrupt the mitotic apparatus as evidenced by an induction of micronuclei in PCE in the bone marrow 
or by DNA damage in liver cells (Study 54715.00103) Tirbanibulin was administered by oral gavage to 
adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats as the free base, after preparation  in 5% DMSO in 
deionised water at concentrations of 0.075, 0.25, 0.75, and 2.5 mg/mL for administration to males and 
0.0375, 0.125, 0.375, and 1.25 mg/mL for administration to females daily on 3 consecutive days. 
Approximately  3 h following the final dose, animals were sacrificed, and liver sections were collected 
for DNA damage assessment by the comet assay and blood samples were collected for micronucleus 
frequency assessment. The study met the validity criteria for the test. All animals survived until the 
Assessment report

end of the study. In the micronucleus assay, there was a dose-dependent reduction in the frequency of 
PCE, which was evidence of bone marrow  cytotoxicity, in both male and female animals exposed to 
tirbanibulin, which was statistically significant in males after a dose of 25 mg/kg/day and in females 
after a doses of 3.75 and 12.5 mg/kg/day. In 2 females, the concentrations of cytotoxicity after 12.5 
mg/kg/day exceeded the maximum  concentration recommended by the test guideline and these 
animals were excluded from the analysis. There was a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of 
micronucleated PCE (MN-PCE) in male rats, which was statistically significant after 25 mg/kg/day 
tirbanibulin, and in females, which was statistically significant after 3.75 and 12.5 mg/kg/day 
tirbanibulin. 
In the comet assay of liver tissue, there was a dose-dependent increase in DNA damage that was 
statistically significant, compared to the negative control, in males exposed to 25 mg/kg/day 
tirbanibulin; however, all groups fell clearly within the laboratory’s  historical negative control range. 
There was also a statistically significantly positive result for induction of DNA damage in liver of female 
rats exposed to 1.25 mg/kg/day tirbanibulin. With no evidence of dose-dependency, response at only 
the second lowest dose, and all values within the historical control range, this result was considered a 
chance finding and not biologically relevant. Because the comet assay yielded some positive results in 
both male and female rats, the results were considered equivocal.

A GLP-compliant study of tirbanibulin on fertility and early embryonic development to implantation in 
adult Sprague-Dawley rats was performed with once daily oral administration of tirbanibulin in males 
and females prior  to and during the mating period, as well as during early gestation in females (Study 
321-0034-TX). The dose concentrations for this study were set to 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg/day for male rats 
and 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg/day for female rats via oral gavage. The control group was administered 
control formulation (3% (v/v) acetic acid in purified water, pH~2 to 3). The dose volume for females 
was 2.5 mL/kg. The dose volume for males was initially 10 mL/kg but was reduced to 5 mL/kg from 
Day 25 until termination due to mortality related to respiratory irritation in all groups, which resulted 
from the acetic acid in the vehicle. Males were treated for 9 weeks prior  to mating and throughout 
mating to termination. Females were dosed for 2 weeks prior to mating and continued throughout 
mating and up to and including Gestation Day 7. 
A total of 17 animals (2/24, 3/24, 5/24 and 4/24 male rats, and 2/24, 0/24, 1/24 and 0/24 female rats 
from control, low-dose, mid-dose and high-dose group respectively) were terminated early due to 
moribund condition or were found dead. Prior to termination, most animals were first noted with 
abnormal respiratory  sounds, which was followed by distended abdomen, a slight to moderate thin 
appearance, laboured breathing, cold to touch, decreased activity, and/or unkempt. These mortalities 
may be related to larynx, trachea, or lung irritation resulting from the presence of acetic acid in the 
vehicle and were not considered to be treatment related. There were no treatment-related changes in 
mortality,  clinical observations, body weight, gravid uterine weight, food consumption, oestrus cycle 
evaluation, cohabitation duration, fertility data (male mating index, male fertility index, female mating 
index, female fertility index, and fecundity index), macroscopic observations, epididymis and ovary 
weights, and litter data (number of corpora lutea, implantations, viable embryos,  non-viable embryos, 
and pre- and post-implantation loss). 
A decrease in testes weight (11.8% for absolute weight and 10.7% for relative weight) was noted in 
males at 4 mg/kg/day, which correlated with decreased sperm count (22.8%), decreased sperm 
motility (10.3%), increased incidences of abnormal  sperm (47%), and increased incidence of 
degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium (characterised by variable degeneration/necrosis and loss 
of germinal cells, most notably affecting spermatocytes and spermatids) in testes. 
The NOAEL of tirbanibulin for female fertility and early embryonic development to implantation in rats 
was considered to be 1 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested in females in the study. The NOAEL of 
tirbanibulin for male fertility was 2 mg/kg/day. Plasma exposure to tirbanibulin at 2 mg/kg/day was 
projected to be 236 ng×h/mL (based on 1.25 mg/kg b.i.d.  oral dosing in Study 7709-102, which was 
58 times greater than human exposure in the maximal  use PK human study (Study KX01-AK-007). 
Embryo-foetal development 
Rats 
A pilot DRF study investigated the toxicity of tirbanibulin in adult pregnant female Sprague-Dawley 
rats, embryos,  and foetuses following once daily oral gavage from Gestation Day 6 up to Gestation Day 
17, with scheduled termination at Gestation Day 21 (Study 321-0046-TX). Tirbanibulin was 
administered at doses of 0, 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg/day formulated in 3% (v/v) acetic acid in purified 
water. Treatment-related mortalities  (5/8 females at 15 mg/kg/day, 5/8 females at 10 mg/kg/day, and 
1/8 female at 5 mg/kg/day) occurred in this study on Gestation Days 9 to 17. Two females receiving 
10 mg/kg/day and 1 receiving 15 mg/kg/day were not pregnant at the time of death. Abnormal 
soft/watery stool, decreased activity, and cold to touch were observed at 10 and 15 mg/kg/day. 
Abnormal  respiratory sounds, soiled coat, and thin and unkempt appearance were observed at 5, 10, 
and 15 mg/kg/day. Treatment-related decreases in body weight and food consumption occurred, 
ranging from 29% to 33% and 25% to 61%, respectively. A 100% post-implantation loss (embryonic 
Assessment report

resorptions and/or early resorptions) was observed in all pregnant female rats receiving 5, 10, or 15 
mg/kg/day. 
The pivotal GLP compliant embryo-foetal development in Sprague-Dawley rats administered oral 
tirbanibulin once daily from Gestation Day 6 to 17 at doses of 0, 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day (Study 
321-0047-TX). Animals received oral gavage doses of tirbanibulin formulated in 3% (v/v) acetic acid in 
purified water.  Decreased body weight (up to 17.3%) were observed at 2.5 mg/kg/day during late-
gestation (Gestation Day 15 to 21), and decreased gravid uterine weight (16.0% and 45.3%, 
respectively) were noted at 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day, when compared to the control. No changes 
occurred in food consumption and absolute gestation weight gain. Therefore, these changes were 
considered to be induced by decreased foetal body weight and were not considered as an indication of 
maternal toxicity. An increased number of embryo  deaths (embryonic resorptions) and/or decreased 
numbers of live foetuses were observed at 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day when compared to control. The 
post-implantation loss at 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day (11.0% and 71.1%, respectively) was higher than in 
the control group (post-implantation loss of 2.6%). 
Decreased foetal body weight (9.2% and 23.3% respectively) and foetal crown-rump length (4.1% and 
11.3%, respectively) were observed at 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day when compared to control. In 
addition, increased incidence of foetuses (25.2% and 48.7%, respectively) and incidence of litters 
(63.6% and 100%, respectively) with skeletal variations were observed at 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day 
when compared to control (incidence of foetuses and litters of 6.9% and 21.7%, respectively). 
Foetal external, visceral, and skeletal malformations were observed at 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day. 
External malformations included absent pinna, malpositioned pinna, small pinna, absent eye bulge, 
small lower jaw, cleft upper jaw, cleft palate, digit misshapen (forepaw), cranial meningocele, 
exencephaly, meningo-encephalocele, hyperextension hind limb,  malrotated hind limb,  localised and 
generalised subcutaneous oedema, bent, hooked, misshapen and thread-like tail, absent anus, and 
omphalocele. Visceral malformations included dilated lateral ventricle, eye absent, and absent lens. 
Skeletal malformations included split basisphenoid; absent, branched, misshapen and fused cervical 
arch; absent cervical vertebra; fused exoccipital and frontal, fused and misshapen lumbar  arch; absent 
lumbar vertebra,  supernumerary lumbar vertebra; absent rib,  fused rib; misshapen scapula; absent 
sternebra, fused sternebra; and absent, misshapen, and fused thoracic arch. 
There were no treatment-related changes in mortality, clinical observations, absolute gestation weight 
gain, food consumption, macroscopic observations, litter data (the number of corpora  lutea, 
implantation sites, foetal death, pre-implantation loss), and sex ratio in the study. The NOAEL of 
tirbanibulin for maternal toxicity was considered to be 2.5 mg/kg/day. The mean Cmax and AUC0-8h on 
Gestation Day 17 following 2.5 mg/kg/day were 95.7 ng/mL and 417 ng×h/mL, respectively. The 
NOAEL of tirbanibulin for embryo-foetal developmental toxicity was considered to be 0.5 mg/kg/day. 
The mean Cmax and AUC0-24h on Gestation Day 17 following 0.5 mg/kg/day were 25.4 ng/mL and 90.2 
ng×h/mL, respectively. 
Rabbits 
A non-GLP, pilot DRF study investigated the toxicity of tirbanibulin (KX2-391, administered as free 
base) on pregnant female New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits and embryo  and foetuses following once 
daily oral administration of tirbanibulin at 0, 1, 3, and 6 mg/kg/day formulated in 3% (v/v) acetic acid 
in purified water from Gestation Day 6 up to Gestation Day 18 (321-0048-TX). Two of the 8 females in 
the control group, 1/8 female in the low-dose group, 1/8 female in the mid-dose group, and 2/8 
females in the high-dose group mated but did not result in pregnancy. The other surviving females 
were observed to be pregnant. Three of the 8 high-dose animals were found dead or moribund 
euthanised (Gestation Day 17 to Gestation Day 21). Prior to death, decreased defaecation, 
inappetence, thin appearance, and/or white ears, body weight loss, and decreased food consumption

(up to 79%) were observed. Treatment-related and adverse external malformation (the first digit 
absent in forepaw) was observed at 3 mg/kg/day. Increased, but not statistically significant, post-
implantation losses (30.6% and 28.6%, respectively) were observed at 1 and 3 mg/kg/day, when 
compared to the control (post-implantation loss is 2.6%). The NOAEL of tirbanibulin for maternal 
toxicity in rabbits was considered to be 3 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL of tirbanibulin for embryo-foetus 
developmental toxicity in rabbits was considered to be ˂1 mg/kg/day. 
The definitive GLP-compliant embryo-foetal development study of tirbanibulin used doses of 0, 0.3, 1, 
and 3 mg/kg formulated in 3% (v/v) acetic acid in purified water in NZW rabbits when administered 
once daily orally from Gestation Day 6 to 18. In the Main Study animals, 4/25 females at control, 4/25 
females at low-dose group, 3/25 females at mid-dose group, and 4/25 females at high-dose group 
were inseminated but this did not result in pregnancy. 
There were no treatment-related changes on body weights, macroscopic observations, gravid uterine 
weight, the number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, viable foetuses, non-viable embryo-foetuses, 
placental examinations, pre- and post-implantation loss, and sex ratio following any dose 
concentrations in this study. One high-dose group animal at 3 mg/kg/day was found dead on Gestation 
Day 20. Before death, this animal was noted with moderate inappetence, decreased defecation, thin 
appearance, soft stool, and red materials in pan. No visible gross lesions were observed at necropsy. 
The reason for this death was undetermined but the mortality cannot be excluded as treatment 
related. 
Inappetence and decreased defecation was observed in all groups. The incidence of inappetence and 
decreased defecation was much higher in the test article group than in control, and these clinical signs 
were considered treatment-related and non-adverse. Slight decreases (up to 25%, without statistical 
significance) in daily food consumption were noted at the high-dose group (3 mg/kg/day) during the 
dosing phase (Gestation Days 6 to 7, 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16). Slight and significant decreases 
in foetal weight (10.6%) and foetal crown-rump length (3.8%) were noted at 3 mg/kg/day, when 
compared to the control. Decreased foetal weight and crown-rump length correlated with external 
malformations of first digit absent in forepaw and increased skeletal variations or malformation. 
Treatment-related and adverse malformations were noted following 3 mg/kg/day. External 
malformations (the first digit absent in forepaw) were observed in 23 of 161 foetuses in 8/19 litters. 
Visceral malformations (including right testis absent, lung lobe absent, gallbladder absent, right kidney 
and right ureter absent, dilated aorta, aortic arch, ductus arteriosus, and fused lung lobe) were 
observed in 6 of 161 foetuses in 4/19 litters. Treatment-related skeletal malformations and variations 
were noted following 3 mg/kg/day tirbanibulin. Skull skeletal malformations (fused frontal, nasal, 
premaxilla,  or supernumerary parietal) were observed in 2 of 72 foetuses in 1/18 litters. Skull skeletal 
variations (hole in parietal) were observed in 2 of 72 foetuses in 2/18 litters. Unossified or incomplete 
ossified forepaw phalanx and unossified metacarpal (skeletal variations) was observed in 43 of 138 
foetuses in 13/19 litters. Fused sternebra (skeletal malformation) were observed in 4 of 138 foetuses 
in 3/19 litters. Thoracic vertebra hemivertebra (skeletal malformation, at 10th thoracic vertebra) and 
branched ribs (skeletal malformation) were observed in 1 foetus, and fused ribs (skeletal 
malformation) were observed in 1 foetus at 3 mg/kg/day. 
No treatment-related developmental abnormalities  or effects occurred following administration of 0.3 
or 1 mg/kg/day tirbanibulin. The NOAEL of tirbanibulin for maternal and embryo-foetus developmental 
toxicity in rabbits was considered to be 1 mg/kg/day. The mean Cmax and AUC0-24h on Gestation Day 18 
following 1 mg/kg/day were 144 ng/mL and 266 ng×h/mL, respectively.

A GLP-compliant study evaluated the effects of tirbanibulin on pregnant and lactating female Sprague-
Dawley rats and on the development of the offspring and determined the TK of tirbanibulin, when 
administered once daily via oral gavage at 0, 0.5, 1.25, or 2.5 mg/kg (in 3% glacial acetic acid in 
reverse osmosis water) from implantation through weaning. Maternal toxicity (F0) was assessed based 
on mortality,  clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, and necropsy and caesarean 
section findings. Toxicity was assessed in the F1 offspring based on clinical observations, body weight, 
food consumption, developmental landmark data, and neurobehavioral data. In adulthood, oestrous 
cyclicity was assessed in F1 females. Additionally, F1 females were mated with non-sibling F1 males of 
the same dose group and were then sacrificed on Gestation Day 13 for assessment of reproductive 
indices, macroscopic  observations, and caesarean section parameters. 
Tirbanibulin-related early group sacrifice occurred on Lactation Day 8, 9, 10, 11, or 14 for dams 
administered 2.5 mg/kg/day tirbanibulin. Animals administered 2.5 mg/kg/day tirbanibulin were 
removed from the study due to high incidences of failure to produce a viable litter resulting in an 
insufficient group size for data evaluation; as such, these deaths were considered treatment related. 
Pups from these litters were sacrificed as they had not yet reached Postnatal Day 18 and would not 
have survived without the dam. No other tirbanibulin-related mortality occurred. 
Adverse tirbanibulin-related reductions in body weight were noted during gestation for dams 
administered 2.5 mg/kg/day. Statistically significant reductions in body weight during gestation for 
animals of this group were likely due to the lack of viable foetuses noted at the Gestation Day 24 
necropsy. Additionally, adverse tirbanibulin-related effects on natural delivery and litter indices were 
noted for animals administered 2.5 mg/kg/day. Slight treatment-related reductions (by 11%, 
compared with controls) in pup survival (live pups/litters with live pups) were observed from birth to 
Postnatal Day 4 for the group administered 2.5 mg/kg/day. 
No tirbanibulin-related observations were noted in F0 animals administered 0.5 or 1.25 mg/kg/day 
during gestation or lactation. Audible respiration was noted for all groups during gestation, with the 
highest incidence in controls. Observations of audible and/or irregular respiration were also noted for 
all groups during lactation. Since these observations were noted at a high incidence in controls, they 
were attributed to the acetic acid content in the vehicle control article and were considered not 
treatment related. No remarkable  effect on mean body weight, body weight gain, food consumption, 
delivery indices, or pup survival during gestation or lactation was noted in F0 animals administered 0.5 
or 1.25 mg/kg/day tirbanibulin. No remarkable macroscopic  observations were noted for any dose 
concentration at the scheduled necropsy. 
No tirbanibulin-related clinical observations or mortality was observed for the F1 generation for groups 
administered 0.5 or 1.25 mg/kg/day, and no remarkable  observations were noted at scheduled 
sacrifice. No tirbanibulin-related effects on spatial learning and memory  were observed during 
neurobehavioral tests (locomotor activity, acoustic startle, or Morris Water Maze). During F1 
maturation, the number of oestrous cycles for groups administered ≥0.5 mg/kg/day tirbanibulin was 
significantly reduced compared with controls and was considered treatment-related but not adverse as 
the number cycles in tirbanibulin-treated groups was within historical control data. Although 
corresponding reductions in mating and fertility indices and the number of pregnant females in these 
groups were noted, these indices did not reach statistical significance, compared with controls, and did 
not appear to impact mating, fecundity, or fertility indices or pregnancy outcome.

Dermal Irritation Studies 
Rats 
The dermal irritancy potential of tirbanibulin ointment was evaluated on rats’ skin following a single IV 
injection or 6 days of repeated dermal (topical) application in adult Sprague-Dawley rats in a non-GLP 
study (Study PSA13080020). Rats received b.i.d. applications of ointment base or tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment, respectively, for 5 days and a single application on Day 6. After each application, the dosing

area was covered with 1 layer of absorbent gauze secured by elastic wrap. Approximately  4 h after 
each dosing, the elastic wrap,  tape, and absorbent gauze were removed, and residual test article or 
control ointment base was removed by serial washing with water/75% ethanol/propylene glycol. At the 
end of the study, a section of skin from the application area from animals was collected and prepared 
for histopathology evaluation. Histopathology examination determined minimal to mild multifocal 
hyperplasia in stratum spinosum of the epidermis in all animals in Groups 2 (ointment base) and 3 
(1% tirbanibulin) and minimal focal round cell infiltration of the epidermis in Group 3. 
Rabbits 
A non-GLP study evaluated the dermal irritancy potential of tirbanibulin ointment (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 
1%) and ointment base (propylene glycol) on intact rabbit  skin after 8 days of repeated dermal 
application (Study PSA13100016). After each application,  the dosing area (designated as 14×15 cm, 
about 10% BSA) was covered with 1 layer of absorbent gauze secured by non-irritating tape. The 
dermal irritation responses were determined and scored according to the Draize Score tables. In Draize 
scoring, most of the test animals showed slight to moderate erythema and oedema with a dose-
dependent increase in severity. The general histopathological evaluation of the treatment sites showed 
that the test article showed some concentration of irritation as evidenced by epidermal thickening, 
cellular infiltration, and focal degeneration necrosis that also indicated a dose-response pattern of 
increasing severity with increase in dose. Based on these results, the test article and control article 
(tirbanibulin ointment and ointment base) administered to the NZW rabbits by repeated dermal 
application for 8 consecutive days caused slight to moderate irritation on the intact skin in vivo, with a 
dose-related trend in the severity of the irritation. 
A non-GLP study evaluated the dermal irritancy potential of tirbanibulin ointment on intact rabbit skin 
and the TK following dermal application (Study PSA14010020). Tirbanibulin ointment was applied at 
levels of 0.005, 0.01, or 0.05 %. Each animal received repeated dermal application (b.i.d.,  4 h/time, 
with a 4-h interval between treatments) for 14 consecutive days except Group 5 (no treatment control 
group) animals. For each application,  the dosing area (designated as 14×15 cm, about 10% BSA) was 
covered with one layer of absorbent gauze and fixed by non-irritating tape. Most of the observed 
Draize scores were grade 0. The histopathological examination did not reveal any significant signs of 
inflammation, haemorrhage, or necrosis in test article treatment sites. Based on these results, 
tirbanibulin ointment, administered to the NZW rabbits by repeated dermal application for 14 
consecutive days at different doses (up to 0.05% b.i.d.) did not cause dermal irritation on the intact 
skin in vivo. The CIIs calculated were 0, 0, 0.07, and 0.1 following tirbanibulin doses of 0.005, 0.01, or 
0.05 % ointment b.i.d., respectively. The CII of the no treatment control group was 0. 
Ocular Irritation 
A GLP-compliant study evaluated the acute ocular toxicity of tirbanibulin ointment following a single 
ocular administration to male NZW rabbits (Study 4103-13-830). Tirbanibulin 1% ointment was 
administrated to the left eye of each animal once at a dose volume of 0.1 g/eye. The untreated right 
eye of each rabbit  served as a control. After 24 h of treatment, the left eye of each rabbit was rinsed 
with saline. During ocular lesion evaluation in the treated eye, slight conjunctiva redness was noted in 
3/3 rabbits from 1 h up to 3 days post-dose and slight to mild conjunctiva chemosis was observed in 
3/3 rabbits at 1 h post-dose. No abnormalities were noted in the cornea or iris. The results indicated 
that tirbanibulin 1% ointment was an irritant in the rabbit ocular irritation assay. The irritation cleared 
within 3 days post-dose. 
A GLP study evaluated the ocular irritation potential of tirbanibulin 1% ointment in an ECVAM-validated 
EpiOcular tissue model (OECD Test Guideline 492) (Study 031-19). This study tested tirbanibulin in the 
to be marketed tirbanibulin ointment base formulation (90% [w/w] Propylene Glycol USP and 10% 
[w/w] mono- and diglycerides NF). Fifty μL of each test (ointment base) and control article (water as 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021

negative control, methyl acetate as positive control) were delivered to the surface of the tissue, 
followed by an incubation for 30 min, a 12-min soak to remove any excess test or control article, and a 
further 2-h incubation period without test or control article. The tissue was further incubated for 3 h 
with a dye (MTT reagent). Viability  >60% of the negative control is non-irritating while viability ≤60% 
of the negative control is considered irritating. The positive control demonstrated irritating potential, 
whereas tirbanibulin 1% ointment did not display any irritation potential, as measured by cell viability 
compared to the cell viability after application of the negative control. 
Other  toxicity  studies 
Antigenicity 
A GLP-compliant study evaluated the contact allergenic potential of tirbanibulin ointment using the 
mouse local lymph node assay (LLNA) (Study 8301030). Tirbanibulin ointment at concentrations of 
0.01, 0.1, and 1.0%, or tirbanibulin ointment base (vehicle) at a concentration of 0% were 
administered to 5 mice/dose group. Tirbanibulin ointment was applied to the dorsal aspect of the ears 
of the mice to evaluate contact allergenic potential based on the induction of lymphocyte proliferation 
from the auricular lymph nodes. Mice were dosed once daily for 3 consecutive days. Following the 3-
day dosing period and a subsequent 2 days without treatment, a single IV injection of [3H]thymidine 
was then administered to each mouse. Approximately  5 h following the [3H]thymidine injection, mice 
were sacrificed, and the auricular lymph nodes were collected intact and pooled for each individual 
animal. all animals in the 25% (v/v) hexylcinnamaldehyde positive control group exhibited slight 
erythema (corresponding to a score of 1) on both ears between Days 2 and 5. There were no 
observations noted for the mice in the other treatment groups. The mean SI value for the 
hexylcinnamaldehyde positive control was 6.4. Exposure of animals to tirbanibulin ointment at 0.01, 
0.1, and 1% (w/w) resulted in mean SI values of 1.2, 0.8, and 3.1, respectively. The differences in 
mean dpm values in mice treated with high dose, tirbanibulin ointment 1% were statistically significant 
when compared with the corresponding tirbanibulin ointment vehicle group (2910 vs. 939 mean dpm, 
p ≤0.05). Acceptance criteria for identification of a test article as a contact sensitiser in the LLNA 
included an SI of 3.0 or greater at any dose concentration, statistically significant differences from 
control values, and evidence of a dose response. Tirbanibulin 1% ointment met 2 of those criteria. 
A GLP-compliant study following the principles of the Buehler test evaluated the skin sensitisation 
potential of tirbanibulin ointment following epidermal application to Guinea pigs (Study 44103-13-837). 
Tirbanibulin ointment was administered as a topical dose to the flanks of Guinea pigs to evaluate skin 
sensitisation potential. For induction, neomycin sulphate (Group 1), ointment base (vehicle) (Group 2) 
or tirbanibulin 1% and 4% ointment (Groups 3 and 4, respectively) were administered via test patch to 
the left flank dosing areas (3×3 cm) for approximately  6 h/dose on Days 1, 7, and 14. For the 
challenge on Day 27, neomycin sulphate (Group 1), tirbanibulin ointment base (vehicle) (Group 2), or 
tirbanibulin 1% and 4% ointment (Groups 3 and 4, respectively) were administered via test patch to 
the right flank dosing areas (3×3 cm) for approximately  6 h. Following the induction doses, slight 
irritation, oedema, and/or erythema were noted in all Guinea pigs in the positive control and 
tirbanibulin 1% and 4% ointment dose groups, following the second and third induction doses. 
Following the challenge dose, slight oedema and/or erythema was noted in 2 positive control 
(neomycin sulphate) animals, 4 tirbanibulin 1% ointment animals, and 5 tirbanibulin 4% ointment 
animals 48 h post-dose. 
Metabolites  
No dedicated metabolic toxicity studies were performed. 
Impurities 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 49/144 
 
 
 
The specification for the drug product only contains a single impurity,  Impurity C, above the ICH Q3B 
qualification threshold. The drug lots used for dermal studies in rats and minipigs of 5 and 28-days 
duration were spiked with levels of Impurity  C ≥ 4.1%. In all instances based on the NOAEL for the 
study the data suggested that the margin of exposure was at 16-fold that at which patients will be 
exposed to. In particular,  considering the similarities of the skin of minipigs to humans, the calculated 
margins of exposure were 1004 for the 5-day study and 89-fold for the 28-day study. Therefore, the 
proposed drug product specification of 2% for Impurity C is considered qualified from a toxicological 
perspective. 
Phototoxicity 
A GLP-compliant study evaluated the phototoxicity of tirbanibulin (KX01) following a single dermal 
application and UVA (365 nm) irradiation in NZW rabbits (Study 44103-13-831). Tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment, vehicle (ointment base), or 0.1% Methoxsalen solution (8-Mop, positive control; 0.1 
mL/site) were applied to each of 2 dorsal dose application sites/animal. Following 15 min of drying 
post-application, 1 of each of the 2 application sites was exposed to UVA irradiation (365 nm) at 10 
J/cm2 for a duration of 40 to 50 min. 
No mortalities were noted in this study. There were no treatment-related effects on clinical 
observations, body weight, or body weight changes. Sites treated with the positive control, 0.1% 
Methoxsalen solution, with UVA exposure demonstrated moderate to severe erythema and mild to 
severe oedema beginning 24 h post-UVA exposure, which had not resolved 72 h post-UVA exposure in 
all 6 rabbits.  In contrast, there were no abnormalities noted in any other application sites following 
application and UVA exposure.

The molecular mechanism of how tirbanibulin binds to tubulin resulting in the induction of cell cycle 
arrest have been sufficiently elucidated. The provided in vitro studies have shown that tirbanibulin 
binds to tubulin, inhibiting its polymerisation and resulting in the disruption of the microtubule 
network, which leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest. Additionally, tirbanibulin induces apoptosis through the 
activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways and has potent anti-proliferative activity against a 
variety of cancer cell lines, including melanoma, SCC, and multi-drug resistant cancer cell lines.

Tirbanibulin induces cell growth inhibition and cell death more potently in rapidly dividing cells. The 
effects on Src kinase signalling are ambiguous, with the weight of evidence suggesting that any effects 
on this signalling pathway are indirect and a result of microtubule disruption. Of particular relevance, 
considering the indication for the treatment of actinic keratosis of the face and scalp, is the data from 
the immortalised keratinocyte cell line, CCD-1106 KERTr. The more  rapidly dividing keratinocytes were 
more susceptible to the cell growth inhibitory effects of tirbanibulin. This could potentially suggest that 
the keratinocytes in the lesions of patients may be more susceptible to the effects of tirbanibulin than 
any surrounding keratinocytes. 
Although the in vivo studies are limited to the investigation of tirbanibulin in xenograft tumour models, 
there is sufficient rationale and non-clinical evidence to support its potential for efficacy in AK patients.  
No safety pharmacology studies were performed using topical administration. Oral gavage dosing was 
used for the CNS studies and for the investigations on the GI system while IV administration was used 
for the cardiovascular and respiratory  study. Statistically significant shortening of the PR, QRS and QTc 
intervals were seen. The changes seen were deemed to be within an acceptable physiological range. 
Considering the differences in the route of administration and the fact that no ECG changes were seen 
following dermal application in minipigs in the repeat toxicity studies, these observations are not 
considered clinically relevant. In the GI safety pharmacology studies no effect was seen on gastric 
emptying, however, motility was statistically increased in the lower GI tract with both oral and 
subcutaneous administration. The differences measured were small and considering the topical nature 
of application unlikely to be of any clinical significance for the current application. 
Considering the topical nature of the treatment the absence of pharmacodynamic drug interaction 
studies is considered appropriate. 
Pharmacokinetics 
All methods and limits of quantification were adequate regarding specificity and sensitivity to support 
the kinetic analyses of tirbanibulin. 
The PK profile has been examined in the nonclinical species used for the toxicity studies. The 
absorption following dermal application was higher in rat compared to the minipig, however, the 
minipig is typically seen as a better model and more reflective of the absorption in humans. 
Considering the clinical route of administration, the most relevant study in rats using dermal 
application with a 1% ointment suggested low bioavailability of 1.59% after 24 h. The metabolic  profile 
of the nonclinical species is reflective of that seen in humans and there are no metabolites in humans 
that are not present at similar  or higher levels in the nonclinical species.  
The mass balance study in rats revealed that the main route of excretion of tirbanibulin was via biliary 
excretion into the faeces with urinary excretion as a minor route and no differences between the sexes. 
The potential for drug-drug interactions was investigated using the standard battery of in vitro studies 
looking at CYP enzyme inhibition and induction as well as the potential for tirbanibulin to be an 
inhibitor or substrate for the various transporters. A time dependent inhibition was seen for CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 by tirbanibulin. The inhibition of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 was reversible whilst 
the inhibition of CYP3A4/5 was irreversible.  Considering the maximum  clinically measured levels of ~ 
2.5 nM for tirbanibulin, these findings do not lead to any concern for inhibition of CYP2C9, CYP 2C19 or 
CYP3A4/5 in the clinical setting. Tirbanibulin was identified as an inhibitor of MATE1, MATE2-K, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, and OCT2. The lowest calculated IC50 was 1.4 µM for OCT2 which, 
considering the previously mentioned maximum  clinically measured levels of ~ 2.5 nM for tirbanibulin, 
the clinical relevance can be considered low. 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021

Given the route of administration (topical), the dual route of CYP metabolism,  the low daily dose of 
tirbanibulin (up to 2.5 mg), the short duration of dosing (5 days), and the low systemic exposure 
(subnanomolar mean Cmax), it is considered unlikely that co-administration of strong CYP3A4/5 or 
CYP2C8 inhibitors will adversely affect systemic tirbanibulin exposure. 
The potential for drug-drug interactions has been adequately addressed in vitro and any potential 
interactions are unlikely considering the measured inhibition constants and the low levels of systemic 
exposure seen after clinical use (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Toxicology 
Several of the toxicology studies were conducted at a site located in a country which is neither an 
OECD nor OECD-MAD member.  This includes two of the genotoxicity studies (Mouse lymphoma TK 
gene mutation assay [Study 7709-113]; Bone marrow  micronucleus test in rat [Study 321-0044-GT]) 
and three of the reproductive toxicity studies (Study 321-0034-TX in rat and Studies 321-0047-TX and 
321-0049-TX in rats and rabbits). Therefore, the claimed GLP status of these studies is not accepted. 
However,  it should be noted that three additional genotoxicity studies were conducted in an OECD 
country (Ames study [Study 7709-112]; Chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells [Study 7709-113]; 
Micronucleus and Comet assay in rats [Study 54715.00103]) as well as a reproductive toxicology study 
(Study 8379929). In addition, the most relevant repeat dose toxicity study in minipigs with 5 days 
dermal administration followed by 23 days off treatment for a total of 4 cycles was performed in an 
OECD country. The aforementioned studies did not show any irregularities or signs of GLP non-
compliance and based on inspections from an EU GLP monitoring authority there is evidence that this 
facility conducts studies in compliance with the OECD GLP regulations. Therefore, although none of the 
non-GLP studies are considered pivotal to the assessment, they can be accepted as supportive for the 
risk assessment.  
Concerning the single dose toxicity studies, the proposed studies did not allow to determinate the 
lethal or sub-lethal dose or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for tirbanibulin. However, as outlined 
in ICH M3(R1) such studies are not required. The acute toxicity can be inferred from the observations 
in the repeat dose studies in rats after oral and dermal administration. In these studies, mortality was 
typically seen after between 6 to 8 days dosing and the systemic exposure measured was always > 
1,000 ng.h/mL. Tirbanibulin is to be marketed in sachets containing at least 250 mg of tirbanibulin 10 
mg/g ointment, i.e. 2.5 mg tirbanibulin, intended for topical administration. Even when applying the 
complete sachet topically, systemic exposure is estimated to be 140-fold lower (7 ng.h/mL) than the 
doses associated with mortality.  Even if a patient would inadvertently ingest a whole sachet, systemic 
exposure is estimated to be 50-fold lower than the doses associated with mortality.    
Significant toxicities have been seen, including mortalities, at high levels of systemic exposure. The 
toxicities were consistent across species and in line with the pharmacology of the compound as a 
microtubule disruptor. The tissues where toxicity was observed contained rapidly dividing cell 
populations. In the pivotal dermal toxicity studies in minipigs following a similar posology to that of the 
proposed indication there was no systemic toxicity evident with only local site reactions which is similar 
to that seen with clinical use. The systemic exposure at the NOAEL in this study was at least 9-fold of 
that measured clinically.  
Epithelial cell hyperplasia was seen at the dermal application site which is likely indicative of cell 
regeneration. The hyperplasia was observed in tissues which undergo a high turnover rate and is likely 
secondary to degeneration of epithelial tissues following apoptotic and necrotic cell death induced by 
the pharmacological action of tirbanibulin. In the dermal study in minipigs the dermal hyperplasia 
observed was attributable to the action of tirbanibulin inducing apoptosis of the basal cell layer of the 
epidermis and the subsequent reparative hyperplasia to replace the layer of epidermis. The findings 
almost completely reversed after recovery and it is hypothesised that if this recovery time was 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 52/144 
 
 
 
extended total recovery would be likely. The findings in relation to the dermal hyperplasia occurred in 
animals with healthy skin as a direct result of the pharmacological activity of tirbanibulin inducing cell 
death of healthy keratinocytes. In the context of treatment of actinic keratosis, the same 
pharmacological activity results in cell death of keratinocytes undergoing uncontrolled proliferation. 
There was a slightly higher incidence of treatment-emergent skin cancers with tirbanibulin (see clinical 
section) and the potential of local tumours arising from the topical use of tirbanibulin, however, the 
weight of evidence provided suggest that risk is low. Nevertheless, local skin tumours in the treatment 
area will be monitored as an important potential risk, including an imposed PASS,  which is considered 
appropriate  to address any concerns for potential effects in the treatment area where exposure levels 
will be highest. 
The results of the Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay with a confirmatory assay indicated that under the 
conditions of this study, tirbanibulin is not mutagenic. 
No carcinogenicity studies were submitted. Considering that duration of treatment is limited to five 
days carcinogenicity studies would not be expected and therefore, the absence of carcinogenicity 
studies is considered acceptable. 
In embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, embryonic and foetal toxicity, including 
foetal malformations, occurred at multiples of 22 times and 65 times greater than human exposure in 
the maximal use pharmacokinetic human study. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, 
reductions in fertility and increased embryo-foetal lethality were seen in the offspring of treated 
females. 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, decrease in testes weight which correlated 
with decreased sperm count, decreased sperm  motility, increased incidences of abnormal sperm,  and 
increased incidence of degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium, considered indicative of male 
fertility toxicity, occurred at multiples of 58 times greater than human exposure in the maximal use 
pharmacokinetic human study. However, there were no changes in male mating or fertility indices. 
Tirbanibulin was a threshold based genotoxin, with a margin of exposure of at least 22-fold based on 
AUC and 174-fold based on Cmax levels from the dose levels in which no genotoxic events were seen 
and which is based on a GLP compliant study performed in an OECD country. Moreover, it is likely the 
observed genotoxicity was a result of the induction of apoptosis within the same cells. The effects of 
reproductive toxicity are reflected in the SmPC. Tirbanibulin has been demonstrated to be both 
teratogenic and genotoxic and there is therefore potential for genetic damage at the level of the germ 
cells and/or conceptus. However, as already discussed there is a threshold for the genotoxic effects 
seen. Comparing Cmax margins of exposure, which is most appropriate  for this type of effects for an 
indirect acting clastogenic compound, a margin of 174-fold exists relative to the levels measured 
clinically following dermal application. Therefore, based on the totality of the data (short duration of 
exposure with systemic exposure in patients at a margin of exposure 174-fold lower than the NOAEL 
(based upon Cmax) for genotoxicity in vivo) it can be considered acceptable to not include the 
contraceptive measures in the SmPC of the recently published “Response from SWP to CMDh questions 
regarding Genotoxicity and Contraception” (EMA/CHMP/SWP/74077/2020).  
Tirbanibulin ointment is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential 
not using contraception. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Consideration should be 
given on whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from tirbanibulin ointment 
therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman. 
Concerning immunotoxicity effects, a primary  pharmacology study on tirbanibulin treatment showed a 
significant induction of IL-1α, and a moderate induction of IL-8 in cultures of the human keratinocyte 
Assessment report

Page 53/144 
 
 
 
cell line CCD-1106 KERTr. However, as previously discussed these are related to the pharmacological 
actions of tirbanibulin inducing cell death. Whilst some evidence of immunosuppression, including 
hypocellularity of the bone marrow,  were seen in the repeat dose toxicity studies at high exposure 
levels, no such effects have been seen clinically and are likely related to the very low systemic 
exposure seen with topical use.  
Local tolerance studies showed that tirbanibulin ointment is a moderate contact sensitiser to the skin 
(Buehler assay in guinea pigs and in murine LLNA  test). Dermal irritation tests in rats and in rabbits 
were positive and the severity of dermal findings increased with increases in dose, but this was not 
confirmed in humans (see clinical safety). 
No dedicated metabolic toxicity studies were performed which is acceptable. Systemic exposure to the 
metabolites, KX2-5036 and KX2-5163, were measured in the repeat dose toxicity study in rats and 
minipigs after dermal application. The results of these suggest that exposures well in excess of that 
seen clinically have been achieved and therefore, these can be considered qualified from a nonclinical 
perspective. 
Based on the findings of Study 44103-13-831, tirbanibulin 1% ointment demonstrated no 
phototoxicity. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion  on the non-clinical aspects 
Tirbanibulin disrupts microtubules by direct binding to tubulin, which induces cell cycle arrest and 
apoptotic death of proliferating cells and is associated with disruption of Src tyrosine kinase signalling. 
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology and repeated dose toxicity.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
All clinical PK data were derived from 3 clinical pharmacology studies conducted in patients with actinic 
keratosis (AK) to determine tirbanibulin PK parameters following topical application of tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment (KX01-AK-01-US, KX01-AK-002 and KX01-AK-007). 
Two formulations of tirbanibulin ointment were used during non-clinical and clinical development: 
Formulation I and the to-be-marketed formulation (TBM) formulation of tirbanibulin 1% ointment. 
Formulation I was used in non-clinical studies and early Phase I and Phase II clinical studies. The TBM 
formulation was used in the pivotal non-clinical 5-day toxicology studies and the clinical MUsT PK, 
Phase I dermal safety, and pivotal Phase III studies. 
Bioanalytical Methods 
Method Validation 
Methods for the determination of tirbanibulin (KX2-391), KX2-5036 and KX2-5163 were validated.  
Method 07047 (version M03 and M04) was utilised during clinical studies KX01-AK-01-US and KX01-
AK-002. This method utilises a liquid-liquid extraction procedure to isolate KX2-391 from 0.1 mL of 
human plasma,  and a reverse-phase HPLC column to separate KX2-391 and the internal standard (IS) 
from the matrix.  The LC-MS/MS instrument was in positive electrospray ionisation-multiple reaction 
monitoring (ESI-MRM) mode to quantitate KX2-391 and the associated (IS). Initially, method 07047 
was developed using a structural analogue of KX2-391 as the IS, but this was later changed to an 
isotopically labelled form of KX2-391, KX2-391-d4 (KX2-3472), during subsequent amendments.   
Due to the limited sensitivity of method to detect KX2-391 in clinical samples (0.1 ng/mL), the new 
method was developed to provide a better characterisation of the PK profile of KX2-391 (0.01 ng/mL) 
during study KX01-AK-007. The method utilises a Supported-Liquid Extraction (SLE) procedure to 
extract the analyte from K2EDTA human plasma, a reverse-phase HPLC column to elute KX2-391 and 
the IS, and an LC-MS/MS instrument with positive ESI-MRM mode for quantification.  
An additional method was developed to assess metabolites KX2-5036 and KX2-5163 during study 
KX01-AK-007. Similar  to methods for assessment of KX2-391, a reversed-phase HPLC column was 
used to elute KX2-5036 and KX2-5163 from plasma,  and a LC-MS/MS instrument for quantification.  
Bioanalysis of Samples 
During the analysis of participant samples, spiked CS and QC standards were extracted to permit the 
determination of the concentration of KX2-391, KX2-5036 and KX2-5163, in addition to the 
assessment of accuracy and precision. All samples were analysed within the established long-term 
stability range. Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) was performed for KX2-391 during KX01-AK-01-US 
and KX01-AK-007, but not KX01-AK-002 due to the number of samples at LLOQ or below the limit of 
quantification (BLQ). Moreover, ISR  was not performed for KX2-5036 and KX2-5163 during KX01-AK-
007 given the majority  of samples near LLOQ or BLQ. 
Absorption   
The PK data from studies using Formulation I (KX01-AK-01-US and KX01-AK-002) were 
uninterpretable or incomplete. Therefore, an assessment of bioequivalence based on clinical PK data 
comparing Formulation I and the TBM formulation was not possible.  Comparison of formulations and 
manufacturing methods for tirbanibulin 1% ointment was done through an assessment of in vitro 
release rates (in vitro release testing [IVRT]) and in vitro permeability  testing (IVPT). 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 56/144 
 
 
 
IVRT demonstrated that the clinical formulations used during development and intended for marketing 
have comparable release characteristics. IVRT also demonstrated the comparability  of drug products 
manufactured at different facilities and formulated with drug substance from different manufacturers 
(detailed in the Quality section).  
The in vitro skin penetration study TER-158-17.00 was conducted to determine the penetration profiles 
of tirbanibulin into and through ex vivo human cadaver skin using vertical diffusion cells. The average 
cumulative amount of drug in the media after 24 hours of application was 14,451 ng and was 
comparable  across all 4 different formulations tested. The data indicated that drug permeating through 
the skin into the media, in general, starts at around 2 hours after application and appears  to plateau 
after 10 hours for most formulations. The maximum  average flux of tirbanibulin occurs between 8 and 
10 hours after application. The drug concentrations achieved in the epidermis and dermis showed that 
tirbanibulin penetrates through the different layers of the skin. 
Distribution 
The protein binding of tirbanibulin and KX2-5036 in human plasma, as determined by equilibrium 
dialysis, was approximately  88% (Study XBL17622) and 57% (Study C18092), respectively. 
Elimination 
In vitro, tirbanibulin was mainly metabolised by CYP3A4/5 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2C8 (Study 
XBL08671). 
In vitro studies, together with an in vivo radiolabelled study in rats, identified 6 primary  metabolites. 
Two metabolites were identified as possible drug-related metabolites in humans. One metabolite (KX2-
5036), a pyridine acetamide metabolite of tirbanibulin, was identified as a potentially abundant human 
metabolite because it was the most abundant metabolite in human hepatocytes. Another metabolite 
(KX2-5163), a pyridine acetic acid metabolite of tirbanibulin, was also identified because it was the 
most abundant metabolite in both rat and dog plasma.   
A metabolite scan of pooled plasma from Study KX01-AK-007 was performed to identify metabolites by 
high resolution mass spectrometry (Study C19017). The low peak intensities in the scan prevented 
structural confirmation of metabolites and suggested the metabolites identified were present at very 
low concentrations in human plasma. All metabolites were the result of dealkylation, hydrolysis, 
oxidation, and/or hydroxylation and reflected the metabolic pathways observed in the non-clinical 
studies. In addition to KX2-5036, 2 other metabolites (KX2-5180 and M477/1) were identified by the 
scan. The low peak intensity in the scan suggested that these 2 metabolites were present at very low 
concentrations in human plasma.  
The structurally confirmed human metabolites (KX2-5136, KX2-5036, and KX2-5180) were shown to 
have no or little anti-proliferative activity in a keratinocytes cell growth assay with metabolite half-
maximal  growth inhibition concentrations ≥300-fold that of tirbanibulin (Study ATNXUS-KX01-001). 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
In the maximal use study KX01-AK-007, plasma concentrations for the main metabolites KX2-5036 
and KX2-5163 were below the LLOQ (0.05 ng/mL for both metabolites) for all collected samples in 14 
and 13 of the 18 included subjects, respectively. The metabolite concentrations, which were only 
within 2-fold of the LLOQ, were inadequate for estimating PK parameters  except Cmax. 
In 3 of 4 patients who had complete Day 5 profiles with at least 1 of the 2 metabolites,  the metabolite 
concentrations were only a fraction of the parent tirbanibulin concentrations, and in the fourth patient, 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 57/144 
 
 
 
both metabolites were slightly lower than the parent concentration. The highest observed individual 
plasma concentration of tirbanibulin, KX2-5036 and KX2-5163 were 1.09 ng/mL (0.598 nM), 0.0925 
ng/mL (0.27 nM), and 0.121 ng/mL (0.35 nM), respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Study KX01-AK-01-US 
This was a Phase I, single-centre, uncontrolled, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
and PK of tirbanibulin 1% ointment following topical application to the dorsal forearm in adult patients 
with AK. 
The study enrolled 30 patients and was divided into 4 cohorts: 
• 
• 
Tirbanibulin 1% ointment, topical, 2 mg/cm2 (50 mg ointment; 0.5 mg of tirbanibulin) on a 25 
cm2 area with 4 to 8 clinically typical AK lesions on the dorsal forearm, daily for 3 consecutive 
days in Cohort 1 (n=4) and daily for 5 consecutive days in Cohort 3 (n=8). 
Tirbanibulin 1% ointment, topical, 2 mg/cm2 (200 mg ointment; 2.0 mg of tirbanibulin) on a 
100 cm2 area with 8 to 16 clinically typical AK lesions on the dorsal forearm,  daily for 3 
consecutive days in Cohort 2 (n=10) and daily for 5 consecutive days in Cohort 4 (n=8).  
Of the 30 patients enrolled, 6 (20%) had no samples with measurable tirbanibulin concentrations, and 
24 (80%) had at least 1 post-dose sample with measurable tirbanibulin concentrations. Several 
patients had intermittently elevated tirbanibulin plasma concentrations followed by low or BLQ values. 
These aberrant values may be the result of collecting PK samples from the same arm where the 
treatment was applied. Since the study protocol did not specify that samples were to be drawn from 
the opposite arm, the study site drew samples based on ease of venous access and patient preference. 
Based on these findings, the PK results were not interpretable and PK parameters  were not estimated. 
Study KX01-AK-002 
This was a Phase IIa, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled study to evaluate the activity, safety, 
and PK of tirbanibulin 1% ointment in adult patients with AK on the face or scalp. 
Study treatment consisted of topical application of tirbanibulin 1% ointment at a dose of 2 mg/cm2 (50 
mg ointment; 0.5 mg of tirbanibulin) on a 25 cm2 area with 4 to 8 clinically typical AK lesions on the 
face or scalp, once daily for 5 days (Cohort 1, n=84) or 3 days (Cohort 2, n=84). 
In Cohort 1, only 15 of 336 (4%) samples analysed had tirbanibulin plasma concentrations above the 
LLOQ on Day 1 following the initial dose. Of the pre-dose samples on Day 5, 8 of 84 (10%) patients 
had quantifiable tirbanibulin plasma concentrations. Of the 4-hour post-dose samples on Day 5, 
measurable plasma concentrations were detected in 41 of 83 (49%) patients (range: 0.108 to 0.576 
ng/mL). 
In Cohort 2, only 33 of 332 (10%) samples analysed had tirbanibulin plasma concentrations above the 
LLOQ on Day 1 following the initial dose. Of the pre-dose samples on Day 3, 14 of 84 (17%) patients 
had quantifiable tirbanibulin plasma concentrations. At 4 hours post-dose on Day 3 measurable plasma 
concentrations were detected in 45 of 83 (54%) patients (range: 0.101 to 1.420 ng/mL). 
All measurable plasma concentrations were below 1.5 ng/mL, except for 3 aberrant samples. The 
aberrant samples were re-analysed, and cross-contamination was suspected. The maximum individual 
plasma concentration (excluding the 3 aberrant values) across both cohorts and all days of PK

sampling was 1.42 ng/mL at 4 hours post-dose on Day 3. Based on the low number of patients with 
tirbanibulin concentrations above the LLOQ and amenable to PK analysis, and the fact that samples 
were only obtained up to 4 hours post-dose, PK parameters  were not determined. 
Study KX01-AK-007 (MUsT)  
This was a Phase I, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomised, parallel group, maximal  usage trial 
(MUsT) to evaluate the safety and PK of tirbanibulin 1% ointment in adults with actinic keratosis (AK) 
lesions on the face or scalp.  
Tirbanibulin 1% ointment was applied under maximal  use conditions, defined as the application of a 
small amount (total dose up to 250 mg from a single-dose unit) of ointment over 25 cm2 of the face 
(n=9) or balding scalp (n=9) that contains at least 6 AK lesions (severe conditions), once daily for 5 
consecutive days. Study treatment was self-administered once daily, using the single-dose sachet to 
mimic clinical usage. The sachets were weighed after use to determine the dose administered. 
All subjects completed 5 days of treatment. The average tirbanibulin dose applied was 137mg (45 mg), 
~55% of the full dose possible (250 mg) and the average dose applied was similar in the face and 
scalp groups. All patients had measurable but low tirbanibulin concentrations at daily trough (pre-dose) 
sampling times and post-dose sampling times on Day 5. The pre-dose concentration (Ctrough) data 
demonstrated that steady state was achieved following the third dose (72 hours) of 5 daily doses (see 
figure below). 
Daily tirbanibulin trough concentrations and Day 5 PK parameters  of maximum  observed concentration 
(Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24h) 
generated by non-compartmental analysis are summarised in the table below. All patients had peak 
concentrations lower than 0.428 ng/mL following the Day 5 dose, except for 1 patient, who had a peak 
concentration of 1.09 ng/mL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 59/144 
 
 
 
 
The terminal elimination half-life, apparent clearance, and apparent volume of distribution of 
tirbanibulin and its metabolites could not be accurately estimated or were not applicable, due to the 
low systemic exposure.  
There was a trend towards a lower Cmax and AUC0-24h on Day 5 for patients with scalp treatment 
(~49% in Cmax and ~32% in AUC) (table below). This trend remained after excluding 1 outlier 
patient. 
Dose proportionality  and time dependencies 
No data were provided. 
Special populations 
Dedicated clinical studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment  were not conducted. 
In the maximal use study (MUsT) KX01-AK-007, Intrinsic factors (gender, age and lesion counts) did 
not show an apparent effect on exposure (below figure). The effect of ethnicity was not evaluated 
because all patients were White and predominantly not Hispanic or Latino.

Pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies 
In the MUsT clinical study KX01-AK-007, the tirbanibulin Cmax was 0.258 ng/mL (0.598 nM) and the 
highest individual plasma concentration was 1.09 ng/mL (2.53 nM). Based on the observed plasma 
protein binding of tirbanibulin in human plasma of approximately  88%, the maximum  free plasma 
concentration after topical application was approximately  0.13 ng/mL. 
Considering the low estimated maximum  free plasma concentration of 0.13 ng/mL tirbanibulin after 
topical application in the MUsT clinical Study KX01-AK-007:  
• 
• 
The potential for tirbanibulin to affect concomitant medications through direct inhibition of 
CYP3A4/5 enzymes in clinical use is low, as the lowest observed IC50 value for CYP inhibition 
was 35.2 μM.  
There is no potential for tirbanibulin to affect concomitant medications through the induction of 
CYP enzymes, as tirbanibulin showed no induction potential for CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4 at a 
concentration of up to 1 μM (431.5 ng/mL).  
In the MUsT clinical study (Study KX01-AK-007), the highest observed plasma concentration for 
metabolite KX2-5036 was 0.09257 ng/mL (0.2785 nM) and the free fraction of KX2-5036 in human 
plasma at 0.01 μM was 0.45 (Study C18092). Based on the observed plasma protein binding of KX2-
5036 in human plasma of approximately  57%, the maximum free plasma concentration of KX2-5036 
following dermal application was <0.05 ng/mL. Altogether, these data indicate that KX2-5036 has no 
potential to affect concomitant medication at the level of the CYP enzymes or membrane  transporters 
at systemically achieved exposures of tirbanibulin at the proposed clinical dose regimen.

Pharmacokinetics  using human  biomaterials 
In vitro, tirbanibulin was mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2C8.  
In terms of metabolites, the DDI potential for KX2-5036 was studied in vitro.  Results showed that KX2-
5036 did not inhibit CYP enzymes directly or through TDI at 100 μM, did not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, and 
3A4 in human hepatocytes at 3 μM, and KX2-5036 was not a substrate for MDR1, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, 
MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1 and OCT2. KX2-5036 showed <50% 
inhibition on MDR1, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, MATE1, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1 at 
concentrations of up to 100 μM. 
Metabolite KX2-5163 was not tested for CYP inhibition, CYP induction, and CYP transporter potential 
because this metabolite was not found in human hepatocytes. The maximum  concentration observed in 
the MUsT PK study was 0.121 ng/mL (0.35 nM) and were lower than tirbanibulin. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of tirbanibulin involves induction of p53, and a subsequent G2/M cell cycle 
arrest, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation. In vitro, tirbanibulin has been tested in human 
keratinocytes and several melanoma cell lines. In these cells, a GI50 value of < 50 nM has been 
established, suggesting potent inhibition of cell proliferation and promotion  of apoptosis are likely to 
occur in the epidermal and dermal skin layers following topical application of tirbanibulin. 
Primary  and Secondary pharmacology 
No clinical pharmacodynamic endpoints were included in the clinical studies, and no concentration-
effect was established in non-clinical and clinical studies. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioanalytical Methods 
Certificates  of  analysis  for  reference  standards  were  provided.  A  statement  on  GLP  compliance,  in 
addition to a quality assurance regarding adherence to the study protocol and SOPs were also provided.  
In general, all validation reports provide sufficient data pertaining to the appropriateness of each method. 
Originally, method 07047 was  established using an analogue of KX2-391 as the internal standard, but 
this  was  later  changed to  an  isotopically  labelled  form  of  KX2-391  (KX2-391-d4). Ideally,  a  cross-
validation study should have been performed directly comparing the performance  of the method using 
each  internal standard  to  analysis  a  common  set  of  QC  samples.  Ultimately,  07047 was  replaced  by 
18141-M01 due to insufficient sensitivity. 
The bioanalytical assessment reports exhibit acceptable calibration curve and QC sample performance. 
Each analytical run included QC, blank and zero samples, respectively. All samples were analysed 
within the established long-term storage period.  
ISR was performed for KX2-391 during KX01-AK-01-US and KX01-AK-007, but not KX01-AK-002 due 
to the number of samples at or below the limit  of quantification (BLQ). Similarly,  ISR was not 
performed for KX2-5036 and KX2-5163. Due to the limited sensitivity of method 07047 and 19052-
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 62/144 
 
 
 
M01 to determine plasma concentrations of KX2-391, KX2-5036 and KX2-5163 in clinical samples, any 
ISR data provides no meaningful information on method reproducibility for the associated clinical 
studies.   
ISR for KX01-AK-007 was performed outside of established long-term stability for method 18141-M01 
(i.e. 252 vs 194 days), however, results were still within acceptable limits. 
Pharmacokinetics 
All clinical PK data were derived from 3 clinical pharmacology studies (KX01-AK-01-US, KX01-AK-002 
and KX01-AK-007) conducted in patients with actinic keratosis (AK) to determine tirbanibulin PK 
parameters  following topical application of tirbanibulin 1% ointment.  
Two formulations of tirbanibulin ointment were used during non-clinical and clinical development: 
Formulation I and the to-be-marketed formulation (TBM) formulation of tirbanibulin 1% ointment. 
Comparison of formulations for tirbanibulin 1% ointment was done through an assessment of in vitro 
release rates (in vitro release testing [IVRT],  detailed in Quality section) and in vitro permeability 
testing (IVPT). The in vitro skin permeability  study (TER-158-17.00) showed tirbanibulin, in a 1% 
ointment formulation, permeates into human (cadaver) skin layers, while a fraction permeates through 
the skin. 
The PK data from KX01-AK-01-US and Studies KX01-AK-002 were limited by an assay that was not 
sensitive (LLOQ: 0.1 ng/mL), and a large percentage of samples (51% to 81% after the final dose) 
with tirbanibulin plasma concentrations below the LLOQ. Both studies used an early drug product 
(Formulation I) and provided incomplete PK information. Furthermore, Study KX01-AK-01-US, enrolled 
patients with AK on the dorsal forearm,  which is not representative of the intended clinical population 
with AK on the face and scalp. Despite this, plasma exposure data indicated that tirbanibulin is 
minimally absorbed following 3 or 5 days of treatment with tirbanibulin 1% ointment. In Study KX01-
AK-002, the maximum  observed individual plasma concentration of tirbanibulin across cohorts and all 
days of PK sampling was 1.420 ng/mL. 
The maximal usage Study KX01-AK-007 was the only study that determined PK parameters  for 
tirbanibulin 1% ointment following topical application once daily for 5 consecutive days. This study 
utilised a more  sensitive assay (LLOQ: 0.01 ng/mL) and all patients’ tirbanibulin plasma  concentrations 
could be measured. Steady-state tirbanibulin plasma concentrations were reached after the third dose. 
AUC0-24h and Cmax were somewhat lower for scalp application compared with face, which could be 
due to potential difference in dermal structure of the two sites. Key PK values confirm low systemic 
exposure with subnanomolar plasma  concentrations for both parent drug and its metabolites. The 
overall mean Cmax for tirbanibulin was 0.258 ng/mL (0.598 nM), and AUC0-24h of 4.09 ng∙h/mL and 
the highest observed individual plasma concentration was 1.09 ng/mL (2.53 nM) following the final 
Day 5 treatment to the face. Large inter-subject variability was observed, which was considered to be 
mainly due to one subject with the highest concentration.  
Study KX01-AK-007 confirmed the very low plasma concentrations for metabolites KX2-5036 and KX2-
5163 after topical application of tirbanibulin 1% ointment under maximal  use conditions. 
Concentrations of the two metabolites were below the limit of quantitation in the majority of patients, 
and when measurable, were only a fraction of the parent tirbanibulin concentration in human plasma. 
Considering that after 5 elimination half-lives the amount of tirbanibulin in the body is negligible, it is 
expected that 5 days after last treatment no tirbanibulin will be available in plasma. 
In the maximal use Study KX01-AK-007, the intrinsic factors age, sex, and AK lesion count had no 
apparent effect on the PK of tirbanibulin in the small sample  size studied. It should be noted that 
participants included in this study were of an age that is comparable  with the patient population to be 
treated (range 43-83 years) and had comorbidities typical of the target population. No formal studies 
Assessment report

of tirbanibulin ointment in patients with hepatic or renal impairment  have been conducted. Due to the 
low systemic exposure to tirbanibulin after topical application of tirbanibulin ointment once daily for 5 
days, changes in hepatic or renal function are unlikely to have any effect on the elimination of 
tirbanibulin. Therefore, no dose adjustments are considered needed. 
Pharmacodynamics 
No clinical pharmacodynamic endpoints were included in the clinical studies, and no concentration-
effect was established in non-clinical and clinical studies. This is acceptable since tirbanibulin is applied 
topically and exerts its effects locally. 
The lack of a dedicated QT/QTc study was endorsed in previous Scientific Advice, since no signal arose 
either from hERG and telemetered dog non-clinical studies, nor from the completed clinical studies, 
including oral administration with tirbanibulin exposures ~100-fold higher than those following 5-days 
of topical administration. 
In the safety pharmacology evaluation of tirbanibulin, the hERG IC50 was found to be 44 uM 
(approximately  20 μg/mL), which is over 500-fold higher than the highest human plasma 
concentration observed following topical administration. The majority of the plasma  concentrations 
from the clinical trials (KX01-AK-01-US, KX01-AK-002 and KX01-US-007) were below 2 ng/mL or 
below the LLOQ. No electrocardiographic effects occurred in a nonclinical cardiovascular safety study of 
tirbanibulin up to 15 mg/kg IV in telemetered dogs. Therefore, tirbanibulin appears to have a low risk 
of QT prolongation. 
In the maximal use Study KX01-AK-007, there was no apparent association between steady-state 
Ctrough and time-matched QTcF or ΔQTcF in 18 subjects. Since the highest Ctrough was greater than 
mean Cmax, the Ctrough-QT has some value even though the ECG was not measured at Tmax. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions  on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology is considered sufficiently characterised.  
2.5.  Clinical  efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study KX01-AK-01-US: A phase 1, single-center, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic, 
study of KX2-391 ointment 1.0% in subjects with actinic keratosis 
Study KX01-AK-01-US was a single-centre, open-label, safety, tolerability,  and PK study of KX2 391 
ointment 1.0% administered topically to the dorsal forearm of subjects with AK. The study was 
conducted in 3 periods:  a screening/Baseline Period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period. A 
total of 32 subjects were planned to be enrolled; 30 subjects were enrolled and treated. 
Study population 
Eligible subjects were adults with clinically typical AK lesions on the dorsal forearm: 4 to 8 lesions in 
a contiguous area of 25 cm2 for Cohorts 1 and 3 and 8 to 16 lesions in a contiguous area of 100 
cm2 for Cohorts 2 and 4. Subjects should not have used prohibited medications including AK treatment 
or systemic immunomodulatory agents and cytotoxic agents. Women of child-bearing potential and 
men who were sexually active with female partners of childbearing potential must be using a highly 
effective method of contraception.

Treatments 
KX2-391 Ointment 1%, 50 mg (25 cm2 area) or 200 mg (100 cm2 area), once daily for 3 or 5 days, 
topically applied. 
Duration for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2: 
•  Planned subject participation period up to 73 days (up to 28 days screening period, 3 
consecutive treatment days, 42 days follow-up period) 
For Cohort 3 and Cohort 4: 
•  Planned subject participation period up to 73 days (up to 28 days screening period, 5 
consecutive treatment days, 40 days follow-up period) 
Primary Objectives: 
•  To assess the safety and tolerability of KX2-391 ointment 1.0% in subjects with actinic 
keratosis (AK) 
•  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of KX2-391 ointment 1.0% in subjects with AK 
Secondary Objective: 
To evaluate the activity of KX2-391 ointment 1.0% administered topically to the dorsal forearm in 
subjects with AK 
Study design 
This study was conducted in 4 sequential cohorts: 
•  Cohort 1: N=4, KX2-391 ointment 1%, topical, 2 mg/cm2 (50 mg of study medication; 0.5 mg 
of KX2-391) on a 25 cm2 area with 4-8 clinically typical AK lesions on the dorsal forearm, 
daily for 3 consecutive days 
•  Cohort 2: N=10, KX2-391 ointment 1%, topical, 2 mg/cm2 (200 mg of study medication; 2.0 
mg of KX2-391) on a 100 cm2 area with 8-16 clinically typical AK lesions on the dorsal 
forearm, daily for 3 consecutive days 
•  Cohort 3: N=8, KX2-391 ointment 1%, topical, 2 mg/cm2 (50 mg of study medication; 0.5 mg 
of KX2-391) on a 25 cm2 area with 4-8 clinically typical AK lesions on the dorsal forearm, 
daily for 5 consecutive days 
•  Cohort 4: N=8, KX2-391 ointment 1%, topical, 2 mg/cm2 (200 mg of study medication; 2.0 
mg of KX2-391) on a 100 cm2 area with 8-16 clinically typical AK lesions on the dorsal 
forearm, daily for 5 consecutive days 
All subjects were to be followed for 45 days (42 days post-dosing for the 3-day regimen and 40 days 
post-dosing for the 5-day regimen). 
The study database was locked on 9th August 2017. The sample size chosen for this study was based 
on practical considerations for a pilot study and was not based on power calculations. It was 
considered that 32 subjects should allow a good estimate of dermal absorption. During the study 2 
additional cohorts were added. Duration of dosing was increased from 3 to 5 days to see if further 
activity could be achieved, as in the original 3-day treatment cohorts, beneficial clinical activity had 
been noted. Of the 30 subjects enrolled and treated, 29 (97%) completed the study. Any protocol 
deviations were not considered to have affected the overall evaluation of activity or safety.

Baseline characteristics 
A total of 30 male and female adult subjects with AK were enrolled. Most subjects had a history of AK 
for >5 years. Subjects ranged in age from 47 to 79 years (median overall was 62.5 years); all but one 
were classified as white, with 19 males (63%) and 11 females (37%). Weight ranged from 100 to 305 
pounds [median 197.5 pounds, (89.58 kg)]. 
Baseline AK lesions in Cohorts 1 and 3 (25 cm2 treatment area) ranged from 4-6 lesions (median 5 and 
6 lesions, respectively) and for Cohorts 2 and 4 (100 cm2 treatment area) ranged from 8-16 (median 
11.5 and 11.0 lesions, respectively). 
One subject in cohort 2 had a concomitant medicine for AK in the study treatment area (Liquid 
nitrogen). 
Eleven (37%) subjects had a history of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), 5 subjects (17%) previously had 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 1 subject had a history of melanoma. Thirteen subjects (43%) 
had some type of surgical procedure or Mohs surgery for the treatment of BCC, SCC, and/or 
melanoma.

Study KX01-AK-002: A phase 2a, open-label, multicentre, activity and safety study of KX2-
391 ointment 1% in subjects with actinic keratosis on the face or scalp 
This Phase 2 study was a multicentre, non-randomised, open-label, activity, safety, tolerability, and PK 
study of KX2-391 ointment 1% administered topically to the face or scalp of subjects with AK in 
2 sequential cohorts: a 5-day dosing regimen (Cohort 1) and a 3-day dosing regimen (Cohort 2). 
The study consisted of screening, treatment (5 or 3 consecutive days), follow-up (up to Day 57), and 
recurrence follow-up periods (3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-Day 57). 
Study population 
The study population consisted of adults with stable, clinically typical AK.  Subjects must have had a 
treatable AK area on the face or scalp that measured 25 cm2 and contained between 4 and 8 AK 
lesions. 
Treatments 
A dose of 50 mg of KX2-391 ointment 1% was applied topically once daily for 5 consecutive days 
(Cohort 1) or for 3 consecutive days (Cohort 2) to the 25 cm2 treatment area (2 mg/cm2; 0.5 mg KX2-
391 total). No comparator  treatment was used in this study. No study treatments were administered in 
the recurrence follow-up period. 
Key objectives 
The primary  objective of this study was: 
• 
To evaluate the activity of KX2-391 Ointment 1% administered topically to the face or scalp in 
subjects with AK by determining complete response rate, defined as 100% clearance at Day 57 
One of the secondary objectives of this study was: 
• 
To assess dose regimens by contrasting 5-day treatment with 3-day treatment in terms of 
the activity and safety of KX2-391 Ointment 1% in subjects with AK on the face or scalp 
Results 
Baseline characteristics 
A total of 168 subjects (84 subjects per cohort) were enrolled into the study. Subjects were primarily 
male: 76 (90%) in Cohort 1 and 72 (86%) in Cohort 2. The age range was 45 to 90 years and 51 to 89 
years, respectively, with median ages of 70 and 67 years; 62 subjects (74%) and 53 subjects (63%) 
were aged ≥65 years. Race in all but 1 subject was classified as White.  
Per protocol, all subjects entered with a range of 4 to 8 AK lesions; the median number of lesions was 
6.0 in Cohort 1 and 5.0 in Cohort 2, with means of 5.8 and 5.4, respectively. Treatment location was 
on the face in 44 subjects (52%) in Cohort 1 and in 66 subjects (79%) in Cohort 2, and on the scalp in 
40 subjects (48%) in Cohort 1 and 18 subjects (21%) in Cohort 2. Fitzpatrick skin type was balanced 
for Cohorts 1 and 2. 98% of subjects had Classic AK.  
Prior medications were generally typical for an elderly population. There were no concomitant 
medications administered that were judged to have interfered with treatment activity.

KX2-391 was below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 0.1 ng/mL for the majority  of plasma 
samples collected. At 4 hours after the last dose, about half of the subjects in both cohorts had 
quantifiable plasma  concentrations. The maximum individual plasma concentration across both cohorts 
and all days of PK sampling did not surpass 2 ng/mL. Based on these findings and the limited number 
of plasma concentrations above the LLOQ, PK parameters  were not determined. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004 
Both Phase III studies (Studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004) were double-blind, randomised,

adults with AK on the face or scalp. These 2 studies were identical in terms of study design, patient 
entry criteria, and assessments, and were independently conducted at non-overlapping study sites. 
Enrolment was controlled so that approximately  two thirds of subjects enrolled will be treated on the 
face and approximately  one third of subjects enrolled will be treated on the scalp. A sufficient number 
of subjects will be screened to randomize approximately  300 subjects. At each site, a minimum  of 10 
subjects and a maximum of 20 subjects were projected to be enrolled. 
An overview of the study design is presented in the figure below. 
Figure 4: Study design for studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004 
The study consisted of Screening, Treatment, Response Assessment, and Recurrence Follow-up 
Periods.  
After a Screening Period of up to 28 days, subjects returned to the site for confirmation of eligibility. 
Eligible subjects were randomised on Day 1 to treatment in a 1:1 (KX2-391 Ointment 1% or Vehicle) 
ratio in each treatment area subgroup. If subjects had eligible lesions in both locations, the decision of 
which location to treat was made by the Investigator. 
The treatment area was marked with an indelible marker  at Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) at the 
investigational site. Subjects were given verbal and written instructions on self-administration of study 
drug/vehicle and a study kit containing 5 daily single-dose packets (one for each day of treatment). 
The first dose was applied by the subject under the supervision of study site personnel. Subjects then 
took home the study kit containing the remaining single-dose packets of study drug for daily self-
administration on the next 4 consecutive days.  
Subjects returned to the clinical sites for assessments at Response Assessment visits on Days 5, 8, 15, 
29, and 57. 
All subjects who had unresolved LSRs,  hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and/or scarring in the treatment 
area, or treatment-related AEs at Day 57 returned for additional follow-up, which included

standardised photography of the treatment area, every 7 to 28 days until resolved, returned to 
baseline, or considered stabilised by the Investigators. 
Subjects who achieved complete (100%) clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area at Day 57 
continued in the Recurrence Follow-up Period to determine recurrence rate and safety for up to 12 
months following the Day 57 Visit. Visits during the Recurrence Follow-up Period occurred every 3 
months. Subjects who developed AK lesions in the treatment area during the Recurrence Follow-up 
Period were discontinued at the time of recurrence.

Treatments 
Treatments Administered in Study KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004 
KX2-391 Ointment 1% was supplied in single-use packets each of which contained 250 mg of the 
ointment, equivalent to 2.5 mg of KX2-391 free base. Vehicle ointment was supplied in the same 
single-use packets each of which contained 250 mg of the ointment without the active drug. Each 
packet was for use as a single-dose application. 
Subjects were instructed to apply the study drug preferably early in the day and at approximately  the 
same time every day for a total of 5 days. The first dose was self-administered in the clinic under the 
supervision of study site personnel on Day 1; the remaining doses were self-administered on the next 
4 consecutive days at home. 
Concomitant or Prohibited Medications / Therapy: 
During the Recurrence Follow up Period sunblock and non-medications topical products could be used 
in the treatment area. Other concomitant medication used for the treatment of AEs in the treatment 
area and those that could affect the assessment of AK lesion recurrence in the treatment area were 
entered in the CRF. Any drug products or treatment that might influence or make the effect of study 
treatment up to Day 57 and during the Recurrence Follow-up Period were prohibited. Direct sun or UV 
exposure to the treatment area was to be avoided throughout the study, or if not possible from Day 15 
was acceptable with the use of a sunblock. Any subject who started systemic or topical therapy for the 
treatment of AK was withdrawn from the study. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary  objective of both studies was to evaluate the efficacy of topical KX2-391 Ointment 1% 
once daily for 5 consecutive days compared with vehicle control in terms of 100% clearance at Day 57 
in the treatment of adults with AK,  when applied to a contiguous area of 25 cm2 on the face or scalp. 
The secondary objectives of the study were: 
o  To evaluate the safety of topical KX2-391 ointment 1% once daily for 5 consecutive days in terms 
of LSRs and other safety evaluations, such as AEs and laboratory  assessments. 
o  To compare the rates of partial response defined as ≥75% clearance of AK lesions in the 
treatment area on the face or scalp at Day 57 between the KX2-391 Ointment 1%-treated group 
and vehicle-treated group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 74/144 
 
 
 
 
 
o  To determine the recurrence rate of AK in the treatment area up to 12 months post-Day 57 in 
subjects who had complete (100%) clearance at Day 57 after 5 consecutive days of treatment 
with KX2-391 Ointment 1%. 
o  To evaluate the safety of topical KX2-391 Ointment 1% within the treatment area during the 
Recurrence Follow-up Period. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint: 
The primary  endpoint was the complete (100%) clearance rate of AK lesions, defined as the proportion 
of subjects at Day 57 with no clinically visible AK lesions in the treatment area.  
The secondary endpoints: 
Key secondary endpoint: 
o  Partial clearance rate of AK lesions, defined as the proportion  of subjects at Day 57 with a ≥75% 
reduction in the number of AK lesions identified at Baseline (Day 1 predose) in the treatment area 
Additional secondary endpoint: 
o  Recurrence rate of AK lesions in subjects who achieved complete clearance at Day 57. Recurrence 
was defined as appearance of any AK lesions in the treatment area, including those recurred (i.e., 
reappearance of previously cleared lesions) or newly identified. 
Safety: 
o  Evaluation of LSRs,  pigmentation and scarring in the treatment area, AEs, SAEs, events of special 
interest, clinical laboratory  data, and other safety assessments (vital signs, physical examinations 
[PEs], electrocardiograms [ECGs]) 
o  AEs within the treatment area after Day 57 up to 12 months post-Day 57. 
Sample size 
The sample size was estimated based on the primary  efficacy endpoint, complete (100%) clearance, at 
the Day 57 visit, for the comparison of KX2-391 Ointment 1% and Vehicle control. By using a Pearson 
Chi-square method, a sample  size of 100 scalp-treated subjects and 200 face-treated subjects, both of 
which have 1:1 treatment allocation ratio, provided a >90% power to detect a 20% difference (30% 
for active treatment and 10% for vehicle control) with a 2-tailed significant level of 0.05. 
The 30% response rate for complete (100%) clearance at the Day 57 visit for active treatment was 
assumed based on unpublished results from the 5-day treatment cohort in the Phase 2 study KX01-AK-
002. 
The 10% response rate of complete (100%) clearance at Day 57 for Vehicle control was conservatively 
assumed per literature reports. 
Randomisation 
Enrollment was controlled so that approximately two-thirds of subjects enrolled were treated on the 
face and approximately  one-third of subjects enrolled were treated on on the scalp. Eligible subjects 
were randomised in a double-blinded manner to treatment in a 1:1 (KX2-391 Ointment 1% or Vehicle) 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 75/144 
 
 
 
ratio in each treatment area subgroup. Enrollment numbers and study kits were distributed 
sequentially from two lists, one for face and one for scalp. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. 
Statistical methods 
Study hypothesis:  
Treatment with KX2-391 Ointment 1% administered topically once daily for 5 consecutive days will 
demonstrate a greater complete clearance (defined as 100% clearance of clinically typical and visible 
actinic keratosis [AK] lesions at Day 57) than vehicle ointment administered topically once daily for 5 
consecutive days in adults with AK on the face or scalp. 
The analysis sets were defined as follows: 
o 
Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population: all randomised subjects. This was the primary 
efficacy population. 
o  Per-Protocol  (PP)/Evaluable Population (hereafter referred to as the PP 
population): all randomised subjects who received at least 4 of the 5 doses, conformed 
to the entry criteria in the protocol,  did not receive concomitant medications that could 
affect efficacy, and returned for the Final Visit on Day 57. 
o  Safety Population: all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study 
treatment 
Recurrence follow-up period 
o  Recurrence Follow-up Population: all subjects in the ITT Population who achieved 
complete clearance at the Day 57 visit. 
Treatment/Response Assessment Periods: Complete clearance 
The Day 57 complete (100%) clearance rate was analysed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) 
model controlling for treatment location and treatment group (primary  analysis). Before applying the 
CMH method, a Breslow-Day test with a significance level of 10% was used to explore heterogeneity of 
the odds ratios across treatment location subgroups. 
Further, the Pearson Chi Square (used to power the study) was applied to demonstrate basic 
agreement with the CMH. 
The primary  efficacy analysis was performed with the ITT population and was repeated with the 
PP/Evaluable population to support the primary  efficacy analysis results. 
Low enrolment sites were pooled to create analysis sites with approximately  20 subjects in each pool. 
Another CMH test adjusting for treatment group and analysis site (secondary analysis) was performed 
to ensure concordance with the primary  efficacy endpoint analyses described above (data not shown). 
To explore heterogeneity of the odds ratios across analysis sites, the Breslow-Day test at a significance 
level of 10% was applied. A finding of statistical significance in this test was followed by exploratory 
analyses to identify outlier study sites. 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 76/144 
 
 
 
The outlier sites were discussed and an exploratory analysis excluding the outlier sites could be carried 
out to estimate the impact of site-by-treatment interactions.  
Complete (100%) clearance and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI) at each analysis site or at 
each study site were also provided. 
Treatment/Response Assessment Periods: Partial clearance 
To control for multiplicity, the partial (≥75%) clearance rate was examined using a step-down 
gatekeeping testing strategy for the overall type I error  rate, i.e., the primary  endpoint served as a 
gatekeeper for the key secondary endpoint. The complete (100%) clearance rate was tested initially; 
if, and only if it was statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level, then the partial (≥75%) 
clearance rate was statistically tested at the same significance level. 
Recurrence Follow-up Period 
Recurrence was defined as appearance of any AK lesions in the treatment area, including those 
recurred (i.e., reappearance of previously cleared lesions) or newly identified. Recurrence rates were 
estimated based on a Kaplan-Meier method at each post-Day 57 analysis visit. Subjects with missing 
AK assessments in the Recurrence Follow-up Period were considered as censored at their last AK 
assessment. 
A Kaplan-Meier plot was created for the recurrence rate in the KX2-391 Ointment 1% group. 
The number of subjects at risk, the number of subjects with recurrence, and the number of censored 
subjects were presented at each analysis visit by treatment location in the KX2-391 Ointment 1% 
group. 
Listing of subject status for the Kaplan-Meier analysis in the Recurrence Follow-up Period was 
provided. 
Missing data were not imputed. Subjects with missing AK lesion assessments due to early termination 
were considered as censored on the analysis visit at which they discontinued. 
Treatment/Response Assessment Periods: AK Lesion Count 
The number of AK lesions and the change from baseline in lesion count at each visit were summarised 
using descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and maximum)  by 
treatment location (face or scalp) and treatment group for the ITT population and the PP population. T-
test-based statistical comparisons of change from baseline between the 2 treatment groups at each 
visit were performed. 
In addition, line plots were provided to present mean (± standard error) of AK lesion count by 
treatment group and treatment location at each visit. T-test-based statistical comparisons of AK lesion 
counts between the 2 treatment groups at each visit were performed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 77/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subgroup Analysis 
To indicate concordance with the overall results, the primary  and the key secondary efficacy endpoints 
were tabulated and displayed graphically in subgroups such as treatment location (face or scalp), 
gender, age (<65 or ≥65 years), baseline AK lesion count (4, 5, 6 or 7, 8), skin type (Fitzpatrick I/II 
or III/IV/V/VI). 
A Clopper-Pearson Exact 95% CI was provided for each estimation, but no statistical test was 
performed between subgroups. 
Missing Data 
For the primary  and the key secondary efficacy endpoint analyses, the subjects who discontinued prior 
to Day 57 visit will be considered as non-responders. Due to extremely low number of subjects who 
discontinued prior to Day 57 visit, no sensitivity analyses for the primary  and the key secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be performed. 
Changes to the Planned Analyses Before Treatment Unblinding: 
In the SAP v2.0 that was signed off after the Blind Data Review Meeting but before database lock, the 
Sponsor made the following changes to the planned analyses as only 2 of the 351 subjects 
discontinued from the study. No other analyses were changed.

The original protocol was approved on 29 Jun 2017. There was 1 protocol amendment on 18 Feb 2018. 
The amendment was submitted to the IRB  for approval in accordance with local requirements. 
The changes covered a revision how lesions would be counted during the Recurrence Follow-up Period 
to include any lesion within the treatment area and not lesions completely in the treatment area, in 
order to address concern regarding possible underestimation of recurrence, and some clarifications 
regarding the statistical analysis. A summary  of important changes instituted is provided below: 
Protocol deviations 
Study KX01-AK-003 
Most deviations were related to visits/study assessments that occurred outside the allowed time 
window or visits that were missed or improperly  performed. 
Three subjects had used prohibited medication/therapies within 4 weeks of Screening (Exclusion 
Criterion 7) and were randomised and then dosed by study sites in error  and were recorded as protocol 
deviations. 
These 3 subjects were not displayed in the Listing of Screening Failure Subjects. 
They were included in the ITT and the Safety populations for analysis but were excluded from the PP 
population. 
Twenty subjects (including the 3 subjects mentioned above) were excluded from the PP analysis for 
various protocol deviations.  
Study KX01-AK-004 
Most deviations were related to visits/study assessments that occurred outside the allowed time 
window, visits/study procedures that were missed or improperly  performed, subjects who received a 
prohibited medication/therapy, or noncompliance with study drug or application instructions.

For study KX01-AK-003 the number of lesions was similar between the 2 treatment groups, with 
most subjects having 5 (108 subjects [31%]) or 6 (80 subjects [23%]) lesions in the treatment area. 
In study KX01-AK-004 the number of lesions was similar between the 2 treatment groups, with most 
subjects having 5 (107 subjects [30%]) or 6 (90 subjects [26%]) lesions in the treatment area.  
Similar  proportion of subjects in each treatment group had previous AK treatment KX01-AK-003 
(87% and 83% for Vehicle and KX2-391 Ointment 1%, respectively); KX01-AK-004: 72% and 74% 
for Vehicle and KX2-391 Ointment 1%, respectively). 
34% and 36% (overall) of patients had prior  field treatment KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004 
respectively.  
Previous AK treatments in KX01-AK-003 were predominantly localised, e.g., cryotherapy; 75% and 
74% for Vehicle and KX2-391 Ointment 1%, respectively. For KX01-AK-0034 they were recorded as 
67% and 63% for Vehicle and KX2-391 Ointment 1%, respectively. 
Many enrolled subjects ( [47%] KX01-AK-003 and [42%] KX01-AK-004) had a history of skin 
cancer (KX01-AK-003 ; 105 had SCCs, 124 had BCCs, and 24 had melanomas: KX01-AK-004 ; 79 
had SCCs, 110 had BCCs, and 15 had melanomas).  
They were similarly distributed between the 2 treatment groups: KX01-AK-003 : 89 (51%) in Vehicle 
and 77 (44%) in KX2-391 Ointment 1%.), KX01-AK-004: 72 (42%) in Vehicle and 75 (42%) in KX2-
391 Ointment 1%. 
Both studies had reported similar  medical conditions among subjects, 96% and 98% KX01-AK-003 
and 99% and 97% KX01-AK-004 of subjects in the Vehicle and KX2-391 Ointment 1% groups, 
respectively. These conditions are common in an elderly population and occurred in similar proportions 
of subjects in the 2 groups, e.g., surgical and medical procedures, neoplasms metabolic and 
nutritional, vascular, musculoskeletal and connective tissue, gastrointestinal, and immune system 
disorders. 
Approximately  89% (KX01-AK-003) to 92% (KX01-AK-004) of subjects in each treatment group 
received at least 1 concomitant medication. The most prevalent medications given to ≥15% of subjects 
in each group were acetylsalicylic acid, simvastatin, multivitamin, atorvastatin, Lisinopril  metformin, 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021

and omeprazole.  These concomitant medications were given for medical conditions typical for this age 
group. 
Compliance to the 5-day self-application treatment regimen was >99%. All but 1 subject in both 
studies received the planned 5 daily doses. Subject 313-501 (KX2-391 Ointment 1%) stopped 
treatment after Day 3 because of a traumatic wound in the treatment area (scalp) which was unrelated 
to study treatment. Subject 412-502 (KX2-391 Ointment 1%) missed the Day 5 dose but completed 
the study through Day 57.

Outcomes  and estimation 
Primary and key secondary endpoint 
Study KX01-AK-003 
The KX2-391 Ointment 1% group had significantly higher (p<0.0001) complete (100%) clearance than 
the Vehicle group (overall,  44% versus 5%, respectively). In addition, significantly higher rates of 
complete (100%) clearance for KX2-391 Ointment 1% were observed when the face (p<0.0001 versus 
Vehicle) and scalp (p<0.0001 versus Vehicle) subgroups were analysed separately.

(primary analysis) 
Clearance Rates at Day 57 by Treatment Location and Treatment Group ‒ PP Population 
For the primary  endpoint (complete [100%] clearance at the Day 57 Visit), the p-values of the 
Breslow-Day test were not significant (p>0.1) in either the ITT population or the PP population for the 
CMH analysis adjusting for analysis sites.  
For the secondary endpoint (partial [75%] clearance at the Day 57 visit), the p-values of the Breslow-
Day test were significant (p<0.1) in both the ITT population and the PP population for the CMH

analysis adjusting for analysis sites. To evaluate the heterogeneity indicated across analysis sites, the 
difference of partial  (≥75%) clearance rate at Day 57 between the 2 treatment groups was calculated 
and then the analysis sites were sorted by this difference. For both the ITT and PP populations, KX2-
391 ointment 1% was favoured over vehicle at all analysis sites with a ≥40% difference for 13 of the 
17 analysis sites. Consistency was demonstrated across all analysis sites. 
Additional secondary endpoint 
Recurrence rate of AK lesions - FOLLOW-UP PERIOD 
Subjects who did not return for follow-up were censored. This occurred for 4 subjects in Study KX01-
AK-003 who had KX2-391 Ointment 1% treatment on the face (1 was lost to follow-up and 3 withdrew 
consent) and 1 subject in the Vehicle group (withdrew consent). 1 patient in Study KX01-AK-004 
withdrew consent. 
In study KX01-AK-003 at 12 months post-Day 57, 18 KX2-391 Ointment 1%-treated subjects (23%) 
had not developed recurrent AK lesions in the treatment area – 16/60 (26%) who received treatment 
on the face and 2/17 (12%) who received treatment on the scalp. 
In study KX01-AK-004 27 KX2-391 Ointment 1%-treated subjects (28%) had not developed 
recurrent AK lesions in the treatment area – 23/73 (31%) who received treatment on the face and

This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-
group  study to  evaluate  the  efficacy and  safety  of  KX2-391  Ointment  1% 
administered  topically  to  the  face  or  scalp  of  adult  subjects  with  actinic 
keratosis. 
Enrolment was controlled so that approximately  two-thirds of subjects 
enrolled were treated on the face and approximately  one-third of subjects 
enrolled were treated on the scalp. 
The  study consisted of Screening,  Treatment,  Response  Assessment  (up  to 
Day  57),  and  Recurrence  Follow-up  Periods.  After  Screening,  subjects 
returned  to  the  site  for  confirmation  of  eligibility.    Eligible  subjects  were 
randomised to treatment on Day 1 in a 1:1 (KX2-391 Ointment 1% or vehicle) 
ratio  in  each  treatment  area  subgroup.  Subjects  who  achieved  100% 
clearance  of  AK  lesions  in  the  treatment  area  at  Day  57  continued in  the 
recurrence Follow up period to determine recurrence rate and safety at visits 
every 3 months for up to 12 months. 
Duration of main phase: 
57 days 
Duration of Run-in phase: 
28 days 
Duration of Extension phase:  12 months post-Day 57, only for subjects 
with complete clearance at Day 57 
(Recurrence follow-up phase).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled  analyses and meta-analysis) 
The results of a post-hoc pooled efficacy analysis were submitted. This analysis was done with the 
pooled ITT Populations of the identical Phase III pivotal Studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004. 
The purpose of this pooling was to provide a more precise estimate of the overall treatment effect. The 
same statistical methodology as in the individual trials was used for the pooling, adding ‘trial factor’ in 
the statistical models to account for possible variability across trials. Therefore, the primary  and key

across trials. 
Sensitivity analyses done in each individual trial were also replicated with the pooled data adding ‘trial 
factor’ in all statistical models. Furthermore, subgroup analyses for the pooled data (treatment 
location, gender, age, Fitzpatrick skin type, and number of AK baseline lesions) were done using CMH. 
The Breslow-Day method was used to test heterogeneity across trials. Missing values were treated 
exactly the same way as in each individual trial (considered NR).  Changes from baseline in AK lesions 
count were analysed by means of descriptive statistics for the pooled data, similar  to the approach 
used in each individual trial.  For the 1-year Recurrence Follow-up Period, the pooled recurrence rate 
and sustained clearance was estimated using KM estimates on the pooled data. A Cox model was 
performed to test the statistical significance of the trial factor. 
In addition, a sensitivity estimand approach up to Day 57 similar  to the one done for the individual 
Phase III pivotal studies was done on the pooling of the Phase III studies. Missing data were imputed 
as NR and the results were entered to NR for all patients who took prohibited medication before Day 
57, from the time they took their first prohibited medication onwards. Due to the low number of 
missing observations and given that most of the patients taking prohibited medication before Day 57 
were already NR, the difference between the main pooled analysis and the post-hoc estimand analysis 
was minimal.   
Results are presented in the tables below.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The outcomes from Study KX01-AK-01-US indicated that the most promising dose was that applied to 
Cohort 3 subjects (25 cm2 treatment area/5 consecutive treatment days). The data also imply that 
treatment of a smaller body surface area (e.g. 25cm2) which contains fewer AK lesions might be more 
efficacious than treating a larger area. The results of this Phase 1 study inform on the rationale for 
design of the subsequent Phase 2 and 3 studies. The 25 cm2 treatment area was chosen for use in the 
Phase IIa study to further determine the better treatment duration and select the dose to be used in 
the pivotal Phase III studies. In both cohorts of Study KX01-AK-01-US, a decrease from baseline in AK 
lesion counts was noted by Day 15. Even with small numbers, consistency among subgroups was 
noted. By Day 29, lesion counts for each cohort showed meaningful reductions from baseline that 
continued up to Day 57. 
Study KX01-AK-002 was a non-randomised, open label study of tirbanibulin administered topically to 
the face or scalp of subjects for either 5 or 3 consecutive days. The 5-day treatment regimen had a 
higher percentage of subjects with 100% clearance at Day 57 compared with the 3-day regimen (43% 
vs 32%, respectively). Most but not all of the recurrence happened within the first 6 months of post-
Day 57 follow-up. More subjects with AK lesions on the face in the 5 day cohort (60%) had maintained 
100% clearance than those in the 3 day cohort (27%), while subjects with AK lesions on the scalp had 
high recurrence rates in both cohorts (85% and 62%, respectively). Most subgroups had too few 
subjects to provide meaningful interpretation of results regarding the effect of subgroup on complete 
clearance rate. This small Phase II study supports the trial of tirbanibulin for 5 consecutive days in the 
Phase III studies. 
The 2 pivotal efficacy Studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004 were identical double-blind, randomised, 
vehicle-controlled, multi-centre Phase III  studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of tirbanibulin 
1% ointment when applied once daily to a treatment area of 25 cm2 for 5 consecutive days in adults 
with AK on the face or scalp. These 2 studies were identical in terms of study design, patient entry 
criteria, and assessments, and were independently conducted at non-overlapping study sites. 
These studies were conducted only in the US however it is agreed that the condition should not be 
different in the EU. Furthermore, the studies were placebo (Vehicle) controlled, therefore influence of 
different treatments is not an issue. 
The applicant did not include an active-control study design. They reported that this was because they 
had already started the clinical trials before seeking CHMP advice and there was no gold standard for 
the evaluation of efficacy in AK. The applicant argued that there was no standard of care for AK 
treatment in the EU. However, there were several treatments licensed in the EU including similar 
topical treatments which would have been beneficial to contextualise the efficacy of this proposed 
product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 109/144 
 
 
 
 
Both studies were sufficiently powered to assess complete clearance, combining face and scalp lesions.  
Patients enrolled had AK lesions on the face or scalp over contiguous area of 25 cm2 containing 4 to 8 
stable AK lesions. The lesions were not histologically confirmed, diagnosis was clinical and there was 
no efficacy assessment in other anatomical areas. The distribution was in accordance with planned 
subject enrolment. 
Eligible patients were not allowed to have clinically atypical and/or rapidly changing AK lesions in the 
treatment area, and they were not allowed to use prohibited medicines, including AK treatment or 
systemic immunomodulatory agents and cytotoxic drugs. Approximately  two-thirds of patients were 
enrolled in the face treatment subgroup and one-third in the scalp treatment subgroup. Overall the 
enrolled population is accepted and appears to have been well balanced between the arms.  Patients 
enrolled were exclusively white, 84% to 90% of patients were male and 90% to 98% of patients had 
Fitzpatrick skin phototype I, II, or III.  the efficacy was studied in non-hyperkeratotic lesions (Olsen 
grade 1) and there is no data with use in patients in hyperkeratotic lesions (Olsen 2 or 3). The 
indication in 4.1 of the SmPC was revised to reflect this. 
Patients received topical treatment for 5 days followed by efficacy and safety assessments up to Day 
57 and a 1-year Recurrence Follow-up Period. There was no retreatment of lesions for patients who 
had an incomplete response or those which recurred following initial clearance. There are no available 
data on retreatment with tirbanibulin in patients who had a recurrence of their AK lesions, or on those 
who developed new lesions. Therefore, it is unclear whether recurrent lesions would respond similarly 
to what was observed in the pivotal studies. Since there are no data on retreatment, it was reflected in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC that if recurrence occurs, or new lesions develop within the treatment area, 
other treatment options should be considered. Administration is restricted to single use. Efficacy on re-
treatment will be investigated in the imposed PASS study which will also review AK histological 
progression to in situ or invasive SCC following treatment over a 3-year period. 
A dermatologist (investigator or Sub investigator) performed a count of clinically visible AK lesions 
(lesion count) for all subjects at Response Assessment visits on Days 8, 15, 29, and 57. The same 
investigator or Sub investigator conducted the lesion count at all visits for an individual subject. 
The investigator or sub investigator could use the transparency and/or photograph from baseline to 
locate the treatment area. Actinic keratosis lesion counts from previous visits were not to be used to 
assist in the assessment of AK lesion count at the current visit. Only AK lesions completely within the 
25 cm2 treatment area were to be counted. 
The primary  endpoint of complete clearance (100% reduction from Baseline of AK lesions in the 
treatment area) at Day 57, is considered stringent and clinically meaningful in the treatment of AK. 
A key secondary endpoint was partial clearance (≥75% reduction from Baseline of AK lesions in the 
treatment area) at Day 57, which is less clinically meaningful but still shows a degree of benefit. Total 
lesion count was also measured. Overall, the chosen endpoints are supported. 
In line with CHMP scientific advice a sensitivity estimand approach up to Day 57 was used, comprising 
the same analysis as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan, but taking into account the inter-current 
events. 
Pooled analyses for primary  and key secondary efficacy endpoints (complete and partial  clearance 
rates at Day 57), reduction in AK lesion count up to Day 57, and sustained clearance rates were 
conducted with the pooled ITT Populations of the identical Phase III studies. 
Additionally, subgroup analyses for the pooled primary  efficacy data to assess treatment location (face 
and scalp), sex, age (<65 and >65 years), Fitzpatrick skin phototype (I/II and III/IV/V/VI),  and 
Assessment report

baseline AK lesion count (4 to 6 and 7 to 8 lesions) were done using CMH. The Breslow-Day method 
was used to test heterogeneity across studies. 
There was one protocol  amendment in both pivotal studies which involved a revised lesion count in the 
recurrence follow up period to indicate that lesions ‘within the treatment area’ are to be counted, 
previously the lesions ‘must be completely within the treatment area’. This led to a more conservative 
estimation of the recurrence rate, including also those actinic keratosis lesions partially inside the 
treatment area.  
Efficacy data and additional  analyses 
Overall, the key findings from the proof-of-concept Phase I Study (KX01-AK-01-US) and Phase IIa 
(Study KX01-AK-002) helped to determine and support the use of a 5 day once-daily regimen in the 
Phase III trials. 
Both pivotal studies (KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004) met the primary  endpoint for complete 
clearance with statistically significant results for treatment versus placebo for both face and scalp and 
for each location separately. 
Pivotal study KX01-AK-003 showed a difference in complete clearance of 39%, 44% and 28% in favour 
of tirbanibulin in the overall treatment field (face + scalp), the face and the scalp respectively. In study 
KX01-AK-004 the corresponding values were an improvement  in complete clearance of 41%, 47% and 
30% in the overall treatment field (face + scalp), the face and the scalp respectively. 
Pooled analysis with the pooled ITT populations of the two studies showed a 40% improvement in 
favour of tirbanibulin for complete clearance and 54% improvement for partial clearance, both 
statistically significant (p<0.0001). A consistent effect was seen between both studies and between ITT 
and PP analysis. A lower effect was observed with scalp lesions versus facial ones (29% versus 46%, 
ITT analysis). 
The overall mean reduction in AK lesion count and the mean reduction in AK lesion count to day 57 on 
the face or scalp with tirbanibulin 1% ointment treatment were statistically significantly greater 
compared with vehicle treatment at all-time points assessed.  
In the efficacy pooling, the median percent reduction from baseline (median baseline lesion count: 6) 
at Day 57 was 87.5% in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment group and 20.0% in the vehicle group.  
Both studies had a recurrence follow up period. There was a steady recurrence of lesions in the follow 
up period over time, which was similar  between both studies, although the rate of recurrence was 
higher on the scalp compared to the face. In study KX01-AK-003 at 12 months post-Day 57, 16 
patients among 60 (26%) who received treatment on the face and 2 patients among 17 (12%) who 
received treatment on the scalp had a recurrence. In study KX01-AK-004, 23 of 73 (31%) patients 
who received treatment on the face and 4 of 24 (17%) patients who received treatment on the scalp 
recurred. In the pooled analyses of the 2 Phase III studies: 70% of patients up to 3 months, 49% up 
to 6 months, 34% up to 9 months, and 27% up to 12 months showed sustained clearance, showing a 
gradual loss of effect over time. 
The applicant’s clinical development programme  was generally in line with CHMP advice. CHMP had 
recommended the applicant to gather additional long-term safety data (up to 3 years) and to 
determine the related conversion rate of AK lesions to SCC or BCC. However, it could be accepted that 
longer-term data are provided post-approval. 
The applicant will conduct a Phase IV,  long-term, randomised, active-controlled, investigator-blinded, 
safety and re-treatment study (M-14789-41) in adult patients with AK on the face or scalp (see RMP, 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 111/144 
 
 
 
PASS category 1 study). The draft protocol was submitted and is broadly acceptable. The study 
objectives are to determine the incidence of AK progression to SCC after treatment with tirbanibulin 
1% ointment, and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of re-treatment. This long-term study is in the 
planning phase and will be conducted in EU countries and Russia. In contrast to the completed Phase 
IIa and Phase III studies, patients will be re-treated with tirbanibulin 1% ointment (up to 4 treatment 
cycles per year), if necessary. The protocol will be submitted for approval. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions  on the clinical efficacy 
Overall the observed improvement  in complete and partial clearance rates with Klisyri is considered 
clinically relevant for single period of 5-day use on the scalp and head. The use of this product is 
restricted to single use treatment 5 days to a maximal area of 25 cm2. 
2.6.  Clinical  safety 
The clinical development programme  for topical tirbanibulin 1% ointment for the treatment of AK 
included a total of 9 clinical studies. Safety results from 2 Phase III Studies, KX01-AK-003 and KX01-
AK-004, and the Phase IIa Study KX01-AK-002 form the basis for this MAA. Key results from the Phase 
I studies in patients with AK (Studies KX01-AK-01-US and KX01-AK-007) and in healthy subjects 
(Studies KX01-AK-006, KX01-AK-008, KX01-AK-009, and KX01-AK-010) are also presented at the end 
of the section. 
Patient  exposure 
Pivotal Phase III Studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004 
Pooling 
The 2 pivotal Phase III Studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004 were identical in terms of objectives, 
study design, patient population, safety assessments, and safety endpoints. Both studies evaluated the 
safety of the proposed treatment regimen, tirbanibulin 1% ointment once daily for 5 consecutive days, 
in adult patients with AK on the face or scalp, with a 1-year safety follow-up.  
Therefore, an integrated analysis of safety was performed based on pooled data from all evaluable 
patients in these 2 studies to maximise exposure information and to assess overall safety of the 
proposed dose regimen of tirbanibulin in patients with AK. 
The pooled data for tirbanibulin 1% ointment was compared with pooled data for the vehicle control. 
For reference, the safety data for each individual Phase III study are presented alongside the pooled 
safety data as well as the individual safety data of the Phase IIa Study KX01-AK-002.  
Due to differences in treatment duration, treatment location, treatment area, and study population, the 
safety results in the Phase IIa and Phase I studies in patients (KX01-AK-002, KX01-AK-01-US, and 
KX01-AK-007) and the dermal safety studies in healthy subjects (KX01-AK-006, KX01-AK-008, KX01-
AK-009, and KX01-AK-010) were not pooled, but are presented separately.

* The Recurrence  Follow-up Population In Studies KX01-AK-003, KX01-AK-004, and KX01-AK-002 with a 12-
month Safety Follow-up, was  defined as all patients in the ITT Population who achieved  complete clearance 
at the Day 57 visit. 
A total of 1310 patients/subjects have been enrolled and treated in 9 clinical studies for the evaluation 
of tirbanibulin 1% ointment in the treatment of AK: 2 Phase III studies, 1 Phase IIa study, 2 Phase I 
studies in patients with AK,  and 4 Phase I studies in healthy subjects. Of the 1310 patients/subjects, 
961 (569 patients with AK and 392 healthy subjects) received the active treatment tirbanibulin and 
349 received vehicle ointment. When types of studies were considered, 1094 patients/subjects were 
enrolled in double-blind or evaluator-blind studies and 216 were enrolled in open-label studies. Of the 
569 patients, 455 patients received the proposed treatment regimen, tirbanibulin 1% ointment applied 
to the face or scalp once daily for 5 consecutive days and 84 patients for 3 days; and the remaining 30 
patients received tirbanibulin 1% ointment on the dorsal forearm, up to an area of 100 cm2 and up to 
once daily for 5 consecutive days. 
Adverse events 
Common AEs 
Safety assessment up to Day 57:  
The most common TEAEs (PTs) across Studies KX01-AK-003, KX01-AK-004, and KX01-AK-002 were 
the following:  
•  Application site pain: 4% to 13% of patients across the tirbanibulin 1% ointment groups, and 
3% of patients in each of the vehicle groups.  
•  Application site pruritus: 7% to 11% of patients across the tirbanibulin 1% ointment groups, 
and 5% to 8% of patients in the vehicle groups.  
•  Upper respiratory  tract infection: 3% to 4% of patients across the tirbanibulin 1% ointment 
groups, and 4% to 6% of patients in the vehicle groups.  
No other specific TEAE was reported by more  than 5% of patients across Studies KX01-AK-003, KX01-
AK-004, and KX01-AK-002.  
The incidence of application site AEs (pruritus and pain) were higher in the pooled tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment group (9% and 10% patients, respectively) than in the pooled vehicle group (6% and 3% 
patients, respectively). These application site AEs were all considered to be related to study treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 113/144 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of upper respiratory tract infection was similar  between both the pooled tirbanibulin (4% 
patients) and pooled vehicle groups (5% patients), and the incidence of viral respiratory  tract infection 
was similar  for the 2 pooled treatment groups (3% patients each).  
Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events up to Day 57 Occurring in ≥2% of Patients in any 
Treatment Group – Phase III Patient Studies: KX01-AK-003, KX01-AK-004 (Pooled and by Study) and 
Phase II Patient Study: KX01-AK-002 (Safety Population) 
Recurrence Follow-up Period:  
During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, a few TEAEs were reported in no more than 1 patient across 
the studies in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment group. No TEAEs were reported across the studies in the 
vehicle group. Two patients in Study KX01-AK-004 had 1 TEAE each (BCC [outside the treatment area] 
and colon cancer, both unrelated to study treatment and not serious). In Study KX01-AK-002, 1 
patient had a severe serious TEAE of cerebrovascular accident which resolved with sequelae and was 
not considered related to treatment. 
Treatment-Related AEs 
Safety assessment up to Day 57:  
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 114/144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most common treatment-related TEAEs (PTs) across Studies KX01-AK-003, KX01-AK-004, and 
KX01-AK-002 were the following:  
•  Application site pain: 4% to 13% of patients across the tirbanibulin 1% ointment groups, and 
3% of patients in each of the vehicle groups.  
•  Application site pruritus: 6% to 11% of patients across the tirbanibulin 1% ointment groups, 
and 5% to 8% of patients in the vehicle groups.  
No other specific treatment-related TEAE was reported by more than 2 patients across Studies KX01-
AK-003, KX01-AK-004, and KX01-AK-002.  
The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs of application site pruritus and pain were higher in the 
pooled tirbanibulin 1% ointment group (9% and 10% patients, respectively) than in the pooled vehicle 
group (6% and 3% patients, respectively). 
Recurrence Follow-up Period:  
None of the TEAEs reported during the Recurrence Follow-up Period were treatment-related across the 
studies in the tirbanibulin 5-day dosing groups. 
Severity 
Safety assessment up to Day 57:  
The majority of TEAEs across Studies KX01-AK-003, KX01-AK-004, and KX01-AK-002 were of mild or 
moderate severity and the frequency of severe TEAEs was low.  
Severe TEAEs across Studies KX01-AK-003, KX01-AK-004 (pooled analysis) were reported in 3 
patients in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment group and 7 patients in the vehicle group, and in KX01-AK-
002 from 1 patient. Of these severe TEAEs, only application site pruritus (tirbanibulin 1% ointment 
group in Study KX01-AK-003) was considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment, and 
the event was not serious and resolved.  
Among the patients with treatment-related TEAEs in tirbanibulin 1% ointment group, 1 (<1%) patient 
had severe treatment-related AEs (application site pruritus), 12 (3%) patients had moderate 
treatment-related AEs (the events of moderate severity included application site pruritus, application 
site pain, headache, application site nodule, application site scab, skin odour abnormal,  and viral upper 
respiratory  tract infection), and the remaining 43 (12%) patients had treatment-related AEs of mild 
severity. With the exception of 1 AE of moderate severity (application site pain), all treatment-related 
AEs in the vehicle group were of mild in severity. All treatment-related AEs resolved. No patient 
discontinued treatment due to treatment-related AEs.  
Recurrence Follow-up Period:  
During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, severe TEAEs were reported in 3 patients across the studies in 
the tirbanibulin 1% ointment group:  
• 
• 
• 
In Study KX01-AK-003, 1 patient had 3 severe and serious TEAEs of sepsis, hairy cell 
leukaemia, haemoglobin decreased; none were treatment-related and all resolved except the 
AE of hairy cell leukaemia. 
In Study KX01-AK-004, 1 patient had colon cancer, which was not serious, not treatment-
related, and which resolved.  
In Study KX01-AK-002, 1 patient had a severe serious TEAE of cerebrovascular accident, which 
was not treatment-related, and which resolved with sequelae on Day 350. The patient was 
discontinued from the study on Day 415 because of the clinically significant AE.

Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Skin Cancer  
Medical History of Skin Cancer  
In the Phase III Studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004, a large proportion  of patients had a history 
of skin cancer (47% [166 of 351 patients] and 42% [147 of 351 patients], respectively). Patients with 
a history of skin cancer were similarly distributed between the tirbanibulin 1% ointment and vehicle 
groups in each of the Phase III studies. The most common types of skin cancer in the medical history 
of patients in the Phase III  studies included BCC, SCC, and melanoma. 
A tabulated patient listing of treatment-emergent skin cancers (i.e.,  skin cancers with start date after 
the start of study treatment) reported in Studies KX01-AK-003, KX01-AK-004 is provided in the table 
below.  
No skin cancers were reported in Study KX01-AK-007 or the Phase I dermal safety studies in healthy 
subjects. Except for 1 skin cancer, all of the 23 treatment-emergent skin cancers in 19 patients 
occurred outside the treatment area.  None of the treatment-emergent skin cancers were related to 
study treatment. The occurrence of treatment-emergent skin cancers was similar between the 
tirbanibulin 1% ointment and vehicle groups for the 2 Phase III  studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021

The table below provides a tabulation of subjects with treatment-emergent skin cancers reported in 
Studies KX01-AK-002 and KX01-AK-01-US. In Study KX01-AK-002, 1 subject in Cohort 1 (5-day 
treatment) and 2 subjects in Cohort 2 (3-day treatment) developed skin cancer during the study. In 
Study KX01-AK-01-US, 1 subject in Cohort 4 (5-day 100cm2 treatment area) developed BCC. In all 
subjects, the treatment-emergent skin cancer occurred outside the treatment area. None of the skin 
cancers were considered to be related to study drug. 
Ocular Exposure  
No cases of ocular exposure to tirbanibulin 1% ointment or vehicle were reported across all studies in 
patients with AK or healthy subjects. None of the 6 ocular TEAEs reported during the Phase III and IIa 
studies were related to study treatment, and all resolved. 
Overdose  
Overdose happened in 1 study of the clinical programme  for safety.  
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 117/144 
 
 
 
 
 
One patient in the 5-day treatment group of Study KX01-AK-002 received 10 times the protocol-
specified dose (500 mg tirbanibulin 1% ointment) for each of the 5 applications received but did not 
experience TEAEs or LSRs of higher incidence or severity than patients who received the protocol-
specified dose of 50 mg per application. The patient completed the Treatment Period and had his last 
dose of study treatment on Day 5 after 5 days of dosing. The patient had complete clearance at Day 
57 and entered the Recurrence Follow-up Period. The patient discontinued from the study on Day 240 
due to AK recurrence. Another 2 patients also had an overdose in the 3-day dosing group in Study 
KX01-AK-002.  
Pregnancy 
One pregnancy occurred during the clinical development programme  (Study KX01-AK-006) and no 
pregnancies reported in the phase 2 or phase 3 trials. There are no data on excretion of 
tirbanibulin/metabolites in human or animal milk.  The effects of tirbanibulin on the breastfed infant, or 
its effects on milk production, are unknown. 
Local Skin Reactions  
Local tolerability was assessed by evaluating the following signs: erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, 
swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration, which were referred to as LSRs.   For the 
Phase III Studies and the Phase II study, evaluations of LSRs, pigmentation, and scarring were 
conducted during the Treatment and Follow-up Periods only, not during Recurrence Follow-up.

Local tolerability signs were graded using a 4-point scale: absent (0), mild (1), moderate (2), and 
severe (3) and referred to as LSRs in Studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004.  
At baseline, both treatment groups were well matched for the presence of LSRs,  primarily  consisting of 
mild erythema (23% to 24% patients) or flaking/scaling (27% to 29% patients) at the treatment site.  
Following treatment, LSRs were transient in both treatment groups but were more  frequent in the 
tirbanibulin 1% ointment group compared with vehicle. The difference in incidence of LSRs were more 
pronounced for the moderate to severe category across the 2 treatment groups, though severe LSRs 
were overall infrequent. LSRs peaked by Day 8 and, by Day 29, all signs were at or close to their 
baselines in both incidence and severity.  
Erythema and flaking/scaling were frequently observed and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. 
LSRs of crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration occurred less frequently, 
and were generally mild. Severe LSRs were infrequent among patients treated with tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment. The highest incidence of severe LSRs was flaking/scaling at Day 8 (27 patients, 8%), 
erythema at Day 8 (14 patients, 4%) and at Day 5 (10 patients, 3%); all other signs occurred in <1% 
to 2% of patients. The severe LSR of flaking was reported in 1 patient in the vehicle group. Generally, 
LSRs were self-limited and did not require treatment. All patients with residual LSRs were followed 
until resolution or stabilisation. 
Overall, severe LSRs occurred in 46 (13%) patients in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment group and in 1 
(0.3%) patient in the vehicle group for the pooled safety analysis (Studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-
004). One patient discontinued treatment due to a TEAE during the tirbanibulin 1% ointment

development programme  up to day 57 which was unrelated to study treatment. In the individual 
studies, severe LSRs occurred in 14 (8%) patients in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment group and there 
were none in the vehicle group (Study KX01-AK-003), and in 32 (18%) patients in the tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment group and in 1 (0.6%) patient in the vehicle group (Study KX01-AK-004). 
The analysis of maximal  post-baseline LSRs greater than baseline provides the worst case observed for 
incidence, and the highest severity, irrespective of study visit after baseline. Incidence and severity of 
LSRs were higher in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment group than the vehicle group. Within the tirbanibulin 
1% ointment group, the most commonly occurring LSRs were moderate erythema (63% patients) and 
flaking/scaling (47% patients); less frequently reported were mild crusting and mild swelling (30% and 
29% patients, respectively); least frequently reported were mild vesiculation/pustulation and mild 
erosion/ulceration (7% and 9% patients, respectively). The incidence of patients with severe LSR was 
highest for flaking/scaling (9% patients), followed by erythema (6% patients), and then all other LSR 
categories (≤2% patients). No patient experienced severe erosion/ulceration in the tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment group. 
In Study KX01-AK-002, LSRs were assessed using a 5-point scale ranging from Grades 0 (not 
present), 1 (minimal),  2 (mild), 3 (moderate), and 4 (worst). At baseline, 15 (18%), 18 (21%), and 5 
(6%) patients in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment 5-day dosing group had Grade 1 erythema, 
flaking/scaling, or crusting, respectively; other LSRs (swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, 
erosion/ulceration) were not present. In the tirbanibulin 1% ointment 5-day dosing group, the majority 
of LSRs were Grade 1 and Grade 2, and consisted of erythema and flaking/scaling.  
LSRs began by Day 2 and peaked by the end of treatment; by Day 15, there were more patients with 
≥Grade 2 erythema or flaking/scaling; by Day 29, all LSRs were close to baselines; and by Day 57, 
almost all patients had all LSRs as not present or Grade 1. The tirbanibulin treatment was well 
tolerated and the LSRs were self-limited and did not require treatment. 
In Study KX01-AK-002, composite LSR  score was defined as the sum (possible range, 0 to 24) of the 
individual LSR  grades for each sign at each visit. The composite LSR  scores for the tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment 5-day dosing group were consistent with the trends observed for individual LSR grades in 
that by Day 29; signs were at or below the baseline scores.  
Maximal post-baseline Grade 2 or Grade 3 were reported mainly for erythema, flaking/scaling, and 
crusting LSRs; 1 patient had Grade 4 erythema and flaking/scaling in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment 5-
day dosing group. Swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration were generally not present 
or were presented at post-baseline Grade 1. 
Pigmentation and Scarring  
The incidences of hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, and scarring were similar  between the 
tirbanibulin 1% ointment and vehicle groups. The number of patients in the vehicle and tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment groups with pigmentation or scarring remained relatively consistent over time and was 
generally lower  at Day 57 than at baseline. 
The number of patients with pigmentation/scarring peaked by the end of treatment, were at or below 
baseline by Day 15, and were at baseline for hyperpigmentation, and below baseline for scarring and 
hypopigmentation by Day 57. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other  significant events 
In total, 8 patients had a serious TEAE during the Treatment/Follow-Up Period in the pooled dataset: 3 
in the tirbanibulin 5-day dosing groups and 5 in the vehicle groups. Of these, 3 patients in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 120/144 
 
 
 
tirbanibulin 5-day dosing group had a serious TEAE during the Recurrence Follow-up Period. None of 
the serious TEAEs were considered to be related to study treatment. Two patients did not recover from 
the serious TEAE (1 patient in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment group continued to have hairy cell 
leukaemia and 1 patient in the vehicle group died due to completed suicide).  
Safety Assessment up to Day 57:  
Three patients reported 5 serious TEAEs across the studies in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment groups: 
benign prostatic hyperplasia (2 events), intestinal obstruction (severe), pulmonary embolism  (severe), 
and chest pain; and 5 patients reported 7 serious TEAEs (all severe) across the vehicle groups: 
myocardial infarction, aortic valve stenosis, completed suicide, arthralgia, intervertebral disc 
degeneration, complete atrioventricular block, and bacteraemia.  None of the serious TEAEs were 
treatment-related.  
Recurrence Follow-up Period:  
During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, 3 patients reported 5 serious TEAEs following daily application 
for 5 days in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment groups: 1 patient (3 serious  TEAEs of sepsis, hairy cell 
leukaemia, haemoglobin decreased) in Study KX01-AK-003, 2 patients (serious TEAEs of 
cerebrovascular accident and VIIth nerve paralysis) in Study KX01-AK-002, and no serious TEAE in 
Study KX01-AK-004. None of the serious TEAEs were considered related to study treatment.  
Laboratory  findings 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed for haematology, blood chemistry, or 
urinalysis parameters  across the studies in patients with AK.  There were no clinically significant 
abnormalities that were considered related to tirbanibulin.  
Vital Signs and Physical Examinations  
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed in vital signs across the studies in 
patients with AK. No clinically meaningful changes in physical examination findings over time were 
observed across the 5 studies in patients with AK. 
Minimal mean body weight changes were noted from baseline to Day 57 in all treatment groups in the 
Phase III studies and the Phase IIa study.  
Electrocardiograms  
When tirbanibulin was used as intended in clinical practice (daily application of tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment for 5 consecutive days), information on the effects of tirbanibulin on cardiac repolarisation, 
using both direct measures of QT in human studies and in a series of non-clinical studies, indicate that 
tirbanibulin does not affect cardiac repolarisation.  
Phase III Patient Studies: KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004  
Few clinically significant treatment-emergent ECG abnormalities were observed in Studies KX01-AK-
003 and KX01-AK-004. These were mostly asymptomatic  arrhythmias (including sinus bradycardia, 
ventricular premature beats, atrial premature beats, first-degree heart block, T-wave inversion, or 
flat/low negative T waves) that did not require intervention and were not considered related to study 
treatment.  
ERT Cardiac Safety Report  
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021

ECG data from Days 5 and 15 in the 2 Phase III studies were combined as part of a pooled analysis 
exploring the potential effect of tirbanibulin 1% ointment on ECG parameters.  For this analysis, the 12-
lead ECGs were centrally read and interpreted by technical experts. There were no treatment effects 
on QTcF and other ECG intervals/parameters (HR, RR,  PR, QRS, and T wave morphology) of clinical or 
regulatory concern.  
Phase II Patient Study: KX01-AK-002  
In Study KX01-AK-002, 2 abnormal,  clinically significant ECG findings in 1 patient were reported as 
TEAEs: ECG QT prolonged and defect conduction interventricular, both TEAEs were reported on Day 57 
with moderate severity. The patient remained asymptomatic and stable, and had a significant medical 
history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. Both TEAEs were considered not related to study 
treatment and resolved by Day 68 without treatment.  
The few other clinically significant ECG abnormalities that were observed included first-degree heart 
block in 2 patients (1 patient each on Days 8 and 57) and prolonged QT at Day 57 in 2 additional 
patients. None of these patients were symptomatic.   
No other changes of clinical importance in ECG readings over time were reported. 
Safety in special populations 
The table below summarises the pooled incidence of treatment-related TEAEs by the subgroups age, 
gender, treatment location, and baseline AK lesion group for patients in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment 
and vehicle groups in from the Phase III Studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004, up to Day 57. 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021

Age  
No notable difference was observed in safety between the 2 age subgroups treated with tirbanibulin 
1% ointment.  
The number of patients <65 years of age was lower than those ≥65 years of age in both treatment 
groups for the pooled studies. The overall incidences of treatment-related TEAEs was similar between 
patients who are <65 years of age and those ≥65 years of age in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment (17% 
versus 15% patients, respectively) and same in vehicle groups (10% patients for both subgroups). 
Treatment-related TEAEs were predominantly application site pain and pruritus, and were similarly 
distributed between the 2 age subgroups. Other treatment-related TEAEs were too few for meaningful 
comparison between the 2 subgroups.  
Gender 
Overall there were no meaningful difference in safety between the gender subgroups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021

There were a greater number of male patients than female patients in the both the tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment (305 versus 48 patients, respectively) and vehicle (304 versus 45 patients, respectively) 
treatment groups in the pooled studies. There was a relatively greater difference in the incidence of 
treatment-related TEAEs between the tirbanibulin 1% ointment and vehicle groups in case of female 
patients (17% versus 2% patients, respectively) than for male patients (16% versus 11% patients, 
respectively). However, due to the relatively lower number of female patients, these data need to be 
interpreted with caution.  
Treatment-related TEAEs in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment group were predominantly application site 
pain and pruritus (10 and 9% patients, respectively). Although there was a smaller number of female 
patients compared to males, the incidence of application site pain and application site pruritus 
appeared to be similar  between the gender subgroups in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment group: 10% and 
9% in male patients, and 10% and 13% in female patients. 
Treatment Location:  
There was a greater number of patients with treatment location face than patients with treatment 
location scalp in the both the tirbanibulin 1% ointment (238 versus 115 patients, respectively) and 
vehicle (239 versus 110 patients, respectively) treatment groups in the pooled studies. The overall 
incidence of treatment-related TEAEs was slightly higher for face subgroup than the scalp subgroup for 
both the tirbanibulin 1% ointment (17% versus 13% patients, respectively) and vehicle (11% versus 
7% patients, respectively) groups.  
Treatment-related TEAEs were predominantly application site pain and pruritus and were similarly 
reported in the face subgroups (11% and 10% patients, respectively) and scalp subgroups (8% and 
8% patients, respectively). Other treatment-related TEAEs were too few for meaningful comparison 
between the subgroups. 
Baseline AK Lesion Group:  
There was a greater number of patients with 4 to 6 baseline AK lesions than 7 to 8 baseline AK lesions 
in the both the tirbanibulin 1% ointment (243 versus 110 patients, respectively) and vehicle (241 
versus 108 patients, respectively) treatment groups in the pooled studies.  
The overall incidence of treatment-related TEAEs is slightly lower in subgroup with 4 to 6 baseline AK 
lesions (14% patients) than that with 7 to 8 baseline AK lesions (20% patients) in the tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment group.  
Treatment-related TEAEs were predominantly application site pain and pruritus and were similarly 
reported in both subgroups with 9% and 9% patients, respectively, in the subgroup 4 to 6 baseline AK 
lesions and 12% and 10% patients, respectively, in the subgroup with 7 to 8 baseline AK lesions. 
Other treatment-related TEAEs were too few for meaningful comparison between the 2 subgroups. 
Renal/hepatic impairment 
No formal studies of tirbanibulin 1% ointment in patients with hepatic or renal impairment  were 
submitted (see discussion on clinical safety). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions  and other interactions 
Low systemic exposure with a sub-nanomolar (0.598 nM) mean Cmax was observed in PK Study KX01-
AK-007. Therefore, no clinical drug-drug interaction studies were submitted (see discussion on clinical 
safety). In vitro drug-drug interaction studies showed that tirbanibulin and its metabolite KX2-5036 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 124/144 
 
 
 
have no potential to affect or be affected by concomitant medication at the level of the CYP enzymes or 
membrane  transporters at the maximum  clinical exposure observed.  
Given the route of administration (topical), the short duration of dosing (5 days), the low systemic 
exposure (sub-nanomolar mean Cmax), and the in vitro data, there is no potential for tirbanibulin to 
be affected by concomitant medications that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. 
Discontinuation  due to adverse events 
Safety assessment up to Day 57  
One patient discontinued treatment due to a TEAE during the tirbanibulin 1% ointment development 
programme.  The patient in the tirbanibulin group of Study KX01-AK-003 discontinued treatment on 
Day 3 because of a traumatic wound in the treatment area (scalp) which was unrelated to study 
treatment. The wound was healed by Day 15 and the patient did not discontinue from the study   
Recurrence Follow-up Period  
No patients experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the Recurrence Follow-up Period in the 
Studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004. In Study KX01-AK-002, 1 patient was discontinued from the 
Recurrence Follow-up period due to cerebrovascular accident, though the event had resolved. 
Post marketing  experience 
No post-marketing data were provided. 
Safety in phase I studies 
Phase I studies in patients with AK (Studies KX01-AK-01-US and KX01-AK-
007) 
•  Study KX01-AK-01-US: a Phase I, uncontrolled, open-label study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability,  and pharmacokinetics (PK) of tirbanibulin 1% ointment in adults with AK on the 
dorsal forearm.  
•  Study KX01-AK-007: a Phase I, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, parallel-group 
study to evaluate the safety and PK of tirbanibulin 1% ointment in adults with AK on the face 
or scalp.  
Monitoring Periods for Safety Assessments: 
•  Day 45 for the Phase I Study KX01-AK-01-US  
•  Day 29 for the Phase I Study KX01-AK-007  
In Study KX01-AK-01-US, no patients had a severe TEAE or a treatment-related TEAE. No patients 
died, or had a serious TEAE, or discontinued due to a TEAE. In the ITT Population (n=30) in Study 
KX01-AK-01-US, 4 (13%) patients had a TEAE: 1 (10%) patient who received 200 mg over 100 cm2 
for 3 days, 1 (13%) patient who received 50 mg over 25 cm2 for 5 days, and 2 (25%) patients who 
received 200 mg over 100 cm2 for 5 days.  
In Study KX01-AK-007, 4 (22%) patients had 5 TEAEs. One (11.1%) patient in the face group and 3 
(33.3%) patients in the scalp group experienced TEAEs. One (11.1%) patient in the scalp group

experienced a treatment-related TEAE; all other TEAEs were classified as not related to the treatment. 
There were no serious, severe or fatal, or TEAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation. 
KX01-AK-01-US: Local skin reactions were generally mild and transient, resolving quickly after 
completing study treatment and most were resolved by the end of observation at Day 45. 
KX01-AK-007: Local skin reaction signs on the treatment area were mostly transient, all were mild to 
moderate in erythema and flaking/scaling. Local skin reactions generally appeared after treatment, 
peaked around Day 8, and resolved or returned to baseline by Day 29. 
In Studies KX01-AK-01-US and KX01-AK-007 in patients, pigmentation and scarring were not 
assessed. 
Phase I studies in healthy subjects - Dermal safety studies (Studies KX01-
AK-006, KX01-AK-008, KX01-AK-009, and KX01-AK-010) 
KX01-AK-010 
Study Design: Study KX01-AK-0010 was a randomised, single-centre, controlled, evaluator-blinded, 
within-subject comparison study of tirbanibulin 1% ointment and vehicle ointment under occlusive, 
semi-occlusive, and open patch conditions in healthy subjects. Additionally, 0.9% saline was used as 
negative control and patched under occlusive conditions only. The primary  objective was to determine 
the tolerability of tirbanibulin 1% ointment after repeated topical application to the healthy skin of 
humans under occlusive, semi-occlusive, and open patch study conditions to determine which patch 
conditions would be used for a Repeat Insult Patch Test (RIPT) study (Study KX01-AK-006) to be 
conducted after completion of this study.  
All subjects had fields designated for the study treatment patches and negative control patch at 7 
randomly assigned, 2×2 cm per patch area at adjacent sites in the infrascapular region, for the 
purpose of determining irritation potential.  
•  Occlusive patch condition: 1 sachet (~250 mg) of study treatment on pad and adhered to 
designated area with adhesive that covered the pad and edges of pad.  
•  Semi-occlusive patch condition: 1 sachet (~250 mg) of study treatment on pad and adhered to 
designated area with adhesive at the edges of pad.  
•  Open patch condition: 1 sachet (~250 mg) of study treatment on designated area, covered 
with polyester gauze and taped down at 4 corners of gauze.  
Applications by study personnel and evaluation took place at the study site 3 times a week for 3 
consecutive weeks and a total of 9 applications approximately  48 to 72 (±4) hours apart.   
Evaluation of dermal reactions at the application sites was assessed clinically using a visual scale rating 
the degree of erythema, oedema, and other signs of cutaneous irritation. In addition, safety was 
assessed by evaluation of any AEs reported during the study.  
Subject Disposition: In Study KX01-AK-010, 36 subjects were randomised, and 30 subjects 
completed the study. Six subjects discontinued: 1 subject discontinued for a TEAE that was not related 
to study treatment and 5 subjects withdrew consent  
Safety Results: A total of 36 subjects were randomised, included in the Safety Population, and 
analysed for safety. A summary of the key safety findings is provided below.   
Evaluation of Skin Irritation 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 126/144 
 
 
 
•  Under occlusive and semi-occlusive patch conditions, significant irritation was observed at the 
tirbanibulin site: 32 (88.9%) subjects had a cumulative irritation score of 3 or greater. The 
vehicle site exhibited lower irritation under occlusive patch conditions, where only 2 (5.6%) 
subjects had a score of 3 or greater.  
•  Under open patch conditions, 8 (22.2%) subjects had a cumulative irritation score of 3 or 
greater at the tirbanibulin site. No subjects exhibited irritation at the vehicle site.  
•  Discontinuation of patch application was similar  following tirbanibulin application under 
occlusive and semi-occlusive conditions, with 32 subjects discontinued by Day 11. Tirbanibulin 
application under open conditions had a lower discontinuation rate and discontinuation 
occurred later than tirbanibulin application under occlusive or semi-occlusive conditions, with 8 
subjects who discontinued application by Day 22.  
Systemic Safety  
•  One TEAE was reported in 1 (2.8%) subject during the study. The TEAE (contact dermatitis - 
tape reaction around all sites) was mild in severity, not considered related to study treatment, 
and led to the subject’s discontinuation from the study  
There were no severe, serious, or fatal TEAEs reported.  
There were no ESIs reported.

KX01-AK-006 
Study Design: Study KX01-AK-006 was a randomised, single-centre, controlled, evaluator-blinded, 
within-subject comparison study of tirbanibulin 1% ointment, vehicle ointment, and negative control 
under open patch conditions in healthy subjects. The primary  objective was to determine the potential 
of tirbanibulin 1% ointment to induce sensitisation by repeated topical application to the healthy skin 
of humans under controlled conditions. In addition, safety was assessed by evaluation of any AEs 
reported during the study.  
During the Induction Phase, tirbanibulin 1% ointment, vehicle (supplied in single-use sachets that 
contained at least 250 mg of the investigational product), and negative control were applied by study 
personnel to randomly assigned, adjacent sites of 2×2 cm on the infrascapular area of the back 3 
times a week for 3 consecutive weeks (9 applications). Evaluation of dermal reactions at the 
application sites were assessed clinically approximately  48 to 72 hours post-dose using a visual scale 
that rated the degree of erythema, oedema, and other signs of cutaneous irritation. 
Following the Induction Phase, subjects entered a 10- to 14-day Rest Period, after which they entered 
the Challenge Phase, which consisted of one 48-hour application to a naïve site on the opposite side of 
the back. Observations based on the grading at the naïve site during Challenge Phase and the patterns 
of reactivity during the Induction Phase provided a basis for an interpretation of contact sensitisation. 
Notations on the appearance of the skin were made using a protocol-defined scoring system.  
A re-challenge was to be performed if a cutaneous response observed during the Challenge Phase 
indicated possible sensitisation (Grade 3 or higher) and/or at the discretion of the investigator. A 
narrative description of reactions in the Challenge and Re-challenge Phases were reported together 
with the opinion of the investigator as to whether such reactions were felt to be indicative of contact 
sensitisation.  
A total of 10 applications (9 applications in the Induction Phase and 1 during the Challenge Phase) 
were made over a period of approximately  6 to 8 weeks.

Subject Disposition: In Study KX01-AK-006, 261 subjects were randomised, 232 subjects completed 
the Induction Phase, and 229 subjects completed both the Induction and Challenge phase of the study. 
Thirty-two subjects discontinued: 2 subjects discontinued due to AEs that were unrelated to the study 
treatment, 14 subjects withdrew consent, and 16 subjects were lost to follow-up.  
Safety Results: The Safety Population included 261 subjects, the Cumulative Irritancy Population in 
the Induction Phase included 232 subjects, and the Sensitisation Population in the Challenge Phase 
included 229 subjects. A summary of the key safety findings is provided below.  
Sensitisation  
In the opinion of the investigator, no subjects required a Re-challenge in the study. There were no 
signs observed at any of the evaluations following the removal of the challenge patch for all study 
treatments suggestive of contact sensitisation. The response scores of 1 and 2 observed at the 
tirbanibulin 1% ointment and vehicle sites were consistent with the contact irritation seen during 
Induction, rather than sensitisation.  
• 
The mean and total cumulative irritation scores during the Induction Phase and the response 
scores during the Challenge Phase were consistent with contact irritation at the tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment site. There was greater contact irritation associated with tirbanibulin 1% ointment 
compared to vehicle ointment or 0.9% saline. 
Systemic Safety  
1.  Twenty-two TEAEs were reported in 21 (8.0%) subjects. The most frequently reported TEAEs were 
headache (7 subjects, 2.7%), nasopharyngitis (6 subjects, 2.3%), and rhinorrhoea (3 subjects, 
1.1%).  
2.  None of the TEAEs were treatment related.  
3.  One severe TEAE was reported in 1 (0.4%) subject. The subject had a headache that was not 
related to study treatment and the event resolved.  
4.  One (0.4%) subject experienced a serious TEAE of mild dyspnoea that was considered not related 
to study treatment and the event resolved. The study treatment was discontinued, and the 
subject was discontinued from the study. 
5.  One (0.4%) subject experienced a TEAE of nausea that led to treatment discontinuation. The event 
was of moderate intensity, considered not related to study treatment, and the event resolved. 
6.  There were no fatal TEAEs reported.  
7.  There was 1 ESI: 1 subject had a positive urine pregnancy test at the end of study assessment. 
There were no pregnancy-associated AEs or SAEs reported. 
8.  There were no other ESIs reported.  
KX01-AK-008  
Study Design: Study KX01-AK-008 was a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, controlled, within-
subject comparison study of tirbanibulin 1% ointment and vehicle ointment in healthy subjects. The 
primary  objective was to determine the phototoxic potential of tirbanibulin 1% ointment when topical 
application to healthy skin was followed by light exposure. In addition, safety was assessed by 
evaluation of any AEs reported during the study.  
A total of 4 application sites (2×2 cm) were marked in the infrascapular region: 1 single-use sachet 
(~250 mg) per site of tirbanibulin 1% ointment was applied to 2 sites and vehicle ointment was 
applied to 2 sites by study personnel. Each study treatment was applied according to the

randomisation scheme under semi-occlusive patch conditions once during the study. After 
approximately  24 (±2) hours, all patches were removed and 1 application site for each treatment was 
irradiated with full-spectrum UV light (UVA/UVB), and 1 site for each treatment remained non-
irradiated. The irradiation dose of each subject was calculated using the minimal erythema dose (MED) 
that was determined on Day 1. The irradiated and non-irradiated sites were compared with each other 
and with a pre-designated, untreated irradiated site. All sites were examined approximately  24 (±2) 
hours after patch application (upon patch removal) and at approximately 24 and 48 hours post-
irradiation. Cutaneous reactions at the application sites were evaluated using a visual scale that rated 
the degree of erythema, oedema, and other signs of cutaneous irritation. The total study duration was 
4 days for each subject.  
Safety Results: A total of 31 subjects were randomised, included in the Safety Population and the 
Phototoxicity Analysis Population, and completed the study. A summary of the key safety findings is 
provided below. 
Evaluation of phototoxicity  
•  No subject had oedema even though some had an erythema score of 1 or 2; therefore, no one 
met the criterion of having phototoxicity. Thus, the dermal response scores for all subjects 
were attributed to irritation by tirbanibulin 1% ointment or vehicle ointment rather than 
phototoxicity.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
The tirbanibulin 1% ointment irradiated site had a higher mean dermal response score 
(average of the sum of erythema and oedema scores for Day 3 and Day 4) than the vehicle 
ointment irradiated site and the untreated irradiated control site; 0.94, 0.77, and 0.23, 
respectively. The tirbanibulin 1% ointment non-irradiated site had a higher mean dermal 
response score than the vehicle ointment non-irradiated site; 0.89 and 0.69, respectively.  
There was no evidence of a difference in mean dermal response scores of tirbanibulin 1% 
ointment irradiated and non-irradiated (p=0.5977). Similarly,  there was no difference in mean 
dermal response scores of vehicle ointment irradiated and non-irradiated (p=0.3796). This 
supports the lack of phototoxic activity for both tirbanibulin 1% ointment and the vehicle 
ointment.  
There were no statistically significant differences observed between tirbanibulin 1% ointment 
and vehicle ointment at the irradiated sites. The mean dermal response score of tirbanibulin 
1% ointment at the non-irradiated site was significantly higher than that of the vehicle 
ointment at the non-irradiated sites (p=0.0364).  
There was no indication of phototoxicity present among the subjects in this study.  
Systemic Safety  
•  One TEAE was reported by 1 (3.2%) subject during the study. The TEAE of headache was of 
mild severity and considered to be related to treatment by the investigator.  
• 
• 
There were no severe, serious, or fatal TEAEs reported. No subject discontinued study 
treatment due to TEAEs.  
There were no ESIs reported during the study.  
KX01-AK-009 
Study Design: Study KX01-AK-009 was a randomised, double-blind, single-centre, controlled, within-
subject comparison study of tirbanibulin 1% ointment, vehicle ointment, and an untreated, irradiated, 
open (non-occluded) control site in healthy subjects. The primary  objective was to determine the 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 129/144 
 
 
 
photo-allergic potential of tirbanibulin 1% ointment when topical application to healthy skin was 
followed by light exposure. In addition, safety was assessed by evaluation of any AEs reported during 
the study.  
A total of 8 application sites (2×2 cm each) were marked on the subject’s back and distributed so that 
4 sites were on each side of the back: 1 side was used for induction and 1 side for challenge. One set 
of application sites on the back was designated for irradiation after approximately  24 (±4) hours of 
study treatment application and the other set remained non-irradiated. An additional site was marked 
on the back that did not receive treatment but was irradiated at Challenge to serve as an untreated 
irradiated control.  
During the 3-week Induction Phase, study treatment (a small amount of ointment from single-use 
sachets containing approximately  250 mg of tirbanibulin 1% ointment or vehicle ointment) was applied 
by study personnel to 2 sites twice each week for approximately  24 (±4) hours under open patch 
conditions (6 applications). After 24 (±4) hours, all application sites were evaluated, and 1 application 
site of each treatment was irradiated with 2 times the subject’s MED (determined on Day 1). The sites 
were evaluated by a trained evaluator. All sites were re-evaluated post-irradiation, at approximately  48 
to 72 hours after irradiation. These procedures were performed each week for 3 weeks. Dermal 
reactions at the application sites were evaluated using a visual scale that rated the degree of 
erythema, oedema, and other signs of cutaneous irritation.   
At the end of the Induction Phase, subjects entered a 10- to 17- day Rest Period, and then a Challenge 
Phase. At Challenge, 1 single-use sachet of tirbanibulin 1% ointment or vehicle ointment was applied 
to each of 2 naïve sites once for approximately  24 (±4) hours under open patch conditions, after which 
all sites were evaluated, and 1 site of each study treatment and the additional untreated site were 
irradiated. The sites were examined for dermal reactions at approximately  24 (±4), 48 (±4), and 72 
(±4) hours post-irradiation. A re-challenge was to be performed if a cutaneous response observed 
during the Challenge Phase indicated possible photosensitisation or at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
The safety endpoints for this study were irritation responses during the Induction Phase, positive 
responses at Challenge (i.e.,  reactions indicative of a sensitisation response) and AEs.  
Subject Disposition: In Study KX01-AK-009, 64 subjects were randomised, 61 subjects completed 
the Induction Phase, and 59 subjects completed both the Induction and Challenge Phase of the study. 
Five subjects discontinued: 1 subject discontinued due to an AE not related to study treatment, 1 
subject discontinued for a protocol violation, and 3 subjects withdrew consent.  
Safety Results: A total of 64 subjects were included in the analysis of AEs. A total of 61 (95.3%) 
subjects completed the Induction Phase and were included in the analysis of local tolerability (photo-
irritation), and 59 (92.2%) subjects completed the Challenge Phase and were included in the analysis 
of photosensitisation. A summary of the key safety findings is provided below.  
Evaluation of Photosensitisation 
• 
Local tolerability (photo-irritation) was analysed in the Induction Phase and is a component of 
photo-allergy but does not necessarily indicate photo-allergy. Although there were statistically 
significant differences between mean irritation scores of the study treatment sites, these 
differences were not clinically significant because of the low level of the dermal response 
scores. The non-irradiated sites showed less irritation than the irradiated sites. There was no 
difference in irritation between the tirbanibulin 1% ointment and vehicle irradiated sites. The 
tirbanibulin 1% ointment non-irradiated site showed statistically significant more irritation than 
the vehicle non-irradiated site.  
Assessment report

Page 130/144 
 
 
 
•  Based on the investigator’s assessment, reviewing the results of the study treatments 
irradiated versus non-irradiated sites, as well as tirbanibulin 1% ointment versus vehicle and 
control, no subject showed evidence of photosensitisation during the Challenge Phase of the 
study. 
Safety  
•  Six TEAEs were reported by 5 (7.8%) subjects during the study. One TEAE (nasopharyngitis) 
was reported in 2 (3.1%) subjects, and the other 4 events were reported in 1 subject each. 
None of the TEAEs were considered related to study treatment.  
• 
There were no severe, serious, or fatal TEAEs reported.  
•  One subject discontinued study treatment and study due to a TEAE of upper respiratory 
infection that was moderate in severity and not related to study. There were no ESIs reported 
during the study. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Phase II and phase III patient studies 
The safety database was mainly based on studies KX01-AK-002, KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004. The 
phase III studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004 have the same study design, population and 
treatment regimens and were thus pooled together for their safety analysis.  
With the exception of AEs connected to the application site (application site pain and pruritus), the 
number of patients that experienced AEs was generally similar and low across all treatment arms. Most 
of these AEs were mild to moderate. 
The most common AEs up to day 57 were application site pain (10 vs 3%), application site pruritus (9 
vs 6%) and upper respiratory tract infection (4 vs 5%) for the pooled tirbanibulin 1% and vehicle 
treatment arms respectively. Only 1 AE, application site pruritus, was severe and considered related to 
tirbanibulin.  
In the follow up period a few TEAEs were reported in no more  than 1 patient across the studies in the 
tirbanibulin 1% ointment group and none in the vehicle group. While safety was followed for one year 
this was only for patients with a complete response at day 57 resulting in only a moderate proportion 
of tirbanibulin patients and a small proportion of vehicle treated patients being followed up for safety 
beyond day 57. However due to the low systemic absorption and mechanism of action of tirbanibulin, 
AEs related to treatment are generally not expected beyond the initial day 57 period (with the possible 
exception of skin cancer, discussed further below).  
Application site pain, application site pruritus and dizziness were considered related to tirbanibulin 
treatment and did not occur in the follow-up period. Application site pain and application site pruritus 
have been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Pregnancy, overdose and ocular exposure were closely monitored during the studies. There were no 
pregnancies reported in the phase II and phase III clinical trials.  The effects of tirbanibulin on 
pregnancy or breast feeding are unknown (see SmPC section 4.6). However,  due to the low systemic 
absorption of the ointment effects on pregnancy or breast feeding are considered unlikely. There were 
3 cases of overdose during the clinical development programme  of tirbanibulin including one case 
where 10 times the amount of product was applied for 5 days, however these overdoses did not cause 
any safety concerns. None of the ocular adverse events observed during the clinical development 
programme  were considered related to study treatment. The SmPC and PIL reflects that contact with 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 131/144 
 
 
 
the eyes should be avoided and tirbanibulin ointment may cause eye irritation. In the event of 
accidental contact with the eyes, the eyes should be rinsed immediately with large amounts of water, 
and the patient should seek medical care as soon as possible.  
Furthermore, tirbanibulin ointment must not be ingested. If accidental ingestion occurs, the patient 
should drink plenty of water and seek medical care. Tirbanibulin ointment should not be used on the 
inside of the nostrils, on the inside of the ears, or on the lips. 
Application of tirbanibulin ointment is not recommended until the skin is healed from treatment with 
any previous medicinal product, procedure or surgical treatment and should not be applied to open 
wounds or broken skin where the skin barrier  is compromised (see section 4.2).  
Skin cancer was also an adverse event of special interest. There was a slightly higher incidence of 
treatment-emergent skin cancers with tirbanibulin 10 of 353 (2.8%) compared to the vehicle 7 of 349 
(2.0%) subjects. It is noted that some of the tirbanibulin patients had developed more than 1 skin 
cancer. Many cases were confounded with a history of skin cancers. Furthermore, the short duration of 
safety follow-up suggests many of these skin cancers were pre-existing and only 1 of these skin 
cancers occurred in the treatment field (SCC, tirbanibulin arm). The SCC in the treatment field 
developed on day 74 of the study and was resolved by day 98. This patient had a history of BCC, and 
the SCC was considered as not related to tirbanibulin by the investigator. However,  it is noted that 
some of the other skin cancers also developed in head and neck areas and close to the treatment field. 
Overall there is limited information on the potential risk of developing skin cancer. A relevant warning 
was added in the SmPC to highlight that changes in the appearance of actinic keratosis could suggest 
progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma, and that clinically atypical lesions for actinic 
keratosis or suspicious for malignancy should be appropriately  managed (see SmPC section 4.4). 
While an association between tirbanibulin use and skin cancer development is not established, 
tirbanibulin is through disruption of the cellular microtubule network and the safety database did not 
include a sufficient number of patients to rule out a higher incidence of skin cancer over time.  
Skin tumours in treatment area is included in the RMP as an important potential risk, which is 
considered appropriate  to identify this potential effect in the treatment area where exposure levels will 
be highest.  
In order to further evaluate this risk the applicant will also conduct and submit the results of study M-
14789-41, a phase 4, multicentre, randomised, investigator-blinded, active-controlled, parallel-group 
study (Post-authorisation safety study (PASS)). The proposed study will be conducted to evaluate the 
incidence of invasive SCC and to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of tirbanibulin 10 mg/g 
ointment. Since the potential risk of developing skin cancer is considered critical, the PASS study M-
14789-41 is considered key to the benefit/risk and included as a category 1 PASS.  The protocol will be 
submitted for approval. 
Local skin reactions in the treated area, including erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, 
erosion/ulceration, and vesiculation/pustulation, may occur after topical application of tirbanibulin 
ointment as commonly reported in patients (>1% to <10%) treated with tirbanibulin. Treatment effect 
may not be adequately assessed until resolution of local skin reactions (see SmPC section 4.4). Most 
LSRs were mild to tolerate and reached a peak around day 8 after treatment before dropping back 
down to baseline levels by day 57. However, it is noted that there were no formal assessments 
between days 5, 8 and 15 when potentially the peak severity of LSRs might have occurred. The levels 
of pigmentation and scarring in patients was similar between tirbanibulin and vehicle control groups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021

Numerically there were a lower number of SAEs in vehicle groups than tirbanibulin groups. Overall the 
level of SAEs was low and no SAE was considered related to treatment. There was one death in the 
clinical development programme  but this was in a vehicle treatment arm. 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed for haematology, blood chemistry, 
urinalysis, vital signs or physical examinations across the pivotal studies in patients treated with 
tirabanibulin. A thorough QT study is not considered needed due to results of non-clinical studies and 
PK data demonstrating that systemic exposure is negligible. In addition, the clinical data from the 
phase III studies showed no excess of cardiac-related TEAEs or clinical importance in ECG readings 
with tirbanibulin as compared with vehicle treatments. The risk of any cardiac adverse events is 
considered low.  
There were no meaningful differences in the numbers of AEs for patients treated with tirbanibulin with 
respect to age (<65 v >65 years), sex, treatment locations (face vs scalp) and the number of baseline 
lesions (4-6 vs 7-8). An adequate number of elderly patients have been recruited to the studies. This is 
in line with the demographic distribution of AK lesions. Paediatric patients were not recruited to the 
clinical development programme  as AK is not reported in children.  
No effects on renal or hepatic impairment are expected due to the negligible systemic absorption of the 
ointment. 
No systemic drug-drug interactions are expected given the low systemic absorption of this product and 
the short duration of dosing. 
Only 1 patient discontinued tirbanibulin treatment due to an AE (traumatic wound) that was not 
considered related to the treatment. 
Phase I patient studies 
There were no serious or severe AEs, and no AEs that led to discontinuation of treatment in either of 
the phase 1 patient studies. There was a similar  trend for LSRs in healthy subjects as there was for 
patients. 
Dermal safety studies 
The pilot study KX01-AK-010 confirmed that occluded and semi-occluded patch testing were not 
tolerable in healthy volunteers. Open patch conditions were thus selected for the next study KX01-AK-
006. 
In the potential sensitizing study KX01-AK-006 tirbanibulin 1% ointment was observed to cause 
irritancy in the majority of subjects. The conclusion of the application is that tirbanibulin 1% ointment 
does not cause potential sensitisation. The level of AEs was low throughout the study. 
The results of phototoxicity study KX01-AK-008 were presented. It is noted that this study was 
performed under semi-occlusive conditions and is therefore not directly comparable  to the open patch 
conditions used in studies KX01-AK-006 and KX01-AK-009. However,  there were no significant 
differences in mean dermal scores for irradiated and non-irradiated tirbanibulin treatments and 
therefore no evidence of potential phototoxicity. 
In the photosensitising study KX01-AK-009, there were no meaningful differences in mean dermal 
scores for challenge irradiated and non-irradiated tirbanibulin and therefore no evidence of potential 
photosensitisation. 
Overall, tirbanibulin was well tolerated and apart from LSRs, application site pain and application site 
pruritus, there were similar  levels of AEs in the tirbanibulin treatment group compared to the vehicle

control group. The lack of comparator  data is considered acceptable given the safety profile of the 
product and considering comparative data will be available from the phase 4 trial M-14789-41. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
2.6.2.  Conclusions  on the clinical safety 
Overall tirbanibulin 1% ointment has a tolerable safety profile, most AEs were mild to moderate in 
severity, and reversible. 
Although a causal association with malignancy cannot be currently established, the potential to develop 
skin cancers is considered a safety concern due the lack of long-term safety data.  
The results of a 3-year post authorisation safety study (PASS, study M-14789-41) against an active 
comparator  expected to enrol 270 subjects in the tirbanibulin arm will be provided (see RMP, category 
1 study) to address the potential risk of developing skin tumours. This study will provide both longer 
term safety and efficacy data. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
Annex II PASS: In order to further investigate the risk of progression of actinic keratosis (AK) to 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in adult patients with non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic 
keratosis (AK) treated with tirbanibulin, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of the phase 4, 
multicentre, randomised, investigator-blinded, active-controlled, parallel-group study M-14789-41 
conducted according to an agreed protocol  (due date Q2 2026).

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.7 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance  system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic  Safety Update Reports submission  requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 14.12.2020. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of tirbanibulin with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers,  complex or derivative of any of them. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers tirbanibulin to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Klisyri (tirbanibulin) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU and it has a PASS imposed at the time of 
authorisation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 136/144 
 
 
 
 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic  Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Klisyri is intended for the field treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic keratosis 
(Olsen grade 1) of the face or scalp in adults. 
3.1.2.  Available  therapies and unmet medical need 
The appropriate  treatment is generally chosen based on the number of lesions present and therapy 
may be broadly categorised as either lesion-directed (e.g., cryosurgery) or field-directed (e.g., topical 
products). 
While there are a number of licensed therapies available in the EU that are effective in AK treatment 
adherence with topical AK treatments is reported to be poor,  with approximately  90% of patients being 
non-adherent or non-persistent with therapy (Shergill, 2013). Therefore, there is a continued need for 
additional AK treatment options. 
3.1.1.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy is from two replicate phase III studies, KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004. 
They were double-blind, randomised, vehicle-controlled, multi-centre Phase III studies that evaluated 
the efficacy and safety of tirbanibulin 1% ointment when applied daily to a treatment area of 25 cm2 
for 5 consecutive days in adults with AK on the face or scalp. 
3.2.  Favourable  effects 
A statistically significant improvement  was observed for complete clearance at day 57 in both studies 
(p<0.0001) in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment group compared with the vehicle group (KX01-AK-003 
overall: 44% versus 5%). A similar  effect was observed in study KX01-AK-004 with an overall 
complete clearance rate of 54% in the tirbanibulin 1% ointment arm versus 13% in the placebo arm, 
respectively (p<0.0001). 
There were very high completion rates therefore both ITT and PP analyses were similar and there were 
no issues regarding missing data. 
Complete clearance rates for the facial lesions were consistent between both studies KX01-AK-003 and 
KX01-AK-004 with a difference from placebo of 47% and 46% respectively (p<0.0001). 
Assessment report  
EMA/397273/2021  
Page 137/144 
 
 
 
 
Complete clearance rates on the scalp were lower than the rates on the face and reported difference 
from placebo of 28% (p<0.0001) and 30% (p 0.0003) in studies KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004 
respectively. 
3.3.  Uncertainties  and limitations  about  favourable effects 
There are no available data on retreatment with tirbanibulin in patients who had a recurrence of their 
AK lesions, or on those who developed new lesions. Therefore, it is unclear whether recurrent lesions 
would respond similarly  to what was observed in the pivotal studies. Therefore, administration is 
restricted to single use. Efficacy on re-treatment will be investigated in the imposed PASS study which 
will also review AK histological progression to in situ or invasive SCC following treatment over a 3-year 
period.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Most AEs reported in the clinical trials with tirbanibulin 1% ointment were mild to moderate in severity, 
and reversible.  The overall rates for AEs and SAEs were low across all treatment arms with higher 
incidences of local skin reactions (LSRs), including erythema (91%), flaking/scaling (82%), crusting 
(46%), swelling (39%), erosion/ulceration (12%), and vesiculation/pustulation (8%) at the application 
site. Furthermore, application site pruritus (9.1%) and pain (9.9%) were reported. 
There was a slightly higher incidence of treatment-emergent skin cancers reported with tirbanibulin 10 
of 353 (2.8%) compared to the vehicle 7 of 349 (2.0%) subjects. Some of the tirbanibulin patients had 
developed more than 1 skin cancer and many case reports were confounded with a history of skin 
cancers. The short duration of safety follow-up suggested many of these skin cancers were pre-existing 
and only 1 of these skin cancers occurred in the treatment field (SCC, tirbanibulin arm). 
3.5.  Uncertainties  and limitations  about  unfavourable effects 
There is no comparative  safety data and no long-term safety data available to address concerns about 
the potential risk of developing skin cancer.  
While an association between tirbanibulin use and skin cancer development is not established, the 
mode of action of tirbanibulin is stated to be through disruption of the cellular microtubule network and 
the safety database did not include a sufficient number of patients to rule out a higher incidence of 
skin cancer over time.  
While the risk of skin cancer is considered to be low from a preclinical and PK perspective, it cannot be 
completely excluded that an increase in skin cancer development can occur over time. Skin tumours in 
treatment area is included as an important potential risk in the RMP and will be closely monitored. 
Furthermore, the incidence of progression to skin cancer over 3 years will be followed in the phase IV 
PASS study M-14789-41 to be conducted against an active comparator.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance  of favourable  and unfavourable  effects 
A significant improvement in complete clearance of AK lesions at day 57 following treatment with 
tirbanibulin was observed over vehicle. A consistent effect was seen in both replicate studies. The 
effects were seen in both facial and scalp lesions, however a greater effect was observed in facial 
lesions compared to the scalp.

Patients were followed up for 1 year and there was a recurrence rate of 74% and 72%, one year post 
day 57 in study KX01-AK-003 and KX01-AK-004 respectively. There was a higher recurrence rate for 
scalp lesions versus facial lesions. 
There are limitations with the clinical programme.  There is only evidence for a single treatment 
confined to the head and face and confined to non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic AK lesions. There was 
a significant recurrence for previously treated and cleared lesions 12 months after the primary 
endpoint at day 57. This occurred at a higher extent on the scalp compared to the face. Given the 
natural history of the disease, it is likely that patients could develop additional AK lesions in the future. 
However,  intermittent use of tirbanibulin has not been studied. Therefore, the product information 
recommends a single treatment duration of 5 days only and up to a maximum  surface area of 25 cm2. 
Initiation and oversight should be performed by a physician (see SmPC). 
It is important to further examine longer term safety in terms of skin cancer risk with this medicinal 
product and whether retreatment of recurrent lesions is effective and safe. In line with the previous 
CHMP advice on this issue, the applicant will conduct a Phase IV PASS which is a randomised, active-
controlled, investigator-blinded, safety and re-treatment study (M-14789-41) in adult patients with AK 
on the face or scalp over 3 years with tirbanibulin 1% ointment.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy has only been studied in non-hyperkeratotic lesions (Olsen scale 1). Since there is no data 
with use in patients in hyperkeratotic lesions Olsen 2 or 3 or in use in patients with basal cell 
carcinoma (BCC) the indication was restricted to patients with Olsen grade 1 lesions. 
The efficacy of Klisyri as a single treatment duration of 5 days is considered established for the field 
treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic keratosis (Olsen grade 1) of the face or 
scalp in adults. The safety profile is considered acceptable in general, however long-term safety data 
are not yet available and the potential risk for skin cancer is unknown and will be evaluated as part of 
the Study M-14789-41 which will provide longer term safety and efficacy data. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk of Klisyri for the field treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic 
keratosis (Olsen grade 1) of the face or scalp in adults is positive. 
Divergent positions are appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Klisyri is favourable in the following indication: 
Klisyri is indicated for the field treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic keratosis 
(Olsen grade 1) of the face or scalp in adults.

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete,  within the stated timeframe,  the below measures: 
Description 
PASS: In order to further investigate the risk of progression of actinic keratosis (AK) 
to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in adult patients with non-hyperkeratotic, non-
hypertrophic actinic keratosis (AK) treated with tirbanibulin, the MAH should conduct 
and submit the results of the phase 4, multi-centre, randomised, investigator-
blinded, active-controlled, parallel-group study M-14789-41 conducted according to 
an agreed protocol.

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that tirbanibulin is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

Appendix: DIVERGENT  POSITION DATED 20 May 2021 
Klisyri EMEA/H/C/005183/0000 
The  undersigned CHMP  members  did not  agree  with  the  CHMP’s  positive  opinion  recommending  the 
granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  of  Klisyri  (tirbanibulin  1%  ointment)  indicated for  the  field 
treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic keratosis of the face or scalp in adults. 
The reasons  for divergent opinion are  based  on the insufficient demonstration of the safety profile  of 
Klisyri.  If most AEs were mild to moderate in severity, the main concern remains the lack of long-term 
safety data with regards to the potential to develop skin cancers.  
Overall, we consider that the current data do not allow a proper assessment of the safety profile of Klisyri 
for the following reasons: 
• 
• 
• 
Too few patients have been enrolled in phase III studies (only 353 patients received the proposed 
treatment regimen and only 107 patients followed-up to approximately 1 year after the first day 
of application of tirbanibulin (11 months of total length of follow-up) and 83 at the time point of 
14 months after first application.);  
The skin retention time  is a  key factor to explore  the potential  carcinogenic effect of a  topical 
treatment for the development of skin cancer, especially Squamous Cell Carcinoma, but no such 
data have been provided. 
The mechanism of action of tirbanibulin is worrying: it is similar to the vinca-alkaloids class. This 
class is known to be associated to many serious adverse effects, especially risk of cancer. 
As a conclusion, we are of the opinion the benefit/risk ratio cannot be determined for Klisyri  in the field 
treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic keratosis of the face or scalp in adults.

1.  Introduction 
On 11 January 2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for rivaroxaban (study 18226, 
EudraCT number: 2015-002610-76), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as 
amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

2.1.  Information on the development program 
2.2.  The MAH stated that study 18226, EudraCT number: 2015-002610-76, 
is submitted as a stand-alone study. Information on the pharmaceutical 
formulation used in the study 
Rivaroxaban was to be administered twice daily in an open-label fashion as a 0.1% (1 mg/ml) oral 
suspension (age- and body weight-adjusted dosing [see Table 1]). Rivaroxaban had to be taken in the 
morning and in the evening (approximately 12 hours apart) at approximately the same times each 
day. Dose adjustment, due to increased body weight was to be performed at Month 6 (both Part A and 
Part B). 
The target exposure of rivaroxaban was to match that of rivaroxaban 10 mg total daily dose (oral) in 
adults.  
Acetylsalicylic acid was to be provided as 81-mg or 100-mg tablets according to local practice.  
Subjects randomized to ASA were to receive approximately 5 mg/kg of ASA to a maximum of 1 whole 
tablet as a single daily dose. Tablets could be split in half, if necessary (eg. children weighing ≤10 kg), 
to meet the daily dose, and the dose was documented. It was recommended that tablets were not split 
more than in half.  
Dose adjustments due to increased body weight were made at Month 6.

Clinical study 18226 “UNIVERSE” 
Description 
A prospective, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy of rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis in paediatric subjects 2 
to 8 years of age after the Fontan procedure. 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary Objectives 
Part A 
To characterize the single- and multiple-dose PK and PK/PD profiles after oral rivaroxaban therapy 
administered to paediatric subjects 2 to 8 years of age with single ventricle physiology who had 
completed the Fontan procedure within 4 months prior to enrolment. 
Part B 
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban, administered twice daily (exposure matched to 
rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily in adults) compared to ASA, given once daily (approximately 5 mg/kg) 
for thromboprophylaxis in same population as Part A. 
Secondary Objectives 
Part A 
To assess the safety and tolerability of rivaroxaban treatment. 
Part B 
To further characterize the PK and PK/PD profiles of rivaroxaban. 
Study design 
A prospective, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter study conducted at multiple sites in North 
America, Latin America, Western Europe, and in Asia-Pacific countries to evaluate the PK and PK/PD 
profiles, safety, and efficacy of rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis in paediatric subjects 2 to 8 years 
of age with single-ventricle physiology who had completed the Fontan procedure within 4 months prior 
to enrolment. Subjects were to be enrolled and randomized to receive the first dose of study drug on 
Visit 2/Day 1 after meeting all of the eligibility criteria. 
This study consisted of 2 parts: 
Part A: This was the 12-month, single-arm part of the study, which included a 12-day initial PK, PD, 
and safety assessment period. Subjects received the first dose of rivaroxaban oral suspension on Day 1 
(on site). Rivaroxaban was given twice daily for 12 days (+9 days). Pharmacokinetic and PD samples 
were collected on Day 1 and Day 4 (+2 days) of rivaroxaban administration. An internal DRC assessed 
before the subject returned for Day 12 the PK, PD, and the safety data available from each subject, 
prior to the subject continuing in the study to complete the planned 12 months of open-label 
rivaroxaban therapy. The subjects who could continue the 12-month treatment also had PK and PD

samples collected at Month 3 and Month 12. Safety and efficacy were evaluated throughout the study. 
Subjects in Part A did not participate in Part B. 
Part B: Randomization in Part B of this study began once the cumulative data from the Initial PK, PD, 
and Safety Assessment Period in Part A were deemed acceptable by the Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC). This was the 2-arm, randomized, open-label, active-controlled part of the study 
that evaluated the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban compared to ASA for thromboprophylaxis for 12 
months. Subjects randomized to rivaroxaban also had PK and PD assessments. There was an up to a 
21-day Screening Period, a 12-month Open-Label Treatment Period and a 30-day Follow-Up Contact 
(phone contact). 
Study population /Sample size 
Part A and B applied the same set of selection criteria. Paediatric subjects 2 to 8 years of age who 
have single-ventricle physiology and who have completed the Fontan procedure within 4 months prior 
to enrolment were potentially eligible. For Part A, the screening assessments took place after the 
Fontan procedure and up to 21 days before the first dose of rivaroxaban. During the screening period, 
baseline laboratory blood testing was done, and a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule 
out thrombosis. 
For both parts, subjects who did not meet all of the enrolment criteria for the study could be 
rescreened 1 additional time as long as enrolment was within 4 months of their Fontan procedure. 
Inclusion criteria: 
1. Boys or girls 2 to 8 years of age with single ventricle physiology and who had completed the initial 
Fontan procedure within 4 months prior to enrolment

Approximately 10 paediatric subjects were planned to be enrolled in Part A and approximately 90 
paediatric subjects were planned to be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive rivaroxaban oral 
suspension or ASA for 12 months in Part B. 
Treatments 
Rivaroxaban was supplied as 0.1% (1 mg/mL) oral suspension with target exposure matching to that 
of rivaroxaban 10 mg total daily dose (oral) in adults. For reference therapy, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 
was supplied as 81 mg or 100 mg tablets for oral administration. 
For posologies, see section 2.2 above. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
For both study parts, the primary efficacy outcome was evaluated as any venous or arterial thrombotic 
event, which was defined as the appearance of a new thrombotic burden within the CV system on 
either routine surveillance or clinically indicated imaging, or the occurrence of a clinical event known to 
be strongly associated with thrombus (such as cardioembolic stroke, pulmonary embolism). 
All thrombotic events and the primary cause of any death were adjudicated by the CIAC. Transthoracic 
echocardiograms were centrally read by an echocardiographic core laboratory. Per protocol, subjects 
were to be withdrawn from the study treatment if they reached an efficacy outcome. After cessation of 
study treatment, it was at the investigator’s discretion to continue with other antithrombotic therapy.

regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

The primary safety outcome was major bleeding events adjudicated by the CIAC using the 
International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definition. Clinically relevant non-major 
(CRNM) and trivial (minimal) bleeding were secondary safety outcomes. All bleeding events were 
adjudicated by the CIAC. 
Major bleeding was defined as overt bleeding and: 
 Associated with a fall in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more; or 
 Leading to a transfusion of the equivalent of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) or 
whole blood in adults; or 
 Occurring in a critical site: intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, 
intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal; or 
 Contributing to death. 
Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for 
major bleeding but associated with: 
 Medical intervention, or 
 Unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician, or 
 (Temporary) cessation of study treatment, or 
 Discomfort for the subject such as pain, or 
 Impairment of activities of daily life (such as loss of school days or hospitalization). 
Trivial (minimal) bleeding was defined as any other overt bleeding event that does not meet criteria for 
clinically relevant non major bleeding. 
The definitions of major bleeding, CRNM bleeding, and trivial bleeding events were based on the 
criteria defined by the ISTH. However, some criteria were adjusted to the paediatric population, eg, for 
the quantity of blood transfused to meet the criteria for major bleeding, instead of “leading to a 
transfusion of ≥2 units of packed RBCs or whole blood” in this study it was defined as “leading to a 
transfusion of the equivalent of ≥2 units of packed RBCs or whole blood in adults”. In the CIAC charter, 
it was specified to be “10 mg/kg of body weight”. In addition, in order to harmonize the approach to 
adjudicating all bleeding events across the rivaroxaban paediatric program (VTE treatment and CHD 
prophylaxis) with agreement from the IDMC, the UNIVERSE CIAC charter was amended to include the 
same guidance on CRNM bleeding events used in all the VTE treatment studies. 
Safety was also evaluated based on adverse events, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), clinical 
laboratory tests (haematology, serum chemistry, prothrombin time [PT], and activated partial 
thromboplastin time [aPTT]), and other safety events. AESIs were to be reported as SAEs and 
included: Suspected toxic effect on the bone marrow including severe thrombocytopenia (platelet 
count less than 50 x 109/L), severe neutropenia (white blood cell countless than 500/mL), 
pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia; Suspected severe hypersensitivity reaction (eg, anaphylaxis, 
angioedema, severe urticaria, bronchospasm, etc.); Severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome; Suspected severe liver injury and concurrent elevations of ALT >5x ULN and total bilirubin 
>2x ULN. 
Pharmacokinetic and PD samples were collected on Day 1, Day 4, Month 3, and Month 12 of 
rivaroxaban treatment in Part A. Pharmacokinetic and PD samples were also collected on Day 1, Month 
3, and Month 12 in Part B.

Statistical Methods 
For general statistical considerations see CSR Section 16.1.9 SAP (incl Amendment 1). Full Analysis 
Set: All subjects in Part A who received at least 1 dose of study drug and all subjects in Part B who 
were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug. Safety Analysis Set: The same as Full 
Analysis Set. Per-protocol Set: This analysis set excluded subjects with key protocol deviations from 
the full analysis set. These deviations included the following:  Did not meet the following key 
inclusion or exclusion criteria: INT-1: inclusion criteria 1, exclusion criteria 1, 4, 6 (>90 consecutive 
days), 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 18; INT-2: inclusion criteria 1, exclusion criteria 1, 4, 6 (>90 consecutive 
days), 7, 8.1, 13, 14, 15, 18;  Took incorrect study drug;  Did not discontinue study drug 
permanently according to the protocol;  Had been taking prohibited concomitant therapies as 
specified in the protocol. PK Analysis Set: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and 
had quantifiable rivaroxaban plasma concentrations were included in the descriptive PK analysis. PD 
Analysis Set: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had quantifiable and time-
matched PT, aPTT, and/or anti-FXa activity values were included in the descriptive PD analysis. 
On-Treatment Period: All data from the first dose of study drug to 2 days after the last dose of the 
study drug administration (inclusive). Up-to-End-of-Treatment Period: All data from first dose to end of 
treatment visit (ie, last efficacy-evaluation date - Month 12 or ESMD visit). Up-to-Last-Follow Up (last 
contact): All data from first dose to trial reference end date. 
Descriptive Pharmacokinetic Analyses: Summary statistics were prepared for the plasma rivaroxaban 
concentration-time data from Parts A and B of the study. In addition. plasma rivaroxaban 
concentrations as function of time were graphically compared between paediatric subjects who were 
enrolled in this study and adults who were enrolled in Phase 2 studies that evaluated rivaroxaban for 
the prevention of VTE following in total hip- and knee replacement (THR, TKR) (THR: Study 10944 and 
Study 11527, and TKR: Study 10945). Summary statistics were also prepared for PT and aPTT values 
and anti-FXa activity from Parts A and B of the study. In addition, PT and aPTT as function of time 
were graphically compared between paediatric subjects who were enrolled in this study and adults who 
were enrolled in Phase 2 studies. Furthermore, the relationship between the PD of rivaroxaban (ie., PT 
and aPTT values and anti-FXa activity) and plasma rivaroxaban concentrations was assessed 
graphically. 
Population PK analysis: A population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model of rivaroxaban was used to 
describe the PK profile of rivaroxaban in the paediatric subjects in this study. The analysis included 
plasma rivaroxaban concentration-time data from Part A and Part B, totaling 76 subjects, of whom 12 
subjects were from Part A. The popPK model was used to fit data and referred to as the UNIVERSE 
popPK model. 
For rivaroxaban-treated subjects, the systemic exposure metrics of rivaroxaban at steady state, ie, 
AUC24h,ss, Cmax,ss, and Ctrough,ss, were derived using the UNIVERSE popPK model. These exposure 
metrics were compared to those in adults who underwent THR and had received 10 mg rivaroxaban 
once daily while enrolled in a Phase 2 VTE prevention study. 
The exposure metrics of the paediatric population in this study were also compared to those for the 
paediatric population from the Phase 3 EINSTEIN Jr study (Study 14372) that were simulated using an 
EINSTEIN Jr popPK model (Report R-12947 [18376]) with the dose regimen of this study. The 
comparison to the Phase 3 EINSTEIN Jr study utilized a simulated PK data, rather than actual subject 
exposures, mainly because the Phase 3 EINSTEIN Jr study used a dose regimen that was intended to 
produce rivaroxaban exposures that are similar to those in adults who received rivaroxaban 20 mg 
once daily and therefore the exposures could not be directly compared.

All bleeding events (including major, clinically relevant non-major, and trivial bleeding events) and all 
thrombotic events (including any thromboembolism [TE] and/or PE) reported in subjects in the 
rivaroxaban group were collected and datasets were created for all rivaroxaban-treated subjects with 
available estimated PK parameters. The exposure metrics AUC24h,ss, Cmax,ss, and Ctrough,ss in the 
rivaroxaban treatment arm were compared between subjects with or without thrombotic events or 
bleeding events. Pharmacokinetic/PD data analysis plan was provided separately before database lock.  
For efficacy, no formal hypothesis testing was performed. The main efficacy analysis was based on Full 
Analysis Set, excluding subjects who started on study drug but were discontinued if central reading by 
the core laboratory reported thrombosis on the Screening transthoracic echocardiogram (these 
subjects were to be included however in the safety analysis) based on up-to-the-end-of-treatment 
period (outcomes confirmed by the CIAC). Events that were reported after Month 12 or ESMD visit 
were to be described in additional summaries or listings. Additionally, data were also summarized 
based on Full Analysis Set and up-to-last-FU (last contact) period or Per-protocol Analysis Set and On-
treatment period. Incidences rates (number of subjects with efficacy event during the period divided 
by number of subjects at risk at the beginning of the period) and the respective 95% CIs were 
calculated for the primary efficacy outcome by treatment group. Cumulative incidences (time to first 
event; Kaplan-Meier) were also calculated for the efficacy outcomes. In addition, listings of all efficacy 
outcomes were provided. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics relationship to thrombotic 
risk could be explored. 
For safety, no formal hypothesis testing was performed. If the date of an outcome event was missing 
or partially missing, the earliest logically possible date after enrolment was used as the event date. The 
date of an outcome event was defined as the maximum of date of enrolment and the first day of the 
month if only day was missing and was defined as maximum of date of enrolment and the first day of 
the year if both day and month are missing. Unless otherwise stated, all safety summaries and 
analyses were performed based on the Safety Analysis Set. The safety analysis was based on the 
Safety Analysis Set during the On-treatment period (bleeding events confirmed by the CIAC). 
Incidence rates (number of subjects with bleeding event during the period divided by the number of 
subjects at risk at the beginning of the period) and the respective 95% CIs were calculated for the 
major and clinically relevant non major bleeding events by treatment group. Cumulative incidence 
rates (time to first event; Kaplan-Meier) were calculated for major bleeding and CRNM bleeding. For all 
bleeding events, listings were provided, including those that were reported more than 2 days after stop 
of study medication. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics relationship to bleeding risk 
could be explored. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The study was conducted between 17 November 2016 (date first parent/caregiver signed informed 
consent) and 16 July 2020 (date of last observation for last subject recorded as part of the database). 
A total of 129 subjects with single ventricle physiology were screened at 36 sites in 10 countries 
(Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United 
States of America). Of these screened children, 17 (13.2%) were screen failures (with the primary 
reason being ineligible for entry) and 112 (86.8%) subjects were enrolled in this study; 100 in the Part 
B group (66 in the rivaroxaban group and 34 in the ASA group) and 12 in the rivaroxaban Part A group 
(Attachment TSIDEM03). There were 3 subjects who were rescreened. 
Of the 112 subjects enrolled, 110 (98.2%) subjects (64 [97.0%] in the rivaroxaban Part B group, 34 
[100.0%] in the ASA Part B group, and 12 [100.0%] in the rivaroxaban Part A group) received at least

1 dose of study drug, and were included in the full and the safety analysis set. A total of 108 (96.4%) 
subjects (62 [93.9%] in the rivaroxaban Part B group, 34 [100.0%] in the ASA Part B group, and 12 
[100.0%] in the rivaroxaban Part A group) were included in the per-protocol analysis set. A total of 76 
(67.9%) subjects (64 [97.0%] in the rivaroxaban Part B group and 12 [100.0%] in the rivaroxaban 
Part A group) were included in the PK analysis set while a total of 92 [82.1%] subjects (64 [97.0%] in 
the rivaroxaban Part B group and 12 [100.0%] in the rivaroxaban Part A group) were included in the 
PD analysis set. 
Of the 112 subjects enrolled, 107 (95.5%) subjects completed the study (63 [95.5%] in the 
rivaroxaban Part B group and 33 [97.1%] in the ASA Part B group; and 11 [91.7%] subjects in the 
rivaroxaban Part A group) and 5 (4.5%) subjects discontinued the study prematurely. In Part A, the 
reason for premature discontinuation of study participation was DRC decision (1 [8.3%]). In Part B, 
the reasons for premature discontinuation of study participation were lost to follow-up (1 [1.5%] 
subject in the rivaroxaban group and 1 [2.9%] subject in the ASA group) and withdrawal by parent or 
guardian (2 [3.0%] subjects in the rivaroxaban group). 
In the Safety Analysis Set, the most frequent reason for premature discontinuation of study treatment 
was thrombosis for 3 (2.7%) subjects (1 [1.6%] in the rivaroxaban Part B group and 2 [5.9%] in the 
ASA Part B group) followed by withdrawal by parent or guardian (2 [1.8%] subjects in the rivaroxaban 
group). One (1.6%) subject had the study treatment discontinued with a major bleeding event (at 
non-critical site, epistaxis) in the rivaroxaban Part B group. In Part A, 2 [16.7%] subjects in the 
rivaroxaban Part A group prematurely discontinued study drug due to a per-protocol’s DRC decision 
(for reaching an AUC at steady state above the pre-specified upper threshold of the target AUC range). 
These subjects did not have any bleeding or a reported AE while they were in the study.

Baseline data 
The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the rivaroxaban and 
the ASA groups; however, the percentage of male paediatric subjects was lower in the rivaroxaban 
Part B group (36 [54.5%]) than in the ASA Part B group (23 [67.6%]) and there was a slightly longer 
duration between the Fontan procedure and first study drug dose in the rivaroxaban Part B group (a 
median of 34.0 days) than in the ASA Part B group (a median of 24.0 days). The number of males in 
the rivaroxaban Part A group was 7 (58.3%) while duration between the Fontan procedure and first 
study dose was a median of 4.0 days. 
The rivaroxaban Part A group had a younger mean (SD) age (2.5 [0.67] years), a lower mean weight, 
and a shorter median duration between the Fontan procedure and first dose than both groups in Part 
B. The markedly shorter duration between the Fontan procedure and the first dose of study drug in 
Part A was probably due to the study design, which required frequent blood draws on Day 1 and Day 4 
for PK/PD testing in Part A. The frequency of blood draws would therefore have been minimized by 
performing them while the subjects were still in the hospital, with an intravenous catheter still in place 
due to their Fontan procedure. 
Relevant medical history reported for >5% subjects is summarized in Table 2-2. No clinically relevant 
differences between treatment groups were seen. The most frequently reported procedure in both 
groups was cardiac catheterization (88.4%), followed by cavopulmonary anastomosis (82.1%) and

Norwood procedure (61.6%). The most common congenital heart abnormality in both groups included 
congenital tricuspid valve atresia (in Part B, 42.4% in the rivaroxaban group and 38.2% in the ASA 
group) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (in Part B, 30.3% in the rivaroxaban group, and 23.5% in 
the ASA group). 
Of the 112 subjects enrolled, a large proportion of subjects (90.2%; 92.4% in rivaroxaban Part B 
group and 85.3% in ASA Part B group; and 91.7% in rivaroxaban Part A group) underwent the Fontan 
procedure using an extracardiac conduit. GORE-TEX was the most common baffle or conduit used 
(77.7% subjects; 80.3% in rivaroxaban Part B group and 67.6% in ASA Part B group; and 91.7% in 
rivaroxaban Part A group) and fenestration was done in 48.2% subjects (45.5% in rivaroxaban Part B 
group and 61.8% in ASA Part B group; and 25.0% in rivaroxaban Part A group) (Table 2-3).

Efficacy results 
A lower percentage of thromboembolic events was observed in Part B of the study for subjects in the 
rivaroxaban group (1 [1.6%]) compared to the ASA group (3 [8.8%]). There was 1 (1.6%) thrombotic 
event in the rivaroxaban Part B group which was adjudicated as pulmonary embolism and 3 (8.8%) 
thrombotic events in the ASA Part B group; 2 (5.9%) venous thrombotic events (superior vena cava 
and extra cardiac Fontan conduit) and 1 (2.9%) ischemic stroke. There was 1 (8.3%) subject with a 
venous thrombotic event (left suprahepatic vein) reported in the rivaroxaban Part A group (Table 3-1).

The primary efficacy outcome by subgroup analysis did not show any trends for age, sex, race, 
ethnicity, region, and Fontan fenestration. All 5 subjects with the occurrence of any thrombotic event 
in the study did not have any history of previous thrombotic event. 
There were no primary efficacy outcomes reported after Month 12 or after early discontinuation of 
study drug. 
PK/PD 
In general, the observed rivaroxaban concentrations in the paediatric subjects were within the range of 
corresponding values that were observed in adults after 5 mg twice daily (Studies ODIXa- HIP2 and 
ODIXa-KNEE) or 10 mg once daily (Study 11527) administration of rivaroxaban.

PopPK parameter estimates 
The observed plasma concentration-time data of rivaroxaban were adequately described by a 2-
compartment popPK linear model with diagnostic plots showing good model fit and minimal bias. The 
model was parameterized in terms of clearance (CL) estimated at 3.30 L/h, volume of distribution in 
the central compartment (Vc) estimated at 17.6 L, intercompartmental clearance (Q) estimated at 1.09 
L/h and volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment (Vp) estimated at 33.4 L/h. CL and Vc 
were scaled exponentially with body weight normalized by the median body weight (15 kg) and the 
exponent was estimated to be 1.01 and 1.20, respectively. The first-order absorption rate constant 
was estimated to be 1.12 /h. The bioavailability (F1) parameter included weight-normalized dose as a 
covariate, similar to the EINSTEIN Jr popPK model, which established that the dose-dependent 
bioavailability, F1, was adequately characterized by weight normalized dose as a covariate. 
Comparison of exposure metrics 
The rivaroxaban concentrations observed in this study were superimposed on the range of simulated 
concentrations from the adult reference Study 11527 (Figure 5-3). The adult reference range was 
defined as the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile range as observed in Study 11527, which enrolled adults who 
underwent total hip replacement, to establish exposure matching to the adult 10 mg once daily dose. 
The exposure metrics (AUC24h,ss, Cmax,ss, and Ctrough,ss) of rivaroxaban in this study are 
descriptively summarized in Table 5-1. The geometric mean AUC24h,ss, the primary PK metric for 
exposure matching, was similar between subjects in this study and the adult reference. Furthermore 
the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric means for these 2 groups largely overlapped. 
Since subjects in this study received a twice daily dosing regimen that was intended to match the 10 
mg once daily dosing in adults, the rivaroxaban concentrations in the paediatric subjects had a 
narrower range with slightly lower Cmax,ss and slightly higher Ctrough,ss in comparison to the adult 
reference ranges.

Individual results for main exposure metrics (AUC24h,ss, Cmax,ss, and Ctrough,ss) as a function of 
body weight from this study at a rivaroxaban 10 mg-equivalent regimen were compared with the adult 
reference at rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily (Figure 5-4). The AUC24h,ss values from this study were 
largely contained within the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile exposure range of the adult reference, indicating 
that the overall rivaroxaban exposures in subjects in this study were similar to those in adults. In 
addition, the overall PK characteristics were similar between this study and EINSTEIN Jr program, with 
exposure metrics (AUC24h,ss, Cmax,ss, and Ctrough,ss) largely overlapping with the paediatric 
prediction range based on the EINSTEIN Jr popPK model assuming 10 mg equivalent dose (Figure 5-4). 
Further analyses on a potential trend of exposure metrics as a function of age and/or body weight and 
in comparison to results from the EINSTEIN Jr program using popPK as well as PBPK modeling are still 
ongoing and will be reported under separate cover.

Pharmacodynamics 
Prothrombin time (Figure 6-1) and aPTT (Figure 6-2) profiles were compared between children who 
were enrolled in the UNIVERSE study and adults enrolled in studies ODIXa-HIP2 and ODIXa-KNEE. In 
general, PT values in the paediatric subjects were within the range of corresponding values that were 
observed in adults. A much wider range of aPTT values was observed in adult compared to paediatric 
subjects. A linear relationship was observed for PT in paediatric and adult subjects. The observed 
values for the paediatric subjects were contained within the 99% prediction interval based on adult 
data. Similar results were obtained based on the analysis of aPTT; however, the changes in aPTT as a 
function of rivaroxaban concentrations were smaller relative to the observed changes in PT. The 
change from baseline in PT also increased with an increase in plasma rivaroxaban concentrations,

regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

whereas the change from baseline in aPTT as a function of rivaroxaban concentration was much less 
evident. 
Anti-FXa activity displays a close relationship between with the plasma rivaroxaban concentrations as 
described by a simple linear model. The model has an intercept value of -3.14 (μg/L) and a slope of 
0.885. 
Correlation of exposure to study outcomes 
Within the rivaroxaban treatment arm, 2 thrombotic events were observed, including 1 venous 
thrombotic event in 1 subject and 1 pulmonary embolism in another subject. Bleeding events were 
observed in 27 subjects. Three subjects experienced multiple bleeding events and 24 subjects 
experienced 1 event. Among the bleeding events, there was 1 major bleeding, 5 clinically relevant non 
major bleeding, and 24 trivial bleeding events. Rivaroxaban exposure metrics (AUC24h,ss, Cmax,ss, 
and Ctrough,ss) were compared in subjects with or without thrombotic events (Figure 7-1) and in 
subjects with or without bleeding events (Figure 7-2). The ranges of AUC24h,ss, Cmax,ss, and

Ctrough,ss largely overlapped between subjects with or without thrombotic or bleeding events. These 
results suggest that within the exposure range studied, higher or lower rivaroxaban exposures are not 
likely to influence thrombosis or bleeding outcomes.

Safety results 
Bleeding events 
A major bleeding event, as adjudicated by CIAC, was seen in 1 (1.6%) subject in the rivaroxaban Part 
B group which occurred on Day 108 after first dose of study drug at a non-critical site (epistaxis). This 
bleeding was associated with a fall of haemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more and led to transfusion. As per 
protocol, the subject had to discontinue the study drug permanently. No major bleeding event was 
reported in either the ASA Part B or the rivaroxaban Part A groups. 
In Part B, the results for CRNM bleeding were similar amongst the treatment groups, with 4 (6.3%) 
subjects in the rivaroxaban group and 3 (8.8%) subjects in the ASA group. In the rivaroxaban Part B 
group, these events occurred in the lower gastrointestinal tract (2 [3.1%]), gingival (1 [1.6%]), and 
the skin (1 [1.6%]), and in the ASA Part B group, they occurred in the lower gastrointestinal tract (1 
[2.9%]), the skin (1 [2.9%]), hematoma (1 [2.9%]), and subconjunctival (1 [2.9%]). In the 
rivaroxaban Part A group, there was 1 (8.3%) subject reported with a CRNM bleeding event occurring 
in the skin. 
In Part B, the proportion of trivial bleeding events was similar between the rivaroxaban group with 21 
(32.8%) subjects and the ASA group with 12 (35.3%) subjects. The most frequent site of trivial 
bleeding was skin in both groups (14 [21.9%] in the rivaroxaban group and 8 [23.5%] in the ASA 
group). In the rivaroxaban Part A group, 3 (25.0%) subjects were reported with trivial bleeding events 
(the most frequently reported site was hematoma, 2 [16.7%]).

Summary of all adverse events 
Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as those AEs that started on or after the first dose of study 
drug and up to 2 days after the last dose of study drug. The incidences of TEAEs and TESAEs were 
balanced between the rivaroxaban and ASA groups in Part B. There were 55 (85.9%) and 29 (85.3%) 
subjects who experienced at least 1 TEAE and 18 (28.1%) and 8 (23.5%) subjects who experienced at 
least 1 TESAE in the rivaroxaban Part B group and in the ASA Part B group, respectively. In the 
rivaroxaban Part A group, there were 11 (91.7%) subjects with at least 1 TEAE and 6 (50.0%) 
subjects with at least 1 TESAE reported. 
There were 20 (31.3%) and 9 (26.5%) subjects in the rivaroxaban Part B group and in the ASA Part B 
group, respectively, who had AEs that were considered by the investigators to be related to study drug 
(most of them related to the reported bleeding events). Only 1 (1.6%) subject in the rivaroxaban Part 
B group had an SAE (major bleeding) that was considered by the investigator to be related to study 
drug. In the rivaroxaban Part A group, 3 (25.0%) subjects had AEs considered by the investigators to 
be related to study drug. Most AEs were in the SOC of Infections and Infestations and the Respiratory, 
Mediastinal Disorders; none were considered related to study drug by the investigators. 
In Part B, there were 11 (17.2%) subjects in the rivaroxaban group and 3 (8.8%) subjects in the ASA 
group with AEs that occurred off-treatment (events that occurred between 3 days after the study drug 
was stopped and the date of last study contact, inclusively).

Treatment-emergent adverse events 
Table 4-4 summarises TEAEs with >10% in either treatment group by system organ class and 
preferred term. The proportion of children with at least 1 TEAE was similar across all treatment groups. 
There were 55 (85.9%) and 29 (85.3%) subjects who experienced at least 1 TEAE in the rivaroxaban 
Part B group and in the ASA Part B group, respectively. There were 11 (91.7%) subjects who 
experienced at least 1 TEAE in the rivaroxaban Part A group. The most frequently reported TEAEs in 
Part B were pyrexia (23.4% in the rivaroxaban and 20.6% in the ASA Part B groups) and 
nasopharyngitis (21.9% in the rivaroxaban and 17.6% in the ASA Part B groups). Two (3.1%) subjects 
had TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation (1 with major bleeding and 1 with parental 
consent withdrawal due to mood disturbance) in the rivaroxaban Part B group. 
Infections and infestations was the system organ class with more frequently reported TEAEs in all 3 
groups (40 [62.5%] in rivaroxaban Part B group and 22 [64.7%] in ASA Part B group; and 8 [66.7%] 
in rivaroxaban Part A group). In Part B, TEAEs were, in general, balanced between the rivaroxaban and 
the ASA groups except for pleural effusion, which was more frequently reported in the rivaroxaban 
group than in the ASA group (12 [18.8%] versus 2 [5.9%]). 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported during the study. 
Serious adverse events 
Table 4-5 summarises TESAEs with >10% in either treatment group by system organ class and 
preferred term. There were 18 (28.1%) subjects, 8 (23.5%) subjects, and 6 (50.0%) subjects who 
experienced at least 1 TESAE in the rivaroxaban Part B group, ASA Part B group, and rivaroxaban Part 
A group, respectively. One (1.6%) subject in the rivaroxaban Part B group had an SAE (major 
bleeding) that was considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. Across all groups,

respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders was the system organ class with the most frequently 
reported TESAEs (9 [14.1%] in rivaroxaban Part B group. 
A total of 2 (3.1%) subjects in the rivaroxaban Part B group had at least 1 TEAE resulting in 
permanent discontinuation of study drug (Table 4-3). One (1.6%) subject was discontinued as per 
protocol due to reaching the primary safety outcome (major bleeding) and 1 (1.6%) subject was 
withdrawn by the parent due to the AE of mood disturbance.

Laboratory evaluation 
Haematology 
Overall, the majority of haematological parameters showed a minimal change from baseline to Month 
12. None of these changes were considered clinically significant by the investigators and were not 
reported as an AE for any subject in the study. No individual subjects had clinically significant 
abnormalities from baseline to Month 12 or ESMD for haematology. 
Chemistry 
The laboratory test results for chemistry parameters (ALP, ALT, AST, direct bilirubin, creatinine, and 
creatinine clearance adjusted for BSA) at baseline, at Month 12, and change from baseline to Month 12 
have been provided. The mean values of all the chemistry parameters did not show a considerable 
change from baseline to Month 12 in all the 3 groups. None of these changes were reported as an AE. 
One subject in the rivaroxaban Part B group had ALT >3×ULN at baseline (1/63 [1.6%]) but was 
eligible to participate in the study because of no concurrent total bilirubin >1.5x ULN, with direct 
bilirubin >20% of the total at screening. At Month 12, 1 subject (1/57 [1.8%]) had bilirubin >3×ULN 
in the rivaroxaban Part B group. It was not considered clinically significant and was not reported as an 
AE or SAE. There were no subjects with pre-specified combined laboratory abnormalities for ALT and 
bilirubin. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This procedure concerns the final study results from study 18226 (“UNIVERSE”), a prospective, open-
label, active-controlled study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and 
efficacy of rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis in paediatric subjects 2 to 8 years of age after the 
Fontan procedure, using acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) as active control.  
The Fontan operation is a palliative surgical procedure performed in children with a functional or 
anatomic single ventricle. It is the most common operation performed for patients with any type of 
single ventricle and is the definitive surgical palliation for patients with congenital heart disease in 
which septation into a biventricular system is not possible. Following the Fontan procedure, systemic 
venous blood is returned to the lungs without a separate pump; instead, pulmonary blood flow is 
driven by central venous pressure. However, complications are frequent; apart from periprocedural 
complications, long-term morbidity include heart failure, arrhythmia, venous congestion with 
decreased perfusion causing protein-losing enteropathy and plastic bronchitis, liver failure and 
thromboembolism. Patients with Fontan circulation are at risk for both systemic and pulmonary 
thromboembolic events given the low flow in the Fontan circuit and associated alterations in levels of 
clotting and fibrinolysis factors, with a reported prevalence ranging from 2 to 33 percent. However, 
patients with Fontan circulation are also at risk for bleeding complications, and the optimal 
antithrombotic strategy in patients with Fontan circulation has not yet been determined. (Johnson J et 
al. Management of complications in patients with Fontan circulation. In UpToDate, Post, TW (Ed), 
UpToDate, Waltham, MA, 2021) Current guidelines suggest ASA for all patients with Fontan circulation, 
with anticoagulation reserved for those with presumed risk factors or previous thrombosis or older 
patients (Giglia TM et al. Prevention and treatment of thrombosis in pediatric and congenital heart 
disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association. Circulation. 2013;128:2622–
2703). 
Study 18226 consisted of 2 parts. Part A was 12-month, single-arm, with a 12-day initial PK, PD, and 
safety assessment period prior to continuing 12 months of open-label rivaroxaban therapy. Subjects in 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/214680/2021  
Page 29/32 
 
 
 
 
Part A did not participate in Part B. Randomization in Part B began once the cumulative data from the 
initial PK, PD, and Safety Assessment Period in Part A were deemed acceptable; this was the 2-arm, 
randomised, open-label, active-controlled part of the study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
rivaroxaban compared to ASA for thromboprophylaxis for 12 months. Eligible patients were children 2 
to 8 years of age with single ventricle physiology who had completed the Fontan procedure within 4 
months prior to enrolment. Patients with evidence of thrombosis, protein-losing enteropathy, active 
bleeding or high risk for bleeding and patients with an indication for anticoagulant or antiplatelet 
therapy other than current study were excluded, however, subjects who had been treated with VKA, 
ASA, heparin or LMWH after the Fontan procedure were eligible provided that such treatment was 
discontinued before screening or starting study drug. Rivaroxaban was supplied as 0.1% (1 mg/mL) 
oral suspension with target exposure matching to that of rivaroxaban 10 mg total daily dose (oral) in 
adults. For reference therapy, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) was supplied as 81 mg or 100 mg tablets for 
oral administration. The use of ASA as active control appears in line with current guidelines. In general, 
given the recruitment difficulties in paediatric studies on thromboses, such studies are not expected to 
be powered to demonstrate statistically significant results; however, this relies on the ability to 
extrapolate adult data to the paediatric population. There is no approved adult indication for 
rivaroxaban pertaining to similar surgery as the Fontan procedure; for primary prophylaxis of venous 
thromboses, rivaroxaban is approved for hip and knee replacement surgery only. Rivaroxaban is not 
approved as single-therapy for prevention of arterial events in adults; it is approved in addition to ASA 
for prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndrome and in 
coronary artery disease/peripheral artery disease at high risk of ischaemic events. Further assessment 
of the overall study design and the ability to extrapolate adult data to paediatric subjects for primary 
prevention of thrombosis will be required. 
More than 95% of the 112 enrolled subjects completed the study. Eleven (10.0%) subjects 
discontinued study treatment prematurely (5 [7.8%] in the rivaroxaban Part B group and 4 [11.8%] in 
the ASA Part B group; and 2 [16.7%] subjects in the rivaroxaban Part A group). It is noted that the 
premature discontinuations in the rivaroxaban part A were due to reaching an AUC at steady state 
above the pre-specified upper threshold of the target AUC range. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics were overall balanced between the rivaroxaban and the 
ASA groups. The rivaroxaban Part A group had a younger mean (SD) age (2.5 [0.67] years), a lower 
mean weight, and a shorter median duration between the Fontan procedure and first dose than both 
groups in Part B.  
The primary efficacy outcome was evaluated as any venous or arterial thrombotic event, which was 
defined as the appearance of a new thrombotic burden within the CV system on either routine 
surveillance or clinically indicated imaging, or the occurrence of a clinical event known to be strongly 
associated with thrombus (such as cardioembolic stroke, pulmonary embolism). Overall, very few 
thrombotic events were reported during the study, which could limit the ability to assess efficacy; a 
clear justification for the appropriateness of extrapolating adult efficacy data to the paediatric 
population in primary prevention of post-surgical thrombotic events needs to be provided. In total 2 
thrombotic events occurred in the rivaroxaban Part A + B groups (2/76 or 2.6%), one pulmonary 
embolism and one venous thrombosis. In the ASA group, there were 3 thrombotic events (3/34 or 
8.8%), one ischaemic stroke and two venous thromboses. There was no apparent relation between 
anti-FXa activity and thrombotic events, which is in line with previous rivaroxaban data, also for 
paediatric subjects, however the low number of thrombotic events in this study precludes any firm 
conclusions. The primary efficacy outcome by subgroup analysis did not show any trends for age, sex, 
race, ethnicity, region, and Fontan fenestration; however, given the small study size and the low 
number of thrombotic events, subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution. There were no

primary efficacy outcomes reported after Month 12 or after early discontinuation of study drug, thus, 
there was no apparent rebound phenomenon after study drug cessation. 
For PK/PD, in general, the observed rivaroxaban concentrations in the paediatric subjects were within 
the range of corresponding values that were observed in adults after 5 mg twice daily or 10 mg once 
daily administration of rivaroxaban. The overall PK characteristics were similar between this study and 
the EINSTEIN Jr program (which was assessed in the recently approved paediatric extension and type 
II variation EMEA/H/C/000944/X/0074/G), with exposure metrics (AUC24h,ss, Cmax,ss, and 
Ctrough,ss) largely overlapping with the paediatric prediction range based on the EINSTEIN Jr popPK 
model assuming 10 mg equivalent dose. In general, prothrombin time values in the paediatric subjects 
were within the range of corresponding values that were observed in adults in the hip and knee 
replacement studies, with a linear relationship. A much wider range of aPTT values was observed in 
adult compared to paediatric subjects. The change from baseline in PT also increased with an increase 
in plasma rivaroxaban concentrations, whereas the change from baseline in aPTT as a function of 
rivaroxaban concentration was much less evident; this is also in line with previous rivaroxaban PD 
data. As expected, anti-FXa activity displayed a close relationship between with the plasma 
rivaroxaban concentrations as described by a simple linear model. Within the exposure range studied, 
higher or lower rivaroxaban exposures were not associated with thrombosis or bleeding outcomes. 
For safety, a major bleeding event was seen in 1 (1.6%) subject in the rivaroxaban Part B group (Day 
108 after study drug initiation; epistaxis associated with a fall of haemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more and 
led to transfusion). There was no difference in CRNM bleeding and trivial bleeding amongst the 
treatment groups. No deaths occurred during the study. 
There were 55 (85.9%) and 29 (85.3%) subjects who experienced at least 1 TEAE and 18 (28.1%) 
and 8 (23.5%) subjects who experienced at least 1 TESAE in the rivaroxaban Part B group and in the 
ASA Part B group, respectively. There were 20 (31.3%) and 9 (26.5%) subjects in the rivaroxaban Part 
B group and in the ASA Part B group, respectively, who had AEs that were considered by the 
investigators to be related to study drug (most of them related to bleeding events). 
In Part B, TEAEs of pleural effusion were more frequently reported in the rivaroxaban group than in the 
ASA group (12 [18.8%] versus 2 [5.9%]). In Part A (all rivaroxaban-treated), 2 (16.7%) serious 
TEAEs of pleural effusion occurred. Notably, there was a higher proportion of subjects with a history of 
pleural effusions in the ASA group (4/34 vs 4/66 in the rivaroxaban part B group). For Part A, all 
events of pleural effusions occurred within 10 days after the Fontan procedure. For Part B, treatment 
emergent pleural effusions in rivaroxaban treated subjects predominantly occurred within 10 days of 
the Fontan procedure, but additional events occurred 10-<30, 30-<60 and more than 90 days after 
the Fontan procedure. For Part B, both events of pleural effusions in the ASA group occurred within 10 
days after the Fontan procedure. Based on the data from study 14372 (Einstein Jr; children with VTE), 
there was no apparent imbalance with regards to pleural effusion in that study; there were slightly 
more respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders reported in the rivaroxaban group, 81/329 
(24.6%) vs 34/162 (21.0%) in comparator group. Of these, however, pleural effusion was rare, 
reported in 2 children (0.6%) in the rivaroxaban group and 1 (0.6%) in the comparator group; 1 event 
of pleurisy was also reported in the rivaroxaban group (0.3%). During the entire study period 
(including extended treatment periods), one additional case of pleural effusion was reported in the 
rivaroxaban group. (source: CSR for Study 14372, tables 14.3.2.1/15 and 14.3.2.1/19) Taking these 
data into account, the findings of the study 18226 are considered primarily related to the specific 
population studied (children who have recently undergone a Fontan procedure) which are not covered 
by the currently approved indications for rivaroxaban. The imbalance between treatment groups should 
be further addressed ; of note, although pleural effusions could be relatively common after the Fontan 
surgical procedure, such events could contribute significantly to morbidity and prolonged

hospitalization. It is important to consider whether the pleural effusions were further characterised 
including any analyses of pleural fluid, whether haemothorax was adequately excluded, any relation 
between rivaroxaban-concentration and pleural effusion, the proportion of patients with pleural 
effusion and concomitant bleeding and/or anaemia, a thorough discussion on pre-existing or 
periprocedural risk factors that could have contributed to the development of pleural effusion and a 
pathophysiological discussion on whether FXa inhibition could predispose for non-haemothorax causes 
of pleural effusion. 
No adverse events of special interest were reported during study 18226 (such events included 
suspected toxic effect on the bone marrow including severe thrombocytopenia, severe neutropenia, 
pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia; suspected severe hypersensitivity reaction, severe skin reactions, 
suspected severe liver injury and concurrent elevations of ALT >5x ULN and total bilirubin >2x ULN). 
On a group level, there were no substantial changes in laboratory haematology parameters from 
baseline to Month 12. It is noted that there was an increase in alkaline phosphatase levels in both 
treatment groups (median values in rivaroxaban and ASA at baseline: 166 and 149 respectively; after 
12 months 259 and 266 respectively). Since there were no imbalances between the treatment groups, 
this is not further pursued within this procedure. There was no significant increase in AST, ALT or 
bilirubin in any of the treatment groups. 
Overall, there were no emergent safety findings that are considered to warrant any regulatory action 
at this time point. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No further regulatory action required. 
With this procedure, the Xarelto MAH has provided the results from study 18226, a prospective, open-
label, active-controlled study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and 
efficacy of rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis in paediatric subjects 2 to 8 years of age after the 
Fontan procedure, using acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) as active control.  
Xarelto was recently approved for paediatric use (procedure EMEA/H/C/000944/X/0074/G) in children 
with venous thrombosis. The results from study 18226 are noted. The following points remain to be 
addressed : the ability to extrapolate adult data on primary prevention of thrombotic events to the 
paediatric population, and the imbalance between treatment groups (rivaroxaban vs ASA) with regards 
to pleural effusions; aspects to consider include whether the pleural effusions were further 
characterised including any analyses of pleural fluid, whether haemothorax was adequately excluded, 
the proportion of patients with pleural effusion and concomitant bleeding and/or anaemia, any relation 
between rivaroxaban-concentration and pleural effusion, a thorough discussion on pre-existing or 
periprocedural risk factors that could have contributed to the development of pleural effusion in this 
study and a pathophysiological discussion focusing on whether FXa inhibition could predispose for non-
haemothorax causes of pleural effusion. 
There were no emergent safety findings from this study that are considered to warrant any regulatory 
action at this time point.

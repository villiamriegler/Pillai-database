On 15 November 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Orkambi. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Europe) 
Ltd. 
The CHMP recommended the approval of two new presentations of Orkambi (100 mg/125 mg and 
150 mg/188 mg granules in sachet) for use in children aged 2 years and older. The currently authorised 
presentations (100 mg/125 mg and 200 mg/125 mg tablets) are for children aged 6 years and above. 
The full indication for the new Orkambi granules will be: 
“Orkambi granules are indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in children aged 2 years and older 
who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene”. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

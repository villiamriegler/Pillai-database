SmPC new text: 
subgroup analysis from CCTL019B2401 (B2401) 
disease registry listed as a PAES (ANX006) in the 
Annex II; this is a non-interventional study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of Kymriah in ALL 
patients below the age of 3 years. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
Annex II.D of the SmPC to reflect the fulfilment of 
the PAES. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

Annex II 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC: 
Paediatric population 
The safety of tisagenlecleucel in r/r B-cell ALL paediatric 
patients from 3 years of age and older was assessed in 212 
patients in the pivotal study B2202 and the supportive 
studies B2205J and B2001X in which the majority of 
patients (81%) were under 18 years old (65/79 in B2202, 
54/64 in B2205 and 52/69 in B2001X). The frequency, type 
and severity of adverse reactions in paediatric patients are 
reflected in “Summary of the safety profile” and in Table 2 
above. 
The safety of tisagenlecleucel in r/r B-cell ALL paediatric 
patients below 3 years of age was assessed in the 
observational study B2401 (n=43) where the overall safety 
experience was generally consistent with the known safety 
profile of tisagenlecleucel. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC: 
Study B2401 
An observational study (B2401) was conducted to collect 
long-term safety and efficacy data in patients infused with 
tisagenlecleucel from the Center for International Blood and 
Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) and European 
Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) 
registries. The study included 617 (CIBMTR: 570; EBMT: 
47) paediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL 
at time of the data cut off. Kymriah manufacture for 
patients below 3 years of age and with low weight was 
Page 4/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
feasible; 43 patients (CIBMTR: 40, EBMT: 3) were below 3 
years of age at time of infusion. The median time from 
Kymriah infusion to the data cut off date of the paediatric 
and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL was 11.8 
months for CIBMTR and 9.0 months for EBMT. 
Among the patients below 3 years of age included in the 
efficacy set (n=33), CR (including CRi) as BOR was 
reported for 26 patients (78.8%) (95% CI: 61.1, 91.0) and 
all 15 patients in CR (including CRi) and with reported MRD 
data were MRD negative during follow-up. The estimated 
DOR rate at month 12 was 62.7% (95% CI: 35.0, 81.3).  
The overall safety experience in patients below 3 years of 
age with r/r B-cell ALL was generally consistent with the 
known safety profile of tisagenlecleucel.

The existing warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC related to 
patients that had received prior anti-CD 19 therapy has 
been updated to include that ‘while activity of 
tisagenlecleucel has been observed (in patients previously 
exposed to CD 19 directed therapy), data are currently too 
limited to make an adequate assessment of the benefit-risk 
profile in these patients.’ 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the 
updated safety data from studies B2202, B2205J and 
B2001X.

Kymriah manufacturing in the clinical study. The median 
duration of study follow-up defined as the time from 
Kymriah infusion to the date of completion or 
discontinuation from follow-up prior to the data cut-off date 
in the final analyses was 12.2 months (range: 0.4-49.3). 
The median time from Kymriah infusion to the data cut-off 
date was 31.7 months (range: 17.6-56.0). 
Among the patients infused, the median age was 12.5 
years (range: 3 to 25), 34 (53.1%) were female and 30 
(46.9%) were male, 10.9% had primary refractory disease, 
89.1% had relapsed disease, and 43.8% of patients had at 
least one prior haematopoietic stem cell transplant. 
Baseline disease characteristics were similar in the enrolled 
patients with regard to age (median age 13.0 years, range: 
3 to 25), gender (46.7% female and 53.3% male), primary 
refractoriness (10.7%), and prior transplant history 
(42.7%). The majority of infused patients (57/64, 89.1%) 
received bridging chemotherapy while waiting for Kymriah. 
A total of 60 out of 64 patients (93.8%) who received 
Kymriah infusion also received lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy after enrolment and prior to infusion of a 
single dose of Kymriah. 
Efficacy was established through the primary endpoint of 
ORR, which included best overall response as CR or CRi 
that were maintained for at least 28 days within 6 months 
post infusion, as determined by IRC assessment, as well as 
secondary endpoints including DOR, proportion of patients 
who achieved CR or CRi with MRD negative disease status, 
and OS. Among the patients infused, ORR was 
Page 15/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
demonstrated in 45 patients (70.3%; 59.4% CR and 10.9% 
CRi). CR/CRi with MRD negative bone marrow was reported 
in 43 patients (67.2%). The median DOR was not reached 
and the event free probability at 12 months was 70.5%. 
The survival probability at 24 months was 54.7%, and the 
median OS was estimated as 29.9 months (95% CI: 15.1, 
42.4). The OS results were confirmed in an updated OS 
analyses (i.e. median OS 29.9 months [95% CI: 15.2, NE] 
with 57.6% survival probability at 24 months; with a 
median follow up for OS of 25.9 months), which included 
patients transitioned to a separate long term follow up 
study. Seven patients (10.9%) who achieved CR/CRi after 
Kymriah infusion proceeded to haematopoietic stem cell 
transplant while in remission during the study, of which 5 
of the patients (7.8%) proceeded to transplant within the 
first 6 months post infusion. Efficacy results reported for 
the enrolled patients (n=75) demonstrate an ORR of 60.0% 
(50.7% CR and 9.3% CRi; 57.3% with MRD negative bone 
marrow). The reported overall survival in the enrolled 
population is in accordance with the infused population.

This variation now clarifies that the indication also covers 
II and PL 
patients aged 25 years inclusive with B cell acute 
Submission of a group of 3 type II variations (C.I.4) 
to include: 
- Long-term efficacy and safety of Kymriah in 
relapsed/refractory DLBCL based on the 24 months 
follow-up results from study CCTL019C2201 (update 
of sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC) 
- Interim results from study CCTL019B2202 (update 
of sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC) 
- Interim results from study CCTL019B2205J (update 
section 5.2 of the SmPC) 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to clarify the wording of the indication to 
include patients over 25 years of age and to 
introduce some minor editorial corrections 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and that two doses of 
tocilizumab should be available for use in the event of 
cytokine release syndrome and emergency equipment must 
be available per patient prior to infusion. The treatment 
centre must have access to additional doses of tocilizumab 
within 8 hours. Updated data are provided in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC for study B2202 and C2201 as well as updated 
data are also provided in section 5.2 of the SmPC. In 
addition, updates are being made to the sections 2.2 and 
6.5 of the SmPC, the Package Leaflet and the Labelling to 
clarify accommodate the administration of additional

throughout the SmPC and the Package Leaflet. The 
MAH also updated sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 of the 
SmPC, Annex II and the Package Leaflet with regards 
to the acceptability of having 1 dose of tocilizumab 
per patient per centre for the management of 
cytokine release syndrome.  
In addition, the MAH requested updates to sections 
2.2 and 6.5 of the SmPC, the labelling and to the 
package leaflet to accommodate the administration 
of additional infusion bags, when applicable.  
The requested group of variations proposed 
amendments to the Summary of Product

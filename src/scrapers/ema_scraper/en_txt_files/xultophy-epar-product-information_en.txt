CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Xultophy is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus 
to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise in addition to other oral medicinal 
products for the treatment of diabetes. For study results with respect to combinations, effects on 
glycaemic control, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Xultophy is given once daily by subcutaneous administration. Xultophy can be administered at any 
time of the day, preferably at the same time of the day. 
Xultophy is to be dosed in accordance with the individual patient’s needs. It is recommended to 
optimise glycaemic control via dose adjustment based on fasting plasma glucose.  
Adjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their 
usual diet or during concomitant illness. 
Patients who forget a dose are advised to take it upon discovery and then resume their usual once-daily 
dosing schedule. A minimum of 8 hours between injections should always be ensured. This also 
applies when administration at the same time of the day is not possible. 
Xultophy is administered as dose steps. One dose step contains 1 unit of insulin degludec and 
0.036 mg of liraglutide. The pre-filled pen can provide from 1 up to 50 dose steps in one injection in 
increments of one dose step. The maximum daily dose of Xultophy is 50 dose steps (50 units insulin 
degludec and 1.8 mg liraglutide). The dose counter on the pen shows the number of dose steps.

Add-on to oral glucose-lowering medicinal products 
The recommended starting dose of Xultophy is 10 dose steps (10 units insulin degludec and 0.36 mg 
liraglutide).  
Xultophy can be added to existing oral antidiabetic treatment. When Xultophy is added to sulfonylurea 
therapy, a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea should be considered (see section 4.4). 
Transfer from GLP-1 receptor agonist 
Therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists should be discontinued prior to initiation of Xultophy. When 
transferring from a GLP-1 receptor agonist, the recommended starting dose of Xultophy is 16 dose 
steps (16 units insulin degludec and 0.6 mg liraglutide) (see section 5.1). The recommended starting 
dose should not be exceeded. If transferring from a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist (e.g. once-
weekly dosing), the prolonged action should be considered. Treatment with Xultophy should be 
initiated at the moment the next dose of the long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist would have been 
taken. Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the following weeks. 
Transfer from any insulin regimen that includes a basal insulin component 
Therapy with other insulin regimens should be discontinued prior to initiation of Xultophy. When 
transferring from any other insulin therapy that includes a basal insulin component, the recommended 
starting dose of Xultophy is 16 dose steps (16 units insulin degludec and 0.6 mg liraglutide) (see 
section 4.4 and 5.1). The recommended starting dose should not be exceeded, but may be reduced to 
avoid hypoglycaemia in selected cases. Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer 
and in the following weeks.  
Special populations 
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years old) 
Xultophy can be used in elderly patients. Glucose monitoring is to be intensified and the dose adjusted 
on an individual basis.  
Renal impairment  
When Xultophy is used in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, glucose 
monitoring is to be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis. Xultophy cannot be 
recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment  
Xultophy can be used in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Glucose monitoring is to 
be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis.  
Due to the liraglutide component, Xultophy is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population  
There is no relevant use of Xultophy in the paediatric population.  
Method of administration 
Xultophy is for subcutaneous use only. Xultophy must not be administered intravenously or 
intramuscularly. 
Xultophy is administered subcutaneously by injection in the thigh, the upper arm or the abdomen. 
Injection sites should always be rotated within the same region in order to reduce the risk of 
lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). For further instructions on 
administration, see section 6.6. 
Xultophy must not be drawn from the cartridge of the pre-filled pen into a syringe (see section 4.4). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be instructed to always use a new needle. The re-use of insulin pen needles increases 
the risk of blocked needles, which may cause under- or overdosing. In the event of blocked needles, 
patients must follow the instructions described in the instructions for use accompanying the package 
leaflet (see section 6.6). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to either or both active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Xultophy should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic 
ketoacidosis. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the dose of Xultophy is higher than required. Omission of a meal or 
unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. In combination with sulfonylurea, 
the risk of hypoglycaemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea. Concomitant 
diseases in the kidney, liver or diseases affecting the adrenal, pituitary or thyroid gland may require 
changes of the Xultophy dose. Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved (e.g. by 
intensified therapy) may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and 
must be advised accordingly. Usual warning symptoms (see section 4.8) of hypoglycaemia may 
disappear in patients with long-standing diabetes. The prolonged effect of Xultophy may delay 
recovery from hypoglycaemia. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Inadequate dosing and/or discontinuation of antidiabetic treatment may lead to hyperglycaemia and 
potentially to hyperosmolar coma. In case of discontinuation of Xultophy, ensure that instruction for 
initiation of alternative antidiabetic treatment is followed. Furthermore, concomitant illness, especially 
infections, may lead to hyperglycaemia and thereby cause an increased requirement for antidiabetic 
treatment. Usually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop gradually over a period of hours or 
days. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry 
skin, dry mouth, and loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath.  
Administration of rapid-acting insulin should be considered in situations of severe hyperglycaemia. 
Untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to hyperosmolar coma/diabetic ketoacidosis, which 
is potentially lethal. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site from an affected to an 
unaffected area, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
Combination of pioglitazone and insulin medicinal products 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin 
medicinal products, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac failure. This 
should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Xultophy is considered. 
If the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight 
gain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms 
occurs.

Eye disorder 
Intensification of therapy with insulin, a component of Xultophy, with abrupt improvement in 
glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy, while long-
term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. 
Antibody formation 
Administration of Xultophy may cause formation of antibodies against insulin degludec and/or 
liraglutide. In rare cases, the presence of such antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the Xultophy 
dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia. Very few patients developed insulin 
degludec specific antibodies, antibodies cross-reacting to human insulin or anti-liraglutide antibodies 
following treatment with Xultophy. Antibody formation has not been associated with reduced efficacy 
of Xultophy. 
Acute pancreatitis 
Acute pancreatitis has been observed with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide. 
Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is 
suspected, Xultophy should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, Xultophy should not be 
restarted.  
Thyroid adverse events 
Thyroid adverse events, such as goitre have been reported in clinical trials with GLP-1 receptor 
agonists including liraglutide, and in particular in patients with pre-existing thyroid disease. Xultophy 
should therefore be used with caution in these patients.  
Inflammatory bowel disease and diabetic gastroparesis 
There is no experience with Xultophy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and diabetic 
gastroparesis. Xultophy is therefore not recommended in these patients.  
Dehydration 
Signs and symptoms of dehydration, including renal impairment and acute renal failure have been 
reported in clinical trials with GLP-1 receptor agonists including liraglutide, a component of Xultophy. 
Patients treated with Xultophy should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to 
gastrointestinal side effects and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. 
Avoidance of medication errors 
Patients must be instructed to always check the pen label before each injection to avoid accidental 
mix-ups between Xultophy and other injectable diabetes medicinal products. 
Patients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the 
requirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who 
are blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who 
has good vision and is trained in using the insulin device. 
To avoid dosing errors and potential overdose, patients and healthcare professionals should never use a 
syringe to draw the medicinal product from the cartridge in the pre-filled pen. 
In the event of blocked needles, patients must follow the instructions described in the instructions for 
use accompanying the package leaflet (see section 6.6).

Populations not studied 
Transfer to Xultophy from doses of basal insulin < 20 and > 50 units has not been studied. 
There is no therapeutic experience in patients with congestive heart failure New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) class IV and Xultophy is therefore not recommended for use in these patients. 
Excipients 
Xultophy contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, therefore the medicinal product is 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Interaction studies with Xultophy have not been performed.  
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of Xultophy. 
The following substances may reduce the Xultophy requirement: 
Antidiabetic medicinal products, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), beta-blockers, angiotensin 
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids and sulfonamides. 
The following substances may increase the Xultophy requirement: 
Oral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth 
hormones and danazol. 
Beta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
Octreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the Xultophy requirement. 
Alcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of Xultophy. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
In vitro data suggest that the potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions related to CYP interaction 
and protein binding is low for both liraglutide and insulin degludec. 
The small delay of gastric emptying with liraglutide may influence absorption of concomitantly 
administered oral medicinal products. Interaction studies did not show any clinically relevant delay of 
absorption.  
Warfarin and other coumarin derivatives 
No interaction study has been performed. A clinically relevant interaction with active substances with 
poor solubility or with narrow therapeutic index such as warfarin cannot be excluded. Upon initiation 
of Xultophy treatment in patients on warfarin or other coumarin derivatives more frequent monitoring 
of INR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended. 
Paracetamol  
Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure of paracetamol following a single dose of 1 000 mg. 
Paracetamol Cmax was decreased by 31% and median tmax was delayed up to 15 min. No dose 
adjustment for concomitant use of paracetamol is required. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atorvastatin 
Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure of atorvastatin to a clinical relevant degree following 
single dose administration of atorvastatin 40 mg. Therefore, no dose adjustment of atorvastatin is 
required when given with liraglutide. Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38% and median tmax was 
delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide. 
Griseofulvin 
Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure of griseofulvin following administration of a single 
dose of griseofulvin 500 mg. Griseofulvin Cmax increased by 37% while median tmax did not change. 
Dose adjustments of griseofulvin and other compounds with low solubility and high permeability are 
not required. 
Digoxin 
A single dose administration of digoxin 1 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC 
by 16%; Cmax decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximum concentration (tmax) was delayed 
from 1 h to 1.5 h. No dose adjustment of digoxin is required based on these results. 
Lisinopril 
A single dose administration of lisinopril 20 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril 
AUC by 15%; Cmax decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median tmax was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with 
liraglutide. No dose adjustment of lisinopril is required based on these results. 
Oral contraceptives 
Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12 and 13%, respectively, following 
administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product. Tmax was delayed by 1.5 h with 
liraglutide for both compounds. There was no clinically relevant effect on the overall exposure of 
either ethinylestradiol or levonorgestrel. The contraceptive effect is therefore anticipated to be 
unaffected when co-administered with liraglutide. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There is no clinical experience with the use of Xultophy, insulin degludec or liraglutide in pregnant 
women. If a patient wishes to become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, treatment with Xultophy should 
be discontinued. 
Animal reproduction studies with insulin degludec have not revealed any differences between insulin 
degludec and human insulin regarding embryotoxicity and teratogenicity. Animal studies with 
liraglutide have shown reproductive toxicity, see section 5.3. The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. 
Breast-feeding 
There is no clinical experience with the use of Xultophy during breast-feeding. It is not known 
whether insulin degludec or liraglutide is excreted in human milk. Because of lack of experience, 
Xultophy should not be used during breast-feeding.  
In rats, insulin degludec was secreted in milk; the concentration in milk was lower than in plasma. 
Animal studies have shown that the transfer of liraglutide and metabolites of close structural 
relationship into milk was low. Non-clinical studies with liraglutide have shown a treatment-related 
reduction of neonatal growth in suckling rat pups (see section 5.3). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
There is no clinical experience with Xultophy in relation to fertility.  
Animal reproduction studies with insulin degludec have not revealed any adverse effects on fertility. 
Apart from a slight decrease in the number of live implants, animal studies with liraglutide did not 
indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may 
constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using 
machines). 
Patients must be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is particularly 
important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or 
have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be considered in these 
circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile  
The Xultophy clinical development programme included approximately 1,900 patients treated with 
Xultophy.  
The most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment with Xultophy were hypoglycaemia 
and gastrointestinal adverse reactions (see section ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions associated with Xultophy are given below, listed by system organ class and

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the Xultophy dose is higher than required. Severe hypoglycaemia may 
lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of 
brain function or even death. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may 
include cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or 
weakness, confusion, difficulty in concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, 
headache, nausea and palpitation. For frequencies of hypoglycaemia, please see section 5.1. 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions (manifested with signs and symptoms such as urticaria (0.3% of patients treated 
with Xultophy), rash (0.7%), pruritus (0.5%) and/or swelling of the face (0.2%)) have been reported 
for Xultophy. Few cases of anaphylactic reactions with additional symptoms such as hypotension, 
palpitations, dyspnoea, and oedema have been reported during marketed use of liraglutide. 
Anaphylactic reactions may potentially be life threatening.  
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions may occur more frequently at the beginning of Xultophy therapy 
and usually diminish within a few days or weeks on continued treatment. Nausea was reported in 7.8% 
of patients and was transient in nature for most patients. The proportion of patients reporting nausea 
per week at any point during treatment was below 4%. Diarrhoea and vomiting were reported in 7.5% 
and 3.9% of patients, respectively. The frequency of nausea and diarrhoea was ‘Common’ for 
Xultophy and ‘Very common’ for liraglutide. In addition, constipation, dyspepsia, gastritis, abdominal 
pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal distension, eructation, flatulence and decreased 
appetite have been reported in up to 3.6% of patients treated with Xultophy.  
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions (including injection site haematoma, pain, haemmorrhage, erythema, nodules, 
swelling, discolouration, pruritus, warmth and injection site mass) have been reported in 2.6% of 
patients treated with Xultophy. These reactions were usually mild and transitory and they normally 
disappear during continued treatment. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the 
injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the 
given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
Increased heart rate  
Mean increase in heart rate from baseline of 2 to 3 beats per minute has been observed in clinical trials 
with Xultophy. In the LEADER trial, no long-term clinical impact of increased heart rate on the risk of 
cardiovascular events was observed with liraglutide (a component of Xultophy) (see section 5.1). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Limited data are available with regard to overdose of Xultophy.  
Hypoglycaemia may develop if a patient is dosed with more Xultophy than required: 
• 
• 
Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or other products 
containing sugar. It is therefore recommended that the patient always carries sugar-containing 
products 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient is not able to treat himself, can be treated 
with glucagon given intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intranasally by a trained person, or with 
glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given intravenously 
if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining 
consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in order to 
prevent a relapse. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, long-acting. 
ATC code: A10AE56  
Mechanism of action 
Xultophy is a combination product consisting of insulin degludec and liraglutide having 
complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control. 
Insulin degludec is a basal insulin that forms soluble multi-hexamers upon subcutaneous injection, 
resulting in a depot from which insulin degludec is continuously and slowly absorbed into the 
circulation leading to a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect of insulin degludec with a low day-to-
day variability in insulin action. 
Insulin degludec binds specifically to the human insulin receptor and results in the same 
pharmacological effects as human insulin.  
The blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin degludec is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose 
following the binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition 
of glucose output from the liver. 
Liraglutide is a Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with 97% sequence homology to human 
GLP-1 that binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Following subcutaneous 
administration, the protracted action profile is based on three mechanisms: self-association, which 
results in slow absorption; binding to albumin; and higher enzymatic stability towards the dipeptidyl 
peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) enzymes, resulting in a long plasma half-life. 
Liraglutide action is mediated via a specific interaction with GLP-1 receptors and improves glycaemic 
control by lowering fasting and postprandial blood glucose. Liraglutide stimulates insulin secretion 
and lowers inappropriately high glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Thus, when blood 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
glucose is high, insulin secretion is stimulated and glucagon secretion is inhibited. Conversely, during 
hypoglycaemia liraglutide diminishes insulin secretion and does not impair glucagon secretion. The 
mechanism of blood glucose-lowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying.  
Liraglutide reduces body weight and body fat mass through mechanisms involving reduced hunger and 
lowered energy intake. 
GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake, but the exact mechanism of action is 
not entirely clear. In animal studies, peripheral administration of liraglutide led to uptake in specific 
brain regions involved in regulation of appetite, where liraglutide, via specific activation of the GLP-
1R, increased key satiety and decreased key hunger signals, thereby leading to lower body weight. 
GLP-1 receptors are also expressed in specific locations in the heart, vasculature, immune system, and 
kidneys. In mouse models of atherosclerosis, liraglutide prevented aortic plaque progression and 
reduced inflammation in the plaque. In addition, liraglutide had a beneficial effect on plasma lipids. 
Liraglutide did not reduce the plaque size of already established plaques. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Xultophy has a stable pharmacodynamic profile with a duration of action reflecting the combination of 
the individual action profiles of insulin degludec and liraglutide that allows for administration of 
Xultophy once daily at any time of the day with or without meals. Xultophy improves glycaemic 
control through the sustained lowering of fasting plasma glucose levels and postprandial glucose levels 
after all meals.  
Postprandial glucose reduction was confirmed in a 4 hour standardised meal test substudy in patients 
uncontrolled on metformin alone or in combination with pioglitazone. Xultophy decreased the 
postprandial plasma glucose excursion (mean over 4 hours) significantly more than insulin degludec. 
The results were similar for Xultophy and liraglutide. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The safety and efficacy of Xultophy were evaluated in seven randomised, controlled, parallel group 
phase 3 trials in different populations of subjects with type 2 diabetes defined by previous antidiabetes 
treatment. Comparator treatments comprised basal insulin, GLP-1 RA therapy, placebo and a basal 
bolus regimen. The trials were of 26 weeks duration randomising between 199 and 833 patients to 
Xultophy. One study was further extended to 52 weeks. In all trials, the starting dose was given 
according to label and a twice-weekly titration regimen for Xultophy was used (see Table 2). The 
same titration algorithm was applied for basal insulin comparators. In six studies, Xultophy produced 
clinically and statistically significant improvements in glycaemic control versus comparators as 
measured by glycated haemaglobin A1c (HbA1c), whereas one study demonstrated a similar reduction 
of HbA1c in both treatment arms.

Glycaemic control 
Add-on to oral glucose-lowering medicinal products  
Adding Xultophy to metformin alone or in combination with pioglitazone in a 26-week randomised, 
controlled, open-label trial resulted in 60.4% of patients treated with Xultophy reaching a target of 
HbA1c < 7% without confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes after 26 weeks of treatment. The proportion 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was significantly larger than observed with insulin degludec (40.9%, odds ratio 2.28, p < 0.0001) and 
similar to that observed with liraglutide (57.7%, odds ratio 1.13, p=0.3184). The key results of the trial 
are listed in Figure 1 and Table 3. 
Rates of confirmed hypoglycaemia were lower with Xultophy than with insulin degludec irrespective 
of the glycaemic control, see Figure 1. The rate per patient year of exposure (percentage of patients) of 
severe hypoglycaemia defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person was 0.01 
(2 patients out of 825) for Xultophy, 0.01 (2 patients out of 412) for insulin degludec and 0.00 
(0 patients out of 412) for liraglutide. The rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemic events was similar with 
Xultophy and insulin degludec treatment. 
Patients treated with Xultophy overall experienced less gastrointestinal side effects than patients 
treated with liraglutide. This might be due to the slower increase in the dose of the liraglutide 
component during treatment initiation when using Xultophy as compared to using liraglutide alone.  
The efficacy and safety of Xultophy were sustained up to 52 weeks of treatment. The reduction in 
HbA1c from baseline to 52 weeks was 1.84% with Xultophy with an estimated treatment difference of 
-0.65% compared to liraglutide (p< 0.0001) and -0.46% compared to insulin degludec (p< 0.0001). 
Body weight was reduced by 0.4 kg with an estimated treatment difference between Xultophy and 
insulin degludec of -2.80 kg (p< 0.0001), and the rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia remained 
1.8 events per patient year of exposure maintaining a significant reduction in overall risk of confirmed 
hypoglycaemia compared to insulin degludec.

In an open label trial comparing the efficacy and safety of Xultophy and insulin glargine 100 units/mL, 
both as add-on to SGLT2i ± OAD, Xultophy was superior to insulin glargine in reducing mean HbA1c 
after 26 weeks by 1.9% (from 8.2% to 6.3%) versus 1.7% (from 8.4% to 6.7%) with an estimated 
treatment difference of -0.36% [-0.50; -0.21]. Compared to baseline, Xultophy resulted in an 
unchanged mean body weight compared to a mean weight increase of 2.0 kg for patients treated with 
insulin glargine (estimated treatment difference -1.92 kg [95% CI: -2.64; -1.19]). The percentage of 
patients experiencing severe or blood-glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia was 12.9% in 
the Xultophy group and 19.5% in the insulin glargine group (estimated treatment ratio 0.42 [95% CI: 
0.23; 0.75]). The mean daily insulin dose at end of trial was 36 units for patients treated with Xultophy 
and 54 units for patients treated with insulin glargine.

nocturnal hypoglycaemic events was significantly lower with Xultophy compared to insulin glargine 
(estimated treatment ratio 0.17, p< 0.001). 
In a second trial, the transfer from basal insulin to Xultophy or insulin degludec was investigated in a 
26-week randomised, double-blind trial in patients inadequately controlled on basal insulin (20-
40 units) and metformin alone or in combination with sulfonylurea/glinides. Basal insulin and 
sulfonylurea/glinides were discontinued at randomisation. The maximum allowed dose was 50 dose 
steps for Xultophy and 50 units for insulin degludec. 48.7% of patients treated with Xultophy reached 
the HbA1c target of < 7% without confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes. This was a significantly higher 
proportion than observed with insulin degludec (15.6%, odds ratio 5.57, p< 0.0001). The key results of

Liraglutide (Victoza) 
The Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results 
(LEADER) trial, was a multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. 9 340 patients were 
randomly allocated to either liraglutide (4 668) or placebo (4 672), both in addition to standards of 
care for HbA1c and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. Primary outcome or vital status at end of trial was 
available for 99.7% and 99.6% of participants randomised to liraglutide and placebo, respectively. The 
duration of observation was minimum 3.5 years and up to a maximum of 5 years. The study 
population included patients ≥ 65 years (n=4 329) and ≥ 75 years (n=836) and patients with mild 
(n=3 907), moderate (n=1 934) or severe (n=224) renal impairment. The mean age was 64 years and 
the mean BMI was 32.5 kg/m². The mean duration of diabetes was 12.8 years. 
The primary endpoint was the time from randomisation to first occurrence of any major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE): CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. 
Liraglutide was superior in preventing MACE vs placebo (Figure 6).

A reduction in HbA1c from baseline to month 36 was observed with liraglutide vs placebo, in addition 
to standard of care (-1.16% vs -0.77%; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.40% [-0.45; -0.34]).  
Insulin degludec (Tresiba) 
DEVOTE was a randomised, double-blind, and event-driven clinical trial with a median duration of 
2 years comparing the cardiovascular safety of insulin degludec versus insulin glargine (100 units/mL) 
in 7 637 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high risk of cardiovascular events.  
The primary analysis was time from randomisation to first occurrence of a 3-component major adverse 
cardiovascular event (MACE) defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or 
non-fatal stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial to exclude a pre-specified risk margin 
of 1.3 for the hazard ratio (HR) of MACE comparing insulin degludec to insulin glargine. The 
cardiovascular safety of insulin degludec as compared to insulin glargine was confirmed (HR 0.91 
[0.78; 1.06]) (Figure 7).  
At baseline, HbA1c was 8.4% in both treatment groups and after 2 years HbA1c was 7.5% both with 
insulin degludec and insulin glargine.

Insulin secretion/beta-cell function 
• 
Xultophy improves beta-cell function compared to insulin degludec as measured by the homeostasis 
model assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA-β). Improved insulin secretion compared to insulin 
degludec in response to a standardised meal test was demonstrated in 260 patients with type 2 diabetes 
after 52 weeks of treatment. No data is available beyond 52 weeks of treatment. 
Blood pressure 
• 
In patients inadequately controlled on metformin alone or in combination with pioglitazone, Xultophy 
reduced mean systolic blood pressure by 1.8 mmHg compared to a reduction of 0.7 mmHg with 
insulin degludec and 2.7 mmHg with liraglutide. In patients inadequately controlled on sulfonylurea 
alone or in combination with metformin, the reduction was 3.5 mmHg with Xultophy and 3.2 mmHg 
with placebo. The differences were not statistically significant. In three trials with patients 
inadequately controlled on basal insulin, systolic blood pressure was reduced by 5.4 mmHg with 
Xultophy and 1.7 mmHg with insulin degludec, with a statistically significant estimated treatment 
difference of -3.71 mmHg (p=0.0028), reduced by 3.7 mmHg with Xultophy vs 0.2 mmHg with 
insulin glargine, with a statistically significant estimated treatment difference of -3.57 mmHg 
(p<0.001) and reduced by 4.5 mmHg with Xultophy vs 1.16 mmHg with insulin glargine U100 plus 
insulin aspart, with a statistically significant estimated treatment difference of -3.70 mmHg 
(p=0.0003). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Xultophy in all subsets of the paediatric population for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of insulin degludec and liraglutide were not affected in a clinically 
relevant manner when administered as Xultophy compared with independent injections of insulin 
degludec and liraglutide.  
The following reflects the pharmacokinetic properties of Xultophy unless stated that the presented data 
is from administration of insulin degludec or liraglutide alone. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
The overall exposure of insulin degludec was equivalent following administration of Xultophy versus 
insulin degludec alone while the Cmax was higher by 12%. The overall exposure of liraglutide was 
equivalent following administration of Xultophy versus liraglutide alone while Cmax was lower by 
23%. The differences are considered of no clinical relevance since Xultophy is initiated and titrated 
according to the individual patient’s blood glucose targets. 
Insulin degludec and liraglutide exposure increased proportionally with the Xultophy dose within the 
full dose range based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
The pharmacokinetic profile of Xultophy is consistent with once-daily dosing and steady-state 
concentration of insulin degludec and liraglutide is reached after 2-3 days of daily administration. 
Distribution 
Insulin degludec and liraglutide are extensively bound to plasma proteins (> 99% and > 98%, 
respectively). 
Biotransformation 
Insulin degludec 
Degradation of insulin degludec is similar to that of human insulin; all metabolites formed are 
inactive. 
Liraglutide 
During 24 hours following administration of a single radiolabelled [3H]-liraglutide dose to healthy 
subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Two minor plasma metabolites were 
detected (≤ 9% and ≤ 5% of total plasma radioactivity exposure). Liraglutide is metabolised in a 
similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ having been identified as major route of 
elimination. 
Elimination 
The half-life of insulin degludec is approximately 25 hours and the half-life of liraglutide is 
approximately 13 hours. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
Age had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of Xultophy based on results from a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis including adult patients up to 83 years treated with Xultophy. 
Gender 
Gender had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of Xultophy based on results from a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
Ethnic origin  
Ethnic origin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of Xultophy based on results 
from a population pharmacokinetic analysis including White, Black, Indian, Asian and Hispanic 
groups. 
Renal impairment 
Insulin degludec 
There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of insulin degludec between healthy subjects and 
patients with renal impairment. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Liraglutide 
Liraglutide exposure was reduced in patients with renal impairment compared to individuals with 
normal renal function. Liraglutide exposure was lowered by 33%, 14%, 27% and 26%, in patients with 
mild (creatinine clearance, CrCl 50-80 mL/min), moderate (CrCl 30-50 mL/min), and severe (CrCl 
< 30 mL/min) renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, respectively.  
Similarly, in a 26-week clinical trial, patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment 
(CrCl 30-59 mL/min) had 26% lower liraglutide exposure when compared with a separate trial 
including patients with type 2 diabetes with normal renal function or mild renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Insulin degludec 
There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of insulin degludec between healthy subjects and 
patients with hepatic impairment. 
Liraglutide 
The pharmacokinetics of liraglutide was evaluated in patients with varying degrees of hepatic 
impairment in a single-dose trial. Liraglutide exposure was decreased by 13-23% in patients with mild 
to moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. Exposure was significantly lower (44%) 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score > 9). 
Paediatric population 
No studies have been performed with Xultophy in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
The non-clinical development programme for insulin degludec/liraglutide included pivotal 
combination toxicity studies of up to 90 days duration in a single relevant species (Wistar rats) to 
support the clinical development programme. Local tolerance was assessed in rabbits and pigs.  
Non-clinical safety data revealed no safety concern for humans based on repeated dose toxicity 
studies. 
The local tissue reactions in the two studies in rabbits and pigs, respectively, were limited to mild 
inflammatory reactions. 
No studies have been conducted with the insulin degludec/liraglutide combination to evaluate 
carcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility. The following data are based upon studies with 
insulin degludec and liraglutide individually. 
Insulin degludec 
Non-clinical data reveal no safety concern for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, 
repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction. 
The ratio of mitogenic relative to metabolic potency for insulin degludec is unchanged compared to 
human insulin. 
Liraglutide 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for human based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, or genotoxicity. Non-lethal thyroid C-cell tumours were seen in 
2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice. In rats, a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) 
was not observed. These tumours were not seen in monkeys treated for 20 months. These findings in 
rodents are caused by a non-genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to which rodents 
are particularly sensitive. The relevance for humans is likely to be low but cannot be completely 
excluded. No other treatment-related tumours have been found. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Animal studies did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility but slightly increased 
early embryonic deaths at the highest dose. Dosing with liraglutide during mid-gestation caused a 
reduction in maternal weight and foetal growth with equivocal effects on ribs in rats and skeletal 
variation in the rabbit. Neonatal growth was reduced in rats while exposed to liraglutide, and persisted 
in the post-weaning period in the high dose group. It is unknown whether the reduced pup growth is 
caused by reduced pup milk intake due to a direct GLP-1 effect or reduced maternal milk production 
due to decreased caloric intake.

1.  What Xultophy is and what it is used for 
What Xultophy is used for 
Xultophy is used to improve blood glucose (sugar) levels in adult patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. You have diabetes because your body: 
• 
• 
does not make enough insulin to control the level of sugar in your blood or 
is not able to use the insulin properly. 
How Xultophy works  
Xultophy contains two active substances that help your body control your blood sugar:  
• 
• 
insulin degludec – a long-acting basal insulin which lowers your blood sugar levels.  
liraglutide – a ‘GLP-1 analogue’ that helps your body make more insulin during meals and 
lowers the amount of sugar made by your body.  
Xultophy and oral medicines for diabetes 
Xultophy is used with oral medicines for diabetes (such as metformin, pioglitazone and sulfonylurea 
medicines). It is prescribed when these medicines (used alone or with GLP-1 treatment or with basal 
insulin) are not enough to control your blood sugar levels.  
If you use GLP-1 treatment 
You should stop your GLP-1 treatment prior to starting on Xultophy. 
If you use insulin 
You should stop your insulin treatment prior to starting on Xultophy. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Xultophy 
Do not use Xultophy  
• 
if you are allergic to insulin degludec or liraglutide or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6).

Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Xultophy.  
• 
If you are also taking a sulfonylurea (such as glimepiride or glibenclamide), your doctor may 
tell you to lower your sulfonylurea dose depending on your blood sugar levels. 
Do not use Xultophy if you have type 1 diabetes mellitus or if you have ‘ketoacidosis’ (a 
condition with a build-up of acid in the blood).  
The use of Xultophy is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or 
delayed gastric emptying (diabetic gastroparesis). 
Be especially aware of the following when using Xultophy: 
• 
low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) – if your blood sugar is low, follow the advice in section 4 
‘Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)’. 
high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) – if your blood sugar is high, follow the advice in section 4 
‘High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia)’. 
Ensuring you use the right medicine – Always check the pen label before each injection to avoid 
accidentally confusing Xultophy with other products. 
Important things to know before you use this medicine: 
Tell your doctor if you:  
• 
have eye problems. Fast improvements in blood sugar control may make diabetic eye problems 
get worse for a short time. The long-term improvements in blood sugar control may ease the eye 
problems. 
have or have had a thyroid disease.  
Important things to know while you are using this medicine: 
• 
if you have a severe stomach ache which does not go away, tell your doctor – this could be a 
sign of inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis).  
dehydration (loss of fluids from the body) can happen if you are feeling or being sick (nausea or 
vomiting) or have diarrhoea – it is important to drink plenty of fluids to stop dehydration.  
• 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3 ‘How to use Xultophy’). Tell your 
doctor if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently 
injecting into these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell 
you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents. There is no experience with Xultophy in children 
and adolescents under 18 years old. 
Other medicines and Xultophy 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level – this may mean your Xultophy dose has to 
change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines, which may affect your Xultophy treatment. 
Your blood sugar level may fall if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
other medicines for diabetes (tablets or injections) 
sulfonamides – for infections 
anabolic steroids – such as testosterone 
beta-blockers – for high blood pressure. They may make it harder to recognise the warning signs 
of low blood sugar (see section 4 ‘Warning signs of low blood sugar – these may come on 
suddenly’) 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
acetylsalicylic acid (and medicines called ‘salicylates’) – for pain and mild fever 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors – for depression 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors – for some heart problems or high blood 
pressure. 
Your blood sugar level may rise if you take: 
danazol – medicine affecting ovulation 
• 
oral contraceptives – birth control pills 
• 
thyroid hormones – for thyroid disease 
• 
growth hormone – for low levels of growth hormone  
• 
medicines called ‘glucocorticoids’ such as cortisone – for inflammation 
• 
medicines called ‘sympathomimetics’ such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or 
• 
terbutaline – for asthma 
water tablets called ‘thiazides’ – for high blood pressure or if your body is holding onto too 
much water (water retention). 
• 
Octreotide and lanreotide – used for treatment of acromegaly (a rare illness with too much growth 
hormone). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Pioglitazone – tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Some patients with long-
standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke, who were treated with 
pioglitazone and insulin, experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor straight 
away if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in 
weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Warfarin or other blood thinners – medicines used to prevent clotting of the blood. Tell your doctor 
if you are taking warfarin or other blood thinners as you might need to have blood tests more often to 
measure how thick your blood is (called ‘International Normalised Ratio’ or INR test). 
Xultophy with alcohol 
If you drink alcohol, your need for Xultophy may change. Your blood sugar level may either rise or 
fall. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
Do not use Xultophy if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are 
pregnant, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. It is not known if Xultophy 
affects the baby. 
Do not use Xultophy if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if Xultophy passes into breast milk.  
Driving and using machines  
Having low or high blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If your 
blood sugar is low or high, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This could be 
dangerous to yourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if: 
• 
• 
you often get low blood sugar 
you find it hard to recognise low blood sugar. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Xultophy  
Xultophy contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that the medicine is 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Xultophy 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse if you are not sure. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this pen 
without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the Xultophy pre-filled 
pen. 
Your doctor will tell you: 
• 
• 
• 
how much Xultophy you will need each day 
when to check your blood sugar level 
how to adjust the dose. 
Your dose of Xultophy is administered as ‘dose steps’. The dose counter on the pen shows the number 
of dose steps. 
Dosing time 
• 
Use Xultophy once each day, preferably at the same time every day. Choose a time of the day 
that works best for you. 
If it is not possible to use Xultophy at the same time every day, it can be used at a different time 
of the day. Make sure to have a minimum of 8 hours between the doses. 
You do not have to use Xultophy with a meal.  
Always follow your doctor’s advice for dose and dose adjustment. 
If you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a 
change in diet may alter your need for Xultophy. 
How to handle Xultophy  
Xultophy is a pre-filled dial-a-dose pen. 
• 
Xultophy is administered as ‘dose steps’. The dose counter on the pen shows the number of 
dose steps. 
One dose step contains 1 unit of insulin degludec and 0.036 mg of liraglutide.  
The maximum daily dose of Xultophy is 50 dose steps (50 units of insulin degludec and 1.8 mg 
of liraglutide). 
Carefully read the ‘Instructions on how to use’ on the other side of this leaflet and use the pen as 
described.  
Always check the pen label before you inject your medicine to ensure that you use the correct pen. 
How to inject 
Before you use Xultophy for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject. 
• 
Xultophy is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Do not inject it into a vein or 
muscle. 
The best places to inject are the front of your thighs, upper arms or the front of your waist 
(abdomen). 
Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing 
lumps and skin pitting (see section 4). 
Always use a new needle for each injection. Re-use of needles may increase the risk of blocked 
needles leading to inaccurate dosing. Dispose of the needle safely after each use. 
Do not use a syringe to remove the solution from the pen to avoid dosing errors and potential 
overdose. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Detailed instructions for use are on the other side of this leaflet. 
Do not use Xultophy: 
• 
• 
If the pen is damaged or has not been stored correctly (see section 5). 
If the liquid you can see through the pen window does not look clear and colourless. 
Use in elderly patients (65 years old or over) 
Xultophy can be used in elderly patients but if you are elderly you may need to check your blood sugar 
level more often. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have kidney or liver problems 
If you have kidney or liver problems, you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk 
to your doctor about changes in your dose. 
If you use more Xultophy than you should  
If you use more Xultophy than you should, your blood sugar may get low (hypoglycaemia) or you 
may feel or be sick (nausea or vomiting). If your blood sugar gets low, see the advice in section 4 
‘Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)’.  
If you forget to use Xultophy  
If you forget a dose, inject the missed dose when discovering the mistake, ensuring a minimum of 
8 hours between doses. If you discover that you missed your previous dose when it is time to take your 
next regular scheduled dose, do not take a double dose. 
If you stop using Xultophy  
Do not stop using Xultophy without talking to your doctor. If you stop using Xultophy this could lead 
to a very high blood sugar level, see the advice in section 4 ‘High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia)’. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The 
following serious side effects may happen with this medicine: 
• 
• 
Low blood sugar (very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people).  
If your blood sugar level gets low you may pass out (become unconscious). Serious 
hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you have signs of low 
blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level straight away. See advice in ‘Low 
blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)’ further down in this section.  
Serious allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) (not known: frequency cannot be estimated 
from the available data). 
If you have a serious allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in Xultophy, stop using 
Xultophy and see a doctor straight away. The signs of a serious allergic reaction are: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
local reactions spread to other parts of your body 
you suddenly feel unwell with sweating 
you have difficulty breathing 
you get a fast heartbeat or feel dizzy. 
Skin changes at the injection site: 
If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken 
(lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by 
build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The 
insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area. Change the 
injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  
Other side effects include: 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
• 
• 
Dizziness. 
Lower appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting), diarrhoea, constipation, indigestion 
(dyspepsia), inflamed lining of the stomach (gastritis), stomach ache, heartburn or bloating – 
these usually go away after a few days or weeks. 
Injection site reactions. The signs may include bruising, bleeding, pain, redness, hives, swelling 
or itching – these usually go away after a few days. See your doctor if they do not disappear 
after a few weeks. Stop using Xultophy and see a doctor straight away if they become serious.  
Increase of pancreatic enzymes, such as lipase and amylase. 
• 
• 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
• 
• 
• 
Hives (red bumps on your skin that are sometimes itchy). 
Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) such as rash, itching and swelling of the face. 
Dehydration (loss of fluid from the body) – it is important to drink plenty of fluids to stop 
dehydration. 
Belching (eructation) and wind (flatulence). 
Rash. 
Itching. 
Increased heart rate. 
Gallstones. 
Inflamed gallbladder. 
Change in how things taste. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•

Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) 
• 
•  
• 
Inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis). 
Delay in the emptying of the stomach. 
Swelling of arms or legs (peripheral oedema) – when you first start using your medicine, your 
body may keep more water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other 
joints. This is usually only short-lasting. 
General effects from diabetes treatment 
► 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) 
Low blood sugar may happen if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
drink alcohol 
exercise more than usual 
eat too little or miss a meal  
use too much Xultophy. 
Warning signs of low blood sugar – these may come on suddenly 
Headache, slurred speech, fast heartbeat, cold sweat, cool pale skin, feeling sick (nausea), feeling very 
hungry, shaking, feeling nervous or worried, unusually tired, weak and sleepy or confused, difficulty 
concentrating, short-lasting changes in your sight. 
What to do if you get low blood sugar: 
• 
Eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack – like sweets, biscuits or fruit juice (always 
carry glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case). 
Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. You may need to measure your blood sugar more 
than once. This is because improvement in your blood sugar may not happen straight away. 
Wait until the signs of low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has settled. 
Then carry on with your medicine as usual. 
• 
• 
What others need to do if you pass out:  
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets low, including the risk of passing out. 
Let them know that if you pass out, they must: 
• 
• 
• 
turn you on your side 
get medical help straight away 
not give you any food or drink – because you may choke. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You may recover more quickly from passing out if you receive glucagon.This can only be given by 
someone who knows how to use it. 
• 
• 
• 
If you are given glucagon, you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round. 
If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
If severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short- 
or long-lasting. It may even cause death. 
Talk to your doctor if: 
• 
• 
• 
This is because the dosing of your Xultophy injections, food or exercise may need to be changed. 
your blood sugar got so low that you passed out 
you have used glucagon 
you have had low blood sugar a few times recently. 
►  High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may happen if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
drink alcohol 
exercise less than usual 
eat more than usual 
get an infection or a fever 
have not used enough Xultophy, keep using less Xultophy than you need, forget to use 
Xultophy or stop using Xultophy without talking to your doctor. 
Warning signs of high blood sugar – these normally appear gradually 
Flushed, dry skin, feeling sleepy or tired, dry mouth, fruity (acetone) breath, urinating more often, 
feeling thirsty, losing your appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called ‘ketoacidosis’. This is a build-up of acid in the 
blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic 
coma and eventually death. 
What to do if you get high blood sugar: 
Test your blood sugar level. 
• 
Test your blood or urine for ketones. 
• 
Get medical help straight away. 
•

If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

1 Prepare your pen with a new needle 
  A 
• 
• 
Check the name and coloured label of your pen, to make sure that it 
contains Xultophy. 
This is especially important if you take more than one type of injectable 
medicine. Taking the wrong medicine could be harmful to your health. 
Pull off the pen cap. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Check that the solution in your pen is clear and colourless. Look 
through the pen window. If the solution looks cloudy, do not use the 
pen. 
• 
Take a new needle, and tear off the paper tab. 
  B 
  C 
• 
Push the needle straight onto the pen. Turn until it is on tight. 
  D 
• 
• 
Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You will need it 
after the injection, to safely remove the needle from the pen. 
  E 
Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. If you try to put it 
back on, you may accidentally stick yourself with the needle.  
A drop of solution may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you 
must still check the flow. 
Do not attach a new needle to your pen until you are ready to take your 
injection. 
  F 
  Always use a new needle for each injection. 
This may prevent blocked needles, contamination, infection and 
inaccurate dosing. 
  Never use a bent or damaged needle. 
2 Check the flow 
  A 
• 
• 
Turn the dose selector to select 2 dose steps. Make sure the dose 
counter shows 2. 
The dose counter and the dose pointer show how many dose steps of 
Xultophy you select.

49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing up.  
Tap the top of the pen gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to 
the top. 
  B 
Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. 
The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. 
A drop of solution should appear at the needle tip. 
  C 
A small drop may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. 
If no drop appears, repeat steps 2A to 2C up to 6 times. If there is still 
no drop, change the needle and repeat steps 2A to 2C once more. 
If a drop of solution still does not appear, dispose of the pen and use a 
new one. 
  Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you 
inject. This makes sure that the solution flows. 
If no drop appears, you will not inject any medicine, even though the 
dose counter may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged 
needle. 
It is important always to check the flow before you inject. If you do 
not check the flow, you may get too little medicine, or no medicine at 
all. This may lead to high blood sugar level. 
3 Select your dose 
  A 
• 
Turn the dose selector to select the dose you need. 
The dose counter shows the dose in dose steps. 
If you select a wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector forward or 
backward to the correct dose. 
The pen can dial up to a maximum of 50 dose steps. 
The dose selector changes the number of dose steps. 
Only the dose counter and dose pointer will show how many dose steps 
you select per dose. 
You can select up to 50 dose steps per dose. When your pen contains 
less than 50 dose steps, the dose counter stops at the number of dose 
steps left. 
The dose selector clicks differently when turned forward, backward or 
past the number of dose steps left. Do not count the pen clicks. 
  Always use the dose counter and the dose pointer to see how many 
dose steps you have selected before injecting the medicine. 
Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, 
your blood sugar level may get high or low. 
Do not use the pen scale, it only shows approximately how much 
solution is left in your pen.

How much solution is left? 
The pen scale shows you approximately how much solution is left in 
your pen. 
To see precisely how much solution is left, use the dose counter: 
Turn the dose selector until the dose counter stops. 
If it shows 50, at least 50 dose steps are left in your pen. If it shows less 
than 50, the number shown is the number of dose steps left in your pen. 
  B 
If you need more medicine than what is left in your pen, you can split 
your dose between two pens. 
  Be very careful to calculate correctly if splitting your dose.  
If in doubt, take the full dose with a new pen. If you split the dose 
wrongly, you will inject too little or too much medicine. This may make 
your blood sugar level high or low.

Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse has shown 
you. 
Make sure you can see the dose counter. Do not cover it with your 
fingers. This could interrupt the injection. 
Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter shows 0. 
The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. You may then hear or feel a 
click.

Keep the needle in your skin after the dose counter has returned to 0 
and count slowly to 6. 
If the needle is removed earlier, you may see a stream of solution 
coming from the needle tip. If so, the full dose will not be delivered, and 
you should increase the frequency of checking your blood sugar level.

Remove the needle from your skin. 
If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly. Do not rub the area. 
  D 
You may see a drop of solution at the needle tip after injecting. This is 
normal and does not affect your dose. 
  Always watch the dose counter to know how many dose steps you 
inject. Hold the dose button down until the dose counter shows 0. If the 
dose counter does not return to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, 
which may lead to high blood sugar level. 
How to identify a blocked or damaged needle? 
• 
If 0 does not appear in the dose counter after continuously 
pressing the dose button, you may have used a blocked or 
damaged needle. 
In this case - you have not received any medicine - even though 
the dose counter has moved from the original dose that you have 
set.

How to handle a blocked needle? 
Change the needle as described in section 5 and repeat all steps starting 
with section 1: Prepare your pen with a new needle. Make sure you 
select the full dose you need. 
Never touch the dose counter when you inject. This can interrupt the 
injection. 
5 After your injection 
Lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat surface without 
touching the needle or the outer cap. 
Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer needle cap 
completely on. 
Unscrew the needle and dispose of it carefully as instructed by your 
doctor or nurse.

Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect the solution from 
light. 
  C 
Always dispose of the needle after each injection to ensure the use of 
a sharp needle and prevent blocked needles. If the needle is blocked, 
you will not inject any medicine. 
When the pen is empty, throw it away without a needle on as instructed 
by your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local authorities. 
  Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may 
stick yourself with the needle. 
  Always remove the needle from your pen after each injection. 
This may prevent blocked needles, contamination, infection, leakage of 
solution and inaccurate dosing.

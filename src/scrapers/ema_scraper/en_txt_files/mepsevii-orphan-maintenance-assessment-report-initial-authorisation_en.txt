2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion on the orphan medicinal product designation was based on the following grounds: 
Whereas, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), having examined the application, 
concluded: 
•  Mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (Sly syndrome) (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to be affecting approximately 0.001  in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the 
time the application was made;  
• 
• 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the development skeletal and 
physical abnormalities with many patients dying in childhood; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition.  
The COMP recommends the designation of this medicinal product, containing recombinant human beta- 
glucuronidase, as an orphan medicinal product for the orphan indication: treatment of 
mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (Sly syndrome).  
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made

Condition 
Mucopolysaccharidosis VII also known as Sly syndrome or MPS VII is an autosomal recessive lysosomal 
storage disorder that is characterised by the deficiency of activity of β-glucuronidase (GUS). In the 
absence of GUS, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate are only partially degraded 
and the partially degraded fragments accumulate in the lysosomes of many tissues, eventually leading 
to cellular and organ dysfunction ( Montaño A et al, 2016). 
The GUS gene is located on chromosome 7q11.21–7q11.22 spanning 20 kb and containing 12 exons. 
Isolation and characterisation of the human GUS cDNA facilitated the investigation of allelic 
heterogeneity in patients with MPS VII. To date 49 unique, disease-causing mutations have been 
reported in patients with MPS VII. Mutations are distributed along the whole gene and include 
missense mutations (78.6%), nonsense mutations (12.6%), deletions (5.8%) and splice-site mutations 
(2.9%). 
Phenotypical characteristics of patients with MPS VII resemble those of MPS I and MPS II (short 
stature, skeletal dysplasia, hepatosplenomegaly, hernias, cardiac involvement, decreased pulmonary 
function and cognitive impairment). In MPS VII, however, one unique and distinguishing clinical feature 
is the unexpectedly high proportion of patients that have a history of non-immune hydrops fetalis 
(NIHF). Hydrops fetalis (fetal hydrops) is a serious foetal condition defined as abnormal accumulation 
of fluid in two or more foetal compartments, including ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, 
and skin oedema. In some patients, it may also be associated with polyhydramnios and placental 
oedema 
The clinical presentation and disease progression of MPS VII span a wide severity spectrum. Most 
patients with MPS VII have cognitive impairment, hepatosplenomegaly and skeletal dysplasia. 
However, affected patients show a wide range of clinical signs and symptoms, from early, severe, 
multisystem manifestations to milder phenotypes with later onset and normal or near-normal 
intelligence. Although patients with MPS VII may present with hydrops foetalis at birth and only survive 
a few months, rare patients with milder manifestations of MPS VII have survived into the fifth decade 
of life. The most severe form of MPS VII disease is characterised by the presence of NIHF (a more 
severe form of hydrops foetalis). 
The COMP has designated this condition once before. The literature continues to describe the condition 
as a distinct medical entity. The COMP accepted this condition for the purpose of the review of the 
Maintenance of Orphan Designation. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Vestronidase alfa is indicated for the treatment of non-
neurological manifestations of Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII; Sly syndrome) for patients of all 
ages” falls within the scope of the designated orphan indication “treatment of mucopolysaccharisosis 
VII”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP assessment the intention to treat the condition has been justified. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Most patients with MPS VII have cognitive impairment, hepatosplenomegaly and skeletal dysplasia. 
Repeated upper respiratory and pulmonary infections which required antibiotics are reported as 
common in the first 2 years of life. Hearing impairment is common and is believed to contribute to 
delayed speech development.

Common causes of death included complications of hydrops foetalis with respiratory and renal failure, 
heart disease, decreased pulmonary function and/ or obstructive airway disease, complication of bone 
marrow transplantation and aspiration. 
Death is premature in the majority of cases. It has been reported that 50% of patients die by the age 
of 1 year primarily due to complications of hydrops foetalis, respiratory failure and renal failure. After 
this age mortality seems to be primarily due to heart disease, complications of bone marrow 
transplantation (BMT) and pulmonary failure reported as the main causes of death (Montaño A et al, 
2016). Only a small percentage survives into adulthood.   
Number of people affected or at risk 
It is noted in the literature that MPS VII is an ultra-rare disorder and precise epidemiological data are 
scarce (Montaño A et al, 2016).  
The prevalence calculation is based on two sources: a recent publication by Montano A et al in 2016 
and data collected by the sponsor through their interaction with specialist centres in Europe. 
The sponsor highlights the publication in their revised prevalence calculation which states:” This global 
systematic survey of physicians caring for MPS VII patients worldwide (International MPS VII Clinical 
Survey) was commissioned by the sponsor and conducted by Dr. Adriana Montano (Montano et al. 
2016). Medical geneticists globally were queried regarding all identified MPS VII cases to characterize 
the population more systematically than could be performed from the literature. A total of 56 patients 
were identified and information collected. Of the 56 patients, 53% were confirmed alive, 36% were 
dead, and the status of 11% was unknown. The geographical distribution of patients with MPS VII 
showed they were predominantly from Brazil (27%), USA (20%), Germany (18%), Argentina (11%) 
and Spain (7%). Fifteen patients were identified in member countries of the European Union (Germany 
[10 patients], Spain [4 patients]; Lithuania [1 patient]). The sponsor’s internal outreach efforts also 
identified 20 living patients in different member states of the EU (France [5 patients], Spain [5 
patients], Portugal [4 patients], Netherlands [2 patients], Germany [2 patients], Czech Republic [1 
patient], Lithuania [1 patient])”. 
The authors of this article note that: “Overall the frequency of this disease is estimated to be 1:300 
000–1:2 000 000. Many patients may have been missed because of early death in utero since the most 
frequent phenotype may be hydrops fetalis in the antenatal form. Others may have died in early 
infancy without diagnosis”. 
The prevalence calculation is based on a total derived from the 15 patients identified in the publication 
and 20 identified by the sponsor irrespective of the potential for overlap. The total number of patients 
in Europe is therefore estimated to be 35. This absolute number was divided by the total population for 
Europe which in 2017 was 511,750,300. From these assumptions the sponsor proposed that the 
prevalence of the condition in Europe of 0.001 in 10,000.  
The current updated information provided by the sponsor confirms the assumptions made at the time 
of the initial orphan designation in 2011 where the information was not as current. The COMP 
maintained the prevalence at 0.001 in 10,000. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition.

Existing methods 
There are currently no authorised treatments for mucopolysaccharidosis VII (Sly Syndrome). The 
current management of these patients is palliative treatment and bone marrow transplantation (BMT). 
Palliative therapies currently are the basic therapeutic approach and including corrective surgeries, 
oxygen supplementation, antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy. 
(Montaño A et al, 2016). 
Limited results suggest that BMT can slow or even prevent further neurological complications, but has 
little to no effect on the skeletal disease unless it has been performed in neonates (Aldenhoven et al. 
2015, Bailey L. 2008, Sands MS et al, 1993). The main limitations of BMT in MPS have been the 
difficulty in finding appropriate donors and the high morbidity and mortality after BMT.

5.  COMP position adopted on 3 July 2018 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.001 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to cognitive impairment, 
hepatosplenomegaly and skeletal dysplasia. Fifty percent of patients die by the age of 1 year 
primarily due to complications of hydrops foetalis, respiratory failure and renal failure; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Mepsevii, vestronidase alfa, 
EU/3/12/973 for treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (Sly syndrome) is not removed from the 
Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

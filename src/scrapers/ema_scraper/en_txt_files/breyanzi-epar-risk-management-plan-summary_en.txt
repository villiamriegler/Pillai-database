Summary of risk management plan for BREYANZI 
(lisocabtagene maraleucel)  
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  BREYANZI.  The  RMP  details 
important identified and potential risks of BREYANZI, how these risks can be minimised, and 
how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about  BREYANZI's  risks  and  uncertainties  (missing 
information). 
The  BREYANZI  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  provide 
essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how BREYANZI should 
be used. 
This summary of the RMP for BREYANZI should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of BREYANZI's 
RMP. 
I.  The medicine and what it is used for 
BREYANZI  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  (R/R) 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and 
follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. BREYANZI is 
authorized for the treatment of adult patients with DLBCL, high grade B cell lymphoma (HGBCL), 
PMBCL, and FL3B, who relapsed within 12 months from completion of, or are refractory to, first-
line chemoimmunotherapy (see SmPC for the full indications).  
Further information about the evaluation of BREYANZI’s benefits can be found in BREYANZI’s 
EPAR,  including in its plain-language summary,  available on the European  Medicines Agency 
website.  
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks  
Important risks of BREYANZI, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about BREYANZI's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly 
  
 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of BREYANZI, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report assessment, so that immediate action 
can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of BREYANZI is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of BREYANZI are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there  is  sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  BREYANZI.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine). 
Important identified and potential risks, together with missing information, are summarised below.

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risks 
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
CRS has been reported with all anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)19 directed 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T therapeutics and is considered intrinsic to 
the therapeutic class. In Pooled 2L Treated Set, 45.2% of subjects experienced 
CRS. 29.9% of the events were mild and 14.1% of the events were moderate 
in severity. 2 (1.1%) events were Grade 3 with none being Grade 4 or fatal. In 
the Pooled 2L and 3L+ LBCL Treated Set, 41.8% of subjects experienced CRS. 
26.0% of events were mild and 14.1% of the events were moderate in severity. 
6 (1.0%) of the events were severe and 4 (0.7%) events were life-threatening 
in severity. 
CRS is considered an important identified risk as it requires careful monitoring 
and prompt intervention to minimise the potential for life-threatening or even 
fatal outcomes. Further evaluation of CRS frequency, severity, and potential 
risk  factors  will  be  conducted  in  the  postmarketing  setting  with  an 
observational registry-based study BCM-005, including patients followed for 
up to 15 years as applicable. 
Disease  burden  is  a  risk  factor  for  the  important  identified  risk  of  CRS. 
Analysis of adverse events (AEs) by Baseline Disease Characteristic showed 
that greater disease burden (ie, sum of products of diameter [SPD] ≥ 50 cm2 by 
computed tomography [CT] scan or lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] ≥ 500 U/L), 
or baseline inflammatory state (ie, C-reactive protein [CRP] ≥ 20 mg/L) were 
associated  with  higher  rates  of  all-grade  CRS.  Early  onset  of  CRS  usually 
predicts  more  severe  manifestations.  Patients  with  greater  DLBCL  disease 
burden  (higher  SPD  and/or  LDH)  or  who  have  elevated  baseline  levels  of 
inflammatory marker (CRP), are more likely to develop CRS. Overall, in the 
Pooled 2L Treated Set and the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Sets, CRS was more 
frequent in subjects with higher disease burden (SPD ≥ 50 cm2) or with more 
aggressive disease (HGBCL or subjects who required bridging chemotherapy).

Neurologic toxicity is an important identified risk due to its seriousness and 
potential for associated disability, including death, if left untreated. In addition 
to  CRS,  NT  is  an  expected  AE  associated  with  CAR  T  cell  therapy.  The 
diagnosis  is  based  on  characteristic  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  following 
CAR  T  infusion.  Neurologic  toxicity  is  primarily  managed  with  supportive 
care for low grade toxicity, and corticosteroids for more severe NT. 
As investigators were trained in the recognition and management of NT, the 
BREYANZI clinical studies used the investigator's judgment to prospectively 
identify all treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) considered to be NT 
related  to  BREYANZI,  and  termed  this  finding  investigator  identified  NT 
(iiNT).  
The  maximum  iiNT  grade  was  determined  by  the  highest  grade  of  any 
component TEAE considered part of iiNT. In the Pooled 2L Treated Set, 18.1% 
of experienced iiNT. 9.6% were mild and 4.0% of the events were moderate in 
severity. 4.5% of the events were Grade 3 with none being Grade 4 or fatal. In 
the Pooled 2L and 3L+ LBCL Treated Set, 24.8% of subjects experienced iiNT. 
8.6% were mild and 7.9% of the events were moderate in severity. 7.2% of the 
events were severe and 1.2% were life-threatening in severity with none being 
fatal. No subjects had Grade 5 iiNT but some BREYANZI treated subjects had 
ongoing iiNT at the time of death from other causes. 
Disease burden is a risk factor for the important identified risk of NT. Analysis 
of AEs by Baseline Disease Characteristic showed that greater disease burden 
(ie, SPD ≥ 50 cm2 by CT scan or LDH ≥ 500 U/L), or baseline inflammatory 
state (ie, CRP ≥ 20 mg/L) were associated with higher rates of all -grade iiNT. 
Overall, in the Pooled 2L Treated Set and the Pooled 3L+ LBCL Treated Sets, 
iiNT was more frequent in subjects with higher disease burden (SPD ≥ 50 cm2) 
or with more aggressive disease (HGBCL or subjects who required bridging 
chemotherapy).

Important identified risks 
Infections 
Evidence for linking the risk to

Risk factors and risk groups 
In addition to the known risk of infection from the LDC with fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide, BREYANZI can cause depletion of B-cells and increase 
patients’ risk for developing high grade and serious infections. In the Pooled 
2L Treated Set, 10.2% of subjects experienced ≥ Grade 3 treatment-emergent 
infections. 7.3% were severe and 1.7% of the events were life-threatening in 
severity with 1.1% of the events  being fatal. In the Pooled 2L and 3L+ LBCL 
Treated  Set,  11.8%  of  liso-cel  treated  subjects  had  ≥ Grade  3  treatment-
emergent  infections.  8.6%  were  severe  and  2.1%  of  the  events  were 
life-threatening in severity with 1.2% of the events being fatal. 
There was a numerically higher percentage of subjects with Grade ≥ 3 infection 
in those with Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia prior to LDC (23.5%) than in those who 
had Grade ≤ 2 neutropenia prior to LDC (11.5%) in Study 017001.

can  promote 
fludarabine  and 
cyclophosphamide. In the Pooled 2L Treated Set, 8.5% of subjects experienced 
hypogammaglobulinaemia. TEAEs of hypogammaglobulinaemia were noted 
in 6.8% of subjects in the treatment-emergent period and in 2.4% of subjects 
in  the  post  treatment-emergent  period.  Grade  ≥ 3  hypogammaglobulinaemia

There is a potential risk of inducing or aggravating GvHD in patients with 
prior allo-haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Subjects with active 
acute or chronic GvHD were excluded from BREYANZI clinical trials, and 
subjects had to be at least 3 months post allo-HSCT and clinically stable 
prior to apheresis.  
In the Pooled 2L Treated Set, no subjects experienced an AE of GvHD. A

In the Pooled 2L Treated Set, 1 of 177 subjects (0.6%) reported secondary 
malignancies  during  the  treatment-emergent  period  (any  time  from 
initiation of liso-cel administration through and including 90 days following 
the final infusion of liso-cel). 5 of 167 subjects (3.0%) reported secondary 
malignancies  during  the  post  treatment-emergent  period  (period  which 
starts from 91 days post the infusion of liso-cel). 1 (0.6%) event was fatal.  
In the Pooled 2L and 3L+ LBCL Treated Set, a total of 8 of 608 subjects 
(1.3%)  reported  secondary  malignancies  during  the  treatment-emergent 
period (any time from initiation of BREYANZI administration through and 
including 90 days following the final infusion of BREYANZI). A total of 
29 of 559 subjects (5.2%) reported secondary malignancies during the post 
treatment-emergent period (period which starts from 91 days post the final 
infusion of BREYANZI). 5 (0.9%) events were fatal. Adverse events that 
started after subsequent anticancer therapy or BREYANZI retreatment are 
reported  in  the  post  treatment-emergent  period,  if  subsequent  anticancer 
therapy  or  retreatment  started  before  90  days  post  the  final  infusion  of 
BREYANZI. 
Based  on  the  tumour  samples  received  and  tested,  no  secondary 
malignancies due to insertional oncogenesis have been identified to date. 
Patients  with  DLBCL  have  an  increased  risk  of  developing  secondary 
malignancies  related  to  prior  chemotherapy,  particularly  for  MDS  and 
AML.  
Long-term persistence of CAR T cells may be affected by the subsequent 
use  of  anti-epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)  monoclonal 
antibodies, but no clinical data are currently available.

Cerebral Oedema 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk  to  the

Risk factors and risk groups 
In  the  Pooled  2L  Treated  Set,  no  subjects  reported  events  of  cerebral 
oedema. In the Pooled 2L and 3L+ LBCL Treated Set, there is one reported 
case  of  cerebral  oedema  -  a  localised,  unilateral,  Grade 2  right  temporal 
oedema  reported  in  a  subject  who  was  later  determined  to  have  DLBCL 
involvement of the central nervous system (CNS).  
Serious and life-threatening reports of cerebral oedema have been reported 
after treatment with other CAR T products and CAR T product candidates. 
Risk factors and risk groups are unknown at this time but are presumed to 
be the same as those for neurotoxicity (ie, higher disease burden and higher 
inflammatory  state  and  some  have  commented  on  overexpression  of 
cytokines  such  as  IFNgamma,  TNFa,  IL-1,  and  IL-6).  Pre-existing 
extension of DLBCL to the CNS does not appear to be associated with a 
greater risk for cerebral oedema.

Generation of Replication Competent Lentivirus 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk  to  the

Lentiviral vectors used to transduce host autologous T cells for BREYANZI 
manufacture  are  engineered 
replication-incompetent  and 
to  be 
self-inactivating.  However,  the  potential  generation  of  RCL  during 
manufacturing  remains  a  theoretical  possibility  that  cannot  be  entirely 
excluded  and  RCL  has  the  potential  to  increase  the  possibility  of 
BREYANZI  transgene  mediated  transformation  and  oncogenesis.  In 
addition,  there  have  been  no  reports  of  RCL  generated  during  lentiviral 
vector  manufacturing  from  BREYANZI  and  there  have  been  no

Immunogenicity 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk  to  the

Risk factors and risk groups 
In  the  Pooled  2L  Treated  Set,  13.0%  of  subjects  experienced  AEs 
suggesting immunogenicity. 7.9% were mild and 4.5% of the events were 
moderate in severity. 0.6% of the events were ≥ Grade 3 with none being 
fatal.  In  the  Pooled  2L  and  3L+  LBCL  Treated  Set,  14.6%  of  subjects 
experienced AEs suggesting immunogenicity. 9.0% were mild and 5.1% of 
the events were moderate in severity. 0.5% of the events were ≥ Grade 3 
with none being fatal. To be noted, AEs suggesting immunogenicity were 
reported  in  19.8%  of  subjects  in  the  SOC  arm  of  BCM-003.  Of  those 
reported events, 1 (1.1%) event was ≥ Grade 3 and was life-threatening in 
severity. 
In  the  pooled  studies  (017001  and  BCM-001,  data  cutoff  date:  19-Jun-
2020), pre-existing anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) were detected in 29 
(9%)  of  309 subjects,  and  treatment-induced  or  treatment-boosted  ATAs 
were detected in 46 (15%) of 304 subjects. The relationships between ATA 
status  and  efficacy,  safety  or  PK  were  not  conclusive  due  to  the  limited 
number of subjects with ATAs. 
In  subjects  who  received  one  prior  line  of  therapy  for  LBCL  (BCM-003 
[Arm  B],  017006  and  BCM-001  [Cohort  2]),  pre-existing  ATAs  were 
detected  in  0.6%  (1/169)  of  subjects,  and  treatment-induced  ATAs  were 
detected in 7% (7/168) of subjects. Due to the low incidence of ATA, it is 
not appropriate to assess any potential relationship of ATA with efficacy, 
safety, or PK. 
Although  there  have  been  uncommon  infusion  related  reactions  after 
BREYANZI  therapy,  there  have  not  been  reports  characteristic  of 
anaphylaxis, angioedema or urticaria as sometimes observed in association 
with immunogenic biologic therapies.

Summary of objectives 
Efficacy studies which are conditions of the marketing authorization 
Postauthorisation safety 
study JCAR017-BCM-005 
Primary objective: 
To  characterise  the  incidence  and severity of  selected  ADRs, as outlined  in  the 
SmPC, in patients treated with BREYANZI in the postmarketing setting, and to 
monitor for potential clinically important events that have not yet been identified 
as part of the BREYANZI safety profile. 
Secondary objectives: 
•  To assess long-term effectiveness in patients treated with BREYANZI in the 
postmarketing setting. 
•  To  assess  the  BREYANZI  safety  and  effectiveness  profile  in  certain 
subgroups including but not limited to: 
−  By large B-cell lymphoma subtypes (eg, follicular lymphoma grade 3B 
[FL3B],  primary  mediastinal  B-cell  lymphoma [PMBCL],  DLBCL  not 
otherwise specified, high grade B-cell lymphoma). 
−  According to geographical regions (eg, Europe). 
−  Subjects aged ≥ 75 years. 
  
Planned and ongoing post-authorization efficacy studies 
Study short name and title 
Summary of objectives 
Efficacy studies which are conditions of the marketing authorization 
−  Subjects  with  comorbid  conditions  (eg,  renal  impairment,  reduced 
cardiac function). 
−  Subjects with secondary central nervous system (CNS) involvement. 
−  Subjects  with  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group 
(ECOG) 
performance score ≥ 2. 
−  By  possible  prognostic  factors  (eg,  high-risk  international  prognostic 
index [IPI]). 
−  Subjects previously exposed to anti-CD19 therapy. 
−  Subjects with low pre-leukapheresis absolute lymphocyte count (< 0.3 × 
109/L). 
−  Subjects treated with out-of-specification product.

Long-term Follow-up Study 
(Study GC-LTFU-001) 
Per Health Authority guidelines for gene therapy medicinal products that utilise 
integrating vectors (eg, retroviral vectors), 15 years of total long-term safety and 
efficacy follow-up of gene therapy treated subjects is required.  
Primary objectives: 
•  To assess the risk of delayed AEs following exposure to gene modified (GM) 
T cells. 
•  To  monitor  for  long-term  persistence  of  GM  T  cells,  including  analysis  of 
vector integration sites, as appropriate. 
•  To monitor for generation of replication competent retroviruses (RCR). 
•  To assess long-term efficacy following treatment with GM T cells. 
•  Describe  growth  and  sexual  maturity  status  for  subjects  who  were  aged 
< 18 years at time of GM T cell treatment. 
Secondary objective: 
•  To assess long term HRQoL following treatment with GM T cells.

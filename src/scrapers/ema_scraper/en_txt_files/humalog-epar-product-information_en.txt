CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
For the treatment of adults and children with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the maintenance 
of normal glucose homeostasis. Humalog is also indicated for the initial stabilisation of diabetes 
mellitus.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The dose should be determined by the physician, according to the requirement of the patient.

Junior KwikPen 
Humalog 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen is suitable for patients who may benefit from finer insulin dose 
adjustments. 
Humalog may be given shortly before meals. When necessary Humalog can be given soon after meals.  
Humalog takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity (2 to 5 hours) given subcutaneously 
as compared with soluble insulin. This rapid onset of activity allows a Humalog injection (or, in the 
case of administration by continuous subcutaneous infusion, a Humalog bolus) to be given very close 
to mealtime. The time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or 
at different times in the same individual. The faster onset of action compared to soluble human insulin 
is maintained regardless of injection site. As with all insulin preparations, the duration of action of 
Humalog is dependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity. 
Humalog can be used in conjunction with a longer-acting insulin or oral sulphonylurea agents, on the 
advice of a physician.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Insulin requirements may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced capacity for 
gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin breakdown; however, in patients with chronic hepatic 
impairment, an increase in insulin resistance may lead to increased insulin requirements. 
Paediatric population 
Humalog can be used in adolescents and children (see section 5.1). 
Method of administration 
Subcutaneous use 
Humalog preparations should be given by subcutaneous injection.  
The KwikPen,Junior KwikPen and Tempo Pen are only suitable for subcutaneous injections. Humalog 
in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a Lilly reusable pen or compatible pump 
systems for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).  
Subcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or abdomen. Use of 
injection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a 
month, in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 
4.8). 
When administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog to ensure that a 
blood vessel has not been entered. After injection, the site of injection should not be massaged. 
Patients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques. 
Humalog KwikPens 
Humalog KwikPen is available in two strengths. The Humalog 100 units/ml KwikPen (and Humalog 
200 units/ml KwikPen, see separate SmPC) delivers 1 – 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. 
The Humalog 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen delivers 0.5 – 30 units in steps of 0.5 units in a single 
injection. The number of insulin units is shown in the dose window of the pen regardless of 
strength and no dose conversion should be done when transferring a patient to a new strength or to a 
pen with a different dose step.  
  3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Humalog Tempo Pen 
The Humalog 100 units/ml Tempo Pen delivers 1 – 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. The 
number of insulin units is shown in the dose window of the pen regardless of strength and no dose 
conversion should be done when transferring a patient to a new strength or to a pen with a different 
dose step. The Tempo Pen can be used with the optional transfer module Tempo Smart Button (see 
section 6.6). 
As with any insulin injection, when using the Tempo Pen, Smart Button and the mobile application, 
the patient should be instructed to check their blood sugar levels when considering or making 
decisions about another injection if they are unsure how much they have injected. 
Use of Humalog in an insulin infusion pump 
For subcutaneous injection of Humalog using a continuous infusion pump, you may fill the pump 
reservoir from a Humalog 100 units/ml vial. Some pumps are compatible with cartridges that can be 
inserted intact into the pump. 
Only certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro. Before infusing 
insulin lispro, the pump manufacturer’s instructions should be studied to ascertain the suitability for 
the particular pump. Use the correct reservoir and catheter for the pump. When filling the pump 
reservoir avoid damaging it by using the correct needle length on the filling system. The infusion set 
(tubing and cannula) should be changed in accordance with the instructions in the product information 
supplied with the infusion set. In the event of a hypoglycaemic episode, the infusion should be stopped 
until the episode is resolved. If repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur consider the need to 
reduce or stop an insulin infusion. A pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in 
a rapid rise in glucose levels. If an interruption to insulin flow is suspected, follow the instructions in 
the pump product literature. When used with an insulin infusion pump, Humalog should not be mixed 
with any other insulin. 
Intravenous administration of insulin 
If necessary, Humalog may also be administered intravenously, for example: for the control of blood 
glucose levels during ketoacidosis, acute illnesses or during intra and post operative periods. 
Humalog 100 units /ml is available in vials if administration of intravenous injection is necessary.   
Intravenous injection of insulin lispro should be carried out following normal clinical practise for 
intravenous injections, for example by an intravenous bolus or by an infusion system. Frequent 
monitoring of the blood glucose levels is required. 
Infusion systems at concentrations from 0.1 units/ml to 1.0 units/ml insulin lispro in 0.9% sodium 
chloride or 5% dextrose are stable at room temperature for 48 hours. It is recommended that the 
system is primed before starting the infusion to the patient. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypoglycaemia. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded.

Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin  
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular/soluble, NPH/isophane,  etc.), 
species (animal, human, human insulin analogue), and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA 
versus animal-source insulin) may result in the need for a change in dosage. For fast-acting insulins, 
any patient also on basal insulin must optimise dosage of both insulins to obtain glucose control across 
the whole day, particularly nocturnal/fasting glucose control. 
Vial 
When mixing Humalog with a longer acting insulin, the shorter-acting Humalog should be drawn into 
the syringe first, to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting insulin. Mixing of the 
insulins ahead of time or just before the injection should be on advice of the physician. However, a 
consistent routine must be followed. 
Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia 
Conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less 
pronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease or 
medications such as beta-blockers. 
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source 
insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less 
pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin. Uncorrected 
hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death. 
The use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-
dependent diabetics, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are 
potentially lethal. 
Injection technique 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment 
of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
Insulin requirements and dosage adjustment 
Insulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances. 
Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or 
change their usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of 
hypoglycaemia. A consequence of the pharmacodynamics of rapid-acting insulin analogues is that if 
hypoglycaemia occurs, it may occur earlier after an injection when compared with soluble human 
insulin. 
Combination of Humalog with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind, if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Humalog is considered. If the 
combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain 
and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued, if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
  5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Avoidance of medication errors 
Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental 
mix-ups between the two different strengths of Humalog KwikPen as well as other insulin products. 
Patients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the 
requirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who 
are blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who 
has good vision and is trained in using the insulin device. 
Tempo Pen  
The Tempo Pen contains a magnet (see section 6.5) that may interfere with the functions of an 
implantable electronic medical device, such as a pacemaker. The magnetic field extends to 
approximately 1.5 cm. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Insulin requirements may be increased by medicinal products with hyperglycaemic activity, such as 
oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, or thyroid replacement therapy, danazol, beta2 stimulants (such as 
ritodrine, salbutamol, terbutaline).  
Insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of medicinal products with hypoglycaemic 
activity, such as oral hypoglycaemics, salicylates (for example, acetylsalicylic acid), sulpha 
antibiotics, certain antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors), certain angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, enalapril), angiotensin II 
receptor blockers, beta-blockers, octreotide or alcohol.  
The physician should be consulted when using other medications in addition to Humalog (see section 
4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Data on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on 
pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn.    
It is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated (insulin-dependent or gestational 
diabetes) patient throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Patients with diabetes should be advised to inform 
their doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy. Careful monitoring of glucose 
control, as well as general health, is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes.  
Breast-feeding 
Patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose, diet or both.  
  6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
Insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may 
constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or 
operating machinery). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving, this is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes 
may suffer. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness, and in extreme cases, death. No 
specific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented, since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin 
dose and other factors e.g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following related adverse reactions from clinical trials are listed below as MedDRA preferred 
term by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥1/10; common:

X 
Local allergy in patients is common. Redness, swelling, and itching can occur at the site of insulin 
injection. This condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks. In some instances, this 
condition may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or 
poor injection technique.

Systemic allergy,  which is rare  but potentially more serious, is a generalised allergy to insulin. It may 
cause a rash over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, fast 
pulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce 
or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
Oedema  
Cases of oedema have been reported with insulin therapy, particularly if previous poor metabolic 
control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Insulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of 
complex interactions between insulin levels, glucose availability and other metabolic processes. 
Hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy 
expenditure. 
Hypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness, confusion, palpitations, headache, sweating and 
vomiting. 
Mild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or 
saccharated products. 
Correction of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or 
subcutaneous administration of glucagon, followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers 
sufficiently. Patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously. 
If the patient is comatose, glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. 
However, glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient 
fails to respond to glucagon. The patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is 
recovered. 
Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur 
after apparent clinical recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, 
ATC code: A10AB04 
The primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism. 
  8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues. 
Within muscle tissue this includes increasing glycogen, fatty acid, glycerol and protein synthesis and 
amino acid uptake, while decreasing glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, lipolysis, protein 
catabolism and amino acid output. 
Insulin lispro has a rapid onset of action (approximately 15 minutes), thus allowing it to be given 
closer to a meal (within zero to 15 minutes of the meal) when compared to soluble insulin (30 to 
45 minutes before). Insulin lispro takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity (2 to 
5 hours) when compared to soluble insulin.  
Clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced postprandial 
hyperglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin.  
As with all insulin preparations, the time course of insulin lispro action may vary in different 
individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on dose, site of injection, 
blood supply, temperature and physical activity. The typical activity profile following subcutaneous 
injection is illustrated below. 
The above representation reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to maintain the 
subject’s whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the effect of 
these insulins on glucose metabolism over time. 
Clinical trials have been performed in children (61 patients aged 2 to 11) and children and adolescents 
(481 patients aged 9 to 19 years), comparing insulin lispro to human soluble insulin. The 
pharmacodynamic profile of insulin lispro in children is similar to that seen in adults.  
When used in subcutaneous infusion pumps, treatment with insulin lispro has been shown to result in 
lower glycosylated haemoglobin levels compared to soluble insulin.  In a double-blind, crossover 
study, the reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin levels after 12 weeks dosing was 0.37 percentage 
points with insulin lispro, compared to 0.03 percentage points for soluble insulin (p = 0.004). 
In patients with type 2 diabetes on maximum doses of sulphonyl urea agents, studies have shown that 
the addition of insulin lispro significantly reduces HbA1c compared to sulphonyl urea alone. The 
reduction of HbA1c would also be expected with other insulin products e.g. soluble or isophane 
insulins. 
  9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated a reduced number of 
episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin. In some 
studies, reduction of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was associated with increased episodes of daytime 
hypoglycaemia. 
The glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment. 
Glucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin, as measured during a 
glucose clamp procedure, were maintained over a wide range of renal function.  
Insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more 
rapid and of a shorter duration. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed, and achieves peak 
blood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection. When considering the clinical 
relevance of these kinetics, it is more appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves (as 
discussed in 5.1). 
Insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients 
with renal impairment. In patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function the 
pharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally 
maintained and shown to be independent of renal function.  Insulin lispro maintains more rapid 
absorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In in vitro tests, including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells, insulin lispro 
behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrate that the 
dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro is equivalent to human insulin. Acute, 
one month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings. 
Insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Instructions for use and handling 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge or pre-filled pen must be used by one 
patient only, even if the needle on the delivery device is changed. Patients using vials must never 
share needles or syringes. The patient should discard the needle after every injection. 
The Humalog solution should be clear and colourless. Humalog should not be used if it appears 
cloudy, thickened, or slightly coloured or if solid particles are visible. 
Do not mix insulin in vials with insulin in cartridges. See section 6.2. 
Preparing a dose 
Vial 
The vial is to be used in conjunction with an appropriate syringe (100 unit markings). 
i) 
Humalog 
1.  Wash your hands.  
2. 
If using a new vial, flip off the plastic protective cap, but do not remove the stopper.   
3. 
If the therapeutic regimen requires the injection of basal insulin and Humalog at the same 
time, the two can be mixed in the syringe. If mixing insulins, refer to the instructions for 
mixing that follow in Section (ii) and 6.2.  
  12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. 
Draw air into the syringe equal to the prescribed Humalog dose. Wipe the top of the vial 
with a swab. Put the needle through the rubber top of the Humalog vial and inject the air 
into the vial.  
5. 
Turn the vial and syringe upside down. Hold the vial and syringe firmly in one hand. 
6.  Making sure the tip of the needle is in the Humalog, withdraw the correct dose into the 
syringe.  
7. 
Before removing the needle from the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles that reduce 
the amount of Humalog in it. If bubbles are present, hold the syringe straight up and tap 
its side until the bubbles float to the top. Push them out with the plunger and withdraw 
the correct dose.  
8. 
Remove the needle from the vial and lay the syringe down so that the needle does not 
touch anything. 
ii)  Mixing Humalog with longer-acting Human Insulins (see section 6.2) 
1. 
2. 
Humalog should be mixed with longer-acting human insulins only on the advice of a 
doctor. 
Draw air into the syringe equal to the amount of longer-acting insulin being taken. Insert 
the needle into the longer-acting insulin vial and inject the air. Withdraw the needle.  
3. 
Now inject air into the Humalog vial in the same manner, but do not withdraw the needle.  
4. 
Turn the vial and syringe upside down.  
5.  Making sure the tip of the needle is in the Humalog, withdraw the correct dose of 
Humalog into the syringe.  
6. 
7. 
Before removing the needle from the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles that reduce 
the amount of Humalog in it. If bubbles are present, hold the syringe straight up and tap 
its side until the bubbles float to the top. Push them out with the plunger and withdraw 
the correct dose.  
Remove the needle from the vial of Humalog and insert it into the vial of the longer-
acting insulin. Turn the vial and syringe upside down. Hold the vial and syringe firmly in 
one hand and shake gently. Making sure the tip of the needle is in the insulin, withdraw

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Humalog Mix25 is indicated for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus who require insulin 
for the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The dosage should be determined by the physician, according to the requirement of the patient. 
Humalog Mix25 may be given shortly before meals. When necessary, Humalog Mix25 can be given 
soon after meals. Humalog Mix25 should only be given by subcutaneous injection. Under no 
circumstances should Humalog Mix25 be given intravenously. 
The rapid onset and early peak of activity of Humalog itself is observed following the subcutaneous 
administration of Humalog Mix25. This allows Humalog Mix25 to be given very close to mealtime. 
  16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The duration of action of the insulin lispro protamine suspension component of Humalog Mix25 is 
similar to that of a basal insulin (NPH). 
The time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different 
times in the same individual. As with all insulin preparations, the duration of action of Humalog 
Mix25 is dependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Insulin requirements may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced capacity for 
gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin breakdown; however, in patients with chronic hepatic 
impairment, an increase in insulin resistance may lead to increased insulin requirements. 
Paediatric population 
Administration of Humalog Mix25 to children below 12 years of age should be considered only in 
case of an expected benefit when compared to soluble insulin. 
Method of administration 
Subcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or abdomen.  Use of 
injection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a 
month, in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 
4.8). 
When administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog Mix25 to ensure 
that a blood vessel has not been entered. After injection, the site of injection should not be massaged. 
Patients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques. 
KwikPen 
The KwikPen delivers 1 – 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. The needed dose is dialled in 
units. The number of units is shown in the dose window of the pen.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypoglycaemia. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Under no circumstances should Humalog Mix25 be given intravenously. 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular/soluble, NPH/isophane, etc.), 
  17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
species (animal, human, human insulin analogue), and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA 
versus animal-source insulin) may result in the need for a change in dosage.  
Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia 
Conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less 
pronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease or 
medications such as beta-blockers. 
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source 
insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less 
pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin. Uncorrected 
hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death. 
The use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-
dependent diabetics, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are 
potentially lethal. 
Injection technique 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment 
of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
Insulin requirements and dosage adjustment 
Insulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances. 
Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or 
change their usual diet.  Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of 
hypoglycaemia. 
Combination of Humalog Mix25 with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind, if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Humalog Mix25 is considered. If the 
combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain 
and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued, if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Avoidance of medication errors 
Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental 
mix-ups between the two different strengths of Humalog KwikPen as well as other insulin products. 
Patients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the 
requirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who 
are blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who 
has good vision and is trained in using the insulin device. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially 
“sodium-free”.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Insulin requirements may be increased by substances with hyperglycaemic activity, such as oral 
contraceptives, corticosteroids, or thyroid replacement therapy, danazol, beta2 stimulants (such as 
ritodrine, salbutamol, terbutaline).  
Insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of substances with hypoglycaemic activity, such 
as oral hypoglycaemics, salicylates (for example, acetylsalicylic acid), sulphate antibiotics, certain 
antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), certain 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, enalapril), angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-
blockers, octreotide or alcohol.  
Mixing Humalog Mix25 with other insulins has not been studied. 
The physician should be consulted when using other medications in addition to Humalog Mix25 (see 
section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Data on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on 
pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn.    
It is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated (insulin-dependent or gestational 
diabetes) patient throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Patients with diabetes should be advised to inform 
their doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy. Careful monitoring of glucose 
control, as well as general health, is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes.  
Breast-feeding 
Patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose, diet or both.  
Fertility 
Insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may 
constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or 
operating machinery). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving, this is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes 
may suffer. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness, and in extreme cases, death. No 
specific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented, since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin 
dose and other factors e.g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Local allergy  
X 
X 
X 
Local allergy in patients is common . Redness, swelling, and itching can occur at the site of insulin 
injection. This condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks. In some instances, this 
condition may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or 
poor injection technique.  
Systemic allergy 
Systemic allergy,  which is rare but potentially more serious, is a generalised allergy to insulin. It may 
cause a rash over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, fast 
pulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce 
or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
Oedema  
Cases of oedema have been reported with insulin therapy, particularly if previous poor metabolic 
control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Insulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of 
complex interactions between insulin levels, glucose availability and other metabolic processes.  
Hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy 
expenditure. 
Hypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness, confusion, palpitations, headache, sweating and 
vomiting. 
Mild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or 
saccharated products. 
Correction of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or 
subcutaneous administration of glucagon, followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers 
sufficiently.  Patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously. 
If the patient is comatose, glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously.  
However, glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient 
fails to respond to glucagon. The patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered. 
Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur 
after apparent clinical recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, intermediate 
or long acting combined with fast acting. ATC Code: A10A D04. 
The primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism. 
In addition, insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues.  
Within muscle tissue this includes increasing glycogen, fatty acid, glycerol and protein synthesis and 
amino acid uptake, while decreasing glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, lipolysis, protein 
catabolism and amino acid output. 
Insulin lispro has a rapid onset of action (approximately 15 minutes), thus allowing it to be given 
closer to a meal (within zero to 15 minutes of the meal) when compared to soluble insulin (30 to 45 
minutes before). The rapid onset and early peak of activity of insulin lispro is observed following the 
subcutaneous administration of Humalog Mix25.  Humalog BASAL has an activity profile that is very 
similar to that of a basal insulin (NPH) over a period of approximately 15 hours.  
Clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced postprandial 
hyperglycaemia with Humalog Mix25 compared to human insulin mixture 30/70. In one clinical study 
there was a small (0.38 mmol/l) increase in blood glucose levels at night (3a.m.). 
In the figure below the pharmacodynamics of Humalog Mix25 and BASAL are illustrated.

The above representation reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to maintain the 
subject's whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the effect of 
these insulins on glucose metabolism over time. 
The glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment. 
Glucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin, as measured during a 
glucose clamp procedure, were maintained over a wide range of renal function.  
Insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more 
rapid and of a shorter duration. 
In two 8-month open label crossover studies, type 2 diabetes patients who were either new to insulin 
therapy or already using one or two injections of insulin, received 4 months of treatment with 
Humalog Mix25 (used twice daily with metformin) and insulin glargine (used once daily with 
metformin) in a randomised sequence. Detailed information can be found in the following table.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed, and achieves peak 
blood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection. The pharmacokinetics of insulin 
lispro protamine suspension are consistent with those of an intermediate acting insulin such as NPH. 
The pharmacokinetics of Humalog Mix25 are representative of the individual pharmacokinetic 
properties of the two components. When considering the clinical relevance of these kinetics, it is more 
appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves (as discussed in 5.1). 
Insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients 
with renal impairment. In patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function  the 
pharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally 
maintained and shown to be independent of renal function.  Insulin lispro maintains more rapid 
absorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In in vitro tests, including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells, insulin lispro 
behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin.  Studies also demonstrate that the 
dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro is equivalent to human insulin.  Acute, 
one month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings. 
Insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Instructions for use and handling 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge or pen must be used by one patient 
only, even if the needle on the delivery device is changed.  Patients using vials must never share 
needles or syringes. The patient should discard the needle after every injection. 
  24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Humalog Mix25 should be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are 
present or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the container, giving it a frosted 
appearance. 
Preparing a dose 
Vials containing Humalog Mix25 should be rotated in the palms of the hands before use to resuspend 
the insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky. Cartridges and KwikPens containing Humalog 
Mix25 should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times and inverted 180° ten times immediately 
before use to resuspend the insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky.   
If not, repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed.  Cartridges contain a small glass bead to 
assist mixing.  
Do not shake vigorously as this may cause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement 
of the dose.  
Vial 
The vial is to be used in conjunction with an appropriate syringe (100 unit markings). 
1.  Wash your hands.  
2. 
3. 
If using a new vial, flip off the plastic protective cap, but do not remove the stopper.    
Draw air into the syringe equal to the prescribed Humalog Mix25 dose.  Wipe the top of 
the vial with a swab.  Put the needle through rubber top of the Humalog Mix25 vial and 
inject the air into the vial.  
4. 
Turn the vial and syringe upside down. Hold the vial and syringe firmly in one hand. 
5.  Making sure the tip of the needle is in the Humalog Mix25, withdraw the correct dose 
into the syringe.  
6. 
Before removing the needle from the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles that reduce 
the amount of Humalog Mix25 in it. If bubbles are present, hold the syringe straight up 
and tap its side until the bubbles float to the top. Push them out with the plunger and 
withdraw the correct dose.  
7. 
Remove the needle from the vial and lay the syringe down so that the needle does not 
touch anything. 
Cartridge 
Humalog Mix25 cartridges are to be used with a Lilly reusable insulin pen and should not be used 
with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has not been established with other pens. 
The instructions with each individual pen must be followed for loading the cartridge, attaching the 
needle and administering the insulin injection. 
KwikPen 
Before using the KwikPen the user manual included in the package leaflet must be read carefully.  The 
KwikPen has to be used as recommended in the user manual. 
Pens should not be used if any part looks broken or damaged.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Humalog Mix50 is indicated for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for 
the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The dosage should be determined by the physician, according to the requirement of the patient. 
Humalog Mix50 may be given shortly before meals. When necessary, Humalog Mix50 can be given 
soon after meals. Humalog Mix50 should only be given by subcutaneous injection. Under no 
circumstances should Humalog Mix50 be given intravenously. 
The rapid onset and early peak of activity of Humalog itself is observed following the subcutaneous 
administration of Humalog Mix50. This allows Humalog Mix50 to be given very close to mealtime. 
The duration of action of the insulin lispro protamine suspension component of Humalog Mix50 is 
similar to that of a basal insulin (NPH). 
  27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different 
times in the same individual. As with all insulin preparations, the duration of action of Humalog Mix50 
is dependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Insulin requirements may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced capacity for 
gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin breakdown; however, in patients with chronic hepatic 
impairment, an increase in insulin resistance may lead to increased insulin requirements. 
Paediatric population 
Administration of Humalog Mix50 to children below 12 years of age should be considered only in 
case of an expected benefit when compared to soluble insulin. 
Method of administration 
Subcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or abdomen.  Use of 
injection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a 
month, in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 
4.8). 
When administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog Mix50 to ensure 
that a blood vessel has not been entered. After injection, the site of injection should not be massaged. 
Patients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques. 
KwikPen 
The KwikPen delivers 1 – 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. The needed dose is dialled in 
units. The number of units is shown in the dose window of the pen.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypoglycaemia. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Under no circumstances should Humalog Mix50 be given intravenously. 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin  
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision.  Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular/soluble, NPH/isophane, etc.), 
species (animal, human, human insulin analogue), and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA 
versus animal-source insulin) may result in the need for a change in dosage. 
  28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia 
Conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less 
pronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease or 
medications such as beta-blockers. 
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source 
insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less 
pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin. Uncorrected 
hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death. 
The use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-
dependent diabetics, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are 
potentially lethal. 
Injection technique 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment 
of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
Insulin requirements and dosage adjustment  
Insulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances. 
Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change 
their usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Combination of Humalog Mix50 with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind, if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Humalog Mix50 is considered. If the 
combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain 
and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued, if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Avoidance of medication errors 
Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental 
mix-ups between the two different strengths of Humalog KwikPen as well as other insulin products. 
Patients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the 
requirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who 
are blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who 
has good vision and is trained in using the insulin device. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially 
“sodium-free”.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Insulin requirements may be increased by substances with hyperglycaemic activity, such as oral 
contraceptives, corticosteroids, or thyroid replacement therapy, danazol, beta2 stimulants (such as 
ritodrine, salbutamol, terbutaline).  
Insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of substances with hypoglycaemic activity, such 
as oral hypoglycaemics, salicylates (for example, acetylsalicylic acid), sulpha antibiotics, certain 
antidepressants, (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), certain 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, enalapril), angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-
blockers, octreotide or alcohol.  
Mixing Humalog Mix50 with other insulins has not been studied. 
The physician should be consulted when using other medications in addition to Humalog Mix50 (see 
section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Data on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on 
pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn.    
It is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated (insulin-dependent or gestational 
diabetes) patient throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Patients with diabetes should be advised to inform 
their doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy. Careful monitoring of glucose 
control, as well as general health, is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes.  
Breast-feeding 
Patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose, diet or both.  
Fertility 
Insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may 
constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or 
operating machinery). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving, this is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes 
may suffer. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness, and in extreme cases, death. No 
specific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented, since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin 
dose and other factors e.g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Local allergy  
X 
X 
X 
Local allergy in patients is common . Redness, swelling, and itching can occur at the site of insulin 
injection. This condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks. In some instances, this 
condition may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or 
poor injection technique.  
Systemic allergy 
Systemic allergy,  which is rare  but potentially more serious, is a generalised allergy to insulin. It may 
cause a rash over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, fast 
pulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce 
or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
Oedema  
Cases of oedema have been reported with insulin therapy, particularly if previous poor metabolic 
control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Insulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of 
complex interactions between insulin levels, glucose availability and other metabolic processes.  
Hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy 
expenditure. 
Hypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness, confusion, palpitations, headache, sweating and 
vomiting. 
Mild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or 
saccharated products. 
Correction of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or 
subcutaneous administration of glucagon, followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers 
sufficiently.  Patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously. 
If the patient is comatose, glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously.  
However, glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient 
fails to respond to glucagon.  The patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered. 
Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur 
after apparent clinical recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, intermediate 
or long acting combined with fast acting. ATC Code: A10A D04. 
The primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism. 
In addition, insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues.  
Within muscle tissue this includes increasing glycogen, fatty acid, glycerol and protein synthesis and 
amino acid uptake, while decreasing glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, lipolysis, protein 
catabolism and amino acid output. 
Insulin lispro has a rapid onset of action (approximately 15 minutes), thus allowing it to be given closer 
to a meal (within zero to 15 minutes of the meal) when compared to soluble insulin (30 to 45 minutes 
before). The rapid onset and early peak of activity of insulin lispro is observed following the 
subcutaneous administration of Humalog Mix50. Humalog BASAL has an activity profile that is very 
similar to that of a basal insulin (NPH) over a period of approximately 15 hours.  In the figure below 
the pharmacodynamics of Humalog Mix50 and BASAL are illustrated.

                         Time, hours 
The above representation reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to maintain the 
subject's whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the effect of 
these insulins on glucose metabolism over time. 
The glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment. 
Glucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin, as measured during a 
glucose clamp procedure, were maintained over a wide range of renal function.  
Insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more 
rapid and of a shorter duration. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed, and achieves peak 
blood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection. The pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro 
protamine suspension are consistent with those of an intermediate acting insulin such as NPH. The 
pharmacokinetics of Humalog Mix50 are representative of the individual pharmacokinetic properties 
of the two components. When considering the clinical relevance of these kinetics, it is more 
appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves (as discussed in 5.1). 
Insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients 
with renal impairment. In patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function  the 
pharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally 
maintained and shown to be independent of renal function.  Insulin lispro maintains more rapid 
absorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic 
impairment.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In in vitro tests, including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells, insulin lispro 
behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrate that the 
dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro  is equivalent to human insulin. Acute, 
one month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings. 
Insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies.

6.5  Nature and contents of container  
Cartridge 
The suspension is contained in type I flint glass cartridges, sealed with butyl or halobutyl disc seals and 
plunger heads and secured with aluminium seals.  Dimeticone or silicone emulsion may have been 
used to treat the cartridge plunger, and/or the glass cartridge.   
3 ml Cartridge: Packs of 5 or 10. Not all packs may be marketed. 
KwikPen 
The suspension is contained in type I flint glass cartridges, sealed with halobutyl disc seals and 
plunger heads and secured with aluminium seals.  Dimeticone or silicone emulsion may have been 
used to treat the cartridge plunger, and/or the glass cartridge. The 3 ml cartridges are sealed in a 
disposable pen injector, called the “KwikPen”.  Needles are not included. 
3 ml KwikPen: Packs of 5 or a multipack of 10 (2 packs of 5). Not all packs may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Instructions for use and handling 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge or pen must be used by one patient 
only, even if the needle on the delivery device is changed. The patient should discard the needle after 
every injection. 
The Humalog Mix50 should be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are 
present or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the container, giving it a frosted 
appearance. 
Preparing a dose 
Cartridges  or KwikPens containing Humalog Mix50 should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten 
times and inverted 180° ten times immediately before use to resuspend the insulin until it appears 
uniformly cloudy or milky.  If not, repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed.  Cartridges 
contain a small glass bead to assist mixing.   
Do not shake vigorously as this may cause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement 
of the dose. 
Cartridge 
Humalog Mix50 cartridges are to be used with a Lilly reusable insulin pen and should not be used 
with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has not been established with other pens. 
The instructions with each individual pen must be followed for loading the cartridge, attaching the 
needle and administering the insulin injection. 
KwikPen 
Before using the KwikPen the user manual included in the package leaflet must be read carefully.  The 
KwikPen has to be used as recommended in the user manual. 
Pens should not be used if any part looks broken or damaged. 
Injecting a dose 
If using a pre-filled or reusable pen refer to the detailed instructions for preparing the pen and injecting 
the dose, the following is a general description.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Solution for injection.  
Clear, colourless, aqueous solution. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
For the treatment of adults with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the maintenance of normal 
glucose homeostasis. Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen is also indicated for the initial stabilisation of 
diabetes mellitus.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The dosage should be determined by the physician, according to the requirement of the patient.  
Humalog may be given shortly before meals. When necessary Humalog can be given soon after meals.  
Humalog takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity (2 to 5 hours) given subcutaneously 
as compared with soluble insulin. This rapid onset of activity allows a Humalog injection to be given 
very close to mealtime. The time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different 
individuals or at different times in the same individual. The faster onset of action compared to soluble 
human insulin is maintained regardless of injection site. The duration of action of Humalog is 
dependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity. 
Humalog can be used in conjunction with a longer-acting insulin or oral sulphonylurea medicinal 
products, on the advice of a physician.  
Humalog KwikPens 
Humalog KwikPen is available in two strengths.The Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen (and Humalog 
100 units/ml KwikPen, see separate SmPC) delivers 1 – 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. 
The number of insulin units is shown in the dose window of the pen regardless of strength and no 
  37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose conversion should be done when transferring a patient to a new strength or to a pen with a 
different dose step.  
Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen should be reserved for the treatment of patients with diabetes 
requiring daily doses of more than 20 units of rapid-acting insulin. The insulin lispro solution 
containing 200 units/ml should not be withdrawn from the pre-filled pen (the KwikPen) or mixed with 
any other insulin (see section 4.4 and section 6.2). 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Insulin requirements may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced capacity for 
gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin breakdown; however, in patients with chronic hepatic 
impairment, an increase in insulin resistance may lead to increased insulin requirements. 
Method of administration 
Humalog solution for injection should be given subcutaneously.  
Subcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or abdomen. Use of 
injection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a 
month, in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 
4.8). 
When administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog to ensure that a 
blood vessel has not been entered. After injection, the site of injection should not be massaged. 
Patients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques. 
Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection should not be used in an insulin infusion pump. 
Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection should not be used intravenously. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypoglycaemia. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin  
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular/soluble, NPH/isophane, etc.), 
species (animal, human, human insulin analogue), and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA 
versus animal-source insulin) may result in the need for a change in dosage. For fast-acting insulins, 
any patient also on basal insulin must optimise dosage of both insulins to obtain glucose control across 
the whole day, particularly nocturnal/fasting glucose control.

Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia 
Conditions  which  may  make  the  early  warning  symptoms  of  hypoglycaemia  different  or  less 
pronounced  include  long  duration  of  diabetes,  intensified  insulin  therapy,  diabetic  nerve  disease  or 
medicinal products such as beta-blockers. 
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source 
insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less 
pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin. Uncorrected 
hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death. 
The use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-
dependent diabetics, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are 
potentially lethal. 
Injection technique 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment 
of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
Insulin requirements and dosage adjustment 
Insulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances. 
Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or 
change their usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of 
hypoglycaemia. A consequence of the pharmacodynamics of rapid-acting insulin analogues is that if 
hypoglycaemia occurs, it may occur earlier after an injection when compared with soluble human 
insulin. 
Combination of Humalog with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind, if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Humalog is considered. If the 
combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain 
and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued, if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Avoidance of medication errors when using insulin lispro (200 units/ml) in pre-filled pen: 
The insulin lispro solution for injection containing 200 units/ml must not be transferred from the pre-
filled pen, the KwikPen, to a syringe. The markings on the insulin syringe will not measure the dose 
correctly. Overdose can result causing severe hypoglycemia.  The insulin lispro solution for injection 
containing 200 units/ml must not be transferred from the KwikPen to any other insulin delivery 
device, including insulin infusion pumps. 
Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental 
mix-ups between the two different strengths of Humalog as well as other insulin products. 
Patients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the 
requirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who 
are blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who 
has good vision and is trained in using the insulin device.

Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Insulin requirements may be increased by medicinal products with hyperglycaemic activity, such as 
oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, or thyroid replacement therapy, danazol, beta2 stimulants (such as 
ritodrine, salbutamol, terbutaline).  
Insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of medicinal products with hypoglycaemic 
activity, such as oral hypoglycemics, salicylates (for example, acetylsalicylic acid), sulpha antibiotics, 
certain antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), certain 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, enalapril), angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-
blockers, octreotide or alcohol.  
The physician should be consulted when using other medicinal products in addition to Humalog 
200 units/ml KwikPen (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Data on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on 
pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn.   
It is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated (insulin-dependent or gestational 
diabetes) patient throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and 
increase during the second and third trimesters. Patients with diabetes should be advised to inform 
their doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy. Careful monitoring of glucose 
control, as well as general health, is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes.  
Breast-feeding 
Patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose, diet or both.  
Fertility 
Insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may 
constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using 
machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia is the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin lispro therapy that a patient with 
diabetes may suffer. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness, and in extreme cases, 
death. No specific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented, since hypoglycaemia is a result of both 
the insulin dose and other factors e.g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following related adverse reactions from clinical trials are listed below as MedDRA preferred 
term by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥1/10; common: 
≥1/100 to <1/10; uncommon: ≥1/1,000 to <1/100; rare: ≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000; very rare: <1/10,000) ; 
not known (cannot be estimated form the available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Local allergy  
X 
X 
X 
Local allergy in patients is common). Redness, swelling, and itching can occur at the site of insulin 
injection. This condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks. In some instances, this 
condition may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or 
poor injection technique.  
Systemic allergy  
Systemic allergy, which is rare but potentially more serious, is a generalised allergy to insulin. It may 
cause a rash over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, fast 
pulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce 
or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
Oedema  
Cases of oedema have been reported with insulin therapy, particularly if previous poor metabolic 
control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Insulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of 
complex interactions between insulin levels, glucose availability and other metabolic processes. 
Hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy 
expenditure. 
Hypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness, confusion, palpitations, headache, sweating and 
vomiting. 
Mild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or 
saccharated products. 
Correction of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or 
subcutaneous administration of glucagon, followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers 
sufficiently. Patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously. 
If the patient is comatose, glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. 
However, glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient 
fails to respond to glucagon. The patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered. 
Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur 
after apparent clinical recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, 
ATC code: A10AB04 
The primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism. 
In addition, insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues. 
Within muscle tissue this includes increasing glycogen, fatty acid, glycerol and protein synthesis and 
amino acid uptake, while decreasing glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, lipolysis, protein 
catabolism and amino acid output. 
Insulin lispro has a rapid onset of action (approximately 15 minutes), thus allowing it to be given 
closer to a meal (within zero to 15 minutes of the meal) when compared to soluble insulin  
(30 to 45 minutes before). Insulin lispro takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity (2 to 
5 hours) when compared to soluble insulin.  
Clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced postprandial 
hyperglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin.  
The time course of insulin lispro action may vary in different individuals or at different times in the 
same individual and is dependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature and physical 
activity. The typical activity profile following subcutaneous injection is illustrated below.

Figure 1: 
The above representation (figure 1) reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to 
maintain the subject's whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the 
effect of these insulins (100 units/ml) on glucose metabolism over time. 
The pharmacodynamic responses of insulin lispro 200 units/ml solution for injection were similar to 
those for insulin lispro 100 units/ml solution for injection after subcutaneous administration of a single 
20 unit dose in healthy subjects as shown in the graph below (figure 2).

In patients with type 2 diabetes on maximum doses of sulphonyl urea agents, studies have shown that 
the  addition  of  insulin  lispro  significantly  reduces  HbA1c  compared  to  sulphonyl  urea  alone.  The 
reduction  of  HbA1c  would  also  be  expected  with  other  insulin  products  e.g.  soluble  or  isophane 
insulins. 
Clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated a reduced number of 
episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin. In some 
studies, reduction of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was associated with increased episodes of daytime 
hypoglycaemia. 
The glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment. 
Glucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin, as measured during a 
glucose clamp procedure, were maintained over a wide range of renal function. 
Insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more 
rapid and of a shorter duration. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed, and achieves peak 
blood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection. When considering the clinical 
relevance of these kinetics, it is more appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves (as 
discussed in 5.1). 
Insulin  lispro  maintains  more  rapid  absorption  when  compared  to  soluble  human  insulin  in  patients 
with  renal  impairment.  In  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  over  a  wide  range  of  renal  function  the 
pharmacokinetic  differences  between  insulin  lispro  and  soluble  human  insulin  were  generally 
maintained  and  shown  to  be  independent  of  renal  function.    Insulin  lispro  maintains  more  rapid 
absorption  and  elimination  when  compared  to  soluble  human  insulin  in  patients  with  hepatic 
impairment. 
Insulin lispro 200 units/ml solution for injection was bioequivalent to insulin lispro 100 units/ml 
solution for injection after subcutaneous administration of a single 20 unit dose in healthy subjects. 
Time to maximum concentration was also similar between formulations.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In in vitro tests, including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells, insulin lispro 
behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrate that the 
dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro is equivalent to human insulin. Acute, 
one month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings. 
Insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies.

important information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, 
even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

How to store Humalog 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Humalog is and what it is used for  
Humalog is used to treat diabetes. Humalog works more quickly than normal human insulin because 
the insulin molecule has been changed slightly. 
You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your 
blood. Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. It 
works very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin (2 to 5 hours). You should normally 
use Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Humalog as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of insulin 
comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your insulin unless 
your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. 
Humalog is suitable for use in adults and children.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Humalog  
Do NOT use Humalog 
- 
if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how 
to deal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you use more Humalog than you should). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
• 
Always check the pack and the vial label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it 
from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog that your doctor has told you to use. 
If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not 
feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed 
later in this leaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to 
exercise and how much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by 
testing your blood glucose often.

Have you recently become ill? 
Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? 
Are you exercising more than usual? 
A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human 
insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you 
often have hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor. 
If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes 
nurse 
- 
- 
- 
The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. 
You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. 
The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and 
meals at different times from when you are at home. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke 
who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. 
Inform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual 
shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Humalog). Contact your 
doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting a different area. Your 
doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Humalog 
Your insulin needs may change if you are taking  
the contraceptive pill,  
steroids,  
thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  
• 
• 
• 
•  oral hypoglycaemics,  
• 
acetyl salicylic acid,  
• 
sulpha antibiotics,  
•  octreotide,  
• 
•  beta-blockers, or  
• 
“beta2 stimulants” (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  
some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors),  
•  danazol,  
• 
• 
some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  
angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
Please tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription (see section “Warnings and precautions”). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of 
insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the 
remaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Ask your doctor for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you 
have: 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
 115 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
Humalog contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3.  How to use Humalog 
Always use Humalog exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you 
are not sure. 
Dose 
• 
• 
• 
You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you can inject 
soon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, 
and how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes 
clinic regularly. 
If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a 
Humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the 
first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Inject Humalog under the skin. You should only inject it into a muscle if your doctor has told 
you to. 
Preparing Humalog 
• 
Humalog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. But you must use it only if 
it looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. Check each time 
you inject yourself. 
Injecting Humalog 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Clean the rubber 
stopper on the vial, but do not remove the stopper. 
Use a clean, sterile syringe and needle to pierce the rubber stopper and draw in the amount of 
Humalog you want. Your doctor or clinic will tell you how to do this. Do not share your 
needles and syringes. 
Inject under the skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, 
leave the needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do 
not rub the area you have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from 
the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places you inject, as you have been taught. It doesn’t 
matter which injection site you use, either upper arm, thigh, buttock or abdomen, your Humalog 
injection will still work quicker than soluble human insulin. 
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix Humalog with one of the human insulins. For 
example if you do need to inject a mixture, draw the Humalog into the syringe before the long 
acting insulin. Inject the liquid as soon as you have mixed it. Do the same thing every time. You 
should not normally mix Humalog with one of the mixtures of human insulins. You should 
never mix Humalog with insulins produced by other manufacturers or animal insulins. 
You must not administer Humalog by the intravenous route. Inject Humalog as your physician 
or nurse has taught you. Only your physician can administer Humalog by the intravenous route. 
He will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your 
glucose levels are too high. 
Using Humalog in an infusion pump 
• 
Only certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro. Before 
infusing insulin lispro, the manufacturers instructions should be studied to ascertain the 
suitability or otherwise for the particular pump. Read and follow the instructions in the product 
literature supplied with the infusion pump. 
 116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Be sure to use the correct reservoir and catheter for your pump. 
Changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in 
the product information supplied with the infusion set. 
In the event of a hypoglycaemic episode, the infusion should be stopped until the episode is 
resolved. If repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur, notify your doctor or clinic and 
consider the need to reduce or stop your insulin infusion. 
A pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels. 
If an interruption to insulin flow is suspected, follow the instructions in the product literature 
and if appropriate, notify your doctor or clinic. 
•  When used with an insulin infusion pump, Humalog should not be mixed with any other insulin. 
If you use more Humalog than you should  
If you use more Humalog than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar 
may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. 
Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will 
often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your 
breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat 
quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to 
glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. 
If you forget to use Humalog 
If you take less Humalog than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a high blood sugar 
may occur.  Check your blood sugar. 
If hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be 
very serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even 
death (see A and B in section 4 “Possible Side Effects”).  
Three simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Humalog. 
• 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
• 
Always carry sugar with you. 
• 
If you stop using Humalog. 
If you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your insulin 
unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Systemic allergy is rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog, tell your doctor at once. 
rash over the whole body  
difficulty in breathing 
wheezing 
blood pressure dropping 
heart beating fast 
sweating. 
Local allergy is common (≥ 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the 
area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this 
happens to you, tell your doctor. 
 117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lipodystrophy is uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100).  If you inject insulin too often at the same place, 
the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin 
may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help 
prevent these skin changes. 
Oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of 
insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
A.   Hypoglycaemia  
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Humalog or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin; or 
you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
rapid heartbeat 
• 
feeling sick 
• 
cold sweat. 
• 
                      • 
tiredness 
nervousness or shakiness   • 
                       • 
headache 
While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
B.   Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. 
Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your Humalog or other insulin; 
taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; 
eating a lot more than your diet allows; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. The symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
no appetite 
fruity smell on the breath 
feeling or being sick 
feeling sleepy 
flushed face  
thirst   
• 
• 
• 
Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. 
Illness 
C.  
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor.

Package leaflet: Information for the user 
Humalog 100 units/ml solution for injection in cartridge 
insulin lispro 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains 
important information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, 
even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

4.  Possible side effects 
5.  How to store Humalog 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Humalog is and what it is used for 
Humalog is used to treat diabetes. Humalog works more quickly than normal human insulin because 
the insulin molecule has been changed slightly.  
You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your 
blood. Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. It 
works very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin (2 to 5 hours). You should normally 
use Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal.  
Your doctor may tell you to use Humalog as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of insulin 
comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your insulin unless 
your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. 
Humalog is suitable for use in adults and children.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Humalog  
Do NOT use Humalog 
- 
if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to 
deal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you use more Humalog than you should). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
•  Always check the pack and the cartridge label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it 
• 
from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog that your doctor has told you to use. 
If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the 
warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this 
leaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how 
much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood 
glucose often. 
 121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin 
• 
have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have 
hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor. 
If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes 
nurse 
- 
- 
-  
Have you recently become ill? 
Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? 
Are you exercising more than usual? 
•  The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. 
•  You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. 
The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals 
at different times from when you are at home. 
•  Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke 
who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. 
Inform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual 
shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Humalog). Contact your 
doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting a different area. Your 
doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Humalog 
Your insulin needs may change if you are taking  
•  the contraceptive pill,  
•  steroids,  
•  thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  
•  oral hypoglycaemics,  
•  acetyl salicylic acid,  
•  sulpha antibiotics,  
•  octreotide,  
•  “beta2 stimulants” (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  
•  beta-blockers, or  
•  some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  
•  danazol,  
•  some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  
•  angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
Please tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription (see section “Warnings and precautions”). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of 
insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the 
remaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Ask your doctor for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you 
have: 
• 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
 122 
 
 
 
 
 
Humalog contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Humalog 
The 3 ml cartridge is only for use in Lilly 3 ml pens. It is not for use in 1.5 ml pens. 
Always use Humalog exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you 
are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge must be used by you only, 
even if the needle on the delivery device is changed. 
Dose 
• 
• 
• 
You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you can inject 
soon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, 
and how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes 
clinic regularly. 
If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a 
Humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the 
first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Inject Humalog under the skin. You should only inject it into a muscle if your doctor has told 
you to. 
Preparing Humalog 
• 
Humalog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. But you must use it only if 
it looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. Check each time 
you inject yourself. 
Getting the pen ready to use 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. Disinfect the rubber membrane of the cartridge. 
You must only use Humalog cartridges in Lilly insulin pens. Please make sure that 
Humalog or Lilly cartridges are mentioned in the leaflet accompanying your pen. The 
3 ml cartridge only fits the 3 ml pen. 
Follow the instructions that come with the pen. Put the cartridge into the pen. 
You will set the dose to 1 or 2 units. Then hold the pen with the needle pointing up and tap the 
side of the pen so that any bubbles float to the top. With the pen still pointing up, press the 
injection mechanism. Do this until a drop of Humalog comes out of the needle. There may still 
be some small air bubbles left in the pen. These are harmless, but if the air bubble is too big, it 
may make the dose of your injection less accurate. 
Injecting Humalog 
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the 
skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, leave the needle 
in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area 
you have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection 
and that you ‘rotate’ the places you inject, as you have been taught. It doesn’t matter which 
injection site you use, either upper arm, thigh, buttock or abdomen, your Humalog injection will 
still work quicker than soluble human insulin. 
You must not administer Humalog by the intravenous route. Inject Humalog as your physician 
or nurse has taught you. Only your physician can administer Humalog by the intravenous route. 
He will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your 
glucose levels are too high. 
• 
• 
• 
 123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After injecting 
• 
As soon as you have done the injection, take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap. 
This will keep the Humalog sterile and prevent leaking. It will also stop air going back into the 
pen and the needle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace the 
cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen. 
Further injections 
• 
Before every injection, dial 1 or 2 units and press the injection mechanism with the pen pointing 
up until a drop of Humalog comes out of the needle. You can see how much Humalog is left by 
looking at the gauge on the side of the cartridge. The distance between each mark on the gauge 
is about 20 units. If there is not enough for your dose, change the cartridge. 
Do not mix any other insulin in a Humalog cartridge. Once the cartridge is empty, do not use it 
again.  
Using Humalog in an infusion pump 
• 
Only certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro. Before 
infusing insulin lispro, the manufacturers instructions should be studied to ascertain the 
suitability or otherwise for the particular pump. Read and follow the instructions in the product 
literature supplied with the infusion pump. 
Be sure to use the correct reservoir and catheter for your pump. 
Changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in 
the product information supplied with the infusion set. 
In the event of a hypoglycaemic episode, the infusion should be stopped until the episode is 
resolved. If repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur, notify your doctor or clinic and 
consider the need to reduce or stop your insulin infusion. 
A pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels. 
If an interruption to insulin flow is suspected, follow the instructions in the product literature 
and if appropriate, notify your doctor or clinic. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  When used with an insulin infusion pump, Humalog should not be mixed with any other insulin. 
If you use more Humalog than you should 
If you use more Humalog than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar 
may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. 
Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will 
often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your 
breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat 
quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to 
glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. 
If you forget to use Humalog 
If you take less Humalog than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a high blood sugar 
may occur.  Check your blood sugar 
If hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be 
very serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even 
death (see A and B in section 4 “Possible Side Effects”). 
Three simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Humalog, or a spare pen and cartridges, in case 
you lose your pen or cartridges or they get damaged. 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
•

If you stop using Humalog. 
If you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your insulin 
unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Systemic allergy is rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog, tell your doctor at once. 
rash over the whole body  
difficulty in breathing 
wheezing 
blood pressure dropping 
heart beating fast 
sweating 
Local allergy is common (≥ 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the 
area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this 
happens to you, tell your doctor. 
Lipodystrophy is uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100).  If you inject insulin too often at the same place, 
the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin 
may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help 
prevent these skin changes. 
Oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of 
insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
A.   Hypoglycaemia  
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Humalog or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin; or 
you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
nervousness or shakiness  
headache 
rapid heartbeat 
feeling sick 
cold sweat. 
• 
• 
• 
While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
 125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B.   Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. 
Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your Humalog or other insulin; 
taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; 
eating a lot more than your diet allows; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. The symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
no appetite 
fruity smell on the breath 
feeling or being sick. 
feeling sleepy 
flushed face  
thirst   
Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. 
Illness 
C.  
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor. 
5. 
How to store Humalog 
Before the first use store your Humalog in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze.  
Keep your cartridge in use at room temperature (below 30°C) and discard after 28 days. Do not put it 
near heat or in the sun. Do not keep your pen or the cartridges you are using in the fridge. The pen 
with the inserted cartridge should not be stored with the needle attached. 
Keep out of the sight and reach of children. 
Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry 
date refers to the last day of that month.  
Do not use this medicine if you notice it is coloured or it has solid pieces in it. You must use it only if 
it looks like water. Check this each time you inject yourself. 
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to 
dispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Humalog Mix25 is and what it is used for 
Humalog Mix25 is used to treat diabetes.  Humalog Mix25 is a premixed suspension. Its active 
substance is insulin lispro.  25% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix25 is dissolved in water and it 
works more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed 
slightly.  75% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix25 is available in a suspension together with 
protamine sulphate, so that its action is prolonged. 
You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in 
your blood. Humalog Mix25 is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the 
long term. Humalog Mix25 works very quickly and longer than soluble insulin. You should 
normally use Humalog Mix25 within 15 minutes of a meal. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Humalog Mix25 as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of 
insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your 
insulin unless your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Humalog  Mix25 
Do NOT use Humalog Mix25 
- 
if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to 
deal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog Mix25than you need). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
•  Always check the pack and the vial label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from 
your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog Mix25 that your doctor has told you to use. 
If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the 
warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this 
leaflet.  You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how 
• 
 129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood 
glucose often. 
• 
•  A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin 
have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have 
hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising them, please discuss this with your doctor. 
If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes 
nurse 
- 
- 
-  
Have you recently become ill? 
Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? 
Are you exercising more than usual? 
•  The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. 
•  You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad.  
The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals 
at different times from when you are at home. 
•  Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke 
who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. 
Inform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual 
shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Humalog Mix25). Contact 
your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting a different area. 
Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your 
other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Humalog Mix25 
Your insulin needs may change if you are taking  
•  the contraceptive pill,  
•  steroids,  
•  thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  
•  oral hypoglycaemics,  
•  acetyl salicylic acid,  
•  sulpha antibiotics,  
•  octreotide,  
•  “beta2 stimulants” (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  
•  beta-blockers, or  
•  some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  
•  danazol,  
•  some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  
•  angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
Please tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription (see section “Warnings and precautions”). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of 
insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the 
remaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Ask your doctor for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you 
have: 
 130 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
Humalog Mix25 contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3.  How to use Humalog Mix25 
Always use Humalog Mix25 exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor 
if you are not sure. 
Dose 
• 
• 
• 
You should normally inject Humalog Mix25 within 15 minutes of a meal.  If you need to, you 
can inject soon after a meal.  But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, 
when to use it, and how often.  These instructions are only for you.  Follow them exactly and 
visit your diabetes clinic regularly. 
If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a 
Humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before.  This might just be for the 
first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Inject Humalog Mix25 under the skin. You should not administer it using a different 
administration route. Under no circumstances should Humalog Mix25 be given intravenously. 
Preparing Humalog Mix25 
• 
Vials containing Humalog Mix25 should be rotated in the palms of the hands before use to 
resuspend insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky. Do not shake vigorously as this 
may cause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement of the dose. The vials 
should be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are present or if 
solid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the vial, giving it a frosted appearance. 
Check each time you inject yourself. 
Injecting Humalog Mix25 
• 
• 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Clean the rubber 
stopper on the vial, but do not remove the stopper. 
Use a clean, sterile syringe and needle to pierce the rubber stopper and draw in the amount of 
Humalog Mix25 you want.  Your doctor or clinic will tell you how to do this.  Do not share 
your needles and syringes. 
Inject under the skin, as you were taught.  Do not inject directly into a vein. After your 
injection, leave the needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole 
dose.  Do not rub the area you have just injected.  Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 
cm) from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places you inject, as you have been taught. 
If you use more Humalog Mix25 than you need  
If you use more Humalog Mix25 than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a low 
blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. 
Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will 
often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your 
breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat 
quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to 
glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. 
 131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to use Humalog Mix25  
If you take less Humalog Mix25 than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a high 
blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar 
If hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be 
very serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even 
death (see A and B in section 4 “Possible Side Effects”).  
Three simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
• 
• 
Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Humalog Mix25. 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
If you stop using Humalog Mix25. 
If you take less Humalog Mix25 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your 
insulin unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Systemic allergy is rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
rash over the whole body  
difficulty in breathing 
wheezing 
blood pressure dropping 
heart beating fast 
sweating 
If you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog Mix25, tell your doctor at once. 
Local allergy is common (≥ 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the 
area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this 
happens to you, tell your doctor. 
Lipodystrophy is uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100).  If you inject insulin too often at the same place, 
the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin 
may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help 
prevent these skin changes. 
Oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of 
insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
A.   Hypoglycaemia  
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Humalog Mix25 or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
 132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin; or 
you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
rapid heartbeat 
• 
feeling sick 
• 
cold sweat 
• 
tiredness 
• 
nervousness or shakiness • 
• 
headache 
While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
B.   Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. 
Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your Humalog or other insulin; 
taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; 
eating a lot more than your diet allows; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. The symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
no appetite 
fruity smell on the breath 
feeling or being sick 
feeling sleepy 
flushed face  
thirst   
Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. 
Illness 
C.  
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor. 
5. 
How to store Humalog  Mix25 
Before the first use store your Humalog Mix25 in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. Keep your 
vial in use in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C) or at room temperature (below 30°C) and discard after 28 
days. Do not put it near heat or in the sun.  
Keep out of the sight and reach of children. 
Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry 
date refers to the last day of that month.  
Do not use this medicine if you notice clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to 
the bottom or wall of the vial, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. 
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to 
dispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment.

Contents of the pack and other information  
What Humalog Mix25 100 units/ml suspension for injection in vial contains 
- 
The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a ‘recombinant 
DNA technology’ process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other 
human and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural 
hormone made by the pancreas. 
The other ingredients are protamine sulphate, m-cresol, phenol, glycerol, dibasic sodium 
phosphate 7H2O, zinc oxide and water for injection.  Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid 
may have been used to adjust the acidity.

Inform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual 
shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Humalog Mix25). Contact 
your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting a different area. 
Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your 
other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Humalog Mix25 
Your insulin needs may change if you are taking  
•  the contraceptive pill,  
•  steroids,  
•  thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  
•  oral hypoglycaemics,  
•  acetyl salicylic acid,  
•  sulpha antibiotics,  
•  octreotide,  
•  “beta2 stimulants” (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  
•  beta-blockers, or  
•  some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  
•  danazol,  
•  some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  
•  angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
Please tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription (see section “Warnings and precautions”). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of 
insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the 
remaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Ask your doctor for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you 
have:

Humalog Mix25 contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Humalog Mix25 
The 3 ml cartridge is only for use in Lilly 3 ml pens. It is not for use in 1.5 ml pens. 
Always use Humalog Mix25 exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor 
if you are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge must be used by 
you only, even if the needle on the delivery device is changed. 
Dose 
• 
• 
• 
You should normally inject Humalog Mix25 within 15 minutes of a meal.  If you need to, you 
can inject soon after a meal.  But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, 
when to use it, and how often.  These instructions are only for you.  Follow them exactly and 
visit your diabetes clinic regularly. 
If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a 
Humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before.  This might just be for the 
first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Inject Humalog Mix25 under the skin. You should not administer it using a different 
administration route. Under no circumstances should Humalog Mix25 be given intravenously. 
Preparing Humalog Mix25 
• 
Cartridges containing Humalog Mix25 should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times 
and inverted 180° ten times immediately before use to resuspend insulin until it appears 
uniformly cloudy or milky. If not, repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed. 
Cartridges contain a small glass bead to assist mixing. Do not shake vigorously as this may 
cause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement of the dose. The cartridges 
should be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are present or if 
solid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. 
Check each time you inject yourself. 
Getting the pen ready to use 
• 
• 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. Disinfect the rubber membrane of the cartridge. 
You must only use Humalog Mix25 cartridges in Lilly insulin pens. Please make sure that 
Humalog or Lilly cartridges are mentioned in the leaflet accompanying your pen. The 
3 ml cartridge only fits the 3 ml pen. 
Follow the instructions that come with the pen. Put the cartridge into the pen. 
You will set the dose to 1 or 2 units. Then hold the pen with the needle pointing up and tap the 
side of the pen so that any bubbles float to the top. With the pen still pointing up, press the 
injection mechanism. Do this until a drop of Humalog Mix25 comes out of the needle. There 
may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen. These are harmless, but if the air bubble is 
too big, it may make the dose of your injection less accurate. 
Injecting Humalog Mix25 
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the 
skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, leave the needle 
in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area 
you have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection 
and that you ‘rotate’ the places you inject, as you have been taught. 
 138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After injecting 
• 
As soon as you have done the injection, take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap. 
This will keep the Humalog Mix25 sterile and prevent leaking. It will also stop air going back 
into the pen and the needle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. 
Replace the cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen. 
Further injections 
• 
Before every injection, dial 1 or 2 units and press the injection mechanism with the pen pointing 
up until a drop of Humalog Mix25 comes out of the needle. You can see how much Humalog is 
left by looking at the gauge on the side of the cartridge. The distance between each mark on the 
gauge is about 20 units. If there is not enough for your dose, change the cartridge.  
Do not mix any other insulin in a Humalog Mix25 cartridge. Once the cartridge is empty, do not 
use it again. 
If you use more Humalog Mix25 than you should  
If you use more Humalog Mix25 than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a low 
blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. 
Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will 
often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your 
breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat 
quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to 
glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. 
If you forget to use Humalog Mix25  
If you take less Humalog Mix25 than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a high 
blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar 
If hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be 
very serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even 
death (see A and B in section 4 “Possible Side Effects”).  
Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Humalog Mix25, or a spare pen and cartridges, 
Three simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
in case you lose your pen or cartridges or they get damaged. 
• 
• 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
If you stop using Humalog Mix25. 
If you take less Humalog Mix25 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your 
insulin unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Systemic allergy is rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: 
blood pressure dropping 
• 
• 
heart beating fast 
• 
• 
• 
sweating 
• 
If you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog Mix25, tell your doctor at once. 
rash over the whole body  
difficulty in breathing 
wheezing 
 139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Local allergy is common (≥ 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the 
area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this 
happens to you, tell your doctor. 
Lipodystrophy is uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100). If you inject insulin too often at the same place, 
the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin 
may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help 
prevent these skin changes. 
Oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of 
insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
A.   Hypoglycaemia  
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Humalog Mix25 or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin; or 
you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
nervousness or shakiness  
headache 
rapid heartbeat 
feeling sick 
cold sweat 
• 
• 
• 
While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
B.   Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. 
Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your Humalog or other insulin; 
taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; 
eating a lot more than your diet allows; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. The symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
no appetite 
fruity smell on the breath 
feeling or being sick 
feeling sleepy 
flushed face  
thirst   
Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. 
 140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Illness 
C.  
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor. 
5. 
How to store Humalog  Mix25

Keep your cartridge in use at room temperature (below 30°C) and discard after 28 days. Do not put it 
near heat or in the sun. Do not keep your pen or the cartridges you are using in the fridge. The pen 
with the inserted cartridge should not be stored with the needle attached. 
Keep out of the sight and reach of children. 
Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry 
date refers to the last day of that month.  
Do not use this medicine if you notice clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to 
the bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. 
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to 
dispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment.

Contents of the pack and other information  
What Humalog Mix25 100 units/ml suspension for injection in cartridge contains 
- 
The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a ‘recombinant 
DNA technology’ process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other 
human and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural 
hormone made by the pancreas. 
The other ingredients are protamine sulphate, m-cresol, phenol, glycerol, dibasic sodium 
phosphate 7H2O, zinc oxide and water for injection.  Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid 
may have been used to adjust the acidity.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Humalog Mix50 is and what it is used for 
Humalog Mix50 is used to treat diabetes.  Humalog Mix50 is a premixed suspension. Its active 
substance is insulin lispro.  50% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix50 is dissolved in water and it 
works more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed 
slightly.  50% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix50 is available in a suspension together with 
protamine sulphate, so that its action is prolonged. 
You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in 
your blood. Humalog Mix50 is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the 
long term. Humalog Mix50 works very quickly and longer than soluble insulin. You should 
normally use Humalog Mix50 within 15 minutes of a meal. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Humalog Mix50 as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of 
insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your 
insulin unless your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Humalog Mix50 
Do NOT use Humalog Mix50 
- 
if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to 
deal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog Mix50 than you need). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
•  Always check the pack and the cartridge label for the name and type of the insulin when you get 
it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog Mix50 that your doctor has told you to 
use. 
If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the 
warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this 
leaflet.  You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how 
• 
 144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood 
glucose often. 
• 
•  A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin 
have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have 
hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising them, please discuss this with your doctor. 
If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes 
nurse 
- 
- 
-  
Have you recently become ill? 
Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? 
Are you exercising more than usual? 
•  The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. 
•  You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad.  
The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals 
at different times from when you are at home. 
•  Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke 
who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. 
Inform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual 
shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Humalog Mix50). Contact 
your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting a different area. 
Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your 
other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Humalog Mix50 
Your insulin needs may change if you are taking  
•  the contraceptive pill,  
•  steroids,  
•  thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  
•  oral hypoglycaemics,  
•  acetyl salicylic acid,  
•  sulpha antibiotics,  
•  octreotide,  
•  “beta2 stimulants” (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  
•  beta-blockers, or  
•  some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  
•  danazol,  
•  some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  
•  angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
Please tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription (see section “Warnings and precautions”). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of 
insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the 
remaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Ask your doctor for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you 
have:

3. 
How to use Humalog Mix50 
The 3 ml cartridge is only for use in Lilly 3 ml pens. It is not for use in 1.5 ml pens. 
Always use Humalog Mix50 exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor 
if you are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge must be used by 
you only, even if the needle on the delivery device is changed. 
Dose 
• 
• 
• 
You should normally inject Humalog Mix50 within 15 minutes of a meal.  If you need to, you 
can inject soon after a meal.  But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, 
when to use it, and how often.  These instructions are only for you.  Follow them exactly and 
visit your diabetes clinic regularly. 
If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a 
Humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before.  This might just be for the 
first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Inject Humalog Mix50 under the skin. You should not administer it using a different 
administration route. Under no circumstances should Humalog Mix50 be given intravenously. 
Preparing Humalog Mix50 
• 
Cartridges containing Humalog Mix50 should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times 
and inverted 180° ten times immediately before use to resuspend insulin until it appears 
uniformly cloudy or milky. If not, repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed. 
Cartridges contain a small glass bead to assist mixing. Do not shake vigorously as this may 
cause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement of the dose. The cartridges 
should be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are present or if 
solid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. 
Check each time you inject yourself. 
Getting the pen ready to use 
• 
• 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. Disinfect the rubber membrane of the cartridge. 
You must only use Humalog Mix50 cartridges in Lilly insulin pens. Please make sure that 
Humalog or Lilly cartridges are mentioned in the leaflet accompanying your pen. The 
3 ml cartridge only fits the 3 ml pen. 
Follow the instructions that come with the pen. Put the cartridge into the pen. 
You will set the dose to 1 or 2 units. Then hold the pen with the needle pointing up and tap the 
side of the pen so that any bubbles float to the top. With the pen still pointing up, press the 
injection mechanism. Do this until a drop of Humalog Mix50 comes out of the needle. There 
may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen. These are harmless, but if the air bubble is 
too big, it may make the dose of your injection less accurate. 
Injecting Humalog Mix50 
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the 
skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, leave the needle 
in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area 
you have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection 
and that you ‘rotate’ the places you inject, as you have been taught. 
After injecting 
 146 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
As soon as you have done the injection, take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap. 
This will keep the Humalog Mix50 sterile and prevent leaking. It will also stop air going back 
into the pen and the needle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. 
Replace the cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen. 
Further injections 
• 
Before every injection, dial 1 or 2 units and press the injection mechanism with the pen pointing 
up until a drop of Humalog Mix50 comes out of the needle. You can see how much Humalog is 
left by looking at the gauge on the side of the cartridge. The distance between each mark on the 
gauge is about 20 units. If there is not enough for your dose, change the cartridge.  
Do not mix any other insulin in a Humalog Mix50 cartridge. Once the cartridge is empty, do not 
use it again. 
If you use more Humalog Mix50 than you should 
If you use more Humalog Mix50 than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a low 
blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. 
Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will 
often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your 
breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat 
quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to 
glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. 
If you forget to use Humalog Mix50  
If you take less Humalog Mix50 than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a high 
blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar 
If hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be 
very serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even 
death (see A and B in section 4 “Possible Side Effects”).  
Always keep a spare pen and cartridges, in case you lose your pen or cartridges or they get 
Three simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
damaged. 
• 
• 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
If you stop using Humalog Mix50. 
If you take less Humalog Mix50 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your 
insulin unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Systemic allergy is rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: 
blood pressure dropping 
• 
• 
heart beating fast 
• 
• 
• 
sweating 
• 
If you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog Mix50, tell your doctor at once. 
rash over the whole body  
difficulty in breathing 
wheezing 
 147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Local allergy is common (≥ 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the 
area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this 
happens to you, tell your doctor. 
Lipodystrophy is uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100).  If you inject insulin too often at the same place, 
the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin 
may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help 
prevent these skin changes. 
Oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of 
insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
A.   Hypoglycaemia  
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Humalog Mix50 or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin; or 
you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
nervousness or shakiness  
headache 
rapid heartbeat 
feeling sick 
cold sweat 
• 
• 
• 
While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
B.   Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. 
Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your Humalog or other insulin; 
taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; 
eating a lot more than your diet allows; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. The symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
no appetite 
fruity smell on the breath 
feeling or being sick 
feeling sleepy 
flushed face  
thirst   
Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. 
 148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Illness 
C.  
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor. 
5. 
How to store Humalog Mix50 
Before the first use store your Humalog Mix50 in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze.  
Keep your cartridge in use at room temperature (below 30°C) and discard after 28 days. Do not put it 
near heat or in the sun. Do not keep your pen or the cartridges you are using in the fridge. The pen 
with the inserted cartridge should not be stored with the needle attached. 
Keep out of the sight and reach of children. 
Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry 
date refers to the last day of that month.  
Do not use this medicine if you notice clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to 
the bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. 
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to 
dispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment.

Contents of the pack and other information  
What Humalog Mix50 100 units/ml suspension for injection in cartridge contains 
- 
The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a ‘recombinant 
DNA technology’ process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other 
human and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural 
hormone made by the pancreas. 
The other ingredients are protamine sulphate, m-cresol, phenol, glycerol, dibasic sodium 
phosphate 7H2O, zinc oxide and water for injection.  Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid 
may have been used to adjust the acidity. 
- 
What Humalog Mix50 100 units/ml suspension for injection in cartridge looks like and contents

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Humalog KwikPen is and what it is used for 
Humalog KwikPen is used to treat diabetes. It works more quickly than normal human insulin because 
the insulin molecule has been changed slightly. 
You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your 
blood. Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. It 
works very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin (2 to 5 hours). You should normally 
use Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal.  
Your doctor may tell you to use Humalog KwikPen as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of 
insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your insulin 
unless your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. 
Humalog is suitable for use in adults and children.  
The KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 100 units/ml) of insulin lispro.  
One KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin.  The KwikPen dials 1 unit at a time.  The number of 
units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. You can give 
from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give 
yourself more than one injection.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Humalog KwikPen 
Do NOT use Humalog KwikPen  
- 
if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to 
deal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you use more Humalog than you should). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).

Warnings and precautions  
•  Always check the pack and the label of the pre-filled pen for the name and type of the insulin when 
you get it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog KwikPen that your doctor has told 
you to use. 
•  If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the 
warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this 
leaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how 
much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood 
glucose often. 
•  A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin 
have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have 
hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor. 
•  If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse 
- 
- 
-  
Have you recently become ill? 
Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? 
Are you exercising more than usual? 
•  The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. 
•  You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. 
The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals 
at different times from when you are at home. 
•  Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform 
your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness 
of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
•  This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of someone 
trained to use the Pen. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Humalog KwikPen). Contact 
your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting a different area. 
Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your 
other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Humalog KwikPen 
Your insulin needs may change if you are taking  
•  the contraceptive pill,  
•  steroids,  
•  thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  
•  oral hypoglycaemics,  
•  acetyl salicylic acid,  
•  sulpha antibiotics,  
•  octreotide,  
•  “beta2 stimulants” (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  
•  beta-blockers, or  
•  some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  
•  danazol,  
•  some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  
•  angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
Please tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription  (see section “Warnings and precautions”). 
 153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of 
insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the 
remaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Ask your doctor for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you 
have: 
• 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
Humalog KwikPen contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Humalog KwikPen 
Always use Humalog KwikPen exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your 
doctor if you are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by 
you only, even if the needle is changed. 
Dose 
• 
• 
• 
You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you can inject 
soon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, 
and how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes 
clinic regularly. 
If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a 
Humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the 
first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Humalog KwikPen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you 
need to inject your insulin by another method.   
Preparing Humalog KwikPen  
• 
Humalog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. But you must use it only if 
it looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. Check each time 
you inject yourself. 
Getting the KwikPen ready to use (Please see user manual) 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. 
Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions 
carefully. Here are some reminders. 
Use a clean needle. (Needles are not included). 
Prime your KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the air 
bubbles from your KwikPen. There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen - these 
are harmless. But if the air bubbles are too large it may affect the insulin dose. 
• 
• 
Injecting Humalog  
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the 
skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, leave the needle 
in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area 
you have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection 
and that you ‘rotate’ the places you inject, as you have been taught. It doesn’t matter which 
 154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
injection site you use, either upper arm, thigh, buttock or abdomen, your Humalog injection will 
still work quicker than soluble human insulin. 
You must not administer Humalog by the intravenous route. Inject Humalog as your physician 
or nurse has taught you. Only your physician can administer Humalog by the intravenous route. 
He will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your 
glucose levels are too high. 
After injecting 
• 
As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the KwikPen using the outer 
needle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also stops air entering the pen 
and your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace the cap 
on your pen. 
Further injections 
• 
Every time you use a KwikPen you must use a new needle. Before every injection, clear any air 
bubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the KwikPen with the needle pointing 
up. The scale on the cartridge shows about how many units you have left. 
Do not mix any other insulin in your disposable pen. Once the KwikPen is empty, do not use it 
again. Please get rid of it carefully - your pharmacist or diabetes nurse will tell you how to do 
this. 
• 
Using Humalog in an infusion pump 
• 
KwikPen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin.  Do not use the pen to administer 
Humalog by a different way.  Other forms of Humalog 100 units/ml are available if this is 
necessary.  Speak to your doctor if this applies to you. 
If you use more Humalog than you should 
If you use more Humalog than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar 
may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. 
Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will 
often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your 
breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat 
quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to 
glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. 
If you forget to use Humalog  
If you take less Humalog than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a high blood sugar 
may occur.  Check your blood sugar 
If hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be 
very serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even 
death (see A and B in section 4 “Possible Side Effects”).  
Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Humalog, or a spare pen and cartridges, in case 
Three simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
you lose your KwikPen or it gets damaged. 
• 
• 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
If you stop using Humalog. 
If you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your insulin 
unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Systemic allergy is rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
rash over the whole body  
difficulty in breathing 
wheezing 
blood pressure dropping 
heart beating fast 
sweating 
If you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog, tell your doctor at once. 
Local allergy is common (≥ 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the 
area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this 
happens to you, tell your doctor. 
Lipodystrophy is uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100). If you inject insulin too often at the same place, 
the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin 
may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help 
prevent these skin changes. 
Oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of 
insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
A.   Hypoglycaemia  
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Humalog or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin; or 
you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
nervousness or shakiness  
headache 
rapid heartbeat 
feeling sick 
cold sweat 
• 
• 
• 
While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
B.   Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. 
Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
not taking your Humalog or other insulin; 
taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; 
 156 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
eating a lot more than your diet allows; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. The symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
no appetite 
fruity smell on the breath 
feeling or being sick 
feeling sleepy 
flushed face  
thirst   
• 
• 
• 
Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. 
Illness 
C.  
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor.

Contents of the pack and other information  
What Humalog 100 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection contains 
- 
The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a ‘recombinant 
DNA technology’ process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other 
human and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural 
hormone made by the pancreas. 
The other ingredients are m-cresol, glycerol, dibasic sodium phosphate 7 H2O, zinc oxide and 
water for injection. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may have been used to adjust the 
acidity.  
- 
What Humalog KwikPen looks like and contents of the pack 
Humalog 100 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection is a sterile, clear, colourless, aqueous solution 
and contains 100 units of insulin lispro in each millilitre (100 units/ml) solution for injection. Each 
Humalog KwikPen contains 300 units (3 millilitres). The Humalog KwikPen comes in a pack of 5 pre-
filled pens or a multipack of 2 x 5 pre-filled pens. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. The Humalog 
100 units/ml in your pre-filled pen is the same as the Humalog 100 units/ml, which comes in separate 
Humalog 100 units/ml cartridges. The KwikPen simply has a built in cartridge. When the pre-filled 
pen is empty you cannot use it again.

How to use Humalog Mix25 KwikPen 
Possible side effects 
How to store Humalog Mix25 KwikPen 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Humalog Mix25 KwikPen is and what it is used for 
Humalog Mix25 KwikPen is used to treat diabetes.  It is a premixed suspension. Its active substance is 
insulin lispro.  25% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix25 KwikPen is dissolved in water and it 
works more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed 
slightly.  75% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix25 KwikPen is available in a suspension together 
with protamine sulphate, so that its action is prolonged. 
You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in 
your blood. Humalog Mix25 is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the 
long term. Humalog Mix25 works very quickly and longer than soluble insulin. You should 
normally use Humalog Mix25 within 15 minutes of a meal. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Humalog Mix25 KwikPen as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each 
kind of insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change 
your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. 
The KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 100 units/ml) of insulin lispro.  
One KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin.  The KwikPen dials 1 unit at a time. The number of 
units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. You can give 
from 1 to 60 units in a single injection.  If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give 
yourself more than one injection.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Humalog  Mix25 KwikPen 
Do NOT use Humalog Mix25 KwikPen 
- 
if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to 
deal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog Mix25 than you need). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).

Warnings and precautions  
•  Always check the pack and the label of the pre-filled pen for the name and type of the insulin 
• 
when you get it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog Mix25 KwikPen that your 
doctor has told you to use. 
If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the 
warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this 
leaflet.  You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how 
much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood 
glucose often. 
• 
•  A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin 
have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have 
hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising them, please discuss this with your doctor. 
If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes 
nurse 
- 
- 
-  
Have you recently become ill? 
Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? 
Are you exercising more than usual? 
•  The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. 
•  You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad.  
The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals 
at different times from when you are at home. 
•  Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke 
who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. 
Inform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual 
shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
•  This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of 
someone trained to use the Pen. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Humalog Mix25 KwikPen). 
Contact your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting a 
different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your 
insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Humalog Mix25 KwikPen 
Your insulin needs may change if you are taking  
•  the contraceptive pill,  
•  steroids,  
•  thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  
•  oral hypoglycaemics,  
•  acetyl salicylic acid,  
•  sulpha antibiotics,  
•  octreotide,  
•  “beta2 stimulants” (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  
•  beta-blockers, or  
•  some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  
•  danazol,  
•  some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  
•  angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
Please tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription (see section “Warnings and precautions”). 
 161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of 
insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the 
remaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Ask your doctor for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you 
have: 
• 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
Humalog Mix25 KwikPen contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Humalog Mix25 KwikPen 
Always use Humalog Mix25 KwikPen exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with 
your doctor if you are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used 
by you only, even if the needle is changed. 
Dose 
• 
• 
• 
You should normally inject Humalog Mix25 within 15 minutes of a meal.  If you need to, you 
can inject soon after a meal.  But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, 
when to use it, and how often.  These instructions are only for you.  Follow them exactly and 
visit your diabetes clinic regularly. 
If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a 
Humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before.  This might just be for the 
first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Humalog Mix25 KwikPen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your 
doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method.  
Preparing Humalog Mix25 KwikPen 
• 
The KwikPen should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times and inverted 180° ten times 
immediately before use to resuspend insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky. If not, 
repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed.  Cartridges contain a small glass bead to 
assist mixing.  Do not shake vigorously as this may cause frothing which may interfere with 
the correct measurement of the dose. The cartridges should be examined frequently and should 
not be used if clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or 
wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. 
Getting the KwikPen ready to use (Please see user manual) 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. 
Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen.  Please follow the instructions 
carefully. Here are some reminders. 
Use a clean needle.  (Needles are not included). 
Prime your KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the air 
bubbles from your KwikPen.  There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen - these 
are harmless.  But if the air bubbles are too large it may affect the insulin dose. 
• 
• 
Injecting Humalog Mix25 
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed.  Inject under the 
skin, as you were taught.  Do not inject directly into a vein.  After your injection, leave the 
 162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose.  Do not rub the 
area you have just injected.  Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from where you 
last injected and that you ‘rotate’ the places you inject, as you have been taught. 
After injecting 
• 
As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the KwikPen using the outer 
needle cap.  This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking.  It also stops air entering the 
pen and your needle clogging.  Do not share your needles.  Do not share your pen.  Replace 
the cap on the pen. 
Further injections 
• 
Every time you use a KwikPen you must use a new needle.  Before every injection, clear any air 
bubbles.  You can see how much insulin is left by holding the KwikPen with the needle 
pointing up.  The scale on the cartridge shows about how many units you have left. 
Do not mix any other insulin in your disposable pen.  Once the KwikPen is empty, do not use it 
again.  Please get rid of it carefully - your pharmacist or diabetes nurse will tell you how to do 
this. 
• 
If you use more Humalog Mix25 than you should  
If you use more Humalog Mix25 than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a low 
blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. 
Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will 
often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your 
breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat 
quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to 
glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. 
If you forget to use Humalog Mix25  
If you take less Humalog Mix25 than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a high 
blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar 
If hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be 
very serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even 
death (see A and B in section 4 “Possible Side Effects”).  
Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Humalog Mix25, or a spare pen and cartridges, 
Three simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
in case you lose your KwikPen or it gets damaged. 
• 
• 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
If you stop using Humalog Mix25. 
If you take less Humalog Mix25 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your 
insulin unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Systemic allergy is rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
rash over the whole body  
difficulty in breathing 
blood pressure dropping 
heart beating fast 
 163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
wheezing 
• 
sweating 
If you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog Mix25, tell your doctor at once. 
• 
Local allergy is common (≥ 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the 
area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this 
happens to you, tell your doctor. 
Lipodystrophy is uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100).  If you inject insulin too often at the same place, 
the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin 
may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help 
prevent these skin changes. 
Oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of 
insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
A.   Hypoglycaemia  
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Humalog Mix25 or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin; or 
you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
nervousness or shakiness  
headache 
rapid heartbeat 
feeling sick 
cold sweat 
• 
• 
• 
While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
B.   Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. 
Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your Humalog or other insulin; 
taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; 
eating a lot more than your diet allows; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. The symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
no appetite 
fruity smell on the breath 
feeling or being sick 
feeling sleepy 
flushed face  
thirst   
 164 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. 
Illness 
C.  
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor. 
5.

How to store Humalog Mix50 KwikPen 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Humalog Mix50 KwikPen is and what it is used for 
Humalog Mix50 KwikPen is used to treat diabetes.  It is a premixed suspension. Its active substance is 
insulin lispro.  50% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix50 KwikPen is dissolved in water and it 
works more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed 
slightly.  50% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix50 KwikPen is available in a suspension together 
with protamine sulphate, so that its action is prolonged. 
You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in 
your blood. Humalog Mix50 is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the 
long term. Humalog Mix50 works very quickly and longer than soluble insulin. You should 
normally use Humalog Mix50 within 15 minutes of a meal. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Humalog Mix50 KwikPen as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each 
kind of insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change 
your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. 
The KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 100 units/ml) of insulin lispro.  
One KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin.  The KwikPen dials 1 unit at a time.  The number of 
units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. You can give 
from 1 to 60 units in a single injection.  If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give 
yourself more than one injection.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Humalog  Mix50 KwikPen 
Do NOT use Humalog Mix50 KwikPen 
- 
if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to 
deal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog Mix50 than you need). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).

Warnings and precautions  
•  Always check the pack and the label of the pre-filled pen for the name and type of the insulin 
• 
when you get it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog Mix50 KwikPen that your 
doctor has told you to use. 
If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the 
warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this 
leaflet.  You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how 
much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood 
glucose often. 
• 
•  A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin 
have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have 
hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising them, please discuss this with your doctor. 
If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes 
nurse 
- 
- 
-  
Have you recently become ill? 
Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? 
Are you exercising more than usual? 
•  The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. 
•  You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad.  
The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals 
at different times from when you are at home. 
•  Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke 
who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. 
Inform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual 
shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
•  This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of 
someone trained to use the Pen. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Humalog Mix50 KwikPen). 
Contact your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting a 
different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your 
insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Humalog Mix50 KwikPen 
Your insulin needs may change if you are taking  
•  the contraceptive pill,  
•  steroids,  
•  thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  
•  oral hypoglycaemics,  
•  acetyl salicylic acid,  
•  sulpha antibiotics,  
•  octreotide,  
•  “beta2 stimulants” (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  
•  beta-blockers, or  
•  some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  
•  danazol,  
•  some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  
•  angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
Please tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription (see section “Warnings and precautions”). 
 169 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of 
insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the 
remaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Ask your doctor for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you 
have: 
• 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
Humalog Mix50 KwikPen contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Humalog Mix50 KwikPen 
Always use Humalog Mix50 KwikPen exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with 
your doctor if you are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used 
by you only, even if the needle is changed. 
Dose 
• 
• 
• 
You should normally inject Humalog Mix50 within 15 minutes of a meal.  If you need to, you 
can inject soon after a meal.  But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, 
when to use it, and how often.  These instructions are only for you.  Follow them exactly and 
visit your diabetes clinic regularly. 
If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a 
Humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before.  This might just be for the 
first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Humalog Mix50 KwikPen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your 
doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method.    
Preparing Humalog Mix50 KwikPen 
• 
The KwikPen should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times and inverted 180° ten times 
immediately before use to resuspend insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky. If not, 
repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed.  Cartridges contain a small glass bead to 
assist mixing.  Do not shake vigorously as this may cause frothing which may interfere with 
the correct measurement of the dose. The cartridges should be examined frequently and should 
not be used if clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or 
wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. 
Getting the KwikPen ready to use (Please see user manual) 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. 
Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen.  Please follow the instructions 
carefully. Here are some reminders. 
Use a clean needle.  (Needles are not included). 
Prime your KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the air 
bubbles from your KwikPen.  There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen - these 
are harmless.  But if the air bubbles are too large it may affect the insulin dose. 
• 
• 
Injecting Humalog Mix50 
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed.  Inject under the 
skin, as you were taught.  Do not inject directly into a vein.  After your injection, leave the 
 170 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose.  Do not rub the 
area you have just injected.  Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from where you 
last injected and that you ‘rotate’ the places you inject, as you have been taught. 
After injecting 
• 
As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the KwikPen using the outer 
needle cap.  This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking.  It also stops air entering the 
pen and your needle clogging.  Do not share your needles.  Do not share your pen.  Replace 
the cap on the pen. 
Further injections 
• 
Every time you use a KwikPen you must use a new needle.  Before every injection, clear any air 
bubbles.  You can see how much insulin is left by holding the KwikPen with the needle 
pointing up.  The scale on the cartridge shows about how many units you have left. 
Do not mix any other insulin in your disposable pen.  Once the KwikPen is empty, do not use it 
again.  Please get rid of it carefully - your pharmacist or diabetes nurse will tell you how to do 
this. 
• 
If you use more Humalog Mix50 than you need  
If you use more Humalog Mix50 than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a low 
blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. 
Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will 
often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your 
breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat 
quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to 
glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. 
If you forget to use Humalog Mix50  
If you take less Humalog Mix50 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood 
sugar 
If hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be 
very serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even 
death (see A and B in section 4 “Possible Side Effects”).  
Three simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
• 
• 
Always keep a spare pen and cartridges, in case you lose your KwikPen or it gets damaged. 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
If you stop using Humalog Mix50. 
If you take less Humalog Mix50 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your 
insulin unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Systemic allergy is rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: 
blood pressure dropping 
• 
• 
heart beating fast 
• 
• 
• 
sweating 
• 
If you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog Mix50, tell your doctor at once. 
rash over the whole body  
difficulty in breathing 
wheezing 
 171 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Local allergy is common (≥ 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the 
area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this 
happens to you, tell your doctor. 
Lipodystrophy is uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100).  If you inject insulin too often at the same place, 
the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin 
may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help 
prevent these skin changes. 
Oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of 
insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
A.   Hypoglycaemia  
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Humalog Mix50 or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin; or 
you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
nervousness or shakiness  
headache 
rapid heartbeat 
feeling sick 
cold sweat 
• 
• 
• 
While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
B.   Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. 
Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your Humalog or other insulin; 
taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; 
eating a lot more than your diet allows; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. The symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
no appetite 
fruity smell on the breath 
feeling or being sick 
feeling sleepy 
flushed face  
thirst   
Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. 
 172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Illness 
C.  
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor. 
5. 
How to store Humalog Mix50 KwikPen 
Before the first use store your Humalog Mix50 KwikPen in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze.  
Keep your Humalog Mix50 KwikPen in use at room temperature (below 30°C) and discard after 28 
days. Do not put it near heat or in the sun. Do not keep the KwikPen that you are using in the fridge. 
The KwikPen should not be stored with the needle attached. 
Keep out of the sight and reach of children. 
Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry 
date refers to the last day of that month.  
Do not use this medicine if you notice clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to 
the bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. 
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to 
dispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. 
6. 
Contents of the pack and other information  
What Humalog Mix50 100 units/ml KwikPen suspension for injection contains 
- 
The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a ‘recombinant 
DNA technology’ process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other 
human and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural 
hormone made by the pancreas. 
The other ingredients are protamine sulphate, m-cresol, phenol, glycerol, dibasic sodium 
phosphate 7H2O, zinc oxide and water for injection.  Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid 
may have been used to adjust the acidity. 
- 
What Humalog Mix50 100 units/ml KwikPen suspension for injection looks like and contents of 
the pack 
Humalog Mix50 100 units/ml KwikPen suspension for injection is a white, sterile suspension and 
contains 100 units of insulin lispro in each millilitre (100 units/ml) suspension for injection.  50% of 
the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix50 is dissolved in water.  50% of the insulin lispro in Humalog 
Mix50 is available in a suspension together with protamine sulphate. Each Humalog Mix50 KwikPen 
contains 300 units (3 millilitres). The Humalog Mix50 KwikPen comes in a pack of 5 pre-filled pens 
or a multipack of 2 x 5 pre-filled pens. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. The Humalog Mix50 in 
your KwikPen is the same as the Humalog Mix50, which comes in separate Humalog Mix50 
cartridges. The KwikPen simply has a built in cartridge. When the KwikPen is empty you cannot use 
it again.

 USER MANUAL 
KwikPen pre-filled insulin pen 
100 units/ml 
PLEASE READ THIS USER MANUAL BEFORE USE 
Read the User Manual before you start taking your insulin and each time you get another KwikPen. 
There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare 
professional  about your medical condition or your treatment. 
KwikPen (“Pen”) is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 100 units/ml) of insulin. 
You can give yourself multiple  doses using one Pen. The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. You can give from 
1 to 60 units in a single injection. If  your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give yourself 
more than one injection. The plunger  only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice 
that it moves. The plunger will only reach the  end of the cartridge when you have used all 300 units in 
the Pen. 
Do not share your pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. Do not reuse or 
share  needles with other people. You may give an infection to them or get an infection from 
them. 
This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of someone 
trained to  use the Pen.

Step 1: 
• 
• 
Pull the Pen Cap straight off. 
– 
Wipe the Rubber Seal with a swab. 
Do not remove the Pen Label. 
Step 2: 
(For HUMALOG suspensions cloudy insulins only) 
• 
AND 
• 
Gently roll the Pen 10 times.  
Invert the Pen 10 times. 
Mixing is important to make sure you get the right  dose. 
The insulin should look evenly mixed. 
Step 3: 
• 
Check the appearance of the insulin. 
–

Priming your Pen  
Prime before each injection. 
• 
Priming your Pen means removing the air from the Needle and Cartridge that may collect 
during normal use and ensures that the Pen is working correctly. 
If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin. 
• 
Step 7: 
• 
To prime your Pen, turn the Dose Knob to select 2 units. 
Step 8: 
• 
Hold your Pen with the Needle pointing up. Tap the Cartridge  
Holder gently to collect air bubbles at the top 
Step 9: 
• 
Continue holding your Pen with Needle pointing 
up. Push the Dose Knob in until it stops, and “0” 
is seen in the Dose Window. Hold the Dose 
Knob in and count to 5 slowly. 
You should see insulin at the tip of the Needle. 
– 
– 
If you do not see insulin, repeat the 
priming steps, but not more than 4 times. 
If you still do not see insulin, change the 
Needle and repeat the priming steps. 
Small air bubbles are normal and will not affect 
your dose. 
Selecting your dose 
• 
• 
You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. 
If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give more than one injection. 
– 
– 
If you need help deciding how to divide up your dose, ask your healthcare professional. 
You should use a new Needle for each injection and repeat the priming step. 
 179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 10: 
• 
Turn the Dose Knob to select the 
number of units you need to inject. 
The Dose Indicator should line up 
with your dose. 
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. 
The Dose Knob clicks as you 
turn it. 
DO NOT dial your dose by 
counting the clicks because 
you may dial the wrong dose. 
The dose can be corrected by 
turning the Dose Knob in 
either direction until the correct 
dose lines up with the Dose 
Indicator. 
The even numbers are printed 
on the dial. 
The odd numbers, after the 
number 1, are shown as full 
lines. 
(Example: 12 units 
shown in the Dose 
Window) 
• 
Always check the number in the 
Dose Window to make sure you 
have dialled the correct dose. 
(Example: 25 units 
shown in the Dose 
Window) 
• 
• 
• 
The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen. 
If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either: 
– 
– 
It is normal to see a small amount of insulin left in the Pen that you cannot inject. 
inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, or 
get a new Pen and inject the full dose. 
Giving your injection 
• 
• 
• 
Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you. 
Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection. 
Do not try to change your dose while injecting. 
Step 11: 
• 
Choose your injection site. 
Your insulin is injected under the skin 
(subcutaneously) of your stomach area, 
buttocks, upper legs or upper arms. 
•  Wipe your skin with a swab, and let the 
injection site dry before you inject your 
dose. 
 180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 12: 
• 
• 
• 
Insert the Needle into your skin. 
Push the Dose Knob all the way in. 
Continue to hold the Dose 
Knob in and slowly count 
to 5 before removing the 
Needle. 
5 sec 
Do not try to inject your insulin by turning the 
Dose Knob. You will NOT receive your 
insulin by turning the Dose Knob. 
Step 13: 
• 
Pull the Needle out of your skin. 
– 
A drop of insulin at the Needle 
tip is normal. It will not affect 
your dose. 
• 
Check the number in the Dose Window 
– 
– 
– 
– 
If you see “0” in the Dose 
window, you have received the 
full amount you dialled. 
If you do not see “0” in the Dose 
window, do not redial. Insert the 
needle into your skin and finish 
your injection. 
If you still do not think you 
received the full amount you 
dialled for your injection, do not 
start over or repeat that 
injection. Monitor your blood 
glucose as instructed by your 
healthcare professional. 
If you normally need to give 2 
injections for your full dose, be 
sure to give your second 
injection. 
The plunger only moves a little with each 
injection, and you may not notice that it 
moves. 
If you see blood after you take the Needle out 
of your skin, press the injection site lightly 
with a piece of gauze or a swab. Do not rub 
the area. 
 181 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After your injection 
Step 14: 
• 
Carefully replace the Outer Needle Shield. 
Step 15: 
• 
• 
Unscrew the capped Needle and dispose 
of it as described below (see Disposing 
of Pens and Needles section). 
Do not store the Pen with the Needle 
attached to prevent leaking, blocking 
the Needle, and air from entering the 
Pen. 
Step 16: 
• 
Replace the Pen Cap by lining up the 
Cap Clip with the Dose Indicator and 
pushing straight on. 
Disposing of pens and needles  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Put used Needles in a sharps container or a hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not 
throw needles directly into your household waste. 
Do not recycle the filled sharps container. 
Ask your healthcare professional about options to dispose of the Pen and the sharps container 
properly. 
The directions regarding needle handling are not intended to replace local, healthcare 
professional or  institutional policies. 
Storing your pen   
Unused pens 
• 
• 
• 
Store unused Pens in the refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C. 
Do not freeze your insulin. Do not use if it has been frozen. 
Unused Pens may be used until the expiration date printed on the Label, if the Pen has been kept 
in the  refrigerator. 
In-use Pen 
• 
• 
Store the Pen you are currently using at room temperature (below 30°C) and away from dust, 
food and liquids, heat and  light. 
Throw away the Pen you are using after the time specified in the Package Leaflet, even if it still 
has insulin left in it.

General information about the safe and effective use of your pen  
• 
• 
• 
Keep your Pen and Needles out of the sight and reach of children. 
Do not use your Pen if any part looks broken or damaged. 
Always carry an extra Pen in case yours is lost or damaged. 
Troubleshooting 
• 
• 
If you cannot remove the Pen Cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap 
straight off. 
If the Dose Knob is hard to push: 
– 
– 
– 
Pushing the Dose Knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. 
Your Needle may be blocked. Put on a new Needle and prime the Pen. 
You may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new Pen. 
You may need to get a prescription from your healthcare professional.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen is and what it is used for 
Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen is used to treat diabetes. Humalog works more quickly than normal 
human insulin because insulin lispro has been changed slightly in comparison to human insulin. 
Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural hormone made by the pancreas. 
You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your 
blood. Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. It 
works very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin (2 to 5 hours). You should normally 
use Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal.  
Your doctor may tell you to use Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen as well as a longer-acting insulin. 
Each kind of insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change 
your insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  
Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen should be reserved for the treatment of adults with diabetes requiring 
daily doses of more than 20 units of rapid-acting insulin. 
Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (600 units, 
200 units/ml) of insulin lispro.  One KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin.  The KwikPen dials 
1 unit at a time.  The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before 
your injection. You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection.  If your dose is more than 
60 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen 
Do NOT use Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen  
- 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to 
deal with mild hypoglycaemia (see section 3: If you use more Humalog than you should).

Warnings and precautions  
•  Always check the pack and the label of the pre-filled pen for the name and type of the insulin 
when you get it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen that 
your doctor has told you to use. 
•  The Humalog 200 units/ml solution for injection in your pre-filled pen (the KwikPen) should 
ONLY be injected with this pre-filled pen. Do not transfer the insulin lispro from your 
Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen to a syringe. The markings on the insulin syringe will not 
measure your dose correctly. A severe overdose can result, causing low blood sugar which may 
put your life in danger.  Do not transfer insulin from your Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen to any 
other insulin delivery devices like insulin infusion pumps. 
•  Do NOT mix the Humalog 200 units/ml solution for injection in your pre-filled pen (the 
• 
KwikPen) with any other insulin or any other medicine. The Humalog 200 units/ml solution 
for injection should not be diluted. 
If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the 
warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed in section 4 
of this leaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and 
how much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your 
blood glucose often. 
•  A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin 
• 
have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have 
hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor. 
If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes 
nurse 
- 
- 
-  
Have you recently become ill? 
Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? 
Are you exercising more than usual? 
•  You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. 
The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals 
at different times from when you are at home. 
•  Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke 
who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. 
Inform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual 
shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
•  This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of 
someone trained to use the Pen. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Humalog 200 units/ml 
KwikPen). Contact your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start 
injecting a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to 
adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen 
Your insulin needs may change if you are taking  
•  the contraceptive pill,  
•  steroids,  
•  thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  
•  oral hypoglycaemics, (e.g. metformin, acarbose, sulphonylurea agents, pioglitazone, 
empagliflozin, DPP-4-inhibitors like sitagliptin or saxagliptine, ), 
•  acetyl salicylic acid,  
•  sulpha antibiotics,  
•  somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, used to treat an uncommon condition in which you 
make too much growth hormone),  
 185 
 
 
 
•  “beta2 stimulants”such as salbutamol or terbutaline to treat asthma, or ritodrine used to stop 
premature labor, 
•  beta-blockers – to treat high blood pressure., or  
•  some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  
•  danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  
•  some angiotensin converting (ACE) inhibitors, used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure (for example captopril, enalapril), and  
•  specific medicines to treat high blood pressure, kidney damage due to diabetes, and some heart 
problems  (angiotensin II receptor blockers). 
Please tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. (see 
also section “Warnings and precautions”). 
Humalog with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.  Therefore the amount of insulin 
needed may change. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of 
insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the 
remaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Ask your doctor for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you have: 
• 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if 
you are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by you only, 
even if the needle is changed. 
Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen is for patients taking more than 20 units of rapid-acting insulin a day. 
Do not transfer insulin from your Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen to a syringe. The markings on 
the insulin syringe will not measure your dose correctly. A severe overdose can result, causing 
low blood sugar which may put your life in danger. 
Do not use Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection in an insulin infusion pump. 
Dose 
• 
You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you can inject 
soon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, 
and how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes 
clinic regularly. 
 186 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a 
Humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the 
first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Inject Humalog under the skin (subcutaneously).  
Preparing Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen  
• 
Humalog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. But you must use it only if 
it looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. Check each time 
you inject yourself. 
Getting the KwikPen ready to use (Please see user manual) 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. 
Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions 
carefully. Here are some reminders. 
Use a clean needle. (Needles are not included). 
Prime your KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the air 
bubbles from your KwikPen. There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen - these 
are harmless. But if the air bubbles are too large it may affect the insulin dose. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Injecting Humalog  
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the 
skin, as you were taught. After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for five seconds to 
make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area you have just injected. Make sure 
you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places you 
inject, as you have been taught. It doesn’t matter which injection site you use, either upper arm, 
thigh, buttock or abdomen, your Humalog injection will still work quicker than soluble human 
insulin. 
Do not inject Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection directly into a vein 
(intravenously). 
After injecting 
• 
As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the KwikPen using the outer 
needle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also stops air entering the pen 
and your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace the cap 
on your pen. 
Further injections 
• 
Every time you use a KwikPen you must use a new needle. Before every injection, clear any air 
bubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the KwikPen with the needle pointing 
up.  
Once the KwikPen is empty, do not use it again. Please get rid of it carefully - your pharmacist 
or diabetes nurse will tell you how to do this. 
If you use more Humalog than should 
If you use more Humalog than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar 
may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. 
Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will 
often  get  you  over  mild  hypoglycaemia  or  a  minor  insulin  overdose.  If  you  get  worse  and  your 
breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat 
quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to 
glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. 
 187 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to use Humalog  
If you take less Humalog than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a high blood sugar 
may occur.  Check your blood sugar 
If hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated, they can be 
very serious and cause headaches, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), loss of fluids 
(dehydration), unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4 “Possible side effects”).  
Three simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
• 
• 
Always carry a spare pen in case you lose your KwikPen or it gets damaged. 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
If you stop using Humalog. 
If you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your insulin 
unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Severe allergy is rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). The symptoms are as follows:

Local allergy is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people).  Some people get redness, swelling or 
itching around the area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a 
few weeks. If this happens to you, tell your doctor. 
Lipodystrophy is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).. If you inject insulin too often at the 
same place, the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under 
the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The 
insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each 
injection to help prevent these skin changes. 
Oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of 
insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
Hypoglycaemia  
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Humalog or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
 188 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
there is a change in your need for insulin; or 
you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels (see section 2). 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
nervousness or shakiness  
headache 
rapid heartbeat 
feeling sick 
cold sweat 
• 
• 
• 
While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as 
driving a car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. 
Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your Humalog or other insulin; 
taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; 
eating a lot more than your diet allows; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. The symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
no appetite 
fruity smell on the breath 
feeling or being sick 
feeling sleepy 
flushed face  
thirst   
• 
• 
Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse. Get medical help immediately. 
Illness 
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor.

USER MANUAL 
Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection in a pre-filled pen 
insulin lispro  
PLEASE READ THIS USER MANUAL BEFORE USE 
USE ONLY IN THIS PEN, OR 
SEVERE OVERDOSE CAN RESULT 
Read the User Manual before you start taking Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection 
and each time you get another Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen. There may be new information. This 
information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare professional about your medical 
condition or your treatment. 
Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen (“Pen”) is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (600 units, 
200 units/ml) of insulin lispro solution for injection. You can give yourself multiple doses using one 
Pen. The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. You can inject from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. If your dose 
is more than 60 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection. The plunger only 
moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice that it moves. The plunger will only reach 
the end of the cartridge when you have used all 600 units in the Pen. 
This pen is designed to allow you to give more doses than other pens you may have used in the 
past. Dial your usual dose as instructed by your healthcare professional. 
Humalog KwikPen is available in two strengths, 100 units/ml and 200 units/ml. Inject Humalog 
200 units/ml ONLY with your Pen. DO NOT transfer insulin from your Pen to another insulin 
delivery device. Syringes and insulin pumps will not dose 200 units/ml insulin correctly. A severe 
overdose can result, causing very low blood sugar which may put your life in danger. 
Do not share your Pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. Do not reuse or 
share needles with other people.. You may give an infection to them or get an infection from 
them.  
This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of someone 
trained to use the Pen.

Priming your Pen 
Prime before each injection.  
•  Priming your Pen means removing the air from the Needle and Cartridge that may collect during 
normal use and ensures that the Pen is working correctly.  
• 
If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin.  
Step 5: 
To prime your Pen, turn the Dose Knob to select 
2 units. 
Step 6: 
Hold your Pen with the Needle pointing up. Tap 
the Cartridge Holder gently to collect air bubbles 
at the top. 
Step 7: 
Continue holding your Pen with Needle pointing 
up. Push the Dose Knob in until it stops, and “0” 
is seen in the Dose Window. Hold the Dose Knob 
in and count to 5 slowly. 
•  You should see insulin at the tip of the 
Needle. 
 
 
If you do not see insulin, repeat the 
priming steps, but not more than 
8 times. 
If you still do not see insulin, change 
the Needle and repeat the priming 
steps. 
Small air bubbles are normal and will not affect 
your dose. 
 195 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Selecting your dose 
This pen has been designed to deliver the dose that is shown in the window. Dial your usual dose 
as instructed by your healthcare professional. 
•  You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection.  
• 
If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give more than one injection.  
-  If you need help deciding how to divide up your dose, ask your healthcare professional.  
-  You should use a new Needle for each injection and repeat the priming step.  
Step 8: 
Turn the Dose Knob to select the number of units 
you need to inject. The Dose Indicator should 
line up with your dose. 
•  The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. 
•  The Dose Knob clicks as you turn it. 
•  DO NOT dial your dose by counting 
the clicks because you may dial the 
wrong dose. 
•  The dose can be corrected by turning 
the Dose Knob in either direction until 
the correct dose lines up with the Dose 
Indicator. 
•  The even numbers are printed on the 
dial.  
•  The odd numbers, after the number 1, 
are shown as full lines. 
Always check the number in the Dose Window 
to make sure you have dialled the correct 
dose.  
 (Example: 12 units shown in the 
Dose Window) 
 (Example: 25 units shown in the 
Dose Window) 
•  The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen.  
• 
If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either:  
-  inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, or 
-  get a new Pen and inject the full dose.  
 196 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Giving your injection 
• 
Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you.  
•  Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection.  
•  Do not try to change your dose while injecting.  
Step 9: 
Choose your injection site. 
Humalog 200 units/ml solution for injection is 
injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your 
stomach area, buttocks, upper legs or upper 
arms. 
Wipe your skin with a swab, and let your skin 
dry before you inject your dose. 
Step 10: 
Insert the Needle into your skin. 
Push the Dose Knob all the way in.  
Continue to hold the Dose Knob in 
and slowly count to 5 before 
removing the Needle. 
Do not try to inject your insulin by turning the 
Dose Knob. You will NOT receive your insulin 
by turning the Dose Knob. 
Step 11: 
Pull the Needle out of your skin. 
•  A drop of insulin at the Needle tip is 
normal. It will not affect your dose.  
•  Check the number in the Dose 
Window.If you see “0” in the Dose 
Window, you have received the full 
amount you dialled.  
• 
• 
If you do not see “0” in the Dose 
Window, do not redial. Insert the 
needle into your skin and finish your 
injection. 
If you still do not think you received 
the full amount you dialled for your 
injection, do not start over or repeat 
that injection. Monitor your blood 
glucose as instructed by your 
healthcare professional. 
The plunger only moves a little with each 
injection and you may not notice that it moves. 
 197 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you see blood after you take the Needle out of 
your skin, press the injection site lightly with a 
piece of gauze or a swab. Do not rub the area. 
After your injection 
Step 12: 
Carefully replace the Outer Needle Shield. 
Step 13: 
Unscrew the capped Needle and dispose of it as 
described below (see Disposing of Pens and 
Needles section). 
Do not store the Pen with the Needle attached to 
prevent leaking, blocking the Needle, and air 
from entering the Pen. 
Step 14: 
Replace the Pen Cap by lining up the Cap Clip 
with the Dose Indicator and pushing straight on. 
Disposing of Pens and Needles 
•  Put used Needles in a sharps container or hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not 
throw needles directly into your household waste.  
•  Do not recycle the filled sharps container. 
•  Ask your healthcare professional about options to dispose of the Pen and the sharps container 
properly. 
•  The directions regarding needle handling are not intended to replace local, healthcare 
professional or institutional policies. 
Storing your Pen 
Unused Pens 
•  Store unused Pens in the refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C. 
•  Do not freeze Humalog 200 units/ml solution for injection. Do not use if it has been frozen.  
•  Unused Pens may be used until the expiration date printed on the Label, if the Pen has been 
kept in the refrigerator.  
 198 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In-use Pen 
•  Store the Pen you are currently using at room temperature (below 30°C) and away from dust, 
food and liquids, heat and light. 
•  Throw away the Pen you are using after 28 days, even if it still has insulin left in it. 
General information about the safe and effective use of your Pen 
•  Keep your Pen and Needles out of the sight and reach of children. 
•  Do not use your Pen if any part looks broken or damaged. 
•  Always carry an extra Pen in case yours is lost or damaged. 
Troubleshooting 
• 
• 
If you cannot remove the Pen Cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap 
straight off. 
If the Dose Knob is hard to push;  
-  Pushing the Dose Knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. 
-  Your Needle may be blocked. Put on a new Needle and prime the Pen. 
-  You may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new 
Pen. You may need to get a prescription from your healthcare professional. 
•  Do not transfer insulin from the Pen to a syringe or an insulin pump. Severe overdose 
can result.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Humalog Junior KwikPen is and what it is used for 
Humalog Junior KwikPen is used to treat diabetes. Humalog works more quickly than normal human 
insulin because insulin lispro has been changed slightly in comparison to human insulin. Insulin lispro 
is closely related to human insulin which is a natural hormone made by the pancreas. 
You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your 
blood. Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. It 
works very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin (2 to 5 hours). You should normally 
use Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal.  
Your doctor may tell you to use Humalog as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of insulin 
comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your insulin unless 
your doctor tells you to.  
Humalog is suitable for use in adults and children.  
Humalog 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 
100 units/ml) of insulin lispro.  One KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin.  The KwikPen dials 
half unit (0.5 unit) at a time. The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check 
this before your injection. You can give from 0.5 unit to 30 units in a single injection.  If your dose 
is more than 30 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Humalog Junior KwikPen   
Do NOT use Humalog Junior KwikPen  
- 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to 
deal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you use more Humalog than you should).

Warnings and precautions  
•  Always check the pack and the label of the pre-filled pen for the name and type of the insulin when 
you get it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen that 
your doctor has told you to use. 
•  Do NOT mix the Humalog 100 units/ml solution for injection in your pre-filled pen (the 
Junior KwikPen) with any other insulins or any other medicine.  
•  If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the 
warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed in section 4 
of this leaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and 
how much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your 
blood glucose often. 
•  A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin 
have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have 
hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor. 
•  If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse 
- 
- 
-  
Have you recently become ill? 
Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? 
Are you exercising more than usual? 
•  You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. 
The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals 
at different times from when you are at home. 
•  Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform 
your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness 
of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
•  This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of someone 
trained to use the Pen. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Humalog Junior KwikPen). 
Contact your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting a 
different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your 
insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Humalog Junior KwikPen

•  the contraceptive pill,  
•  steroids,  
•  thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  
•  oral hypoglycaemics, (e.g. metformin, acarbose, sulphonylurea agents, pioglitazone, 
empagliflozin, DPP-4-inhibitors like sitagliptin or saxagliptine, ),

Please tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. (see 
also section “Warnings and precautions”). 
Humalog with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.  Therefore the amount of insulin 
needed may change. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of 
insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the 
remaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Ask your doctor for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you 
have: 
• 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
Humalog Junior KwikPen contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Humalog Junior KwikPen  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if 
you are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by you only, 
even if the needle is changed. 
Dose 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The number of half units (0.5 units) is shown in the dose window of your pen. The half units 
(0.5 units) are shown as lines between the numbers. 
Always check the number in the dose window to make sure you have dialled the correct dose. 
You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you can inject 
soon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, 
and how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes 
clinic regularly. 
If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a 
Humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the 
first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Humalog KwikPen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you 
need to inject your insulin by another method.  
Preparing Humalog Junior KwikPen  
• 
Humalog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. But you must use it only if 
it looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. Check each time 
you inject yourself. 
Getting the Junior KwikPen ready to use (Please see user manual) 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. 
Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions 
carefully. Here are some reminders. 
Use a clean needle. (Needles are not included). 
• 
 202 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
• 
Prime your Junior KwikPen  before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the 
air bubbles from your Junior KwikPen . There may still be some small air bubbles left in the 
pen - these are harmless. But if the air bubbles are too large it may affect the insulin dose. 
Injecting Humalog  
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the 
skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, leave the needle 
in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area 
you have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection 
and that you ‘rotate’ the places you inject, as you have been taught. It doesn’t matter which 
injection site you use, either upper arm, thigh, buttock or abdomen, your Humalog injection will 
still work quicker than soluble human insulin. 
You must not administer Humalog by the intravenous route. Inject Humalog as your physician 
or nurse has taught you. Only your physician can administer Humalog by the intravenous route. 
He will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your 
glucose levels are too high. 
After injecting 
• 
As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the Junior KwikPen using the 
outer needle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also stops air entering 
the pen and your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace 
the cap on your pen. 
Further injections 
• 
Every time you use a Junior KwikPen you must use a new needle. Before every injection, clear 
any air bubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the Junior KwikPen with the 
needle pointing up. The scale on the cartridge shows about how many units you have left. 
Once the Junior KwikPen is empty, do not use it again. Please get rid of it carefully - your 
pharmacist or diabetes nurse will tell you how to do this. 
• 
• 
Using Humalog in an infusion pump 
• 
Junior KwikPen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin.  Do not use the pen to 
administer Humalog by a different way.  Other forms of Humalog 100 units/ml are available if 
this is necessary.  Speak to your doctor if this applies to you. 
If you use more Humalog than you should 
If you use more Humalog than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar 
may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. 
Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will 
often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your 
breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat 
quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to 
glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. 
If you forget to use Humalog  
If you take less Humalog than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a high blood sugar 
may occur.  Check your blood sugar 
If hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be 
very serious and cause headaches, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), loss of fluids 
(dehydration), unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4 “Possible Side Effects”).  
Three simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
• 
Always carry a spare pen in case you lose your Junior KwikPen or it gets damaged. 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
 203 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Always carry sugar with you. 
If you stop using Humalog. 
If you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your insulin 
unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Severe allergy is rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). The symptoms are as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
rash over the whole body  
difficulty in breathing 
wheezing 
blood pressure dropping 
heart beating fast 
sweating 
• 
• 
• 
If you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog, contact a doctor at once. 
Local allergy is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people).  Some people get redness, swelling or 
itching around the area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a 
few weeks. If this happens to you, tell your doctor. 
Lipodystrophy is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). If you inject insulin too often at the 
same place, the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under 
the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The 
insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each 
injection to help prevent these skin changes. 
Oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of 
insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
Hypoglycaemia  
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Humalog or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin; or 
you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels (see section 2). 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
nervousness or shakiness  
headache 
rapid heartbeat 
feeling sick 
cold sweat 
• 
• 
• 
 204 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as 
driving a car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. 
Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your Humalog or other insulin; 
taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; 
eating a lot more than your diet allows; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. The symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
no appetite 
fruity smell on the breath 
feeling or being sick 
feeling sleepy 
flushed face  
thirst   
• 
• 
• 
Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. 
Illness 
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor. 
5.

Instructions for Use 
Humalog 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen solution for injection in a pre-filled pen 
insulin lispro  
PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USE 
Read the Instructions for Use before you start taking Humalog Junior KwikPen and each time you get 
another Humalog Junior KwikPen. There may be new information. This information does not take the 
place of talking to your healthcare professional about your medical condition or your treatment. 
Humalog 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen (“Pen”) is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml 
(300 units, 100 units/ml) of insulin lispro solution for injection.  One pen contains multiple doses of 
insulin. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Your healthcare professional will tell you how many units to give as your dose and how to 
inject your prescribed dose of insulin. 
The Pen dials half unit (0.5 unit) at a time. You can give from 0.5 unit to 30 units in a single 
injection.  
Always check the number in the dose window to make sure you have dialed the correct dose. 
If your dose is more than 30 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection.  
The Plunger only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice that it moves. When 
the Plunger reaches the end of the cartridge, you have used all 300 units in the Pen. 
Do not share your Pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. Do not reuse or 
share needles with other people. You may give an infection to them or get an infection from 
them. 
This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of someone 
trained to use the Pen.

How to recognize your Humalog Junior KwikPen: 
•  Pen colour: 
Blue 
•  Dose Knob: 
Blue, with raised ridges on end and side 
•  Label:  White with an orange colour bar and orange-to-yellow and burgundy colour band 
Supplies needed to give your injection: 
•  Humalog Junior KwikPen 
•  KwikPen compatible Needle (BD [Becton, Dickinson and Company] Pen Needles recommended) 
•  Swab 
Needles and swab are not included. 
Preparing your Pen 
•  Wash your hands with soap and water. 
•  Check the Pen to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if 
you use more than 1 type of insulin. 
•  Do not use your Pen past the expiration date printed on the Label or for more than 28 days after 
you first start using the Pen. 
•  Always use a new Needle for each injection to help prevent infections and blocked Needles.  
Step 1: 
•  Pull the Pen Cap straight off. 
–  Do not remove the Pen Label. 
•  Wipe the Rubber Seal with a swab. 
Humalog should look clear and colourless. Do not 
use if it is cloudy, coloured, or has particles or clumps 
in it. 
 209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 2: 
•  Select a new Needle. 
•  Pull off the Paper Tab from the Outer Needle 
Shield. 
Step 3: 
•  Push the capped Needle straight onto the Pen and 
twist the Needle on until it is tight. 
Step 4: 
•  Pull off the Outer Needle Shield. Do not throw it 
away. 
•  Pull off the Inner Needle Shield and throw it 
away. 
Keep 
Throw 
Away 
Priming your Pen 
Prime before each injection. 
•  Priming your Pen means removing the air from the Needle and Cartridge that may collect during 
normal use. It is important to prime your Pen so that it will work correctly. 
• 
If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin. 
Step 5: 
•  To prime your Pen, turn the Dose Knob to select 
2 units. 
Step 6: 
•  Hold your Pen with the Needle pointing up. Tap 
the Cartridge Holder gently to collect air bubbles 
at the top. 
 210 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 7: 
•  Continue holding your Pen with the Needle 
pointing up. Push the Dose Knob in until it stops, 
and “0” is seen in the Dose Window. Hold the 
Dose Knob in and count to 5 slowly. 
You should see insulin at the tip of the Needle. 
– 
– 
If you do not see insulin, repeat the priming 
steps, but not more than 4 times. 
If you still do not see insulin, change the 
Needle and repeat the priming steps. 
Small air bubbles are normal and will not affect your 
dose. 
Selecting your dose 
•  You can give from half unit (0.5 unit) to 30 units in a single injection. 
Always check the number in the Dose Window to make sure you have dialled the correct dose. 
• 
If your dose is more than 30 units, you will need to give more than one injection. 
– 
 Talk to your healthcare professional about how to give your dose. 
–  Use a new Needle for each injection and repeat the priming step. 
– 
If you usually need more than 30 units, ask your healthcare professional if a different 
Humalog KwikPen would be better for you. 
 211 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 8: 
•  Turn the Dose Knob to select the number of units 
you need to inject. The Dose Indicator should line 
up with your dose. 
–  The Pen dials half unit (0.5 unit) at a time. 
–  The Dose Knob clicks as you turn it. 
–  DO NOT dial your dose by counting the 
clicks because you may dial the wrong dose. 
–  The dose can be corrected by turning the Dose 
Knob in either direction until the correct dose 
lines up with the Dose Indicator. 
–  The whole unit numbers are printed on the 
dial. 
–  The half units  are shown as  lines between 
the numbers. 
•  Always check the number in the Dose Window 
to make sure you have dialled the correct dose. 
Example: 4 units 
shown in the  
Dose Window 
Example: 10 ½ (10.5) 
units shown in the 
Dose Window 
•  The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen. 
• 
If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either: 
– 
inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, or 
–  get a new Pen and inject the full dose. 
• 
It is normal to see a small amount of insulin left in the Pen that you can not inject. 
Giving your injection 
• 
Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you. 
•  Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection. 
•  Do not try to change your dose while injecting. 
Step 9: 
•  Choose your injection site. 
  Humalog is injected under the skin 
(subcutaneously) of your stomach area, 
buttocks, upper legs or upper arms. 
•  Wipe your skin with a swab, and let your 
skin dry before you inject your dose. 
 212 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 10: 
• 
Insert the Needle into your skin. 
•  Push the Dose Knob all the way in. 
•  Continue to hold the Dose 
Knob in and slowly count to 5 
before removing the Needle. 
Do not try to inject your insulin by 
turning the Dose Knob. You will 
NOT receive your insulin by 
turning the Dose Knob. 
Step 11: 
•  Pull the Needle out of your skin. 
5sec 
–  A drop of insulin at the Needle tip is normal. It 
will not affect your dose. 
•  Check the number in the Dose Window 
- 
- 
- 
If you see “0” in the Dose window, you have 
received the full amount you dialled. 
If you do not see “0” in the Dose window, you 
did not receive your full dose. Do not redial. 
Insert the needle into your skin and finish your 
injection. 
If you still do not think you received the full 
amount you dialled for your injection, do not 
start over or repeat that injection. Monitor 
your blood glucose and call your healthcare 
professional for further instructions. 
The plunger only moves a little with each injection, 
and you may not notice that it moves. 
If you see blood after you take the Needle out of your 
skin, press the injection site lightly with a piece of 
gauze or a swab. Do not rub the area. 
 213 
 
 
 
 
After your injection 
Step 12: 
•  Carefully replace the Outer Needle Shield. 
Step 13: 
•  Unscrew the capped Needle and dispose of it as 
described below (see Disposing of Pens and 
Needles section). 
•  Do not store the Pen with the Needle attached to 
prevent leaking, blocking the Needle, and air 
from entering the Pen. 
Step 14: 
•  Replace the Pen Cap by lining up the Cap Clip 
with the Dose Indicator and pushing straight on. 
Disposing of Pens and Needles 
•  Put used Needles in a sharps container or a hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not throw 
needles directly into your household waste.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Humalog Tempo Pen is and what it is used for 
Humalog Tempo Pen is used to treat diabetes. Humalog works more quickly than normal human 
insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed slightly in comparison to human insulin. 
Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural hormone made by the pancreas. 
You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your 
blood. Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. It 
works very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin (2 to 5 hours). You should normally 
use Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal.  
Your doctor may tell you to use Humalog Tempo Pen as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of 
insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your insulin 
unless your doctor tells you to.  
Humalog is suitable for use in adults and children.  
The Tempo Pen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 100 units/ml) of insulin 
lispro.  One Tempo Pen contains multiple doses of insulin.  The Tempo Pen dials 1 unit at a time.  The 
number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. You 
can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection.  If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to 
give yourself more than one injection.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Humalog Tempo Pen 
Do NOT use Humalog Tempo Pen 
- 
if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to 
deal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you use more Humalog than you should). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).

Warnings and precautions  
•  Always check the pack and the label of the pre-filled pen for the name and type of the insulin 
when you get it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog 100 units/ml Tempo Pen 
that your doctor has told you to use. 
•  If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel 
the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed in 
section 4 of this leaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to 
exercise and how much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by 
testing your blood glucose often.  
•  A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human 
insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you 
often have hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor. 
•  If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes 
nurse 
- 
- 
-  
Have you recently become ill? 
Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? 
Are you exercising more than usual? 
•  The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. 
•  You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. 
The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and 
meals at different times from when you are at home. 
•  Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke 
who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. 
Inform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual 
shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
•  This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of 
someone trained to use the Pen. 
•  The Tempo Pen contains a magnet. If you have a medical device fitted, such as a heart 
pacemaker, this may not work correctly if the Tempo Pen is held too close. The magnetic field 
extends to approximately 1.5 cm. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Humalog Tempo Pen). 
Contact your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting a 
different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your 
insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Other medicines and Humalog Tempo Pen 
Your insulin needs may change if you are taking  
•  the contraceptive pill,  
•  steroids,  
•  thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  
•  oral hypoglycaemics,  
•  acetyl salicylic acid,  
•  sulpha antibiotics,  
•  octreotide,  
•  “beta2 stimulants” (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  
•  beta-blockers, or  
•  some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  
•  danazol,  
•  some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  
•  angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
 217 
 
 
 
 
 
Please tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription  (see section “Warnings and precautions”). 
Humalog with alcohol  
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Therefore the amount of insulin 
needed may change. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of 
insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the 
remaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Ask your doctor for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you 
have: 
- 
- 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
Humalog Tempo Pen contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Humalog Tempo Pen 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if 
you are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by you only, 
even if the needle is changed. 
Dose 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Always check the number in the dose window to make sure you have dialled the correct dose.  
You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you can inject 
soon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, 
and how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes 
clinic regularly. 
If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a 
Humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the 
first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Humalog Tempo Pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if 
you need to inject your insulin by another method.   
Preparing Humalog Tempo Pen 
- 
Humalog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. But you must use it only if 
it looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. Check each time 
you inject yourself. 
Getting the Tempo Pen ready to use (Please see user manual) 
- 
- 
First wash your hands. 
Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions 
carefully. Here are some reminders. 
Use a clean needle. (Needles are not included). 
Prime your Tempo Pen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the air 
bubbles from your Tempo Pen. There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen - these 
are harmless. But if the air bubbles are too large it may affect the insulin dose. 
- 
- 
 218 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Injecting Humalog  
- 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the 
skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, leave the needle 
in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area 
you have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection 
and that you ‘rotate’ the places you inject, as you have been taught. It doesn’t matter which 
injection site you use, either upper arm, thigh, buttock or abdomen, your Humalog injection will 
still work quicker than soluble human insulin. 
You must not administer Humalog by the intravenous route. Inject Humalog as your physician 
or nurse has taught you. Only your physician can administer Humalog by the intravenous route. 
He will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your 
glucose levels are too high. 
After injecting 
- 
As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the Tempo Pen using the outer 
needle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also stops air entering the pen 
and your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace the cap 
on your pen. 
If you are unsure how much you have injected then check your blood sugar levels before deciding if 
you need another injection. 
Further injections 
- 
Every time you use a Tempo Pen you must use a new needle. Before every injection, clear any 
air bubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the Tempo Pen with the needle 
pointing up. The scale on the cartridge shows about how many units you have left. 
Do NOT mix the Humalog 100 units/ml solution for injection in your pre-filled pen with any 
other insulins or any other medicine.  
Once the Tempo Pen is empty, do not use it again. Please get rid of it carefully - your 
pharmacist or diabetes nurse will tell you how to do this. 
- 
- 
- 
Tempo Smart Button 
The Tempo Pen is designed to work with the Tempo Smart Button. The optional additional feature 
Tempo Smart Button is a product available for the Tempo Pen, which may be used for transmitting 
dose information to a mobile application. The Tempo Pen can be used with or without the Tempo 
Smart Button attached. See instructions provided with the Tempo Smart Button and the mobile 
application for further information.  
Using Humalog in an infusion pump 
- 
Tempo Pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Do not use the pen to administer 
Humalog by a different way. Other forms of Humalog 100 units/ml are available if this is 
necessary. Speak to your doctor if this applies to you. 
If you use more Humalog than you should 
If you use more Humalog than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar 
may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. 
Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will 
often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your 
breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat 
quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to 
glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. 
 219 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to use Humalog 
If you take less Humalog than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a high blood sugar 
may occur.  Check your blood sugar 
If hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be 
very serious and cause headaches, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), loss of fluids 
(dehydration), unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4 “Possible Side Effects”).  
Three simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
• 
• 
Always carry a spare pen in case you lose your Tempo Pen or it gets damaged. 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
If you stop using Humalog. 
If you use less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your insulin 
unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Severe allergy is rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). The symptoms are as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
rash over the whole body  
difficulty in breathing 
wheezing 
blood pressure dropping 
heart beating fast 
sweating 
• 
• 
• 
If you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog, contact a doctor at once. 
Local allergy is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people).  Some people get redness, swelling or 
itching around the area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a 
few weeks. If this happens to you, tell your doctor. 
Lipodystrophy is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). If you inject insulin too often at the 
same place, the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under 
the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The 
insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each 
injection to help prevent these skin changes. 
Oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of 
insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
A.   Hypoglycaemia  
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Humalog or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
 220 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin; or 
you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels (see section 2). 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
nervousness or shakiness  
headache 
rapid heartbeat 
feeling sick 
cold sweat 
• 
• 
• 
While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
B.   Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. 
Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your Humalog or other insulin; 
taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; 
eating a lot more than your diet allows; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. The symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
no appetite 
fruity smell on the breath 
feeling or being sick 
feeling sleepy 
flushed face  
thirst   
• 
• 
• 
Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. 
Illness 
C.  
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor. 
5. 
How to store Humalog Tempo Pen  
Before the first use store your Humalog Tempo Pen in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze.  
Keep your Humalog Tempo Pen in use at room temperature (below 30°C) and discard after 28 days 
even if some of the solution remains. Do not put it near heat or in the sun. Do not keep the Tempo Pen 
that you are using in the fridge. The Tempo Pen should not be stored with the needle attached. 
Keep out of the sight and reach of children. 
Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry 
date refers to the last day of that month.  
Do not use this medicine if you notice the solution is coloured or it has solid pieces in it. You must use 
it only if it looks like water. Check this each time you inject yourself. 
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to 
dispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment.

Instructions for use 
Humalog 100 units/ml Tempo Pen solution for injection in a pre-filled pen 
insulin lispro 
PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USE 
Read the instructions for use before you startusing your insulin and each time you get another 
Humalog Tempo Pen. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of 
talking to your healthcare professional about your medical condition or your treatment. 
Tempo Pen (“Pen”) is a disposable prefilled Pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 100 units/ml) of insulin. 
You can give yourself multiple doses using one Pen. The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. You can give from 
1 to 60 units in a single injection. If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give yourself 
more than one injection. The plunger only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice 
that it moves. The plunger will only reach the end of the cartridge when you have used all 300 units in 
the Pen. 
The Tempo Pen is designed to work with the Tempo Smart Button.  The Tempo Smart Button is an 
optional product that can be attached to the Tempo Pen dose knob and aids in transmitting Humalog 
dose information from the Tempo Pen to a compatible mobile application.  The Tempo Pen injects 
insulin with or without the Tempo Smart Button attached. Your Smart Button must be attached to a 
Tempo Pen to record or transfer dose data. Push the Smart Button straight down on the dose knob until 
you hear a snap or feel the Smart Button snap into place. To transmit data to the mobile application, 
follow the instructions provided with the Tempo Smart Button and the instructions with the mobile 
application. 
Do not share your Pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. Do not reuse or 
share needles with other people. You may give an infection to them or get an infection from 
them. 
This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of someone 
trained to use the Pen.

•  Labels: White with Burgundy colour bar 
Supplies needed to give your injection: 
•  Tempo Pen containing your insulin 
•  Tempo Pen compatible Needle (BD [Becton, Dickinson and Company] Pen Needles 
recommended) 
•  Swab 
Needles and swab are not included 
Preparing your Pen 
•  Wash your hands with soap and water. 
•  Check the Pen to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if 
you use more than 1 type of insulin. 
•  Do not use your Pen past the expiration date printed on the label. After you start using the Pen, 
throw your Pen away after the in-use time specified in the package leaflet. 
•  Always use a new needle for each injection to help prevent infections and blocked needles. 
Step 1: 
•  Pull the Pen cap straight off. 
–  Do not remove the Pen label. 
•  Wipe the rubber seal with a swab. 
  HUMALOG should look clear and 
colourless. Do not use if it is cloudy, 
coloured, or has particles or clumps in it. 
Step 2: 
•  Select a new needle. 
•  Pull off the paper tab from the outer needle 
shield.

Step 3: 
•  Push the capped needle straight onto the 
Pen and twist the needle on until it is tight. 
Step 4: 
•  Pull off the outer needle shield. Do not 
throw it away. 
•  Pull off the inner needle shield and throw it 
away. 
Keep  Throw Away 
Priming your Pen 
Prime before each injection. 
•  Priming your Pen means removing the air from the needle and cartridge that may collect during 
normal use and ensures that the Pen is working correctly. 
• 
If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin. 
Step 5: 
•  To prime your Pen, turn the dose knob to 
select 2 units. 
Step 6: 
•  Hold your Pen with the needle pointing up. 
Tap the cartridge holder gently to collect air 
bubbles at the top. 
Step 7: 
•  Continue holding your Pen with needle 
pointing up. Push the dose knob in until it 
stops, and “0” is seen in the dose window. 
Hold the dose knob in and count to 5 slowly. 
  You should see insulin at the tip of the 
needle. 
– 
– 
If you do not see insulin, repeat the priming 
steps, but not more than 4 times. 
If you still do not see insulin, change the 
needle and repeat the priming steps. 
Small air bubbles are normal and will not affect 
your dose.

Selecting your dose 
•  You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. 
• 
If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give more than one injection. 
– 
If you need help deciding how to divide up your dose, ask your healthcare professional. 
–  You should use a new needle for each injection and repeat the priming step. 
Step 8: 
•  Turn the dose knob to select the number 
of units you need to inject. The dose 
indicator should line up with your dose. 
–  The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. 
–  The dose knob clicks as you turn it. 
–  DO NOT dial your dose by counting the 
clicks because you may dial the wrong 
dose. 
–  The dose can be corrected by turning the 
dose knob in either direction until the 
correct dose lines up with the dose 
indicator. 
–  The even numbers are printed on the dial. 
–  The odd numbers, after the number 1, are 
shown as full lines. 
•  Always check the number in the dose 
window to make sure you have dialed 
the correct dose. 
(Example: 12 units 
shown in the dose 
window) 
(Example: 25 units 
shown in the dose 
window) 
•  The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen. 
• 
If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either: 
– 
inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, or 
–  get a new Pen and inject the full dose. 
• 
It is normal to see a small amount of insulin left in the Pen that you cannot inject. 
Giving your injection 
• 
Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you. 
•  Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection. 
•  Do not try to change your dose while injecting.

Step 9: 
•  Choose your injection site. 
  Your insulin is injected under the skin 
(subcutaneously) of your stomach area, 
buttocks, upper legs or upper arms. 
•  Wipe the skin with a swab, and let the 
injection site dry before you inject your dose. 
Step 10: 
• 
Insert the needle into your skin. 
•  Push the dose knob all the way in. 
•  Continue to hold the Dose 
knob in and slowly count to 5 
before removing the needle. 
5 sec 
Do not try to inject your insulin by turning the 
dose knob. You will NOT receive your insulin by 
turning the dose knob. 
Step 11: 
•  Pull the needle out of your skin. 
–  A drop of insulin at the needle tip is 
normal. It will not affect your dose. 
•  Check the number in the dose window 
– 
– 
– 
If you see “0” in the dose window, you 
have received the full amount you dialed. 
If you do not see “0” in the dose window, 
do not redial. Insert the needle into your 
skin and finish your injection. 
If you still do not think you received the 
full amount you dialed for your injection, 
do not start over or repeat that 
injection. Monitor your blood glucose as 
instructed by your healthcare 
professional. 
– 
If you normally need to give 2 injections 
for your full dose, be sure to give your 
second injection. 
The plunger only moves a little with each 
injection, and you may not notice that it moves. 
If you see blood after you take the needle out of 
your skin, press the injection site lightly with a 
piece of gauze or a swab. Do not rub the area.

After your injection 
Step 12: 
•  Carefully replace the outer needle shield. 
Step 13: 
•  Unscrew the capped needle and dispose of 
it as described below (see disposing of 
Pens and needles section). 
•  Do not store the Pen with the needle 
attached to prevent leaking, blocking the 
needle, and air from entering the Pen. 
Step 14: 
•  Replace the Pen cap by lining up the cap 
clip with the dose indicator and pushing 
straight on. 
Disposing of Pens and Needles 
•  Put used needles in a sharps container or a hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not throw 
needles directly into your household waste. 
•  Do not recycle the filled sharps container. 
•  Ask your healthcare professional about options to dispose of the pens and the sharps container 
properly. 
•  The directions regarding needle handling are not intended to replace local, healthcare professional 
or institutional policies. 
Storing your Pen 
Unused Pens 
•  Store unused Pens in the refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C. 
•  Do not freeze your insulin. Do not use if it has been frozen. 
•  Unused Pens may be used until the expiration date printed on the label, if the Pen has been kept in 
the refrigerator. 
In-use Pen 
•  Store the Pen you are currently using at room temperature (below 30°C) and away from dust, food 
and liquids,  heat and light. 
•  Throw away the Pen you are using after the time specified in the package leaflet, even if it still has 
insulin left in it. 
General information about the safe and effective use of your Pen 
•  Keep your Pen and needles out of the sight and reach of children. 
•  Do not use your Pen if any part looks broken or damaged. 
•  Always carry an extra Pen in case yours is lost or damaged.

Troubleshooting 
• 
If you cannot remove the Pen cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap 
straight off. 
• 
If the dose knob is hard to push: 
–  Pushing the dose knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. 
–  Your needle may be blocked. Put on a new needle and prime the Pen. 
–  You may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new Pen. You 
may need to get a prescription from your healthcare professional.

1. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1.1. 
Introduction 
Revatio  (sildenafil)  20  mg  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial 
hypertension classified as WHO functional class III, to improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been 
shown  in  primary  pulmonary  hypertension  and  pulmonary  hypertension  associated  with  connective 
tissue disease. 
Sildenafil  is  an  orally-active,  potent  and  selective  inhibitor  of  the  enzyme  phosphodiesterase  5 
(PDE5),  that  causes  the  breakdown  of  cyclic  guanosine  monophosphate  (cGMP).  Given  the  high 
levels of PDE5 in the pulmonary endothelium, and the role of the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP system in 
modulating  pulmonary  vascular  tone,  sildenafil  has  been  studied  in  PAH.  In  patients  with  PAH, 
inhibition  of  PDE5  could  lead  to  selective  (NO/cGMP-dependent)  vasodilatation  of  the  pulmonary 
vascular bed (with a lesser degree of vasodilatation in the systemic circulation), resulting in reduced 
pulmonary arterial pressure and symptomatic improvement. 
This Type II variation has been submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to broaden 
the  existing  therapeutic  indication  to  include  treatment  of  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial 
hypertension classified as WHO functional class II. 
The  proposed  indication  is  as  follows:  “Treatment  of  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension 
classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been shown 
in  primary  pulmonary  hypertension  and  pulmonary  hypertension  associated  with  connective  tissue 
disease.”  
Additional data is also proposed in section 5.1  
1.2  Clinical aspects 
Pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH)  is  a  disease  of  the  small  pulmonary  arteries  that  is 
characterized  by  vascular  proliferation  and  remodelling.  It  results  in  a  progressive  increase  in 
pulmonary  arterial  resistance  and,  ultimately,  right  ventricular  failure  and  death.  The  functional 
classification (FC) of PAH, modified from the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of 
patients with cardiac disease, is as follows: 
•  Class  I:  PAH  without  a  resulting  limitation  of  physical  activity.  Ordinary  physical  activity 
does not cause undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near-syncope. 
•  Class II: PAH resulting in a slight limitation of physical activity. The patient is comfortable at 
rest,  but  ordinary  physical  activity  causes  undue  dyspnoea  or  fatigue,  chest  pain,  or  near 
syncope. 
•  Class III: PAH resulting a marked limitation of physical activity. The patient is comfortable at 
rest,  but  less  than  ordinary  activity  causes  undue  dyspnoea  or  fatigue,  chest  pain,  or  near 
syncope. 
•  Class IV: PAH resulting in an inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. 
The patient has signs of right heart failure. Dyspnoea, fatigue, or both may be present even at 
rest, and discomfort is increased by any physical activity. 
In many patients the course of PAH is one of steady deterioration and reduced life expectancy, with 
lung or heart and lung transplant being the only curative treatment available (De Backer et al, 2002). 
D’Alonzo et al (1991) reported the median survival time for untreated functional class I and class II 
patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension as 58.6 months, while untreated functional class III 
and class IV patients had median survival times of 31.5 months and 6 months, respectively. 
It has been shown that patients who improve from functional class III or class IV to functional class II 
after treatment have significantly improved survival. Therefore, it might be reasonable to expect that 
early  treatment  of  WHO  functional  class  II  patients  might  provide  an  improvement  in  survival  as 
progression to functional class III might be delayed. Furthermore, early treatment of functional class II 
patients is supported by the finding that not all patients respond to treatment and if treatment initiation 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is delayed until the patient progresses to functional class III or IV, a significant proportion will remain 
in functional class III or class IV. 
In 2005, Revatio was evaluated and approved for the indication of PAH in WHO FC III patients only. 
At that time the 6 minute walk distance (6MWT) for functional class II patients was considered to be 
approximately 450 metres based on results of a study conducted by Miyamoto et al (2000). 
Humbert  et  al.  published  results  from  the  French  National  PAH  Registry  in  2006.  The  Registry 
included  a  substantial  number  of  PAH  patients  (n=674)  from  17  French  University  hospitals  and 
included all consecutive adult (≥18 years) patients with PAH seen between October 2002 and October 
2003. The results from the French National PAH Registry indicated that the 6 minute walk test results 
correlated with functional class in all forms of PAH and haemodynamic improvement correlated with 
functional class and 6MWT in all subgroups of patients. 
Based  on  this  article,  the  MAH  would  like  to  show  that  the  original  studies  of  Revatio  provide 
evidence that this medication can be used in WHO FC II as well. 
Until  recently,  no  therapeutic  options  were  available  in  Europe  for  WHO/NYHA  functional  class  II 
patients. In 2008, ambrisentan (Volibris) was approved as an NCE for both functional class II and III 
patients,  and  bosentan  (Tracleer)  had  its  functional  class  III  label  extended  to  include  benefit  in 
functional  class  II  patients.  The  basis  to  include  WHO  functional  class  II  patients  were  on  two 
grounds: 
1.  The  functional  class  II  subjects  recruited  into  the  trials  were  a  demonstrably  different 
population from the functional class III subjects; 
2.  Efficacy was demonstrated for both functional class II and class III subjects. 
1.2.1  Clinical efficacy 
No  new  clinical  research  studies  were  included  to  support  this  Type  II  variation.  The  MAH  re-
evaluated data from two previously submitted studies: A1481140 and A1481142. The MAH believes 
that WHO FC II patients have been adequately studied in these studies. 
The MAH refers to ambrisentan (Volibris), a selective endothelin receptor antagonist, which recently 
was  approved  for  the  indication  of  WHO  FC  II  patients.  The  MAH  is  convinced  that  the 
considerations of ambrisentan can now be similarly applied to the sildenafil data. 
1.2.1.1  Main studies 
This  Type  II  variation  is  based  on  two  studies  involving  sildenafil  (Revatio):  A1481140  and 
A1481142. Data of these studies are re-evaluated. 
•  Methods and baseline 
Study  A1481140  was  a  12-week  multinational,  multi-center,  randomised,  double-blind,  double-
dummy, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of oral 
sildenafil (20, 40, and 80 mg TID) for the treatment of PAH. The primary objective of the study was to 
assess the effect of sildenafil therapy on exercise capacity, as measured by the 6-Minute Walk test (6-
MWT), after 12 weeks of treatment in subjects with PAH. 
Study A1481142 was a multi-center, long-term extension study to assess the safety and toleration of 
subject optimised treatment regimens of oral sildenafil for PAH in subjects who have completed Study 
A1481140.  The  duration  of  Study  A1481142  was  until  the  last  enrolled  subject  in  Study  A1481142 
had  completed  3  years  of  treatment  in  Study  A1481142.  All  subjects  completing  Study  A1481140 
were  eligible  to  receive  active  therapy  in  Study  A1481142.  Subjects  were  blinded  to  their  Study 
A1481142  regimens  until  the  last  subject  entering  the  study  had  completed  12  weeks  of  treatment. 
This  allowed  collection  of  blinded  toleration  data  as  subjects  optimised  their  dose  (based  on 
tolerability) in the first 12 weeks of Study A1481142. Subjects were followed up in the clinic on a 6-
weekly basis for the first 12 weeks and 3-monthly thereafter. Primary Endpoints were 6-MWT, BORG

dyspnoea  score,  pulmonary  hypertension  criteria  for  functional  capacity  and  therapeutic  class,  QoL 
and assessment of yearly survival status using the PPH prognostic index.

The difference between the functional class II and functional class III baseline mean 6MWDs was 54 
m and the difference between the medians was 63 m. The difference between the functional class II 
and function class III baseline mean 6MWDs was statistically significant (p<0.001). 
−  Baseline 6-MWT by Cut-off Point 
Table 2 shows the 6-MWT baseline in functional class II and functional class III subjects characterised 
by using the cut-off point of 400 metres. In Study A1481140, 48% of functional class II and 20% of 
functional class III subjects had a baseline 6-MWT of >400 metres. 
The functional class II and functional class III subjects were clearly differentiated in Study A1481140 
and comparable with the functional class II and functional class III subjects reported in the Volibris 
EPAR.

The  baseline  6MWT  and  haemodynamic  parameters  observed  for  baseline  functional  class  II  and 
functional class III subjects in Study A1481140 were comparable to the results in the French National 
Registry. 
Concomitant medication: 
Analysis  of  patients  in  study  A1481140  based  on  their  background  medications  also  showed  a 
differentiation between patients classified as functional class II and III e.g. the use of diuretics, digoxin 
and oxygen were reported more frequently in patients classified as FC III than II as follows: 71.3% vs. 
52.3% and 23.1%% vs. 19.6% and 38.8% vs. 19.6% respectively. 
In  conclusion,  comparison  of  baseline  characteristics  demonstrate  that  functional  class  II  subjects 
recruited  into  Study  A1481140  were  clinically  distinguishable  from  functional  class  III  subjects 
recruited into Study A1481140, and had less severe PAH. The functional class II and functional class 
III subjects in Study A1481140 are also comparable to subjects in the French National Registry and 
the ambrisentan Studies with respect to baseline 6-MWT and haemodynamic parameters.

Comparison  of  the  sildenafil  20  mg  treatment  group  versus  placebo  demonstrated  a  statistically 
significant increase in 6-MWT for baseline functional class II and class III subjects at Week 12. The 
overall  treatment  comparison  of  all  sildenafil  treatment  groups  versus  placebo  demonstrated  a 
statistically  significant  increase  in  6-MWT  for  baseline  functional  class  II  and  functional  class  III 
subjects at Week 12. 
The change from baseline in 6-MWT for baseline functional class II and functional class III subjects 
treated with sildenafil are comparable with the results reported for ambrisentan subjects. 
−  6-MWT By cut off point 
The MAH also performed analyses of change from baseline in 6-MWT by Baseline 6-MWT with cut 
off 400m and 415m, respectively as stated in the ambrisentan EPAR. The results are provided 
in the tables below.

In  addition  to  the  original  parametric  analysis,  the  MAH  provided,  at  the  request  of  the  CHMP,  the 
changes for the different cut-off points used (≤400 m,>400 m and ≤415 m, >415 m) according to a non 
parametric approach (Hodges-Lehman, 95% CI for the median estimates by treatment group and the 
median difference and 95% CI in the continuous efficacy variables).

Table 8 - Treatment comparisons of change from baseline 6 minute walk distance at week 12 by baseline 6 
minute walk distance (≤415 m / >415 m). 
The MAH further characterised the efficacy data for baseline functional class II and functional class 
III subjects by defining a responder as either: 
•  A subject whose 6MWD improves by 30 m at Week 12. 
•  A subject whose 6-MWT improves by 30 m and by 10% over the baseline distance at 
Week 12. 
If the first definition of responder is used, 60% of functional class II subjects and 56% of functional 
class  III  subjects  were  responders.  If  the  second  definition  of  responder  is  used,  54%  of  functional 
class II subjects and 55% of functional class III subjects were responders. 
The  re-analysed  6-MWT  data  from  Study  A1481140  shows  the  efficacy  profile  for  sildenafil  is 
comparable  for  baseline  functional  class  II  and  functional  III  subjects  in  Study  A1481140,  with 
statistically  significant  improvements  in  6-MWT  observed  in  both  groups  of  subjects.  Furthermore, 
comparable  improvements  in  6-MWT  were  observed  when  baseline  6-MWT  rather  than  baseline 
functional class was used to define disease severity at baseline in Study A1481140. 
−  Secondary endpoints 
Further  to  the  request  from  the  CHMP,  the  MAH  provided  results  of  the  investigated  secondary 
endpoints  in  study  A1481140  (changes  in  mean  PAP,  time  to  clinical  worsening  and  change  from 
baseline in BORG Dyspnoea score) for FCII. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment  comparisons  of  change  from  baseline  in  mean  PAP  at  week  12  (LOCF)  by  baseline 
functional class are given below. 
The numbers (%) of patients with clinical worsening events, especially from functional class II, were 
too small for meaningful evaluation: 
The median baseline BORG Dyspnoea scores in the WHO FC II population were 2, 3, 3, 2 for placebo, 
sildenafil  20mg,  sildenafil  40mg  and  sildenafil  80mg  respectively,  compared  to  4,  4,  3  and  4 
respectively in the WHO FC III population. Given that there was little scope for improvement with the 
WHO FC II population (a score of 2 corresponds to ‘slight breathlessness’) it isn’t unexpected that the 
sildenafil groups show no improvement over placebo below. 
Study A1481142 
The  primary  objective  of  extension  Study  A1481142  was  to  assess  safety.  However,  it  did  provide 
supportive efficacy data. Change in 6-MWT, survival data, and long term functional class data from 
Study  A1481142  are  discussed  in  this  section.  It  should  be  noted  that  care  needs  to  be  taken  when 
interpreting data from Study A1481142 because of potential bias from the lack of a control group and 
open label study design. 
Overall,  the  change  in  6-MWT,  survival  data,  and  functional  class  data  from  extension  study 
A1481142 support the long-term efficacy of sildenafil in functional class II subjects.

−  6-Minute Walk Distance 
At Week 12 in Study A1481142 the mean change from Study A1481140 baseline in 6-MWT was 39 
m  and  34  m  for  baseline  (Study  A1481140)  functional  class  II  and  functional  class  III  subjects, 
respectively, where baseline is defined as the pre-randomisation value in Study A1481140. The mean 
changes in 6-MWT were 50 m and 45 m at 36 months for baseline functional class II and functional 
class III subjects, respectively. At 36 months 71 of the 96 baseline (Study A1481140) functional class 
II subjects entered into Study A1481142 remained in study. As already discussed, caution is needed in 
interpreting  the  data  from  open  label  study  A1481142.  However,  these  results  suggest  that 
improvements in 6-MWT are maintained in less severe functional class II subjects after 36 months of 
sildenafil treatment.

Long-term functional class data were also collected in Study A1481142. The majority of subjects who 
were  baseline  functional  class  II  (62%)  or  functional  class  III  (59%)  improved  or  maintained  their 
functional class after 3 years of sildenafil treatment. 
1.2.1.2  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
No new clinical studies were submitted to support the current application. The MAH re-evaluated data 
from the study A1481140 and its long term extension study A1481142 which were the pivotal studies 
submitted  in  the  Revatio  application  and  resulted  in  the  registration  of  Revatio  for  WHO  FC  III. 
Ambrisentan,  an  endothelin  receptor  antagonist,  is  currently  registered  for  PAH  FC  II  based  on  the 
results  of  studies  ARIES-1/ARIES-2.  The  ARIES  studies  were  12  week  double-blind  placebo-
controlled  multi-center  studies  in  394  PAH  patients  (both  FC  II  and  III)  with  6-MWT  as  primary 
endpoint.  
With the publishing of the French Registry of PAH patients (Humbert et al., 2006) based on data from 
674  patients,  lower  6-MWT  values  were  assigned  for  FC  II  than  those  previously  reported  in  the 
article  by  Miyamoto  et  al.,  2000:  415m  vs.  450  m  respectively.  The  values  reported  in  the  French 
Registry are currently the accepted ones. 
Adequate number of patients in FC II were recruited in the pivotal study A1481140 (n=103, compared 
to  n=158  in  FC  III).  The  reported  baseline  6-MWT  for  FC  II  in  the  pivotal  study  A1481140  (mean 
379±60m) still appears lower than those reported in the French Registry (mean 415±86m); however, 
they are comparable to those reported in the ARIES studies (Table 1).  
The submitted data supports that recruited PAH patients in study A1481140 had statistically different 
haemodynamic  values  for  WHO  FC  II  and  III.  The haemodynamic  parameters  for  FC  II  and  FC  III 
appear comparable to those reported in the French Registry. 
It can be agreed with the MAH that the submitted data show that at baseline the recruited WHO FC II 
patients  in  study  A1481140  were  distinguishable  from  WHO  FC  III  based  on  their  6-MWT  and 
haemodynamic  data.  This  is  also  supported  by  lesser  administration  of  background  supportive 
medications e.g. diuretics, digoxin and oxygen. These WHO FC II patients appear comparable to those 
described in the French Registry and those recruited in the ARIES studies. The MAH established that 
the  baseline  characteristics  in  the  subgroups  of  grade  II  functional  status  was  balanced  between  the 
placebo and sildenafil groups.  
Administration of the registered dose of sildenafil 20 mg t.i.d resulted in a significant increase in 6-
MWT in FC II of 49.2 m (95% CI: 21.5- 76.97) which is comparable to the increase achieved in FC III 
(45.4 m 95% CI: 15.56-75.26).  
The MAH has also analysed the change from baseline in 6MWD using different cut-off points (≤400 
m,  >400  m,  ≤415  m  and  >415  m).  In  general,  the  changes  observed  for  all  cut-off  points  were 
clinically relevant for all dosages although the effect size was lower for the less severe patients (who 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
walked >400 and >415 m) and who took the lower dose (20 mg), for whom the change from baseline 
was around 25 m (24.1 and 28.6m respectively). The MAH argued that the less size effect observed 
with  20  mg  dose  in  these  subgroups  could  be  the  result  of  the  variability  in  the  data  and  a  chance 
consequence.  The  MAH’s  response  appears  reasonable  given  that  a  number  of  non-pre-specified 
analyses have been performed and consistency is observed for most of them.  
In order to assess the robustness of the previous parametric analyses, the MAH provided the changes 
for  these  different  cut-off  (<400  m  /  >400  m  and  <415  m  /  >415  m)  according  to  a  numerical  and 
graphical non parametric approach (Hodges-Lehman, 95% CI for the median estimates by treatment 
group  and  the  median  difference  and  95%  CI  in  the  continuous  efficacy  variables).  The  additional 
analyses using non-parametric methods were consistent with the previous parametric analyses.  
Results  of  the  secondary  endpoints  (PAP,  clinical  worsening  events  and  BORG  dyspnoea)  in  FC  II 
were  submitted  at  the  request  of  the  CHMP.  After  administration  of  sildenafil  20  mg,  a  trend  for  a 
reduction in PAP: -3.2 mmHg is noticed. Only with higher doses of sildenafil 80 mg or for the whole 
sildenafil group, significant reductions are shown. These results are in line with those shown for FC 
III.  It  is  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  small  number  of  clinical  worsening  events  preclude  any 
conclusions.  Similarly,  BORG  dyspnoea  scores  did  not  show  differences  following  treatment  as 
patients were only suffering from slight breathlessness at baseline and not much improvement would 
have been expected. In conclusion, sildenafil 20 mg may have a pressure lowering effect on PAP, in 
FC II. As with other haemodynamic parameter, the clinical relevance of such effects is not clear.  
The principal disease aetiology of patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (n=100) was PAH-
CTD (class II- N: 32; class III- N: 51). The number of patients in the PAH-CTD group (class II) is 
limited and it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions. However, the magnitude of the observed effect 
(63  m)  is  consistent  with  that  seen  for  the  PAH-PPH  group,  class  II  and  III  (52  m  and  29  m, 
respectively), though not statistically significant.  
Overall,  the  post  hoc  analysis  can  be  regarded  as  globally  acceptable  since  it  may  facilitate  the 
comparison with other marketed products.  
As  stated  by  the  MAH,  results  of  the  long  term  extension  study  should  be  reviewed  cautiously 
considering  the  open  label  non-controlled  design.  Generally,  the  reported  results  are  reassuring 
regarding maintenance of efficacy (50 m and 45 m at 36 months for baseline functional class II and 
functional class III subjects, respectively).  
1.2.2  Clinical safety 
1.2.2.1  Main studies 
The safety profile, based solely on safety tables, was generally similar for baseline functional class II 
subjects  and  baseline  function  class  III  subjects  in  Study  A1481140.  As  would  be  expected,  more 
severe AEs, SAEs, and deaths were reported in baseline functional class III subjects with more severe 
PAH. 
In  Study  A1481142  sildenafil  was  generally  well  tolerated.  The  AEs  reported  were  consistent  with 
known side effects of sildenafil. The most frequently reported treatment related AEs were headache, 
dyspepsia, diarrhoea and blurred vision. Most AEs (all causality and treatment related) were mild or 
moderate in severity. 
Survival at 1, 2, and 3 Years (presented under Safety)  
One year survival data from Study A1481142 were provided in the original Revatio submission. Since 
the original submission in 2005, the long-term survival data after 3 years of sildenafil treatment has 
become available.  
The  1,  2  and  3  year  survival  data  from  Study  A1481142  were  analysed  for  subjects  randomised  to 
sildenafil  in  Study  A1481140  and  for  baseline  functional  class  II  and  functional  class  III  subjects 
randomised  to  sildenafil  in  Study  A1481140.  The  Kaplan  Meier  survival  estimates  for  subjects 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
randomised  to  sildenafil  in  Study  A1481140  were  96%,  91%,  and  82%  at  1,  2,  and  3  years, 
respectively.  Kaplan  Meier  survival  estimates  at  1,  2,  and  3  years  for  baseline  functional  class  II 
subjects  were  99%,  91%,  and  84%,  respectively,  and  for  baseline  functional  class  III  subjects  were 
94%, 90%, and 81%, respectively. 
These data suggest that sildenafil treatment improves survival and, as would be expected, functional 
class  II  subjects  treated  with  sildenafil  have  a  better  prognosis  than  functional  class  III  subjects. 
Survival data for sildenafil are comparable with the results presented for ambrisentan. 
Safety data in patients with FC II and III, administered the registered dose of 20 mg t.i.d. 
−  Adverse Events 
Table 9 summarises treatment-emergent, all causality adverse events (AEs) by baseline FC in Study 
A1481140 for the 20 mg treatment group.  Overall the proportion of subjects with all causality AEs 
and SAEs were similar for baseline FC II and baseline FC III subjects in the 20 mg treatment group of 
Study  A1481140.  Few  subjects  had  dose  reductions,  temporary  discontinuations,  or  permanently 
discontinued due to AEs in either group. A higher proportion of severe AEs were reported for baseline 
FC III subjects. 
Table 9 - Summary of Treatment-Emergent, All-Causality AEs by Baseline Functional Class - Study 
A1481140, Sildenafil 20 mg Treatment Group 
−  Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) 
The proportion of subjects with TRAEs and SAEs were similar for baseline FC II and baseline FC III 
subjects  in  the  20  mg  treatment  group  of  Study  A1481140.  Few  subjects  had  dose  reductions  or 
temporary  discontinuations,  and  no  subjects  permanently  discontinued  due  to  AEs  in  either  group. 
Two subjects experienced severe AEs in the baseline functional class III group, compared with none in 
the baseline functional class II group.

Table 11 - The most frequently reported TRAEs in FC II compared to their frequency in FC III. 
According to the MAH, these data are difficult to interpret because of the relatively small number of 
baseline functional class II (24) and baseline functional class III (40) subjects in the 20 mg treatment 
group of Study A1481140. 
−  Permanent Discontinuations 
One  FC  II  patient  in  the  20  mg  treatment  group  permanently  discontinued  treatment  because  of 
decreased  creatinine  clearance  on  day  1  of  the  study.  The  causality  was  given  as  concomitant 
treatment furosemide. The subject discontinued from the study and only took study drug on Day 1. 
−  Deaths 
No  deaths  were  reported  with  FC  II;  2  deaths  were  reported  in  FC  III,  none  considered  related  to 
sildenafil. 
−  Serious Adverse Events 
Three serious adverse events were reported in FC II administered sildenafil 20 mg table 5, whereas 7 
SAEs were reported in FC III. 
Table 12 - Summary of SAEs reported in Baseline Functional Class II Patients – Study A1481140, 
Sildenafil 20 mg Treatment Group 
In these three patients, 6 SAEs were reported; all except one were assessed as not related to sildenafil 
and did not lead to permanent study discontinuation.  
In  one  SAE:  left  ventricular  dysfunction  was  assessed  as  related  to  sildenafil  and  ended  with 
permanent discontinuation of sildenafil. The haemodynamic measurements were as follows: 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The investigator attributed the left ventricular dysfunction to sildenafil. In the opinion of the sponsor, 
the  event,  most  likely  represented  a  complication  of  disease  under  study;  however,  the  contributory 
effect of sildenafil, a pulmonary vasodilator, in unmasking the underlying left ventricular dysfunction 
cannot be excluded. 
1.2.2.2  Post-Marketing Safety Data 
According to International Marketing Service (IMS) estimates, approximately 33,883 patient-years of 
exposure  to  sildenafil  (PAH)  occurred  during  the  period  second  quarter  of  2005  through  the  first 
quarter of 2008. 
A total of 47 sildenafil (PAH) cases (containing 75 events) were identified for the period 01 June 2008 
through 31 August 2008. Eleven of these 47 cases involved death in patients treated with sildenafil for 
PAH.  In  7  cases,  assessment  of  the  cause  of  death  was  not  possible  because  insufficient  data  were 
provided.  In  the  remaining  four  cases,  the  reported  events  and  the  fatal  outcome  most  likely 
represented complications of patients’ underlying diseases or intercurrent illnesses. 
In  addition,  review  of  cases  involving  hemorrhagic  events,  ocular  events,  nervous  system  disorders, 
skin  and  subcutaneous  events,  cardiovascular  events,  or  hearing  impairment  were  performed.  The 
risk/benefit balance for sildenafil (PAH) remained unchanged upon review of these events. 
1.2.2.3  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  reported  K-M  survival  estimates  at  1,  2,  and 3  years  for  baseline  functional  class  II  subjects  of 
99%, 91%, and 84% are slightly lower than those reported with ambrisentan of 94% for 2 and 3 years, 
but no conclusion can be drawn.  
The  MAH  was  requested  to  submit  safety  data  in  patients  with  FC  II  and  III,  administered  the 
registered dose of 20 mg t.i.d, in order to establish the safety profile of sildenafil in its registered dose 
of 20 mg tid in patients with FC II.  
The number of patients recruited in FC II administered sildenafil 20 mg in study A1481140 was 24, 
precluding  any  robust  conclusions.  Generally  it  can  be  observed  that  the  frequencies  of  treatment 
related AEs such as headache, dizziness and abdominal pain NOS were higher in FC II (41.7%, 16.7% 
and  12.5%  respectively)  compared  to  either  FCIII  (30%,  0,  and  0  respectively,  or  the  matching 
placebo  (21.9%,  6.3%  and  3.1%  respectively).  The  MAH  did  not  comment  on  these  unexpected 
findings.  No  deaths  were  reported.  The  single  case  of  discontinuation  in  FC  II  was  not  considered 
related to sildenafil. In one single event of SAE (left ventricular dysfunction) the investigator related 
the event to sildenafil.  
In conclusion, the safety profile of sildenafil 20 mg in patients with FC II is limited. In future PSURs, 
AEs should be separately reported per FC. 
With respect to post-marketing data, the MAH provided the narratives and the medical review for two 
cases  in  which  the  contribution  of  sildenafil  to  the  fatal  outcome  cannot  be  ruled  out  due  to  direct 
causality, concomitant therapy (other PAH treatment) or due to the natural progression of PAH. The 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MAH committed to including these cases in the  seventh Revatio PSUR and updating any follow-up 
information received.  
1.3  Orphan Medicinal Products 
Sildenafil  was  granted  an  orphan  designation  (EU/3/03/178)  by  the  European  Commission  on  12 
December  2003  for  the  treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  and  chronic  thromboembolic 
pulmonary hypertension.  
Due  to  the  overlap  of  the  extension  of  indication  in  PAH  WHO  functional  class  II  proposed  by  the 
MAH of Revatio with that approved for Volibris (ambrisentan) and Tracleer (bosentan), the MAH was 
requested  to  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with  this  authorised  orphan 
medicinal product. 
Having  considered  the  arguments  presented  by  the  MAH  of  Revatio  on  10  December  2008,  it  is 
concluded  that  sildenafil  does  not  share  the  same  principal  molecular  structural  features  as 
ambrisentan and bosentan and the differences in molecular structure are not only minor. Sildenafil is 
regarded as structurally not similar to ambrisentan and bosentan. As defined in Art. 3 of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 847/2000), Revatio is considered as non-similar to Volibris and Tracleer. 
Therefore, with reference to article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, the existence of any market 
exclusivity for Volibris and Tracleer in PAH including WHO functional class II, does not prevent the 
granting  of  the  extension  of  indication  of  Revatio  in  PAH  WHO  functional  class  II  which  can  be 
considered  as  significantly  overlapping  with  the  indication  approved  for  Volibris  and  Tracleer  (see 
Attachment 5). 
1.4  Benefit/Risk Assessment 
PAH is a rare and devastating disease. Owing to the difficulties associated with the diagnosis, many 
patients will have progressed to WHO functional class (FC) III or even IV before treatment is offered. 
Nevertheless, about 25% of PAH patients seen in the clinic are classed as WHO FC II or less at the 
time of diagnosis. Recently, it has been recognized that PAH patients in WHO FC II may benefit from 
specialized PAH therapy. Ambrisentan and bosentan have been recently approved for this indication 
(ref. EPAR) 
The  MAH  did  not  submit  new  clinical  data.  Clinical  data  from  previously  submitted  studies  are  re-
evaluated. Based on data of the French registry re-defining PAH patients FC II, it could be seen that 
the pivotal study A1481140 recruited an adequate number of FC II patients, who are distinguishable 
from  FC  III.  Haemodynamic  analysis  also  supported  such  a  distinction.  The  enrolled  patients  were 
PAH-treatment  naïve,  but  the  administered  background  medications  further  supports  a  distinction  in 
their  FC.  The  recruited  patients  appear  comparable  to  those  recruited  in  the  Ambrisentan  studies. 
Administration of sildenafil 20 mg t.i.d in WHO FC II patients resulted in significant improvement in 
the 6-minute walk test 6-MWT, comparable to that shown in the whole studied population or FC III. 
The  results  are  also  comparable  to  those  reported  with  Ambrisentan  (Ambrisentan  EPAR).  A 
requested non-parametric analysis of the 6-MWT further supported the already presented parametric 
analysis.  Of  the  investigated  secondary  endpoints,  only  a  trend  for  pressure  lowering  in  PAP  was 
noticed with the 20 mg t.i.d sildenafil. The number of recruited patients in the PAH-CTD group (class 
II) is limited precluding any firm conclusions. However, the magnitude of the observed effect is in line 
with the general results, though not statistically significant.  
No safety issues were identified with long term use of sildenafil in PAH patients FC WHO II, but the 
specific  database  for  the  20  mg  t.i.d  sildenafil  in  FC  II  is  limited.  In  future  PSURs,  AEs  should  be 
reported separately per FC.  
In  conclusion,  the  benefit  risk  assessment  for  sildenafil  is  considered  positive  for  the  proposed 
extension  of  indication.  Consequently,  the  CHMP  agreed  for  sections  4.1  and  5.1  of  the  SPC  to  be 
updated accordingly.

2. 
CONCLUSION 
On  29  May  2009,  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Summary of Risk Management Plan for TREMFYA® (guselkumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for TREMFYA. The RMP details important 
risks of TREMFYA, and how more information will be obtained about  TREMFYA’s risks and 
uncertainties (missing information). 
TREMFYA’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how TREMFYA should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for TREMFYA should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of TREMFYA’s 
RMP. 
I. 
The Medicine and What it is Used For 
TREMFYA is authorized for use in adults for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
and active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (see SmPC for the full indications). It contains guselkumab as 
the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection.  
Further information about the evaluation of TREMFYA’s benefits can be found in TREMFYA’s 
EPAR,  including  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  European  Medicines  Agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage:

II. 
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks 
Important risks of TREMFYA, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
clinical trials for learning more about TREMFYA’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the  Package 
Leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
The  authorized  pack  size  —  the  amount  of  medicine  in  a  pack  is  chosen  so  to  ensure  that  the 
medicine is used correctly 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.  
Information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regularly  analyzed, including 
Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of TREMFYA is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks  of TREMFYA  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of TREMFYA. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B. 
Summary of Important Risks 
Important Potential Risk: Serious Infection  
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Nonclinical  data  in  mice  suggest  that  blockade  of  interleukin  (IL)-23  may 
predispose patients to infection.  
Although serious infections were reported in patients  treated with guselkumab in 
clinical  trials  and  in  the  postmarketing  setting,  available  cumulative  information 
does  not  suggest  an  increased  risk  of  serious  infection  in  patients  treated  with 
guselkumab. 
Risk factors and risk groups  Risk factors for the development of serious infection include clinically significant 
metabolic  and  endocrine  disorders  such  as  diabetes,  obesity,  thyroid  disorders, 
cardiovascular (CV) disorders, and renal and hepatic disorders; advanced age; and 
the concomitant use of corticosteroids, other biologics (including tumor necrosis 
factor [TNF]α inhibitors), and other immunosuppressants.  
TB 
The most common risk factors for the development of tuberculosis (TB) include 
that  weaken  the  immune  system  (eg,  advanced  age,  human 
conditions 
Important Potential Risk: Serious Infection  
immunodeficiency  virus 
infection),  alcohol  abuse,  malignancy, 
corticosteroids  or  other  immunosuppressive  drugs  such  as  methotrexate  (MTX), 
connective tissue disease, renal failure, diabetes, and pregnancy.  
[HIV] 
Exposure to TB is also a risk factor for the development of TB and patients who 
were  born  or  lived in countries considered by the World  Health  Organization  to 
have a high TB burden (incidence: >300 TB cases/100,000 population/year) or who 
have travelled to these locations may be at higher risk. Exposure in the health care 
setting or in high-density institutions (ie, prisons) may also put patients at higher 
risk  of  development  of  TB.  The  possibility  of  latent  TB  must  be  considered, 
especially in patients who have immigrated from or travelled to countries with a 
high prevalence of TB or who had close contact with a person with active TB. In 
patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised, tuberculin tests may yield 
false negative results.

Important Potential Risk: Malignancy  
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
No increased risk for malignancy was observed following the conduct of a 5-week 
intravenous  (subchronic)  and  a  24-week  SC  (chronic)  study  with  a  3-month 
recovery  of  guselkumab  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  conducted  by  the  Marketing 
Authorization  Holder  (MAH).  Although  there  are  no  validated  models  for 
carcinogenicity evaluations in cynomolgus monkeys, neoplasia has been observed 
in  this  species  following  repeated  administration  of  other  immunosuppressive 
drugs indicated in the treatment of psoriasis. Most data in the published literature 
pertaining to models of IL-23 ablation suggest that blockade of IL-23 may actually 
reduce  the  risk  of  carcinogenesis.  A  limited  number  of  studies  in  the  literature 
present  conflicting  data  supporting  an  increased  risk  of  malignancy  in  mice 
deficient for IL-23 and p19 exposed to ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation. 
Although malignancies have been reported in patients treated with guselkumab in 
clinical trials  and  in the  postmarketing  setting,  available cumulative  information 
does  not  suggest  an  increased  risk  of  malignancy  in  patients  treated  with 
guselkumab. 
 
Important Potential Risk: Malignancy  
Risk factors and risk groups  Among psoriasis patients, an increased risk of solid cancers appears to be related 
to  alcohol  use  and  cigarette  smoking.  In  addition,  exposure  to  psoralen  + 
ultraviolet-A  (PUVA)  radiation  and  immunosuppressants  (including  cyclosporin 
and possibly MTX) has been associated with squamous cell carcinoma in psoriasis 
patients.  General  risk  factors  for  malignancy  include  increasing  age,  lifestyle 
factors (such as alcohol and tobacco use and obesity), family history of cancer, and 
certain environmental exposures.

Important Potential Risk: Serum Sickness 
Evidence for linking the risk

Although  an  infrequent  occurrence,  serum  sickness  has  been  reported  in  the 
published literature in association with the use of other mAb therapies.

Important Potential Risk: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE)  
Evidence  for linking the  risk 
to the medicine 
Evidence for an increased background risk of CV disease (ie, heart attack, stroke, 
and death related to heart attack and stroke) in patients with psoriasis  (including 
PsA) is cited in the published literature. 
Although  MACE  were  reported  in  patients  treated  with  guselkumab  in  clinical 
trials and in the postmarketing setting, available cumulative information does not 
suggest an increased risk of MACE in patients treated with guselkumab. 
 
 
 
Important Potential Risk: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE)  
Risk factors and risk groups 
The  risk  factors for  the  development  of  CV disease are  well known and  include 
hypertension,  hypercholesterolemia,  diabetes,  smoking, advanced age,  male  sex, 
obesity,  and  family  history.  Patients  with  psoriasis  have  been  shown  to  be  at 
increased  risk  for  CV  events  (ie,  MACE,  defined  as  CV  death,  nonfatal  MI,  or 
nonfatal  stroke)  compared  with  the  general  population.  Literature  suggests 
psoriasis may be an independent risk factor due to the high inflammatory burden 
of  psoriatic  disease.  Additionally,  at  least  some  CV  risk  factors  occur  more 
frequently  in  the  psoriasis  population  compared  with  the  general  population. 
Specifically,  these  CV  risk  factors  include  pre-existing  MACE  conditions; 
uncontrolled  or  poorly  controlled  concomitant  diseases  such  as  diabetes, 
hypertension,  hyperlipidemia,  and  obesity;  and  patient  characteristics  such  as 
smoking. Of these, the association between psoriasis and dyslipidemia is less clear, 
with  some  studies  showing  that  patients  with  psoriasis  have  significant 
dyslipidemia while others do not show a correlation.  
Notably,  patients  with  severe  psoriasis  are  more  likely  to  demonstrate  CV  risk 
factors such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension compared with those with no or 
mild psoriasis.

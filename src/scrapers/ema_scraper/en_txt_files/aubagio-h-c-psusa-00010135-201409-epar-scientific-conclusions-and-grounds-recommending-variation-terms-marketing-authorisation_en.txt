Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for TERIFLUNOMIDE, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
During the reporting period of this PSUR, there have been two cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and 
two cases reported with skin exfoliation, seven cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and 27 cases 
reporting skin exfoliation cumulatively. Therefore, the PRAC considered that the information in the 
section 4.4 of the SmPC on the lack of severe skin reactions from clinical trials should be amended as 
it does not reflect the current safety profile of this medicinal product. In addition, section 4.8 of the 
SmPC should be updated to include information on the fact that cases of severe skins reactions have 
been reported with teriflunomide post-marketing. The PL should be updated accordingly. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding severe skin reactions, the PRAC considered that changes 
to the product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for TERIFLUNOMIDE the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing TERIFLUNOMIDE is favourable subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

Scientific conclusions and detailed explanation of the scientific grounds for 
the differences from the PRAC recommendation  
1 – Overall summary of the scientific evaluation by PRAC 
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and fluid 
balance. RAS-acting agents act by blocking different stages of the renin-angiotensin system, lowering 
blood pressure and their use in the treatment of hypertension and its complications (including acute 
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease) is recommended in many 
current clinical guidelines. RAS-acting agents include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-
inhibitors) such as benazepril, captopril, cilazapril, delapril, enalapril, fosinopril, imidapril, lisinopril, 
moexipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, spirapril, trandolapril and zofenopril), angiotensin receptor 
blockers (ARBs) such as candesartan, telmisartan, valsartan, irbesartan, eprosartan, olmesartan, 
losartan and azilsartan and direct renin inhibitors such as aliskiren. 
The concept of dual RAS blockade through the combined use of several RAS-acting agents, emerged in 
the late 1990’s based on an experimental model hypothesising that the combined use of an ARB, an 
ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren could provide a more complete blockade of the RAS which could translate 
into better control of blood pressure and nephroprotective and cardioprotective effects. However, new 
data has emerged in the past years, raising doubts over the efficacy and identifying safety concerns 
associated with dual RAS blockade therapy through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, ARBs or 
aliskiren. In particular, the publication of a meta-analysis by Makani et al 1 involving over 68,000 
patients raised concerns that combining several RAS-acting agents may be associated with an 
increased risk of hyperkalaemia, hypotension and kidney failure, compared with the single use of one 
RAS-acting agent. In addition, the meta-analysis suggested that using multiple RAS-acting agents 
may not be more beneficial than using a single RAS-acting agent in terms of reducing overall 
mortality. It was noted that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had already 
conducted a review2 under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for aliskiren-containing 
products, concluding that these products should be contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus 
or moderate to severe renal impairment who take ACE-inhibitors or ARBs.  
Having considered the new available evidence from the scientific literature and given the seriousness 
of the identified safety concerns, the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) decided to initiate a review 
under Article 31 of Council Directive 2001/83/EC on 17 April 2013, referring the matter to the 
Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) and requesting the PRAC to issue a 
recommendation on the benefit-risk of dual RAS blockade therapy through the combined use of ACE-
inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren and whether any regulatory measures should be taken on the marketing 
authorisations of the products involved in this procedure. 
The PRAC reviewed the totality of the available data, including clinical trials, meta-analysis and 
publications, the MAHs’ responses as well as the report from the Scientific Advisory Group in 
Cardiovascular Issues (SAG CVS). The PRAC was of the opinion that there is considerable evidence 
from large clinical trials and meta-analyses which conclusively demonstrates that dual RAS blockade 
therapy through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is associated with an increased 
risk of adverse events, including hypotension, hyperkalaemia and renal failure compared to 
monotherapy, in particular in patients with diabetic nephropathy. This is of particular concern, as

these patients and patients with renal impaired are already particularly prone to developing 
hyperkalaemia. 
The PRAC considered that the available efficacy data indicates that dual RAS blockade therapy does 
not provide significant benefit in the general patient population, although there is evidence to suggest 
that some selected patient subpopulations may benefit from this dual RAS blockade therapy. In 
particular, a number of trials in heart failure patients have shown that the addition of a second RAS-
acting agent may reduce hospital admissions for heart failure in patients with heart failure, which is 
considered a meaningful clinical endpoint. The PRAC therefore concluded that dual RAS blockade 
therapy should not be routinely used in the treatment of heart failure and is not recommended in the 
general population although it may benefit certain patients who remain symptomatic while receiving 
monotherapy or who cannot otherwise use alternative therapies, including potentially patients with 
diabetic nephropathy. Treatment should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to 
frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. 
The PRAC considered that the overall available data strongly suggests that the concerns identified with 
regard to safety and the lack of efficacy are a class effect and therefore considered that the 
conclusions of the review apply to all the active substances involved in the procedure. 
The PRAC was of the opinion that the concerns identified during this procedure with regard to the 
safety and the lack of efficacy of dual RAS blockade therapy could be adequately managed through 
changes to the product information, without the need for additional risk minimisation measures. The 
PRAC therefore concluded that the product information of all RAS-acting agents should be revised to 
reflect the identified risks and provide guidance to prescribers and patients. A warning was introduced 
to state that dual RAS blockade therapy through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren 
is not recommended and, if considered absolutely necessary, should only occur under specialist 
supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. 
The PRAC however clearly specified, based on data from the ONTARGET3 and VA NEPHRON-D 4 studies 
that ACE-inhibitors and ARBs should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. 
The PRAC was also of the opinion that the contraindication based on the ALTITUDE5 study data 
regarding the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors or ARBs with aliskiren-containing products in patients 
with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) was 
confirmed by the additional data reviewed and that it should also be implemented in the product 
information of ARBs and ACE-inhibitors. For candesartan- and valsartan-containing products, which 
are also authorised in the treatment of heart failure, additional information was agreed upon to reflect 
the fact that dual RAS blockade therapy in combination with an ACE-inhibitor may be of benefit in 
certain patients who cannot use other heart failure treatments, provided that they are used under 
specialist supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood 
pressure.

Overall conclusion 
The PRAC concluded that the benefit-risk balance of RAS-acting agents remains favourable, including 
in the context of dual RAS blockade therapy, subject to the agreed revisions to the product 
information.

The PRAC considered the procedure under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC initiated by Italy 
following the emergence of new evidence on the efficacy and safety of dual RAS blockade therapy 
through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren, to 
determine whether any regulatory measures should be taken on the marketing authorisations of 
the products involved in this procedure; 
The PRAC reviewed the totality of the available data, including clinical trials, meta-analysis and 
publications, the MAHs’ responses as well as the report from the Scientific Advisory Group in 
Cardiovascular Issues; 
The PRAC was of the view that there is considerable evidence, in particular from the ONTARGET, 
ALTITUDE and VA NEPHRON-D trials which conclusively demonstrates that dual RAS blockade 
therapy through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is 
associated with an increased risk of adverse events, including hypotension, hyperkalaemia and 
renal failure compared to monotherapy; 
The PRAC considered that the available efficacy data indicates that dual RAS blockade therapy does 
not provide significant benefit in the general patient population although certain patient 
subpopulations may benefit from treatment, provided that it occurs only under specialist 
supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood 
pressure; 
The PRAC was of the opinion that the concerns identified with regard to safety and the lack of 
additional efficacy of dual RAS blockade therapy are a class effect and that the conclusions of the 
review therefore apply to all the active substances involved in this procedure; 
The PRAC was of the opinion that the concerns identified with regard to the safety and the lack of 
additional efficacy of dual RAS blockade therapy can be adequately managed through changes to 
the product information, without the need for additional risk minimisation measures. 
The PRAC, as a consequence, concluded that the benefit-risk balance of RAS-acting agents remains 
favourable, provided that their product information is revised to reflect the concerns associated with 
dual RAS blockade therapy. Having considered the matter, the PRAC therefore recommended the 
variation of the marketing authorisations for RAS-acting agents.

2 – Detailed explanation of the scientific grounds for differences from the PRAC 
recommendation 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agreed with the overall scientific conclusions 
and grounds for recommendation. However, the CHMP considered that minor additional changes were 
necessary to the wording proposed for the Summary of Product Characteristics. Changes were made 
to the heart failure indication in section 4.4 for candesartan-containing products and in sections 4.2 
and 4.4 for valsartan-containing products, in order to further harmonise the wording for the two 
substances. In addition, a number of typographical and QRD-related changes were made. In particular 
the contraindication statements recommended by the PRAC were deleted from sections 5.1 (where 
proposed) and from section 4.4 for aliskiren, as these were already proposed in section 4.3 and 
therefore considered redundant. Corresponding changes were made, where relevant, to the currently 
approved product information. 
CHMP opinion 
The CHMP, having considered the PRAC recommendation, agrees with the overall scientific conclusions 
by the PRAC and is of the opinion that the marketing authorisations for RAS-acting agents should be 
varied.

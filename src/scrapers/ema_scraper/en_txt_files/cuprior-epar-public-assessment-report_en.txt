1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant gmp-orphan SA submitted on 7 December 2015 an application for marketing authorisation to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Cuprior, through the centralised procedure under Article 3(1) and point 4 
of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the 
EMA/CHMP on 21 May 2015. 
The application concerns a hybrid medicinal product as defined in Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
refers to a reference product, as defined in Article 10 (2)(a) of Directive 2001/83/EC, for which a marketing 
authorisation is or has been granted in a Member State on the basis of a complete dossier in accordance with 
Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The applicant applied for the following indication Cuprior is indicated for the treatment of Wilson’s disease in 
patients intolerant of D-Penicillamine therapy. 
Cuprior was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/15/1471 on 19 March 2015. Cuprior was 
designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication:  Treatment of Wilson’s disease. The 
ground of the ODD at the time of designation was the lack of availability of the Reference Medicinal Product in 
the EU, resulting in an unmet medical need for the patients in the community.   
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Cuprior as an orphan medicinal product in the approved indication. 
The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Wilson’s disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in pathological copper accumulation. A 
mutation in the ATP7B gene, located on chromosome 13, is responsible for WD. The mutations lead to a 
defective ATP7B protein that normally mediates the binding of copper molecules to apoceruloplasmin in 
hepatocytes, forming ceruloplasmin, which can then safely transport the bound copper to its intended sites. In 
addition, the ATP7B protein serves to transport excess copper from hepatocytes into the bile for subsequent 
excretion, thus permitting safe elimination of excess copper. Such copper transport systems are required as, 
although copper is essential for cellular function, free copper is toxic and causes cell damage.  
Normal dietary consumption and absorption of copper (1 to 5 mg per day) exceeds the metabolic need of 
approximately 0.75 to 0.9 mg per day. Homeostasis of copper is maintained exclusively by biliary excretion; 
therefore if the excretory capacity is exceeded copper progressively accumulates in the liver and other tissues 
such as the brain, kidney, and cornea leading to the clinical manifestations of WD. 
2.1.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Wilson disease is found worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 1 case per 30,000 live births in most 
populations. More recent data from population screening by molecular sequencing in the UK suggest a 
potentially higher prevalence (Coffey, Brain 2013).  
2.1.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
WD presents symptomatically at any age, with the majority between 5 and 35 years (EASL 2012); 
asymptomatic patients are most often detected by family screening.  
Symptoms at the time of the initial presentation, and those that subsequently develop are most commonly 
categorised as hepatic or neurologic/neuropsychiatric. Hepatic symptoms are the initial clinical manifestation in 
about 40-50% of WD patients. The hepatic dysfunction symptoms are highly variable, ranging from 
enlargement of the liver or asymptomatic biochemical abnormalities, to overt cirrhosis or acute hepatic failure 
(Pfeiffer 2007). 
Neurologic or neuropsychiatric manifestations of WD typically present later than liver disease, most commonly 
in the third decade of life, but can also be present in childhood. There is a range of presenting neurologic 
abnormalities which are initially present in 40–50% of patients (Yarze, Martin et al. 1992). They include 
Parkinson-like akinetic-rigid syndrome, pseudosclerosis with tremor, ataxia, and dystonic syndrome. 
Neuropsychiatric abnormalities can also develop. These most commonly include personality changes and mood 
disturbances, particularly depression, but may also manifest as impulsiveness, disinhibition, paranoia or poor 
school performance. 
Other manifestations of WD include an ophthalmological marker, namely the presence of Kayser–Fleischer 
rings, which are caused by deposition of copper in Descemets membrane of the cornea. These are present in 
95% of patients with neurologic symptoms and over 50% of those without neurologic symptoms. According to 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 10/60 
  
  
EASL clinical practice guidelines in the European Union (EU) (EASL 2012), “for routine monitoring, serum copper 
and ceruloplasmine, liver enzymes and international normalised ratio (INR), functional parameters, complete 
blood count and urine analysis as well as physical and neurological examinations should be performed regularly, 
at least twice annually (Grade II-2, B, 1, AASLD Class I, Level C)”.  
Untreated WD is universally fatal. Prognosis for survival depends on the severity of liver and neurological 
disease, and, of upmost importance, compliance with drug treatment (Ala, Walker et al. 2007). 
2.1.1.4.  Management 
Treatment of WD aims to control free serum copper levels within acceptable limits. Dietary control of copper 
intake is not sufficient in most patients, and pharmacological treatments are therefore needed. It is generally 
accepted that the most effective treatments are copper chelators which bind with copper and promote copper 
excretion from the body.  
There are two currently approved types of copper chelating agents, D-penicillamine and trientine. According to 
EASL clinical practice guidelines in EU (EASL 2012), “Initial treatment of symptomatic patients with WD should 
include a chelating agent (D-penicillamine or trientine). Trientine may be better tolerated (Grade II-1, B, 1, 
AASLD Class I, Level B)”. Due to its better efficacy, D-penicillamine is the first line treatment for patients with 
WD. 
However, about 20 to 30% of the WD patients using D-penicillamine will experience adverse reactions (Merle, 
Schaefer et al. 2007; EASL 2012; D-Penicillamine SmPC 2014) in the first 1–3 weeks of the treatment, which 
often result in discontinuation of treatment. Long-term use of D-penicillamine carries further risks of side 
effects. 
The trientine salt TETA 2HCl was introduced in 1969 as a copper chelator alternative to D-penicillamine (Walshe 
1969). Trientine may have a dual mechanism of action for decreasing copper levels by also reducing copper 
absorption from the gut (Ala, Walker et al. 2007; EASL 2012). TETA 2HCl is registered in the UK and US and 
mostly used for treatment of WD in patients intolerant to D-penicillamine (Schilsky 2001; Ferenci 2004; Ala, 
Walker et al. 2007). 
Zinc salts are also used for the treatment of WD. Zinc salts are usually not recommended for the initial therapy 
of symptomatic patients because of the slow onset of action, but may be used as monotherapy in asymptomatic 
patients or for maintenance therapy when copper levels are below toxic thresholds and patients are clinically 
stable. Zinc salts may be considered also in symptomatic patients in combination with a chelating agent, 
D-penicillamine or trientine.  
Pharmacological therapy remains the primary treatment in WD, although its efficaciousness may diminish in 
more advanced disease states. If patients are already presenting with decompensated cirrhosis, they may be 
treated intensively with chelators, however if patients are unresponsive to this approach a liver transplant would 
be required. For patients who develop acute liver failure, liver transplantation is the only option for survival, with 
survival rates reported up to 59- 76% at 5-10 years (Medici, Mirante et al. 2005), with poorer outcomes 
observed in those patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms. The use of liver transplantation has also been 
reported to be used in patients with severe neurological disease (Schumacher, Platz et al. 1997), however its 
use as a primary treatment is not recommended (Roberts and Schilsky 2008).

2.1.2.  About the product  
Cuprior contains the active substance trientine tetrahydrochloride (TETA 4HCl) and is presented as 150 mg 
scored tablets (150 mg trientine base). The application is a hybrid referring to the reference product Univar’s 
trientine dihydrochloride (TETA 2HCl) 300 mg capsules (200 mg trientine base). TETA 4HCl and TETA 2HCl share 
the same active moiety (trientine) and the same mechanism of action. 
The therapeutic indication of Cuprior proposed by the applicant was that of the reference product “Treatment of 
Wilson’s Disease in patients intolerant to D-penicillamine”. Univar’s TETA 2HCl capsules have been approved in 
the United Kingdom for the treatment of WD in patients intolerant of D-penicillamine therapy since 1985. 
The dosing regimen proposed by the applicant was 3-7 tablets of Cuprior, administered 2 to 4 times a day in 
adults and 2-4 tablets administered 2 to 4 times a day in children. The product is titrated to target according to 
clinical response and serum copper levels. 
The therapeutic indication approved by the CHMP is:  
“Cuprior is indicated for the treatment of Wilson’s disease in adults, adolescents and children ≥ 5 years 
intolerant to D-penicillamine therapy.” 
The dosing regimen approved by the CHMP is: 
The starting dose would usually correspond to the lowest dose in the range and the dose should subsequently be 
adapted according to the patient’s clinical response. 
The recommended dose is between 450 mg and 975 mg (3 to 6½ tablets) per day in 2 to 4 divided doses. 
 Paediatric population 
The starting dose in paediatrics is lower than for adults and depends on age and body weight.  
Children ≥ 5 years  
The dose is usually between 225 mg and 600 mg per day (1½ to 4 tablets) in 2 to 4 divided doses.  
Children aged < 5 years 
The safety and efficacy of trientine in children aged < 5 years have not been established.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as tablets containing trientine tetrahydrochloride equivalent to 150 mg 
trientine as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: mannitol, colloidal anhydrous silica, glycerol dibehenate. 
The tablet can be divided into equal doses. 
The product is available in OPA/Alu/PVC-Alu blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.

2.2.2.  Active  substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance is triethylenetetramine tetrahydrochloride corresponding to the 
molecular formula C6H22N4Cl 4. It has a relative molecular mass of 292.08 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1 – Structure of triethylenetetramine tetrahydrochloride 
The structure of the active substance has been confirmed by the following methods: elemental analysis, 1H- and 
13C- NMR, FT-IR, mass spectroscopy, XRPD, TGA and DSC. 
The active substance is a white, not hygroscopic crystalline powder, freely soluble in water.  
The active substance active substance has a non - chiral molecular structure.  
Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance.  Two polymorphic forms have been identified. The 
same polymorphic form is consistently produced by the manufacturing process. Polymorph screening 
experiments have shown that another crystalline can be formed but always in mixture with the expected 
polymorphic form and only on specific conditions which cannot be linked to the manufacturing process or 
storage conditions of the active substance. It has been proven that the expected polymorph form is stable over 
12 months stored at long term and accelerated conditions (25°C/60%RH and 40°C/75%RH).  
Trientine tetrahydrochloride is not the subject of a monograph in the Ph. Eur. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests: appearance, identification (FT-IR), identification of chlorides 
(Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), assay (titrimetry), related substances (GC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. 
Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.),  microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.), and particle size 
distribution (Ph. Eur.).  
The absence of control of polymorphism was considered acceptable in view of the data provided to demonstrate 
that the expected polymorphic form is consistently produced by the manufacturing process and is stable. It was 
also taken into account that the active substance is very soluble throughout the physiological pH range from pH 
1.2 to 6.8 whatever its crystalline form and is absorbed in vivo in the intestinal tract in its basic form, therefore 
it was considered that the polymorphic form has no impact on solubility. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for identification and related substances testing has been presented. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017

Batch analysis data for six production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data were provided for three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for 18 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 
60% RH and under intermediate conditions 30 ºC / 65% RH and for up to 12 months under accelerated 
conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, pH, loss on drying, related substances and assay.  
The analytical methods used were the same as for release with the exception of the related substances method 
which has been redeveloped during the stability study.  The specificity and stability indicating nature of the 
related substances method has been adequately demonstrated. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
Stress studies were performed on the active substance (heat, humidity, heat and humidity, acid, base, light, 
oxidant). Results provided showed that the active substance is slightly sensitive to heat and humidity, and to 
oxidation. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance trientine tetrahydrochloride is manufactured in two steps (salt formation and 
recrystallization) using a commercially available well defined starting material with acceptable specifications. 
The choice of starting material has been adequately justified. A detailed description of the manufacturing 
process and a flow scheme have been provided. Reprocessing is proposed for the recrystallization step and is 
considered acceptable. 
The CHMP raised a concern related to the purging and fate of all impurities present in the starting material during 
the active substance manufacture.  The CHMP recommended providing data by end of Q2 2017 to confirm that 
chlorinated moieties are not present in the active substance.  The data should include an impurity tracking grid 
(including the steps where all impurities are formed and purged) and a list of potential genotoxic impurities. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were discussed with regards to their origin 
and characterised.  In addition the CHMP recommended identifying an unknown impurity in the active 
substance.

The active substance manufacturing process development section is clearly explained, any inferences are 
supported by appropriate data, and the justification for moving to the final, commercial scale process is 
comprehensive and acceptable.    
The active substance is packaged under nitrogen inside LDPE bags, the bags are placed inside an aluminium bag 
and a sachet of desiccant (silica gel) is inserted between the LDPE and aluminium bags.  The bags are heat 
sealed and then placed into a high density polyethylene (HDPE) drum suitable for storage and shipping. The 
LDPE bags comply with Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 and the EC directive 10/2011 as amended. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The  finished  product  is  available  as  immediate  release  uncoated  white  to  off-white  scored  capsule-shaped 
tablets (16 × 8 mm). Each tablet contains 300 mg of trientine tetrahydrochloride (TETA 4HCl) equivalent to 150 
mg of trientine (TETA).  
The development work started with comparative studies to the already existing finished products: 
-TETA 4HCl capsules containing 150 mg of TETA 4HCl (75 mg of TETA) and spray-dried lactose given to Wilson’s 
disease patients as compassionate use supplies  
- TETA 2HCl Univar 300mg, hard capsules, approved in the United Kingdom containing TETA 2HCl equivalent to 
200 mg TETA. 
The objective of the formulation development was to obtain an immediate release scored tablet containing 300 
mg of TETA 4HCl that is stable at room temperature and permit accurate subdivision of the tablet to provide a 
half-dose  (150  mg)  for  young  patients  and  allow  flexibility  for  dose  titration  taking  patient  age/weight  into 
consideration. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The compatibility of the active substance with the excipients has been assessed with binary mixtures via Micro 
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). A possible interaction of TETA 4HCl has been highlighted with silica 
colloidal anhydrous but not with mannitol and glycerol dibehenate. However, stability data obtained to date did 
not show any compatibility issues with the selected finished product formulation. The role, the choice of the 
excipients and their concentration has been satisfactorily justified. 
The strategy for the formulation was to manufacture the tablets by direct compression. The choice of 
manufacturing process is adequately justified and exemplified, as are the decisions relating to elimination of trial 
formulations.  The choice of final formulation was made on the basis of formulation processability and stability, 
which is acceptable.  
The finished product is also for paediatric use: for paediatric patients from the age of 5 years. It has been 
confirmed that during formulation development paediatric requirements were taken into account, referencing 
the EMA reflection paper (formulations of choice for the paediatric population, EMEA/CHMP/PEG/194810/2005) 
and guideline (Pharmaceutical Development of Medicines for Paediatric Use (CPMP/805880).  The applicant has 
provided a justification for their approach during development, which is satisfactory.  Detailed discussion 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 15/60 
  
  
regarding the acceptability of (halved-) tablet size, the number of (halved-) tablets to be taken every day and 
acceptability of the proposed dosage form in the paediatric population is presented in the clinical section. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing.  
The development of the dissolution method is adequately described.  The discriminating power of the dissolution 
method was investigated and the scope of experiments performed is considered acceptable.   
Dissolution profiles of TETA 4HCl capsules and TETA 2HCl Univar 300mg, hard capsules were generated in 
support of inclusion into clinical data for the submission.  Dissolution profiles for TETA 4HCl AGEPS capsules were 
similar to that of Cuprior, whilst those for Univar were significantly different.  Investigations into the cause of this 
difference were performed and were inconclusive. Consequences of these results are discussed in the clinical 
and non-clinical sections. 
The primary packaging is OPA/Alu/PVC-Alu blisters. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended 
use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
TETA 4HCl coated tablets are made from a common direct compression procedure. The process consisted of 
pre-mixing  including  sieving,  mixing,  final  mixing  (lubrication),  compression  and  packaging.  The  process  is 
considered to be a standard manufacturing process. A detailed description of the manufacturing process and a 
flow scheme have been provided.  
It was confirmed that there is no holding time in the manufacturing process and that any future use of holding 
time will be registered by way of variation.   
Major steps of the manufacturing process especially final mixing and compression steps have been validated on 
three consecutive pilot batches by a number of studies. In view of the validation results obtained, in view of the 
absence of validation for some steps of the process and in view of the process changes implemented after the 
process validation, the CHMP recommended to validate the commercial scale manufacturing process prior to 
marketing taking into account the recommendations made during the MA procedure.  
It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification  
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance of tablet, 
identification (TLC, GC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), impurities (GC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), mean 
mass (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), subdivision of tablets (Ph. Eur.), assay (GC), microbiological quality 
(Ph. Eur.).  
Satisfactory justifications were provided for the absence of control of the tablet dimensions and hardness of 
tablet in the specifications. 
Comprehensive data has been provided to justify why control of polymorphic form need not be implemented. 
This includes clarification regarding comparative solubility data of both identified polymorphic forms 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 16/60 
  
  
 
comparative dissolution testing of tablet batches made with the two polymorphic forms discussion regarding the 
processability of polymorphic form and a discussion regarding the PK characteristics of the active substance. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines.  The applicant has demonstrated that the assay and related substances method is sufficiently 
stability indicating via forced degradation studies.   Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 4 pilot scale batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for 4 pilot scale batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months at 25 ºC / 
60% RH and 30°C/65%RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to 
the ICH guidelines. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested according to the shelf-life specifications described in the section above. The related 
substances method has been redeveloped and thus two methods have been used to generate related substances 
data. 
All data meet the specification limits at all time points, in all storage conditions. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. Results showed that the tablets are not light sensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 18 months without specific storage condition as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues related to active 
substance impurities and finished product process validation having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the 
product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 17/60 
  
  
 
 
 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
- to provide data by end of Q2 2017 to confirm that specific impurities are not present in the active substance.  
The data should include an impurity tracking grid (including the steps where all impurities are formed and 
purged) and a list of potential genotoxic impurities. 
- to identify an unknown impurity in the active substance (related substances method). 
-  to  validate  the  commercial  scale  manufacturing  process  prior  to  marketing  taking  into  account  the 
recommendation made during the MA procedure. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The sponsor has submitted a non-clinical overview of the pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological 
properties of trientine. The non-clinical  strategy is to refer largely to data in the published literature. The 
sponsor conducted in silico evaluations of the genotoxic potential of TETA 4HCL and three main impurities using 
DEREK and Leadscope assays. The sponsor also conducted an Ames test with TETA 4HCL.

The pharmacology studies sourced from published literature demonstrate proof of concept that TETA 4HCl can 
decrease copper levels in the liver and increase urinary excretion of copper in rats administered exogenous 
copper. Furthermore, in vivo models of WD in which rats accumulate copper and develop severe jaundice and 
fulminant hepatitis at approximately 4 months of age, were used to show the ability of TETA 2HCL to increase 
urinary copper excretion and reduction of hepatic copper levels. TETA 2 HCL was also shown to decrease single 
strand breaks associated with copper accumulation in renal cortex cells.

Secondary pharmacodynamic effects identified for trientine, were not necessarily related to the copper binding 
properties of the molecule. These include potential off target effects related to cardiovascular disease associated 
with diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, anti-cancer activity and the potential impact of trientine on divalent cations 
other than copper, such as iron and zinc. The possible secondary pharmacodynamic effect on iron and zinc levels 
is suitably addressed by wording in sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.3 of the proposed SmPC for TETA 4HCL.  
Safety pharmacology programme  
Safety pharmacology studies were not required with TETA 4HCL as the active moiety is identical to that of the 
marketed TETA 2HCL product, for which the clinical experience to date does not indicate a cause for concern. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 21/60 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, the approved therapeutic indication is similar for the reference medicinal product and Cuprior and 
higher bioavailability of Cuprior will be accounted for by dose adjustment.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No new non-clinical safety pharmacology studies or pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies with TETA 4HCL 
were provided and it is accepted that they would not add value to the safety assessment for this product.  
Section 4.5 of the proposed SmPC states: “Although there is no evidence that calcium or magnesium antacids 
alter the efficacy of trientine, it is good practice to separate their administration”. This recommendation is in line 
with the reference product SmPC and as the active moiety is the same, this is acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
There are limited data on the pharmacokinetics of trientine in animals and the PK section of the dossier relies on 
a review of animal absorption and PK data obtained with 14C-labelled trientine 2HCL (Lu, Poppitt et al. 2010), 
together with a small number of older publications including a distribution study of 14C-labeled TETA 4HCL in 
rats (Gibbs and Walshe 1985) and two excretion studies in rats by the same group (Kobayashi, Tanabe et al. 
1997; Kobayashi, Fujisaki et al. 1999). 
These data indicate a moderate rate of absorption in rat, rabbit and dog with low oral bioavailability due to first 
pass metabolism and evidence of an interaction with food, which is reflected in sections 4.2 and 4.5 of the 
proposed SmPC, indicating that Cuprior must be taken on empty stomach as food may impede its absorption. 
Nonclinical autoradiography studies indicate that trientine distribution is higher in the liver and kidney than 
plasma concentrations, with the highest concentration occurring at 1hr post-dose. Placental transfer of trientine 
has not been investigated. However, the low molecular weight suggests that exposure of the embryo can be 
expected. As studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity, which was probably a result of 
trientine-induced copper deficiency (see section chapter on reproductive toxicity below) Cuprior should only be 
used in pregnancy after careful consideration of the benefits compared with the risks of treatment in the 
individual patient. This is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
The non-clinical metabolism data suggest that the low oral bioavailability of trientine is due to rapid metabolism 
after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the formation of acetylated metabolites. Trientine 
resembles spermidine in structure and SSAT2 was identified as the main acetylator of trientine in vitro. Section 
5.2 of the SmPC identifies two major acetylated metabolites of trientine, N(1)-acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) 
and N(1),N(10)-diacetyltriethylenetetramine (DAT). MAT is thought to contribute to the overall copper chelating 
activity of trientine but the extent of this contribution of is unknown. Rat, rabbit and dog studies suggest plasma 
elimination half-lives of between 0.5 and 3 hours. Trientine appears to be excreted in rat urine mainly in the 
form of its acetylated metabolites (MAT and DAT) with highly variable (5 – 79%) overall recovery of the dose 
found in rat urine.  
In vivo and in vitro investigations into the mechanism of renal excretion of trientine indicated a specific, active 
excretion system for trientine. Trientine is not recognised by the H+/organic cation transporter, but a 
Na+/spermine antiporter on the renal brush-border membrane contributes to the secretion of trientine in the 
renal proximal tubule, but does not recognise the trientine-copper complex. The effect of drug interactions on 
urinary excretion of trientine in rat kidney was investigated. Drugs, such as diuretics, that change the 
concentration of sodium ions in proximal tubules were reported to increase trientine excretion but not 
trientine-copper complex excretion. It is not established if a similar transporter is involved in the urinary 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 22/60 
  
  
excretion of trientine in humans but the copper excess that occurs in WD patients favours the formation of 
trientine-copper complexes that are not a substrate for the Na+/spermine antiporter. 
Animal data on milk transfer of trientine are not available and only very limited information exists for humans. 
This is appropriately addressed in the SmPC. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology package consists of bibliographical references together with in silico genotoxicity analysis and a 
GLP-compliant in vitro Ames test on the genotoxicity performed by the applicant. The majority of the literature 
references consist of studies conducted with TETA 2HCL with the assumption that TETA 4HCL will display an 
efficacy and safety profile in WD patients similar to TETA 2HCL as the active moiety is identical.

Single dose toxicity  
Single dose toxicity is based on an OECD-SIDS initial assessment report that considered trientine of low acute 
toxicity after oral administration (LD50 rat > 2000 mg/kg) and moderate toxicity after dermal application (LD50 
rabbit 550-805 mg/kg). Exposure to saturated vapour was tolerated but exposure to aerosols leads to reversible 
irritations of the mucous membranes in the respiratory tract and trientine is considered harmful in contact with 
skin. 
Repeat dose toxicity  
Repeat-dose toxicity testing is based on two references that examine the toxicity associated with sub-chronic 
and chronic daily trientine administration in rodents and repeat-dose toxicity studies performed in dogs with 
TETA 2HCl, published by Maemura et al. 1998. Data from a 92-day drinking water administration study indicate 
that rats but not mice are susceptible to symptoms of copper deficiency when fed a copper-deficient diet, but 
TETA 2HCL reduced plasma copper levels at 600ppm and 3000ppm without inducing symptoms of copper 
deficiency in rats fed a diet containing nutritionally adequate levels of copper. A treatment-related increased 
frequency of uterine dilatation occurred in female rats at 3000 ppm TETA 2HCL but this was not considered of 
major toxicological significance and the rat NOAEL was considered to be 3000ppm, corresponding to an oral 
intake of approximately 270-276 mg/kg/day in males and 323-352 mg/kg/day in females. Treatment–related 
toxicity occurred in mice exposed to TETA 2HCl in drinking water at 3000ppm TETA 2HCL. Symptoms included 
increased frequencies of inflammation of the lung interstitium and liver periportal fatty infiltration in both sexes, 
with hematopoietic cell proliferation in the spleen, reduced kidney and body weights and renal cytoplasmic

vacuolization in males only. The mouse NOAEL was considered 600ppm, corresponding to an oral intake of 
approximately 92 mg/kg/day in males and 99 mg/kg/day in females. 
Treatment-related toxicity and mortality were reported after daily oral administration of up to 1200mg/kg/day 
TETA 2HCL  in a sub-chronic (4-8week) study in rats, with decreased body weight gain and food consumption 
between 5 and 8 weeks of treatment and two deaths in males with signs of pneumonia at 8 weeks of treatment 
at this dose. Increased electrolyte output, reported between week 4 and 8 for males treated with ≥ 
100mg/kg/day and females receiving ≥ 350mg/kg/day, was thought to be related to the hydrochloride nature of 
TETA 2HCL and low plasma alkaline phosphatase activities were reported in animals receiving 350 or 1200 
mg/kg/day of TETA 2HCL but were not considered clinically relevant. Post-mortem findings at 1200 mg/kg/day 
included high lung weights, bronchiolar epithelium hypertrophy and broncho-alveolar pneumonia, with 
submucosal acute inflammation within the glandular region of the stomach recorded for males given ≥ 350 
mg/kg/day and for females given ≥ 100 mg/kg/day. 
Treatment-related toxicity and mortality were also reported following chronic (26weeks) daily oral 
administration of up to 600mg/kg/day in rats, with treatment-related lung changes and one death in a male 
receiving 175 mg/kg/day and three deaths in males receiving 600 mg/kg/day, although the sub-chronic 
stomach findings were not replicated in this study. Post-mortem histopathology revealed dose-related incidence 
and severity of focal chronic interstitial pneumonitis accompanied by fibrosis of the alveolar walls in females 
given ≥ 175 mg/kg/day or males given ≥ 50 mg/kg/day. Microscopic examination indicated a persistent 
inflammatory reaction or persistent toxic effect on alveolar cells. Given trientine has irritating properties, it was 
considered likely that the lung findings were the result of a cytotoxic effect of trientine upon accumulation into 
bronchiolar epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes. The findings were not reversible. Reversible findings 
included: decrease body weight gain at 600 mg/kg/day; blood chemistry and urinalysis changes similar to those 
indicated in the 4- or 8-week study at dose levels ≥ 175 mg/kg/day. The rat NOAEL was considered 50 
mg/kg/day for females but a NOAEL was not establish for males (≤ 50 mg/kg/day).  
Subacute (4 week) and chronic (26 week) oral toxicity studies were also performed with TETA 2HCL in Beagle 
dogs, including toxicokinetic analysis. In the 4 week study, treatment related observations were essentially 
limited to animals of the high dose group receiving 300 mg/kg/day. Observations included clinical signs during 
the last week of treatment (hypoactivity, abnormal gait, ataxia and body tremor), a depressed extensor postural 
thrust reaction in some animals at the end of treatment, and occasional or multiple dark areas in the lungs at 
necropsy correlating with interstitial pneumonia. All findings except interstitial pneumonia showed evidence of 
reversibility at the end of the post-dose period. The NOAEL was established at 125 mg/kg/day. Toxicokinetic 
analysis revealed moderately rapid absorption (Tmax 0.9-1.3 hours) and an increase in exposure with an 
increase in dose. T1/2 was somewhat longer after repeated dosing (2.6-3.8 hours) than on day 1 (1.5-1.9 hours) 
but no significant accumulation of trientine occurred. 
In the 26 week study, three animals of the high dose 200 mg/kg/day group were sacrificed prematurely and 
treatment was stopped after 10 weeks treatment following the onset of severe clinical signs (marked 
hypoactivity, body tremors, abnormal gait, weak limbs, hunched posture and prominent carpal joints). The ante 
mortem neurological examination generally indicated depressed postural and flexor withdrawal reactions. These 
observations were rapidly reversible. Abnormal "stiff legged" gait and hypoactivity were evident from week 23 
of treatment in some animals given 100 mg/kg/day. A depressed extensor postural thrust reaction and/or 
slightly exaggerated patellar reaction were incidentally observed at this dose level. No noteworthy macroscopic 
or microscopic findings were recorded in muscles or nerves. However, the observed symptoms showed similarity 
to those reported in enzootic ataxia (“swayback”) in lambs which is induced by copper deficiency (Bennetts and 
Chapman 1937). Likewise (acquired) copper deficiency has been implicated in cases of ataxic myelopathy in

humans (Jaiser and Winston 2010). In the 26-week study in dogs, all treated groups displayed low copper and 
zinc concentrations in the liver and high urinary copper and zinc concentrations. Copper levels were also reduced 
in kidney and in plasma. Changes in copper levels were much more pronounced than changes in zinc levels, and 
the observed clinical symptoms were attributed to the pharmacological activity of TETA 2HCl. 
Clinical pathology changes observed were either minimal or also occurred in control animals and were therefore 
considered of no toxicological importance. Interstitial pneumonia, also observed in rats and mice, was seen in 
most animals including controls. The NOAEL of TETA 2HCL in this 26-week study was concluded to be 50 
mg/kg/day, associated with an AUC of 47.9 µg.hr/mL in males and 97.4 µg.hr/mL in females in week 13. The 
safety margins compared with the pharmacokinetic values obtained in healthy volunteers (TRIUMPH PK study) 
with TETA 2HCL and TETA 4HCL were 5 and 4 respectively in males, 30 and 17 respectively in females. 
Toxicokinetic analysis revealed a Tmax of 0.9-1.9 hours and an increase in exposure was found with an increase 
in dose. No significant accumulation was noted in females in week 26 compared to week 13, however exposure 
in males was markedly lower in week 26 than in week 13. The reduced exposure was attributed to animals being 
fed immediately after dosing on the sampling day in week 26, in contrast to the sampling day in week 13 where 
the time difference between dosing and feeding was at least 10 min (interaction with food).  
Genotoxicity 
A GLP-compliant Ames test conducted by the applicant indicated that TETA 4HCL is mutagenic in vitro. A similar 
finding was reported with TETA 2HCL (Heinz & Schroder 1981). Conversely, in vivo genotoxicity data from the 
literature reported that single intraperitoneal dose of up to 600 mg/kg trientine in a mouse micronucleus study 
in peripheral erythrocytes indicated no clastogenic activity (Leung, 1994). A second reference also reported that 
trientine was negative in vivo in a mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, with oral administration of up to 
6000 mg/kg and intraperitoneal administration of up to 250mg/kg (Heinz and Schroder 1981).  The genotoxic 
effects in vitro are most likely secondary to Cu/Zn depletion and can therefore be considered as non-relevant for 
the clinical situation.  
In silico, assessments of the three main impurities-  with DEREK and Leadscope prediction assays revealed no 
structural alert and it is therefore concluded that these impurities are of no mutagenic concern.  
Carcinogenicity 
No oral carcinogenicity study was conducted for trientine nor are any bibliographical studies reported. It is 
reported that life-time dermal application in mice did not induce skin tumours and trientine was shown to reduce 
DNA damage associated with copper accumulation in renal cortex cells in rats. Given the broad clinical use of 
TETA 2HCL which is authorised in the UK for the treatment of WD in patients intolerant to D-penicillamine since 
1985 and the clinical experience with TETA 4HCL from the compassionate use program in France from the mid 
1970’s to 2008, the lack of oral carcinogenicity studies can be accepted. 
Reproduction toxicity 
The reproductive and developmental toxicity assessment is based on two articles from the published literature, 
together with the OECD SIDS for TETA assessment report. An article by Walshe, 1982 states that there is no 
evidence of teratogenicity in animals treated with trientine, but does not support this with any data. Conversely, 
Keen, Cohen et al., 1982 report dose-dependent embryotoxicity (increased frequency of resorptions) and 
teratogenicity (increased frequency of abnormal foetuses), with the teratogenicity occurring at therapeutic 
concentrations in rats. However, these effects may be the results of trientine-induced copper deficiency and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017

possible zinc toxicity, as maternal plasma and foetal liver copper concentrations were low compared to control 
rats and maternal kidney and foetal liver zinc levels increased in a dose-related manner. In follow-up 
experiments copper supplementation reduced the teratogenicity of trientine, supporting the role of 
copper-deficiency in the trientine-induced teratogenicity. The need for careful monitoring of maternal serum 
copper levels throughout pregnancy and the potential need for dose adjustments has been identified in the 
SmPC (section 4.6). On this basis, the reproductive and developmental toxicity risks associated with 
trientine-induced alterations of copper concentrations can be accepted.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Please refer to above chapter on repeat dose toxicity. 
Local tolerance 
The local tolerance assessment for trientine is based on the nonclinical in vivo bibliographic data reporting 
treatment-related toxicities associated with trientine, in agreement with in silico data predicting that trientine 
would display sensitising properties. The repeat-dose toxicity assessment data showed increased frequencies of 
inflammation of the lung interstitium occurring in mice exposed to TETA 2HCl at 3000ppm in drinking water. In 
rats, daily oral sub-chronic (4-8 week) administration of TETA 2HCL at 1200mg/kg/day induced submucosal 
acute inflammation of the stomach, bronchiolar epithelium hypertrophy and broncho-alveolar pneumonia and 
two males died with signs of pneumonia.  While, chronic (26 weeks) daily oral administration in rats resulted in 
chronic interstitial pneumonitis of the lung with fibrosis of alveolar walls at ≥175mg/kg/day in females and ≥ 
50mg/kg/day in males, including mortality in four males (1 death at 175mg/kg/day and 3 deaths at 
600mg/kg/day). Furthermore, inflammatory lesions and erosions of the skin were reported when trientine was 
dermally applied to guinea pigs at a dose of 4mg/animal and strong dermal irritation was also noted in pregnant 
rabbits given dose levels up to 125 mg/kg TETA. However, the observations in lung are thought to be the result 
of a persistent cytotoxic effect of trientine upon accumulation into bronchiolar epithelial cells and alveolar 
pneumocytes. The longstanding use of trientine in the clinic does not indicate a cause for concern related to local 
tolerance, this supersedes the need for further nonclinical local tolerance studies. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
For the phase I ERA, calculated estimates of log Kow = -1.4 and -2.65 are reported for TETA 4HCL. Log Kow 
should be determined experimentally; a calculated value is generally not accepted. However, trientine is 
reportedly completely miscible in water, has 4 ionisable groups and would therefore not be expected to have a 
log Kow >4.5 within environmental pH range. Hence, the sponsor deemed PBT screening is not required and this 
reasoning is accepted. 
The predicted environmental concentration for trientine in surface water (PECsw) was calculated with a refined 
Fpen. This Fpen refinement is based on a prevalence of Wilson’s disease of 0.6 in 10,000 for which a worst case 
estimate of 1/3 will be intolerant to D-penicillamine (refined Fpen = 0.000018). This is acceptable as orphan 
status has been granted for TETA 4HCL (EU/3/15/1471). The worst case PECsw (0.00945µg/L) is below the 
action limit of 0.01 µg/L and TETA 4HCL is considered unlikely to represent a risk to the environment following 
its prescribed use in patients.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The primary pharmacodynamic studies are bibliographic. They establish proof of concept of the copper depleting 
properties of trientine. TETA 4HCL is shown to increase urinary excretion of copper and reduce liver copper 
concentration in rats administered exogenous copper, while TETA 2HCL is shown to have similar effects in a rat 
model of WD. Secondary pharmacodynamics, also by bibliographic reference, identified off target effects of 
trientine including decreasing single strand breaks associated with copper accumulation in renal cortex cells of 
rats. Off target effects on other divalent cations such as iron and zinc were identified, the potential effect on iron 
and zinc levels is addressed in section 4.4, 4.5 and 5.3 of the SmPC, indicating that iron absorption may be 
decreased by trientine treatment and iron supplementation may be necessary. 
Safety pharmacology studies were not performed for this hybrid application with TETA 4HCL as the active moiety 
is identical to that of the marketed TETA 2HCL product, for which the clinical experience to date does not indicate 
a cause for concern. The justification for the absence of safety pharmacology studies is acceptable and the 
pharmacology section is considered adequate. 
The pharmacokinetic studies are also bibliographic and consist mainly of rat studies, although limited data from 
rabbits and dogs are also reported. The rat studies indicate that TETA 2HCL and TETA 4HCL have comparable 
dispositions in the rat, including low oral bioavailability due to first pass metabolism, which is lower again in a fed 
state. This evidence of an interaction with food is reflected in sections 4.2 and 4.5 of the proposed SmPC, 
indicating that Cuprior must be taken on empty stomach as food may impede its absorption. SSAT2 was 
identified as the main acetylator of trientine in vitro and section 5.2 of the identifies two major acetylated 
metabolites of trientine, N(1)-acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) and N(1),N(10)-diacetyltriethylenetetramine 
(DAT). MAT may also contribute to the overall clinical activity of Cuprior, however the extent of MAT to the 
overall effect of Cuprior on copper is not determined. 
The toxicology package consists mainly of bibliographic studies performed with TETA 2HCL. Trientine was 
considered to have low acute toxicity after oral administration and moderate toxicity after dermal application, 
based on LD50 data from rats and rabbits respectively, and trientine is considered harmful in contact with skin. 
Irritating and sensitising properties of Trientine shown in animals are reflected in the SmPC. Treatment-related 
toxicity in the stomach (sub-mucosal acute inflammation; sub-chronic study only) and the lungs (focal chronic 
interstitial pneumonitis accompanied by fibrosis of the alveolar walls) with associated mortality were reported 
from repeat-dose toxicity testing in rodents. These findings were attributed to the irritant properties of trientine 
and have not been confirmed in clinical use in WD patients. Duodenitis and colitis have been reported in humans 
and are mentioned as adverse reaction in the SmPC but there are no indications of lung lesions or adverse

respiratory effects under the clinical conditions of use. Increased electrolyte output was reported in the 
sub-chronic toxicity study with TETA 2HCL, thought to be related to the hydrochloride nature of TETA 2HCL, and 
low plasma alkaline phosphatase activities were also reported.  
Repeat-dose toxicity of TETA was discussed by referring to studies in mice, rats and dogs. Toxicokinetic data 
were concomitantly obtained in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in the dog (Maemura et al. 1998). An exposure 
assessment versus human exposure based on AUC compared to PK from healthy human volunteers revealed 
exposure rations of 5 and 4 in males and 30 and 17 in females, for TETA 2HCL and TETA 4 HCL respectively. 
TETA was clearly positive in the Ames test and other (non-GLP) in vitro assays but showed negative results in in 
vivo mouse bone marrow MN studies. The genotoxic effects in vitro are most likely secondary to Cu/Zn depletion 
and can therefore be considered as non-relevant for the clinical situation. No long- or short term studies on 
carcinogenicity with oral application of TETA are available. Clinical experience with TETA 2HCl in WD patients 
does so far not indicate a carcinogenic risk for TETA. Therefore, it can be agreed that carcinogenicity studies are 
not needed for TETA 4HCl. Impurities identified for TETA 4HCl have been sufficiently qualified through DEREK 
and LEADSCOPE analysis. 
Trientine has shown embryotoxicity and teratogenicity in pregnant rats, with the teratogenicity occurring at 
therapeutic concentrations. These effects are thought to result from trientine-induced copper deficiency and 
possible zinc toxicity, as maternal plasma and foetal liver copper concentrations were low compared to control 
rats and maternal kidney and foetal liver zinc levels increased in a dose-related manner. The role of copper 
deficiency in the treatment-related teratogenicity finding is supported by follow-up experiments in which copper 
supplementation reduced the teratogenicity of trientine. The need for careful monitoring of maternal serum 
copper levels throughout pregnancy and the potential need for dose adjustments has been identified in the 
SmPC (section 4.6). On this basis, the reproductive and developmental toxicity risks associated with 
trientine-induced alterations of copper concentrations can be accepted. 
The treatment of children is not supported by juvenile toxicity studies. However, dose adjustment will be 
performed for different age groups to support the safe use in the paediatric population.  
In agreement with the in silico prediction that trientine would display sensitizing properties, in vivo data from 
dermal application of trientine indicated treatment-related inflammatory lesions and erosions of the skin in 
guinea pigs and strong dermal irritation in pregnant rabbits. Furthermore, persistent cytotoxic effects of 
trientine in the lungs were observed during the repeat-dose toxicity testing. However, the longstanding use of 
trientine in the clinic does not indicate a cause for concern related to local tolerance and this supersedes the 
need for further nonclinical local tolerance studies. 
TETA 4HCL PECsurfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and it is not a PBT substance as log Kow 
does not exceed 4.5. Hence, no environmental effects are likely and a Phase II Tier A environmental fate and 
effects programme is not required. TETA 4HCL is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The majority of the literature references consist of studies conducted with TETA 2HCL which was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP as the active moiety of TETA 4HCL is identical. Overall the bibliographic primary 
pharmacodynamics studies provided adequate evidence to establish proof of concept of the copper depleting 
properties of Cuprior.

The toxicology package consists of bibliographical references together with in silico genotoxicity analysis and a 
GLP-compliant in vitro Ames test on the genotoxicity performed by the applicant. TETA was clearly positive in 
the Ames test and other (non-GLP) in vitro assays but showed negative results in in vivo mouse bone marrow 
MN studies. The genotoxic effects in vitro were most likely secondary to Cu/Zn depletion and can therefore be 
considered as non-relevant for the clinical situation. No long- or short term studies on carcinogenicity with oral 
application of TETA are available. Clinical experience with TETA 2HCl in WD patients does so far not indicate a 
carcinogenic risk for TETA. Therefore, it can be agreed that carcinogenicity studies are not needed for TETA 
4HCl. In silico, assessments of the three main impurities with DEREK and Leadscope prediction assays revealed 
no structural alert and it is therefore concluded that these impurities are of no mutagenic concern.  
Safety pharmacology studies were not performed for this hybrid application with TETA 4HCL as the active moiety 
is identical to that of the marketed TETA 2HCL product, for which the clinical experience to date does not indicate 
a concern. The justification for the absence of safety pharmacology studies is acceptable and the pharmacology 
section is considered adequate. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for Cuprior 150 mg tablets containing trientine tetrahydrochloride equivalent to 150 mg 
trientine. To support the marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted two comparative PK 
studies with cross-over design. The TRIUMPH study providing the pivotal evidence was performed against the 
reference medicinal product under fasting conditions. The second comparative PK study (TRIUMPH-2) was 
performed against a product not authorised in the EU and provides only supportive pharmacological information 
on the product under assessment. In addition the application is supplemented by a retrospective, single centre, 
long-term cohort survey comparing efficacy and safety of TETA 4HCl and TETA 2HCl (“Lariboisière study”). 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its current version is of 
particular relevance. 
GCP 
The TRIUMPH studies were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. In the Lariboisière 
study, patient treatment (as compassionate use) and assessment was in accordance with clinical practice for the 
management of WD. GCP standards could not be applied due to the retrospective nature of the survey.  
There were no clinical trials submitted conducted outside the community.

Methods 
Study design  
This  was  a  single  center,  randomised,  interventional,  single  dose,  open-label,  cross-over  study  with  3  days 
wash-out period between two treatments to evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability, of both oral formulations 
in adult healthy male and female subjects. 
Subjects were admitted to the clinic on Day 0 (day prior to dosing) and were requested to stay in the clinic for 
3 days post-dose (Day 1 to Day 4), up to the last PK sampling time..  
A single dose of 600 mg of trientine base was administered of either test or reference product (see next section). 
Treatments were orally administered in a randomised order on Day 1, at time 0 (morning). 
Blood samples for PK determination were taken at various time points: Pre-dose (0.0), 0.5, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 and 72 h after dosing. 
Safety assessments were performed during this period. 
After a wash-out period of 3 days (at home), subjects returned to the clinic the evening before dosing (Day 7) 
and were treated with the other formulation at time 0 on Day 8. Subjects were followed-up and assessed over 
the subsequent three days (Day 8 to Day 11) as described for the first treatment period. A final follow-up visit 
at the clinic took place at Day 15 (± 1 day).  
Test and reference products  
Treatment A: 900 mg trientine dihydrochloride (TETA 2HCl, MAH Univar  BV), 3 capsules of 300 mg, each 
containing 200 mg of trientine base, administered orally (total of 600 mg trientine base administered). 
Treatment B: 1200 mg trientine tetrahydrochloride (TETA 4HCl,  gmp-orphan), 4 tablets of 300 mg, each 
containing 150 mg of trientine base, administered orally (total of 600 mg trientine base administered). 
Population(s) studied   
Twenty-six healthy volunteers were randomised to receive equal amounts (600mg) of TETA base, either as TETA 
2HCl (the EU reference product) or TETA 4HCl (Cuprior). Twenty-four subjects received TETA 2HCl and 
twenty-five received Cuprior. Twenty-three subjects completed the study per protocol and received both 
treatments. 
Fourteen subjects were male and twelve were female. At screening subjects’ mean (s.d.) age was 24.5 (5.6) 
years all were Caucasian, none was a current tobacco smoker, mean (s.d.) BMI was 22.93 (2.09) kg/m2 with a 
range of 19.2 to 26.9 kg/m2. 
No subjects were excluded from analysis due to protocol deviations. There were no major protocol deviations 
and it is unlikely that other deviations affected the interpretation of the study results. There was no concomitant 
medication reported during the study.

Analytical methods  
All analytes were measured using a validated high performance liquid chromatographic tandem mass 
spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method. The analytical method used was validated in accordance with EMA Guideline 
on Bioanalytical Method Validation. The analytes were trientine (TETA), N1 acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) 
and N1,N10-diacetyl triethylenetetramine (DAT). 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
Pharmacokinetic parameters: 
• 
Plasma concentrations of the parent entity (trientine base, TETA) and the two major metabolites 
(N1-acetyltriethylenetetramine, i.e. MAT; and N1, N10-diacetyltriethylenetetramine, i.e. DAT) at the 
selected time points. 
•  AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, t1/2, λz, Cmax, and Tmax. 
The PK variables (Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, t½, and λz after single dose) of trientine and its two major 
metabolites were summarised using descriptive statistics including arithmetic mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum/maximum, coefficient for the between-subject variation. For comparability of the two 
products the geometric mean, ratio of geometric means, confidence intervals (CI) including their logarithmic 
transformation together with the coefficient of variation for the within-subject variability were summarized. 
Statistical methods   
Statistical analysis of pharmacokinetic data was planned to be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or higher.

Table 3.  Statistical Comparisons of Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Trientine (TETA), after Administration of 
Trientine Dihydrochloride (TETA 2HCl) and Trientine Tetrahydrochloride (TETA 4HCl) in Healthy Male and 
Female Subjects. 
Following oral administration at a single dose of 600 mg trientine base in healthy male and female subjects TETA 
was rapidly absorbed with median Tmax values of 2.00 hours and 3.00 hours for the test product (TETA 4HCl 
tablets) and reference product (TETA 2HCl capsules), respectively. 
The rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC0-inf) of TETA absorption for TETA 4HCl were greater (~68% and ~56% 
increase in Cmax and AUC0-inf, respectively) than those after administration of the reference product. The 
terminal elimination rate (λz) and terminal half-life (t1/2) for TETA were similar between the test and reference 
products.

The terminal elimination half-life (t½β, arithmetic mean ± SD) calculated in the TRIUMPH study was 19.9 ± 
8.70h for TETA 4HCl and 23.2 ± 20.8h for TETA 2HCl, with wide variability between subjects. Most published 
studies have reported shorter t1/2 values for trientine e.g. Cho et al. showed half-lives of 5-14 hours, increasing 
with dose.  
TRIUMPH-2 study 
A second PK study performed to meet US registration requirements was submitted in form of a summary. Since 
TRIUMPH-2 was conducted versus the US FDA approved trientine product Syprine the data are only supportive, 
but informative for the characterisation of the PK behaviour of Cuprior (linear PK). 
The TRIUMPH-2 study provides data on Cuprior for 2 oral doses (450 mg and 750 mg) of trientine base (ratio of 
high to low dose: 1.67). The mean plasma concentration over time for trientine and its two major metabolites 
(MAT and DAT) at the lower and higher oral doses of Cuprior are illustrated below:

Additional data  
Dissolution profile  
The dissolution of Cuprior TETA 4HCl tablets was compared with that of  
Univar’s TETA 2HCl capsules that was used as a reference product for TETA 4HCl tablets in the TRIUMPH 
pharmacokinetic (PK) study. Dissolution was tested at pH 1.2; pH 4.0 and pH 6.8.  
Dissolution tests showed that the dissolution rate for the EU reference capsules was about eight times slower 
than that for the tablets. In addition, while the active substance is completely released from the capsules by 120 
minutes, the capsules were not completely dissolved at the end of the dissolution test (240 min), as a shell still 
remains. The same behaviour has been noticed in two different batches of Univar capsules. 
Dose proportionality 
Literature References 
In an earlier study by Tanabe et al (1996) using a local Japanese TETA 2HCl formulation, the combination of 
trientine + metabolites levels appeared consistent with dose proportionality, which was not clearly shown for the 
unchanged or metabolised trientine alone. 
The study by Cho et al. (2009) showed consistent single/multiple-dose PK and dose-proportional and serum 
concentration-proportional effects on enhancing copper excretion using a TETA 2HCl development formulation. 
Analysis of the AUC and Cmax confirmed their linear relationship with oral doses of 200 to 3600 mg/d. 
TETA 2HCL had consistent single/multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and dose-proportional and serum 
concentration-proportional effects on enhancing copper excretion in healthy subjects.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.4.  Additional expert consultation 
At day 180 of the procedure a major objection precluded a recommendation of marketing authorisation 
pertaining to the bridge to the reference product, Univar´s TETA 2HCL. 
Therefore the CHMP decided to consult the Pharmacokinetic Working Party (PKWP). Questions to the PKWP as 
well as their advice are outlined below.  
PKWP response to questions 
Note on the PK bridge: The pharmacokinetic questions relates to a PK bridge to extrapolate both 
efficacy and safety. However, if intestinal luminal chelation and thus inhibition of copper 
absorption contributes to a significant part of the efficacy, PK will not be sufficient to extrapolate 
efficacy, in particular between two products with apparently very different dissolution 
characteristics. In that case, it seems appropriate to obtain PD data in healthy volunteers or 
patients supporting similar intestinal effect on orally administered copper.  Available literature from 
Siegemund R. et al. (1991) demonstrated that TETA 2HCl (1.2 g/day) was able to chelate copper in the intestinal 
tract, reducing copper absorption into the body.  
Value of knowing the exact correction factor: As this drug is individually titrated and has variable 
CHMP assessment report

pharmacokinetics, recommending monitoring is advisable also in the switch situation.  
The impact to inter-formulation differences is to some extent reduced by the monitoring and titration as long as 
the monitoring can provide fast enough support to avoid safety and efficacy problems. However, the correction 
factor also affects the starting dose. If the corrected starting dose is not adequate, this may not be completely 
solved by titration. 
1.  In order to account for the difference in bioavailability between Cuprior and the reference 
product in the TRIUMPH study the company proposes an adjustment  factor to support a 
posology matching the exposure of Cuprior (TETA 4HCL) with the reference product (Univar´s 
TETA 2HCL). The PKWP is asked to comment on the robustness of the adjustment factor 
approach, across the entire dose range. 
PKWP response 
The in vitro dissolution rate of TETA 4HCL tablets (test) is markedly faster than of Univar TETA 2HCL capsules 
(reference). However, a capsule with TETA 2HCL and TETA 4HCL showed similar, and quite fast dissolution. 
Thus, the difference in dissolution rate appeared to be more related to the formulation and not to the different 
salt per se.   
The exposure of TETA comparing geometric means is approximately 56% higher after administration of the test 
product when comparing a 600 mg dose (as trientine base). This difference appears to reside from a higher 
fraction absorbed from the test product. The applicant proposes 0.6 to be used as correction factor for the dose 
recommendations. 
However, the submitted study is not sufficient as support of the 0.6 correction factor. Bioequivalence should be 
confirmed comparing the test and reference product, using the corrected dose of the test product 
Which dose-level to study depends on whether the pharmacokinetics is linear or not. There is data supporting 
linearity of a 2HCL containing product (Cho et al 2009). It is unknown to us whether the studied product is the 
same as the reference (i.e. has similar dissolution rate as the reference product), but based on the Clinical 
Overview, a product called Protemix’s TETA 2HCl formulation is used. Thus, the data supporting linear 
pharmacokinetics may not be relevant for the reference or the test product. In a situation where linearity has not 
been demonstrated, investigating the lowest and highest dose is suitable.  
To take the absence of linearity information into account, we propose that the bioequivalence study is performed 
at the lowest starting dose. As the doses relevant for the correction factor, i.e. 150 mg base for the test and 250 
mg base for the reference, cannot be compared due to the absence of a 250 mg strength for the reference 
product, the existing strengths should be used i.e. 150 mg (as base; one 150 mg tablet) for the test and 200 mg 
(as base; one 300 mg capsule) for the reference. The results obtained should then be adjusted in order to 
estimate the results that would have been obtained if a dose of 250 mg base of the reference product had been 
administered. This can be done if pharmacokinetics is linear by adding an adjustment factor to the point 
estimate of this bioequivalence study in log scale instead of correcting all individual values of the 
pharmacokinetic endpoints. This adjustment factor is the logarithm of the ratio between the actually 
administered dose of the reference (200 mg base) and the reference dose that should have been administered 
if the correct strength had existed (250 mg), i.e. ln (250/200). Once the point estimate is corrected, the 90% CI 
is calculated based on that corrected point estimate and back-converted to the original scale as usual. 
If BE is shown in the new study the correction factor is considered adequately supported over the full dose 
range.

2.  Please comment on the comparability of the products in terms of food effect. Taking into 
account the SmPC recommendation to take Cuprior (as well as the RMP) without food do you 
consider the absence of comparative data with respect to the impact of food intake acceptable? 
PKWP response 
Cuprior should be taken on an empty stomach, 30 minutes to one hour before meals. According to the 
Applicant’s Clinical Overview this permits maximum absorption and reduces the likelihood of inactivation of the 
drug by metal binding in the gastrointestinal tract. The pharmacokinetic comparison (TRIUMPH study) was 
performed under fasting conditions. The in vivo absorption of TETA 4HCL tablets is faster than for the 2HCL 
reference product (2.7 vs 1.8 hrs). It is possible that there is still some inactivation from a meal taken 30 
minutes after drug administration. 
The food effect on a 2HCL formulation on the systemic exposure was only investigated in one subject. It is also 
unknown to us whether the formulation studied was the reference product. The effect observed was modest 
(unchanged AUC, reduced Cmax (from 3.8 to 1.5 mg/L), delayed Tmax (from 2 to 4 h) and prolonged t1/2 (from 
4 to 8 h). However, one subject is not considered sufficient to base any conclusion on regarding the food-effect. 
There are data in rats showing a 90% reduction in bioavailability when drug substance dissolved in water was 
administered with food (Sakuma et al 2007).  
Complex binding with metal ions may also limit absorption when administered with food (see SmPC). This may 
lead to marked inter-administration variability. The effect of a faster absorption and dissolution on the direction 
and magnitude of such an interaction administering the drug in accordance with the SPC is difficult to foresee. 
In conclusion, it is unknown whether the test product, after applying the proposed correction factor, will be 
bioequivalent to the reference product when taken as proposed in the SmPC, which means 30-60 minutes before 
a meal.  Therefore, it is considered necessary to conduct a bioequivalence study between the test product with 
the proposed correction factor and the reference product, 30 minutes before a high fat meal. A high fat meal is 
recommended as a high-fat meal and the fasting condition then covers the two extremes of meal composition. 
Therefore, bioequivalence using the corrected dose for the test product needs to be shown also after intake of 
a high-fat meal 30 minutes after drug administration. Preferably the food should be representative for the daily 
diet with respect to interacting metal ions.  
If bioequivalence is shown under fasting conditions at a low dose, this, together with the available data on 600 
mg base, also gives some indications that the pharmacokinetics is linear. If so, any dose level (still using the 
corrected dose for the test product) can be used when investigating the bioequivalence between the test and 
reference taken 30 minutes before a high-fat meal.  
If bioequivalence is not shown when the products are administered 30 minutes before a meal, and the applicant 
liked to change the food intake recommendations in the SPC, further pharmacokinetic data is needed to support 
the recommendation. 
3.  In view of the provided data on comparative bioavailability (TRIUMPH study) but also with 
reference to the overall PK data package, does the WP see a need to generate additional PK data 
in patients?  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 38/60 
  
  
 
 
 
PKWP response 
To our knowledge, there are no clear reasons to believe that product differences in absorption of TETA are 
different in patients than in healthy volunteers. Thus, PK data in healthy volunteers would be sufficient. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The aim of the TRIUMPH study was to compare the plasma profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters of trientine 
and its main metabolites, following the administration of TETA 2HCl and TETA 4HCl formulations, i.e. to establish 
a dose relationship or a ‘conversion factor’.  
The study provides information to support an adequate strength for TETA 4HCl. Rate and extent of TETA 
absorption after 600mg of TETA base from TETA 4HCl/Cuprior were greater by approximately 68% and 56%, for 
Cmax and AUC0-inf, respectively, than from the reference TETA 2HCL formulation. The TRIUMPH-2 results 
support linear and dose proportional kinetics of Cuprior across the evaluated dose range. The recommended 
dose for clinical use is between 450 mg and 975 mg (3 to 6½ tablets) per day, divided in 2 to 4 doses. The 
maximal single daily dose is consequently about 525mg (3.5 tablets); this is within what was tested in TRIUMPH 
and TRIUMPH-2. Dose linearity/ proportionality within the relevant dose range is therefore considered to be 
sufficiently demonstrated.  
Based on the comparative PK results the geometric mean ratios of test and reference formulations were used to 
find an adjustment factor suggesting a dose range for TETA 4HCl achieving similar exposure as under TETA 
2HCl.  Applying the proposed adjustment factor of 0.6, 1 mg of Univar’s trientine base equates to 0.6 mg of 
Cuprior’s trientine base. The minimum and maximum daily dose of the originator product is 800-1600 mg 
trientine base per day. The proposed dose range of Cuprior is 450mg-1050mg whereas the exact range to be in 
accordance with the Univar recommendations would be 480 mg – 960 mg applying the adjustment factor of 0.6. 
Taking into account also the confidence intervals for the calculation of the adjustment factor (and thus 
considering the possible extremes) a slight reduction of the maximum daily dose appeared appropriate. 
The recommended adult dose of Univar’s TETA 2HCl capsules is 1200-2400 mg/day (4-8 capsules), 
corresponding to 800-1600 mg of trientine base which is divided into 2-4 doses (Univar SmPC). Accordingly the 
recommended dose for Cuprior is between 450 mg and 975 mg of trientine base (3 to 6½ tablets) per day in 2 
to 4 divided doses.   
As trientine is titrated to target and Cuprior is actually not intended as first line treatment for initial treatment of 
WD (only for those intolerant to penicillamine) a possible overestimation of the starting dose (resulting in an 
underexposure, lower limit of AUC range 80.94%) is not believed to have a relevant impact on the patient’s 
clinical status.  
As a precaution, when initiating treatment with Cuprior, the lowest dose should be administered as stated in the 
SmPC; subsequently it should be titrated according to clinical response. For the maximum daily dose the worst 
case scenario (i.e. the upper limit of AUC range 109.79%) means a possible underestimation of exposure of 
about 10%. 
The maximum tolerated dose in a 14 days PK/PD study in healthy adult volunteers by Cho et al. 2009, was 
considerably higher than what could be expected for Cuprior, namely 3600mg/d ; however, the product used in 
that investigation (TETA 2HCL) was not further specified. In Cho’s study a dose dependent increase in adverse 
events was apparent. The concern that overexposure to trientine could lead to higher levels of free copper in the 
blood stream (by mobilisation of copper from tissues) resulting in (a deterioration of) neurological symptoms, 
would be applicable mainly for treatment naïve patients (who are not the target population). But this concern, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 39/60 
  
  
while based on physiological assumptions, seems to never have been recorded in second line treatment with 
trientine in clinical practice.  
The applicant concluded that the difference in dissolution observed between the two products was due to the 
unusual nature of Univar’s capsule rather than due to a difference between the capsule contents or the different 
salts of TETA 2HCl and TETA 4HCl. This was accepted by the CHMP however, several factors could also contribute 
to the observed results, such as e.g. different manufacturing processes or excipients. 
Indeed the individualisation of dosing with regular monitoring of copper levels once Cuprior therapy is initiated 
and subsequent adjustment of dose, as necessary ensure the dosing of Cuprior is in accordance with individual 
patients’ requirements. Such an individual ‘treat to target’ approach is required in the management of Wilson’s 
disease, regardless of trientine formulation, in view of the high intra- and inter-subject variability for trientine 
absorption and the variability and evolution in the clinical presentation. 
The presence of food reduces and delays the absorption of TETA. A study following oral administration of 1500 
mg TETA 2HCl in a healthy volunteer showed that food reduced Cmax (from 3.8 to 1.5 mg/L), delayed Tmax 
(from 2 to 4 h) and prolonged t1/2 (from 4 to 8 h).  
The food effect of Cuprior as compared with the reference product has not been studied and in view of the PK 
characteristics  of  Cuprior  and  the  reference  product  a  difference  in  food  effect  cannot  be  excluded.  For  the 
reference product, the food effect is believed to play a role also in clinical practice, considering the rather slow 
absorption of active moiety from the gut (T max 3 hours) and the relatively conservative PI recommendations. 
Intake  of  Univar’s  trientine  within  30  min  to  1h  before  food  could  result  in  a  limited  absorption  and  limited 
systemic exposure compared to Cuprior, where dissolution and absorption occur more quickly (T max 2 hours). 
Although the difference might even be enhanced by the “stricter” food recommendation proposed for Cuprior 
compared to the reference product, on the other hand this would lead to a more predictable and consistent 
systemic exposure. 
Trientine is titrated to target and individual variations are expected to be high and may have a larger impact on 
the  systemic  level  of  the  drug.  Therefore  small  differences  in  food  effect  between  products  are  not  being 
considered of clinical relevance. Relevant uncertainties such as the lack of a food effect study are appropriately 
outlined in 4.5 of the SmPC. 
No PD or PK drug interaction studies were identified in the literature. However, trientine has been shown to 
chelate iron and zinc in vitro (Kodama, Murata et al 1997) and increase zinc excretion in the urine of patients 
(Lu, Chan et al 2007), therefore an interaction with iron and zinc, particularly if given at the same time, cannot 
be excluded. Thus co-administration (at the same time) of trientine with iron and zinc should be avoided; this is 
appropriately addressed in the SmPC and in accordance with the reference product. In addition, the SmPC 
specifies that although there is no evidence that calcium or magnesium antacids alter the efficacy of trientine it 
is good practice to separate their administration (i.e. antacids should be taken after meals, while trientine is 
taken before meals). 
There are gaps in the data on special populations, e.g. WD patients with renal/hepatic impairment. The product 
information was amended with regard to limited information on renal impairment. Liver enzymes/liver function 
is monitored routinely in WD patients.  
Besides its systemic action TETA can reduce copper absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. Siegemund 
1991). The extent of its local effect (and possible consequences in view of the difference in PK between Cuprior 
and the RMP) were explored. A precise quantification of the contribution of intestinal luminal chelation to the 
efficacy of trientine is not possible due to limitations of the available data. It was concluded that when trientine 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 40/60 
  
  
is taken separately from food as recommended in the product information, the contribution of intestinal luminal 
chelation to the efficacy of trientine is limited. Also taking into consideration that the product  is titrated to target 
as outlined in the SmPC potential differences in in food effect/ food interaction between Cuprior and the RMP 
(due to Cuprior´s faster absorption) would be of small impact and no relevant difference in efficacy or safety due 
to the dual mechanism of action of trientine is expected.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant provided adequate pharmacological data to support the bridge to the reference product. Higher 
bioavailability of Cuprior in comparison to the reference product was addressed by calculating a conversion 
factor and dose reduction; adequate supportive data on dose linearity and applicability of the conversion factor 
over the whole dose range was provided. Possible differences in food effect and intestinal luminal chelation of 
copper are note of concern given dose titration in accordance with individual patients’ requirements and with 
regular monitoring of copper levels as outlined in the SmPC. 
2.4.7.  Clinical efficacy  
Alongside  supporting  literature  this  application  includes  data  from  long-term  clinical  experience  (as 
compassionate use) from Lariboisière hospital (Paris) presented as a retrospective cohort survey (Lariboisière 
report).  WD  patients  received  TETA  4HCl  and/or  TETA  2HCl  treatment,  thus  providing  data  from  a  clinical 
comparison of efficacy and safety between the different salts.  
The Lariboisière study was a retrospective, single centre, long-term cohort survey. The study was submitted as 
a pivotal study but can, due to severe shortcomings as regards design, conduct and reporting only be considered 
supportive evidence

Lariboisière study: 
A  Retrospective  Survey  of  Clinical  Experience  with  Trientine  Tetrahydrochloride  Salt  and  Trientine 
Dihydrochloride Salt as Therapy for Wilson’s Disease 
The product used in comparison to TETA 2HCL was a TETA 4HCL capsule formulation, different to Cuprior in 
pharmaceutical  form,  strength  and  composition.  Dissolution  tests  between  a  TETA  4HCL  formulation 
corresponding  to  the  historical  TETA  4HCl  formulation  used  at  the  Lariboisière’s  site  and  Cuprior  provided 
comparable dissolution rates in vitro (conducted at pH 1.2 only). 
Forty-three of the overall 248 recorded patients were included in the evaluation; the selection was based on 
availability of sufficient information and whether patients have been treated continuously for at least 12 months 
with  either  product.  Of  the  43  selected  patients  10  received  both  TETA  4HCl  and  TETA  2HCl  in  different 
treatment sequences (treatment sequences = application > 12 month duration), 2 patients received only TETA 
4HCl and 31 patients received only TETA 2HCl.  
The study objectives were the observation of hepatic and neurologic symptoms status in response to trientine in 
WD patients which are adequate in principle.  
This study was not blinded. Lower starting- and minimal doses of TETA 4HCL and an imbalance according to 
phenotype representation at baseline (more patients in the TETA 4HCl group had a neurologic presentation of 
the disease compared to the TETA 2HCl group (n= 8/13, 62% versus 19/44, 43%, respectively), are noted.  
Information on titration patterns (according to clinical response) was not available. Mean dosages used in the 
Lariboisière study (TETA 4HCL: 634.1+/- 250.5; TETA 2HCL 789.5+/-255.2, for TETA 4HCL were lower than for 
TETA 2HCL.

 Patients having monotherapy of at least 12 months trientine salt were 
eligible – the data are analysed by treatment sequences not by patient 
numbers. Patients could and did swap treatments so the number of 
sequences exceeds the number of patients. 
The doses of trientine base given at initiation of each evaluable treatment 
sequence were variable. The mean total daily dose of TETA 4HCl was 
634.1 ± 250.5 mg and the mean total daily dose of TETA 2HCl was 789.5

Symptoms 
The evolution of hepatic and neurologic symptoms was assessed by specialist physicians from Lariboisière 
hospital. At the end of the treatment sequences (regardless of presence of hepatic and/or neurologic symptoms 
at the start of the sequence) hepatic symptoms were assessed as “Improved” or “Unchanged” in 100% of TETA 
4HCl treatment sequences compared to 95.46% of TETA 2HCl sequences. Neurologic symptoms were assessed 
as “Improved” or “Unchanged” in 100% of TETA 4HCl sequences compared to 97.73% of TETA 2HCl sequences.

Kayser Fleischer Rings 
The evolution of Kayser Fleischer rings was also scored as “Increase”, “Diminution”, “Disappearance”, or 
“Unchanged” at the end of the treatment sequence. Kayser Fleischer ring evolution was comparable across the 
two trientine salts. During one TETA 4HCl sequence, a slight increase of the ring was reported, without 
deterioration of neurological or hepatic symptoms. During one TETA 2HCl sequence the rings were unchanged. 
During all other treatment sequences the rings disappeared or decreased. No new rings were observed in 
treatment sequences where they were absent at baseline. 
Biological Parameters 
Routine liver function tests, and copper levels are summarised below. There were no clinically meaningful 
changes in other biological parameters during the trientine treatment sequences. 
Liver Function Tests 
Parameters related to liver function, in particular AST and ALT, tended to improve in both the TETA 4HCl and 
TETA 2HCl treatment sequences. There were no statistically significant differences between the TETA 4HCl and 
TETA 2HCl treatment sequences in hepatic function tests (transaminases, GGT) (p > 0.05). 
Copper Levels 
There were no meaningful differences for copper levels at baseline between the treatment groups. Overall 
serum copper levels and urine copper excretion tended to remain stable or decrease from the beginning to the 
end of the trientine treatment sequences in both treatment groups. This is consistent with the use of trientine to 
effectively manage copper levels in patients the majority of whom were taking trientine as a second or third line 
treatment. In subjects where data were recorded, there were no statistically significant difference between the 
TETA 4HCl and TETA 2HCl treatment sequences in serum copper levels or urinary copper excretion. In addition, 
there were no significant differences in ceruloplasmin levels (p > 0.05).

Literature data: 
Literature  data  were  provided  and  compared  to  the  data  from  the  Lariboisière  study  to  confirm  results  on 
efficacy  and  safety.  Five  comparative  studies  have  been  identified  from  the  literature  3  were  considered  of 
particular relevance for efficacy by the applicant (Walshe 1973; Brewer, Askari et al. 2006; Weiss, Thurik et al. 
2013). 
TETA 2HCL was used in most cases (exception: Suda et al. (1993) who reported beneficial effects of TETA 4HCL 
in the chronic treatment of two adult WD patients using TETA 4HCL.) The exact composition of the products is 
generally unknown; sometimes the trientine salt was not specified.  
2.4.8.  Clinical safety 
Safety data relating to the application fall into three categories: 
1)  Applicant generated data from the single dose crossover PK comparability study of TETA 4HCL and TETA 
2HCL in healthy volunteers. 
2)  Applicant commissioned review of the Lariboisière experience 
3)  Data from the published literature. 
Patient exposure 
TRIUMPH study 
Twenty four subjects received a single 600 mg dose of trientine base as TETA 2HCL capsules and twenty five 
subjects received a single 600 mg dose of trientine base as TETA 4HCl tablets. 
Lariboisière Survey 
Data on the use of TETA 2HCl and TETA 4HCl from a compassionate use programme at the Lariboisière Hospital 
provide a safety comparison between the two salts in normal clinical practice. A retrospective survey evaluated 
patient data recorded between 1984 and 2010, and identified 43 patients who had received either or both 
trientine salts in monotherapy for periods of at least 12 months. Cumulatively data from more than 186 
patient-years of TETA 4HCl treatment and 326 patient-years of TETA 2HCl treatment were collected.  
The population included in the primary safety analysis contained 43 patients who received 57 trientine 
monotherapy treatment sequences comprised of 13 sequences of TETA 4HCl and 44 sequences of TETA 2HCl.  
Published literature 
The Applicant cites safety data from five comparative studies, seven non-comparative studies and seventeen 
case reports considered to be of relevance to the application.

Adverse events 
According to historical data Trientine is generally well-tolerated and has a favourable safety profile when 
compared to D-penicillamine. Cutaneous reactions, iron deficiency due to unwanted chelating of iron and 
gastrointestinal events are the most frequently reported AEs and this is in accordance with the SmPC of the 
reference product. Systemic lupus erythematosus is mentioned in the US prescribing information (Syprine) and 
lupus was also observed in the Lariboisière study in one patient receiving TETA 2HCL. The relation to treatment 
is unknown and it was only reported for one patient receiving the reference product, therefore it was agreed not 
to include lupus erythematosus in the list of adverse events but to mention available information in section 4.4 
of the SmPC. Lupus erythematosus was also listed as important potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Worsening of neurologic symptoms was reported in several publications and this was noted in 4.4 of the SmPC. 
As this could be a concern especially at treatment initiation in patients with high copper loads (treatment naïve 
patients or soon after treatment initiation) as the large amounts of copper being released from tissues could 
cause severe symptoms. To balance this risk it was outlined in the posology that the starting dose would usually 
correspond to the lowest dose in the range and the dose should subsequently be adapted according to the 
patient’s clinical response which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. However, a reliable estimation on 
nature and frequency of adverse events of TETA 4HCL (or TETA 2HCL) from the literature is not possible. 
In the Lariboisière study very few safety events were reported and no event was considered related to 
treatment; no TEAEs were reported in the Clinical Overview, the Summary of Clinical Safety or the survey 
report. The main focus of the safety evaluation in this retrospective study was events leading to discontinuation 
of therapy. Consequently, there is no table listing adverse events for TETA 4HCL or TETA 2HCL treatment 
including respective dose, time of occurrence within treatment sequence (time to event from the first dose) and 
outcome of the event. Though it is acknowledged that trientine is generally well tolerated it seems unlikely that 
no event, such as iron deficiency or gastrointestinal discomfort, occurred during the 512 patient years (186 
patient-years with TETA 4HCl and 326 patient-years with TETA 2HCl).  The results of the survey are not 
considered consistent with the established safety profile of trientine for the treatment of WD. The triggers for 
initiation of hepatic or neurologic assessment are not known. Hepatic assessment seems to have been 
performed only at initiation and termination of trientine but not during treatment. There are no individual patient 
reports available to help clarifying these issues. Information on titration patterns for comparison of dosage 
patterns and the necessity of up- and down-titration of both drugs are not available. The absence of a control 
group has to be taken into account when interpreting safety results. 
According to Suda et al. (1993) 4-hydrochloride is highly acidic and poses a problem in terms of its effect on 
mucous membrane of the gastrointestinal tract when being administered. However, impaired gastrointestinal 
tolerance of TETA 4HCL compared to TETA 2HCL could not be shown in the single dose setting in healthy 
volunteers (TRIUMPH), or multiple dose settings such as the Lariboisière study or any other historical source. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Lariboisière study 
Deaths: 
There were two deaths during the trientine treatment sequences, both occurring in the TETA 2HCl group. The 
cause of death was salivary gland cancer in one patient and suicide in the other patient who had neurological WD 
for over 30 years. Neither was considered by the treating physician to be related to treatment with trientine. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 46/60 
  
  
 
 
Other serious or significant adverse events: 
One  TETA  4HCl  treatment  sequences  was  stopped  due  to  re-occurrence  of  Kayser-Fleisher  ring  (without 
neurologic or hepatic deterioration). 
In the TETA 2HCl group the following severe AEs (all leading to discontinuation of treatment) were recorded: 
• 
two neurologic deteriorations associated with WD, which led to the addition of zinc therapy; 
•  One case each of: 
- 
- 
- 
increase  of  liver  copper  level  without  neurologic  or  hepatic  deterioration,  which  led  to  the 
addition of zinc therapy; 
lupus  in  a  patient  who  had  previous  lupus  after  D-penicillamine  use,  which  led  to  the 
replacement of TETA 2HCl by zinc treatment (see below for further details); 
hepatic  transplantation  due  to  suspicion  of  hepatocarcinoma,  which  led  to  TETA  2HCl 
discontinuation. 
The case of lupus was reported in a patient treated with TETA 2HCl who had previous lupus during their prior 
D-penicillamine treatment. This female patient was diagnosed with neurological WD and cirrhosis at the age of 
22 years. She was treated with D-penicillamine for 5 years but treatment was stopped due to the development 
of lupus. She then received TETA 2HCl for nearly 11 years, with improvement of  her  neurologic symptoms. 
However, the lupus returned and TETA 2HCl was replaced by zinc treatment.  
Summary from the Literature 
In Weiss, Thurik et al. 2013, gastric complaints (nausea, gastric pain) was recorded in two patients (1.4%) and 
arthralgia in four patients (2.8%). In addition one patient (0.7%) each discontinued TETA 2HCl treatment due 
to pruritus, myalgia, nephropathy, leucopoenia, increase of ANA antibodies, erythema, lupus erythematosus 
and hirsutism, although in some cases these events were a recurrence of events seen with previous 
D-penicillamine treatment. In Mercier- Jacquier, et al 2011, trientine was discontinued in 1 of 6 patients due to 
sideroblatic anaemia. In the Taylor, Chen et al. 2009 paediatric study, TETA 2HCl treatment was stopped in 3 of 
16 children due to allergic rash, low copper excretion and compliance problems requiring transplantation. 
In Brewer, Askari et al. 2006, 3 deaths were reported among the 23 WD patients with neurologic disease in the 
TETA 2HCl arm, of whom 3 were patients who deteriorated neurologically while receiving TETA 2HCl therapy. No 
death related to trientine treatment was reported in the other published studies. In Dahlman, Hartvig et al. 
1995, 3 of the 19 patients who received long-term TETA 2HCl treatment died: 2 patients from a multifocal 
cancer including the liver and 1 noncompliant patient from a ruptured spleen. 
The published literature cited by the Applicant contains many patient deaths generally due to progression of WD 
and often associated with non-compliance with treatment. The details provided do not allow the evaluation of 
the possible contribution of treatment to patient death.  
TRIUMPH study 
No deaths or serious AEs were reported.

Laboratory findings 
Lariboisière study 
Clinical laboratory evaluations seem to have been performed only at the start of each treatment sequence and 
when a treatment sequence was stopped and only in some patients.  This makes the interpretation of 
development of parameters over time difficult. Clinical laboratory evaluations, in particular ALT, AST, GGT, PR, 
platelets and total and conjugated bilirubin, were collected in 1-8 patients in the TETA 4HCL group. There are 
noticeable differences in certain laboratory parameters when comparing the TETA 4HCL and the TETA 2HCL 
treatment groups. Diverging development of some parameters, e.g. platelet count, conjugated bilirubin or GGT, 
are reported and could be interpreted as deteriorating effect of one product compared to the other. No further 
explanation/clarification is provided by the applicant. Baseline values of biological parameters seem balanced 
between the TETA 4HCL and the TETA 2HCL groups and are unlikely to have triggered the observed differences. 
However, only very few patients have undergone laboratory assessment and the sample size is too small to 
reliably conclude on any effect. Standard deviations are very large for certain parameters.  
TRIUMPH study 
In the TRIUMPH study there were no notable changes in laboratory parameters in either treatment group, and 
no patients had AEs related to laboratory tests. There seems to be no data/literature available comparing 
laboratory parameters of TETA 4HCL and TETA 2HCL in any population. 
Summary from the literature 
Laboratory results were not systematically reported in the literature, and the primary source of information on 
clinically significant laboratory abnormalities in the studies is those reported as AEs. Non adherence to 
treatment is a common cause of increased transaminase levels in patients with WD. This has been reported in 
several studies with trientine (Arnon, Calderon et al. 2007). Pancytopenia has rarely been reported (Roberts, 
Schilsy et al 2008). During the eight weeks of drug therapy of Brewer, Askari et al. 2006 study, one of the 
twenty-three patients (4.3%) in the TETA 2HCl arm reached criteria for anaemia and/or leukopenia. Overall, 
published studies did not report significant changes on laboratory parameters. 
None of the sources can be considered an authoritative source of data on laboratory variables as indicators of 
treatment related AEs. 
Safety in special populations 
Literature data  
Data on the safety of trientine are available from many regions worldwide, without an indication of a potential 
difference in safety. In addition, one study specifically reported the use of trientine in 3 Japanese patients with 
WD and associated neurological symptoms who were intolerant to D-penicillamine. TETA 2HCl was administered 
in 1 patient and TETA 4HCl in 2 patients for 7 to 9 years (then switched to TETA 2 HCl) with no AEs (Suda et al. 
1993). 
In general most of the studied populations in the literature (on TETA 2HCL) contained diabetic patients, 
paediatric patients, elderly patients, and patients with renal and hepatic impairment, and did not report any 
differences in safety. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 48/60 
  
  
 
Some additional publications specifically reported the use of TETA 2HCl or an unspecified trientine salt in 
paediatric patients with WD (Arnon, Calderon et al. 2007; Taylor, Chen et al. 2009; Kleine, Mendes et al. 2012; 
Lingam, Wilson et al. 1987; Santos Silva, Sarles et al. 1996), in elderly patients with WD (Ala et al. 2005), and 
in WD patients with nephroses following D-penicillamine therapy (Merle, Schaefer et al. 2007; Dubois, 
Rodgerson et al 1990; Siafakas, Jonas et al 1998). No differences in safety were seen in any subgroups.  
The Applicant cites on publications pregnancy in WD patients.   
Most of the literature data seems to have been collected with TETA 2HCL capsules. 
Lariboisière survey  
Paediatric patients were included in the Lariboisière study and are mentioned in many historical literature 
reports on trientine. As for the evaluation of efficacy, few specific clinical data are available for the assessment 
of safety of Cupior tablets or other TETA 4HCL formulations or trientine in general, also in the paediatric 
population. Most historical data were generated with TETA 2HCL.  
Published literature  
According to the available literature no difference in the safety profile of TETA 2HCL between adults and children 
is expected. Paediatric patients were generally treated with lower doses than adults and this is proposed also for 
Cuprior. Though safety reporting on trientine products seems to have been conducted poorly, the risk of not 
treating Wilson’s disease is evident and outweighs concerns on robustness of historical data. Trientine has been 
used in the paediatric population for decades and there was no indication found to assume a higher risk 
compared to adults. Therefore the use of trientine in the paediatric population as second line treatment in 
patients intolerant to D-penicillamine, which has a worse safety profile than trientine, is generally supported. 
The reference product is approved for the treatment of children and adolescents and applicability of the safety 
profile also for Cuprior is accepted.  
Immunological events 
Information from the submitted literature is rare, the only report found were immunogenicity was investigated 
(Weiss 2013) indicates a good immunogenetic profile of TETA 2HCL as compared to D-penicillamine. However, 
no data for TETA 4HCL is available. Immunogenicity assessment was not performed in the TRIUMPH study. 
Trientine is not a noted allergen or an immunosuppressant so treatment related immunological effects are not 
expected.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The proposed TETA 4HCl scored tablet should be swallowed whole with water and it is important that it is taken 
on an empty stomach, preferably 30 minutes to one hour before meals. This permits maximum absorption and 
reduces the likelihood of inactivation of the drug by metal binding in the gastrointestinal tract (AGEPS 1995).  
Trientine chelates iron and has been found to reduce serum iron levels, possibly by reducing its absorption; iron 
deficiency is a recognised side effect of trientine treatment, hence iron supplements may be required. Since iron 
and trientine may inhibit absorption of each other, iron supplements should be taken only once at least two 
hours have elapsed from the administration of TETA 4HCl. As patients treated with trientine may develop 
symptoms of iron deficiency, patients (especially women) should be monitored for evidence of iron deficiency 
anaemia.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 49/60 
  
  
 
Trientine has also been shown to chelate zinc in vitro (Kodama, Murata et al. 1997) and to increase zinc 
excretion in the urine of patients (Lu, Chan et al. 2007). Therefore an interaction with zinc, particularly if given 
at the same time, cannot be excluded. Possible interaction with zinc is of interest as Zn is another common 
therapy option for patients with WD. Zinc salts decrease intestinal absorption of copper and induce cellular 
metallothioneins. A respective warning on possible interactions was added in the PI. Though both treatments are 
usually recommended as monotherapy, a combination in clinical practice might occur and combined treatment 
regimens are reported in the literature (Brewer 2006, Kalita 2014, Arnon 2007, Kleine 2012, Ala 2005). 
In general mineral supplements should not be given together with trientine. Although there is no evidence that 
calcium or magnesium antacids alter the efficacy of trientine, it is good practice to separate their administration, 
as stated in the SmPC. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Lariboisière study more discontinuations due to AEs were seen in TETA 2HCL patients compared to TETA 
4HCl patients, probably because treatment sequences were longer and more patients were included. The AEs 
causing discontinuation were not considered related to treatment. 
The literature studies on the use of TETA 2HCl in patients with WD report few discontinuation due to AEs. In 
Weiss, Thurik et al. 2013, gastric complaints (nausea, gastric pain) led to discontinuation in 2 patients (1.4%) 
and arthralgia in 4 patients (2.8%). In addition one patient (0.7%) each discontinued TETA 2HCl treatment due 
to pruritus, myalgia, nephropathy, leucopoenia, increase of ANA antibodies, erythema, lupus erythematosus 
and  hirsutism,  although  in  some  cases  these  events  were  a  recurrence  of  events  seen  with  previous 
D-penicillamine treatment. In Mercier- Jacquier, et al 2011, trientine was discontinued in 1 of 6 patients due to 
sideroblatic anaemia. In the Taylor, Chen et al. 2009 paediatric study, TETA 2HCl treatment was discontinued in 
3 of 16 children due to allergic rash, low copper excretion and compliance problems requiring transplantation. 
TRIUMPH study 
No discontinuation from the trial due to AEs was reported. 
2.4.9.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.10.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Clinical benefit is predominantly based on the PK bridging to the reference product and historical data with 
trientine in the TETA 2HCL form. 
TETA 4HCL was administered to a cohort of patients in a retrospective survey from one French WD reference 
centre (the Lariboisière survey); the formulation used (TETA 4HCL capsules) was not identical to the 
composition of Cuprior.  
13 sequences of TETA 4HCl and 44 sequences of TETA 2HCl treatment were observed. The overall amount of 
subjects, especially in the TETA 4HCL “alone” group, is considered small. However, patients were followed for 
long periods; thus, the patient year exposure is more extensive. Only two patients received exclusively TETA 
4HCL, therefore, also taking into account the high inter- and intra-subject variability for trientine, specific 
characteristics of TETA 4HCL might not be sufficiently evaluable from this very small sample. In the open label 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 50/60 
  
  
 
situation also the potential for bias exists, in particular related to operational bias (e.g. influence on trial 
conduct/differential follow up of patients) and biased safety/tolerability assessment on the subject's as well as 
on the investigator's side. 
No detailed information on dose titration patterns, allocation to treatment and triggers for laboratory 
assessment are available. No documents describe plans for reporting and analyses of the retrospectively 
collected data were provided and reporting on efficacy parameters is fragmentary (evaluation was only 
performed at the beginning and the end of a treatment sequence). Reported biological parameters are very 
limited, laboratory analyses were available only for a subset of patients. The nature of concomitant medication 
is unknown, the diagnosis of Wilson’s disease does not seem to have been done on the basis of standardised 
methods and estimates for efficacy and safety variables may not be representative of the entire WD patient 
population.  
Dissolution tests between a TETA 4HCL formulation corresponding to the historical TETA 4HCl formulation used 
at the Lariboisière’s site and Cuprior provided comparable dissolution rates in vitro (conducted at pH 1.2 only). 
Bioequivalence between both products has, however, not been established and differences in excipients could 
be relevant for in vivo performance.  
No notable differences in efficacy and safety were detected when comparing TETA 4HCl and TETA 2HCl 
treatment sequences for changes in hepatic or neurological symptoms, biological markers such as serum and 
urine copper or Kayser Fleischer rings. Subgroup analyses did not show meaningful differences in first or second 
line treatment of trientine, by initial presenting symptom, or when assessing only initial exposure to trientine.  
However, the results are to be interpreted in the view of the multiple limitations as outlined above. It should 
furthermore be noted that any interpretation of non-significant test results as conclusion of 'no difference' 
between treatments cannot be drawn in a statistical sense. 
Overall the level of evidence is low and the study is considered of minor relevance due to deficiencies in trial 
design and as the formulation used (TETA 4HCL capsules) was not identical to the composition of Cuprior. Still, 
taking into consideration that no WD patient had been treated with Cuprior in the course of the clinical 
development it provides some additional assurance on clinical safety and efficacy for TETA-4HCL. 
Trrientine in clinical practice has a well-established safety profile and the bridging to the reference product which 
contains the same active moiety is based on pharmacokinetic evaluation. There is an adequate amount of 
literature and historical data on the use of trientine in WD patients as the originator is marketed for more than 
30 years. Its tolerability is widely recognised. Though the patients are often poorly documented, the exposure 
periods are very long. Severe TEAEs are hardly reported.  
The following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are included in the SmPC of the reference product for WD. The 
frequency of reporting of these events is not known and cannot be estimated from the available data: nausea on 
initial treatment, skin rash, duodenitis, severe colitis, anaemia. Due to the rarity of the disease an estimate of 
frequency of the ADRs is difficult to establish. The ability to detect ADRs (i.e. which are rare, which have a long 
latency, due to prolonged latency, due to cumulative effects) in the Lariboisière retrospective study has been 
limited as only 43 patients (TETA 4HCl=2, TETA 2HCl= 31, both=10) were exposed to trientine in the study. The 
data on unwanted events are not capable of being categorised as non-serious or serious in the regulatory sense. 
A conclusion on the comparability of tolerability of TETA 4HCl from the Lariboisière study with data from the 
literature and Univar’s SmPC cannot be drawn as no reasonable safety reporting was done for the Lariboisière 
study. The proposed SmPC Section 4.8 is based on that of the reference product, however, in depth assessment 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 51/60 
  
  
of AE reporting in the literature lead to an update of this section for Cuprior. Pruritus, erythema and urticarial 
were included in the tabulated list of AEs and complemented by frequency, whenever possible.   
The Lariboisière report shows no reasonable standard of safety reporting, no TEAEs were reported at all and 
none of the few AEs reported was considered related to treatment. No patient record files are available for 
in-depth assessment. Furthermore the formulation of TETA 4HCL used in this study considerably differs from the 
formulation of Cuprior, using different excipients and pharmaceutical form. The evidence level is considered 
comparable to the literature data. In the submitted literature the composition of the products used is often 
unknown (excipients), sometimes the trientine salt is not specified. However, TETA 2HCL seem to be the 
prevailing product used. However, once  trientine  base  is  in  the  systemic  circulation,  there  is  no  rationale  to 
expect  a  difference between trientine salts in the way trientine is distributed, metabolised or excreted as the 
absorbed parent compound and active moiety, trientine base, is identical.  
The summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Trientine together with the Lariboisière report and 
justification was considered by the CHMP sufficient evidence that the different salt of the active substance does 
not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference product and no additional 
clinical  studies  were  considered  necessary.  For  impact  of  difference  in  formulation  please  refer  to 
pharmacological part of this assessment and Benefit / Risk section further below. 
2.4.11.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
No  new  data  with  Cuprior  in  the  treatment  of  Wilson’s  disease  have  been  generated  for  this  MAA.  Overall, 
historical data support a good safety profile of trientine in patients with Wilson’s disease. The Lariboisière study 
provides some supportive evidence on safety and efficacy of TETA 4HCL even though in a different formulation. 
Taking into consideration that both salts share the same active moiety the summary of the literature with regard 
to clinical data of Trientine together with the Lariboisière report was considered by the CHMP sufficient evidence 
that the different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and 
efficacy  of  the  reference  product  and  no  additional  clinical  studies  were  considered  necessary.  The 
demonstration of efficacy and safety therefore relies on bridging to the established efficacy and safety of the 
reference product based on the two pharmacokinetic studies TRIUMPH and TRIUMPH-2. Relevant chapters of the 
SmPC have been updated based on literature provided to reflect up to date clinical knowledge.

Conclusion

Discussion on safety specification 
Trientine is a well-established treatment for WD in all patient populations (Roberts and Schilsky 2008). The 
available information in the literature covers a broad spectrum of patients reflective of the use of trientine in the 
clinical setting. This includes paediatric and elderly patients, as well as patients from many geographic regions. 
The retrospective Lariboisière Survey included patients diagnosed with WD representative of the wider WD 
patient population, although the non-inclusion of patients receiving trientine with concurrent zinc therapy may 
have excluded patients with more severe disease. The 43 patients included in the analysis, included 11 
paediatric patients, of whom three were less than 12 years old. The small number of published reports of 
pregnancies in patients treated with trientine indicates that trientine continues to be effective during pregnancy. 
Since its first use in 1969, a number of case reports and cohort studies of WD patients treated with TETA 2HCl 
have been published. TETA 2HCl 300 mg capsules have been approved in the UK for the treatment of WD in 
patients intolerant to D-Penicillamine since 1985 and are still marketed. Therefore, there is already an extensive 
use of trientine for the treatment of WD and extensive exposure to the active substance. The number of patients 
reported to be exposed to trientine (mainly TETA 2HCl) in the literature exceeds 300 patients who were treated 
for WD.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns trientine tetrahydrochloride tablets (TETA 4HCL) submitted as a hybrid to the 
reference product Univar’s trientine dihydrochloride (TETA 2HCl) capsules indicated for the treatment of 
Wilson’s Disease in patients intolerant to D-penicillamine. The active moiety of Cuprior, trientine, is known to 
reliably decrease serum copper levels in patients with Wilson’s disease. Trientine been in therapeutic use for 
more than 30 years is recommended in published treatment guidelines mainly as a second line treatment to 
D-penicillamine. 
To date, only one nationally registered trientine preparation (UK, Univar’s TETA 2HCL, the reference product in 
this MAA) is available in the European community. 
Cuprior contains trientine in a new formulation, a TETA 4HCL salt, stable at room temperature and therefore not 
requiring refrigerated storage (unlike the reference product).  
Non-clinical studies and testing have been provided for this application, mostly based on published literature, 
and are considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application contains new data on the 
pharmacokinetics as well as on the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview 
on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
To bridge between the reference product Univar’s Trientine dihydrochloride and Cuprior two phase I single dose 
studies TRIUMPH and TRIUMPH-2 in healthy subjects were submitted to evaluate the PK parameters. The 
TRIUMPH study compared Cuprior to the EU reference product and forms the pivotal basis of this application. 
The TRIUMPH-2 study contributed supportive evidence on the dose linearity of the product. 
A third study “the Lariboisière study” was a commissioned review of the use of monotherapy of trientine 
tetrahydrochloride and trientine dihydrochloride in a single centre in Paris. This study is considered of minor 
relevance due to deficiencies in trial design and as the formulation used (TETA 4HCL capsules) was not identical 
to the composition of Cuprior. Still, taking into consideration that no WD patient had been treated with Cuprior 
in the course of the clinical development it provides some additional assurance on clinical safety and efficacy for 
TETA-4HCL. 
TRIUMPH was a single dose (600mg trientine base), randomised, open-label, two-way cross over PK study in 
healthy volunteers (n=26). The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the relative bioavailability of 
both formulations and was in line with the respective European requirements. The analytical method was 
validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The study demonstrated higher bioavailability of Cuprior than the EU reference product, Univar (TETA 2HCL). 
The geometric mean ratios of the trientine plasma levels for two formulations (TETA 4HCl/TETA 2HCl) were 
168%, 157% and 156%, for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf, respectively. Based on the higher bioavailability of 
Cuprior which appear to be due to  differences in dissolution (as evaluated in vitro) the applicant proposed a 
dose adjustment factor assuming that approximately 60% of TETA 4HCl relative to TETA 2HCl needs to be 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 57/60 
  
  
administered to provide the same trientine base exposure.  
TRIUMPH-2 was a randomised four-way crossover study (showing bioequivalence to the US licensed Syprine). 
Cuprior was administered as single doses of 3 tablets and 5 tablets (150 mg trientine base per tablet) total 450 
mg and 750 mg.  
The single dose PK data for three different doses of Cuprior support dose linearity across the dosage range 
expected to be used in the treatment of Wilson’s Disease supporting that a dose conversion factor between 
Cuprior and the EU reference can be established and applied. Also further literature was provided supporting 
that the intestinal absorption (Cmax and AUC) of trientine dihydrochloride and tertahydrochloride salts increase 
in a dose linear manner (Cho et al, 2009) and it would be unreasonable to assume that Cuprior differs in some 
way to other TETA 2HCL salts.  
The individualisation of dosing with regular monitoring of copper levels once Cuprior therapy is initiated and 
subsequent adjustment of dose, as necessary, also ensure the dosing of Cuprior is in accordance with individual 
patients’ requirements. Such an individual ‘treat to target’ approach is required in the management of Wilson’s 
disease, regardless of trientine formulation, in view of the high intra- and inter-subject variability for trientine 
absorption and the variability and evolution in the clinical presentation. 
The systemic action of trientine has been shown in many investigations, where it has proven to significantly 
increase urinary copper excretion. Due to this quality it is authorised and used since decades in WD. Clinical 
management of WD patients focusses on controlling the systemic levels of copper (in blood and excreted in the 
urine). Whereas a precise quantification of the contribution of intestinal luminal chelation to the efficacy of 
trientine is not possible the contribution of intestinal luminal chelation to the efficacy of trientine is considered 
limited. Also taking into consideration that the product  is titrated to target as outlined in the SmPC potential 
differences in in food effect/ food interaction between Cuprior and the RMP (due to Cuprior´s faster absorption) 
would be of small impact and no further difference in efficacy or safety due to the dual mechanism of action of 
trientine is expected.  
The  food  effect  of  Cuprior  as  compared  with  the  reference  product  has  not  been  studied.  For  the  reference 
product, the food effect is believed to play a role in clinical practice, considering the rather slow absorption of 
active  moiety  from  the  gut  (Tmax  3  hours)  and  the  relatively  conservative  PI  recommendations.  Intake  of 
Univar’s  trientine  within  30  min  to  1h  before  food  could  result  in  a  limited  absorption  and  limited  systemic 
exposure compared to Cuprior, where dissolution and absorption occur more quickly (Tmax 2 hours). Although 
the difference might even be enhanced by the “stricter” food recommendation proposed for Cuprior compared to 
the  reference  product,  on  the  other  hand  this  would  lead  to  a  more  predictable  and  consistent  systemic 
exposure. However, the product is titrated to target and individual variations are expected to be high and may 
have  a  larger  impact  on  the  systemic  level  of  the  drug.  Therefore  small  differences  in  food  effect  between 
products are not being considered of clinical relevance. Relevant uncertainties such as the lack of a food effect 
study are appropriately outlined in 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Trientine may initially elevate serum copper levels, particularly during the start of treatment during the 
‘de-coppering phase’ excess copper being released from tissues into the blood could cause or aggravate 
neurological or hepatic symptoms which, theoretically, might be more pronounced with the more rapidly 
bioavailable trientine formulation. Precautionary statements in the SmPC, when initiating treatment with 
Cuprior outline that the lowest dose in the dosing range should be administered and that patients receiving 
Cuprior should remain under regular medical supervision and be monitored for appropriate control of symptoms 
and copper levels in order to optimise the dose. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/308946/2017 
Page 58/60 
  
  
Furthermore the starting dose in paediatrics is lower than for adults and depends on age and body weight which 
is acceptable. Also, as trientine is titrated to target and Cuprior is actually not intended as first line treatment for 
initial de-coppering, a possible overestimation of the starting dose (resulting in an underexposure, lower limit of 
AUC range 80.94%) is not considered to have large relevant impact on the patient’s clinical status.  
Children are included into the label of the reference product however it is agreed with the applicant that the 
tablet formulation is not appropriate for the use in children <5 years of age (EMEA/CHMP/PEG/194810/2005) as 
outlined in the SmPC. 
In summary the bridge to the reference product, Univar´s TETA 2HCL, relies on PK data, which show higher 
bioavailability of Cuprior by approx. 60%. This is addressed by dose adjustment. The proposed (reduced) dose 
was never tested clinically but taking into consideration that dose linearity has been shown to a sufficient extent 
and as clinical use is based on monitoring and titration the impact of inter-formulation differences on efficacy 
and safety can be considered sufficiently addressed by routine risk minimisation measures. 
A positive benefit/risk ratio can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
3.1.  Conclusions

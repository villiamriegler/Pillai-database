has submitted an Addendum to Clinical Overview (ACO) to 
provide details of the efficacy and safety of Clopidogrel 
Krka d.d. since its approval. In the CHMP’s view the 
provided data do not change the overall knowledge about 
the beneficial effect and safety profile of clopidogrel when 
used in the approved indications. 
The beneficial effect of Clopidogrel Krka d.d. remains in line 
with that of the originator product (Plavix), and is 
considered positive.

include new information on the variability of response to 
clopidogrel due to either genetic variations of the CYP2C19 
enzyme or concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the 
CYP2C19 enzyme such as proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In 
addition, section 4.8 has been amended with minor details 
on the CURE study. 
Additional changes have been added to the SPC and 
Package Leaflet in order to bring it in line with the revised 
QRD template (version 7.3). Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly. 
Furthermore indications have been added in the SPC as 
only one indication was available at date of authorizations 
due to patent reasons. Now the full indications as for the 
reference product are being added. No new data is 
submitted as the SPC of the reference product (Plavix) is 
being followed. Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly.

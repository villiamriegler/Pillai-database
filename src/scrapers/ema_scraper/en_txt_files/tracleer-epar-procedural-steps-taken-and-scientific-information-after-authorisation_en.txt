using the 32 mg dispersible tablet formulation. Following 
treatment with the dispersible tablet, exposure to bosentan

the results of study AC-052-211, an exploratory safety 
study conducted in patients with COPD. (FUM 56.2) 
Tracleer is not indicated in patients with pulmonary 
hypertension secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), however a warning statement is 
introduced as follows: 
Safety and tolerability of bosentan was investigated in an 
exploratory, uncontrolled 12-week study in 11 patients with 
pulmonary 
hypertension secondary to severe COPD (stage III of Gold 
classification). An increase in minute ventilation and a 
decrease in 
oxygen saturation were observed and the most frequent 
adverse event was dyspnea, which resolved with 
discontinuation of bosentan.” 
In addition, minor linguistic changes to the PI are 
introduced for 4 languages (Bulgaria, Slovenia, Hungary 
and Poland).

concentrations of bosentan that were approximately 48-fold 
higher than those measured after Tracleer administered 
alone. On day 9, plasma concentrations of bosentan were 
approximately 5-fold higher than with Tracleer 
administered alone. Inhibition by ritonavir of transport 
protein mediated uptake into hepatocytes and of CYP3A4, 
thereby reducing the clearance of bosentan, most likely 
causes this interaction. When administered concomitantly 
with lopinavir+ritonavir or other ritonavir-boosted protease 
inhibitors, the patient's tolerability of Tracleer should be 
closely monitored with special attention, at the beginning of 
the initiation phase, to the risk of hypotension and to liver 
function tests. An increased long-term risk of hepatic 
toxicity and haematological adverse events cannot be 
excluded when bosentan is used in combination with 
antiretroviral medicinal products. 
After co-administration of Tracleer for 9.5 days, the plasma 
exposures to lopinavir and ritonavir decreased to a clinically 
non significant extent (by approximately 14% and 17%, 
respectively). However, full induction by bosentan might 
not have been reached and further decrease of protease 
inhibitors cannot be excluded. Appropriate monitoring of 
the HIV therapy is recommended. Similar effects would be 
expected with other ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors. 
No specific recommendation can be made with regard to 
co-administration with other available antiretroviral agents 
due to the lack of data. It is emphasized that due to a 
marked hepatotoxicity of nevirapine that could cumulate 
with bosentan liver toxicity, this combination is not

literature and post-marketing experience, the CHMP 
considered that the information on posology in paediatric 
PAH patients in section 4.2 was to be updated as follows: 
"For paediatric patients aged 2 years or older, the optimal 
maintenance dose has not been defined in well-controlled 
studies. However, pediatric pharmacokinetic data have 
shown that bosentan plasma concentrations in children 
were on average lower than in adult patients and were not 
increased by increasing the dose of Tracleer above 2 mg/kg 
twice daily (see section 5.2). Based on these  
pharmacokinetic results, higher doses are unlikely to be 
more effective, and greater adverse event rates cannot 
formally be excluded in young children if the dose is 
increased. No clinical study has been conducted to compare 
the efficacy/safety ratio of 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg twice daily 
in children. 
There is only limited clinical experience in paediatric 
Page 18/26

The CHMP also agreed to update sections 4.8 and 5.2 
further to the results of these studies.

pregnancy, the MAH applied for a type II Variation to 
amend sections 4.4 (Special warnings and special 
precautions for use), 4.5 (Interaction with other medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction) and 4.6 
(Pregnancy and lactation) of the SPC. The patient reminder 
card and package leaflet have been updated accordingly. 
One of the main safety concerns with Tracleer is related to 
the potential teratogenicity that was identified during its 
preclinical development. Tracleer is contraindicated during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential who are 
not using reliable methods of contraception. Furthermore, 
due to the induction potential of bosentan on CYP 
isoenzymes, it has been anticipated that Tracleer may 
render hormonal contraceptives ineffective.  
A total of 57 pregnancies have been reported since Tracleer 
was introduced on the market, including 53 following a 
maternal exposure (0.5% of female patients of childbearing 
potential exposed to bosentan). More than half of cases of 
maternal exposure were reported with "no information on 
birth control", “no birth control” or “inadequate birth 
control (only hormonal contraception)”. Therefore, it was 
considered that the information to patients and prescribers 
about bosentan and pregnancy should be improved. 
In sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC, the information on the 
use in women with childbearing potential was reinforce to 
highlight the risk of hormonal contraceptive failure due to 
the pharmacokinetic interaction with Tracleer and the need 
to use appropriate additional or alternative method of

Cases of pulmonary oedema have been reported with 
vasodilatators (mainly prostacyclin) when used in patients 
with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. 
Consequently, should signs of pulmonary oedema occur 
when Tracleer is administered in patients with PAH, the 
possibility of associated veno-occlusive disease should be 
considered. In the post-marketing period there have been 
rare reports of pulmonary oedema in patients treated with 
Tracleer who had a suspected diagnosis of pulmonary veno-
occlusive disease.

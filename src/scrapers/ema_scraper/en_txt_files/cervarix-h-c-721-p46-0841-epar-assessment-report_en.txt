1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH:  
Extension study of the primary vaccination study, study HPV-013 and subsequent follow-up study Ext 
HPV-013 designed to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity and safety of the HPV-16/18 VLP L1 
AS04 vaccine in pre-teen and adolescent females aged 10 to 14 years at the time of first vaccination, 
for a period of approximately 10 years after first HPV vaccination in the primary study (study HPV-
013). The current report presents the results of the interim analysis up to Month 96 (Year 8).

2.  Assessment of the post-authorisation measure PAM 
This extension study of the primary vaccination study, study HPV-013 and subsequent follow-up study 
Ext HPV-013 was designed to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity and safety of the HPV-16/18 VLP 
L1 AS04 vaccine in pre-teen and adolescent females aged 10 to 14 years at the time of first 
vaccination, for a period of approximately 10 years (120 months) after first HPV vaccination in the 
primary study (study HPV- 013). The current report presents the results of the interim analysis up to 
Month 96 (Year 8). No confirmatory analyses were performed on the primary or secondary objectives. 
At Month 96, all subjects were still seropositive for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies. In the ATP 
cohort, in subjects who were initially seronegative, GMTs at Month 96 were 1653.1 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 
1528.2– 1788.2] for HPV-16 and 667.2 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 612.0 – 727.5] for HPV-18. 
With respect to the Month  84 interim report 7 years after administration of the HPV-16/18 vaccine 
(i.e. at Month 84), in initially seronegative subjects, GMTs at Month 84 were 1747.9 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 
1610.1 – 1897.5] for HPV-16 and 597.0 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 547.0 – 651.5] for HPV-18. The MAH 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/308690/2015

should discuss this latter result as the GMTs at Month 84 is higher than the ones at Month 96 for HPV 
18. 
The HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody titers in ATP baseline seronegative subjects were 3.8 and 2.7 fold 
higher, respectively, than the titers observed at an equivalent timepoint (i.e. Month 95 – Month 100 
time interval) in female subjects aged 15-25 years at the time of enrolment in the HPV-001/007/023 
study. 
The HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody titers in ATP baseline seronegative subjects were 55.47 and 29.39 
fold higher, respectively, than those associated with natural infection found in subjects aged 15-25 
years at the time of vaccination in study HPV-008. 
At  month  84  in  the  HPV-025  EXT-013  long-term  follow-up  study,  the  primary  analysis  of  safety  was 
based on Month 84 Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC) for data collected during the follow-up period Month 
72 to Month 84 (N=523). In addition, an analysis on the same Month 84 TVC was performed on data 
collected during the entire HPV-013-Ext HPV-013 and HPV-025 study period (Month 0 to Month 84). A 
further analysis was performed on the whole HPV-013-Ext HPV-013-HPV-025 TVC (N=1035). 
As  requested  by  the  Rapporteur  in  the  AR  of  the  EMEA-H-C-721-P46  065.1  PAM,  a  safety  analysis  in 
subjects  who  were  selected  for  HPV-025  was  performed.  Total  Vaccinated  Cohort  (TVC)  for  HPV-025 
was defined as subjects who were invited for HPV-025 study with the following criteria:  
-  Subjects who received three doses of HPV vaccine in primary study HPV-013 
-  Subjects who were included in the immunogenicity subset of study HPV-013 
-  Subjects  who  were  part  of  one  of  the  extensions  of  HPV-013,  i.e.  Ext  HPV-013  (Month  12  to 
Month 48)  
The  number  of  subjects  included  in  TVC  of  HPV-025  is  611  (included  for  Month  0-  Month  96).  The 
Company will perform a similar analysis in subsequent reports for HPV-025 EXT-013 (Months 108 and 
120). During the study period Month 0 to Month 96, a total of 81 subjects (13.3%) reported 120 SAEs 
in  the  TVC  of  HPV-025.  None  of  the  events  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to 
vaccination. The most commonly reported SAEs classified by MedDRA Preferred Term were appendicitis 
(nine  subjects  [1.5%]),  incomplete  spontaneous  abortion  (8  subjects  [1.3%])  and  abdominal  pain 
(four subjects [0.7%]) (Table 1).  
No fatal SAEs were reported during the follow-up period from Month 84 to Month 96. Fatal SAEs were 
reported  for  two  subjects  for  the  whole  period;  none  of  them  were  considered  to  be  related  to 
vaccination.  
During the follow-up period from Month 84 to Month 96, 8 subjects reported 11 SAEs, none of which 
were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. For comparison, during the 
follow-up period from Month 72 to Month 84, 20 subjects reported 24 SAEs, none of which were 
considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. There were no withdrawals from 
this study due to AEs or SAEs this far. 
In conclusion, the results from this interim analysis confirm the sustained immunogenicity of the HPV-
16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine up to 96 months after administration of the first dose in subjects aged 10 - 
14 years at the time of first vaccination both in terms of anti-HPV-16/18 GMTs and seropositivity and 
with an acceptable safety profile.

3.  Request for Supplementary Information  
At Month 96, all subjects were still seropositive for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies. In the ATP 
cohort, in subjects who were initially seronegative, GMTs at Month 96 were 1653.1 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 
1528.2– 1788.2] for HPV-16 and 667.2 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 612.0 – 727.5] for HPV-18. 
With respect to the Month  84 interim report 7 years after administration of the HPV-16/18 vaccine 
(i.e. at Month 84), in initially seronegative subjects, GMTs at Month 84 were 1747.9 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 
1610.1 – 1897.5] for HPV-16 and 597.0 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 547.0 – 651.5] for HPV-18. The MAH 
should discuss this latter result as the GMTs at Month 84 is lower than the one at Month 96 for HPV 18. 
Applicant Response: 
The Company reviewed QC chart and QC panel data for HPV-18 ELISA. The QC chart did not show any 
drift during the testing period. The QC panel data showed a small increase of around 10% from July 
2011 till October 2013 (M84 serum samples were tested in 2011-2012 and M96 serum samples were 
tested in 2013). This increase was within the acceptable range of variability for the HPV-18 ELISA, i.e. 
<20% (The acceptance criteria for the GMT ratio on a QC panel tested every 6 months is [0.8-1.25]). 
No stability alert was observed based on the review of the QC chart and QC panel data from the period 
of HPV-18 ELISA testing of both time points.  
The HPV-18 GMT at M96 from the M96 ATP cohort (667.2 EL.U/mL, 95% CI: 612.0 – 727.5) seemed to 
be slightly higher than the GMT at M84 from the M84 ATP cohort (597.0 EL.U/mL, 95% CI: 547.0 –

651.5). However, the Company noticed the overlapping of the 95% CIs of the two time-points. The 
observed difference in HPV-18 GMTs between M96 and M84, calculated as GMT ratio 1.11 (95% CI: 
0.98, 1.26, P=0.09) was within the acceptable variability for the HPV-18 ELISA. 
Discussion 
The Issue is resolved. The MAH’s overall conclusions are endorsed and no further actions are required. 
Please note that the Article 46 for the study HPV-025 Ext-013 Month 108 for Cervarix has been 
submitted on 29 January 2015 (eCTD sequence 0189). 
4.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
The MAH Discussion is generally endorsed. The results of this annual update report were in agreement 
with previous annual reports. The results are in line with expectations. The MAH’s overall conclusions 
are endorsed and no further actions are required for this PAM at Month 96. No further regulatory action 
is considered necessary based on these results. The final results of this study are expected at month 
120. A complete safety profile of this long term follow up is expected at the end of the study including 
all subjects from the TVC that were originally selected for inclusion  in HPV025 EXT-13.

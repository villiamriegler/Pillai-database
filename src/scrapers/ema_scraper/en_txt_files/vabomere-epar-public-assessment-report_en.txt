2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Vabomere is proposed by the applicant to be indicated for the treatment of the following infections in 
adults: 
• Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including pyelonephritis  
• Complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) 
• Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) 
Treatment of patients with bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be 
associated with, any of the infections listed above. 
Vabomere is also indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in 
adults with limited treatment options. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The types of infections to be treated are commonplace, except for those due to organisms that are 
resistant to multiple classes of antibacterial agents, which are discussed below. Acute pyelonephritis 
may result from an ascending uncontrolled bladder infection or may be haematogenous, while 
complicated UTIs are usually associated with anatomical abnormalities or foreign bodies placed in the 
tract, such as catheters and renal stents. Complicated IAIs are common infections encountered in 
general surgery and have been estimated to be responsible for 20% of all severe sepsis episodes in the 
intensive care unit. Overall mortality rates in cIAIs remain as high as 25%, with subjects who develop 
tertiary peritonitis experiencing even higher rates. HAP/VAP is a major resource-consuming problem 
especially associated with patients who have had a complication of an underlying illness or medical 
intervention. Mortality rates are commonly at least 20%. In each case the severity of the underlying 
disease and inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, due in part to increased antimicrobial resistance, 
significantly contribute to the mortality rates.   
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) constitutes a heterogeneous clinical entity that includes UTI 
in the presence of factors that predispose to persistent or relapsing infection, such as indwelling 
catheters, urinary obstruction, instrumentation of the urinary tract, or other functional or anatomical 
abnormalities of the urogenital tract, and may occur in the lower or upper urinary tract. Pyelonephritis, 
a subset of cUTI, is an infection of one or both kidneys that can occur in patients with or without 
functional or anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract. Complicated UTIs are a frequent cause of 
hospitalisation and a common health-care associated complication. Gram-negative organisms account 
for approximately 60% to 80% of complicated and nosocomial UTIs. The most common uropathogens 
are E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp.  
Intra-abdominal infections include a wide spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from 
uncomplicated appendicitis to faecal peritonitis. In complicated IAI (cIAI) the infection progresses 
beyond a singularly affected organ and causes either localised peritonitis (intra-abdominal abscesses) 
or diffuse peritonitis. This peritoneal contamination may result from spontaneous perforation (e.g. 
appendicitis, perforated ulcer or diverticulitis), surgical intervention or trauma. Pathogens most 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 10/108 
 
  
commonly encountered in cIAI are Escherichia coli, other common Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis.  
HAP and VAP occur in hospitalised patients. A hospital stay of 48 hours or more will place patients at 
risk for colonisation and potential infection of the respiratory tract with a variety of Gram-positive and 
Gram-negative bacteria. Examples of pathogens of hospital acquired bacterial pneumonia/ventilator 
acquired bacterial pneumonia include Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Gram-
negative aerobic non-fermenters such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The types of infections listed in the proposed indications are diagnosed based on clinical presentations, 
which are described in CHMP guidance on the development of antibacterial medicinal products, and on 
microbiological investigations to isolate and characterise ± quantify (in case of UTI) the pathogens.  
2.1.5.  Management 
There are many guidelines available regarding recommendations for the treatment of the types of 
infections listed in the proposed indications. The selection of antibacterial agent(s) for the individual 
patient is also guided by the results of pathogen identification and susceptibility testing. 
Successful treatment of cUTIs has become increasingly more challenging because of rising rates of 
antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens. Indeed, the majority of pathogens responsible for 
healthcare-associated cUTIs, including catheter-related infections, are now commonly resistant to 
multiple antimicrobial agents. Effective management of these infections requires a combination of early 
diagnosis, appropriate surgical intervention and empiric, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy.  
Second or third generation cephalosporins in combination with metronidazole, extended-spectrum 
penicillin/beta (β)-lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) and carbapenems are commonly used for the treatment 
of cIAI. However, increasing resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents remains a serious 
global problem. Indeed, susceptibility data from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance 
Trends (SMART) indicate that 18% of E. coli collected worldwide were extended spectrum beta-
lactamase (ESBL)-positive from 2005 to 2007, while the number of ESBL-positive Klebsiella 
pneumoniae significantly increased from 13.3% in 2002 to 30.9% in 2007. In addition, P. aeruginosa 
resistance in cIAI remains a problem.  
Treatment of HAP/VAP commonly involves multiple agents to cover all possibilities, at least until 
culture results are available. However, results are often uninformative even in the cases with very 
clear radiological pneumonias and other signs of active infection. Due to the types of patients in which 
these infections occur and their underlying conditions, as well as the typically multi-resistant nature of 
their pathogens, it is common that at least two antibacterial agents are used unless the susceptibility 
of the organism(s) has been clarified. 
Beta-lactam antibacterial agents are very commonly used to manage the above types of infections 
when they involve Gram-negative pathogens. Increasing resistance to beta-lactams, including the 
carbapenems, has led to some organisms being effectively untreatable or treatable only with resource 
to colistin with or without other agents to which they remain at least partly susceptible. Although 
carbapenem resistance remains at relatively low levels for most EU countries, increasing trends for the 
period 2011 to 2014 were observed for seven EU Member States: Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Germany, 
Italy, Portugal and Spain. As of March 2013, K. pneumoniae carbapenemase was the most widely 
disseminated carbapenemase across the EU. OXA-48 was the most frequently detected carbapenemase 
in Belgium, France and Malta. New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases were responsible for occasional

hospital outbreaks in a few countries, but were not widely disseminated in European countries. In the 
medical literature, mortality rates attributable to CRE infections range from 20% to 54.3%. Thus, there 
is a high unmet medical need for patients with CRE. 
In 2016 Zavicefta (ceftazidime-avibactam), which has activity against some CRE, was approved in 
several countries, including the EU. While laboratory studies showed in vitro activity of Zavicefta 
against many clinical isolates, they also showed selection of mutations in the genes encoding K. 
pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) resulting in resistance. Recent experience published from a single-
centre study demonstrated that these resistance mutations could occur during treatment of patients, 
such that KPC-mediated resistance was detected in 3/10 microbiologic failures. 
About the product 
Vabomere consists of a known beta-lactam agent (the carbapenem meropenem) and a new beta-
lactamase inhibitor (vaborbactam; formerly RPX7009). Meropenem has been licensed and used in the 
EU since the 1990s. It has a spectrum that includes Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic 
bacteria. It is given intravenously at doses up to 2 g q8h. Vaborbactam is a new active substance, 
being a beta-lactamase inhibitor of a new class (cyclic boronates).  
The clinical programme was conducted using individual vials of meropenem (commercially available 
Meropenem for Injection - 1000 mg/vial) and vaborbactam (Vaborbactam for Injection - 500 and 1000 
mg/vial). Two vaborbactam drug product formulations were used - a sterile frozen solution formulation 
and a sterile lyophilised formulation. Meropenem and vaborbactam vials were reconstituted with 0.9% 
saline and were immediately further diluted to a final concentration of 8 mg/ml each in 0.9% saline. 
The product for the market is provided as a sterile powder blend of crystalline meropenem trihydrate, 
crystalline vaborbactam and lyophilised sodium carbonate to assure solubility. It is presented as a 
powder for concentrate for solution for infusion in vials containing 1 g of each active substance.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 1 g meropenem (as 
trihydrate) and 1 g vaborbactam as the active substances. After reconstitution, 1 ml of the solution 
contains 50 mg meropenem and 50 mg vaborbactam.  
The only other ingredient is sodium carbonate as described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The product is available in a 50 ml clear glass vial (Type 1) closed with a rubber (bromobutyl) stopper 
and aluminium overseal with flip-off cap, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Meropenem 
General information 
The chemical name of meropenem is (4R,5S,6S)-3-[[(3S,5S)-5-[(Dimethylamino)carbonyl] 
pyrrolidin-3-yl]sulfanyl]-6-[(1R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-4-methyl-7-oxo-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-ene-2-
carboxylic  acid trihydrate corresponding to the molecular formula C 17H25N3O5S 3H2O. It has a 
relative molecular mass 437.5 g/mol and has the following structure (Figure 1):

Figure 1. Chemical structure of meropenem. 
Meropenem appears as white or light yellow, crystalline powder. It is non hygroscopic and is 
sparingly soluble in water. 
Meropenem is a well-known active substance and it is monographed in the European Pharmacopoeia 
(monograph number 2234).  As there is a monograph of meropenem in the European 
Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active substance has been granted a Certificate of 
Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for meropenem which has been provided within 
the current Marketing Authorisation Application. With regard to meropenem characterisation 
reference is made to the Certificate of Suitability R0-CEP 2011-238-Rev 02.  The molecule has 6 
asymmetric carbon atoms. Only one crystal form of meropenem trihydrate is manufactured by the 
active substance manufacturer. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability 
(R0-CEP 2011-238-Rev 02). No information is provided on the elucidation of the structure, which is 
acceptable in view of the CEP. The absence of materials of animal/human origin is declared. Water 
for injections (WFI) is used in the last synthesis step. 
Meropenem is provided as sterile material and the sterility of the finished product relies upon 
meropenem sterility, as no further sterilisation steps are introduced in the finished product 
manufacture. The sterilisation process and validation of meropenem is identical to that provided to 
the EDQM to support the current CEP. The relevant CEP sections that describe the sterilization 
process and validation, including media fills and acceptable bioburden limits for meropenem 
trihydrate solution before the sterilizing filtration have been provided.  
Specification 
Reference is made to the Certificate of Suitability R0-CEP 2011-238-Rev 02 with regard to 
specification and analytical methods. The specifications are according to the Ph. Eur. monograph 
with additional tests for acetone, palladium and sterility. The control of sterile meropenem 
trihydrate has been evaluated by the EDQM in relation to the Certificate of Suitability for 
meropenem trihydrate R0-CEP 2011-238-Rev 02; this is acknowledged and accepted.  
Stability 
Reference is made to the CEP according to which the re-test period is 2 years if stored in a sterile 
bottle-shape polyethylene bag in a sterile PE bag within a four-layer bag.

Vaborbactam 
General information 
The chemical name of vaborbactam is (3R,6S)-2-hydroxy-3-[[2-(2-thienyl)acetyl]amino]-1,2-
oxaborinane-6-acetic acid corresponding to the molecular formula C12H16BNO5S. It has a relative 
molecular mass 297.14 g/mol and has the structure shown in  
Figure 2.  
Figure 2. Chemical structure of vaborbactam. 
Vaborbactam appears as white to off-white, non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble 
in water and has two ionisable functional groups: a carboxylic acid with pKa=1.9 and a boronic acid 
with pKa=8.2. 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of spectroscopic methods 
(UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, mass spectrometry), elemental analysis, DSC and TGA. Vaborbactam is 
sufficiently characterised and its structure is adequately elucidated. 
Vaborbactam has two asymmetric carbon atoms (3R, 6S). One stereocenter is determined by the 
starting material (REBO-01) in the first step of the synthesis, the second is introduced in step 2 
(REBO-04 intermediate synthesis). The desired and undesired isomers are formed in a ratio of 97:3.  
The controls of the stereocenter in starting material (REBO-01) and in the intermediate (REBO-04) 
minimize stereoisomers.  
It exists in three crystalline forms (polymorphs A, B and C) as well as amorphous material. Form A 
is the anhydrous non-solvated crystalline form that is obtained by the proposed synthesis process 
and Forms B and C are solvates. Powder XRD spectra of several batches have been submitted 
(comparative between previous and current synthesis process) and these indicate that Form A is 
consistently produced. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Vaborbactam is manufactured in five converging main stages. Two starting materials are defined which 
are acceptable and controlled by suitable specifications. The manufacturing process includes 4 isolated 
intermediates  resulting  in  non-sterile  vaborbactam.  A  sixth  step  is  also  described  where  sterile 
substance is obtained by sterile filtration, crystallisation, milling and packaging.  
Vaborbactam is provided as sterile material for the manufacture of the finished product. The validation 
report of the sterilisation process has been provided for the site involved and includes the sterilisation 
step; process simulation data support the proposed process times.  
No steps are defined as critical. The intermediate specifications were provided, have been justified and 
they are overall acceptable.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the relevant ICH 
guidelines. The potential impurities are controlled in the active substance and intermediate 
specifications as well as in the in-process control during the manufacturing of the active substance by 
validated test methods. All in-process intermediates in the synthesis of vaborbactam as well as all 
organic impurities have been subjected to an in silico assessment of genotoxicity potential. The 
impurities’ fate and controls have been discussed and the proposed control strategy ensures adequate 
control of their levels in the active substance. 
The packaging for sterile vaborbactam (RPX7009) utilizes the Sterbag® system. The Sterbag® system 
is composed of three sterile bags. The first one (primary), made of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) 
and bottle-shaped is filled with the sterile product, placed under vacuum, sealed, labelled and placed 
into the secondary rectangular bag, made of high density polyethylene (HDPE). The secondary HDPE 
bag is sealed, placed under vacuum and inserted into a tertiary rectangular bag, made of four foils 
(low-density polyethylene, nylon, aluminium and polyester) joined together. This third bag is also 
sealed and placed under vacuum, so that the system is completely air-tight. 
Specification 
The finished product release specifications  include appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), 
identification (HPLC, IR), assay (HPLC-UV), related substances (HPLC-UV), residual solvents (GC-FID), 
water  content  (Ph.Eur.),  specific  optical  rotation  (Ph.Eur.),  particle  size  (Ph.Eur.),  bulk  density 
(Ph.Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
The  proposed  limits  for  related  substances  have  been  toxicologically  qualified  and  are  therefore 
considered acceptable. It has been justified by batch analysis data and by the manufacturing process 
conditions that there is no need for a test for chiral purity in the vaborbactam substance. Particle size 
distribution and bulk density (untapped and tapped) are tested at release and reported for information 
only. 
The  analytical  methods  used  in  the  control  of  the  active  substance  have  generally  been  satisfactorily 
described  and  validated  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ICH  guidelines.  Information  regarding  the 
reference standards used in the analytical testing is satisfactory. 
Batch  analysis  data  have been  provided  for  three  commercial  scale  batches  and  also three  validation 
batches.  All  results  are  within  proposed  specifications  and  confirm  consistency  of  the  manufacturing 
process from batch to batch.  
Stability 
Stability data on three production and three pilot scale batches of vaborbactam stored in the intended 
commercial packaging for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25°C/60% RH) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH) was provided according to the ICH guidelines.  
The stability batches were tested for appearance, specific optical rotation, water content, assay, 
related substances, sterility and bacterial endotoxins.  The stability indicating capability of the methods 
has been demonstrated by forced degradation studies. All data reported from the accelerated and long 
term studies is within proposed specifications and no trends were seen.  
Supportive stability data to support a re-test period of 36 months have been submitted for 12 batches 
of non-sterile vaborbactam stored at 25°C/60% RH for 18-48 months. The batches all comply with the 
acceptance criteria and no trends are observed.   
Vaborbactam samples have been also exposed to forced degradation conditions. The substance was 
subjected to high temperature, acid, base, oxidation and photostability as per ICH Q1B. No significant 
Assessment report

degradation was observed except for at the oxidative condition depending on treatment time. For all 
other treatments less than 1% total degradation was seen. With regard to photostability results no 
more than 0.3% total degradation was observed suggesting the substance is not photo sensitive.  
Based on the overall stability results the proposed retest period of 36 months in the proposed 
container at 25°C/60% RH is accepted. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile powder for concentrate for solution for infusion filled in single-use 50 
ml Type I clear glass vials with 20mm bromobutyl rubber stoppers and sealed with 20 mm aluminium 
flip-off overcaps. The product is intended for intravenous administration after reconstitution and 
further dilution with 0.9% sodium chloride injection prior to use. There is a 3% overfill per vial to allow 
for delivery of the labelled content.  
Meropenem chemical instability is well documented in the literature and its degradation takes place 
under various thermal, alkaline and acidic conditions, as well as in the presence of weak nucleophiles 
(like water) and/or metal ions. It contains an unstable, highly strained and reactive β-lactam amide 
bond. In aqueous solution, opening of the β-lactam ring by water forms Impurity A, whereas opening 
of the ring by a second molecule of meropenem forms Impurity B. Therefore, the product is developed 
as a sterile crystalline powder blend formulation to maximize stability.  Vaborbactam is chemically 
stable in heat, acid, base and photolytic conditions, and is less stable to oxidative degradation. 
Both active substances are used in their free acid form and need a counter ion in order to solubilise 
properly upon reconstitution. Sodium carbonate has been chosen for this purpose. It is also used for 
pH control. The sodium carbonate is crystalline and sterile and it complies with compendial 
requirements, e.g. Ph Eur. Nitrogen (Ph. Eur.) is used as process aid as an inert gas.  
The information for the batches used in the clinical trials has been summarised and provided in the 
application. 
Following interaction with regulatory agencies a strong preference for a single vial presentation 
containing both meropenem and vaborbactam in the same vial was expressed. Thus, the single vial 
presentation was developed. A lyophilized combination was not considered a viable option. Therefore, 
the product formulation has been developed to be manufactured as a sterile, crystalline powder blend.  
Both meropenem and vaborbactam can be aseptically processed and isolated as sterile crystalline 
solids. The commercially available meropenem for injection is a sterile, crystalline powder blend with 
lyophilised sodium carbonate, having long-term stability in this format. Addition of vaborbactam to this 
formulation was considered a low risk approach to the development of a combination medicinal 
product.  
The relevant physicochemical properties of the active substances and the excipient sodium carbonate 
have been addressed during development. The amount of sodium carbonate in the blend and its water 
content were also investigated.  
As mentioned previously only one crystal form of meropenem trihydrate and vaborbactam (Form A) 
have been evaluated during development as only one form of each is manufactured at the commercial 
site. two different manufacturing methods were tested. Slightly better blend uniformity was achieved 
with lyophilised material (lab scale) and this manufacturing process was therefore chosen. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 16/108 
 
  
The components of the product are blended during manufacture and factors that may impact blend 
uniformity have been investigated. Given the limited batch experience with Vabomere manufacturing , 
the CHMP recommended that specifications for those parameters affecting blend uniformity, the 
specifications will be set after additional batches (n=6) have been produced and evaluated (see 
recommendations). 
Given the known instability of meropenem in aqueous solution, hygroscopicity studies by dynamic 
vapour sorption have been performed in the components and the bulk blend. The results show that 
meropenem trihydrate and vaborbactam are not hygroscopic, but sodium carbonate is highly 
hygroscopic. The bulk blend was found to be hygroscopic, mainly due to the presence of sodium 
carbonate. The water content of sodium carbonate is limited at NMT 0.5% and this has proven 
sufficient with regards to control of degradation of meropenem.   
The amount of sodium carbonate has been optimised in order to be sufficient to solubilize both 
substances but also adjusted so that there will be no pH extremes in the reconstituted product. 
Vabomere  is  manufactured  by  bulk  blending  the  three  sterile  components  (meropenem  trihydrate, 
vaborbactam and sodium carbonate) followed by packaging in a sterile, triple layered, vacuum-sealed 
Sterbag®. 
A  preliminary  factorial  experiment  was  initially  conducted  at  small  scale  (30  g)  to  understand  the 
factors  contributing  to  acceptable  blend  content  uniformity.  From  the  results  of  this  study  blending 
time was defined, the type of manufacturing process was confirmed and the vaborbactam particle size 
was  determined.  Also,  segregation  tests  were  performed  on  the  blend  but  no  segregation  was 
observed.  Experiments  were  also  performed  on  a  slightly  larger  scale.  Blending  time  is  considered  a 
critical process parameter.  
The process was transferred to the commercial scale blender and the three registration batches were 
manufactured. Samples were tested for pH and assay. All individual values for content uniformity of 
both active substances were within their respective assay specifications. All data recorded were within 
their predefined acceptance criteria.  
The Sterbags are then transferred to the vial filling line where they are opened under aseptic 
conditions and loaded into the hopper of an automated powder filling machine. The powder blend is 
filled into clean, sterilized and depyrogentated individual 50 mL glass vials, which are then stoppered 
and sealed. No specific discussion on the choice of sterilisation method is provided. As the proposed 
product is limited by the well-known instability of meropenem, this may be accepted. 
The selection of the 50 ml glass vial is based on the goal to use the smallest vial possible and still be 
able to introduce sufficient volume of diluent without over-pressuring the vial and having acceptable 
reconstitution time and solution stability.  
The finished product’s primary packaging material constitutes a standard type I clear glass vial of 
50 ml nominal volume with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium flip-off overseal. The glass 
complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 and the stopper with Ph Eur 3.2.9. The microbial barrier properties of the 
packaging are demonstrated by the microbial immersion test and the integrity of the stopper has been 
discussed; stability data supports the container closure system configuration.  
Compatibility  
The product is proposed to be reconstituted and diluted with 0.9 % saline prior to use. Tests are 
performed with the 3 registration batches at all long-term stability test points. The data showed that 
the reconstituted product (50 mg/ml) should be further diluted immediately; the diluted product can 
be used for up to 4h after dilution at room temperature and 22h under refrigeration. Following dilution, 
the infusion should be completed within 4 hours when stored at 25° C, or within 22 hours when 
refrigerated at 2-8 °C (SmPC 6.6). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 17/108 
 
  
Studies using 5% dextrose solutions as the reconstitution and dilution solvent were performed and the 
product was found to be chemically incompatible with this diluent. As such, the label provides 
instructions stating that only 0.9% sodium chloride solutions should be used as a diluent for Vabomere 
(SmPC 6.6). 
Regarding the compatibility of the product following reconstitution with the vial and stopper, and 
dilution with commonly used infusion bag and line materials, apart from the expected chemical 
degradation of meropenem in solution observed in the in-use studies, no other incompatibility was 
observed. This means that the product does not impact on the closure materials during storage or 
administration and therefore the interaction studies per CPMP/QWP/4359/03 are not appropriate. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process comprises of blending the three sterile components 
meropenem trihydate, vaborbactam and sodium carbonate and subsequently filling them into 
Sterbags. The Sterbags are transported to the filling site where the powder blend is filled into vials 
under aseptic conditions. The process has been described in sufficient detail. The manufacturing 
process is performed at two sites; bulk blending in one site and vial filling under aseptic conditions in 
another.  
Process validation data were provided and are acceptable. Media fill information is provided for all 
sites; adequate information on sterilisation of the equipment was provided. The process is non-
standard and process validation data at commercial scale has been provided for 3 commercial scale 
batches regarding bulk blending and for 3 commercial scale batches of finished product for the vial 
filling under aseptic conditions. All validation data generated met acceptance criteria and are 
comparable between batches. They confirm that the process is well controlled and ensures that 
product of comparable quality is manufactured. The manufacturing process is considered validated. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests and limits for appearance  (visual), 
identification of meropenem (HPLC, UV), identification of vaborbactam (HPLC, UV), clarity and colour of 
solution (Ph. Eur.), reconstitution time (visual), constituted solution (Ph. Eur.), visible particles (USP), 
particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph.Eur.), uniformity of dosage forms (Ph. 
Eur.), assay of meropenem (HPLC), assay of vaborbactam (HPLC), assay of sodium (ICP-OES), related 
substances (HPLC), elemental impurities (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. 
Eur.).  
The proposed limits for the specified impurities have been based on batch history and the levels 
qualified in toxicological studies. 
The specification limits have been justified but given the limited batch data available to date the CHMP 
recommends the applicant to re-evaluate these limits once sufficient number of batches (n=6) is 
manufactured (see recommendations).  
Regarding elemental impurities the acceptance criteria were derived from the permitted daily exposure 
(PDE) for parenteral drug products as per ICH Q3D. A total daily dose of 16.3 g product is assumed in 
line with the proposed posology. A summary of the risk assessment was provided that takes into 
account the active substance, excipients, packaging and equipment. Measured limits were provided 
and are well below the 30 % of limit threshold. Annual testing of one batch will therefore take place.  
The finished product is released on the market following traditional final product release testing. The 
procedures for analytical methods used were provided. The non-compendial analytical methods were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 18/108 
 
  
validated according to current ICH guidance. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used in the routine analysis of finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on three commercial scale batches have been provided and all test results comply 
with the specification. There is good agreement between batches. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches packaged in the proposed closure system and 
stored at long term (25°C/60% RH) and accelerated (40°C/75% RH) conditions according to ICH Q1A 
have been presented. Samples were stored in upright and inverted position. Also, data from one 
supportive laboratory scale batch has been included. The accelerated studies have been completed out 
to 6 months and data for up to 24 months data have been submitted under long term conditions. For 
the supportive laboratory scale batch, 18 months long term data are provided.  
The stability batches were tested for appearance, clarity and colour of solution, pH, water content, 
reconstitution time, visible particles, assay of the active substances, impurities, particulate matter, 
bacterial endotoxins and sterility. The analytical methods were shown to be stability indicating by 
forced degradation studies.  
All results obtained from the accelerated and long term studies are within proposed specifications and 
no significant changes or trends have been observed. No difference in the data is seen whether the 
vials are held in the upright or inverted position. It can be noted that there is no apparent increase in 
degradation products.  
A photo-stability study has been conducted according to ICH Q1B Option 1 light on one commercial 
scale batch. No difference in results was seen for light exposed samples compared to unexposed and 
dark controls. Thus, the product is not considered as sensitive to light. 
Forced degradation study has also been performed and samples of powder were exposed to heat, 
humidity, alkaline conditions, acid conditions and oxidative treatment with hydrogen peroxide. 
Although the active substances peaks were pure, degradation was observed for both substances in 
oxidising medium. While vaborbactam was stable under the other conditions, meropenem exhibits 
sensitivity to humid, alkaline and acid conditions.  
Based on the stability data presented the proposed a shelf-life of 36 months and a storage condition 
“Do not store above 25 °C” (SmPC 6.3 and 6.4) is accepted. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The active substances and excipients are provided and 
used as sterile material in the manufacture of the finished product. Sufficient information regarding the 
sterilisation of the materials prior to entering the finished product manufacture has been provided. The 
finished product manufacturing process has been validated. The container closure system is considered 
suitable for this type of product and its intended use as per the SmPC. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead 
to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
 -Given the limited batch experience with the manufacture of Vabomere, the finished product 
components specifications for those parameters affecting blend uniformity will be set after additional 
batches (n=6) have been produced and evaluated. 
 -Given the limited batch data available to date the finished product specification limits at shelf life will 
be re-evaluated once a sufficient number of batches (n=6) of Vabomere has been manufactured and 
tested for long-term stability.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Meropenem is a well-established broad-spectrum (acting against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and 
anaerobic bacteria), injectable carbapenem antibiotic that has been used worldwide for over 2 decades 
for the treatment of serious infections. It inhibits bacterial cell-wall synthesis by targeting penicillin-
binding proteins (PBPs), which are bacterial enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan.  
Administering beta-lactamase inhibitor vaborbactam in combination with meropenem is intended to 
restore the activity of carbapenems against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing 
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). 
Mechanistic studies with vaborbactam demonstrated that it behaves as a slow tight-binding inhibitor of 
KPC-2 with 1:1 stoichiometry and an extremely low off-rate, resulting in a residence time bound to 
enzyme measured in hours. Site-directed mutagenesis studies identified amino acids that play an 
important role in interaction of vaborbactam with KPC; furthermore, its distinct binding mode to KPC 
makes it different from other beta-lactamase inhibitors (Study MVAB-MOAMDCO-023, Study MVAB-
MOA-MDCO-032, and Study MVAB-MOA-MDCO-033).  
The applicant stated that recent prospective and retrospective surveillance studies that involved large 
global collections of clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that when vaborbactam was 
combined with meropenem in vitro, a marked enhancement of meropenem activity by vaborbactam 
against KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae was evident. Vaborbactam did not enhance or reduce the in 
vitro activity of meropenem against a panel of clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp 
and P. aeruginosa due to efflux of both vaborbactam and meropenem and other non-beta-lactamase 
mediated resistance mechanisms in non-fermenting bacteria.  
The exposures of meropenem and vaborbactam producing antibacterial activity and suppressing the 
development of resistance against carbapenem-resistant, KPC-producing strains of Enterobacteriaceae 
with MICs of 8 mg/L and against P. aeruginosa with MICs up to 4 mg/L were identified in an in vitro 
hollow fibre pharmacodynamic model. Based on these experiments, a dosage regimen of meropenem 
2g in combination with vaborbactam 2g administered every 8 hours by 3-hour infusion appeared to be 
the appropriate regimen for further clinical development.  
The effect of vaborbactam on meropenem efficacy in vivo was investigated in neutropenic mouse thigh, 
ascending urinary tract infection model and pulmonary infection models due to KPC-producing, 
carbapenem-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae, E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. In these models, the 
combination of vaborbactam and meropenem reduced bacterial counts at doses of meropenem that 
were ineffective when meropenem alone was administered. From a non-clinical perspective, CHMP 
agreed that the results from primary pharmacology studies support the rationale for the development 
of the proposed product – for which it appears that vaborbactam can restore the antibacterial effects of 
meropenem against carbapenem-resistant, KPC-producing strains of K. pneumoniae. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Vaborbactam was screened in vitro for secondary pharmacologic activity by evaluating binding against 
a panel of receptors, transporters and ion channels as well as by evaluating inhibition of selected 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 21/108 
 
  
human serine proteases. The applicant explained that the secondary pharmacology screen was 
completed early in the development and therefore the test concentration of vaborbactam in the off-
target screening assay was below the later identified clinical Cmax. CHMP agreed that it would have 
been valuable to test the compound in secondary screens at relevant clinical concentrations, but was of 
the view that the in vivo toxicology studies, with exposure margins versus clinical exposure exceeding 
40-50, indicate no findings of relevance for potential off-target pharmacologic effects. Furthermore, 
additional off-target assays using higher test concentrations of vaborbactam would not contribute to 
the human risk assessment at this point and such studies are therefore not considered necessary.   
Safety pharmacology programme 
As part of a general pharmacological evaluation, the effects of meropenem on the respiratory system, 
circulatory system, central nervous system, autonomic nervous system, smooth muscle, kidney 
function, blood and other biological systems were studied. Meropenem did not show any 
pharmacological effects of concern in any study. All data are published and will not be reviewed here. 
A full package of safety pharmacology was completed for vaborbactam alone, which is in accordance 
with guideline CPMP/ICH/539/00 (ICH Topic S7A). In the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) safety 
pharmacology studies; including the human hERG assay, functional observation battery, in vivo 
cardiovascular and in vivo respiratory safety pharmacology studies, vaborbactam had no apparent 
effects on the major organ systems. In vitro, hERG channel inhibition was reported at an IC50 value of 
>300 μM. 
Since vaborbactam was shown not to adversely affect the antibacterial activity of meropenem and 
since there were no safety concerns for vaborbactam, CHMP agreed that combination safety 
pharmacology studies with vaborbactam-meropenem are not required. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
For the pharmacodynamic drug interactions related to the combination of vaborbactam and 
meropenem please see the clinical part of the report. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Intravenously administered vaborbactam showed linear pharmacokinetics across all species tested 
following single-dosing. The oral bioavailability of vaborbactam in rodents was low, <10% in rats. 
Maximum vaborbactam concentrations were achieved immediately after dosing and decreased rapidly. 
The half-life tended to increase with dose, but remained relatively short across species at all doses; it 
ranged from 0.1 to approximately 2 hours. Clearance (CL) and steady-state volume of distribution 
(Vss) were independent of dose. Clearance was typically higher in rodents, ranging from 1.6 to 1.8 
L/kg/hr, than in non-rodents (0.27 – 0.51 L/kg/hr). Differences between males and females could not 
be assessed, since all studies were conducted in males. 
There was no evidence of accumulation with multiple vaborbactam doses or gender differences in 
serum PK parameters between males and females.  
In a 14-day rat study, at the NOEL, maximum mean concentration (Cmax) and AUC(All) values at Day 
14, were 2581 μg/ml and 1052 hr*μg/ml in the males respectively, and 2481 μg/ml and 899 hr*μg/ml 
in the females respectively. The systemic exposure of vaborbactam generally increased in a dose 
proportional manner without gender differences. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 22/108 
 
  
In dogs dosed for 14 days, toxicokinetic evaluation revealed the maximum plasma concentrations were 
observed at the end of the 15-minute infusion with a dose dependent increase in half-life. The mean 
clearance was comparable between sexes, decreasing slightly as the dose levels increased. The 
systemic exposure of vaborbactam generally increased in a dose proportional manner without 
differences between males and females. No accumulation was evident. 
In the rabbit embryo-fetal development (EFD) study, following repeated daily RPX7009 intravenous 
infusion for 15 minutes (for 14 days), Cmax was achieved at the end of the infusion period, declining 
thereafter rapidly with dose dependent half-life of 0.42, 0.42 (determined in one animal only), and 
2.24 hr at the low, mid, and high dose levels, respectively. The systemic exposure to vaborbactam on 
GD19 was similar as what was observed on GD7 with Cmax and AUC(all) mean values of 431, 1420, 
4967 μg/ml, and 261, 926, and 4435 hr*μg/ml at dose levels of 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/day, 
respectively. No evidence of systemic accumulation between both sampling occasions was observed as 
confirmed by the absence of quantification of vaborbactam in the pre-dose samples, except for animal 
No. 3509, where a small amount was detected (0.676 μg/ml) and all of Group 4 (high dose) where the 
pre-dose samples ranged between 0.581 and 4.385 μg/ml. As observed following dosing on GD7, the 
Cmax values increase dose proportionally while the AUC(all) values increased in a slightly greater than 
dose proportional ratio.  
Under the conditions of this study, vaborbactam was rapidly cleared from the plasma and well 
distributed with no evidence of systemic accumulation following repeated dosing. These results suggest 
that the systemic exposure to vaborbactam follow dose-dependent kinetics, possibly due to saturation 
in the drug elimination process at high doses. 
Combination PK studies have been conducted in mice, rats (adult and juvenile) and dogs. Results from 
these studies, as well as toxicokinetic evaluations from 28-day repeat dose toxicology studies where 
vaborbactam was administered alone and in combination with meropenem, confirm that the PK profiles 
of meropenem and vaborbactam are similar and are unchanged when the two drugs are administered 
together. It was also confirmed that vaborbactam had no effect on the PK profile of the open-lactam 
metabolite (hydrolysed meropenem).  
Distribution 
Both meropenem (from the literature) and vaborbactam exhibited low binding to serum proteins (less 
than 40%) in animal and human serum. In SD rats administered 100 mg/kg C14-vaborbactam over a 
30-minute infusion, a plasma drug derived half-life of 6.8hr was reported (females). Blood-to-plasma 
ratios suggested there was little to no uptake of radiolabelled drug from the plasma to the red blood 
cells. In the absence of in-vitro distribution data in blood cells from different species, it is agreed that 
measuring erythrocyte partitioning at this stage of development is not likely to generate data of 
importance for assessment of clinical concerns of vaborbactam. Radioactivity was widely distributed 
among tissues but with low mean drug-derived concentrations. The highest mean drug-derived tissue 
concentration was found in the kidneys, prostate, urinary bladder, seminal vesicle and liver, and the 
lowest in the spinal cord and brain. At 24 hours following the start of infusion, the radioactivity was 
eliminated from most tissues. Based on AUC0-96 values, the highest exposure to drug-derived 
radioactivity was in the large intestinal content, the kidneys and the urinary bladder, consistent with 
the presence of elimination through the hepatic pathway and the urinary excretion as the major route 
of elimination. Rapid elimination of the drug from tissues was apparent and confirmed by excretion 
data, where at 96 hr post-start of infusion period, a mean total recovery of 81% in urine, 7% in faeces 
and <1.0% (negligible) in carcasses and cage washes was reported.   
The applicant has acknowledged the absence of in-vivo distribution data in pigmented animals and 
explains that vaborbactam is a free acid as well as a hydrophilic compound, which makes it less likely 
to bind to melanin as compared to lipophilic drugs. This is agreed. Moreover, there was no evidence of 
Assessment report

Page 23/108 
 
  
ocular or cutaneous toxicity in pigmented beagle dogs and there have been no reports of increase in 
skin or ocular adverse events to vaborbactam in the clinic thus far. 
It is reported that meropenem is excreted in breast milk. No data on milk distribution in pregnant 
animals treated with vaborbactam or placental transfer are reported, which is reflected in the SPC. 
Metabolism 
Vaborbactam was stable in rat, dog and human microsomes and hepatocytes. As no potential 
metabolites were identified during in vitro metabolic profiling of vaborbactam, the applicant did not 
measure metabolites in vivo. The applicant cites single-dose PK study data in male SD rats whereby it 
was determined that 90% vaborbactam was excreted unchanged in the urine over 24 hours and 6.6% 
in faeces. This is in line with human excretion data and hence supports the view that no further 
discussion on metabolic pathways is warranted.  
In rat and dog pharmacokinetic studies using 14C meropenem, the ring-opened metabolite (H- 4295 or 
meropenem impurity A) was measured in both plasma and urine [Iba et al, 1992a]. 
Excretion 
Vaborbactam is primarily eliminated through renal excretion of unchanged drug with 90% excreted 
unchanged in Sprague Dawley rats. Meropenem is also reportedly primarily eliminated via the renal 
system in rats and dogs. The applicant did not provide data on the excretion pattern in dogs due to 
comparability of in-vitro pharmacokinetic data and of the toxicity profile between the rat and the dog. 
Drug interactions 
Vaborbactam as perpetrator: For CYP inhibition and induction studies, the applicant did not initially 
discuss why the concentrations in these studies did not include the 50-fold of the mean unbound 
maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) obtained at steady state during treatment with the maximum 
therapeutic dose (for study 506 Cmax was 94.7 µg/ml = 318.7 µM of total drug = 245.5 µM of free 
drug assuming 33% protein binding). During the assessment the applicant has acknowledged that the 
concentrations used in the in vitro DDI studies do not meet the current requirements. The data already 
available suggest that vaborbactam may be an inhibitor of CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations 
(Ki 200 uM, cut-off to exclude clinical relevance 8 mM).  
The applicant has been requested by CHMP and has committed to complete the in vitro enzyme, 
transporter inhibition and induction studies post-authorization and to submit the results for assessment 
not later than November 2019. This was considered acceptable by CHMP. Moreover, the applicant 
proposal to update the information on the potential for DDIs in the SmPC section 4.5 (including the 
potential for risk of increased plasma concentrations of CYP2D6 substrates) to address the limitations 
of the current data is considered acceptable by CHMP. At the same time, CHMP requested the Applicant 
to list the medicinal products with narrow therapeutic window that are predominantly metabolised by 
CYP450 enzymes and to add examples for the medicinal products that are substrates for CYP2D6 in the 
Vabomere SmPC-this has been updated accordingly.        
Regarding the renal/hepatic transporter Inhibition, the applicant proposed to conduct new 
Renal/Hepatic Transporter Inhibition studies at clinically relevant concentrations and to submit the 
results for assessment not later than November 2019. CHMP agreed to the proposal, considering that 
previous studies at lower concentrations showed that vaborbactam does not appear to be a substrate 
of OAT1, OAT3 or OCT2-mediated transport at up to 100 µM, nor is it a substrate of BCRP or P-gp at 
concentrations up to 300 µM. The current Vabomere SmPC caution of wording for co-administration of 
meropenem with probenecid is agreed upon by CHMP.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 24/108 
 
  
 
Vaborbactam as victim: Vaborbactam did not appear to be substrate for BCRP and P-gp in a 
concentration range of 30-300 µM. Vaborbactam also did not seem to be transported through OAT1, 
OAT3 and OCT2 over the same concentration range.  
Meropenem was not found to be a substrate of OAT4, OCT1 or OCT2, but was found to be a substrate 
of OAT1 and OAT3. Based on this data, the only clinical PK interaction expected would be with 
probenecid. In a Phase I clinical trial in humans, administration of probenecid did increase the plasma 
half and AUC by 33% and 55%, respectively [Bax et al, 1989]. 
Combination PK 
Combination PK studies have been conducted in mice, rats (adult and juvenile) and dogs. Results from 
these studies, as well as toxicokinetic evaluations from 28-day repeat dose toxicology studies where 
vaborbactam was administered alone and in combination with meropenem, confirm that the PK profiles 
of meropenem and vaborbactam are similar and are unchanged when the two drugs are administered 
together. It was also confirmed that vaborbactam had no effect on the PK profile of the open-lactam 
metabolite (hydrolysed meropenem).  
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
In the juvenile rats vaborbactam follows dose-dependent kinetics that increase in a greater than dose 
proportional manner, possibly due to the saturation of a clearance process at higher doses, and a rapid 
metabolism of meropenem to hydrolysed meropenem with similar dose-independent kinetics when 
administered alone or in combination. Exposures to both vaborbactam and meropenem were lower in 
juvenile rats (24 days old) compared to adult rats at the same doses, and half-lives of both drugs were 
shorter in juvenile rats. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
As per ICH M3(R2) guidance, the repeat-dose toxicity studies, which were conducted both alone 
(vaborbactam) and in combination with meropenem for up to 28 days, with 28 days’ recovery, are 
considered adequate to support registration of meropenem-vaborbactam treatment regimens of up to 
two weeks in duration. Based on the short duration of clinical treatment, carcinogenicity studies were 
not conducted, which was agreed upon by CHMP. 
In the Vabomere SmPC it is stated that 4 g Vabomere (2 g meropenem/2 g vaborbactam) is 
administered every 8 hours by intravenous infusion over 3 hours. After identification of local toxicity in 
a 14-day rat study (Study 1011-0751) related to high vaborbactam osmolality, all subsequent repeat-
dose toxicology studies of vaborbactam alone (up to 14 days) were conducted using lower 
concentrations of vaborbactam infused over 15 minutes. In these studies, doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day 
in rats and 300 mg/kg/day in Beagle dogs were administered. The proposed clinical regimen is every 8 
hours.  During the assessment, the applicant has provided a rationale for limiting the dosing in the 
non-clinical species to once/day:  i) it was made before the final dosing regimen was established; ii) to 
increase systemic exposure (which was greater than the clinical AUC); iii) to make it easier to dose 
multiple animals in an experiment; and iv) to minimize issues linked to maintaining indwelling infusion 
catheters over longer time periods. It is agreed that there are several pragmatic aspects surrounding 
repeat-dose infusions of animals, especially small animals. CHMP considered the provided reasons as 
more reasonable for rat exposures and somewhat less reasonable for dog exposures. The applicant 
explained that the periods without drug exposure can be mitigated by the fact that the plasma 
exposure profile provided considerably higher Cmax values (>20X) as well as 2 – 6 times higher AUC 
values relative to the clinical exposure. CHMP agreed the toxicological findings can still be viewed as 
relevant, since the large daily exposures allow target saturations (if applicable) and drug accumulation 
(if any) producing a visible readout (clinical chemistry and/or histopathology) as the period without 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 25/108 
 
  
drug exposure (despite being 12 – 20 hours) would be too short for any recovery to be complete after 
28 days of repeated dosing.  
Single dose toxicity 
Meropenem 
Single dose, non-GLP toxicity studies with meropenem were conducted in mice, rats, and dogs (Kohda 
A et al, 1992). Overall, the lethal dose, 50% (LD50) values in mice and rats were 2650 mg/kg (males) 
and 2950 mg/kg (females) and 2850 mg/kg (males) and 3200 mg/kg (females), respectively. The 
acute lethal dose of meropenem is 2000 mg/kg in beagle dogs. 
Vaborbactam 
At vaborbactam concentrations used for bolus intravenous administration, the high osmolarity of the 
dosing solutions resulted in local vascular toxicity in rats. At lower concentrations (and osmolarity), 
using intravenous infusion over 15 to 30 minutes, local tolerability of vaborbactam or the combination 
of vaborbactam and a carbapenem was good. Based on maximum administrable volume and maximum 
feasible concentration, 1000 mg/kg was set as the maximum feasible dose in the toxicology studies. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The applicant states there were no treatment related adverse effects from either vaborbactam or 
meropenem alone or in combination in rats or dogs. It was nevertheless noted that there are signs that 
vaborbactam may generate some hepatic inflammation in the 14d vaborbactam (study 1011-0762) 
and 28d+28d vaborbactam and meropenem dog (study 1013-1352) studies. It was alos noted that the 
dog AUC NOAEL systemic exposure margins to humans are low (14d study: 0.6x; 28d dog study: 
1.8x). Furthermore, whilst classed as non-serious (i.e. not sufficient to stop treatment) and possibly 
influenced by confounders, some patients displayed slight increases in liver enzyme blood markers. At 
the CHMP request, the applicant agreed to amend the Vabomere Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) to include the following text in section 5.3: 
In repeat dose toxicity studies in dogs, minimal hepatic inflammation was observed after 14 days and 
28 days of exposure to vaborbactam alone or combined meropenem/vaborbactam. 
Combination studies 
Rats 
After 28 days’ administration of vaborbactam and meropenem (300/100 and 1000/300 mg/kg/day) to 
rats there were no clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, clinical pathology, organ weights 
changes or macroscopic and histopathologic effects that were considered related to the combination 
(study 1013-1341). Clinical signs including redness of the skin, thinning of the fur and scabs to the 
cervical region and/or axillaries and/or forepaws were considered related to the infusion jacket and 
considered procedural related. Statistically significant changes to various haematology parameters 
were considered incidental since they were noted in some control animals, changes were minimal, 
and/or reflected the normal inter-animal variation in this species. Incidental and no-adverse raised 
total bilirubin (BIL-T) concentration was noted at the end of the recovery period (Day 57) for high-dose 
females given vaborbactam/meropenem (1000/300 mg/kg/day), as there was an absence of any 
remarkable effect concentration at the end of the dosing period no correlating microscopic changes to 
the liver.  
Infusion site changes in animals from all groups included various combinations of “firm material” and 
“soft material” adherent to the intima and “raised areas” frequently near or around the catheter tip and 
most likely indicative of the presence of a catheter in situ. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 26/108 
 
  
The applicant explained that although the liver was originally designated as a potential target organ, 
upon evaluation of the livers from all animals, especially the females, there was no clear test item-
related effect nor was there any apparent dose relationship. Furthermore, findings, which consisted of 
minimal, focal/multifocal inflammation and/or minimal or mild hepatocellular vacuolation, were also 
present in some animals receiving the reference item. Based upon the distribution and severity of 
these liver changes, there was no effect of either test item, alone or in combination, on the liver. The 
NOAELs in this study for vaborbactam and meropenem (1000 and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively) were 
x2.37 and x0.16 (x3.94 for the metabolite – open lactam), respectively. 
No new toxicities were associated with administration of vaborbactam spiked with impurities 
RPX800028 and RPX800027 in an additional 28-day study (study 1015-0201). Any reported clinical 
signs were considered incidental as they were sporadic across group and seen in control animals too 
with no dose-response relationship. As seen in the previous study, procedural-related findings included 
chronic organising thrombosis and intima proliferation at the infusion site. Reversible microscopic 
findings in the lung including mixed cell perivascular infiltrate and/or foreign body granuloma were 
noted occasionally in most treatment groups. The applicant explained that these findings are secondary 
to an indwelling catheter and infusion and were, therefore, considered procedure-related. The 
meropenem/vaborbactam NOAEL of 1000 mg/kg/500 mg/kg was associated with an average Day 28 
vaborbactam Cmax and AUC(0-12) values of 1580 μg/mL and 1022 μg∙hr/mL, respectively. This equates 
to approximate human safety margins of x2.14 and x0.27 (x7.29 for the metabolite – open lactam) for 
vaborbactam and meropenem, respectively. 
Dogs  
When dogs were administered vaborbactam, meropenem or a combination of the two for 28 days, 
clinical signs were noted in the scrotum of all groups (1013-1352): These changes included skin red in 
all groups including controls, skin scab (300 mg/kg/day RPX7009; 500 mg/kg/day meropenem; 300 
mg/kg/day RPX7009/150 mg/kg/day meropenem), fur thinning (300 mg/kg/day and 1000 mg/kg/day 
RPX7009; 300 mg/kg/day RPX7009/150 mg/kg/day meropenem; 1000 mg/kg/day RPX7009/500 
mg/kg/day meropenem), skin wound, skin wound with discharge and soft swelling. These changes 
were noted during the dosing period and some signs were still present during the recovery period 
(Group 5, 6 and 7 animals). These changes were of higher incidence in the 500 mg/kg/day 
meropenem dose (Group 5). These findings in two Group 5 and one Group 7 males did result in 
histopathological changes after the treatment period, but the findings were resolved after the recovery 
period: In the scrotum, moderate or marked ulceration was observed in 2/5 animals administered 
meropenem at 500 mg/kg/day alone and 1/5 in animals administered meropenem 500 mg/kg/day in 
combination with RPX7009 1000 mg/kg/day and correlated with macroscopic observations of wounds 
on the scrotum. The scrotal ulcers were associated with significant inflammation that extended to the 
epididymides and were accompanied with secondary changes of hypo/aspermatogenesis in the testes 
and aspermia/oligospermia in the epididymides of affected animals. As the severity and incidence was 
greater in the groups administered meropenem they were then considered possibly related to 
meropenem, although a spontaneous occurrence cannot be excluded. The applicant, however, 
theorised that as similar and less severe clinical observation were noted throughout all groups; the 
findings were possibly procedure related (daily dosing in slings), possibly related to meropenem or a 
spontaneous occurrence. Of note, since scrotal wounds were not observed macroscopically in recovery 
animals given 500 mg/kg/day of meropenem alone or in combination with RPX7009, the scrotum, 
which was not a standard study plan tissue, was not evaluated microscopically in recovery animals.  
There were changes in clinical chemistry (cholesterol elevations and changes in triglycerides, creatinine 
and albumin/globulin ratio) and urinalysis (presence of yeast) during the dosing period in this study, 
but these changes did not correlate with any histopathological findings and were not considered to be 
toxicologically significant. The NOAEL in this study was considered for vaborbactam, meropenem and 
meropenem-vaborbactam to be 1000, 500 and 500/1000 mg/kg/day, respectively. At the NOAEL the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 27/108 
 
  
margins of safety for humans following the proposed clinical posology are x6.57 vaborbactam alone, x3 
(meropenem alone) and x5.6 for the meropenem metabolite.  
Once daily 30-minute intravenous infusion of vaborbactam at doses of 100 and 1000mg/kg/day, 
biapenem (another carbapenem) at doses 30 and 100 mg/kg/day and vaborbactam/biapenem at doses 
100/10, 300/30 and 1000/100 mg/kg/day to male and female Beagle dogs were studied for 28 days. 
Relative eosinophil (EOS) mean values were significantly elevated in all but 2 high-dose biapenem 
animals. Increases in globulin were also reported across treatment groups. These changes did not 
correlate with any histopathological findings and reversibility was observed of any changes following 
the 28-day recovery period, hence were not considered to be toxicologically significant. Clinical signs in 
high-dose biapenem animals included diarrhoea and emesis. No other treatment -related effects were 
reported. Vaborbactam at 1000 mg/kg/day, biapenem at 100 mg/kg/day and 1000 mg/kg/day 
vaborbactam /100 mg/kg/day biapenem were considered the NOAEL.  
Genotoxicity 
Vaborbactam and process impurities are not genotoxic. Genotoxicity of vaborbactam was assessed in a 
battery of in vitro and in vivo studies, in compliance with ICH S2. Two vaborbactam impurities, 
RPX800007 and RPX800026 were also evaluated in the Ames assay. All assays conducted met the 
criteria for validity and all were negative, including the Ames assays of the impurities. The results 
indicate that vaborbactam is not genotoxic.  
New genotoxicity studies have not been conducted with meropenem and no evidence of mutagenic 
potential was found in any of the genotoxicity tests previously conducted for meropenem. No 
combination genotoxicity studies were conducted which is in accordance with EMEA guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with vaborbactam alone or in combination with meropenem 
based on the intended short duration of therapy (<28 days).  This is in line ICH guideline S1A: ‘The 
Need for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals’ and is therefore considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility 
In the male fertility study (1014-0941), there were no adverse effects upon male reproduction and 
male reproductive assessments, which included epididymal sperm and testicular histopathological 
evaluation. Likewise, in the female fertility study (1011-1711) female SD rats displayed no adverse 
maternal effects on clinical signs, body weights, food consumption and gross pathology and no adverse 
effects on female reproduction. Therefore, based on these studies, the no observable adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) for male or female fertility and reproductive performance and early embryonic 
development, was 1000 mg/kg/day.  
Regarding meropenem, the applicant cites Kawamura, 1992; where study results are reported 
following intravenous administration of meropenem to Alpk:ApfSD (Wistar) rats of the F0 generation to 
study the effects on the reproductive performance of male and females. Based on the published 
results, the NOAEL for male and female reproductive toxicity and early embryonic development was 
1000 mg/kg/day. 
Embryo-foetal development study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 28/108 
 
  
The administration of vaborbactam by intravenous infusion daily for 15 minutes from GD 6 to 17 
inclusive to gravid female Sprague-Dawley rats at dose levels of up to 1000 mg/kg/day was generally 
well tolerated. There were no apparent adverse maternal effects on clinical signs, body weights and 
food consumption and no evidence of embryolethality, foetotoxicity or teratogenicity that could be 
attributed to treatment at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day.  
In the rabbit definitive EFD study (study 1011-1744), no treatment-related effects on pregnancy rates 
or viability reported at doses up to 1000 mg/kg administered between GD 7 and 19. Reported major 
external and internal malformations were considered not related to vaborbactam, although no findings 
were reported in control groups. No skeletal anomalies were treatment-related. There were no adverse 
maternal effects on clinical signs, body weights and food consumption. At the highest doses tested 
Cmax and AUC0-∞ values on GD19 were 4967 μg/mL and 4444 μg∙hr/ml, respectively, in pregnant 
female rabbits [the margins of safety for humans following the proposed clinical posology are x7.05]. 
At the mid-dose Cmax and AUC0-∞ values on GD19 were 1420μg/ml and 919µg∙hr/mL rabbits [the 
margins of safety for humans following the proposed clinical posology are x1.65].  
Pre- and post-natal development study 
In the pre- and post-natal development study (1013-0351), the administration of vaborbactam at 0, 
100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day to pregnant female rats from GD 6 - PPD 20 was generally well 
tolerated. There were no adverse effects on reproduction performance of the F0 generation, or on the 
developmental performance (including sensory, behavioural and functional assessments) of the F1 
generation. The F2 generation did not generally display adverse effects. Although pup deaths occurred 
(due to starvation); this was reported across all groups.   
As this combination is intended to be used in the controlled environment of a hospital for short 
duration of dosing, CHMP agreed that the reproductive and developmental toxicology data suitably 
supports this application. In the absence of toxicokinetic data in the rat fertility (studies 1014-0941 
and 1011-1711) and EFD (study 1011-1721) studies and pre- and post-natal development study 
(1013-0351), the applicant has bridged to the toxicokinetic data collated in the general toxicology 
studies where the doses and dosing intervals were also comparable. This approach was accepted by 
CHMP.  
No reproductive studies were conducted with vaborbactam in combination with meropenem based on 
the results observed with the individual compounds. This is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Juvenile animals 
It was unclear whether study 2015-0211 (non-GLP toxicokinetics study) was conducted 
retrospectively, due to the absence of the toxicokinetic analysis in the pivotal juvenile toxicology study 
(1015-0431) as it is not included in the toxicology written summary of the application. In the pivotal 
study neither meropenem nor vaborbactam administered alone or in combination had any effect on 
juvenile animals dosed from post-natal day 24 for 28 days. The NOEL in this study was, therefore, 
considered the high dose, 500 mg/kg of meropenem, 1000 mg/kg of vaborbactam and 1000/500 
mg/kg of vaborbactam/meropenem. Assuming the purpose of the toxicokinetic study was to allow for 
bridging to the pivotal juvenile study to ascertain expected exposure levels that study, it could be 
assumed that the vaborbactam NOEL of 1000 mg/kg was associated with an average Day 1 Cmax and 
AUC0-12 values of 729 μg/mL and 41. μg∙hr/mL, respectively. Likewise, the meropenem NOEL of 500 
mg/kg/day was associated with averaged Day 1 Cmax and AUC0–12 values of 63 μg/mL and 25 
μg∙hr/ml, respectively. Moreover, the meropenem/vaborbactam combination (group 9) NOEL of 
1000/500 mg/kg/day was associated with averaged Day 1 vaborbactam Cmax and AUC0–12 values of 
631 μg/mL and 349 μg∙hr/mL, respectively, and averaged Day 1 meropenem Cmax value of 71 μg/ml 
and AUC0–12 value of 29 μg∙hr/ml. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 29/108 
 
  
For comparison, in the adult rat 28-day study GLP study (1013-1341), the vaborbactam NOAEL of 
1000 mg/kg was associated with an average Day 1 Cmax and AUC0–∞ values of 1959.38 μg/ml and 
1181.1 μg∙hr/ml, respectively, for males and females combined. The meropenem NOAEL of 
300 mg/kg/day was associated with averaged Day 1 Cmax and AUC0–∞ values of 154.95 μg/ml for 
males and females combined and 56.95 μg∙hr/ml for females only.  
In comparison, the meropenem/vaborbactam NOAEL of 1000/300 mg/kg/day was associated with 
averaged Day 1 vaborbactam Cmax and AUC(0–∞) values of 1919.81 μg/ml and 1177.06 μg∙hr/ml, 
respectively, and averaged Day 1 meropenem Cmax value of 143.91 μg/ml for males and females 
combined and  AUC(0–∞) value of 65.44 μg∙hr/ml for males. 
These results demonstrate considerably lower exposure levels in the juvenile animals (note that the 
top-dose of meropenem in the adult study was higher (500 mg/kg) than that studied in the juvenile 
study (300 mg/kg). As in the adult study the exposure levels in of the individual actives appear 
unaffected by concomitant administration. 
Other toxicity studies 
There was no evidence that the identified vaborbactam and meropenem impurities had a different 
toxicity profile from that of vaborbactam or meropenem itself. The applicant has not provided any data 
or discussion on the photo-reactivity potential for meropenem. Considering that the ICH S10 guideline 
(Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals) was introduced recently (2013), i.e. after the introduction 
of the original meropenem products, CHMP agreed that it cannot be assumed that such data exist in 
the dossiers of previous products. CHMP therefore requested and the applicant committed to 
conducting an in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test for meropenem. The results of the 
study should be submitted for assessment not later than November 2019. This was considered 
acceptable by CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
CHMP noted that during the assessment it could not be concluded that vaborbactam poses an aquatic 
environmental risk. As not all study reports have been provided, a full assessment of the ERA could not 
be conducted at this point. The applicant is required to provide OECD TG218 and TG308 study reports 
as soon as possible, but not later than June 2019.  
Furthermore, the applicant’s arguments that a limited definitive OECD TG209 test is enough for the 
ERA despite indications of max-concentration toxicity at 1000mg/L are not considered sufficient by 
CHMP. A full definitive OECD TG209 is required. Similarly, the Applicant’s arguments that OECD TG106 
sludge data can be considered sufficient with regard to the Phase IIB sediment risk assessment and 
that no additional OECD TG106 soil Koc data would be needed are also not considered acceptable by 
CHMP. Soil (or alternatively sediment) Koc data is required according to OECD TG106.  
CHMP requested that all outstanding ERA data are submitted post-approval, no later than end of June 
2019. 
The applicant has not conducted a full ERA for meropenem.  Although meropenem has not been 
previously authorised by the Centralised Procedure, it is currently authorised in 29 Member States of 
the European Economic Area through the Decentralized Procedure and no significant increase in 
environmental exposure in the EU is expected. This was considered acceptable by CHMP.

As per the guidance of ICH M3(R2), the repeat-dose toxicity studies, which were conducted both alone 
(vaborbactam) and in combination with meropenem for up to 28 days, with 28 days’ recovery, are 
adequate to support registration of meropenem-vaborbactam treatment regimens of up to two weeks 
in duration. However, the applicant’s argument that there were no treatment-related adverse effects 
from either vaborbactam or meropenem alone or in combination in rats or dogs was not accepted by 
CHMP. Subsequently, the applicant agreed to amend the Vabomere SmPC to include the following text 
in section 5.3: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 32/108 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
‘In repeat dose toxicity studies in dogs, minimal hepatic inflammation was observed after 14 days and 
28 days of exposure to vaborbactam alone or combined meropenem/vaborbactam’ 
Regarding the environmental impact of Vaborbactam, the available data do not allow to conclude 
definitively on the potential risk of vaborbactam to the environment. Likewise, evaluation of the 
phototoxic potential of vaborbactam remains outstanding. All ERA outstanding data (results of studies 
OECD 218, 308, 209 and 106) will need to be submitted for assessment not later than the end of June 
2019. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
All non-clinical issues have been resolved. CHMP agreed that the non-clinical data do not point to any 
major concerns and that the clinically relevant findings have been adequately addressed in the 
Vabomere SmPC. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The following table shows the clinical studies in which PK data were collected: 
Table 2 Studies involving the examination of the PK properties of meropenem and/or vaborbactam 
Absorption 
Study 402 was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, sequential ascending single and 
multiple dose study of vaborbactam (RPX7009) administered alone using 3-h intravenous infusions.   
Table 3 Study design for single-ascending dose (SAD) cohorts 1-6 and multiple-ascending dose (MAD) 
cohorts 7-10 
Cmax for vaborbactam occurred at the end of the infusion. After single dose and after multiple dosing 
the mean Cmax and AUC0-8 increased in a dose-proportional manner (based on the linear regression 
model and the ANOVA model applied to group means of the dose-normalised Cmax and AUC0-t.). 
There was no evidence of accumulation in plasma after multiple dosing, consistent with the short t 1/2 
(<2 hours). The mean ratio of Day 7/Day 1 Cmax was from 0.951 to 0.983 and that for Day 7 AUC0-
t/Day 1 AUC0-inf was from 0.944 to 1.00.

The pre-infusion and the end-of-infusion plasma concentrations on Days 3, 5 and 7 in cohorts 7 
through 9 and on Days 5, 7 and 9 in cohort 10 indicated that steady state was achieved prior to Day 3. 
Table 4 Mean(SD) vaborbactam PK parameters following multiple IV infusions of vaborbactam-study 
402 
Study 501 was a randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled study intended to evaluate the 
effects of co-administering single and multiple doses of meropenem and vaborbactam. Doses of 
vaborbactam and meropenem evaluated were 250 mg/1 g; 1 g/1 g; 1.5 g/1g; 2 g/1 g; and 2 g/2 g. 
•  Cohorts 1-5 received 3-hour infusions as single doses and then every 8 hours for 7 days while 
Cohort 6 received 1-hour infusions.  
•  Cohort 1 included vaborbactam 250 mg alone and Cohort 6 included vaborbactam 2 g alone.  
Peak and trough levels indicated that steady state was achieved by day 2 for each of meropenem, its 
open ring form and vaborbactam. All plasma samples were BLQ for meropenem and vaborbactam after 
the 12-h time point and all were BLQ for the meropenem open lactam metabolite after the 24-h time 
point.

Table 5 Geometric mean (geometric CV%) for select PK parameters-meropenem 
There was a relatively wide range of meropenem clearance estimates from ~0.12 to 0.4 L/h/kg, which 
is consistent with a literature report of a mean meropenem clearance of 0.22 L/h/kg.  
The meropenem mean plasma Cmax and AUC0-8 estimates after 2g/2g doses resembled values 
reported in the literature (39.8 μg/mL and 127 μg•h/mL) after administration of 2 g meropenem over 
3 hours to healthy adults. The inactive metabolite of meropenem showed some accumulation with 
multiple dosing, especially after 2 g doses, but AUCs were generally about 1/5th of those for parent 
drug.  
When comparing PK between Cohorts 1-5 (3-h infusion) vs. Cohort 6 (1-h infusions), the meropenem 
and vaborbactam half-life estimates were similar. As expected, Cmax estimates for both were higher 
after the 1-h infusion. AUCs were also higher after 1-h infusions, which may reflect the PK sampling 
scheme early in the post-dose period, i.e. since CL of meropenem and vaborbactam is relatively rapid, 
taking the first PK sample at 1.5 h may result in an underestimation of AUC after 3-h infusions.

Table 6 Geometric mean (geometric CV%) for select PK parameters-vaborbactam(RPX7009) 
The ANOVA comparisons using data from Cohorts 1-5 for meropenem and vaborbactam showed that 
for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC 0-inf the 90% CI for the LS GMRs were within 0.8, 1.25, indicating that 
exposures were not significantly impacted by co-administration. In each case the means were slightly 
higher on co-administration for all three PK parameters. The weight normalised clearance values for 
meropenem and vaborbactam were generally similar regardless of co-administration, supporting the 
conclusion that there was no important interaction. 
Qualitative comparisons of the geometric mean Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf by cohort suggested that 
the meropenem PK exposures increased in a greater than dose proportional manner. The trend was 
apparent but not so consistent with vaborbactam, for which the dose proportionality criteria for AUC0-
inf, AUC0-t and Cmax were not strictly met for all comparisons but the 90% confidence for the power 
coefficient for AUC0-inf did contain 1.00 and all other power coefficients were close to 1.00.  
Distribution 
Vaborbactam binding in serum was less than 30% in all animal species and 33% (range: 29 – 37%) in 
humans. Percent binding was independent of vaborbactam concentration. The plasma protein binding 
of meropenem is reported to be approximately 2%. 
Study 503 included 26 healthy subjects (19 male; mean age 38.5 years) who received 3 IV doses of 
2g/2g meropenem-vaborbactam as 3-hour infusions every 8 hours. Subjects were randomised to one 
of 5 bronchoscopy sampling time points after the start of the third infusion (at 1.5, 3.25, 4, 6 or 8 
hours). There were 5 subjects per time group that completed dosing and BAL. 
Following the third infusion the mean plasma meropenem Cmax and AUC0-8 were 58.2 μg/ml and 
185.5 μg·h/mL, respectively. The mean concentrations of meropenem in plasma and ELF ranged from 
1.36 to 41.2 μg/ml and 2.51 to 28.3 μg/ml, respectively. The concentrations of meropenem in the 
alveolar macrophages were below the quantifiable limit for all samples. 
The mean Cmax and AUC0-8 for plasma vaborbactam were 59.0 μg/mL and 204.2 μg·h/ml, 
respectively. The mean concentrations of vaborbactam in plasma and ELF ranged from 2.74 to 51.1 
μg/ml and 2.61 to 26.1 μg/ml, respectively. Alveolar macrophage concentrations of RPX7009 were 
measurable for all samples and ranged from 1.26 to 93.9 μg/ml.

The meropenem AUC0-8 values based on mean and median ELF concentrations were 111.7 and 
102.4 μg·h/ml, respectively, and the ratio of ELF to total plasma meropenem concentrations 
based on the mean and median AUC0-8 values were 0.63 and 0.58, respectively.  
The ratios of ELF to unbound plasma meropenem concentrations (protein binding = 2%) based 
on the mean and median AUC0-8 values were 0.65 and 0.59, respectively.

The mean ratios of ELF and AM to simultaneous plasma concentration for vaborbactam during the 8-
hour period after drug administration ranged from 0.45 to 1.01 and 0.062 to 2.58, respectively. Two 
subjects in the 6-hour group had the highest reported concentrations in AM (35.4 and 93.9 μg/ml), 
which inflated the mean ratio at 6 hours. The report states that these results may have reflected very 
high concentrations of red blood cells in their BAL fluid.

Elimination 
In study 402 mean values for the percent urinary excretion fe0-8 following repeated dosing ranged 
from 79.9% for 250 mg to 91.6% for 2 g doses. Renal clearance constituted ~80-90% of total 
clearance. Most of the drug that appeared in urine did so within the first 4 hours and almost all 
appeared within 8 hours. 
In study 501 40 to 60% of the meropenem dose and 75 to 95% of the vaborbactam dose was 
excreted intact in the urine over 24 to 48 h. There was a trend for the median renal clearance to be 
lower with combination therapy but the range of values was similar across all treatments (single- 
versus multiple-dose, alone or in combination). The high renal clearance of vaborbactam suggested a 
role for active secretion. The data from study 501 data indicated that the % of active renal secretion 
for meropenem is ~ 3% and for vaborbactam is ~ 36%.

Since the amount of active renal secretion for vaborbactam is estimated at > 25%, the applicant has 
committed to conduct new transporter studies to identify the transporter(s) responsible for the active 
secretion of vaborbactam.  
Metabolism 
• 
The potential for vaborbactam to be metabolised in the liver was evaluated in two in vitro 
studies in which it was incubated with liver microsomes from rats, dogs and humans at 37°C 
for 60 or 120 minutes. Vaborbactam was stable under these incubation conditions.

•  Meropenem undergoes limited hydrolysis (~30%) in vivo to form an inactive open lactam 
metabolite via non-enzymatic degradation mechanisms. It is relatively stable to 
dehydropeptidase I, which is found mostly in renal tissue but occurs elsewhere, including in 
lung tissue. 
The in vitro investigations relevant to metabolism reported in the application dossier were incomplete. 
The applicant has committed to address the deficiencies as a post-marketing commitment.  
Population PK analyses 
Separate POPPK models were developed for meropenem and vaborbactam. The initial models used 
pooled concentration-time data from studies 501 and 504 (93 healthy subjects) and sparse sampling 
from infected patients in 505 (N=271) and 506 (N=23). In response to CHMP’s questions and 
comment, the revised models were based on 4264 meropenem concentrations from 413 
subjects/patients and 4082 vaborbactam concentrations from 414 subjects/patients. In addition, 162 
meropenem and 122 vaborbactam plasma concentrations that had previously been deemed outliers 
were included in the revised analyses.  
In the original analyses, the inter-individual variability (IIV) in meropenem CL, Vc and Vp were 44.8, 
44.3 and 11.3%, respectively, while the IIV in vaborbactam CL, Vc, CLd and Vp were 42.4, 35.6, 30.8 
and 17.5%, respectively. In the updated analyses the IIV is increased due to the inclusion of the 
previously-identified outlier observations. 
The applicant submitted the PC-VPC plots for the updated POPPK models. The prediction intervals of 
the simulated values were generally in good agreement with prediction corrected observed data. The 
meropenem model slightly under-estimated the data in moderate and severe renal impairment while 
the vaborbactam model generally over-estimated the data, which was more noticeable in the subset of 
data with normal renal function. However, these biases were limited and were considered unlikely to 
affect the overall conclusions from the POPPK analyses.  
The covariates selected for evaluation were based upon prior experience with meropenem suggesting 
that body size and renal function were the only covariates of clinical relevance in this population. For 
vaborbactam, covariate analyses included a broader range of variables to assess the potential impact 
of age, infection status, body size, and renal function on the PK of vaborbactam. 
Using the updated POPPK models, the predicted values were compared for healthy subjects and 
patients dosed with meropenem-vaborbactam 2g/2g q8h using 3-h infusions. The table below shows 
values only for patients with normal renal function (see footnotes). The pattern that was observed with 
the initial models (i.e. higher exposures in patients vs. healthy subjects) was maintained, with the 
highest values in patients from 506.

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Study 504 evaluated single doses of 1g/1g meropenem-vaborbactam infused over 3h in 4 groups. 
Subjects on haemodialysis (HD; Group 5) received 2 doses immediately before and after the session. 
Groups were: 
•  Group 1: Mild renal insufficiency eGFRMDRD 60-89 mL/min/1.73m2 
•  Group 2: Moderate renal insufficiency eGFRMDRD 30 to < 60 ml/min/1.73m2  
•  Group 3: Severe renal insufficiency eGFRMDRD < 30 ml/min/1.73m2 not receiving HD 
•  Group 4: Normal renal function eGFRCG ≥ 90 mL/min 
•  Group 5: ESRD receiving HD 
In general, Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf for each of meropenem, the open ring form and vaborbactam 
increased with decreasing renal function along with the t 1/2. For both meropenem and vaborbactam the 
Ae 0-48 decreased with decreasing renal function. Linear regression analyses indicated that CLt and CLr 
increased with increasing renal function as measured using eGFRMDRD.

For both compounds, eGFRMDRD explained significant portions of the inter-individual variability in CLr 
and CLt, with r2 for the relationships above 0.85. The slope of the relationship between vaborbactam 
CLr and eGFRMDRD was steeper than that for the meropenem, which may be because vaborbactam non-
renal clearance (CL NR) is very low, resulting in a closer correlation between eGFRMDRD and CLt.

Haemodialysis (HD) administered immediately following drug administration significantly increased the 
clearance of meropenem (mean 2.21-fold increase in CLt, p<0.001) and vaborbactam (mean 5.11-fold 
increase, p=0.0235) relative to administration on Day 8. 
Other special populations 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Previous studies in subjects with hepatic impairment showed no effects of hepatic impairment 
on the PK of meropenem and studies in subjects with hepatic impairment have not been 
conducted for vaborbactam since there is no expected impact on vaborbactam PK. 
In the POPPK analyses sex was not a statistically significant predictor of the inter-individual 
variability (IIV) in meropenem or vaborbactam PK and AUC0-24 estimates were similar in males 
and females for both analytes.  
In the POPPK analyses race was not a statistically significant predictor of the IIV in meropenem 
or vaborbactam PK and AUC0-24 estimates were similar regardless of race for both analytes.  
For meropenem, body weight was a significant predictor of the IIV in both Vc and Vp but there 
was only a modest increase in Vc with increasing body weight and, although the relationship 
between Vp and body weight was tighter, the range of Vp values was small, especially in 
relation to Vc.  
For vaborbactam, height was a significant predictor of the IIV in CLt and BSA was a significant 
predictor of the IIV in Vc but relationships were less pronounced than for meropenem.  
In the POPPK analyses age was not a statistically significant predictor of the IIV in meropenem 
or vaborbactam PK. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No clinical DDI studies were conducted. Vaborbactam is not a substrate for and does not inhibit or 
induce CYP isoenzymes. Vaborbactam does not appear to be a substrate of OAT1, OAT3 or OCT2, it 
was not a substrate of BCRP or P-gp under the study conditions and it did not significantly decrease 
the transport of probe substrates of BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B3 and BSEP.  
Studies evaluating the potential for meropenem to interact with CYP450 enzymes are not available but 
there are no known interactions between carbapenems and substrates for CYP450 enzymes. A 
published study reported that meropenem is a substrate of OAT1 and OAT3. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Meropenem is a carbapenem that inhibits bacterial cell-wall synthesis by targeting penicillin-binding 
proteins (PBPs), which are bacterial enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan. 
Vaborbactam is a cyclic boronic acid pharmacophore that inhibits various class A and class C beta-
lactamases but not Class B and D enzymes. In contrast to other approved beta-lactamase inhibitors 
(including avibactam) vaborbactam forms a covalent adduct between the boronate moiety and the 
catalytic serine residue. No ring-opening step is involved in this reversible inhibition. KPC inhibition by 
vaborbactam has an extremely slow reversal rate compared to that for other beta-lactamases and 
there is no inactivation of vaborbactam by KPC. Vaborbactam has no significant antibacterial activity at 
clinical concentrations.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In vitro activity and resistance 
In vitro susceptibility testing was conducted using varying concentrations of meropenem in the 
presence of a fixed concentration of 8 μg/ml vaborbactam. The meropenem MIC determined in the 
presence of vaborbactam 8 μg/ml correlated better with efficacy in the in vitro PD model when 
simulating human PK on dosing with 2g/2g q8h using 3-hour infusions than the MIC determined in the 
presence of 4 μg/ml vaborbactam. The in vitro activity of meropenem-vaborbactam (MV) has been 
determined in 13 prospective and retrospective studies against a world-wide collection of >36,000 
Gram-negative bacteria. Overall results for Enterobacteriaceae are shown in the following. 
Vaborbactam does not have a notable effect on the susceptibility of non-fermenters to meropenem.

carbapenemase-negative strains of Enterobacteriaceae (N=105) with elevated 
carbapenem MIC 
A more major benefit for adding vaborbactam was observed when testing meropenem alone and the 
combination against ~1,900 KPC-producing enterobacteria with resistance to carbapenems.

• 
The Ser130 residue of KPC-2 that is important for inhibition by avibactam does not play a role 
in its inhibition by vaborbactam. The Ki of vaborbactam decreased from 0.034 μM for the wild 
type KPC-2 to 0.011 μM for the Ser130Gly mutant.  
•  KPC mutants containing P174L or D179Y amino acid substitutions are resistant to ceftazidime 
potentiation with avibactam, but not with vaborbactam. 
• 
The Trp105 residue plays a significant role in vaborbactam interaction with the KPC-2 enzyme 
but Trp105 substitutions had a minimal effect on the whole cell meropenem potentiation 
activity of vaborbactam.  
•  W105 substitutions significantly affect the kinetics of KPC-2-mediated hydrolysis. Meropenem 
potentiation by vaborbactam was not significantly affected by various W105 mutant proteins 
substitutions. 
•  Vaborbactam cannot restore susceptibility to meropenem in the presence of mechanisms of 
resistance to meropenem mediated by mutations in porin genes and multidrug resistance efflux 
pumps. 
PK-PD analyses leading to meropenem dose selection  
The PK-PD index is %ƒT>MIC and the PDT that best correlates with efficacy in vitro, in animals and in 
humans is a %ƒT>MIC of 30-40%. Using the maximum approved dose of meropenem (2 g q8h) and 
3-hour infusions the PTA at a 40% %ƒT>MIC PDT is 100% of simulated subjects for meropenem MICs 
up to 8 µg/ml. In contrast the standard approved dose of 1 g q8h over 30 minutes achieves the target 
exposure for ~90% of simulated patients with MICs up to 1 µg/ml. 
PK-PD analyses leading to vaborbactam dose selection 
The approach was to simulate the exposure of meropenem in animal and in vitro models of infection to 
determine the vaborbactam exposure needed to achieve maximal bactericidal activity and suppresses 
resistance development in KPC-containing CRE with MV MICs up to 8 µg/ml. Based on the critical 
concentration determined in resistance development studies (8 mg/L), the minimum target exposure 
for vaborbactam fAUC0-24 was 192 mg*h/L (8x24). This approach assumed that the PD-linked 
variable for vaborbactam was its AUC, which was supported by PK-PD modelling studies (see below). 
In study 402 in healthy subjects vaborbactam 2 g q8h (3-h infusions) gave AUC0-8 of 145 µg.h/mL. 
With 33% protein binding this gives a mean 24 h fAUC of 291 mg*h/L (range 231 – 320 mg*h/L).   
In a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model using KPC-producing strains and humanised dosage 
regimens (meropenem 300 mg/kg q2h and vaborbactam 50 mg q2h in mice give free drug plasma

exposures similar to those observed with 2g/2g q8h using 3 h infusions in humans) a reduction in 
bacterial counts was observed for all strains. Using fixed doses of meropenem and a KPC-producing K. 
pneumoniae strain (MV MIC 4 mg/L) the amount of bacterial killing increased with increasing doses of 
vaborbactam (see following figure). 
Figure 5 Activity of meropenem alone and in combination with vaborbactam against 
carbapenem-resistant K.pneumoniae KP1094 in a 24h neutropenic mouse thigh 
infection model (meropenem MIC: alone ≥64 mcg/mL; w/ 4mcg/mL 
vaborbactam=32 mcg/mL; w/ 8 mcg/mL vaborbactam= 4mcg/mL)  
Using a hollow fibre model, humanised dosage regimens of meropenem and vaborbactam were 
evaluated against carbapenem-resistant, KPC-producing strains of K. pneumoniae, E. coli and E. 
cloacae (inoculum ~108 CFU/mL) to assess the vaborbactam dose and to examine development of 
resistance. The model was used to mimic humanised dosage regimens of meropenem and 
vaborbactam of 1g/1g q8h, 1g/2g q8h and 2g/2g q8h each using 3-h infusions.  
The 2g/2g regimen was tested against 17 carbapenem-resistant strains with MV MICs from ≤0.06 to 
64 µg/mL. For strains with MV MICs ≤8 µg/ml >5 logs of bacterial killing were obtained with no 
regrowth. Four strains with MV MICs exceeding 8 µg/ml were studied. Bacterial regrowth was observed 
for 3 strains with MV MICs 16-64 µg/ml but the fourth strain did not show regrowth (MV MIC 16 
µg/ml). Based on the results for the simulations of meropenem 2 g and vaborbactam 2 g administered 
q8h by 3-hour infusions, a vaborbactam fAUC of at least 200 mg*hr/L in combination with meropenem 
exposures that exceeded 8 mg/ml for 30% to 50% of the dosing interval was predicted to treat 
organisms with MV MICs of 8 μg/ml and prevent development of resistant subpopulations in 
carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. 
PK-PD modeling of vaborbactam exposures considered the results from neutropenic mouse thigh and 
hollow fibre models. The dosage regimen for meropenem was designed to simulate a 2 g dose 
administered by a 3-hour infusion q8h, which was expected to produce meropenem concentrations that 
exceeded 8 μg/ml for 56% of an 8 hour dose interval (meropenem fAUC0-24 402 mg*h/L). The dosage 
regimens for vaborbactam were designed to produce 24 h vaborbactam fAUCs of 192, ~300 or 550 
mg*h/L.

Data for the 4 K. pneumoniae isolates and the single E. coli isolate tested in the neutropenic mouse 
thigh model were pooled and used to determine the relationship between the change in Log CFU/thigh 
and %ƒvaborbactam >4 μg/ml, %ƒvaborbactam >8 μg/ml, 24 h vaborbactam fAUC and 24 h 
vaborbactam fAUC/M-V MIC. None of the indices described the data very well but the fAUC0-24/MV MIC 
ratio performed best. For 1-log kill the ratio was 38. For the target MV MIC 8 µg/ml, the vaborbactam 
fAUC would need to be (38 x 8) 304 µg*h/ml, which is lower than the fAUC0-24 in healthy subjects 
(mean 343 µg*h/ml) when using the proposed clinical dose regimen (2g/2g q8h and 3-h infusions). 
Table 18 PK/PD indices, goodness of fit, and magnitude required for effect in the 
neutropenic mouse thigh infection model 
The data for the 13 K. pneumoniae isolates, the three E. cloacae and the single E. coli isolate tested in 
the in-vitro hollow fibre PK-PD model were pooled and used for the same Emax analysis. The Emax 
model fit could be accomplished when fit to the 24 h vaborbactam fAUC/MV MIC ratio. 
Table 19 PK/PD index, goodness of fit, and magnitude required for effect in the in vitro 
hollow fibre infection model 
The magnitude of 24h fAUC/MIC to produce 1-log of bacterial killing in this model was 18 but 
suppression of resistance required a 24 h vaborbactam fAUC/MIC ratio >24. It was concluded that the 
vaborbactam 24h fAUC/MV MIC ratio gave the best correlation with antibacterial effect and the ratio 
required to suppress resistance was 36.

Estimation of the probability of target attainment (PTA) was repeated during the assessment using the 
final POPPK models. The revised estimations also differed with respect to the PDTs as follows: 
• 
• 
In addition to the meropenem free-drug plasma %T>MIC targets of 30, 35 and 45%, which are 
associated with net bacterial stasis, and a 1- and 2-log 10 CFU reduction from baseline, 
respectively, %T>MIC of 40% was included in the updated assessment. 
For vaborbactam, the free-drug plasma AUC/MIC ratio associated with a 1-log 10 CFU reduction 
from baseline of 38 was evaluated. 
The following approach was taken:  
o  The ability of meropenem alone to meet the meropenem PDT at meropenem MICs was first 
assessed. If the free meropenem T>MIC was 40% or greater at a specific meropenem MIC, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 54/108 
 
  
 
 
 
then target attainment was achieved and no further assessment based on meeting the 
vaborbactam PDT was done (i.e. a contribution from vaborbactam is not needed for efficacy). 
o 
If the meropenem target was not met (i.e. the meropenem MIC was too high), then the ability 
of both meropenem and vaborbactam to meet their respective targets was assessed against 
the potentiated MIC (i.e. the meropenem-vaborbactam [MV] MIC). 
For the first simulation, a population of 5,000 patients with varying degrees of renal function was 
generated by simulating eGFR values using a uniform probability distribution for the following renal 
function groups, each of which contained 1,000 simulated patients:  
•  ≥150 to 200 mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  ≥50 to <150 mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  ≥30 to <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  ≥15 to <30 mL/ min/1.73 m2 
•  0 to <15 mL/ min/1.73 m2 
Age was simulated according to a uniform distribution between 18 to 90 years (n = 1,000) and applied 
to each renal function group to maintain the same age distribution. Weight, height and BSA values 
were generated by applying a bootstrapping method in which 1,000 patients were randomly sampled 
with replacement from the Phase 3 PK analysis population. This set of demographic values was applied 
to each renal function group to maintain the same covariate distributions.  
For the second simulation, 295 patients with cUTI or AP (122 and 173, respectively) from studies 505 
and 506 that were in the data for the refined population PK models were replicated 11 times to 
generate a clinical population consisting of 3,245 simulated patients with cUTI or AP. 
The first table below shows that for the applicant’s proposed susceptibility criterion (MV MIC of 8 mg/L) 
the PTA exceeded 90% at each meropenem target and in each renal function group with the sole 
exception of PTA=88.4% for the 45% fT>MIC PDT in the moderate impairment group. PTA was 
inadequate for MV MIC 16 mg/L in almost all renal function subgroups at the 1-log kill PDT (35% 
fT>MIC). The second table below shows the PTA for the population of simulated patients with cUTI or 
AP. In this population, PTA exceeded 90% at MV MIC of 8 µg/ml and values exceeded 90% at MV MIC 
of 16 µg/ml for the %T>MIC ≥ 30 and 35 PDTs.

The exercise was repeated for KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae using the same PDTs and separately 
by renal function group and for patients with cUTI or AP. Due to high meropenem MICs for these 
organisms the joint target attainment had to be assessed against MV MICs.  
At the meropenem 1-log kill PDT (35% fT>MIC), as well as at 40% and 45% fT>MIC, the joint PTA 
reliably exceeded 90% across all renal function sub-groups at MV MIC of 4 µg/ml but this was not 
achieved at the applicant’s proposed susceptibility criterion of MV MIC 8 µg/ml.

The exercise was further repeated for P. aeruginosa, which indicated satisfactory PTA across renal 
function groups at MV MIC 8 µg/ml, supporting the analysis across Enterobacteriaceae.   
Using the revised POPPK analyses the analyses based on Enterobacteriaceae (as a whole) and P. 
aeruginosa indicate that PTA is satisfactory for meropenem PDTs associated with 1- and 2-log 10 kill.  
However, for the KPC producers, for which vaborbactam target attainment also becomes important, 
the joint PTA is >90% only up to MV MICs of 4 mg/L. As shown in the figure below, achieving >90% 
PTA for joint target attainment at the 1-log10 kill targets would still mean that the proposed dose 
regimen would suffice for the majority of KPC producers.

Supplementary simulations and PTA using vaborbactam PDTs based on %fT>C T 
In this exercise, the selected PDTs were those associated with 1-log 10 kill in the NMT model as follows: 
•  Meropenem %T>MIC ≥ 40% 
•  Vaborbactam AUC:MIC ratio ≥38, %T>threshold of 54% with CT 4 µg/mL and 35% with CT 8 
μg/L  
Firstly, a population of 5,000 simulated patients with varying degrees of renal function was generated 
by simulating eGFR using a uniform probability distribution for the following renal function groups, 
each of which contained 1,000 simulated patients: ≥150 to 200 ml/min/1.73 m2; ≥50 to 149 
ml/min/1.73 m2; ≥30 to 49 ml/min/1.73 m2; ≥15 to 29 ml/min/1.73 m2; and <15 ml/min/1.73 m2. 
Secondly, 295 patients with cUTI or AP (122 and 173, respectively) from Studies 505 and 506 that 
were included in the dataset for the refined population PK models were replicated 11 times to give 
3,245 simulated patients with cUTI or AP. Meropenem-vaborbactam dosing regimens were assigned by 
baseline eGFR.  
The table below shows that the PTA values for KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae with MV MIC 8 
µg/mL were >90% for vaborbactam T>CT PDTs and higher than observed for the AUC/MIC ratio PDT.  
The figure below shows PTA for the higher T>CT PDT (i.e. 35% T> CT=8µg/mL). For the simulated 
patient population with cUTI or AP, PTA was >90% regardless of PDT for MV MICs at 8 µg/ml. 
Therefore, regardless of the PDT for vaborbactam selected from the 3 potential candidates identified 
from nonclinical studies, the PTA supported the proposed dose regimen and dose adjustment schema.

There were 11 ME patients with KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae and sufficient PK data for analysis, 
of which 3 had KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae, all with cUTI or AP. Meropenem MICs for these 
isolates ranged from 8 - >64 µg/ml but the MV MICs were < 0.25 µg/ml. In these patients the 24h free 
vaborbactam AUC:MIC ratio exceeded 2,252, which is >100-fold higher than nonclinical targets for 
efficacy in mice and in the hollow fibre infection model.  
The corresponding free-drug meropenem plasma concentrations exceeded the MV MIC for 100% of the 
dosing interval. All these patients had a clinical response at early, EOIVT and TOC endpoints.  
There were 175 ME patients with cUTI and sufficient PK data for analysis, of which 154 patients had an 
enterobacterial baseline pathogen. More than 90% of patients with cUTI and with Enterobacteriaceae 
achieved meropenem %fT>MIC of 100% while 96.6% and 98.7% achieved the meropenem %fT>MIC 
target of 45%. The percentages with successful responses for the efficacy endpoints assessed across 
study visits, including TOC, ranged from 93 to 100% for clinical response and 76.3 to 100% for 
microbiological response. Overall response at both EOIVT and TOC was 100 and 79% for patients with 
cUTI and the subset with Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. Accordingly, univariable PK-PD relationships 
for efficacy endpoints based on data for these analysis populations were not identified.  
Secondary pharmacology 
The applicant did not conduct a TQT study. 
In studies 402 and 501 ECGs were recorded at intervals including baseline and end of the infusion and 
were over-read and interpreted by the investigator. Analyses of placebo-corrected change-from-
baseline QTcF (∆∆QTcF) values by time point indicated that 2 g vaborbactam and 2 g meropenem does 
not cause clinically concerning QT prolongation. In study 505 ECGs were recorded before and at the 
end of infusion on several days and interpreted at a central ECG laboratory. ECGs showed a clear time-
dependent effect on ∆QTcF in both treatment groups with no relation to plasma concentrations. 
Although there was a small increase during treatment in both groups the largest mean ∆QTcF was at 
the end of the IV treatment - 7.4 ms (90% CI 5.7 to 9.1) in the meropenem-vaborbactam group and 
11 ms (90% CI 8.9 to 13.1) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group. The predicted QT effect at Cmax did 
not exceed 5 ms.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of IV meropenem+vaborbactam 
Administration of vaborbactam alone showed that Cmax and AUC0-8 increased in a dose-proportional 
manner. With a short half-life, there was no evidence of accumulation in plasma after multiple dosing 
(including the clinical dose of 2 g q8h) and there were no significant differences among the group 
mean CL ss and Vd values indicating that they did not change with increasing dose. After single doses 
the mean Ae 0-24 was estimated at 2100 mg for the 2000 mg dose, giving a mean percent urinary 
excretion of 105% (2000 mg), most of which appeared in urine in the first 8 hours. The mean percent 
urinary excretion fe 0-8 following repeated dosing at 2 g q8h was 91.6%. These data, as well as the lack 
of any metabolism of vaborbactam in vitro support the omission of a study with radiolabelled 
vaborbactam.   
Co-administration of vaborbactam with meropenem at doses including 2g/2g q8h infused over 1 or 3 
hours did not show any important effects of co-administration on meropenem, the open ring 
metabolite or vaborbactam. Although there was a trend for the median renal clearance to be lower 
with combination therapy, the overall range of values was similar across all treatments (single- versus 
multiple-dose, alone or in combination) for both meropenem and vaborbactam.

The data indicate generally similar pharmacokinetic properties for the two agents, including their 
partition coefficients. In addition, they both have relatively low or low protein binding in human sera 
(vaborbactam ~33% and meropenem ~2%). 
Healthy volunteers vs. patients 
Infected patients had higher exposures for both meropenem and vaborbactam compared to healthy 
subjects, with higher values in study 506 vs. study 505. The differences were apparent with or without 
including data from patients who had their dose adjusted in the model.  
Dose adjustment for renal impairment 
The dose adjustment schema for renal impairment that were used in studies 505 and 506 were 
different and neither study used the recommendations in the applicant’s initial or revised SmPC.  
The POPPK-predicted exposures (using the final models) and the PTA for various renal function 
categories broadly supported the dose adjustment recommendations and use of the standard dose for 
eGFR up to 200 ml/min/1.73m2. The applicant was asked to re-calculate the BSA normalised eGFR to 
absolute GFR for all simulated patients and to update the PTA plots/tables during the procedure. These 
tables and plots included estimations of PTA at the extremes of each proposed renal impairment dose 
adjustment band. Overall, these PTA results supported the final dose adjustments in section 4.2 of the 
Vabomere SmPC based on CrCL (~absolute GFR). 
However, the proposed cut-offs for dose adjustment categories (CrCL <40, <20 and <10 ml/min) were 
modified when changing from relative to absolute renal function. As the POPPK model does not 
describe the relationship between renal function and drug clearance in a reliable way due to the strong 
influence of age, the model cannot be used to simulate drug exposure in patients with different 
degrees of renal function. Thus, it cannot be used to support the proposed doses. Instead the applicant 
was asked to relate the proposed dose adjustments directly to the results of the dedicated renal 
impairment study. 
The applicant plotted the relationship between CrCL in each participant and meropenem and 
vaborbactam clearance, respectively. In addition, a linear regression analysis of the relationship 
between renal function (CrCL) and drug clearance (meropenem and vaborbactam observed values, 
respectively) was presented. Using the linear regression model, the predicted AUCs at CrCL values just 
under and above the proposed cut-offs for dose adjustments were compared with anticipated 
exposures in a subject with typical renal function for the target patient population. The finding of 
reasonably similar AUCs in all renal function sub-groups (similar or up to ~2-fold) supported the 
recommended dose adjustment schema given the relatively large therapeutic window.  
ELF penetration 
In study 503 the plasma exposures in healthy subjects were similar to those reported in study 501 
after dosing q8h with 2g/2g using 3-hour infusions. The intrapulmonary penetration of meropenem and 
vaborbactam based on AUC0-8 values of ELF and total drug concentrations were approximately 63% 
and 53%, respectively. When free drug (unbound) concentrations were considered, penetration was 
65% and 79% for meropenem and vaborbactam, respectively. The assessment of penetration based 
on AUCs and not on ratios of plasma concentrations at single time points is appropriate. The estimates 
suggest that ELF penetration is of similar magnitude for the two agents and it is also relatively high 
compared to values reported for some other antibacterial agents.   
The ELF penetration in patients with active lung infection has not been assessed. Further to the healthy 
subject data, the applicant calculated the ELF exposures to free meropenem and vaborbactam for 
patients in studies 505 and 506 by applying the ELF penetration ratios observed in study 503 (see 
following table).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 61/108 
 
  
Table 26 Concentrations of free meropenem and vaborbactam in ELF and plasma 
Since there is an 8-h dose interval, the calculated mean free meropenem AUC0-8 in ELF in healthy 
subjects gives a fT>MIC (where MIC= 8 mg/L) value of 55%, which exceeds the meropenem plasma 
PDT of fT>MIC 35% for 1-log kill and exceeds the more conservative PDTs of fT>MIC 40% and 45%.   
If the healthy subject data in the first line of the table are multiplied by 3, the free vaborbactam ELF 
AUC0-24 would be ~315 mg.h/L and the fAUC/MIC ratio would be ~39. This ratio is just about at the 
vaborbactam plasma PDT value of 38.  
Regarding the second and third lines, the applicant has taken the revised POPPK estimates for total 
drug in plasma in patients and has calculated the plasma free drug AUC0-24 values by applying the 
%protein bound values. The applicant then applied the mean ELF %penetration values from study 503 
to the patient plasma free drug AUCs to derive the free drug AUCs in ELF. The meropenem fT>MIC and 
the vaborbactam fAUC/MIC ratio based on MV MIC=8 mg/L have been calculated using the mean free 
drug in ELF. The results have then been compared against the plasma PDTs for each agent.  
The mean estimate for meropenem fT>MIC was consistent between healthy subjects and patients at 
about 55%. The applicant’s estimates for mean vaborbactam fAUC/MIC are 53 based on study 505 and 
84 based on study 506. Thus, both values are higher than the mean (~40) in healthy subjects. This 
calculated mean ELF fAUC/MIC ratio of ~40 in healthy subjects could be viewed as being 
representative of ELF penetration at the conservative end of the spectrum in patients with HAP/VAP, 
since the plasma exposures are lower in healthy subjects and it is possible that in the infected and 
inflamed lung the ELF penetration would be greater than that measured in healthy subjects in study 
503. However, it must be remembered that all these calculations are based on mean values and that 
the patient data are founded on POPPK-predicted exposures.  
Whilst PDTs relevant to ELF have not been identified, the applicant was asked to conduct exploratory 
simulations to estimate the PTA in ELF against the plasma PDTs for MV MIC=8 mg/L. For these 
analyses, simulated patients were uniformly assigned absolute eGFR values according to the ranges 
associated with dose adjustment and PTA at the extremes of each group were assessed. These 
exploratory analyses gave PTA ≥ 96.6% at a meropenem %T≥MIC target of 40% up to MIC=4 µg/ml. 
At MIC=8 µg/ml, PTA ranged from 84.2 to 96.8%, 72.1 to 96.7%, and 85.7 to 97.1%, for simulated 
patients among renal function groups based on the evaluation of all Enterobacteriaceae, KPC-producing 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 62/108 
 
  
 
Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Since it is the sufficiency of the 
vaborbactam dose that is of concern, it is notable that at the EUCAST-recommended susceptibility 
interpretive criterion (8 mg/L) the results for the KPC-producing enterobacteria indicate that even with 
augmented renal clearance the PTA (which here would reflect joint target attainment) exceeds 67% 
and at 4 mg/L the PTA exceeds 90%. Whilst the validity of this exploratory exercise is not 
substantiated for dose-finding purposes, the PTA results were considered supportive for the use of 
Vabomere to treat HAP/VAP. 
Other PK issues 
The drug-drug-interaction potential of vaborbactam appears to be low. The in vitro studies are in line 
with CHMP guidance operative at the time they were conducted. Some additional transporter studies, 
including those to identify the renal transporter(s) involved in the active secretion of vaborbactam, will 
be conducted post-approval. Meanwhile, the known DDIs for meropenem have been included in the 
Vabomere SmPC. It is acceptable that a hepatic impairment study has not been conducted. No effect of 
hepatic impairment on elimination of meropenem or vaborbactam is expected and both have low 
protein binding.  
In-vitro activity 
The investigation of the in vitro activity of meropenem-vaborbactam, including the added value of 
vaborbactam, has been extensive. In vitro susceptibility testing to determine the meropenem-
vaborbactam (MV) MIC uses varying concentrations of meropenem in the presence of vaborbactam 
fixed at 8 μg/ml. The applicant has justified the use of this fixed vaborbactam concentration based on 
its relevance to the antibacterial effect shown in the in vitro PD model with simulated human PK for 
2g/2g q8h using 3-hour infusions.    
Due to the inherent stability of meropenem in the presence of ESBLs and AmpC enzymes, a benefit for 
adding vaborbactam is most apparent against Enterobacteriaceae expressing Class A serine-based 
carbapenemases. The most important of these are the K. pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs), which 
are no longer confined to this species and can be encoded on self-transmissible plasmids. At least 10 
major KPC variants have been described so far (KPC-2 through KPC-11) and they differ among 
themselves by only one or two amino acids. They have ~45% homology with some other serine-based 
carbapenemases (e.g. SME and NMC/IMI) enzymes, which are of low or negligible clinical importance. 
Also, there are some Class C plasmid-borne serine-based carbapenemases. For example, CMY-10, 
which was first described in Enterobacter aerogenes, may be over-produced and confer resistance to 
carbapenems. However, vaborbactam inhibits these Class C serine-based carbapenemases. 
Vaborbactam does not reduce meropenem MICs when resistance is due to Class B or D enzymes. It 
also has little or no effect when meropenem resistance is due to the other possible mechanisms of 
resistance to beta-lactams. For these reasons, it has little or no effect on the susceptibility of P. 
aeruginosa to meropenem.  
The applicant points to the emergence of mutational resistance to avibactam and the lack of cross-
resistance to vaborbactam. Nevertheless, the applicant has identified mutations in the laboratory that 
affect the inhibitory capacity of vaborbactam and it must be expected that with routine use clinical 
strains with these or similar mutations will be found. This inevitability underlines the need to make 
available several different inhibitors of carbapenemases for routine use with selected beta-lactam 
partners.  
Selection of the vaborbactam PDT 
The general approach taken by the applicant was rational. It included investigations of concentrations 
needed to minimize the risk of selection of resistance.    
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 63/108 
 
  
Based on the NMT model, the vaborbactam fAUC0-24/MV MIC ratio gave the best relationship with 
bactericidal activity and the ratio for 1-log kill was 38. Although the fAUC0-24/MV MIC ratio gave an R2 
value of 0.70, the %free vaborbactam > 4 mg/L gave an R2 value of 0.66. For 1-log kill the model 
indicated that free vaborbactam should exceed 4 mg/L for 54% of the dose interval and should exceed 
8 mg/L for 35% of the dose interval.  
Based on the hollow fibre data the fAUC0-24/MV MIC ratio was supported as the PK-PD index. Putting 
the results of the two methods together it was concluded that the vaborbactam fAUC/MV MIC ratio 
gave the best correlation with antibacterial effects and the ratio required to suppress resistance was 
finally concluded to be 36.  
PTA and dose selection (see also re exploratory analysis for ELF above) 
For meropenem alone used against meropenem-susceptible organisms the situation seems very clear. 
Using the maximum approved dose and 3h infusions there is very high PTA at meropenem MICs of up 
to 8 mg/L, even when PTA is determined using a PDT of 45% for %ƒT>MIC. The critical simulations 
are therefore for the meropenem-resistant organisms and the PTA when meropenem is dosed with 
vaborbactam. These simulations, with estimations of PTA, were revised during the assessment based 
on the updated POPPK models and using a vaborbactam PDT of fAUC/MIC=38.  
The simulations of most importance to substantiate the vaborbactam dose are those for the KPC-
producing Enterobacteriaceae by renal function sub-group. At MV MIC=8mg/L and for meropenem 
fT>MIC 35%, the PTA based on KPC-producers (which is the valid analysis since this requires that joint 
target attainment is displayed) is >90% except for subsets with end stage or moderate impairment or 
augmented renal function, for which the PTA is 84-89%. However, all subjects have >90% PTA at MV 
MIC=4 mg/L. Furthermore, for MV MIC=4 mg/L the PTA is >90% even for meropenem fT>MIC 45%. 
Additional simulations using alternative vaborbactam PDTs were supplied during the assessment. 
Using T>CT values for MV MIC 4 and 8 µg/mL as the PDTs, supplementary simulations indicated that 
PTA was even higher for KPC-producing organisms than values obtained using he selected AUC/MIC 
ration PDT. These conclusions applied across renal function dose adjustment groups, lending further 
support to the adequacy of the vaborbactam dose. 
The nonclinical data and the clinical ECG data support the omission of a TQT study. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic programme has been adequate for two agents that both have relatively simple 
pharmacokinetics and show no important interaction when they are co-administered. The 
microbiological investigations have been appropriate. The final Vabomere SmPC recommendations for 
dose adjustment by CrCL categories are considered acceptable. The rationale for selection of the 
meropenem dose is understood and is acceptable. The PK-PD approach to dose selection for 
vaborbactam has been rational. The revised simulations indicate that the vaborbactam regimen (2 g 
q8h and 3-hour infusions) is adequate to protect meropenem when the MV MICs are 4 mg/L and, in 
almost all patients, when the MV MIC= 8 mg/L.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Main studies 
Study 505 (TANGO I) 
Methods 
This was a phase III, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of meropenem-vaborbactam compared to piperacillin/tazobactam in 
the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including acute pyelonephritis (AP), in 
adults.  
Study Participants  
Eligible male and non-pregnant female adults of < 185 kg were to have cUTI or AP, expected to 
require at least 5 days of IV treatment.

Any indwelling urinary catheters or instrumentation (including nephrostomy tubes and/or indwelling 
stents) were to be removed or replaced (if removal not clinically acceptable) within 12 hours after 
randomisation. Exclusions included: 
• 
Presence of any of renal or perinephric abscess, polycystic kidney disease, chronic 
vesicoureteral reflux, renal transplantation, cystectomy or ileal loop surgery, prostatitis, 
orchitis, epididymitis, recent or planned urinary tract surgery (except to relieve an obstruction) 
or APACHE II >30 
• 
Estimated CrCL CG <30 ml/min  
Potentially therapeutic antibacterial agent within 48 hours before randomisation unless the patient had 
failed or had received a single dose of a short-acting agent (allowed in up to 25% of total enrolled) 
Treatments 
Patients were randomised to: 
•  2g/2g q8h meropenem-vaborbactam over 3 h 
• 
piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g q8h over 30 min  
There was adjustment of meropenem-vaborbactam dose to 1g/1g q8h for patients with CrCL from ≥30 
to 49 ml/min (which is not the final proposed dose adjustment in the SmPC).  
Patients who met specified criteria for oral therapy and had received at least 15 IV doses could switch 
to oral levofloxacin 500 mg q24h. 
Objectives 
The pre-defined analysis populations were as follows: 
o 
ITT = all randomised 
o  MITT = all treated 
o  m-MITT = MITT with a baseline bacterial pathogen(s) of ≥105 CFU/mL in urine or the same 
bacterial pathogen present in concurrent blood and urine cultures. Patients with only a Gram-
positive pathogen in the urine were not included in the m-MITT population. 
o  CE = MITT criteria with no major selection criteria violations, with a clinical outcome, had 
received ≥80% and ≤120% of expected IV doses or at least 6 doses if a failure and at least 9 
doses if a cure. 
o  ME = those who met both MITT and CE criteria 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the EU submission was the proportion of patients in the co-primary 
m-MITT and Microbiological Evaluable (ME) Populations who achieved reduction in the baseline 
bacterial pathogen to <103 CFU/ml of urine at the TOC visit. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the following: 
• 
Proportion of subjects in the m-MITT and ME Populations with overall success at both the

EOIVT and TOC visits by infection type (cUTI or AP) 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects with a clinical outcome of Cure in the m MITT, Clinical Evaluable 
(CE), and ME populations at Day 3, EOIVT, EOT, TOC, and LFU 
Proportion of subjects in the m-MITT and ME Populations with a microbiologic outcome of 
eradication at TOC to 103 CFU/ml of urine  by infection type 
Sample size 
Assuming 60% in the m-MITT population, an overall success rate at EOIVT of 80% in both treatment 
groups and with a non-inferiority margin of 15%, the sample size of 500 patients provided 90% power 
to demonstrate the non-inferiority of meropenem-vaborbactam to piperacillin/tazobactam in the m-
MITT population. Assuming 50% in the ME population the sample size provided 84% power to 
demonstrate non-inferiority of meropenem-vaborbactam to piperacillin/tazobactam in the ME 
population. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation (1:1) to 2g/2g q8h meropenem-vaborbactam over 3 h or to piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 
g q8h over 30 min was stratified by: 
o  AP, cUTI with removable source of infection [e.g. Foley catheter] or cUTI with non-removable 
source of infection [e.g. neurogenic bladder] and 
o  Geographic region (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Rest of World) 
Enrolment was to be continued until at least 150 AP patients were enrolled (i.e. at least 30% of the 
total). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind, double-dummy study. 
Statistical methods 
The proportion of subjects with overall success and the proportion of subjects with a microbiological 
outcome of eradication were summarized by group. The 95% two-sided confidence intervals (CIs) were 
presented for the between group differences (meropenem-vaborbactam minus piperacillin/tazobactam) 
based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method. The noninferiority margin was a difference of 15%. The 
secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed as described for the primary efficacy endpoints. CIs for the 
secondary efficacy endpoints were only presented when there were 5 or more subjects in each group.

Results 
Of the 545 randomised and treated patients 88.8% completed treatment. Most patients who did not 
complete treatment withdrew during IV therapy. Just over half of patients switched to oral treatment 
and only 4 patients discontinued during this phase. 
The MITT population showed similar baseline characteristics between the two treatment groups. More 
than 90% were white, >80% were enrolled in Europe, 66% were female, >60% were aged <65 years 
while 14.3% in the meropenem-vaborbactam group and 16.8% in the piperacillin/tazobactam group 
were ≥75 years of age. Mean age was 53.0 years and mean BMI was ~ 26 kg/m2. CrCL ranged from 
19-278 ml/min (4 patients had CrCL < 30 mL/min) but the mean and median values were around 90 
ml/min. 
About 30% met SIRS criteria and about 50% had Charlson co-morbidity scores ≥3. About 60% had AP 
and 40% had cUTI. Patients with AP were predominantly female (80.1% and 80.7%) and younger 
(mean ages of 47.3 years and 46.6 years). Patients with cUTI were predominantly male (53.1% and 
56.3%) and older (mean ages of 61.4 years and 59.4 years in patients with a non-removable source of 
infection and 61.2 years and 63.3 years in patients with a removable source of infection). A higher 
proportion of AP patients had SIRS (37.9% and 43.5%) compared with cUTI patients (14.4% and 
17.9%). 
Most patients had single baseline pathogens (93.8% and 89.0%) and only one patient had 3 
pathogens. E. coli was more common in AP (76.7% and 77.2%) than in cUTI but the reverse applied 
for K. pneumoniae (AP 12.5% and 8.9%).  
For the four most commonly isolated species 3/164 baseline organisms obtained from patients 
assigned to meropenem-vaborbactam were resistant to meropenem (FDA or EUCAST criteria). In 
contrast, 32/164 baseline organisms in the piperacillin/tazobactam group were resistant to the 
assigned treatment based on EUCAST criteria and 19/164 based on FDA criteria.  
The mean duration of total (IV/PO) treatment in the MITT population was 10.1 days in the 
meropenem-vaborbactam group (range 1 to 17 days) and 9.9 days in the piperacillin/tazobactam 
group (range 2 to 15 days). The mean duration of IV therapy was 8.0 days in both groups and most 
received ≥5 to 11 days.  
Based on the EU primary endpoint non-inferiority was demonstrated in mMITT and ME populations with 
a lower bound of the 95% CI within -10%. Eradication rates were numerically higher in AP vs. cUTI 
patients.

Table 27 Eradication rate at TOC (m-MITT population and ME population) 
Site 703-005 and Site 616-003 were identified by the applicant as having significant quality issues 
during the trial. After excluding data from the two sites the lower bound of the 95% CI remained 
within -10% for mMITT and ME populations. 
Additional analyses of eradication at TOC using the EU cut-off (<103 CFU/mL) were provided that:  
i)  
Excluded patients with baseline organisms resistant to their assigned treatment. For 
meropenem-vaborbactam the proposed breakpoint of 8 mg/L was applied (3 m-MITT and 3 ME 
patients affected) and for piperacillin/tazobactam the EUCAST and CLSI breakpoints were applied (36 
and 23 m-MITT and 30 and 21 ME patients affected). The lower bounds of the 95% CI remained within 
-10%. 
ii)  
Excluded patients with baseline organisms resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam when the 
EUCAST and CLSI breakpoints were applied (so affecting the same numbers in this group as reported 
above). In the m-MITT and ME populations the lower bounds of the 95% CI remained within -10%. 
The eradication rates at TOC were higher in patients who switched to oral therapy vs. those who did 
not but were mostly numerically higher for meropenem-vaborbactam or were similar to the comparator 
rates. Exceptions were in cUTI patients with/without removable sources of infection who switched, in 
whom rates were numerically higher for piperacillin/tazobactam.  
In contrast, among cUTI patients who did not switch the rates were numerically higher for 
meropenem-vaborbactam. These rates are all based on small denominators.

Eradication rates (EU cut-off) in the meropenem-vaborbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam groups 
decreased over time, especially between EOT and TOC. Non-inferiority was maintained throughout the 
visits shown below.

The effects of age and gender on eradication rates shown below should be interpreted in terms of the 
distribution of AP and cUTI by these same factors. There were higher eradication and overall response 
rates in those with vs. without SIRS in the meropenem-vaborbactam group but this was not apparent 
in the control group.

The three meropenem-resistant pathogens treated with meropenem-vaborbactam were eradicated at 
TOC and the patients had clinical cure. These pathogens were found to have porin deficiencies and/or 
to express efflux pumps affecting susceptibility to meropenem and to the combination. 
Eradication rates at TOC for piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant (EU breakpoints) pathogens belonging to 
species for which there were at least 15 m-MITT patients were 16/36 (44%) for those treated with 
piperacillin/tazobactam and 25/38 (66%) for those treated with meropenem-vaborbactam. 
Lower eradication rates at TOC were generally observed for organisms expressing ESBLs in both 
treatment groups. 
Carbapenemases were identified in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from 3 meropenem-vaborbactam 
patients. One had P. mirabilis with VIM-1 but the MV MIC was 0.5 μg/ml. One had K. pneumoniae 
expressing OXA-48 (+CTX-M-15) with MV MIC 32 μg/ml and one had P. stuartii expressing KPC-2 
alone with MV MIC ≤0.06 μg/ml. Two had “overall success” at TOC and the third had an outcome of 
indeterminate. One patient in the piperacillin/tazobactam group was infected with two different strains 
of K. pneumoniae, both producing KPC-2 (MV MICs 2 μg/ml and <0.06 μg/ml; +SHV-12) and failed 
due to microbiologic recurrence at TOC.  
In the meropenem-vaborbactam group three patients were infected with K. pneumoniae that showed 
≥4-fold increases in MV MIC (from 0.06 μg/ml to 0.25 μg/ml in 2; from 0.125 μg/ml to 0.5 μg/ml in 
1). Whole genome sequence analysis demonstrated that the baseline and post-baseline isolates were 
likely the same. At TOC one had an indeterminate outcome and 2 failed.

Cure rates in the m-MITT, CE and ME Populations were numerically higher in the meropenem-
vaborbactam group compared with the piperacillin/tazobactam group at Day 3, EOIVT, EOT, TOC and 
LFU. No differences were seen in cure rates over time between AP and cUTI patients. Overall success 
rates (clinical and FDA eradication criteria) were higher in both groups at EOIVT than at TOC due to 
return of the baseline pathogen in both groups at TOC. Relapse was defined as isolation of urine or 
blood culture with the same baseline urinary pathogen after prior eradication and accompanied by new 
or worsening signs and symptoms of infection requiring alternative antimicrobial therapy in the time 
period after EOT. One meropenem-vaborbactam and two piperacillin/tazobactam patients met these 
relapse criteria. No patients had new infections or superinfections. 
Two patients in each treatment group died, including one piperacillin/tazobactam patient with septic 
shock. All four deaths were considered unrelated to treatment. The mean duration of ICU stay was 
shorter in the meropenem-vaborbactam group (9.3 vs. 11.1 days. For non-ICU patients, the mean 
durations of hospitalisation were 9.7 days and 9.9 days, and most were discharged home (96.9% and 
94.0%). 
Study 506 (TANGO II) 
Study 506 was ongoing at the time of submission. It was terminated during the primary assessment 
period on the advice of the DSMB, which considered that their interim benefit-risk assessment did not 
support further randomisation of patients to best available therapy (BAT). The interim CSR was 
replaced with the final CSR during the procedure.

Study 506 was a Phase III, multicentre, randomized, open-label study of meropenem 2 g-vaborbactam 
2 g versus BAT in the treatment of subjects with selected serious infections, specifically complicated 
urinary tract infections (cUTI) or acute pyelonephritis (AP), complicated intraabdominal infections 
(cIAI), hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia 
(VABP), and bacteraemia, suspected or known to be caused by CRE. 
Study Participants  
Patients were to have any of cUTI/AP, cIAI, HABP, VABP or bacteraemia was suspected or known to be 
caused by CRE. 
Treatments 
Subjects randomized to the meropenem-vaborbactam group received meropenem 2 g-vaborbactam 2 
g diluted in normal saline to a volume of 250 mL. After dilution, meropenem-vaborbactam was infused 
for 3 hours q8h using a programmable infusion pump. 
Subjects randomized to BAT were treated with the following IV antibiotics, either alone or in 
combination: a carbapenem (meropenem, ertapenem, or imipenem), tigecycline, colistin, 
aminoglycosides (amikacin, tobramycin, or gentamicin), polymyxin B, or ceftazidime-avibactam. The 
combinations for BAT were determined by the investigator, with the choice of BAT selected by the 
investigator before randomization to minimize potential selection bias. Investigators were instructed to 
select only country-approved therapies; the preparation, dose, and frequency of administration were 
recommended to be in accordance with the product labelling.

Study drug was infused for 7 days to 14 days. Changes to study drug were permitted within 72 hours 
based on susceptibility testing results. A change in study drug after 72 hours was considered a 
treatment failure and EOT procedures were performed. 
Objectives 
The objectives of the study were as follows: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of meropenem 2 g-vaborbactam 2 g in the 
treatment of subjects with selected serious infections, suspected or known to be due to CRE 
To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of meropenem and vaborbactam in subjects with selected 
serious infections, suspected or known to be due to CRE 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy endpoints differed across indications: 
• 
the primary efficacy endpoint for subjects with HABP/VABP or bacteraemia was all-cause 
mortality 
at Day 28 in the microbiological carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae Modified Intent-to-
Treat 
(mCRE-MITT) Population (i.e., all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and 
who had Enterobacteriaceae at baseline that was confirmed as meropenem-resistant) for all 
subjects with HABP or VABP combined with all subjects with bacteraemia (not related to 
cUTI/AP or HABP/VABP); 
• 
• 
The primary efficacy endpoint for subjects with cUTI or AP in the EU was the proportion of 
subjects in the mCRE-MITT Population that demonstrated microbiologic eradication (ie, 
bacterial pathogen(s) found at baseline was reduced to <103 CFU/mL of urine). 
The primary endpoint for subjects with cIAI was the proportion of patients with a clinical 
outcome of cure in the mCRE-MITT population at TOC 
Secondary efficacy endpoints for the indications of HABP/VABP, bacteraemia, and cUTI/AP included the 
following: 
•  All-cause mortality rate at Day 28 (cUTI/AP, HABP/VABP, and bacteraemia) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects with a clinical outcome of cure at TOC (HABP/VABP and bacteraemia) 
Proportion of subjects with a response of overall success at TOC (bacteraemia and cUTI/AP) 
Proportion of subjects with a clinical outcome of cure at TOC, where the use of aminoglycoside 
beyond 72 hours in subjects with a pathogen susceptible to meropenem-vaborbactam was 
assigned to failure (HABP/VABP and bacteraemia) 
Per pathogen outcome (HABP/VABP and bacteraemia) 
•  Relapse/recurrence rates (HABP/VABP, bacteraemia, and cUTI/AP) 
• 
Proportion of subjects with a microbiologic outcome of eradication (bacteraemia and cUTI/AP)

Sample size 
Due to the infeasibility of recruiting a large number of subjects infected with CRE pathogens, no formal 
power calculations were performed for this study. The sample size was based on practical 
considerations. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation (2 meropenem-vaborbactam: 1 BAT) was stratified by presenting indication (cUTI or 
AP, cIAI, HABP, VABP and bacteraemia) and by region (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Rest of 
World). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study and the investigators, study coordinators, and pharmacy staff were not 
blinded. Subjects were not informed of their treatment assignment to ensure an unbiased assessment 
of outcomes for the meropenem-vaborbactam and BAT groups. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy data were presented descriptively for: 
o  Microbiological Modified Intent-to-Treat (m-MITT) Population 
o  Microbiological Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae Modified Intent-to-Treat (mCRE-
MITT); this was the primary population for efficacy. CRE status was defined as follows:

Participant flow 
Results 
When the study was closed on the DSMB’s advice there had been 77 patients (28 bacteraemia, 34 
cUTI, 8 HAP/VAP, 7 cIAI) enrolled over 2.5 years. There was a high incidence of underlying 
comorbidities. About 40% were immunocompromised and 79% had a Charlson Comorbidity Score >5. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 77/108 
 
  
 
In the final population (52 meropenem, 25 BAT) 54 had a Gram-negative pathogen(s) isolated at 
baseline and were included in the m-MITT population and 47 had CRE (mCREMITT population), most of 
which were KPC-producers (median meropenem MIC 32 μg/ml vs. MV MIC 0.5 μg/ml).  
There were trends toward mortality, clinical and microbiologic outcome benefits for monotherapy with 
meropenem-vaborbactam vs. BAT in the mMITT and mCRE populations across the indications. The 
benefit of meropenem-vaborbactam vs. BAT was particularly evident in those with HAP/VAP and 
bacteraemia. None of the deaths in the meropenem-vaborbactam group occurred in subjects with AEs 
of sepsis or septic shock vs. 3 of 4 deaths in the BAT group. At TOC in the mCRE-MITT Population, 
clinical cure rates and microbial eradication rates were 30.5% and 11.8% higher in the meropenem-
vaborbactam group compared with the BAT group, respectively.

The higher proportion of subjects with missing data at the TOC visit in the meropenem-vaborbactam 
group compared with the BAT group makes outcomes for cUTI/AP subjects difficult to interpret. The 
mortality reductions seen with meropenem-vaborbactam monotherapy compared with BAT and the 
trend for increased clinical cure rates were seen in subjects aged ≥65 and ≥75 years, subjects who 
were immunocompromised, subjects who had a Charlson Comorbidity Score ≥4, and subjects who had 
SIRS at baseline (see below).   
Cure rates were higher in the meropenem-vaborbactam group compared with the BAT group for 
subjects aged ≥65 and ≥75 years, subjects who had a Charlson Comorbidity Score ≥6, subjects who 
had impaired renal function (CrCl <50 ml/min) at baseline and subjects who had SIRS at baseline. 
Table 30 Efficacy results by subpopulation across all indications (mCRE-MITT population) 
There were 7 subjects with HAP/VAP in the total study population of which 5 had a known CRE and 4/5 
had K. pneumoniae.  Meropenem MICs ranged from ≤0.03 μg/ml to >64 μg/ml in the meropenem-
vaborbactam and BAT group while 2 and 1 in respective groups had KPC-producing isolates. 
Seven subjects had cIAI of which 4 (2 per group) were in the m-MITT and mCRE-MITT populations. 
CRE pathogens at baseline included K. pneumoniae (3), E. cloacae species complex (1), E. coli (1), 
Proteus mirabilis (1) and an unspeciated coliform (1). The two in the meropenem-vaborbactam group 
but neither BAT subject were cures at EOT and one BAT subject died.  
Microbiological outcomes for the m-MITT population are shown by pathogen in the following:

o  One patient with AP had a KPC-producing K. pneumoniae for which the MV MIC increased from 
0.25 μg/ml at baseline to 1.0 μg/ml at TOC. Molecular analysis revealed that the TOC isolate 
could not have been directly selected from the baseline isolate. Therefore, two strains were 
likely present at baseline. The patient did not have eradication at TOC but did have a clinical 
outcome of cure at TOC. 
o  One had bacteraemia due to K. pneumoniae with an increase in meropenem MIC from 2 μg/ml 
at baseline to 8 μg/ml at EOT and an increase in MV MIC from 0.5 μg/ml to 2 μg/ml at EOT.  
Neither isolate carried any carbapenemase genes, but both had the CTX-M-15 beta-lactamase gene 
and had defective porin OmpK36. The EOT isolate had a 3 to 4-fold increase in copy of CTX-M-15 
compared to the baseline isolate. The patient had microbiologic recurrence and clinical failure at EOT 
due to death from a massive gastrointestinal haemorrhage on Day 5. 
A third patient with HABP had two different strains of meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa at baseline - 
one had meropenem and MV MICs of 8 μg/ml and one had MICs to both that were 16 μg/ml – and also 
had A. baumannii. On Day 3 the A. baumannii persisted and a strain of P. aeruginosa with a 
meropenem and MV MIC of 64 μg/ml was isolated. The baseline and Day 3 P. aeruginosa isolates were 
closely related and all three contained VIM carbapenemase. The Day 3 isolate was found to have 
insertional inactivation of the gene that encodes OprD. The A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa persisted 
at TOC and the patient was a clinical failure. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study 505 and the indication for treatment of cUTI, including AP 
Study 505 was generally of an adequate design to meet the CHMP requirements for supporting the 
claimed indication except that the final pre-defined non-inferiority margin to be applied to the EU 
primary endpoint was 15%. The margin was increased from 10% to 15% by protocol amendment, 
reducing the projected sample size from 850 to 500 patients. This approach to the margin was taken 
because the programme, consisting of studies 505 and 506, was primarily intended to support use in 
patients with limited treatment options and not to support an additional standalone indication for cUTI 
and AP.  
The study met the revised enrolment target. There were <15% in each group with CrCL < 50 ml/min, 
~5% had concurrent bacteraemia and <5% had received prior antibacterial treatment for the infection 
under study. About 60% had AP and females accounted for 66% of the total population. Despite this, 
there was a good spread of ages including ~40% aged > 65 years. Overall about 30% had SIRS and 
about 50% had Charlson comorbidity scores ≥3. The applicability of the latter index to this patient 
population is unclear but this fact does not impact on the general acceptability of the patient 
population.  
Although the pre-defined NI margin was 15% and the sample size had been adjusted, the primary 
analysis for the EU primary endpoint demonstrated that the lower bound of the 95% CI around the 
difference in eradication rates was well within -10% in the m-MITT and ME populations. The 
conclusions from the primary analysis were unchanged after removing data from the two sites where 
the sponsor identified problems during the study and in all the sensitivity analyses.   
Although study 505 met its primary endpoint it must be remembered that effectively this study 
compared meropenem at the revised dosing regimen of 2 g q8h using 3-hour infusions with 
piperacillin-tazobactam because, as expected in the general cUTI/AP population, there were very few 
meropenem-resistant, MV-susceptible organisms detected at baseline. Thus, the study cannot provide 
support for the adequacy of the vaborbactam dose to protect meropenem from Class A and C beta-

Page 81/108 
 
  
lactamases. The vaborbactam dose can only be supported by the PK-PD analyses, which are of 
paramount importance for this application.  
The imbalance in resistance to the assigned treatment was of concern for the overall validity of the 
primary analysis. Although piperacillin/tazobactam was a suitable comparator for a study that 
predominantly enrolled at European centres, it was clear that many more baseline organisms were 
resistant to the comparator whether the EUCAST or CLSI interpretive criteria were applied. After 
excluding patients infected with piperacillin-tazobactam resistant organisms the 10% NI margin was 
still met. 
It is not surprising that some piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant organisms that were treated with this 
combination and three MV-resistant organisms treated with meropenem-vaborbactam were eradicated. 
The high concentrations achieved in urine as compared to plasma may sometimes have greatly 
exceeded the MIC at least for some period of the dose interval. 
The study was not powered to demonstrate non-inferiority within patient subgroups with cUTI or AP. 
Nevertheless, the comparisons show that there was numerical superiority for meropenem-vaborbactam 
in each diagnostic subgroup except for the smallest group (cUTI with non-removable source of 
infection) in which the eradication rates were lowest (<50%) but comparable between treatments. In 
the largest subgroup of patients (i.e. those with AP) the margin was within -10%. 
Patients could switch from IV to a defined PO treatment after at least 5 days IV if protocol-listed 
criteria were met. The mean duration of IV treatment was 8 days. The analysis of outcomes for the 
57.4% meropenem-vaborbactam and 52.7% piperacillin/tazobactam patients who switched to oral 
treatment showed that eradication rates were higher in those who switched, but this observation is 
most likely driven by this sub-population being fastest to respond and generally the easiest to treat.  
The responses at EOIVT and thereafter show a pattern that has been observed in other cUTI/AP 
studies, even when there was no oral switch. The eradication rates at EOIVT were very high and 
comparable between treatments, likely reflecting high concentrations of drugs in urine. In both groups 
the rates were lower at EOT and then lower again at TOC and FU visits. At each visit, there was no 
disadvantage for the meropenem-vaborbactam group. The largest drop was between EOT and TOC, 
with a more modest drop between EOIVT and EOT. The findings suggest that colony counts in samples 
taken while substantial drug concentrations persisted in urine resulted in falsely optimistic eradication 
rates. Only after withdrawal of drug were residual live organisms picked up in cultures.  
The clinical outcomes are also of interest. These generally followed the patterns for the eradication 
rates and were lowest in both treatment groups for patients with cUTI and a non-removable source of 
infection. In addition, relapse was defined as isolation of urine or blood culture with the same baseline 
urinary pathogen after prior eradication and accompanied by new or worsening signs and symptoms of 
infection requiring alternative antimicrobial therapy after EOT. One meropenem-vaborbactam and two 
piperacillin/tazobactam patients met these relapse criteria. Almost all patients who had eradication at 
EOT but not at TOC were asymptomatic despite colony counts that exceeded 103 CFU/mL.  
Eradication rates (EU criterion) by species (regardless of susceptibility) at TOC for the two treatment 
groups can support mention of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae species complex in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC as pathogens against which efficacy was demonstrated in the cUTI/AP trial. For other 
organisms there are either too few patients or the outcomes do not support convincing efficacy. 
In conclusion, CHMP agreed that the results of study 505 support a standard indication for treatment 
of cUTI, including AP.

Study 506 
Study 506 is viewed as a supplementary study in this application. Interpretation of efficacy data from 
such studies is difficult, but useful PK data can be generated in patients with infections outside of the 
urinary tract and a limited assessment of safety can be conducted, although the underlying condition of 
patients may complicate the analysis. As acknowledged in CHMP guidance, the critical information to 
support the use of the proposed dose regimen of meropenem-vaborbactam to treat the target MDR 
organisms must come from the PK-PD analyses.   
Importantly, whilst this mixed infection study that was not designed for inferential testing cannot 
provide definitive evidence of efficacy, the DSMB recommended early study termination due to 
evidence of benefit in the meropenem-vaborbactam group. At the time of study closure 77 patients 
had been enrolled and 47 had evidence of CRE infection. The efficacy data show a consistent trend 
favouring meropenem-vaborbactam, which provides some broad support for the adequacy of the 
vaborbactam dose. 
Patients with limited treatment options 
Taken together, along with the revised PK-PD analyses, studies 505 and 506 can support the use of 
meropenem-vaborbactam to treat infections due to aerobic Gram-negative pathogens in adults with 
limited treatment options.  
cIAI and HAP/VAP 
There is no concern regarding the adequacy of the meropenem dose proposed for Vabomere to treat 
these infections, which have been claimed by the applicant. The following considerations focus on the 
justification for the vaborbactam dose: 
cIAI 
The applicant was asked to provide a detailed discussion on evidence considered to support this 
indication, which focussed on the fact that the PK properties of meropenem and vaborbactam are very 
similar. 
Meropenem is recognised to be a very good treatment for cIAI and the extension of the infusion time 
can only be expected to potentially improve its performance in this type of infection. The data obtained 
with Vabomere in a small number cIAI patients in study 506 are promising but are far too limited to be 
able to say anything about the sufficiency of the vaborbactam dose.  
Using the updated POPPK model, the volumes of distribution at steady-state were similar for 
meropenem (20.2 L) and vaborbactam (18.6 L), indicating that they distribute into a volume 
consistent with the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment. At the same time, the protein binding for the 
two agents is estimated at 2% and 33%, respectively, and they have a similar partition co-efficient 
with low likelihood that penetration of vaborbactam into ECF will be affected significantly by 
transporters. Therefore, with broadly comparable plasma levels and ECF distribution, the concentration 
of free drug in the ECF is expected to be lower for vaborbactam than for meropenem.  
Nevertheless, the nonclinical data using the neutropenic murine thigh infection model and humanised 
dosing regimens showed that there was at least ~1-log kill for most meropenem-resistant strains 
tested and that this was observed for MV MICs up to 4-8 mg/L. In the thigh model the penetration of 
both agents into ECF is a driving factor for efficacy. Therefore, the nonclinical data do support a 
conclusion that the vaborbactam dose regimen should suffice to treat cIAI, in which penetration of 
antibacterial agents into the peritoneal fluid is important. 
In conclusion, based on considerations of the free vaborbactam levels that may be achieved in the ECF 
and the evidence provided from the nonclinical data using a humanised dose regimen in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 83/108 
 
  
neutropenic murine thigh infection model, it could be agreed by CHMP that the vaborbactam dose 
should suffice to protect meropenem within the abdominal cavity should there be organisms resistant 
to meropenem alone due to production of serine carbapenemases.   
HAP/VAP 
The applicant’s justification for this indication is based on free drug ELF penetration and comparisons 
between calculated ELF concentrations in infected patients and the plasma PDTs (there being no PDTs 
established specifically for ELF). Pls. also see the section and discussion on clinical pharmacology for 
the relevant data and discussion, including the exploratory estimations of PTA achieved in ELF against 
the plasma PDTs. Overall, CHMP agreed that that use of Vabomere in HAP/VAP could be accepted. 
Treatment of bacteraemia in association with the above indications 
The applicant has claimed this indication since it was granted for meropenem on conclusion of the 
Article 30 procedure. There is no concern regarding the meropenem dose to treat patients who have a 
bacteraemia in association with the approved indications for this agent. 
It would not usually be considered appropriate to grant such an indication for a new product since the 
extent of clinical experience is almost always very limited and often restricted to one of the proposed 
indications for use. However, this situation is rather different since it is only the adequacy of the 
inhibitor dose that is potentially problematical. Furthermore, in study 505 there were 27 patients with 
bacteraemia and the eradication rates at TOC were 10/12 for meropenem-vaborbactam and 7/15 for 
piperacillin/tazobactam.  
The final data from study 506 included 14 meropenem-vaborbactam and 8 BAT patients infected with 
CRE and with bacteraemia as the sole microbiological source at baseline. The mortality was 4/14 
(28.6%) and 3/8 (37.5%) in respective groups. CHMP agreed that these results provide support for 
allowing this claim to be applied to meropenem-vaborbactam. 
Reflection of the clinical and microbiological data in the Vabomere SmPC 
The indication for use in patients with limited treatment options reflects treatment of infections due to 
aerobic Gram-negative pathogens, since this is the only broad group in which a benefit of adding 
vaborbactam to meropenem is expected. 
CHMP agreed with the wording in section 4.4 of the Vabomere Product Information that reflects the 
limitations of the clinical data. The proposed list of organisms that have been successfully treated in 
clinical trials is short. It is accompanied by a list of organisms against which efficacy has not been 
demonstrated in clinical trials, but which may be expected to respond to Vabomere. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
CHMP agreed that, based on the data assessed in this applications, the following indications are 
supportable by a combination of microbiology, nonclinical efficacy, PK-PD analyses and clinical efficacy 
data: 
•  Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including pyelonephritis  
•  Complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) 
•  Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) 
•  Vabomere is also indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative 
organisms in adults with limited treatment options (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
•

associated with, any of the infections listed above. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
At the time of filing the application there had been 407 individuals exposed to any dose of meropenem-
vaborbactam in five clinical trials. An additional 70 healthy subjects were exposed to vaborbactam 
alone. Exposure to the intended clinical dose was limited to 272 patients in 505, 23 patients in 506 and 
42 subjects in Phase 1 studies (N=337).  
During the assessment, the final clinical study report for 506 (TANGO II) was provided by the 
applicant, which included a total of 50 patients exposed to meropenem-vaborbactam. The complete 
exposure to the intended clinical dose was increased to 364 patients (272 patients in 505, 50 patients 
in 506 and 42 subjects in Phase 1 studies). 
The applicant’s summary of safety described two patient pools: 
• 
Phase III pool: Studies 505 (TANGO I) and 506 (TANGO II) pooled (322 meropenem-
vaborbactam and 298 to any comparator)  
•  All treated pool: Studies 501, 503 and 504 plus studies 505 and 506. This dataset pools data 
from all individuals who received any dose of meropenem-vaborbactam (433) and it pools 
safety data from 347 individuals who received any comparator. It excludes those who received 
vaborbactam alone. 
The following sections mainly describe the final data from 505 and 506  
Adverse events 
In study 505 slightly higher proportions in the meropenem-vaborbactam group experienced at least 
one AE, study drug-related AEs and life-threatening AEs.

Table 33 Frequent (≥1% in either group) adverse events (safety population) 
Headache and phlebitis/infusion site reaction were the only AEs that occurred at a ≥2% higher rate in 
the meropenem-vaborbactam group and none was serious or resulted in discontinuation. Severe AEs 
were reported in 2.6% meropenem-vaborbactam and 4.8% piperacillin/tazobactam patients. No 
seizures or CDAD cases occurred in the meropenem-vaborbactam group. 
AEs assessed by the investigator as related to study drug (either IV or oral therapy) were reported in 
15.1% and 12.1% of the meropenem-vaborbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam groups, respectively, 
with more drug-related AEs occurring during IV treatment (14.7% and 12.1%; see table below) than 
during oral step-down treatment (1.1% and 0.7%). Frequent drug-related AEs during IV treatment 
(see table below) included headache (4.4% and 1.1%) and phlebitis (2.6% and 0.7%) in the 
meropenem-vaborbactam group and diarrhoea (1.1% and 2.2%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group.

AEs occurred most frequently in the SOCs of Infections and Infestations (M-V, 26.0%; BAT, 56.0%) 
and Gastrointestinal Disorders (M-V, 34.0%; BAT, 32.0%). SOCs with a ≥10% difference between the 
groups were Infections and Infestations (as above), Investigations (M-V, 10.0%; BAT, 24.0%), 
Nervous System Disorders (M-V, 12.0%; BAT, 24.0%), Psychiatric Disorders (M-V, 6.0%; BAT,

20.0%), Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (M-V, 12.0%; BAT, 0%) and Renal and 
Urinary Disorders (M-V, 8.0%; BAT, 28.0%).  
Diarrhoea (M-V, 12.0%; BAT, 16.0%), anaemia (M-V, 10.0%; BAT, 12.0%) and hypokalaemia (M-V, 
10.0%; BAT, 8.0%) were the most frequent AEs in the meropenem-vaborbactam group. Sepsis (M-V, 
4.0%; BAT, 20.0%), septic shock (M-V, 2.0%; BAT, 16.0%) and diarrhoea (M-V, 12.0%; BAT, 16.0%) 
were the most frequent AEs in the BAT group. AEs indicative of renal failure occurred in a lower 
proportion of subjects in the meropenem-vaborbactam group compared with the BAT group (about half 
received colistin); these events included renal failure (0% and 4.0%, respectively), renal failure acute 
(2.0% and 12.0%, respectively) and renal impairment (2.0% and 8.0%, respectively). 
The proportion of subjects with a severe AE was lower in the meropenem-vaborbactam group 
compared with the BAT group (14.0% and 28.0%, respectively). This difference between groups was 
not due to a single AE, but several different AEs in the BAT group that were not seen in the 
meropenem-vaborbactam group. There was no drug-related AE with a >10% difference between the 
groups.  
Drug-related AEs reported by 2 subjects were diarrhoea (M-V, 4.4%; BAT, 4.0%) and leukopenia (M-V, 
4.0% BAT, no subjects) in the meropenem-vaborbactam group and C. difficile colitis (M-V, 2.0%; BAT, 
8.0%) and increased transaminases (M-V, no subjects; BAT, 8.0%) in the BAT group.  
The most frequent AE leading to study discontinuation in the meropenem-vaborbactam and BAT 
groups was sepsis/septic shock (6.0% and 16.0%, respectively). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Based on the final data from 506, There were 20 fatal AEs (12 subjects [3.7%] in the meropenem-
vaborbactam group and 8 subjects [2.7%] in the comparator group) reported across the meropenem-
vaborbactam development programme and all occurred in Phase III trials.  
None of the patients treated with meropenem-vaborbactam was assessed by the Investigator as 
related to study drug. They were determined to be complications of the underlying infection (sepsis, 
septic shock) or aggravation of the underlying condition in critically-ill patients (general physical health 
deterioration, haemorrhagic shock or multiorgan failure). In the comparator arms a higher proportion 
of deaths were due to infectious conditions (6 died of septic shock or sepsis vs. 3 in the meropenem-
vaborbactam arm).

In the Phase III pool, the incidence of SAEs was similar in the meropenem-vaborbactam and 
comparator groups (8.7% and 7.7%, respectively). Four SAEs (one M-V; three comparators) were 
considered related to study therapy by the investigator but none was considered unexpected for that 
treatment group.  The related SAEs were an infusion related reaction for meropenem/vaborbactam and 
Clostridium difficile colitis, seizure and sepsis for the comparators. The report of sepsis was not due to 
the initial bacteria identified in blood cultures but was due to Enterococcus faecium detected in the 
subject’s urine culture post treatment completion. 
Apart from the malignancies that were discovered and not deemed related to therapy, the remaining 
SAEs were expected in critically ill, older subjects with severe infections and multiple co-morbidities.

In study 505 few patients had potentially clinically significant changes in haematology values and the 
numbers were comparable between groups.

Table 38 Potentially clinically significant postbaseline hematology findings (safety 
population) 
Mean changes from baseline over time and shifts in liver function tests were minimal and similar 
between the groups. No patient met Hy’s law criteria. The incidence of potentially clinically significant 
liver function test abnormalities was low and comparable between the groups. Most of the patients 
shown in the table below had onset before EOIVT. No patient had study drug discontinued due to the 
liver function test elevations and all resolved following treatment completion. 
One patient in the meropenem-vaborbactam group had an ALT or AST ≥10X ULN. At EOIVT there was 
an increase in ALT from 45 U/L at baseline to 464 U/L (≥10X ULN) and an increase in AST from 62 U/L 
to 219 U/L (≥5X ULN) but total bilirubin was 5.6 μmol/L. ALT and AST were decreased at EOT (204 U/L 
and 39 U/L, respectively) and at TOC (ALT 73 U/L). ALT and AST increased were reported as AEs 
starting on Day 7 with resolution on Day 19. Both AEs were considered moderate, non-serious and 
possibly related to study drug.

In study 506 shifts in haematology values over time did not reveal any major differences between the 
meropenem-vaborbactam and BAT groups. Abnormalities in a haematology parameter reported as an 
AE in the meropenem-vaborbactam and BAT groups included anaemia (10.0% and 12.0%, 
respectively), leukocytosis (2.0% and 4.0%), leukopenia (4.0% and 4.0%), thrombocytopenia (4.0% 
and 8.0%) and decreased platelet count (2.0% and none).

No meropenem-vaborbactam patients had a shift in ALT from normal at baseline to high. No patient 
met Hy’s law criteria. Liver function test abnormalities reported as AEs in the meropenem-vaborbactam 
and BAT groups were ALT increased (0% and 4%, respectively), transaminases increased (0% and 
8.0%), blood ALP increased (2.0% and 4.0%), hyperbilirubinaemia (4.0% and 0%) and blood bilirubin 
increased (0% and 4.0%). These events were non-serious and did not result in discontinuation. 
One meropenem-vaborbactam patient and 2 BAT patients had acute kidney injury as defined by RIFLE 
criteria. Renal AEs of renal failure, renal failure acute, and renal impairment were reported in a lower 
percentage in the meropenem-vaborbactam group compared with the BAT group (4.0% and 24.0%, 
respectively). Renal AEs in the meropenem-vaborbactam group included moderate renal impairment 
linked to disease-related multiorgan failure in a cUTI subject and moderate acute renal failure that was 
reported as unrelated to study drug in a VABP subject. Two additional subjects in the meropenem-
vaborbactam group had other signs of reduced renal function: non-serious and mild events of oliguria, 
anuria and decreased urinary output in the context of recurrent haemorrhages in one subject with 
bacteraemia and a mild decreased urine output in a cIAI subject with a gastrointestinal bleed and 
ischemic colitis. None was considered related to study therapy. Few subjects had potentially clinically 
significant changes in other serum chemistry parameters. 
Safety in special populations 
Rates for all and drug-related AEs were higher in the meropenem-vaborbactam group for ≥ 65 years.

In the meropenem-vaborbactam group SAEs were reported more often by males (11.5% vs. 4.2% 
females) but females had higher rates than males for all and drug-related AEs (the data below 
represents the Phase III Pool including interim data from Study 506 that was submitted with the initial 
application). 
• 
There were higher rates for AEs, deaths, SAEs and AEs leading to study drug or study 
discontinuation in patients with creatinine clearance ≥30 to 49 mL/min vs. those with values 
≥50 mL/min but there were too few with values <30 mL/min for comment. 
Immunological events 
After updating the database with complete study 506 data, 13 subjects from the Phase III pool were 
identified using the Hypersensitivity Broad SMQ to which was added the PT infusion related reaction. 
Nine were determined to be hypersensitivity/infusion related reactions to meropenem-vaborbactam 
after review of the reports. The four excluded events were drug hypersensitivity to levofloxacin, 
contrast media reaction, generalised oedema and stomatitis, all due to causes other than meropenem-
vaborbactam.

In study 505 AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were reported in 2.6% and 5.1% of the 
meropenem-vaborbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam groups, respectively.

Table 44 Adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation 
AEs leading to study discontinuation were reported in 1.1% per group (3 patients each). One 
meropenem-vaborbactam patient was discontinued after receiving 7 doses because the serum 
pregnancy test conducted on Day 1 was positive. The pregnancy was terminated by an elective 
abortion 7 days later. 
In study 506 AEs leading to study drug discontinuation are summarised in the following table.  
Table 45 Adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation (safety population) 
AEs leading to study discontinuation were reported in 8 and 5 patients with 3 and 4 of these patients 
discontinuing due to sepsis/septic shock.   
Post marketing experience 
There was no post-marketing experience for vaborbactam during the assessment of the MAA.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The dose of meropenem in Vabomere is the highest approved dose in the EU and the safety profile of 
meropenem is well described. It is possible that some recognised ADRs (e.g. seizures) could occur at a 
higher rate when using this maximum dose, especially if there is inadequate dose adjustment for renal 
impairment. However, there is already a warning about seizures and reflection in section 4.8. 
The limitation of the safety database pertains to vaborbactam. Exposure to the intended clinical dose 
(2g/2g meropenem-vaborbactam using 3-h infusions) is limited to 364 patients (322 in the Phase III 
studies and 42 in the Phase I studies).   
In study 505 the general picture is of broadly similar safety profiles between meropenem-vaborbactam 
and piperacillin/tazobactam. The AEs indicated that infusion site reactions and phlebitis were slightly 
more common with meropenem-vaborbactam although it does not appear that local tolerance was a 
major issue that triggered withdrawals. 
In the Phase III pool, the rate of AEs assessed by the investigator as related to study drug that had 
onset during IV treatment was slightly higher in the meropenem-vaborbactam group ( 16.1% vs. 
14.8%) for the Phase III pool. Much of the difference in rates is represented by headache (4.0% vs. 
1.0%) and phlebitis (3.0% vs. 1.0%). The applicant revised the table of ADRs in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC during the procedure. 
Increased ALT or AST were more often reported as AEs with meropenem-vaborbactam although rates 
were < 2%. These PTs are reflected in the table in section 4.8. No patient met Hy’s law criteria. One 
young male patient had marked increases from baseline to EOIVT in ALT (≥10X ULN) and AST (≥5X 
ULN) that subsequently declined, suggesting a relationship to meropenem-vaborbactam but his total 
bilirubin at EOIVT was within the reference range (5.6 μmol/L).  
There was no testing for Coomb’s test seroconversion during studies 505 and 506 but this has been 
observed with meropenem and therefore it has been added as a possible ADR to section 4.8. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
CHMP agreed that there are no major safety concerns which would impact on the benefit-risk balance 
of Vabomere.

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.2 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 29.08.2018. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of vaborbactam with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 99/108 
 
  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers vaborbactam to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Vabomere (meropenem-vaborbactam) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 
2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Vabomere is proposed by the applicant for the treatment of the following infections in adults: 
•  Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including pyelonephritis  
•  Complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) 
•  Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) 
Treatment of patients with bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be 
associated with, any of the infections listed above. 
Vabomere is also indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in 
adults with limited treatment options. 
The types of infections to be treated are commonplace, except for those due to organisms that are 
resistant to multiple classes of antibacterial agents, which are discussed further below. Acute 
pyelonephritis may result from an ascending uncontrolled bladder infection or may be haematogenous, 
while complicated UTIs are usually associated with anatomical abnormalities or foreign bodies placed in 
the tract, such as catheters and renal stents. Complicated intraabdominal infections (cIAI) are common 
infections encountered in general surgery and have been estimated to be responsible for 20% of all 
severe sepsis episodes in the intensive care unit. Overall mortality rates in cIAIs remain as high as 
25% with subjects who develop tertiary peritonitis experiencing even higher rates. HAP/VAP is a major 
resource-consuming problem especially associated with patients who have had a complication of an 
underlying illness or medical intervention. Mortality rates are commonly at least 20%. In each case the 
severity of the underlying disease and inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, due in part to increased 
antimicrobial resistance, significantly contribute to the mortality rates.   
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Successful treatment of cUTI and HAP/VAP are especially threatened by rising rates of antimicrobial 
resistance among common urinary pathogens. The threat is somewhat less for AP and cIAI, since they 
often have an acute onset outside of hospital settings. This makes it less likely that the causative 
pathogens have been subjected to the degree of selective pressure that typically affects nosocomial 
organisms. 
Beta-lactam antibacterial agents are very commonly used to manage the above types of infections 
when they involve Gram-negative pathogens. Increasing resistance to beta-lactams, including the 
carbapenems, frequently co-exists with resistance to many other classes so that reports of organisms 
that are effectively untreatable or treatable only with resource to colistin have increased in recent 
years. Although carbapenem resistance remains at relatively low levels, for most EU countries 
increasing trends for the period 2011 to 2014 were observed for seven EU Member States. As of March 
2013, K. pneumoniae carbapenemase was the most widely disseminated carbapenemase across the 
EU. There remains an unmet medical need for treatments for patients infected with CRE.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study 505 is the pivotal clinical trial for this application. It was a randomised, double-blind trial versus 
piperacillin/tazobactam in complicated urinary tract infections and acute pyelonephritis. In line with 
CHMP guidance and scientific advice, this trial did not require that patients were infected with 
MDR/XDR pathogens, since that would have made the study design unfeasible. The study was 
designed in accordance with CHMP requirements to support a standalone and unqualified indication for 
treatment of cUTI and AP except that the pre-defined non-inferiority margin was 15%. The primary 
analysis however met the required margin of 10%. Nevertheless, with almost no meropenem-resistant, 
meropenem-vaborbactam susceptible organisms treated, this study cannot substantiate the adequacy 
of the vaborbactam dose. Its value rests in providing comparative safety data versus. another beta 
lactam/betalactamase inhibitor combination product and PK data from patients treated with the 
recommended dose. 
Study 506 may be regarded as supportive. This randomised open-label study vs. BAT allowed 
enrolment of patients with any of cUTI/AP, cIAI, HABP, VABP and bacteraemia if the infection was 
suspected or known to be caused by CRE. The study was intended only for a descriptive comparison of 
efficacy.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In study 505, about 60% had acute pyelonephritis and ~40% had complicated UTI, with a good spread 
of ages including ~40% aged above 65 years. The primary analysis for the EU primary endpoint 
demonstrated that the lower bound of the 95% CI around the difference in eradication rates was well 
within -10% in the m-MITT and ME populations. The conclusions from the primary analysis were 
unchanged after removing data from two study sites where the sponsor identified problems during the 
study.   
Although piperacillin/tazobactam was a suitable comparator for a study that predominantly enrolled at 
European centres, it was clear that many more baseline organisms were resistant to the comparator 
whether the EUCAST or CLSI interpretive criteria were applied. Additional analyses of the EU primary 
endpoint after excluding patients infected with piperacillin-resistant pathogens or pathogens resistant 
to the assigned treatment still met the 10% margin. Furthermore, although the study was not powered 
to demonstrate non-inferiority within patient subgroups with cUTI or AP, the comparisons showed 
numerical superiority for meropenem-vaborbactam in each diagnostic subgroup except for the smallest 
group (cUTI with non-removable source of infection) in which the eradication rates were lowest 
(<50%) but comparable between treatments. In the largest subgroup of patients (i.e. those with AP) 
the margin was within -10%. The clinical outcomes generally followed the patterns for the eradication 
rates. 
Patients could switch from IV to a defined PO treatment after at least 5 days IV and when protocol-
listed criteria were met. The mean duration of IV treatment was 8 days. In both treatment groups the 
eradication rates at TOC were higher in those who switched to oral treatment, most likely driven by 
this sub-population being fastest to respond and generally the easiest to treat. Most sub-group 
comparisons, which must be viewed with caution, showed numerical superiority for meropenem-
vaborbactam. A table of eradication rates (EU criterion) by species (regardless of susceptibility) at TOC 
indicates that clinical efficacy has been sufficiently demonstrated to support mention of only three 
organisms in section 5.1 of the SmPC (E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae complex).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 102/108 
 
  
 
Although study 506 was not designed for inferential testing, the DSMB reviewed interim data and 
recommended early study termination due to evidence of benefit in the meropenem-vaborbactam 
group. The final CSR provided a consistent trend favouring meropenem-vaborbactam over BAT. 
It would not usually be considered appropriate to grant a separate indication for a new product that 
endorses use in patients who have bacteraemia in association with an approved indication since the 
extent of clinical experience is almost always very limited. However, the situation for meropenem-
vaborbactam is rather different since it is only the adequacy of the inhibitor dose that is in question.  
To support this use, there were 27 patients in study 505 with bacteraemia and the eradication rates at 
TOC were 10/12 for meropenem-vaborbactam and 7/15 for piperacillin/tazobactam. Additionally, the 
final data from study 506 included 14 meropenem-vaborbactam and 8 BAT patients infected with CRE 
and with bacteremia as the sole microbiological source at baseline. The mortality was 4/14 (28.6%) 
and 3/8 (37.5%) in respective groups. The results provide support for allowing this claim to be applied 
to meropenem-vaborbactam. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Vaborbactam cannot protect meropenem from Class B and D beta-lactamases. In addition, it cannot 
restore susceptibility to meropenem if resistance is mainly or wholly due to impermeability of the outer 
membrane and/or an efflux pump. 
Although study 505 met its primary endpoint, it must be remembered that this study compared 
meropenem at the revised dosing regimen of 2 g q8h using 3-hour infusions with piperacillin-
tazobactam because there were very few meropenem-resistant, meropenem/vaborbactam-susceptible 
organisms detected at baseline. This study has value in supporting the revised regimen for meropenem 
and in generating safety and PK data in infected patients treated with the proposed meropenem-
vaborbactam regimen. However, since it cannot support the adequacy of the vaborbactam dose to 
protect meropenem from Class A and C beta-lactamases, the PK-PD analyses are of paramount 
importance to support the application.  
During the procedure, the POPPK analyses and the PK-PD analyses were revised, with re-estimation of 
the PTA. The results based on the KPC-producing organism, for which joint target attainment has been 
assessed, do support the dose regimen. However, PTA was < 90% (although > 84%) for some patient 
subgroups defined by renal function at MV MIC=8 mg/L. PTA at MV MIC=4 mg/L was highly 
satisfactory for all renal function subgroups. It should be noted that for most patients the dose is 
predicted to be adequate regardless of renal function and that there are very few KPC-producing 
organisms with MV MICs > 4 mg/L.  
Effectively, since patient numbers in study 506 were too small, there are very few clinical data to 
support the use of meropenem-vaborbactam to treat cIAI or HAP/VAP, so that these indications for use 
are actually based on the efficacy of meropenem alone and the PK-PD analyses. 
For complicated IAI, using the updated POPPK model, the general PK and the volumes of distribution at 
steady-state were similar for meropenem (20.2 L) and vaborbactam (18.6 L), indicating that they 
distribute into a volume consistent with the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment. At the same time, 
the protein binding for the two agents is estimated at 2% and 33%, respectively. Therefore, with 
broadly comparable plasma levels and ECF distribution, the concentration of free drug in the ECF is 
expected to be lower for vaborbactam than for meropenem. Nevertheless, the nonclinical data using 
the neutropenic murine thigh infection model, in which ECF levels are important for efficacy, and 
humanised dosing regimens showed that there was at least ~1-log kill for most meropenem-resistant 
strains tested at MV MICs up to 4-8 mg/L. Therefore, despite the limitations regarding clinical data, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 103/108 
 
  
nonclinical data and PK-PD considerations do support a conclusion that the vaborbactam dose regimen 
should suffice to treat cIAI. 
The justification for the HABP/VABP indication is based on free drug ELF penetration and comparisons 
between calculated ELF concentrations in infected patients and the plasma PDTs (there being no PDTs 
established specifically for ELF). The calculations are based on mean values and the patient data are 
founded on POPPK-predicted exposures. The applicant also conducted exploratory simulations to 
estimate the PTA in ELF against the plasma PDTs for MV MIC=8 mg/L, which gave very satisfactory 
results overall and for KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Based on the above, CHMP agreed that the 
use of Vabomere in HABP/VABP is acceptable. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In study 505, the general picture is of broadly similar safety profiles between meropenem-
vaborbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam. The adverse events indicated that infusion site reactions and 
phlebitis were slightly more common with meropenem-vaborbactam, although local tolerance was not 
a major issue that triggered withdrawals from the study. The rate of AEs assessed by the investigator 
as related to study drug that had onset during IV treatment was slightly higher in the meropenem-
vaborbactam group (14.7% vs. 12.1%). Much of the difference reflected rates for headache (4.4% vs. 
1.1%) and phlebitis (2.6% vs. 0.7%).  
Increased ALT or AST were more often reported as AEs with meropenem-vaborbactam although rates 
were less than 2%. No patient met Hy’s law criteria. One young male patient had marked increases 
from baseline to EOIVT in ALT (≥10X ULN) and AST (≥5X ULN) that subsequently declined, suggesting 
a relationship to meropenem-vaborbactam, but his total bilirubin at EOIVT was within the reference 
range (5.6 μmol/L).  
In study 506 adverse events occurred most frequently in the SOCs of Infections and Infestations 
(meropenem/vaborbactam (M-V), 26.0%; BAT, 56.0%) and Gastrointestinal Disorders (M-V, 34.0%; 
BAT, 32.0%). Diarrhoea (M-V, 12.0%; BAT, 16.0%), anaemia (M-V, 10.0%; BAT, 12.0%) and 
hypokalaemia (M-V, 10.0%; BAT, 8.0%) were the most frequent AEs in the meropenem-vaborbactam 
group. Sepsis (M-V, 4.0%; BAT, 20.0%), septic shock (M-V, 2.0%; BAT, 16.0%) and diarrhoea (M-V, 
12.0%; BAT, 16.0%) were the most frequent AEs in the BAT group. AEs indicative of renal failure 
occurred in a lower proportion of subjects in the meropenem-vaborbactam group compared with the 
BAT group; these events included renal failure (0% and 4.0%, respectively), renal failure acute (2.0% 
and 12.0%) and renal impairment (2.0% and 8.0%). 
There was no drug-related adverse event with a more than 10% difference between the groups. Drug-
related adverse events reported by 2 subjects were diarrhoea (M-V, 4.4%; BAT, 4.0%) and leukopenia 
(M-V, 4.0% BAT, no subjects) in the meropenem-vaborbactam group and C. difficile colitis (M-V, 
2.0%; BAT, 8.0%) and increased transaminases (M-V, no subjects; BAT, 8.0%) in the BAT group. 
Overall, CHMP agreed that in this complicated patient population, there were no major concerns 
regarding the safety profile of meropenem-vaborbactam. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database pertaining to vaborbactam is limited. Exposure to the intended clinical dose 
(2g/2g meropenem-vaborbactam using 3-h infusions) is limited to 364 patients and there are no post-
marketing data available.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There is an unmet need in terms of paucity of well tolerated antibacterial agents that are active against 
aerobic Gram-negative organisms that express Class A and C carbapenemases. The microbiological 
data and non-clinical models provided in this marketing authorisation application support a conclusion 
that vaborbactam can protect meropenem from inactivation by these beta-lactamases in the absence 
of other types of carbapenem resistance. Vabomere cannot wholly solve the problem of carbapenem 
resistance, but it provides a potentially useful alternative for treatment of many infections due to 
carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria.

Study 505 was conducted in a typical complicated UTI/AP patient population and included very few 
meropenem-resistant organisms. It provides good evidence for the adequacy of the meropenem 
regimen of 2 g q8h using 3-hour infusions, but it cannot provide clinical evidence for the adequacy of 
the vaborbactam regimen. 
At the time of closing study 506, there were 77 patients enrolled and 47 were infected with CRE. This 
study was not designed to provide definitive clinical evidence to support the meropenem-vaborbactam 
dose regimen, although the results do broadly support the vaborbactam regimen. Therefore, the 
justification for the vaborbactam dose must come from PK-PD analyses. The approach to these 
analyses was broadly rational and the revised PTA estimates indicate that the dose should cover the 
majority of enterobacteria producing Class A or C carbapenemases with MV MICs up to 8 mg/L. 
The safety database for the combination is relatively small but it does not indicate any major concerns 
resulting from addition of vaborbactam to meropenem.  
The use of meropenem-vaborbactam to treat patients infected with aerobic Gram-negative organisms 
with limited treatment options was agreed upon by CHMP. Furthermore, CHMP agreed that study 505 
provides good support for a standalone unqualified indication for treatment of cUTI/AP. The claim that 
meropenem-vaborbactam could be used to treat these two indications when patients are bacteraemic 
was also supported.  
The scientific justification for the vaborbactam dose to treat cAI and HAP/VAP comes from the revised 
PK-PD analyses and calculations of the concentrations of vaborbactam in the ELF in infected patients. 
CHMP agreed that these findings support the adequacy of the vaborbactam dose to protect 
meropenem. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall benefit-risk of Vabomere is positive for the indications claimed. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Vaborbactam cannot be expected to protect meropenem against Class B and D beta-lactamases or to 
restore susceptibility when resistance is wholly or partly due to impermeability or efflux mechanisms. 
It is very important that the user understands these limitations. The Vabomere Product Information 
conveys the limitations and recommends that use of Vabomere to treat patients with limited treatment 
options is overseen by an appropriately experienced infectious disease specialist. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Vabomere is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Vabomere is favourable in the following indication: 
“treatment of the following infections in adults: 
•  Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including pyelonephritis  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/700663/2018 
Page 106/108 
 
  
 
•  Complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) 
•  Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). 
Treatment of patients with bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be 
associated with, any of the infections listed above. 
Vabomere is also indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in 
adults with limited treatment options. 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.”

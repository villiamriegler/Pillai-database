1.  Introduction 
On 04th August 2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for EYLEA, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.  
These  data  are  also  submitted  as  part  of  the  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (EMEA-000236-PIP05-18; 
P/0115/2019).  
The  study  submitted  as  part  of  this  P46  variation  will  be  part  of  an  upcoming  Type  II  variation  to 
reflect  the  clinical  data  of  this  study  in  the  product  information.  The  MAHs  current  estimated 
submission date is in November 2021. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Aflibercept  (EYLEA)  is  a  decoy  receptor  that  binds  VEGF-A  and  PlGF  with  higher  affinity  than  their 
natural receptors, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors. 
In Europe, aflibercept (EYLEA) is approved for the following therapeutic indications:  
“Eylea is indicated for adults for the treatment of : 
• neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see section 5.1), 
• visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or central 
RVO) (see section 5.1), 
• visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) (see section 5.1), 
• visual impairment due to myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV) (see section 5.1).” 
Following the agreed PIP following study have been conducted: 
The  FIREFLEYE  paediatric  study  in  PAH  subjects  was  conducted  as  part  of  the  PIP:  EMEA-000236-
PIP05-18 (EMA P/0115/2019) 
• 
FIREFLEYE    (BAY86-5321/20090):  Open-label,  randomized,  two–arm,  controlled  study  to 
assess  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  intravitreal  (IVT)  aflibercept  compared  to  laser 
photocoagulation in patients with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). 
The 6-month core study was followed by a 5-years extension study, which was not part of the PIP:

FIREFLEYE next (20275): An Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-term Outcomes of Subjects 
Who Received Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity in Study 20090 
The  purpose  of  the  clinical  overview  (BAY  86-5321,  dated  29  July  2021),  is  to  assess  the  cumulative 
safety  data  for  these  113  paediatric  participants  (23  to  31  weeks),  from  the  start  of  aflibercept 
treatment in the FIREFLEYE study up to the end in 27 coutries. The present submission complies with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 (the ‘Paediatric Regulation’).

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Aflibercept is formulated as a sterile solution for intravitreal injection, aseptically filled in a sterile glass 
vial at a concentration of 40 mg/mL. The currently marketed formulation in the EU was used. 
During review of PIP [EMA P/0115/2019], the PDCO Formulation Working Group concluded that as the 
formulation  is  already  optimised  there  is  no  concern  for  its  intravitreal  injection  to  the  paediatric 
population.   
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
Title of Study: Open-label, randomized, two–arm, controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability  of  intravitreal  (IVT)  aflibercept  compared  to  laser  photocoagulation  in  patients  with 
retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) 
Study Name:    FIREFLEYE (aFlIbeRcEpt For ROP - IVT injection versus Laser therapy[E]) 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
Methods 
Study participants 
FIREFLEYE  was  an  open-label,  randomize,  double-arm  controlled  Phase  3  study,  which  enrolled  male 
and  female  preterm  infants  with  treatment-naïve  ROP  classified  according  to  the  International 
Classification  for  ROP  (IC-ROP  2005)  as  Zone  I  Stage  1  plus,  2  plus,  3  non-plus  or  plus,  or  Zone  II 
Stage 2 plus or 3 plus or aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity (AP-ROP) in at least one eye. 
Further key inclusion criteria were: 
- gestational age at birth ≤ 32 weeks or birth weight ≤ 1500 g 
- body weight at baseline (day of treatment) ≥ 800 g 
Key exclusion criteria 
Subjects or their potential treated eye/s were excluded from the study if any of the criteria outlined in 
Module 5.3.5.1, Report PH-41617, Section 7.2.2 were met. 
Treatments / Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Subjects  were  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  baseline  treatment  with  aflibercept  0.4  mg  or  laser  per 
eligible  eye.  After  baseline  treatment,  retreatment  and  rescue  treatment  (laser  for  the  aflibercept  -
treated  subjects,  aflibercept  for  the  laser-treated  subjects)  was  permitted  according  to  pre-defined 
retreatment and rescue treatment criteria. Retreatment with aflibercept at the same single dose of 0.4 
mg at least 28 days after the previous injection in either eye was allowed, up to 2 additional injections 
per  eye.  In  case  multiple  laser  sessions  were  necessary  within  1  week  from  baseline,  they  were

counted  as  a  single  treatment.  Subjects  for  whom  aflibercept  rescue  treatment  was  initiated  were 
thereafter managed according to the aflibercept arm treatment regimen. 
One or both eyes could be treated according to the investigator’s assessment of the study’s eligibility 
criteria.  The  second  eye  of  subjects  who  started  the  study  with  one  eligible  eye  was  kept  under 
observation  according  to  the  local  ROP  screening  guidelines  or  at  every  study  visit,  whichever  was 
more  frequent.  Second  eyes  that  developed  ROP  requiring  treatment  during  the  study  received 
treatment according to the randomization assignment of the first eye.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of aflibercept in subjects diagnosed with 
ROP in comparison to laser. 
The secondary objectives were to: 
•  Assess the safety and tolerability of aflibercept 
•  Assess the treatment burden of aflibercept and laser 
•  Describe the systemic exposure to aflibercept 
Other prespecified objectives were to: 
•  Characterize further aspects of the effect of aflibercept in the treatment of ROP 
• 
Further investigate the study intervention and similar drugs (i.e. mode-of-action-related effects 
and/or safety) and to further investigate pathomechanisms deemed relevant to diseases of the 
eye and associated health problems 
At the end of the FIREFLEYE trial, if continued treatment was deemed beneficial by the investigator, an 
extension study was proposed (FIREFLEYE extension).

Outcomes/endpoints /Statistical Methods 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  “proportion  of  patients  with  absence  of  active  ROP  and 
unfavorable  structural  outcomes  at  24  weeks  after  starting  study  treatment”  based  on  investigator 
assessment. Unfavorable structural outcomes were pre-specified in the protocol as retinal detachment, 
macular  dragging,  macular  fold,  and  or  retrolental  opacity.  Active  ROP  was  defined  (according  to  the 
inclusion criteria) as ROP requiring treatment.  
Secondary efficacy variables included: 
•  Requirement for intervention with a second treatment modality from Baseline to Week 24  
•  Recurrence of ROP from Baseline to Week 24 
•  To  explore  new  Retinopathy  of  Prematurity  Activity  Scale  proposed  by  the  International  Neonatal 
Consortium 
•  Number of aflibercept administrations from Baseline to Week 24 
•  Number of laser treatments from Baseline to Week 24  
Safety was assessed based on SAEs, TEAEs and presence of anti-drug antibodies. 
A  Bayesian  statistical  model  was  used  for  the  primary  analysis.  The  success  criterion  was  defined  as 
“response  probability  for  aflibercept  is  greater  than  one  for  laser  minus  5  percentage  points  with  at 
least  95%  probability”  i.e.:  P  (response  probability  for  aflibercept  >  [response  probability  for  laser  - 
5%])  >  95%.  This  can  be  interpreted  as  non-inferiority  hypothesis  with  a  non-inferiority  margin  of  5 
percentage points. A sensitivity analysis was also performed where the central reading center data was 
used  instead  of  the  investigators’  assessments  of  ROP  at  week  24.  Key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints 
addressing the primary objective were “requirement for intervention with a second treatment modality 
from baseline to week 24” and as well as “recurrence of ROP from baseline  to week 24”, which were 
also analysed using Bayesian statistical models. Safety analyses included variables such as ocular and 
non-ocular  (systemic)  adverse  events  (AEs),  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs,  defined  as 
AEs  reported  after  the  first  treatment  and  no  later  than  30  days  after  the  last  treatment 
administration),  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  device  events,  clinical  laboratory  parameters,  and 
other safety evaluations as outlined in the 20090 CSR. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  rationale  was  based  on  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  “absence  of  active  ROP  and 
unfavourable structural outcomes at 24 weeks after starting study treatment” and the success criterion 
defined  as  response  probability  for  aflibercept  is  greater  than  the  one  for  laser  minus  5  percentage 
points  with  at  least  95%  probability.  With  at  least  102  subjects  evaluable  for  the  primary  analysis  in 
the FAS and a randomization ratio of 2:1 (active:control) to receive either treatment with aflibercept or 
laser  photocoagulation  (68  and  34  subjects,  respectively),  the  defined  success  criterion  would  be 
achieved with a power of 81% under following assumptions: 
• 
The  laser  response  probability  for  the  study  is  similar  to  historic  data:  a  Bayesian  meta-
analytical  prediction  based  on  BEAT-ROP  and  RAINBOW  resulted  in  a  posterior  predictive 
distribution  described  by  a  beta  (34.7,  13.8)  distribution.  For  the  power  simulations,  the  true 
response probability for laser photocoagulation in this trial was drawn from this distribution for 
each simulation run.

•  And the response probability for aflibercept is 15 percentage points higher than for laser, but 
not higher than 95%.  
Respective  power  simulations  were  performed  using  package  rjags  (Plummer,  2016)  in  the  statistical 
software R (R Core Team, 2016). 
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy variable used the full analysis set (FAS). The FAS included 
all  subjects  who  received  any  study  treatment  and  had  a  baseline  and  at  least  one  post-baseline 
assessment of efficacy. Safety variables were analysed based on the safety analysis set (SAF). The SAF 
included all subjects who received any type of study treatment. Both FAS and the SAF included a total 
of 113 subjects treated at baseline, 75 in the aflibercept arm and 38 in the laser arm. 
Results 
Recruitment / Number analysed 
FIREFLEYE study was conducted at 64 centers across 27 countries. The first subject was enrolled on 25 
SEP 2019. Recruitment was completed on 28 AUG 2020. Last patient last visit was on 12 FEB 2021. 
A  total  of  121  subjects  were  screened  and  118  subjects  were  randomized,  75  to  the  aflibercept  arm 
and  43  to  the  laser  arm.  Five  randomized  subjects  were  withdrawn  prior  to  receiving  any  study 
intervention  (all  were  randomized  to  laser).  In  all  cases  either  the  parents  or  physician  had  decided 
against treatment with laser. Therefore, at baseline, 75 (100%) subjects were treated with aflibercept 
and  38  (88.4%)  were  treated  with  laser.  A  total  of  104  (88.1%)  subjects  completed  the  study,  68 
(90.7%) in the aflibercept arm and 36 (83.7%) in the laser arm. 
Baseline data 
The  number  of  male  subjects  (54.7%)  was  slightly  higher  than  female  subjects  (45.3%)  in  the 
aflibercept arm but were equally distributed in the laser arm, 50% males, 50% females. The majority 
of  subjects  were  White  (73.5%),  while  23.0%  were  Asian  (of  which  14.2%  were  from  Japan).  The 
gestational age at birth ranged from 23 to 31 weeks (median 26 weeks, 0 days; mean ± SD: 26 weeks 
2 days ± 1.9), with the majority of subjects in the < 28 weeks category (83.2% subjects overall). At 
the  time  of  treatment,  the  mean  chronological  age  was  10.3  weeks  and  the  mean  body  weight  was 
1965.3  g  (mean  weight  at  the  time  of  birth:  862.1  g).  The  ROP  of  the  majority  of  subjects  was 
classified  by  the  investigators  as  Zone  II  (63.7%  subjects;  excluding  AP-ROP),  followed  by  Zone  I 
(excluding AP-ROP) (19.5%) and AP-ROP (16.8%). 
Within  Zone  I  and  Zone  II  categories,  most  subjects  had  ROP  Stage  3  plus  disease  (Zone  II:  52.2% 
and  Zone  I:  11.5%).  In  the  AP-ROP  category,  most  subjects  were  classified  as  Zone  I  (14.2%).  In 
summary,  the  most  frequent  type  of  ROP  at  baseline  was  Zone  II  stage  3  plus  disease  (52.2%), 
followed  by  Zone  I  stage  3  plus  (11.5%)  and  AP-ROP  (16.8%;  [Zone  I:  14.2%  and  Zone  II:  2.7%]) 
(Module 5.3.5.1 Report PH-41617, Table 14.1.4 / 8).  
All subjects took at least one concomitant medication during the study. The most frequent medications 
in the aflibercept arm were: ophthalmologicals, vitamins, and antibacterials for systemic use in 100%, 
93.3%,  and  92.0%  of  subjects,  respectively.  In  the  laser  arm,  the  most  frequent  medications  were: 
ophthalmologicals,  all  other  therapeutic  products,  and  vitamins  in  100%,  94.7%,  and  92.1%  of 
subjects, respectively. There were no considerable differences between treatment arms in concomitant 
medications  by  ATC  class,  with  the  exception  of  antiinfectives  for  systemic  use  (97.3%  of  aflibercept 
subjects  and  81.6%  of  laser  subjects),  antineoplastic  and  immunomodulating  agents  (33.3%  of

aflibercept  subjects  versus  13.2%  of  laser  subjects),  and  genitourinary  system  and  sex  hormones 
(73.3% of aflibercept subjects versus 55.3% of laser subjects). 
Several  deviations  from  the  protocol  in  terms  of  study  design  or  conduct  were  reported  during  the 
study. 
Efficacy results 
Results of the primary objective – treatment success 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of aflibercept in subjects diagnosed with 
ROP in comparison to laser at 24 weeks after starting study treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint 
was the proportion of patients with absence of active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes at 24 
weeks after starting study treatment based on the investigator’s assessment. Active ROP was defined 
as  ROP  (according  to  the  inclusion  criteria)  requiring  treatment.  Unfavourable  structural  outcomes 
included  retinal  detachment,  macular  dragging,  macular  fold,  or  retrolental  opacity.  One  eye  or  both 
eyes of a patient were included into the analysis to determine the primary endpoint on a patient level, 
if  treated  and  meeting  the  inclusion  criteria.  Subjects  receiving  rescue  treatment  were  considered 
nonresponders with respect to the primary endpoint. The primary efficacy endpoint analysis was based 
on the FAS, which included all  subjects who received any study treatment  and had a  baseline and  at 
least one post-baseline assessment of efficacy. 
Of the total 146 eyes (71 subjects with 2 eligible eyes and 4 subjects with 1 eligible eye) treated with 
aflibercept, 126 (86.3%) eyes (59 subjects with 2 eligible eyes and 8 subjects with 1 eligible eye) met 
the  response  criterion.  In  the  laser  arm,  of  the  total  72  eyes  (34  subjects  with  2  eligible  eyes  and  4 
subjects with 1 eligible eye) treated with laser, 61 (84.7%) eyes (28 subjects with 2 eligible eyes and 
5 subjects with 1 eligible eye) met the response criterion. The number of subjects (eyes) who met the 
response  criteria  was  numerically  higher  in  the  aflibercept  arm  than  in  the  laser  arm.  The  data  were 
analysed by a Bayesian statistical model for the FAS, and the estimated response probability (median 
of the posterior distribution) was 85.5% of subjects in the aflibercept arm and 82.1% subjects in the 
laser  arm.  90%  credible  intervals  are  provided  for  the  probability  of  response.  As  the  90%  credible 
interval for the treatment difference does not exclude -5%, the pre-defined success criterion was not 
met and noninferiority of aflibercept compared to laser treatment could not be concluded, although the 
aflibercept  arm  numerically  showed  slightly  better  outcomes.  The  posterior  probability  that  the 
response  probability  for  aflibercept  is  greater  than  the  one  for  laser  minus  5  percentage  points  was 
88.4%. 
A sensitivity analysis was performed using the central reading center assessments. Using the Bayesian 
model, the estimated response probability (median of posterior distribution) for subjects with absence 
of active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes at 24 weeks was 80.9% in the aflibercept arm and 
77.5%  for  subjects  in  the  laser  arm.  Based  on  the  reading  center  assessments,  92  (63.0%)  of  total 
146 eyes in the aflibercept treatment arm and 53 (73.6%) of total 72 eyes in the laser treatment arm 
had absence of active ROP and unfavourable structural outcome. 
Results of secondary objectives 
A  second  treatment  modality  for  ROP  was  either  rescue  treatment  as  defined  in  the  protocol  or  any 
other surgical or non-surgical treatment for ROP (e.g. IVT anti-VEGF injection, ablative laser therapy, 
cryotherapy, or vitrectomy) after study start.  
Requirement for intervention with a second treatment modality from baseline to week 24

Using  a  Bayesian  model,  the  estimated  probability  (median  of  posterior  distribution)  for  subjects  to 
require an intervention with a second modality from baseline until week 24 was 7.2% in the aflibercept 
arm and 9.6% in the laser arm.  Of the 75 aflibercept subjects in the FAS, 71 (94.7%) subjects had 2 
eligible  eyes  for  the  analysis  and  4  (5.3%)  subjects  had  1  eligible  eye.  After  bilateral  treatment  with 
aflibercept,  intervention  with  a  second  treatment  modality  was  given  to  7  subjects.  After  unilateral 
treatment, no subjects required intervention with a second treatment modality. 
Of  the  38  laser  subjects  in  the  FAS,  34  (89.5%)  subjects  had  2  eligible  eyes  for  the  analysis  and  4 
(10.5%)  subjects  had  1  eligible  eye.  After  bilateral  treatment  with  laser,  intervention  with  a  second 
treatment  modality  was  given  to  5  subjects.  After  unilateral  treatment,  no  subjects  required 
intervention with a second treatment modality. 
Recurrence of ROP from baseline to week 24 
Recurrence of ROP until week 24 was defined as the need for retreatment or rescue treatment in cases 
where  the  question  “presence  of  active  ROP  requiring  treatment”  had  been  previously  answered  by 
investigators  with  “no”.  Using  a  Bayesian  model,  the  estimated  probability  for  subjects  to  have  a 
recurrence of ROP from baseline until week 24 was 16.1% in the aflibercept arm and 6.3% in the laser 
arm. Of the 75 aflibercept subjects in the FAS, 71 (94.7%) subjects had 2 eligible eyes for the analysis 
and  4  (5.3%)  subjects  had  1  eligible  eye.  12  (16.0%)  subjects  had  recurrence  in  both  eyes  after 
bilateral  treatment  with  aflibercept  and  8  (10.7%)  subjects  had  recurrence  in  1  eye  after  bilateral 
treatment. No subject had a recurrence in their treated eye after unilateral treatment. Of the 38 laser 
subjects in the FAS, 34 (89.5%) subjects had 2 eligible eyes for the analysis and 4 (10.5%) subjects 
had  1  eligible  eye.  Two  (5.3%)  subjects  had  recurrence  in  both  eyes  after  bilateral  treatment  with 
laser,  and  2  (5.3%)  subjects  had  recurrence  in  1  eye  after  bilateral  treatment.  No  subject  had  a 
recurrence in their treated eye after unilateral treatment. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and immunogenicity results 
In the clinical development program of aflibercept for the treatment of ROP, pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
immunogenicity  data  were  derived  from  a  total  of  75  subjects  treated  with  aflibercept  0.4  mg  per 
eligible eye at baseline of Study 20090, mostly injected bilaterally on the same day. 
Concentrations  of  free  and  bound  aflibercept  were  listed  by  sample  time  point  throughout  the 
treatment  period  and  summarized  by  descriptive  statistics  overall  and  by  the  subgroups  baseline 
weight  (<  1000  g,  1000  g  to  <  1500  g,  1500  g  to  <  2000  g,  2000  g  to  <  2500  g,  and  ≥  2500  g), 
gender,  race  (Japanese  vs.  Non-Japanese),  gestational  age,  oxygen  supplementation  at  baseline, 
history  of  sepsis,  history  of  necrotizing  enterocolitis,  and  history  of  intraventricular  hemorrhage. 
Relevant information on medical history and medication during pregnancy, relevant medication during 
the breastfeeding period and feeding type was also collected. 
Mean  concentrations  of  free  (pharmacologically  active)  aflibercept  declined  until  week  4  after  dosing 
(mean concentration of 133 ng/mL at week 4), and declined further thereafter to values below or close 
to the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) within approximately 8 weeks after start of treatment. Over 
time,  with  decreasing  concentrations  of  free  aflibercept  (binding  to  VEGF  by  aflibercept’s  mode  of 
action), levels of bound aflibercept increased up to week 4, and declined thereafter as well. 
Exploratory  sub-population  analysis  revealed  no  relevant  effects  on  free  or  bound  aflibercept 
concentrations  with  respect  to  baseline  body  weight,  gestational  age,  gender,  region  (Japanese  vs. 
Non-Japanese),  race,  oxygen  supplementation  at  baseline,  history  of  sepsis,  history  of  necrotizing 
enterocolitis,  and  history  of  intraventricular  hemorrhage.  Subjects  with  the  highest  concentrations  of 
free  and  bound  aflibercept  had  AEs  representing  medical  events  expected  in  a  population  of  preterm

infants.  There  was  no  indication  that  subjects  with  higher  individual  concentrations  have  clusters  of 
AEs, beyond those caused by the underlying condition of prematurity. 
Effects on blood pressure 
Blood  pressure  (BP)  was  considered  a  marker  of  potential  systemic  anti-VEGF  effects.  BP  was 
measured  prior  to  blood  collection,  and  if  possible,  prior  to  any  other  intervention,  with  a  completely 
automated  device,  appropriate  for  use  in  infants,  from  screening  up  to  week  24  (visit  14  /  end  of 
study). Any relationship of aflibercept  plasma concentrations to blood  pressure was evaluated for the 
first 4 weeks after start of treatment. Mean values of systolic BP (SBP) were similar in both treatment 
arms  at  baseline  (aflibercept  arm:  76.4  mmHg;  laser  arm:  75.4  mmHg)  as  well  as  at  week  24 
(aflibercept  arm:  86.7  mmHg,  laser  arm:  88.8  mmHg).  Over  the  study  duration  of  24  weeks,  there 
was an increase of approximately 10 mmHg in the aflibercept arm and approximately 14 mmHg in the 
laser arm, reflecting body weight gain and organ development. Mean values of diastolic BP (DBP) were 
similar in both treatment arms at baseline (aflibercept arm: 44.1 mmHg and laser arm: 44.9 mmHg) 
as  well  as  at  week  24  (aflibercept  arm:  51.6  mmHg  and  laser  arm:  52.5  mmHg).  Over  the  study 
duration of 24 weeks, there was an increase of approximately  8 mmHg in both arms, reflecting  body 
weight gain and organ development.   
Exploratory  analysis  of  the  influence  of  gestational  age  on  the  change  from  baseline  in  SBP  and  DBP 
revealed no relevant differences between aflibercept and laser treatment. Similarly, the relationship of 
baseline body weight (BW) and change from baseline in SBP and DBP revealed no relevant differences 
between  aflibercept  and  laser  treatment.  Exploratory  analyses  showed  that  plasma  aflibercept 
concentrations were not related to changes in SBP or DBP.  
In  summary,  considering  the  challenging  measurement  conditions  in  the  neonatal  intensive  care  unit 
setting,  a  high  variability  of  BP  values  was  observed  in  both  treatment  arms.  The  increase  of  blood 
pressure  over  time  is  considered  to  be  reflective  of  organ  maturation  and  body  weight  gain  in  the 
range  expected  for  this  population  of  premature  infants.  No  discernible  differences  between  the  two 
treatment arms were noted.  
Immunogenicity 
One subject had a treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody (ADA) development of low titer; neutralizing 
ADAs were negative. The ADA development did not appear to affect efficacy and safety in this subject 
(treatment responder). 
Safety results 
Ocular AEs 
Overall,  43 patients  (38.1  %)  experienced  ocular  AEs,  with  no  clinically  relevant  differences  between 
treatment  groups.  The  most  frequent  ocular  AE  overall  was  retinal  hemorrhage  (aflibercept  6.7%  vs 
laser  13.2%),  retinal  detachment  (aflibercept  5.3%  vs  laser  5.3%),  conjunctival  hemorrhage 
(aflibercept 5.3% vs laser 0%), and eyelid oedema (aflibercept 2.7%; laser 7.9%) in the eye disorders 
System  Organ  Class  (SOC);  and  conjunctivitis  (aflibercept  4.0%,  laser  10.5%)  in  the  infections  and 
infestations SOC 
Overall,  9 patients  (4.1%)  experienced  at  least  one  ocular  SAE.  There  were  no  clinically  relevant 
differences  between  treatment  groups.  The  most  frequent  ocular  SAE  was  retinal  haemorrhage 
(10 patients,  8.8  %)  (6 patients,  2.8  %  overall).  The  most  common  related  ocular  AE,  conjunctival 
haemorrhage, occurred more frequently with aflibercept compared to laser (4 patients (5.3 %) in the 
aflibercept  0.4 mg  group  versus  0 patients  (0%)  in  the  laser  group).  All  other  related  ocular  AEs

occurred  with  low  incidences  (< 3  %  overall)  and  in  comparable  proportions  of  patients  across 
treatment groups. 
The  majority  of  ocular  AEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity;  severe  ocular  AEs  were  reported  for 
5 patients (6.7 %) in the aflibercept group, and 4 patients (10.5 %) in the laser group. The proportion 
of subjects reported with ocular SAEs was 13.3% in the aflibercept arm and 7.9% in the laser arm, and 
the proportion of subjects with ocular TESAEs was 8.0% and 7.9%.

Non-ocular AEs 
Overall, the non-ocular (systemic) TEAEs were more frequent in the laser arm (aflibercept 52.0% vs. 
laser  63.2%);  the  systemic  events  reflected  the  underlying  prematurity  of  the  study  population  with 
typical comorbidities in both treatment arms. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  reported  with  systemic  SAEs  was  lower  in  the  aflibercept  arm  (24.0%) 
compared to the laser arm (36.8%). The proportion of subjects with systemic TESAEs was also lower in 
the aflibercept arm (6.7%) compared to 18.4% in the laser arm. 
There were 3 subjects (2.7%), in the aflibercept arm with a fatal outcome of AEs related to pulmonary 
complications  of  preterm  birth,  assessed  as  unrelated  to  the  study  treatment  all  of  which  occurred 
approximately  4  to  9  weeks  after  the  final  study  treatment.  One  subject  in  the  aflibercept  arm  had 
non-neutralizing,  low  titer  (1:30)  anti-drug  antibodies  at  week  12;  this  subject  was  a  treatment 
responder. 
There was no association of aflibercept treatment and increased blood pressure or proteinuria.  
Overall,  the  observed  AE  profile  was  consistent  with  those  reported  with  the  IVT  administration  of 
aflibercept throughout its clinical development program in adults. Most AEs can be attributed to the IVT 
injection procedure, the patient population, or the progression of the underlying disease being treated. 
The safety data in Study 20090 are consistent with the established safety profile of aflibercept and no 
new safety concern was identified.  
2.3.3.  MAH’s discussion on clinical aspects 
Efficacy 
Aflibercept was efficacious in the treatment of ROP. Patients treated with aflibercept 0.4 mg were more 
likely  to  achieve  treatment  success  (defined  as  absence  of  active  ROP  and  absence  of  unfavourable 
structural  outcomes  in  both  eyes  24  weeks  after  the  first  study  treatment)  compared  with  laser 
therapy,  which  can  be  considered  clinically  relevant  even  though  the  primary  endpoint  did  not 
demonstrate statistical significance. 
In a sensitivity analysis where missing outcomes of active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes 
at  Week  24  were  imputed  from  the  results  observed  at  the  Week  20  visit,  treatment  success  was 
statistically  significantly  higher  for  aflibercept  0.4  mg  when  compared  with  laser  (85.5%  vs  82.1 %). 
However, non-inferiority of IVT aflibercept therapy to conventional laser therapy was not demonstrated 
(90%  credible  interval  for  treatment  difference  was  −8.0%  –  +16.2%;  the  posterior  probability  that 
the  response  rate  for  aflibercept  is  greater  than  the  one  for  laser  minus  5  percentage  points  was 
88.4%, i.e. below 95%). 
Other  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  also  in  favour  of  aflibercept  treatment.  Among  the  patients 
receiving aflibercept 0.4 mg at Baseline, 7.2 % needed additional intervention with another treatment 
modality  and  4.8%  patient  had  unfavourable  structural  outcomes  at  Week  24;  these  unfavourable 
structural outcomes are associated with poor vision in the long term and thus important predictors of 
the  vision.  In  contrast,  among  the  patients  receiving  laser  treatment  at  Baseline,  9.6  %  required 
intervention  with  another  treatment  modality,  and  6.9  %  had  unfavourable  structural  outcomes  at 
Week 24. 
The proportion of patients with recurrence of ROP, as defined as any post-baseline study intervention 
up to 24 weeks after initial treatment, was higher in aflibercept groups than in the laser group (16.1% 
vs. 6.3 %).

This  may  be  explained  as  laser  photocoagulation  therapy  is  known  to  destruct  peripheral  tissue 
responsible  for  continuous  elevation  of  VEGF.  Hence  it  is  hypothesised  that  laser  photocoagulation, 
albeit unable to inhibit existing excessive VEGF and therefore having a slower onset, may minimise the 
risk  of  ROP  recurrence  at  the  cost  of  an  increased  risk  for  less  favourable  structural  and  visual 
outcome. 
Safety 
The incidence of ocular and non-ocular AEs and SAEs was generally balanced across treatment groups. 
The only PT consistently reported at a higher incidence in the aflibercept groups than in the laser group 
was  conjunctival  haemorrhage.  None  of  the  events  of  conjunctival  haemorrhage  was  severe  in 
intensity or considered an SAE. 
Apart  from  conjunctival  haemorrhage  (5.3  %  overall),  very  few  AEs  were  suspected  by  the 
Investigator  to  be  related  to  study  treatment  or  procedure  (13.3 %  overall  for  ocular  AEs,  0.5 %  for 
non-ocular AEs). 
Non-ocular  AEs  and  SAEs  were  generally  typical  comorbidities  in  preterm  infants,  and  no  clinically 
relevant differences were seen between treatment groups. 
No significant new safety concern emerged from this study. 
Conclusions 
Aflibercept 0.4 mg was an efficacious treatment for preterm neonates with ROP; patients treated with 
aflibercept 0.4 mg were more likely to achieve treatment success compared with laser therapy, which 
is considered clinically relevant. 
Aflibercept treatment is safe and well tolerated in patients with ROP. The observed safety profile was 
as  expected  in  a  preterm  population,  and  ocular  AEs/SAEs  were  generally  consistent  with  the 
established profile for aflibercept in adults. 
Considering  the  results  of  the  study  and  the  high  unmet  medical  need  for  new  treatment  options  for 
ROP  patients,  Bayer  AG  intends  to  submit  a  Type  II  variation  to  reflect  the  study  results  in  the  EU 
SmPC. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH submitted the results of the FIREFLY study, an open-label, randomized, two–arm, controlled 
trial  to  assess  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  intravitreal  aflibercept  compared  to  laser 
photocoagulation in patients with retinopathy of prematurity. This study is part of clinical development 
programme and was carried out according to the Paediatric Investigation Plan of EYLEA. 
FIREFLEYE  study  follow  the  several  points  discussed  and  agreed  in  the  PIP,  such  as:  indication, 
population,  criteria  of  participation  in  the  study,  endpoints,  number  of  patients  (102  in  total)  and 
duration of the treatment. Regarding the study design, discussions were held on the number of arms 
(which differed from the RAINBOW study) and dose proposed. Following exchanges, the PDCO agreed 
with  2  arms  (aflibercept  0.4  mg  and  laser).  Furthermore,  the  MAH  agreed  with  the  PDCO  on  the 
participation of all eligible patients in a follow-up study (not part of the PIP) until they are 5 years of 
age  to  assess  ocular  effects  (including  those  related  to  IVT  administration),  clinical  and 
neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
As the conclusion of the PIP, the MAH has commit to:  
• 
develop  or  identify  an  accurate  application  device  to  ensure  accuracy  for  administration  of  10

microliters. 
• 
provide  data  at  the  time  of  marketing  authorisation  application  on  structural  abnormalities  at  1 
year  of  chronological  age  (estimated  to  occur  approximately  9  months  after  treatment)  from  at 
least 50% of the subjects 
Overall,  the  FIREFLY  study  has  been  conducted  in  compliance  with  the  PIP  as  agreed  by  the  PDCO. 
However, the efficacy and safety data will be assess by the CHMP Rapporteur at the time of the Type II 
variation to extent the indication of EYLEA to the treatment of patients with ROP. Thus, at this stage, 
no conclusion on the benefice/risk balance can be drawn. 
  Fulfilled: 
No further action required in the frame of this variation, however, the MAH should commit to submit 
this variation application by 31 November 2021.

A new indication is proposed for Kadcyla, as a single agent, for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with 
HER2-positive early breast cancer who have invasive residual disease, in the breast and/or lymph nodes, 
after neoadjuvant taxane-based and HER2-targeted therapy. 
The  amount  of  residual  disease  is  an  important  prognosis  factor  assessed  after  neoadjuvant  systemic 
treatment.  Patients  with  early  breast  cancer  with  residual  invasive  tumour  are  patients  who  had  not 
achieved  pathological  complete  response  (pCR)  in  the  breast  and/or  axillary  lymph  nodes  following 
Assessment report  
EMA/652550/2019 
Page 7/117 
 
  
  
 
 
 
completion of preoperative systemic therapy. Pathologic complete response is defined by the absence of any 
residual  invasive  cancer  on  hematoxylin  and  eosin  evaluation  of  the  resected  breast  specimen  and  all 
sampled ipsilateral lymph nodes following completion of the neoadjuvant systemic therapy (ypT0/cis ypN0). 
According to the ESMO Clinical practice guideline, the Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) is the preferred method 
for quantifying residual disease in clinical trials although other methods can be used according to regional 
preference. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Breast cancer was the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world and the most commonly 
diagnosed cancer among women with 2.09 million new cases and approximately 627,000 deaths in 2018 
(IARC Breast Cancer 2018). This is a disease affecting 10%–12% of women worldwide (Benson et al. 2009). 
In 2018, the estimate of breast cancer incidence was 522,513 and the estimate of breast cancer mortality 
was 137,707 in Europe (GLOBOCAN, Breast cancer 2018). 
The main screening tool consists in mammography sometimes combined with magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) (e.g. in women with familial history of breast cancer). Its introduction together with the ageing of the 
population has made the incidence of breast cancer increase.  
Genetic predisposition, exposure to oestrogens, ionising radiation, low parity, high breast density and a 
history of atypical hyperplasia are important risk factors to develop breast cancer in women. In men, breast 
cancer is rare (1% of cases) and important risk factors consist in clinical disorders carrying hormonal 
imbalances (especially gynaecomastia and cirrhosis), radiation exposure, a positive family history and 
genetic predisposition (ESMO guideline).  
Biologic features 
Approximately 15%−20% of human breast cancers overexpress the human epidermal growth (HER) 
factor−2, a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, because of an amplification event in the gene encoding 
HER2 on chromosome 17. HER2-positive breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. There is concurrent 
expression of oestrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PgR) in nearly 50% of patients.  
The vast majority of breast cancer cases in male patients are ductal invasive carcinomas of the luminal-like 
type. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Clinical examination, imaging and pathological assessment are combined for diagnosis. Staging is based on 
the AJCC TNM staging system. The expression of ER/PgR, HER2 and proliferation markers (e.g. Ki67), the 
number of involved regional lymph nodes, tumour histology, the size, grade and the presence of peritumoral 
vascular invasion are important prognosis factors in early breast cancer. The ipsilateral breast recurrence 
risk is also related to the status of the surgical margins and the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) 
for patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT) (ESMO Guideline, 2019).  
Without  treatment,  HER2  overexpression  is  associated  with  aggressive  tumour  growth  and  poor  clinical 
outcomes (Slamon et al. 1987; Slamon et al 1989; Wolff et al. 2007; Chia et al. 2008; Ross et al. 2009). 
Ten-year   survival   of   breast   cancer   exceeds   70%   in   most European regions (Allemani C et al. 2013). 
Despite  the  use  of  trastuzumab-based  therapy  in  the  EBC  setting,  approximately  15%  to  25%  of 
HER2-positive patients will eventually have breast cancer recurrence.   
Management 
Loco-regional  surgery,  radiotherapy  (RT)  and  systemic  anti-cancer  treatment  (chemotherapy,  endocrine 
therapy, targeted therapy) combined with supportive measures are part of the treatment algorithm for early 
breast  cancer.  Tumour  biology,  tumour  burden,  patient  characteristics  and  preferences,  and  predicted 
sensitivity to treatment(s) are factors to be considered when deciding on the use of (neo)adjuvant therapies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/652550/2019 
Page 8/117 
 
  
  
 
Between 60% and 80% of newly diagnosed cancers are amenable to breast conservation (wide local excision 
and RT) at diagnosis or after primary systemic therapy.  
Endocrine therapies are used in all luminal-like cancer. The use of chemotherapy depends on several factors 
as mentioned above and sensitivity to chemotherapy has been shown to depend on intrinsic phenotype such 
as HER2-positive (when combined with anti-HER2 therapy) and TNBC.   
The  use  of  adjuvant  trastuzumab  in  HER2-positive  (HER2+)  early-stage  breast  cancer  (EBC)  improves 
patient outcomes as shown in several large, randomized trials. The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate 
for patients receiving trastuzumab in these studies, all of whom had operable disease, was approximately 
85% to 90% (Romond et al. 2005; Piccart-Gebhart 2005; Slamon et al. 2011). The most frequently used 
regimens  contain  anthracyclines  and/or  taxanes,  although  in  selected  patients  cyclophosphamide/ 
methotrexate/5-fluorouracil (CMF) may still be used (ESMO Guideline).  
A  variety  of  trastuzumab-based  chemotherapy  regimens  are  considered  effective  for  the  treatment  of 
non-metastatic  HER2+  breast  cancer.  These  include  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide  followed  by  a 
taxane  (docetaxel  or  paclitaxel)  plus  trastuzumab  (AC-TH);  docetaxel,  carboplatin,  and  trastuzumab 
(TCbH); and 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide in sequence with docetaxel plus trastuzumab 
(FEC-TH or THFEC). Additionally, pertuzumab, another anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, has been approved 
in  combination  with  trastuzumab  and  chemotherapy  for  the  neoadjuvant  (NEOSPHERE  and  TRYPHAENA 
trials) and adjuvant (APHINITY trial) of patients with “high-risk” early HER2+ breast cancer (EPAR Perjeta). 
For patients with operable EBC, it has been shown in several randomized trials that neoadjuvant treatment 
results  in  survival  outcomes  similar  to  adjuvant  therapy,  with  the  added  benefit  of  improving  breast 
conservation rates. The ESMO guideline recommends a neoadjuvant approach in subtypes highly sensitive 
to ChT, such as triple-negative and HER2-positive, in tumours >2 cm. 
It has also been shown that patients who achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) (defined as no 
invasive disease both in the breast and axilla), after neoadjuvant treatment have an improved prognosis 
compared  with  those  who  have  residual  invasive  disease  present  in  the  surgical  specimen  (non-pCR) 
(Rastogi et al. 2008). Although there are only limited data for neoadjuvant therapy conducted exclusively in 
patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, in general, pCR rates of approximately 40%–60% have been 
observed, and patients who attain a pCR have a more favourable prognosis than those who have residual 
invasive disease (Buzdar et al. 2005; Gianni et al. 2010; von Minckwitz et al. 2012; Cortazar et al. 2014). 
A  meta-analysis  of  neoadjuvant  studies  by  Loibl  et  al.  evaluated  the  prognostic  value  of  pCR  in  662 
HER2-positive patients who had received trastuzumab. With pCR defined as no invasive or non-invasive 
residual disease in the breast or lymph nodes, there was a significant benefit in OS for attainment of pCR (p 
< 0.0001). Therefore, the absence of pCR after appropriate neoadjuvant therapy allows identification of a 
patient population at higher risk of disease recurrence. This is a clinical setting where the application of more 
effective  therapies  would  have  a  potentially  large  absolute  impact  on  patient  outcomes  and  can  be 
considered an area of unmet medical need. 
It is recognized that HER2-positive patients without pCR after neoadjuvant treatment are at increased risk 
of recurrence. Until recently these patients were recommended to receive the same adjuvant therapies as 
would be used for any patient with HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of surgical findings, that is, to 
complete 12 months of treatment with trastuzumab (SmPC Herceptin).  
Furthermore,  neratinib  has  recently  been  approved  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  early-stage 
hormone receptor positive HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer and who are less than one year 
from the completion of prior adjuvant trastuzumab based therapy and is recommended for use in clinical 
guideline albeit at the cost of significant toxicity mostly diarrhoea (EPAR Nerlynx).

For  male  patient,  tamoxifen  is  the  standard  adjuvant  systemic  therapy  when  of  luminal-like  type  while 
chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy indications and regimens should follow the same recommendations as 
those for breast cancer in female patients (ESMO Guideline). 
2.1.1.  About the product 
Trastuzumab emtansine (also known as ado-trastuzumab emtansine, T-DM1, Kadcyla) is an antibody-drug 
conjugate  (ADC),  specifically  designed  for  the treatment of  HER2+  breast  cancer.  It is  composed  of  the 
following  components:  trastuzumab,  a  humanized  antibody  directed  against  the  extracellular  region  of 
HER2; DM1, an anti-microtubule agent derived from maytansine; and a thioether linker molecule used to 
conjugate  DM1  to  trastuzumab.  Trastuzumab  emtansine  (from  now  on  Kadcyla)  binds  to  HER2  with  an 
affinity similar to that of unconjugated trastuzumab. It is hypothesized that after binding to HER2, Kadcyla 
undergoes receptor-mediated internalization, resulting in intracellular release of DM1 and subsequent cell 
death. DM1 is an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization; it binds to tubulin competitively with vinca alkaloids. 
Kadcyla  as  monotherapy  was  approved  in  November  2013  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
HER2-positive,  unresectable  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  who  had  previously  received 
trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination.  
Because Kadcyla has shown activity in patients who have previously progressed after chemotherapy and 
HER2-directed therapy in the metastatic setting, there was a rationale to explore whether there may be a 
benefit of administering Kadcyla to patients with HER2-positive EBC who have not had an optimal response 
to standard neoadjuvant treatment regimens. 
The present application is to extend the indication of Kadcyla to the adjuvant treatment of HER2+ early 
breast cancer patients  based on the primary analysis of efficacy and safety data from the pivotal study 
KATHERINE,  a  phase  III,  two-arm,  randomised,  multicentre,  open  label  trial  comparing  Kadcyla  versus 
trastuzumab  as  adjuvant  therapy  in  patients  with  HER2+  EBC  who  have  received  preoperative 
chemotherapy  and  HER2-targeted  therapy  including  trastuzumab  followed  by  surgery,  with  a  finding  of 
residual invasive disease in the breast or axillary lymph nodes. 
In  addition,  supportive  safety  data  from  the  Phase  II  study  TDM4874g/BO22857  (designed  primarily  to 
assess safety, with a focus on cardiac events) are provided.  Study TDM4874g/BO22857 was a Phase II, 
multicentre, multinational, single arm, open label trial to assess the clinical safety and feasibility of Kadcyla 
given  sequentially  after  anthracycline-based  chemotherapy,  as  adjuvant  or  neoadjuvant  therapy  for 
patients with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer.  
The claimed indication was as follows: Kadcyla, as a single agent, is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of 
adult patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who have residual disease, in the breast and/or lymph 
nodes, after pre-operative systemic treatment that included HER2-targeted therapy. 
The recommended indication is as follows: Kadcyla, as a single agent, is indicated for the adjuvant treatment 
of adult patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who have residual invasive disease, in the breast 
and/or lymph nodes, after neoadjuvant taxane-based and HER2-targeted therapy (see SmPC section 4.1). 
The recommended dose of trastuzumab emtansine is 3.6 mg/kg bodyweight administered as an intravenous 
infusion every 3 weeks (21-day cycle).  
Patients should receive treatment for a total of 14 cycles unless there is disease recurrence or unmanageable 
toxicity.  
Patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine should have HER2 positive tumour status, defined as a score 
of 3 + by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or a ratio of ≥ 2.0 by in situ hybridization (ISH) or by fluorescence in 
situ hybridization (FISH) assessed by a CE-marked In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) medical device. If a CE-marked 
Assessment report  
EMA/652550/2019

IVD is not available, the HER2-status should be assessed by an alternate validated test (see SmPC section 
4.2). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The predicted use of trastuzumab emtansine is not expected to increase due to the present type II variation, 
as this particular patient group is already included in the original refined Fpen, and will lead to worst-case 
PECs in surface waters and sewage treatment that are far below regulatory thresholds and levels of potential 
risk. As the PECsurfacewater for both T-DM1 and MCC-DM1 have been determined to be smaller than the 
0.01 μg/L threshold as well as the logKow for MCC-DM1 was smaller than the 4.5 limit, there is no need for 
any further studies on environmental safety. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application.  
This new indication does not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of 
trastuzumab emtansine.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above data, trastuzumab emtansine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. Any 
unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements 
(see SmPC section 6.6).

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
During the course of Study BO29738, one or more PK samples were collected from 428 patients in the 
trastuzumab emtansine arm and 405 patients in the trastuzumab arm. Patients who received 3.6 mg/kg of 
trastuzumab emtansine intravenously every 3 weeks had a mean Cycle 1 maximum serum concentration 
(Cmax) of trastuzumab emtansine of 72.6 (± 24.3) µg/mL, respectively. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Following trastuzumab emtansine administration, Cmax and Cmin of trastuzumab emtansine conjugate in 
Study BO27938 were comparable to PK data from Study TDM4370g/BO21977 (EMILIA) at Cycle 1 and at 
steady state. Consistent with PK data from Study TDM4370g/BO21977, repeated dosing of trastuzumab 
emtansine on a q3w regimen did not result in any noticeable accumulation of trastuzumab emtansine 
conjugate. Similarly, no difference in serum total trastuzumab and plasma DM1 Cmax or Cmin was observed 
between Study BO27938 and Study TDM4370g/BO21977. There is no evidence of plasma DM1 accumulation 
following repeat dosing of trastuzumab emtansine. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis suggested no difference in trastuzumab emtansine exposure based 
on disease status (adjuvant vs. metastatic setting).

Study KATHERINE (Study BO27938) 
KATHERINE (Study BO27938) is a Phase III, two-arm, randomised, multicentre, multinational, open label 
study in patients with HER2-positive primary breast cancer who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
and  HER2-targeted  therapy,  including  trastuzumab, followed  by  surgery,  with a  finding  of  pathologically 
documented residual invasive disease in the breast or axillary lymph nodes.

•  Documentation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) serologies. 
•  HER2+ breast cancer:  
o  HER2-positive status was defined as an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 3+ and/or positive by 
in situ hybridization (ISH) prospectively and centrally confirmed on pretreatment biopsy material.  
ISH positivity was defined as a ratio of ≥ 2.0 for the number of HER2 gene copies to the number of 
signals  for  chromosome  17  copies.    A  central  laboratory  performed  both  IHC  and  ISH  assays; 
however,  only  one  positive  result  was  required  for  eligibility  into  the  study.  In  the  event  that 
sufficient material from the pretreatment biopsy was not available, central HER2 determination for 
eligibility on residual tumor tissue from the time of definitive surgery was allowed. Patients with 
synchronous bilateral invasive disease were eligible provided both lesions were HER2-positive.  
o  The tumor had to be histologically confirmed invasive breast carcinoma  
o  Clinical stage at presentation of T1–4, N0–3, M0 (Note:  Patients with T1a/bN0 tumors were not 
eligible). 
o  Prior  to  enrollment,  patients  had  to  have  completed  preoperative  systemic  chemotherapy  and 
HER2-directed  treatment  (patients  may  have  received  more  than  one  HER2-directed  therapy).  
Systemic  therapy  must  have  been  completed  preoperatively  and  consist  of  at  least  6  cycles  of 
chemotherapy, with a total duration at least 16 weeks, including at least 9 weeks of trastuzumab 
and at least 9 weeks of taxane based chemotherapy.  Within these criteria: 
 
 
Patients  may  have  received  an  anthracycline  as  part  of  preoperative  therapy  in  addition  to 
taxane chemotherapy. Patients with cumulative doses of anthracyclines exceeding pre-specified 
levels  were  not  eligible:  Doxorubicin  >  240  mg/m2;  Epirubicin  or  Liposomal 
Doxorubicin-Hydrochloride  (Myocet)  >  480  mg/m2;  For  other  anthracyclines,  exposure 
equivalent to doxorubicin > 240 mg/m2. 
Patients receiving dose-dense chemotherapy regimens were eligible, provided at least 8 weeks 
of taxane-based therapy and at least 8 weeks of trastuzumab were given.  A dose-escalated 
(225  mg/m2  once  every  2  weeks  [q2w])  dose-dense  regimen  of  paclitaxel  over  6  weeks  is 
allowed. 
o  Patients had to have undergone surgery resulting in removal of all clinically evident disease in the 
breast and lymph nodes. This entailed either a total mastectomy with no gross residual disease at 
the margin of resection, or breast-conserving surgery with margins of excision being histologically 
free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).  If pathologic examination demonstrated 
tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures could be performed to obtain clear 
margins.  If this did not result in complete removal, the patient must undergo total mastectomy to 
be eligible.  Patients with margins positive for LCIS were eligible without additional resection. 
o 
o 
In case of positive results from biopsies of axillary lymph node(s) performed prior to preoperative 
therapy,  additional  surgical  evaluation  of  the  axilla  following  preoperative  therapy  was  required, 
unless  only  micrometastases  were  present  in  sentinel  nodes  preoperatively  (i.e.,  if  the  greatest 
diameter of the nodal metastasis in a sentinel node is 0.2 mm or less), then no additional surgical 
evaluation of the axilla is required. 
If  sentinel  node  biopsy  performed  either  before  or  after  preoperative  therapy  was  negative,  no 
additional  surgery  evaluation  of  the  axilla  was  required.  If  the  only  sentinel  node  identified  by 
isotope scan was in the internal mammary chain, surgical evaluation of the axilla was recommended. 
If  sentinel  node  biopsy  performed  after  preoperative  therapy  was  positive,  additional  surgical 
evaluation of the axilla was also recommended.  Lastly, axillary dissection in the absence of sentinel 
node evaluation was permitted after preoperative therapy.

• 
The  patient  had  to  have  pathologic  evidence  of  residual  invasive  carcinoma  in  the  breast  or  axillary 
lymph  nodes  following  completion  of  preoperative  therapy.    If  invasive  disease  was  present  in  both 
breasts,  residual  invasive  carcinoma  had  to  be  present  in  at  least  1  breast  or  axillary  lymph  node 
postoperatively. 
The patient’s hormone receptor positivity status must have been determined, by either known positive 
ER or known positive PgR status; hormone receptor-negative status must be determined by both known 
negative ER and known negative PgR. 
Eligible patients had to be enrolled with no more than 12 weeks between the date of primary surgery and

Treatments 
Patients should have received their first dose of study treatment the day of randomization if possible, but no 
later than five business days after randomization.  
Kadcyla arm: Kadcyla was administered on Day 1 of a 3-week cycle at the approved dose of 3.6 mg/kg IV. 
The total dose was calculated based on the patient’s weight on Day 1 of (or up to 3 days before) each cycle 
with no upper limit. Changes in weight of <10% from baseline did not require dose recalculation. 
Trastuzumab arm: Trastuzumab was administered on Day 1 of a 3-week cycle at a maintenance dose of 6 
mg/kg  IV.  A  loading  dose  of  8  mg/kg  was  required  if  >  6  weeks  had  elapsed  since  the  prior  dose  of 
trastuzumab. 
Patients received study treatment for a total of 14 cycles; treatment was discontinued prior to 14 cycles in 
the event of disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or study termination by the Sponsor. Patients who 
discontinued  Kadcyla  could  have  completed  the  duration  of  their  study  therapy  with  trastuzumab  if 
appropriate based on toxicity considerations. 
Concomitant therapy 
Although  one  inclusion  criterion  stated  the  requirement  of  an  International  normalized  ratio  (INR)  and 
activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  (aPTT)  ≤  1.5  x  ULN,  patients  under  anticoagulant  or  antiplatelet 
therapy were allowed to participate. Patients on anti-coagulant treatment should have had their platelet 
count monitored closely during treatment with trastuzumab emtansine. 
Radiotherapy and/or hormonal therapy (for patients with hormone receptor-positive tumours) concurrent 
with study treatment was administered if indicated. 
Criteria for dose modification or withdrawal from treatment: 
Kadcyla could be reduced by a maximum of 2 dose levels, to 2.4 mg/kg, according to the dose-modification 
guidelines.

Table 2: Dose reduction for trastuzumab emtansine - Study KATHERINE 
Dose delays of up to 42 days from the last administered dose were permitted. After appropriate recovery 
from  an  adverse  event,  Kadcyla  could  have  been  resumed  with  one  dose  level  reduction  (e.g.,  Kadcyla 
reduced from 3.6 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg or from 3 mg/kg to 2.4 mg/kg). For patients who had an event while 
being  treated  with  Kadcyla  2.4  mg/kg,  study  treatment  was  discontinued.  The  dose  of  Kadcyla,  once 
reduced, could not be re-escalated.  
There were no dose reductions permitted for trastuzumab. 
Prior treatment: 
Patients must have completed neoadjuvant systemic treatment consisting of at least 6 cycles with a total 
duration  of  at  least  16  weeks,  including  at  least  9  weeks  of  trastuzumab  and  at  least  9  weeks  of 
taxane-based  chemotherapy  (or,  if  receiving  dose-dense  chemotherapy  regimens,  at  least  6-8  weeks  of 
taxane-based  therapy  and  at  least  8  weeks  of  trastuzumab).  HER2-directed  therapy  and  chemotherapy 
could be given concurrently. Patients could have received more than one HER2-directed therapy. Patients 
could have received an anthracycline as part of neoadjuvant therapy (see also inclusion criteria). 
Objectives 
Primary  efficacy  objective:  To  compare  invasive  disease-free  survival  (IDFS)  in  patients  with  residual 
invasive  breast  cancer  after  treatment  with  preoperative  chemotherapy  and  HER2-directed  therapy 
including trastuzumab followed by surgery between the two treatment arms. 
Secondary efficacy objectives: To compare IDFS including second non-breast cancers, DFS, OS, and distant 
recurrence-free interval (DRFI) between the two treatment arms. 
Safety objectives: To compare cardiac safety and overall safety between the two treatment arms according 
to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.0. 
PRO objectives: To compare Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) between the two treatment arms using the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire – Core 
30 (QLQ-C30) questionnaire and Quality of Life Questionnaire – Breast Cancer (QLQ-BR23) module. 
PK objectives: To characterize the PK of Kadcyla (including total trastuzumab and DM1) in Kadcyla treated 
patients;  To characterize the PK of trastuzumab in trastuzumab-treated patients and permit an intra-study 
comparison of trastuzumab exposure in the two treatment arms; To investigate exposure–effect (efficacy 
and safety) relationships in this patient population. 
Exploratory  objectives:  To  assess  correlations  between  biomarker  status  and  efficacy  and/or  safety;  To 
assess the incidence of anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) and the effect of ATAs on PK, safety, and efficacy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was invasive disease free survival (IDFS) defined as the time 
between randomization and date of first occurrence of any one of the following IDFS event: 
Assessment report  
EMA/652550/2019 
Page 17/117 
 
  
  
 
 
- Ipsilateral invasive breast tumour recurrence (i.e., an invasive breast cancer involving the same breast 
parenchyma as the original primary lesion) 
- Ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer recurrence (i.e., an invasive breast cancer in the axilla, 
regional lymph nodes, chest wall and/or skin of the ipsilateral breast) 
-  Distant  recurrence  (i.e.,  evidence  of  breast  cancer  in  any  anatomic  site  other  than  the  two  above 
mentioned sites that has either been histologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed as recurrent invasive 
breast cancer) 
- Contralateral invasive breast cancer 
- Death attributable to any cause including breast cancer, non-breast cancer or unknown cause (but cause 
of death should be specified if at all possible).  
Key secondary endpoints:  
• 
IDFS including second primary non-breast cancer (IDFS-SPNBC): defined the same way as IDFS for the 
primary  endpoint  but  including  second  primary  non-breast  invasive  cancer  as  an  event  (with  the 
exception of non-melanoma skin cancers and carcinoma in situ [CIS] of any site)  
•  Disease-free survival: defined as the time between randomization and the date of the first occurrence of 
an  invasive  disease-free  survival  event  including  second  primary  non-breast  cancer  event  or 
contralateral or ipsilateral DCIS 
•  Overall survival (OS): defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause  
•  Distant  recurrence-free  interval  (DRFI):  defined  as  the  time  between  randomization  and  the  date of 
distant breast cancer recurrence  
Patient-Reported Outcome analyses: 
HRQOL data were captured using the following questionnaires: the European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment  of  Cancer  (EORTC)  Quality  of  Life  Questionnaire-Core  30  (QLQ-C30),  Quality  of  Life 
Questionnaire-Breast Cancer 23 (QLQ-BR23), and the EuroQoL EQ-5D-3L. 
Safety reporting and analysis: 
Safety analyses were performed on the safety-evaluable population. The safety of trastuzumab emtansine 
was  assessed  through  treatment  exposure,  summaries  of  AEs,  SAEs,  cardiac-specific  AEs,  LVEF 
measurements, and laboratory test results (including thrombocytopenia and transaminases). The specific 
safety outcome measures assessed, as specified in the protocol, included: 
• 
• 
• 
Incidence, type and severity of all AEs based on NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (including incidence and type of 
Grade≥3 AEs) 
Incidence, type, and severity of SAEs 
Incidence and type of AEs leading to dose discontinuation, modification, or delay 
•  Cause of death on study 
•  Abnormal laboratory values 
• 
LVEF decreases 
•  Cardiac  events,  defined  as  death  from  cardiac  cause  or  severe  CHF  (NYHA  Class  III  or  IV)  with  a 
decrease in LVEF of ≥10 percentage points from baseline to an LVEF of <50%.

For classification purposes, lower level terms were assigned by the Sponsor to the original terms entered on 
the  CRF,  using  the  most  up-to-date  version  of  the Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA 
21.0)  terminology  for  adverse  events  and  diseases  and  the  [Roche  INN  (International  Non-proprietary 
Name) Drug Terms and Procedures Dictionary for medications and treatments. 
Biomarkers assessment: 
Mandatory tumor tissue samples were collected for biomarker analysis after central HER2 testing for 
eligibility. HER2-positive BC was defined in the study by an IHC score of 3 + or gene amplified by ISH as 
defined by a ratio of ≥ 2.0 for the number of HER2 gene copies to the number of chromosome 17 copies. In 
addition, tumor tissue samples were used in the analysis of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase catalytic subunit 
alpha isoform (PIK3CA) mutation status. 
The analysis methods for these biomarkers were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions as 
follows: 
• HER2 IHC was measured using Pathway HER2 (4B5) IHC assay (Ventana). 
• HER2 ISH was measured using INFORM Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail (Ventana). 
• PIK3CA mutations in exons 1, 4, 7, 9 and 20 in DNA were analyzed using the commercially available cobas 
PIK3CA Mutation Test (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) and the cobas z 480 analyzer (Roche Molecular 
Systems Inc.). 
Sample size 
The sample size of the study was primarily driven by the analysis of IDFS.  To detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 
0.75 in IDFS (a 6.5% improvement in 3-year IDFS from 70% in the control arm to 76.5% in the Kadcyla 
arm), approximately 384 IDFS events were required to achieve 80% power at a 2-sided significance level of 
5%.  Approximately 1484 patients were planned to be enrolled in the study. 
The study was expected to be fully enrolled around 35 months after the first patient enrolled in the study 
(FPI). The final IDFS analysis will be performed after approximately 384 events have occurred, which is 
projected to be approximately 64 months from FPI. 
With  the  study  sample  size  of  1484  patients  and  approximately  10  years  of  follow  up  from  the  date  of 
randomization of the first patient, this study had approximately 56% power to detect a HR of 0.8 in OS (a 
2.8% improvement in 3-year OS from 85% in the control arm to 87.8% in the Kadcyla arm) at a two sided 
significance level of 5%. 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  by  a  permuted  block  randomization  scheme  to  one  of  the  two 
treatment arms (trastuzumab or Kadcyla) through use of the IVRS/IWRS. Randomization was stratified by 
the following stratification factors: 
•  Clinical stage at presentation: inoperable (Stage T4NxM0 or TxN2–3M0) versus operable (Stages T1-3 
N0 to 1 M0) 
•  Hormone receptor status: ER or PgR positive versus ER and PgR negative/unknown 
• 
• 
Preoperative  HER2-directed  therapy:  trastuzumab  versus  trastuzumab  plus  additional  HER2-directed 
agent(s) 
Pathologic nodal status evaluated after preoperative therapy: node positive versus node negative/not 
done.

Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations: 
Two analysis populations were used for the analysis of data from this study: 
• 
• 
The randomized patient population included all patients who were randomized to the study, regardless 
of whether they received any study treatment. 
The safety-evaluable population included all randomized patients who received any amount of study 
treatment. 
Analyses of demographics and other baseline information were based on the randomized patient population, 
and per treatment assigned by the IVRS/IWRS. 
The randomized patient population was to form the basis for all efficacy analyses. In all efficacy analyses, 
following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were to be included in the treatment group to which they 
were randomized by the IVRS/IWRS. 
All safety analyses were performed on the safety-evaluable population and were based on actual treatment 
received. Specifically, a patient was included in the Kadcyla arm in safety analyses if the patient received any 
treatment with Kadcyla, regardless of the initial treatment assignment by IVRS/IWRS. 
Efficacy analyses/endpoints: 
Primary endpoint, IDFS: 
The  log-rank  test,  stratified  by  the  protocol-defined  stratification  factors,  was  planned  to  compare  IDFS 
between the two treatment arms. The unstratified log-rank test results were also planned as a sensitivity 
analysis. If, at the time of analysis, the smallest stratum was < 5 patients in either arm and it was considered 
that robust stratified analyses cannot be conducted, the unstratified analysis was to be used as the primary 
analysis. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the HR between the 2 treatment arms 
and its 95% CI, and the unstratified analysis was considered the primary result. The Kaplan-Meier approach 
was used to estimate 3-year IDFS rates and corresponding 95% CIs for each treatment arm. 
IDFS-SPNBC  and  DFS  were  secondary  endpoints  and  served  as  the  sensitivity  analyses  for  the  primary 
analysis  of  IDFS.  Additional  sensitivity  analyses  to  assess  the  robustness  of  the  primary  endpoint  IDFS 
included the following: 
•  Censoring  patients  at  the  time  they  started  a  new  anti-cancer  therapy  before  experiencing  an  IDFS 
event. This included patients who continued on trastuzumab after discontinuation of Kadcyla before 14 
cycles  without  experiencing  an  IDFS  event.  For  these  patients,  data  were  censored  at  the  time  of 
initiation of trastuzumab treatment. 
•  Censoring patients at the time they discontinued study treatment due to any reason before experiencing 
an IDFS event. This included patients who continued on trastuzumab after discontinuation of Kadcyla 
before 14 cycles without experiencing an IDFS event. For these patients, data were censored at the time 
of last Kadcyla treatment. 
Secondary endpoints: 
Secondary endpoints were analyzed in a similar manner as the primary endpoint to estimate 3-year event 
rates (and 5-year survival rate for OS) for each treatment arm and the HR between the two treatment arms 
Assessment report  
EMA/652550/2019 
Page 20/117 
 
  
  
 
with  95%  CI.  A  testing  hierarchy  was  used  to  control  the  overall  type  I  error  rate  at  5%.  The  formal 
hypothesis testing of OS was planned to be performed when the primary endpoint IDFS reached statistical 
significance. 
Censoring: 
For the analyses of IDFS, IDFS including second primary non-breast cancer, DFS and DRFI, data for patients 
who do not experience an event will be censored at the date they are last known to be alive and event free. 
Data for patients who are randomized without any post-baseline assessments will be censored at the date of 
randomization plus 1 day.  
For the analysis of OS, data for patients who are alive at the time of the data cutoff will be censored at the 
last date they were known to be alive. Data for patients who are randomized without any post-baseline 
information will be censored at the date of randomization plus 1 day. 
Efficacy analyses timings: 
One interim analysis and one final analysis of IDFS were planned. The interim efficacy analysis of IDFS was 
planned after 257 (67%) of the targeted 384 IDFS events had occurred. At this interim analysis, IDFS was 
tested  at  the  significance  level  determined  using  the  Lan-DeMets  alpha  spending  function  with  an 
O’Brien-Fleming stopping boundary (p < 0.0124 or observed HR < 0.732) so that the overall 2-sided type I 
error rate would be maintained at the 5% level for the IDFS primary endpoint if needed. 
Table 3: Summary of planned analyses of invasive disease-free survival - Study KATHERINE 
The interim analysis was to be performed by the iDCC statistician and the results were to be presented to the 
iDMC by the iDCC statistician. The purpose of the interim analysis was to evaluate whether there was an 
overwhelming difference in the efficacy observed in the Kadcyla arm compared with the trastuzumab arm in 
terms of IDFS. The study was to continue until 10 years of follow-up and IDFS analysis to be updated when 
384 IDFS events have occurred. 
Three formal interim OS analyses and one final OS analysis were planned as shown in the table below. The 
first OS interim analysis was to be performed at the time of the interim IDFS analysis. The second interim OS 
analysis was to be performed at the time of the final IDFS analysis (when 384 IDFS events have occurred), 
followed by the third OS interim analysis at approximately 2 years (88 months from FPI) after the second OS 
interim analysis. The final OS analysis was to be performed at the end of 10 years of follow-up.

Table 4: Summary of planned analyses of overall survival - Study KATHERINE 
The overall type I error was controlled at 0.05 for the formal OS interim analyses and final OS analysis using 
the Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming boundary. The boundaries used at each 
interim and final OS analysis depend on the timing of the analyses and the number of death events actually 
included in the analyses. 
Subgroup analyses: 
Subgroup analyses of IDFS and OS were to be performed based on age, race, stratification factors, and other 
potential baseline prognostic factors as appropriate. 
PRO: 
Summaries  of  the  compliance  rates  by  treatment  arm  were  provided  at  each  assessment  time  point  as 
specified  in  the  protocol.  Compliance  rate  was  defined  as  the  number  of  patients  who  completed  each 
assessment (i.e., at least 1 item has been answered on the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23) divided by the total 
number of eligible patients at that time point according to protocol specified assessment schedule. 
For scoring of the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires, if more than 50% of the constituent items were 
completed, a pro-rated score was computed consistent with the scoring manuals and validation papers. For 
subscales with less than 50% of the items completed, the subscale was considered to be missing. Summary 
statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and range) of absolute scores and 
change  from  baseline  scores  of  the  QLQ-C30  and  QLQ-BR23  subscales  were  summarized  at  each 
assessment time point for the two treatment arms. Only patients with a baseline assessment and at least 
one post-baseline assessment were included in this analysis. 
The  proportion  of  patients  that  experienced  a  clinically  meaningful  deterioration  (or  worsening)  in 
symptoms, in their function, or in GHS/HRQoL were summarized, and the difference in proportions between 
treatment arms was evaluated with chi-squared statistical analysis. 
Assessment  of  clinically  meaningful  deterioration  in  symptoms  (score  decrease)  and  functions  (score 
increase) was based on the published thresholds reported by Cocks et al. 2012 for each applicable subscale. 
Specifically, the score increase for each symptom scale reported and used was ≥15 points in constipation or 
diarrhea,  ≥14  points  in  appetite  loss,  ≥11  points  in  dyspnea,  nausea/vomiting,  or  pain,  ≥10  points  in 
fatigue, any hair loss, or systemic therapy side effects, ≥9 points increase in insomnia. The score decrease 
for each function scale reported and used was ≥10 points in physical functioning, ≥7 points in cognitive 
functioning, and ≥14 points in role functioning. For the rest of the function and symptom scales, a ≥10 
points change was considered clinically meaningful. 
A clinically meaningful deterioration in GHS/HRQoL was defined as a score decrease of ≥10 points, based on 
the thresholds reported by both Cocks et al. 2012 and Osoba et al, 1998.

Repeated measures mixed-effects models were performed on the function scales and the GHS/HRQoL scale 
of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23. Each model had a variable for time, a variable for treatment group, 
and a variable for treatment-by-time interaction. Covariates were added as appropriate. 
Results 
Since  the  pre-specified  efficacy  boundaries  were  crossed,  the  Independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee 
(iDMC)  recommended  an  early  release  of  study  data  the  results  from  the  interim  analysis  are  now 
designated as the primary analysis of IDFS and presented below. 
Participant flow 
*One patient was randomized twice in error. The patient was first randomized to the trastuzumab arm but did not receive 
treatment. The patient was included in the trastuzumab intention-to-treat population. The patient was then randomized 
to the Kadcyla arm and treated with Kadcyla. The patient was thus included in the Kadcyla safety population (n=740) 
based on treatment actually received. This patient’s data has been analysed as follows, to ensure adherence to the 
principles of analysis populations and non-duplication of data: Data for the first assigned randomized treatment to 
trastuzumab is included in any randomized population numbers and ITT efficacy analyses, but does not contribute to any 
safety analyses; data from the same patient under their second randomization ID does not contribute to any randomized 
population numbers or ITT efficacy analyses, but are included in all safety analyses, under the Kadcyla arm. 
One patient was randomized to trastuzumab but was administered 13 cycles of trastuzumab and one cycle of Kadcyla in 
error so was included in the Kadcyla safety population.  
One patient was randomized to Kadcyla but was administered 9 cycles of trastuzumab in error and was thus included in 
the trastuzumab safety population. 
†Three of these patients are being followed for disease recurrence and survival. 
‡Two of these patients are being followed for disease recurrence and survival. 
Figure 2: Participant flow (clinical cut-off date: 25 July 2018) - Study KATHERINE 
At the CCOD of 25 July 2018, all patients had completed treatment and the majority of patients were alive 
and ongoing in the study (80.3% in the trastuzumab arm, 85.5% in the Kadcyla arm). Of those patients in 
follow-up, most patients had not yet had an IDFS reported. A total of 98 patients had died (56 [7.5%] in the 
trastuzumab arm and 42 [5.7%] in the Kadcyla arm).

Recruitment 
A total of 1925 patients with HER2-positive EBC were screened, of whom 1486 patients were randomized 
from 268 centres across 28 countries: Argentina (3 centres), Austria (4), Belgium (4), Brazil (10), Canada 
(12), China (7), Columbia (3), Czech Republic (3), France (16), Germany (47), Greece (2), Guatemala (1), 
Hong Kong (3), Ireland (6), Israel (6), Italy (19), Mexico (5), Panama (2), Peru (5), Serbia (2), South Africa 
(6), Spain (13), Sweden (3), Switzerland (2), Taiwan (5), Turkey (5), UK (14), US (60). 
First patient was randomised on 03 April 2013; last patient was randomised on 31 December-2015. Clinical 
data cut-off was on 25 July 2018. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments: 
The first version of the protocol was issued on 19 October 2012. Five amendments to the protocol have been 
made. The key changes are summarized below. 
Version 2 of the protocol (dated April 2013) made the following changes: 
•  Clarification and details of IHC and ISH assays used for determining HER2 status. 
• 
Inclusion of patients who had received dose-dense chemotherapy regimens, provided at least 8 weeks 
of taxane-based therapy and at least 8 weeks of trastuzumab had been given. 
•  Revision  of  language  to  differentiate  radiotherapy  for  T3  disease  with  and  without  lymph  node 
involvement. 
•  Recommendations for hormonal therapy were revised to allow 5 to 10 years, rather than only 5 years, 
of tamoxifen therapy as a result of changing practice guidelines. 
•  Guidelines for managing the specific adverse events of nodular regenerative hyperplasia and interstitial 
lung disease were added. For nodular regenerative hyperplasia, a new appendix for guidelines for liver 
biopsy was added. 
•  Radiotherapy-related  toxicity  was  split  into  interstitial  lung  disease  and  skin  toxicity,  in  order  to 
differentiate between radiation-induced and drug-induced toxicities. 
• 
Text  on  use  of  strong/potent  CYP3A4/5  inhibitors  was  revised  to  provide  further  instruction  to 
investigators, and remove erythromycin from the list of examples as it is only a moderate CYP3A4/5 
inhibitor, not a potent inhibitor. 
•  Suspected transmission of an infection agent by the study drug was added as an adverse event of special 
interest. 
Version 3 of the protocol (dated September 2013) made the following key updates: 
• 
The duration of patient monitoring following first dose of Kadcyla was changed from 60 minutes to 90 
minutes. 
•  Assessment  of  total  protein  at  baseline  was  added  to  the  list  of  assessments  because  it  was 
inadvertently omitted. 
•  Requirements for long-term reporting of concomitant medication, adverse events and serious adverse 
events were clarified. 
•  Detail on severe/fatal haemorrhage was added under the identified risk of hematologic toxicity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/652550/2019 
Page 26/117 
 
  
  
 
 
Protocol Version 4 (dated March 2014) introduced the following key changes: 
•  Addition of language to allow shorter duration of an escalated dose-dense administration of paclitaxel. 
• 
Inclusion  criteria  were  revised  to  clarify  that  if  pre-chemotherapy  LVEF  assessments  were  not 
conducted, the screening LVEF assessment must be at least 55% in order for the patient to be eligible. 
•  Dose modifications related to increases in AST and for thrombocytopenia were revised. Guidelines for 
Grade 1-2 pneumonitis were updated such that to require diagnosis of drug-related ILD/pneumonitis 
should lead to permanent discontinuation of Kadcyla treatment. 
Protocol Version 5 (dated July 2014) was issued rapidly after Version 4, to correct a small but significant 
error in language in the general inclusion critieria, and indicate that left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
should  be  ≥50%  prior  to  receiving  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  instead  of  after  receiving  neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy.  
A local version of the protocol was created for Argentina at Version 5, to allow for the following specific local 
requirements: 
• 
Per local regulations, pregnancy testing had to be conducted at each cycle and then at each month in the 
follow up period for 7 months. 
•  Since HIV testing was not part of standard of care, the exclusion criteria for Argentina were amended to 
include the documentation of negative HIV status prior to study entry. 
Version 6 of the protocol (dated October 2015) made the following key changes: 
•  Data that became available from the Phase III study TDM4788g/BO22589 was included. 
• 
• 
• 
The reporting of LVSD events as SAEs was clarified. 
Pregnancy  reporting  requirements  were  updated, 
in 
line  with 
the  Global  Enhancement 
Pharmacovigilance Pregnancy Program. 
The changes in the local Argentinian version of Protocol Version 6 mirrored the changes in the global 
version. 
Changes to planned analyses: 
The primary analysis to compare IDFS between the two treatment arms was planned to be a log-rank test, 
stratified by the protocol-defined stratification factors per IxRS, with the unstratified log-rank test results to 
be provided as a sensitivity analysis. However, per the SAP specifications, since the smallest stratum was 
found  to  have  <  5  patients  in  either  arm,  it  was  deemed  that  robust  stratified  analyses  could  not  be 
conducted, and thus the unstratified analysis is used as the primary analysis. In light of this, the pre-planned 
sensitivity analysis to evaluate use of stratification factors per eCRF was no longer relevant and thus was not 
performed.

Tumor prognostic characteristics including hormone receptor status (positive: 72.3%, negative: 27.7%), 
clinical stage at presentation (inoperable: 25.3%, operable: 74.8%) and pathological nodal status after 
preoperative therapy (node positive: 46.4%, node negative or not evaluated: 53.6%) were similar in the 
study arms.    
The majority of the patients (76.9%) had received an anthracycline-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
regimen. 19.5% percent of patients received another HER2-targeted agent in addition to trastuzumab as a 
component of neoadjuvant therapy; 93.8% of these patients received pertuzumab. All of the patients had 
received taxanes as part of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

ypTmic, ypT1a, ypT1b, ypT1c).  All but two of the patients with ypN0 staging had residual invasive disease 
at  primary  tumour.  These  two  patients  did  not  fill  the  inclusion  criteria  and  constitute  a  major  protocol 
violation.

Regarding HER-2 status, three samples were retested for HER2 positivity using IQFISH Dako PharmDx since 
DDISH HER2 testing from Ventana gave invalid results. Two patients were enrolled based on the Dako FISH 
results.

Table 19: Summary of IDFS reasons for censoring- Study KATHERINE 
The diverse categories of recurrence that fulfilled the definition of IDFS event were provided (see Table 18). 
In this case the earliest event was considered. The different numbers presented in Table 20 imply that some 
patients might have ascended in category because they experienced an additional IDFS event, one with a 
higher hierarchy, within 61 days of the first one. CNS recurrence was prioritised in the hierarchy above 
non-CNS recurrence in cases where the patient had both types of relapse at the same IDFS event defining 
date.  
The percentages presented in the Table 20 are calculated using the N of each arm (i.e. 743) as a 
denominator. Taking into account the possibility of additional IDFS events in the following assessment, the 
numbers of patients categorised as “contralateral breast cancer” and “death without prior event” were stable 
whereas a few patients with “locoregional recurrence” were moved to the distant recurrence categories. The 
high proportion of patients with CNS recurrence in the Kadcyla arm was maintained.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
KATHERINE is a phase III, two-arm, randomised, multicentre, open label trial comparing Kadcyla versus 
trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy in patients with HER2+ EBC who have received preoperative 
chemotherapy and trastuzumab (with or without other anti-HER2 agents such as pertuzumab) followed by 
surgery, with a finding of residual invasive disease in the breast or axillary lymph nodes. Achieving pCR 
following neoadjuvant therapy has been reported as being associated with significantly improved disease 
recurrence and survival, particularly for triple negative and HER2+ breast cancer patients (Spring et al. 
SABCS 2018; GS2-03). The defined population of the trial is supported. 
Currently, most patients with HER2+ EBC are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy + trastuzumab +/- 
pertuzumab and after surgery, they complete one year (often 14 remaining cycles) of trastuzumab +/- 
pertuzumab. The decision to add pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting often rests on a 
situation of ‘high risk of recurrence’, which has a rather broad definition, but it often encompasses either 
lymph node-positive or hormone receptor-negative disease (ESMO guideline). To date, no studies had 
addressed the particular issue of ‘high-risk’ conferred by invasive residual disease in the breast and/or 
lymph nodes.  
No new dose-response study was submitted which is considered acceptable. The dose used in study 
KATHERINE is the approved dose of Kadcyla is 3.6 mg/kg bodyweight administered as an intravenous 
Assessment report

infusion every 3 weeks (21-day cycle). This dose showed favourable benefit-risk profiles when administered 
as monotherapy in advanced HER2+ BC across Phase II and III clinical studies (see EPAR Kadcyla). 
The overall design of the trial is generally in line with the scientific advice that was given in 2011 and 
supported. The definitions of HER2 status, neoadjuvant chemotherapy + HER2-directed treatment, breast 
and lymph node surgery requirements and exclusion criteria are acceptable. However, the key inclusion 
criterion required pathologic evidence of residual invasive carcinoma in the breast or lymph nodes after 
completion of neoadjuvant therapy, entailing that patients with residual in situ disease (e.g. ypTis ypN0) 
were considered ‘low-risk’ and hence not allowed to participate. The indication wording has been revised 
accordingly.  
Although, the adjuvant scene for HER2+ EBC patients has considerably changed in the last few years, the 
control arm (trastuzumab at the approved dose every 3 weeks for 14 cycles) was deemed appropriate at the 
time when the study was designed. Permitting patients who discontinued Kadcyla because of toxicity issues 
to complete treatment with trastuzumab is endorsed. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial, invasive disease free survival (IDFS) is acceptable for the intended 
adjuvant setting of EBC. It implies the decreased likelihood of local or distant relapse and has been used in 
the past to define benefit in the adjuvant setting of EBC. According to the study protocol, the definition of 
IDFS does not follow the standardized definitions for breast cancer clinical trial endpoints in the adjuvant 
setting from the STEEP system (Hudis et al, JCO 2007). However, the possible occurrence of second primary 
non-breast cancer events was assessed both as a secondary endpoint and as a sensitivity analysis for the 
primary endpoint. The remaining exploratory, PRO, safety and secondary efficacy endpoints are considered 
acceptable. 
According to the SAP, a testing hierarchy was used to control the overall type I error, and OS would only be 
tested if IDFS were statistically significant. The MAH clarified that the formal hierarchical testing of endpoints 
refers  to  IDFS  and  OS.  IDFS  including  second  primary  non-breast  cancer,  DFS,  and  DRFI  were  also 
secondary  endpoints,  but  they  were  not  analysed  under  a  testing  hierarchy  and  therefore  did  not  have 
allocated alpha spending.  
The planning of the interim analysis is adequate. The type I error control for multiple looks for IDFS and OS 
using the Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming stopping boundary is acceptable. 
The sample size (~1484 subjects) was primarily driven by the analysis of IDFS. The study had approximately 
80% power to detect a HR of 0.75 in IDFS by observing 384 IDFS events. This is considered adequate. 
However, the study only has 56% power to detect a HR of 0.80 in OS after 10 years of follow-up from the 
date of randomization of the first patient. It is acknowledged that a study adequately powered to show 
differences in OS may not have been feasible. To assess whether the current sample size is sufficient to 
detect an overall detrimental OS effect, various OS HR scenarios were examined. The different scenarios 
indicate that a detrimental effect in OS could be detected with the current sample size. The Applicant also 
presented an updated 5-years OS rate: 88.1% (95%CI: 85.1%, 91.1%) in the trastuzumab arm and 91.1% 
(95%CI: 88.5%, 93.7%) in the Kadcyla arm, which supports the positive trend in OS observed in the 
primary analysis. 
The permuted block randomisation method is endorsed and the stratification factors used are all clinically 
relevant and hence acceptable. However, it is noticed that around 24% of patients where incorrectly 
classified in the IxRS system.  Nevertheless, the sensitivity analysis on IDFS using the eCRF stratification 
factors (instead of IxRS) was consistent with the primary analysis (data not shown). 
The study was open-label but given the significantly different toxicity profile between both drugs, the 
arguments for not performing a double-blind study were accepted by the CHMP at the time of study 
planning.

With regards to statistical methods, the use of the Cox model and the Kaplan-Meier approach to analyse the 
time to event endpoints is agreed. The fact that unstratified log-rank test was performed as part of the 
primary  analysis  because  the  smallest  stratum  had  less  than  five  patients  is  understood.  However,  the 
stratification factors were chosen by the Applicant for a reason and if any stratum had a different HR, this 
would  not  be  observed  in  the  current  analysis.  In  this  regard,  it  is  reassuring  that  departures  for  the 
proportional hazards assumption are not observed in the survival curves. 
Regarding  the  censoring  rules  for  IDFS,  data  for  those  patients  who  do  not  experience  an  event  were 
censored at the date they are last known to be alive and event-free. Data for patients who are randomized 
without any post-baseline assessments were censored at the date of randomization plus 1 day. All patients 
must be followed for approximately 10 years, regardless of treatment discontinuation. Several sensitivity 
analyses for IDFS where the censoring rules were modified were performed (data not shown). The results of 
the  sensitivity  analyses  were  concordant  with  those  presented  for  the  primary  analysis,  indicating  that 
changes in the censoring rules are negligible on the results. 
The censoring rules for OS are endorsed. The MAH also clarified the censoring rules for the secondary 
endpoints and performed several sensitivity analyses for OS and DRFI to assess the impact of the censoring 
rules (data not shown). The results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with those presented for the 
primary analysis, indicating that changes in the censoring rules were negligible on the results. No sensitivity 
analyses were presented for other secondary endpoints since there were only 12 patients with a different 
result between IDFS, IDFS including second primary non-breast cancer and DFS. 
1486 out of 1925 screened patients were enrolled into the study. The screen failure rate (23%) is acceptable 
and suggests that the recruited patients represent the target population. The reasons for screen failure were 
disclosed  and  considered  pertinent.  In  the  light  of  an  open-label  trial,  the  unbalance  in  the  number  of 
patients who were randomised but then did not receive treatment (23 patients in the trastuzumab arm and 
4  patients  in  the  Kadcyla  arm)  is  important.  However  the  numbers  are  considered  too  small  to  have  a 
relevant impact on the results. The planned 14 cycles of therapy were received by 79% of patients in the 
trastuzumab arm versus 71% in the Kadcyla arm. This difference is likely driven by the significant amount 
of patients withdrawn from treatment because of AEs: 133 (18%) in the Kadcyla arm vs. 15 (2%) in the 
trastuzumab arm. As permitted by protocol, 71 out of 212 patients who prematurely discontinued Kadcyla 
were switched to trastuzumab. Most of the switched-patients (61 out of 71, 86%) had discontinued Kadcyla 
because of AEs. 
The  overall  distribution  of  baseline  characteristics  is  balanced  between  both  arms  of  the  trial  and 
corresponds to what is expected from HER2+ EBC.  
Two  thirds  (996  out of  1486,  67%)  of  patients had ‘small’  post-neoadjuvant  tumour  sizes  (ypT0,  ypTis, 
ypTmic, ypT1a, ypT1b, ypT1c). All but two of the patients with ypN0 staging had residual invasive disease at 
primary  tumour.  These  two  patients  did  not  fill  the  inclusion  criteria  and  constitute  a  major  protocol 
violation.  The  MAH  has  provided  the  numbers  and  proportions  of  the  subcategories  from  ‘small’ 
post-neoadjuvant tumour sizes. Nearly half of the patients from the ITT were free of nodal disease (ypN0: 
679/1486, 45.7%). However, most of those ypN0 patients were also in the subcategories with ‘less’ primary 
tumour. In fact, the proportion of ypN0 decreases as the ypT category increases: ypT1mic + ypN0: 41/64, 
64.1%, ypT1a + ypN0: 169/273, 61.9%, ypT1b + ypN0: 121/190, 63.4%, ypT1c + ypN0: 184/356, 51.7%, 
ypT2 + ypN0: 127/359, 35.4%, ypT3 + ypN0: 29/108, 26.9%, ypT4 + ypN0: 1/21, 4.8%. 
The  details  of  the  treatment  the  patients  have  received  before  the  HER2-directed  adjuvant  scheme 
(neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  +  HER2-directed  treatment,  type  of  surgery,  response  after  neoadjuvant 
treatment, concomitant hormone therapy, adjuvant radiotherapy, etc.) were also well balanced between 
arms. Only 272 patients (18.3%) from the ITT population of the KATHERINE study received trastuzumab + 
pertuzumab + chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment. Although such combination was not approved at 
Assessment report  
EMA/652550/2019 
Page 59/117 
 
  
  
 
the time, it currently constitutes the preferred regimen for patients with HER2+ EBC that are to receive 
neoadjuvant therapy. 
The wording of the indication has also been amended to clearly reflect the studied population, i.e. clarifying 
the fact that both taxanes and trastuzumab were part of the neoadjuvant scheme.  
Acknowledging  the  participation  of  5  male  patients  in  the  study  and  the  targeted  nature  of  the  agent, 
extrapolation to male patients is supported.  
The protocol amendments were acceptable and none of them are considered to influence directly the efficacy 
endpoints. There was a considerable imbalance of major protocol deviations between both arms (21% in the 
Kadcyla  arm  vs.  12.5%  in  the  trastuzumab  arm)  driven  by  on-study  protocol  deviations  (11.2%  in  the 
Kadcyla arm vs. 1.2% in the trastuzumab arm). Almost all the incidences (78 out of 83) regarding this issue 
concern “dose not reduced/held per protocol”, which can be explained as dose reductions were only allowed 
in the Kadcyla arm. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Median follow up for both arms (40.9 months in the trastuzumab arm and 41.4 months in the Kadcyla arm) 
is similar and reasonable for the targeted event rate estimated for IDFS interim analysis, which had been 
planned to take place when ~67% (approximately 257 out of 384) of IDFS events had occurred, with an 
established efficacy-stopping boundary of p<0.0124 or HR<0.732. Of note, 230 (31.0%) alive patients in 
the trastuzumab arm and 202 (27.2%) patients in the Kadcyla arm from the ITT population had ≤3 years of 
follow-up on study. 
After  256  IDFS  events  at data  cut-off  25  July  2018,  the  study  has  met  its  primary  efficacy  endpoint  by 
achieving a statistically significant improvement in IDFS for Kadcyla (91 events, estimated 3-year event-free 
rate 88.3%) over trastuzumab (165 events, estimated 3-year event-free rate 77.0%), with an unstratified 
HR of 0.50 (95% CI 0.39, 0.64) and p<0.0001. Since results from this interim analysis have crossed the 
O’Brien-Fleming stopping boundary, they are now considered the primary analysis of IDFS and formal OS 
testing has been performed.  
Data from the stratified analysis (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.37, 0.62; p<0.0001) are not used because one of the 
strata had less than 5 patients. The Kaplan-Meier curves separate from the beginning and remain divergent 
for the duration of follow-up but a heavy degree of censoring is obvious as of approximately 27 months of 
follow-up. As expected, most of this censoring comes from patients who were event-free and in follow-up.  
As expected, distant recurrence was the most frequent IDFS event in both arms (66.1% of cases in the 
trastuzumab arm and 82.4% in the Kadcyla arm). Although 43 out of all 91 recurring patients in the Kadcyla 
arm  (47%)  vs.  30  out  of  165  in  the  trastuzumab  arm  (18%)  presented  CNS  recurrence  as  the  earliest 
contributing IDFS event, the total number of patients with CNS recurrence across follow up does not differ 
significantly between arms (45 in the Kadcyla arm and 40 in the trastuzumab arm). One possible explanation 
behind this difference of particular events along time is the competing risks hypothesis, by which Kadcyla 
would exhibit higher effectiveness at preventing recurrences outside of sanctuary sites (distant non-CNS, 
locoregional and/or contralateral).  
Median time to CNS recurrences on the Kadcyla arm was 17.5 months, as compared to 11.9 months in the 
trastuzumab arm. Furthermore, median time to OS event in patients with CNS-recurrence does not differ 
significantly between arms: 14.3 months in trastuzumab (21 out of 40 patients) vs. 12.5 months in Kadcyla 
(26 out of 45 patients). 
The  MAH  also  performed  a  sensitivity  analysis  that  assigns  alive-patients  with  CNS  recurrence  as  death 
events on the date of the recurrence (worst-case scenario)(data not shown), that is consistent with the first 
interim OS analysis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/652550/2019 
Page 60/117 
 
  
  
 
The IDFS advantage from Kadcyla over trastuzumab is maintained across all the subgroups analysed, in 
particular those concerning the stratification factors. Nevertheless, the degree of benefit from Kadcyla vs. 
trastuzumab in patients with small tumours (ypTmic, ypT1a, ypT1b, ypT1c) without nodal disease or with 
little  nodal  disease  (e.g.  one  or  two  positive  lymph  nodes)  cannot  be  established  due  to  the  possible 
heterogeneity of patients, which leads to low numbers and non-interpretable results.  
The “trastuzumab plus additional HER2-directed agents” subgroup included 290 patients, out of which 272 
(94%) had received pertuzumab + trastuzumab + chemotherapy, the currently preferred neoadjuvant 
regimen for HER2+ EBC. It is unlikely that the HR of that subgroup analysis would be altered if the 18 
patients who received anti-HER2 agents other than pertuzumab were excluded. 
Censoring the patients who began a new anti-cancer therapy or those who discontinued study treatment for 
any reason, as means of sensitivity analyses, did not alter the results from the primary IDFS analysis.  
Albeit not corrected for multiplicity, secondary endpoints that included other clinical situations as events 
(secondary non breast cancer for IDFS-SPNBC and DCIS for DFS) are in line with the clinical advantage from 
Kadcyla over trastuzumab.  
At  clinical  cut-off,  only  98  OS  events  (6.6%)  had  occurred  compared  to  150  deaths  estimated  to  have 
occurred at the first interim OS analysis. The 95% confidence intervals of the 3-year OS event-free rate are 
overlapping: 95.18% (93.58, 96.79) for Kadcyla and 93.59% (91.71, 95.47) for trastuzumab. Although a 
trend for improved outcome from Kadcyla over trastuzumab is maintained (unstratified HR 0.70; 95% CI 
0.47, 1.05; p=0.0848), immaturity of the data prevent a firm conclusion regarding a non-detrimental OS 
effect from Kadcyla. It is nonetheless reassuring that departures for the proportional hazards assumption 
are not observed in any of the Kaplan-Meier plots for the primary or secondary endpoints. In order to confirm 
a  non-detrimental  effect  on  OS  from  Kadcyla  in  the  targeted  population,  the  MAH  will  ensure  adequate 
post-approval follow-up of OS data from patients from the KATHERINE trial. The MAH will provide the final 
analysis post-approval as an Annex II condition (see PI, Annex II).  
Data on follow-up treatment were presented. More patients from the trastuzumab arm experienced a distant 
recurrence event (121 vs. 78 in the Kadcyla arm). Consequently, it was expected that more patients in this 
arm would receive follow-up systemic treatments (131 vs. 72 patients in the Kadcyla arm). Most patients in 
both arms went on to receive anti-HER2 antibodies [trastuzumab (63% and 49%, respectively), pertuzumab 
(36% and 15%, respectively) and Kadcyla (25% and 5%, respectively)], and other anti-HER2 drugs, such as 
lapatinib (15% and 26%, respectively). 
The study included Patient-Reported Outcome analyses. Although the instruments (EORTC QLQ-C30 and 
QLQ-BR23  selected  for  evaluating  PROs  are  considered  appropriate  for  the  target  population  and  the 
completion rates are adequate, the clinical relevance of such data from an open-label study are limited.  The 
MAH stated that mean scores of HRQoL, physical function and role function were comparable between arms 
throughout  the  course  of  treatment.  Although  the  differences  are  slight,  the  proportion  of  patients  who 
declared deterioration of functions (cognitive, physical and role) and global health status throughout the 
study was numerically higher in the Kadcyla arm. Moreover, when the percentage of patients with clinically 
meaningful deterioration is examined, differences clearly disfavor the Kadcyla arm in all subscales. When the 
number/percentage of patients with deterioration of specific symptoms is examined, appetite loss, fatigue, 
nausea/vomiting and systemic therapy side effects affect a considerably higher proportion of patients in the 
Kadcyla  arm.  This,  in  fact,  corresponds  to  the  striking  differences  seen  in  the  incidence  of 
chemotherapy-related  symptoms  (nausea, 
fatigue,  dry  mouth/stomatitis/dysgeusia,  constipation, 
peripheral neuropathy and decreased appetite) (see safety section). Furthermore, results from a series of 
specific items from the QLQ-BR23 scale have not been interpreted by the MAH: breast symptoms, upset by 
hair loss, body image, future perspectives, sexual enjoyment and sexual functioning.  Overall, the inclusion 
of the PROs results in the SmPC is not supported.

Exploratory analyses included immunogenicity assessment. With regards to ADAs, out of 720 patients 
included in the safety population of trastuzumab, only 386 were evaluable for ADAs to trastuzumab at 
baseline, with 11 positive results (2.8%). 392 patients had at least one post-dose sample available for ADA 
analysis, with 15 positive results. From these 15 patients, 13 (3.3%) were treatment-emergent (negative at 
baseline) and 2 were “treatment-enhanced” (positive at baseline, but with a ≥4-fold increase in titres). 
Out of 740 patients included in the safety population of Kadcyla, 410 patients had baseline samples, with 17 
patients who tested positive (4.1%). 401 patients gave at least one post-dose sample for ADA analysis, with 
15 positive results (14 treatment-emergent and 1 treatment-enhanced). From these 15 patients, 5 tested 
positive for neutralising antibodies (NAbs) to Kadcyla. Only 1 IDFS event has occurred in the 15 patients 
from the Kadcyla arm with ADA+ status (and none in the 5 patients with NAbs), which does not allow for any 
conclusion regarding the impact of such antibodies in efficacy. The same is true for safety: only 1 patient 
who was ADA+ and NAb+ presented a SAE of hypersensitivity (Grade 3) (see discussion on clinical safety).  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Across subgroups and diverse time-to-relapse endpoints, the overall risk of recurrence in patients with 
HER2+ EBC and residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment and surgery is significantly reduced with 
adjuvant Kadcyla as compared to trastuzumab. This beneficial effect primarily concerns the risk of 
recurrence outside of sanctuary sites (distant non-CNS, locoregional and/or contralateral), since no 
differences between arms were seen for overall CNS-recurrence event rates. Given immature OS data, 
appropriate follow-up is ensured to confirm a non-detrimental effect on OS from Kadcyla in the targeted 
population.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
PAES: In order to further investigate the efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine in the adjuvant treatment of 
adult patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who have residual invasive disease, in the breast 
and/or lymph nodes, after neoadjuvant taxane-based and HER2-targeted therapy, the MAH should submit 
the final analysis of OS from the phase 3, randomised, open-label study KATHERINE (BO27938). Due date: 
30 June 2024. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety of Kadcyla had been evaluated in 884 metastatic breast cancer patients in clinical studies before 
its approval in the EU. In this patient population: 
• 
The most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (≥25%) with Kadcyla were haemorrhage (including 
epistaxis), increased transaminases, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and headache. The majority of ADRs 
reported were of Grade 1 or 2 severity. 
• 
• 
• 
The most common serious ADRs were pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, 
constipation, diarrhoea, dyspnoea and pneumonitis. 
The  most  common  National  Cancer  Institute  -  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events 
(NCI-CTCAE)  Grade  3  or  4  ADRs  (>  2%)  were  thrombocytopenia,  fatigue,  increased  transaminases, 
anaemia, hypokalaemia, musculoskeletal pain and neutropenia. 
Thrombocytopenia,  or  decreased  platelet  counts,  was  commonly  reported  with  Kadcyla  and  was  the 
most common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation.

•  Cases  of  bleeding  events  with  a  fatal  outcome  have  been  observed.  Severe  cases  of  haemorrhagic 
events, including central nervous system haemorrhage, have been reported in clinical studies. 
To support the proposed indication of Kadcyla for the adjuvant treatment of patients with human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer (EBC) with residual invasive disease following 
completion of neoadjuvant therapy, safety data from the ongoing pivotal Phase III study KATHERINE 
(BO27938) and supplementary safety data from completed Phase II study TDM4874g/BO22857 have been 
provided (see Table 1). 
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  1460  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug  (Kadcyla  or  trastuzumab)  were 
included in the safety analysis population (720 patients in the trastuzumab arm, 740 patients in the Kadcyla 
arm).  At the CCoD of 25 July 2018, all patients had completed or discontinued treatment.

Adverse events 
Verbatim descriptions of AEs were mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (Version 
21.0) thesaurus terms and graded according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.0.  All AEs, including SAEs, AEs 
leading to death, and AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation, occurring on or after the first dose of 
study  treatment  (i.e.,  treatment-emergent  AEs),  were  summarized  by  NCI  CTCAE  grade.    For  repeated 
events of varying severity in an individual patient, the highest grade was used in the summaries. 
Cardiac  assessments:  LVEF  assessment  was  by  ECHO/MUGA,  and  was  performed  prior  to  anthracycline 
treatment, at the end of anthracycline (chemotherapy period 1) treatment, after Cycles 2 and 4 of Kadcyla, 
and  every  4 cycles  of  Kadcyla  thereafter.  Any  time  a  new  treatment  period  was  started  (e.g.,  optional 
docetaxel  or  radiotherapy),  an  ECHO/MUGA  was  obtained  before  and  after  the  new  treatment.    In  the 
follow-up phase, ECHO/MUGA was obtained every 3 months for 6 months.

Deaths and primary cause of deaths 
Table 52: Summary of Deaths by Reason for Death by Treatment Regimen (Safety Evaluable 
Patients) - Study KATHERINE 
Five  patients  died  with  reason  reported  as  "other"  (terms  reported  were  pneumonia  [n=2],  and 
cerebrovascular event [n=1] in the trastuzumab arm; cerebrovascular event with renal insufficiency [n=1] 
and death after osteosynthesis [n=1] in the Kadcyla arm). Per protocol, these were non-reportable adverse 
events because they occurred >30 days after last study treatment and were not related to study treatment 
or study procedures. 
There  was  one  fatal  AE  during  the  protocol-defined  AE  reporting  period:  intracranial  haemorrhage  in  a 
patient receiving Kadcyla.  The patient received the first cycle of Kadcyla on Study Day 1 and died on Day 32 
due to intracranial haemorrhage.  The investigator assessed the fatal intracranial haemorrhage to be related 
to Kadcyla.   
In  addition,  one  patient  in  the  trastuzumab  arm  died  due  to  encephalitis  infection.  This  event  occurred 
outside the protocol-specified reporting period for adverse events of 30 days (the patient had discontinued 
from  study  treatment  on  Study  Day  212  and  had  subsequently  received  one  dose  of  trastuzumab  as 
non-study treatment on Study Day 239), was not related to study treatment or study procedure. Therefore 
this was not reportable as an AE, but was erroneously marked as a death due to an AE on the eCRF instead 
of under “other”, and therefore appears in Table 52 under the AE category.  
This patient had neurological symptoms (disorientation and incoherent speech on Study Day 252; CT scan of 
the brain showed decrease in size, oedema of brain, and metastases (previously reported). No bleeding or 
new lesions were found. The cerebrospinal fluid was positive for herpes virus type 1 and the patient was 
diagnosed  with  encephalitis.  On  Study  Day  257,  the  patient  died  due  to  encephalitis  and  secondary 
neurological deterioration. No autopsy was performed. The physician assessed encephalitis infection to be 
not  related  to  trastuzumab,  but  related  to  disease  under  study  and  concomitant  medication 
(dexamethasone) that may have increased her susceptibility to infection. 
Selected AEs 
Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia was reported in 28.5% of patients in EBC clinical studies with trastuzumab emtansine 
and was the most common reported adverse reaction for all grades and grades ≥ 3, as well as the most 
common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation (4.2%), dose interruptions, and dose 
reductions.  
Independent of race, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 events (< 50,000/mm3) was 5.7% in patients with EBC.

Haemorrhage 
More patients in the trastuzumab emtansine arm (216 patients [29.2%]) had at least one AE in the 
hemorrhage category than in the trastuzumab arm (69 patients [9.6%]). The most commonly reported AEs 
(in at least 1% patients in either arm) were: epistaxis (3.5% for trastuzumab vs. 21.5% for trastuzumab 
emtansine), contusion (1.1% vs. 1.8%), vaginal haemorrhage (0.8% vs. 1.6%), haematoma (0.8% vs. 
1.4%), rectal haemorrhage (0.7% vs. 1.4%), menorrhagia (0.3% vs. 1.5%), mouth haemorrhage (0.1% 
vs. 1.6%), and gingival bleeding (0.1% vs. 1.2%). No patient had an AE of Grade 4 intensity in either arm. 
Two patients (0.3%) in the trastuzumab arm and three patients (0.4%) in the trastuzumab emtansine arm 
had at least one Grade ≥3 AE. A total of 4 patients (2 patients in each arm) were reported to have AEs 
resolved at CCoD. In the trastuzumab emtansine arm, one patient had a Grade 5 event (haemorrhage 
intracranial). No other events of CNS haemorrhage were reported. 
In some of the observed cases the patients had thrombocytopenia, or were also receiving anti-coagulant 
therapy or antiplatelet therapy; in others there were no known additional risk factors.

Left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 3.0% of patients with EBC, with Grade 3 or 4 in 0.5% of patients. 
28  patients  (vs.  24  in  the  Kadcyla  arm)  presented  a  significant  change  from  basal  LVEF  (defined  as  an 
absolute value <50% and decrease ≥10 points from baseline). 4 patients in the trastuzumab arm and 2 in 
the Kadcyla arm reached LVEF values <40%, all 6 of them previously treated with anthracyclines.

With regards to platelet count shifts, 87% of patients with normal baseline platelet count remained with 
normal  count  in  the  trastuzumab  arm.  Conversely,  52%  of  patients  from  the  Kadcyla  arm  with  normal 
baseline  platelet  count  underwent  platelet  count  decreases  that  re-classified  them  as  platelet  count 
decreased. 45 patients from the Kadcyla arm (6.1%) experienced clinically relevant shifts (baseline G0-1 to 
post-baseline G3-4) as compared to only 2 patients in the trastuzumab arm (0.3%).

In terms of liver enzyme shifts, adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab had minimal impact in liver enzymes. 
On the contrary, treatment with Kadcyla adversely affected their values, particularly ASAT (38 patients with 
baseline  G0-1  to  post-baseline  G2-3)  and  ALAT  (29  patients).  Of  note,  5  patients  treated  with  Kadcyla 
suffered bilirubin shifts from baseline G0 to post-baseline G3.   
Safety in special populations 
AEs by age 
The vast majority of patients (90.8%-92.2%) were below 65 years old, with a median age of 49.0 years in 
both arms. No notable clinically meaningful differences were observed and there were no major additional 
safety concerns associated with Kadcyla in patients aged 65-74.  
The number of patients ≥75 years old (N=9 total) was small. In the trastuzumab arm, 2 out of 7 patients 
≥75  years  old  experienced  at  least  one  SAE.  In  the  Kadcyla  arm,  no  patient  was  reported  to  have 
experienced any SAE in this age group. 
The incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs was similar across the treatment arms for patients between 65-74 years old. 
Further, no notable difference was observed between the age group of 40-64 years versus 65-74 years in 
terms of incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs. However, the older patients (65-74 years) in the trastuzumab arm 
tended to have numerically higher incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs than the younger patients in that treatment 
arm. 
AEs by race 
The majority of patients in this study were white (71.5% patients in the trastuzumab armand 74.2% 
patients in the trastuzumab emtansine arm, per randomized population). Overall, 8.6% of the randomized 
population was Asian. In the trastuzumab emtansine arm, the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs and SAEs was 
higher in Asian patients than in White patients: this difference was not seen in the trastuzumab arm. In the 
trastuzumab emtansine arm, the difference between the Asian and White patients in terms of SAEs and 
Grade ≥ 3 AEs was mainly due to the event of platelet count decreased (SAE: 7.8% in Asian patients vs. 
0.4% in White patients; Grade ≥ 3 AEs: 18.8% in Asian patients vs.3.1% in White patients). 
In the trastuzumab emtansine arm, a higher incidence of all Grade and Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia was 
reported among Asian patients compared with other subgroups (All Grade: White [135 patients, 24.5%] vs. 
Asian [32 patients, 50.0%] vs. Black [5 patients, 25.0%] vs. Other [39 patients, 36.8%]); Grade ≥ 3AEs: 
White [17 patients, 3.1%] vs. Asian [12 patients, 18.8%] vs. Black [2 patients, 10.0%] vs. Other [11 
patients, 10.4%]) which is consistent with previous findings. 
In the trastuzumab emtansine arm, overall there was a higher incidence of patients with at least one AE 
leading to withdrawal from the study treatment among Asian compared with other races (White [90 
patients, 16.4%] vs. Asian [20 patients, 31.3%] vs. Black [3 patients, 15.0%] vs. Other [20 patients, 
18.9%]). Similarly, a higher incidence of AEs leading to dose reduction and interruption of trastuzumab 
emtansine was reported among Asian patients compared with patients from other races.

a Patients with at least one evaluable post-treatment ADA time point were considered evaluable for an ADA response to 
trastuzumab emtansine.  
b Except for study BO27938, patients with at least one positive post-dose ADA response were considered to be ADA 
positive, irrespective of baseline status.  For study BO27938, patients with treatment-emergent responses were 
considered to be ADA positive. 
Following trastuzumab emtansine dosing, 5.1% (63/1243) of patients tested positive for anti-trastuzumab 
emtansine antibodies at one or more post-dose time points. In the Phase I and Phase II studies, 6.4% 
(24/376) of patients tested positive for anti- trastuzumab emtansine antibodies. In the EMILIA study 
(TDM4370g/BO21977), 5.2% (24/466) of patients tested positive for anti-trastuzumab emtansine

Post marketing experience 
As of 21 February 2018 (the Data Lock Point for the Kadcyla annual Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report 
[PBRER]), an estimated cumulative total of 75,448 patients have received Kadcyla in the marketed setting.  
The cumulative post-marketing data is consistent with the data submitted in previous PBRERs.  No new 
safety concerns were identified.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
To  support  the  proposed  indication  safety  data  from  the  ongoing  pivotal  Phase  III  study  KATHERINE 
(BO27938) and supplementary safety data from completed Phase II study TDM4874g/BO22857 have been 
provided  (data  not  shown).  The  safety  data  of  the  two  studies  were  not  pooled  because  of  significant 
differences  between  the  studies,  primarily  in  treatment  modalities  with  respect  to  chemotherapy  and/or 
radiotherapy given as part of the study treatment.  
Post-marketing  signal  evaluation  from  the  global  safety  database  has  confirmed  thrombocytopenia, 
hepatotoxicity  and  haemorrhage  as  Kadcyla’s  major  safety  risks.  It  must  be  emphasised  that,  to  date, 
Kadcyla has mainly been used in patients with metastatic incurable disease, i.e. in a palliative setting. The 
toxicity threshold tolerated in the palliative setting is very different from that in the adjuvant one. 
Kadcyla  as  a  single  agent  in  early  breast  cancer  was  first  evaluated  in  the  phase  II  study 
TDM4874g/BO22857, designed primarily to assess safety, with a focus on cardiac events.  There were no 
symptomatic cardiac events and the incidence and severity of thrombocytopenia and hepatotoxicity were 
similar to that from MBC studies, but haemorrhages (43.9%) and peripheral neuropathy (33%) were more 
frequent than expected (data not shown). It was nevertheless concluded that such safety results indicated 
that Kadcyla was well tolerated in the EBC setting. 
The  target  population  of  the  KATHERINE  trial  was  constituted  by  patients  already  exposed  to  cytotoxic 
chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting, nearly all suffering alopecia, fatigue and a degree of peripheral 
neuropathy, and after surgery, most of them will still face the unpleasant effects from radiotherapy and 
endocrine treatment. Safety population was constituted by 720 patients in the trastuzumab arm and 740 
patients from the Kadcyla arm. The majority of patients in the trastuzumab arm (81.0%) completed all 14 
cycles of treatment compared to the Kadcyla arm (71.4%). This considerable difference matters because 
most of the patients who prematurely discontinued Kadcyla did so because of toxic AEs: 133 (18%) in the 
Kadcyla arm vs. 15 (2%) in the trastuzumab arm. AEs from Kadcyla also led to one-level dose reductions in 
77 (10.4%) patients and two-level dose reductions in 29 (3.9%). Furthermore, 71 (9.6%) patients from the 
Kadcyla arm ended up being switched to trastuzumab. 
Overall exposure to Kadcyla in the KATHERINE trial (median number of cycles = 14) considerably exceeds 
that from the pivotal EMILIA trial (median number of cycles = 9).  
In  general,  in  safety  terms,  adjuvant  Kadcyla  compares  quite  unsatisfactorily  to  trastuzumab.  Although 
most  patients  in  both  arms  from  the  KATHERINE  study  experienced  at  least  one  AE,  the  amount  and 
proportion of ≥ G3 AEs (26% vs. 15%), serious AEs (5% vs. 1%) and AEs leading to treatment withdrawal 
(18% vs. 2%) in the Kadcyla arm is significantly higher than those at the trastuzumab arm.  
Likewise, the higher incidence of those AEs that particularly concern Kadcyla as compared to trastuzumab is 
notorious:  any-grade  hepatotoxicity  (38%  vs.  11%),  thrombocytopenia  (29%  vs.  2%),  peripheral 
neuropathy  (32%  vs.  17%),  haemorrhage  (29%  vs.  10%),  infusion-related  reactions  (8%  vs.  3%)  and 
pulmonary  toxicity  (3%  vs.  1%).  Furthermore,  Kadcyla  is  more  often  associated  to  the  occurrence  of 
typically  chemotherapy-related  symptoms  such  as  nausea,  fatigue,  dry  mouth/stomatitis/dysgeusia, 
constipation, peripheral neuropathy and decreased appetite.

For the management of ADRs, adequate dose modification guidelines for patients with early breast cancer 
have been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
The incidence of baseline peripheral neuropathy was similar in both arms (22.7% in the Kadcyla arm vs 
21.4% patients in the trastuzumab arm). In most cases, this neuropathy was attributable to neoadjuvant 
taxanes, although of course, there might be other causalities. The fact that the overall incidence of 
peripheral neuropathy is 16.9% in the adjuvant trastuzumab arm supports the hypothesis that in clinical 
practice, peripheral neuropathy symptoms tend to reduce over the course of months after chemotherapy (at 
least in a group of patients). In patients who received Kadcyla, nevertheless, the post-adjuvant incidence of 
peripheral neuropathy affects one third of the patients. Sensory/motor neuropathy is a disabling AE with 
likely chronic consequences and a detrimental impact in quality of life. Considering its overall incidence 
(29.0% in MBC and 32.3% in EBC), peripheral neuropathy has been added in the listing of ‘most common 
ADRs’ in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. Mainly Grade 1 and predominantly sensory, has been reported in clinical 
studies with trastuzumab emtansine. MBC patients with ≥ Grade 3 and EBC patients with ≥ Grade 2 
peripheral neuropathy at baseline were excluded from clinical studies. Furthermore a warning has been 
included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to reflect that treatment with trastuzumab emtansine should be 
temporarily discontinued in patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy until symptoms 
resolve or improve to ≤ Grade 2. Patients should be clinically monitored on an ongoing basis for 
signs/symptoms of neurotoxicity. 
There  were  4  cases  of  serious  hypersensitivity  in  the  Kadcyla  arm  and  none  in  the  trastuzumab  arm. 
However, in 3 of these patients the event was deemed unrelated to Kadcyla and more likely a consequence 
from antihypertensive medication. 
In  study  KATHERINE,  211  patients 
from  the  Kadcyla  arm  (28.5%)  experienced  any-grade 
thrombocytopenia. Half of the patients experienced G1 thrombocytopenia, while the remaining half had ≥G2 
events. 20% of patients experienced high-grade (≥G3) events. Most of the high-grade events (40, 95.2%) 
had resolved by the CCOD. In comparison, only 17 patients (2.4%) from the trastuzumab arm presented 
this AE. The proportion of thrombocytopenia in the supportive study was similar.  
Overall, thrombocytopenia is Kadcyla’s most common drug-specific AE (any-grade), high-grade (≥G3) AE, 
AE  leading  to  treatment  reduction  and  AE  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation.  A  significant  number  of 
haemorrhagic  events  (with  or  without  relationship  to  thrombocytopenia)  have  been  reported  in  patients 
treated with Kadcyla. A few of these bleeding events have had fatal outcomes, both in clinical trials and in 
the post-marketing routine signal detection activity. Considering thrombocytopenia and haemorrhage as 
Kadcyla’s most important adverse drug reactions, the existing warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC has been 
updated  to  reflect  that  thrombocytopenia  was  the  most  common  adverse  reaction  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation, dose reduction, and dose interruption.  
A significant number of haemorrhagic events (with or without relationship to thrombocytopenia) have been 
reported in patients treated with Kadcyla in study KATHERINE. 216 patients (29.2%) from the Kadcyla arm 
and 69 patients (9.6%) from the trastuzumab arm experienced haemorrhage of diverse categories. Most of 
these  AEs  were  low-grade  and  with  minor  clinical  implications,  but  5  patients  from  both  arms  suffered 
high-grade bleeding AEs. The proportion of haemorrhage AEs in the supportive study TDM4874g/BO22857 
was even higher: 43.9% of any-grade events. Most of the events were G1 and G2, but there were 2 patients 
with G3 epistaxis. 
It  is  noted  that  71  patients  from  the  trastuzumab  arm  and  47  from  the  Kadcyla  arm  were  taking 
anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy in Study KATHERINE. The SmPC already includes a warning about the 
added risk of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents (see section 4.4 of SmPC).  
Regarding cardiac toxicity, it has to be recalled that patients from the KATHERINE study were highly selected 
(see inclusion/exclusion criteria). The incidence of overall cardiac dysfunction was higher in the trastuzumab

arm. All 14 Grade 3 events (9 in the trastuzumab arm and 4 in the Kadcyla arm) were however resolved at 
the time of the clinical cut-off date. Symptomatic cardiac failure (NYHA III/IV) or asymptomatic decrease in 
LVEF ≥10% from baseline, as adjudicated by the Cardiac Review Committee, was also more frequent in the 
trastuzumab arm as compared with the Kadcyla arm. When these cardiac events were separated based on 
the prior use of anthracyclines, their proportion was slightly higher in patients from both arms who have 
received these cytotoxics as expected (3.5% vs. 2.1% in patients who have not). The differences between 
arms were not significant in either group (data not shown).  
As anticipated, a considerable proportion of these cardiac events occurred in the first 6 months of the study 
(63%), i.e. while the patients were still on treatment; 6 out of 46 events happened after the IDFS events and 
could have been confounded by ulterior treatments. Recovery of the LVEF occurred in 80% of the patients, 
without considerable differences between arms. Looking at the mean LVEF over time, the very subtle decline 
in LVEF occurs only in the trastuzumab arm and peaks towards end of treatment.  
The  co-primary  endpoint  of  the  supportive  study  TDM4874g/BO22857  (N=148)  was  the  rate  of  cardiac 
events within the first 12 weeks of Kadcyla treatment, but there were none observed (data not shown). 
However, there were 5 patients who presented asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction events (ejection fraction 
decreased) at any time during the study: 4 patients experienced a G2 event (3 of them recovered) and 1 
patient had a G1 event. 
Overall,  existing  risk  minimisation  activities  are  adequate  to  address  cardiac  toxicity.  A  warning  on  left 
ventricular dysfunction is already included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The rate of hepatotoxic events in the Kadcyla arm tripled that from the trastuzumab arm: 37.3% vs. 10.6%. 
G1 events were the most prevalent, but G2-3 events occurred in 85 patients (11.5%) from the Kadcyla arm 
and  12  patients  (1.7%)  from  the  control  arm.  The  most  common  any-grade  hepatotoxic  events  in  the 
Kadcyla arm were increases of ASAT (28.4%), ALAT (23.1%), alkaline phosphatase (8.2%), bilirubin (6.6%) 
and GGT (3.6%). At least for the first three events, their incidences were considerably higher than those 
reported previously for Kadcyla (N=882): 23%, 15% and 6%, respectively (EPAR). 12 patients from the 
Kadcyla arm experienced G3 hepatotoxicity events (vs. 3 in the trastuzumab arm). These AEs had resolved 
in 7 patients and were resolving in 3 at the CCOD. The other 2 patients had unresolved events, one had 
nodular  regenerative  hyperplasia  (NRH)  and  the  other  had  GGT  increased).  The  narratives  from  both 
patients  who  developed  NRH  suggest  the  AE  was  related  to  the  Kadcyla.  No  patient  fulfilled  Hy’s  Law 
laboratory criteria.  It is considered that the risk of hepatotoxicity is adequately covered in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC and in the RMP. 
In relation to pulmonary toxicity, the existing warning has been amended to cover radiation pneumonitis. 
Treatment with trastuzumab emtansine is to be permanently discontinued in patients who are diagnosed 
with ILD or pneumonitis, except for radiation pneumonitis in the adjuvant setting, where trastuzumab 
emtansine should be permanently discontinued for ≥ Grade 3 or for Grade 2 not responding to standard 
treatment (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4). Patients with dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced 
malignancy, co morbidities, and receiving concurrent pulmonary radiation therapy may be at increased risk 
of pulmonary events. 
Most of the deaths in the study were associated to progression of the underlying breast cancer (91 out of 98, 
93%). The narratives of the 5 patients who died for reasons other than breast cancer or AEs are concise and 
render unlikely the participation of trastuzumab or Kadcyla in the final cause of death. However, one patient 
died from intracranial haemorrhage after the first dose of Kadcyla.  
Regarding special populations, only 126 patients from the ITT (8.5%) were ≥65 years old, limiting a specific 
safety analysis in this age subgroup. However, the incidence of serious or ≥G3 AEs in both arms arm does 
not seem to vary significantly across age subgroups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/652550/2019 
Page 93/117 
 
  
  
 
Regarding race, 129 patients (8.7%) from the ITT of the KATHERINE trial were Asian. 32 out of 64 (50%) 
patients in the Kadcyla arm experienced any-grade thrombocytopenia (compared to 25% of white or black 
patients). The incidence of ≥G3 thrombocytopenia was also higher in Asian patients: 18.8% (vs. 3.1% of 
white patients and 10.0% of black patients). Alarmingly, 5 out of all 10 patients (50%) who experienced 
serious  thrombocytopenia  were  Asian.  The  SmPC  from  Kadcyla  already  states  that  the  incidence  and 
severity of thrombocytopenia were higher in Asian patients (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Based on the review of the data, section 4.7 of the SmPC has also been updated to reflect that trastuzumab 
emtansine has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The significance of reported adverse 
reactions such as fatigue, headache, dizziness and blurred vision on the ability to drive or use machines is 
unknown. Patients experiencing infusion related reactions (flushing, chills, pyrexia, dyspnoea, hypotension, 
wheezing, bronchospasm, and tachycardia) should be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms 
abate. 
No new study of drug-drug interaction was provided which is considered acceptable. Available information 
on drug-drug interactions is reflected in the current SmPC.  
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect updated safety information. Pulmonary toxicity and 
hepatotoxicity are known risks for trastuzumab emtansine, two new adverse drug reactions (ADRs: radiation 
pneumonitis and blood bilirubin increased) were added to section 4.8 of the SmPC to fully characterize the 
safety  profile  in  the  adjuvant  EBC  setting.  For  the  majority  of  the  ADRs,  the  frequency  categories  were 
consistent  between  the  MBC  and  EBC  settings.  The  following  ADRs  are  now  listed  in  a  lower  frequency 
category based on updated safety data: Hypokalaemia (from very common to common), Rash (from very 
common to common), Chills (from very common to common). Furthermore, a sub-section has been added 
to present information on peripheral neuropathy.  
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for an immune response to trastuzumab emtansine. 
Due to the low incidence of ADA, conclusions cannot be made on the impact of anti- trastuzumab emtansine 
antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine.  
Overall, the safety profile of trastuzumab emtansine in the proposed indication of early breast cancer is 
currently  not  expected  to  be  different  from  the  known  safety  profile  in  terms  of  type  of  adverse  drug 
reactions reported. However, the frequency and severity of Kadcyla-specific AEs are increased in EBC. The 
SmPC has been updated to reflect the safety information available in EBC and update existing warnings as 
appropriate. No additional pharmacovigilance activities were considered needed as a result of the present 
procedure (see RMP). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The frequency and severity of Kadcyla-specific AEs is increased in the EBC setting. The product information 
has  been  updated  to  inform  healthcare  professionals  about  the  major  safety  risks  derived  from 
thrombocytopenia,  haemorrhage  and  hepatotoxicity  when  considering  adjuvant  Kadcyla  in  patients  with 
HER2+ EBC and residual invasive disease. Peripheral neuropathy is not a life-threatening symptom, but its 
much higher incidence  from  Kadcyla  must be  considered,  since  this disabling adverse  effect  can  worsen 
quality of life for prolonged periods. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Assessment report  
EMA/652550/2019 
Page 112/117 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The proposed Type II variation seeks to extend the Kadcyla Marketing Authorisation to include adjuvant 
treatment for patients with HER2- positive EBC.  User consultation was conducted at the time of the initial 
marketing authorisation application for Kadcyla, approved in patients with MBC. It is reasonable not to 
conduct a User Consultation for the Package Leaflet for this variation because: 
–  No significant changes affecting the readability of the Package Leaflet have been made.  
–  The new additions follow the same structure and use similar descriptions and terminology as used in the 
approved Package Leaflet.  
–  The posology proposed in this application does not differ from that previously described; only the timing 
and duration of the treatment is different.  
–  The safety profile remaims consistent with the known profile for Kadcyla, with no new safety signals 
seen in the adjuvant setting. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH is currently seeking an extension of indication of Kadcyla for the adjuvant treatment of adult 
patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC) who have residual invasive disease, in the breast 
and/or lymph nodes, after neoadjuvant taxane and HER2 targeted therapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Preoperative chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab attains high rates of pCR and constitutes the 
standard  of  care  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  of  HER2+  EBC.  To  further  minimise  the  risk  of  relapse, 
trastuzumab is often maintained for up to a year in the adjuvant setting. Despite this progress, however, 
approximately  15%  to  25%  of  HER2-positive  patients  will  eventually  experience  local  or  metastatic 
recurrence, which calls for the identification and investigation of newer and better therapies. 
It  has  been  reported  that  achieving  pCR  following  neoadjuvant  therapy  is  associated  with  significantly 
improved disease recurrence and survival, particularly for triple negative and HER2+ BC patients. To date, 
no  specific  adjuvant  regiments  are  recommended  for  patients  with  HER2+  BC  who  did  not  achieve  a 
complete response (i.e. those with residual disease) and are thus at higher risk of disease recurrence and 
decreased survival. Therefore, this population has a high level of unmet medical need.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  application  is  based  on  efficacy  and  safety  data  from  KATHERINE  (Study  BO27938),  a  phase  III, 
two-arm, randomised, open label trial in patients with HER2+ BC with residual invasive disease in the breast 
or lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and HER2-targeted agents, data cut-off 25 Jul 2018.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
After  256  IDFS  events  (predefined  IA  by  protocol),  the  study  has  met  its  primary  efficacy  endpoint  by 
achieving a statistically significant improvement in IDFS for Kadcyla with an unstratified HR of 0.50 (95% CI 
0.39,  0.64)  and  p<0.0001.  The  efficacy-stopping  boundary  has  been  crossed  and  the  results  are  now 
considered the primary analysis. 
The  IDFS  benefit  from  Kadcyla  is  maintained  across  all  the  subgroups  analysed,  particularly  those 
concerning the stratification factors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/652550/2019 
Page 113/117 
 
  
  
 
The  lowered  risk  of  IDFS  events  from  Kadcyla  vs.  trastuzumab  seems  limited  to  recurrence  outside  of 
sanctuary  sites  (distant  non-CNS,  locoregional  and/or  contralateral),  since  no  differences  between  arms 
were seen for overall CNS-recurrence event rates. 
Albeit not corrected for multiplicity, secondary endpoints that included other clinical situations as events 
(secondary non breast cancer for IDFS-SPNBC, DCIS for DFS, distant recurrence as or beyond the earliest 
IDFS event for DRFI) support the advantage from adjuvant Kadcyla over trastuzumab.  
98  OS  events  (6.6%)  had  occurred  to  cut-off  date.  Although  OS  data  are  immature,  a  benefit  trend  of 
Kadcyla was observed.  
Sensitivity analyses (censoring patients who began a new anti-cancer therapy or those who discontinued 
study treatment for any reason) were consistent with the primary analysis of IDFS. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Albeit adjusted to the statistical plan of the trial, median follow-up (40.9 months in the trastuzumab arm and 
41.4 months in the Kadcyla arm) is certainly limited for a study in the adjuvant setting of breast cancer. In 
fact, nearly one third of alive patients from the ITT had ≤3 years of follow-up on study.  
Although  the  benefit  trend  of  Kadcyla  is  observed  in  formal  OS  testing,  the  result  is  not  statistically 
significant (unstratified HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.47, 1.05; p=0.0848). Hence, a long-term non-detrimental OS 
effect from Kadcyla cannot be yet established. To further investigate the efficacy of Kadcyla in the claimed 
indication, the MAH will provide the final analysis results by the second quarter of 2024 (see Annex II of the 
PI).   
Although  the  IDFS  forest  plot  suggests  that  the  benefit  from  Kadcyla  was  seen  across  most  stage  and 
substage  subgroups,  the high  variability  of  breast  cancer  according to  specific  staging  creates too  small 
fractions to determine the absolute benefit in patients with small residual tumours and none or little nodal 
disease, as compared to the more apparent benefit in patients with bigger tumours and/or N2/N3 stage. 
Immaturity  of  the  IDFS  data  prevents  determining  the  potential  effect  of  ADAs  on  efficacy.  The  clinical 
impact of anti-therapeutic antibodies will continue to be monitored (see RMP).  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  incidence  of  ≥G3  AEs  (26%  vs.  15%),  serious  AEs  (5%  vs.  1%)  and  AEs  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation (18% vs. 2%) in the Kadcyla arm was higher than in the trastuzumab arm. 
Kadcyla-specific AEs were expectedly more frequent than the control arm: hepatotoxicity (38% vs. 11%), 
thrombocytopenia (29% vs. 2%), peripheral neuropathy (32% vs. 17%), haemorrhage (29% vs. 10%) and 
pulmonary toxicity (3% vs. 1%). 
Certain  symptoms  typically  related  to  chemotherapy  (nausea,  fatigue,  dry  mouth/stomatitis/dysgeusia, 
constipation,  peripheral  neuropathy  and  decreased  appetite)  were  also  more  prevalent  in  the  safety 
population of Kadcyla. 
211 patients treated with Kadcyla (28.5%) experienced any-grade thrombocytopenia. Half of them (105 out 
of 211) experienced G1 thrombocytopenia, while the remaining 106 patients had ≥G2 events. High-grade 
(≥G3)  thrombocytopenia  occurred  in  42  patients  (5.7%)  and  serious  events  were  reported  in  10. 
Undoubtedly, thrombocytopenia was also the AE most frequently implied in dose interruptions (14 patients), 
dose  reductions  (23  patients)  and  permanent  discontinuations  (31  patients)  from  the  Kadcyla  arm.  The 
incidence  and  severity  of  thrombocytopenia  was  higher  in  the  Asian  subgroup  than  in  the  other  race 
subgroups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/652550/2019 
Page 114/117 
 
  
  
 
There  was  one  G5  AE  related  to  Kadcyla  in  a  patient  with  traumatic  intracranial  haemorrhage  and  G4 
thrombocytopenia. 
216 patients (29.2%) from the Kadcyla arm and 69 patients (9.6%) from the trastuzumab arm experienced 
haemorrhage  of  diverse  categories.  Most  of  these  events  were  of  low  grade  and  with  minor  clinical 
consequences, but 5 patients from both arms suffered high-grade events.  
The rate of hepatotoxic events in the Kadcyla arm tripled that from the trastuzumab arm: 37.3% vs. 10.6%. 
G2-3  events  occurred  in  85  patients  (11.5%)  treated  with  Kadcyla.  The  most  common  any-grade 
hepatotoxic events in the Kadcyla arm were increased ASAT (28.4%), ALAT (23.1%), alkaline phosphatase 
(8.2%), bilirubin (6.6%) and GGT (3.6%). 
The incidence of peripheral neuropathy, a disabling AE with likely chronic consequences and a detrimental 
impact in quality of life, in the Kadcyla arm (32.3%) nearly doubles that of the trastuzumab arm (16.9%). 
Cardiotoxicity from Kadcyla did not raise major concerns. The incidence of overall cardiac dysfunction events 
was higher in the trastuzumab arm (40 vs. 23 patients in the Kadcyla arm). 
Nearly 1 out of each 5 patients withdrew from the Kadcyla arm because of intolerable toxicity. Almost one 
quarter  of  all  discontinuations  in  the  Kadcyla  arm  were  a  result  of  thrombocytopenia:  31  events  in  133 
patients  (23.3%).  Other  AEs  leading  to  permanent  treatment  withdrawal  from  Kadcyla  were  increased 
bilirubin, ASAT increased, ALAT increased, peripheral sensory neuropathy and ejection fraction decreased. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety  analysis  in  the  ≥65-year-old  age  subgroup  was  limited  and  inconclusive  by  the  low  number  of 
patients. The use of Kadcyla in elderly patients will continue to be closely monitored (see also RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Results from the first interim analysis from the KATHERINE trial suggest that residual invasive disease can 
also be a predictive biomarker in HER2+ EBC: patients treated with Kadcyla presented an overall lower risk 
of invasive recurrence than those who received trastuzumab. 
Recurrence in the CNS, often in the form of brain metastases, is a particularly dreadful event with higher 
incidence in HER2+ and triple negative breast cancer, entailing the worst survival prognosis from all types of 
recurrence events. However, the beneficial effect from adjuvant Kadcyla seems to be exerted outside of 
sanctuary sites such as the brain. 
With this limitations and uncertainties in consideration, the overwhelming difference in acute and chronic 
toxicity between standard-of-care trastuzumab and Kadcyla must be considered. Undeniably, adjuvant 
Kadcyla was not well tolerated and compared quite unsatisfactorily to trastuzumab in safety terms, putting 
a considerable amount of patients at risk for unpleasant, disabling and even life-threatening adverse events.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
As compared to trastuzumab, Kadcyla demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction in the overall 
recurrence rate in the targeted population of the KATHERINE trial. Significant toxicity and obvious safety 
risks are observed in patients treated with Kadcyla. Nonetheless, the magnitude of clinical benefit of Kadcyla 
in the proposed patient population outweighs the observed safety concerns. Furthermore, measures are in 
place to minimise the risks as reflected in the PI and RMP. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kadcyla as a single agent, for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive 
early breast cancer who have invasive residual disease, in the breast and/or lymph nodes, after neoadjuvant 
taxane-based and HER2-targeted therapy is positive. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

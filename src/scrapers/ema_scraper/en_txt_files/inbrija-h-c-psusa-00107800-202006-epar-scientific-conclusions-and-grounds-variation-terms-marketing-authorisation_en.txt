Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for levodopa, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on the cumulative review of medication errors and commercial product quality complaints, the PRAC 
considers that the mitigation strategies in place in the US regarding the addition of a new cleaning step in 
order  to  provide  more  detailed  directions,  accompanied  by  visual  aids,  on  how  to  clean  the  inhaler 
mouthpiece as well as increase cleaning frequency should also be included in the EU product information.  
The PRAC concluded that the product information (Instruction for use and SmPC) of products containing 
levodopa should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)  
On  the  basis  of  the  scientific  conclusions  for  levodopa  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing levodopa is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to 
the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

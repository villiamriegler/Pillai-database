The CHMP adopted an extension to an existing indication as follows:2

Patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive B-precursor ALL should have failed 
treatment with at least 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and have no alternative 
treatment options. 
Blincyto is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome 
negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal 
residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1%.

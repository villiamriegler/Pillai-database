Introduction 
Obesity  is  a  disease  characterised  by  an  excess  body  fat.  It  is  often  measured  by  calculation  of  the 
body  mass  index  (BMI),  i.e.  the  body weight  in  kg  divided  by  body  surface  area  in  m2.  Individuals 
may  be  regarded as obese  with  a BMI >25-27 kg/m² (depending  on age). A  number  of concomitant 
pathological  processes  and  diseases  are  associated  with  obesity  including  coronary  heart  disease, 
hypertension,  stroke,  non-insulin  dependent  diabetes  mellitus  and  certain  forms  of  cancer.  Besides 
changes  in  diet,  behaviour  and  physical  activities,  obesity  may  be  treated  by  surgery  or 
pharmacological therapy. All currently available medicinal products for obesity treatment are appetite 
suppressants  (amphetamine-like  products)  that  act  via  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS).  However, 
they  may  not  be  prescribed  during  longer  periods  than  3  months,  due  to  the  potential  risk  of  abuse. 
Thus, there is a need for medicinal products that can be used in chronic treatment together with dietary 
and behavioural modifications.  
Orlistat  belongs  to  a  new  class  of  pharmacological  agents.  It  inhibits  the  action  of  gastrointestinal 
lipases and thereby impairs the metabolism of lipids in the intestinal lumen leading to a prevention of 
lipid absorption.  
Xenical is indicated in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric diet for the treatment of obese patients 
with a body mass index (BMI) greater or equal to 30 kg/m², or overweight patients (BMI > 28 kg/m²) 
with associated risk factors. The treatment should only be started if diet alone has previously produced 
a weight loss of at least 2.5 kg over a period of 4 consecutive weeks. Treatment with orlistat should be 
discontinued  after  12  weeks  if  patients  have  been  unable  to  lose  at  least  5%  of  the  body  weight  as 
measured at the start of drug therapy. The recommended dose of orlistat is one 120 mg capsule three 
times daily, which should be taken immediately before, during or up to one hour after each main meal.

Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Orlistat, a hydrogenated derivative of lipstatin and an inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases produced by 
chemical synthesis, is presented as Xenical 120 mg capsules in different pack sizes.  
Composition 
Xenical is presented as a conventional hard gelatin capsule (size 1) containing pellets with an active 
substance  concentration  of  50%.  The  excipients  cellulose  microcrystalline  (as  diluent  and 
extrusion/spheronisation  aid),  sodium  starch  glycollate  (as  desintegrant),  sodium  lauryl  sulphate  (as 
wetting  agent),  povidone  K30  (as  binder  and  stabiliser),  and  talc  is  added  (for  lubrication)  to  the 
pellets before encapsulation.  
Different  clinical  trial  formulae  and  dosage  strengths  were  used  during  Phase  I-III  studies. 
Bioequivalence  was  demonstrated  between  the  formulations  and  strengths  used  in  the  Phase  I-III 
studies and those proposed for marketing. 
The  different steps in  the  development  of the  marketing formulation are  well  described: satisfactory 
details have  been  provided to justify and to optimise the retained form (hard  gelatin capsules which 
fulfil the various demands, i.e. drug load, technology and compliance), the formulation (the selected 
concentration  of  each  excipients  are  correctly  fixed).  Process  development  has  also  been  well 
described and studied. 
Method of preparation 
The manufacturing process involves granulation, extrusion and spheronisation, drying, lubrication and 
encapsulation.

All  operating  procedures  comply  with  GMP.  The  choice  of  in-process  controls  and  frequency  of 
testing  ensure  that  the  process  is  controlled,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  critical  parameters.  It  is 
considered that the manufacturing process has been fully validated on both pilot and full scale batches, 
and is reproducible. 
Control of starting materials 
Orlistat is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is a lipophilic substance with very low solubility 
in water within the physiological pH range. Two polymorphic forms have been found, A and B, but 
only  B  is  produced  by  the  current  synthetic  route  as  defined  in  Part  II  of  the  dossier.  Sixteen 
stereoisomers are possible in theory, because of the four chiral centres. 
In the early phase of the development, the synthetic route evolved from an “alpha-pyrone” synthesis to 
a  “delta-lactone”  synthesis.  Pre-clinical  studies  were  performed  with  orlistat  obtained  by  these 
prototype routes. Finally orlistat, as intended for marketing, is synthesised in a 5-step process using a 
controlled stereoselective route (i.e. “the dihydropyrone” synthesis) ensuring consistent production of 
only  one  of  the  possible  stereoisomers  in  the  desired  physical  form,  B.  The  preclinical  toxicity 
programme  showed  there  were  no  significant  differences  between  the  two  polymorphs.  Four 
intermediates are isolated and controlled in this process.  
Starting material specifications, in-process control of the key intermediates and release specifications 
ensures  the  quality  and  the  stereospecificity  of  synthesis.  The  chromatograms  referring  to  the  three 
synthetic  routes  showed  that  the  level  of  impurities  in  the  chromatogram  of  “the  dihydropyrone” 
synthesis appears lower as compared to the other routes of synthesis. All raw materials and synthesis 
intermediates  are  controlled  according  to  suitable  specifications  and  using  specific  and  validated 
methods, which are chirally selective where necessary. 
Active substance 
Orlistat is tested and released according to an in-house monograph. The active substance specification 
includes tests for characterisation, identity, purity, assay, residual solvents, water, sulphated ash, heavy 
metals and others. All potential organic impurities are detected using the combined chromatographic 
systems,  HPLC/GC/TLC.  The  validation  of  the  analytical  methods  used  is  acceptable  in  relation  to 
ICH recommendations. The proposed specification limits are based on data arising from 50 pilot-scale 
and 50 clinical batches made by the dihydropyrone synthesis, and on safety studies. Results of these 
batches confirm their consistent quality. 
Other ingredients 
All  excipients  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  requirements.  The  capsule  shells  contain  commonly  used 
excipients.  The  excipients  and  colouring  agents  in  the  capsule  shell  comply  with  the  EEC 
requirements. 
The proposed standard containers are PVC/PE/PVDC/Alu blister packs, and amber glass bottles fitted 
with  a  plastic  screw  closure  and  containing  a  desiccant  unit.  Essential  verifications  have  been 
performed for all materials and test results are satisfactory.  
Control tests on the finished product 
The specification includes standard tests for appearance, identification of the active substance (IR and 
HPLC),  assay,  determination  of  degradation  impurities  (HPLC-system  I),  dissolution  test,  and  a 
periodic microbial test performed according to the Ph. Eur. requirements. The dissolution specification 
limit is 75% (Q) after 45 minutes. The limits for the total of all degradation products are set up to ≤ 
0.5%  at  release  and  2.0%  at  shelf  life.  The  proposed  specification  for  the  control  of  the  finished 
product  is  suitable  for  assessing  batch-to-batch  consistency.  Certificates  of  analysis  for  3  pilot-scale 
and  1  full-scale  production  batches  demonstrate  consistent  quality  of  the  finished  product  when 
manufactured according to the process defined in the dossier.  
Stability of the product 
The  stability  of  the  active  substance,  orlistat,  obtained  from  different  sources  has  been  investigated 
under stressed conditions as well as under accelerated and long-term conditions. The stability results 
show that a three year re-test period is acceptable when samples are stored below 30°C in perforated 
low density polyethylene (LDPE) bags in closed metal drums gassed with nitrogen. 
2/14 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
However, long-term stability studies up to 3 years duration, without gassing, are on going. Until the 
results are available, orlistat is stored in LDPE bags inside closed steel drums gassed with nitrogen.  
Stability of the finished product has been studied on 4 batches stored in both blister packs and amber 
glass bottles for up to 18 months at 25°C/60%RH and up to 12 months at 30°C/75%RH; both pilot and 
production scale batches were included. In addition, supportive stability data with clinical batches, up 
to  3  years  in  both  packaging  and  up  to  3  years  in  blisters,  were  provided.  Appearance,  impurities, 
assay and dissolution test were monitored using stability-indicating methods. For the whole shelf-life 
period,  the  assay  limits  of  orlistat  are  maintained  at  95-105%  of  the  theoretical  value,  and  the  total 
impurity limit should be set at 2.0% at shelf life. 
The  results  showed  no  change  in  the  capsules’  appearance  and  in  dissolution  rate  after  45  minutes. 
However, available stability data showed that the degradation products increased when the storage is 
carried out at 30°C/75%RH, as expected. Degradation was less in glass bottles than in blisters, and a 
higher storage temperature is therefore possible.  
These results support the shelf-life and storage conditions for Xenical capsules as defined in the SPC, 
i.e. three years when keep in a dry place and stored below 25°C in blister packs, and below 30°C in 
glass bottles with desiccant.  
3. 
Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
All  pivotal  preclinical  studies  were  conducted  in  compliance  with  GLP  and  when  applicable,  in 
accordance with internationally accepted guidelines. 
Orlistat can exist in two crystalline forms, polymorphs A and B, which have similar physico-chemical 
properties. Polymorph B is the more thermodynamically stable of the two polymorphs. It is the only 
form used in the clinical development and is the form intended for marketing. Both forms were used in 
the  preclinical  toxicity  programme,  and  there  were  no  significant  differences  between  the  two 
polymorphs. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic action of orlistat has been studied in vitro and in vivo. Studies using different 
in  vitro  enzyme  preparations  of  mammalian  source  showed  that  orlistat  was  a  specific,  long  lasting 
inhibitor  of  a  wide  range  of  tri-  and  di-acylglycerol  lipases.  However,  it  had  weak  or  no  inhibitory 
effects  on  other  hydrolytic  enzymes  (e.g.  acetylcholine  esterase,  liver  carboxylesterase,  α-amylase, 
trypsin, chymotrypsin, phospholipase A2) and it had only marginal effects on subsequent steps of fat 
absorption. In the presence of emulsified triglycerides as substrate, inhibition was mainly determined 
by the concentration of the drug in the lipid phase. After  orlistat  withdrawal, the lipase activity was 
rapidly restored due to a continuous secretion of enzymes.  
Using  in  vivo  animal  models,  a  dose  dependent  and  rapidly  reversible  inhibition  of  triglyceride 
absorption was demonstrated, with IC50 ranging from 1.4 (dog) to 67 (mouse) mg/kg body weight or 
0.8 (dog) to 2.9 (mouse) mg/g dietary fat. The highest inhibitory effect was seen when the drug was 
dissolved in dietary fat. The magnitude of inhibition did not change during long-term administration. 
Effects  on  plasma  and  hepatic  lipids  varied  between  species,  and  a  biphasic  dose  response  was 
observed,  with  hypolipidaemia  at  low  doses  (effects  on  intestinal  absorption)  and  hyperlipidemia  at 
higher doses (systemic effects).  
Studies in animal models of obesity showed dose dependent reductions of body weight and body fat 
(e.g. genetically obese mice: 17% (weight), 21% (body fat) after 114 mg/kg/d for 43 days, genetically 
obese rats 15% (weight), 24% (body fat) after 42 mg/kg/d for 77 days). However, the predictability of 
these  data  for  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  was  regarded  to  be  limited,  since  animals  compensated 
partially for the loss of dietary fat by increased food intake.  
Orlistat  administration  resulted  in  a  non-physiologic  phase  of  unabsorbed  lipids  in  the  intestine. 
Consequently,  absorption  of  apolar  lipids  was  reduced  (e.g.  lipid  soluble  vitamins,  carotenoids  and 
cholesterol) while polar lipids (fatty acids, bile acids, phospholipids and retinol) were not affected.  
3/14 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  vitro  studies  with  the  two  main  human  metabolites  (M1,  M3)  indicated  that  they  had  very  weak 
lipase inhibitory effects.  
The  general  pharmacology  program  did  not  indicate  adverse  effects  on  the  central  nervous, 
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal- or immune systems or on systemic lipase metabolism after doses that 
were considered to be therapeutically relevant.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of orlistat was studied in mouse, rat, rabbit and dog, the main species used in 
the preclinical program. In all species, absorption after oral administration of C14-labelled orlistat was 
low  (1-22%  depending  on  formulation  and  feeding  state).  Binding  to  albumin  and  lipoproteins  was 
high  (>99%)  in  all  species  including  humans.  Distribution  studies  in  rats  given  oral  doses  of 
radiolabelled  orlistat,  showed  the  highest  tissue  levels  of  drug-related  radioactivity  in  the  liver  and 
kidney after a single dose. After 30 days repeated oral administration, a 3-5 fold tissue accumulation 
was  observed  in  liver,  kidney  and  fat.  In  pregnant  rats,  no  placental  transfer  of  drug-related 
radioactivity  to  foetal  tissues  was  observed.  Excretion  into  milk  has  not  been  studied.  The  low 
absorption of orlistat together with the occurrence of first pass metabolism resulted in a very low oral 
bioavailability  (<1%),  and  thus  only  minor  amounts  of  unchanged  orlistat  reaching  the  systemic 
circulation.  
The  fraction  of  orlistat  that  is  absorbed  undergoes  extensive  metabolism,  with  similar  metabolic 
patterns in the animal species studied and in humans. The major part of an oral C14-orlistat dose was 
excreted  in  faeces  (85-99%  in  rats  and  dogs).  The  remaining  part  of  the  dose  was  excreted  in 
approximately  equal  amounts  via  urine  and  bile.  The  excretion  balance  was  similar  after  2  years 
administration of unlabelled orlistat to rats. 
Overall,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  orlistat  was  similar  in  the  animal  species  used  for  safety 
assessment and in  humans. Toxicokinetic data  from  animals given high doses  in the toxicity studies 
showed that the systemic exposure to orlistat and the two main human metabolites (M1 and M3) were 
higher than that of humans given therapeutic doses. 
Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity of orlistat after oral administration was studied in mice, rats, young rats and dogs. 
The acute toxicity was considered to be low, with no signs of toxicity after doses of 1000 mg/kg (dog, 
given  pyramiding  doses  from  50-1000  mg/kg),  2000  mg/kg  (2  week  old  rat)  and  5000  mg/kg  (rat, 
mouse).  
Repeated dose toxicity of orlistat after oral administration was studied in mice (3 months duration), 
rats and dogs (up to 12 months duration). In all species, signs of toxicity were related to exaggerated 
pharmacodynamic  responses  to  orlistat  i.e.  inhibition  of  gastrointestinal  lipases  and  at  high  doses, 
inhibition  of  systemic  lipases.  Both  rodents  and  dogs  showed  increased  food  intake  without 
concomitant increase in body weight gain. In rats given doses > 500 mg/kg/d, disturbances in the lipid 
metabolism were evident, e.g. hypertriglyceridemia, hyperbilirubinemia and hypocholesterolemia and 
histopathology showed lipidic infiltration in liver, heart, bone marrow and adrenal glands. A reduced 
absorption  of  liposoluble  vitamins  (A,  D3,  E)  was  also  evident  in  all  species.  The  24  months 
carcinogenicity study in rats showed a similar pattern of toxicity together with an increased turnover 
of  red  blood  cells  possibly  due  to  lipemia-induced  hemolysis.  In  rats  and  dogs,  the  non-toxic  dose 
levels after 12 months administration, were 125 and 300 mg/kg/d, respectively. In rats, 25 mg/kg/d for 
12 months did not affect lipid metabolism. 
Reproductive toxicity of orlistat was studied in standard segment II, III studies and I with doses up to 
400 mg/kg/d (I, III) and 800 mg/kg/d (II). Fertility studies in rats did not indicate impairment of male 
or  female  reproductive  functions.  After  administration  of  orlistat  to  rats  and  rabbits  during  the 
organogenetic period, no teratogenicity or embryotoxicity were observed. Peri-post natal exposure of 
dams and follow-up of offspring did not reveal any concern.  
In a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests, orlistat lacked genotoxic potential.  
Carcinogenicity  was  studied  in  mice  and  rats  following  2  years  of  administration.  In  these  studies, 
there  was  no  indication  of  drug-related  neoplastic  potential.  Using  a  Proliferating  Cell  Nuclear 
Antigen  test,  a  dose  and  time  dependent  proliferation  of  rectal  cells  (rats  at  500  mg/kg/d)  and  of 
4/14 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
colonic cells (male mice at 25 mg/kg/d, female mice 750 mg/kg/d) was revealed. Additional studies in 
rats  fed  a  high  fat  and  low  calcium  diet,  revealed  colonic  mucosal  proliferation  without  neoplastic 
changes  after  up  to  1-month  administration.  However,  there  were  no  orlistat-related  changes  in  the 
colonic mucosa after 3, 6 or 9 months administration.  
A number of special toxicity studies did not reveal cause for concern with respect to local tolerance or 
antigenicity.  
Summary and conclusion on preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
The  pharmacological  activity  of  orlistat  results  in  partial  inhibition  of  triglyceride  absorption  by 
reducing hydrolysis and production of absorbable unesterified fatty acids and monoglycerides. Due to 
structural  similarities with  triglycerides,  orlistat interacts  with the lipases in  a  substrate  like  manner. 
Studies in animal models of obesity showed dose dependent reductions of body weight and body fat 
although the predictability of these data for clinical efficacy and safety was considered to be limited. 
The  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  orlistat  were  similar  in  the  animal  species  used  for  safety 
assessment  and  in  humans.  Overall,  the  toxicology  program  revealed  effects  mainly  related  to  the 
pharmacodynamic action of orlistat, i.e. inhibition of lipases leading to fatty faeces, reduction of body 
weight  gain,  changes  in  triglycerides,  bilirubin  and  cholesterol,  and  reduction  of  absorption  of 
liposoluble  vitamins.  No  abnormalities  were  seen  in  reproductive  toxicity  or  genotoxicity  studies. 
Carcinogenicity studies revealed  proliferation  of rectal or colonic  mucosa, without any indication  of 
drug-related neoplastic potential.

Clinical aspects 
The  marketing  application  is  supported  by  adequately  designed  clinical  studies,  conducted  and 
analysed according to current GCP recommendations. 
The core dossier consists of seven long-term (1 to 2 years) clinical trials**. They were double blind, 
comparative (vs. placebo and different dosages), randomised, multicentre trials aimed at evaluating the 
efficacy  of  orlistat  combined  with  a  hypocaloric  diet  in  weight  reduction  and  prevention  of  weight 
regain. The effects on obesity risk factors (lipids, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and insulin), vitamin 
levels and faecal fat excretion were explored as secondary efficacy criteria.

Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics 
Orlistat  belongs  to  a  new  class  of  pharmacological  agents.  Its  mechanism  of  action  is  through  the 
inhibition of action of gastrointestinal lipase, impairing the metabolism of lipids in the intestinal lumen 
and  preventing  absorption.  Nineteen  phase  I  trials  have  been  carried  out  in  order  to  elucidate  the 
mechanism of action in humans. 
The  degree  of  inhibition  of  dietary  fat  absorption  was  measured  using  faecal  fat  excretion  in  a 
retrospective  population-based  meta-analysis.  The  activity  is  dose-dependent,  with  about  30%  of 
inhibition at the 120 mg dosage which plateaus at about 35% inhibition after doses greater than 400 
mg t.i.d.. 
In clinical trials, fat excretion was approximately 2.6 g/24 h at day 1 compared to 23 g/24 h after 1-
year  treatment  with  orlistat  120  mg  t.i.d..  The  mean  change  in  72-hour  fat  excretion  from 
randomisation to the end of week 52 was 15.4 ± 12.1 g and 20.9 ± 15.1 g, after orlistat 60 mg and 120 
mg t.i.d., respectively. 
The effect of the drug on the colon,  due to the excess of fat in faeces, was investigated in 12 obese 
patients  during  6  weeks  of  treatment  with  120  mg  t.i.d.  and  no  increase  in  cell  proliferation  was 
observed.  
Hepatobiliary physiology was extensively studied in phase I trials since the drug has been detected in 
the bile even in small amounts. It was not affected by orlistat. 
As in animal experiments the systemic absorption of orlistat is 10% or more when the drug is taken 
with food, food interaction was investigated in faze I clinical trials in healthy volunteers. No increase 
in orlistat absorption was shown when the  drug was taken with food. In addition, it was shown that 
orlistat has no effect on systemic lipase activities.  
An  effect  on  intracellular  lipases,  which  would  in  turn  affect  autacoids  production  and  could  hinder 
the digestion, was also ruled out because orlistat is minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract 
and its metabolites have poor lipase inhibitory activity. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics  was  investigated  in  31  clinical  studies  and  in  other  additional  Phase  I,  II  and  III 
studies, in which orlistat concentrations were measured. 
The  drug  is  absorbed  to  a  minimal  extent,  with  a  Cmax  in  blood  <  5  ng/ml.  The  drug  is  extensively 
bound to plasma proteins, > 99%. Absolute bioavailability was not calculated because of the lack of an 
acceptable intravenous formulation for human use. The drug is poorly excreted in urine (1.1 –4.1% of 
the dose) and extensively in faeces (> 96% of the dose total and 83% of the dose unchanged). Biliary 
concentrations of orlistat up to  43 ng/ml i.e.  much higher than plasma  concentrations  show that this 
drug  is  partially  excreted  in  the  bile  and  may  be  subject  to  enterohepatic  cycling.  Two  major 
metabolites have been identified in  plasma, M1 and  M3,  which  are  1000- and 2500-fold less  potent 
than  orlistat,  respectively.  The  elimination  half-life  for  orlistat,  although  not  accurately  measured 
because  of  the  low  plasma  concentrations,  was  estimated  to  be  <2  h;  more  than  95%  of  the 
administered dose was eliminated within 2-3 days. 
The  effect of orlistat in  special  populations (paediatric, elderly, hepatic  and  renal insufficiency) was 
not investigated because of the low systemic exposure of orlistat. No data on secretion in human milk 
were provided and, therefore, this lipophilic drug should be contraindicated in nursing mothers. 
Interaction studies 
Many drug interaction studies were undertaken to investigate the possible effect of orlistat treatment 
on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  drugs  with  a  narrow  range  therapeutic  window  and  likely  to  be 
administered concomitantly to orlistat. 
Orlistat  was  shown  not  to  alter  the  pharmacokinetics  of  digoxin,  fibrates,  phenytoin,  warfarin, 
nifedipine, alcohol and vitamin A. No interaction was noted with oral contraceptives.  
6/14 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
Pilot  studies  were  performed  to  investigate  the  interaction  of  orlistat  with  furosemide,  captopril, 
atenolol and glyburide and no pharmacokinetic alteration was seen. It has to be underlined that orlistat 
was not given at the proposed therapeutic dose and therefore no conclusions could be drawn. 
Co-administration  of  orlistat  with  pravastatin  increases  after  10  days  of  administration  by  26%  the 
Cmax and by 33% the AUC of pravastatin, which may result in an enhancement of dose related adverse 
drug  reactions.  In  absence  of  pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies,  the  concomitant  administration  of 
orlistat with fibrate, acarbose, biguanide and anorectic drugs is not recommended. 
The  impairment  of  the  absorption  of  fat-soluble  vitamins  was  investigated.  It  showed  a  non 
statistically significant decrease in fat-soluble vitamins; therefore the risk of deficiency in vitamin A 
during long-term treatment with orlistat was not considered to be relevant. On the contrary, vitamins 
D, E and β-carotene showed a statistically significant decrease after long-term treatment with the drug 
in  combination  with  a  diet.  A  slight  decrease  in  vitamin  K  absorption  might  affect  the  prothrombin 
time  and  might  be  detrimental  to  some  patients.  This  is  mentioned  in  the  special  warnings  and 
precautions for use section of the SPC.  
An interaction study was performed with cyclosporin, which showed reductions in cyclosporin plasma 
levels  when  combined  with  orlistat.  Monitoring  of  cyclosporin  plasma  levels  until  stabilisation  is 
therefore recommended in the section 4.4 of the SPC as well as in the package leaflet. 
In  January  2000,  the  section  4.4  of  the  SPC  was  updated  regarding  the  interaction  with  cyclosporin 
giving  a  recommendation  to  monitor  cyclosporin  plasma  levels  more  frequently  than  usual  when 
orlistat is co-administered and to continue this monitoring when orlistat is discontinued  
In November 2002, information was added to the section 4.5 of the SPC regarding interactions with 
other  products.  No  interaction  with  amitriptyline,  atorvastatin,  biguanides,  digoxin,  fibrates, 
fluoxetine,  losartan,  phenytoin,  oral  contraceptives,  phentermine,  pravastatin,  and  nifedipine  GITS, 
nifedipine slow release, sibutramine or alcohol have been observed. However, when given as a single 
dose,  a  small  decrease  in  plasma  levels  of  amiodarone  has  been  observed  in  a  limited  number  of 
healthy volunteers who received orlistat concomitantly. The clinical relevance of this effect in patients 
receiving  amiodarone  treatment  remains  unknown  but  may  be  of  minor  relevance,  in  patients 
receiving  concomitant  amiodarone  treatment,  reinforcement  of  clinical  and  ECG  monitoring  is 
warranted. 
Clinical efficacy 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
The efficacy of orlistat was investigated in 4 dose-ranging studies (phase II clinical trials) of 2- to 6-
months duration, comparing different doses, from 10 to 240 mg t.i.d., and in 7 long-term (1- to 2-years 
duration)  phase  III  clinical  trials.  The  latter  were  double  blind,  randomised,  multicentre,  comparing 
doses of 30, 60 and 120 mg t.i.d. versus placebo, aimed at evaluating the efficacy of orlistat combined 
with hypocaloric or eucaloric diet. All the studies were preceded by a 1-month run-in placebo period 
(except study NM 14336 with a 5 week run-in period and study NM 14302: 6-month run-in placebo) 
and were performed according to the same protocol: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Inclusion criteria - BMI value between 28 and 43 kg/m2. 
Efficacy criteria - The primary efficacy criterion was change in body weight (weight reduction 
after a 1-year treatment and prevention of weight regain during the 2nd year of treatment). The 
secondary  efficacy  criteria  were  related  to  obesity  risk  factors:  lipids  (total,  LDL,  HDL  and 
VLDL cholesterol; triglycerides); lipoprotein a, apoproteins A-1 and B; blood pressure, insulin 
and glucose; anthropometric measurements, such as waist circumference, and quality of life. 
Safety  criteria - Undesirable  effects related  to its  pharmacological effect:  decreased systemic 
absorption  of lipophilic substances, e.g. fat-soluble vitamins; impairment of calcium  and bone 
metabolism;  enhanced  faecal  fat  excretion  with  increased  amounts  of  fat  in  the  colon. 
Laboratory assessments of routine test of organs’ function. 
Diet  -  A  mild  hypocaloric  diet  (<1500  kcal/day),  containing  approximately  30%  of  calories 
from  fat,  was  prescribed  during  the  run-in  period  and  the  first  year  of  treatment  (except  for 
7/14 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
study NM14302 where an eucaloric diet was given during the 1-year treatment period), then an 
eucaloric diet was prescribed during the second year.

Results - Primary efficacy criteria 
After  randomisation,  the  placebo-treated  patients  lost  2.6  kg,  compared  to  6.1  kg  for  the  orlistat-
treated  patients  (refer  to  the  table  below  on  Primary efficacy  criteria  in  pooled  studies  over  1 year). 
The difference, calculated as least square mean difference (LSM, adjusted means on factors included 
in  the  model:  centre;  stratum  for  weight  loss  after  the  run-in  period  or  percentage  of  weight  loss; 
interaction  centre×stratum,  centre×treatment  and  treatment×stratum)  was  –3.2  kg,  and  it  was 
statistically significant (p< 0.001).

The clinical relevance of such a modest effect was questioned. After a formal request from the CPMP 
and according to the “Note for guidance on clinical investigation of drugs used in weight control”, the 
company was requested to provide the percentage of the responders, i.e. ≥ 10% loss in body weight.  
After  1  year  of  drug  treatment  (excluding  the  4-weeks  run-in  period),  8.3%  of  the  patients  in  the 
placebo and 20.2% in the orlistat 120 mg group had a body weight loss ≥10%, which was statistically 
significant.  
The  frequency  of  distribution  of  weight  loss  (≥  5%  and  ≥  10%),  after  1-year  orlistat  therapy  in 
comparison with placebo, is reported below (meta-analysis of 5 studies of the core dossier, excluding 
the  study  in  diabetic  patients).  The  calculations  were  performed  comparing  the  data  after  1-year 
treatment versus the baseline after the run-in period.

No  clinically  relevant  difference  was  seen  between  the  60  and  the  120-mg  dosages  (16.6%  versus 
20.2%  weight  loss  ≥  10%),  although  the  absolute  difference  in  weight  loss  of  0.6  kg  was  close  to 
statistical significance (p< 0.10).  
In type II diabetic patients, the percentage of responders (≥ 10% of bodyweight loss in addition to the 
diet  run-in  period)  was  9%  with  orlistat  as  compared  to  4%  with  placebo.  The  mean  difference  in 
weight loss with the drug compared to placebo was – 2.1 kg in these patients. 
The meta-analysis of mean change (LSM) in body weight (kg) from the second-year baseline to week 
104  (weight  regain  during  the  second-year  therapy  without  diet;  studies  NM14161,  BM14149, 
NM14185, BM14119C) showed that the patients in the placebo group gained +2.5 (± 4.3) kg, those in 
orlistat 60 mg t.i.d. +3.2 (± 4.3) kg and those in orlistat 120 mg gained +2.9 (± 4.5) kg. No difference 
between groups was observed. After a 6-month period of diet alone where a 10 kg-loss was observed, 
patients  regained  3.0  kg  with  orlistat  120  mg  and  5.1  kg  with  placebo  respectively  in  the  following 
year without diet (study NM14302).  
In order to select those patients likely to respond, as well as not to unduly expose patients to the drug, 
the  CPMP  requested  a  two-step  selection  of  patients.  The  patients  who,  despite  an  appropriate 
8/14

hypocaloric  diet,  were  unable  to  lose  more  than  2.5  kg  during  4  consecutive  weeks  should  not  be 
treated  (negative  predictive  value=0.90,  sensitivity=0.52  and  specificity=0.61).  After  12  weeks  of 
treatment, if the patient did not lose at least 5% of his/her body weight as measured at the start of drug 
therapy,  then  the  drug  should  be  discontinued.  These  criteria  (of  losing  at  least  5%  of  body  weight 
after  12  weeks  of 
therapy)  have  a  positive  predictive  value=0.48,  sensitivity=0.83  and 
specificity=0.77.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No  specific  effect  of  orlistat  on  obesity-related  risk  factors  was  shown  other  than  that  due  to  body 
weight loss. In the study in diabetic patients (subgroup of responders), the obesity-related risk factors 
were not modified by treatment: glucose decreased by 1.3 (± 1.2) mmol/l and 0.8 (± 1.3) mmol/l after 
1  year  treatment  with  placebo  and  orlistat  120  t.i.d.,  respectively.  Insulin  decreased  by  72.9  (±82.4) 
pmol/l  after  1  year  treatment  with  placebo  and  by  56.9  (±  57.7)  pmol/l  after  1  year  treatment  with 
orlistat 120 t.i.d.. No statistically significant difference between groups was detected. 
Supportive studies 
The  clinical  benefit,  in  terms  of  cardiovascular  parameters,  was  not  clearly  demonstrated  in  the 
responders, although a slight improvement was observed in systolic and diastolic blood pressure: -3.8 
and – 4.2 mm Hg, respectively.  
The quality of life, although subjective and difficult to interpret, seemed to improve after 1 year 120 
mg t.i.d orlistat treatment. Overweight distress, depression, satisfaction with treatment and self-regard 
improved in comparison with placebo (at least p < 0.04).

Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The  safety  assessment  was  based  on  over  4800  patients  receiving  at  least  one  dose  of  orlistat. 
Approximately  2150  patients  received  orlistat  for  at  least  one  year  and  880  for  two  years.  The  total 
percentage  of  premature  withdrawals  over  the  first  year,  whatever  the  reason,  was  35.3%  in  the 
placebo group, 25.3% in the orlistat 30-mg t.i.d., 26.0% in the orlistat 60-mg t.i.d. and 29.1% in the 
orlistat 120 mg t.i.d.. The highest number of patients who dropped out as treatment failure and were 
lost  to  follow-up  was  recorded  in  the  placebo  group,  while  the  orlistat  group(s)  had  the  highest 
incidence of patients withdrawn for adverse drug events:

Adverse events and serious adverse events/deaths 
In  the  phase  III  studies,  approximately  6%  of  the  patients  (total  number  =  2722)  reported  serious 
adverse events (AE) over one year in both orlistat (all tested dose schedules) and placebo groups. The 
body  systems  showing  the  most  serious  AEs  were:  reproductive  female  disorders,  body  as  a  whole, 
gastrointestinal  system  disorders  and  musculo-skeletal  system  disorders.  Hypersensitivity  reactions 
have been reported post marketing. 
According  to  the  mechanism  of  action  of  the  drug,  the  major  safety  concern  is  the  gastrointestinal 
tolerability of the drug, notably oily spotting from the rectum, flatus with discharge, faecal urgency, 
fatty/oil stool, oil stool, oily evacuation, increased defecation and faecal incontinence. Although they 
were rarely serious and a cause for premature discontinuation from the study, they were 10- to 20-fold 
more  frequent  with  orlistat  than  with  placebo.  The  respective  percentages  of  oily  spotting  from  the 
rectum were: 18.8% with orlistat 60 mg t.i.d., 26.6% with orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. and 1.3% with placebo; 
the respective percentages of flatus with discharge were: 18.85% with orlistat 60 mg t.i.d., 23.9% with 
orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. and 1.4% with placebo. Faecal urgency was 3 times higher in the orlistat groups: 
20.2%  with  orlistat  60  mg  t.i.d.,  22.1%  with  orlistat  120  mg  t.i.d.  and  6.7%  with  placebo.  These 
adverse  drug  reactions  (ADR)  were  dose-dependent,  higher  and  more  severe  in  comparison  with 
placebo.  
During the second year of treatment, however, the frequency of oily spotting from the rectum, flatus 
with  discharge  and  faecal  urgency  decreased  from  about  20.0%  of  the  patients  to  about  4%.  About 
15% of the patients experienced gastrointestinal ADRs which lasted for more than 4 weeks; the data 
collected  and  analysed  according  to  the  protocol  do  not  provide  sufficient  information  to  judge 
whether the  ADRs were  truly continuous  or if  they were individual  episodes  occurring  on  a  weekly 
basis. 
Overall, the gastrointestinal ADRs remain the most common ADRs. As far as the other adverse events 
recorded  during  the  clinical  trials  are  concerned,  no  difference  in  the  safety  profile  between  orlistat 
and placebo was detected and no AE seemed to be dose-related. The biological tolerability of the drug, 
tested  by  the  routine  laboratory  examinations  was  good  and  no  difference  versus  placebo  was 
observed with all the dose schedules tested. 
Ten cases of breast cancer in the orlistat groups (60 and 120 mg t.i.d. doses) versus one in the placebo 
were reported. During the evaluation phase, a follow-up survey found two new cases in the 120  mg 
group and one in the placebo group. The data provided by the company were also analysed by a panel 
of experts appointed by the company. The observed cases were not evenly distributed across studies 
and  the  histological  types  were  different.  No  predictive  elements  have  been  found  in  the  preclinical 
studies. In addition, the occurrence was too early in some cases (36 to 38 days from the beginning of 
treatment)  and  the  timing  necessary  to  development  of  the  tumor  was  not  consistent  with  drug 
exposure.  Furthermore,  direct  toxicity  is  unlikely  since  the  drug  is  negligibly  absorbed.  A  detection 
11/14 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
bias  was  ruled  out:  women  with  breast  cancer  were  not  found  having  lost  more  weight  than  those 
without  tumors.  However  to  rule  out  any  promoting  effect  of  the  drug  on  the  tumoral  growth, 
additional  data  will  be  produced  from  an  ongoing  2-year  study  in  Sweden,  which  is  expected  to 
produce data on 3350 patients (estimate end in the year 2000). The protocol foresees a mammography 
at entry, at one year, and at the end of the study. 
The possibility of colonic cancer was raised in the view of increased lipid content in the colonic fecal 
content  and  current  epidemiological  data  linking  human  colon  cancer  and  increased  fat  intake.  The 
review  of  recent  available  epidemiological  evidence  showed  that  the  relationship  between  fat  intake 
and colon cancer is doubtful. Increased energy intake was incriminated as the main risk factor whereas 
fat intake could be a confounding factor, taking into account the fact that the drug is neither genotoxic, 
nor  carcinogenic  and  that  clinical  data  in  the  exposed  population  did  not  indicate  a  risk  of  colon 
cancer.

The decreases observed were clinically relevant for β-carotene, vitamin E, and vitamin D. The decline 
in  25-OH-D  resulted  in  no  detectable  changes  in  calcium  or  bone  metabolism.  In  a  subgroup  of 
patients plasma calcium and parathyroid hormone levels showed no change (total and ionised calcium) 
or a slight decrease (parathyroid hormone), from 33.2 to 31.5 ng/l, in comparison with placebo, from 
32.5 to 31.9, remaining, however, in the reference interval (13.3-60.2 ng/l). Another evidence of the 
absence of metabolic and clinical consequences on calcium and bone metabolism was offered by the 
data  on  bone  mineral  content  and  density  performed  in  40  patients  (14  with  placebo  and  16  with 
orlistat  120  mg  t.i.d.),  which  did  show  any  difference  between  day  1  and  day  52  neither  intra-  nor 
between group. Due to these changes in vitamin D, E, and  β-carotene levels, the SPC mentions that 
multivitamin supplementation may be considered. 
Safety in special populations 
Analysis  of  estrogen  levels  resulting  from  80  postmenopausal  women  indicated  no  significant 
difference in estrogen changes from baseline for orlistat group or placebo. 
Efficacy and safety discussion 
After  1-year  treatment  with  orlistat  (120  mg  t.i.d.)  in  association  with  a  mild  hypocaloric  diet,  a 
modest  effect  of  orlistat  on  body  weight  was  observed.  The  mean  effect  at  one  year  was  –3.2  kg 
weight  loss  as  compared  to  placebo.  Patients  who  lose  more  than  10%  of  their  body  weight  were 
considered responders. Responder rates were 8% in the placebo group as compared to 20% in orlistat 
120 mg group. During the second year, orlistat associated with a eucaloric diet did not prevent weight 
regain. The drug was less effective in type II diabetes. No specific effect of orlistat on obesity related 
risk factors was shown. 
The gastrointestinal ADRs remain the most common ADRs. Due to the changes in vitamin D, E, and 
β-carotene  levels,  the  SPC  mentions  that  multivitamin  supplementation  may  be  considered.  Breast 
cancer occurrence was likely to be a chance finding. To rule out any promoting effect of orlistat on the

tumour  growth,  additional  data  are  requested  to  the  company  from  the  ongoing  2-year  study  in 
Sweden. 
Moreover, in order to select those patients likely to respond, as well as not to unduly expose patients 
to  the  medicinal  product,  the  CPMP  requested  a  two-step  selection  of  patients.  The  patients  who, 
despite  an  appropriate  hypocaloric  diet,  were  unable  to  lose  more  than  2.5  kg  over  a  period  of  4 
consecutive weeks should not be treated. After 12 weeks of treatment, if the patient does not lose at 
least  5%  of  his/her  body  weight  as  measured  at  the  start  of  drug  therapy,  then  the  treatment  with 
orlistat should be discontinued. As there are no safety and efficacy data beyond 2 years, the maximal 
duration of treatment should not be longer than 2 years. 
The majority of CPMP agreed that the mean effect of orlistat is modest. Some CPMP members held a 
divergent view. They considered the therapeutic effect of Xenical too small to be clinically relevant, 
whereas  the  adverse  events  are  incompletely  understood,  especially  concerning  breast  cancer. 
However, the majority of the CPMP considered that, although modest, this effect is clinically relevant, 
and it was also recognised that currently there is no safe medicinal product for long-term treatment of 
obesity available.  
In  July  1999,  the  section  4.8  of  the  SPC  was  updated  to  with  information  that  rare  cases  of 
hypersensitivity  have  been  reported  and  that  main  clinical  symptoms  are  pruritus,  rash,  urticaria, 
angioedema and anaphylaxis. 
In January 2001, the section 4.8 of the SPC was updated to include information on that in very rare 
cases an increase in liver transaminases and in alkaline phophatase have been reported during the post 
marketing phase. 
In June 2001, the section 4.8 of the SPC was updated with information that very rare cases of bullous 
eruptions having been reported during post marketing phase. 
In March 2002, the section 5.1 of the SPC was updated to include information on obese type 2 diabetic 
patients insufficiently controlled by antidiabetics. Data from four one-year clinical trials showed that 
the  percentage  of  responders  (≥10%  of  body  weight  loss)  was  11.3%  with  orlistat  as  compared  to 
4.5% with  placebo.  In  orlistat-treated  patients, the  mean  difference from  placebo in weight  loss was 
1.83 kg to 3.06 kg and the mean difference from placebo in HbA1c reduction was 0.18 % to 0.55%. It 
has not been demonstrated that the effect on HbA1c is independent from weight reduction. 
5.  Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
Benefit/risk assessment 
The  quality  of  orlistat  120  mg  capsules,  as  demonstrated  in  the  chemical  and  pharmaceutical 
documentation is considered acceptable. 
The pharmacological activity of orlistat has been shown in animals and man to inhibit, proportionally 
with the dose, the action of gastrointestinal lipase, impairing the metabolism of lipids in the intestinal 
lumen and preventing absorption.  
The  clinical  data  provided  showed,  in  obese  patients  with  an  initial  body  weight  of  about  100  kg,  a 
modest effect of orlistat on body weight after 1-year treatment in association with a mild hypocaloric 
diet, and no specific effects on obesity-associated risk factors. At one year, the mean effect was –3.2 
kg weight loss as compared to placebo. The percentage of patients losing at least 10% of their initial 
body  weight  after  the  start  of  medicinal  treatment  was  20.2%  and  8.3%  in  the  orlistat  120  mg  and 
placebo-treated  groups,  respectively.  During the second year orlistat associated  with  a eucaloric  diet 
did  not  prevent  weight  regain.  The  overall  safety  issues  have  been  adequately  addressed  and 
appropriate warnings and precautions have been included in the SPC. With regards to the occurrence 
of breast cancer, it was likely to be a chance finding.  
In order to select those patients likely to respond, as well as not to unduly expose patients to orlistat, 
the patients who, despite an appropriate hypocaloric diet, were unable to lose more than 2.5 kg over a 
period of 4 consecutive weeks should not be treated. After 12 weeks of treatment, if the patient does 
not  lose  at  least  5%  of  his/her  body  weight  as  measured  at  the  start  of  drug  therapy,  and  then  the 
13/14

treatment  with  orlistat  should  be  discontinued.  The  maximal  duration  of  treatment  should  not  be 
longer  than  2  years.  Moreover,  to  rule  out  any  promoting  effect  of  the  medicinal  product  on  the 
tumour  growth,  additional  data  from  the  ongoing  2-years  study  in  Sweden  are  requested  from  the 
company.  
CPMP recommendation 
Therefore,  the  CPMP  considered  the  benefit  to  risk  assessment  positive  and  the  granting  of  a 
Marketing  Authorisation  was  recommended  for  this  medicinal  product.  At  the  time  of  the  5-year 
renewal, the CPMP considered that the benefit/risk profile of Xenical continued to be favourable and 
recommended the renewal of the Community Marketing Authorisation on 26 June 2003.

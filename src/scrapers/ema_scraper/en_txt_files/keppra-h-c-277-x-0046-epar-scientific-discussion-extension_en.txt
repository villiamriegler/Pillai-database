Introduction 
UCB  S.A.  applied  for  the  Marketing  Authorisation  of  Keppra  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion, 
containing 500 mg levetiracetam per vial (5 ml) through a line-extension procedure.  
Levetiracetam  is  indicated  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  partial  onset  seizures  with  or 
without secondary generalisation in adults and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. In adults 
and  adolescents  weighing  50  kg  or  more,  the  starting  dose  corresponds  to  500  mg  twice  daily. 
Depending on clinical response and tolerance, the daily dose can be increased up to 1,500 mg twice 
daily.    Adjustment  to  lower  doses  is  recommended  for  some  patients  with  impaired  renal  function, 
down  to  250  mg  twice  daily  or  500  mg  once  daily.  In  children  aged  4  to  11  years  and  adolescents 
weighing less than 50 kg, the starting dose corresponds to 10 mg/kg twice daily. Depending upon the 
clinical response and tolerability, the dose can be increased up to 30 mg/kg twice daily.  
Products containing levetiracetam for oral administration were previously authorised, namely Keppra 
film-coated tablets (250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1,000 mg) and Keppra 100 mg/ml oral solution. 
The purpose of the new proposed formulation is to allow the use of levetiracetam in medical situations 
where patients are unable to take oral medication. The use of a concentrate for solution for infusion 
ensures  that  seizure  control  could  be  maintained,  avoiding  any  risk  of  destabilising  the  patient.  A 
strength of 500 mg levetiracetam per vial (5 ml concentrate) is selected. However, doses of 500 mg, 
1000 mg or 1500 mg can be obtained by diluting 1, 2 or 3 vials of drug product in a 100 ml infusion 
bag. Due to the high solubility of levetiracetam in water and its stability in aqueous media, the sterile 
concentrate can be presented as an aqueous solution that is terminally steam sterilised.

Quality aspects 
Drug Substance (to be changed in the EPAR to “Active Substance”) 
Module 3.2.S of the dossier corresponds to the currently approved documentation for the oral dosage 
forms, except for the addition of tests for microbiological quality and bacterial endotoxins to the drug 
substance  specification  and  the  stability  programme.  All  variations  that  were  approved  after  the 
original registration are included in the drug substance documentation.  
Manufacture 
General  information  such  as  nomenclature,  structure,  and  physico-chemical  properties  have  been 
adequately  detailed  for  the  active  substance.  Levetiracetam  has  one  chiral  centre and exists as the S 
enantiomer. 
Levetiracetam can be synthesised following two routes, namely the "tartaric acid resolution route of 
synthesis" or the "synthesis route including a chiral Multicolumn Continuous Chromatography (MCC) 
separation step". 
The  tartaric  acid  resolution  route  of  synthesis  takes  place  in  7  steps.  Appropriate  specification  and 
description of the test methods are presented for the starting materials as well as for reagents, solvents 
and  processing  aids  used  in  the  synthesis.  Adequate  control  of  critical  steps  and  intermediates  have 
been presented as well as method description and validation reports.  
The  MCC  route  of  synthesis  takes  place  in  7  steps.  Appropriate  specification  is  presented  for  the 
starting  materials  as  well  as  for  reagents,  solvents  and  processing  aids  used  in  the  active  substance 
synthesis.  In-process  controls  are  described  for  the  critical  steps  and  for  relevant  intermediates. 
Analytical methods have been described and validated.   
No differences were observed neither for physical properties (differential scanning algometry, NMR, 
X-Ray powder diffraction and optical rotation) nor chemical properties (IR, MS, HPLC for assay and 
impurities, GC for residual solvents, sulphated ash and heavy metals) between levetiracetam obtained 
by the tartaric acid route and the MCC route

Specification 
The structure of levetiracetam has been fully characterised by IR, NMR, MS, elemental analysis, X-
ray  diffraction  analysis,  optical  rotation.  Polymorphism  has  not  been  observed  regardless  of  the 
conditions tested. 
Impurities have been sufficiently described and justified.  Specifications for both synthetic routes are 
the same, except for the residual solvents (as the solvents used are different) and the residual reagent 
test  for  one  reagent  (not  used  in  the  MCC  synthesis).  The  proposed  specifications  are  equivalent  to 
those  already  approved  for  the  oral  formulations,  except  for  the  addition  of  bacterial  endotoxin  and 
microbiological quality tests. Analytical methods have been described and validated. 
Batch  analyses  demonstrate  that  the  results  are  fully  in  compliance  with  the  proposed  specification, 
including  microbiological  quality  and  endotoxins.  Residual  solvents  limits  comply  with  the  ICH 
requirements. 
Stability 
In  the  long  term  and  accelerated  studies  conducting  according  to  ICH  requirements,  there  were  no 
significant  changes  observed  and  all  the  results  are  in  compliance  with  the  specifications.  Related 
substances remain below the limit of quantification. Microbiological quality and bacterial endotoxins 
were satisfactorily tested.  
A satisfactory retest period has been agreed for levetiracetam when stored below 25°C.  
Other ingredients 
Certificates  of  Analysis,  in  compliance  with  the  current  version  of  the  Ph.Eur.,  are  presented  for  all 
excipients. There are no excipients of human or animal origin used. 
Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Keppra  concentrate  for  solution  for  injection  is  a  sterile  clear  and  colourless  solution  without 
preservative added. It is an aqueous solution containing 500 mg of levetiracetam per 5 ml.  
The manufacturing process is conventional for this type of product and satisfactorily described. The 
process development has been satisfactorily accounted for. 
Compatibility of the drug product with perfusion materials has been demonstrated. 
Manufacture of the finished product 
A detailed description of the manufacturing process and controls has been provided. Since a standard 
manufacturing  process  with  terminal  steam  sterilisation  is  used,  process  validation  is  sufficiently 
documented.  
Product Specification 
Specification (identical at release and the end of shelf life) is appropriate for this pharmaceutical form 
(concentrate for solution for infusion) and includes description, identification, assay, related substance, 
pH, sterility, bacterial endotoxins, particulate contamination and extractable volume. 
All non-compendial methods have been satisfactorily detailed and validated.

Batch  analyses  on  industrial-scale  batches  are  in  compliance  with  the  proposed  specifications. 
Impurities remain below the limit of quantitation. 
Stability 
Three full-scale batches placed in the proposed marketing container have been stored at 25°C/60%RH, 
30°C/65%RH and 40°C/75%RH, both in upright and inverted position for 9 months, 12 months and 6 
months  respectively.  No  significant  change  has  been  observed  and  all  results  remain  within 
specification. 
Photostability  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the  sterile  concentrate  is  neither  light-sensitive,  nor 
thermal sensitive (freeze-thaw cycle). These results support the shelf-life and storage conditions stated 
in the SPC. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Levetiracetam  is  already  approved  in  two  oral  dosage  forms.  Module  3.2.S  of  the  submitted  dossier 
corresponds to the currently approved documentation for the oral dosage forms, except for the addition 
of  microbiological  quality  and  bacterial  endotoxins  tests  to  the  drug  substance  specifications  and 
stability programme.  
The drug product is a concentrate for solution for infusion. The manufacturing process is conventional 
for  this  type  of  product.  It  is  an  aqueous  solution,  containing  standard  pharmacopoeial  excipients, 
which  is  terminal  steam  sterilised  in  its  final  container.  The  proposed  specification  is  based  on  the 
general  requirements  for  this  type  of  products  and  the  approved  specifications  for  the  oral  dosage 
forms. The currently available stability data do not indicate degradation during storage.  
3. 
Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
For  this  application,  additional  non-clinical  safety  studies  have  been  conducted  to  assess  the  short-
term use of the drug via IV infusion, as this is the way of administration that is being applied for. The 
data  were  supported,  where  considered  necessary,  by  previously  submitted  studies,  which  also 
included  studies  conducted  on  the  oral  formulation.  The  CHMP  endorsed  the  justification  for  using 
oral  studies,  based  on  the  complete  oral  bioavailability  of  the  drug.  Only  studies  not  previously 
submitted have been assessed in the context of this procedure. These new studies are listed below.

The strategy used in the development programme was to demonstrate the similar exposure between the 
levetiracetam intravenous formulation and the marketed oral formulations, and to evaluate the safety 
profile for intravenous administration. As the pharmacokinetic profiles and indication are the same for 
the oral and the intravenous formulations, the MAH has not performed any evaluation of efficacy of 
the intravenous formulation as such. 
General comments on compliance with GLP/GMP 
The  newly  performed  non-clinical  studies  were  conducted  in  compliance  with  GLP.  There  are  no 
GMP inspection issues identified in the dossier. 
Pharmacology  
Levetiracetam  has  previously  been  shown  to  exhibit  potent  protection  in  a  broad  range  of  animal 
models of chronic epilepsy reflecting both partial and primary generalised seizures. The new data from 
the  submitted  new  in  vitro  safety  pharmacology  study  showed  that  levetiracetam  reduced  red  cell 
deformability  and  aggregation  at  100 mg/mL  but  not  at  30 mg/mL  in  human  volunteer  blood. 
However in man, the concentration of levetiracetam is rapidly diluted in the circulating blood and the 
clinical effect is therefore assessed to be negligible. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam is uncomplicated and similar in all species investigated, 
including man. The absorption of levetiracetam after oral administration is rapid and complete, with 
100% bioavailability. The AUC values after IV and oral administration were similar, but t1/2 values are 
missing after oral administration. The metabolism is minor, and approximately 60% of the substance is 
excreted unchanged in urine, which is the main route of excretion in both humans and animals. The 
level  of  the  major  metabolite,  L057,  is  somewhat  lower  in  animals  compared  to  man.  Two  new 
validated methods were submitted in support of the toxicokinetic measurements. 
Toxicology 
According to the knowledge of levetiracetam deriving from the assessment of previous applications, 
kidney,  liver  and  CNS  were  identified  in  toxicity  studies  as  main  target  organs.  In  the  rat  kidney, 
mechanistic  and  histopathology  data  demonstrated  that  levetiracetam  induced  nephropathy  in  male 
rats.  However,  it  was  demonstrated  that  the  treatment-related  accumulation  of  hyaline  droplets  was 
caused by α2µ-globulin accumulation. This accumulation is specific for the male rat and is reversible 
upon  cessation  of  treatment.  It  is  considered,  however,  to  have  no  relevance  for  man.  In  the  rodent 
liver,  the  treatment-related  changes  consisted  of  increased  weight,  centrilobular  hypertrophy,  fatty 
infiltration,  and  increased  serum  enzymes.  After  long-term  repeat  dosing  in  the  rat,  effects  were 
observed at dose/exposure levels similar to the clinical exposure and dose.  The cause of these effects 
was  not  established,  but  could  possibly  be  due  to  an  adaptive  change  associated  with  microsomal 
enzyme induction. However, no liver cell damage was reported and no treatment related proliferative

or neoplastic changes were found in the liver in the carcinogenicity studies. The possible relevance for 
man  of  the  observed  liver  changes  was  considered  unknown  and  the  findings  are  reflected  in  the 
proposed SPC for this application.  
Acute  toxicity  of  levetiracetam  has  been  studied  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs  after  both  IV  and  oral 
administration. The maximum non lethal dose after IV dosing was 750 mg/kg in mice, 1000 mg/kg in 
rats and ≥ 1200 mg/kg in dogs whereas after oral administration the maximum non lethal dose was > 
5000 mg/kg in mice and rats and ≥ 2400 mg/kg in dogs. The difference in mortality indices between 
IV and oral administration may be related to Cmax plasma concentrations. Based on these studies, the 
acute toxicity of levetiracetam is considered low. 
Three new repeat dose IV toxicity studies, including toxicokinetics, were submitted in support of this 
application. Levetiracetam was administered in rats as a 15-minute IV infusion twice daily 10 hours 
apart  for  2-and  4-weeks  at  doses  ranging  from  225  to  1800 mg/kg/day.  There  were  no  treatment-
related deaths or effects on body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, haematology or clinical 
chemistry parameters. Urinary specific gravity increased in males dosed 1800 mg/kg/day and females 
from  900 mg/kg/day.  At  the1800 mg/kg/day  dose,  liver  and  kidney  weights  were  increased.  Hyaline 
droplets  were  seen  in  the  proximal  tubules  of  males  from  450 mg/kg/day  along  with  basophilic 
tubules. Minimal centrilobular hypertrophy was seen in the liver of all males and some females dosed 
1800 mg/kg/day. Three males also showed these effects at 630 mg/kg/day. The nephropathy (hyaline 
droplets in the proximal tubules) and the minimal centrilobular hypertrophy are expected findings (see 
above). The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was 225 mg/kg/day in the 2-week rat study 
and given the lack of toxicological concern associated with the kidney findings, 225 mg/kg/day may 
also be considered a NOAEL in the 4-week rat study. The rats were exposed to levetiracetam and its 
primary  metabolite,  ucb L057,  throughout  the  studies.  The  extent  of  exposure  to  levetiracetam 
remained  unchanged  over  the  two  weeks  of  treatment.  In  the  4-week  study,  concentrations  were 
slightly higher in males than in females and at the end of the infusion were proportional to the dose 
administered. For man, the exposure relevant for safety evaluation is Cmax 72±21 μg/mL and AUCτ 
372± μg·h/mL. At NOAEL, rats were exposed 2-3 times (AUC) or 0.1-0.2 times the human exposure 
(Cmax,  C10h)  in  the  2-week  IV  study.  At  the  highest  dose  level,  rats  were  exposed  to  18-24  times 
(AUC) and approximately at the human exposure. In the 4-week study at 225 mg/kg/day, the rats were 
exposed to 3-4 times the human exposure. At the highest tested dose level, rats were exposed to 4-6 
times the predicted human exposure. 
In  dogs,  levetiracetam  was  administered  a  15-minute  IV  infusion  twice  daily  10  hours  apart  for  4-
weeks at doses ranging from 150 to 600 mg/kg/day. There were no treatment-related effects on body 
weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, ECG parameters or urinary parameters. At the end of the 
treatment period, a slight decrease occurred in red blood cell count, haemoglobin, packed cell volume 
and  in  the  erythroid  series  from  the  bone  marrow  smears  examination  for  both  sexes  at  the 
600 mg/kg/day  dose  level.  Slight  increases  in  plasma  chloride  concentration  were  detected  among 
females treated at and above 300 mg/kg/day. Given the minor and non-adverse nature of the finding at 
300 mg/kg/day,  this  level  may  be  considered  the  study  NOAEL.  Measured  plasma  concentrations 
showed that rats and Beagle dogs were exposed to levetiracetam and its primary metabolite, ucb L057, 
throughout  the  study,  and  there  was  no  evidence  of  a  difference  between  males  and  females.  At 
NOAEL,  dogs  were  exposed  4-6  times  the  human  exposure.  At  the  highest  dose  level,  dogs  were 
exposed to 7-9 times the predicted human exposure. 
The  results  from  the  performed  IV repeat-dose toxicity studies showed that treatment-related effects 
were observed at the injection sites in rats but not in dogs (dosed up to 600 mg/kg/day). Venous and 
perivenous fibroplasia and intimal proliferation occurred at the injection site in rats treated with 1800 
mg/kg  for  2  weeks  and  was  further  associated  with  minimal  arterial  thrombi  in  the  lungs,  probably 
reflecting changes occurring at the injection site. An increased incidence of injection site damage was 
also  seen  in  both  sexes  from  630 mg/kg/day  following  4-weeks  of  treatment.  These  findings  may 
indicate a vaso-irritative potential. Additionally, information on possible extravasal tissue damage at 
mis-dosing was not included in the submission dossier.

Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  CHMP  considered  that  changing  the  administration  route  from  oral  to  IV  had  not  caused  any 
additional  toxicity,  apart  from  the  local  effects  indicating  a  vaso-irritative  potential  observed  at  the 
injection sites, which needed to be further addressed.  
In the light of this initial assessment, as part of a consolidated List of questions sent to the MAH on 28 
July 2005 (day 120), this concern led to the inclusion of this issue as a topic to be addressed in writing 
by the MAH. 
Further to this request, UCB reviewed the data on the vaso-irritation potential of levetiracetam and in 
order to fully address the concerns of the CHMP, conducted a 5-day vasal tissue irritation study. These 
results were submitted on 11 October 2005, and are outlined below. 
In  summary,  the  findings  showed  that  administration  of  the  Keppra  formulation  by  the  intravenous 
route either as the concentrate (100 mg/ml) or diluted as described in the SPC (15 mg/ml) to the right 
ear of rabbits for 5 days resulted in at most minimal injection site reactions (grades 0 to 1.0) in terms 
of erythema, oedema, induration and infiltration. Similar findings were also recorded for the vehicle 
and  saline  controls.  After  repeated  administrations,  only  minimal  infiltration  was  noted  with  the 
diluted vehicle or test item. 
After  subcutaneous  injection,  there  were  no  local  reactions  except  oedema  (grade  1)  and  a  slight 
(grade 1) or marked (grade 3) hematoma in 2/3 animals with the concentrated vehicle. 
Intra-arterial  administration  resulted  in  slightly  higher  responses  with  grades  of  1-2  for  erythema, 
oedema,  induration,  and  infiltration.  These  effects  were  noted  in  all  groups,  including  controls, 
without dose or concentration relationship. 
After perivenous injection, local effects were limited to very slight erythema and minimal infiltration 
in a limited number of animals distributed evenly within control, vehicle and treated groups. 
No adverse effects were seen at any of the injection sites at necropsy. Histopathological examination 
of  the  injection  sites  and  surrounding  tissues,  performed  5  days  later,  is  currently  ongoing.  It  can 
provisionally  be  concluded  that  the  reactions  seen  at  the  injection  site  were  the  consequence  of 
administration procedures with no specific drug related contribution to the effects seen. Based on these 
interim findings, the MAH claimed that it was reasonable to conclude that the infusion of the Keppa 
IV as proposed in the SPC would not pose an undue hazard in clinical practice. 
The  CHMP  considered  the  provisional  conclusion  of  the  MAH  concerning  the  local  tolerance study 
that was carried out to be agreeable. Both repeat dose intravenous effects and single misdosing effects 
were addressed in the study design.   
However,  before  any  final  conclusions  can  be  drawn  the  histopathological  data  should  be  awaited. 
These should be provided in the form of a Follow-up Measure to this procedure, worded as follows: 
“Submission of the final QC released report of study NCD1341 (“ucb L059: A local tolerance study 
by  intravenous,  perivenous,  intra-arterial  and  subcutaneous  routes  in  male  New  Zealand  White 
rabbits”), including. histopathological examinations, by March 2006.”

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Levetiracetam  is  provided  in  5  ml  glass  vials  containing  500  mg  levetiracetam    (500  mg/5  ml). 
Between one to three vials are used for any single administration, i.e., doses of 500 to 1500 mg, (twice 
daily),  consistent  with  the  recommended  adult  oral  dose  of  1000 to  3000 mg/day.  Before 
administration, 100 ml of compatible diluent is added. The dose should be infused over 15 minutes.   
Since the indication is identical for the oral and the IV formulations, the MAH had not planned any 
evaluation  of  efficacy  for  the  IV  formulation.  The  clinical  studies  therefore  primarily  concern  the 
evaluation of bioequivalence with oral levetiracetam, and the safety of the intravenous formulation.  
GCP 
Three  recent  pharmacokinetic  clinical  studies  (N01077,  N01065  and  N01066)  were  conducted 
between 2003 and 2004 specifically to support the registration of the intravenous formulation. These 
studies  were  performed  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  E6  GCP:  Consolidated  Guidance  (April  1996). 
Four early biopharmaceutics or clinical pharmacology studies (N058, N060, N069 and N204) and one 
pilot  study  (N099)  were  conducted  in  the  1980s  in  Belgium  or  Italy  with  earlier  intravenous 
formulations of levetiracetam. These studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the 
Declaration of Helsinki. There are no GCP inspection issues identified in the dossier. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Levetiracetam has a rather uncomplicated pharmacokinetic profile. The substance is highly soluble, it 
is  well  absorbed  and  has  an  absolute  bioavailability  of  almost  100%.  Levetiracetam  is  not  bound  to 
plasma  proteins  (< 10 %).  The  elimination  is  to  a  large  extent  by  renal  excretion,  with  50-65% 
excreted as unchanged drug and approximately 25% as an inactive acidic metabolite, ucb L057. The 
half-life  of  levetiracetam  is  7-8  hours.  The  pharmacokinetics  is  dose-  and  time-independent  and  the 
inter-individual variability is low. Metabolism to the major metabolite occurs in whole blood and its 
formation does not seem dependent on the cytochrome P450 enzymes.  
Methods 
The  most  relevant  pharmacokinetic  study  to  the  proposed  new  drug  product  is  Study  N01077,  in 
which levetiracetam IV was administered at the highest recommended dose of 1500 mg and over a 15-
minute infusion rate, in line with the proposed SPC.  In the other studies, a different infusion rate/dose 
was used. The following assessment is therefore primarily focused on study N01077. 
Study N01077 was divided in two parts. The first part was a single dose bioavailability comparison 
between  levetiracetam  1500  mg  15-min  IV  infusion  (3  ampoules  in  100  mL  of  sterile  saline  0.9% 
solution) and oral levetiracetam (1500 mg as 3 x 500 mg tablets). 
The  second  part  was  a  study  of  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  levetiracetam  1500  mg  15-min  IV 
infusion  during  repeated  dosing  (4  days  b.i.d).  The  study  included  18  healthy  male  and  female 
volunteers.  Seventeen  subjects  were  included  in  the  part  I  pharmacokinetic  analysis  (one  subject 
excluded due to incorrect IV dosing) and 18 were included in the analysis of part II (12 on active drug, 
6  on  placebo).  After  oral  administration,  the  sampling  times  were  at:  pre-dose,  15  min,  30  min,  45 
min, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, 24 h and 36 h post-dose; after IV administration, the sampling 
times were at: pre-dose, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, 24 h and 36 h 
post-dose (until 12 h only for sampling on Day 7 of part II). Levetiracetam was determined in plasma 
samples  using  a  validated  gas  chromatographic  method  with  nitrogen-phosphorus  detection. 
Concentrations of ucb L057 in plasma were measured by LC/ESI/MS. 
Results 
Intravenous versus oral administration 
The  plasma  concentrations  of  levetiracetam,  including  Cmax,  was  similar  when  levetiracetam  was 
administered as a 15 minute IV infusion and as oral tablets (See table 1 below)

Following  IV  administration,  the  majority  of  subjects  showed  time  to  peak  values  at  the  end  of 
infusion.  However,  in  7  subjects  tmax  occurred  later  than  the  end  of  the  IV  infusion.  The  entire 
administration process as well as the duration of the infusion (maximum 15 min) has been verified and 
no deviations were observed. This increase of tmax was not observed following multiple doses where 
only  the  position  during  the  IV  infusion  has  changed  (sitting  position  in  single  dose  and  decubitus 
position in multiple doses.

Multiple dose exposure as IV infusion 
The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam was as expected. AUCτ tended to be lower than AUC day 1 
although  the  confidence  interval  included  100.  The  observed  pharmacokinetic  parameters  are 
summarised below (Table 2). For ucb L057 median time to peak was 3.0 h and Cmax averaged 1.66 
±0.45 µg Eq LEV/mL. Minimal concentration at steady-state averaged 0.89 ±0.34 µg Eq LEV/mL.

In Study N01165, single-doses of 1500 to 2500 mg were infused over 5 minutes and 2000 to 4000 mg 
were  infused  over  15  minutes.  Mean  Cmax  was  approximately  10%  higher  after  administration  of 
2000 mg over 5 minutes as compared to over 15 minutes (60.6 vs 55.6 ug/ml). 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
The  exposure  relevant  for  safety  evaluation  (Cmax  72±21  µg/ml  and  AUCτ  372±81  µg·h/ml),  was 
considered by CHMP to be similar to the exposure obtained with oral administration of the same dose. 
CHMP overall conclusions on pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetic  documentation  shows  that  an  IV  15  min  infusion  of  levetiracetam  results  in 
similar  Cmax  and  AUC  of  levetiracetam  as  the  same  dose  administered  orally  as  tablets.  Similar 
exposure  of  the  metabolite  ucb  L057  is  also  obtained  with  the  two  modes  of  administration.  Tmax 
after IV infusion is shorter than after oral administration, due to higher rate of systemic input and lack 
of lag time. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The  mechanism  of  action  for  levetiracetam  is  still  not  completely  known.  Levetiracetam  induces 
seizure  protection  in  a  broad  range  of  animal  models  of  partial  and  primarily  generalised  seizures 
without  having  a  pro-convulsant  effect.  In  man,  an  activity  in  both  partial  and  generalised  epilepsy 
conditions  (epileptiform  discharge/photoparoxysmal  response)  has  been  demonstrated.  Two  studies 
were conducted with the intravenous formulation of levetiracetam to investigate the effect on cerebral 
perfusion and quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) in adult healthy volunteers or elderly healthy 
volunteers.  No  effects  of  levetiracetam  on  regional  cerebral  blood  flow  or  quantitative  EEG  were 
detected.

Clinical efficacy 
The  therapeutic  efficacy  of  levetiracetam  as  adjunctive  treatment  in  epileptic  patients  has  been 
evaluated in a large number of studies with the oral formulation. These studies were included in the 
original  Keppra  film-coated  tablets  application  (EMEA/H/C/277.)    However,  the  MAH  has  not 
performed  any  new  efficacy  studies  with  the  intravenous  formulation.  As  the  daily  exposure  to 
levetiracetam  is  route  independent,  and  the  pharmacokinetics  of  levetiracetam  are  linear  and  time 
independent, the MAH’s position is that the efficacy conclusions should apply also to the intravenous 
formulation for levetiracetam. The MAH’s position that no new efficacy studies are required with the 
intravenous formulation was endorsed by the CHMP. 
Clinical safety  
Introduction 
The  systemic  safety  profile  of  the  levetiracetam  intravenous  formulation  is  based  on  the  safety 
experience with the oral tablet formulation and the more recently approved levetiracetam oral solution. 
Additional data recommendations or requirements for intravenous levetiracetam were requested by the 
Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products of the FDA, who suggested that UCB explored the 
clinical  safety  of  giving  the  intravenous  formulation  at  higher  doses  and  faster  infusion  rates  than 
recommended  in  the  proposed  draft  labeling,  in  order  to  better  describe  the  safety  margin  of  this 
formulation.  This  study  (N01165)  has  been  conducted  using  infusions  of  1500 to  2500 mg  over 
5 minutes and 2000 to 4000 mg over 15 minutes.  
Overall,  the  MAH  conducted  eight  studies  involving  117 levetiracetam-exposed  subjects  using 
levetiracetam  intravenous  formulations.    The  three  recent  studies  (N01077,  N01065  and  N01066), 
conducted between 2003 and 2004, specifically intended to support the registration of the intravenous 
formulation.  These studies used the proposed formulation and were performed in accordance with the 
ICH E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance (April 1996). 
In  addition  to  the  three  recent  studies,  UCB  conducted  four  early  biopharmaceutics  or  clinical 
pharmacology  studies  (N058,  N060,  N069  and  N204)  and  one  pilot  study  (N099)  in  the  1980s  in 
Belgium  or  Italy  with  earlier  intravenous  formulations  of  levetiracetam  in  accordance  with  the 
guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.  These studies included 38 adult subjects exposed to at least 
one  intravenous  infusion  of  levetiracetam  undiluted  at  doses  ranging  from  25 to  1600 mg  and  with 
varying durations of IV administration.

Patient exposure 
The  number  of  subjects  exposed,  durations  of  the  intravenous  infusion,  and  doses  of  levetiracetam 
administered are summarised below. 
Overall,  across  all  eight  studies,  117 subjects  (92 healthy  volunteers  and  non-epileptic  patients  and 
25 adults  with  partial  onset  seizures)  were  exposed  to  intravenous  levetiracetam.    In  these  studies, 
79 subjects  have  been  exposed  to  the  proposed  intravenous  formulation  administered  as  an  infusion 
(over  15 minutes  in  36 healthy  subjects  and  25 epilepsy  patients  and  over  5 minutes  in  18 subjects) 
and 38 subjects following injection of earlier intravenous formulations during older studies conducted 
in Europe in the mid- to late 1980s.  Single doses used in all studies range from 25 to 4000 mg.   
A total of 36 individuals (healthy subjects) have received doses in the range of 1500 to 4000 mg over 
15 minutes, with 12 of these having received additional dosing of 1500 mg twice a day for 4 days.   
Another 36 subjects received single doses of 25 to 2500 mg over 2 to 5 minutes.  Finally, 20 subjects 
received slow infusions of relatively low doses of 250 to 1000 mg given over 3 to 4 hours. 
In study N01166, volunteer patients who were already being treated orally with levetiracetam in doses 
ranging from 1000 to 3000 mg/day had their oral maintenance dose of levetiracetam replaced with an 
intravenous dose on a mg-for-mg basis for the 4-day intravenous treatment period.   
Adverse events 
The adverse events reported in the eight studies with intravenous levetiracetam are summarised below. 
The adverse events are first summarised for studies using the proposed infusion time, and then studies 
using faster than recommended infusion times. Finally, studies for which the infusion time is slower or 
unknown are considered.

a) Studies using the proposed infusion time 
Three  studies  were  conducted  where  levetiracetam  was  administered  as  a  15-minute  intravenous 
infusion. These studies (N01077, N01166 and N01165) are summarised below. 
Study N01077 
This study was divided in two parts, the first part (Part A) was an open-label, randomised single-dose, 
two-period crossover trial, whereas the second part (Part B) was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-
controlled, parallel group study of twice daily infusions given for 4 days.   
During  Part  A,  subjects  received  single  doses  of  levetiracetam  1500 mg,  given  as  a  15-minute 
intravenous infusion (diluted in 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride) and as an oral dose.  The two single 
administrations  were  separated  by  a  7-day  washout  period.  After  administration  of  the  oral  tablet, 
13/18 experienced a treatment emergent AE as compared with 16/18 for IV infusion. Gastrointestinal 
disorders were experienced by 2/18 in the IV infusion group vs. none in the oral tablet group. Nervous 
system  disorders  were  reported  by  15/18  in  the  IV  group  vs.  12/18  in  the  oral  tablet  group.  Among 
nervous  system  disorders,  somnolence  was  more  frequent  in  the  IV  group  (61  %  vs.  28  %, 
respectively, whereas dizziness and dizziness postural was more common in the oral tablet group. Two 
subjects in the IV group experienced pruritus at the injection site following intravenous infusion. 
During Part B, subjects were assigned to levetiracetam 1500 mg twice daily for 4 days by IV infusion 
(n=12)  or  placebo  (N=6).  Eight  of  12 subjects  (66.7%)  randomized  to  levetiracetam  experienced 
adverse  events  during  the  multiple  dose  part  as  compared  to  2 of  6 subjects  (33.3%)  randomized  to 
placebo.    The  most  common  adverse  events  for  levetiracetam  were  somnolence,  headache,  postural 
dizziness, dizziness, and decreased blood pressure (BP). There were two subjects who had low blood 
pressure. The lowest on treatment value for one of these patients was 85/48 mmHg measured 2 hours 
following the day 5 evening dose. This subject had tendency to low BP also at screening. For the other 
patient,  the  lowest  screening  recording  was  100/67  mmHg,  whereas  the  lowest  on-treatment 
measurement occurred following the evening dose on Day 3 (84/41 mmHg) and Day 4 (90/29 mm Hg 
and 84/38 MM Hg, retest value). Both patients were otherwise asymptomatic. A graphical illustration 
of mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure for the multiple-dose Part B of study N01077 shows that 
there  is  a  decrease  of  primarily  systolic  but  also  diastolic  BP  during  intravenous  administration  of 
levetiracetam compared with administration of placebo (Fig.2)

Figure 2.  Mean (± SEM) Blood pressure changes over time following multiple doses of intravenous 
Levetiracetam (Study N01077 Part B) 
In study N01077, ECG measurements were made pre-dose and at 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after 
each  drug  administration.  Ventricular  rate  and  PR,  QRS,  QT  and  QTc  intervals  were  recorded.  No 
relevant effects on ECG were found with single and multiple doses of 1500 mg levetiracetam infused 
over 5 minutes. The mean baseline (screening) QTc values were between 390 to 415 msec.  The mean 
changes  from  baseline  were  small  decreases  or  small  increases  (1.2 msec  at  5 minutes  post-dose).  
Three  of  18 subjects  had  single  isolated  recordings  >  450 msec  (Subjects  001/0006,  001/0010,  and 
001/0011); the longest of the values was 461 msec. 
The CHMP considered that, during part A of study N01077, the frequency of treatment emergent AEs 
was higher for the IV group than for the tablet group. Somnolence was more common in the IV group, 
and  two  subjects  reported  pruritus  at  the  injection  site  during  intravenous  infusion.  The  MAH  was 
therefore  requested  to  clarify  the  risk  for  tissue  damage  in  case  of  extravasal  deposition  of 
levetiracetam.  In  addition,  the  risk  for  injection  site  damage  during  long-term  intravenous 
administration of levetiracetam was also requested to be discussed, considering also the results from 
preclinical  studies.  In  the  placebo-controlled  Part  B,  somnolence,  dizziness  postural  and  headache 
were  more  common  in  the  levetiracetam  group, and  decreased  blood  pressure  was  reported  for  2/12 
patients (none in the placebo group). In Part B, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased in 
the levetiracetam group compared with the placebo group. 
Study N01165 
The second study compared adverse events with single ascending doses and with faster infusion times. 
The IV doses of levetiracetam were 2000 mg, 3000 mg and 4000 mg as 15-minute infusions and 1500 
mg, 2000 mg and 2500 mg as 5 minutes infusions. The incidence of subjects with treatment-emergent 
adverse events was 25.0% (3/12 subjects) for placebo, 88.9% (16/18 subjects) in the levetiracetam 15-
minute infusion group, and 86.1% (31/36 subjects) for all levetiracetam IV groups.    For all doses of 
intravenous levetiracetam combined, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events, 
as  well  as  drug  related  treatment-emergent  adverse  events,  were  related to nervous system disorders 
(dizziness, somnolence, postural dizziness and headache).

Two  subjects  in  Study  N01165  experienced  cardiac  events;  sinus  bradycardia  (1500 mg/5 minutes) 
and first degree AV block (3000 mg/15 minutes) in 1 subject each: 
- Subject No. 001/0016 (41.4-year old male, 1500 mg/5 minutes) consistently showed heart rate values 
below 50 bpm at screening (49 bpm) and during the study (range 42 to 40 from the end of the infusion 
to  24  hours  post-dose).    Twelve  hours  post-dose,  a  heart  rate  of  35  bpm  was  reported  as  clinically 
significant sinus bradycardia; the subject was asymptomatic.  Moreover, this subject had prolongation 
of the QRS interval to 128 msec at 24 hours post-dose (screening (≥ 109 msec).  This was not judged 
by the Investigator as related to study treatment; 
-  Subject  No.  001/0032  (38.4-year  old  female,  3000 mg/15 minutes)  had  intermittent  first  degree 
atrioventricular  block  reported  as  an  adverse  event  during  the  treatment  period.    She  had  a  slight 
prolongation  of  PR  interval  at  baseline  (screening  200  msec  with  heart  rate  61 bpm;  pre-dose 
205 msec  with  heart  rate  57  bpm),  with  a  maximum  prolongation  of  PR  interval to 239 msec (heart 
rate  56 bpm)  at  1  hour  post-dose.    The  PR  interval  prolongation  was  also  present  at  discharge  (220 
msec with heart rate 62 bpm).  The subject was asymptomatic.  The event was considered unrelated to 
study medication by the Investigator. 
The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events are presented in Table

The CHMP considered that in Study N01165, one subject had clinically significant sinus bradycardia 
and prolongation of the QRS-interval after administration of 1500 mg levetiracetam during 5 minutes. 
The  MAH  was  therefore  requested  to  submit  more  detailed  data  about  this  subject  and  discuss  the 
relation to the administration of study drug (see below). 
Study N01166 
In  this  study,  levetiracetam  was  administered  intravenously  as  adjunctive  treatment  to  patients  with 
partial  onset  seizures  as  a  15-minute  infusion  in  doses  ranging  from  1000 mg  to  3000 mg/day, 
administered b.i.d.  Twenty-five patients were enrolled; all patients completed the study. A total of 11 
(44%) subjects experienced at least one treatment emergent AE (TEAE).

The primary system organ class that was reported with the highest overall incidence was in nervous 
system disorders (28%, 7/25 subjects), and general disorders and administration site conditions (16%, 
4/25 subjects).  The most frequently reported adverse events were headache (5 subjects) and fatigue (3 
subjects). A total of 5 subjects (20%) experienced TE AEs considered by the Investigator as related to 
the study drug.  The TE AEs related to the study medication were dizziness, vision blurred, ear pain, 
dysuria and blood pressure diastolic decrease.  The Investigator judged all events mild or moderate in 
severity. With exception of two TE AEs, all adverse events reported during the trial had resolved by 
the  end  of  the  trial.    In  both  cases  which  had  not  resolved  (disturbance  in  attention,  subject 
No. 001/0006  and  fatigue,  subject  No.  001/0003),  the  TE  AEs  were  considered  not  related  to  study 
drug.  
With regard to vital signs, one subject presented intermittent diastolic blood pressure decreases below 
normal  range  (<40  mm  Hg).  The  Investigator  assessed  the  event  as  ‘possibly  related’  to  the  study 
drug.  Three  ECG  abnormalities  were  reported  (sinus  bradycardia,  incomplete  bundle  branch  block, 
and right axis deviation). The Investigator did not consider them as clinically significant. One 51-year 
old  female  patient  showed  QT-prolongation  (>470  ms)  after  correction  by  Bazett,  Fridericia  and 
Framingham formulas at pre-dose morning of Day 4. At 15-minute post-dose the subject showed QTc 
values after correction within the normal range. The investigator reported no seizure worsening during 
the clinical trial period and during the brief follow-up. 
The CHMP considered that the MAH had to submit supplementary information with regard to the time 
relationship between administration of study drug and diastolic blood pressure decreases in one patient 
in  Study  N01166,  and  between  the  occurrences  of  ECG  abnormalities  (three  reports)  and  the 
administration of levetiracetam in the same study (see below). 
b) Studies using faster than recommended infusion times 
In  the  three  studies  described  below,  single  intravenous  doses  of  levetiracetam  over  2  to  5  minutes 
were administered. 
Study N058 
This  is  an  early  dose-escalating  study,  conducted  in  Belgium,  to  determine  the  maximum  tolerated 
dose.  Six  healthy  volunteers  participated,  4  men  and  2  women.  Age  ranged  from  27  to  47  years, 
weight  from  51  to  93  kg.  An  initial  open-label,  dose  escalation  phase  (25 mg  to  1600 mg)  was 
followed by a double-blind, crossover phase during which each subject received a single dose of either 
the  active  drug  (1600 mg  levetiracetam)  or  placebo  with  a  1-week  washout  between  doses. 
Levetiracetam was administered in a 5-minute intravenous infusion without dilution of the 100mg/ml 
product prior to administration.   
During the dose escalation phase, no adverse events were reported until the 400 mg dose.  At 800 mg, 
1 subject reported dizziness 1 hour after injection.  With a dose of 1600 mg, adverse effects developed 
at 15 or 30 minutes post-administration and lasted 2 to 4 hours.  4/6 subjects reported feeling tipsy and 
dizziness at 1600 mg.  The other 2 subjects reported euphoria.  Static and dynamic equilibrium were 
assessed following the 1600-mg dose by various means, including the use of the Romberg test.  There 
was a dose-related increase in equilibrium and motor coordination adverse events.  The Romberg test 
showed highly positive results in 2 of the 6 subjects at 15 to 90 minutes post-dose, leading to a fall in 
1 subject.  Spontaneously reported   adverse events reported with levetiracetam 1600 mg IV during the 
crossover phase are shown in Table 5.

Note:    the  study  report  does  not  include  a  complete  listing  of  events  by  subject;  therefore,  the 
denominator is not known. 
Study N069 
This was a three-way cross-over study with a 1-week interval between doses. The primary goal of the 
study was an assessment of bioavailability/bioequivalence. The study included 12 healthy volunteers 
(aged  22-28  years).  They  received  levetiracetam  1000  mg  either  intravenous  (5  ml  injection  in  2 
minutes without dilution of the 200 mg/ml product prior to administration) or as an oral solution (1000 
mg/50 ml) or as capsules (2 x 500 mg capsules). 
Two subjects in all three session reported moderate drowsiness and dizziness that lasted for 3 hours 
after drug intake. All volunteers complained of a burning feeling at the site of the intravenous injection 
during the injection and up to a few seconds post injection. 
The CHMP considered that in study N069, all subjects reported a burning feeling at the injection site 
after  intravenous  administration  of  1000  mg  of  levetiracetam  at  a  faster  infusion  rate  than 
recommended  in  the  SPC.  The  MAH  was  therefore  requested  to  clarify  if  there  is  risk  for  tissue 
damage  in  case  of  extravasal  deposition  of  levetiracetam.  Moreover,  as  in  the  submitted  clinical 
studies,  levetiracetam  had  not  been  administered  for  longer  periods  than  4  days,  the  MAH  was  also 
asked  to  discuss  the  risk  for  injection  site  damage  during  long-term  intravenous  administration  of 
levetiracetam, considering also the results from preclinical studies (see below). 
c) Studies where the infusion times are longer or unknown 
Study N204 
This was a single-blind Phase I study conducted in Italy between November 1985 and April 1986. The 
aim  was  to  investigate  the  effects  of  levetiracetam  on  cerebral  blood  flow,  quantitative  EEG  and 
neuropsychological status. Eight healthy male volunteers with age range 21-25 years were included. A 
single dose of levetiracetam 1000 mg or placebo was administered intravenously over 3 hours without 
dilution of the 200 mg/ml product prior to administration. No adverse events were reported during the 
study.

Study N060 
N060 was a single-blind trial conducted in Italy in 1985. The primary aim was to evaluate the effect of 
levetiracetam  on  cerebral  blood  blow.    Nine  healthy  volunteers  (age  59-84  years)  received  a  single 
intravenous dose of 500 mg levetiracetam administered in 3 to 4 hours (500 mg/5 ml) without dilution 
prior to administration. All subjects completed the study. No adverse events were reported. 
Study N099 
The study was conducted in Belgium in 1989. It was a pilot study to compare the efficacy and safety 
of  two  treatments,  calcium  heparin  and  levetiracetam,  for  deep  venous  thrombosis  in  patients 
undergoing major elective chest and/or abdominal surgery or orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs.  
Patients were randomized to levetiracetam or calcium heparin in an open-label fashion.  Levetiracetam 
was administered as two 250-mg oral doses (capsules) twice on the day prior to surgery, with 250 mg 
levetiracetam given intravenously (250 mg/5ml, undiluted prior to administration) starting on the day 
of surgery and continuing for up to 3 days (duration of administration not stated).  Post-operatively, 
levetiracetam was to be continued for up to Day 7 or 14, depending on the nature of the surgery.  The 
trial  was  terminated  after  the  enrolment  of  6 patients,  3 of  whom  received  levetiracetam,  when  the 
results of other levetiracetam double-blind studies demonstrated that orally administered levetiracetam 
had no effect on bleeding time.  Two patients received 250 mg levetiracetam intravenously once a day 
for  2 days  post-operatively.    No  adverse  events  were  reported.    The  third  patient  received  two  oral 
doses (capsules) of levetiracetam 250 mg pre-operatively and 250 mg intravenously post-operatively.  
The patient underwent resection of an aortic aneurysm and, approximately 12 hours post-operatively, 
she had a massive hemiplegia (side and cause unknown) and died. This case is described further in the 
section below, entitled ‘Serious adverse events and deaths’.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Among  the  studies  submitted  for  this  application,  there  was  one  reported  serious  adverse  event  that 
resulted in death.  In Study N099, a 79-year old female was scheduled to have a resection of an aortic 
aneurysm  and  randomized  to  levetiracetam  treatment.    The  day  before  surgery,  the  patient  received 
two  oral  250-mg  doses  of  levetiracetam  (b.i.d.)  and,  preoperatively  on  the  morning  of  surgery,  one 
dose  of  250 mg  IV  levetiracetam.    She  then  underwent  resection  of  an  aortic  aneurysm  and 
approximately  12 hours  post-operatively  sustained  a  massive  cerebrovascular  hemorrhage  (coded  as 
hemiplegia)  (side  and  cause  unknown)  and  died  4 days  later.  The  investigator  concluded  that 
accidental puncturing of a possibly highly atherosclerotic carotid had led to a thromboembolism in the 
arteria  cerebri  media,  causing  the  massive  hemiplegia  and  ensuing  death  4 days  after  the  event.  
According to the investigator, there was no relationship with the study medication. 
With the exception of the death described above, there were no other serious adverse events reported 
with the intravenous use of levetiracetam in any study. 
CHMP considered that an association between the reported death and exposure to levetiracetam is to 
be considered unlikely. 
Laboratory findings 
In  the  submitted  studies  with  the  intravenous  formulation,  there  were  no  apparent  effects  of 
levetiracetam  on  clinical  laboratory  parameters.  In  study  N01166,  where  multiple  doses  were 
administered  in  epileptic  patients,  there  were  no  clinically  significant  changes  in  laboratory  results 
except for one high blood glucose level at screening. One subject presented with an abnormally low 
level  of  platelets  at  the  final  visit.  However,  this  abnormality  was  classified  as  ‘not  clinically 
significant’  since  there  were  technical  problems  with  the  laboratory  analysis  (EDTA-tube 
insufficiently filled). In three of the older European studies (N058, N069 and N099), haematology and 
blood  chemistry  tests  and  urinalysis  were  performed.  There  were  no  clinically  significant  effects  on 
laboratory parameters in these studies. Clinical laboratory tests were not performed in the other two 
older European studies N204 and N060.

The CHMP considered that, due to the short duration of the treatment, any clinically significant effects 
on laboratory parameters are unlikely. 
Safety in special populations 
Subjects  in  the  studies  of  intravenous  levetiracetam  are  primarily  adult  Caucasian,  but  the  overall 
numbers of both males and females enrolled in the studies are rather small. Additionally, the CHMP 
considered that no new information has been made available in this Extension application concerning 
safety in special populations. 
Post marketing experience/Risk management 
No spontaneous reports of adverse events with an intravenous formulation of levetiracetam have been 
received by the MAH. 
The MAH has performed a review of the literature. Three abstracts from international meetings were 
retrieved.  These described preliminary open-label trials in 27 patients with acute intractable migraine 
or cluster headache conducted by the same primary investigator.  Levetiracetam was compounded into 
an intravenous solution and administered by intravenous bolus injection in each study.  Limited safety 
data were described in the abstracts, with transient nausea and drowsiness reported in 1 and 2 patients, 
respectively.   
Discussion on the clinical aspects 
Overall,  eight  studies  including  117  levetiracetam-exposed  subjects  had  been  conducted  with  the 
intravenous  formulation.  In  these  studies,  92 healthy  volunteers  and  non-epileptic  patients,  and 
25 adults with partial onset seizures were exposed to intravenous levetiracetam.  Seventy-nine subjects 
have been exposed in studies with the proposed intravenous formulation administered as an infusion 
(over  15 minutes  in  36 healthy  subjects  and  25 epilepsy  patients,  and  over  5 minutes  in  18 subjects) 
and 38 subjects following injection of earlier intravenous formulations in studies conducted in Europe 
in the mid- to late 1980s.  Single doses used in all studies range from 25 to 4000 mg.   
The safety data from studies with intravenous levetiracetam indicate a similar safety profile as with the 
oral  formulation,  although  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  CNS-related  adverse  events  was  reported 
after administration of 1500 mg levetiracetam as infusion compared with the same dose as oral tablet. 
The  results  from  studies  with  the  intravenous  formulation  indicate  a  potential  for  blood  pressure 
decrease, which has not been reported for the oral formulations. When administered intravenously as a 
more  concentrated  solution  than  recommended  in  the  proposed  SPC,  all  patients  reported  a  burning 
sensation at the administration site. There are two reports on local irritation at the injection site also 
when levetiracetam is administered as recommended in the SPC. A potential for injection site damage 
is  supported  by  findings  in  the  preclinical  studies,  where  venous  and  perivenous  fibroplasia  and 
intimal proliferation occurred at the injection site in rats. In the light of all the above-described initial 
assessment  of  clinical  data,  the  CHMP  considered  that  it  would  be  desirable  to  clarify  whether 
extravasal  deposition  of  levetiracetam  may  cause  tissue  damage  in  humans,  discussing  the  risk  for 
injection  site  damage  during  long-term  administration  of  levetiracetam.  Supplementary  information 
would  also  need  to  be  provided  with  regard  to  reports  of  ECG  abnormalities  and  blood  pressure 
decrease in Study N01166, and one report of clinically significant sinus bradycardia in Study N01165. 
Therefore,  as  part  of  a  consolidated  List  of  Questions  sent  to  the  MAH  on  28  July  2005  (day  120), 
these concerns led to the inclusion of the following four topics in the list of issues to be addressed in 
writing by the MAH (see text in italics). 
20/27 
©EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  study  N069,  all  subjects  reported  a  burning  feeling  at  the  injection  site  after  intravenous 
1. 
administration  of  1000  mg  of  levetiracetam  at  a faster  infusion rate than recommended in the SPC. 
The  applicant  should  clarify  if  there  is  risk  for  tissue  damage  in  case  of  extravasal  deposition  of 
levetiracetam.  In  the  submitted  clinical  studies,  levetiracetam  has  not  been  administered  for  longer 
periods than 4 days. The risk for injection site damage during long-term intravenous administration of 
levetiracetam should be discussed, considering also the results from preclinical studies. 
2. 
The  applicant  should  submit  supplementary  information  with  regard  to  the  time  relationship 
between administration of study drug and diastolic blood pressure decreases in one patient in Study 
N01166, and between the occurrences of ECG abnormalities (three reports) and the administration of 
levetiracetam in the same study. 
In Study N01165, one subject had clinically significant sinus bradycardia and prolongation of 
3. 
the  QRS-interval  after  administration  of  1500  mg  levetiracetam  during  5  minutes.  The  applicant 
should  present  more  detailed  data  about  this  subject  and  discuss  the  relation  to  administration  of 
study drug. 
4. The tendency to hypotension with the IV formulation does merit further attention, because it could 
be  particularly  pertinent  to  the  patient  group  likely  to  receive  this  intravenous  preparation.  The 
Applicant  should  describe  what  kind  of  post  marketing  surveillance  should  be  envisaged  in  this 
regard. 
Further to these requests, on 11 October 2005, UCB submitted their response, outlined below point by 
point. 
Point  1:  (…risk  for  tissue  damage  in  case  of  extravasal  deposition  and  long-term  intravenous 
administration of levetiracetam…) 
In  summary,  UCB  stated  that  the  IV  formulation  used  in  Study  N069  was  different  from  the 
formulation that was subsequently developed, and intended to be marketed. The IV formulation used 
in  Study  N069  was  prepared  as  a  200  mg/mL  levetiracetam  solution  without a pH buffering system 
and  was  administered  undiluted  as  a  bolus  injection  within  2  minutes.  The  current  IV  levetiracetam 
formulation is 100 mg/mL and is buffered. Therefore, it is understandable that local irritation occurred 
in Study N069, where highly concentrated and unbuffered drug was rapidly administered to subjects. 
This would be the same situation as in the pre-clinical rat repeat-dose studies where levetiracetam (as a 
concentrated  200  mg/mL  solution)  was  rapidly  administered.  It  is  UCB’s  belief  that,  in  these 
preclinical  studies,  the  injection  site  effects  were  the  direct  result  of  rapid  bolus  administration 
together with the high concentration of the drug, particularly as at lower concentrations there were no 
injection site effects. Based on the observations, seen both pre-clinically and clinically in Study N069, 
dilution of the formulation and a slower infusion rate were adopted in further clinical development and 
are the proposed dosing regime outlined in the SPC proposed. 
In three studies (N01077, N01165, and N01166) that used the levetiracetam IV formulation intended 
to be marketed as recommended in the proposed SPC, following proper dilution, only 2 (2.5%) of 79 
individuals  experienced  mild  local  pruritus  at  the  injection  site.  In  these  two  cases,  pruritus  was 
transient (lasting 5 and 20 minutes respectively) and judged to be mild in severity by the investigator. 
Both  cases  were  in  the  single-dose  administration  (Part  A)  of  Study  N01077.  These  two  subjects 
continued in the study and received repeat-dose IV infusion of 1500 mg levetiracetam b.i.d for 4 days 
in  Part  B  of  the  Study,  without  reporting  any  local  injection  site  effects.  None  of  the  subjects  in 
Studies  N01166  or  N01165  reported  adverse  events  related  to  the  injection  procedure,  including  30 
subjects  who  received  a  higher  dose  (and  faster  infusion  rate)  than  recommended  by  the  proposed 
SPC.  Therefore,  the  clinical  data  available  would  suggest  that  the  risk  of  tissue  damage  should  be 
minimal  if  the  levetiracetam  IV  formulation  is  administered  after  proper  dilution,  as  stated  in  the 
proposed SPC.

Currently,  UCB  has  no  clinical  data  with  the  proposed  commercial  levetiracetam  IV  formulation  to 
assess longer-term use (>4 days). However, the objective of developing levetiracetam IV formulation 
is to allow it to be used in medical situations where patients are unable to take oral medications. Such 
situations should only exceptionally last longer than 4 days.  
In order to further address the concerns of the CHMP regarding the risk for the injection site damage 
due to accidental mis-dosing with IV administration of levetiracetam and its long-term use, UCB has 
conducted a non-clinical study to assess local tolerance of levetiracetam concentrate for solution for 
injection. The results (described above in section 3.3 - Non-Clinical aspects) are reassuring. 
The CHMP agreed with the explanation that the solution used in study N069 was more concentrated 
and  infused  during  a  shorter  time  than  currently  recommended,  is  likely  to  explain  the  common 
occurrences  of  local  irritating  effects  in  that  study.  As  already  mentioned  above  in  this  document 
(section 3.3 - Non-Clinical aspects), the results of a new non-clinical study are reassuring, pending the 
results of the histopathological examination. The MAH stated that situations where Keppra IV would 
be used should only exceptionally last longer than 4 days. However, there could be situations where 
longer-term use is necessary.  
Therefore, the CHMP considered that the SPC should mention (in Section 4.2 – Posology) the lack of 
clinical experience of IV administration for periods longer than 4 days. 
The  MAH  agreed  with  this  request  from  the  CHMP,  and  provided  Product  Information  documents 
amended as requested. 
Point  2:  (supplementary  information  on  the  time  relationship  between  drug  administration  and 
diastolic blood pressure decreases in Study N01166, and between occurrences of ECG abnormalities) 
In summary, UCB response stated that one subject (005/0030), a 48 year old male patient with partial 
onset epilepsy, received 1000 mg bid levetiracetam IV infusion (over 15 minutes) for 4 days in Study 
N01166.  This  subject  reported  an  adverse  event  of  “decrease  of  diastolic  blood  pressure”  initiating 
from Day 1 pre-dose. To respond to the question from CHMP, the vital signs of subject 005/0030 were 
reviewed  and  summarised.  Subject  005/0030  had  a  low  but  normal  diastolic  blood  pressure  at 
screening (61 mmHg). The diastolic blood pressure before the first dose of levetiracetam IV infusion 
for this subject was also low (46 mmHg). During the 4-day administration, the diastolic blood pressure 
for  this  subject  fluctuated  between  32  to  71  mmHg,  with  the  majority  of  the  values  less  than  55 
mmHg.  At  the  final  visit,  the  diastolic  blood  pressure  for  the  subject  was  52  mmHg.  A  similar 
observation  can  be  made  for  systolic  blood  pressure:  the  subject  had  a  relatively  low  systolic  blood 
pressure  before  and  throughout  the  study.  A  table  was  provided,  illustrating  that  the  blood  pressure 
profiles remain largely unchanged throughout the administration and subsequent monitoring phases of 
the  study  and  they  do  not  appear  to  suggest  a  time  relationship  with  the  administration  of 
levetiracetam intravenous infusion. In addition, heart rate remained stable with the administration of 
levetiracetam.  If  there  had been a time relationship between the infusion of levetiracetam and blood 
pressure  decrease,  one  would  expect  to  observe  a  baroreceptor  reflex  mediated  parallel  increase  in 
heart rate for adjustment of blood pressure. UCB pointed therefore out that it may be concluded that it 
is unlikely that there was a time relationship between the intravenous administration of levetiracetam 
and diastolic blood pressure decreases for subject 005/0030 in Study N01166. 
In this Study, 7 subjects reported at least one ECG abnormality, which consisted of sinus bradycardia, 
incomplete  right  bundle  branch  block  and  right  axis  deviations.  All  ECG  abnormalities  in  Study 
N01166  were  reviewed.  The  majority  of  these  abnormalities  already  existed  in  the  baseline  (during 
screening  or  at  pre-dose  on  Day  1).  There  were  no  significant  ECG  changes  after  administration  of 
levetiracetam  intravenous  infusion.  None  of  the  ECG  abnormalities  were  considered  to  be  clinically 
significant  by  the  Investigator.  Compared  to  baseline,  no  clinically  relevant  modifications  were 
observed in the ECG parameters after administration of levetiracetam intravenous infusion.  
In  the  light  of  the  supplementary  information  summarised  above,  the  CHMP  considered  the  issue 
resolved, as the additional analysis did not provide any clear evidence for a time relationship between 
intravenous administration of levetiracetam and decreases of blood pressure. Moreover, no clinically 
significant ECG changes were recorded after levetiracetam intravenous infusion.

Point  3:  (Presentation  of  more  detailed  data  about  one  subject  in Study N01165 who had clinically 
significant sinus bradycardia and prolongation of the QRS-interval after administration of 1500 mg 
levetiracetam during 5 minutes.) 
In summary, UCB response stated that subject 001/0016 (a 41 year old healthy male subject) received 
1500  mg  levetiracetam  single  dose,  via  a  5  minutes  infusion  in  Study  N01165.  This  subject  had  a 
clinically significant sinus bradycardia post dose and a not clinically significant prolongation of QRS 
interval during the study.  
This  subject’s  heart  rate  was  low  at  screening  and  pre-dose  (VR = 40 –  49  bpm)  and  low  heart  rate 
values  were  also  recorded  at  different  time  points  during  the  trial,  namely  40  –  44  bpm  with  the 
exception of a ventricular rate of 35 bpm at 12 h post-dose. The subject was clinically asymptomatic 
but the Investigator judged the observation to be clinically significant. Sinus bradycardia was recorded 
as an AE and was assessed by the Investigator as 'not related' to the study drug. 
In subject 001/0016 the QRS duration varied between 109 and 118 msec at screening and pre-dosing.  
From the end of levetiracetam infusion up to 12 hours post-dosing the duration of the QRS complex 
remained  in  a  similar  range,  namely  107-114  msec.  At  24  hours  post-dosing  the  QRS  complex 
increased to 128 msec, but returned to 118 msec at discharge.  
In conclusion, subject 001/0016 had already reported bradycardia and prolongation of QRS complex 
at  baseline.  Following  the  administration  of  levetiracetam  5-minute  IV  infusion,  limited  fluctuations 
were recorded for heart rate and duration of QRS complex. Bradycardia was reported as adverse event 
at 12 hour post dosing, which, in the context of the continuous observations was not attributed to the 
study drug administration. There appears to be no time relationship between bradycardia, prolongation 
of QRS – complex, and the administration of the study drug. 
The CHMP considered UCB’s response satisfactory, and the issue resolved. 
Point  4:  (Attention  to  tendency  to  hypotension  with  the  IV  formulation  and  description  of  post 
marketing surveillance envisaged.) 
In  summary,  UCB’s  response  stated  that  vital  signs  (heart  rate,  blood  pressure  and  respiratory  rate) 
were recorded in the two recently completed studies N01077 and N01165 at screening, on-treatment, 
and  discharge  in  supine  position  after  a  5-minute  rest  and  in  the  dorsal  decubitus  position  during 
infusion. In the multiple-dose portion of Study N01077, 2 subjects (No. 001/0013 and 001/0014) had 
low  systolic  blood  pressure  measurements  (≤  100  mmHg).  The  lowest  on-treatment  blood  pressure 
value  for  001/0013,  recorded  in  the  supine  position,  was  85/48  mmHg,  measured  2  hours  following 
the  Day  5  evening  dose;  this  subject  had  repeated  measurements  made  at  screening  as  a  result  of 
similarly  low  recordings  (lowest  94/33  mmHg).  For  001/0014,  the  lowest  screening  recording  (in  a 
supine  position)  was  100/67  mmHg.  The  lowest  on  treatment  measurements  occurred  5  minutes 
following the evening dose on Day 3 (84/41 mmHg) and Day 4 (90/29 mmHg and 84/38 mmHg, retest 
value).  Both  were  reported  as  adverse  events.  The  patients  were  otherwise  asymptomatic.  As  these 
values were present pre- and post-dose, they are not clearly attributable to treatment. There were no 
other individual clinically significant changes, including no observations of orthostatic hypotension. 
Vital sign measurements (including blood pressure) were also obtained following treatment in the five 
older studies conducted in the mid- to late-1980s in Europe. There were no reported alterations in vital 
sign measurements. 
In  study  N01166  vital  sign  values  remained  relatively  stable  during  the  study,  and  within  normal 
ranges. Nevertheless, one patient (005/0030) presented diastolic blood pressure decreases. Additional 
data  with  regard  to  the  time  relationship  between  administration  of  study  drug  and  diastolic  blood 
pressure  decrease  in  this  patient  were  submitted  as  response to the CHMP question. Since peak and 
trough  diastolic  blood  pressure  values  were  similar,  there  appears  to  be  no  relationship  between  the 
diastolic blood pressure and the administration of levetiracetam intravenous infusion. Low values were

present  pre-  and  post-dose,  the  patient  already  presented  a  decreased  diastolic  blood  pressure  at 
baseline just before study drug administration, and moreover, peak and trough diastolic blood pressure 
values were similar, therefore the decreases in diastolic blood pressure are not clearly attributable to 
treatment. 
With  reference  to  the  above-mentioned  data,  UCB’s  position  is  that  there  does  not  seem  to  be  a 
tendency to hypotension with the IV formulation. Therefore no specific post-marketing surveillance is 
envisaged in regard to hypotension. However, because hypotension might be particularly pertinent to 
the patient group likely to receive the intravenous preparation, events of hypotension will be closely 
monitored during routine post marketing surveillance. 
The CHMP considered UCB’s response satisfactory, and the issue resolved. 
Therefore,  at  day  150  of  the  procedure,  UCB  had  answered  in  a  satisfactory  way  to  all  clinical 
questions.  Most  of  the  concerns  in  the  initial  assessment  report  (local  irritation,  ECG  changes, 
potential QT prolongation, hypotension) were not confirmed by a closer examination of the data. 
The only remaining point of concern (lack of safety data for IV administrations that would be longer 
than 4 days) will be addressed by the inclusion of adequate wording in the SPC. 
In  addition  to  the  4  points  above,  a  report  of  a  simulation  model  in  children  for  intravenous 
administration of Keppra concentrate was submitted (in an addendum to module 5 to the answers to 
the  CHMP  Day  120  Request  for  Supplementary  Information  on  clinical  aspects).  This  report 
establishes that the PK model supports extrapolations from children to adults for oral administration 
and  from  adults  to  children  for  intravenous  administration.  Based  on  the  similarity  of  the  predicted 
Cmax  and  AUC following oral dosing and simulations for IV dosing in children, and to facilitate the 
appropriate  dosing  of  Keppra  100  mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  in  the  paediatric 
population,  UCB  proposed  to  include  the  wording  of  the  newly  approved  paediatric  information  of 
Keppra oral formulations (Ref: EMEA/H/C/277/II/44, approval that took place during this procedure) 
in  the  proposed  PI  of  Keppra  100  mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  and  to  include 
information on the results of the PK simulation model in children (section 5.2). 
In  summary,  although  no  clinical  data  are  available  from  IV  dosing  to  paediatric  patients,  UCB’s 
proposed that dosing recommendations for children from the age of 4 years should be inserted in the 
SPC.  To  support  these  IV  dosing  recommendations  in  children,  the  MAH  submitted  a  population 
pharmacokinetic  analysis.  In  this  report,  the  information  from  the  population  PK  analysis  of  oral 
levetiracetam in children and of the bioavailability study between the intravenous solution and the oral 
tablet in healthy adult subjects was merged into one simulation model in order to evaluate an optimal 
intravenous  dosing  regimen  in  children  4  years  of  age  and  older  as  a  function  of  the  relevant 
covariates. There was an underprediction of Cmax obtained after IV administration in adults. This was 
suggested to be caused by the drug not being fully distributed in the body at the end of an intravenous 
infusion resulting in a short period of time with higher concentrations than those predicted by a one-
compartment model. The volume of the central compartment relative to body weight was stated to be 
higher in young infants than in adults but rapidly approaching adult values with increasing age, so that 
a similar transient elevation could be expected. Based on the observations in adults, it was stated that 
the initial concentration following the end of the infusion in children (Cmax) may be as much as 75% 
higher  than  that  predicted.  Except  for  this  short  period,  these  results  indicate  that  the  current 
simulation  model  of  levetiracetam  obtained  with  oral  data  in  children  and  using  the  relative 
bioavailability  measured  in  adults  can  be  utilised  to  predict  the  exposure  after  intravenous 
administration of levetiracetam in epileptic children and adults. 
The  CHMP  considered  that,  since  the  bioavailability  of  oral  levetiracetam  is  100%  and  since  the 
plasma concentrations obtained with the solution for infusion are very similar to the levels after oral 
administration,  the  main  unknown  factor  is  whether  the  product  has  a  similar  initial  distribution  in 
paediatric and adult patients. In the analysis, similar distribution is assumed. No paediatric IV data is 
available  and  as  such,  the  resulting  one-compartment  model  could  not  be  validated  in  paediatric 
patients administered IV levetiracetam.

If  the  initial  distribution  of  levetiracetam  is  different  in  children  than  in  adults,  the Cmax obtained in 
children  with  the  proposed  IV  dose  recommendation  may  differ  from  the  Cmax  in  children  after  oral 
administration. The magnitude of this difference is difficult to predict. If the obtained Cmax is higher, a 
prolongation of the infusion time (reduction of the infusion rate) may be needed. The AUC obtained in 
children after IV administration will be the same as after oral administration. The possibly higher Cmax 
after  IV  administration  should  therefore  be  assessed  by  the  MAH  in  light  of  the  available  clinical 
documentation in children with orally administered levetiracetam.  
The safety of levetiracetam is relatively good and much higher concentrations have been well tolerated 
in children, e.g. in studies N159 and N157. Furthermore, the inter-subject variability for the different 
parameters  of  the  model  leads  to  a  range  of  concentrations  of  at  least  2  fold  whatever  the  dose. 
Therefore, a potential increase in Cmax after IV administration in children above 40 kg does not appear 
to raise serious risks. Nevertheless, the MAH should investigate whether the model could be adjusted 
in  order  to  provide  more  realistic  estimates  of  the  bolus  effect  and  of  Cmax  (e.g.  by  a  two-
compartmental mode). Based on these results, the need for a reduction of the infusion rate in children 
when there is a risk of unacceptably high Cmax should be discussed. 
In essence, the MAH was requested by CHMP to evaluate the possibility to slow down the infusion 
rate to 30 min in children if there are safety concerns (the latter could be assessed using an appropriate 
PK model). 
To  this  end,  UCB  initiated  additional  PK  simulations  using  a  two-compartment  model  in  order  to 
improve  the  accuracy  on  peak  plasma  concentrations  at  the  end  of  infusion.  The  impact  of  slowing 
down  the  infusion  rate  of  Keppra  100  mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  is  also  explored. 
UCB informed the CHMP that a final report could be expected by March 2006. 
In order to avoid additional delays in the approval of this procedure for Keppra 100 mg/ml concentrate 
for solution for infusion, UCB therefore proposed to provide the CHMP with the report as a Follow-up 
Measure (FUM) by 1 March 2006. 
CHMP considered this proposal acceptable: the MAH will therefore provide additional information as 
a FUM about the potential risks of higher Cmax in children than in adults following IV administration. 
This FUM will be worded as follow: 
“Amendment to Study report RXCE05F1305 “Simulations for evaluation of dose adaptation rules of 
intravenous levetiracetam in children". This amendment will assess the risk of high Cmax in children 
after IV administration. PK models could be used to better delineate this risk. If the risk is substantial, 
the MAH will discuss the need for a reduction of the infusion rate in (some) children. Longer infusion 
times  may  better  mimic  the  oral  pharmacokinetic  profile,  and  this  may  be  investigated  by  data 
simulation.”

Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
All  new  applications  and  relevant  post-authorisation  procedures  for  which  a  European  Commission 
Decision will be granted after 20 November 2005 will have to comply with relevant provisions set out 
in the new legislation. Therefore, during assessment of this procedure, UCB was requested to provide 
documents that set out a detailed description of the system of pharmacovigilance, as requested by Art 
8.3 (ia) and n) of the amended Directive. A statement signed by the applicant and the qualified person 
for pharmacovigilance, indicating that the applicant has the services of a qualified person responsible 
for pharmacovigilance and the necessary means for the notification of any adverse reaction occurring 
either in the Community or in a third country was also requested.

Further  to  the  above  request,  the  MAH  has  provided  a  signed  statement  from  the  Qualified  Person 
Responsible for Pharmacovigilance. The location of the description in the MAA, and updating of the 
information,  post  authorisation  has  been  provided.  The  EU/EEA  Qualified  Person  Responsible  for 
Pharmacovigilance  has  been  identified.  The  organisation  of  the  pharmacovigilance  activities  and 
written  policies  and  procedures  in  Global  Drug  Safety  have  been  described.  Databases,  training  and 
documentation systems, and quality management systems have been identified. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
Risk Management Plan 
Not applicable 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of opinion that no additional 
data are required beyond the risk minimisation activities included in the Product Information. 
6. 
Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
No  major  deficiencies  have  been  identified  in  the  quality  part  of  the  application.  The  MAH  has 
correctly  addressed  all  major  Quality  Issues  and  has  finally  committed  to  2  minor  quality-related 
FUMs, which have no impact on the benefit/risk balance. 
In  the  non-clinical  studies,  changing  the  administration  route  from  oral  to  IV  has  not  caused  any 
additional  toxicity  besides  the  local  effects  seen  at  the  injection  sites,  which  need  to  be  further 
addressed.  The  CHMP  agrees  with  the  provisional  conclusion  of  the  Applicant  concerning  the  local 
tolerance study that was carried out. Both repeat dose intravenous effects and single misdosing effects 
were addressed in the study design.   
However,  before  any  final  conclusions  can  be  drawn  the  histopathological  data  should  be  provided. 
The  CHMP considered that these should be provided  as post-marketing authorisation in the form of 
FUMs. 
The pharmacokinetic documentation shows that a 15-min IV infusion of levetiracetam in adults results 
in  similar  Cmax  and  AUC  values  of  levetiracetam  as  the  same  dose  administered  orally  as  tablets. 
However, the rate of input of levetiracetam is higher after IV infusion. Similar data were not available 
for children, so the MAH is requested to evaluate the possibility to slow down the infusion rate to 30 
min  in  children  if  there  are  safety  concerns  (the  latter  could  be  assessed  using  an  appropriate  PK 
model).  
The safety data from studies with intravenous levetiracetam indicate a similar safety profile as with the 
oral  formulation,  with  a  predominance  of  CNS-related  adverse  events.  In  the  studies  with  the 
intravenous formulation some subjects were noted to have transient decreases in blood pressure. When 
administered intravenously as a more concentrated solution than recommended in the proposed SPC, 
all  patients  reported  a  burning  sensation  at  the  administration  site.  There  are  two  reports  on  local 
irritation  at  the  injection  site  with  the  recommended  concentration  and  infusion  rate.  Further  post-
marketing  non-clinical  histopathological  data  should  clarify  whether  extravasal  deposition  of 
levetiracetam may cause tissue damage. In addition, the SPC will mention that there are no safety data 
for IV administrations for periods longer than 4 days. 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Keppra 100 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion in 
the  treatment  of  “adjunctive  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  partial  onset  seizures  with  or  without 
secondary generalisation in adults and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy” was favourable and 
therefore recommended the granting of the extension to the marketing authorisation.

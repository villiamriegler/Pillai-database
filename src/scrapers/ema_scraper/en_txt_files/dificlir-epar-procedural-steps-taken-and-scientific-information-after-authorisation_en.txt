SmPC and PL 
The potential drug drug interaction between fidaxomicin and 
results from study 2819-CL-2003, assessing the effect 
of multiple doses of fidaxomicin on the 
pharmacokinetics of a single dose of rosuvastatin in 
healthy male subjects. In addition, the local 
representatives for Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia are 
updated in the PL. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
rosuvastatin was investigated in study 2819-CL-2003, an 
open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study in healthy 
male subjects following multiple oral doses of fidaxomicin 
and a single oral dose of rosuvastatin. The study 
demonstrated that fidaxomicin does not have a clinically 
significant effect on the exposure of rosuvastatin. 
The Sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC were updated in line 
with these results. The RMP was updated accordingly. The 
CHMP concluded that these results do not affect the overall 
benefit/risk balance for Dificlir, which remains positive.

potential hypersensitivity reactions (four reports of rash and 
one report of a burning sensation of the throat, arms, and 
legs).  All reported symptoms were mild and either 
self-limiting or easily managed with anti-histamines. 
Hence, the post-marketing database was searched for any 
events equal to Anaphylactic reaction (SMQ) or Angioedema 
(SMQ).  Two such cases were identified during this reporting 
period of which one had a positive rechallenge reported.  
Based on aforementioned information, following assessment 
of PSUR 1 (covering period 27/11/2011- 26/05/2012), the 
MAH had been requested to add appropriate warnings and 
precautions to the SmPC.  
In addition, as part of Post-Authorisation Measures, two in 
vitro studies showed that neither fidaxomicin nor OP-1118 
are substrates, but both are inhibitors, of transporters BCRP, 
MRP2, and OATP2B1.  A clinical study is planned to evaluate 
the clinical relevance of these in vitro data. In the meantime, 
an appropriate statement is introduced in section 5.2 of the 
SmPC.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant STEBA Biotech S.A submitted on 7 January 2016 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Tookad, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 
3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was 
agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 26 March 2015. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Tookad is indicated for the treatment of low-risk localised prostate cancer. 
Tookad is indicated in adult males. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
padeliporfin was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision CW/1/2011 
on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance padeliporfin contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tookad is indicated as monotherapy for adult patients with previously untreated, unilateral, low-risk, 
adenocarcinoma of the prostate with a life expectancy ≥ 10 years and: 
- 
- 
- 
Clinical stage T1c or T2a,  
Gleason Score ≤ 6, based on high-resolution biopsy strategies,  
PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL,  
3 positive cancer cores with a maximum cancer core length of 5 mm in any one core or 1 -2 positive 
- 
cancer cores with ≥ 50 % cancer involvement in any one core or a PSA density ≥ 0.15 ng/mL/cm3. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men. An estimated 1.1 million men worldwide were 
diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012, accounting for 15% of the cancers diagnosed in men, with almost 
70% of the cases (759,000) occurring in more developed regions. In 2012, 420000 new cases were 
diagnosed and 101000 deaths estimated in Europe (Globocan, 2012). 
The risk of clinically significant prostate cancer is related to age, ethnicity, family history, PSA level, free/total 
PSA ratio and findings on digital rectal examination (DRE) (Thompson IM, et al. 2006). 
The use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing has enabled detection stage of prostate cancer at earlier 
stages, resulting in increased diagnosis rates (Neppl-Huber, Zappa et al. 2012). 
Based on a study in Spain, about 90% of the newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer are localised, while 
the remaining 10% include locally advanced and metastatic forms (Cózar JM et al. BJU Int. 2012). Localised 
prostate cancer is defined as stage T1/T2, Nx/N0, M0. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644309/2017 
Page 8/146 
  
  
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Localised prostate cancer (stage T1/T2, Nx/N0, M0) is classified as low-, intermediate- or high-risk as a guide 
to prognosis and therapy (ESMO guideline). Among new cases of localised prostate cancer, many men (42%) 
exhibit a low risk profile, defined as T1c/T2a, prostate specific antigen 10 ng/ml or less, and Gleason score 6 
or less (D'Amico, Whittington et al. 1998). Among these patients, some are considered very low-risk, defined 
as: stage T1c, Gleason score ≤ 6, 1 or 2 positive prostate biopsy cores, PSA density ≤ 0.15 ng/mL/cm3 and < 
50 % cancer involvement in each core. 
When the cancer is confined to the prostate gland, median survival in excess of 5 years can be anticipated 
(Andriole GL, et al, N Engl J Med 2009).  
2.1.4.  Management 
There is no consensus regarding optimum management of localised disease. Watchful waiting with delayed 
hormone therapy for symptomatic progression is an option for men who are not suitable for, or unwilling to 
have, treatment with curative intent.  
Four primary therapeutic strategies are recommended for patients exhibiting a low risk profile: active 
surveillance, brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, radical radiotherapy (ESMO clinical practice guideline, 
July 2015). 
Active surveillance is a strategy of close monitoring, typically using serum PSA, repeat prostate biopsies 
and/or MRI, keeping curative treatment in reserve for those with early evidence of disease progression. It 
aims to achieve the correct timing for curative treatment in patients with a life expectancy over 10 years 
through a predefined schedule. The choice of deferred treatment depends on the treatment intent (curative 
vs. palliative) and life expectancy. Suitable patients must be fully apprised of surgery and radiotherapy 
options and counselled on the possibility of requiring further treatment in the future. Studies have shown that 
among low risk patients on active surveillance, 4 to 10% progress to active treatment at 1 year and 15 to 
27% progress at 2 years.  
Active surveillance and deferred treatment of localised prostate cancer (stage T1/T2, Nx/N0, M0) has been 
associated with case-specific survival at 10 years between 96%-100% (Mottet et al., European Association of 
Urology 2015). 
For radical treatments for low risk prostate cancer the case specific survival at 10 years and recurrence free 
survival are very high. Patients with low risk prostate cancer who are unwilling to pursue active surveillance 
receive radical treatment. These interventions all have side effects, mainly local bladder, bowel and sexual 
dysfunction. Problems include erectile dysfunction in 30-90%, urinary incontinence in 5-35% and rectal 
symptoms in 1-11% of treated patients. The decision to proceed with radical treatment is based on 
assessment of the probabilities of clinical progression, side-effects and potential survival benefit.  
Focal ablative therapies as cryotherapy and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) are recommended in 
European guidelines only as alternative therapeutic options for low risk patients who are unfit for surgery or 
radiotherapy. 
About the product 
Tookad (padeliporfin) is palladium bacteriopheophorbide monolysotaurine, also known as padeliporfin-di-
potassium or WST11. It is a derivative of bacteriochlorophyll, the photosynthetic pigment of certain aquatic

bacteria that draw their energy supply from sunlight, and becomes pharmaceutically active when illuminated 
by light.  The UV / visible spectrum of the drug product in plasma present 5 maxima at 276 nm - 334 nm - 
384 nm - 518 nm and 753nm, with a peak of absorption in the near-infrared wavelengths at ~ 753 nm. 
Tookad vascular targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) consists of intravenous administration of Tookad, 
followed immediately by local activation by low – energy laser light illumination. 
Padeliporfin is retained within the vascular system. When activated with 753 nm wavelength laser light, 
padeliporfin triggers a cascade of pathophysiological events resulting in focal necrosis within a few days. 
Activation within the illuminated tumour vasculature, generates oxygen radicals (•OH, O
) causing local 
hypoxia that induces the release of nitric oxide (•NO) radicals. This results in transient arterial vasodilatation 
that triggers the release of the vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1. Rapid consumption of the •NO radicals, by 
•�
2
oxygen radicals, leads to the formation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (e.g. peroxynitrite), in parallel to 
arterial constriction. In addition, impaired deformability is thought to enhance erythrocyte aggregability and 
formation of blood clots at the interface of the arterial supply (feeding arteries) and tumour microcirculation, 
results in occlusion of the tumour vasculature. This is enhanced by RNS-induced endothelial cell apoptosis 
and initiation of self-propagated tumour cells necrosis through peroxidation of their membrane (see SmPC 
section 5.1). 
The initially claimed indication was for treatment of low-risk localised prostate cancer in adult males.  
The approved indication is: 
Tookad is indicated as monotherapy for adult patients with previously untreated, unilateral, low-risk, 
adenocarcinoma of the prostate with a life expectancy ≥ 10 years and: 
- 
- 
- 
Clinical stage T1c or T2a,  
Gleason Score ≤ 6, based on high-resolution biopsy strategies,  
PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL,  
3 positive cancer cores with a maximum cancer core length of 5 mm in any one core or 1 -2 positive 
- 
cancer cores with ≥ 50 % cancer involvement in any one core or a PSA density ≥ 0.15 ng/mL/cm3. 
Tookad is restricted to hospital use only. It should only be used by personnel trained in the Vascular-Targeted 
Photodynamic therapy (VTP) procedure (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The recommended posology of Tookad is one single dose of 3.66 mg/kg of padeliporfin.  
Tookad is administered as part of focal VTP. The VTP procedure is performed under general anaesthetic after 
rectal preparation. Prophylactic antibiotics and alpha-blockers may be prescribed at the physician’s discretion. 
Retreatment of the same lobe or sequential treatment of the contralateral lobe of the prostate are not 
recommended (see section 4.4).

The product is available in amber type I glass vials sealed rubber stoppers crimped with aluminium seals and 
covered with blue plastic flip-off caps, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The  chemical  name  of  padeliporfin  dipotassium  is  palladate(2-),  [(7S,8S,17R,18R)-13-acetyl-18-ethyl-5-(2-
methoxy-2-oxoethyl)-2,8,12,17-tetramethyl-3-[[(2-sulfoethyl)amino]carbonyl]-21H,23H-porphine-7-
propanoato(4-)-κN21,κN22,κN23,κN24]-dipotassium 
corresponding 
to 
the  molecular 
formula 
C37H41K 2N5O9PdS. It has a relative molecular mass of 916.4 g/mol and the following structure (Figure 1). 
Figure 1 Structure of padeliporfin dipotassium 
The chemical structure of padeliporfin dipotassium was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, ultraviolet spectroscopy and 
infrared spectroscopy. 
The active substance is a very hygroscopic dark powder, soluble in aqueous media and practically insoluble in 
most organic solvents. Polymorphism is not considered important for padeliporphin as it is dissolved during 
formulation and subsequently freeze-dried. Its aqueous solubility is ideally suited to the reconstitution 
operation ahead of injection.  
Padeliporphin contains four chiral centres. All stereocentres originate in the fermentation step and are derived 
from enzymatic processes within the organism. Optical rotation measurements on the active substance have 
shown that a single enantiomer is routinely produced. Accordingly, no test for enantiomeric purity is deemed 
necessary in the active substance specification. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesized in three main steps from two starting materials. During the procedure, a 
major objection was raised, requesting re-definition of one of the starting materials. CHMP considered that 
not enough of the process was included in the process description, and that an additional upstream step 
needed to to documented in the dossier and carried out under GMP to ensure the quality of the active 
substance throughout its life cycle. The applicant was able to re-define one of the starting materials, thus 
resolving the issue. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Only minor changes have been made to the process, including changes of solvent for 
Assessment report  
EMA/644309/2017 
Page 11/146 
  
  
 
purification processes and transfer of the process to a new manufacturer and subsequent scale up. These 
changes resulted in a higher quality active substance. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. Critical process parameters (CPPs) have been 
defined for each step of the process to ensure adequate conversion and selectivity. The specifications and 
control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  type  I  amber  glass  bottles,  with  high  hydrolytic  resistance  and 
polysulfone (PSU) screw caps with double sided polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) protected silicon seals which 
comply  with  the  EC  directive  2002/72/EC  and  EC  10/2011  as  amended.  This  container  closure  system  was 
chosen  as  the  best primary  packaging  option  due to  the  sensitivity  of  the  active  substance  to  light,  oxygen 
and humidity. 
Specification 
The active substance specification (see table below) includes tests for appearance, identification (UV, HPLC), 
assay (HPLC), purity (HPLC and GC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), free palladium (HPLC of 
derivatized Pd), pH, and microbial control (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. A chromatographic test method 
for free palladium was introduced as it has a lower LoQ compared to the previous ICP-OES method.  
The control strategy ensures production of the correct stereoisomer and so no test for enantiomeric purity is 
deemed necessary in the active substance specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Analysis data from three production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. Additional impurity data from batches used in 
toxicology studies were also provided in order to justify the impurity limits in the proposed specification. 
Stability 
Stability data on 9 pilot to production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer and 
3 from a previous manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long 
term conditions (-20 ºC) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Data from 6 of the batches, including 
3 from the previous manufacturer, stored in the intended commercial package for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (5 ºC) were also provided. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, purity and 
water content. The analytical methods used were the same as for release. No significant changes to any of 
the measured parameters were observed and all remained within specification at each time point. Water 
content fluctuated more than other parameters due to the hygroscopic nature of the active substance. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch resulting in significant 
degradation indicating that padeliporfin is photosensitive.

Forced degradation studies were carried out under the following conditions: heat (110 oC); heat and humidity 
(60 oC / 100% RH); acid (0.1M HCl, 60 oC); base (0.1M NaOH, 60 oC); oxidant (H2O2, room temperature). 
Samples degraded under all conditions and it was demonstrated that the analytical methods are stability 
indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months at -20 oC in the proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a lyophilized powder for reconstitution in 5% glucose solution and subsequent 
injection. Two strengths are available containing 200 or 400 mg of the active substance, equivalent to 183 or 
366 mg of padeliporfin free base. 
The aim was to develop a stable formulation of paedliporfin dipotassium. The active substance becomes 
pharmaceutically active on exposure to light of the correct wavelength and must thus be protected from light 
during formulation and storage. It is soluble in aqueous media and sensitive to heat and oxygen. Solid 
formulations were found to be more stable than solutions and so a lyophilised formulation which would 
dissolve rapidly on addition of an aqueous reconstitution liquid to afford a solution of suitable pH for injection 
was sought. 
Mannitol was found to be the best bulking agent of those investigated, affording a stable lyophilisate and 
improving the hydrophilicity of the formulation, thereby increasing its speed of dissolution. It is the sole 
excipient, a well known pharmaceutical ingredient and its quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There 
are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. Water for injections (WFI) is the chosen solvent and is 
removed during freeze drying. 
All processing is carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere to avoid oxidative degradation and under filtered 
light, to avoid photodegradation. Temperature and time of individual steps are limited to avoid degradation. 
The lyophilisation process was optimised to ensure a suitable cake with low moisture content. Parameters for 
freezing as well as primary and secondary drying have been defined. 
Due to the heat-sensitivity of the active substance, terminal sterilisation is not possible. Therefore, sterility is 
ensured by sterile filtration followed by aseptic filling and lyophilisation. Leachable studies have demonstrated 
compatibility with the filters and lyophilisation kit which covers the proposed processing time. 
Leachable studies were also conducted with the injection kit which is opaque to prevent photodegradation. 
The finished product, reconstituted to 9.15 mg/ml padeliporfin in 5% glucose was found to be stable for up to 
2 hours. Suitable reconstitution instructions are found in the SmPC, section 6.6.   
The primary packaging is an amber type 1 glass vial sealed with a rubber stopper crimped with an aluminium 
seal and covered with a plastic flip-off cap. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended 
use of the product. The hermetically sealed container has been shown to maintain sterility throughout the 
proposed shelf life.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  six  main  steps:  formulation;  pre-filtration;  sterile  filtration;  aseptic 
filling; lyophilisation; capping. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The  pre-filtration  step  is  followed  by  a  bioburden  test  to  ensure  a  sufficiently  low  level  of  bioburden  (<10 
CFU/100  ml)  prior  to  sterile  filtration.  Following  sterile  filtration,  each  filter  is  tested  for  integrity  using  the 
bubble point method. A sterility test is subsequently performed on a sample prior to aseptic filling. Following 
stoppering  and  capping,  a  hermeticity  test  is  performed  to  ensure  appropriate  sealing  and  maintenance  of 
sterility. 
The  critical  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  on  three  consecutive  production  scale 
batches of each strength. The process was also validated on 3 pilot scale batches of the 183 mg strength. It 
has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of 
intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form  including 
appearance, identification (UV, HPLC), content (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), water content (KF), average mass 
(Ph. Eur.), uniformity of mass (Ph. Eur.), particulate contamination (Ph. Eur.), reconstitution (visual), pH and 
osmolarity of reconstituted solution (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
No new degradants are formed during finished product manufacture. All impurities are already limited in the 
active substance specification. Limits set are in line with the amounts qualified in toxicology and clinical 
studies. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for eight pilot to commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  16  pilot  to  commercial  scale  batches  of  finished  product  including  7  from  the  original 
manufacturer  of  clinical  material  and  9  from  the  proposed  commercial  manufacturer  (of  which  3  of  each 
strength were manufactured on commercial scale) were provided. Samples were stored for up to 60 months 
under long term conditions (5±3 oC) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25 oC / 60% RH) 
according  to  the  ICH  guidelines.  Studies  using  batches  from  the  proposed  commercial  manufacturer  under 
long  term  conditions  have  been  conducted  up  to  36  months  only  but  the  batches  from  the  previous 
manufacturer are considered representative. The batches were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance, water content, pH of reconstituted solution, identity, assay, impurities 
and  reconstitution.  Particulate  contamination,  sterility  and  bacterial  endotoxin  tests  are  performed  at  the 
start  and  end  of  each  stability  study.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  No  significant 
changes to any of the measured parameters were observed throughout the studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644309/2017 
Page 14/146 
  
  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug  Substances  and  Products.  No  significant  changes  were  observed.  When  stored  in  a  clear  glass  vial 
however,  some  degradation  occurred.  This  indicates that  the  finished  product  is  photosensitive  but that the 
amber vial provides sufficient protection. 
A  second  photostability  study  was  undertaken  using  the  reconstituted  solution  in  the  injection  kit.  Slight 
degradation  was  observed  in  the  clear  kit  after  110  minutes,  although  impurities  were  well  within 
specification. The higher the intensity of light used, the faster the degradation. It is therefore recommended 
to use opaque injection kit where the light intensity in the operating room can’t be controlled. 
An  in-use  stability  study  was  conducted  with  the  reconstituted  finished  product  to  evaluate  short  term 
stability  in  the  original  container  and  in  the  injection  kit.  A  slight  increase  in  one  impurity  was  observed  at 
room  temperature  and  under  refrigerated  conditions  in  the  presence  of  yellow  light,  though  the  level  was 
within specification limits. It is concluded that the reconstituted product remains stable for up to 8 hours. The 
study  was  repeated  in  the  opaque  injection  kit,  stored  at  room  temperature  under  yellow  light  for  up  to  2 
hours. Although an increase in the same impurity was observed, results remained within specification. In-use 
shelf  lives  are  reported  in  the  SmPC,  section  6.3  although  from  a  microbiological  point  of  view,  immediate 
use is recommended. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 60 months stored in a refrigerator (5±3 oC) in the 
outer carton to protect from light as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The limits for impurities have been justified in line with qualified levels. 
The process has been fully validated and it has been shown to provide a sterile finished product suitable for 
injection. Suitable instructions for reconstitution, including how to protect from light, have been provided. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the product information (SmPC and PIL). Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the 
uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical studies were conducted according to GLP with some exception of auxiliary parts of the main 
studies. The core safety pharmacology studies were conducted according to GLP.  
The pharmacology package consisted of pharmacodynamic studies in a variety of animal cancer models - 
prostate cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and renal cancer, with studies completed 
using dogs and pigs.  A safety pharmacology programme was conducted to explore effects of the central 
nervous system (CNS) and respiratory system and coagulation.  In terms of cardiovascular safety, three 
safety pharmacology studies were conducted. 
The general toxicology programme consisted of single and repeat dose toxicity studies in the mouse, rat and 
Cynomolgus monkey. Each study was completed using intravenous administered WST11 (padeliporfin), the 
clinical route of administration. A full range of genotoxicity and photo-genotoxicity studies have been 
completed, alongside local tolerance and antigenicity studies.  Reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity 
studies were not submitted.

Efficacy and tolerance of WST11 in the normal canine prostate (Study No. PREC 0806 PDM) 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the dose escalating effect of a 10-minute i.v. infusion of WST11 
followed by light-activation with a 753 nm diode laser (WST11 - VTP therapy) on the normal prostate of old 
mongrel dogs, using different light fluence rates. Several drug doses and illumination conditions were used to 
assess the efficacy of WST11 - VTP in inducing the necrotic ablation of the prostate: drug doses of 1.0; 2.0; 
5.0; 7.5; 10 and 15 mg/Kg, coupled with 100 to 400 J/cm of fibre (one light dose/prostate lobe). In WST11-
mediated VTP, the coupling of a drug dose of 2.0 mg/kg together with a light-dose of 200 J/cm of fibre was 
shown to safely induce necrosis of the targeted prostate tissue in the normal dog.

Effect on Prostatic Tissue During PDT Using WST11 and WST09 (Study No. STEBA 08-06) 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of WST09 (padoporfin, a predecessor 
molecule) and WST11 in prostatic  tissues.   
Additionally,  pharmacokinetic  dosages  and  other  safety  parameters  were  assessed  over  24 hours post 
injection. This  prospective  study  included  12  animals,  3  groups,  one  group  of  4  animals  administered 
WST09 at the dose of 2 mg/kg, one group of 2 animals administered WST11 at 2mg/kg and one  group of 6 
animals administered WST11 at 5 mg/kg. There were no undue safety issues revealed by the study. Animals 
recovered safely from surgery.  Main conclusions in terms of efficacy are the following:  WST09 and WST11 
with  appropriate  laser  energy  induced  massive  haemorrhagic  necrosis  of  prostatic  parenchyma in the 
normal dog.  The  prostatic  capsule  was  also  affected,  although  this  could  easily be  explained  by the 
proximity between  the  fibres and the capsule, due to the relatively small size of the canine prostates. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were provided (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies were provided which was considered acceptable (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No absorption data were submitted because WST11 is only administered by the intravenous route.  
Distribution studies were characterised in a single rat biodistribution study, and with distribution to blood and 
plasma. WST11 concentrations were determined in pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic samples. Metabolic 
studies were limited to examination in human liver microsomes.  Elimination and potential drug interactions 
with WST11 were not provided (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

Distribution 
The distribution of WST11 was studied following a single intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg in male  Sprague-
Dawley  rats  (Report  PKH/MLT  03672  N, GLP).  WST11  was  quantified  in  plasma,  blood  cells, eyes, bone, 
fat, liver, lung, skin, kidneys, and muscle.  The concentration of WST11 in eyes, fat, skin, and muscle were 
below the LOQ for all the time points. At 4 h postdose, the concentration of WST11 was below the LOQ for all 
the tissues. 
Measurable concentrations of WST11 were observed only in the first few sampling times of plasma, blood 
cells, liver, lung, and kidneys. Maximum concentrations of WST11 were observed in plasma and liver, and 
elimination was rapid. The maximum recovery was observed in liver and represented 26% of the 
administered dose at the first sampling time. The amount decreased rapidly and was below 2% 1 h after 
dosing. A low concentration of WST11 was observed in the eyes and skin, which may suggest a low 
probability of phototoxicity. There was little to no distribution of WST11 to skin tissue or to the rat eye at any 
time-point, from 2 minutes to 168 hours post-dose.   
The in vitro partitioning of WST11 between the cellular-fraction and the plasma-fraction of whole blood was 
evaluated (Report PKH/MLT 04691N, non GLP). Human blood obtained from one healthy volunteer was 
collected using lithium heparinate as anticoagulant. 
The distribution of the WST11 between blood cells and buffer was first carried out in order to determine the 
binding capacity of blood cells. Afterwards, the distribution of WST11 added to whole blood was measured in 
the cellular fraction and in plasma in order to determine the retentional effect of plasma. No significant 
binding of WST11 to the cellular fraction occurred in presence of blood plasma. These results indicated that 
WST11 has a higher affinity for the plasma fraction, perhaps plasma protein, than for blood cells.  
These results correlated with those previously presented in the study (Study HPC/MLT 02 655N/MLT 1.01 in 
which human blood samples were obtained from 1 male/female healthy volunteer and binding to human 
plasma proteins determined using equilibrium dialysis and the blood partitioning methodology), which 
showed that a high percentage of WST11 (98.97 %) was bound to plasma proteins. 
Metabolism 
Three in vitro biotransformation studies were performed with WST11, two with human liver microsomes 
Study 9977, non-GLP and Study 10941/TL, non-GLP), and a third with human liver S9 fractions (Study 
11258/ PKH/MLT 051274N, GLP).  WST11 was incubated with liver microsomes for 60 minutes and the mean 
percentage of parent remaining was 89% (1 µM) and 97% (10 µM).  WST11 was also found 90% unchanged 
when incubated with liver S9 fractions.  WST11 was found unchanged after 60 min incubation. No metabolite 
from Phase I or Phase II was found.

Excretion 
No specific studies were conducted to study excretion of WST11.  The elimination of WST11 was assessed in 
the quantitative tissue distribution study (Report PKH/MLT 03672 N) of WST11 administered to rats. The 
detection of WST11 in the urine and faeces of three individual rats over the 96 h post-dose period. The 
urinary excretion of WST11 is minimal, and that excretion is achieved primarily through fecal elimination 
after biliary excretion. This data is limited to sampling from 3 individual rats, with total recovery in the range 
of 41.5% to 96.4%.

Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were provided (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Examination of the effects of WST11 on male fertility and spermatogenesis has been provided by reviewing 
the effects on rat testes following repeated dose for 4 weeks with WST11.  Histological examination of testes 
sections in the high dose group (150 mg/kg/day) did not reveal an effect on sperm cell population or an 
effect on any stage of spermatogenesis.  The changes noted of seminiferous epithelial degeneration in a 
single high dose rat has been explained as related to the administration procedure, rather than treatment 
related.  This animal also experienced an inflammatory lesion on the tail.

Local Tolerance  
Local Tolerance in the Rabbit After Five Days, 20 mg/kg WST11 (Study CERB 20040101TL or 
PTH/MLT03669N, GLP) 
Three groups of five female New Zealand albino rabbits were administered either WST11 at 20 mg/kg active 
ingredient, sterile and pyrogen-free isotonic saline solution control, or vehicle- control solutions by one daily 
intravenous injection for five days in the left ear, by intra-arterial injection on Day 5 in the right ear (WST11 
20 mg/kg, saline, and vehicle at the same volume as WST11), and by perivenous injection on Day 5 in the 
right ear (WST11 0.5 mL, saline, and vehicle at the same volume as WST11). Injection site and macroscopic 
examination along with histopathology results were the main analyses in this study. 
WST11, as administered in this study did not induce any clinical signs, and no local intolerability was 
attributed to WST11 after dosing by the intravenous, intra-arterial, or perivenous routes.

Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Antigenicity was studied in a single study to evaluate the potential of WST11 to induce immediate 
hypersensitivity in the male Hartley guinea pig after sensitisation by the subcutaneous or intravenous route 
(Study AA27635 or PLG/MLT 051262N, GLP). Animals were divided into 5 groups for both induction and for 
challenge phases, and were treated with 5 or 10 mg/mL WST11 via subcutaneous or intravenous routes (3 
groups).  A vehicle control group (mannitol in 5% glucose) and a positive control group (200 µg/mL 
ovalbumine) were also included.   
Under the experimental conditions of this study, an intravenous challenge administration of WST11 at 10 
mg/mL did not induce mortality or any signs of immediate hypersensitivity in animals sensitized by the 
subcutaneous or intravenous route at 5 or 10 mg/mL. 
Studies on impurities 
In silico qualitative evaluation of the potential carcinogenicity, chromosomes damages, genotoxicity and 
mutagenicity of 11 impurities was performed. None of the structure analysed triggered alerts for 
carcinogenicity, chromosome damage, genotoxicity and mutagenicity. 
Blood Compatibility 
In Vitro Blood Compatibility (Study PLG/MLT 03670N, or MDS AA18401, GLP) 
This study was conducted in order to establish the compatibility of the WST11 formulation and vehicle with 
whole blood and plasma from rats, monkeys, and humans.  WST11 was prepared as a solution at 5 mg/mL in 
the vehicle (3.34 mg/mL mannitol in 5% glucose).  Saline (0.9% NaCl solution) and water for injection were 
used as negative and positive controls, respectively.  Each test solution (WST11, vehicle, negative, and 
positive controls) was mixed with whole blood (obtained from male and female subjects from each species) in 
a 1:5 ratio.   
WST11 at a concentration of 5 mg/mL had no effect on erythrocyte clumping and induce precipitation in rat, 
monkey or human blood.  Due to the colour of WST11 solution, the evaluation of the haemolytic potential of 
WST11 was not possible in this study.  
In Vitro Blood Compatibility (Study Ricerca Biosciences/ AA92816, GLP) 
This second in vitro blood compatibility study was performed with a solution at 10 mg/mL in the same vehicle 
(6.67 mg/mL mannitol in 5% glucose) and performed according to a similar study design of the previous 
study, with the exception that saponin solution (3% w/v) was used in place of water. 
There was no erythrocyte clumping, no precipitate and no sign of haemolysis.  The review of haemolysis 
however was limited due to the colour of the WST11 solution.

Phototoxicity 
Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Assay of WST11 in Balb/c 3T3 Mouse Fibroblasts (Study KMI00002, GLP) 
A study was conducted to evaluate the phototoxicity potential of WST11 as measured by a reduction in 
neutral red uptake in cultures of Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts exposed to test article in the presence versus 
absence of light. The photo-irritancy factor (PIF) was evaluated according to the ZEBET/ECVAM/COLIPA 
recommendations and values obtained (> 0.795 and 14.306) during the trials predicted that the test article 
has a phototoxic potential. 
Preliminary Study Evaluating Phototoxic Potential at 753 nm after Single Injection by Intravenous Route in 
the Guinea Pig (Study CERB 20040426TCO, GLP) 
A preliminary study examined four different energies (0.73, 2.90, 3.99, and 5.80 J/cm2) were used to 
simulate a 20 min skin exposure to the sun.  WST11 was administered intravenously at 20 and 50 mg/kg.  
Guinea pigs treated with WST11 at 20 and 50 mg/kg presented mild to moderate erythema and/or edema at 
laser energies of 2.90, 3.99, and 5.80 J/cm2, but not at 0.73 J/cm2. 
Study Evaluating Phototoxic Potential at 753 nm after Single Injection by Intravenous Route in the Guinea Pig 
(Study CERB 20040427TCO, GLP) 
A subsequent study was conducted to evaluate any possible phototoxic potential after single IV injection of 
50 mg/kg to guinea pigs.  Under the experimental conditions adopted, the animals treated with 50 mg/kg 
and exposed to the laser energies of 3.99 and 5.80 J/cm2 presented skin lesions at 24 and 48 hours. 
Study Evaluating Phototoxic Potential after Single Injection by the Intravenous Route (Study CERB 
20040263STC, GLP) 
A further study was conducted to evaluate any possible phototoxic potential of WST11 following single IV 
injection of 150 mg/kg to guinea pigs (3 Groups of 10 animals (5/sex) exposed to UVA and UVB in the guinea 
pig.  Under the experimental conditions adopted, WST11 (batch 85C91030) formulated at 150 mg/kg (30 
mL/kg) was phototoxic in the guinea pig.

Padeliporfin di-potassium PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. and is not a PBT 
substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. 
Therefore, padeliporfin di-potassium is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Results from the submitted pharmacology studies suggest that intraprostatic VTP with padeliporfin dose of 2 
mg/kg together with a light dose of 200 J/cm is efficient in inducing necrosis in the dog prostate. In addition, 
no major secondary effects, changes in heart rate, oximetry, or body temperature have been observed thus 
far. No evidence of thrombosis in other organs (lung, pulmonary artery, and liver tissues) has been observed, 
confirming that the VTP effect is localized to the prostate.  
The results of studies in other tissues such as biliary, lung and renal tissue did not reveal toxicity on 
haemodynamic parameters (data not shown).   
Given the mechanism of action for padeliporfin, secondary pharmacology studies are not considered 
necessary. 
Safety pharmacology of padeliporfin is considered sufficiently investigated. No effects on CNS, airway 
function (except a slight bronchodilation at high dose, 150 mg/kg), bleeding time were observed. Padeliporfin 
had also no effect on behaviour and physiological function.  A very low liability for prolonged QT interval was 
shown in the hERG in vitro test and based on this weak signal, two in vivo cardiovascular safety 
pharmacology studies were conducted. In the first cardiovascular safety pharmacology study (Study PLG/MLT 
03671N) there were concerns about analytical methods used to quantify plasma sampling and therefore no 
conclusion can be drawn. However, in the second study the NOAEL was close to 100 mg/kg providing an 
acceptable margin of safety of at least 14-fold based on comparison of plasma concentration measured at the 
end of the infusion in monkeys (986 to 1316 g/ml) compared to the Cmax of 70 g/mL in humans at the 
expected therapeutic dose of 4 mg/kg. In the 2-week repeated-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys 
no ECG changes were observed.  
The  pharmacokinetics  programme  for  padeliporfin  was  limited  but  acceptable.  Absorption  studies  were  not 
provided  which  is  accepted  considering  padeliporfin  will  be  administered  via  IV  route.    Data  on  exposure 
however has been obtained from the completed toxicology studies in rats and monkeys.   
Both rodent and non-rodent, repeat-dose toxicokinetic studies were conducted using padeliporfin 
administered intravenously over a range of 25 to 150 mg/kg/day. These doses far exceed the anticipated 
therapeutic range of padeliporfin in humans (2 to 6 mg/kg). There were no apparent toxicokinetic differences 
observed between sexes, and no evidence of accumulation was seen. Although none of the studies were 
specifically designed to assess dose linearity, Cmax was found to increase in a linear fashion with the 
increase of padeliporfin dose in monkeys. This linear relationship was not as evident in the rat, as Cmax does 
not proportionately increase with the dose level. Dose escalation within this range did not result in increased 
toxicity.

Based on three in vitro biotransformation studies the applicant assumes that padeliporfin is metabolically 
stable. It is assumed that padeliporfin is poorly distributed and undergoes faecal excretion based on evidence 
from a small rat distribution study. Considering that treatment with padeliporfin will be a single 
administration in the indication of prostate cancer, it is unlikely that a significant clinical risk of accumulation 
of metabolites would occur. Given the results obtained from human dosing it is reasonable to assume that 
renal excretion of padeliporfin is negligible (see Clinical Pharmacology section). The limited data obtained 
from Study PKH/MLT 03672N implies distribution to liver and plasma followed by rapid elimination, most 
likely biliary before faecal elimination.   
No investigation of potential drug-drug interactions with padeliporfin was provided based on the assumption 
that padeliporfin is metabolically stable and rapidly undergoes faecal elimination, which is acceptable. The 
effect of padeliporfin as a perpetrator of drug interactions is further discussed in the Clinical section. 
Single dose toxicity studies in rodents were carried out by IV route at doses up to 400 mg/kg showing 
essentially CNS and respiratory toxicity for high doses with a large safety margin compared to human clinical 
dose. No target organs were identified in repeat dose studies in rats, with a NOAEL proposed at the top dose 
(150 mg/kg). In monkeys, CNS effects, bradycardia, decrease in food consumption, and regenerative 
anaemia were observed for the high doses and the NOAEL was proposed at 25 mg/kg for the 2 week study 
because 50 mg/kg was not tested. However, the NOAEL is probably at 50 mg/kg, as proposed in the 7-day 
study. Liver was not identified as a target organ, a main difference with the predecessor WST09.  
In vitro genotoxicity testing identified padeliporfin as having weak potential to induce clastogenicity when 
illuminated by ultraviolet (UV); this correlates with the mechanism of action (formation of reactive oxygen 
species) (see SmPC section 5.3).  
Padeliporfin was shown to be cytotoxic in the presence of UVA irradiation (in vitro) and considered phototoxic 
in the guinea pig (in vivo) (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with padeliporfin 
(see SmPC section 5.3). This is considered acceptable given that padeliporfin will be administered acutely, 
and will be treated to male prostate cancer patients only.  All stages of spermatogenesis have been observed 
in animal. Minimal seminiferous epithelial degeneration was also recorded in one high dose male with 
vacuolation. All these changes were considered to be incidental and probably related to the intravenous 
administration procedure (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Prostate fluid is a component of the ejaculate. It is not known if the results of Tookad activation in the 
prostate will affect sperm. To avoid any paternally transmitted damage to the offspring it is recommended as 
a precautionary measure to avoid pregnancy until any hypothetically damaged cells are removed through 
spermatogenic cycling. If the patient is sexually active with women who are capable of getting pregnant, he 
and/or his partner should use an effective form of birth control to prevent getting pregnant during a period of 
90 days after the VTP procedure (see SmPC section 4.6). 
Regarding blood compatibility, due to the colour of padeliporfin solution, the evaluation of the haemolytic 
potential of padeliporfin was not possible in rat, monkey, or human blood. The clinical evidence available at 
the moment is sufficient to rule out an haemolytic cause of concern for padeliporfin. 
The submitted ERA was updated with the calculation of the PEC surface water considering the prevalence 
data from 2012. The PECs surface water, based on both Fpen-values, was well below the action limit of 0.01 
µg/L. The obtained PECs values are considered conservative enough considering the proposed indication and 
hospital administration. The determination of log P for palladium-bacteriopheophorbide can be supported.

Overall, it is agreed that the use of Tookad will not pose a risk to the environment and the wording 
introduced to the Section 6.6 of SmPC and to PL are considered adequate, i.e. any unused medicinal product 
or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical data package is considered acceptable. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for 
humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology and repeated dose toxicity (see SmPC section 
5.3).

The pharmacokinetic properties of Tookad were studied in 42 healthy human male subjects (without 
photoactivation) (Study MLT-1.01) and in 70 patients with localised prostate cancer (after photoactivation) 
(Study CLIN801PCM201 and Study CLIN901PCM202).

In Study MLT-1.01, the PK parameters of WST11 were evaluated in 42 healthy male subjects, aged 
between 18 and 40 years with a BMI of 19 to 29.0 kg/m2. The study was conducted between 24 January and 
3 July 2005. WST11 was administered as a single, 10 min, intravenous infusion at escalating doses of 1.25 to 
15 mg/kg and the catheter was removed immediately after the end of the injection. 
In Study PCM201, the PK parameters of Tookad were evaluated in 40 male patients suffering from localized 
prostate cancer. Tookad was administered as a single, 10 min, intravenous infusion at escalating doses of 2, 
4 and 6 mg/kg followed by percutaneous transperineal interstitial irradiation with laser light at 753 nm at 200 
J/cm, using fibres positioned in the prostate lobes.  
In Study PCM202, PK of Tookad was evaluated in 30 patients suffering from localized prostate cancer. 
Tookad was administered as a single, 10 min, intravenous infusion at escalating doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg. This 
was followed by light activation delivered through one or multiple transperineal interstitial optical fibres using 
753 nm laser light at escalating fixed energy doses of 200 J/cm and 300 J/cm.  
Standard plasma PK parameters were calculated: Cmax (ng/mL), Tmax (h), AUCt (ng/mL.h), AUCinf 
(ng/mL.hr) and %AUC extra (percentage of extrapolated AUC), plasma half-life, plasma clearance and 
apparent volume of distribution.  
Absorption  
Tookad is administered intravenously and is therefore completely bioavailable. 
Distribution 
In healthy human male subjects, the mean volume of distribution ranged from 0.064-0.279 L/kg, for 
posologies from 1.25 to 15 mg/kg of padeliporfin di-potassium indicating distribution into extracellular fluid. A 
similar mean distribution volume was seen in patients with localised prostate cancer treated with 
2 and 4 mg/kg of padeliporfin di-potassium (0.09-0.10 L/kg respectively).  
Study PKH/MLT04691N investigated two in vitro methodologies, equilibrium dialysis and partitioning, to 
determine the binding of WST11 to plasma proteins. Results showed that blood partitioning allowed for the 
characterization of a binding process between WST11 and plasma proteins with a value of binding percentage 
of 98.97%. 
The distribution of WST11 in vitro between human blood cells (mostly erythrocytes) and plasma was also 
investigated. No binding to red blood cells occurred in the presence of plasma protein, indicating that WST11 
has a higher affinity for plasma protein than for blood cells.

Elimination 
Clearance of padeliporfin di-potassium in healthy male subjects treated from 1.25 mg/kg up to 15 mg/kg of 
padeliporfin di-potassium ranged from 0.0245 to 0.088 L/h/kg. Based on popPK analysis (see further below) 
the estimated half-life is 1.19 h ± 0.08 at 4 mg/kg of padeliporfin di-potassium. A similar mean clearance 
range was seen in patients with localised prostate cancer treated with 4 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg of padeliporfin 
di-potassium (0.04-0.06 L/h/kg respectively). Urinary excretion of padeliporfin in healthy human subjects 
was very low (< 0.2 % of the dose).  
No specific studies to study excretion in humans were provided. Taking into account its molecular mass and 
the very low urinary excretion of the molecule, faecal elimination is the most probable route of elimination in 
human. 
Dose proportionality 
The  pharmacokinetic  population  in  study  MLT-1.01  included  all  the  subjects  who  received  one  dose  of  the 
study  drug  and  for  whom  a  complete  pharmacokinetic  profile  was  available  (N=41).  The  results  from  study 
MLT-1.01 obtained for plasma analysis showed that Cmax increased linearly with the doses from 1.25 to 15 
mg/kg of WST11 covering the therapeutic range. Tmax was unchanged whatever the dose between 1.25 and 
15 mg/kg of WST11. The terminal plasma half-life (t1/2) at 15 mg/kg was 8 h ± 4 h. Due to low plasmatic 
concentration on lower doses, t1/2 could only be determined at the highest dose and no comparison among 
other doses is given. The AUCt increased linearly with the doses from 1.25 to 10 mg/kg. 
In  Study  CLIN801  PCM201,  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  Tookad  were  evaluated  in  40  male  patients 
suffering from localized prostate cancer. Five patients were re-treated (dose 4 mg/kg).

Pharmacokinetics parameters in patients after retreatment (n=5) 
In  the  study  CLIN901  PCM202,  the  pharmacokinetic  was  evaluated  on  30  patients  suffering  from  localized 
prostate cancer. The first three patients entered into the study were treated with WST11 2 mg/kg with 200 
J/cm,  and  the  next  six  patients  have  been  treated  with  WST11  2  mg/kg  with  300J/cm.  The  remaining  21 
patients were treated with WST11 4 mg/kg with 200 J/cm.

Population PK analysis 
Based on data from study MLT-1.01, WST11 concentration time data were modelled with two-compartment 
model with a zero-order bolus dose, an infusion whose duration is modelled. A strong effect of the dose on 
clearance was included using the Emax model. Between-subjects (IIV) variability on PK parameters: 
clearance (CL), volume of distribution of central compartment (V), inter-compartmental clearance (Q), 
volume of distribution of peripheral compartment and duration of infusion was estimated with exponential 
variance models and a proportional variance model described the residual error. A first order conditional 
estimation (FOCE) method with interaction was used. The effect of demographic factors on apparent 
clearance was initially assessed graphically. No obvious effect of any demographic factors could be observed 
on the plots of between subjects' variability (individual deviations from the population value) on clearance 
versus demographic co variates (weight, height, BSA, BMI and age). These effects were further evaluated by 
univariate analysis. No demographic factor affected the PK parameters of WST11. The apparent clearance 
decreased with increasing actual dose following an Emax model. The population apparent clearance ranged 
from 6 L/h (dose of 79 mg) to 1.98 L/h (dose of 1110mg). The duration of infusion was estimated at 0.204 h 
(or 12 minutes). The volume of distribution of central compartment was 3 L, and the volume of the peripheral 
compartment was 1.15 L.  
The inter-compartmental clearance was 0.137 L/h. Between subjects' variability on clearance and volumes 
was low. The between subjects' variability of inter compartment clearance was greater, around 50 %. The 
variability on the duration of infusion was low, 12%. The residual variability was low to moderate with a CV of 
21%. 
Based on the estimation of the Inter-occasion variability on 10 patients that were re-treated, intra-individual 
variability was found to be low for infusion duration (25.4%), clearance (20.2%) and volume of the central 
compartment (23.9%). Intra-individual variability was high for inter-compartmental clearance (56.7%) and 
for volume of the peripheral compartment (81.4%).

The applicant provided the conclusions obtained in several subsequent evaluations of the PopPK model that 
was initially developed (data not shown). Several re-runs of the initial model were done with different subsets 
of the available data. To further substantiate the similarity of PK between healthy subjects and patients, the 
original model was run independently with two subsets of data (heathy or patients), resulting in model 
parameters that were, generally, similar. To further substantiate the effect of the continuous illumination of 
the targeted prostate area, a statistical comparison (Wald test) was performed to gauge the effect of the 
laser exposure intensity on each PK parameter. Only the perfusion time (D) and inter-compartmental 
clearance were shown to be different between treatments, which can be explained by a different collection 
protocol. Similar approaches on the race, age, ALB, ProTime, BIL, ALAT, ASAT, GGT and ALCPH as covariates, 
had shown no relevant findings with implications on the PK of WST11.

Additional tests were conducted to study the in vitro CYP inhibition in optimal conditions (protection from 
light) (see table below). Direct inhibition was tested in various CYP isoforms.

The fold shift in IC50 could not be determined for any isoform due to the lack of measurable IC50 values 
under any of the assay conditions. There was no marked difference in the percentage inhibition achieved 
following a pre-incubation in the presence or absence of NADPH for any of the isoforms tested. Inhibition 
following a 30 min pre-incubation with or without NADPH tended to be greater than that observed in the 
absence of pre-incubation. 
In vitro studies were also performed in HEK293 cells to determine if WST11 was a substrate of OATP1B1 or 
OATP1B3. These studies showed that showed that WST11 is unlikely to be a substrate of OATP1B1 or 
OATP1B3. Additional in vitro experiments were conducted in order to determine the possible uptake and 
efflux transporters. WST11 was shown not to be a substrate of BSEP, MRP2, OATP2B1 and OCT1 (SLC 
transporters) (data not shown).

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Prostate necrosis on Day 7 gadolinium multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mp-MRI) scans 
The Phase 2 studies (PCM201, PCM202 and PCM203) investigated, in an exploratory fashion, the relationship 
between  energy  delivery  and  prostate  necrosis  (see  also  section  on  dose-response  studies).  An  adjusted 
prostate volume was used to account for transient prostate swelling. Prostate volume was enlarged at Day 7 
post  treatment  before  decreasing  by  Month  3  and  again  slightly  at  Month  6.  The  adjusted  Day  7  prostate 
necrosis  percentage  was  the  proportion  of  prostate  necrosis  volume  in  the  treated  lobe  by  planimetry 
compared with half the prostate volume by planimetry considering the average between the baseline and Day 
7 volumes. The prostatic necrosis % conveys the proportion of necrosis in the treated lobe without reference 
to the tumour. 
Study CLIN801 PCM201 
Study Title: Vascular-Targeted Photodynamic therapy using WST11 in patients with localized prostate cancer. 
This study was conducted in England, France and Canada, with a total of 8 sites that recruited subjects. 
Forty subjects received a single IV administration dose of WST11 (2, 4 or 6 mg/kg and 10-minute infusion) 
followed by continuous illumination of the prostate gland through optical fibres at 753 nm (200J/cm), for 22 
minutes and 15 seconds, starting after the end of the infusion. 
Primary objective: to identify optimal treatment conditions. Apart from the dose of the drug, other 
parameters are the total energy delivered and the density of energy delivered by unity of prostate volume. 
The total energy delivered was calculated by multiplying the laser-applied energy (200J/cm) by the total 
length in centimetres of the illumination tip of the fibres (all fibres used are considered). The figure below 
shows the correlation between the total energy delivered (in Joules) and volume of necrosis observed at day 
7 (in cm3).

Figure 2 Correlation between the total energy delivered and volume of necrosis observed at day 7 
(33 subjects treated at 4 mg/kg and 200 J/cm) 
The  mean  necrosis  volume  at  Day  7  after  treatment,  of  all  doses  combined  (38  patients)  was  fairly  low  at 
24.2 mL (37.8%). Prostate necrosis % was higher with 4mg/kg Tookad [42.2% ± 18.2 (range 11.5-80.0%)] 
compared to 2mg/kg (7.2%) and 6mg/kg (12.2%). Bilateral treatment mean necrosis volume at Day 7 was 
36.7 mL (51.9%) for 14 patients compared to 19.8 mL (35.0%) for 19 patients receiving unilateral treatment 
with 4mg/kg WST11. 
To take into account the density of energy used by unit of prostate volume, a ‘Light Density Index’ (LDI) 
corresponding to the ratio of cumulated lengths (in centimetres) of illumination tip of the fibres used, to the 
volume of prostate intended to be treated (in cubic centimetres) was calculated (i.e. LDI = N cm of 
illumination tip of the fibres at 200 J/cm/N cm3/ targeted prostate volume). A target threshold of 1 was 
defined (Light Density Index <1 or ≥1). This was identified on the basis of the percentage of necrosis at Day 
7. 
The table below shows that the mean percentage of necrosis of the targeted prostate tissue in patients 
treated with a therapeutic Light Density Index ≥1 was significantly higher than for patients with an index <1: 
95% versus 59% (p<0.01).

Biopsy Results 
38 subjects were included in the efficacy (evaluable) population, out of which 28 subjects were included in 
the optimal dose-energy population (4 mg/kg and 200 J/cm).

Of the 38 subjects, 8 had a bilateral disease and were treated bilaterally, 7 had a unilateral disease but 
treated bilaterally, and the remaining 23 subjects were treated unilaterally. 
For all types of treatment in the efficacy population, 20 of 38 subjects (52.6%) had a negative biopsy, 17 
(44.7%) had a positive biopsy and 1 (2.6%) had no biopsy performed at month 6. 
Of the 28 patients treated per protocol with 4 mg/kg (whatever the LDI applied), 15 (53.6%) had negative 
biopsies at 6 months and 13 (46.4%) had positive one. The one-sided exact binomial probability of this 
observation (compared to the 40%/60% rate expected) was 0.10 (power 90%), that is just above the preset 
level of significance (<0.10). 
When only the 12 patients treated under optimal treatment conditions (dose of 4 mg/kg and LDI≥1) were 
considered, the percentage of negative biopsies was 83.3%, which was associated with an exact probability 
of 0.003 as compared to expectations (this was considered as an exploratory analysis). The table below 
summarizes these results. 
Table 18 Biopsy results in PCM201 study (4 mg/kg – 200 J/cm) 
The study also showed that simultaneous bilateral treatment was less likely to allow complete coverage with 
an adequate LDI in both lobes. 
Study CLIN801 PCM202 
Study Title: “A Prospective, multicenter phase 1/2 safety and tolerability study of unilateral Vascular-
Targeted Photodynamic Therapy using WST11 in patients with localized Prostate Cancer 
This study was conducted in the United States of America, with a total of 5 sites that recruited subjects. 
Primary objective: to define the study drug and light dosage combination that achieves negative biopsy in the 
treated lobe at Month 6 and to determine the local safety and tolerability effects, including toxicity, of Tookad 
VTP treatment in patients with localized prostate cancer. 
This was an exploratory study with the main objective to determine optimal treatment conditions. It was 
started before these optimal treatment conditions were determined from PCM201 and PCM203. 
As data from those studies became available, a decision was made to treat the remaining patients with 4 
mg/kg, 200 J/cm.

Table 19 Number of patients per treatment scheme in the PCM202 study 
Day  7  necrosis  percentage  was  greater  in  the  higher  treatment  group  (64.1%  with  4  mg/kg  WST11,  200 
J/cm Light Energy Level) and this was variable between individuals (4.8-108.9%), partly due to differences in 
prostate  size.  In  comparison  %  prostatic  necrosis  was  46.9%  with  2mg/kg  WST11,  200J/cm.  Prostate 
necrosis % was lower with 300J/cm (13.8%) than 200J/cm combined with 2mg/kg Tookad, possibly because 
only a single fibre was used. 
Overall, 19 patients out of 30 (63.3%) had negative biopsies in the treated lobe at Month 6. In patients 
treated with optimal dose and light optimal conditions and a LDI ≥ 1, the percentage of negative biopsies 
was 73.3%.

Study CLIN801 PCM203 
Study Title: “Vascular-Targeted Photodynamic Therapy using WST11 in patients with localised prostate 
cancer”. 
This was a European multi-centre, Phase 2, open label trial.  
Primary objective: to determine the optimal treatment conditions (study drug dose, light dose, number of 
fibres, length of fibres, and configuration of fibres) to achieve prostate cancer tumour ablation and to assess 
the effects of Tookad VTP treatment in patients with localized prostate cancer). 
A total of 86 patients have been included in this study, one patient did not receive the study drug; the 
remaining 85 patients have been treated according to the following groups: 
o  Group TS1 corresponded to conservative hemiablation with 4 mg/kg, 200 J/cm and a high density of 
fibre-energy applied (close to optimal treatment conditions that were defined in PCM201). 
Assessment report  
EMA/644309/2017 
Page 45/146 
  
  
 
 
o  Group TS2 was conservative suboptimal ablation of the whole gland, with 4 mg/kg and 200 J/cm and 
a safe use of a high density of fibre (suboptimal density). 
o  Group TS3 corresponded to conservative hemiablation with 6 mg/kg. 
o  Group TS4 corresponded to treatment with 4 mg/kg, 200 J/cm in one lobe and 300 J/cm in the other 
lobe. 
Prostate necrosis % appeared higher with 4mg/kg Tookad and 200J/cm Light energy in Study PCM203 
(87.6% unilateral, 71.5% bilateral) than PCM202. The 6mg/kg Tookad resulted in a lower % necrosis 
(63.9%) than 4mg/kg Tookad probably due to the lower relative length of the optical fibres to treatment size 
as discussed later. Again % necrosis was lowest with use of a 300J/cm single fibre (47.7%). 
Among the performed biopsies of 83 patients overall 73.5% were found negative for cancer in the treated 
lobe. 
Table 21 Negative biopsies at 6 months in PCM203 
In patients treated under optimal treatment conditions (Group TS1), the percentage of negative biopsies for 
cancer in the treated lobe was 82.6%. 
Overall conclusion 
Extraprostatic  necrosis  was  seen  with  all  dose/  light  energy  combinations.  It  tended  to  increase  as  intra-
prostatic necrosis increased but was proportionally greater with bilateral treatment.  
The total energy delivered was calculated by multiplying the laser-applied energy (e.g. 200J/cm) by the total 
length in centimetres of the illumination tip of the fibres. All 3 studies showed a correlation between the total 
energy  delivered  (J)  and  volume  of  necrosis  observed  at  Day  7  (cm3).  This  was  most  evident  in  Study 
PCM201  in  33  subjects  treated  with  4mg/kg  and  200J/cm  (R2=  0.7827)  and  weakest  in  PCM203  looking  at 
4mg/kg and 6mg/kg WST11 (R2= 0.318).

To  account  for  prostate  volume  as  a  probable  confounding  factor  the  Light  Density  Index  (LDI)  was 
calculated.  The  LDI  corresponds  to  the  ratio  of  the  cumulative  length  of  illuminated  fibre  tips  (cm)  to  the 
volume  (cc)  of  the  targeted  zone  to  be  treated.  The  targeted  zone  corresponds  to  the  lobe  containing  the 
positive  biopsies.  Its  volume  is  measured  after  prostate  delineation  using  the  treatment  guidance  software. 
The relationship between the LDI and prostate necrosis at Day 7 was investigated in a post-hoc exploratory 
analysis. In Phase II studies, treatment conditions corresponding to an LDI ≥ 1 were associated with a mean 
rate  of  necrosis  of  the  targeted  zone  at  day 7  of  89  %  ±  20.75  for  unilateral  and  79 %  for  bilateral 
treatments. These treatments were performed with at least a 3 month interval.  
In study PCM203 the linear association between prostate necrosis at Day 7 and the LDI (rather than energy 
delivered)  was  stronger,  with  a  Pearson’s  correlation  coefficient  of  0.749  (p<0.0001).  The  mean  Day  7 
necrosis  percentage  for  the  patients  with  LDI  ≥1  treated  with  4  mg/kg  WST11  and  200  J/cm  Light  Energy 
Level  was  74.3%.  There  was  no  relationship  between  LDI  and  mean  prostate  necrosis  at  Months  3  or  6, 
which was relatively low across the treatment groups.   
Data  from  study  PCM201  was  studied  in  order  to  establish  any  concentration-effect  relationship  between 
plasma Cmax, length of light-emitting fibres and volume of necrosis. This model gave a correlation between 
Cmax and volume of necrosis normalised per cm of fibre (R²= 0.894), explaining part of the relation between 
PK and PD response. LDI allowed data to be normalized with respect to the prostate volume and to study its 
influence  on  the  volume  of  necrosis  normalised  per  cm  of  fibres.  The  change  in  R2  (0.894  to  0.896)  was 
minimal  by  adding  the  LDI  parameter,  suggesting  no  significant  influence  of  the  LDI  parameter  on  the 
volume of necrosis normalised per cm of fibres (p=0.3759). Cmax of Tookad is an important influence on the 
volume of necrosis.  
The optimal treatment parameters as determined by these trials were a dose of 4 mg/kg dose of Tookad, a 
light energy of 200 J/cm and a minimum of 1 for the LDI.   
Histopathology 
Twelve  patients  underwent  prostatectomy  within  the  24-month  time  frame  of  the  Phase  3  study.  Pathology 
reports  were  obtained  for  9  of  the  12  patients  who  underwent  radical  prostatectomy  after  Month  12  in  the 
VTP arm in PCM301. The collection of histology data was not planned in the protocol and CRF so it was not 
possible to get complete information for all the patients. In all except one of the patients there was bilateral 
tumour; one patient had Gleason 4+3, 6 patients had Gleason 3+4 and 2 patients had Gleason 3+3.  
Location of tumour in relation to the area of VTP-induced necrosis was provided in 6 patients. In 5 patients 
tumour  was  located  outside  the  VTP  scar  at  a  variable  distance  from  1mm  up  to  fibrosis  not  visible  on  the 
same specimen piece. In one patient tumour was inside the treated area. 
Skin phototoxicity 
Skin photo- tests were conducted on all subjects in the Phase 1 study MLT1.01. Photosensitization increased 
with  the  administered  dose  of  WST11.  After  irradiation  with  total  solar  spectrum  and  with  1  MED, 
photosensitization was limited to the first 3 hours after dosing in the 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg dose groups, to the 
first 6 hours after dosing in the 5 and 7.5 mg/kg dose groups and to the 24 and 48 first hours after dosing in 
the 10 and 15 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. One subject in the highest drug dose group (15 mg/kg) had 
a positive 24-hour photo-test. 
Ophthalmic  evaluation  was  performed  in  the  Phase  1  study  at  screening,  after  48  hours  and  at  Day  6;  no 
abnormalities  were  observed.  An  inclusion  criterion  was  a  normal  ophthalmologic  exam  and  subjects  were 
kept in dimmed indoor light for 2 days.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Tookad is administered as a single 10-minute intravenous administration of 4 mg/kg. As such, the absolute 
bioavailability was considered as 100%. Then the prostate is illuminated immediately for 22 minutes 15 
seconds by laser light at 753 nm delivered via interstitial optical fibres from a laser device at a power of 150 
mW/cm of fibre, delivering an energy of 200 J/cm.  
Padeliporfin di-potassium is highly bound to human plasma proteins (99 %). The volume of distribution 
obtained in the various human studies was around 4 – 6 L. Minimal metabolism of padeliporfin was observed 
in in vitro metabolism studies in human liver microsomes and S9 fractions. No metabolites of padeliporfin 
were observed in these studies (see non clinical section and SmPC section 5.2). No in vitro or in vivo studies 
have been conducted with radiolabelled padeliporfin. Therefore, the possibility for some in vivo metabolism of 
padeliporfin cannot be fully excluded (see SmPC section 5.2).  
The comparison of the PK results from the phase 1 study Study MLT-1.01 and the two studies in patients 
(Study PCM201 and PCM202) showed that there is no significant difference in the kinetics of the drug 
between patients with prostate cancer and healthy subjects. 
Although the continuous illumination duration is small (22 minutes 15 seconds), no assessment was made 
regarding the eventual effect of this on the overall elimination of the drug. However, this effect is not 
expected to be significant based on PK parameters obtained in the various clinical studies. 
The effects of age, weight and race were investigated in healthy volunteers and patients. The results of the 
population  PK  study  showed  that  age,  race,  and  markers  of  hepatic  function  were  unlikely  to  have  a 
substantial and biologically significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of Tookad. The body weight of patients 
(range 60-120 kg) presented a minor impact on the Tookad. Tookad pharmacokinetic parameters for doses 
up to 5 mg/kg of padeliporfin di potassium (see SmPC section 5.2). 
No study was conducted in patients with impaired renal function. Very small amount of Tookad soluble is 
excreted via the kidney. It is not expected that patients with renal impairment would have any alteration in 
blood levels or excretion. Hence no adjustment in dose is required in these patients.  
This medicinal product contains potassium and in general the dose (3.66 mg/kg) will be less than 1 mmol (39 
mg) i.e. essentially ‘potassium free’. However, this will be exceeded in patients heavier than 115 kg. This 
should be taken into consideration in patients with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled 
potassium diet where a rise in serum potassium would be considered detrimental (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 
4.4). 
There is no data available in patients with hepatic impairment. Biliary excretion is the major route of 
elimination of the drug. Therefore, exposure to padeliporfin is expected to be increased and/or prolonged in 
patients with hepatic impairment. No specific dosage recommendation can be given. Tookad should be used 
with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see Section 4.2 of the SmPC). The liver is not a 
target organ for toxicity and, with a single dose only to be given to cover the VTP procedure, the only 
increased precautions are the possible need for prolonged protection from light after the patient is discharged 
assuming that the patient were otherwise considered suitable for general anaesthesia. Therefore, performing 
a study in subjects with moderate to severe liver impairment, who are unlikely to be candidates for VTP, 
would not be justified. Tookad is contraindicated in patients who have been diagnosed with cholestasis (see 
section 4.3). 
Assessment report  
EMA/644309/2017

The majority of patients in the studies performed was 50-year of age or older. There is no relevant use of 
Tookad in the paediatric population in the treatment of low-risk localised prostate cancer. Very few patients 
aged over 75 years were enrolled into studies where pharmacokinetic measurements were taken so it is not 
known if there is a difference in these older patients compared to patients less than 75 years of age. No 
specific posology adjustment is necessary in this population (see SmPC sections 4.2, 5.2 and 5.1).  
In vitro studies indicate that Tookad is unlikely to be a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OATP2B1, P-
gp, BCRP, MRP2 or BSEP hepatic uptake transporters (see SmPC section 5.2). Uptake was shown to be 
partially increased in the presence of albumin and was temperature sensitive. It is suggested that the 
mechanism of uptake is via albumin receptors on the cells or via passive endocytosis and uptake into liver 
cells and hepatocytes (Mazor O, et al, Photochemistry and Photobiology 2005). These pathways are 
recognised but are considered to be of relatively low capacity.  
Tookad was initially shown to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and 1B3 and several CYPs. However, updated in 
vitro results showed no inhibition of CYP enzymes when WST11 is protected from light, suggesting no 
inhibition of cytochrome P450s. Since this closely mimics the clinical situation the updated results are 
considered more reliable in the perspective of a risk assessment. A time dependency in vitro study showed 
some inhibition with a pre-incubation, but in the absence of NADPH the inhibition, even with a 30 min 
incubation, was less than 40% at the highest concentration of 5 µM. Therefore, Tookad at therapeutic 
concentrations is unlikely to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes but could inhibit both OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
transporters. The magnitude of interaction has not been investigated clinically but a transient increase in the 
plasma concentration of co-administered substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 cannot be ruled out. The use 
of medicinal products that are substrates of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 (repaglinide, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, 
pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, bosentan, glyburide) for which concentration-dependent serious 
adverse events have been observed should be avoided on the day of Tookad infusion and for at least 
24 hours after administration. Co-administration should be done with caution and close monitoring is 
recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
In vitro studies also indicate that Tookad does not inhibit P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OCT1, BCRP and BSEP 
(see sections 4.5 and 5.2).  
The applicant has proposed a plausible mechanism of action for Tookad VTP. Erythrocyte aggregation has 
been described leading to blood clots at the interface of the arterial supply and tumour microcirculation, 
resulting in permanent occlusion of the entire tumour vasculature including the rim. Tumour necrosis results 
from a mixture of a coagulative process and endothelial cell apoptosis induced by reactive nitrogen species. 
In theory, vessel obstruction is confined to the tumour vascular bed due to the PK of WST11 with minimal 
tissue extravasation and fast clearance from the circulation. Free radicals are generated and react locally; the 
mean depth of necrosis visible on contrast enhanced MRI following Tookad VTP was 6 mm. Tookad showed 
weak clastogenic activity when activated by UV light. There was no evidence of increased neoplasia in the 
general toxicology studies with treatment administered over 14 days (see non-clinical data). Tookad is 
expected to be given once to patients. Furthermore, there currently is insufficient evidence to add this risk as 
an important potential risk in the RMP.

Taking  into  account  the  mechanism  of  action  and  absence  of  surrogate  markers,  the  applicant  could  not 
identify  any  direct  pharmacodynamic  effects  purely  due  to  Tookad  to  correlate  with  PK.  The  applicant  used 
surrogate  markers  to  assess  the  PD  effect  of  the  Tookad:  light  combination,  namely  MRI  scans  and 
histopathology review. The closest correlate to a PD marker is probably the Day 7 percentage necrosis on the 
MRI  scans.  Necrosis  was  observed  by  MRI  at  day  7  in  patients  with  localised  prostate  cancer  who  received 
Tookad VTP. There was a correlation between the total energy delivered and the volume of necrosis observed 
at day 7 (see SmPC section 5.1). Mean Day 7 percentage necrosis was higher with 4 mg/kg Tookad than 2 
mg/kg but in the patients treated with 6 mg/kg Tookad there was no increase above that seen with 4 mg/kg. 
Higher percentage prostate necrosis was also linked to greater extra-prostatic necrosis. 
A LDI ≥1 was determined as optimal for achieving adequate prostate necrosis. Based on results from study 
PCM202, it appeared associated with a greater volume of necrosis on Day 7 MRI and greater share of 
patients with negative biopsy at 6 months (see Clinical efficacy data and SmPC section 5.1). LDI ≥1 is thus 
an important predictor of outcome and treatment should not be undertaken in patients where an LDI ≥ 1 
cannot be achieved (see section 5.1). There was no significant correlation between the percentage of 
prostate necrosis on Day 7 MRI and the likelihood of a negative prostate biopsy at follow-up. 
Based on the results of the three phase 2 studies, the optimal treatment parameters were determined as a 
dose of 4 mg/kg dose of Tookad, a light energy of 200 J/cm and a minimum of 1 for the LDI. This is 
considered acceptable. 
An LDI ≥1 was achieved for most patients in the Phase III study on initial treatment and also on first 
treatment of the contralateral lobe. An LDI ≥1 was possible in most patients with bigger prostates, involving 
more fibres and a longer procedure (see results under clinical efficacy). To ensure efficacy, during the 
procedure the number and the length of the optical fibres are selected depending on the shape and the size 
of the prostate and the optical fibres are positioned transperineally into the prostate gland under ultrasound 
guidance to achieve a Light Density Index (LDI) ≥ 1 in the targeted tissue. Planning of optical fibre 
positioning should be performed at the beginning of the procedure using the treatment guidance software.  
An  LDI  ≥1  was  rarely  achieved  on  retreatment  (27.3%  of  cases).  It  was  postulated  that  due  to  fibrosis  a 
lower  LDI  might  be  sufficient  in  these  cases.  This  is  speculative  and  it  could  equally  be  hypothesised  that 
fibrotic tissue would require a higher LDI. Insufficient patients underwent retreatment of the ipsilateral lobe 
or sequential treatment of the contralateral lobe to determine the efficacy and safety of a second Tookad VTP 
procedure (see SmPC section 4.4). Retreatment is thus not recommended. 
A whole lobe treatment of the prostate is appropriate as the disease can be accurately located anatomically; 
graded  histologically  and  all  involved  areas  of  the  prostate  can  be  targeted.  The  5  mm  security  margin  for 
fibre placement is included in the treatment volume. In addition, significant protection to the nerve bundles is 
provided by the prostatic fascia. In the PCM301 study no patient was excluded based on the location of the 
tumour  at  baseline.  Although  the  study  was  not  designed  to  identify  the  impact  of  tumour  location,  an 
analysis of the outcomes based on the location of the tumour(s) at baseline, Month 12 and Month 24 showed 
a well-balanced distribution of the tumours within the apex, the median zone and the base (data not shown). 
The  biopsy  results  and  genitourinary  adverse  events,  based  on  the  location  of  positive  biopsies  at  baseline, 
have shown comparable results (data not shown). A statement has been included in the SmPC to inform that 
before  treatment,  the  tumour  must  be  accurately  located  and  confirmed  as  unilateral  using  high  resolution 
biopsy strategies based on current best practice, such as multi-parametric MRI based strategies or template-
based biopsy procedures. (see SmPC section 4.4).

There  is  limited  biopsy  data  beyond  2  years  after  Tookad  treatment,  so  long-term  efficacy  has  not  been 
determined. Residual tumour has been  found on follow-up biopsy of the treated lobe at 12 and 24 months, 
usually  outside of  the  treated  volume,  but occasionally  within the  area of  necrosis.  There  is  limited data  on 
long-term  outcomes  and  on  potential  consequences  of  post-  Tookad  local  scarring  in  case  of  disease 
progression. At present Tookad -VTP has been shown to defer the need for radical therapy and its associated 
toxicity. Longer follow-up will be required to determine whether Tookad -VTP will be curative in a proportion 
of patients (see SmPC section 4.4).  
Following Tookad VTP, patients should undergo digital rectal examination (DRE) and have their serum PSA 
monitored, including an assessment of PSA dynamics (PSA doubling time and PSA velocity). PSA should be 
tested every 3 months for first 2 years post VTP and every 6-month thereafter in order to assess PSA 
dynamics (PSA Doubling Time (DT), PSA velocity). Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) is recommended to be 
performed at least once a year and more often if clinically justified. Routine biopsy is recommended at 2-4 
years and 7 years post VTP, with additional biopsies based on clinical/ PSA assessment. mpMRI may be used 
to improve the decision making but not, at present, to replace biopsy.  
The safety and efficacy of subsequent radical therapy (surgery or radiotherapy) is uncertain. Limited 
information is available regarding the safety and efficacy of radical prostatectomy after Tookad -VTP. In small 
surgical series, there have been reports of T3 tumours, positive margins and impotence. In the 24 months of 
the pivotal European Phase III study, no patients underwent radical radiotherapy post Tookad -VTP (see 
SmPC section 4.4).  
Considering the treatment might have implications for later radical treatment, post-operative histology should 
be reviewed and radiotherapy outcomes collected. A post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES: study CLIN1501 
PCM401)  with  a  7-year  follow  up  period  will  be  conducted  to  collect  this  information  and  is  included  as  a 
condition  in  Annex  II  of  the  opinion.  This  study  is  considered  adequate  to  assess  the  long  term  efficacy  of 
Tookad.  The  study  will  also  collect  safety  data  and  is  reflected  in  the  RMP  (see  clinical  safety  and  RMP 
section). Tumour location in relation to toxicity and oncological outcome will be captured. Further long-term 
efficacy and safety will also be provided from study PCM301 FU5 (see discussion on clinical efficacy, Annex II 
and RMP). 
Furthermore, the effect of causing blood vessel occlusion on the ability to later treat patients with surgery or 
radiotherapy will be monitored by additional pharmacovigilance (see clinical safety and RMP).  
There is a risk of skin and eye photosensitivity with exposure to light post Tookad -VTP. The advice regarding 
phototoxicity  (duration  of  protection  from  light)  is  justified,  based  on  the  very  short  plasmatic  half-life, 
absence  of  skin  (or  eye)  accumulation,  dosing  for  prostate  cancer  (4mg/kg)  below  the  minimum  dose  that 
tested  positive  in  skin  photosensitization  testing,  ophthalmologic  examination  and  the  absence  of 
photosensitization events in the clinical development. 
It is important that all patients follow the light precautions below for 48 hours post-procedure to minimize the 
risk  of  damage  to  the  skin  and  eyes.  Patients  should  avoid  exposure  to  direct  sunlight  (including  through 
windows)  and  all  bright  light  sources,  both  indoors  and  outdoors.  This  includes  sunbeds,  bright  computer 
monitor  screens  and  medical  examination  lights,  such  as  ophthalmoscopes,  otoscopes  and  endoscopy 
equipment, for 48 hours following the VTP procedure. 
Sunscreen  creams  do  not  protect  against  near  infra-red  light  and,  therefore,  do  not  provide  adequate 
protection.

If  the  patient  reports  discomfort  to  the  skin  or  eyes  during  hospitalisation,  reduce  the  level  of  lighting  and 
take extra care to shield the patient from artificial and natural light. 
During the first 12 hours after VTP procedure, the patient should wear protective goggles and be kept under 
medical surveillance for at least 6 hours in a room with dimmed light. 
The patient may be discharged in the evening of the same day at the physician’s discretion. 
The patient must stay in a dimmed light environment without any direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to 
daylight. The patient may only use incandescent light bulbs with a maximum power of 60 watts or equivalent 
(i.e. 6 watts for LED lights, 12 watts for fluorescent low-energy lights). 
The patient may watch television from a distance of 2 metres and, from 6 hours onwards, may use electronic 
devices such as smartphones, tablets and computers. If the patient must go outdoors during daylight hours, 
he should wear protective clothes and high protection goggles to shield his skin and eyes. 
During  12-48 hours  after  VTP procedure,  the  patient  may  go  outdoors  during  daylight  hours  but  only  in 
shaded  areas  or  when  it  is  overcast.  He  should  wear  dark  clothes  and  take  care  when  exposing  hands  and 
face  to  the  sun.  The  patient  can  return  to  normal  activity  and  tolerate  direct  sunlight  48 hours  after  the 
procedure.  No  patients  with  photosensitive  dermatitis,  skin  conditions  such  as  porphyria  or  a  history  of 
sensitivity  to  sunlight  have  received  Tookad  in  clinical  studies.  However,  the  short  duration  of  action  of 
Tookad means that the risk of enhanced phototoxicity is expected to be low provided these patients strictly 
follow  the  precautions  against  light  exposure.  There  could  be  an  additional  risk  of  eye  photosensitivity  in 
patients  who  have  received  intra-ocular  anti-VEGF  therapy.  Patients  who  have  received  prior  VEGF  therapy 
should take particular care to protect the eyes from light for 48 hours post Tookad injection. Concomitant use 
of systemic VEGF inhibitors is not recommended with Tookad. 
In  studies  of  Tookad  in  age  related  macular  degeneration,  three  cases  of  retinal  artery  occlusion  occurred 
with an increased risk in patients with previous therapy with antiangiogenic agents; these would have been 
administered  inter-ocularly.  With  4  mg/kg  Tookad,  the  photosensitisation  period  is  limited  to  6  hours  post 
dosing and advice is given regarding light exposure is to minimise the risk of ocular toxicity. 
There  is  a  potential  for  interaction  with  other  drugs  that  have  photosensitising  effects.  Medicinal  products 
which  have  potential  photosensitising  effects  (such  as  tetracyclines,  sulphonamides,  quinolones, 
phenothiazines, sulfonylurea hypoglycaemic agents, thiazide diuretics, griseofulvin or amiodarone) should be 
stopped  at  least  10  days  before  the  procedure  with  Tookad  and  for  at  least  3  days  after  the  procedure  or 
replaced  by  other  treatments  without  photosensitizing  properties.  If  it  is  not  possible  to  stop  a 
photosensitising  medicinal  product  (such  as  amiodarone),  the  patient  should  be  advised  that  increased 
sensitivity  to  sunlight  may  occur  and  they  may  need  to  protect  themselves  from  direct  light  exposure  for  a 
longer period (see SmPC section 4.5).

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of padeliporfin for the current application are well characterized, and well 
described in the SmPC. The mode of action of Tookad was supported by literature data. The tumour must be 
accurately located and confirmed as unilateral using high resolution biopsy strategies based on current best 
practice, before treatment with Tookad. The risk of effects outside the prostate, both local and systemic, and 
the potential for drug-drug interactions appears low and adequate recommendations have been included in 
the SmPC. Considering the lack of long-term data, two PAES studies will be conducted to assess long term 
efficacy and safety of Tookad, in particular, evaluating the potential impact on subsequent radical therapy 
(see discussion on clinical efficacy and safety). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Three Phase II trials for prostate cancer were provided in which three doses of Tookad (2, 4 and 6 mg/kg) 
and two 753 nm light doses (200 and 300 Joules/cm of fibre) were tested. Based on the results, the following 
treatment parameters were considered optimal: 4 mg/kg dose of Tookad with a light energy of 200 J/cm and 
a minimum of 1 for the LDI. In addition to the dose and light energy the number of fibres and size of the 
prostate has to be taken into account. These studies are described and discussed under the section on 
pharmacology.  
2.5.2.  Main study 
CLIN 1001 PCM301

6.  Any condition or history of illness or surgery that may pose an additional risk to men undergoing the 
Tookad Soluble VTP procedure such as: 
a.  Medical conditions that preclude a general anaesthetic 
b.  History of active rectal inflammatory bowel disease or other factors which may increase the risk of 
fistula formation 
c.  Hormonal manipulation (excluding 5-ARIs) or androgen supplements in the previous 6 months 
d.  History of urethral stricture disease 
e.  History of acute urinary retention within 6 months of study entry 
f.  Medical conditions that need medication with potential photosensitising effects (e.g. tetracyclines, 
sulphonamides, phenothiazines, sulfonylurea hypoglycaemic agents, thiazide diuretics, griseofulvin 
and amiodarone) if these treatments cannot be stopped or replaced

Treatments 
Tookad soluble VTP:  
Under  general  anaesthetic,  transparent  guidance  needles  were  positioned  in  the  prostate  gland  to  allow 
coverage  of  the  desired  treatment  zone  while  sparing  surrounding  tissues  with  a  margin  of  at  least  5  mm 
between the fibres and the rectal wall, prostate apex and urethra.  
Assessment report  
EMA/644309/2017 
Page 54/146 
  
  
Once the interstitial optical fibres were accurately positioned in the prostate gland to cover the desired 
treatment zone, a single 10-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of 4 mg/kg Tookad was administered. The drug 
was activated in the predetermined treatment zone by local illumination with laser light at 753 nm with a 
fixed power of 150mW/cm over 22 minutes and 15 seconds, corresponding to an energy dose of 200 J/cm. 
In case of unilateral disease, focal treatment of one lobe was to be applied. In case of bilateral disease 
(discovered at entry or during follow-up), bilateral treatment was to be applied, either simultaneously or 
consecutively. Retreatment of lobes found positive for cancer at 12 months follow-up was allowed. 
The subjects were kept under medical surveillance in dimmed light for at least 6 hours post procedure and 
discharged from hospital either the same evening or the following day.  
Active surveillance:  
Active surveillance was conducted in line with existing recommendations (Mottet et al., 2015; American 
Urological Association Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: 2007 Update). 
Active surveillance included deferral of active treatment and periodic monitoring with prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) tests at 3 monthly intervals, physical examinations and annual prostate biopsy. It involved 
serial absolute PSA measurements and ultrasound-guided prostatic biospy at 12 and 24 months.  
Follow-up 
Subjects in both treatment groups were followed for approximately 24 months after randomisation and 
underwent the same efficacy and safety assessments. A TRUS-guided biopsy of 10 to 24 cores was 
performed at Month 12 and Month 24. PSA was measured and digital rectal examination (DRE) was 
performed every 3 months.  
Prior and concomitant therapy 
The following medications were prohibited from 10 days before to 3 days after the procedure: Medications 
with potential photosynthesising effects, Anticoagulants, Compounds that decrease clotting, vasoconstriction 
and platelet aggregation (e.g. aspirin). Prolonged 5-ARI use decreases serum PSA levels; a subject on a 5-
ARI for over 6 months was not to adjust 5-ARI therapy during the study. Enrolment of a subject who had 
started 5-ARI therapy within 6 months was to be discussed with the Medical Monitor before randomisation. 
Thromboembolic prophylaxis was instigated as per local clinical standards. 
Objectives 
The co – primary objectives were: 
A.  To assess the impact of Tookad VTP on the rate of absence of definite cancer using patients on active 
surveillance as a comparison, measured as absence of any histology result definitively positive for 
cancer at 24 months 
B.  To determine the difference in rate of treatment failure associated with observed progression of 
disease from low risk prostate cancer to moderate or higher risk prostate cancer in men who undergo 
Tookad VTP compared to men on active surveillance. 
Secondary objectives were: 
To determine the differences between men who undergo Tookad Soluble VTP and men on active surveillance 
with regard to:

The overall quality of life was recorded for potential utility and descriptive studies. Overall quality of life was 
recorded using the IPSS and IIEF-15 questionnaires administered every 3 months until Month 12 and at 
Month 24 and 7 days post-treatment for subjects administered Tookad. The EQ-5D questionnaire was 
administered at Month 12 and 24. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints were defined as follows: 
•  Co-primary endpoint A: Rate of absence of definitive cancer: Absence of any histology result 
definitively positive for cancer at 24 months 
•  Co-primary endpoint B: Rate of treatment failure associated with observed progression of cancer 
from low to moderate or higher risk over the 24 months of follow-up. Moderate or higher risk is 
defined as the observation of 1 of the following events: 
o  More than 3 cores definitively positive for cancer when considering all histological results 
available during follow-up in the study 
o  Any Gleason primary or secondary pattern of 4 or more 
o  At least 1 cancer core length > 5 mm 
o  PSA > 10 ng/mL in 3 consecutive measures 
o  Any T3 prostate cancer 
o  Metastasis 
o  Prostate cancer-related death 
For both co-primary endpoints, the blinded adjudication of the biopsy results by the Outcomes Review Panel 
(ORP), taking into account the local and centralised pathology evaluations, was the basis for analysis. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were defined as follows: 
• 
Total number of cores positive for cancer: The total number of positive cores observed during follow-
up is calculated, for each biopsy, by adding the number of positive cores observed in each of the right 
and left lobes. 
•  Notification of initiation of any radical therapy (any radical treatment for prostate cancer other than 
the treatment to which the subject was randomised, including surgery, radiotherapy [external beam, 
brachytherapy, focused], high-intensity focused ultrasound, cryotherapy, hormonal therapy for 
cancer, or chemotherapy for cancer)

Proportion of subjects with a severe prostate cancer-related event: cancer extension to T3, 
metastasis, or prostate cancer-related death 
Post-treatment mpMRI was performed 7 days after the Tookad VTP procedure. Patients in both treatment 
groups were followed for approximately 24 months after randomisation and underwent the same efficacy and 
safety assessments. A TRUS-guided biopsy of 10 to 24 cores was performed at Month 12 and Month 24. The 
ORP, an independent and blinded panel of experts, reviewed all reports of TRUS-guided biopsy for all subjects 
(Selection, Month 12, Month 24) and any other pathological report available at any time during the follow-up 
period to determine the number of cores positive for cancer observed in these histological reports and their 
likely location within the prostate per lobe. The Month 12 and Month 24 biopsies were read centrally by an 
independent pathologist, blinded to the treatment assignment and to the local pathologist reading, and all the 
cases for which this reading was discrepant with the local pathologist reading were adjudicated by the ORP 
pathologist. Any additional radical prostate cancer treatments, metastases, evidence of T3 disease, and 
severe prostate cancer-related events were recorded at Month 12 and Month 24. PSA was measured and 
digital rectal examination was performed every 3 months.  
At the end of the study, patients were eligible for entry into a long-term follow-up programme (Study 
PCM301 FU5), in which outcomes are being recorded for a further 5 years. 
Sample size 
The following assumptions were made to calculate the sample size for co-primary-endpoint B: 
• 
• 
• 
The proportion of patients with a failure at 2 years will be 15% in the active surveillance group and 
5% in the Tookad Soluble VTP arm (a hazard ratio of 0.32 in favour of the intervention) 
For the purposes of sample size calculation, the two-sided significance level is taken equal to 0.025 to 
account for the fact that two co-primary endpoints will be tested; however, the analysis of each co-
primary endpoint will be carried out at the 0.05 significance level with a Hochberg procedure to 
control for multiplicity 
The power required for each co-primary endpoint is 80% 
For co-primary endpoint B, with these assumptions, the total sample size required is 400 patients (200 
patients per arm), and at least 40 events (patients with disease progression) need to be observed for the 
final analysis to take place. 
With this number of patients, the comparison of the two randomized groups will have > 99.9% power to 
detect the expected difference for co-primary endpoint A, since the absence of any histology result definitely 
positive for cancer 24 months after the intervention is expected to exceed 70% in the intervention arm vs. at 
most 30% in the control arm (false negative biopsies). Assuming that at least 150 patients will be evaluable 
for the biopsy at 24 months in the intervention arm, the rate of negative biopsies will be estimated with a 
standard error of less than 4%. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were individually randomised to Tookad VTP or Active Surveillance with a 1:1 ratio. Central 
randomisation was performed using an independent web-based allocation system. Randomisation was 
stratified by centre using balanced blocks of variable size.

Blinding (masking) 
This is an open-label study.  
Blinding was applied to outcomes evaluation and statistical treatment. 
Statistical methods 
Analyses were described prospectively in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) dated 21.11.14. All analyses were 
performed using SAS Version 9.3 or higher. All statistical tests were 2-sided and at a 5% level of significance. 
The following analysis populations were defined: 
• 
Intention-To-Treat (ITT): includes all randomised subjects, analysed as randomised. 
•  Modified Intention-To-Treat (mITT): includes all subjects in the ITT population randomised to the 
Tookad Soluble VTP group who received any amount of Tookad Soluble or initiated any study 
treatment-related procedure (including anaesthesia) and all subjects in the ITT population 
randomised to the active surveillance group. Subjects were analysed as randomised. 
• 
Per-protocol (PP): includes all subjects in the ITT population, randomised to either group, who had no 
major protocol violations. The PP population will consist of all subjects who met the following criteria: 
o  Complied with the protocol for inclusion and exclusion criteria and follow-up 
o  Received the appropriate dose of Tookad Soluble and energy delivered and underwent VTP  
o  Had no major protocol deviations. The list of subjects excluded from the PP population was 
identified during the data review meeting and approved before database lock. 
The ITT population was used for all demographic and efficacy endpoints, the mITT and the PP populations 
were used for primary efficacy endpoints. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were analysed as follows: 
•  Co-primary endpoint A was analysed as a dichotomous outcome, i.e. success (absence of any 
histology result definitely positive for cancer) or failure (presence of at least 1 result definitely 
positive for cancer). Subjects who dropped out before Month 3 or before Tookad administration were 
counted as failures. Subjects who dropped out between Months 3 and 24 were asked to undergo a 
biopsy at Month 24. A subject who did not undergo the Month 24 biopsy was counted as a failure. 
Proportions of subjects with observed success were compared between the 2 treatment arms using a 
2-sided Pearson’s chi-square test. The crude odds ratio and the risk ratio at 24 months, comparing 
Tookad versus active surveillance and the associated 95% confidence interval (CI), were presented. 
•  Co-primary endpoint B was analysed using survival analysis methods. The event was progression, 
defined as the first occurrence of an exam meeting the criteria for progression to moderate- or 
higher-risk cancer. Distribution of events occurring over time during follow-up was estimated using 
the Kaplan-Meier method. The estimated progression rates and associated 95% CI were presented at 
Months 6, 12, 18 and 24.  Time to progression was compared between the 2 treatment groups using 
the log-rank test. The crude hazard ratio at 24 months comparing Tookad versus active surveillance 
and the associated 95% CI was presented, using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. 
The Hochberg procedure was used to adjust for multiplicity of the 2 co-primary endpoints. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644309/2017 
Page 58/146 
  
  
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses included parametric estimations of time to progression for the ITT. Adjusted analyses for 
both co-primary endpoints were conducted.  
Multivariate modelling using a logistic regression was applied. The regression model incorporated Baseline 
assessment of age, number of positive cores, prostate volume and disease status (unilateral or bilateral) in 
addition to treatment to provide an adjusted comparison of the 2 treatment groups with respect to probability 
of success/failure for co-primary endpoint A and the HR of progression for co-primary endpoint B. In the Cox 
model analysis, the proportional hazard assumption was checked graphically plotting the log(-log[survival]) 
and was to be relaxed if necessary. 
For co-primary endpoint B, subjects who withdrew from the study or opted for radical treatment before 
prostate cancer progression were censored. A sensitivity analysis, using a Cox proportional hazards model, 
assumed these subjects to be failures (defined as worst-case scenario in the SAP).   
Biopsies were performed according to a predefined visit schedule (interval-censored data). Simplified Kaplan 
Meier curves were constructed by rounding the recorded visit times to the closest 6-monthly visit time point 
to improve visual interpretation. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed as follows: 
The total number of positive cores for both lobes was calculated for each follow-up biopsy and the mean total 
was compared between the 2 treatment groups using a Student t test. The mean maximum cancer core 
length was compared between the 2 treatment groups at Month 12 and Month 24 using a Student t test. In 
addition, the number and percentage of subjects with a maximum cancer core length ≥ 5 mm or < 5 mm at 
Months 12 and 24 were presented by treatment group. 
The time to initiation of radical therapy was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was 
used to compare the time to initiation of radical therapy between the 2 treatment groups. Subjects who did 
not initiate any radical therapy were censored at the time of study completion.  
Descriptive statistics on incidence rates of severe cancer-related events (any T3 prostate cancer, metastasis 
or prostate cancer-related death) were reported. 
For the questionnaires (IPSS, IIEF-15, EQ-5D), descriptive summaries of the raw score and change from 
Baseline at each time point were provided for observed cases and using a multiple imputation method. The 
difference between treatment groups in change from Baseline to Month 24 (imputed) was analysed using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group as the fixed effect and Baseline score as a 
covariate. ANCOVA adjusted mean change from Baseline of scores difference was provided along with 
standard error (SE) and 95% CI within each treatment group.

Exploratory and Additional Efficacy Analysis 
Subjects who met the progression criteria at Month 12 were analysed as failure for the co-primary endpoint B 
in the primary analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed using the status at Month 24 after retreatment 
or treatment of contralateral non-treated lobe to review the outcome of the Tookad Soluble VTP strategy, 
including retreatment. 
Also, both co-primary endpoints were evaluated using only data from assessments performed on the treated 
lobe(s) for the Tookad group and lobe(s) with disease at Baseline for the active surveillance group. A 
subgroup efficacy analysis was performed by disease status at Baseline (unilateral or bilateral).

There were 86 screen failures, most of them because the biopsy did not show low risk prostate cancer or the 
PSA was above 10ng/mL; 11 patients were excluded because their prostate was not in the range 25-70cc. 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted between 8 March 2011 and 25 June 2015. From the 8th March 2011, a total of 413 
men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy with no prior 
treatment for prostate cancer were screened and randomized. 
Fifty-nine hospitals were initiated for this study and 47 centres in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, 
Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom enrolled subjects.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol changes 
The original protocol was version 2.1 (January 2011). Version 2.2 (April 2011) updated study personnel and 
the definition of adverse events.  
Changes (version 3, August 2011; version 4, November 2011 and version 5, June 2012) mainly concerned 
the type and numbers of prostate biopsies required (from 2 sets of 12 core biopsies or a 24 core saturation 
biopsy to one 12 [±2] core biopsy) and the time from biopsy to enrolment in order to simplify the entry 
criteria, accommodate the standard of care in different countries and facilitate recruitment.  
Protocol version 6.0 (23 October 2012) added ‘any surgical intervention for benign prostatic hypertrophy’ as 
an exclusion criterion. The rationale was that altered prostatic anatomy would make the accurate placement 
of the illuminating fibres more difficult and potentially increase the risk of extra -prostatic illumination with 
possible necrosis of the urinary sphincter, the neurovascular bundles or the rectal wall. 
The statistical analysis plan includes 2 changes from the analyses planned in the protocol: 
The safety population was modified to include subjects who initiated any study treatment-related procedure 
(including anaesthesia) in the safety analyses. 
The definition of emergent AEs was modified to start after randomisation. Because subjects in the active 
surveillance group were given no treatment after randomisation while the Tookad Soluble VTP procedure 
might have taken place several weeks after randomisation, this change provided comparable periods of AE 
collection between the 2 treatment groups. 
Protocol violations 
There were 39 major deviations in the VTP and 26 in the active surveillance group. Most major deviations in 
the VTP group were due to not receiving any Tookad or an inappropriate dose/ energy delivered. In addition, 
11 patients with bilateral disease were treated in only 1 lobe. The month 24 biopsy was not performed in 
about 11% of patients, not previously classified as treatment failures.   
There were 114 minor protocol deviations, mainly VTP not being performed according to the guidelines. 
These were stated as minor modifications to the number and length of fibres due to the prostate volume and 
shape.

Four patients had already undergone a prostatectomy (3 in the VTP and 1 in the active surveillance group); 
they were enrolled before this became an exclusion criterion (protocol version 6.0). 
All patients had Gleason score ≤ 3 + 3 at baseline. 
There were 6 patients (2.9%) aged > 75 years in each group.

The 9 subjects in the VTP group excluded from the mITT and safety populations did not receive any Tookad 
or initiate any study treatment-related procedure (including anaesthesia) for the following reasons: withdrew 
consent after randomisation (3), discontinued by the Investigator for non-compliance (1), myocardial 
infarction (1), bladder cancer discovered on pre-treatment MRI (1), history of TURP- exclusion criterion (1), 
previous Gleason 3+4 biopsy - exclusion criterion (1) and unable to undergo pre-treatment MRI due to 
claustrophobia (1).  
One subject had an anaphylactic reaction to the anaesthesia and did not receive any Tookad; he was included 
in the mITT and safety populations but not in the 196 subjects listed as receiving Tookad in the table below.  
The PP population excluded the additional 30 patients in the VTP group (above the 9 subjects who did not 
receive any Tookad or initiate any treatment-related procedure) and the 26 in the active surveillance group 
who had major protocol violations.  
Details of Tookad treatment 
Of the 206 subjects randomised Tookad -VTP, 10 did not receive treatment for various reasons including 
study withdrawal, meeting exclusion criteria, non-compliance and other medical events.

a The second procedure for Subject 25039-27 was incorrectly recorded in the eCRF as retreatment when it was a 
contralateral treatment. The results in this table include this procedure as contralateral treatment. 
The 33 subjects with bilateral disease who received sequential treatment before 12 months had a mean 
interval of 7.9 months (range 5.8 – 12.4 months) between procedures.

Severe Prostate-Cancer Related Events 
Few subjects experienced a severe prostate cancer-related event (T3 prostate cancer, metastasis or prostate 
cancer-related death), but only 1 of the subjects who did have such an event (both T3 prostate cancer and 
metastasis) was in the Tookad Soluble VTP group. At month 24, 11 active surveillance subjects had T3 
prostate cancer and 1 had metastases. 
Percentage necrosis on Day 7 MRI for Tookad patients 
For the first treatment (N=196) mean necrosis was 88.15% (SD 23.99; range 32.2, 161.0). For contralateral 
treatment (N=62) mean necrosis was 99.76% (SD 32.59; range 18.8, 199.6) and for retreatment (N=11) 
mean necrosis was 45.86% (SD 18.55, range 10.2, 71.3). Values over 100% represent extension of necrosis 
to the other lobe. The higher percentage at contralateral treatment reflects the reduction in prostate volume 
achieved by the first treatment, and the lower percentage at retreatment reflects the difficulty of 
measurement in the retreated lobe. 
The proportion of subjects with extraprostatic necrosis was similar with first and contralateral treatment 
[147/191 (77%) and 46/62 (74.2%)] respectively and lower at retreatment [5/11 (45.5%)]. Extraprostatic 
necrosis was of small volume and of no clinical consequence.

International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) 
Subject-reported outcomes showed no statistically significant difference between the Tookad Soluble VTP and 
the active surveillance group other than a short-term impact on urinary function at Day 7 with Tookad.  
The results showed, 7 days after the VTP procedure, on a 35-point scale in comparison to baseline values, a 
mean increase of 7.2 points (from 7.6 to 14.8) in the ITT population and 7.5 points (from 6.7 to 14.2) in 
patients meeting the indication criteria. Those results were improved at Month 3 (9.6 in the ITT population 
and 8.7 in patients meeting the indication criteria) and back to baseline values at Month 6 (7.5 in the ITT 
population and 6.4 in patients meeting the indication criteria), with further improvement until Month 24 (6.6 
in the ITT population and 5.5 in patients meeting the indication criteria). In the Active Surveillance arm, the 
IPSS score slightly worsened over time until Month 24.

Co-Primary endpoint A: 
The results in the PP population were consistent with the results in the mITT population for Co-primary 
endpoint A at month 24 and month 12.  
Sensitivity analysis (logistic regression) showed no effect of age, number of positive cores, prostate volume 
and baseline disease status (unilateral/ bilateral) on the outcome (risk ratio in ITT population at 24 months = 
3.67 [2.53, 5.33]).

This estimate is based on more points but uses a different outcome (RT rather than progression). The median 
time to RT is not reached at M48 in the Tookad VTP group, while it is reached at 36.9 months in the Active 
Surveillance arm.

Treatment post-progression 
Details of patients who progressed and treatments received were provided.  
Of 58 patients that progressed in the Tookad VTP arm, only 11 underwent radical therapy (5.3%), 18 
patients underwent a second VTP procedure and 29 had not received other treatment at the end of the study. 
Of 121 patients that progressed in the AS arm, 54 underwent radical therapy (26.1%) and 67 had not 
received any active treatment at the end of the study. Of 121 patients that progressed in the AS arm, 54 
underwent radical therapy and 67 had not received any active treatment at the end of the study. Patients in 
the AS arm were not offered subsequent VTP. In assessing overall tolerability by Month 24, post enrolment 
patients who underwent a radical therapy were also counted in the scoring of prostate symptoms and erectile 
function.

The reasons  for absence of active treatment in patients who progressed (within 24 months)  were provided. 
The patients who progressed in Study PCM 301 and were not treated were separated into broad categories by 
the  applicant.  This  included  patients  who  reached  the  trial  endpoint  of  progression  but  were  considered  by 
the Investigator not to have progressed sufficiently to warrant treatment (Category b).

Post-hoc analysis without patients ineligible to receive radical treatment 
Patients  ineligible  to  receive  radical  treatment  were  not  counted.  A  proxy  for  excluding  patients  from  this 
analysis was used: ‘watchful waiting’ (WW) criteria. Usual WW criteria include: life expectancy <10 years and 
contraindication to radical treatment. 
A total of 5 patients were identified who may meet the WW exclusion criteria at any time during the study.  
These patients have been removed from the ITT population in a sensitivity analysis of the benefit. This had 
virtually  no observable effect on  results.  Therefore, the  results  above  and  below  used the  ITT  population  of 
the study.  
The applicant also provided a post-hoc analysis using an adjusted composite endpoint that includes only the 
most clinically significant components monitored during the PCM301 study: 
•  Observation of any Gleason pattern 4 or more (i.e. Gleason Score 7 or more) 
•  Or any T3 stage prostate cancer 
•  Or any metastasis 
•  Or prostate cancer-related death 
•  Or undergoing radical therapy in absence of progression along one of the criteria above

Study Title: “Study of the Efficacy, Safety and Quality of Life after Tookad Vascular Targeted Photodynamic 
therapy (VTP) for Minimally Invasive Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer”. 
This is a completed, multi-centre, confirmatory Phase 3, open label trial conducted in three Latin American 
countries (Mexico, Peru and Panama).  
Primary objective: confirm that a significant proportion of patients will be prostate cancer-free on the 
Month 12 biopsy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a negative prostate 
biopsy at Month 12. 
Of the 81 patients enrolled in this study, three were anesthetised but did not receive the first VTP procedure 
because they were found to have had a previous trans-urethral resection (TURP) of the prostate. A total of 78 
patients were treated with 4 mg/kg Tookad and 200 J/cm laser light. 76 received the first VTP procedure 
according to protocol, and in two cases power cuts during the procedure resulted in delays of approximately 
10 minutes between WST11 injection and laser illumination. Seventeen patients, who had bilateral disease at 
baseline, underwent a second VTP procedure in order to treat contralateral disease before Month 6 (and in 
one case after Month 6). 
Eight patients who had a positive Month 6 biopsy received an additional treatment (three patients in the 
previously treated lobe and one patient in the contralateral lobe and four patients had retreatment in a 
previously treated lobe as well as treatment to previously untreated contralateral lobes. 
Prostate biopsies were made between 321 days and 479 days after the inclusion visit, with a median of 375 
days. 
Among the 71 patients who had Month 12 biopsies results available, 60 (84.5%) patients had a negative 
biopsy and 11 (15.5%) patients had a positive biopsy; among the latter patients, nine had a positive biopsy

in the treated lobe, and two in the contralateral, untreated lobe. The percentage of negative biopsies was 
consequently 74.1% (60/81) in the ITT population (95% CI: [63.1%; 83.2%]). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The submission is based on a randomized phase III trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Tookad VPT for 
Localised Prostate Cancer versus active surveillance in localised prostate cancer (PCM 301) compared to 
Active Surveillance. 
The design of the single pivotal Phase 3 study in support of the Tookad application is generally in accordance 
with the key points of Appendix 4 to the Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Products in man 
(EMA/CHMP/703715/2012 Rev.1) and the scientific advice received.  The duration of follow-up of 2 years and 
the proposed extended study (Study CLIN1001 PCM301 FU5) was accepted although the CHMP commented 
that prolonged follow-up of these patients to assess clinical outcome, in particular overall survival, should be 
implemented.  
In  the  active  surveillance  arm,  the  recruited  population  underwent  active  surveillance  once  the  study 
commenced.  Baseline  PSA  values  were  provided  but  no  description  of  PSA  velocity.  The  mean  time  from 
diagnosis was about 6 months and standard deviation indicated that most patients were diagnosed within the 
previous  12  –  14  months  but  some  patients  were  diagnosed  over  4  years  prior  to  trial  entry.  Hence,  there 
appeared  to  be  population  heterogeneity,  from  relatively  newly  diagnosed  patients  where  the  PSA  velocity 
and appropriateness of active surveillance was still being established, to patients in whom low risk prostate 
cancer  has  been  stably  present  over  a  number  of  years.  It  was  shown  that  delay  between  diagnosis  and 
randomization dates was evenly distributed across the two arms and that the treatment difference between 
arms was maintained when counting progression from diagnosis instead of from randomization. A re-analysis 
of the progression co-primary endpoint B was performed on the subpopulation of patients with more than 6 
months from diagnosis vs. patients with less than 6 months from diagnosis. The reduction of progression in 
the  Tookad  VTP  vs.  AS  was  significant  in  both  groups  tested.  The  difference  was  not  statistically  significant 
between these groups.  
Active surveillance is offered to men with low risk prostate cancer for whom radical prostatectomy or radical 
radiotherapy  is  suitable.  The  protocol  stipulated  a  life  expectancy  of  10  years  but  this  was  left  to  the 
discretion of the investigators and patients up to the age of 85 years were included. The mean age and the 
median  age of  the  patients  in  the  trial  were  relatively  low  considering  the  diagnosis  of  prostate  cancer,  but 
might represent a PSA testing bias, as early prostate cancer is usually suspected from PSA and presents itself 
without symptoms. Results in patients less than 75 years of age were similar to the full study population for 
both co-primary endpoints.  
Progression  free  survival  in  low  risk  prostate  cancer  is  expected  to  be  long.  Therefore  the  applicant  used 
surrogate markers in the clinical assessment of efficacy, namely MRI findings, biopsy results and PSA in all of 
the clinical studies which is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644309/2017 
Page 89/146 
  
  
There were 39 major deviations in the VTP and 26 in the active surveillance group. It is inevitable in an open 
label  study  that  there  will  be  more  protocol  deviations  in  the  group  receiving  treatment.  11  patients  with 
bilateral disease were treated in only 1 lobe. This was justified by the applicant as being consistent with the 
intention  of  focal  treatment  by  treating  the  lobe  with  the  highest  tumour  burden.  Retreatment  of  the  same 
lobe or sequential treatment of the contralateral lobe of the prostate are not recommended (see sections 4.2 
and  4.4).  The  decision  to  modify  the  treatment  administered  illustrates  the  importance  of  operator 
experience in treatment planning.  
Attempts were made to make the treatment implementation and outcome evaluation uniform and robust. The 
CTGC compared the MRI and the final ultrasound based treatment plans for the first cases at each centre (as 
needed)  and  verified  post-hoc  10%  of  randomly  selected  cases  to  ensure  consistency.  An  independent, 
blinded  Outcomes  Review  Panel  (ORP)  of  experts  (urologist,  pathologist  and  statistician)  reviewed  the 
pathology  reports.  The  Month  12  and  24  biopsies  were  read  by  one  central  uro-pathologist,  blinded  to  the 
treatment assignment and to the local pathologist reading, and all discrepant cases were adjudicated by the 
ORP  pathologist.  Although  blinded,  it  is  presumed  that  it  would  be  possible  to  determine  on  analysis  of  the 
prostate biopsies who has received VTP.  
Baseline characteristics of the two arms are well balanced and comply with the inclusion criteria. 11 patients 
were excluded because their prostate was not in the range 25-70cc.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Tookad  produced  a  statistically  significant improvement  in  a  patient’s  probability  of  a  negative biopsy  at  24 
months  after  treatment  (49%  vs.  13.5%,  RR=3.62)  (Co-Primary  endpoint  A).  Results  were  similar  in  the 
mITT and PP populations. A total of 124 patients (30%) lacked a month 24 biopsy. This was mainly driven by 
patients  undergoing  radical  therapy  particularly  in  the  active  surveillance  arm.  The  number  for  whom  a 
biopsy  was  expected  but  not  performed  was  equivalent  in  the  2  groups  (n=26,  12.6%).  In  all  analyses, 
subjects  with  missing  biopsies  were  considered  failures.  This  is  an  appropriate  assumption  but  favours  the 
Tookad arm; 41.5% of biopsies were missing at Month 24 in the active surveillance arm. 
Sensitivity analysis (logistic regression) showed no effect of age, number of positive cores, prostate volume 
and baseline disease status (unilateral/ bilateral) on the outcome (risk ratio in ITT population at 24 months = 
3.67  [2.53,  5.33]).  Results  were  similar  on  subgroup  analysis  of  unilateral  (RR  3.48  [2.30,  5.24])  and 
bilateral  (4.31  [1.80,  10.32])  disease;  in  both  groups  49%  of  VTP  patients  had  no  histological  evidence  of 
cancer on 24 month biopsy.  
Co-primary  endpoint  A  looked  at  biopsy  results  in  both  lobes,  regardless  of  disease  status  at  baseline  and 
whether  the  lobe  was  treated.  The  additional  analysis  looking  at  results  in  the  treated  lobe  was  more 
reassuring with regards to the proportion of patients with negative biopsies at 24 months (62.6%) vs 19.3% 
in the Tookad and AS arm respectively. Results showed the known lack of sensitivity of TRUS-guided biopsy 
(28/ 207, 13.5% subjects on active surveillance had a negative biopsy at Month 24). Biopsies cannot sample 
the  whole  area  and  will  not obtain  tissue  near the capsule,  the likely  site of residual disease  post  Tookad  – 
VTP. 
A post-hoc sensitivity analysis that assumed missing biopsies due to radical therapy to be negative, still 
favoured Tookad, although the effect size was smaller (54.9% vs. 40.1%, RR 1.37 [1.11, 1.68] p=0.003). 
The month 24 biopsy was not performed in about 11% of patients, not previously classified as treatment 
failures. However, sufficient data were available for subjects in the VTP group to calculate the failure rate.

At 12 months 45.6% of ITT patients in the Tookad group had a positive biopsy, half of which were due to as 
yet untreated known disease at baseline. Separate algorithms and cut-offs of PSA elevation are used post 
prostatectomy and post radical radiotherapy to indicate a need to further therapy. Neither of these applies 
post Tookad VTP when a prostate lobe remains unaffected by treatment. Separately there is established 
guidance on active surveillance follow-up. Therefore, a follow-up regimen was proposed after Tookad VTP, 
based on the protocols for the PCM301 study and its follow-up study, along with common AS follow-up 
strategies. Following Tookad VTP, patients should undergo digital rectal examination (DRE) and have their 
serum PSA monitored, including an assessment of PSA dynamics (PSA doubling time and PSA velocity). PSA 
should be tested every 3 months for first 2 years post VTP and every 6-month thereafter in order to assess 
PSA dynamics (PSA Doubling Time (DT), PSA velocity). Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) is recommended to 
be performed at least once a year and more often if clinically justified. Routine biopsy is recommended at 2-4 
years and 7 years post VTP, with additional biopsies based on clinical/ PSA assessment. mpMRI may be used 
to improve the decision making but not, at present, to replace biopsy.  
In case of positive biopsies, patients who exceed the threshold for low risk disease (i.e. have GS >6, >3 
positive cores or any single core length >5mm) should receive a treatment recommendation for radical 
therapy. 
There is insufficient evidence to advocate a second VTP at present as an alternative to AS or radical therapy. 
The follow-up strategy is acceptable.    
With  regards  to  Co-primary  endpoint  B,  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  progressed  over  24  months  in  the 
Tookad group was lower than in the active surveillance group (28.2% vs. 58.5%; HR=0.34 [0.25; 0.47]). No 
significant  effect  of  covariates  [baseline  age,  number  of  cores  positive,  prostate  volume  and  disease  status 
(unilateral/bilateral)] was observed; crude and adjusted HRs was similar. Looking at the individual criteria for 
progression, each parameter was reduced by Tookad.  
The  results  appeared  robust  to  different  analyses  (mITT  and  PP  populations),  baseline  disease  status  (uni/ 
bilateral) and the sensitivity analysis that assumed that all patients who withdrew or opted for radical therapy 
were  treatment  failures  (progression  35.9%  vs  69.1%;  HR  =  0.38  [0.28,  0.50]).  The  Median  time  to 
progression  was  twice  as  long  in  the  Tookad  as  the  active  surveillance  group  (28.3  vs.  14.1  months, 
p<0.001). The 95% CIs (26.0, 30.6) were fairly tight in the Tookad group, suggesting a consistent 2 – 2 ½ 
years until progression. The largest proportion of patients on active surveillance that progressed did so in the 
first 12 months. Baseline biopsies were taken at different time points up to 12 months from study inclusion 
and  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  presented  for  both  arms  of  time  to  progression  from  prostate  biopsy  rather 
than randomisation. The estimated time to progression was longer in both arms by approximately 3 months 
when taken from the biopsy date (AS vs. VTP 17 vs 32 months) rather than the date of randomisation (14.1 
vs. 28.3 months).   
When  progression  in  the  treated  lobe  only  was  assessed,  the  number  with  progression  in  both  groups 
decreased,  but  this  was  more  marked  in  the  VTP  group.  The  median  time  to  progression  increased  in  the 
active surveillance arm from 14.1 to 23.8 months. 
The duration of biopsy follow-up in the trial was insufficient to accurately determine TTP. It is also noted that 
this  is  histological  rather  than  biochemical  progression  as  reported  for  other  treatment  modalities  and  the 
correlation between these two measures is unclear.

When  using  the  48-month  follow-up  information  from  the  extension  study  for  the  right  censorship,  the 
median-time  to  progression  is  not  reached  at  30  months  in  the  Tookad  arm  vs  36.9  months  (data  not 
shown).  The  applicant  estimated  time  to  progression  using  parametric  survival  analysis,  which  gave  an 
estimate  in  the  region  where  there  is  no  data.  The  PSA  cut  off  >10  is  less  informative  in  the  VTP  arm  as 
patients started with a lower absolute PSA post Tookad (3 patients in the VTP vs 14 in the AS arm progressed 
on  the  PSA  endpoint).  Overall,  there  was  no  reliable  way  to  detect  progression  and  the  need  for  radical 
therapy  in  the  Tookad  arm  after  2  years.  The  numbers  of  patients  undergoing  active/  radical  therapy  is 
similar in both arms from 24 months onwards, but the results are dominated by the excess of radical therapy 
in the AS arm during the first 2 years. Therefore, the delay to progression analyses as well as the risk of/time 
to receiving radical therapy analysis should be considered with caution.  
Absence of disease progression at M15 and M27 in the target population was also reported. The proportions 
of  patients  with  no  disease  progression  in  the  initially  treated  lobe  were  substantially  higher  in  the  Tookad 
than in Active Surveillance arm, with 95% vs. 55% of patients without ipsilateral disease progression at M15 
respectively  and  90%  vs.  42%  at  M27.  Hence,  the  difference  between  the  two  arms  at  M15  was  40%  and 
increased  to  48%  at  M27.  When  considering  the  whole  gland,  the  proportions  for  absence  of  progression 
were lower with 73% and 36% at M15 for Tookad and Active Surveillance respectively and 64% and 25% at 
M27.  The  difference  between  the  two  arms  at  M15  was  37%,  which  is  comparable  to  the  one  observed  for 
ipsilateral progression only. The difference increased minimally at M27 (39%) and was somewhat lower than 
the  one  observed  for  ipsilateral  progression  only.  Overall,  this  analysis  confirms  the  significant  reduction  in 
progression of disease and need for radical therapy, which had been reported previously based on the review 
of hazard ratios in Kaplan-Meier analyses. 
Medium  and  long  term  outcomes  following  subsequent  radical  therapy  (surgery  or  radiotherapy)  have  not 
been  followed  up,  specifically  any  impact  of  prior  Tookad  VTP  on  oncological  parameters  post-surgery  (T 
stage,  Gleason  score,  positive  margins),  undesirable  genitourinary  effects,  radiotherapy  toxicity  and 
ultimately survival (see also discussion on clinical pharmacology and clinical safety). To compensate for the 
relatively  short  follow-up  for  progression,  patients  can  enter  into  a  long-term  follow-up  programme  for  a 
further  5  years  (Study  CLIN1001  PCM301  FU5).  In  this  extension  study,  follow-up  will  be  done  through 
periodical data collection that will inform the evolution of the prostate cancer, complications and treatments 
as  well  as  quality  of  life.  This  will  also  include  an  in-depth  biopsy  study  to  measure  cancer  progression  in 
patients who were enrolled (see Annex II and RMP) and is expected to provide reliable data on progression 
after 24 month. 
Together with the PAES CLIN1501 PCM401 (see discussion on clinical pharmacology), the long term follow up 
of study PCM301 will provide relevant long term efficacy data on Tookad and is therefore included as a 
condition in Annex II of the opinion. The protocol for PAES CLIN1501 PCM401 and the SAP of the follow-up 
study PCM301 FU5 (PAES) will discriminate the use of other prostate cancer therapy as radical treatment 
(radical prostatectomy, prostatic radiotherapy, low dose rate brachytherapy, high dose rate brachytherapy); 
other active treatment (cryotherapy, ultrasound therapy, further VTP); palliative therapy (hormonal therapy, 
chemotherapy, palliative radiotherapy (location -pelvis, bone, other), TURP, other non
radical therapy). 
Updates on the status of recruitment are expected to be given by the applicant post-authorisation.

Criteria for retreatment of the same lobe were not presented but were presumed to be the same as for initial 
treatment. It is not known how many patients were considered eligible for or were offered retreatment. Very 
few patients actually underwent retreatment. The percentage necrosis was higher with initial (88.15%) and 
contralateral (99.76%) treatment than retreatment (45.86%). This was attributed to difficulty of 
measurement in the retreated lobe. Extraprostatic necrosis was less at retreatment (45.5%) vs. 77% and 
74.2%, suggesting an element of investigator concern regarding dose.  
Overall,  insufficient  patients  underwent  retreatment  of  the  ipsilateral  lobe  or  sequential  treatment  of  the 
contralateral lobe to determine the efficacy and safety of a second Tookad VTP procedure (see SmPC section 
4.4).  Furthermore, simultaneous treatment of both prostate lobes was associated with an inferior outcome in 
clinical  trials  and  should  not  be  performed  (data  not  shown).  Therefore,  retreatment  of  the  same  lobe  or 
sequential  treatment  of  the  contralateral  lobe  of  the  prostate  are  not  recommended  (see  sections  4.2  and 
4.4). 
With regards to the secondary endpoints, Tookad Soluble VTP clinically and statistically (p < 0.001) 
significantly increased the time to initiation of radical therapy; 12 (5.8%) subjects in the Tookad VTP group 
underwent radical therapy compared to 60 (29.0%) in the active surveillance group within the 2 years of the 
study. In the Tookad VTP group 1 subject and in the active surveillance group 8 subjects underwent radical 
therapy without meeting the co – primary endpoint B definition for progression.  
Only 60/121 active surveillance and 12/58 Tookad patients who progressed underwent radical therapy. The 
absence of active treatment (radical therapy or 2nd VTP) after progression in both arms is high compared to 
published series e.g. in the PRIAS study (Bul 2013) of active surveillance for low risk prostate cancer in 2494 
men, 93.3% (387/415) patients that experienced protocol defined progression underwent treatment, either 
prostatectomy or radiotherapy. The reasons for absence of active treatment after progression (within 24 
months) were provided (see table 48). The patients who progressed in Study PCM 301 and were not treated 
were separated into broad categories by the applicant. This included patients who reached the trial endpoint 
of progression but were considered by the investigator not to have progressed sufficiently to warrant 
treatment (Category b). Interestingly this appears to be in favour of the VTP arm; 24% in the VTP vs. 44% of 
patients in the AS arm were deemed to have progressed (and therefore contributed to Co-primary endpoint 
B) but progression was too limited to warrant treatment. However, the numbers involved are too small to 
draw any conclusions.  
Five patients that were clearly ineligible for active surveillance/ radical therapy were highlighted. In order to 
confirm patient eligibility to RT, the Applicant reviewed the medical history of all patients. All remaining 408 
patients were eligible for radical therapy on reported clinical grounds. Of note, among these, 10 patients were 
over 75 years old (5 patients in each arm). The Life expectancy at 75 is 10 years on average in the European 
countries where the study was conducted. However, its assessment remains patient specific if there is no age 
limit set in advance. A sensitivity analyses was done considering a worst case scenario, excluding the 5 
patients with disputable RT eligibility and the 10 patients aged >75 years. This had also no meaningful 
impact on efficacy and benefit results (data not shown).

The  post-Baseline  mean  PSA  values  in  the  Tookad  group  were  lower  than  the  mean  values  at  the 
corresponding time points in the active surveillance group and the Tookad D baseline value. The main point 
of the PSA assay in the Phase III trial was to verify that the PSA levels at the different time points according 
to the  procedure  remained  below the  baseline  PSA  levels.  Variability in  PSA  can  be  difficult to evaluate  and 
correlate  with  disease  progression,  especially  as  there  is  normal  prostate  tissue  remaining.  Although  there 
are  doubts  regarding  the  use  of  PSA  threshold  >10,  that  could  be  biased  towards  Tookad  as  patients  who 
underwent VTP were starting with a lower absolute PSA level, within the 24 months of study PCM301 just 4 
patients  (3.3%)  in  the  AR  arm  and  1  patient  (1.7%)  in  the  Tookad  arm  had  PSA  progression  alone  as 
criterion for progression. 
Co-primary endpoint A and B were presented by PSA density (presumed to be baseline PSA density) (data 
not shown). Individuals with a higher PSA density (>0.2) appeared to derive less benefit in terms of time to 
progression (co-primary endpoint B) than those with a lower PSA density regardless of treatment group. PSA 
density did not influence the chance of a negative biopsy. Furthermore, the proportion of patients that 
achieved co-primary endpoint A (absence of positive biopsy) in the VTP compared to the AS arm at 12 and 24 
months did not appear related to PSA velocity. Co-primary endpoint B was not presented by PSA velocity.  
QoL data (EQ5D) was presented for Baseline and Month 24 only. IPSS scores in the Tookad group increased 
at Month 3 but were equal or less than baseline from month 6 onwards. The mean IPSS score in the active 
surveillance group increased marginally over the study period and were higher than in the Tookad group at 
Month 24.  The mean IPPS showed a marked increase in the VTP arm at day 7 post VTP procedure; it nearly 
doubled from 7.6 to 14.8 on a 35 point scale. IPSS then improved and returned to baseline by Month 6. IIEF-
15 scores showed moderate worsening in erectile function up to 3 months after the procedure, but the result 
at  Month  24  was  comparable  in  the  2  groups.  Erectile  dysfunction  deteriorated  at  Day  7  and,  although  it 
improved after this time point, it never regained baseline levels. The SmPC adequately reflects that erectile 
dysfunction  may  occur  even  if  radical  prostatectomy  is  avoided.  Some  degree  of  erectile  dysfunction  is 
possible soon after the procedure and may last for more than 6 months (see section 4.8). 
The applicant presented the various facets of the patient reported outcomes for the active surveillance arm 
split by whether the patient remained on active surveillance or underwent radical therapy (data not shown). 
There was no difference in quality of life (QoL) reflected by the EQ5D between those that underwent radical 
treatment (RP) and those that remained on active surveillance. This is in line with QoL at Month 24 that was 
not influenced by Tookad treatment. However, the applicant states that the QoL criteria evaluated by the 
EQ5D questionnaire are not known to be impacted by radical treatment for prostate cancer. Therefore, it is 
not clear why the questionnaire was originally chosen for use in the study. With regards to the IPSS score 
those that underwent RP had consistently better scores than those that did not. This could be due to chance 
or the fact that patients with better scores were selected for radical therapy. It is difficult to compare these 
scores with the scores post Tookad VTP as most radical therapy was undertaken after 12 months so the only 
follow up available was at 24 months. However, by this time point any decline in IPSS had resolved; there 
was no difference between patients that underwent radical therapy, persisted with active surveillance or 
underwent Tookad VTP. Erectile function score was similar between the AS alone and RP groups up to 12 
months. After this time point most radical therapy occurred. At 24 months erectile function was similar in the 
AS alone group to baseline. This is important as it suggests that there is no ‘natural’ decline in erectile 
function in those that don’t undergo radical therapy. This was not evident from the full AS population. There 
was a marked decline from 12 to 24 months in those that underwent RP. The mean score at 24 months for 
erectile function in those that underwent RP was 12.1, a decrease from Baseline of -9.3. It is difficult to 
compare this to the score post VTP, although the 12 month score post VTP (mean 15.1) may be the most 
relevant.

Further to the SAG oncology consultation (see below) which suggested that Tookad VTP could be a useful 
procedure for higher risk patients (in this low risk group) who prefer deferring radical therapy and potentially 
avoiding it altogether, the applicant proposed a revised indication in patients with a life expectancy≥ 10 years 
and who meet the following criteria: previously untreated, unilateral, low-risk, adenocarcinoma of the 
prostate with: Clinical stage T1c or T2a; Gleason Score ≤ 6, based on high-resolution biopsy strategies; 
PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL; 3 positive cancer cores with a maximum cancer core length of 5 mm in any one core or 1 -
2 positive cancer cores with ≥ 50 % cancer involvement in any one core or a PSA density ≥ 0.15 ng/mL/cm3. 
The population targeted by the indication represents 38% of the overall trial population with a good balance 
of the Tookad arm (80 patients, 39% of overall trial population) and the Active Surveillance arm (78 patients, 
38% of overall trial population). Overall, the differences highlighted in the targeted population in comparison 
to the overall trial population are consistent with the exclusion of a very low risk population.  
Co-primary  endpoint  A  (rate  of  absence  of  definite  cancer  i.e.  absence  of  positive  histology)  favoured  the 
Tookad  arm.  Tookad  produced  statistically  significant  improvement  in the  patients’  probability  of  a  negative 
biopsy  result  at  24  months  after  treatment.  In  the  targeted  population,  65.0%  of  subjects  in  the  Tookad 
group had a negative biopsy in the lobe diagnosed at baseline compared to 14.1% of subjects in the Active 
Surveillance  group.  Hence  subjects  in  the  Tookad  group  were  4.61  times  more  likely  to  have  a  negative 
biopsy  in  the  lobe  diagnosed  at  baseline  compared  to  subjects  in  the  Active  Surveillance  group.  The 
difference  between  the  two  treatment  groups  is  greater  in  the  targeted  population  than  the  overall  trial 
population, where this figure was 3.24.  
Based  on  the  sensitivity  analysis  where  the  22  patients  who  received  a  2nd  VTP  have  been  censored,  the 
impact  of  the  2nd  VTP  on  the  results  of  co-primary  endpoint  appears  to  be  moderate,  especially  when 
focusing on the initially diagnosed lobe. 
Co-primary  endpoint  B  (difference  in  rate  of  treatment  failure  associated  with  observed  progression  of 
disease from low risk prostate cancer to moderate or higher risk prostate cancer) favoured the Tookad arm.  
Overall, the analyses showed that trial results were better for the key endpoints used for the comparison of 
Tookad vs. Active Surveillance. 
Based on data available to date, the restricted use of Tookad in the target indication sub-population 
(unilateral low-risk, excluding very low-risk disease), with limitation to a single procedure enables to 
maximize the positive benefits of the treatment, while minimizing the risk of compromising salvage radical 
therapy. Although still preliminary and somewhat uncertain, the longer-term data available to date points to 
maintenance of the benefits with no signal of increased risk. To further investigate long-term efficacy of 
Tookad and its impact on disease progression including potential impact on the efficacy of subsequent radical 
therapy in patients with low risk prostate cancer as well as further characterise the long term safety of 
Tookad, the results of two PAES, study CLIN1001 PCM301 FU5 and study CLIN1501 PCM401, will be provided 
post-authorisation (see Annex II).

Additional expert consultation 
The SAG Oncology was asked to provide their view on the following issues: 
Tookad VTP is claimed to primarily defer rather than avoid the need for radical therapy (median time to 
progression, defined largely by criteria for radical therapy, 28.3 months). The main adverse effects of Tookad 
VTP are genito-urinary and are comparable to those following radical therapy, however at lower incidences. 
Does the SAG consider that Tookad VTP offers benefit to patients in terms of reduction in the severity and/ or 
duration of acute and chronic toxicity compared to: (1) active surveillance followed by radical therapy? (2) 
‘up-front’ radical therapy? 
Direct comparisons between active surveillance, radical therapy or Tookad VTP are not available and it is 
difficult to speculate on the merit of different strategies in terms of long terms outcomes. More generally, the 
usefulness of focal therapy compared to other options in terms of long-term outcomes is currently unknown. 
Delaying radical therapy is considered of clinical importance for some patients as radical therapy is associated 
with a decrease in HRQoL for some patients, although the (short-lived) side-effects of focal therapy should be 
taken into account. However, even more clinically important would be avoiding radical therapy, an attractive 
potential of focal therapy. Currently, it is not possible to assess to what extent focal therapy is able to 
eradicate (long term, e.g., 10 years or longer) the disease, due to short follow-up and limited evaluation of 
the effect of therapy. Until such effect is demonstrated the uncertainty about potential detrimental effects in 
the long term plays a key role. 
The SAG had divergent views about the overall benefits and risks of Tookad VTP. According to the prevalent 
view, Tookad VTP therapy was associated with short-term benefits some (deferring the need for radical 
therapy by median difference of about 14 months compared to active surveillance), short-term risks, and in 
the short term there seemed to be a positive benefit-risk balance. However, in the context of low-risk 
prostate cancer, with active surveillance being a valid management option and the existence of effective 
treatments in case of progression, it is the long-term benefits (and risks), which bear more weight in the 
overall benefit-risk assessment. Prostate cancer can be a multifocal disease but the study presented did not 
use current optimal imaging and biopsy strategies. Furthermore, the follow-up of available studies with 
Tookad VTP is of insufficient duration to understand the long-term effects given the complex and 
heterogeneous prostate cancer biology requiring 10 or more years of follow-up. Without this information, it is 
impossible to make informed treatment decisions. Based on the available data, it is not yet known, whether it 
is possible to avoid radical therapy for ever at least in a part of the patients. Possible risks identified with 
Tookad VTP include the risk of hampering the efficacy and safety subsequent radical treatments. 
Unfortunately, there was no complete collection of the safety data post salvage RT in the study, the safety 
data were reported using imputation from other studies. The data provided about prostatectomy were in a 
limited number of patients. Likewise, data on intention to treat that included the impact of radical treatment 
were not available. To address the potential long-term outcome risks, it is necessary to study long-term 
(e.g., 10-year or longer, since very few events are expected before that time) distant metastasis free survival 
or need for systemic therapy, in a study with adequate sample size to detect clinically relevant differences.  
This is in line with the requirement of EMA guidelines that in the case of intermediate endpoints (e.g., PFS), 
request some assurance that long-term outcomes are not jeopardised, as well as EMA scientific advice for 
Tookad VTP (“Continued follow-up of these patients to assess clinical outcome, in particular overall survival, 
should be implemented, even if such data are immature at the time of an initial submission”). Unfortunately, 
no data are currently available to assess the long-term outcomes in the two groups. For a majority of SAG 
members, this risk was considered unjustified, in the absence of efficacy data showing at least non-inferiority 
Assessment report  
EMA/644309/2017

of the approach in terms of long-term outcome. Given the existence of highly effective alternative therapy 
(radical therapy) and the fact that the disease is not rare, a risk of compromising long-term outcome was not 
considered justified. The existence of a small study assessing the feasibility of radical surgery following focal 
therapy was not sufficiently reassuring in this respect (Lebdai et al.). 
However, according to some SAG members, like other focal therapies that are currently in use (e.g., 
cryotherapy), Tookad VTP could be a useful procedure for low risk patients wishing to defer radical therapy 
being fully informed about potential risks and uncertainties. Tookad VTP also avoids the need for short-term 
or rather early radical therapy in more than half of the patients at 2 years. There is also a potential that a still 
undefined number of patients will forever avoid radical therapy and its well documented early and late 
adverse effects. The long-term results are not yet available; however, there are enough long-term data of 
other focal therapies like cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), showing that a majority 
of patients can be cured if properly selected. When it comes to genito-urinary toxicity, the adverse effect of 
Tookad VTP occurred at a much lower incidence than after radical therapy and patients recovered rapidly 
once the treatment has been delivered. According to this view, long-term outcome studies are not considered 
feasible (and are not required for non-drug approaches that are currently in use) as they are not considered 
commercially attractive and the technology might become redundant due to evolving diagnostic standards. 
Although the uncertainty associated with lack of long-term outcome data is acknowledged, available surgical 
outcome data assessing the feasibility of radical therapy following Tookad VTB did not raise concerns (Lebdai 
et al.). Thus, the uncertainty could be acceptable as long as the data were collected post-marketing and clear 
communications of benefits and uncertainties to a selected population. 
Patient management post Tookad VTP is not clear. Follow-up PSA measurements may be difficult to interpret 
due to the remaining prostate tissue. There is at least a theoretical risk that the sensitivity of follow-up 
prostate biopsies could be reduced and that residual tumour cells within the treated area could become more 
aggressive. Local fibrosis may impair the ability to later successfully undergo treatment with curative intent. 
The SAG was asked to discuss these factors and whether they influence the population for which Tookad VTP 
could be indicated. How should these risks be monitored? Can the SAG propose an algorithm for patient 
follow-up in the months and years post Tookad VTP? 
According to a majority of SAG members, in the absence of long-term data, it is not possible to exclude a risk 
of detriment in terms of long-term outcome associated with Tookad VTB. In the absence of such reassurance, 
given the availability of highly efficacious treatment (radical therapy) and valid management options such as 
active surveillance, it is difficult to accept the risk of a detriment in long-term outcomes or to minimise it 
through intense monitoring. Equally, it is not possible to propose an evidence-based algorithm for patient 
follow-up after Tookad VTP.

However, some SAG members disagreed (see answer to questions No. 1). Concerning detriment in terms of 
long-term outcome, the only relevant detriment that could be caused is a more tedious or difficult radical 
prostatectomy but as discussed above, this has not been objectivated or shown in the data available. 
According to this view, some uncertainties remain, but patients with low risk Gleason score 3+3 disease, 
excluding very low risk disease, could  benefit from this focal therapy (low risk disease defined as stage 
T1c/T2a, prostate specific antigen 10 ng/ml or less, and Gleason score 6 or less; very low risk disease 
defined as stage T1c, prostate specific antigen density 0.15 or less, Gleason score 6 or less, 2 or fewer 
positive biopsy cores, 50% or less cancer involvement per core). Further analysis of the available data might 
guide the exploration of the population for which Tookad VTP could be indicated, fully acknowledging the 
methodological drawbacks of exploratory subgroup analysis. The trial only included unilateral ablation and 
this should likely be reflected in a potential indication. Diagnostic workup should be based on current 
standards such as modern multi-parametric MRI-based strategies and template based biopsy procedures. 
This treatment option might be preferred by low risk patients who prefer active treatment due to personal 
circumstances, e.g., direct personal experience of close relative (father, grandfather) dying at young age of 
metastatic prostate cancer. 
Considering current treatment paradigms for localised low risk prostate cancer, can the SAG suggest a 
patient population in whom Tookad VTP would represent a suitable therapeutic option?  
For a majority of SAG members, the risk of a detriment in long-term outcome was considered unknown in 
this low risk population, and this is a concern given the availability of alternative management options and 
treatments, despite the high rate of early and longstanding adverse effects associated with radical treatment.  
However, some SAG members disagreed, and considered that Tookad VTP could be a useful procedure for 
higher risk patients (in this low risk group) who prefer deferring radical therapy and potentially avoiding it 
altogether (see answer to questions No. 1 and 2). According to this view, the risk of detriment long term was 
considered acceptable.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  presented  efficacy  results  showed  a  statistically  significant  improvement  for  Tookad  VTP  over  active 
surveillance  for  both  co-primary  endpoints  and  the  main  secondary  endpoints  (initiation  of  radical  therapy 
and  tumour  burden)  in  the  ITT  population.  In  the  targeted  population,  the  observed  results  were  better  for 
the  key  endpoints  used  for  the  comparison  of  Tookad  vs.  Active  Surveillance.  These  results  are  considered 
clinically relevant for patients with low risk prostate cancer (excluding very low risk) wishing to defer radical 
therapy being fully informed about potential risks and uncertainties (see RMP).  
The risk of/time to receiving radical therapy (RT), with its consequent ADRs, was also substantially delayed, 
although the reduction in risk of radical therapy and genitourinary toxicities has to be considered with caution 
in M24 to M48 due to a potential for under-detection of the need of radical therapy.  
Considering the short duration of follow-up and the potential risk that Tookad VPT compromises the results of 
local treatment with curative intent, the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues 
related to efficacy:

Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further investigate long-term efficacy of Tookad and its 
impact on disease progression including potential impact on the efficacy of subsequent radical therapy in 
patients with low risk prostate cancer as well as further characterise the long term safety of Tookad, the MAH 
should submit the results of a randomised phase 3 study in patients with localised prostate cancer compared 
to active surveillance (7-year follow-up study including in an depth biopsy study) (PCM301 FU5).

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Up to 1 October 2015, 517 subjects had received Tookad in 11 clinical trials. 
• 
• 
Phase 1: 42 healthy male volunteers - 1 study 
Phase  2:  age  related  macular  degeneration  (AMD)  -  2  studies  (32  patients);  inoperable 
cholangiocarcinoma  -1  study  (7  patients);  obstructing  endobronchial  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  -1 
study (3 patients) and renal carcinoma – 1 study (4 patients); localised prostate cancer - 3 studies: 
- PCM201: 40 patients, 4 retreated in same lobe, 1 in contralateral lobe 
- PCM202: 30 patients, 7 retreated in same lobe 
- PCM203: 85 patients, 6 retreated same lobe, 2 in contralateral lobe 
• 
Phase 3 – localised prostate cancer - 2 studies 
- PCM301: 196 patients received Tookad, 62 treated in contralateral lobe, 11 retreated in same lobe 
and 2 later had bilateral treatment 
- PCM304: 78 patients received Tookad, 17 in contralateral lobe before Month 6, after Month 6 - 3 in 
previously treated lobe, 1 in contralateral lobe and 4 in both lobes.  
One  patient  was  granted  access  to  Tookad  D  via  a  special  permission  programme  in  Panama,  bringing  the 
total to 518 subjects.

WST 11 was given as a single 10 minute intravenous administration. Around 120 patients received a second 
Tookad infusion in the treatment of the same or the contralateral lobe.  
The applicant presented a pooled analysis of the 398 patients in the ITT population who received the 
recommended dose of 4mg/kg Tookad and 200J/cm light. Of these 7 patients did not receive Tookad due to 
events occurring after the start of anaesthesia but before the administration of study drug. The mean amount 
of study medication per patient was 31.7mL (relative dose intensity 100%) with the first treatment, 31.6mL 
(relative dose intensity 100%) with a second VTP therapy and 32.1mL (relative dose intensity 100.1%) with 
retreatment.

Adverse events 
Phase 1 Study 
Single  intravenous  doses  of  WST11  were  administered  to  42  subjects.  Eight  subjects  reported  9  treatment 
emergent  adverse  events  during  the  study.  Vasovagal  syncope  was  the  most  frequently  reported  AE  (3/9) 
experienced  around  3  hours  post  injection;  one  subject  in  the  1.25mg/kg  group  experienced  vasovagal 
syncope  twice  at  a  time  interval  of  about  10  minutes;  the  other  event  was  at  the  5mg/kg  dose.  Other 
adverse  events  were  linked  to  the  intravenous  administration  and  included  hand  paraesthesia  (2.5mg/kg 
dose,  3  minutes  post  initiation  of  infusion)  and  injection  site  hypersensitivity  (vein  tingling  with  15mg/kg 
dose 4 minutes post initiation of infusion) or were hypersensitivity type reactions, namely urticaria (5mg/kg 
dose 4 days post injection) and generalised pruritus (10mg/kg lasted for <4 days 1 week post injection).  
One serious adverse event (photosensitisation-erythema) was reported for one subject in the 15 mg/kg dose 
group.  
There  was  no  relationship  between  the  number  of  AEs  and  administered  dose.  There  was  no  obvious  trend 
with  regards  to  mean  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  and  the  vasovagal  events.  Eleven  subjects  had 
ECG values out of normal range, judged not clinically significant. Measurement of QT interval and QTc (Bazett 
corrected) was automatically performed with manual over - reading of values over 440ms. Manual reading of 
QT  was  performed  on  3  subjects  pre-dose  and  6  subjects  post-dose.  After  manual  reading  only  1  QTc 
remained slightly long at 48 hours (431ms).  
Pooled safety analysis of phase II and phase III patients treated with optimal drug and light doses 
The  optimal  dose  of  drug  and  light  in  the  treatment  of  localized  prostate  cancer  has  been  determined  as 
4mg/kg of Tookad and a light intensity of 200 Joules per cm of fibre. Among the 429 patients treated during 
the  five  clinical  studies  in localized prostate  cancer patients,  the  number of  patients  treated  with doses  and 
light intensities other than 4 mg/kg (i.e. 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg) and 200 J/cm (i.e. 300 J/cm) was very small 
with the exception of study PCM203 where 21 patients were treated with 6 mg/kg and 200 J/cm. However, 
there was no apparent relationship between higher dose and adverse events.  
The use of Tookad is part of the VTP procedure that involves anaesthesia and the insertion of the light fibres 
as  well  as  the  activation  of  light;  therefore,  any  patient  who  was  in  the  clinical  study  who  was  expected  to 
receive all of these components is included in the denominator for the safety overview. Of the 398 patients, 
only  391  received  Tookad.  The  difference  of  7  patients  is  due  to  events  occurring  after  the  start  of 
anaesthesia but before the administration of the study drug. 
In  the  pooled  Phase  2/3  analysis,  1375  AEs  were  reported  in  331  of  398  subjects  (83.2%)  of  the  safety 
population.  Among  them,  902  adverse  events  in  290  patients  (72.9%)  were  considered  as  related  to  drug 
and/or  device  and/or  VTP  procedure.  A  total  of  107  serious  adverse  events  (SAE)  in  79  patients  (19.8%) 
were observed in this study, of which 51 in 41 patients (10.3%) were considered as related to drug and/or 
device and/or VTP procedure.  
The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reactions  in  the  Phase  II  and  III  clinical  studies  were  urinary  and 
reproductive  system  disorders:  dysuria  (25.1  %),  erectile  dysfunction  (21.1  %),  haematuria  (19.6  %), 
perineal pain/haematoma (15.3 %), urinary retention (13.3 %), micturition urgency (9.0 %), pollakiuria (7.3 
%), urinary tract infection (5.5 %), incontinence (5.3 %) and ejaculation failure (5.0 %).

In  the  table  below  an  active  surveillance  group  has  been  added  as  for  Study  PCM301  this  was  randomised 
between active intervention (VTP) and active surveillance.  
Table 59 Summary Treatment Emergent Adverse Events in Phase II and Phase III Prostate Cancer 
Studies at the Recommended Dose 
The most common adverse events, regardless of causality, were seen in the SOC “Renal and Urinary 
Disorders” (58.5% of the patients) and in the SOC “Reproductive System and Breast Disorders” (46.2%). 
Those were mainly dysuria (28.4%), erectile dysfunction (25.6%), haematuria (20.6%), perineal pain 
(15.6%) and transient urinary retention (14.1%). These were most often considered related to the procedure 
and are a result of the need to put in the light fibres to the prostate (insertion of needles into the prostate, 
catheter etc.).

The most frequent adverse events are presented below in descending order of frequency and the events that 
occurred in the active surveillance arm of study PCM301 are provided for reference. In the case of the active 
surveillance patients the adverse events were usually as a result of their prostate size or from biopsies that 
were not only part of the study but also part of routine active surveillance activities. Because of their nature 
and frequency and relatedness, certain adverse events have been identified as adverse events of special 
interest and marked with an (*) in the table below as these will be followed specifically for risk management 
purposes. In addition, AEs related to the VTP procedure are included.

Erectile dysfunction 
In the Phase III European study, 60 (30.5 %) of patients in the Tookad -VTP arm experienced erectile 
dysfunction and 16 (8.1 %) experienced ejaculation failure. 53 (26.9 %) patients experienced erectile 
dysfunction for more than 6 months, including 34 (17.3 %) patients in whom the erectile dysfunction had not 
resolved at the end of the study. When the analysis was restricted to patients that underwent unilateral VTP, 
33 (16.8 %) patients experienced erectile dysfunction for more than 6 months, including 17 (8.6 %) patients 
in whom the erectile dysfunction had not resolved at the end of the study. 
Urinary retention 
In the Phase III European study, 30 (15.2 %) patients experienced urinary retention. The median time to 
onset of urinary retention was 3 days (1-417). The median duration was 10 days (1-344). 
Genito-urinary infections 
The most common infections are orchitis, epididymitis and urinary tract infections including cystitis. In the 
Phase III European study, 20 (10.2 %) patients in the Tookad -VTP arm experienced genito-urinary infection. 
In 5 (2.5 %) patients, the infection was considered serious. The median time to onset of genito-urinary 
infections was 22.5 days (4-360). The median duration was 21 days (4-197). 
Urinary incontinence 
In the Phase III European study, 25 (12.7 %) patients experienced urinary incontinence (including 
incontinence, stress urinary incontinence and urge incontinence). The median time to onset of urinary 
incontinence was 4 days (1-142). In 18 patients the adverse event resolved with a median duration of 63.5 
days (1-360), and the adverse event was still ongoing at the end of the study for 7 patients. Only 1 (0.5 %) 
patient had a severe (Grade 3) urinary incontinence. None of these patients required an operation for 
incontinence. 
Perineal injury, perineal pain and prostatitis 
Perineal injury and perineal pain occurred in 46 (23.4 %) patients in the controlled Phase III European study. 
In some cases pain relief was required for perineal pain or anorectal discomfort. One patient had Grade 3 
perineal pain that started 35 weeks after the VTP procedure, and lasted for about 35 weeks before resolving 
without sequelae. 
Prostatitis occurred in 7 (3.6 %) patients in the controlled Phase III European study. One patient had Grade 3 
prostatitis considered as serious that started 4 days after the VTP procedure, and lasted for 31 days before 
resolving without sequelae. 
Urethral stenosis 
In the pivotal Phase III European study, moderate or severe urethral stenosis developed in 2 (1.0 %) 
patients 5 to 6 months post-procedure. This required urethral dilatation (see section 4.4). 
Extraprostatic necrosis 
Two cases of excessive extraprostatic necrosis occurred due to incorrect laser calibration without clinical 
sequelae. One case of external urethral fistula occurred due to fibre misplacement (see section 4.4).

Phototoxicity 
In a patient treated at 2 mg/kg of Tookad, one case of Grade 3 ischaemic optic neuropathy was reported 
33 days after the VTP procedure. This resolved with a small defect in the visual field. 
Prostatic abscess 
One serious adverse event of prostatic abscess which was considered severe was reported in the study 
performed in Latin America in a patient who had a unilateral VTP procedure. The case resolved within three 
days.

Only  35  patients  underwent  retreatment  in  the  same  lobe  that  had  originally  been  treated  so  single  events 
had a more profound effect on the overall percentage. The retreatment procedures generally occurred after 
examination  of  the  first  on  study  biopsy  (6  months  for  the  Phase  IIs  and  PCM304  and  12  months  for 
PCM301).  There  was  a  slight  increase  in  the  proportion  of  TEAEs  and  serious  TEAEs  in  patients  retreated 
compared to those who were only treated once [TEAE: 33/35 (94.3%) vs. 294/356 (82.6%); serious TEAEs 
9/35  (25.7%)  vs.  69/356  (19.4%)].    The  main  increases  were  micturition  urgency  which  increased  from  1 
(2.9%)  to  6  (17.1%)  events  and  proctalgia,  post-procedure  haematuria,  asthenia  and  pain  that  increased 
from 0 to 2 events.

Non-study post-authorisation exposure and “special permission” cases 
A single patient was granted “special permission” status to receive Tookad experienced severe extra-prostatic 
necrosis with urinary fistula following treatment resulting in hospitalisation. The event was considered to be 
probably related to the study medication, procedure and device as all three aspects of the procedure may be 
implicated in the extraprostatic necrosis; however, examination of the ultrasound scans taken at the time of 
the procedure suggested that the lengths of the fibres were significantly longer than the ones recommended 
by the treatment guidance performed at the beginning of the procedure, which would have been responsible 
for extra prostatic exposure and subsequent necrosis.

Serious adverse events 
A total of 107 serious adverse events (SAE) in 79 patients (19.8%) were observed in the five prostate cancer 
studies. Of these, 51 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) in 41 patients were considered to be related to the study 
drug  and/or  study  device  or  the  procedure  and  58  were  not  related.  In  addition,  25  unrelated  SAE  were 
observed  out  of  207  patients  in  the  Active  Surveillance  arm  of  study  PCM301.  Two  SAEs  in  the  active 
surveillance  group  followed  radical  prostatectomy  (urinary  tract  infection  and  deep  vein  thrombosis)  and 
there  were  two  cases  of  pyrexia  following  biopsies.  The  other  SAE  that  occurred  more  than  once  was 
myocardial  infarction  (3  patients).  Those  events  considered  related  to  study  drug,  study  device  or  VTP 
procedure are summarized in the below table.

In the combined studies only 7% of adverse events were considered Grade 3, predominantly in the renal and 
reproductive  SOC.  At  the  recommended  dose  and  light  intensity  in  398  patients  there  were  five  cases  of 
Grade 3 dysuria (1.3%), two cases of haematuria (0.5%), four cases of urinary retention (1.0%), 3 cases of 
prostatitis, a Grade 3 prostatic abscess and 3 cases of Grade 3 erectile dysfunction (0.8%). Additionally there 
was  one  life-threatening  (Grade  4)  event  (bronchospasm)  related  to  an  anaesthetic  drug.  One  Grade  5 
(myocardial infarct leading to death) was observed in the safety population at the recommended dose level. 
In general, the pattern of SAEs followed that of non-serious AEs. In particular, 33 (66%) out of the 51 SAEs 
considered as related to study drug and/or device and/or procedure were genitourinary tract disorders in the  
Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. 
The  most  commonly  observed  related  SAEs  were  urinary  retentions  (16  cases).  Apart  from  two  cases 
described  below,  all  the  cases  of  urinary  retention  started  within  the  first  9  days  following  the  surgical 
procedure  and  are  probably  secondary  to  the  swelling  of  the  prostate  due  to  the  insertion  of  the  catheters 
needed to place the fibres in the prostate. They resolved in less than 7 days for eight of them, in 12, 15, 18, 
25, 32 and 33 days for six others and in 43 days for a patient who had a medical history of benign prostatic 
hypertrophy. The two exceptions to the urinary retention being associated to the VTP procedure date were of 
a Mexican patient in whom the retention occurred 8 months after the VTP and had to be treated with a TURP 
and  one  other  case  in  study  PCM301  that  started  13  months  after  the  VTP  procedure  (and  is  classed  as 
possibly related to the VTP procedure on the clinical database but unrelated in the SAE narrative). 
Haematuria  and  dysuria  are  also  a  direct  consequence  of  the  procedure  (traumatic  catheterization,  needles 
insertion, with a possible accidental puncture of the bladder or of the urethra), all of them resolved in within 
3 days after the procedure.

There was one case of serious long-term urinary incontinence which occurred in a patient who previously had 
a TURP.  
The four cases of urethral stenosis started within 2 to 6 months after the procedure. In some cases, it may 
be a late consequence of the necrosis, however, on some other cases, the bulbar location of the stenosis was 
more in favour of a urethral traumatism (e.g. catheterization). All of them resolved with a TURP. Prostatitis, 
urinary tract infections and orchitis were also seen in some patients. 
Deaths 
No  deaths  related  to  the  study  drug,  the  study  device  or  the  study  procedure  was  reported  in  the  five 
localized prostate cancer studies. A patient died of a myocardial infarction 34 weeks after receiving a single 
dose of Tookad in study PCM301. The event was deemed unrelated to drug, device or protocol procedure. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology/ biochemistry 
PCM201: D-dimer levels were increased from baseline at 4 hours post procedure and remained elevated at 
Day 4. This was considered to be related to the anaesthetic and the procedure (insertion of needles in the 
perineum). A decrease in fibrinogen was observed post procedure. Mean baseline value was 3.3g/L; it 
decreased to 2.4g/L (-0.9 mean change) 4 hours post procedure; returned to normal Day 2 and increased at 
1 week to 5.3g/l (+2.0 mean change). The neutrophils showed the same pattern of increase as the D-dimers.  
PCM301: No consistent difference between 2 groups except all subjects in the VTP arm had an elevated D-
dimer (up to 20 x ULN) on the day after the VTP procedure.  The DSMB reviewed the D-dimer results and did 
not consider them of clinical significance.  
ECG Safety Report 
An exploratory ECG safety study ECG (not specified in the SAP) was conducted in Study PCM 201. The 
appraisal was based on a qualitative analysis of the main ECG variables derived from manual reading of 
paper ECG recordings, namely changes to morphology, central tendency and outlier effects for heart rate, QT 
and QTc intervals. The results indicated a marked effect of anaesthesia on QTcF but within the limitations of 
the study, i.e., small patient numbers and no control group, no clinically relevant changes in QTcF were 
observed following treatment with WST11.

Time with toxicities 
The Applicant has made an analysis of time with toxicity up to 48 months, using data available to date from 
the  5-year  follow-up  study.  This  analysis  was  extended  to  48  months  by  restricting  it  only  to  patients  who 
have  completed  the  follow  up  study  (i.e.  those  with  visits  at  36  and  48  months  completed).  This  approach 
was preferred to avoid further extrapolations on patients with no or partial follow-up. Confidence intervals at 
M24 and M48 have been estimated using bootstrap with 1000 simulations.

The table below summarizes the ratios of areas under the curve between Tookad and Active Surveillance for 
each type of toxicity and their total, calculated over 24 and 48 months. Of note, the analysis over 48 months 
is restricted to those patients who have completed the 48 months follow-up.

The overall ratio is 0.93 (95% CI= 0.47-1.03) vs. 1.16 previously estimated. For ED: 1.15 (95% CI= 0.47-
1.03) vs. 1.41 previously, and for UI: 0.23 (95% CI= 0.13-0.45) vs. 0.46 previously.  
Due to the stable reduction in risk of RT between M24 and M48, the ratio of relative time with toxicity in the 
overall trial population is greater at M48 compared to M24: 0.58 overall (95% CI: 0.27-0.64), with 0.63 for 
ED (95% CI: 0.28-0.69) and 0.36 for UI (95% CI: 0.16-0.47).

The Applicant also conducted a further analysis of time with toxicity in the indication sub-population without 
imputation of toxicities from ProtecT after radical therapy events.  
•  80 and 78 patients were included in the analysis between M0 and M24 respectively in the Tookad and 
the Active Surveillance arms, and 52 and 44 patients respectively in the period M24-M48 
• 
• 
In the Tookad arm, a total of 18 AEs were available in the M0-M24 period, with 15 pre-radical 
therapy and 3 post, and 15 EDs and 3 UIs. A total of 9 AEs were available in the M24-M48 period, 
with 5 pre-radical therapy and 4 post, and 6 EDs and 3 UIs 
In the Active Surveillance arm, a total of 12 AEs were available in the M0-M24 period, with 10 pre-
radical therapy and 2 post, and 10 EDs and 2 UIs. A total of 6 AEs were available in the M24-M48 
period, with 3 pre-radical therapy and 3 post, and 4 EDs and 2 UIs

Safety profile in target population vs overall population 
In the target population, for the Tookad VTP group, there was a 6.4% reduction in the frequency of Grade 3 
events and an 8.0% increase in the frequency of Grade 2 events. When focusing only on the drug, device of 
procedure related events, the frequencies of the different severity grades are fairly consistent with a limited 
increase in Grade 2 events (4.7%) and limited decrease of Grade 3 events (3.3%). 
The review of safety data in the overall population and target population showed similar profiles. The most 
noticeable differences were: 
•  A decrease of the overall incidence of SAEs in the Tookad arm for the indication sub-population 
compared to the overall population (26.6% vs. 30.5%) 
•  A decrease in the proportion of subjects with Grade 3-5 AEs (15.2% vs. 22.3%) and consequently an 
increase in the proportion of subjects with Grade 2 AEs (55.7% vs. 47.7%) 
• 
The differences were smaller when considering only drug, device or VTP procedure-related SAEs or 
AEs 
•  Among the most frequent AEs (incidence ≥5% of subjects), the difference vs. the AS group became 
not statistically significant for micturition urgency, pollakiuria, and ejaculation failure and remained 
statistically significant for dysuria, haematuria, urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, and perineal 
pain. 
Safety in special populations 
Data were reviewed according to age (≤65 versus > 65 years of age) as well as for patients with co-existing 
hypertension or diabetes.

Elderly: Mean age was 64 years and in total 160 patients were > 65 years of age and 237 patients were ≤ 65 
years of age. The oldest patient was 85 years old so the applicant has set no upper age limit provided that 
the patient is fit for general anaesthetic. Overall there was no difference in the occurrence of adverse events 
(all  cause  or  related)  between  the  2  categories  [subjects  with  at  least  1  related  AE  174/237  (73.4%)  vs. 
116/160  (72.5%)].  However,  more  patients  were  hospitalised  for  AEs  in  the  older  age  group  [SAEs  37/237 
(15.6%)  vs.  41/160  (25.6%)].  Certain  events  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  different  age  categories  – 
bradycardia,  diarrhoea,  inguinal  hernia,  epididymitis,  scrotal  injury,  dizziness  and  depression  in  the  elderly; 
perineal pain, ejaculation failure and increased d-dimer in younger patients.

Patients with co-morbidities 
Hypertension:  Around  40%  of  patients  from  the  pooled  analysis  had  co-existing  hypertension  (n=158). 
Overall the proportion of patients with at least 1 TEAE or related TEAE was similar in the 2 groups [≥1 TEAE 
135/158  (85.4%)  vs.  196/240  (81.7%);  related  TEAE  118/  158  (74.7%)  vs.  172/240  (71.7%)].  Serious 
TEAEs were more frequent in those with hypertension [42/158 (26.6%) vs. 37/240 (15.4%)]. In terms of all 
cause  adverse  events  between  the  2  groups  there  were  no  consistent  differences  but  infections  and 
infestations appeared higher in those with hypertension.  
Diabetes:  Only  a  few  patients  had  diabetes  (n=45)  so it is  difficult  to  compare  individual  AEs  for  incidence. 
The incidence of TEAEs and serious TEAEs were similar between those with and without diabetes. 
Patients with hepatic/renal impairment 
No safety data in hepatic/ renal impairment has been submitted.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No safety data were submitted. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall 7 patients were withdrawn from the studies due to AEs. In the Phase II prostate cancer studies and in 
study PCM 301 the withdrawals were due to AEs deemed unrelated to the study drug. The patient in PCM201 
was withdrawn due to an ECG change, in PCM203 due to hypotension and the 2 patients in PCM 301 due to 
myocardial infarction 9.5 months post Tookad and anaphylactic reaction to anaesthesia.  
Three patients were withdrawn because of an AE in study PCM304. One patient had a stroke (unrelated); one 
withdrew consent after experiencing decreased erectile function and one was  withdrawn to undergo a TURP 
for urethral stenosis.

Post marketing experience 
As  of  29  September  2016,  38  patients  have  been  treated  as  part  of  a  special  authorisation  programme  or 
post-marketing (Mexico). Of these 38 patients, 6 patients experienced a total of 7 AEs, 4 considered serious. 
No AEs have been reported from the patients treated in Mexico. There were 3 events of orchitis, 3 of urinary 
retention and 1 extraprostatic necrosis. All of the events were considered to be related to the VTP procedure 
and were Grade 2 or 3 in severity. These AEs are already covered in the product information. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The pooled analysis was adequately performed in the 398 ITT population receiving the recommended dose of 
4 mg/kg Tookad and 200 J/cm light. The small number of subjects that did not receive the study drug is not 
expected to influence the results. Considering the number of subjects exposed to Tookad in the reported 
trials and the proportion of those patients that were treated with the proposed dose and light energy, there is 
sufficient patient exposure and data for an adequate safety evaluation. 
The  overall  number  of  patients  with  adverse  events  was  similar  across  all  of  the  studies  where  patients 
received VTP except for the Latin American study (PCM304) where reporting of events appeared to be lower 
for both all cause and related events, however the pattern of adverse events was similar to the other studies. 
PCM  201  also  reported  lower  events  related  to  any  part  of  the  procedure  than  the  other  studies.  Excluding 
PCM304 did not alter the frequency category in the SmPC or result in inclusion of additional ADRs (data not 
shown). 
Given the nature of the treatment, it is not possible to single out the relation of the drug to the AE, as device 
and VTP procedure also have to be considered. The most common AEs were usually considered to be related 
to the procedure as a consequence of inserting optical fibres into the prostate and the consequent prostate 
inflammation and swelling e.g. dysuria, erectile dysfunction, haematuria, perineal pain and urinary retention 
all occurred in over 10% of patients. These mainly recovered within a few days without sequelae. Erectile 
function declined to Month 3 followed by stabilisation. These events are reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
When given alone, as in the healthy volunteer study, Tookad is very well tolerated. Events reported in the 42 
healthy volunteers were mainly vasovagal (3 events), tingling at the injection site within minutes of injection 
and  urticaria/  pruritus  that  occurred  about  4  days  post  injection.  Discomfort  on  injection  would  not  be 
captured in patients under general anaesthetic. Tookad can have a pH up to 9 which is at the limit of what 
can  be  infused  through  a  peripheral  line  without  causing  vascular  complications.  In  study  PCM201,  WST11 
was infused through a fast-flowing peripheral line (antecubital catheter) or a central line. Good venous access 
will  be  required.  Phlebitis  does  not  appear  to  have  been  identified  as  a  safety  concern  preclinically  or 
clinically.

Considering  the  risk  of  phototoxicity  with  Tookad,  precautions  such  as  preventing  exposure  to  bright  light 
during  the  procedure  and  the  need  to  wear  clothes  covering  the  skin  and  dark  glasses  for  a  day  following 
injection  are  reflected  in  the  SmPC  to  reduce  the  risk  of  any  phototoxic  reaction.  Tookad’s  maximum 
absorption  is  in  the  near  infrared  domain  (NIR)  at  753  nm.  Artificial  light  sources  other  than  television  are 
considered  in  the  warnings  (see  SmPC  section  4.4)  but  the  risk  is  very  low,  if  any,  considering  the  light 
emitted spectrum for such devices. The half-life of Tookad D ranges from 1.14-1.70 hours in prostate cancer 
patients and so, unlike other photosensitising agents, these precautions do not have to be in place for more 
than  48  hours.  As  no  true  phototoxic  events  have  been  reported  this  suggests  that  the  precautions 
recommended  shielding  the  patients  from  light  except  for  the  target  tissue  have  been  successful. 
Photosensitivity is an important identified risk in the RMP. The Guideline for Physician that will be put in place 
includes guidance for light protection. 
A  case  of  visual  impairment  (PCM201)  and  a  case  of  photophobia/  eye  irritation  (PCM301)  were  reported. 
Although  this  followed  bilateral  therapy  with  1  lobe  treated  with  a  single  fibre  delivering  300J/cm  it  is  not 
clear  how  increased  local  light  delivery  would  alter  the  likelihood  of  a  systemic  event.  Eye  irritation  and 
photophobia are listed in the SmPC (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Anal and rectal haemorrhages have also been reported and are included in the SmPC (see SmPC section 4.8). 
After  a  review  of  these  cases  as  well  as  those  of  haemorrhoids  it  was  considered  that  the  most  likely 
explanation,  for  those  that  occurred  soon  after  VTP,  was  that  manipulation  of  the  rectal  probe  exacerbated 
pre-existing haemorrhoids which resulted in them being obvious to the patient or causing bleeding. 
Unspecific  adverse  events  probably  linked  to  the  general  anaesthesia  were  also  observed:  transient  global 
amnesia,  bradycardia,  sinus  arrhythmia,  atrial 
fibrillation,  hypotension,  bronchospasm,  pharyngeal 
inflammation, respiratory tract congestion, nausea,  vomiting, constipation, pyrexia, procedural hypotension. 
Some  cases  of  hepatotoxicity  (1.5 %),  such  as  elevation  of  transaminases,  were  also  reported.  All  of  them 
were mild in intensity (see SmPC section 4.8).  
Tookad  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  any  medical  condition  that  precludes  the  administration  of  a 
general anaesthetic or invasive procedures (see SmPC section 4.3). 
In the combined studies, only 7% of adverse events were considered Grade 3 predominantly in the renal and 
reproductive SOC. Additionally there was one life-threatening (Grade 4) event (bronchospasm) related to an 
anaesthetic drug used at the procedure. The risk of serious adverse events is not only related to the drug but 
also to device and procedure, which is performed under anaesthesia. There were also study associated SAE 
which are not related to treatment but to other study procedures, namely prostate biopsy.  
The most common SAE was urinary retention and the risk was related to prostate volume. It was higher for 
volumes  above  50  mL  (data  not  shown)  but  no  threshold  could  be  identified.  Patients  with  a  history  of 
urethral  stricture or  with urinary  flow  problems  may  be  at  increased  risk  of  poor  flow  and  urinary  retention 
post  the  Tookad  VTP  procedure.  Urinary  retention  immediately  post  procedure  has  been  attributed  to 
transient  prostatic  oedema  and  generally  only  short  term  recatheterisation  was  required.  Poor  urinary  flow 
due  to  urethral  stricture  developed  some  months  post  procedure.  In  certain  cases,  the  bulbar  location 
suggested  that  the  stenosis  was  caused  by  urinary  catheterisation.  In  other  cases,  urethral  stenosis  may 
have been a late consequence of Tookad VTP induced necrosis. Although they were excluded from the clinical 
trials,  there  is  a  potential  risk  of  increased  stenosis  post  the  Tookad  VTP  procedure  for  patients  with  pre-
existing stenosis (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8).

TEAEs  and  SAEs  increased  with  bilateral  and  re-treatment,  particularly  micturition  urgency  and  proctalgia, 
post-procedure haematuria, asthenia and pain. Bilateral and re-treatment are not recommended (see SmPC 
section 4.2). 
Three  cases  of  myocardial  infarction  were  reported,  one  of  them  fatal.  The  time  delay  to  VTP  and  the 
description of the cases support the conclusion as not related to the study drug, study device or procedure. 
With  careful  treatment  planning,  the  extent  of  necrosis  should  be  confined  to  the  prostate  although  some 
extra-prostatic  necrosis  is  not  unusual.  There  may  be  extra-prostatic  necrosis  in  the  peri-prostatic  fat  not 
associated  with  clinical  symptoms.  Excessive  extraprostatic  necrosis  occurred  as  a  result  of  incorrect 
calibration  of  the  laser  or  placement  of  the  light  fibres  (see  SmPC  section  4.8).  In  consequence  there  is  a 
potential  risk  of  damage  to  adjacent  structures,  such  as  the  bladder  and/or  rectum,  and  development  of  a 
recto urethral or external fistula. A urinary fistula has occurred in one case due to incorrect fibre placement. 
To date, although there has been evidence of some necrosis into muscles of the rectal wall in isolated cases, 
no recto-urethral fistula has been reported.  
Urethral stenosis onset was within 2 to 6 months of VTP, possibly as a late consequence of necrosis or 
urethral trauma post catheterisation. All resolved with a TURP and it remains to be seen if more cases 
emerge with prolonged follow-up. Urethral stenosis is included as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Severe  long-term  urinary  incontinence  was  observed  in  a  patient  who  underwent  a  previous  transurethral 
prostatectomy  (TURP).  This  event  was  not  considered  to  be  related  to  a  faulty  procedure  but  rather  the 
pre-existing  damage  to  the  internal  urethral  sphincter  from  the  TURP.  The  Tookad  -VTP procedure  is 
contraindicated in patients with any previous prostatic interventions where the internal urinary sphincter may 
have  been  damaged,  including  trans-urethral  resection  of  the  prostate  (TURP)  for  benign  prostatic 
hypertrophy (see section 4.3). Long-term urinary incontinence is also included as an important potential risk 
in the RMP. The risk of sphincter damage can be minimised by careful planning of the fibre placement using 
the treatment guidance software.  
The equipment should be carefully calibrated and the treatment guidance software should be used to reduce 
the risk of clinically significant extraprostatic necrosis (see SmPC section 4.4).   Complications of extra-
prostatic necrosis are included as important potential risk in the RMP. Long-term safety (including 
consequences of tissue necrosis) will be evaluated as part of the post authorisation efficacy studies (PAES) 
(see RMP).   
Being  an  operator  dependent  treatment  namely  in  the  accuracy  of  light  probe  placing,  with  safety 
implications (extra-prostatic necrosis), the mention that Tookad should only be used by personnel trained in 
the  Vascular-Targeted  Photodynamic  therapy  (VTP)  procedure  in  SmPC  section  4.2  is  adequate.  Procedural 
related  injuries  and  complications  due  to  non-compliance  with  the  device  manufacturers’  instructions  and 
recommended  guidance  for  the  VTP  procedure  are  included  as  important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  Both 
human error and device failure and are covered by this safety concern.

Patients with very low-risk prostate cancer have disease detected by prostate biopsy based upon serum PSA 
only,  without  detectable  abnormality  on  digital  rectal  examination  or  imaging.  To  be  classified  as  very  low 
risk, such patients must have a tumour that is in histologic grade group 1 (Gleason score ≤6) on biopsy and a 
serum  PSA  <10  ng/mL.  Furthermore,  the  extent  of  disease  within  the  prostate  must  be  limited  (i.e.,  fewer 
than  three  positive  biopsy  cores  with  less  than  50  percent  involvement  in  any  one  core  and  a  PSA  density 
less  than  0.15  ng/mL/gram).  In  this  indolent  disease,  radical  treatment  is  to be  considered  only in  patients 
with  life  expectancy  of  more  than  20  years.  Active  surveillance  has  become  the  dominant  management  for 
low-risk  prostate  cancer,  with  the  highest  rates  yet  reported  and  almost  complete  uptake  for  very-low-risk 
cancer.  Considering  the  excellent  prognosis  for  this  group  and  the  uncertainties  regarding  Tookad  VTP  long 
term  safety  and  implications  for  radical  treatment,  Tookad  use  is  restricted  to  higher  risk  patients. 
Considering  the  above  and  the  SAG  discussion,  the  indication  was  revised to  exclude  very  low  risk  disease. 
Bilateral  treatment  was  also  excluded  from  the  indication,  due  to  concerns  regarding  efficacy  and  safety 
(lower coverage of the treatment area, higher extraprostatic necrosis).  
The safety evaluation subgroup analyses showed that the incidences of AEs and SAEs related to drug, device, 
or VTP procedure are similar in the indication population and the overall trial population. Regarding the 
special AEs (incontinence, erectile dysfunction, urinary symptoms) that occurred in at least 5% of the 
subjects in the indication population, the results are very similar to the overall trial population.   
The level of acute and chronic morbidity in terms of erectile, bladder and bowel dysfunction in comparison to 
modern radical treatment techniques (e.g. nerve sparing prostatectomy/ robotic surgery/ intensity modulated 
radiotherapy) and other local treatments (e.g. cryotherapy) has been discussed. The Applicant has provided 
an analysis of time with toxicity up to 48 months, using data available to date from the 5-year follow-up 
study. Overall, a significantly lower time with erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence was observed for 
the Tookad arm in the overall population. The reduction in time with toxicity in the indication population was 
comparable to the overall trial population. In a further analysis without imputation of post-radical therapy 
toxicities, the ratio for ED toxicities tends to improve significantly over time, which confirms the previous 
observation that ED toxicities arise earlier in the Tookad arm, but with a greater proportion of transient 
toxicities, whereas the onset is later in the Active Surveillance arm, but with more permanent toxicities. The 
absence of post-radical therapy imputations favours the Active Surveillance arm significantly. This analysis is 
limited by the fact that the underlying data failed to comprehensively capture toxicities after radical-
therapies. A large post-authorisation study, PAES CLIN1501 PCM401, will provide relevant data to directly 
and robustly assess the time with genitourinary toxicities (see RMP). 
There are no data on long term safety of Tookad VTP and the impact of the chronic effects of tissue necrosis 
is not known, particularly with regards to erectile dysfunction, bladder and bowel function but also in terms of 
impact on the ability to perform subsequent radical therapy (surgery or radiotherapy) and on its outcomes 
(see also discussion on clinical efficacy and pharmacology).  
A review of 19 radical prostatectomy cases post-Tookad has shown that RT was significantly easier to 
perform and more effective (based on absence of positive margins) among patients who received unilateral 
VTP treatment compared to bilateral treatment. Hence, the exclusion of bilateral disease patients and the 
restriction to a single VTP procedure per patient in the indication sub-population results in a further reduction 
of risk.

Radical radiotherapy works through generation of free radicals to cause DNA damage and a hypoxic tumour 
environment, as would occur post Tookad -VTP induced vasoconstriction, is known to be more resistant to 
radiation damage. It could be hypothesized that incomplete vessel occlusion post VTP could lead to the 
selection of cancer cell lines that are more resistant to hypoxia, making further VTP treatments ineffective. 
The results of retreatments by Tookad of lobes previously treated by VTP, in terms of negative biopsies are 
not in favour of this hypothesis.  
Unlike  radiotherapy,  Tookad  D  VTP therapy  is  not directed  at  DNA but  it is  questionable  if  free  radicals  and 
oxygen species that are generated could be detrimental if the tissue survives. A systematic review of all the 
positive cores taken in a prostate lobe that had previously been treated by Tookad VTP was performed by a 
board certified uropathologist with a specific expertise in prostate cancer. This review did not show any sign 
of more aggressive residual or recurrent tumours in the treated areas (data not shown).  
Overall, it is uncertain whether Tookad VTP adversely influences the ability to later undertake radical therapy, 
either ‘missed opportunity’ through disease progression or due to the PD effect of vascular occlusion. 
Although the limited available data does not indicate greater difficulty to perform radical prostatectomy, 
further information should be collected in this regard. 
Long term safety is included as missing information in the RMP. A seven-year follow-up extension (study 
PCM301, PAES) and a long-term observational cohort study (CLIN1501 PCM401, PAES) are expected to 
gather additional long term safety information on Tookad in patients with low risk prostate cancer.  
 “Induction of more aggressive tumour histology by Tookad VTP treatment” and “Difficulty of subsequent 
surgery due to reduced size and fibrosis of the VTP-treated prostate” are also included in the RMP as 
important potential risk. These potential risks will be monitored in the follow-up of PCM301 and in the above 
mentioned study CLIN1501 PCM401 as described in the RMP. 
The SmPC contains relevant information to reflect the risks and uncertainties regarding the medium to long 
term outcome following Tookad VTP treatment, in particular in section 4.4 and section 4.8 but also in section 
5.1 of the SmPC in which the effect on urinary morbidity (IPSS) and erectile function (IIEF) following Tookad 
have  been  included.  Furthermore,  information  on  potential  benefits,  risks  and  uncertainties  will  also  be 
communicated to patients through the patient information guide and package leaflet, in order that they may 
take  informed  decisions  regarding  their  therapeutic  options.  The  Physician  guideline  will  also  contain 
information  about  approaches  (including  VTP  with  Tookad)  for  the  treatment  of  prostate  cancer  and  the 
potential  benefits,  risks  and  uncertainties  of  VTP  with  Tookad  allowing  an informed  decision before  deciding 
on treatment.  
Regarding laboratory findings, there was no consistent difference between 2 groups except all subjects in the 
VTP  arm  had  an  elevated  D-dimer  (up  to  20  x  ULN)  on  the  day  after  the  VTP  procedure.  D  dimer  can  be 
elevated post-surgery and also with inflammation so the elevation is likely related to the procedure. Only one 
case  of  hepatotoxicity  was  reported.  Mild  LFT  abnormalities  were  recorded  with  15.2%  of  patients  shifting 
from  Grade  0  ALT  at  Baseline  to  Grade  1  at  Day  7  post-procedure.  Hepatotoxicity  and  Alanine 
aminotransferase increased and aspartate aminotransferase increased are included in the SmPC (see section 
4.8).

As Tookad is only administered in a surgical setting under medical supervision, the risk of overdose is limited. 
In  addition,  Tookad  is  only  conditioned  in  vials  of  200  and  400  mg,  which  further  limits  the  risk.  Overall, 
there  is  limited  clinical  information  on  overdose  involving  Tookad.  Healthy  subjects  have  been  exposed  to 
doses  up  to  15  mg/kg  of  padeliporfin  di  potassium  (corresponding  to  13.73  mg/kg  of  padeliporfin)  without 
light activation and 23 patients have been treated with 6 mg/kg of padeliporfin di potassium (corresponding 
to 5.49 mg/kg of padeliporfin) without significant safety issues. However, a prolongation of photosensitisation 
is  possible  and  precautions  against  light  exposure  should  be  maintained  for  an  additional  24  hours.  An 
overdose  of  the  laser  light  may  increase  the  risk  of  undesirable  extraprostatic  necrosis  (see  SmPC  sections 
4.4 and 4.9).  
It  is  unknown  if  there  is  a  systemic  risk  of  vascular  occlusion  events  in  patients  previously  treated  with 
systemic  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  or  VEGF  receptor  antagonists  or  in  those  with  an 
underlying  increased  risk  of  clot  formation  (e.g.  autoimmune  diseases).  Concerning  the  prostate  only,  any 
increased  vascular  occlusion  within  the  prostate  lobe  should  be  beneficial  in  terms  of  local  treatment 
outcome.  
Patients with abnormal clotting may develop excessive bleeding due to the insertion of the needles required 
to position the light fibres. This may also cause bruising, haematuria and/or local pain. It is not expected that 
a  delay  in  clotting  will  reduce  the  effectiveness  of  the  Tookad  VTP  treatment;  however,  it  is  recommended 
that drugs that affect clotting are stopped prior to and for the immediate period following the VTP procedure 
(see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.5). The increased risk of bleeding in patients with clotting disorders if multiple 
needles  are  being  inserted  into  the  perineum  is  reflected  in  the  important  potential  risk  “Procedural  related 
injuries  and  complications”  and  in  the  missing  information  “Use  in  patients  with  clotting  disorders  and 
concomitant use of anticoagulants or anti-platelet therapy”. 
Anticoagulant  medicinal  products  and  those  that  decrease  platelet  aggregation  (e.g.  acetylsalicylic  acid) 
should  be  stopped  at  least  10  days  before  the  procedure  with  Tookad.  Medicinal  products  that  prevent  or 
reduce platelet aggregation should not be started for at least 3 days after the procedure (see SmPC section 
4.2). 
Various  aetiologies  can  lead  to  enteric  fistula  formation,  many  fistulas  occur  in  the  postoperative  setting. 
Approximately  20  to  30  percent  of  all  enterocutaneous  fistulas  arise  in  the  setting  of  Crohn  disease 
(spontaneous,  following  bowel  resection).  There  is  a  concern  that  extra-prostatic  necrosis  in  the  setting  of 
chronic pelvic inflammation, as in rectal inflammatory bowel disease, may increase the risk of recto-urethral 
fistula. Tookad VTP should only be administered, after careful clinical evaluation, to patients with a history of 
active rectal inflammatory bowel disease or any condition that may increase the risk of recto urethral fistula 
formation  (see  SmPC  section  4.4).  Current  exacerbation  of  rectal  inflammatory  bowel  disease  is  a 
contraindication  (see  SmPC  section  4.3).  Use  in  patients  with  inflammatory  bowel  disease is  included  under 
missing information in the RMP. 
Data  were  reviewed  according  to  age  (≤65  versus  >65  years  of  age)  as  well  as  for  those  patients  with  co-
existing  hypertension  or  diabetes.  There  was  no  signal  of  differential  related  safety  other  than  would  be 
expected  from  the  patient  age  or  co-morbidity  with  regard  to  the  use  of  Tookad,  the  device  or  the  overall 
procedure.  The  majority  of  those  AEs  are  local-regional  events  due  to  the  insertion  of  then  needle  and  the 
swelling of the prostate which are not likely to be influenced by the age of the patient. The age groups over 
75 years are under-represented but this reflects the product indication and the target population.

There  is  a  relatively  little  experience  on  the  use  of  Tookad  in  non-Caucasian  and  non-  Hispanic  patients. 
However, given the mechanism of action of the drug and the fact that no alteration for the procedure would 
be  expected  no  differences  in  the  safety  profile  between  the  mainly  Caucasian  population  and  others  is 
anticipated.  
There  is  no  data  available  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment.  Biliary  excretion  is  the  major  route  of 
elimination of the drug. Therefore, exposure to padeliporfin is expected to be increased and/or prolonged in 
patients  with  biliary  excretion  impairment  or  cholestasis.  The  lack  of  data  regarding  hepatic  impairment  is 
recognized as missing information (see RMP). Tookad is contraindicated in patients who have been diagnosed 
with cholestasis (see SmPC section 4.3).  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 is also contraindicated 
(see SmPC section 4.3). 
Tookad has no influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, as the procedure includes general 
anaesthesia, patients should not perform complex tasks like driving or using machines until 24 hours after a 
general anaesthetic is employed (see SmPC section 4.7). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional expert consultations 
See discussion on clinical efficacy.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of Tookad VTP has been adequately characterised in the short term and achievement of a 
clinically relevant delay in important toxicities has been shown based on analysis of time with toxicity up to 
48 months, using data available to date from the 5-year follow-up study.  
Adequate recommendations to manage the risks have been included in the SmPC. Furthermore additional risk 
minimisation measures are in place to ensure adequate information to the patients for an informed decision. 
There are uncertainties about the long term safety of Tookad VTP that will be adequately addressed post 
authorisation with a number of post-authorisation studies (see RMP and Annex II). 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further investigate long-term efficacy of Tookad and its 
impact on disease progression including potential impact on the efficacy of subsequent radical therapy in 
patients with low risk prostate cancer as well as further characterise the long term safety of Tookad, the MAH 
should submit the results of a randomised phase 3 study in patients with localised prostate cancer compared 
to active surveillance (7-year follow-up study including in an depth biopsy study) (PCM301 FU5). Submission 
of final study results: 31/12/2020.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that padeliporfin has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers padeliporfin to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Tookad (padeliporfin) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication of Tookad applied by the applicant is for the treatment of adult patients with previously 
untreated, unilateral, low-risk, adenocarcinoma of the prostate with a life expectancy ≥ 10 years and: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Clinical stage T1c or T2a,  
Gleason Score ≤ 6, based on high-resolution biopsy strategies,  
PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL,  
3 positive cancer cores with a maximum cancer core length of 5 mm in any one core or 1 -2 positive 
cancer cores with ≥ 50 % cancer involvement in any one core or a PSA density ≥ 0.15 ng/mL/cm3. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The recommended options for patients with low risk localised prostate cancer are active surveillance or 
radical treatment (prostatectomy or radiotherapy). Studies have shown that for any of these options the case 
specific survival at 10 years was very high. Despite the low risk, progression is observed among patients on 
active surveillance. Studies have defined progression either in terms of increase of the risk level or decision 
to move to radical treatment. In this patient group, survival rate is not a differentiating criterion for the 
choice of treatment and one has to rely on other criteria such as reduction of progression and preservation of 
quality of life to differentiate the relative benefits of the different treatment options. Focal ablative therapies 
as cryotherapy and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) are recommended in European guidelines only 
as alternative therapeutic options for low risk patients who are unfit for surgery or radiotherapy. The aim of 
focal treatment is to delay radical therapy or avoid unnecessary radical therapy thereby avoiding its 
toxicities. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy is a multicentre, randomized, open label Phase 3 study in Europe (Study 
CLIN1001 PCM301) comparing the effect of the Tookad VTP procedure versus active surveillance in men with 
previously untreated low-risk localised prostate cancer.  
Assessment report  
EMA/644309/2017 
Page 135/146 
  
  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In patients with low risk prostate cancer Tookad VTP produced a statistically significant improvement in the 
probability of a negative biopsy at 24 months (49% vs. 13.5%, RR=3.62) compared to active surveillance 
(periodic monitoring of known prostate cancer). Results were consistent in the mITT and PP populations and 
on subgroup analysis of unilateral (RR 3.48 [2.30, 5.24]) and bilateral (4.31 [1.80, 10.32]) disease. 
Sensitivity analysis showed no effect of age, number of positive cores, prostate volume and baseline disease 
status (unilateral/ bilateral) on the outcome (risk ratio in ITT population at 24 months = 3.67 [2.53, 5.33]). 
In just the treated lobe the proportion of patients with negative biopsies at 24 months was 62.6%.  
A post-hoc sensitivity analysis that assumed missing biopsies due to radical therapy to be negative still 
favoured Tookad, although the effect size was smaller (54.9% vs. 40.1%, RR 1.37 [1.11, 1.68] p=0.003). 
The median time to progression based on any one of a list of pre-specified events (>3 cores definitively 
positive for cancer; Gleason primary or secondary pattern ≥4; ≥1 cancer core length > 5 mm; PSA > 10 
ng/mL in 3 consecutive measures; T3 prostate cancer; metastasis; prostate cancer-related death) was twice 
as long in the Tookad as the active surveillance group (28.3 vs. 14.1 months, p<0.001). The proportion of 
subjects who progressed over 24 months in the Tookad group was lower than in the active surveillance group 
(28.2% vs. 58.5%; HR=0.34 [0.25; 0.47]).  
No significant effect of covariates [baseline age, number of cores positive, prostate volume and disease 
status (unilateral/bilateral)] was observed. Occurrence of each individual criterion for progression was 
reduced by Tookad. The results appeared robust in the different populations (mITT and PP), according to 
baseline disease status (uni/ bilateral) and the sensitivity analysis that assumed that all patients who 
withdrew or opted for radical therapy were treatment failures (progression 35.9% vs 69.1%; HR = 0.38 
[0.28, 0.50]).  
By 24 months, 12 (5.8%) subjects in the Tookad VTP group compared to 60 (29.0%) in the active 
surveillance group had undergone radical therapy. The median time to radical therapy was 27 months in the 
active surveillance arm and not reached in the Tookad arm, a statically significant difference (p<0.001).  
The applicant proposed a revised indication for the treatment of unilateral low risk localised prostate cancer in 
adult men with a life expectancy ≥ 10 years (excluding very low risk patients). The population targeted by 
the indication represents 38% of the overall trial population with a good balance of the Tookad arm (80 
patients, 39% of overall trial population) and the Active Surveillance arm (78 patients, 38% of overall trial 
population).  
The risk ratio for negative biopsy at M24 was greater in the indication sub-population than in the overall 
population when considering either only the lobe diagnosed at baseline (RR=4.61 vs. 3.24) or the whole 
gland (RR=4.39 vs. 3.62) 
The hazard ratio for disease progression over 24 months was improved in the indication sub-population 
compared to the overall population when considering either only the lobe diagnosed at baseline (HR=0.11 vs. 
0.17) or the whole gland (RR=0.31 vs. 0.34). 
The absolute reduction in risk of receiving radical therapy was greater in the indication sub-population than in 
the overall population: 31% vs. 26% at M24 (based on full study data) and 29% vs. 25% at M48 (based on 
preliminary follow-up data among ~62% of patients) 
The reduction of time with genitourinary toxicity was increased in the indication sub-population compared to 
the overall population over 24 months and almost equivalent over 48 months, with: 
Assessment report  
EMA/644309/2017 
Page 136/146 
  
  
o  A ratio of 0.85 vs. 0.93 over 24 months for overall time with genitourinary toxicities (erectile 
dysfunction: 1.07 vs. 1.15; urinary incontinence: 0.17 vs. 0.23), with statistical significance 
only for urinary incontinence; 
o  A  ratio  of  0.62  vs.  0.58  over  48  months  (preliminary  follow-up  data)  for  overall  time  with 
genitourinary  toxicities  (erectile  dysfunction:  0.68  vs.  0.63;  urinary  incontinence:  0.37  vs. 
0.36), with statistical significance. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Follow-up time within the study was not sufficient to reliably estimate the median progression-free survival. 
Beyond 2 years the efficacy of Tookad VTP is assessed clinically, with uncertain input from the absolute PSA 
value and no prostate biopsies. Therefore, the additional analysis provided on delay to progression and risk 
of/time to receiving radical therapy should be considered with caution considering these limitations. 
Nevertheless,  proportions  of  patients  with  no  disease  progression  in  the  initially  treated  lobe  were 
substantially  higher  in  the  Tookad  than  in  Active  Surveillance  arm,  with  95%  vs.  55%  of  patients  without 
ipsilateral  disease  progression  at  M15  respectively  and  90%  vs.  42%  at  M27.  When  considering  the  whole 
gland,  the  proportions  for  absence  of  progression  were  lower  with  73%  and  36%  at  M15  for  Tookad  and 
Active Surveillance respectively and 64% and 25% at M27. This analysis confirmed the significant reduction 
in progression of disease and need for radical therapy, as reported previously based on the review of hazard 
ratios  in  Kaplan-Meier  analyses.  This  preliminary  assessment  of  longer  term  benefits  has  to  be  taken  with 
caution and will have to be confirmed in the two PAES studies that will be conducted, study PCM301 FU5 and 
study  CLIN1501  PCM401.  Furthermore,  an  in-depth  biopsy  sub-study  as  part  of  study  PCM301  FU5  is 
expected to provide relevant data beyond 24 months.   
With regards to benefits in terms of reduction of time with toxicity (see also under unfavourable effects 
below), the assessment of time with toxicity was not included as a specific endpoint in the initial study design 
it was not collected after RT. Based on an approach imputing to these patients the toxicity profile reported in 
Study ProtecT post-radical prostatectomy, Tookad led to a positive benefit. However there remain some 
uncertainties due to the imputations. Two large PAES studies will provide relevant data on time with 
genitourinary toxicities to alleviate this uncertainty. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
When given alone, as in the healthy volunteer study, Tookad is very well tolerated. However, there is a risk 
of phototoxicity and, as a result, precautions against exposure to light during the procedure and for a short 
time afterward is necessary. The half-life of Tookad ranges from 1.14-1.70 hours in prostate cancer patients 
and so, unlike other photosensitising agents, these precautions do not have to be in place for more than 48 
hours and this duration provides a very conservative approach given the very short half-life. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644309/2017 
Page 137/146 
  
  
The majority of adverse events were procedure related due insertion of the optical fibres through the 
perineum and light activation of Tookad causing necrosis. The most common all cause adverse events in the 
398 patients treated with the recommended dose of Tookad / light energy across the prostate clinical studies 
were genitourinary, including dysuria (28.4%), erectile dysfunction (25.6%), haematuria (20.6%), perineal 
pain (15.6%) and urinary retention (14.1%). Most events were low grade and resolved in a few days without 
sequelae. About 7% were considered Grade 3 at the recommended dose and light intensity, again 
genitourinary [dysuria (1.3%), haematuria (0.5%), urinary retention (1.0%), prostatitis (0.8%), erectile 
dysfunction (0.8%) and a Grade 3 prostatic abscess].   
There is the additional risk inherent in undergoing a general anaesthetic and there were rare reports of 
bronchospasm, hypersensitivity and ECG changes. Also device related failures were reported, resulting in 
treatment cancellation or defective calibration of the optical light meter and extra-prostatic necrosis. 
Serious TEAEs were reported in 19.8% of patients across the studies under the recommended treatment 
conditions, again mainly genitourinary disorders. These included urinary retention, urethral stenosis, 
haematuria, dysuria, prostatitis, urinary tract infection and orchitis. 
TURP has been added to the list of contraindications for treatment with Tookad (see SmPC section 4.3) since 
one such patient experienced total urinary incontinence, necessitating insertion of an artificial urinary 
sphincter. 
Prostatic symptoms according to the IPSS transiently worsened but were equal or better than baseline by 6 
months.  Erectile function (IIEF-15 scores) showed transient and moderate worsening up to 3 months after 
the procedure that persisted to 12 months but the result at 24 months was comparable to AS. This was due 
to patients in the AS arm undergoing radical therapy.  
Analysis of time with toxicity up to 48 months, using data available to date from the 5-year follow-up study 
were provided. Acknowledging the limitations of this analysis, significantly lower time with erectile 
dysfunction and urinary incontinence was shown for the Tookad arm in the overall population. The estimated 
relative time with toxicity for Tookad vs. AS overall ratio was 0.93 (95% CI= 0.47-1.03); 1.15 (95% CI= 
0.47-1.03) for erectile dysfunction and 0.23 (95% CI= 0.13-0.45) for Urinary Incontinence. The ratio of 
relative time with toxicity in the overall trial population is greater at M48 compared to M24: 0.58 overall 
(95% CI: 0.27-0.64), with 0.63 for ED (95% CI: 0.28-0.69) and 0.36 for UI (95% CI: 0.16-0.47). The 
overall toxicity is slightly reduced and the ED toxicity is slightly increased at M24, but without a statistically 
significant difference. The UI toxicity is substantially reduced with a statistically significant difference. The 
reduction in time with toxicity in the indication population was comparable to the overall trial population. 
In a further analysis without imputation of post-radical therapy toxicities, the overall ratio of time with 
genitourinary toxicities for Tookad vs. Active Surveillance is 2.77 over 24 months and 1.46 over 48 months. 
These results are largely driven by the time with ED toxicity, which is the most prevalent. The ratios for time 
with ED toxicities are 3.85 at M24 and 1.40 at M48, while the ratios for time with UI toxicities are 0.13 at 
M24 and 2.39 at M48. 
The safety profile in the final restricted indication was comparable to that of the overall study population.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long-term follow-up for safety is missing, including the local effect of extra-prostatic necrosis. It remains to 
be seen if later cases of fistula, incontinence or urethral stenosis occur. It is unclear if urinary morbidity will 
be worse in patients with greater baseline voiding difficulties including a history of urinary retention or benign 
prostatic hypertrophy (BPH).  
It is also uncertain whether Tookad VTP adversely influences the ability to later undertake radical therapy, 
either ‘missed opportunity’ through disease progression or due to the PD effect of vascular occlusion. There is 
a concern that associated fibrosis may make surgery more difficult and impair post-operative wound healing 
although  the limited available data does not indicate greater difficulty to perform radical prostatectomy.  
The risk of more difficult radical prostatectomy has been reported in patients who received bilateral VTP (in 
particular nerve sparing radical prostatectomy). By restricting the target indication to patients with unilateral 
disease and a single VTP procedure, this risk has been reduced. 
Although no increase in the risk of metastasis or prostate cancer-related mortality has been detected to date 
based on the Phase II and Phase III follow-up data available to date, additional data will be collected in the 
continued follow-up of PCM301 (PCM301 FU5) and the PAES CLIN1501 PCM401 study to further confirm the 
absence of a meaningful risk. 
Overall, the uncertainties about the long term safety of Tookad VTP will be adequately addressed post 
authorisation with a number of post-authorisation studies (see RMP and Annex II).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Beneficial  effects  for  Tookad  VTP  in  low  risk  prostate  cancer  have  been  shown  in  terms  of  an  increased 
number  of  patients  with  negative  biopsies  at  2  years  and  longer  median  time  to  disease  progression  in 
comparison to monitoring patients with known disease. These are results that are robust and maintained in 
sensitivity  analyses,  including  adjustment  for  baseline  age,  number  of  positive  cores,  prostate  volume  and 
disease status (unilateral/ bilateral).  
The positive benefits described in the overall trial population are confirmed in the target indication sub-
population with significant statistical significance. Importantly, this was shown for each of the benefits 
relevant to the assessment of minimally invasive cancer treatments (EMA/CHMP/703715/2012 Rev. 2 – Dec 
2015), namely: absence of positive biopsy, reduction in progression of disease/need for radical therapy, 
reduction in risk of radical therapy, and reduction in time with genitourinary toxicities. Furthermore, sub-
group analyses have shown that benefits of Tookad vs. Active Surveillance are maximized in the final 
restricted indication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644309/2017 
Page 140/146 
  
  
 
 
Overall, Tookad VTP was shown to deferring progression by median difference of about 14 months compared 
to active surveillance which is considered clinical relevant in the selected patient population of patients with 
low risk prostate cancer (excluding very low risk) wishing to defer radical therapy being fully informed about 
potential risks and uncertainties. The estimated risk of/time to receiving radical therapy (RT), with its 
consequent ADRs, has been shown to be substantially delayed although these analyses have some limitations 
and should be considered with caution. 
Adverse events from Tookad –VTP are mainly local genito-urinary effects. These occurred at a higher 
frequency with VTP compared to AS (e.g. haematuria 28.4 vs. 2.9%; dysuria 27.4 vs. 2.4%, ejaculation 
failure 8.1% vs. 0.5%, erectile dysfunction 37.6% vs. 11.6%). The frequency and severity of long term 
erectile dysfunction post Tookad-VTP remains unclear. An analysis of time with toxicity to 48 months, using 
data available to date from the 5-year follow-up study showed a significantly lower time with erectile 
dysfunction and urinary incontinence for the Tookad arm, probably due to RT avoidance (with the associated 
uncertainties around the decision to proceed with RT). 
The proportion of patients experiencing AEs with Tookad is within the range of incidence observed with 
radical prostate cancer therapies. Retaining potency is a strong motivator for patients to avoid radical 
treatment.    
To address the remaining uncertainties about the long term efficacy and safety of Tookad VTP, two PAES will 
be conducted. The two studies, follow-up of PCM301 (PCM301 FU5) and PAES CLIN1501 PCM401, will further 
investigate long-term efficacy of Tookad and its impact on disease progression including potential impact on 
the efficacy of subsequent radical therapy as well as further characterise the long term safety of Tookad. 
Furthermore the product information and patient and physicians guides will adequately inform about the risks 
and uncertainties of Tookad VTP to allow an informed decision before deciding on starting treatment. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The increased number of patients with negative biopsies at 2 years and the longer median time to disease 
progression observed with Tookad in comparison to monitoring patients with known disease are relevant 
short-term benefits. Furthermore, considering the toxicity of radical therapy, delaying radical therapy by 
median difference of about 14 months compared to active surveillance is considered relevant in patients with 
low risk prostate cancer (excluding very low risk) wishing to defer radical therapy being fully informed about 
potential risks and uncertainties. The uncertainties about long term are considered acceptable given the 
measures in place to adequately inform both physicians and patients and the post authorisation studies to be 
performed. 
Based on data available to date, the restricted use of Tookad in the target indication sub-population 
(unilateral low-risk excluding very low-risk disease), with limitation to a single procedure enables to 
maximize the positive benefits of the treatment, while minimizing the risk of compromising salvage radical 
therapy. Although still preliminary and somewhat uncertain, the longer-term data available to date points to 
maintenance of the benefits with no signal of increased risk.  
Overall, the benefits of Tookad VTP are considered to outweigh the risks in patients with unilateral disease 
and low risk prostate cancer Tookad (excluding very low risk) as defined in section 4.1 of the SmPC.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
There is insufficient information on retreatment of the ipsilateral lobe or sequential treatment of the 
contralateral lobe to determine the efficacy and safety of a second Tookad VTP procedure. Therefore, 
retreatment of the same lobe or sequential treatment of the contralateral lobe of the prostate are not 
recommended (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Tookad is positive. 
The divergent position is appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority decision 
that the risk-benefit balance of Tookad is favourable in the following indication: 
Tookad is indicated as monotherapy for adult patients with previously untreated, unilateral, low-risk, 
adenocarcinoma of the prostate with a life expectancy ≥ 10 years and: 
- 
- 
- 
Clinical stage T1c or T2a,  
Gleason Score ≤ 6, based on high-resolution biopsy strategies,  
PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL,  
3 positive cancer cores with a maximum cancer core length of 5 mm in any one core or 1 -2 positive 
- 
cancer cores with ≥ 50 % cancer involvement in any one core or a PSA density ≥ 0.15 ng/mL/cm3.

5. Appendix 
1. 
Divergent position to the majority recommendation 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the granting of a 
Marketing Authorisation for Tookad. 
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
Based on the currently available data the benefit-risk balance for Tookad is considered to remain 
undetermined. Major uncertainties exist regarding efficacy and safety:  
•  Although a short term benefit in terms of progression of the disease has been shown in study 
PCM301, the clinical relevance remains to be established. A delay in radical surgery as secondary 
endpoint was demonstrated, but clear criteria defining need for radical therapy were lacking (as 
required by EMA guideline, see appendix 4, EMA/CHMP/703715/2012 Rev. 2). Not all patients that 
progressed received radical treatment, meaning that the choice for radical therapy could have been 
biased by the open-label study design. This came at the expense of a relative high incidence of side 
effects, in particular erectile dysfunction. 
• 
• 
The current restricted indication population concerns a post hoc determined subgroup that was not 
identified a priori and replication of the results was not provided (as required by the relevant EMA 
draft guideline, see EMA/CHMP/539146/2013). The data also do not fulfil the criteria that are 
required for one pivotal study (Points to consider on application with meta-analyses or one pivotal 
study CPMP/EWP/2330/99). 
Follow-up data are inadequate. In the context of low-risk prostate cancer, with active surveillance 
being a valid therapeutic option and the existence of effective treatments in case of progression, it is 
the long-term benefits (and risks) that bear more weight in the overall benefit-risk assessment. Too 
limited data were collected in study PCM301 beyond 2 years, especially because prostate biopsies 
were not specified after that time point in the study protocol. As a consequence, the efficacy data are 
not sufficient to support at least non-inferiority in terms of long-term outcome and the long–term 
safety profile is unclear. 
• 
Importantly, there is virtually no data on the potential consequences of post-Tookad local scarring in 
case of disease progression. Thus, the safety and efficacy of subsequent radical therapy is uncertain 
and it still needs to be demonstrated that treatment with Tookad does not compromise the eligibility 
for and the results of subsequent radical therapy. The existence of a small study assessing the 
feasibility of radical surgery following focal therapy is not sufficiently reassuring in this respect 
(Lebdai et al.). 
In conclusion, although the efficacy and safety results in study PCM301 up to 2 years are noted, these are 
considered to be insufficient to compensate for the absence of an established long-term efficacy and safety 
benefit of Tookad. We cannot conclude on a positive (relative) B/R, given the existence of highly effective 
alternative therapy (radical therapy) and active surveillance as a valid alternative patient management 
option, and a risk of compromising long-term outcome is not considered justified. Until more is known, the 
application is considered not approvable.

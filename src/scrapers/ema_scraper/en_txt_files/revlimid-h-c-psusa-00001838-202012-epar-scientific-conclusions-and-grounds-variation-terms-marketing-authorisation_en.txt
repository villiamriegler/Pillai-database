Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for lenalidomide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on tumour lysis syndrome from spontaneous reports in myelodysplastic syndrome 
indication, the PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing lenalidomide should 
be amended accordingly. 
  Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to update a warning on tumour lysis syndrome. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for lenalidomide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing lenalidomide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

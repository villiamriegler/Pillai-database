Introduction 
On  11  March  2013  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Abilify,  in  accordance  with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
Scientific discussion 
Information on the development program  
The  MAH  stated  that  study  “31-05-243:  An  open-label,  rollover  study  for  subjects  completing  Abilify 
(Aripiprazole)  Clinical  Study  31-03-241”  is  part  of  a  clinical  development  program  for  the  paediatric 
treatment  of  schizophrenia.  The  variation  application  consisting  of  the  full  relevant  data  package  is 
expected to be submitted by 2016. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed. 
Conduct of the presented trial is not a requirement of the Paediatric Investigation Plan for aripiprazole 
(EMEA-000235-PIP02-10-M02) and the MAH is not proposing a change to the aripiprazole Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) based upon the study results. 
Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic that is approved via the centralized procedure in the European 
Union (EU) as different pharmaceutical forms in multiple indications (Abilify - EMEA/H/C/000471). 
In the EU aripiprazole is approved for: 
• Treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents (ages 15 years and older) (oral formulations)   
• Treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder in adults (oral formulations) 
• Treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents 
aged 13 years and older (oral formulations) 
•  Prevention  of  a  new  manic  episode  in  adults  who  experienced  predominantly  manic  episodes  and 
whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (oral formulations)  
• Rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with 
manic  episodes  in  bipolar  I  disorder,  when  oral  therapy  is  not  appropriate  (immediate-release  IM 
formulation). 
Aripiprazole is also approved in a variety of indications in other countries. 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study(ies) 
The study used the US commercially available tablet formulation of aripiprazole (2, 5, 10, and 15 mg).

Clinical study 
Description 
Trial  31-05-243  was  an  open-label  rollover  study  designed  to  provide  continued  treatment  with 
aripiprazole at doses ranging from 5 to 30 mg on a compassionate use basis to adolescents (13 to 17 
years  of  age)  or  young  adults  (adolescents  who  reached  18  years  during  the  open-label  parent  trial 
(Trial  31-03-241)  or  previous  double-blind  trial  (Trial  31-03-239)  with  schizophrenia  according  to  the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).  
Methods 
• 
Objective 
The  primary  objective  of  this  trial  was  to  continue  to  provide  aripiprazole  therapy  (5  mg,  10  mg, 
and/or 15 mg tablets) to subjects with schizophrenia who completed the Otsuka-sponsored open-label 
safety and tolerability Trial 31-03-241. 
• 
Study design 
Trial 31-05-243 was an open-label, multicenter, non-comparative rollover trial designed to continue to 
provide aripiprazole on a compassionate use basis in doses ranging from 5 to 30 mg to adolescent (13 
to 17 years of age) and adult (adolescents who reach 18 years during the open-label parent trial [Trial 
31-03-241] or previous double-blind trial [Trial 31-03-239]) male and female subjects with a diagnosis 
of schizophrenia according to DSM-IV. Subjects were required to complete Trial 31-03-241 in order to 
be  eligible  for  the  current  rollover  trial.  Trial  31-03-241  was  a  multicenter,  open-label  trial  that 
provided  up  to  6  months  of  aripiprazole  for  subjects  completing  Trial  31-03-239,  a  randomized, 
comparative trial in which adolescents with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia received double-blind 
treatment  (aripiprazole  or  placebo)  for  6  weeks.  The  DSM-IV  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia  was  as 
confirmed  by  a  Kiddie-Sads-Present  and  Lifetime  Version  interview  initially  conducted  for  eligibility  to 
enroll  in  Trial  31-03-239  (no  additional  confirmatory  diagnostic  evaluations  were  performed  for  Trial 
31-03-241 or the current trial). 
This  trial  was  intended  for  countries  where  aripiprazole  was  not  yet  commercially  available  and/or 
reimbursed. This trial was conducted in Argentina, Bulgaria, Croatia, India, Russian Federation, Serbia 
and Montenegro, South Africa, and Ukraine at 35 trial centers (one additional center was initiated but 
did not enroll subjects). 
Informed  consent  from  the  responsible  adult  (or  potentially  from  the  subject  if  18  years  of  age)  and 
assent  of  the  child  (if  applicable)  were  obtained  and  documented  with  the  opportunity  to  have  all 
questions  answered  prior  to  completion  of  any  trial-related  assessments.  Participation  in  the  rollover 
trial was considered on an individual basis if enrollment criteria were met. Subjects retained the same 
identification  number  throughout  the  open-label  and  double-blind  trials.  The  End  of  Treatment  (EOT) 
evaluations  conducted  at  the  last  visit  of  Trial  31-03-241  served  as  the  baseline  evaluations  for  Trial 
31-05-243. Subjects attended 4 trial visits during the first year of treatment (Months 3, 6, 9, and 12), 
3  visits  during  the  second  year  of  treatment  (Months  15,  18,  and  24),  and  visits  every  6  months 
thereafter  (Months  30,  36,  42,  48,  54,  60,  66,  and  72/early  termination  [ET]).  Subjects  were

contacted by phone at monthly intervals between scheduled visits to assess the occurrence of adverse 
events  (AEs).  Follow-up  phone  calls  were  made  14  ±  2  days  after  the  last  trial  visit  to  assess  the 
status of ongoing AEs and to record the occurrence of new serious AEs (SAEs). Each subject received 
daily aripiprazole at a dose between 5 and 30 mg (maximum allowed dose), as previously established 
in the 31-03-241 safety and tolerability trial; however, modifications to the daily dose could be made 
at the investigator’s discretion, if clinically warranted. 
Subjects  who  enrolled  into  this  trial  were  permitted  to  receive  psychotropic  medications  with  the 
exception  of  other  antipsychotic  agents  and  could  continue  any  concomitant  medications  permitted 
during  Trial  31-03-241.  Safety  data  were  derived  from  AE  reporting,  physical  examinations,  clinical 
laboratory  tests,  urine  pregnancy  tests  (all  female  subjects),  electrocardiograms  (ECG),  and 
measurements of vital signs (including body weight), body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference. 
A  Clinical  Global  Impression  -  Severity  (CGI-S)  scale  was  completed  to  assess  the  continuation  of 
therapeutic  benefit  from  aripiprazole  treatment  as  determined  by  the  investigator.  The  Paediatric 
Quality  of  Life  Enjoyment  and  Satisfaction  Questionnaire  (P-QLES-Q)  was  completed  to  assess  the 
subject’s  perception  of  treatment  benefit  and  was  administered  in  translated  languages,  when 
available. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was administered to assess the risk of 
suicide events and to classify reported suicide events (per Amendment 003 of trial protocol, approved 
28 Oct 2009). 
Aripiprazole  treatment  and  trial  visits continued  until  there  was  a  clinical  or administrative  reason  for 
discontinuation.  Clinical  reasons  included,  but  were  not  limited  to:  voluntary  withdrawal,  treatment 
intolerance, lost to follow-up, and lack of continued benefit per the investigator. Administrative reasons 
included,  but  were  not  limited  to:  commercial  availability  of  and/or  reimbursement  for  aripiprazole, 
termination of aripiprazole development by the sponsor, or the trial reached the planned trial end date 
of  31  Dec  2012.  Once  aripiprazole  became  commercially  available  and/or  reimbursed  in  the  country 
where a subject was participating in the trial, treatment with aripiprazole in Trial 31-05-243 was to be 
discontinued within a reasonable period of time (approximately 1 to 3 months) and the subject was to 
be transitioned to commercially available aripiprazole (Abilify) or another treatment option as deemed 
appropriate by the investigator. For purposes of this trial, subjects who completed the last scheduled 
visit  during  the  treatment  period,  ie,  the  Month  72  visit  (or  the  last  scheduled  visit  within  6  months 
before 31 December 2012), were defined as trial completers. 
• 
Study population /Sample size 
Subjects  were  directly  enrolled  into  the  current  open-label,  non-comparative  rollover  trial  from  the 
previous open-label parent Trial 31-03-241; therefore, no predetermined sample size was calculated. A 
maximum  of  200  subjects  were  expected  to  be  enrolled.  The  number  of  male  and  female  subjects 
enrolled in the trial was balanced (43 males, 42 females). The mean age at trial entry (defined as the 
last  scheduled  visit  in  the  previous  Trial  31-03-241)  was  16.3  years  (range  13  to  18  years).  The 
majority  of  subjects  (66/85,  77.7%)  were  between  13  to  17  years  of  age;  the  remaining  subjects 
(19/85,  22.4%)  were  18  years  of  age  at  trial  entry.  Mean  BMI  was  relatively  similar  between  males 
and  female  subjects  (21.9  and  23.2  kg/m2,  respectively).  The  majority  of  subjects  were  Caucasian 
(49/85,  57.7%);  the  remaining  subjects  were  Asian  (24/85,  28.2%),  ‘Other’  (11/85,  12.9%),  or 
American  Indian  or  Alaska  Native  (1/85,  1.2%).  All  85  enrolled  subjects  were  included  in  the  safety 
analysis. A total of 84/85 subjects (98.8%) were included in the analysis of efficacy and quality of life 
outcome measures.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Outcome Measures 
The following primary safety variables were summarized: 
• 
• 
Frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
Frequency  and  severity  of  treatment-emergent  SAEs  (including  AEs  related  to  clinical 
laboratory abnormalities), 
•  Rates of discontinuation from the trial due to TEAEs. 
Secondary Outcome Measures 
Safety variables 
•  Reported AEs (in addition to the primary safety variables) including summarization of TEAEs by 
causality, severity, and gender, as well as the incidence of deaths 
•  Clinical  laboratory  tests  (including  routine  serum  chemistry,  hematology,  and  urinalysis 
analyses as well as creatine phosphokinase [CPK]; fasting insulin, serum glucose, triglycerides, 
high-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  [HDL-C];  glycosylated  hemoglobin  [HbA1c];  and  serum 
prolactin) 
•  Vital sign parameters (supine and standing blood pressure and  pulse rate, body temperature, 
and  respiration  rate)  and  physical  examination  (including  height  and  weight  for  calculation  of 
BMI and measurement of waist circumference) 
•  ECGs 
• 
Percentage  of  subjects  showing  significant  weight  gain  or  loss  (weight  gain  or  loss  of  7% 
relative to baseline)

Statistical Methods 
Safety Methods: Safety analyses were conducted on the safety dataset, defined as all enrolled subjects 
who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  open-label  trial  medication.  Safety  data  were  summarized  using 
descriptive  statistics,  as  appropriate.  Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  for  this  analysis  were 
defined  as  any  AE  with  onset  after  the  first  dose  of  open-label  aripiprazole  in  Trial  31-05-243  or  any 
event  which  continued  from  baseline  and  became  serious,  was  classified  as  related  to  trial  drug,  or 
resulted  in  death,  discontinuation,  interruption  or  reduction  of  dose.  The  incidences  of  TEAEs  were 
summarized  for  all  TEAEs,  TEAEs  by  severity,  potentially  drug-related  TEAEs,  treatment-emergent 
SAEs, and discontinuations due to TEAEs. Adverse events were examined by gender as well as overall 
incidence. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize original values, change from baseline at each 
scheduled  visit,  and  change  from  baseline  to  the  last  visit  for  the  continuous  safety  variables. 
Incidences  of  metabolic  syndrome  abnormalities  were  summarized  by  visit,  overall  and  by  gender. 
Potentially clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, ECG findings, vital signs, weight, and 
metabolic  syndrome  abnormalities  were  identified  using  prospectively-defined  criteria.  The  age  of 
subjects on the date of the trial visit was used for age-dependent criteria. QT intervals were corrected 
for  heart  rate  (QTc)  based  on  several  formulas,  including  Bazett’s  formula  (QTcB).  Data  collected  on 
the C-SSRS were listed for ongoing subjects as Amendment 003 to the protocol was implemented. 
Efficacy  Methods:  Efficacy  (CGI-S  score)  and  other  outcome  variables  (P-QLES-Q  Total  and  Overall 
scores)  were  summarized  as  change  from  baseline  using  descriptive  statistics.  Subjects  with  missing 
baseline  or  post-baseline  efficacy  and  other  outcome  measurements  were  not  included  in  the 
descriptive  statistics  for  those  variables  or  in  the  descriptive  statistics  for  change  from  baseline  to 
postbaseline. No missing data were imputed for analyses by visit; an observed case (OC) analysis was 
considered  more  appropriate  than  data  imputation.  However,  data  were  summarized  for  the  last 
available  visit  as  an  additional  evaluation  of  these  variables.  No  inferential  statistical  analyses  were 
performed for any efficacy, safety, or other outcome variables. 
Results 
• 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
No  predetermined  sample  size  was  calculated.  A  total  of  85  subjects  who  completed  Trial  31-03-241 
were  actually  enrolled.  The  majority  of  subjects  remained  in  the  trial  for  at  least  24  months:  78.8% 
completed at least 12 months and 51.8% completed at least 24 months of treatment. Fourteen (of 85) 
enrolled  subjects  (16.5%)  completed  at  least  66  months  (5.5  years)  of  treatment  with  open-label 
aripiprazole  in  the  trial;  of  these,  13  (of  85)  subjects  (15.3%)  completed  the  trial.  Overall,  72/85 
subjects  (84.7%)  were  prematurely  discontinued  from  the  trial.  The  two  most  common  reasons  for 
discontinuation were the  subject having met the withdrawal criteria (22/85  subjects, 25.9%) and the 
subject  withdrew  consent  (19/85  subjects,  22.4%).  The  incidence  of  subjects  who  discontinued  from 
the trial due to lack of efficacy was low (3/85 subjects, 3.5%). Seven (of 85) subjects (8.2%)

No primary efficacy variable was defined for this trial. 
Secondary Efficacy: 
Severity of illness was rated at all scheduled trial visits. For CGI-S, a lesser mean score indicates less 
severity of illness. Evaluation of efficacy based on mean change from baseline in CGI-S score indicated 
that efficacy was generally maintained in subjects who had previously received flexible daily doses of 
open-label  aripiprazole  (5  to  30  mg)  in  Trial  31-03-241  and  continued  treatment  with  open-label 
aripiprazole  in  the  current  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  trial.  Mean  scores  for  CGI-S  generally 
decreased  from  baseline  at  each  successive  post-baseline  visit  up  to  the  Month  72  scheduled  visit 
(mean change from baseline ranged from -0.15 at Month 3 [n = 81] to a maximum change of -0.64 at 
Month 66 [n = 14]). Overall, the mean change from baseline (mean = 2.37) to the last visit (mean = 
2.11) for CGI-S was -0.26 [Standard Deviation (SD)=1.07, n = 84]. 
Other Quality of Life Outcomes: 
The  P-QLES-Q  was  completed  by  the  subject  twice  a  year  in  translated  languages  to  assess  the 
subject’s quality of life (higher numeric ratings indicate greater satisfaction). The rating on the P-QLES-
Q Total Score (sum of Items 1 to 14) indicated that on average the subjects’ quality of life, enjoyment, 
and  satisfaction  were  generally  maintained  from  baseline  (51.51)  to  the  last  visit  (53.80)  with 
continued  long-term  treatment  of  open-label  aripiprazole  (mean  change  from  baseline  was  2.29  [n  = 
79]). Mean changes from baseline were minimal at each scheduled visit (range: maximum increase of 
2.49 at Month 18 [n = 55] to a maximum decrease of -4.43 at Month 66 [n = 14]). The rating on the 
P-QLES-Q Overall Score (Item 15) indicated that, on average, the subjects’ overall quality of life was 
maintained  as  fair  to  good  from  baseline  (3.90)  to  the  last  visit  (3.94)  (mean  change  from  baseline 
was 0.04 [n = 82]). Mean changes from baseline on the PQLES- Q Overall Score were also generally 
minimal (range: 0.21 at Month 18 [n = 57] to -0.57 at Month 66 [n = 14]). 
•Safety results 
Safety Results: 
Extent of Exposure: 
All 85 enrolled subjects received at least one dose of trial medication and were included in the safety 
analysis  set.  The  average  daily  dose  of  open-label  aripiprazole  during  the  trial  was  17.1  mg  (ranging 
from  5  to  30  mg).  The  percentage  of  subjects  exposed  to  trial  medication  for  the  longest  possible 
duration (up to 67 months [2030 days]) was 15.3% (13/85 subjects), at an average daily dose of 18.3 
mg.  Cumulative  exposure  to  aripiprazole  over  the  duration  of  the  trial  was  205  subject  years.  This 
exposure is in addition to the 26 to 32 weeks of exposure to aripiprazole received in the previous trials 
(Trial 31-03-239 and Trial 31-03-241).

a Safety population on which all percentages are based. 
b Calculated as the sum of drug end date minus drug start date + 1 for all subjects. 
Overall, 61/85 subjects (71.8%) experienced a total of 223 TEAEs during the trial. The percentage of 
subjects  who  experienced  at  least  one  TEAE  was  relatively  balanced  between  genders  (71.4%  for 
females and 72.1% for males). The majority of all TEAEs were either mild or moderate; 6/85 subjects 
(7.1%) experienced at least one severe TEAE. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (incidence ≥ 5% in the total population) by decreasing frequency 
were headache (13/85 subjects, 15.3%), influenza and increased weight (each 9/85 subjects, 10.6%), 
pyrexia  (8/95  subjects,  9.4%),  vomiting  and  pain (each  7/85  subjects,  8.2%),  nasopharyngitis  (6/85 
subjects,  7.1%),  and  nausea,  decreased  appetite,  somnolence,  anxiety,  and  cough  (each  5/85 
subjects, 5.9%). 
The  most  frequently  reported  potentially  drug-related  TEAEs  (incidence  of  ≥3%  of  subjects  overall) 
were  increased  weight  (8/85  subjects,  9.4%),  somnolence  (4/85  subjects,  4.7%),  and  nausea, 
decreased  appetite,  headache,  and  tremor  (each  3/85  subjects,  3.5%).  One  death,  attributed  to  a 
serious event of bacterial pneumonia, was reported in this trial. The fatal event was considered severe 
and unrelated to trial medication. The subject had received 1546 days of trial medication (30 mg/day 
aripiprazole)  at  onset  of  the  event.  Eleven  (of  85)  subjects  (12.9%)  experienced  at  least  one 
treatment-emergent SAE during the trial. Treatment-emergent SAEs reported in more than one subject 
included suicide attempt (3/85 subjects, 3.5%) and schizophrenia (2/85 subjects, 2.4%). The following 
SAEs  were  reported  by  1  subject  each:  bacterial  pneumonia,  ligament  rupture,  psychomotor 
hyperactivity, aggression, impulsive behaviour, psychotic disorder, and social stay hospitalisation. Six 
of  the  11  subjects  experienced  a  treatment-emergent  SAE  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  trial 
medication. 
Seven (of 85) subjects (8.2%) discontinued trial medication due to at least one TEAE. Suicide attempt 
was  the  only  TEAE  that  led  to  discontinuation  in  more  than  one  subject  (2/85  subjects,  2.4%).  All 
TEAEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  trial  medication  were  categorized  by  the  investigator  as  either 
moderate (schizophrenia and 1 event of suicide attempt) or severe (bacterial pneumonia, aggression, 
psychotic disorder, hypertension, and 1 event of suicide attempt). 
Adverse events of special interest were summarized for the trial.

symptom  (EPS)-related  AE  during  the  trial.  Tremor  and  muscle  rigidity  were  the  only  EPS-
related  AEs  reported  in  more  than  one  subject.  One  EPS-related  AE  was  considered  serious 
(psychomotor  activity).  There  were  no  TEAEs  of  either  tardive  dyskinesia  or  neuroleptic 
malignant  syndrome,  and  there  were  no  seizures,  hyperglycemia/diabetes,  or  orthostatic 
hypotension-related TEAEs reported during the trial. 
•  Suicidality 
Four subjects experienced a suicide-related TEAE, including 3 subjects who reported a suicide 
attempt  and  1  subject  who  experienced  intentional  self-injury  during  the  trial.  All  3  events  of 
suicide  attempt  were  considered  serious;  2  of  these  3  events  led  to  discontinuation  of  trial 
medication  (none  were  considered  related  to  trial  medication).  The  fourth  event  (intentional 
self-injury) was reported as a non-serious TEAE (considered mild and not likely related to trial 
medication). 
•  Other 
Other  TEAEs  of  special  interest  reported  by  at  least  one  subject  included  increased  weight 
(9/85 subjects, 10.6%), decreased appetite (5/85 subjects, 5.9%), increased blood CPK (1/85 
subjects, 1.2%), and abnormal behaviour (1/85 subjects, 1.2%). 
Pregnancy: 
No pregnancies were reported in female subjects enrolled in the trial. One pregnancy was reported for 
the  female  partner  of  male  subject  (the  6-month  follow  up  call  indicated  that  the  baby  was  healthy 
with no known growth deviations). 
Clinical Laboratory Results: 
None  of  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  for  any  of  the  serum  chemistry  laboratory,  hematology,  or 
urinalysis tests were considered to be clinically significant. 
Potentially  clinically  significant  increases  in  total  bilirubin  (defined  as  ≥  2.0  mg/dL  for  ages  13  to  17 
years  and  18  years  and  older)  were  observed  in  7/79  subjects  (8.9%)  and  potentially  clinically 
significant increases in total CPK (defined as > 500 U/L for ages 13 to 17  years; ≥ 3.0 * ULN for 18 
years and older) were observed in 6/79 subjects (7.6%) during the trial. Serum chemistry laboratory 
abnormalities  that  were  reported  as  TEAEs  included  increased  blood  bilirubin  (1  subject),  increased 
blood  CPK  (1  subject),  hyperkalaemia  (1  subject),  and  hypercholesterolaemia,  hyperlipidaemia,  and 
hypertriglyceridaemia  (1  subject).  Potentially  clinically  significant  changes  in  eosinophils  and 
hematocrit (each 5/79 subjects, 6.3%) and hemoglobin (3/79 subjects, 3.8%) were also observed. No 
clinically relevant changes in hematology parameters were observed during long-term treatment with 
aripiprazole. Overall, mean changes from baseline in serum prolactin were relatively minimal and the 
range of mean change was similar between males and females. Three subjects (2 male and 1 female) 
had  a  single  potentially  clinically  significant  elevated  prolactin  value  (defined  as  >  1  X  ULN)  at  some 
point during the trial. The overall incidence of low prolactin levels (where low serum prolactin levels are 
defined  as  <  3  ng/mL  for  females  and  <  2  ng/mL  for  males)  was  35.4%  (28/79  subjects).  The 
incidence  of  low  prolactin  levels  was  greater  in  males  (18/40  subjects,  45.0%)  compared  to  females 
(10/39 subjects, 25.6%). 
Vital Sign Parameters: 
None  of  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  for  any  of  the  vital  sign  parameters  were  considered  to  be 
clinically  significant.  The  most  common  potentially  clinically  significant  vital  sign  abnormalities 
(incidence ≥ 5% of all subjects) included increases in standing systolic blood pressure and supine and 
standing  diastolic  blood  pressure  (each  observed  in  5/84  subjects,  6.0%).  No  clinically  significant 
orthostatic  changes  in  blood  pressure  were  observed.  One  subject  experienced  a  clinically  significant 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/540048/2013

increase  in  blood  pressure  that  was  reported  as  a  severe  TEAE  of  hypertension  (onset  on  Day  1095) 
that led to discontinuation from trial medication. 
Electrocardiogram Evaluation: 
No clinically meaningful changes in any ECG parameters were observed. Nine (of 82) subjects (11.0%) 
experienced  a  potentially  clinically  significant  increase  in  QTcB  during  the  trial;  3  of  these  9  subjects 
also  met  the  criteria  for  potentially  clinically  significant  increase  in  QTcF.  No  QTc  prolongations 
exceeded 500 msec during the trial and none were reported as TEAEs. 
Other Safety Variables 
Although small mean increases from baseline in waist circumference and BMI were observed with each 
postbaseline  visit,  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  from  baseline  were  observed  in  any  of  the 
metabolic syndrome evaluation parameters (for males or females) during the trial. Overall, no clinically 
meaningful  trends  were  observed  in  the  incidence  of  metabolic  syndrome  abnormalities  between 
baseline  and  the  last  visit.  Overall,  37/82  subjects  (45.1%)  had  a  potentially  clinically  significant 
increase in weight (≥ 7% increase compared to baseline) and 4/82 subjects (4.9%) had a potentially 
clinically  significant  decrease  in  weight  (≥  7%  decrease  compared  to  baseline)  at  the last  visit  of  the 
trial.  Nine  (of  85)  subjects  (10.6%)  experienced  weight  gain  that  was  reported  as  a  TEAE  during  the 
trial. Two (of 85) subjects (2.4%) experienced weight loss that was reported as a TEAE. None of the 
TEAEs  related  to  change  in  weight  led  to  discontinuation  from  the  trial.  Overall,  mean  changes  from 
baseline  to  the  last  visit  were  within  0.5  SD  of  the  general  population  for  weight  z-scores  and  within 
1.0 SD of the general population for BMI z-scores; mean changes from baseline at each trial visit for 
both weight and BMI z-scores were negligible. One subject responded “yes” to an actual attempt (non-
suicidal  self-injurious  behaviour)  on  the  suicidal  behaviour  category  of  C-SSRS  at  the  Month  66  visit. 
The subject’s behaviour was reported as a non serious TEAE (preferred term: intentional self-injury) on 
Day 1400. The event was considered mild and not likely related to trial medication. 
Conclusions: 
• 
Long-term administration of open-label aripiprazole (up to  67  months [2030 days]) was well-
tolerated  at  flexible  daily  doses  of  5  to  30  mg  in  adolescent  and  adult  subjects  with 
schizophrenia.  The  average  daily  dose  of  open-label  aripiprazole  administered  during  the  trial 
was  17.1  mg.  Fourteen  (of  85)  enrolled  subjects  (16.5%)  completed  at  least  66  months  (5.5 
years)  of  treatment  with  open-label  aripiprazole.  The  incidence  of  subjects  who  discontinued 
from the trial due to lack of efficacy was low (3.5%) and 8.2% of subjects discontinued from 
the trial due to AEs. 
•  Efficacy was maintained in adolescent or adult subjects with schizophrenia who completed the 
previous open-label safety and tolerability Trial 31-03-241 and continued to receive long-term 
treatment with flexible daily doses of 5 to 30 mg open-label aripiprazole in the current trial, as 
indicated by minimal changes in CGI-S score (range: .0.15 at Month 3 to a maximum change 
of 0.64 at Month 66). Overall, the mean change from baseline to the last visit was 0.26. 
•  Quality  of  life  was  evaluated  by  the  P-QLES-Q  during  long-term  treatment  of  open-label 
aripiprazole. Quality of life, enjoyment, and satisfaction were generally maintained during long-
term treatment as indicated by minimal change on P-QLES-Q Total and Overall Scores for the 
duration  of  the  trial  (mean  changes  from  baseline  to  last  visit  were  2.29  and  0.04, 
respectively). 
• 
Long-term  administration  of  open-label  aripiprazole  was  generally  safe  and  no  new  AEs  of 
concern were identified. Overall, 71.8% of all subjects experienced at least one TEAE, with the 
majority  of  TEAEs  reported  as  mild  or  moderate.  The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs

(incidence ≥5% of all subjects) were headache (15.3%), influenza and increased weight (each 
10.6%), pyrexia (9.4%), vomiting and pain (each 8.2%), nasopharyngitis (7.1%), and nausea, 
decreased  appetite,  somnolence,  anxiety,  and  cough  (each  5.9%).  Eleven  (of  85)  subjects 
(12.9%)  experienced  treatment-emergent  SAEs  during  the  trial,  including  one  death.  The 
death was attributed to bacterial pneumonia and was unrelated to trial medication. Treatment-
emergent  SAEs  reported  by  more  than  one  subject  included  suicide  attempt  (3  subjects)  and 
schizophrenia (reported term: worsening of schizophrenia; 2 subjects). Seven (of 85) subjects 
(8.2%)  discontinued  trial  medication  due  to  a  TEAE;  all  but  one  of  the  TEAEs  that  led  to 
discontinuation (hypertension) was considered serious. 
• 
• 
Ten  (of  85)  subjects  (11.8%)  experienced  treatment-emergent  EPS-related  AEs  during  long-
term  administration  of  aripiprazole  to  adolescents  and  adults  with  schizophrenia.  Tremor  and 
muscle  rigidity  were  the  only  EPS-related  AEs  reported  in  more  than  one  subject.  All  EPS-
related  AEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  with  exception  of  1  severe  event  of 
psychomotor hyperactivity (also considered serious). 
Four  (of  85)  subjects  experienced  a  suicide-related  TEAE,  including  events  of  suicide  attempt 
(3  subjects)  and  intentional  self-injury  (1  subject).  All  3  events  of  suicide  attempt  were 
considered  serious,  and  2  of  these  3  led  to  discontinuation  of  trial  medication.  One  subject 
recorded  a  positive  response  on  the  C-SSRS  (reported  as  the  TEAE  of  intentional  self-injury). 
There were no TEAEs related to seizure or hyperglycemia/diabetes and no individual TEAEs of 
tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or orthostatic hypotension were reported. 
• 
There  were  no  clinically meaningful  changes  from  baseline in serum  chemistry  or  hematology 
clinical laboratory parameters during the trial. Potentially clinically significant changes in serum 
chemistry were limited to increases in total bilirubin (8.9%) and increases in CPK (7.6%). 
•  Mean  changes  from  baseline  in  serum  prolactin  were  relatively  minimal  and  relatively  similar 
between males and females. Three (of 79) subjects (3.8%) experienced a potentially clinically 
significant  increase  in  prolactin;  no  TEAEs  related  to  changes  in  prolactin  were  reported.  The 
overall incidence of low prolactin levels (defined as < 3 ng/mL for females and < 2 ng/mL for 
males)  was  35.4%  (28/79  subjects).  The  incidence  was  greater  in  males  (18/40,  45.0%) 
compared  to  females  (10/39,  25.6%).  The  clinical  relevance  of  these  findings  is  unknown  in 
the paediatric population. 
• 
The  incidence  of  potentially  clinically  significant  vital  sign  abnormalities  was  low  (≤5  subjects 
per  parameter).  No  clinically  significant  orthostatic  changes  in  blood  pressure  were  observed. 
One  subject  experienced  a  severe  TEAE  of  hypertension  that  led  to  discontinuation  from  trial 
medication; the event was considered not related to trial medication. 
•  No  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  QTc  intervals  or  other  ECG  parameters  were  observed 
during  long-term  treatment  with  aripiprazole.  Nine  (of  82)  subjects  (11.0%)  experienced  a 
potentially clinically significant increase in QTcB during the trial. No clinically meaningful trends 
were observed in the incidence of metabolic syndrome abnormalities between baseline and the 
last visit. 
•  Overall, 37/82 subjects (45.1%) had a potentially clinically significant increase in weight (≥7% 
increase compared to baseline) and 4/82 subjects (4.9%) had a potentially clinically significant 
decrease  in  weight  (≥7%  decrease  compared  to  baseline)  at  the  last  visit  of  the  trial.  Mean 
changes from baseline to the last visit for weight and BMI z-scores were within 0.5 and 1.0 SD  
of the general population, respectively, and changes from baseline were negligible.

1. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
Several  aspects  must  be  discussed.  The  study  took  place  outside  western  Europe,  and  only  Bulgaria, 
Croatia, Russian Federation, Serbia and Montenegro and Ukraine were representatives of the European 
population.  In  some  countries,  the  moment  Abilify  was  marketed  in  that  country,  patients  were 
withdrawn from the study – leading to early termination due to sponsor decision, and loss of follow up 
data. It is also known that in most of these countries the availability of other antipsychotics and other 
CNS agents like antidepressants and anxiolytics is limited, seldom mimicking European reality. 
There  were  49  Caucasian  subjects  among  the  85  enrolled  patients,  which  have  been  responding  to 
Abilify  and  tolerating  in  the  previous  trial.  No  table  was  provided  listing  patients  by  age  range,  and 
withdrawals  by  age  range.  Since  the  study  lasted  up  to  5.5  years,  and  that  all  patients  at  18  years 
reached withdrawal criteria, the patients that completed the trial must have been 13 years or younger 
at inclusion. It is understood that this study was produced to reflect the US indication in schizophrenia. 
However, since the indication for schizophrenia in adolescents in Europe starts at 15 years, data should 
also be analyzed taking this aspect into consideration. 
Secondary  efficacy  reflected  the  population  that  was  enrolled  in  this  study,  which  was  composed  of 
responders  that  were  tolerating  Abilify  for  the  past  months.  Since  several  of  the  patients  were 
withdrawn, and data are therefore missing, no further conclusions may be drawn. 
Safety  evaluation  has  evidenced  some  less  expected  results.  Although  EPS  data  did  not  divert  from 
what  is  already  known  in this  population,  weight increase  in  around  10%  of  patients,  was  more  than 
expected  taking 
into  consideration  previous  data 
in  adolescents  with  schizophrenia.  Waist 
circumference  and  BMI  also  increased  during  the  trial,  and  overall  45%  of  the  patients  had  a 
“potentially clinically significant” increase in weight (≥ 7% increase compared to baseline), while only 
5% had a “potentially clinically significant” decrease in weight as compared to baseline. 
Pain  was  also  highly  reported,  with  more  than  8%  of  the  population  experiencing  pain.This  aspect 
should be followed, and consideration to include it in SmPC should be given. 
Around  13%  of  adolescents  had  a  Treatment  Emergent  SAE,  3.5%  of  these  serious  AEs  were  suicide 
attempts. 
Other AEs were within the expected frequencies. Low serum prolactin was 25.6% in female and 45% in 
male  adolescents,  but  this  has  been  reported  previously  and  its  clinical  importance  is  still  unknown. 
Potentially clinically significant increases in total CPK (defined as > 500 U/L for ages 13 to 17 years; ≥ 
3.0 * ULN for 18 years and older) occurred in 7.6% of patients, but in only one was reported as AE. 
Since  these  events  were  rare  and  with  similar  frequencies  as  pyrexia,  this  may  be  interpreted  as  a 
possibly related, particularly associated to viral infections, which are frequent in this age range. 
Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The data presented for the long term study in children and adolescents with schizophrenia do not 
reveal previously unknown events or weaning of efficacy in this aripiprazole responder population. 
However, the frequency of some events should be further discussed and detailed in the EU relevant 
age group (15-18 years), such as weight gain and suicidality. This discussion should also consider the 
need to update RMP for these aspects. 
As  for  previous  studies,  the  frequency  of  low  prolactinaemia  should  be  appended  to  section  4.8  of 
SmPC, such as:  
“In the paediatric (13-17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole exposure of 5 to 30 mg up

to 72 months, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (<2 ng/ml) was 
25.6% and 45.0%%, respectively.” 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled  
No regulatory action required 
  Not fulfilled: 
Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  provide  a  table  listing  separated  by  age  range  at 
baseline  12-14  years  and  15-18  years,  detailing  withdrawals  within  each  group.  MAH  should  also 
further  discuss  weight  gain  and  suicidality  according  to  the  EU  relevant  age  range  and  their 
progression with treatment duration. 
Additional clarifications requested 
Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  provide  a  table  listing  separated  by  age  range  at 
baseline  12-14  years  and  15-18  years,  detailing  withdrawals  within  each  group.  MAH  should  also 
further  discuss  weight  gain  and  suicidality  according  to  the  EU  relevant  age  range  and  their 
progression with treatment duration. 
The timetable as proposed by the Rapporteur is as follows:

Rapporteur’s assessment of MAH responses to RSI 
Question 1: 
Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  provide  a  table  listing  separated  by  age  range  at 
baseline 12-14 years and 15-18 years, detailing withdrawals within each group. 
RESPONSE: 
Study  31-05-243:  An  open-label,  multinational,  non-comparative  rollover  trial  designed  to  as  a 
continuation  to  provide  aripiprazole  on  a  compassionate  use  basis  to  adolescents  and  adults  with 
schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder only for patients who complete Study 31-03-241 and 31-03-239. 
Patients  rolled-over  to  the  study  in  2006-2007  in  8  countries  where  aripiprazole  was  not  marketed 
and/or  reimbursed  at  the  time  of  roll-over  (Argentina,  Bulgaria,  Croatia,  India,  Russian  Federation, 
Serbia  and  Montenegro,  South  Africa,  and  Ukraine).  The  study  was  designed  to  provide  medication 
access  to  patients  who  participated  in  one  of  the  parent-studies  trial  31-03-241  or  31-03-239  and 
seemed  to  benefit  from  the  treatment.  The  study  didn’t  have  a  definite  endpoint  in  terms  of  a  set 
duration  of  exposure,  however,  the  longest  exposure  was  72  months  based  on  the  commercial 
availability  of  aripiprazole  in  a  particular  country.  Patients  in  each  country  were  discontinued  as 
commercial  supply  became  available  in  that  country.  Over  time  a  number  of  countries  (Argentina, 
Russia, South Africa, Bulgaria) got discontinued all of their remaining patients due to the availability of 
Aripiprazole  locally  while  some  patients  in  other  countries  continued  the  study  due  to  the  lack  of 
medication access until it reached the planned trial definite end date in 2012. Noteworthy is that most 
of  the  31-05-243  patients  were  aged  13-17  years  old  at  the  time  of  roll-over,  however,  19  patients

reached 18 years of age during the parent study (31-03-241 or 31-03-239) and remained eligible for 
and rolled over into the 31-05-243 study. The exposure of patients on study 31-05-243 varied from <1 
months to 72 months therefore the reviewer needs to take into consideration that 46% of the patients 
became adults (19-23 years old) by the time of study discontinuation (see Table 3). 
As  noted  before,  patients  got  discontinued  in  a  participating  country  once  aripiprazole  became  locally 
commercially  available  therefore  this  needs  to  be  taken  to  account  during  the  evaluation  of 
withdrawals. Overall, 72/85 subjects (84.7%) discontinued from the trial. The 2 most common reasons 
for  discontinuation  were  the  subject  having  met  the  withdrawal  criteria  (22/85  subjects,  25.9%)  and 
the subject withdrawing consent (19/85 subjects, 22.4%). A manual review of the by-subject listing of 
reasons for discontinuation indicated that 20 of the 72 subjects [27.8%] who discontinued overall were 
discontinued  due  to  aripiprazole  having  become  commercially  available  in  the  country  where  the 
subject  was  participating  during  the  course  of  the  trial.  The  incidence  of  subjects  who  discontinued 
from  the  trial  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  was  low  (3/85  subjects,  3.5%).  Seven  (of  85)  subjects  (8.2%) 
discontinued from the trial due to AEs. 
The  12-14  years  old  group  consist  of  9  patients  aged  13-14  years  at  baseline  (no  patient  was  below 
13) and 76 patients were 15-18 years old at baseline when entering study 31-05-243.

Table 3 describes the ages of patients at the time of their completion or termination of the study and it 
shows  that  39  patients  from  the  85  (  46%)  were  over  18  years  old  at  the  time  of  the  study 
discontinuation. 
Table 3 Descriptive Statistics for Age at Completion/Termination by Age at Baseline: 
Nine patients (11%) from the group of 15-18 years old group participated in the study until its closure. 
A  total  of  20  (26.3%)  patients  had  to  discontinued  due  to  the  commercial  availability  of  aripiprazole 
(sponsor  discontinued  study  and  subject  met  withdrawal  criteria).  For  an  average  open-label  global 
study for adolescent patients with the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and/or schizophrenia the expected 
discontinuation date is 60% for 2 years while in study 31-03-243 58% of the patients discontinued for 
all  reasons  (with  the  exception  of  due  to  the  drug  availability  in  the  country)  which  is  a  very  high 
retention rate over a 5.5 years exposure. 
MAH  provided  the  tables  of  discontinuations  as  requested  by  the  CHMP,  however,  MAH  also  wants  to 
point out that the design of the study doesn’t allow to observe the natural discontinuation of patients 
20  (26.3%)  who  discontinued  the  study  due  to  the  commercial  availability  of  aripiprazole  in  the 
country of participation. The study also has an unusually long exposure (up to 72 months) and during 
this time 46% of the patients became 18-23 years old. 
Rapporteur comments: 
Nine out of the 85 patients enrolled were aged 13-14 years at baseline (no patient was below 13). On 
the  other  hand  19  out  of  85  were  also  already  adults  by  the  time  of  inclusion  on  study  31-05-243, 
since they reached adulthood in the parent study but were nevertheless eligible for inclusion in 31-05-
243. Thus 55 patients were 15-18 years old at baseline when entering study 31-05-243; Nevertheless 
patients  between  13  and  14  at  baseline  eventually  reached  15  years  old  in  less  than  2  years,  and 
therefore  most  conclusions  of  the  overall  population  remain  valid  for  the  15-18  YO  population. 
Notwithstanding the above, a separate analysis of adolescents 15 through 18 was provided. 
Withdrawal  rate  and  causes  of  withdrawal  were  not  significantly  different.  In  the  elder  group,  lack  of 
compliance  with  birth  control  was  considered  a  reason  to  discontinue  by  the  investigator,  but  this  is 
considered normal. 
Issue solved. 
Question 2 
MAH should also further discuss weight gain and suicidality according to the EU relevant age range and 
their progression with treatment duration.

RESPONSE 
Evaluation of weight 
31  patients  who  were  within  the  EU  relevant  age  range,  i.e.  15-18  years  old  at  baseline,  had 
potentially clinically relevant weight gain depending on an individual’s change in height (or not) during 
that  time  period,  i.e.  more  than  7%  weight  from  baseline  to  the  last  visit  with  exposures  up  to  5.5 
years. Table 4 shows the mean weight change from baseline and Table 5 the Mean BMI change from 
baseline for 15-18 years old patients at baseline. 
Table 4 Mean Weight Change From Baseline for 15-18 Years Old Patients: 
Table 5 BMI - Mean Change From Baseline in 15-18 years old: 
The  mean  weight  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  increases  over  the  5.5  years  exposure  time  as 
could  be  expected  in  a  growing  adolescent  and  young  adult  population.  The  mean  change  of  BMI  is 
below  1  until  the  24  months  visit,  1-2  during  24-36  months,  2-3  during  36-60  months  and  ~3  at  72 
months. The mean BMI at entry was 22.44 (n=76) and even at Month 72 BMI is 25.63 which is above 
25, which is considered to be the upper limit of the normal range in the remaining (n=9) patients. It 
should be noted that the number of patients decreased over time as many patients had to discontinue 
from  the  trial  as  aripiprazole  became  commercially  available  in  their  countries.  Therefore,  data  on 
weight gain and BMI at the late stage of the trial were only representative of an extremely low number 
of patients and the data are hard to interpret.

Due  to  the  length  of  the  trial  and  the  natural  growth  of  patients  the  weight  Z  scores  are  the  most 
informative  about  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  weight  gain.  Weight  z-score  is  the  deviation  of  a 
patient’s weight from the mean weight of the reference population divided by the SD for the reference 
population. Weight z-score describes how similar a patient is to the population with the same age and 
the  same  gender  by  measuring  the  number  of  SDs  from  the  expected  weight,  ie,  how  far  away  the 
patient’s weight is from the population’s mean weight. 
Mean changes from baseline for weight z-scores within 0.5 SD of the general population is considered 
within normal limits for this population 
The  mean  change  of  weight  Z  score  shown  in  Table  4  varies  between  -0.22  to  0.12  SD  which  are 
clinically  not  significant  except  at  Months  42  when  the  weight  Z  score  is  0.53  SD.  However  at  that 
point there are only 2 patients left in the group. Overall it could be concluded that the vast majority of 
study  patients  didn’t  show  clinically  significant  shift  from  the  expected  age  and  gender  appropriate 
weight trajectories. 
Table  7  represents  the  shift  of  weight  from  baseline  to  every  6  months  period  of  exposure  up  to  72 
months  between  the  following  weight  percentile  categories:  <  25%,  25  -  <50%,  50  -  <75%,  75  - 
<85%,  85  -  <95%,  >=95%.  Due  to  the  high  rate  of  dropout  the  interpretation  of  data  is  difficult, 
therefore, we suggest to restrict the interpretation of data up to 24 months while the subject retention 
rate remains above 51%. We could observe that patients even with the longest exposures didn’t tend 
to  became  obese,  but  there  are  too  many  patient  discontinuations  to  make  meaningful  conclusions. 
Also  the  shift  from  baseline  to  last  visit  could  be  also  informative  and  doesn’t  show  a  tendency  for 
aripiprazole treated patients to become obese during treatment.

Overall, 37/82 subjects (45.1%) had a potentially clinically significant increase in weight (7% increase 
compared  to  baseline)  and  4/82  subjects  (4.9%)  had  a  potentially  clinically  significant  decrease  in 
weight  (7% decrease  compared  to  baseline)  at  the  last visit of  the  trial. Overall, mean  changes  from 
baseline  to  the  last  visit  for  weight  z-scores  were  within  0.53  of  the  general  population  and  changes 
from baseline were negligible. 
Evaluation of suicidal cases 
Four  (of  85)  subjects  experienced  a  suicide-related  TEAE,  including  events  of  suicide  attempt  (3 
subjects)  and  intentional  self-injury  (1  subject).  All  3  events  of  suicide  attempt  were  considered 
serious,  and  2  of  these  3  led  to  discontinuation  of  trial  medication.  One  subject  recorded  a  positive 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

response on the C-SSRS (reported as TEAE of intentional self-injury). One patient was 21 years old at 
the time of the event of self-injurious behaviour around 3 years after study entry and after resolution 
of the event he continued the study for approximately two more years. One patient was over 18 years 
old at the time of the suicidal attempt and two patients were 15 years old. The study exposure in study 
31-03-243 is listed in Table 8, however, patients were rolled over from a parent study where they were 
also exposed to aripiprazole. Three of the events assessed by PI as not related to study drug and one 
as  probably  not  related  to  study  drug.  Two  of  the events  occurred  around  a  year  or  more  during  the 
study exposure what would be also atypical for drug induced suicidal events. 
Table 8 Listing of Adverse Events Related to Suicidal Ideation/Suicide: 
Subject 05243-152-2065 
Subject 05243-152-2065, a 17 year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with schizophrenia on December 6, 
2004  began  receiving  aripiprazole  20  mg  on  Study  Day  1/  23-Nov-2006.  The  subject  was  enrolled  in 
an open-label, rollover study for subjects with schizophrenia completing aripiprazole clinical study 31-
03-241.  Medical  history 
included 
intraventricular  conduction  defect, 
left  cardiac  circumflex 
hypertrophy,  mild  unstable  hypertension,  obesity,  elevated 
insulin 
levels,  and  herpangina. 
Approximately at Month 50 (Day 1400), the subject experienced self-injurious behaviour that reported 
ending the same day. The subject was taking 20 mg of study medication at the event onset. No action 
was  taken  with  the  study  medication  at  the  time  of  the  adverse  event.  Per  the  Children’s  Depression 
Rating Scale – Revised (CDRS-R) assessment for suicidal ideation at Screening in the parent study 31-
03-239,  the  subject  had  thoughts  about  suicide,  especially  when  angry.  No  adverse  events  were 
ongoing at the time of the self-harm behaviour event. No concomitant medications were taken within 
14 days prior to the self-harm behaviour event. The subject completed the 31-05-243 study at Month 
72  (Day  2030).  There  was  no  action  taken  with  the  study  medication  in  regards  to  the  event.  No 
concomitant  medications  were  taken  within  14  days  prior  to  the  event.  There  were  no  clinically 
significant  laboratory  tests  relevant  to  the  event.  The  investigator  assessed  the  event  as  mild  in 
severity and not likely related to the study medication. The sponsor assessed the event as unrelated to 
the study medication. 
Subject 05243-360-3063 
Subject  05243-360-3063,  a  17  year-old  Asian  male  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia  on  December  1, 
2004 began receiving aripiprazole 20 mg on Study Day 1/ 22-Jan-2007. The subject was enrolled in an 
open-label, rollover study for subjects with schizophrenia completing aripiprazole clinical study 31-03-
241. Medical history included mitral valve prolapse - AML Grade 1". 
On Study Day 327/ 14-Dec-2007, the subject was removed from the study by the investigator due to 
protocol non-compliance. On Study Day 339/ 26-Dec-2007, 12 days after discontinuation of the study 
medication, the subject experienced a serious event of suicide attempt. The subject had a quarrel with

his  wife  over  a  trivial  issue  and  consumed  an  unknown  amount  of  unidentifiable  tablets  in  an 
attempted  suicide.  The  subject  was  immediately  taken  to  the  hospital  for  further  treatment  and 
evaluation. On Study Day 341/ 28-Dec-2007, the event resolved and the subject was discharged from 
the hospital in stable condition. There was no action taken with the study medication in regards to the 
event  as  it  had  been  discontinued  prior  to  event  onset.  The  investigator  assessed  the  event  to  be 
moderate  in  severity  and  unrelated  to  the  study  medication.  The  sponsor  assessed  the  event  as 
unrelated to the study medication. No concomitant medications were taken within 14 days prior to the 
event. There were no clinically significant laboratory tests relevant to the event. 
Subject 05243-362-3035 
Subject  05243-362-3035,  a  15  year-old  Asian  female  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia  in  2004  began 
receiving aripiprazole 10 mg on Study Day 1/ 30-Nov-2006. The subject was enrolled in an open-label, 
rollover study for subjects with schizophrenia completing aripiprazole clinical study 31-03-241. Medical 
history included increased glucose level and increased insulin level. 
On  Study  Day  78/  15-Feb-2007,  the  subject  experienced  a  serious  event  of  suicide  attempt.  The 
subject attempted to commit suicide by trying to jump off a bridge near her home. The subject climbed 
on  the  wall  of  a  bridge  and  was  about  to  jump  when  a  bystander  stopped  her.  The  subject  was 
immediately  taken  to  the  investigator  site  for  further  evaluation  and  treatment.  The  subject  was 
treated with oral chlorpromazine, fluoxetine, and risperidone and responded well. The study medication 
was discontinued due to the event and the last dose was taken on Study. 
Day  80/  17-Feb-2007.  The  subject  was  taking  20  mg  of  study  medication  daily  at  the  event  onset. 
Concomitant  medications  taken  within  14  days  prior  to  the  event  included  alprazolam,  amitriptyline, 
and  sertraline.  There  were  no  clinically  significant  laboratory  tests  relevant  to  the  event.  The 
investigator  assessed  the  event  to  be  moderate  in  severity  and  not  likely  related  to  the  study 
medication. The sponsor assessed the event as not likely related to the study medication. 
Subject 05243-701-3041 
Subject  05243-701-3041,  a  15  year-old  Hispanic/Latino  female  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia  in 
December  2005  began  receiving  aripiprazole  30  mg  on  Study  Day  1/  14-Dec-2006.  The  subject  was 
enrolled in an open-label, rollover study for subjects with schizophrenia completing aripiprazole clinical 
study 31-03-241. The subject has no known medical history. 
On  Study  Day  26/  08-Jan-2007,  the  subject  experienced  a  serious  event  of  suicide  attempt.  The 
subject reportedly ingested an unknown amount of aripiprazole tablets and 4 tablets of estralazine (10 
mg).  The  subject  was  taken  to  the  hospital  for  further  evaluation  and  treatment.  The  subject  was 
treated with oral lithium and responded well. 
On the same day Study Day 26/ 08-Jan-2007, the event resolved and the subject was discharged from 
the hospital in stable condition. The study medication was discontinued due to the event and the last 
dose was taken on Study Day 25/ 07-Jan-2007. The subject was receiving 30 mg of aripiprazole at the 
time  of  event  onset.  Concomitant  medications  taken  within  14  days  prior  to  the  event  included 
clonazepam. There were no clinically significant laboratory tests relevant to the event. The investigator 
assessed  the  event  to  be  severe  in  severity  and  unrelated  to  the  study  medication.  The  sponsor 
assessed the event as not likely related to the study medication. 
Conclusion on Question 1 + Question 2 
Study  31-05-243  was  a  medication  access  study  of  aripiprazole  on  a  compassionate  use  basis  to 
adolescents and adults with schizophrenia after the completion of study 31-03-241 or 31-03-239 up to 
72 months or until aripiprazole became available in the country of participation. As a result of this, 20

patients  of  85  (26.3%)  got  discontinued  due  to  the  local  commercial  availability  of  aripiprazole.  The 
artificial  discontinuation  of  patients  due  to  the  local  commercial  availability  makes  it  very  difficult  to 
interpret the patient discontinuations. The long-term weight changes also hard to interpret due to the 
low number of patients after Months 24 visit. Based on the explanation provided above MAH suggests 
a cautious interpretation of data beyond Month 24 for this uncontrolled compassionate use study. 
Rapporteur comments: 
Weight gain 
It  is  agreed  that  weight  gain  cannot  be  assessed  per  se  because  adolescents  at  this  age  are  also 
growing,  and  weight  gain  is  expected.  Therefore  the  BMI  change  is  much  more  important.  It  should 
also be mentioned that schizophrenic patients frequently have lower BMI than the average adolescent 
population, and that BMI in adolescents is usually also lower than in adults. Therefore the readings on 
BMI  should  be  viewed  cautiously.  To  counterbalance  this  -  as  discussed  above  -  half  of  enrolled 
subjects had reached adulthood when terminating the study. 
Whilst  on  an  average  and  median  basis  the  BMI  increase  was  not  considered  significant,  for  an 
increase of 3 points in BMI may be acceptable when reaching adulthood and with disease control, the 
patients  that  were  on  the  higher  limit  and  have  increased  from  4.6  points  on  Mth  18  until  8.7  BMI 
points on Mth 36, have surely increased weight with clinical significance. This is also confirmed by the 
net weight increase up to 28.3 Kg also on Mth 36. The mean change of weight Z score, which is usually 
useful  to  follow  the  progression  of  weight  increase,  does  not  help  due  to  the  low  number  of  patients 
and the drop out rate. 
The  weight  increase  has  been  described  in  the  SmPC  for  adolescents.  Although  it  has  not  been  so 
strikingly  expressed  for  schizophrenia  as  it  has  been  for  bipolar  disorder  type  1,  the  fact  is  that  the 
robustness  of  the  data  presented  now  is  lower  than  the  data  presented  for  BD.  Therefore  we  do  not 
propose a change to SmPC. 
Suicidality 
There  were  4  suicidal  related  events.  One  was  a  self-injury  behaviour  lasting  one  day,  and  the  other 
three were suicidal attempts: two with medication and one aborted suicide (jumping off a bridge). Two 
of them were considered not likely related to study drug by the investigator and were downgraded to 
not  related  by  the  sponsor;  one  was  considered  not  related  by  the  investigator  and  was  upgraded  to 
not likely related by the sponsor; the most problematic episode (Subject 05243-362-3035, jumping off 
a  bridge)  was  considered  by  the  investigator  as  moderate  in  severity,  and  not  likely  related  to  the 
study  medication  -  the  sponsor  assessed  the  event  as  not  likely  related  to  the  study  medication. 
Analysis of the reported event does not seem as benign as it was described and rated. 
Suicidality  is  already  expressed  in  SmPC,  and  has  been  reinforced  with  variation  II-84.  The  data 
presented  now  consubstantiates  the  last  proposed  wording  on  suicidality  in  section  4.4:  “There  are 
insufficient  paediatric  data  to  evaluate  this  relative  risk  in  younger  patients  (below  18 years  of  age), 
but there is evidence that the risk of suicide persists beyond the first 4 weeks of treatment for atypical 
antipsychotics, including aripiprazole.” Therefore no further comments are considered. 
Issue solved. 
Question 3 
The  data  presented  for  the  long  term  study  in  children  and  adolescents  with  schizophrenia  do  not 
reveal  previously  unknown  events  or  weaning  of  efficacy  in  this  aripiprazole  responder  population.

However,  the  frequency  of  some  events  should  be  further  discussed  and  detailed  in  the  EU  relevant 
age group (15-18 years), such as weight gain and suicidality. This discussion should also consider the 
need to update RMP for these aspects. 
RESPONSE 
The potential risks of Suicide related events and Weight gain are adequately described in the current 
RMP. As discussed in the latest RMP update (V 8.0) submitted on 06 May 2013, the risk minimization 
measures include a description of the potential risks of Suicide related events and Weight gain in the 
Warnings  &  Precautions,  section  4.4  and  Undesirable  effects,  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  MAH  believes 
that the description of these events is adequate and there is no need for a further update to the RMP. 
Rapporteur comments: 
Agreed. Please see comments from questions 1 and 2 above. 
Issue solved. 
Question 4 
As  for  previous  studies,  the  frequency  of  low  prolactinaemia  should  be  appended  to  section  4.8  of 
SmPC, such as: 
“In the paediatric (13-17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole exposure of 5 to 30 mg up 
to 72 months, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (<2 ng/ml) was 
25.6% and 45.0%, respectively.” 
RESPONSE 
The current SmPC, section 4.8, provides the following information based on placebo-controlled trials: 
"Schizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older 
[...] 
In  the  pooled  adolescent  schizophrenia  population  (13-17  years)  with  exposure  up  to  2  years, 
incidence  of  low  serum  prolactin  levels  in  females  (<3  ng/ml)  and  males  (<2  ng/ml)  was  29.5%  and 
48.3%, respectively." 
MAH would like to caution with the interpretation of low prolactin levels up to 72 months from the roll-
over  study  31-05-243  due  to  the  very  low  number  of  patients  represented  at  that  time.  Only  13 
patients  out  of  85,  which  represents  the  14%  of  the  patients  reached  the  Months  72  study  visit.  The 
lack  of  control  group  adds  another  layer  of  difficultly  to  the  interpretation  of  prolactin  data  in  this 
study. 
Overall Conclusion 
Long-term  administration  of  open-label  aripiprazole  was  generally  safe  and  no  new  AEs  of  concern 
were  identified.  The  study  data  is  commensurate  with  the  aripiprazole  data  already  described  in  the 
SmPC and the description of suicidality and weight-gain is adequately addressed in the current RMP.

The  study  constraints  are  understood,  but  do  not  significantly  diverge  from  other  longterm  follow  up 
studies.  This  data  also  goes  along  with  the  previous  statement  in  the  SmPC,  but  clearly  extends  the 
impact from 2 to 5 years, with a similar (if not higher) rate of exposed patients. Therefore we consider 
that  appending  the  proposed  sentence  to  SmPC  is  valid.  Another  argument  that  justifies  the  new 
sentence  is  the  fact  that  hypoprolactinaemia  lasting  for  5  years  in  this  population  will  transport  this 
effect  into  early  adulthood.  There  is  a  biological  plausibility  that a  lower  prolactinaemia  may  increase 
fertility in these patients, and this aspect should be taken into consideration when planning treatment 
for schizophrenic patients. 
The proposed sentence to be appended on SmPC is still considered to be needed. 
Updated Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
The data presented with the stratification of ages at study entrance in the EU relevant age group (15 - 
18 years) in adolescents with schizophrenia did not reveal a different pattern of events or weaning of 
efficacy from the overall results. Drop out rates, weight gain and suicidality did not behave differently. 
The response to the proposal of a new sentence on low prolactinaemia levels however, is not agreed 
upon. Unlike the MAH, the importance of a new sentence is considered significant as to be appended to 
SmPC. Fertility and unexpected pregnancies are already dealt with in RMP, and as for the other aspects 
(weight gain, suicidality) there is no need to update RMP for these aspects. 
In conclusion, the frequency of low prolactinaemia should be appended to section 4.8 of SmPC: 
“In the adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole exposure of 5 to 30 mg up 
to 72 months, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (<2 ng/ml) was 
25.6% and 45.0%%, respectively.”

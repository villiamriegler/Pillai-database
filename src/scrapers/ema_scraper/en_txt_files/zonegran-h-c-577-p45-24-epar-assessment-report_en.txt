The current SPC of Zonegran contains no other information than that the safety and efficacy of Zonegran 
in children and adolescents below the 18 years of age has not been established and therefore is its use in 
this age category is not  recommended. 
The  majority  of  the  studies  cited  above  included  subjects  in  the  age  range  from  12-18  years  of  age  i.e. 
studies  720-02385-96  (1),  720-02385-96-EXT  (2),  ZNS-401  (5),  ZNS-501  (7)  and  study  ZNS-502  (8). 
Also in the study in neuropathic pain (ZNS-503) the age range was 12-65 years. It is not clear how many 
of the patients in these studies were between 12-18 years of age, which dose they used and which adverse 
events were observed. This might provide useful safety information that might be included in the SPC for 
prescriber if zonegran is used in this age group. Therefore the MAH should either provide an integrated 
safety  analysis  of  these  studies  for  this  age  category  or  given  a  justification  of  its  absence.  Study 
AN46046-225 concerned a PK study in 33 subjects between 5-15 years of age. Twenty-one subjects were 
between  5-11  years  of  age  and  12  subjects  were  12-15  years  of  age.  Each  subject  was  titrated  to  a 
maximum  tolerated  dose  during  a  period  of  approximately  7  weeks  starting  at  1  mg/kg/day  which  was 
gradually  increasing  up  to  12  mg/kg/day  or  a  maximum  of  600 mg/day.  This  also  may  be  useful 
information that could be mentioned in section 5.1 of the SPC.  
Study AN46046-226 was the open label extension of study of AN46046-225. In subjects aged 5-11 years, 
the daily dose ranged from 9.0 mg/kg/day to 14.6 mg/kg/day, and in subjects aged 12-18 years, it ranged 
from 6.4 mg/kg/day to 10.1 mg/kg/day.  
It appears that an increase in seizure frequency was observed which is rather unexpected i.e. at the initial 
visit, subjects aged 5-11 years had a median seizure frequency on 30 seizures per month, compared with 2 
seizures per month in subjects aged 12-18 years. At the final visit, subjects aged 5-11 years had a median 
seizure frequency of 40 seizures per month, compared with 4 seizures per month in subjects aged 12-18 
years. This requests an explanation. In addition 10 non fatal Saes were reported in 5 subjects (four aged 5 
– 11 years and one aged 12 – 18 years). Two of these, namely, encephalopathy and grand mal convulsion 
were  considered  by  the  investigators  to  be  related  to  zonisamide  and  both  events  resolved  following  a 
Zonegran

reduction  in  the  zonisamide  dosage.  Point  is  that  as  with  other  AEDs  a  proportion  of  patients  are 
worsening instead of an improving in seizure frequency. . This should be mentioned in the SPC.  
CHMP CONCLUSIONS: 
•  Following assessment of these studies, overall, the conclusions of the MAH are endorsed 
as far as efficacy is concerned. 
For safety an integrated safety analysis is expected for the age category of 12-18 years of 
age i.e. for the studies where subjects were included from 12 years of age the safety data 
should be integrated unless the company can justify the absence of such integrated safety 
analysis.  
•  Following assessment of studies 720-02385-96, 720-02385-96EXT, ZNS-401, ZNS-501 
and ZNS-503, the adverse event of headache should be added to the product information 
of Zonegran and the MAH is requested to submit a Type II variation to do so. 
•  Following assessment of studies 720-02385-96 and 720-02385-96EXT, the adverse event 
of rhinitis should be added to the product information of Zonegran and the MAH is 
requested to submit a Type II variation to do so. 
•  Study AN46046-225 concerned a PK study in 33 subjects between 5-15 years of age. Twenty-one 
subjects were between 5-11 years of age and 12 subjects were 12-15 years of age. Each subject 
was titrated to a maximum tolerated dose during a period of approximately 7 weeks starting at 1 
mg/kg/day which was gradually increasing up to 12 mg/kg/day or a maximum of 600 mg/day. In 
the open label extension study (AN46046-226) for subjects aged 5-11 years, the daily dose ranged 
from 9.0 mg/kg/day to 14.6 mg/kg /day and for subjects aged 12-18 years from 6.4 mg/kg/day to 
10.1 mg/kg/day. This may be useful information that could be mentioned in section 5.1 of the SPC 
whereas the PK data may be mentioned in 5.2. 
It  appears  that  an  increase  in  seizure  frequency  was  observed  in  study  AN46046-226  which  is 
rather unexpected. An explanation is requested. 
Further an increase in seizure frequency was observed in a proportion of patients in the studies. 
This is not unexpected in epilepsy studies. However this should be mentioned in the SPC.  
• 
 These studies are mainly small and are open label with no placebo or active comparator 
arms and so results should be interpreted with caution. 
•  None of these 8 studies discussed in this Assessment Report have any data on the long 
term use of zonisamide in the paediatric population, nor on the effect of zonisamide on the 
growth and development of children, nor on the effect of zonisamide on puberty. 
Further research and studies is ongoing in  support of an indication for zonisamide in the paediatric 
population as part of FUM It is noted that there is currently a study ongoing (E2090-044-312) to further 
investigate the use of zonisamide in the paediatric and adolescent population, the final clinical study 
report of which is expected in January 2011. The MAH has stated that this date is an estimate based on 
predicted recruitment rate and could move 6 months either way. 
Scientific overview and discussion: 
II. 
Overview:  Zonegran (zonisamide) is a novel sulphonamide with weak carbonic anhydrase inhibitory 
activity, chemically unrelated to other anti-epileptic agents.  It has a blocking action on voltage sensitive 
sodium and calcium channels, thereby disrupting synchronized neuronal firing, reducing the spread of 
seizure discharges and disrupting subsequent epileptic activity.  It also has a modulatory effect on 
Zonegran

GABA-mediated neuronal inhibition as well as a variety of other effects, which may contribute to its 
pharmacological effects.   
Worldwide Marketing Authorization Status: 
Zonisamide is approved for marketing in several countries/regions including Japan, South Korea, the 
United States, the European Union, Switzerland, Australia, and the Philippines.  Zonisamide was 
licensed in Japan and South Korea in 1989 and 1990 respectively, under the tradename Excegran.  
Excegran is approved in Japan and Korea as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of 
partial and generalized seizures in adults and children.    Zonegran was licensed in the United States in 
2000 and is approved in the US as adjuvant therapy for the treatment of partial seizures in patients 16 
years and older.  Zonegran was granted a license in the European Union as adjuvant therapy for partial 
seizures in adults on 10 March 2005 (via the centralized procedure), in Switzerland on 19 October 2006, 
in Australia on 31 July 2007 and in the Philippines on 28 August 2007. 
Zonegran is available in most locations as either a 25, 50, or 100 mg capsule, intended for either once a 
day or twice daily dosing.  In Japan, as well as Korea, Excegran is also available as a 20% powder 
formulation.

MAH STUDY SYNOPSIS 
Title 
Overall Report of a Historical-Controlled 16-Week Multicenter Study of the Efficacy and Safety 
of Zonisamide (CI-192) in Medically Refractory Patients with Partial Seizures (USA) (Protocols 
912-39 through 42, 44 through 47, and 55) 
Study Dates 
18 April 1985 to 26 January 1987 
Study Objectives 
To determine the effectiveness, plasma levels, and safety of zonisamide in medically refractory 
patients with partial seizures. 
Study Design 
This study was a multicenter, outpatient, non-blinded study that evaluated zonisamide as 
adjunctive therapy in the treatment of medically refractory patients with partial seizures. 
The trial included a 12-week baseline-control period in which patients continued to receive one to 
three other antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, ethosuximide, and 
phenobarbital or primidone), and a 16-week treatment period in which each patient received 
zonisamide daily in two equally divided doses every 12 hours in addition to their other 
antiepileptic drugs. During the treatment period, zonisamide was increased gradually from an 
initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day up to 6 mg/kg/day during the first month of treatment. Additional 
adjustments were based on clinical response providing the daily dosage of zonisamide did not 
exceed the smaller of 20 mg/kg or the amount producing a plasma concentration of 40 µg/mL. 
The primary measure of the effectiveness of zonisamide was the median percent reduction from 
baseline in the frequency of partial seizures. A secondary criterion was the proportion of patients 
responding, a response being defined as at least a 50% reduction in frequency. Further measures 
of efficacy were physician and patient global assessments. 
The patients kept a daily record of the number and description of seizures they experienced, 
including the description and duration of each seizure. Clinic visits were scheduled monthly 
during the baseline phase, weekly during the first month of treatment, every two weeks during the 
second month of treatment, and monthly thereafter. Safety was evaluated based on the following 
variables: adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, scrum chemistry), vital signs, 
ECG, and physical and neurologic examinations. 
Study Population 
A total of 180 patients with refractory partial seizures, alone or secondarily generalized, were 
selected for study and included 85 women and 95 men. They ranged in age from 12 to 67 years 
and in weight from 40.9 to 118.2 kg. Median seizure rates prior to the study were 9.3 partial 
seizures/month and 5.6 complex partial seizures/month. 
Patient Disposition 
One patient died and a further 38 patients withdrew from the study, 8 because of lack of efficacy, 
22 because of adverse events, and 8 for other reasons. One hundred forty-one patients (78.3%) 
completed the study and 137 of these continued into a separately reported extended-treatment 
phase.

The proportion of responders is similar for each seizure type and is consistent with the median 
reductions in seizure frequency. 
The design of the study was such as to allow dose to be titrated to achieve a satisfactory clinical 
response. It is therefore not surprising that no clear dose-response pattern may be perceived in the 
results. 
The global assessments as reported by both physicians and patients are recorded in the table 
below.

It is clear that both physicians and patients perceived zonisamide to be valuable in the majority of 
cases. 
Safety Results 
The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events are shown in the following 
table. Treatment-emergent adverse events were most commonly associated with the nervous 
system (71.7% of patients), body as a whole (48.3%), psychobiologic function (47.2%) and the 
digestive system (45.6%). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included 
dizziness (26.1%), somnolence (25.0%), and nausea and/or vomiting (23.9%). The majority of 
these adverse events were rated as mild or moderate in severity.

The majority of adverse events were reported as mild or moderate and occurred during the first 
28 treatment days. Adverse events were reported with similar frequency by men and women and 
by patients of different age groups. 
One patient (912-47 #19) died during the study. Death resulted from the underlying seizure 
disorder. In addition to one death, serious adverse events were reported for three patients.  
Twenty-two patients discontinued zonisamide therapy prematurely because of an adverse event. 
Most adverse events leading to premature discontinuation first occurred during the dose 
introduction period, and were primarily related to the nervous system. 
One case of renal calculi was reported. 
Other Safety Assessments 
There were no systematic trends in laboratory values. A few mild, transient abnormalities in 
clinical laboratory values occurred in some individuals during the study. With the exception of 
one instance of neutropenia, none was considered clinically significant nor cause for concern.  
No trends or clinically important findings were noted in the physical examinations or 
electrocardiograms. Neurological examinations and electroencephalograms were consistent with 
Zonegran

antiepileptic drug therapy and a diagnosis of partial seizures. Zonisamide treatment was 
associated with weight loss, particularly during the first 28 days of treatment.  
MAH Conclusions 
•  Zonisamide treatment was associated with a reduction in the frequency of simple and 
complex partial seizures when given as adjunctive therapy to patients with refractory 
epilepsy. 
•  Zonisamide was well tolerated by this patient group. 
CHMP COMMENTS: 
•  This clinical trial was an open label study and not a randomised one. 
•  This study was carried out in patients between the ages of 12 and 67 years. It 
is not clear how many of these patients were in the 12 to 18 year old age 
group. 
•  The above mentioned conclusions of the MAH are endorsed. 
•  Following assessment of this study, the adverse events of headache and 
rhinitis should be added to the product information for Zonegran.

Study Objectives 
To obtain additional data on the safety and efficacy of zonisamide in the long-term treatment of 
medically refractive patients with partial seizures. 
Study Design 
This study was the long-term open extension to a multicenter, outpatient, non-blinded study that 
evaluated zonisamide as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of medically refractory patient with 
partial seizures. 
Patients continued to receive one to three other antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
valproic  acid,  ethosuximide,  and  phenobarbital  or  primidone)  together  with  zonisamide  in  two 
equally  divided  doses  every  12  hours.    Dosage  adjustments  were  based  on  clinical  response 
providing the daily dosage of zonisamide did not exceed the smaller of 20 mg/kg or the amount 
producing a plasma concentration of 40 µg/mL. 
The  primary  measure  of  the  effectiveness  of  zonisamide  was  the  percent  reduction  from 
baseline  in  the  frequency  of  partial  seizures  .  A  secondary  measure  was  the  proportion  of 
patients responding, response being defined as a 50% reduction in frequency.

Clinic visits were scheduled 3-monthly. 
Safety was evaluated based on the following variables: adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, 
EEG, ECG, and physical and neurologic examinations. 
Study Population 
A total of 137 patients with refractory partial seizures, alone or secondarily generalized, entered 
the extension phase of the study.  These included 72 men and 65 women.  They ranged in age 
from 12 to 67 years and in weight from 41 to 118 kg.

Patient Disposition 
Investigators  were  not  consistent  in  their  classification  of  the  reasons  for  discrimination.    As 
there was no predetermined treatment period for this extension, it was not technically possible 
for  a  patient  to  complete  the  study.    It  is  probable  that  most  of  the  patients  described  by  the 
investigators as “completed” were in fact discontinued when the study was terminated.

Cross-reference: Appendix B.18 
Treatment-emergent adverse events were most commonly associated with the nervous, 
psychobiologic and digestive systems and with the body as a whole.  The most common 
treatment-emergent adverse events included dizziness (22.6%), headache (17.5%), anorexia 
(17.5%), somnolence (15.3%), and rhinitis (15.3%).  The majority of these adverse events were 
rated as mild or moderate in severity.  
Adverse events were reported with similar frequency by men and women and by patients of 
different age groups. 
No deaths occurred during the extension. Twelve patients reported serious or potentially serious 
adverse events including three cases of renal calculi.

Nine patients discontinued zonisamide therapy because of an adverse event. 
Other Safety Assessments 
No systemic changes in laboratory variable were seen. A few mild, transient abnormalities in 
clinical laboratory values occurred in some individuals during the extension but none gave cause 
for serious concern. 
No trends or clinically important findings were noted in the physical examinations or 
electrocardiograms.  Neurological examinations and electroencephalograms were consistent 
with antiepileptic drug therapy and a diagnosis of partial seizures. 
MAH Conclusions 
• 
Long-term zonisamide treatment was associated with a reduction in the frequency of 
simple and complex partial seizures when given as adjunctive therapy to patients with 
refractory epilepsy.  
• 
Zonisamide was well tolerated by this patient group 
CHMP COMMENTS: 
•  This study is an open ended, open label extension of study 720-02385-96 with 
no control group and as such is of limited value for the assessment of efficacy. 
•  The study population was between 12 and 67 years of age and it is not clear 
how many of the patients were in the paediatric and adolescent population. 
•  The investigators were not consistent in their classification of the reasons for 
discontinuation of the patients from the study. 
•  The above mentioned conclusions of the MAH are endorsed. 
•  Following assessment of this study, as with study 720-02385-96, the adverse 
events of headache and rhinitis should be added to the product information for 
Zonegran.

Methodology: This was a Phase II, multicenter, open-label, pharmacokinetic (PK) study 
designed to evaluate the PK profile and safety of zonisamide in pediatric subjects with 
epilepsy. All subjects were to be screened within 14 days prior of receiving their first dose of 
zonisamide. For analysis purposes, subjects were grouped based on their age at the time of 
entry into this study: Group 1 consisted of subjects aged 5 through 11 years, and Group 2 
consisted of subjects aged 12 through 15 years. At least six subjects in each age group were 
to be on either carbamazepine or phenytoin as part of their stable antiepilepsy drug (AED) 
regimen. Subjects were enrolled to provide an approximately equal distribution of subject ages 
within each of the two age groups. 
Study days were calculated relative to the date when study drug was first administered 
(defined as Day 1). Each subject was to be titrated to a maximum tolerated dose during a 
period of approximately 7 weeks (Days 1 through 48), starting at 1 mg/kg/day (based on 
weight at screening) and gradually increasing up to 12 mg/kg/day or a maximum of 
600 mg/day. If a subject could not tolerate any dose level during the titration period, the dose 
could be decreased in increments of 1 mg/kg/day until a tolerated dose was reached. 
Following screening, study visits were to occur on Days 1, 13, 28, 40, 48, 60, and study 
termination (Day 67 or early termination). Vital signs, weight measurements, and adverse 
event (AE) and concomitant medication assessments were to be performed at every visit 
except for Day 1. Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, physical examinations, clinical laboratory 
testing, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were to be performed on Days 13, 40, and 60, 
following at least 12 days of stable zonisamide dosing. Steady-state serum zonisamide 
concentration–time profiles were evaluated at dose levels of 1, 7, and 12 mg/kg/day in order to

describe the pharmacokinetics of zonisamide at low, moderate, and high doses in the pediatric 
population. A post-study visit was to be conducted on approximately Day 67, 1 week after the 
last dose of study drug.  
Number of Subjects: Of 33 subjects enrolled into this study at four centers in the United 
States, 21 subjects completed the study. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Males or females aged 5 through 15 years who 
had a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy and were on a stable dose of up to two other AEDs. 
Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration: Zonisamide in 12.5-mg, 25-mg, 50-mg, or 
100-mg capsules was to have been administered orally at the dose prescribed by the 
investigator. Zonisamide doses were to be administered every 12 hours twice daily. However, 
for those subjects whose weight was between 15 and 18 kg, zonisamide could be 
administered once daily until the subject was titrated to a dose that could be administered 
twice daily.  
Duration of Treatment: Planned duration of treatment was approximately 9 weeks (60 days). 
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration, Batch No.: No reference therapy 
was administered.

Criteria for Evaluation: 
Pharmacokinetics: Steady-state PK parameters of zonisamide included the following: time to 
observed maximum concentration (Tmax), observed maximum concentration (Cmax), area 
under the curve to last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-last), area under the curve to 12 hours 
(AUC0-12hr), apparent oral clearance (CL/F), and total body weight-normalized apparent oral 
clearance (CL/F/TBW). 
Safety: Safety was assessed by the use of concomitant medications; reported and observed 
AEs; results of clinical laboratory measurements, vital signs, physical examinations, 12-lead 
ECGs, and global assessments.  
Statistical Methods: In general, data were summarized across all subjects and by age group 
(5–11 years and 12–15 years). Descriptive statistics were calculated for all parameters (counts 
and percentages for categorical data; N, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, 
and maximum for continuous data). 
In addition, PK parameters were summarized by the absence or presence of known or 
expected inducers of zonisamide metabolism (carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, oxcarbazepine, 
pentobarbital, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone). Descriptive statistics were calculated for 
all parameters. When appropriate, statistical tests were performed for selected parameters 
(e.g., comparing the two age groups with respect to PK parameters). Dose proportionality 
(twice daily dosing only) was assessed, by age group and the absence or presence of 
inducers (if appropriate), by determining the ratio of geometric means and associated 90% 
confidence intervals of dose adjusted Cmax and AUC values, using the 7 mg/kg dose level as 
the reference.   
Safety was assessed using the safety evaluable population, defined as all subjects who took 
at least one dose of study drug. Mean dose at the final PK visit (in mg/kg/day) in this study 
Zonegran 
EMEA/H/C/000577/P45 024

was calculated. All AEs were listed by subject and were mapped to body systems and 
preferred terms using the Coding Symbols for Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms 
(COSTART) dictionary.  Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were summarized by age group, 
relationship to study drug, and maximum severity, and whether a subject was taking a 
concomitant enzyme-inducing AED at any time during the study. Serious adverse events 
(SAEs) and AEs that resulted in discontinuation were summarized, listed, and described in 
subject narratives.  
Clinical laboratory results and changes from baseline were summarized by age group. In 
addition, clinical laboratory results were classified as below, within, or above reference ranges 
at baseline and at each clinic visit, and were summarized in shift tables. Additional analyses of 
bicarbonate and chloride were performed, including categorical analyses and shift tables. Vital 
signs were listed by subject and summarized by age group using descriptive statistics; these 
summaries included both changes from baseline and categorical changes. Physical 
examination results were listed and ECG results were listed and summarized. Concomitant 
medications were summarized and listed.  
Global assessments of seizure control at baseline and at the final visit were listed.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS 
Disposition and Demographics: A total of 33 subjects were enrolled in the study and 
received zonisamide (21 subjects aged 5–11 years, 12 subjects aged 12–15 years). Of these 
33 subjects, 21 (63.6) subjects completed the study. Overall, the mean age at baseline was 
10 years. Nineteen subjects were male, and 14 subjects were female. Thirty-two subjects 
were white, and one subject was black. Thirty-one subjects provided PK data that was 
included in the PK analysis. 
Total Daily Dose and Concomitant Medications: The mean total daily dose for individual 
subjects aged 5-11 years ranged from less than 0.8 to 13.2 mg/kg/day at the final PK 
assessment. The corresponding range of mean doses for individual subjects aged 12-15 years 
was 2.0 to 12.3 mg/kg/day at the final PK assessment. The overall maximum mean dose was 
9.6 mg/kg/day; 9.3 mg/kg/day for 5-11 year old subjects and 10.0 mg/kg/day for 12-15 year old 
subjects. 
All subjects took a CNS medication during the study; otherwise, the most commonly used 
medications were cough/cold preparations. The most frequently reported (≥5 subjects) 
concomitant AEDs were topiramate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and phenytoin. Sixteen 
subjects (eleven aged 5–11 years and five aged 12–15 years) were taking inducers of 
zonisamide metabolism (carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, oxcarbazepine, pentobarbital, 
phenobarbital, phenytoin, or primidone) as part of their AED regimen. 
Pharmacokinetics: In both non-induced and induced subjects receiving zonisamide twice-
daily, mean zonisamide serum concentration-time profiles appeared dose-dependent, and 
showed relatively small peak-trough fluctuations over each 12-hour evaluation period. Serum 
zonisamide concentrations were higher in non-induced compared to induced subjects at the 
same dose level.  
At each dose level and by age group and inducer status, relatively comparable mean 
Zonegran

Page 18 of 46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
zonisamide serum concentration-time profiles were observed for each gender, indicating little 
or no apparent gender differences. 
Subjects aged 5–11 years receiving 1 mg/kg/day zonisamide by a once-daily regimen had 
generally comparable mean steady-state Cmax and Tmax values compared to subjects of the 
same age group receiving 1 mg/kg/day using a twice-daily regimen. 
Across the three dose levels, non-induced subjects aged 5–11 years taking zonisamide twice-
daily had lower steady-state maximum (Cmax) and cumulative (AUC0-12hr) zonisamide serum 
exposure values than subjects aged 12 – 15 years, but the differences did not achieve 
statistical significance (i.e., p > 0.05). Mean CL/F and CL/F/TBW values were lower and 
higher, respectively, in the younger age group compared to the older age group, but again the 
differences did not typically achieve statistical significance. 
Although the study was not powered to definitively assess dose-proportionality, for non-
induced subjects of both age groups, greater than dose-proportional increases in zonisamide 
Cmax and AUC0-12hr values (i.e., ratio of geometric means <68%) were observed between

For induced pediatric subjects receiving twice-daily dosing, lower steady-state maximum 
(Cmax) and cumulative (AUC0-12hr) zonisamide serum exposure values, and higher CL/F and 
CL/F/TBW values, were observed relative to non-induced pediatric subjects. Mean CL/F/TBW 
values ranged from 29 – 130% higher in induced compared to non-induced subjects. For 
induced pediatric subjects, steady-state maximum (Cmax) and cumulative (AUC0-12hr) 
zonisamide serum exposure values appeared to be comparable between subjects aged 5 – 
11 years and 12 – 15 years, with no statistically significant differences observed. Mean CL/F 
and CL/F/TBW values appeared lower and comparable, respectively, in the younger age 
group compared to the older age group, but again none of the differences achieved statistical 
significance.

Safety Results: All 33 subjects reported at least one treatment-emergent AE. The body 
system most commonly affected was the body as a whole, with 26 (78.8%) subjects reporting 
at least one event in this system. The majority of treatment-emergent AEs were mild to 
moderate in intensity. There were no discernable differences in AEs reported by subjects in 
the different age groups (5- 11 year olds and 12-15 year olds). Severe AEs were reported by 
five (15.2%) subjects. A total of 27 (81.8%) subjects reported at least one treatment-related, 
treatment-emergent AE, 17 (81.0%) subjects aged 5-11 years and 10 (83.3%) subjects aged 
12-15 years. Overall, the most frequently reported (≥5 subjects) treatment-related, treatment-
emergent AEs were somnolence (30.3%), anorexia (27.3%), asthenia (21.2%), and dizziness 
and nervousness (15.2% each).

Safety Results (cont.): 
Sinusitis was the only AE reported more frequently (>2 subjects difference) by subjects who 
received inducers than by subjects who did not receive inducers. Ten subjects were 
prematurely withdrawn from the study due to AEs. Three SAEs (2 non-fatal convulsions and 1 
fatal grand mal convulsion leading to respiratory failure) were reported in two subjects.  
There were more changes from baseline in chemistry results than in either hematology or 
urinalysis. LDH, sodium, and bicarbonate were consistently decreased from baseline and 
alkaline phosphatase, BUN, and chloride were consistently increased from baseline. A 
considerable proportion of subjects (57.6%; 19 of 33) had bicarbonate levels below the 
reference range at some time during treatment. There was a somewhat higher percentage of 
subjects aged 5-11 years (61.9%; 13 of 21) than subjects aged 12-15 years (50.0%; 6 of 12) 
who had bicarbonate levels below the reference range at any time during treatment. 
There were some indications of a tendency for overall mean decreases in blood pressure and 
for mild orthostatic changes with the higher doses; however, decreases in blood pressure 
readings were minimal. There was a tendency in age groups to see more of an indication of an 
increase in blood pressure in the 5-11 year olds and a decrease in blood pressure in the  
12-15 year olds. 
Mean changes in pulse from Baseline tended to be decreases, but mean changes in pulse 
from each day’s pre-dose tended to be increases. Due to the unequal distribution and small 
sample size, the vital sign results should be interpreted with caution.  
Physical examination results were generally unremarkable and no clinically significant 
abnormalities were seen in ECGs conducted during the study. Global assessments of seizure 
control showed that two-thirds of the subjects had an improved assessment of seizure control.  
Conclusions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Zonisamide was found to be generally safe and well tolerated in pediatric epileptic 
subjects aged 5–15 years. 
Zonisamide PK was observed to be dose-dependent in subjects. 
There were no apparent gender differences in zonisamide pharmacokinetics in 
subjects. 
Lower zonisamide exposure and increased clearance was observed in subjects 
receiving known or expected inducers of zonisamide metabolism. 
•  For non-induced subjects, steady-state zonisamide serum exposure was lower and 
CL/F/TBW values were higher in the 5-11 year age group (using a mg/kg-based 
dosing regimen) than in the 12-15 year age group, but the differences were not 
statistically significant. 
•  For induced subjects, generally comparable steady-state zonisamide serum exposure 
and CL/F/TBW values were observed between age groups using a mg/kg-based 
dosing regimen.

CHMP COMMENTS: 
•  The above mentioned conclusions of the MAH are endorsed. 
• 
It is noted that there appears to be a higher percentage of patients aged 5 to 11 
(61.9%, 13 of 21) than patients aged 12 to 15 (50%, 6 of 12) who had 
bicarbonate levels below the reference range at any time during treatment. 
•  Following assessment of this study, there are no amendments required to the 
product information.

Methodology (cont.):  Amendment 1, issued on October 10, 2001, changed the study 
duration from 12 months to 6 months. The final visit for Study AN46046-225 was considered 
to be the initial visit for this study. Additional study visits for safety assessment were to be 
conducted monthly for the first 3 months, and a final visit was to be conducted at 6 months. 
For those subjects who treatment in this study beyond d Month 6 prior to implementation of 
Amendment 1, an additional visit was to be conducted at Month 9 and/or Month 12. As a 
result of this, all study data are summarized in this report through Month 12.  
Vital signs, adverse event (AE) and concomitant medication assessments, physical 
examinations (including weight), and clinical laboratory testing were to be performed at every 
visit. Seizure frequency was to be assessed and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were to be 
performed at the initial and the final visits. Upon completion of this study, subjects were to be 
given the opportunity to enroll in study AN46046-354 to continue long-term treatment with 
zonisamide. 
Number of Subjects: 
29 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Males or females aged 5 through 18 years who 
had a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy, had a satisfactory clinical course in Study AN46046-225, 
and did not experience adverse events that would make continued dosing with zonisamide 
unsafe. 
Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration: Zonisamide in 12.5-mg, 25-mg, 50-mg, 
or 100-mg capsules was to have administered orally at the dose on which the subject was 
stable in Study AN46046-225 (1 mg/kg/day to 12 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum of 
600 mg/day). Zonisamide doses were to be administered approximately every 12 hours twice 
daily.  
Duration of Treatment: 
Planned duration of treatment was 6 months. 
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration, Batch No:  No reference 
therapy was administered. 
Criteria for Evaluation: 
Safety: Safety was assessed by the use of concomitant medications; reported and observed 
AEs; and results of clinical laboratory measurements, vital signs, physical examinations 
(including weight) and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). 
Pharmacokinetics and efficacy:  Zonisamide blood samples for pharmacokinetics analysis 
were to be drawn at Months 3 and 6. Seizure frequency was to be assessed at the initial (Day 
1) and final (Month 6 or at the time of early termination) visits. A global assessment of the 
subject's seizure control by a parent or legal guardian was to be obtained at the final visit 
(Month 6 or at the time of early termination).

Statistical Methods: In general, data were summarized across all subjects and by age group 
(5-11 years and 12-18 years). Descriptive statistics were calculated for all parameters (counts 
and percentages for categorical data; N, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, 
and maximum for continuous data). All subjects enrolled in this study had previously 
participated in a zonisamide study for the treatment of pediatric epilepsy (Study AN46046-
225). Subjects in this study were to continue the zonisamide dose on which they were stable 
in Study AN46046-225. Therefore, all subjects enrolled in this study were considered to be 
safety evaluable, and were included in all safely analyses. Inferential statistics were not 
calculated for safety data. 
Prior to Protocol Amendment 1, which shortened the duration of the study from 12 months to 
6 months, many subjects had completed ≥9 months of treatment in this study. Therefore, it 
was determined that all data should be summarized as well as listed; all data through Month 
12 were summarized and listed in this report.  
Mean exposure to zonisamide (in days) in this study, as well as mean cumulative exposure to 
zonisamide (including exposure in Study AN46046-225), were calculated. All AEs were listed 
by subject. AEs were mapped to body systems and preferred terms using the Coding 
Symbols for Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction terms (COSTART) dictionary. AEs that began 
prior to Day 1 (i.e., those that begun during Study AN46046-225) were categorized as 
“ongoing” AEs, provided that the stop date occurred after Day 1 or if the stop date was 
missing. AEs that began on or after Day 1, as well as any ongoing AEs that increased in 
frequency or worsened in severity on or after Day 1, were categorized as “new” AEs. AEs 
were summarized by age group, relationship to study drug, and maximum severity; these 
summaries were completed for new AEs only and new and ongoing AEs combined. AEs were 
also summarized by age group and whether a subject was taking a concomitant enzyme-
inducing AED at any time during the study. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs that 
resulted in discontinuation were summarized, listed, and described in subject narratives. 
Clinical laboratory results and changes from baseline (Study AN46046-225) were 
summarized by age group using descriptive statistics. In addition, clinical laboratory results 
were classified as below, within, or above reference ranges at baseline and at each clinic 
visits, and were summarized in shift tables. Additional analyses of bicarbonate and chloride 
were performed, including categorical analyses and shift tables. Bicarbonate levels (either 
below or within normal limits of reference range) were used to group subjects for additional 
shift tables of certain chemistry parameters. Vital signs were listed by subject and 
summarized by age group using descriptive statistics; these summaries included both 
changes from baseline (Study AN46046-225) and categorical changes. Physical examination 
and ECG results were listed. Concomitant medications were summarized and listed. 
Seizure frequency per month and change from initial visit in seizure frequency per month 
were summarized descriptively (N, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) by age 
group and overall. Global assessments of seizure control at baseline (recorded for subjects at 
baseline of study AN46046-225) and at the final visit were summarized descriptively (number 
and percentage of subjects).

Serum zonisamide concentrations obtained from blood samples drawn at the Month 3 and 
Month 6 visits were listed but not summarized. Data from the samples from this study may be 
pooled with the pharmacokinetic data from studies AS46046-225 and AN46046-354 and other 
studies as appropriate). If conducted, the results of this analysis will be reported separately. 
SUMMARY OF RESULTS 
Disposition and Demographics: A total of 29 subjects were enrolled in the study and 
received zonisamide (20 subjects aged 5-11 years, 9 subjects aged 12-18 years). Of these 29 
subjects, 24 (82.8%) completed the study. The mean age at the initial visit was 10 years. 
There were 17 male and 12 female subjects. 
Exposure and Concomitant Medications: Overall, the mean total daily dose ranged from 
9.0 to 12.9 mg/kg/day during the study. In subjects aged 5-11 years, it ranged from 
9.0 mg/kg/day to 14.6 mg/kg/day, and in subjects aged 12-18 years, it ranged from 
6.4 mg/kg/day to 10.1 mg/kg/day. 
The overall mean exposure to zonisamide in this study was 259 days. The mean exposure in 
5-11 year old subjects was 254 days, compared to 272 days in 12-18 year old subjects. 
Cumulative exposure to zonisamide (Studies AN46046-225 and -226 combined) was a mean 
of 323 days overall. The mean cumulative exposure in 5-11 year old subjects was 317 days, 
compared to 338 days in 12-18 year old subjects. 
Concomitant medications affecting the central nervous system (CNS) were used by all 
subjects. Anti-infectives and dietary supplements were both used by 48% of subjects. The 
most frequently reported (≥ 5 subjects) concomitant AEDs were levetiracetam, lamotrigine, 
topiramate, phenytoin sodium, and oxcarbazepine. 
Efficacy Results: The seizure frequency data were markedly non-normally distributed. At the 
initial visit, subjects aged 5-11 years had a median seizure frequency on 30 seizures per 
month, compared with 2 seizures per month in subjects aged 12-18 years. At the final visit, 
subjects aged 5-11 years had a median seizure frequency of 40 seizures per month, 
compared with 4 seizures per month in subjects aged 12-18 years. Results of the global 
assessment of seizure control, assessed at baseline in Study AN46046-225 and the final visit 
of Study AN46046-226, indicated that 13 of 29 (44.8%) subjects had average or better 
seizure control at baseline, compared to 18 of 25 (72.0%) at the final visit. However due to the 
small sample size and the large variance in data at the initial and final visits, meaningful 
conclusions cannot be drawn regarding seizure frequency in this study.

Safety Results: All 29 subjects reported at least one treatment-emergent AE. The body 
systems most commonly affected were body as a whole and nervous system, each with 23 
subjects (79.3%) [16 (80.0%) and 17 subjects (85.0%) aged 5-11 years, respectively, and 7 
(77.8%) and 6 subjects (66.7%) aged 12-18 years, respectively] reporting events in these 
systems. The majority of treatment-emergent AEs were mild to moderate in severity. A total of 
8 (27.6%) subjects reported 12 new severe AEs (9 different events). No subject was 
discontinued from the study due to an adverse event and no subject died during the study or 
within 30 days of the last dose of zonisamide.  
A total of 24 (82.2%) subjects had reports of treatment-related, treatment-emergent AEs, 17 
(85.0%) subjects aged 5-11 years and 7 (77.8%) subjects aged 12-18 years. 
Ten new serious, nonfatal AEs were reported in five subjects; two of the events were 
considered to be related to zonisamide. 
In general, few subjects experienced laboratory abnormalities that were evaluated by the 
investigator as clinically significant, and no subject was prematurely withdrawn from the study 
due to laboratory abnormalities. Overall 75.0% of subjects had bicarbonate levels that were 
below the normal reference range at any time during the study. A smaller proportion (28.6%) 
of subjects had chloride values that were above the normal reference range at any time 
during the study.  
Overall, vital sign results were generally unremarkable. 
MAH Conclusions: Long-term treatment with zonisamide was found to be generally safe and 
well tolerated in pediatric epileptic subjects aged 5-18 years. 
Date of Final Report: 28 March, 2004 
CHMP COMMENTS: 
•  There were only 29 subjects enrolled in this study, of which only 24 
completed the study. 
•  Due to the small sample size and the large variance in data at the initial and 
final visits and the lack of a placebo arm in this study, meaningful conclusions, 
in this study, cannot be drawn. 
•  Ten new non fatal SAEs were reported in 5 subjects (four aged 5 – 11 years 
and one aged 12 – 18 years). Two of these, namely, encephalopathy and grand 
mal convulsion were considered by the investigators to be related to 
zonisamide and both events resolved following a reduction in the zonisamide

dosage. 
•  Laboratory data show a tendency for a low bicarbonate level and high chloride 
level to occur more often in 5 – 11 year olds than in 12 – 18 year olds.  
•  The overall exposure to zonisamide in this study was 259 days, with the mean 
exposure in 5-11 year old subjects of 254 days and of 272 days in 12-18 year 
olds. The cumulative exposure to zonisamide (studies AN46046-225 and 226 
combined) was a mean of 323days overall with 317 days exposure in the 5-11 
year olds and 338 days in the 12-18 year olds. This period of time is not 
considered to be regarded as long term exposure. Therefore the conclusion of 
the MAH that long term treatment with zonisamide was found to be generally 
safe and well tolerated in paediatric epileptic subjects aged 5 – 18 years should 
be interpreted with caution and further studies would be required to confirm 
this statement.  
•  There are no amendments required to the product information following 
assessment of this study.

1. To evaluate the efficacy of zonisamide as measured by the reduction in seizure frequency 
between the Screening Phase and the Maintenance Phase as recorded on the daily diary. 
2. To evaluate the efficacy of zonisamide as measured by the subject global assessments of 
antiepileptic therapy and life in general as well as the investigator global assessment of 
antiepileptic therapy at Week 12 as compared to baseline (Week 0) 
3. To evaluate changes in the duration of seizures between the Screening and Maintenance 
Phases. 
Methodology:  This open-label single treatment study was conducted with no placebo or 
active comparator groups.  Subjects were enrolled in a 4-week Screening Phase during which 
they recorded seizure frequency without zonisamide treatment. Those that met inclusion 
criteria were enrolled and zonisamide treatment was initiated with a slow, low dose titration 
beginning at 25 mg daily and increasing up to the maximum tolerated dose of 400 mg daily 
during the 8-week Titration Phase.  The maximum tolerated dose was continued through the 
4-week Maintenance Phase.  Study Visits were at the end of titration (Week 8) and 
maintenance (Week 12). Subjects had the option to continue and receive up to 800 mg daily 
in the Extension Phase, with study visits every 3 months. 
Number of Subjects 
Planned: 200 subjects 
Analyzed: 243 subjects in the Intent-To-Treat Population were the basis for the safety 
analysis.  196 subjects (who completed the Week 12 Visit) in the evaluable population were 
the basis for the efficacy analysis.  171 subjects continued into the Extension Phase, those 
continuing to receive study drug at each study visit were the basis for safety and efficacy 
evaluations during the Extension Phase. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  Male or female subjects 12 years of age or 
older with partial seizures that were receiving one or two daily chronic antiepileptic drugs and 
required the addition of another daily antiepileptic drug to their regimen entered the Screening 
Phase.  To be enrolled in the treatment phases, subjects must have had at least one partial 
seizure during the Screening Phase. 
Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration: 
Zonegran TM (zonisamide) 25, 50 and 100 mg capsules taken orally. 
Duration of Treatment:  The Screening and Maintenance Phases were each to be 4 weeks 
in duration.  The Titration Phase was planned to last 8 weeks.  The median duration of the 
Titration and Maintenance Phases was 84 days (25th and 75th percentile: 79, 89).  The median 
duration of the Extension Phase was 378 days (25th and 75th percentile: 231, 486). 
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration, Batch number:  No placebo or 
active comparator reference treatment was included in this study.

Criteria for Evaluation: 
Efficacy (Primary):  The primary efficacy criterion was seizure frequency as recorded in a 
daily diary. 
Effective (Secondary):  The secondary efficacy criteria were changes in the seizure type or 
duration as recorded in a daily diary and changes in subject and physician global 
assessments of antiepileptic therapy and the subject global assessment of life in general at 
Week 12 compared to Week 0. 
Safety: Safety was evaluated by the frequency of adverse events and body weight changes. 
Statistical Methods:  Sample size: Sample size and power calculations were not used in this 
study.  Approximately 200 subjects with partial epilepsy were to be enrolled. 
Statistical Analysis: Summary statistics were provided for number and type of seizures from 
seizure diaries, zonisamide dose and duration of treatment, subject compliance, subject and 
investigator global assessments, body weight.  Adverse events and reasons for 
discontinuation were listed and summarized. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated 
for the percent of subjects that experienced a ≥ 50% decrease in seizure frequency from the 
Screening Phase for overall, simple partial, complex partial and other seizures at the end of 
Maintenance Phase and at each examined Extension Visit period.  The 95% confidence 
intervals were computed for mean body weight changes at Week 8 and 12.  The 95% 
confidence intervals were also computed for the mean global assessment change at the 
same time points.  No inferential statistics were done. 
Summary of Results: 
Efficacy:  The frequency of seizures overall and partial seizures in particular was 
substantially decreased by zonisamide during this study. The seizure frequency decreased 
relative to baseline at the end of the Maintenance Phase and continued throughout the 
Extension Phase for each of these types of seizures.  A significant number of subjects 
experienced a decrease of at least 50% in their seizure frequency following treatment with 
zonisamide at their maximum tolerated dose, up to 400 mg daily (Maintenance Phase) or up 
to 800 mg daily (Extension Phase).  No change in the duration or type of seizure was 
apparent with zonisamide treatment.

Note: Ninety day (90) seizure frequency observed for each extension visit period was prorated to 28 days

Safety:  The adverse event profile following administration of zonisamide were generally 
consistent with data from the package insert.  The most frequent treatment adverse events 
(occurring in > 10% of subjects) during the Titration and Maintenance Phases of the study 
were dizziness, somnolence, headache, abnormal thinking, asthenia, anorexia, accidental 
injury and nausea.  With the exception of accidental injury, these adverse events were 
those most frequently considered dug related by the investigator.  The most frequent 
treatment-emergent adverse events (occurring in > 10% of subjects) during the Extension 
Phase of the study were abnormal thinking, infection, anorexia, weight loss, insomnia and 
somnolence. Abnormal thinking, weight loss and anorexia were those most frequently 
(> 10% of subjects) considered study drug related by the investigator. 
Subjects that withdraw from treatment during the Titration and Maintenance Phases 
frequently did so at dose of 100 mg daily or less.  Those that withdraw during the Extension 
Phase frequently attained doses of 400 to 600 mg daily.  Somnolence, dizziness and 
nausea, that were more frequent in the Titration and Maintenance Phases of the study 
were less frequent in the Extension Phase and may become less troublesome over time 
with continued therapy.  Adverse events such as weight loss that may develop over time 
may be observed more frequently with longer zonisamide treatment. 
Treatment with zonisamide in subjects with partial epilepsy resulted in small, but significant 
decreases in body weight from baseline.  The mean body weight of the 243 subjects in the 
ITT population was 74.6 kg at baseline with a decrease in mean body weight from baseline 
at Week 8 of -0.7 kg (95% confidence interval of -1.1, -0.4) and at Week 12 of -1.0 kg (95% 
CI: -1.3, -0.6).  Overall, the mean body weight of the subjects declined over the course of 
the extension from a mean of 74.7 kg at baseline with a decrease in mean body weight 
from the baseline at Visit 1 of -2.1 kg (95% confidence interval of -2.8, -1.5) and at Visit 2 of 
-2.8kg (95% CI: -3.7, -1.9) at Visit 3 of -3.4 kg (95% CI of -4.6, -2.3) and Visit 4 of -3.8 kg 
(95% CI -5.3, -2.3)

MAH Conclusions:  
Zonisamide, titrated to the maximum tolerated dose in subjects with partial epilepsy, resulted in a 
decrease in seizure frequency of 50% or more in a significant percentage of the evaluable, ITT, 
and extension populations.  This applied to overall seizures as well as simple partial, complex 
partial and other seizures. 
The subject and investigator global assessments of AED therapy and the subject global 
assessment of life in general showed a small, but significant improvement following zonisamide 
treatment. 
Treatment with zonisamide in subjects with partial epilepsy resulted in small, but significant 
decreases in body weight from baseline that, during the Titration and Maintenance Phases 
(medium duration 84 days), were mean decreases of < 1 kg and, during the first 4 visits of the 
Evaluation Phase (medium duration 378 days), were a mean decrease between 2 and 4 kg. 
Zonisamide treatment in subjects with partial epilepsy was generally well tolerated. 
CHMP COMMENTS: 
•  This study was an open label, single treatment study which was conducted 
with no placebo or active comparator groups. 
•  The subjects included in this trial were aged 12 years and older and so it is not 
clear how many of these subjects were in the paediatric and adolescent 
population. 
•  The above mentioned conclusions of the MAH are endorsed. 
•  As discussed, following assessment of studies, 720-02385-96 and 720-02385-
96EXT and in addition, following assessment of this study, the adverse event 
of headache should be added to the product information for Zonegran.

Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study was: 
To assess the safety of the 25 and 50 mg dosage strengths when used in the initial titration of 
Zonegran®. Safety was determined by the number of adverse events (AEs) and the body 
weight changes during the initial titration. 
Methodology:  
Number of Patients: 
This was an open-label, multicenter study in patients ≥ 12 years of 
age with a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Those who met the criteria and 
were enrolled in the study began their titration at 25 or 50 mg of 
zonisamide depending on their weight.  The patient was titrated to 
the 100 mg dose over 2 to 8 weeks.  Patients returned to the clinic 
once they reached the 100 mg dosage for the Completion Visit. 
Adverse events, body weight, and any changes to concomitant 
anti-epileptic drug (AED) medications were to be recorded. 
Approximately 300 patients were initially planned. Upon evaluation 
of the rate of enrolment, it was decided to terminate the study with 
147 patients at 26 sites enrolled with 143 included in the intent-to-
treat (ITT) population. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for inclusion: 
Male or female patients ≥ 12 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy

Duration of Treatment: 
From 2 to 8 weeks 
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration, Batch No.:  None 
Criteria for Evaluation: 
Safety assessed by monitoring AEs and concomitant  
medication usage, and measuring the change of weight from 
Screening to Completion of Visit. 
Statistical Methods: 
Analysis population:  One population, the ITT population, is used for all summaries and 
analyses of study data 
Demographic characteristics:  Demographic characteristics of age, gender, race, height, 
and weight are summarized using descriptive statistics. 
Safety:  Adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) are summarized by body system 
and preferred term using the Coding Symbol for a Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms 
(COSTART), presenting frequency of subject incidence and percentages. The change in body 
weight is measured from the Screening Visit to the Completion Visit.  Body weights obtained 
at the Screening and Completion Visits are summarized using descriptive statistics as well as 
the change from screening to completion.  The magnitude of this change is evaluated using a 
95% confidence interval.  Concomitant medication taken during the study are listed by patient 
and summarized by World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
Classification for Drugs (WHO ATC) code and drug name. 
Summary of Results: 
Efficacy:  Not Applicable 
Safety: 
•  There were no deaths. There were 3 SAEs, two of which led to study drug discontinuation.  
Two of these SAEs were seizures and the third was colitis. No SAE was assessed by the 
Investigator as study drug related. 
•  The overall incidence of AEs (number of patients experiencing at least one event) 
regardless of the relationship to study drug was 82 (57.3%). 
―  The body system with the highest incidence of AEs was Body As A Whole 41 
(28.7%), then Nervous System 37 (25.9%), followed by Digestive System 23 (16.1%), 
Respiratory System 12 (8.4%), and skin and Appendages 10 (7.0%). 
―  Overall, the AE occurring with the highest incidence was headache (12.6%), followed 
by somnolence (8.4%) and then asthenia (6.3%). 
―  There was a total of 182 AEs reported by 82 patients during the study.

The dose level at which AEs occurred can be summarized as follows:  
―  Thirty-nine patients had a total of 67 AEs at the 25 mg/day dose level.  The AE 
reported by the highest number of patients at this dose was headache.  It occurred in 
7 patients. 
―  Twenty-four patients had a total of 40 AEs at the 50 mg/day dose level.  The AE with 
the highest incidence was headache in 5 patients. 
―  Six patients had a total of 9 AEs at the 75mg/day dose level. No AE occurred more 
than once at this dose level. 
―  Thirty-three patients had a total of 47 AEs at the 100 mg/day dose level. The AE with 
the highest incidence was headache. It occurred in 9 patients. 
―  Seven patients had a total of 16 AEs at doses higher than 100 mg/day.  The AEs with 
the highest incidence were dizziness, somnolence, and insomnia.  Each of these AEs 
occurred in 2 patients. 
• 
There were 81 AEs occurring in 51 patients that were considered by the Investigator to 
be study drug related.  The most frequent study drug related AE was somnolence which 
was experienced as an AE 13 times by 12 patients. 
•  Approximately 11% (16/143) of the patients discontinued study drug because of AEs.  
The total number of AEs that led to discontinuation was 22. 
• 
The body systems with the highest incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation were the 
Nervous System and Body as a Whole.  The Nervous System had 5 patients having a 
total of 6 AEs.  The AEs included convulsion and Grand Mal convulsion, somnolence, 
emotional lability, tremor, and abnormal gait.  The Body as a Whole System had 
5 patients having a total of 6 AEs.  The AEs in this system included chest pain, 
headache, overdose, abdominal pain, and allergic reactions. 
―  Other AEs leading to study discontinuation were in the Digestive System (nausea, 
anorexia, dyspepsia, and colitis), Skin and Appendages (urticaria, and rash), 
Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders (hypernatremia), Urogenital System (urinary 
tract infection), Cardiovascular System (tachycardia), and Special Senses (tinnitus). 
―  The AEs most commonly associated with discontinuation in this study were 
headache, rash and convulsion 
• 
There was no significant change in patient weights during the study (95% CI = -0.1, 0.6).  
No patient reached the protocol defined AE of a 10% weight loss.

MAH Conclusions:  
Due to the smaller than planned sample size, the safety results should be interpreted 
cautiously. 
• 
• 
There was no significant change in patient weights during the study (95% CI = -0.1, 0.6).  
No patient reached the protocol defined AE of a 10% weight loss. 
This study showed that the gradual titration of Zonegran® beginning at 25 or 50 mg/day 
was safe and resulted in few AEs. 
Date of Report: 
01 October 2003 
CHMP COMMENTS: 
•  This trial enrolled patients of 12 years and upwards and it is not clear how 
many of these were in the 12 to 18 age population. 
•  The clinical trial is of open label design. 
• 
It was intended to enrol 300 patients, however, only 147 patients were enrolled 
with 143 included in the intent to treat population and so therefore the 
conclusion of the MAH, that due to the smaller than planned sample size, the 
safety results should be interpreted cautiously, is endorsed. 
•  As discussed in studies 720-02385-96, 720-02385-96EXT and ZNS-401, the 
adverse event of headache should be added to the product information for 
Zonegran.

Date of Amendment 2:  18 November 1999 
Investigators and Study Centers:  A total of 20 study centers in the United States 
participated in this study; patients were enrolled at 16 of these centers.  A complete list of 
investigators and study centers locations is provided in Section 6, Table 1. 
Publication (reference): Vossler, DG.  Multicenter, open-label, safety and efficacy study of 
zonisamide in patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy. Neurology. 2002;April (3 Suppl):

Study Period (dates of study): 
Date of First Treatment:  8 March 2000 
Date of Last Observation: 23 July 2001 
Phase of Development:  Phase IV 
The primary objectives of this study were to:  (1) assess the safety of 
Primary Objectives: 
zonisamide when used for patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy as determined by the 
number of adverse events (AEs), change in body weight, and laboratory tests including 
zonisamide levels; (2) evaluate the efficacy of zonisamide as measured by 50% reduction in 
myoclonic seizures as recorded in the daily seizure diary; and (3) evaluate the efficacy of 
zonisamide as measured by the reduction in seizure frequency, type and duration as 
recorded in the daily seizure diary. 
Methodology: This was a Phase IV, open-label, single-arm, multicenter safety and efficacy 
study of patients with a diagnosis of progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME). Planned 
enrollment was approximately 50 patients. The study design included a screening (baseline) 
period, titration period, maintenance period, and tapering period. Patients who met the entry 
criteria were provided a daily seizure diary to record frequency of seizures during the 2-week 
screening period. Following completion of this screening period, patients were dispensed 
zonisamide at the Baseline Visit (Week 0). The initial dose of zonisamide treatment (mg/day) 
depended upon the patient's weight (≤40 kg or >40 kg). For each of the weight groups, the 
initial target dose of zonisamide was 0.4 mg/kg/day and could be titrated to 6 mg/kg/day over 
an 8-week period. The dose was increased on a weekly basis until the patient reached the 
maximum tolerated dose (as determined by the investigator) or the 6 mg/kg/day maximum 
(400 mg/day). Patients who could not tolerate a dose increase were to return to the previous 
dose level. An 8-week maintenance period followed the titration period. Upon completion of 
the maintenance period, patients returned to the clinic for the Final Efficacy Visit.

If the patient wished to continue zonisamide therapy after this study (by either entering 
another investigational study or taking commercially available zonisamide), the patient was 
allowed to exit this study upon completion of the Final Efficacy Visit procedures and 
zonisamide was not tapered. If the patient wished to discontinue zonisamide therapy, the 
patient was tapered off zonisamide therapy over 2 weeks and returned to the clinic for an End 
of Tapering Visit. The duration of treatment in this study was 16 weeks for patients not 
tapering and 18 weeks for those tapering off zonisamide therapy. 
Number of Patients: 30 patients were enrolled and 20 patients completed the study. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Male and female patients 5 years of age or older 
who had as their primary form of epilepsy a diagnosis of PME (as defined by the International 
Classification of Epilepsies and Epileptic Syndromes - Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsies). 
Patients with myoclonic seizures refractory to other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were the target 
study population. Patients selected for study were not to be taking more than three chronic 
daily AEDs. 
Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration: Zonisamide was administered according 
to the patient's weight. Patients who weighed ≤40 kg were started at 12.5 mg/day 
(0.4 mg/kg/day) and patients who weighed >40 kg were started at 25 mg/day (0.4 mg/kg/day). 
Doses were titrated on a weekly basis until patients reached their effective dose or up to a 
maximum dose of 200 mg/day (6 mg/kg/day) or 400 mg/day (6 mg/kg/day) for patients 
weighing ≤40 kg or >40 kg, respectively.  
Duration of Treatment: Duration of treatment was 16-18 weeks. 
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration, Batch No.: No reference therapy 
was administered. 
Criteria for Evaluation: The efficacy parameters were a 50% or 75% reduction in myoclonic 
seizures, median percent reduction in seizures, number of patients who were seizure free, 
and number of patients with increases in seizures during the maintenance period. Patient and 
investigator global assessments of seizure control and patient well being were also 
measured.  
Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events, changes in body weight, clinical 
laboratory tests, and zonisamide serum concentration.  
Statistical Methods: All seizure count analyses called for comparison (paired tests) between 
the baseline period (Week -2 to Week 0) and the maintenance period (Week 8 to Week 16). 
The seizure diaries returned at Week 0 and Week 16 defined these two periods. Patients 
either counted their daily seizures over each 24-hour period or using 10-minute counts three 
times a day (morning, afternoon, and evening). Means of each type of count were calculated 
for the baseline period and the maintenance period so that each individual had a baseline 
period mean and a maintenance period mean.

For the patients who counted their seizures for 10 minutes three times a day, seizure data 
were analyzed for the morning, afternoon, and evening 10-minute counts as well as for an 
average 10-minute count across the morning, afternoon, and evening observations. For those 
patients reporting seizures per 24 hours, the 24-hour counts were used for analysis. To 
enable seizure data to be analyzed for the study population as a whole, the 24-hour counts 
were also converted to 10-minute counts and combined with the average of morning, 
afternoon, and evening 10-minute counts to create a converted 10-minute count. Seizure data 
are reported for each of these count types (i.e. morning 10-minute count; afternoon 10-minute 
count; evening 10-minute count; average of 10-minute morning, afternoon, and evening 
counts; 24-hour counts; and converted 10-minute counts) in the efficacy tables; however, the 
focus in this report is on the converted 10-minute count analyses.  
AEs and clinical laboratory test results were summarized using descriptive statistics (counts 
and percentages for categorical variables and number [N], mean, and standard deviation [SD] 
for continuous variables). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were summarized by 
body system and COSTART code, using patient and event counts. Body weight was 
summarized for the study population as a whole and by age group (≤18 or >18 years) and 
compared between baseline and Final Efficacy Visit using a paired t-test.  
Summary of Results: 
Efficacy: Efficacy results based on converted 10-minute myoclonic seizure counts are as 
follows. Patients with baseline counts greater than zero and non-missing maintenance period 
seizure events were included in percent reduction calculations (n = 20). Ten of these 
20 patients (50%) achieved a 50% reduction in mean myoclonic seizure counts from baseline 
to maintenance period; and 6 of these 20 (30%) achieved a 75% reduction. The median 
percent reduction in seizure counts from baseline to maintenance period was 54.5%. The 
number of patients who were seizure free or who experienced an increase in seizures from 
baseline to maintenance period was also determined. For this analysis, patients with missing 
seizure count data during baseline or maintenance periods were not included; however, 
patients reporting zero seizures at baseline were included (n = 21). Six of these 21 patients 
(28.6%) had an increase in seizure counts and 4 of these 21 patients (19%) were seizure free 
during the maintenance period. Patient and investigator global assessments reflected an 
improvement in seizure control that was statistically significant (p <0.05, paired t-test). 
Safety: A total of 27 patients had one or more TEAE. TEAEs that occurred in 10% or more of 
the study population were: anorexia (27%), asthenia (23%), somnolence (23%), fever (20%), 
infection (17%), rash (17%), constipation (13%), convulsions (13%), increased cough (13%), 
accidental injury (13%), nervousness (13%), diarrhea (10%), and vomiting (10%). Sixteen 
patients had treatment-related TEAEs. Treatment-related TEAEs occurring in 10% or more of 
the patients were anorexia (23%), somnolence (17%), asthenia (13%), and nervousness 
(10%). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. One death occurred and although this 
9-year-old girl had been in critical condition one year prior to entering this study and was first 
hospitalized during this study prior to receiving study drug, the investigator considered her 
elevated liver enzymes and multisystem organ failure related to study drug.

Five additional patients had nonfatal serious adverse events (SAEs); none of these were 
considered treatment related. Five patients withdrew from the study due to TEAEs. The 
weight of patients over 18 years of age decreased with borderline statistical significance  
(p = 0.0525) during the study. Those patients 18 years of age or younger maintained a stable 
weight during the study (p = 0.6738). Other than for the patient who died from multisystem 
organ failure, there were no notable clinical laboratory findings.  
Conclusions: Zonisamide appears to be safe and generally well tolerated in subjects with 
myoclonic epilepsy. However, due to the fact that the study was small and open-label in 
design, caution should be used when interpreting the results. The observed AE profile 
appeared to be consistent with what has been previously described for commercially available 
zonisamide. Further research to establish the efficacy and tolerability of zonisamide in 
patients with myoclonic epilepsy may be warranted.  
Date of Report: 12 April 2004 
CHMP COMMENTS: 
•  The above mentioned conclusions of the MAH are endorsed. 
•  This study was a small, open label study and caution should be used when 
interpreting the results. 
•  There was one death during this study which occurred in a 9 year old girl. She 
had been in a critical condition one year prior to entering the study and was 
first hospitalised prior to receiving study medication, however, the investigator 
considered that her elevated liver enzymes and multisystem organ failure to be 
related to study medication. 
•  As stated by the MAH, further research to establish the efficacy and 
tolerability of zonisamide in patients with Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy 
would be warranted.

Title of Study:  A Pilot Dose-range Finding Study of Zonegran (zonisamide) in Patients with 
Neuropathic Pain Conditions 
Principal Investigator: Investigators for this 3-center study are listed in Section 16.4. 
Study Centers:  This study was conducted at 3 sites in the United States. 
Publication (reference): Backonja M, Galer B. Zonisamide for neuropathic pain: a pilot study. 
Poster presented at: Zonegran Scientific Exhibit at the American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting, 
December 3, 2000, Los Angeles, CA. Elan Pharmaceuticals 2000;26 27. 
Study Period: 
Phase of Development: IV 
Date First Subject Enrolled: 31 January 2000 
Date Last Visit Completed: 15 March 2001 
Primary Objectives: The primary objectives of this study were: 
1.  To evaluate the patient tolerability and safety (i.e., laboratory tests, including zonisamide 
levels, and frequency of adverse events) of Zonegran use in subjects with neuropathic pain 
conditions.  
2.  To determine the target dose range of Zonegran for future study of effectiveness in treating 
subjects with neuropathic pain conditions. 
Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives of this study were: 
To evaluate the efficacy of Zonegran, either alone or as adjunctive therapy, in subjects with 
neuropathic pain conditions as determined by changes in the following:  
•  Patient Daily Diary (The average weekly pain score was determined by the subject's 
assessment of daily pain, recorded in the Patient Daily Diary, and the average calculated over 
the 7-day period) 
•  Pain Relief Scale  
•  Pain qualities as rated by the Neuropathic Pain Scale  
•  Pain assessment as rated by the Wisconsin Brief Pain Inventory, and 
• 
Investigator Global Assessment. 
Methodology: This was an open-label, dose-titration, 3-center, Phase IV study for male or female 
subjects, aged 12 years or older, weighing at least 35 kg and diagnosed with daily neuropathic 
pain that had persisted for a minimum of 3 months. The study consisted of a screening phase 
(Week -1); a 1-week baseline Screening Period, during which subjects recorded their daily pain 
score in the Patient Daily Diary (Week 0); and a 12-week treatment phase consisting of an 8-week 
dose Titration Period (Weeks 1 through 8), a 2-week dose Maintenance Period (Weeks 9 and l0), 
and a 2-week Tapering Period (Weeks 11 and 12). 
Number of Subjects 
Planned: up to 20 subjects 
Analyzed: 34 subjects in the Intent-to-Treat Population, 34 subjects in the Safety Population

Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects diagnosed with daily neuropathic pain that 
had persisted for a minimum of 3 months (documented by patient's signs and symptoms, 
neurologic exam, and a minimum score of 4 from average pain intensity score derived from the 
Patient Diary) were eligible for participation in the study if they met the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria as stated in the protocol.  
Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration: Zonegran 25-mg, 50-mg, and 100-mg  
capsules taken orally. The capsules were packaged in high density polyethylene bottles with child-
resistant closures. For subjects weighing more than 40 kg, the dose was initiated at 25 mg daily 
and was titrated to a maximum daily dose of 800 mg. For subjects weighing between 35 and 40 
kg, the dose was initiated at 25 mg every other day and was titrated to a maximum daily dose of 
400 mg. For all subjects, if a dose was not tolerated, then the dose was reduced to the previous 
level, and the subject was maintained on this dose as their maximum tolerated dose. The dose 
tapering schedule required tapering the dose for all subjects completing the study. The medication 
was to be withdrawn by reducing the dose by 50% for 2 weeks, then stopping therapy. 
Duration of Treatment: The Titration Period, during which doses were titrated to the maximum 
tolerated dose, was 8 weeks in duration (Weeks 1-8). The Maintenance Period, during which 
subjects received a stable maintenance dose, was 2 weeks in duration (Weeks 9 and 10). The 
Tapering Period, during which the doses were tapered, was 2 weeks in duration (Weeks 11 and 
12). 
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration, Batch Number: No placebo or active 
comparator reference was included in this study.

Safety (Primary): Evaluation of the tolerability and safety of Zonegran was the primary objective 
of the study. Criteria for evaluating safety were clinically significant changes in vital signs (blood 
pressure and pulse) and laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, zonisamide 
levels), and the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events as spontaneously reported by 
patients or noted by the Investigator. 
Efficacy (Secondary): Evaluation of the potential efficacy of Zonegran, either alone or as 
adjunctive therapy, was a secondary objective of this study. The efficacy of Zonegran was 
determined on the basis of changes from Baseline at each visit in subjects' assessments of daily 
pain recorded in the Patient Daily Diaries; subjects' assessments of pain relief at Weeks 8 and 10; 
and changes from Baseline at Weeks 8 and 10 in subjects' assessment of pain using the 
Wisconsin Brief Pain Inventory and Neuropathic Pain Scale and in the Investigator Global 
Assessment of patients' disease status. 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics: Zonisamide levels were determined as part of the 
safety analysis. 
Statistical Methods: Two analysis populations were defined for enrolled subjects who took at 
least 1 dose of Zonegran. The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis population included ITT subjects who 
had at least 1 on-drug efficacy evaluation, while the safety analysis population comprised all ITT 
subjects who had follow-up safety information. Study populations were summarized by site and 
overall for all enrolled subjects. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize age, gender, race, 
body weight, and height for the safety analysis population. The number (and percentage) of 
patients who had adverse events beginning during the Titration, Maintenance, or Tapering Periods 
were displayed by preferred term. Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) and body weight and 
changes from Baseline were summarized using descriptive statistics. Baseline was the last 
measurement taken prior to the first dose of open-label Zonegran. Laboratory data were listed. 
Efficacy measurements included daily pain scores (from diary), Pain Relief Scale, Neuropathic 
Pain Scale, Wisconsin Brief Pain Inventory, and Investigator Global Assessment. Analyses of 
efficacy measurements were based on the ITT analysis population. Descriptive statistics were 
displayed at Baseline and each study week in addition to changes from Baseline for total scores 
and individual items, where applicable. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated at 
each time point on the mean changes from Baseline for each summarized measure. Numbers and 
percentages of patients in each category were displayed in addition to mean values for scales with 
5 or fewer categories. 
Summary of Results: 
Dose: One of the objectives of the study was to determine the target dose range of Zonegran in 
treating subjects with neuropathic pain conditions. According to the protocol, if a dose was not 
tolerated, then the dose was reduced to the previous level, and the subject was maintained on 
his/her maximum tolerated dose. The most common maintenance doses were between 350 and 
450 mg per day, received by 47.4% of subjects at Week 9 and by 44.4% of subjects at Week 10.

Efficacy: Treatment with zonisamide generally resulted in mean decreases (improvement) in pain 
scores. For the Patient Daily Diary, mean pain ratings decreased from Baseline at all time points 
from Weeks 1 to 7 and Weeks 8 to 12. For the Pain Relief Scale, 5 subjects each at Weeks 8 and 
10 had a much improved or complete relief response. Four of these subjects had a history of various 
neuropathies and 1 had reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the left lower leg, left arm twitch, and right 
forearm numbness. For the Neuropathic Pain Scale, the mean total score decreased from Baseline 
at the Week 8 and Week 10 visits. In addition, there were decreases for most of the 10 
subparameters that make up this assessment tool at Weeks 8 and 10. For the Wisconsin Brief Pain 
Scale Inventory, there were mean decreases from Baseline at Week 8 in 10 of the 12 parameters 
and at Week 10 in 7 of the 12 parameters that make up this Inventory. For the Investigator Global 
Assessment, 4 subjects improved at the Week 8 visit, and a total of 5 subjects had improved at the 
Week 10 visit, for a total of 6 unique subjects between the 2 time periods. The types of neurological 
history for these subjects who improved were varied. 
Safety:  The type of adverse events reported during this trial appear consistent with the adverse 
event profile in the current Zonegran prescribing information. Adverse events that occurred in more 
than 10.0% (4 or more subjects) included: thinking abnormal (29.4%), asthenia (26.5%), nausea 
(26.5%), pain (26.5%), dizziness (23.5%), somnolence (20.6%), dyspepsia (17.6%), headache  
(17.6%), paresthesia (14.7%), rash (14.7%), anorexia (11.8%), constipation (11.8%), diarrhea 
(11.8%), insomnia (11.8%), pruritis (11.8%), and rhinitis (11.8%). There were no deaths during the 
study. Five (14.7%) subjects experienced 5 serious adverse events, none of which were considered 
related to Zonegran treatment. A total of 8 (23.5%) subjects withdrew from the study due to adverse 
events. The adverse events that led to subject withdrawal also appeared consistent with the adverse 
event profile in the current Zonegran prescribing information. There were no apparent effects of 
Zonegran therapy on vital signs or laboratory values. Changes in physical exam findings from the 
Screening Visit to the end of the study may be more likely to be an indication of the underlying 
disease of diabetic neuropathy than an effect of Zonegran therapy. 
Conclusion: Zonegran appeared safe and well tolerated in this patient population. The results of 
this trial suggest that further evaluation of Zonegran in subjects with neuropathic pain is warranted, 
since treatment generally resulted in improvement in pain scores and some subjects clearly 
demonstrated a positive clinical response during therapy. 
CHMP COMMENTS: 
•  The conclusions of the MAH are endorsed. 
•  This study was a small, open label study with no placebo or active comparator. 
•  The age of the study population was 12 years and older and it is not clear how 
many of the subjects were in the paediatric population. 
•  As discussed by the MAH, further evaluation of Zonegran in patients with 
neuropathic pain is warranted. 
•  As discussed in studies 720-02385-96, 720-02385-96EXT, ZNS-401 and 
ZNS-501, following assessment of this study, the adverse event of headache 
should be added to the product information for Zonegran. 
CHMP CONCLUSIONS: 
•  Following assessment of these 8 studies, overall, the conclusions of the MAH 
are endorsed. 
•  Following assessment of studies 720-02385-96, 720-02385-96EXT, ZNS-401, 
ZNS-501 and ZNS-503, the adverse event of headache should be added to the 
product information of Zonegran and the MAH is requested to submit a Type 
Zonegran

II variation to do so. 
•  Following assessment of studies 720-02385-96 and 720-02385-96EXT, the 
adverse event of rhinitis should be added to the product information of 
Zonegran and the MAH is requested to submit a Type II variation to do so. 
•  These studies are mainly small and are open label with no placebo or active 
• 
comparator arms and so results should be interpreted with caution. 
In some of these studies the study population is 12 years of age and upwards 
and it is unclear as to how many of the study subjects are in the paediatric / 
adolescent population. 
•  None of these 8 studies discussed in this Assessment Report have any data on 
the long term use of zonisamide in the paediatric population, nor on the effect 
of zonisamide on the growth and development of children, nor on the effect of 
zonisamide on puberty. 
•  Further research and studies would be required to support an indication for 
• 
zonisamide in the paediatric population. 
It is noted that there is currently a study ongoing (E2090-044-312) to further 
investigate the use of zonisamide in the paediatric and adolescent population, 
the final clinical study report of which is expected in January 2011. This date 
is an estimate based on predicted recruitment rate and could move 6 months 
either way.

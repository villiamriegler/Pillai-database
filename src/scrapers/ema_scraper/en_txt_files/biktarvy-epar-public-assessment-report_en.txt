2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
HIV-1 infection is a blood-born infection. HIV is a retrovirus that infects and replicates primarily in 
human CD4+ T cells and macrophages. HIV can be transmitted via blood, blood products, sexual 
fluids, other fluids containing blood, and breast milk. Most individuals are infected with HIV through 
sexual contact, before birth or during delivery, during breast-feeding, or when sharing contaminated 
needles and syringes (intravenous drug users). Sexual intercourse is the most common, albeit 
inefficient, mode of HIV transmission. The risk of transmission per exposure is low; estimates are on 
the order of 0.1% per contact for heterosexual transmission, but this varies considerably and increases 
with concurrent ulcerative STDs, high HIV viral load in the subject, and lack of antiretroviral therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
There are approximately 37 million people worldwide living with HIV-1. HIV-1 infection remains a life-
threatening disease in infected persons who do not receive adequate treatment sufficiently early in the 
course of the infection and/or are infected with virus that is resistant to anti-retroviral agents of 
several classes such that an adequate treatment regimen cannot be constructed from approved 
agents. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Acute HIV-1 infection is often missed, as it usually presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms 
(including fever, rash, or diarrhoea), or goes without clinical symptoms. If symptoms are present, 
these generally emerge approximately 2 weeks following HIV infection. Among those presenting with 
symptoms, the number of symptoms correlates with higher pre-seroconversion peak plasma viral load. 
Diagnosis most often occurs during chronic infection. Recent estimates suggest that even in high 
income settings; about 25-35% of people living with HIV starting ART have a CD4 cell count of less 
than 200 cells/mm3. In some settings, up to half of people present to care with advanced HIV disease 
– defined by WHO as having a CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3 or a WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease.  
Most HIV-infected individuals will eventually develop progressive immunodeficiency marked by CD4 T 
lymphocyte (CD4) cell depletion and leading to AIDS-defining illnesses and premature death, if remain 
untreated. Leading causes of mortality among adults with advanced HIV disease globally include 
tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis and Pneumocystis 
jirovecii pneumonia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
Page 11/104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Diagnostic tests for HIV-1 infection include assays for HIV-1 RNA, p24 antigen, and HIV-1 and HIV-2 
antibodies. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Standard of care for the treatment of HIV-1 infection uses combination ART to suppress viral 
replication to below detectable limits, allow CD4 cell counts to increase, and stop disease progression. 
For ART-naive HIV-infected patients, current treatment guidelines suggest that initial therapy consists 
of 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs) and either an integrase strand transfer 
inhibitor (INSTI), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), rilpivirine, or the boosted 
protease inhibitor (PI), darunavir (DRV). Virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients may switch 
from their current regimen because of safety or tolerability concerns or for regimen simplification. All 
patient populations may benefit from once-daily FDC regimens as these have been shown to provide 
increased adherence and improved clinical and virologic outcomes. 
Integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTI), such as raltegravir (RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG), exhibit 
strong antiviral activity, good clinical tolerability and have become attractive options as third agents in 
combination therapy for HIV-1 infected patients. Both RAL and EVG have relatively short human half-
lives and must be administered twice daily (BID) (for RAL) or in combination with a boosting agent (for 
EVG) for once daily (QD) administration. The most recently approved INSTI, dolutegravir (DTG), has a 
PK profile that allows administration once a day (QD) without a boosting agent; however, BID dosing is 
recommended when DTG is co-administered with CYP and/or UGT inducers (e.g., EFV, fos-AMP/r, 
TPV/r, or rifampin) and in patients with INSTI associated resistance substitutions or clinically suspected 
INSTI resistance. Dolutegravir is available as a fixed dose combination with abacavir and lamivudine 
and is currently used as first line therapy. The new fixed dose combination with Bictegravir as INSTI 
contains tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and emtricitabine as a backbone. 
About the product 
Bictegravir is a potent INSTI that is being evaluated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and that has 
demonstrated a terminal half-life suitable for once-daily administration without a boosting agent.  
Emtricitabine and TAF form a guideline-recommended N(t)RTI backbone for ART-naïve HIV-infected 
patients. Tenofovir alafenamide is also approved as a single agent for the treatment of chronic 
hepatitis B infection, and F/TAF is a guideline-recommended backbone for patients co-infected with HIV 
and hepatitis B virus (HBV). 
B/F/TAF is a potent, convenient, tolerable, and practical regimen for the long-term treatment of 
patients with HIV infection. The small tablet size of the FDC is expected to provide an additional 
benefit, especially in patients for whom pill swallowing can be a barrier to treatment compliance, (eg, 
the elderly). Based on the clinical studies performed within this application, the Applicant claims that:  
- High rates of virologic suppression with B/F/TAF in studies of ART-naive subjects and those switching 
therapy 
- No subject in the Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies developed treatment-emergent resistance to any 
component of B/F/TAF 
- B/F/TAF is generally safe and well tolerated in HIV-infected subjects

- The bone and renal safety profiles of B/F/TAF are comparable with those of abacavir 
(ABC)/DTG/lamivudine (3TC) 
The Applicant’s proposed indication was: 
TRADENAME is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 
(HIV-1) without any known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components 
The Applicant’s proposed posology was: 
One tablet to be taken once daily in adults.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Emtricitabine (FTC) 
The information on chemistry, manufacturing and control of emtricitabine active substance has been 
assessed previously via the centralised procedure and approved in the EU as part of the marketing 
authorisations for Emtriva, Truvada, Atripla, Eviplera, Stribild, Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey. 
The Module 3.2.S sections of the dossier for emtricitabine provided by the applicant are identical to the 
3.2.S sections submitted and approved with the aforementioned marketing authorisations. 
General information 
The chemical name of emtricitabine is 4-amino-5-fluoro-1-[(2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-
5-yl]-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one corresponding to the molecular formula C8H10FN3O3S. It has a 
relative molecular mass of 247.24 g/mol and the following structure (figure 1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
Page 13/104 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: emtricitabine structure 
The structure of emtricitabine was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single 
crystal x-ray determination. 
Emtricitabine appears as a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder, freely soluble in 
methanol and water. Its pKa is 2.65 and the partition coefficient Log P is -0.43. It has 2 chiral centres 
at carbons 2 and 5 of the oxathiolane ring. Two enantiomeric pairs of diastereomers can exist: cis-(-)-
FTC and cis-(+)-FTC, trans-(-)-FTC and trans-(+)-FTC. The synthetic route has been chosen to be 
stereoselective for the formation of the desired cis-(-) enantiomer, emtricitabine. Three polymorphs of 
emtricitabine have been observed. However, the most stable thermodynamically form at room 
temperature, is consistently produced. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Emtricitabine is manufactured by two possible synthetic routes sharing a common first step and 
followed by two options comprising either one or two extra steps. The synthesis was described in 
sufficient detail. 
The synthetic process results in the stereoselective formation of an intermediate and thus the 
formation of the desired emtricitabine enantiomer. Five manufacturing sites are involved. Adequate in-
process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The process has been 
shown to consistently produce emtricitabine that meets the required quality standards. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  double polyethylene  (PE)  bags  inside  HDPE  drums  which  comply 
with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
Emtricitabine specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification (IR, HPLC), 
clarity of solution (visual), water content (Ph. Eur.), enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), and 
particle size (Laser Light Scattering). Analytical methods have been validated in accordance with ICH 
guidelines. The testing and the proposed limits applied, conform to current ICH guidelines and are 
acceptable from a toxicological and clinical perspective. 
Extended testing during development has demonstrated that only a single polymorphic form results 
from the synthetic process of emtricitabine. Therefore as per ICH Q6A, testing for polymorphic form at 
release is not necessary. Development data demonstrate the absence of indicator organisms and 
therefore, as per ICH Q6, microbial testing of the active substance is not required. Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used for assay testing has been presented.

Batch analysis data on 22 commercial scale batches of emtricitabine from all proposed manufacturers 
were provided. The results comply with the specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of 
the manufacturing process. 
Stability 
Stability  data  from  3  production  scale  batches  of  finished  product  covering  both  manufacturers  and 
processes stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) according to the 
ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  were  packaged  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for 
marketing.  Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  impurity  content  and  water  content.  No 
changes  were  observed  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters  over  time,  and  no  trends  were  visible. 
Emtricitabine is known not to be photosensitive. 
Based on the long-term stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage conditions when 
emtricitabine is packed in the proposed packaging materials is considered acceptable. 
Tenofovir Alafenamide Fumarate (TAF Fumarate) 
The information on chemistry, manufacturing and control of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate has been 
assessed previously via the centralised procedure and approved in the EU as part of the marketing 
authorisations Descovy, Genvoya, Odefsey, Vemlidy and Symtuza. 
The Module 3.2.S sections of the dossier for tenofovir alafenamide fumarate provided by the applicant 
are identical to the 3.2.S sections submitted and approved within the aforementioned marketing 
authorisations. 
General information 
The chemical name of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is propan-2-yl N-[(S)-({[(2R)-1-(6-amino-9H-
purin-9-yl)propan-2-yl]-oxy}methyl)(phenoxy)phosphoryl]-L-alaninate, (2E)-but-2-enedioate (2:1) 
corresponding to the molecular formula C 23H31N6O7P. It has a relative molecular mass of 534.5 g/mol 
and the following structure (Figure 2): 
Figure 2: tenofovir alafenamide fumarate structure 
The chemical structure of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate has been adequately demonstrated by 
infrared spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, and 31P), mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, 
ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. 
The active substance is a white to off-white or tan, slightly hygroscopic powder. Tenofovir alafenamide 
fumarate is a BCS Class III compound, with pH-dependent aqueous. solubility decreasing with

increasing basicity. It is soluble at low pH (pH 2.0), sparingly soluble at pH 3.8, and slightly soluble at 
pH values up to 8.0. Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is freely soluble in methanol, soluble in ethanol, 
sparingly soluble in isopropanol and slightly soluble in acetone. 
Tenofovir alafenamide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of three chiral centres. The chiral 
centre at the propyloxy- side chain is in the R-configuration. The absolute stereoconfiguration of the 
carbonylethylamino- substituent is derived from the amino acid L-alanine, which has the S-
configuration at the alpha-carbon. The remaining stereocentre is located at the phosphorus atom and 
is in the S- configuration. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC at the point of the 
introduction of the chiral starting material and in a manufacturing process intermediate. 
Polymorphism has been observed for tenofovir alafenamide fumarate. A single polymorphic form is 
consistently generated through the manufacturing process and this form has been adequately 
characterised. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is obtained from two manufacturers using the same synthetic route. 
The active substance is synthesized in multiple steps using well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Potential and actual 
impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
Critical process parameters and material attributes were identified using a risk assessment approach. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have 
been justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is 
considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in double-lined polyethylene bags which comply with the EC directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. The bags are held in high-density polyethylene drums (or 
other suitable secondary container) with lids of appropriate size and fitted with a security seal. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances.  
Specification 
The specification for tenofovir alafenamide fumarate includes tests for appearance (visual 
examination), identity (IR, HPLC), identity of fumaric acid (HPLC), clarity of solution (visual 
examination), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC, HPLC-MS, GC), residual 
solvents (GC), elemental impurities (ICP MS), and melting point (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standard used for assay testing has been presented.

Batch analysis data from 16 batches of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate, (13 of which were commercial 
scale and 3 pilot scale), manufactured at both proposed manufacturing sites were provided. Additional 
batch analysis data for development batches used in pre-clinical pharmacokinetics and toxicological 
studies were also provided. The results were within the specifications and consistent from batch to 
batch. 
The tenofovir alafenamide fumarate specifications are based on the active substance critical quality 
attributes (CQA). 
Stability 
Stability data on 6 commercial scale batches of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate from the both 
proposed manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long 
term conditions at 5 ºC and for up to 24 months under accelerated conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Results under stressed conditions for up to 6 months at 
40 ºC / 75% RH on 5 batches were provided. Additionally, results for 4 days at 60 ºC / ambient RH, for 
4 days at 50 ºC / ambient RH and for 4 days at -20 ºC were also provided on one batch. 
Samples were tested for appearance, impurities, assay, water content, and solid state characteristics 
(XRD and melting point). The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
indicating. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch, indicating that the 
active substance is not photosensitive. 
The stability results indicate that tenofovir alafenamide fumarate manufactured by the both proposed 
suppliers is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed re-test period at the 
recommended long-term storage condition in the proposed container. 
Bictegravir sodium (BIC) 
Bictegravir sodium is a new active substance. Information is provided by the applicant in a full module 
3.2.S. 
General information 
The chemical name of bictegravir sodium is sodium (2R,5S,13aR)-7,9-dioxo-10-[(2,4,6-
trifluorobenzyl)carbamoyl]-2,3,4,5,7,9,13,13a-octahydro-2,5-methanopyrido[1',2':4,5]pyrazino[2,1-
b][1,3]oxazepin-8-olate corresponding to the molecular formula C21H17F3N3NaO5. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 471.4 g/mol and the following structure (figure 3): 
Figure 3: bictegravir sodium structure 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
Page 17/104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The chemical structure of bictegravir sodium was elucidated by a combination of 1H, 13C and 19F NMR 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, UV and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and x-ray 
crystallography. 
Bictegravir sodium contains 3 chiral centres. Overall stereochemistry is tested in the active substance 
by chiral HPLC before release. 
The solid state properties of bictegravir sodium were established by x-ray powder diffraction, 
differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic vapour sorption. The active substance is an off-white to 
yellow slightly hygroscopic crystalline solid. Only 1 polymorphic form was identified during 
development. It is practically insoluble in aqueous media across the physiological pH range, including 
simulated fed and fasted state intestinal fluids, and very slightly soluble at pH 8.8. Particle size is 
limited in the active substance specification. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Bictegravir sodium is synthesized in multiple steps using well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. The starting materials were justified in line with the expectations in ICH Q11 
and its Q&A and are deemed acceptable. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The process was optimised through a 
series of univariate and multivariate experiments, informed by risk assessment as to which steps were 
likely to be most critical. Operational ranges and set-points are defined for each step of the 
manufacturing process and are justified by the data provided. No design spaces are claimed. 
Detailed information on the origin, fate and purge of impurities was provided in order to justify limits 
for impurities in the starting materials, intermediates, and the active substance. A risk assessment for 
mutagenic impurities was carried out in line with ICH M7. One impurity with a structural alert was 
shown to be negative in an Ames test. Another known mutagenic impurity was consistently found in an 
intermediate at levels well below 30% of the TTC and is thus controlled according to ICH M7 option 4. 
The specifications and control methods for intermediates, starting materials and reagents have been 
presented and are deemed acceptable. 
The active substance is packaged in double PE bags, inside an HDPE drum, which comply with the EC 
directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), clarity of solution 
(visual inspection), water content (KF), sodium content (HPLC-CAD), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), 
residual solvents and organic volatile impurities (GC), enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC) and particle 
size (laser light scattering). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. A risk assessment and 
batch analysis carried out for the finished product in line with ICH Q3D demonstrated that no test for 
elemental impurities, other than the sodium content, is needed. The active substance has low water 
activity and no significant bioburden was noted during release testing and stability studies so no test 
for microbiological quality is included. Only 1 polymorphic form has been identified, which is stable and 
routinely produced by the manufacturing process as determined by XRPD, so no test is needed. 
Assessment report

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 22 lab, pilot and production scale batches of bictegravir sodium covering both 
manufacturers and an additional manufacturer used in early development, were provided. These 
included the 3 productions scale validation batches from each manufacturer. The results were within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 8 pilot scale batches of active substance covering both proposed manufacturers, 
and an additional manufacturer used in early development, stored in the intended commercial package 
for up to 24 months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Samples were 
tested for appearance, assay, related substances, water content, enantiomeric purity, polymorphic 
form and microbial purity. No significant changes were noted over time and all parameters remained 
within specification throughout the study period. In addition, studies have begun using the 3 process 
validation batches from each proposed commercial manufacturer which will be tested according to the 
accepted protocol. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. Bictegravir sodium is 
not photosensitive. 
Samples were also stored at either -20 or 60 oC for up to 2 weeks. No changes to any of the measured 
parameters were observed. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period when stored at the 
recommended long term storage condition in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Biktarvy is a fixed dose combination, immediate release, film-coated tablet containing bictegravir 
sodium, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate as active substances. The tablets are 
purplish-brown capsule-shaped, and debossed with GSI on one face and “9883” on the other. 
Bictegravir sodium is a crystalline, stable, BCS class II compound exhibiting low solubility but high 
permeability. Emtricitabine is a crystalline BCS class I compound with high solubility and permeability 
which degrades by hydrolysis in aqueous solution and to a much smaller degree, in the solid phase. 
TAF fumarate is a BCS class III molecule, highly soluble but poorly permeable, which undergoes pH-
dependent hydrolysis in aqueous solution. 
The formulation evolved throughout development. The commercial formulation is the same as that 
used in phase III clinical trials, which was shown to be equivalent to earlier clinical formulations by 
suitable bridging studies. 
The choice of manufacturing process and excipients was based on the properties of the active 
substances. Process parameters for the film-coating process are considered suitable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
Page 19/104 
 
 
 
 
 
The development of the dissolution method took into account the differing solubilities and stabilities of 
the 3 active substances. Emtricitabine and TAF fumarate are soluble in aqueous media, whereas 
bictegravir is poorly soluble in aqueous media across the physiological pH range. However, TAF 
fumarate is unstable below pH 5 and above pH 6, so a medium with pH 5.5 was selected. 
Various manufacturing parameters with potential to impact the dissolution rate were examined during 
development and have been set at levels guaranteed to produce Biktarvy tablets of the required 
quality. The dissolution method was developed in order to identify tablets manufactured outside of the 
defined process and its discriminatory power is considered adequate. 
The manufacturing development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design of 
experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. The risk 
identification was based on the prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and 
manufacturing processes as well as on the experience from formulation development and process 
design. The critical process parameters have been adequately identified. No design space is claimed. 
All excipients other than the Opadry film coat are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their 
quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. Opadry is commercially available and the constituent 
ingredients are of compendial grade. The colourants comply with directive 2009/35/EC. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The primary packaging is a white HDPE bottle with polypropylene continuous-thread, child-resistant 
cap, lined with an induction activated aluminium foil liner. Each bottle contains silica gel desiccant and 
a polyester coil. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is carried out at 2 different sites and consists of production of final blends 
by  granulation,  milling  and  lubrication  followed  by  tabletting.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a 
standard manufacturing process. 
It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of producing  finished  product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. A process validation protocol has been provided, explaining 
how  validation  will  be  carried  out  at  both  manufacturing  sites  on  full  production  scale  prior  to 
commercialization.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process  and 
pharmaceutical form, and suitable limits have been set for the individual tests. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  comprise  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
including  appearance,  identity  (UV,  UPLC),  water  content  (KF),  assay  (UPLC),  degradation  products 
(UPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (UPLC) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The limits for impurities have been justified 7 batches of finished product were analysed for all class 1, 
class 2A and selected class 3 elemental impurities as defined in ICH Q3D. The amount of each tested 
element was well below 30% of the PDE and this justifies their omission from the finished product 
specification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 14 pilot to production scale batches confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 pilot scale batches of finished product from each manufacturer stored for up to 12 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), up to 12 months under intermediate conditions 
(30 ºC / 75% RH), and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to 
the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  medicinal  product  are  representative  of  those 
proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing.  Samples 
were  tested 
for  appearance,  water  content,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution  and 
microbiological  quality.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  No  significant  changes 
to any of the measured parameters were observed. 
In  addition,  1  batch  was  exposed to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline on  Photostability  Testing  of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The results indicate that the product is photostable. 
Stressed  studies  were  carried  out  on  another  batch,  stored  at  either  -20  oC  or  50  oC  for  1  week  at 
ambient humidity. No significant changes were observed. 
An in-use stability study was carried out on 1 batch of product. Bottles were stored at 30 oC / 75% RH 
with  the  induction  seals  removed.  One  tablet  was  removed  each  day  for  30  days  to  simulate  the 
recommended  dosing  regimen.  No  significant  changes  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters  were 
observed. 
Based on available stability data the proposed shelf-life of 24 months stored in the original container 
with the lid tightly closed in order to protect from moisture as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 
6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. The magnesium stearate is of 
vegetal origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The control strategy, combining a mixture of process parameters and release tests, is considered 
sufficient to ensure the quality of the product. No design spaces are claimed.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The definitive safety pharmacology, toxicology, and toxicokinetic studies provided for BIC, FTC, and 
TAF were conducted in accordance with guidelines issued by the International Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) and with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) or other applicable regulations 
promulgated by international health authorities. Pilot, exploratory, and mechanistic studies were either 
conducted in full compliance with GLP procedures or were conducted using appropriate protocols and 
documentation to assure data integrity. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Brief summary 
BIC 
Bictegravir is a potent investigational integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI) with in vitro activity 
against wild-type HIV-1 and HIV-1 with INSTI-resistance associated mutations. Bictegravir inhibits HIV 
integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle, demonstrating 
high potency and selectivity in antiviral assays. Bictegravir displays a high resistance barrier and has 
an improved phenotypic resistance profile compared to dolutegravir (DTG), raltegravir (RAL) and 
elvitegravir (EVG; E). Bictegravir has a longer dissociation half-life from both wild-type and mutant 
HIV-1 integrase/DNA complexes compared with DTG, RAL, and EVG.

FTC 
Emtricitabine (FTC) is a NRTI and a (-) enantiomer of a thio analogue of cytidine, which differs from 
other cytidine analogues in that it has a fluorine in the 5-position. Intracellularly, FTC is 
phosphorylated by enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate (FTC-TP), the active metabolite. 
Emtricitabine is an NRTI that has activity against HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Following 
absorption, FTC is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to emtricitabine triphosphate (FTC-TP), the 
active metabolite, an analog of 2’-deoxycytidine triphosphate. Emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate inhibits the 
activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase through high-affinity binding, competing with the natural 
substrate 2’-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate. Emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate is efficiently incorporated into 
the nascent viral DNA chain by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase resulting in termination of DNA synthesis 
due to the lack of a hydroxyl group at the 3’- position of the sugar moiety of FTC, which in turn inhibits 
viral replication. In a clinical study, the intracellular half-life of FTC-TP in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) was 39 hours. Intracellular triphosphate levels increased with dose but reached a plateau 
at doses of 200 mg or greater. Emtricitabine has activity against retroviruses and hepadnaviruses. 
Figure 5.  Chemical structure of FTC 
TAF 
Tenofovir alafenamide is a prodrug of tenofovir (TFV), a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(NtRTI). After absorption, TAF is converted to TFV intracellularly, which is phosphorylated to the active 
metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) (Robbins 1998). Tenofovir diphosphate is a very weak 
inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α, β, δ, and ε and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase γ. 
Cells are permeable to TAF and, due to increased plasma stability and intracellular activation through 
hydrolysis by cathepsin A, TAF is more efficient than TDF in loading tenofovir into PBMCs (including 
lymphocytes and other HIV target cells) and macrophages. Intracellular tenofovir is subsequently 
phosphorylated to the pharmacologically active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir 
diphosphate inhibits HIV and HBV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV-1 or HBV 
reverse transcriptase, which results in DNA chain-termination.

B/F/TAF 
The proposed FDC is based on the complimentary pharmacology of BIC, FTC and TAF and the body of 
clinical experience with INSTI or N[t]RTIs in HIV-infected patients. Combinations of these agents in 
cell-based in vitro assays show favourable anti-HIV activity and no evidence for antagonism. The anti-
HIV-1 activity of 3-drug combination of BIC, FTC, and TAF was found to be highly synergistic with no 
evidence of antagonism in vitro, supporting the use of these agents in combination in HIV-1 infected 
patients.  The resistance profiles of the individual agents BIC, FTC, and TAF are distinct and non-
overlapping. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
BIC 
Bictegravir is a novel strand transfer inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase with high potency and selectivity in 
antiviral assays and does not require metabolic modification to exert ARV activity. Using 
lymphoblastoid T-cell lines and primary human T-lymphocytes in HIV-1 antiviral assays, the estimated 
concentration of drug for a half-maximal response (EC50) of BIC ranged from 1.5 to 2.4 nM and the 
selectivity indices ranged from 1500 to 8800. When tested in primary human PBMCs against clinical 
isolates of all HIV-1 groups (M, N, O), including subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, BIC displayed similar 
antiviral activity across all clinical isolates with mean and median EC50 values of 0.60 and 0.55 nM, 
respectively, based on a range of EC50 values between < 0.05 and 1.71 nM. HIV-2 was similarly 
susceptible to BIC with an EC50 value of 1.1 nM. Bictegravir is a specific inhibitor of HIV with no 
measurable antiviral activity against non-HIV viruses, including HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), 
influenzas A and B, human rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).  
Bictegravir maintained potent antiviral activity against HIV-1 variants resistant to currently approved 
ARVs from the NRTI, NNRTI, and protease inhibitor (PI) classes. Bictegravir displays a resistance 
profile similar to that of dolutegravir (DTG) and markedly improved compared with that of raltegravir 
(RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG; E). Bictegravir maintained full activity against clonal isolates from 
virologic failures treated with Stribild. Bictegravir had an improved resistance profile compared to EVG, 
RAL, and DTG in patient isolates, particularly for isolates with high-level INSTI resistance containing 
combinations of mutations such as E92Q + N155H or G140C/S + Q148R/H/K ± additional INSTI 
mutations, and may have unmet clinical utility in these patients. Bictegravir had a longer dissociation 
half-life from HIV-1 integrase-DNA complexes compared with DTG, RAL, and EVG. 
HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to BIC have been selected in cell culture. These selections 
showed that BIC displayed a comparable barrier to resistance emergence as DTG, and a higher barrier 
than EVG. Bictegravir selected the M50I + R263K combination and S153F with a transient T66I 
substitution in HIV-1 integrase. The R263K single mutant and M50I + R263K double mutant viruses 
had low-level reduced susceptibility to BIC, but the single M50I mutant was fully sensitive to BIC. The 
M50I + R263K selected variants exhibited low-level cross-resistance to RAL and DTG and intermediate 
cross-resistance to EVG but remained susceptible to other classes of ARVs. The effect of the T66I and 
S153F/Y single mutants and the T66I + S153F double mutant in integrase on BIC susceptibility was 
minimal. 
Similar to a number of other ARV agents, the in vitro activity of BIC was reduced in the presence of 
human serum due to significant protein binding. Bictegravir exhibited approximately 70-fold increase in 
the EC50 value in the presence of 100% serum relative to its activity in cell culture medium. The 95% 
effective concentration (EC95) calculated from the high density antiviral dose response was used in

conjunction with the human serum shift determined by equilibrium dialysis to calculate the protein-
adjusted EC95 (PAEC95) of 361 nM. 
FTC 
Emtricitabine, an NRTI, is a synthetic analogue of the naturally occurring pyrimidine nucleoside, 2′-
deoxycytidine. Intracellularly, FTC is converted through 3 phosphorylation reactions to its active tri-
phosphorylated anabolite emtricitabine 5′-triphosphate (FTC-TP) [Furman 1992, Paff 1994]. 
Emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate inhibits the activity of viral polymerases, including HIV-1 RT by direct 
binding competition with the natural deoxyribonucleotide substrate (deoxycytidine triphosphate) and 
by being incorporated into nascent viral DNA, which results in chain termination {Wilson 1993}. FTC 
has activity that is specific to HIV (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and HBV. The EC50 of FTC against laboratory 
adapted strains of HIV-1 ranged from 0.001 to 0.62 µM depending on cell type and virus strain used in 
the assay [Jeong 1993, Painter 1995, Schinazi 1992]. With clinical isolates of HIV-1, EC50 values 
ranged from 0.002 to 0.028 μM [Schinazi 1992]. Emtricitabine 5’-triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of 
mammalian DNA polymerases α, β, and ε and mtDNA polymerase γ [Painter 1995]. There was no 
evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo. 
The antiviral activity of FTC against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in 
lymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI-CCR5 cell line, and PBMCs. The EC50 values for FTC were in the 
range of 0.001 to 0.62 μM. FTC displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, 
D, E, F, G, and O (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 0.140 μM) and showed activity against HIV-2 
(EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 1.5 μM).  
HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to FTC have been selected in cell culture. Reduced 
susceptibility to FTC was associated with M184V/I mutations in HIV-1 RT. 
TAF 
TAF is a phosphonamidate prodrug of TFV (2’-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analogue). Cells are 
permeable to TAF, and due to increased plasma stability and intracellular activation through hydrolysis 
by cathepsin A, TAF is more efficient than TDF in loading TFV into PBMCs, including T cells and 
macrophages [Birkus 2008, Birkus 2007]. Intracellular TFV is subsequently phosphorylated to the 
pharmacologically active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) [Robbins 1998]. Tenofovir 
diphosphate inhibits HIV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV RT, which results 
in DNA chain-termination [Cherrington 1995, Yokota 1994]. Tenofovir has activity that is specific to 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and HBV [Delaney 2006, Kalayjian 2003, Lee 2005]. 
In vitro studies have shown that both FTC and TFV can be fully phosphorylated when combined in cells. 
Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases that include mtDNA 
polymerase γ [Cherrington 1994, Kramata 1998], and there is no evidence of mitochondrial toxicity in 
vitro based on several assays including mtDNA analyses [Birkus 2002, Stray 2017]. 
The antiviral activity of TAF against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtype B was assessed in 
lymphoblastoid cell lines, PBMCs, primary monocyte/macrophage cells, and CD4-T lymphocytes. The 
EC50 values for TAF were in the range of 2.0 to 14.7 nM. TAF displayed antiviral activity in cell culture 
against all HIV-1 groups (M, N, O), including subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged 
from 0.10 to 12.0 nM) and activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.91 to 2.63 nM) (m2.6.3, 
Section 1.3, PC-120-2004). The antiviral activity of two TAF metabolites, M18 (GS-645552; 
isopropylalaninyl TFV) and M28 (GS-652829; alaninyl TFV), were evaluated in two T-lymphoblastoid 
cell lines (MT-2 and MT-4) following 5 days of compound exposure. GS-645552 is also a drug product

degradant. Both metabolites showed weak inhibition of HIV-1 replication with 1723 to 2630-fold lower 
inhibitory potency relative to TAF (EC50 values of 7.41 to 21.0 μM) for metabolite M28 and 121 to 
130-fold lower inhibitor potency relative to TAF (EC50 values of 0.56 to 0.97 μM) for metabolite M18.  
HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to TAF have been selected in cell culture. HIV-1 isolates 
selected by TAF expressed a K65R mutation in HIV-1 RT; in addition, a K70E mutation in HIV-1 RT has 
been transiently observed [Margot 2006]. HIV-1 isolates with the K65R mutation have low-level 
reduced susceptibility to abacavir, FTC, TFV, and lamivudine (LAM) [Kagan 2007, Margot 2006]. In 
vitro drug resistance selection studies with TAF have shown no development of high-level resistance 
after extended time in culture. 
Tenofovir has activity that is specific to HBV in addition to HIV-1 and HIV-2. The antiviral activity of 
TAF against a panel of HBV clinical isolates representing genotypes A-H was assessed in HepG2 cells. 
The EC50 values for TAF ranged from 34.7 to 134.4 nM, with an overall mean EC50 of 86.6 nM. The 
concentration that resulted in 50% cytotoxicity (CC50) in HepG2 cells was >44,400 nM. The 
combination of TFV and FTC was studied for cytotoxicity in MT-2 cells. No cytotoxicity was observed at 
the highest concentrations tested, up to 50 μM TFV and 5 μM FTC. Cytotoxicity studies were also 
conducted on the combination of TFV and FTC in HepG2 cells and no cytotoxicity was observed. 
The antiviral activity of TAF was evaluated against a panel of HBV isolates containing nucleos(t)ide RT 
inhibitor mutations in HepG2 cells. HBV isolates expressing the rtV173L, rtL180M, and rtM204V/I 
substitutions associated with resistance to LAM remained susceptible to TAF (< 2-fold change in EC50). 
HBV isolates expressing the rtL180M, rtM204V plus rtT184G, rtS202G, or rtM250V substitutions 
associated with resistance to entecavir remained susceptible to TAF. HBV isolates expressing the 
rtA181T, rtA181V, or rtN236T single substitutions associated with resistance to adefovir remained 
susceptible to TAF; however, the HBV isolate expressing rtA181V plus rtN236T exhibited reduced 
susceptibility to TAF (3.7-fold change in EC50). The clinical relevance of these substitutions is not 
known. 
 B/F/TAF 
Bictegravir, FTC, and TAF are potent and selective inhibitors of HIV-1. All 3 drugs show potent ARV 
activity against diverse subtypes of HIV-1 in vitro. Emtricitabine and TFV are phosphorylated 
intracellularly through non-overlapping pathways, and in combination show no antagonism for the 
formation of their active metabolites. Bictegravir does not require metabolic modification for activity. 
The anti-HIV-1 activity of the 3-drug combination of BIC, FTC, and TAF was found to be highly 
synergistic with no evidence of antagonism in vitro, supporting the use of these agents in combination 
in HIV-1 infected patients. In addition, in vitro combination studies have shown that in 2-drug 
combination studies BIC, FTC, and TFV have additive to synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity with other 
approved NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs [Hill 1997, Miller 1999, Rimsky 2001]. The resistance profiles of the 
individual agents BIC, TFV, and FTC are distinct and non-overlapping.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Cytotoxicity 
BIC 
For BIC, the concentration that resulted in 50% cytotoxicity (CC50) in primary CD4+ T-lymphocytes, 
MT-4, MT-2, resting and activated PBMCs, and monocyte-derived macrophages cells ranged from of 
3700 to 29800 nM. 
FTC 
The cytotoxicity of FTC has been evaluated extensively in vitro. In all the cell lines examined, cell 
growth was not affected at concentrations of FTC≥ 100 µM (Schinazi 1994, Van Draanen 1994, Furman 
1992). 
TAF 
Both TAF and its metabolites M18 and M28 had no cytotoxicity up to the highest tested concentration 
(57 μM). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
BIC 
Bictegravir was evaluated in safety pharmacology studies of the central nervous system (CNS), 
respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. At the highest doses tested, BIC had no effects on the central 
nervous and respiratory systems of rats (300 mg/kg), no effects on the cardiovascular system of 
monkeys (1000 mg/kg), and no notable inhibition of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) 
potassium channel current at a concentration > 7.1 µM. Plasma exposures (free [unbound] Cmax) in 
the in vivo studies were at least 0.92-fold (rats) and 22-fold (monkeys) of the free BIC Cmax 
concentration following clinical administration of the B/F/TAF fixed-dose combination (FDC). In the 
hERG study, exposures were at least 200-fold above free BIC Cmax concentration following clinical 
administration of the B/F/TAF FDC. 
FTC 
A comprehensive range of safety pharmacology studies revealed no treatment-related adverse effects 
on any organ system at systemic exposure levels much higher than those anticipated in patients at the 
recommended clinical dose (10- to more than 50-fold). 
No effects on the CV system were reported in anesthetized dogs administered a cumulative dose of 
38.5 mg/kg of FTC intravenously over a 1-hour period. In addition, there were no abnormalities 
reported on the electrocardiogram (ECG) data obtained from the repeated-dose toxicity studies in 
monkeys, where plasma AUC exposures were up to 26-fold higher than in humans administered the 
200-mg dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018

TAF 
Tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated in safety pharmacology studies of the rat central nervous, renal, 
gastrointestinal (GI), and CV systems. In vivo safety pharmacology experiments were conducted using 
TAF as the monofumarate form in 50 mM citric acid. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for the 
inhibitory effect of TAF on hERG potassium current was estimated to be > 10 μM, far above human 
plasma exposure. There were no adverse effects detected in the CNS in rats dosed at 1000 mg/kg or in 
the renal system in rats administered 1000 mg/kg. In the chronic repeat dose dog study, a dose-
related prolongation of PR interval was noted at Week 39; however, in the single dose CV safety 
pharmacology study in dogs dosed t 100 mg/kg (80 mg free base equivalents/kg), there were no 
findings. There was reduced gastric emptying in rats dosed at 1000 mg/kg but not at 100 mg/kg.  
B/F/TAF 
A comprehensive safety pharmacology program has been conducted for the 3 individual components of 
the B/F/TAF regimen. While the designs for these safety studies varied between the agents, the major 
organ systems were evaluated. Bictegravir had no effect on vital organ systems in safety 
pharmacology studies. Neither FTC nor TAF had clinically relevant effects on vital organ systems in 
safety pharmacology studies. Although TAF showed some potential to prolong the PR interval in the 
39-week dog study (TOX-120-002), no PR prolongation or any change in ECG results occurred in the 
CV safety pharmacology study r in the thorough QT study (GS-US-120-0107). Neither BIC nor FTC had 
an effect on PR interval in safety pharmacology studies; therefore, there is no potential for overlapping 
toxicity. Overall, the pharmacological assessment of BIC, FTC, and TAF supports the effective use of 
these 3 agents together in combination therapy for HIV-1 infection.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The anti-HIV-1 activity of 2-drug and 3-drug combinations of BIC, FTC, and TAF were found to be 
additive to highly synergistic with no evidence of antagonism in multiple in vitro assay systems, 
supporting the use of these agents in combination in HIV-infected patients. 
In vitro two-drug combination studies have shown that BIC has additive to synergistic anti- HIV-1 
activity with other approved NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, including synergistic activity with TAF, FTC, and 
darunavir (DRV). No antagonistic antiviral interaction was found between BIC and the tested clinically 
relevant classes of antiretrovirals. 
In two-drug combination studies of FTC with NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, and INSTIs, additive to synergistic 
effects were observed. No antagonism was observed for these combinations (Hill 1997, Rimsky 2001). 
Pharmacokinetics 
A comprehensive nonclinical program defining the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and 
drug  interaction  potential  of  BIC,  FTC  and  TAF/TFV  has  been  completed.  The  nonclinical 
pharmacokinetic  and  disposition  studies  discussed  in  this  section  provide  an  adequate  basis  for 
comparing and interpreting results from toxicology and clinical studies. 
Methods of analysis 
The plasma BIC concentrations in nonclinical PK studies in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and monkey were 
quantified  by  high-performance  liquid  chromatography-tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)  or  by 
liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to ultraviolet (UV) detection (LC-UV) methods. 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
Page 28/104 
 
 
 
 
 
FTC:  Analytical  methods  used  to  quantify  FTC  in  mouse,  rat,  and  monkey  plasma  from  the  early 
preclinical  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  studies  employed  reverse-phase  high 
performance  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC),  and  HPLC-MS  (plasma  and  urine).  LC-radio-profiling  has 
been utilised to detect [3H]FTC in mice and monkeys, and to detect [14C]FTC in rats and monkeys. 
TAF:  Levels  of  TAF  and  TFV  in  rats  and  dog  plasma  and  PBMCs  were  determined  using  fluorescence 
derivitization/HPLC. Additional methods to detect levels of TAF and TFV in mouse, rat, rabbit and dog 
plasma/PMBCs  included  validated  LC/MS/MS  methods,  and  HPLC  detection  methods.  The  absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion of TAF were assessed in various species following a single oral 
administration of [14C]TAF, and levels of TAF and its metabolites were measured using LSC, HPLC or 
LC/MS/MS coupled with flow-through detector (RFD). In vitro  determination of TAF levels were in the 
main  determined  by  LC/MS/MS,  with  some  LC-radio-profiling.  Induction  potential  of  TAF  on  CYP 
activity measured mRNA levels using qRT PCR methods. 
The bioanalytical methods are considered adequate. 
Absorption 
Bictegravir was absorbed quickly following oral solution administration, reaching maximal plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) within 4 hours post-dose. The oral bioavailability of BIC solution formulation was 
moderate to high (42% to 74%). 
Bictegravir was highly permeable and showed efflux transport in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Bictegravir 
was a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The PK of BIC was determined in male rats, dogs, and 
monkeys following administration of oral solutions. Bictegravir systemic plasma clearance was low in 
nonclinical species (0.1% to 1.3% of hepatic blood flow). Bictegravir volume of distribution (Vss; 0.09 
to 0.22 L/kg) in animals was lower than total body water. Bictegravir showed moderate to high oral 
bioavailability (42% to 74%) in nonclinical species. Bictegravir plasma exposure increased following 
repeat oral administration of BIC; the increases in Cmax and AUC were less than dose proportional. In 
rats, females had higher BIC Cmax and AUC0-24 values than males, with gender-based differences of 
2-to 3-fold on study days 90 and 181 for animals administered the high dose (300 mg/kg/day). In 
female rats administered the low dose (5 mg/kg/day), an accumulation (~ 3-fold) was observed. In 
monkeys, gender-based differences in BIC Cmax and AUC values were less than 2-fold and no 
accumulation (< 2-fold) of BIC was observed after repeat dosing. 
FTC: No in vitro permeability studies have been carried out with FTC, as FTC shows high, dose-
independent bioavailability in vivo in mice and monkeys. Single-dose pharmacokinetics of FTC have 
been studied in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys. FTC was rapidly and well absorbed with oral 
bioavailability ranging from 58% to 97% over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg/kg.  
The multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for FTC were derived as part of the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in mice (80 to 3000 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TOX109; IUW00701; TOX599; TOX628), in rats 
(60 to 3000 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TOX108; TOX097), and monkeys (40 to 2000 mg/kg/day; Study 
Nos. TOX600; TOX627; TOX032) dosed for periods of 3 days to 104 weeks. There were no significant 
differences in pharmacokinetics following single and multiple dosing. Exposure to FTC (Cmax and AUC) 
increased approximately proportionally with dose and was similar between males and females. 
TAF: Permeability of TAF was examined using Caco-2 cells (Study No. AD-120-2037). TAF was applied 
to monolayers of these cells at 10, 100, and 1000 μM, and TAF showed a dose dependent increase in 
forward permeability and a decrease in efflux ratio indicating saturable efflux transport. Addition of the 
efflux transport inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA) diminished the efflux ratio and increased the 
permeability.  
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018

In rats, no consistent differences in plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were found between male and 
female rats. Mean tenofovir Cmax and AUC values increased dose proportionally over the dose range 
of 5 to 100 mg/kg/day. Mean TFV AUC obtained on Day 1 was slightly lower than that measured 
during Weeks 13 and 26, which suggested that there was a slight accumulation of tenofovir with 
repeat dosing. In dogs, there was some accumulation of tenofovir following repeat dosing (~3-fold). 
Distribution  
BIC was highly protein bound in plasma from all species tested (> 98% bound) and was 99.75% 
bound in humans. BIC is widely distributed with a rapid distribution but a very slow elimination 
(radioactivity was not eliminated from most tissues by 168h). BIC poorly crosses the blood:brain, 
blood:eye and blood:testis barriers and there is no preferential association with melanin. Pups were 
exposed to BIC according prenatal and postnatal development study in rats. 
FTC: The protein binding of FTC was very low (< 5%) in mouse, rabbit, monkey, and human plasma 
(Study No. TBZZ/93/0025). The tissue distribution of [14C]FTC was characterized in rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys after a single oral dose of 200 mg/kg (Study Nos. TOX092 and TOX063, 
respectively). Distribution was extensive and rapid; levels were detected within 1 h post oral 
administration. There was no sign of FTC accumulation and elimination was rapid, no radioactivity was 
observed after 72 hours post-dose.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters for FTC in pregnant animals appeared to be generally similar to those 
reported for non-pregnant animals. Emtricitabine was readily transferred across the placenta. Excretion 
into milk has not been evaluated for FTC. 
TAF: The protein binding of TFV has been determined in human plasma and serum using centrifugal 
ultrafiltration (Study No. P0504-00039.1). Percent of unbound TFV was 99.3 ± 3.3% in human plasma, 
and 92.8 ± 3.6% in human serum. Tenofovir therefore showed very low protein binding in either 
human plasma or serum. There was rapid distribution to most tissues, both to mice, pigmented and 
non-pigmented rats. The tissues showing the highest maximum concentrations of radioactivity included 
kidney cortex, kidney(s), kidney medulla, and liver in mice and rats. In animal studies it has been 
shown that tenofovir was transferred across the placenta and was excreted in milk. 
Metabolism 
Unchanged BIC was the principal radiolabel component in all species (≥ 67 % in plasma). Bictegravir is 
metabolized by CYP3A oxidation and UGT conjugation and, hence, BIC plasma exposure may be 
altered by inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. Despite the fact that the sulfate conjugate of 
hydroxylated BIC (M20) was present at higher concentrations in human than other species (20.1% in 
human versus 11.3% in rat and 0.77% in monkey), exposure of M20 in rats is estimated to be 
approximately 9-fold higher than observed human exposure at the clinical dose of 50 mg, and 
therefore further nonclinical characterization according to ICH M3 (R2) is not warranted. 
There are no metabolism data in rabbit and therefore it cannot be concluded if findings in the EFD 
study in rabbit are caused by rabbit specific metabolites. However, rabbit have been exposed to BIC 
and rats have been well exposed to the major human metabolite M20. 
FTC: FTC is not subject to significant metabolism by CYP enzymes. Generation of a minor (~1%) 
sulfoxide metabolite (M1 and/or M2) was catalysed by CYP3A4, and inhibitor studies suggested that at 
least one other enzyme, possibly flavin-containing monooxygenase, may play a role (Study No. 15396 
v1). A minor direct glucuronide metabolite, M3, was also detected.  
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
Page 30/104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FTC was not extensively metabolised and is eliminated primarily as unchanged drug by renal excretion 
in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. Over 90% of the radioactivity in mouse and rat urine and 
64% of the radioactivity in monkey urine was unchanged drug. Only trace levels of metabolites were 
found in faeces (Study Nos. TEIN/93/0015, TEIN/93/0016, TOX063). In all 3 species, metabolism 
accounted for only a minor percentage of FTC elimination. FTC is subject to Phase I metabolism 
(oxidation to a diastereomeric sulfoxide) and to some direct conjugation (glucuronidation of 
hydroxymethyl group) as minor metabolic routes. 
TAF: Tenofovir alafenamide is subject to intracellular metabolism to TFV, which is further 
phosphorylated to the anabolites, TFV-MP and TFV-DP with TFV-DP being the pharmacologically active 
form.  
The Applicant has proposed a possible metabolism pathway based upon the findings from mice, rats, 
dogs and humans. TAF is also subject to intracellular metabolism to TFV, which is further 
phosphorylated to the anabolites, tenofovir-monophosphate and TFV-DP with TFV-DP being the 
pharmacologically active form. 
Excretion 
BIC was mainly eliminated through metabolism by the liver (34-40%) followed by excretion into feces 
(20-40%) and urine (7-15%).  
FTC: The primary route of elimination of [3H]FTC and [14C]FTC was via renal excretion of parent drug 
after oral and IV administration in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. The majority of the FTC 
recovered in the faeces after oral administration most likely represents unabsorbed drug, rather than 
biliary excretion. Although FTC is metabolized to only a minor extent, its metabolites are also excreted 
via the kidneys. Excretion into milk has not been evaluated for FTC. 
TAF: Recovery of radioactivity was 41.3 and 27.7% in faeces and urine, respectively, by 168 hours 
post-dose in mice. [14C]TAF was rapidly excreted within 24 hours after oral dosing in bile duct-intact 
and BDC male SD rats. The mean values of 71.9 and 22.2% of the administered radioactivity were 
excreted in faeces and urine, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose. In dogs the excretion of [14C]TAF 
was determined after administration of a single 15-mg/kg oral dose of 14C-TAF to bile duct-intact and 
BDC male dogs. [14C]TAF was readily excreted mostly within 48 hours after oral dosing. The mean 
values of 37.4% and 35.9% of the administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, 
respectively, by 168 hours post-dose. Mean values of 2.11% and 14.0% of the administered 
radioactivity were excreted in bile in rat and dog, respectively, through 168 hours post-dose. 
Excretion to milk: The extent of TFV excretion in lactating monkeys was evaluated. Milk was obtained 
from 2 lactating adult female rhesus monkeys following a single 30 mg/kg subcutaneous dose of TFV 
(Study No. P2000116). TFV was detected in the milk, the AUC in milk was between 18.6-21.5% of that 
seen in plasma. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profiles of BIC, FTC and TAF have been evaluated in a comprehensive set of non-
clinical studies where the compounds have been evaluated separately. The performed studies include 
repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6 months in rodents and 9 months in a non-rodent species, in vitro 
and in vivo genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, male and female fertility and early embryonic development in 
rodent, embryo-foetal development toxicity, peri- and post-natal development studies in rodents, 
phototoxicity studies. 
Assessment report

Single dose toxicity 
No new single dose toxicity studies have been conducted, namely, no studies using bictegravir or the 
bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide combination. Studies conducted with emtricitabine, 
tenofovir disoproxil and tenofovir alafenamide, administered separately, revealed no risks of acute 
toxicity. The lack of dedicated single dose toxicity studies with bictegravir was considered acceptable. 
Other toxicological studies using this active substance indicate no risk of acute toxicity. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Bictegravir 
The oral toxicity of BIC has been studied in rats, and monkeys for treatment periods up to 39 weeks. 
Preliminary carcinogenicity study in transgenic mouse was also conducted for up to 4 weeks.  
In rats, no major effect have been observed at up to 300 mg/kg/d for 26-weeks (20 fold the exposure 
following clinical administration of the B/F/TAF FDC).  
However, BIC induced a high liver toxicity (bile duct hyperplasia, hepatocyte hypertrophy, regenerative 
hyperplasia,  neutrophil  infiltrate)  with  increased  ALT  activities  in  monkeys  that  persisted  through  the 
recovery phase at high dose of 1000 mg/kg/day (16 fold the exposure following clinical administration 
of  the  B/F/TAF  FDC)  in  a  39-week  toxicology  study  at  the  exception  of  increased  ALT  activities.  The 
Applicant’s  conclusion  on  that  the  hepatobiliary  effects  observed  in  monkeys  are  not  of  relevance  for 
humans is essentially solely based on the results of 4 Phase 3 clinical studies. It is not to be excluded 
the  possibility  that,  depending  on  systemic  exposure  levels,  the  hepatobiliary  effects  observed  in 
monkeys may represent a potential risk to humans, for which there is not a high safety margin.  This 
information is considered of potential relevance to the prescriber and is included in section 5.3 of the 
SmPC. 
FTC 
Non-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard  for humans based  on conventional studies 
repeated dose toxicity. Treatment-related effects were confined to high-dose groups only and included 
changes in red blood cell (RBC) parameters, interpreted as a mild, reversible anaemia (mice 1 month, 
6  months;  rat  3  months;  monkey  1  year);  changes  in  various  organ  weights  without  any  associated 
adverse histopathological effects in rodents (mouse 1 month, 6 months; rat 3 months), increased urine 
output  (mice  6  months),  and  soft  faeces  (monkeys  1  month,  3  months).  No  observed  effect  levels 
(NOELs)  could  be  established  for  all  treatment-related  effects,  and  in  several  cases  the  minor  effects 
observed were reversible after a recovery period. 
TAF 
Non-clinical studies of tenofovir alafenamide in rats and dogs revealed bone and kidney as the primary 
target  organs  of  toxicity.  Bone  toxicity  was  observed  as  reduced  BMD  in  rats  and  dogs  at  tenofovir 
exposures at least four times greater than those expected after administration of Descovy. A minimal 
infiltration  of  histiocytes  was  present  in  the  eye  in  dogs  at  tenofovir  alafenamide  and  tenofovir 
exposures  of  approximately  4  and  17  times  greater,  respectively,  than  those  expected  after 
administration of Descovy.

Bictegravir/FTC/TAF 
No  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  conducted  with  the  bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
alafenamide triple combination. This is accepted, taking into account the lack of overlapping toxicities 
and  the  already  available  clinical  experience  with  the  combination.  The  Applicant  considers  that  the 
increased  phosphorous  levels  observed  in  rat  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  with  bictegravir  is  not 
biologically significant and not relevant for consideration of the safety profile of the combination. This 
is  based  mostly  on  the  lack  of  bone  or  renal  microscopic  findings  in  the  rat  26  week  repeated  dose 
toxicity and carcinogenicity studies conducted with bictegravir and on an, as claimed, acceptable renal 
and bone clinical safety data for B/F/TAF. 
Genotoxicity 
Bictegravir 
Despite precipitate and toxicity, no increase in the numbers of revertant colonies was observed in 
Ames test. In chromosome aberration test, an increase in the number of polyploid cells has been 
observed and the reason of this event is not fully understood. However, no increase in the number of 
cells with chromosomal aberrations or endoreduplication. No effect have been observed in vivo in 
micronucleus assessment at doses up to 29 fold the exposure following clinical administration of the 
B/F/TAF FDC, and therefore could be considered as non-genotoxic. 
FTC / TAF 
FTC and tenofovir alafenamide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays. 
Carcinogenicity 
Bictegravir 
The transgenic Tg-rasH2 model is acceptable for regulatory authorities as an alternative to the 
standard mouse long-term study (CHMP SWP Conclusions and recommendations on the use of 
genetically modified animal models for carcinogenicity assessment, CPMP/SWP/2592/02 Rev, June 
2004). BIC did not induce a significant carcinogenic response in this animal model at exposures 15-fold 
above clinical exposure levels. It could be noted that disturbing data have been observed in the rat 
carcinogenicity study (tumours with statistically significant increase in treated rats) in addition to 
carcinoma observed in the 26-weeks study in rats, hyperplasia not reversed in the 39-weeks in 
monkeys, the lack of the major human metabolite M20 in TG mice in carcinogenicity study and the 
increase of combined spleen/urinary bladder/uterus/vagina b-hemangioma/m-hemangiosarcoma 
tumors at the mid-dose in the TG mice carcinoma study. However tumours observed in the rat 
carcinogenicity study were comparable to historical control data.

Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Bictegravir 
In rats, BIC did not affect fertility or early embryonal development in rats at exposure margins of up to 
22 times the 50 mg human clinical exposure based on AUC. 
Concerning embryo-foetal development in rats, BIC did not affect implantations, percent 
preimplantation loss, litter sizes, live foetuses, early resorptions or percent post-implantation loss.  
BIC was shown to be devoid of embryo-foetotoxic or teratogenic potential in rabbits at exposure 
margins at the NOAEL of 0.59 times the 50 mg human clinical exposure based on AUC. The high dose 
level induced some maternal toxicity, as shown notably by significant decreases in body weight with 
abortion in 2 does.  
Concerning prenatal and postnatal development study in rats, the Applicant states that no test article-
related effects were noted at any dosage level during the study and the NOEL for F0 maternal systemic 
toxicity, and F1 neonatal/developmental toxicity, parental systemic toxicity, and reproductive toxicity, 
and F2 neonatal/early postnatal toxicity was 300 mg/kg/day.  
FTC / TAF 
No special hazard for humans was revealed in conventional studies of toxicity to reproduction and 
development with FTC. 
Because there is a lower tenofovir exposure in rats and mice after the administration of tenofovir 
alafenamide compared to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a rat peripostnatal study was conducted only 
with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. No special hazard for humans was revealed in conventional studies 
of toxicity to reproduction and development. Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed 
no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or foetal parameters. However, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a peri-postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic 
doses. 
Juvenile toxicity 
Bictegravir / FTC / TAF 
No juvenile toxicity studies have been conducted with BIC, F or TAF. This is acceptable, since the 
presently sought indication of BIC/F/TAF is confined to the adult population. 
Local Tolerance  
Bictegravir 
BIC could be considered to be non-corrosive, non-irritant in the in vitro skin model EpiDerm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
Page 34/104 
 
 
 
 
 
FTC / TAF 
No specific local tolerance studies have been conducted with FTC and no particular alert in repeat dose 
toxicity studies has been observed. 
In a bovine corneal opacity and permeability assay (BCOP) TAF elicited an in vitro irritancy score of 
21.0 ± 8.7 with a 4-hour incubation and was predicted to be a noncorrosive/non-severe eye irritant.  
In a dermal irritation study in rabbits animals were given a single 4 hour, semi-occlusive, dermal 
administration of approximately 0.5 g of TAF and were observed for 4 days (Study number: TX-120-
2011). No local dermal reaction was observed in any animal throughout the duration of the study. The 
Primary Irritation Index was calculated to be 0.0; TAF was classified as a ‘non-irritant’.  
The potential for additive effects among the three agents in the B/F/TAF FDC is minimal. 
Immunotoxicity 
Bictegravir / FTC / TAF  
No specific immunotoxicity studies have been conducted with BIC and TAF and no particular alert in 
repeat dose toxicity studies has been observed. 
An immunotoxicity study was conducted with FTC and there was no effect on the immune system as 
evaluated by IgM antibody response in the rat to sheep red blood cells with doses up to 1000 
mg/kg/day. 
Antigenicity 
Bictegravir 
BIC is not a potential skin sensitizer. 
FTC / TAF 
No specific antigenicity studies have been conducted with FTC and no particular alert in repeat dose 
toxicity studies has been observed. 
Female mice were given TAF (GS-7340-03) at of 10, 25 or 50% w/v. The animals were administered 
TAF by daily application of 25 μL of the appropriate concentration or control (vehicle or positive), to 
the dorsal surface of both ears for 3 consecutive days. The proliferative response of the lymph node 
cells (LNCs) from the draining auricular lymph nodes was assessed 5 days following the initial 
application, by measurement of the incorporation of 3H-methyl thymidine (3HTdR) by β-scintillation 
counting of LNC suspensions.  
The response was expressed as radioactive disintegrations per minute per lymph node (dpm/node) and 
as the ratio of 3HTdR incorporation into LNC of test nodes relative to that recorded for control nodes 
(test/control ratio), termed as SI. The test substance is regarded as a sensitizer if at least one 
concentration of the chemical has a SI of 3 or more. The SI obtained for 10%, 25%, and 50% w/v 
were 0.9, 1.0, and 1.0, respectively, which indicates that TAF did not show the potential to induce skin 
sensitisation. The EC3 value (the “estimated concentration of 3” is the concentration of test substance 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
Page 35/104 
 
 
 
 
 
which would result in a SI of 3 in the LLNA) was determined to be higher than 50% w/v. The SI for the 
positive control substance hexyl cinnamic aldehyde was 6.3, which demonstrates the validity of this 
study. 
Impurities 
Bictegravir / FTC / TAF 
The impurities and degradation products in the BIC, FTC or TAF drug substance have been identified 
and qualified in toxicology studies. 
Phototoxicity 
Bictegravir  
The irradiation sources used in the positive in vitro study and negative in vivo study differ. The 
emission spectra of the light source used for the in vitro study starts at 300-310 nm while the spectra 
of the light source used for the in vivo study starts at 310-320 nM. It remains that the absorbance of 
BIC is substantially equivalent between 290 and 320 nm, and the animals have been well exposed to 
BIC in the in vivo study. 
FTC / TAF 
FTC and TAF fumarate does not absorb light within the range of natural sunlight; therefore no 
phototoxicity studies are not considered necessary for FTC or TAF. 
Other toxicity studies 
. 
TAF - Bone metabolism  
Three relevant non-GLP rat studies and one GLP dog study were conducted to evaluate the potential 
for TAF to alter bone metabolism. 
Male rats were given 400 mg/kg TAF by oral gavage daily for 6 days. One animal was due to non-drug 
related injury (study number: R990177). The results of this study demonstrated that TAF had effects 
on selected urinary and serum parameters. The Applicant states that due to the lack of strong 
statistical comparison to controls and lack of correlation between data, interpretation on overall toxicity 
was not possible. 
In the second study, an additional dose was evaluated. This study examined changes in markers of 
calcium homeostasis in male Sprague-Dawley rats after once daily oral administration of TAF. Animals 
were given 100 or 400 mg/kg TAF by oral gavage on Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The results indicated 
that daily administration of TAF to rats for 6 days altered plasma vitamin D, calcium and phosphate 
levels as well as urinary excretion of calcium. It is stated that the mechanistic basis of these changes 
and their biological relationships in terms of cause and effect are unknown. 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
Page 36/104 
 
 
 
 
 
Dogs were given oral doses of 37.5 or 75 mg/kg/day of TAF for 5 days (1/dose). The Applicant states 
that there were no biologically important changes observed in mean values for ionized calcium or N 
telopeptide. The Applicant states that the lack of the expected age-related reduction in mean serum 
bone ALP (B-ALP) suggested increased bone remodelling. The mean serum calcitriol (1, 25 
dihydroxycholecalciferol) concentration was reduced by approximate 68% at both doses. The mean 
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 hydroxycholecalciferol) concentration was reduced approximately 35% 
and 33% at 37.5 and 75 mg/kg/day. Gastrointestinal lesions characterised by epithelial cell necrosis, 
regenerative hyperplasia, and cyst formation were most prevalent in animals at 75 mg/kg/day. 
Lymphoid cell depletion was noted in the lymph nodes, thymus and tonsil at 75 mg/kg/day animals. 
Bile duct hyperplasia and peri-portal inflammation was observed at both doses. 
TAF - Renal Function  
An investigative study was conducted in SD rats to evaluate renal parameters. Animals were given a 
single oral dose of 100 or 1000 mg/kg/day TAF. Urinary output of calcium was increased at 1000 
mg/kg/day which correlated with an increase in serum calcium concentration and indicated that the 
kidneys were functioning in order to reduce the serum calcium load. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Bictegravir 
This environmental risk assessment is in accordance with guidelines, and based on the data generated 
for  the  Phase  II  A  assessment,  the  proposed  use  of  BIC  poses  no  unacceptable  risk  to  the 
environment. The Phase II B assessment is ongoing and the final results from the required studies are 
pending.  The  Applicant  committed  to  submit  the  completed  study  reports  post-authorisation 
(December  2018)  along  with  an  updated  risk  assessment.  The  results  of  the  environment  risk 
assessment of BIC are summarised below.

The environmental risk assessment of Descovy has shown that FTC does not bioaccumulate and is of 
low risk to the aquatic or terrestrial environments. TAF is a next generation pro-drug of tenofovir (TFV) 
and TFV has been identified as persistent in the environment, but it is considered to be of low risk to 
aquatic organisms, it is not bioaccumulative and does not pose significant risk to the environment.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
No novel non-clinical pharmacology studies with F and TAF have been submitted with this application. 
The studies supporting the use of these substances are well known.  There are no findings in the 
secondary pharmacology or safety pharmacology studies with BIC to be considered in the safety 
evaluation, and therefore no findings in studies on secondary pharmacology or safety pharmacology to 
be considered specifically in the safety evaluation of the triple combination. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The single dose PK of BIC has been determined in rats, dogs and monkeys. In rats, females had higher 
BIC Cmax and AUC0-24 values than males, with gender-based differences of 2-to 3-fold on study days 
90 and 181 for animals administered the high dose (300 mg/kg/day). In female rats administered the 
low dose (5 mg/kg/day), an accumulation (~ 3-fold) was observed.  
Bictegravir  was  absorbed  quickly  following  oral  solution  administration,  reaching  maximal  plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) within 4 hours post-dose, and is widely distributed with a rapid distribution but a 
very slow elimination. The oral bioavailability of BIC solution formulation was moderate to high (42% 
to 74%). Despite the fact that the sulfate conjugate of hydroxylated BIC (M20) was present at higher 
concentrations  in  human  than  other  species  (20.1%  in  human  versus  11.3%  in  rat  and  0.77%  in 
monkey), exposure of M20 in rats is estimated to be approximately 9-fold higher than observed human 
exposure at the clinical dose of 50 mg, and therefore further nonclinical characterization according to 
ICH M3 (R2) is not warranted. There are no metabolism data in rabbit.  
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
Page 40/104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No  novel  nonclinical  pharmacokinetics  studies  with  FTC  or  TAF  have  been  submitted  with  this 
application. There were no findings in these studies on pharmacokinetics to be considered specifically 
in the safety evaluation of the triple combination. 
Toxicology 
The oral toxicity of BIC  has been studied in rats and monkeys for treatment periods up to 39 weeks. 
Preliminary carcinogenicity study in transgenic mouse was also conducted for up to 4 weeks.  
In  rats,  no  major  effect  has  been  observed  at  up  to  300  mg/kg/d  for  26-weeks.  BIC  induced  a  high 
liver  toxicity  (bile  duct  hyperplasia,  hepatocyte  hypertrophy,  regenerative  hyperplasia,  neutrophil 
infiltrate)  with  increased  ALT  activities in  monkeys  that  persisted  through  the recovery  phase  at  high 
dose of 1000 mg/kg/day. The Applicant considered that there is no evidence for that the hepatobiliary 
effects observed in the chronic toxicity study with administration of bictegravir to cynomolgus monkeys 
is significant or relevant for humans. Information on the hepatobiliary effects is included in section 5.3 
of the SmPC.   
Non-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard  for humans based  on conventional studies 
repeated dose toxicity. Treatment-related effects were confined to high-dose groups only and included 
changes  in  red  blood  cell  (RBC)  parameters.  Non-clinical  studies  of  tenofovir  alafenamide  in  rats  and 
dogs revealed bone and kidney as the primary target organs of toxicity. 
BIC,  FTC  and  tenofovir  alafenamide  was  not  mutagenic  or  clastogenic  in  conventional  genotoxicity 
assays. No special hazard for humans was revealed in conventional studies of carcinogenic potential for 
F or TDF. BIC did not induce a significant carcinogenic response in this transgenic mouse or in rats at 
exposures 15-fold and 21-fold above clinical exposure levels respectively. 
Studies in animals with bictegravir have shown no evidence of teratogenicity or an effect on 
reproductive function.  In offspring from rat and rabbit dams treated with bictegravir during 
pregnancy, there were no toxicologically significant effects on developmental endpoints. 
There were no other findings in all non-clinical studies to be considered specifically in the safety 
evaluation of the triple combination. 
Environmental risk assessment 
Studies for BIC are ongoing and will be submitted post-authorization.  
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to an approval of BIC/F/TAF from a non-clinical point of view.

Bioequivalence 
An FDC formulation containing BIC 75 mg, FTC 200 mg, and TAF 25 mg was initially developed and 
evaluated for relative bioavailability compared with BIC 75 mg + F/TAF (200/25 mg), each 
administered under fasted conditions (Study GS-US-141-1233).  
Study GS-US-141-1233 – Study Title: A Phase 1, Open-label, Two-Cohort, Multiple-Period, Fixed-
Sequence, Crossover Study to Evaluate 1) the Relative Bioavailability of Two GS-
9883/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (75/200/25 mg and 50/200/25 mg) Fixed-Dose 
Combination Tablets Versus a GS-9883 (75 mg) Tablet and a Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide 
(200/25 mg) Fixed-Dose Combination Tablet Administered Simultaneously and 2) the Effect of Food on 
the Pharmacokinetics of GS-9883, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Alafenamide When Administered as GS-
9883/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (75/200/25 mg and 50/200/25 mg) Fixed-Dose 
Combination Tablets 
Bictegravir AUCinf and Cmax for single-dose administration of the B/F/TAF (75/200/25 mg) FDC were 
approximately 27% and 31% higher, respectively, relative to BIC 75 mg + F/TAF (200/25 mg). 
Therefore, another FDC formulation was developed that contained BIC 50 mg, FTC 200 mg, and TAF 
25 mg. Upon single-dose administration of the B/F/TAF (50/200/25 mg) FDC or BIC 75 mg + F/TAF 
(200/25 mg) under fasted conditions (also in Study GS-US-141-1233), the geometric least-squares 
mean ratios and their 90% CIs for the BIC primary PK parameters of AUClast, AUCinf, and Cmax were 
78.46% (73.38, 83.89), 78.56% (73.44, 84.04), and 78.07% (73.41, 83.01), respectively, and were 
considered by the Applicant as within the protocol-defined boundary of PK equivalence (70% to 
143%). Based on these data, the B/F/TAF 50/200/25 mg FDC was chosen for further evaluation in 
Phase 3 studies.

Food effect 
GS-US-141-1233 showed that after a high-fat meal, BIC AUC and Cmax were increased by 1.24 and 
1.13 fold, and after a moderate-fat meal, BIC AUC and Cmax were increased by 1.24 and 1.20 fold. This 
food effect was larger with the 75 mg FDC (1.45 fold increase in AUC and 1.27 fold increase in Cmax).

Distribution 
Vz/F was observed between 9.919 and 34.770 L (CV 10.7% to 58.85%). Population PK modelling: 
12,500 mL (11.1% variability), with extreme weights (5th and 95th percentiles) ranged from 9,800 to 
16,200 mL. 
Bictegravir is > 99% bound to human plasma proteins.  
In subjects with severe renal impairment, the percent bound remained > 99%, but the percent 
unbound was higher (0.75%) compared with healthy matched control subjects (0.49%) (Study GS-US-
141-1479). Similarly, percent unbound was also higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment 
(0.81%) compared with healthy matched control subjects (0.61%) (Study GS-US-141-1478). 
Following a single oral dose of [14C]BIC in healthy subjects, the blood-to-plasma ratio of [14C]-
radioactivity ranged between 0.50 and 0.55 through 120 hours post-dose, indicating that BIC was 
Assessment report

predominantly distributed to plasma rather than the cellular components of blood (Study GS-US-141-
1481). 
Elimination and metabolism 
Average T1/2 in studies was observed between 15.6 h and 20.88 h (ranging between 12.14 h and 
14.47h in first and 4th quartiles). In population PK modelling, terminal half-life was estimated at 
17.2hr. 
Average CL/F in studies was observed between 349.4 and 900 mL/h (CV between 15.3% and 74.2%). 
In population PK modelling, CL/F was estimated at 504 mL/h, with variability 27.4%, and at extreme 
weights (5th and 95th percentiles) it ranged from 428 to 601 ml/h. 
Bictegravir is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A and uridine glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT)1A1 with each enzyme playing an approximately equal role in the clearance of BIC. 
Following a single oral dose of 100-mg [14C]BIC in healthy male subjects, 95.3% of the [14C]BIC dose 
was recovered with 60.3% of the dose from faeces and 35.0% of the dose from urine (Study GS-US-
141-1481). M20 (hydroxy-BIC-sulphate, 20.1%) and M15 (BIC-glucuronide, 8.6%) were the major 
metabolites identified in plasma.  
Unchanged drug accounted for 31% to 34% of the radioactive dose in the faeces that likely represents 
a combination of both unabsorbed drug and deconjugated BIC glucuronide. Desfluoro-hydroxy- BIC-
cysteine-conjugate (10%−13% of dose) and other minor oxidative metabolites were identified in 
faeces. Radioactivity in urine consisted primarily of M15/M58 (BIC-glucuronide; 21% of dose) and 
other minor oxidative metabolites and their conjugates. Renal clearance of the unchanged parent was 
minimal (1.3% of dose).

Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Dose  proportionality  is  mainly  explored  in  study  GS-US-141-1218.  Bictegravir  exposure  is  dose-
proportional  over  the  dose  range  of  25  to  100  mg;  Less  than  dose-proportional  increases  in  BIC 
exposure were observed at doses greater than 100 mg, presumably limited by solubility. In study GS-
US-141-1219,  mean  BIC  AUC0-24  and  Cmax  were  approximately  dose  proportional  following  single-
dose administration of 5 to 50 mg dose administration, with decreasing dose proportionality at the 100

mg  dose.  Following  multiple-dose  administration,  dose  proportionality  was  observed  in  AUCtau,  Cmax, 
and Ctau over the dose range of 5 to 100 mg using the 50-mg dose as a reference. 
Steady state levels of BIC were achieved between Study Days 4 to 6 of dosing and maintained through 
Day 14. Accumulation rate was around 1.6 fold. 
Inter and intra-individual variability 
Interindividual  variability  in  the  population  study  was  27.4  for  CL/F  and  1.1  for  Vc/F.  Intra  individual 
variability may be estimated by the remaining residual variability (as CV) at 29.2% 
PK in target populations 
In  the  population  PK  analysis,  healthy  subjects  exhibited  7.3%  lower  Vc/F  compared  to  HIV-infected 
subjects. This seemed to be the only variation, and is not considered clinically relevant.

0.8% instead of 0.6%.

No clinically relevant PK differences due to gender and race were identified.  
Weight  was  a  significant  factor  in  the  population  PK  study,  impacting  CL/F  and  Vd/F.  Subjects 
corresponding  to  the  5th  and  95th  percentile  of  body  weight  (58  kg  and  113  kg,  respectively) 
demonstrated  a  -15.1  %  and  19.2  %  difference  in  CL/F,  respectively,  and  a  -  21.5  %  and  29.7  % 
difference in Vc/F, respectively, as compared to the typical 80 kg subject. This was considered clinically 
not significant. 
Age was tested as a potential covariate in both the BIC and TAF population PK analyses  for B/F/TAF, 
but  was  determined  to  be  not  significant  for  both  analytes.  As  such,  age  is  not  expected  to 
substantially affect exposure of BIC or TAF. 
No data are available in children. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
BIC is a substrate of UGT1A1 and CYP3A4. Clinically relevant interaction with inhibitors and inducers of 
these  enzymes  has  been  carried  out  with  darunavir/cobicistat  (DRV/RTV)  or  with  atazanavir/ritonavir 
(ATV/RTV) for CYP and UGT inhibition, and with rifampicin (RIF) for induction. 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BIC is not a direct or TDI of all tested CYPs up to 100µM. However, even though with CYP3A4, TDI by 
bictegravir  is  observed  but  with  a  KI>100  µM,  the  Applicant  performed  a  DDI  study  with  midazolam 
that allow to consider BIC as a weak CYP3A inhibitor. 
BIC inducing effect has been demonstrated in vitro on CYP3A4, 2B6, P-gp and UGT1A1 but no clinical 
consequences are expected. 
With  an  IC50=176  µM,  BIC  is  not  expected  to  affect  exposure  of  drugs  the  metabolism  of  which  is 
UGT1A1-dependant. 
BIC is both a P-gp and BCRP substrate. Bictegravir (1 μM) is not a substrate of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 
Up to 100µM, BIC does not exhibit in vitro inhibition of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, OATP1B1, 1B3, OCT1, OAT1. 
Therefore,  clinically  relevant  interactions  related  to this  transporter  inhibition  are  not expected  at  the 
expected systemic and intestinal concentrations. 
With OAT3, BIC IC50=55 µM that is higher the worst concentration expected at the systemic level (5 
µM), then, clinically relevant interaction related to the inhibition of this transporter can be ruled out. 
With  OCT2  and  MATE1  IC50=0.42  µM  and  8  µM  respectively.  Risk  of  DDI  is,  then,  not  excluded  with 
OCT2 and borderline with MATE1. 
FTC and TAF 
FTC  is  predominantly  eliminated  by  the  kidney.  TAF  is  primarily  hydrolyzed  by  carboxylesterase  1 
(CES) and Cat A (cathepsin A) and not recommended in combination with inhibitor of this enzyme such 
as boceprevir. Tenofovir alafenamide was slowly metabolized by CYP3A4. 
Clinically  relevant  interactions  related  to  any  inhibition  or  induction  of  CYPs  by  emtricitabine  are  not 
expected.  Likewise,  in  vitro,  TAF  did  not  show  any  inducing  or  inhibition  potential  towards  main 
CYP450  enzymes,  excepted  with  CYP3A4.  Nonetheless,  a  DDI  study  with  midazolam  (study  GS-US-
1538)  and  rilpivirine  (GS-US-120-0117),  both  CYP3A4  substrates,  discard  any  significant  induction  or 
inhibition of CYP3A4 by TAF in vivo. 
No UGT1A1 inhibition is expected by FTC and TAF. Likewise, no induction of UGTs is expected by FTC 
or TAF. 
FTC  is  not  expected to be  a  substrate  and inhibitor of  uptake  and  efflux  transporters  according  to  its 
extensive and high absorption. 
TAF  is  a  substrate  of  the  efflux  transporters  P-gp  and  BCRP  and,  also,  of  the  uptake  transporters 
OATP1B1 and 1B3. Therefore, inhibition of these transporters may alter TAF exposure and then of TFV. 
TAF is neither a substrate of the hepatic uptake transporter OCT1 nor of the renal uptake transporters 
OAT1 and OAT3.  
As regards inhibition of P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BSEP, OCT1, and MATE1 
by TAF, IC50 values are > 100 µM far higher the estimated cut-off values at the intestinal, hepatocyte 
and systemic level (21 µM, 18.5 µM and 4.5 µM respectively). Therefore, clinically relevant interactions 
related to any inhibition of these transporters by TAF are unlikely.

In vivo 
B/F/TAF 
Interactions  between  the  components  BIC  and  FTC/TAF  was  explored  in  study  GS-US-141-1218.  TAF 
and FTC do not alter BIC absorption. BIC does not alter FTC absorption. Only TAF exposure is changed 
by coadministration of BIC and F/TAF, but TFV is by far more relevant and shows no DDI impact. 
FTC = emtricitabine; F/TAF = emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (coformulated); GLSM = geometric least-squares mean; TFV = tenofovir 
Studies GS-US-380-1761 and GS-US-380-1999 with the FDC ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) and 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir  (SOF/VEL/VOX)  did  not  highlight  significant  PK  interaction 
between studied drugs.  
In study GS-US-380-3908, B/F/TAF significantly increases metformin AUCτ about 39% with an 90%CI 
[131%-148].  However,  the  lack  of  significant  changes  on  PD  parameters  (plasma  glucose,  active 
glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and lactate levels) brings a reassuring information and could allow to 
conclude that no dose adjustment of metformin is needed when it is combined with B/F/TAF. 
Interaction between B/F/TAF and antacids, calcium carbonate and ferrous fumarate was explored 
in study GS-US-380-3909:

With antacids containing magnesium or aluminium, under fasted conditions, and given simultaneously, 
BIC  AUC  and  C24h  substantially  decrease,  more  than  with  RIF,  about  79%.  This  interaction  can  be 
compensated  by  staggered  the  administration  of  BIC  2  hours  before  antacids  (based  on  results  from 
cohort  2)  or  alternatively,  B/F/TAF  can  be  taken  with  food  2  hours  after  antacids  containing 
magnesium or aluminium.

With  calcium  carbonate  and  ferrous  fumarate,  under  fasted  conditions  and  given  simultaneously,  BIC 
AUC  and  Cmin  decrease  about  33%  and  42%,  respectively,  with  calcium  carbonate,  and  about  63% 
with ferrous fumarate. Even though the effect of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate has not been 
studied  with  staggered  doses  of  the  FDC,  one  can  take  B/F/TAF  at  least  2  hours  before  ferrous 
fumarate and can take B/F/TAF together with calcium-containing supplements without regard to food. 
-  Results  from  study  GS-US-380-4270  show  that  B/F/TAF  significantly,  but  weakly,  increases 
midazolam  exposure  about  15%  with  a  90%CI  [99.7-131].  This  effect  is  likely  driven  by  BIC  the  in 
vitro  data  of  which  demonstrate  the  ability  of  BIC  to  be  a  time-dependant  inhibitor  at  high 
concentrations. The mild increase observed with midazolam is not expected to be clinically meaningful. 
BIC alone 
In  study  GS-US-311-1790,  no  significant  effect  of  BIC  and  FTC/TAF  on  ethinylestradiol, 
norgetromine  and  norgestrel  PK  was  observed.  Therefore  no  dose  adjustment  of  combined  oral 
contraception is needed when co-administered with B/F/TAF.

There  was  a  substantial  increase  of  BIC  exposure,  about  4-fold,  with  ATV/COBI  (cohort  1)  similar  to 
the increase exposure of BIC with ATV alone (cohort 3) and suggesting that this effect is mainly driven 
by  UGT1A1  inhibition  by  ATV.  This  assumption  is  corroborated  by  results  obtained  with  two  strong 
CYP3A4  inhibitors,  VORI  and  DRV/COBI,  with  which  BIC  exposure  increases  about  61%  and  74%, 
respectively.  This  highlights  the  moderate  involvement  of  CYP3A4  in  the  overall  hepatic  clearance  of 
BIC. Rifampicin substantially decreases BIC exposure about 75% whereas with rifabutin AUC decrease 
about 38% and Cmin about 56%.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The INSTI BIC and the N(t)RTIs FTC and TAF are potent and selective inhibitors of HIV-1 and HIV-2. 
Emtricitabine and TAF are also potent and selective inhibitors of HBV. All 3 drugs show potent ARV 
activity against diverse subtypes of HIV-1 in vitro. Emtricitabine and TAF are phosphorylated 
intracellularly through non-overlapping pathways, and in combination show no antagonism for the 
formation of their active metabolites. Bictegravir does not require metabolic modification for activity. 
Two- and 3-drug combinations of BIC, FTC, and TAF consistently show synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity in 
vitro and no evidence of antagonism or cytotoxicity. 
The resistance profiles for the individual agents BIC, FTC, and TAF have been well characterized. There 
is no known cross-resistance between the NRTI and INSTI classes. 
Bictegravir, FTC, and TAF have no pharmacologically significant off-target binding affinity to the 
receptors tested. Bictegravir, FTC, and TAF have low in vitro cytotoxicity in a variety of human cell 
types. Both FTC and TAF have shown a low potential for mitochondrial toxicity in long-term toxicity 
studies and there was no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo. 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
BIC is a novel strand transfer inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase (INSTI) with high potency and selectivity in 
antiviral assays and does not require metabolic modification to exert ARV activity. BIC inhibited the 
strand transfer activity with an IC50 value of 7.5 nM, an activity comparable to those of EVG and DTG. 
Table 15.  Inhibitory Activity in HIV-1 Integrase Strand Transfer and 3’-Processing Assays 
a The data represent the mean ± SD of 3 independent experiments done in triplicates. 
b The data represent the mean ± SD of 5 independent experiments done in triplicates. 
c Maximum inhibition was determined by curve fitting. 
Thus, the integration of HIV in cell was inhibited. This inhibition of HIV-1 DNA integration was 
evaluated by assessing the quantity of aborted circular HIV DNA species containing 1 or 2 long 
terminal repeats (2-LTR circles), as well as the quantity of authentic HIV-1 integration products in 
infected MT-2 cells. BIC enhanced the accumulation of 2-LTR circles, a product of integration failure. 
BIC profoundly decreased integration junctions but did not affect viral DNA synthesis as measured by 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the late reverse transcription products, demonstrating an authentic inhibition of HIV-1 integration. As 
expected, DTG exhibited a similar effect on the integration junctions. 
The dissociation kinetics of 3H-labelled INSTIs BIC, DTG, RAL, and EVG were measured using wild-type 
HIV integrase/DNA complexes and a scintillation proximity assay. By both data analysis methods, BIC 
had a longer dissociation half-life from HIV-1 integrase/DNA complexes compared to DTG, RAL, and 
EVG; the long dissociation half-life has been proposed to contribute to a high barrier to resistance. 
Against HIV 
Using lymphoblastoid T-cell lines and primary human T-lymphocytes in HIV-1 antiviral assays, the 
estimated concentration of drug for half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of BIC ranged from 
1.5 to 2.4 nM and the selectivity indices ranged from 1500 to 8800.  
When tested in primary human PBMCs against clinical isolates of all HIV-1 groups (M, N, O), including 
subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, BIC displayed similar antiviral activity across all clinical isolates with 
mean and median EC50 values of 0.60 and 0.55 nM, respectively, based on a range of EC50 values 
between < 0.05 and 1.71 nM. DTG tested in parallel exhibited a similar potency with mean and median 
EC50 values of 0.61 nM and 0.68 nM, respectively, and a range of EC50 values from 0.09 to 1.13 nM 
against the same tested isolates. HIV-2 was similarly susceptible to both BIC and DTG with EC50 
values of 1.1 nM and 2.1 nM, respectively. 
Against other viruses 
BIC and DTG were tested against hepatitis B and C viruses, influenza A virus, human rhinovirus (HRV), 
and RSV in cell-based assays. For both drugs, no antiviral activity against these viruses was observed.

Effect of serum proteins on BIC 
The antiviral EC50 of BIC was determined in MT-2 cells in the presence of two key human serum 
components, human serum albumin (HSA) and α1-acid glycoprotein (α1-AGP) or in the presence of 
complete human serum. 
The presence of the two serum components reduced the antiviral activity of BIC by 20-fold, compared 
to 11-fold reduction of the potency of DTG. These data indicate that the two tested components of 
human serum are capable of binding BIC as well as DTG. 
In the presence of human serum, the shift in EC50 for both BIC and DTG exhibited similar trends as 
observed with the serum protein components: the BIC EC50 value, extrapolated to 100% human 
serum, shifted 74-fold and was comparable to the 39-fold shift extrapolated for DTG. 
Viral resistance to BIC in clinical studies 
Analyses were performed for HIV-infected subjects with clinical virology data from 4 B/F/TAF Phase 3 
studies (GS-US-380-1489, GS-US-380-1490, GS-US-380-1844, and GS-US-380-1878). An integrated 
virology analysis was performed for HIV-infected subjects with clinical virology data from Studies GS-
US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490. All of the previously identified drug resistance mutations by 
antiretroviral drug class is shown in Table 16.

Secondary pharmacology 
Effect of BIC on cardiac conduction 
Study  GS-US-141-1480  was  a  partially-blinded,  randomized,  placebo-  and  positive-controlled,  4-
period, single-dose, crossover study evaluating the effects of BIC (at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic 
doses)  on  ΔΔQTcF  in  healthy  subjects.  Forty-eight  subjects  completed  4  dosing  periods;  each  period 
consisted of 1 day of dosing with 75 mg BIC, 300 mg BIC, placebo-to-match BIC, or moxifloxacin (400 
mg) according to randomized sequence. Dosing in the first 3 periods was followed by a washout period 
of 7 days. Moxifloxacin was administered open label. 
BIC  was  concluded  to  have  no  QTcF  prolongation  effect  as  the  upper  bounds of  the  2-sided 90%  CIs 
for  the  mean  difference  between  therapeutic  or  supra-therapeutic  doses  of  BIC  and  placebo  were 
below  10  msec  at  all  time  points  after  dosing.  No  subject  had  a  QTcF  interval  change  from  predose 
baseline > 30 or > 60 msec at any time point during any treatment (BIC 75 and 300 mg, placebo, and

moxifloxacin).  Treatment-emergent  absolute  QTcF  intervals  >  450,  >  480,  or  >  500  msec  were  not 
observed  for  any  subject  following  BIC  75  and  300  mg,  or  moxifloxacin.  One  subject  had  treatment-
emergent absolute QTcF interval > 450 msec following placebo administration. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK/PD properties of FTC and TAF have been evaluated throughout their respective development 
programs. Therefore, we will focus on discussing the BIC PK/PD properties as part of the B/F/TAF 
application. 
Analytical methods: 
Analytical methods are well described and acceptable. In particular, analytical method validation for 
BIC in plasma for the main studies was provided. PK parameters calculation was classical and well 
explained. 
Bioavailability: 
The absorption of BIC in humans is expected to be > 61% based on the results of the human ADME 
study in healthy subjects. This is not enough to classify BCS as a molecule with sufficient permeability 
(>85% of absorption), therefore we disagree with the Applicant’s suggestion that BIC be a BCS Class 
II compound, and we consider a BCS Class IV classification. 
Bioequivalence and food effect: 
Relative bioavailability study GS-US-141-1233 showed higher than expected BIC exposures when BIC 
was administered as the B/F/TAF 75/200/25 mg FDC (BIC AUC and Cmax increased by 1.27 and 1.31 
fold, out of the 80-125 acceptance range for the confidence interval). The dose of BIC was therefore 
reduced from 75 mg to 50 mg and a new B/F/TAF 50/200/25 mg FDC tablet was developed, showing 
lower BIC exposures (BIC AUC and Cmax decreased by 0.78 fold as compared to the 75 mg BIC + 
FTC/TAF) but within the confidence interval that was enlarged (70-143%) to take into account the 
different BIC doses. An enlarged CI could be accepted given the lack of lower boundary of BIC 
therapeutic window and the clinical efficacy results. 
GS-US-141-1233 showed that after a high-fat meal, BIC AUC and Cmax were increased by 1.24 and 
1.13 fold, and after a moderate-fat meal, BIC AUC and Cmax were increased by 1.24 and 1.20 fold. 
This food effect was larger with the 75 mg FDC (1.45 fold increase in AUC and 1.27 fold increase in 
Cmax). GS-US-141-1218 also provided results on food effect of BIC alone, with the largest food effect: 
Cmax increased 2 fold and AUCs 1.8 fold after a high-fat meal. However, given the efficacy and PK 
values (and notably IQ values) of B/F/TAF administered with or without food in the Phase 3 studies, 
there is no evidence of loss of efficacy when B/F/TAF is administered without food.  
Metabolism: 
BIC has three stereo-centres and is produced as a single stereoisomer, but stability data and routine 
manufacturing data did not show a risk of epimerization. Therefore, there is no risk of inter-conversion.  
M20 (hydroxy-BIC-sulphate) and M15 (BIC-glucuronide) were the major metabolites identified in 
plasma. Considering the high proportion of M20 (>20%), further in-vitro interaction studies are needed 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
notably on the effect of M20 on CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2B6, 2D6 and transporters, such as P-gp and 
BCRP. 
PK in subjects with impaired renal function: 
In subjects with severe renal impairment, BIC AUC and Cmax were decreased by 0.73 and 0.80 fold 
respectively. This decrease of exposure seems paradoxical in case of renal impairment, and was 
unexpected given the PK profile of BIC (renal excretion of intact bictegravir is a minor pathway, ~1% 
of dose). However, unbound BIC exposure was similar between the 2 groups. As explained by the 
Applicant, the fractions of BIC plasma protein binding in individual subjects overlapped between the 2 
groups, with the percentages of unbound plasma BIC ranging from 0.43% to 0.63%, except in 1 
subject with severe renal impairment. This subject showed an unexpectedly higher percentage of 
unbound plasma BIC (2.28%), which may have led to lower BIC exposure and shorter BIC half-life 
compared with the other subjects in the study, despite no medical history or concomitant medications 
explaining this anomaly. When data from this subject were excluded, GLSM ratios for AUClast, AUCinf, 
and Cmax were 87.44%, 87.51%, and 90.12%, respectively, when subjects with severe renal 
impairment were compared with subjects with normal renal function. The lack of clinical relevance of 
such BIC decrease of exposure is endorsed. 
PK in subjects with impaired hepatic function: 
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, BIC AUC and Cmax were decreased by 0.58 and 0.63 
fold respectively. This decrease of exposure seems paradoxical in case of hepatic impairment, notably 
given that BIC is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism.  
The higher percentage of unbound fraction of BIC in subjects with hepatic impairment may be due to 
the decreased production of albumin in these subjects, resulting in lower plasma protein binding of 
BIC, which is highly protein bound. 
Based on the mean (%CV) BIC Ctau value of 2610 (35.2) ng/mL following administration of B/F/TAF to 
HIV-infected subjects (N = 1193) in the Phase 3 clinical studies (representing an IQ of 16.1), a 
potential decrease of approximately 23% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment would 
represent a Ctau value 12.4-fold above the paEC95 (162 ng/mL) against wild type HIV-1 virus. 
Additionally, the lack of an exposure-efficacy relationship for BIC over an IQ range of 4.7 to 40.1 
following administration of B/F/TAF in the Phase 3 clinical studies confirms that this small decrease in 
BIC exposure in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment is not deemed significant. In accordance 
to the Applicant, the small difference in free BIC exposure is not clinically relevant, and subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment may take B/F/TAF with or without food. 
Interactions 
In vitro, BIC is a substrate of UGT1A1, CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP. BIC is not a substrate of OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3. BIC is a weak CYP3A4, OCT2 and MATE1 inhibitor, and has demonstrated in vitro inducing 
effect on CYP3A4, 2B6, P-gp and UGT1A1, without relevant clinical consequences in vivo. BIC is not 
expected to affect exposure of drugs the metabolism of which is UGT1A1-dependant. In vitro, BIC is 
not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, OATP1B1, 1B3, OCT1, OAT1. 
In study GS-US-380-3908 (ddi metformin), B/F/TAF significantly increases metformin AUC τ about 39% 
with an 90%CI [131%-148]. Beyond the PD effect of metformin regardless the HIV patient status, the 
safety profile of the biguanide could be impacted due to renal impaired function that frequently occurs 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in HIV- and diabetic patients. In this clinical situation, metformin exposure could be more pronounced 
increasing the risk of metformin related adverse events. Caution, and eventually a dose adjustment is, 
then, advised in patients having a moderate renal function. 
When B/F/TAF is given simultaneously with antacids under fasted conditions, BIC AUC and C24h 
substantially decrease, more than with rifampicin, about 79%. This interaction can be compensated by 
staggering the administration of BIC 2 hours before antacids. When administered 2 hours after, about 
a half of BIC exposure decreases, in a same magnitude as rifabutin combination. Consequently, 
B/F/TAF should not begiven simultaneously and in fasted conditions with magnesium or aluminium-
containing antacids; B/F/TAF is recommended 2 hours before, or with food 2 hours after magnesium or 
aluminium-containing antacids.  
No DDI study has been performed on the effect of H2-antagonists (e.g. ranitidine) or proton-pump 
inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole) on BIC pharmacokinetics, because BIC absorption, unlike that of other 
INSTIs, is not pH dependent under physiologically relevant conditions. This is confirmed by population 
PK analyses indicating that the extent of BIC absorption was unaffected by PPIs:

Pharmacodynamics/antiviral activity: 
The antiviral properties of BIC and DTG were compared. 
In vitro data suggest that BIC is better than RAL and EVG and at least equivalent to DTG in terms of 
antiviral activity and resistance profile. In addition, some particularities might contribute to improve its 
properties against HIV strains with INSTI-RAM: 
BIC has a longer dissociation T1/2 from HIV-1 integrase/DNA complexes than DTG, which may be 
associated to a higher barrier to resistance. 
The antiviral activity of BIC against several HIV strains with INSTI-RAM is at least similar to DTG but 
also less impacted than DTG by some primary mutations (notably for the mutations G140S + Q148R ± 
additional INSTI mutation). 
On the other hand, a study has shown a higher level of resistance to BIC (susceptibility decreased by 
44-fold) than DTG (susceptibility decreased by 26-fold) with the mutations T66I + E138K + Q148K.  
Finally, because BIC and F/TAF have a high genetic barrier to the development of resistance, the 
emergence of resistance with the combination B/F/TAF is expected to be low in clinical practice.  
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, despite pharmacodynamics properties, the clinical development of BIC has been confined to 
patients with viral strains not harbouring INSTI-R. As for DTG, if BIC were to be developed in patients 
with INSTI-R testing a higher dose would have to be considered. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of BIC/F/TAF has been sufficiently characterized. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Primary studies that support the efficacy of the B/F/TAF (50/200/25 mg) FDC are two Phase 3 studies 
in HIV-infected, ART-naive adults (Studies GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490) and two Phase 3 
studies in HIV-infected, virologically suppressed adults (Studies GS-US-380-1844 and GS-US-380-
1878). These are supported by a Phase 2 study of BIC 75 mg + F/TAF in HIV-infected, ART-naive 
adults (Study GS-US-141-1475). 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Dose selection 
The 50-mg dose of BIC was selected for the B/F/TAF FDC based on the following studies: 
Study GS-US-141-1218 was a single-ascending doses (5, 25, 50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) and 
multiple-ascending doses (5, 25, 50, 100, or 300 mg once daily for 7 days) of single-agent BIC were 
well tolerated in healthy subjects, and a lack of drug-drug interaction was confirmed between BIC and 
F/TAF.  
- the dose-ranging proof-of-concept study GS-US-141-1219. Once-daily doses of single-agent BIC (5, 
25, 50, or 100 mg) administered for 10 days were also well tolerated, and led to dose-dependent 
decreases in HIV-1 viral load:

Table 18.  GS-US-141-1219: Time Weighted Average Change from Baseline up to Day 11 (DAVG11) in 
Plasma HIV-1 RNA (log10 copies/mL) (PP Analysis Set) 
a One subject in 5 mg group was excluded from the Per-Protocol (PP) Analysis Set as this subject's baseline HIV-1 RNA value was 173 copies/mL. 
b P-value was calculated from two-sided t test. 
The plasma exposure-response relationship was well characterized by an Emax model. Inhibitory 
quotient (IQ) was estimated by dividing pre-dose concentration on Day 11 (Ctau) by the in vitro 
protein-adjusted concentration that results in 95% inhibition (paIC95, 162 ng/mL - from study PC-
141-2032). BIC doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg once daily yielded median protein-adjusted IQ of 95% 
(paIQ95) values of 4.9, 13.4, and 25.9, respectively. Based on PK/PD analyses, exposure associated 
with a 75 mg dose of single agent BIC is expected to provide near-maximal virologic response, with a 
predicted paIQ95 of approximately 20, providing considerable coverage above the target concentration 
of 162 ng/mL (paIC95). 
The Phase 2 safety and efficacy study GS-US-141-1475 was a randomized, double-blinded study of the 
safety and efficacy of BIC 75 mg + F/TAF versus DTG 50 mg + F/TAF in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral 
treatment-naive adults. Treatments were administered without regard to food.  
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. 
Efficacy outcomes are as follows:

a N = 61 at Week 48. 
b Difference in percentages of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL between treatment groups and its 95% CI were calculated based on the baseline 
HIV-1 RNA stratum-adjusted MH proportion. 
For each of the subgroups analysed (age, race, baseline HIV-1 RNA, baseline CD4 cell count, and study 
drug adherence), there was no difference between the 2 treatment groups in the percentage of 
subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. 
At Week 48, mean changes from baseline in HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count were similar in both 
groups. 
Based on this study, a BIC dose at 75 mg was selected. 
The relative bioavailability study GS-US-141-1233 evaluated two FDC tablet formulations (B/F/TAF 
[50/200/25 mg] FDC and B/F/TAF [75/200/25 mg] FDC) compared with BIC 75 mg + F/TAF (200/25 
mg). According to these results, the FDC containing BIC 50 mg instead of BIC 75 mg was selected for 
further evaluation in Phase 3 studies, in order to achieve equivalent BIC exposure than with BIC 75 mg 
single component.

This primary endpoint was supported by the PP analysis, with virologic failure rates of B/F/TAF and 
DTG+F/TAF groups at respectively 1.1% and 0.8% (difference in percentages: 0.3%, 95.002% CI:

Figure 11.  GS-US-380-1878: Forest Plot of Treatment Difference in HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL by 
Subgroup at Week 48 Using the US FDA-Defined Snapshot Algorithm (FAS) 
Week 48 window was between Day 295 and 378 (inclusive). 
The difference in percentages of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL between treatment groups and its 95% CI were calculated based on an 
unconditional exact method using 2 inverted 1-isded tests. 
Regardless of prior treatment regimen (FTC/TDF vs ABC/3TC), the response rates in Study GS US-380-
1878 were high and similar between both treatment groups: 
- Baseline FTC/TDF-containing regimen: B/F/TAF 92.2%; SBR 89.3% 
- Baseline ABC/3TC-containing regimen: B/F/TAF 91.1%; SBR 86.4% 
Clinical studies in special populations 
There was no clinical study performed in special populations (notably paediatric subjects, HIV/HBV-co-
infected subjects or renal impaired HIV-infected subjects). 
The number of elderly subjects in the B/F/TAF clinical development program was limited. Age was 
tested as a potential covariate in both the BIC and TAF population PK analyses for B/F/TAF, but was 
determined to be not significant for both analytes. As such, age is not expected to substantially affect 
exposure of BIC or TAF. 
Supportive studies 
The week 48 results of study GS-US-380-1961 became available during the evaluation. 
Study GS-US-380-1961 is an ongoing, Phase 3, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of switching to B/F/TAF in HIV-infected, virologically suppressed women on a regimen 
consisting of GEN, STB, or ATV+RTV+FTC/TDF for ≥ 12 weeks prior to screening.  
Subjects were enrolled and treated at a total of 58 study centers in 5 countries: Uganda (27.0%, 127 
subjects), Russia (23.8%, 112 subjects), Thailand (21.5%, 101 subjects), US (15.3%, 72 subjects), 
and the Dominican Republic (12.3%, 58 subjects). Overall, 470 subjects (B/F/TAF 234, SBR 236) who 
were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug were included in both the Safety Analysis 
Set and FAS. 
As of the Week 48 data cut date, 98.1% of randomized and treated subjects (461 subjects; B/F/TAF 
98.7%, 231 subjects; SBR 97.5%, 230 subjects) had completed study drug in the randomized phase 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 0.2% of subjects (1 subject in the SBR group) were continuing study drug in the randomized 
phase. Overall, 1.7% of subjects (8 subjects; B/F/TAF 1.3%, 3 subjects; SBR 2.1%, 5 subjects) 
prematurely discontinued study drug in the randomized phase prior to the Week 48 data cut date. 
Reasons for premature discontinuation of study drug were generally comparable between treatment 
groups. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. Most of the 
women were not Hispanic/Latino (84.3%), and most were black (37.0%), white (28.3%), or Asian 
(21.7%). Median age was 39 years (range: 20 to 63 years). Median (Q1, Q3) body mass index was 
25.6 (22.1, 30.5) kg/m2. Baseline disease characteristics were generally similar between the 2 
treatment groups: the median (Q1, Q3) baseline CD4 cell count was 686 (541, 867) cells/μL, with 
83.2% of subjects having a baseline CD4 count ≥ 500 cells/µL. The median (Q1, Q3) baseline CD4% 
was 36.7% (31.1%, 42.6%). Most subjects were receiving GEN (53.0%, 249 subjects) or STB (41.9%, 
197 subjects) at baseline. The most common HIV risk factor was heterosexual sex (98.3% of 
subjects). Most subjects had asymptomatic HIV-1 infection (90.4%); 7.0% had symptomatic HIV-1 
infection, and 2.6% were diagnosed with AIDS. The median (Q1, Q3) eGFRCG at baseline was 100.8 
(84.0, 119.8) mL/min. 
The percentages of subjects in the FAS with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at Week 48 using the US FDA-
defined snapshot algorithm (primary endpoint) were similar between the 2 treatment groups (B/F/TAF 
1.7%; SBR 1.7%; difference in percentages: 0.0%, 95.001% CI: −2.9% to 2.9%). Because the upper 
bound of the 2-sided 95.001% CI of the difference between treatment groups (B/F/TAF − SBR) was 
less than the pre-specified 4% margin, switching to B/F/TAF was determined to be non-inferior to 
maintaining baseline regimen. Similarly, the percentages of subjects in the FAS with HIV-1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL and < 20 copies/mL at Week 48 using the US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm were similar 
between the 2 treatment groups.

* Other reasons include subjects who discontinued study drug due to investigator's discretion, subject decision, lost to follow-up, noncompliance with 
study drug, protocol violation, pregnancy, and study terminated by sponsor. 
P-value for the superiority test comparing the percentages of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL between treatment groups was from the CMH test 
stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum (<= 100,000 vs. > 100,000 copies/mL) and region stratum (US vs. ex-US). 
The difference in percentages of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL between treatment groups and its 95% CI was calculated based on the MH 
proportion adjusted by baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum (<= 100,000 vs. > 100,000 copies/mL) and region stratum (US vs. ex-US). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
There are 4 Phase 3 pivotal studies assessing B/F/TAF 50/200/25 mg: 2 in ART-naïve subjects, and 2 
in virologically supressed subjects. The design, statistical method, outcomes and inclusion/exclusion 
criteria are acceptable. The choice of the comparators (DTG-based regimen in the 2 studies in ART-
naïve subjects and in one switch study, PI-based regimen in the other switch study) is endorsed given 
DTG is the more effective and used INSTI, in comparison to raltegravir and elvitegravir. While this 
comparator has been used in both pivotal studies in TN patients, the backbone with DTG was different 
in both studies, ABC/3TC or F/TDF. The comparison of B/F/TAF to a PI-based regimen in a switch study 
provides additional data to reinforce the place of such INSTI with significant barrier of resistance into 
the HIV therapeutic strategy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of note, the comparison with DTG is done in TN and in virologically suppressed patients. 
Although a more stringent 10% non-inferiority margin would have been regarded as more appropriate 
than the 12% selected margin for the studies performed in ART-naïve subjects, ultimately results are 
overall compatible with a more stringent non inferiority margin. 
In  these  pivotal  studies,  enrolled  subjects  are  predominantly  white  homosexual  men  with  unaltered 
immune  function  and  asymptomatic  HIV  infection,  as  for  main  of  the  Phase  3  studies  in  HIV  clinical 
studies. The proportion of women and ART-naïve subjects with VL >100,000 c/mL is low (10-15%) but 
an additional switch study only performed in women confirms this non-inferiority. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The short-term monotherapy study suggested that 100 mg bictegravir might be slightly better than 50 
mg.  The  Applicant  initially  chose  75  mg  primarily  based  on  the  Emax  model.  The  choice  of  this  dose 
might be endorsed considering that the clinical development of BIC does not encompass patients with 
viral  strains  harbouring  INSTI-RAM,  where  higher  dose  might  have  been  required  as  for dolutegravir. 
Then,  the  dose  of  bictegravir  was  subsequently  lowered  to  50  mg  when  bictegravir  was  incorporated 
into the FDC with FTC and TAF based on PK data.  
While  it  is  clear  that  the  BIC  dose  was  to  be  different  as  part  of  the  FDC  vs  outside  the  FDC,  there 
might  still  be  some  room  for  maximizing  the  dose.  Nevertheless,  it  can  ultimately  be  acknowledged 
that the dose as selected has enabled to achieve non-inferiority of B/F/TAF vs DTG+2 NRTIs. However, 
it is expected that higher BIC dose would be required in the context of INI-RAM emergence. 
Overall, the efficacy endpoints support the non-inferiority of B/F/TAF compared to DTG-based regimen 
(FTC/TAF  or  ABC/3TC)  in  ART-naïve  subjects  and  when  switching  from  such  regimen  in  virologically 
suppressed  subjects.  These  results  are  supported  by  the  Per  Protocol  analyses  and  other  secondary 
endpoints, especially the changes from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count. In addition, 
the  switch  to  B/F/TAF  is  non-inferior  to  the  continuation  of  a  DRV-  or  ATV-based  regimen.  This  is 
consistent with the known efficacy of DTG in comparison to PI. The rates of virological success or lack 
of efficacy with B/F/TAF are consistent with the historical data from F/TAF-studies. 
In  the  Phase  3  studies  comparing  B/F/TAF  vs  DTG+F/TAF  or  ABC/DTG/3TC  in  ART-naïve  subjects, 
there  is  a  trend  for  lower  response  rate  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  high  viral  load  (>100,000 
c/ml)  treated  with  B/F/TAF.  It  is  noteworthy  that  given  that  ABC/3TC  is  somewhat  regarded  as  not 
maximizing  efficacy  in  patients  with  high  viral  load,  the  trend  for  higher  efficacy  of  DTG  was  more 
pronounced  when  DTG  was  combined  with  the  same  backbone  as  for  BIC  (i.e.  FTAF)  than  when  DTG 
was  combined  with  ABC-3TC.  Given  that  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  high  viral  load  is  regarded  as 
discriminatory,  the  results  in  patients  with  high  viral  load  might  translate  a  somewhat  lower 
performance  of  BIC  as  compared  to  DTG  which  might  be  related  to  a  non-maximized  dose  of  BIC. 
While  it  can  be  acknowledged  that  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  adherence  <95%  the  trend 
favouring  dolutegravir  might  be  driven  by  the  missing  data  rather  than  virologic  failure  (which  would 
otherwise  have  argued  that  limited  adherence  might  be  more  pejorative  for  bictegravir  than 
dolutegravir), this is not the case for the overall analysis in patients with high viral load. Overall, the 
trend in favour of dolutegravir in patients with high viral load as reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
In  studies  GS-US-380-1490  (B/F/TAF  vs  DTG+F/TAF  in  ART-naïve  subjects)  and  GS-US-380-1844 
(B/F/TAF  vs  ABC/DTG/3TC  in  virologically  suppressed  subjects),  there  is  a  slightly  higher  rate  of 
subjects  who  discontinued  from  B/F/TAF  treatment  due  to  adverse  events,  although  not  statistically 
significant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Across all these studies, no INSTI-RAM had emerged in the B/F/TAF groups, as in the DTG groups. This 
is consistent with the favourable resistance profile of BIC, with a barrier to resistance development 
expected to be similar to DTG. However, as already stated the efficacy of B/F/TAF in subjects with 
history of virological failure under INSTI therapy was not evaluated. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
B/F/TAF 50/200/25 mg has been demonstrated to be overall non inferior to DTG + FTC/TAF or 
ABC/3TC in ART-naïve or virologically suppressed subjects without history of INSTI resistance. High 
percentage of patients have achieved HIV RNA level <50 copies/ml at week 48 (≥90% at Week 48) 
and this demonstration is derived from three well-designed studies (double blind, large sample and 
primary endpoint in line with EU guidelines) with comparable populations enrolled. In addition, an 
additional switch study demonstrated the non-inferiority of B/F/TAF vs DRV- or ATV-based regimen, 
which is consistent with DTG. The clinical demonstration can support the use of BFTAF for the 
treatment of adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) without any known 
mutations associated with resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 1511 subjects have received at least 1 dose of B/F/TAF in the Phase 2 and 3 studies, 
including 1206 subjects from the randomized phases of the Phase 3 studies. This population exposure 
to B/F/TAF exceeds the requirements of the ICH E1 guideline for the safety evaluation of drugs, but 
the number of subjects with high duration of treatment (≥72 weeks) is very limited. The duration of 
exposure was similar between groups within each study.

(Safety Analysis Set) 
Duration of exposure to study drug was the number of weeks between the first dose and the last dose of randomized study drug. 
For subjects who had prematurely discontinued randomized study drug, if the last dose date of randomized study drug was completely missing or only year was known, the latest of randomized study drug start and end dates or 
randomized clinic and laboratory visit dates (excluding the 30-day follow-up visit date) was used to impute the last dose date. 
For subjects who had not prematurely discontinued randomized study drug, the data cut date was used to impute the last dose date.

Adverse events 
The adverse event (AE) profile was generally similar in ART-naive and virologically suppressed adults,

Serious adverse event/deaths 
Across the Phase 2-3 studies, 7 deaths were reported: 4 in subjects receiving B/F/TAF (Studies GS-US-
380-1490, GS-US-380-1844, or GS-US-380-1878), 2 in subjects receiving DTG+F/TAF (Study GS-US-
380-1490), and 1 in a subject receiving boosted ATV + FTC/TDF (Study GS-US-380-1878). None of 
the deaths was considered related to study drug by the Applicant. No treatment-emergent deaths were 
reported in Phase 1 studies with single-agent BIC or regimens containing BIC and F/TAF. 
The incidence of SAEs in Phase 2-3 studies was comparable between treatment groups within each 
study.

The incidence of non-infectious, non-congenital hepatic AEs was comparable between the B/F/TAF and 
comparator group within each Phase 3 study and within the pooled analysis. 
No subject treated with B/F/TAF had a non-infectious, non-congenital hepatic SAE or discontinued 
study drugs due to hepatic AEs. No subject treated with B/F/TAF or a comparator met Hy’s Law 
criteria. 
No clinically relevant median changes from baseline were observed in alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, 
or total bilirubin for the B/F/TAF or comparator group in any of the Phase 3 studies. Transaminase 
elevations were reported in a higher proportion in virologically suppressed subjects who switched 
treatment to B/F/TAF than in subjects in the comparator groups. However, these transaminase 
elevations were mainly Grade 1 or 2, resolved without B/F/TAF discontinuation and were not 
associated with AEs. 
Graded total bilirubin increases occurred in a higher percentage of subjects treated with B/F/TAF than 
the comparator in Studies GS-US-380-1489, GS-US-380-1490, and GS-US-380-1844; however, the 
increases were primarily Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity and were not associated with hepatic AEs or 
other liver-related laboratory abnormalities.  
The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent liver-related laboratory abnormalities was 
comparable between treatment groups within each Phase 3 study and within the pooled analysis (with 
the exception of total bilirubin in Study GS-US-380-1878, due to ATV treatment in some subjects in 
the SBR group). 
Bone safety 
B/F/TAF demonstrated a bone safety profile comparable with that of ABC/DTG/3TC, a regimen that is 
not associated with bone toxicity. In both ART-naive (study GS-US-380-1489) and virologically 
suppressed subjects (GS-US-380-1844), mean (SD) percentage changes from baseline in hip and 
spine BMD were comparable between the B/F/TAF and ABC/DTG/3TC treatment groups.

Renal safety 
B/F/TAF demonstrated a renal safety profile comparable with that of ABC/DTG/3TC, a regimen that is 
not associated with renal toxicity, and an improved renal safety profile compared with a regimen 
consisting of boosted ATV or DRV plus FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC. 
No subject had proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi Syndrome) or discontinued study drugs due to 
a renal and urinary disorder or associated investigation AE. 
Across the Phase 3 studies, changes from baseline in serum creatinine and eGFRCG were consistent 
with the known inhibitory effect of BIC or DTG on renal tubular secretion via OCT2 and/or MATE1. 
These changes were not clinically relevant and are not reflective of changes in actual glomerular 
filtration rate. Changes in serum creatinine and eGFRCG were observed by Week 4 and remained stable 
thereafter through Week 48:

Overall, the incidence of AEs in the eye disorders SOC and the incidence of AEs potentially related to 
uveitis were low and comparable between treatment groups in the 4 Phase 3 B/F/TAF studies. 
Clinically, none of the AEs potentially related to uveitis were considered representative of an actual 
case of posterior uveitis.

Psychiatric disorders 
Adverse events based on the suicide/self-injury Standard MedDRA Query were infrequent in the 4 
Phase 3 B/F/TAF studies through 48 weeks of treatment. Most subjects who experienced a suicide-
related AE when receiving B/F/TAF had a pre-existing history of depression or mental illness. 
Table 30.  GS-US-380-1489, GS-US-380-1490, GS-US-380-1844, GS-US-380-1878: Suicide Events 
by Suicide/Self-Injury SMQ (Safety Analysis Set) 
Laboratory findings 
B/F/TAF demonstrated a clinical laboratory safety profile similar to that of comparator regimens. There 
were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in the B/F/TAF group or differences between the 
B/F/TAF and comparator groups in median values for hematology or clinical chemistry parameters 
(including metabolic parameters), and median values were generally within reference ranges. Of note, 
higher rates of minor transaminase increases were observed in the B/F/TAF groups than in the DTG-
containing groups, but were not considered clinically significant. 
Safety in special populations 
The AE profile for subjects receiving B/F/TAF was not affected by sex, age and race. 
Renal impairment 
In study GS-US-141-1479, BIC 75 mg was administered in subjects with severe impaired renal 
function (n=10) compared with control subjects with normal renal function (n=8). One AE in each 
renal function group was considered related to study drug by the investigator (nausea in a subject with 
severe renal impairment and headache in a subject with normal renal function). The safety profile of 
BIC was similar between the 2 renal function groups. 
Hepatic impairment 
In study GS-US-141-1478, BIC 75 mg was administered in subjects with normal (n=10) or moderate 
(n=10) hepatic impairment. The AEs considered related to study drug by the investigator were 
reported in 3 subjects (30%) with moderate hepatic impairment and in none of the normal matched 
control subjects. These events were headache (2 subjects) and somnolence (1 subject).

HBV/HCV-coinfection 
In HIV/HBV-co-infected subjects (14 subjects in study GS-US-380-1490 and 14 subjects in study GS-
US-380-1878), the safety profile of B/F/TAF was similar to that in patients with HIV mono-infection. In 
study GS-US-380-1490, 1 subject in the B/F/TAF group had a confirmed on-treatment ALT flare 
(defined as ALT > 10 x ULN and ALT > 2 x baseline on 2 consecutive occasions) at Week 12. The ALT 
flare was reported as a Grade 2 AE of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome that was not 
considered related to study drug. No hepatic AEs were reported for this subject. Another HIV/HBV co-
infected subject in the B/F/TAF group, with normal ALT (30 U/L) and AST (24 U/L) at baseline, 
experienced Grade 3 ALT (316 U/L) and Grade 2 AST (136 U/L) at Week 8, both of which resolved to 
within the normal range by Week 24. One additional subject (DTG+F/TAF group) experienced Grade 1 
ALT and AST elevations. In study GS-US-380-1878, 3 subjects in the B/F/TAF group experienced 
treatment-emergent Grade 1 ALT elevation, one of whom also experienced Grade 1 AST elevation. One 
subject in the SBR group experienced Grade 2 total bilirubin abnormality. 
In HIV/HCV-co-infected subjects (n=25), elevations in AST and ALT occurred more frequently than in 
the subjects without viral hepatitis infection. The incidence of graded AST and ALT elevations for 
HIV/HCV baseline-co-infected subjects was similar between the 2 treatment groups. 
Pregnancy 
No adequate and well-controlled studies of B/F/TAF or its components have been conducted in 
pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of BIC, FTC, or TAF 
with respect to pregnancy, embryonal and fetal development, parturition, or postnatal development. 
B/F/TAF should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to 
the fetus. No clinically relevant concerns are apparent from review of available pregnancy data in 
clinical studies (11 pregnancies reported in the Phase 3 studies, including 5 subjects treated with 
B/F/TAF) or from Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) data for FTC and from the limited data for 
TAF. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The rate of discontinuation due to AE with B/F/TAF is low (≤2%), similarly to the comparators groups. 
These AEs are generally gastro-intestinal, neuropsychiatric or allergic disorders. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
As expected, the safety profile of B/F/TAF is similar to DTG+FTC/TAF. The more frequent AEs are 
gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting), headache, fatigue and insomnia (<5% of 
subjects). It has to be underlined that only 48 weeks data from the ongoing longer term pivotal phase 
3 studies have been made available.  
The relevant aspects of the safety profile of B/F/TAF are: 
Hepatotoxicity: Although no liver hypersensitivity reaction or severe drug-induced liver occurred in 
subjects treated with B/F/TAF, higher rates of transaminases elevations and hyperbilirubinemia were 
observed compared to DTG-based regimen. These elevations were mild and transient. Considering the 
available data in monkeys which showed bile duct hyperplasia a at the higher doses of B tested (1000 
mg/kg/day) not always reversible and the cases of increased ALT activities also reported at the highest 
doses and the potential competition of B for the UGT1A1 enzyme with unconjugated bilirubin, the risk 
of hepatobiliary disorders is a potential concern for bictegravir-containing regimen. Of note, an 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018 
Page 94/104 
 
 
  
amendment to the study protocols GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1844 was made to include 
recommendations for the management of potential hepatobiliary toxicity. The recommendation was to 
highlight the potential hepatobiliary toxicity of bictegravir based on data available in monkeys at the 
highest dose tested (biliary hyperplasia and hepatocyte hypertrophy) and that further investigations 
might be necessary in case of signs/ laboratory abnormalities suggestive of hepatobiliary disorders. 
Hepatotoxicity will be actively monitored through PSURs. 
Renal disorders: as DTG, BIC also increases serum creatinine level within the first weeks of treatment 
and remained stable thereafter, due to the inhibition of the transporters OCT2 and MATE-1. This is not 
considered to be clinically relevant since do not reflect a change in glomerular filtration rate, but 
should be considered for the biological monitoring of renal impaired subjects treated with B/F/TAF. 
Psychiatric disorders: depression, suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour (particularly in patients with 
pre-existing history of psychiatric illness) are a class-effect of integrase inhibitors and listed in the 
SmPC of dolutegravir, raltegravir and elvitegravir. The rate of suicide events is ~1% across the 
different study groups, and seems not increased with B/F/TAF compared to the other INSTI. However, 
considering the limited number of patients included in all the studies, it is difficult to draw any 
conclusion. At least, the level of risk might be similar with BIC than with DTG. Outside the suicide 
events, a number of other psychiatric AEs have been reported with B/F/TAF. Based on the data 
provided on psychiatric disorders, 1/3 of patients included in the pivotal studies had “medical history of 
psychiatric disorders”. Overall, similar patterns of psychiatric disorders (qualitative and quantitative 
aspects) were observed in comparative studies versus DTG. The CHMP requested the inclusion of 
psychiatric disorders in section 4.8 of the SmPC in line with other integrase inhibitors. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on safety data provided it can be concluded that no new risks or safety issues have been 
identified for the FDC of BIC/F/TAF.

cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 7 February 2018. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of bictegravir with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers bictegravir to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Descovy (emtricitabine/ tenofovir alafenamide). The 
bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Biktarvy (bictegravir / emtricitabine / 
tenofovir alafenamide) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active 
substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
While untreated HIV-1 infection remains a life threatening disease, for years it has become a chronic 
disease with combined antiretroviral therapy being early introduced to prevent pejorative impact of 
immune deficiency (notably including opportunistic infections in patients with CD4<200/mm3). 
The goal of ARV therapy for HIV-1 infection is to delay disease progression and prolong survival by 
achieving maximal and durable suppression of HIV-1 replication. Thanks to combined antiretroviral 
therapies nowadays available high level of viral suppression (>85% of patients with HIV RNA <50 
copies/ml) can be achieved in HIV infected patients.  
B/F/TAF is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) 
without any known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components. B/F/TAF is a 
FDC combining a novel INSTI, bictegravir (BIC), with the backbone emtricitabine (F)/tenofovir 
Assessment report  
EMA/293559/2018 
Page 98/104 
 
 
  
alafenamide (TAF), already available as Descovy. Therefore, no other ARV are expected to be 
coadministered with B/F/TAF, considered as a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV-1 
infection. B/F/TAF is intended to be administered in subjects infected with HIV-1 without any known 
mutations associated with resistance to the individual components (i.e. including patients in first line 
treatment and virologically supressed patients). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Multiple therapeutic options have become available over time notably in first line therapy. Other STR 
are already available on the market for first line therapy, combining 2 NRTI s + 1 NNRTI, 1 INSTI or 1 
boosted-PI.  
Overall, B/F/TAF is not aimed at responding to an unmet medical need, but rather as an alternative 
options to other first line antiretroviral regimens.   
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development of B/F/TAF is supported by 4 Phase 3 studies performed in ART-naïve subjects 
(GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490) or virologically-suppressed subjects (GS-US-380-1844 and 
GS-US-380-1878) and a small underpowered phase 2 study GS-US-1475 in treatment naïve. In 
studies GS-US-380-1489, GS-US-380-1490 and GS-US-380-1844 the comparator was a dolutegravir-
based regimen which is relevant given its potency and its wide use in clinical practice (through 
ABC/DTG/3TC). Study GS-US-380-1878 is aimed at substantiating the switch to Protease inhibitor (PI) 
based regimen. The design and methodology of these studies are endorsed (non-inferiority with 
standard primary endpoints).  
In addition, the bioequivalence study GS-US-141-1233 is pivotal for the selection of a bictegravir dose 
as part of the FDC. Indeed, it was shown that a higher exposure of BIC was observed when BIC 75 mg 
was contained within the FDC as compared to BIC 75 mg+FTAF leading to select 50 mg of BIC for the 
FDC. The selected regimen of the FDC (BIC 50mg) FTAF is a once daily regimen with or without food 
as tested in the phase III studies. 
It is important to underline that the clinical development of BIC encompassed patients without viral 
strains harbouring INSTI-RAM, despite its similarly enhanced pharmacodynamics properties as 
compared to other INSTI. A higher BIC dose (75 mg) might have to be considered in such situation. 
BIC-FTAF targets first line and virologically suppressed patients without viral strains harbouring 
mutations of resistance to any components of the FDC and to the INI class. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Overall, the efficacy endpoints support the non-inferiority of B/F/TAF compared to DTG-based regimen 
(FTC/TAF or ABC/3TC) in ART-naïve subjects and when switching from such regimen in virologically 
suppressed subjects. These results are supported by the Per Protocol analyses and other secondary 
endpoints, especially the changes from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count. In addition, 
the switch to B/F/TAF is non-inferior to the continuation of a DRV- or ATV-based regimen. This is 
consistent with the known efficacy of DTG in comparison to PI. High level of virologic suppression is 
achieved and in the B/F/TAF groups and the DTG-based regimen groups, no subject developed 
treatment-emergent resistance to any study drug. 
In ART-naïve subjects, B/F/TAF is non-inferior to DTG-based regimen (primary endpoint: percentage of 
subjects with HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 48 non inferiority margin of 12%; difference in

percentages: -0.6% [-4.8% to 3.6%] vs ABC/DTG/3TC; -3.5% [-7.9% to 1.0%] vs DTG+F/TAF). 
While disputable 12% large non inferiority margin was selected, results are compatible with more 
stringent margin. 
In virologically-suppressed subjects (primary endpoint: percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 
c/mL at Week 48, non-inferiority margin of 4%), B/F/TAF is non-inferior to ABC/DTG/3TC (difference in 
percentages: 0.7% [-1.0% to 2.8%]) and PI-based regimen (difference in percentages: 0.0% [-2.5% 
to 2.5%]). 
The efficacy results were similar between the treatment groups for all of the subgroups analysed (by 
age, sex, race, baseline CD4 cell count, region and study drug adherence). 
Adherence is required to prevent loss of virologic suppression and potential development of drug 
resistance. The adherence to ARV regimen is expected to be improved by reducing the pill burden and 
dosing frequency. Thus, the use of this once-daily single-tablet regimen such as B/F/TAF is expected to 
favour adherence and consequently optimise virologic outcomes. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the Phase 3 studies comparing B/F/TAF vs DTG+F/TAF or ABC/DTG/3TC in ART-naïve subjects, 
there is a trend for lower response rate in the subgroup of patients with high viral load (>100,000 
c/ml) treated with B/F/TAF. It is noteworthy that given that ABC/3TC is somewhat regarded as not 
maximizing efficacy in patients with high viral load, the trend for higher efficacy of DTG was more 
pronounced when DTG was combined with the same backbone as for BIC (i.e. FTAF) than when DTG 
was combined with ABC-3TC. Given that the subgroup of patients with high viral load is regarded as 
discriminatory, the results in patients with high viral load might translate a somewhat lower 
performance of BIC as compared to DTG which might be related to a non-maximized dose of BIC. The 
results of the subgroup analyses in patients with high viral load at baseline are reflected in section 5.1. 
Due to the high level of virologic suppression achieved the resistance pattern of BIC remains to be 
established. Possibility of rescue therapy with dolutegravir (with higher dose for INSTI-R strain) is 
unlikely given the overlap of resistance profile, but there are several options for rescue therapy with 
other cARTs. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of B/F/TAF appears similar to that DTG+F/TAF. The more frequent AEs are 
gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), headache, fatigue and insomnia (<5% of 
subjects). The rates of Grade 3 or 4 related AE and AE leading to discontinuation are low (≤ 2%).  
No liver hypersensitivity reaction or severe drug-induced liver were observed, but the rates of 
transaminases elevations and hyperbilirubinemia were higher with B/F/TAF compared to DTG-based 
regimen. These elevations were mainly minor and transient. 
Similarly to DTG, increases of creatinine level were observed within the first weeks of treatment by 
B/F/TAF. These increases remained stable thereafter and are due to the inhibition of the transporters 
OCT2 and MATE-1. There was no relevant renal AE, including tubulopathy. 
Psychiatric disorders are a class-effect of integrase inhibitors and therefore were scrutinized within 
B/F/TAF application. The rate of suicide events is ≈ 1% across the different studies and is not different 
between B/F/TAF and DTG groups. Most subjects with a suicide-related AE while receiving B/F/TAF had 
a history of depression or mental illness.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Only 48 weeks data from the ongoing longer term pivotal phase 3 studies have been made available 
which carries some level of uncertainties on the long term safety of bictegravir  
Given the non-clinical findings in favour of hepatobiliary impact [based on data available in monkeys at 
the highest dose tested (biliary hyperplasia and hepatocyte hypertrophy]), and the particular 
awareness of physicians through a dedicated amendment across the clinical studies to recommend 
further investigations in case of signs/ laboratory abnormalities suggestive of hepatobiliary disorders 
(notably appropriate imaging consultation with a specialist), such a safety issue should be kept under 
scrutiny for the future use of the drug in the real life setting. 
Moreover, as for other TAF containing regimen, attention of physicians should be warranted on the 
potential risk of nephrotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Bictegravir is a potent new integrase inhibitor close to dolutegravir as regards its enhanced 
pharmacodynamics properties as compared to raltegravir and elvitegravir. A high level of virologic 
suppression has been achieved in the two phase 3 studies versus dolutegravir, although a trend for 
somewhat lower performance of BIC as compared to DTG in the discriminatory high viral load strata 
(>100 000 copies/ml) is observed and is shown in section 5.1. No emergence of resistance has been 
observed across the development programme. 
BIC safety profile is similar to that of other components of the INSTI class, with mainly potential 
psychiatric disorders.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
BFTAF represents a new potent once daily single tablet (STR) regimen. This STR do not address a high 
medical need, but provides a new option to the HIV therapeutic armamentarium with a different 
backbone to ABC/DTG/3TC (acknowledging the need for HLA testing for minimizing the risk of 
hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir contained in ABC/DTG/3TC).  
The clinical demonstration can support the use of BFTAF for the treatment of adults infected with 
human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) without any known mutations associated with resistance to 
the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Biktarvy is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Biktarvy is favourable in the following indication: 
Biktarvy is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) 
without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or 
tenofovir (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

Description 
The trial was conducted as part of the phase 3 development programme for turoctocog alfa, to investigate 
the efficacy and safety of the drug for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes in previously treated 
Chinese patients with haemophilia A. 
The trial was conducted at 10 sites in 1 country (mainland China). Initiation date was 12Dec16, primary 
completion date was 16Mar18, and global completion date was 12Dec18.  
Data cut-off was 15May19. Date of the report is 03Jun19. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objective: 
•  To evaluate the clinical efficacy of turoctocog alfa in treatment of bleeding episodes in Chinese patients 
with severe haemophilia A (FVIII ≤1%) 
Secondary objectives: 
•  To assess the safety of turoctocog alfa in terms of immunogenicity 
•  To evaluate the clinical efficacy of turoctocog alfa during prophylaxis treatment 
•  To evaluate the consumption of turoctocog alfa during prophylaxis treatment and treatment of bleeding 
episodes 
•  PK phase only: To investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of turoctocog alfa after single 
dose injection 
•  Surgery only: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of turoctocog alfa during surgical procedures 
•  To evaluate impact of turoctocog alfa treatment on patient’s health related quality of life (HRQOL 
Study design 
This was a single-country, multi-centre, open-label and non-randomised trial investigating the efficacy and 
safety of turoctocog alfa in previously treated Chinese males from 0 years with severe haemophilia A (FVIII 
≤1%) living in mainland China. 
The trial consisted of a main phase and an extension phase. In addition, a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 
18 patients were to be enrolled in a PK session. This final report describes the trial results at the end of main 
phase visit. 
Patients were administered turoctocog alfa i.v. as prophylaxis every second day or 3 times weekly, or as on-
demand for the treatment of bleeds when necessary, and at the discretion of the investigator. In the main 
phase, switching between regimens was not permitted unless a patient developed low-titer FVIII inhibitors;

however, adjustment of the dose and dosing frequency was allowed. Once in the extension phase, patients 
had the option of switching from on-demand to prophylaxis at will. Patients could undergo surgery at any 
time during the trial as long as turoctocog alfa was used on and/or treatment of bleeds. The protocol 
specified that the maximum dose of turoctocog alfa per injection should not exceed 100 IU/kg BW. 
Study population /Sample size 
A sample size of 60 patients was considered as sufficient to evaluate the safety and efficacy of turoctocog 
alfa. A total of 71 patients were screened; 3 patients were screening failures. The remaining 68 patients (full 
analysis set) received at least one dose of turoctocog alfa. 
Of the 68 patients exposed to treatment, 51 patients started the main phase in a prophylaxis regimen while 
17 patients initiated the trial with on-demand treatment. Two (2) patients (one from each regimen) withdrew 
at will from the main phase; the remaining 66 patients completed the main phase of the trial period. 
A total of 17 patients were included in the PK assessment during the main phase.  
Of the 66 main-phase completers, 2 patients in the prophylaxis regimen withdrew before starting the 
extension phase. Of the 64 patients who initiated the extension phase, 59 patients started the extension 
phase in a prophylaxis regimen while 5 patients started the extension phase in an on-demand regimen. Of 
these 5 patients, 1 patient later switched to a prophylaxis regimen Two (2) patients withdrew during the 
extension phase and the remaining 62 patients completed the extension period (for participant flow, see 
figure, below) 
Treatments 
Patients in the PK session were administered a single dose of 50 ±5 IU/kg BW turoctocog alfa followed by 
blood sampling for PK evaluation over a maximum of 3 days dependent on age. 
In the prophylaxis regimen the recommended starting dose was 30 IU/kg for children <12 years and 25 
IU/kg for adolescents and adults ≥12 years. Prophylaxis doses specified in the protocol ranged from 25−50

IU/kg BW (once every second day) or 25−60 IU/kg BW (3 times weekly) for patients <12 years, and 20−40 
IU/kg BW (every second day) or 20−50 IU/kg BW (3 times weekly) for patients ≥12 years. 
Bleeds were treated with one or more turoctocog alfa i.v. bolus injections as determined by the investigator. 
The protocol provided the following guide for dosing during bleeding episodes: 
Dose (IU) = weight (kg)*desired factor level (IU/dL)*0.5. 
In surgery, the investigator decided appropriate dosing and could refer to the following guidance in the 
protocol: 
•  Minor surgery (including tooth extraction): Maintain FVIII levels at 30−60 IU/dL and repeat dosing 
every 24 hours as needed until healing is achieved. 
•  Major surgery: Maintain FVIII levels at 80−100 IU/dL pre- and postoperatively by repeat injection every 
8−24 hours until adequate wound healing, then adjust therapy for at least 7 more days to maintain 
FVIII levels at 30−60 IU/dL. 
Batch numbers for turoctocog alfa were: 
•  500 IU/vial: FR40415, FR40454 and GR40074 
•  2000 IU/vial: FR40139, FR40248, FR40429 and GR40206 
The planned duration of treatment was approximately 6 months per patient in the main phase, up to 
approximately 18 months in the extension phase which allowed both patients on prophylaxis and on-demand 
treatment. During the main phase some patients could also be included in a PK session.

Definition of analysis sets 
Both the FAS and safety analysis set included all dosed patients with data after dosing. All main descriptions 
and analyses of efficacy were based on the FAS. The analyses of safety were based on the safety analysis 
set. 
Efficacy 
•  Primary endpoint: The haemostatic effect of turoctocog alfa was summarised by age group and 
regimen in frequency tables containing counts and percentages and assessed on a predefined four-point 
scale: excellent, good, moderate and none. Data was presented separately for the main phase and the 
combined main and extension phases. Treatment responses rated good or excellent were counted as 
treatment successes while those judged moderate, none or documented ‘missing’ were accrued as 
treatment failures. The effect was also summarised by cause, site, and classification of bleed. 
•  The number of bleeds (total bleeds assessed as annual bleeding rate) per patient was presented by 
regimen for the main phase and the combined main and extension phases and included only treatment 
requiring bleeds. A further sensitivity analysis calculated the annualised bleeding rate for both treatment 
requiring and non- treatment requiring bleeds. 
•  The annualised bleeding rate (ABR) was analysed by a negative binomial model and presented with 
confidence intervals by trial phase and treatment regimen. 
•  Consumption of turoctocog alfa for treatment of bleeds (average dose to treat a bleed, number of 
injections and IU/kg per bleed) during the main phase and the combined main and extension phases 
was summarised and listed according to age, regimen, and total. 
•  Evaluation of PRO data was based on changes to HAEM-QoL scores (range 0−100) and the results were 
summarised and listed. 
Safety 
•  The incidence rate of FVIII inhibitors (≥0.6 BU) presented as the percentage of patients developing 
FVIII inhibitors was calculated and a 1-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit provided based on an exact 
calculation for a binomial distribution. For the calculation of the incidence rate the numerator was to 
include all patients with FVIII inhibitors while the denominator was to include all patients in the trial 
exposed to turoctocog alfa. 
• 
Frequency of AEs and SAEs reported during the main phase of 6 months and the combined main and 
extension phases were summarised by frequency of events and frequency of patients with any event. 
The statistical output provided summary tables of events by treatment period, age group, regimen and 
total events. 
Pharmacokinetics 
•  This final report included the full PK evaluation with PK endpoints presented by the mean, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum value, the geometric mean and 95% confidence interval for the 
geometric mean.

•  Where applicable, the investigator/surgeon evaluated haemostatic effect during surgery on the four-
point scale (excellent, good, moderate and none) twice: on the day of surgery (Day 1) and on the last 
day in the post-operative period that the patient was at the trial/surgery site. 
•  The trial assessed loss of blood and requirement for transfusions on the day of surgery (Day 1) and 
during the operative period (Days 2−7) or until the last day the patient was at the trial/surgery site, 
whichever came first.

Baseline data 
The trial population included Chinese males, 2 to 53 years of age with severe haemophilia A (FVIII ≤1%). 
The mean (SD) time the patients have had the diagnosis of haemophilia was 11.2 (10.4) years from the time 
to diagnosis increased with age as expected; the mean for smaller children being 2.8 and the mean for adults 
being 25.2 years. 
In the 1 year prior to enrolment in the trial, a total of 40 patients were on prophylaxis at some time point, 
while a total of 32 patients were on-demand at some time point. The mean ABR during the 1 year prior to 
trial was 53.7 bleeds/patient/year for patients during on-demand regimen. Four (4) patients who switched 
between prophylaxis and on-demand counted in both places. 
Pharmacokinetic 
•  PK was assessed in 17 patients (age 3 to 44 years). 
• 
FVIII activity is available from both one-stage clotting assay and chromogenic assay. PK data based on 
the chromogenic assay are presented in text. 
•  The 17 patients evaluated had an overall incremental recovery (mean (SD) of 0.023 (0.006) 
(IU/mL)/(IU/kg). Incremental recovery was 0.022 (0.003), 0.026 (0.005) and 0.026 (0.004) 
(IU/mL)/(IU/kg), respectively, in small children, older children and adults. 
•  The incremental recovery mean (SD) in the 3 adolescent patients was 0.014 (0.007) (IU/mL)/(IU/kg). 
•  Dose normalised AUC0-inf appears high in adolescents, but when adjusted for the variation in sampling 
frequency by plotting on a logarithmic scale, the results were more consistent between small children 
and adults(68.9 and 69.4 IU*h/mL) and appears high in older children (70.5 IU*h/mL) and highest in 
adolescents (72.0 IU*h/mL). 
•  The half-life (t½) was similar in children <12 years and adults: mean (SD) t½ in small children, older 
children, adolescents and adults of 8.5 (1.4), 8.3 (3.1), 11.6 (0.6) and 8.4 (1.9) hours, respectively 
with an overall t½ of 9.0 (2.4) hours. 
•  The mean (SD) CL was same in older children and adults, slightly higher in children than adults and 
much higher in adolescents: 3.7 (0.9) mL/h/kg (small children), 3.5 (1.2) mL/h/kg (older children) and 
3.5 (0.3) mL/h/kg in adults. Adolescents had a CL of 5.5 (2.2) mL/h/kg. 
•  Mean Cmax (SD) was 1.2 (0.2) IU/mL in small children, 1.4 (0.3) IU/mL in older children, 0.9 (0.5) 
IU/mL in adolescents, and 1.6 (0.2) IU/mL in adults. The overall mean Cmax (SD) was 1.3 (0.3) IU/mL.

 Efficacy results 
•  A total of 611 bleeds were reported in 47 patients during the main phase including 48 bleeds in 6 small 
children, 245 bleeds in 20 older children, 28 bleeds in 6 adolescents and 290 bleeds in 15 adults. Joint 
bleeds (including multiple location bleeds) (445 bleeds) accounted for most of these bleeds in older 
children (68.6% of bleeds), adolescents (96.4% of bleeds) and adults (81.0% of bleeds). 
•  A total of 925 bleeds were reported in 54 patients during the main plus extension phase including 65 
bleeds in 7 small children, 405 bleeds in 24 older children, 53 bleeds in 8 adolescents and 402 bleeds in 
15 adults. Joint bleeds (including multiple location bleeds) (650) accounted for most of these bleeds in 
older children (64.2% of bleeds), adolescents (92.5% of bleeds) and adults (80.1% of bleeds). Most 
bleeds in small children were subcutaneous (43.08%) or occurred in joints (29.23%). 
•  A total of 50.4% of the bleeds in the prophylactic regimen during the combined main plus extension 
phase occurred spontaneously. Adolescents reported a higher rate of spontaneous bleeds (71.4%) 
during prophylaxis versus the other age groups: 87.2% of bleeds were spontaneous in the main phase 
and 83.4% of bleeds were spontaneous in the combined main plus extension phases. 
•  Haemostatic response was successful (rated good or excellent) in 95.1% of the 611 treated bleeds in 
the main phase (primary endpoint). It was 95.9% and 95.4% in the extension phase and main plus 
extension phases, respectively. 
•  The haemostatic success was 91.8% in prophylaxis and 96.5% in on-demand regimen main plus 
extension phase. It exceeded 90% in the majority of cases regardless of subgroups (treatment, age 
group, bleed location or treatment period) when counting missing values as treatment failures. 
•  Similar proportions of the 148 traumatic and 771 spontaneous bleeds in the main plus extension phase 
had successful haemostatic responses (93.2% and 95.8%, respectively). 
•  872 of the total 925 (94.3%) bleeds in the trial were stopped with 1-2 injections of turoctocog alfa. 
•  The estimated ABR in patients on prophylaxis was 4.7 bleeds/patient/year in the main phase and 2.9 
bleeds/patient/year in the main plus extension phase, indicating a reduction in ABR over time. This 
development was most obvious in adult patients (10.7 bleeds/patient/year during main phase and 4.9 
bleeds/patient/year during the main plus extension). The estimated ABR in on-demand patients  (73.2 
bleeds/patient/year during main phase and 71.1 bleeds/patient/year for the entire trial). 
•  Approximately half of the patients (52.0%) with target joints at baseline had no bleeds in those joints 
during  prophylaxis treatment and 76.0% of patients on prophylaxis treatment had all baseline target 
joints resolved  during the trial, overall suggesting a benefit of prophylaxis treatment to improve joint 
conditions. 
• 
For the 48 patients who received only prophylaxis treatment in both the main and the extension phase, 
60 target joints were reported at baseline in 35 patients. All baseline target joints were permanently 
resolved in 65.7% of the patients per protocol definition and in 91.4% of the patients when using the 
definition per ISTH. 
•  At the start of trial, the majority (90.20%) of prophylaxis patients in main phase and (90.48%) in main 
plus  extension phase preferred dosing three times weekly, with no changes in frequency throughout the 
main  phase.

•  The average preventive dose was 40.5 IU/kg were similar to the mean preventive dose of turoctocog alfa 
in  the prophylaxis regimen during the main, extension and main plus extension phase (39.6, 40.8 and 
40.5 IU/kg BW). The mean total annual consumption when used for treatment were 6514, 6449 and 
6475 IU/kg BW/year/patient. The mean total annual consumption for prevention were 6221, 6304 and 
6228 IU/kg BW/year/patient. 
• 
For the treatment of bleeds, prophylaxis patients in the main phase consumed a mean (SD) 20.49 
(25.70)  IU/kg BW/month/patient of turoctocog alfa and prophylaxis patients in the main plus extension 
phase  consumed a mean (SD) 14.20 (20.55) IU/kg BW/month/patient of turoctocog alfa. 
•  A total of 7 patients underwent 10 surgeries; 3 patients had major surgeries and 5 patients had minor 
surgeries.  Of the 10 surgeries, turoctocog alfa was used in only 8 surgeries and hence only 8 surgeries 
were assessed for  efficacy. Haemostatic response to turoctocog alfa was successful (excellent and/or 
good) during and after all  the 8 surgeries and none of the patients received a blood transfusion. 
•  HAEM-QOL scores improved with time at the end of main phase and at the end of trial across all age 
groups.  Changes to scores from baseline to end of main phase were -6.8 and (children 8−12 years), -3.5 
(adolescents 13−16 years) and -3.4 (adults ≥17 years). Changes to scores from baseline to end of trial 
were -10.1 (children 8−12 years), -4.9 (adolescents 13−16 years) and -6.3 (adults ≥17 years). A 
negative change reflected an improvement in quality-of-life related to haemophilia. 
• 
For adults, QoL scores related to ‘physical health,’ ‘feeling’ and ‘view of yourself’ improved the most. 
Adolescents had the greatest HAEMO-QOL scores for ‘physical health,’ ‘view of yourself’ and ‘perceived 
support.’ Children saw the greatest decrease HAEMO-QOL scores in ‘physical health,’ ‘view of yourself’ 
and  ‘sports and school.’

•  AEs during main plus extension phase reported in ≥5% of patients included upper respiratory tract 
infections (27.9% of patients), nasopharyngitis (14.7% of patients), diarrhoea (7.4% of patients) and 
pyrexia (8.8% of patients) with event rates of 0.272, 0.111, 0.050 and 0.091 AEs/patient years, 
respectively. 
•  The majority (≥99%) of AEs were of mild to moderates severity in both treatment periods. 
• 
Five (5) AEs in 3 patients during surgeries (2 events of open wound of scalp; 1 event of peripheral 
neuralgia, loose tooth and tetanus anti toxin allergy each) were reported. All events were considered 
non-serious, judged to be unlikely related to turoctocog alfa by the investigator and resolved at the time 
of this report. 
•  There were 4 SAEs reported in 3 patients (4.4% of the trial population) in the prophylaxis regimen 
during the main phase (femur fracture in the first patient and lung infection and asthma in the second 
patient). All events were unlikely related to turoctocog alfa by the investigator and resolved at the time 
of this report. 
•  There were no AEs leading to withdrawal and no patients died in the trial.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects (Assessment) 
Overall, design and results of the presented study do not raise concerns regarding safety and efficacy in the 
paediatric population. No amendments of the SmPC are considered to be necessary. However, the Critical 
Overview Statement should focus on paediatric evaluation and present age-related results. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
According to the protocol, single dose for PK-evaluation was 50 ± 5 IU/kg. Of note, all documented doses 
have been above 50 IU/kg for all age-groups. The Clinical Guideline1 suggests 25-50 IU/kg. Results should 
be understood in this context. Sampling schedule for adults (0’’, 15’’, 30’’, 1’, 4’, 8’, 12’, 24’, 30’, 48’) and 
reduced for all children 0-11 (0’’, 30’’, 1’, 24’) has been adapted from the suggestion of the Clinical Guideline 
(0’’, 15’’, 30’’, 1’, 3’, 6’, 9’, 24’, 28’, 32’, optional 48’). Overall, patient-numbers are low in the paediatric 
subgroups. The following summary table has been provided within the CSR:

factor VIII products 26 July 2018 EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev. 2

EMA/689155/2019 
Page 14/20 
  
  
 
 
 
Similar Table should be available in the Overview (and EPAR). However, mean-values should be replaced by 
medians and range due to the low patient numbers, and doses should be amended - similar to the table, 
below (from Table 14.2.100 PK endpoints by age group, chromogenic assay – full analysis set): 
From the presented data the adolescent age-group does not show conclusive PK-results. It is taken that the 
number of adolescents (3) in the PK-sub-study (overall 17 patients) was not representative.  
Efficacy: 
Primary efficacy endpoint was the haemostatic effect. This effect is presented in an age-related manner in 
Table 11-5 of the CSR: 
It is acknowledged that the haemostatic effect is convincing for all paediatric age groups.

Annualized bleeding rate (ABR) is no standardized clinical endpoint: E.g. definition of a bleeding episode to be 
“counted” is not standardized but highly relevant, and the observational period should cover at least 1 year 
for such low numbers e.g. under prophylaxis and taking seasonal effects into account. If ABR is presented it 
should in general be correlated with respective compelling consumption data. 
Consumption of factor concentrate reflects efficacy from a therapeutic point of view. This should cover 
consumption in IU/kg per year (month) for on-demand patients and for prophylaxis patients (including 
complete concentrate supply) relying on similarly adequate observational period. In addition, according to the 
Clinical Guideline, consumption per event (bleeding episode) is requested in IU/kg per episode. If available, it 
might be of interest to compare consumption for bleeding episodes while under prophylaxis and while in an 
on-demand regimen. Consumption – according to the Clinical Guideline - is expected to be reflected in the 
Critical Expert Overview and the EPAR in an age-related-manner. 
Surgery 
Haemostatic Efficacy in (major) 8 surgeries has been described. Dosage and duration of treatment follows the 
Core-SmPC. Age-related consumption of factor concentrate per kg and event (major surgery) should be 
reflected in the Critical Expert Overview. 
Safety: 
Relevant in the frame of this article 46-procedure is a comparison of the safety profiles of the respective 
paediatric age-groups and adults. This includes an analysis not only of numbers but also of type and 
relevance of the AE regarding FVIII replacement therapy. According to the CSR, the following (summary-) 
evaluation regarding treatment emergent AEs is available e.g. for the main plus extension phase: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
 ‘infections and infestations’ (72 AEs reported in 33 patients; with upper respiratory tract infection cited 
more frequently) 
‘gastrointestinal disorders’ (16 AEs reported in 13 patients; with diarrhoea cited more frequently) 
‘respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders’ (13 events reported in 10 patients; with cough (4 AEs) 
more frequent than oropharyngeal pain (3 AEs) 
‘general disorders and administration site conditions’ (11 events reported in 8 patients; with pyrexia 
cited more frequently) 
‘skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder’ (10 events reported in 8 patients; with dermatitis allergic acne, 
urticaria papular and urticaria cited more frequently) 
Overall, there seems to be no additional signals regarding AE-reporting, overall. Tables are available in 
Section 14 of the CSR, presenting AEs age-group-related. However, respective analysis and assessment 
comparing age-groups and currently approved SmPC-wording is missing. AEs of special interest, e.g. 
hypersensitivity-related AEs, have not been presented.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The submitted study report includes all paediatric age-groups and adults within 70 treated patients. Overall, 
data do not change the positive benefit-risk-assessment for the medicinal product. Currently available 
information in the SmPC regarding paediatric patients remains unchanged. However, adequate age-related 
presentation of results for PK, efficacy, surgery and safety in the Critical expert overview is missing.  
  Not fulfilled: Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide an update of the Critical Expert 
Overview as basis for the EPAR (see section “Request for Supplementary Information / RfSI”).

4.  Request for supplementary information (RfSI) 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following issue as part of this procedure: 
Update of the Critical Overview Document is requested. The update should present study-results in an age-
related manner. Regarding Pharmacokinetics, age-related PK-data based upon median and range, and 
reflecting the applied dose, should be amended, including a well-arranged table. Regarding Efficacy – 
including surgery, the targets of the Clinical Guideline should be presented in an age-related manner, 
covering haemostatic efficacy and consumption of the factor concentrate as outlined in the assessment. 
Identified unexplained results from the adolescent age-group should be briefly reflected and commented. 
Similarly, safety should be amended by age-group-related analysis and assessment. AEs of special interest, 
e.g. hypersensitivity-related AEs, should be presented. Respective summarising statement regarding SmPC-
update should be provided.  
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

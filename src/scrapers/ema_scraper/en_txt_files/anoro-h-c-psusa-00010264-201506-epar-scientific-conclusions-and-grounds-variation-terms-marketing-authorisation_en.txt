Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for umeclidinium bromide / 
vilanterol, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing 
authorisations  
Forty five case reports were identified cumulatively with umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol based on 
a signal evaluation of glaucoma (as per Standardised Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) Query). In 9 cases a relationship with umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol could not be 
ruled out. Although based on the case description only one case of glaucoma has been specifically 
reported, it should be considered that intraocular pressure, reported in the other cases, is a sign of 
glaucoma that needs to be diagnosed in time in order to avoid serious complications of glaucoma. In 
addition, glaucoma is a known class effect of antimuscarinic drugs and it will be classified as an 
important identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR(s), the PRAC considered that 
changes to the product information of medicinal products containing umeclidinium bromide 
/vilanterol were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing umeclidinium bromide / 
vilanterol is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

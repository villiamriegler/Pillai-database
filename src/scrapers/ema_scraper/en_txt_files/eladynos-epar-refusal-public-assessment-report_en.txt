1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Radius International Ltd submitted on 17 November 2015 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Eladynos, through the centralised procedure 
under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was 
agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 22 January 2015.  
The applicant initially applied for the following indication:  
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (see Section 5.1). In postmenopausal women, a 
significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures has been demonstrated. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that abaloparatide was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0307/2014 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance abaloparatide contained in the above medicinal product 
to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
A definition from 1993 states osteoporosis is a “disease characterised by low bone mass and 
microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to enhanced bone fragility and a consequent 
increase in fracture risk”. A more recent definition from the NIH Consensus Development Panel on 
Osteoporosis defines osteoporosis as a skeletal disorder characterised by compromised bone strength 
predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture (Szulc & Bouxsein, 2010).  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools / prevention 
With advancing age, bone mineral density (BMD) decreases and prevalence of osteoporosis increases. 
In the United States (US), Europe, and Japan, osteoporosis affects about 75 million people. Using the 
WHO criteria, 30% of postmenopausal Caucasian women have osteoporosis at the hip, lumbar spine, 
or distal forearm. This is comparable with the risk of fracture for a 50 year old woman at one of these 
three sites. By the age of 80 years, 70% of women are osteoporotic at the hip, lumbar spine, or distal 
forearm. The prevalence of osteoporosis, assessed using the reference values from the young 
population, varies by region. In Sweden 6.3 % of men and 21.2 % of women aged 50 to 80 were 
classified as osteoporotic, whereas among individuals aged 80 to 84 years, 16.6 % of men and 47.2 % 
of women were osteoporotic. 
Osteoporosis causes about 9 million fractures annually worldwide and the risk of sustaining an 
osteoporotic fracture increases exponentially with age due to the decrease in BMD and the appearance 
of other age-related factors, e.g. increasing incidence of falls. Therefore, increasing life expectancy 
results in an increasing number of osteoporotic fractures (Szulc & Bouxsein, 2010).  
Osteoporosis represents a major non-communicable disease of today and is set to increase markedly in 
the future (Hernlund et al., 2013). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Osteoporosis is characterised by reduced bone mass and disruption of bone architecture, resulting in 
increased risk of fragility fractures which represent the main clinical consequence of the disease. 
Fragility fractures are associated with substantial pain and suffering, disability, and even death for 
affected patients. Most osteoporotic fractures occur at the spine, wrist, and hip (Hernlund et al., 2013). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Osteoporosis is defined clinically on the level of BMD; on the basis of the relationship of fracture risk to 
BMD two thresholds of BMD have been defined by the WHO (2007): 
 
‘Osteoporosis’ denotes a value for BMD that is equal to or less than 2.5 standard deviations (SDs) 
below the mean value for young adult women (T-score ≤–2.5 SD). 
 
‘Severe’ osteoporosis denotes osteoporosis as defined above in the presence of one or more 
documented fragility fractures. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 10/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinically, bone strength is estimated by non-invasive assessment of BMD by dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) since numerous epidemiologic studies confirm that low BMD is among the 
strongest risk factors for fracture. As endorsed by the WHO the clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis is 
based on BMD measurements and the presence of fractures. For these diagnostic criteria, BMD is 
transformed into a T-score, which reflects the number of standard deviations (SD) above or below the 
mean in healthy young adults. The thresholds for each category are shown in the Table 1 below (Szulc 
& Bouxsein, 2010). 
Table 1 WHO criteria for clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis 
2.1.5.  Management 
The primary aim of pharmacological treatment is the reduction of the risk of osteoporotic fractures. 
Currently, there are two therapeutic approaches to the treatment of osteoporosis; one is to decrease 
bone loss with an antiresorptive drug and the other is to increase new bone formation and BMD with a 
bone anabolic therapy. Antiresorptive agents are e.g. oestrogens and selective oestrogen receptor 
modulators, anti-RANK ligand antibodies, and bisphosphonates. They inhibit the bone-resorbing 
activity of osteoclasts while an anabolic therapy like teriparatide in contrast stimulates the production 
and activity of osteoblasts, increasing BMD by building new bone. 
2.1.6.  About the product 
Human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) is a naturally occurring 84 amino acid hormone and is primarily a 
regulator of calcium homeostasis. When given intermittently at low doses, hPTH has a well-
documented anabolic effect on bone. Abaloparatide is a chemically synthesised analogue of the first 34 
amino acids of human parathyroid hormone-related peptide [hPTHrP(1-34)]. Due to the molecular 
modifications of specific amino acids enhancing PTH1 receptor RG/R0 selectivity abaloparatide was 
claimed by the applicant to be more effective in patients with osteoporosis than hPTH(1-34) but with 
less bone resorptive effects and a reduced risk of hypercalcaemia. 
The finished product of abaloparatide is supplied as a 1.5 ml type 1 multi-dose cartridge that contains 
3.0 mg of abaloparatide as free base. The cartridge is irreversibly installed into a multi-use pen for 
daily subcutaneous (SC) injection by the patient at a dose of 80 µg of abaloparatide in 40 µl of fluid 
(2 mg/ml). The pen used in Phase II and Phase III studies was manufactured by Becton Dickinson, 
while the to-be-commercialised pen will be manufactured by Ypsomed AG. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that there are currently 
a  number  of  available  treatment  options  for  patients  with  osteoporosis,  such  as  bisphosphonates, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 11/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
denosumab and teriparatide and based on available data, it could not be concluded that abaloparatide 
would contribute additional benefits to patients that would support an accelerated assessment.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as solution for injection in pre-filled pen containing 80 
micrograms/dose of abaloparatide as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: phenol, water for injections, sodium acetate trihydrate and acetic acid (for pH 
adjustment).  
The product is available in cartridge (siliconised Type I glass) with a plunger (chlorobutyl rubber), 
crimp cap (bromobutyl rubber seal)/aluminium assembled into a disposable pen.  
Each pre-filled pen contains 1.5 ml of solution, a volume sufficient to allow administration of 30 doses 
of 80 micrograms of abaloparatide (per 40 microliters).

Figure 1 Structure of abaloparatide 
The active substance abaloparatide is a synthetic peptide consisting of 34 amino acids, of which 32 are 
L-amino acids, Gly and Aib are non-chiral. Abaloparatide is an analogue of the first 34 amino acids of 
human parathyroid hormone-related peptide [hPTHrP(1-34)], and 20 amino acids are exchanged 
compared to the natural counterpart. 
The peptide sequence is H-Ala-Val-Ser-Glu-His-Gln-Leu-Leu-His-Asp-Lys-Gly-Lys-Ser-Ile-Gln-Asp-Leu-
Arg-Arg-Arg-Glu-Leu-Leu-Glu-Lys-Leu-Leu-Aib-Lys-Leu-His-Thr-Ala-NH2 
The structure elucidation of the peptide was performed using 2D NMR spectroscopy. UV and IR 
spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FT-IR) experiments and amino acid analysis were also 
conducted.   
The primary structure of the active substance has been confirmed by electrospray ionisation mass 
spectrometry (ES-MS-CAD-MS) and N-terminal sequencing analysis.  
Enantiomeric purity has been studied by chiral GC-MS, which confirms that all the amino acids of the 
fully assembled peptide are indeed in the right configuration.  
Structural characterisation by Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (secondary structure) and 
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) (tertiary structure) were also carried out. The active substance 
is an amorphous white to off white hygroscopic powder. Its isoelectric point is 9.51. It is practically 
insoluble in acetone, acetonitrile, ethanol and tetrahydrofuran; soluble in methanol; and freely soluble 
in 0.1 N acetic acid and water. 
Abaloparatide exhibits stereoisomerism. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely in the active 
substance (AS) starting materials by chiral GC-MS HPLC. The specific optical rotation of abaloparatide 
is also controlled as a routine test of the active substance specification.

The applicant has performed comparative structural analysis to show that abaloparatide is to be 
regarded as a new active substance (NAS) in itself and that it is not a salt, complex, derivative or 
isomer (nor mixture of isomers) of a previously authorised substance.  
The parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a natural human peptide of 84 AA (MW about 9500Da), of which 
only the sequence of the 34 N-terminal Amino acids binds to PTH1 and PTH2 receptors. The full 
sequence of the human PTH is: SVSEIQLMHNLGKHLNSMERVEWLRKKLQDVHNFVALGAPLAPRDAGSQR 
PRKKEDNVLVESHEKSLGEADKADVNVLTKAKSQ. 
The PTH (1-34) is the peptide fragment that contains the 34 N-terminal residues of hPTH (1-84) 
(Sequence in bold given above).  
The PTH related protein (PTHrP) is a 139 to 173 AA protein (different isoforms in human) with N-
terminal sequence analogy to PTH. 
Teriparatide is a recombinant human PTH(1-34) marketed in Europe under the name of ForsteoTM.  
Although abaloparatide shares some sequence homology with PTH(1-34) and teriparatide, the 
applicant claimed that it is significantly different from them. This was substantiated by a comparison of 
abaloparatide and teriparatide amino acid sequence, which showed the differences at 20 positions (1, 
5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34). Table 2 is a presentation of 
the sequences, with differences in sequence highlighted in red. The amino acid (X) at the position 29 is 
Aib, 2-aminoisobutiric acid, alias 2-methylalanine, a non-natural amino acid. 
Table 2 Primary amino acid sequence of abaloparatide and teriparatide. 
It was also demonstrated that the amino acid sequence of abaloparatide differs significantly from PTH 
(1-34) or PTHrP (1-34) in different species. 
In addition, the secondary structure of abaloparatide was evaluated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance 
(NMR) and Circular Dichromism (CD) methods. The differences in the secondary structure of 
teriparatide and abaloparatide, including differences in the proportions and positions of α-helix and β-
sheet structures, led to the conclusion that the secondary structure of abaloparatide and teriparatide 
differ substantially. 
These studies were supplemented by receptor affinity tests (see non-clinical part of the report). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured using a standard solid phase peptide synthesis (SPSS) which 
comprises four main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications, which 
correspond to N-α Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl-protected amino acids (Fmoc-X-OH where X stands for 
the amino acid). A specification for the resin used as the solid support has also been provided. The 
manufacturing steps include: (1) a standard solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) of the protected 
peptide which comprises loading of the protected Fmoc-Ala-aminoacid to the resin and incorporation of 
Assessment report

successive protected Fmoc-aminoacids; (2) synthesis of crude peptide (deprotection and cleavage from 
the resin ); (3) purification and desalting through a preparative HPLC process; and (4) isolation 
(evaporation, filtration and lyophilisation). 
Coupling reactions are critical and are controlled by specific tests. Depending on the result a recoupling 
step also controlled may be performed. 
No reprocessing is anticipated during the course of the regular manufacturing process of abaloparatide. 
However if a batch fail specifications, reprocessing would be triggered after initial root cause evaluation 
and appropriate justification.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
These have been divided into three categories depending on their origin: i) impurities linked to the 
synthesis of the protected peptide on the resin, ii) impurities linked to the final cleavage and side-chain 
deprotection, and iii) impurities linked to the peptide storage in solution during downstream process.  
The enantiomeric purity of the active substance is acceptable and comparable to other synthetic 
peptides. Residual solvents, residual reagents and by-products, leachables from purification columns 
and elemental impurities have been sufficiently addressed.  
Due to the extensive resin washing and the purification steps practically any residual reagents or by-
products of peptide coupling reagents or reaction by-products are separated from the active substance. 
Only impurities with a very close structure to the active substance structure are collected during each 
purification step. Related compounds are controlled by the proposed active substance specification. 
Related impurities that have been observed in abaloparatide do not contain structural alerts for 
genotoxicity. In addition, as discussed above, purification steps used to manufacture abaloparatide can 
be expected to remove potential process impurities below levels of concern from ICH M7 taking into 
account the allowed daily dose of 80μg for abaloparatide. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. The history of the manufacturing process changes during development 
has been presented in sufficient detail and the changes have been justified.  
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  wide-mouth  bottles  ranging  from  30  to  1000  mL  made  of  high-
density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  and  closed  by  a  polypropylene  screw  cap.  This  primary  packaging 
provides good protection against moisture and oxygen. Its suitability for abaloparatide is demonstrated 
by the stability data (discussed below). The material which complies with the EU regulations 10/2011 
and 202/2014 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance and colour (visual), identification 
(monoisotopic mass by LC-MS and co-elution with reference sample by UPLC), purity (UPLC), related 
substances (UPLC), assay (UPLC), mass balance, residual solvents (HPLC, GC), water content (KF), 
specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), total aerobic microbial count (TAMC) (Ph. 
Eur.) and total combined yeasts and moulds (TYMC) (Ph. Eur.).

All critical quality attributes (CQAs) have been included in the active substance specification. A 
justification for each attribute and the respective acceptance criteria has been provided. The proposed 
specification limits are acceptable and have been justified by batch analysis data. Batch analysis data 
have been presented. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
The overall purity and level of impurities is assessed using different test methods. The limit for the 
specified impurity is based on batch and stability data. The limits for peptide-related impurities have 
been toxicologically justified. As per requirement of the Ph. Eur. monograph ‘Substances for 
Pharmaceutical Use’ impurities above 0.1% are reported and impurities above 0.5% will be identified.  
The process related impurities have been found during development and are identified as truncated 
peptides. A single specification has been established based on historical batch data. 
Justifications for not including bioassay, elemental impurities and benzene in the specification have 
been provided and were considered acceptable. The justification for the omission of bioassay was 
based on the nature of the abaloparatide molecule, its robust manufacturing process, the consistency 
of structural conformation and of biological activity in different active substance batches with different 
ages. Results from CD spectroscopy, DSC analysis and potency assay demonstrated that the structure 
and activity of abaloparatide active substance is reproducible between batches and over time for aged 
samples. This supports the conclusion that the routine use of a bioassay for release and stability 
testing is not necessary. 
Limits for elemental impurities were not included in the active substance specification since its 
manufacturing process does not involve use of catalysts nor processing aids that contain any of the 
elements listed in ICH Q3D Elemental Impurities. Two active substance batches were tested to assess 
levels of elemental impurities, and showed that the levels are well within the ICH limits. 
The potential sources of benzene contamination during manufacturing of the active substance were 
assessed and identified to be limited. Benzene that may have been present is removed during 
subsequent washing, purification and evaporation steps 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods have been 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
abaloparatide and impurity reference standards used for assay testing and validation of the analytical 
methods has been presented. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions at -20°C ± 
5°C and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at +5°C ± 3°C and +25°C ± 2°C/60% RH ± 
5% RH, according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. Samples were stored in HDPE bottles with 
screw-cap polypropylene closure of the same quality as those used for bulk storage.  
The following parameters were tested: powder appearance, water content, purity and related 
substances, API content, acetic acid content, mass balance, microbial contamination and bacterial 
endotoxins. In general, the analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
indicating. 
Supportive stability data from three development batches stored for up to 60 months under long term 
(-20°C ± 5°C) and accelerated conditions (+ 5°C ± 3°C) were also submitted.  
No change in appearance of the powder was observed for any batch at any storage condition.

With regards to purity and related substances, for all three primary batches, no significant change was 
detected after storage at -20°C ± 5°C.  At +5°C ± 3°C a slight decrease overall purity was observed 
and additional impurities were detected over time; but for both initially present impurities and 
impurities emerging over time, individual and total impurity levels remained below the specification 
limit. However, when stored at the accelerated storage condition of 25°C / 60% RH a significant 
decrease was observed for purity, from the start of the study through to 6 months, and levels of both 
initially present impurities and emerging impurities increased significantly over 6 months.  
The API (peptide) content showed no trend when stored at -20°C. However, at +5°C ± 3°C and at 
25°C / 60% RH the API content decreased over time. This decrease was greater at the higher stress 
condition of 25°C / 60% RH. The observed decrease of API content was consistent with the 
concomitant increase in the level of impurities, as well as an increase in water content, observed over 
the 6 months of storage.  
The water content results met the specification for all tested storage conditions for all 3 batches. At 
+5°C and +25°C /60% RH storage conditions the water content increased over time, with a significant 
increase observed at the higher temperature. These increases were attributed to the hygroscopicity of 
the active substance, influenced by the storage temperature used.  
The acetic acid content results were stable and met the specification at all tested storage conditions for 
all batches. The mass balance and microbial contamination and bacterial endotoxins results also met 
the specifications under all storage conditions.  
In addition, a photostability study following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one development 
batch. Samples were tested for appearance, purity and related substances, peptide content and water 
content. The purity results obtained showed a slight decrease on the sample exposed to light, but no 
significant degradation was observed. No significant change was observed for the impurity profiles, 
including main single impurity and total impurity levels, appearance, peptide content and water 
content. 
Results on stress conditions under acid (1M HCl), base (0.01 M, NaOH), oxidation (3% H2O2), heat 
(+80°C), and UV-light  were also provided on one development  batch, which demonstrated the 
stability indicating properties of the UPLC method used for purity testing. 
Overall, the stability results obtained for the three primary batches and three supporting stability 
batches stored at under the long-term stability condition of – 20°C, confirm that the drug substance, 
abaloparatide manufactured by the proposed manufacturer is stable when stored under the 
recommended storage conditions of – 20°C. 
The results generated at +5°C ± 3°C over 6 months (accelerated storage condition) and from the 
stress with UV light, demonstrate that the stability of abaloparatide is maintained in the event of short 
term excursions outside the recommended storage condition. 
In conclusion, the stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed 
supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months at -
20°C ± 5°C in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Eladynos is 80 micrograms/dose solution for injection in pre-filled pen for subcutaneous delivery of 
abaloparatide. The pen is a multi-dose, fixed dose, disposable pen injector for single patient use. Each 
injector is provided as a fully assembled unit, ready for use. Within the pen injector, the abaloparatide 
solution is contained in a siliconized glass non-replaceable cartridge with a rubber plunger closure at 
one end a crimp seal with a rubber septum at the other end. The cartridge is a siliconized glass 
cartridge of Type 1 USP/Ph. Eur. glass with a plunger made of a chlorobutyl rubber 4432/50. 
Additionally the crimp seal has a septum made of a bilayer of rubber consisting of 4780/40 bromobutyl 
rubber formulation (product contact side) and an isoprene rubber 7778/40 backing. 
The pen should only be used with specified needles. No needles are supplied with the medicinal 
product. 
The fill volume is approximately 1.5 ml per cartridge (target 1.56 ml) with no headspace. Based on 30 
days of dosing at 40 μl, the total volume administered to the patient is 1.20 ml.  
Abaloparatide is a 34 amino acid peptide. Abaloparatide is freely soluble in water. The stability of 
abaloparatide has been demonstrated at selected pH by both laboratory, clinical and registration 
stability at a storage temperature of 2-8°C. 
There are only four excipients in the formulation. The excipients concentrations used have been used 
in similar sterile subcutaneous formulations. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients 
and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients or excipients of 
human or animal origin used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients was included in 
section 6.1 of the proposed SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Critical quality attributes of the finished product have been defined as: the release parameters, the 
bioburden prior to sterile filtration (defined as critical in-process test), the correct assembly of the pen 
(leading to correct locking of interrelated parts). 
During the early stages of development of Eladynos, two types of finished product formulations were 
considered: (1) lyophilized (freeze dried); and (2) solution. For the initial Phase 1 clinical trial, a 
lyophilized formulation was developed and used, since it could be developed and tested more quickly 
than the solution formulation. All subsequent clinical studies that have been conducted used the 
solution formulation, which is the intended commercial formulation. 
During the course of development of the solution form, evaluations were made of different pH levels, 
excipients, preservatives, buffers and anti-microbial agents. For each of these formulations, several 
alternatives were evaluated and tested. Based on the results of the performed studies the formulation 
was chosen. In this regard, a study was conducted to demonstrate that the final formulation met the 
antimicrobial preservation requirements as defined by the US and European Pharmacopoeia for multi-
use parenterals. This study was performed during stability study of the solution and results showed to 
be compliant, demonstrating efficacy of antimicrobial preservative for up to 36 months at 5°C. 
Although the applicant did not perform any study to show that the amount of the preservative is the 
lowest feasible to uphold the antimicrobial effectiveness, confirmation that the amount of this excipient 
is within a safe range with regards to possible toxic effect has been provided and is considered 
acceptable.

Three different solution strengths were used during clinical trials. The formulation containing 2.0 
mg/ml abaloparatide is the one proposed for marketing. 
The excipients in the final finished product formulation maintain abaloparatide pH at acceptable levels. 
Antimicrobial preservative and other excipients in the formulation do not influence the performance of 
the active substance. 
There are no overages in the formulation. During manufacture of the finished product, a specified 
amount of the solution is filled into the glass cartridge to ensure that the total dose volume of 40 μl 
(equivalent to 80 μg of abaloparatide) is achieved over the full 30-day treatment period. The target fill 
volume is based on the capabilities of the manufacturing equipment. 
The manufacturing process development was explained in detail. The bulk solution mixing process is a 
simple process of mixing the excipients, adding the abaloparatide active substance, q.s to final 
concentration and then sterile filtering and filling into prepared multidose pen cartridge assembly. The 
cartridge is later assembled into a functioning pen system and labeled for patient use. 
The manufacturing process is standard for this kind of product, containing a peptide and comprises 
formulation buffer preparation, formulated drug product preparation, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, 
stoppering and pen assembly. The basic steps of this process remained unchanged during 
development. The differences were described and justified. A Becton Dickenson Pen II was used 
through Phase II and III clinical studies. The changes of the manufacture of the finished product 
solution are not considered to have a negative impact on the quality. Comparability of the product 
manufactured for clinical trials and manufactured using the commercial process has been 
demonstrated by batch analysis results. 
The choice of the sterilisation method has been justified by the applicant in accordance with the 
decision tree for selection of sterilisation methods (CPMP/QWP/054/98). The formulation is an aqueous 
solution of a synthetic peptide - abaloparatide. The applicant stated that it is not possible to carry out 
terminal sterilization by heating due to formulation instability, as evidenced by stability studies and 
forced degradation studies using heat. Autoclaving at 121° C or at F0>8 minutes will lead to 
degradation of abaloparatide in aqueous formulation. The formulation can be filtered through a 
microbial retentive filter. Therefore, a combination of aseptic filtration and aseptic processing is 
proposed.  Results for impurities and peptide content during stability studies at 25°C and 40°C are out 
of specification. Therefore, based on the data presented, the applicant’s justification to use aseptic 
processing and sterile filtration is accepted. 
Two different studies were performed to demonstrate the stability and compatibility of the finished 
product solution.  
Study 1 was conducted to show the compatibility of the solution with the contact materials during the 
manufacturing process and with all the in process materials used. No negative impact on product 
quality was observed with the maximum allowed hold/process times. No increased levels of impurities 
were detected during this study.  
Study 2 was conducted to show the compatibility of the concentrated abaloparatide solution in the 
delivery HDPE container. No negative impact in product quality was observed when product was 
manufactured with the worst case incubation time. The impurity profile at the start of incubation was 
identical to the impurity profile after that time . 
The product is filled in clear, USP and Ph. Eur. Siliconized Type I glass cartridges, fitted with an 
aluminium crimp cap on one end, and a grey, chlorobutyl rubber plunger on the other end. The rubber 
components meet the requirements of USP <381>, Physicochemical Tests for Elastomeric Closures,

Ph. Eur. monograph 3.2.9 Rubber Closure for Containers for Aqueous Parenteral Preparations, and JP 
Section 59 Test for Rubber Closure for Aqueous Infusions. Studies for leachable and extractable 
substances showed that potential extractable substances are not found as leachable substances in 
finished product.  
The cartridge complies with ISO 11608-3: 2012, "Needle-based injection systems for medical use – 
Requirements and test methods – Part 3: Finished Containers". The prefilled cartridges are 
permanently fitted into a multi-dose, disposable pen.  
During development abaloparatide was administered to patients by syringe, and by a pen 
manufactured by by another manufacturer. The major difference between the pens used for 
development and proposed for marketing is that the user placed the cartridges into the reusable 
development pen, while the to-be marketed pen is provided with the cartridge permanently fitted into 
the pen. Both pens have the same dose accuracy. The disposable pen-injector is an integral part of the 
finished product and together with the drug solution in the cartridge, are intended to be used 
exclusively in combination and form a single finished medicinal product. The pen is to be used with 
compatible pen needles, which are not supplied with it. The pen allows the delivery of at least 30 
doses, which sum up to a nominal deliverable volume of 1.2 ml. The overfill volume is available for 
priming the pen. The abaloparatide dose (80 µg) is indicated in the display window. The manufacturing 
process and quality control of the components and the subassembly of the components have been 
satisfactorily described. Product verification and validation comprised conformance to ISO 11608-
1:2014 general requirements and dose accuracy testing, needle compatibility testing, leakage testing, 
injection time, functional and force testing, shelf life testing, conformance to ISO 10993-1 
biocompatibility testing and usability engineering and testing. The provided information is in general 
considered sufficient. The pen corresponds to system designation C of ISO 11608-1:2014 "Needle-
based injection systems for medical use – Requirements and test methods".  
Seal integrity of the crimp cap after multiple punctures was also studied. Patient use was simulated 
with 10 cartridges by attaching a pen needle to a pen, priming the pen and then removing the needle. 
The cycle was repeated to 60 punctures. Crimp caps used in this study consisted of single layer and 
bilayer stoppers. Particles were observed in some of the cartridges with single layer stopper and no 
particles were observed in the cartridges with bilayer stoppers. Therefore bilayer stopper crimp caps 
were selected. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
Eladynos is designed and manufactured in order to maintain a sterile product throughout its shelf life 
(stored at 2-8°C) and during the 30 day usage period (stored at typical room temperatures of 
approximately 25°C) during which doses are removed once a day.  
A container closure integrity test of the cartridge has been performed which demonstrates that the pen 
container closure does not allow ingress of dye under stress conditions and that the product will remain 
sterile once packaged. 
Confirmation of the sterility is demonstrated by release testing and scheduled tests on stability (Ph. 
Eur. 2.6.1). 
Since the product is a multidose injection system, the formulation contains an antimicrobial 
preservative. An antimicrobial effectiveness test (AET) was performed as per USP<51> and Ph. Eur. 
5.1.3 which demonstrated that the preservative remains effective at the proposed concentrations. 
Additionally, stability data up to 36 months at 2-8°C supports its specification. AET studies in

combination with antimicrobial assay are being performed on the registration batches as part of the 
stability protocol to demonstrate the control of microbial contamination during long term stability.  
In-use testing has been performed on stability which demonstrates that after multiple entries using the 
disposable sterile needle and mimicking the patient use conditions, the product remains sterile. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is typical for this kind of drug product containing a peptide and consists of 
six main steps: compounding of excipient solution and drug product solution, sterile filtration, aseptic 
filling into cartridges, stoppering and pen assembly, and pen assembly. The process is considered to be 
a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The classification of all operating parameters and ranges has been justified concerning their potential 
effect on the product CQAs has been justified. Although the manufacturer of the finished product uses 
an in-house terminology for the criticality of process parameters, during the evaluation it was clarified 
that all parameters categorized as critical operational parameters and non-key parameters are critical 
These have been described in the dossier. 
The proposed in-process controls are considered adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
A batch size range has been defined for the bulk drug product solution. The exact batch size will be 
determined during the process by an assay so that a target protein content is reached.  
Process validation comprised filter validation, validation of aseptic processing by media fill and 
validation of compounding and filling manufacturing operations.  
Process validation batches were manufactured at the commercial site, covering both the minimum and 
maximum batch size. Validation of the finished product manufacturing process comprised all unit 
operations of the finished product process including hold times as defined in the dossier. The first and 
the second validation batch showed a large number of major defects during visual inspections. An 
investigation identified the root cause for the defects. Following its correction, the defect was no longer 
observed. The proposed holding times have been validated and are thus acceptable. 
The assembly step of the pens during finished product manufacturing has also been sufficiently 
validated. 
The manufacturing process and quality control of the components and the subassembly of the 
components are satisfactorily described. Product verification and validation comprised conformance to 
ISO 11608-1:2014 general requirements and dose accuracy testing, needle compatibility testing, 
leakage testing, injection time, functional and force testing, shelf life testing, conformance to ISO 
10993-1 biocompatibility testing, and usability engineering and testing. The provided information is 
considered sufficient. 
Altogether, the provided validation data for the manufacture of the filled cartridges are considered 
sufficient to demonstrate that the finished product manufacturing process is under control and provides 
a product of consistent quality. 
Product specification 
A justification has been provided for the attributes in the specification as necessary.

The proposed release specification for abaloparatide content (assay) and the proposed end of shelf-life 
specification have been adequately justified. This is based on experience from batches manufactured 
for clinical Phases II and III, registration and validation, and the resulting stability data. The predicted 
efficacy of the lower limit abaloparatide was estimated based on pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling data. 
The results suggested that there are no significant differences in abaloparatide Cmax or AUC parameters 
for both target and lower limit doses across these patient populations. The exposures associated with 
the lower dose are well within the 95% confidence interval for the efficacious 80 μg dose, which 
strongly suggests the lower dose would behave similarly to an 80 μg dose in terms of biological 
activity. 
With respect to purity testing, the degradation product has been the only impurity identified and 
qualified. This degradant was identified and separated in the drug product by a method developed and 
improved during development. Batch analysis data from aged clinical batches and registration batches 
(all stored at 5°C) provided information on degradation process. These together with the results of 
simulated in-use storage at 25°C for one month and toxicological evaluation including its 
immunogenicity (see non-clinical section), justify the shelf-life limit for this impurity.  
The release and shelf life specification limit for individual impurities is the identification threshold for 
peptides obtained by chemical synthesis in accordance with the Ph. Eur. monograph “Substances for 
pharmaceutical use”. 
Total related impurities at end of shelf life are limited, in accordance with the assay limits are defined.  
The proposed specification for pH is acceptable for subcutaneous injections as well as to maintain 
solubility and stability of abaloparatide. pH remained unchanged during stability. 
A functionality test is included to verify correct assembly of the pen and cartridge. The acceptance 
criterion is justified as it confirms the pen is capable of delivering the intended number of doses.  
All tests required by standard ISO-11608-1 have been shown to pass. Based on the extensive 
verification on the full assembled pen it is proposed not to conduct a dose accuracy test at time of 
release. 
A justification for omission of bioassay from the specification was presented. This was based on the 
demonstration that the structure and activity of abaloparatide drug product are reproducible consistent 
between batches and over time for aged samples. CD spectroscopy and DSC were used to determine 
the secondary and higher order structures for abaloparatide drug product, including batches of varying 
age. No change in structure was observed in aged finished product batches. Abaloparatide finished 
product was also characterized by potency assay. The relative potencies observed for finished product 
batches of varying age were all within specifications. 
These results demonstrate that activity of abaloparatide does not change, from batch to batch and for 
aged batches, and therefore confirm that the routine use of a bioassay for release and/or stability 
testing is not necessary.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines where applicable.   
Batch analysis results for three registration commercial scale stability batches, and three development 
batches produced according to process 1 have been provided. The results confirm consistency and 
uniformity of the finished product and indicate that the manufacturing process for the cartridges is 
under control. Data for the test on verification of function of the assembled pen has also been 
included.

Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial scale batches of finished product stored for 24 months under long 
term conditions of 5°C ± 3°C /ambient RH and at accelerated condition of 25°C ± 2°C/60% RH ± 
5%RH, according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Data for 6 months are available under stress 
conditions at 40ºC ± 2°C/75% ± 5%. Furthermore, four commercial scale validation batches of 
“naked” cartridges (not incorporated in the pen) containing abaloparatide solution were placed on 
stability at long term 5°C ± 3°C /ambient RH and accelerated 25°C /60% RH conditions. 
The batches are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
The following tests have been applied for stability testing: appearance, clarity, colour, pH, extractable 
volume, sub-visible particles (≥10 μm, ≥25 μm), preservative content, assay (peptide content), 
specified identified impurity, specified unidentified impurities, total related impurities. The following 
additional tests were conducted at 2-8°C and 25°C /60% RH, but not at 40ºC/75% RH: sterility, 
bacterial endotoxins, antimicrobial effectiveness testing, break loose force and glide forces. 
No significant changes of the quality attributes occurred at long term conditions except for the 
specified identified impurity degradant for which a clear trend of increase was observed.  The rate of 
its formation increased with increase in temperature. At 25°C/60%RH and 40°C/75/RH out of 
specification results were observed for impurities and assay at the six months’ time point. 
The increase in the specified identified impurity and total impurities was accompanied by a decrease in 
abaloparatide content. Based on this observation and on completed qualification of this analogue, the 
specification of abaloparatide, the specified identified impurity and total impurities was defined. 
The specified identified impurity was determined in older clinical batches (up to 54 months old) and 
registration batches (24 month) through contemporary testing using a revised HPLC method. All 
batches had been stored at 5°C. The levels of this impurity found were reported. Additionally, storage 
at room temperature (equivalent to in-use storage) has been demonstrated to contribute to its 
formation.  
Based on these observations, the estimated amount of this impurity after 35 months when stored at 
5°C followed by 1 month storage at 25°C/60%RH is expected to be well below the specification limit. 
The stability data, including the predictability of this impurity formation which accounts for essentially 
all abaloparatide degradation, the comparison of levels in registration stability batches and in aged 
clinical batches, the goodness of fit of predicted degradation to actual in clinical lots greater than 54 
months old, and the high predictability of the degradation of abaloparatide at 5ºC, 25ºC and 40ºC, the 
extrapolation of the shelf-life to 36 months is considered acceptable. 
With regards to the fully assembled pens, no changes in appearance and pen functionality was 
observed after 9 month storage under long term storage conditions. 
In addition, in order to mimic patient use, stability data have also been generated from an in-use 
stability study (storage at room temperature for duration of in-use period) and an in-use cycling 
stability study (removal and return to refrigeration, daily during in-use period) on the three stability 
batches used for the long term, accelerated and stress studies. 
Specifically, for the in-use stability study, samples were pulled from the 5°C ± 3°C/ambient RH 
storage condition at defined time points. Some samples were punctured 30 times to mimic patient use, 
and the remaining samples were left un-punctured. All samples were then placed in storage under the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 23/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
condition of 25°C ± 2°C/60% RH for 30 days. Data from up to 23 months of storage at 5°C ± 
3°C/ambient RH condition and 30 days at 25°C ± 2°C/60% RH ± 5% condition were presented.  
For the in-use cycling stability study, samples were stored at 5°C ± 3°C /ambient RH condition. During 
the in-use period, samples were cycled daily to ambient room temperature for 30 minutes, after this 
time samples were returned to storage at 5°C±3°C/ambient RH. This cycle was repeated for 30 days. 
During the 30-minute excursion, a defined set of samples was punctured once, daily to mimic patient 
use. Data up to 18 months storage is available. 
The tests performed on the punctured samples are: appearance/visible particles, sub-visible particles 
(≥10 μm, ≥25 μm), in-use sterility test, assay, specified identified impurity, specified unidentified 
impurities, total related impurities. The tests performed on the punctured samples are:  clarity, colour, 
pH, extractable volume, phenol content, antimicrobial effectiveness testing and break loose force and 
glide forces. 
Although an increasing trend in the specified identified impurity content and total impurities 
accompanied by a decrease in assay was observed in both in-use studies, all parameters remained 
within the specification limits. The in-use stability data currently support the proposed claim that the 
pen can be stored below 25°C during one month use. Therefore, the pen must be discarded 30 days 
after it is removed from refrigeration for initial use, regardless of the number of doses that have been 
delivered or remain in the pen. 
Results of a photo stability study in accordance with ICH Q1B Option 2 have been provided on one 
validation batch of “naked” cartridges containing abaloparatide solution demonstrating that the finished 
product is not photosensitive. There is thus no need for any storage restriction concerning light 
protection. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months when stored in a refrigerator 
(2°C - 8°C) and not freezed, followed by 1 month of continuous storage below 25°C as stated in the 
proposed SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance is the synthetic peptide abaloparatide, which is an analogue of the first 34 amino 
acids of human parathyroid hormone-related peptide [hPTHrP(1-34)]. It is manufactured by standard 
solid phase peptide synthesis. The finished product is solution for injection in pre-filled pen. Each pre-
filled pen contains 1.5 ml of solution, a volume sufficient to allow administration of 30 doses of 80 
micrograms of abaloparatide (per 40 microliters). The pen is a multi-dose, fixed-dose, disposable pen 
injector system which should be used by a single patient and the pen must be discarded 30 days after 
it is removed from refrigeration for initial use, regardless of the number of doses that have been 
delivered or remain in the pen. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
that were defined in the proposed SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the 
uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory 
way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Abaloparatide is a chemically synthesised peptide corresponding to the first 34 amino acids of human 
PTH related peptide (hPTHrP) with 8 amino acid modifications, among them the non-proteinogenic and 
atypical amino acid aminoisobutyric acid (Aib). PTHrP is different from PTH, as it is the product of a 
different gene with partial amino acid sequence homology and with different biological functions. PTH 
and PTHrP show structural homology within the 1–13 and 29–34 amino acid sequences of both 
polypeptides and both peptides interact with the common PTH1 receptor. 
A number of binding and cellular in vitro as well as in vivo studies have been conducted to characterise 
the pharmacological activity of abaloparatide. 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
In vitro studies 
In vitro binding studies using HEK cells stably expressing hPTH1 and hPTH2 receptors demonstrated 
that abaloparatide is a potent (EC50 0.2nM), and selective agonist of the human PTH1 receptor, with no 
affinity for human PTHR2 (≤ 100 nM). Abaloparatide had a comparable potency to hPTH(1-34) (EC50 
0.26 nM) and hPTHrP(1-34) (EC50 0.21 nM) at enhancing cellular metabolic activity, and was about 2-
fold more potent than the native peptides in stimulating downstream cAMP production (EC50 of 0.17 ± 
0.06 versus 0.40 ± 0.16 and 0.48 ± 0.13 nM, for PTH and PTHrP, respectively). In the in vitro 
experiments the human and the rat form of the PTH1 receptor was investigated. However, in vitro 
characterisation of abaloparatide in dog and monkey was not provided. The Applicant was asked to 
comment, what is known about the binding characteristics of abaloparatide to PTH1 receptors or their 
analogues in the animal species used in in vivo studies for investigation of pharmacology and toxicity. 
As a stretch of the PTH1 receptor involved in hormone binding shows identical amino acid sequence in 
humans, dogs and monkeys and as similar pharmacologic effects of abaloparatide were seen in 
humans and in dogs and monkeys, the lack of in vitro binding data for dog and monkey PTH1 receptors 
is considered acceptable. For the PTH1 receptor two high affinity conformations, termed RG and R0 
have been identified. The RG conformation is the G-protein dependent conformation leading to 
transient cAMP signalling. The R0 conformation is G-protein independent and leads to prolonged cAMP 
signalling responses in cells presumably because the ligand remains bound. Investigation of binding 
specificity of abaloparatide for the PTHR1 conformations RG and R0 demonstrated that abaloparatide 
binds with similar affinity (IC50=0.20 nM) as PTH (IC50=0.33 nM) and PTHrP (IC50=0.32 nM) to the RG

conformation of the PTHR1. Abaloparatide exhibited the greatest selectivity for the RG versus R0 
conformation, as the selectivity for the RG vs R0 conformation was 1,600-fold for abaloparatide, 12-
fold for PTH and 110-fold for PTHrP, respectively. In a cAMP time-response assay, abaloparatide 
showed a slightly more transient (i.e. ~2-fold shorter duration) of the cAMP signalling responses as 
compared to PTH and PTHrP. The ability of abaloparatide to activate downstream ERK-1/2 signalling 
was, however, found to be similar to hPTH(1-34) and hPTHrP(1-36) in the same cell system (GP-2.3 
cells). 
In vivo studies 
Comparison of abaloparatide and hPTH(1-34) (teriparatide) activity 
1. Calcium mobilisation in rat plasma 
In calcium-deficient, parathyreoidectomised (PTX) rats, abaloparatide produced at or above 
therapeutic doses (5 to 80μg/kg, SC) similar calcium mobilising activity as the native peptides hPTH(1-
34) and hPTHrP(1-34), with no significant difference in plasma calcium levels between the treatment 
group. However, when experimental data from two separate studies were pooled together, 
abaloparatide had less calcium mobilising activity at a high supra-therapeutic dose (320 μg/kg, SC) 
than hPTH(1-34).  
2. Efficacy in ovariectomised (OVX) rats 
The OVX-induced osteopenia model is considered to represent clinical features of oestrogen deficiency-
induced (or postmenopausal) bone loss in the adult human. A dose-related increase in bone mineral 
density (BMD) was observed in proximal femur and femur metaphysis regions, which contain a high 
percentage of trabecular bone, after 4-weeks of daily administration of hPTH(1-34) and abaloparatide 
(0.039 to 40 µg/kg, SC).  
Based on ED50 calculations, abaloparatide was stated to be ~2-fold more potent in restoring BMD than 
hPTH(1-34), with ED50 values: 1.75 μg/kg for hPTH(1-34) and 0.87 μg/kg for abaloparatide, 
respectively. However, the potency data should be interpreted cautiously, since no statistical analysis 
was performed to demonstrate a difference between the two treatments. Thus, both compounds 
demonstrated that they are similar efficacious anabolic agents capable of fully restoring BMD at 
comparable doses in OVX rats.   
The applicant was asked to discuss the differentiation profile of abaloparatide compared to teriparatide 
in terms of efficacy and risk of hypercalcaemia. Given that both compounds were anabolic agents 
capable of fully restoring BMD in OVX rats at comparable doses, that there was no significant 
difference in calcium plasma levels at therapeutic doses of abaloparatide compared to hPTH1-34 and 
hypercalcaemia was observed at clinically relevant exposure levels in repeat-dose toxicity studies, the 
non-clinical evidence supporting the hypothesis that RG selectivity of abaloparatide per se would offer 
differential effects of abaloparatide compared to teriparatide is considered weak. 
Anabolic effects of abaloparatide in rats and non-human primates 
The 6 week rat study included a longer bone-depletion period following OVX of 8 weeks compared to 5 
weeks in the 4-week rat study. Groups of sham operated vehicle treated and OVX vehicle treated 
animals were compared to OXV animals treated with 5 or 20 μg/kg bw/day of abaloparatide SC. The 
evaluation included DXA, microCT and biomechanical testing. DXA showed significant increases in 
femur, whole and cortical, and lumbar vertebral BMD. MicroCT revealed at the high abaloparatide dose 
at the femur metaphysis relative bone volume (BV/TV) and bone density values not significantly

different from sham controls and at the lumbar vertebrae even higher than sham controls with 
increases in trabecular number and thickness. 
All investigated biomechanical values increased in abaloparatide treated groups in the three tests 
employed (3-point bending of the femoral shaft, femoral neck cantilever compression test and lumbar 
compression test) compared to vehicle treated OVX animals, often statistically significantly, and often 
compared to sham vehicle treated animals as well.  
The 12 months rat study included an even longer bone-depletion period following OVX of 3 months and 
the doses of abaloparatide administered SC were 1, 5, or 25 μg/kg bw/day. In this study evaluation 
peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), histomorphometry and biochemical markers of 
bone turnover was included. Treatment with abaloparatide at 5 or 25 µg/kg bw/day increased bone 
formation markers (s-P1NP or s-OC) whereas bone resorption markers, s-CTX and u-DPD, remained 
unaffected. In vivo DXA showed that abaloparatide treatment resulted in marked increases in bone 
mineral concentration (BMC) and BMD relative to sham controls at all dose levels and at all sites 
evaluated: whole body, lumbar spine, femur and tibia, in trabecular and cortical bone compartments. 
Regarding whole body BMD abaloparatide dose-dependently restored OVX-induced bone loss to sham 
control levels at 1 µg/kg bw/day by Week 12/13, and earlier at 5 and 25 µg/kg bw/day. In vivo pQCT 
showed that treatment of OVX rats with abaloparatide at all dose levels reversed the OVX-induced 
decreases in total slice BMC and BMD at the proximal tibia metaphysis with positive bone gains at all 
time points and all dose levels compared to sham controls. The 3-point bending test of the femur 
revealed that treatment with abaloparatide at all dose levels reversed OVX-induced effects on bone 
strength. Histomorphometry of cortical bone showed that treatment with abaloparatide reversed the 
OVX-induced static cortical changes at all dose levels and histomorphometry of cancellous bone 
showed increases in all bone formation parameters at abaloparatide doses of ≥1 µg/kg bw/day. Within 
physiological ranges slight increases in serum calcium levels were noted in the high dose group. At the 
minimum effective dose (1 μg/kg, SC) a Cmax of 396 pg/mL and 884 pg/mL was observed at Day 1 and 
Day 358, respectively. For comparison, the human Cmax at the recommended daily dose of 80 μg/kg is 
812 pg/mL. 
For the 10-months monkey study a bone depletion period of 10 months after OVX was followed by SC 
abaloparatide treatment with 1 or 10 µg/kg bw/day for another 10 months. A third group received a 
treatment of 0.1 µg/kg bw/day for 7 months followed by weekly injection of 10 μg/kg bw/week. Total 
alkaline phosphatase activity did not change during abaloparatide treatment. In and ex vivo BMD 
measurements of lumbar spine using DXA showed that abaloparatide treatment at 1 and 10 μg/kg 
bw/day induced an increase of the lumbar BMD. Other BMD measurements (femur, radius, tibia) did 
not yield significant differences between OVX control, sham and abaloparatide treated animals. Only 
relatively few histomorphometric parameters responded to abaloparatide treatment. Biomechanical 
testing did not reveal significant differences between sham and abaloparatide-treated animals for any 
of the biomechanical parameters evaluated in this study. For the 16-month monkey study a bone 
depletion period of 9 months after OVX was followed by SC abaloparatide treatment with 0.2, 1 or 5 
µg/kg bw/day for another 16 months and monkeys were obviously older than those ones used in the 
10 months study.  
Treatment with abaloparatide at all doses increased the bone formation marker s-P1NP but without any 
significant increase in the biochemical markers of bone resorption. In vivo DXA showed that treatment 
with abaloparatide resulted in significant dose-dependent increases in BMD in most evaluated areas. 
Except distal radius, distal femur and proximal tibia, depending on abaloparatide dose and treatment 
duration restoration of bone mass to sham controls was seen. In vivo pQCT revealed full restoration of 
bone mass at the tibial total proximal metaphysis at ≥1 µg/kg bw/day near study end, but 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 27/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
abaloparatide induced only partial restoration at the proximal tibia diaphysis. MicroCT did not reveal 
significant differences regarding cortical regions but showed generally increases in bone mass at 
trabecular sites.  
Biomechanical testing at the femur (3-point bending test) showed trends for increases in several 
evaluated parameters. Statistically significant values for biomechanical parameters were reached in 
vertebral body and even more so in the lumbar vertebral core compression test with values generally 
similar to sham controls. Regression analysis of biomechanical parameters vs. BMC and/or BMD 
showed increases in bone mass were positively and significantly correlated with bone strength 
parameters. In the histopathological evaluation abaloparatide treated OVX monkeys demonstrated a 
lower incidence and severity of decreases in cancellous/cortical bone when compared to OVX controls, 
consistent with abaloparatide -related reversal of the OVX-related bone loss. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Across the 229 molecular targets tested, four were identified, where a 10 μM concentration of 
abaloparatide inhibited the radioligand binding to its receptor by >50%. These targets were the 
bombesin receptor, N-formyl peptide receptor-like receptor, orexin receptor and the vasoactive 
intestinal peptide receptor. Overall, abaloparatide was demonstrated to be selective for the PTHR1, 
with at least a 7,000-fold margin (based on the ratio Ki/human Cmax) to the other 229 molecular 
targets at the clinical dose (80 μg/kg/day). 
Safety pharmacology 
Safety pharmacology was extensively studied according to the ICH S7A and S7B guidelines in 16 
studies (3 in vitro studies and 13 in vivo studies in rats and dogs) to assess the effects of 
abaloparatide SC and intravenous (IV) administration on the cardiovascular, central nervous, 
respiratory, renal/urinary, gastrointestinal, and haematological systems. No safety pharmacology 
studies comparing the profile of abaloparatide and hPTH were provided by the Applicant. Abaloparatide 
was generally well-tolerated over a wide range of doses in 3 species, rats, dogs, and monkeys: single 
doses were studied in rats up to 625 μg/kg, and in dogs up to 10 μg/kg; repeat doses were studied in 
rats up to 25 μg/kg/day for 12 months, and in monkeys up to 10 μg/kg/day for 10 months and up to 
5 μg/kg/day for 16 months.  
Central nervous system 
The influence of abaloparatide on the central nervous system was investigated in female Wistar rats 
following subcutaneous and intravenous application. In the Irwin test subcutaneous administration of 
up to 625 µg/kg did not induce behavioural alterations. Intravenous administration resulted in a non-
dose dependent manner after 15 to 30 minutes in signs of excitation accompanied by stereotypies 
such as sniffing and body licking in every dose group. Abaloparatide did not show significant long 
lasting effects on spontaneous locomotive activity (up to 125 µg/kg; SC). However in the first minutes 
a decrease of activity was noticed and may be attributed to the cardiovascular effects of abaloparatide. 
Barbital-induced sleeping time test (up to 125 µg/kg; SC), shock induced tonic convulsion test (up to 
125 µg/kg; SC), and in the pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure test (up to 125 µg/kg) were unaffected 
by abaloparatide administration. The applicant concludes an NOEL of Abaloparatide in the CNS of 
125 µg/kg/day subcutaneously which was considered to be acceptable. 
Cardiovascular system 
Haemodynamic effects of abaloparatide have been investigated in in vitro and in in vivo studies in 
dogs. The in vitro studies consisted initially of one study investigating the arrhythmogenic risk in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 28/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Purkinje fibres of rabbits and one non-GLP compliant study investigating hERG currents in human 
embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. The Applicant was asked to justify the absence of GLP compliance and 
the studies were complemented by an additional GLP compliant hERG assay. Significant effects on 
APD60 and APD90 were noticed after 30 minutes for 0.3 µM abaloparatide, whereas for 10 µM the 
increase failed to reach significance. All other parameters investigated did not show relevant effects. 
One EAD was noticed in the highest dose group at a pacing rate of 12 puls/min. The applicant 
concludes that the most likely cause of these effects may be a weak blockade of the delayed rectifier 
potassium channels. Alternatively, these findings could be indicative of an activating effect on the 
calcium channels, which could then be concordant with the increase in contractile movements observed 
in the Purkinje fibres in the presence of abaloparatide at these two concentrations.  
In the initially submitted non-GLP study abaloparatide, slightly blocked the hERG current without 
showing an evidence for a dose response. No significant effects were observed at 0.1 and 0.3 µM and 
the Applicant concludes a no effect concentration of 0.3 µM. The second GLP-compliant study indicate 
an IC50 for abalopratide > 30 µM. The applicant argues furthermore that the maximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax) obtained in clinical study BA058-001B was 0.205 nM (812 pg/mL) and that the 
safety margin would be between 400 (based on results obtained with Purkinje fibres) and 1500-fold 
(based on results obtained with HEK cells). This appears to be a rather conservative approach since 
the plasma protein binding of approximately 70 to 75% was not considered. Taking this into account 
the safety factors appear to be rather 600 to 1600-fold. Based on the in vitro studies presented an 
arrythmogenic risk of abaloparatide appears to be unlikely. 
The haemodynamic and cardiovascular effects of abaloparatide following IV and SC treatments have 
been evaluated both in anaesthetised and in conscious dogs. The significance of these studies is 
hampered by the lack of abaloparatide exposure data and plasma calcium levels. In addition the 
Applicant provides a nonclinical summary of the cardiovascular effects of abaloparatide (Expert Cardiac 
Safety Report) which mainly summarizes the non-clinical data presented in the Assessment Report. 
Haemodynamic effects of abaloparatide were evaluated in anaesthetised dogs at IV bolus ascending 
doses of 0, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 µg/kg in 3 males and 3 females. Starting from 0.1 µg/kg, 
abaloparatide exerted dose-dependently a peripheral arteriolar vasodilatation (maximal decrease in 
mean arterial blood pressure [MABP] of 45%) and a direct marked positive chronotropic and inotropic 
effect, leading to increased cardiac output. Abaloparatide did not affect cardiac work and the 
haemodynamic efficiency of the heart, although some preliminary and marginal signs of myocardial 
depression were detected at the highest dose of 3 μg/kg. It did not cause deleterious effect on 
pulmonary and renal circulation.  
Abaloparatide, administered at doses of 0, 1, 3 and 10 µg/kg SC to the conscious dog had marginal 
effects on arterial blood pressure although a tendency towards a decrease was observed at 3 and 
10 µg/kg. Abaloparatide transiently and dose-dependently increased heart rate by 68%, 82% and 
120% at 1, 3 and 10 µg/kg, respectively. The effect occurred shortly following the administration and 
recovery to the initial values was achieved within about 3 hours. Associated with the heart rate 
increase, abaloparatide shortened the PR interval at 3 and 10 µg/kg and the QT interval by 18% to 
27% at all doses. Changes in the PR and the QT intervals were closely linked to the changes in heart 
rate. Abaloparatide had only marginal effect on the QTc interval although a non-significant tendency 
towards a decrease was observed at 3 µg/kg (decrease of 11% at maximum). No arrhythmia or other 
changes in the morphology of the electrocardiogram which could be attributed to abaloparatide were 
detected during the study. The applicant has tried to establish a safety margin based on allometric 
scaling predicting a margin ≤ 4.61 for the risk of QT changes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 29/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant concludes that due to the effects observed on the heart rate, the NOEL in this study was 
<1 µg/kg SC and argues further, that the SC dose of 3 µg/kg at which decreased MABP and a heart 
rate increased by 82% were observed in Study BA058-131 corresponds to a human equivalent dose 
(HED) of 1.67 µg/kg in humans, i.e. to 108 µg, 1.4-fold the therapeutic dose (considering an allometric 
scaling factor of 1.8 for dogs and a patient weight of 65 kg).  
The applicant has tried to replace missing pharmacokinetic data by pharmacokinetic modelling and 
simulation analysis. Overall the estimated plasma concentration profile has a high degree of 
uncertainty and should generally not be acceptable. The estimated margins of exposure obtained in 
dogs are rather low (≤4.6 fold compared to human exposure) indicated that even higher doses should 
have been evaluated in the cardiovascular safety studies. The systemic calcium levels were not 
measured in the two dog cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies, which in turn would have been 
valuable information since hypercalcaemia has been suggested to be a risk factor for QT shortening.  
Considering the repeated dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys (BA058, Study 7801-125), there was a 
non-significant trend towards a shortening of uncorrected QT intervals, similar to the observation in 
the dog cardiovascular study. Nevertheless, there was no apparent correlation with plasma calcium 
levels and the QT-interval findings in monkeys. Shortening of the QT interval or changes in QTc were 
not observed in humans. Furthermore, the cardiovascular effects observed in dogs may be consistent 
with a transient and reversible increase in heart rate observed in some patients. Applying the same 
factors as given above to the animal dose of <1 µg/kg SC this would result in a HED of below 
0.6 µg/kg. As the clinically intended dose is 1.2 µg/kg (80 µg dose for a 65 kg patient) the “safety” 
factor for this effect is smaller than 1. The observed cardiovascular effects may reflect a potential 
pharmacodynamic response (vasodilatation) of vascular smooth muscle cells (Halaplas et al., 2003) to 
abaloparatide exposure. Similar effects have been observed with comparable substances such as 
teriparatide. From the non-clinical point of view additional cardiovascular safety studies are not 
considered necessary.  
Respiratory system 
Effects of abaloparatide on the respiratory system were evaluated in freely moving female rats by 
plethysmography and doses of up to 125 µg/kg subcutaneously did not modify significantly any 
respiratory parameters up to 240 min after administration. 
Supplemental safety pharmacology studies 
Supplemental safety pharmacology studies were conducted in rats investigating renal, haematological 
and gastrointestinal system.  
Renal function 
In conscious female rats, abaloparatide (5, 25, and 125 μg/kg, SC) displayed no significant effect on 
urinary volume, pH, or potassium, creatinine, or phosphate excretion, but urinary sodium excretion 
was increased (at the intermediate dose of 25 μg/kg), and urinary calcium excretion was increased (at 
the 2 highest doses of 25 and 125 μg/kg). 
Haematologic system 
Abaloparatide increased non-significantly the bleeding time of female rats at 25 and 125 μg/kg, which 
is in agreement with the increased prothrombin time (PT) and APTT observed during the toxicology 
studies. No notable changes were, however, observed in the clinical studies for albumin, platelet 
counts, APTT, and PT. Haematological effects including decreases in haemoglobin and leukocytes were

observed at high doses in both rats and monkeys, which were stated to be secondary to the marked 
bone formation effects observed in the marrow. 
Gastrointestinal system 
The gastrointestinal tests (transit, ulcerogenic activity and changes in gastric fluid volume and gastric 
acid secretion) revealed no significant effects. Since the gastric acid secretion was increased at the 
highest dose tested the NOEL of abaloparatide for the gastrointestinal system was therefore 25 µg/kg 
subcutaneously. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies were conducted. Although abaloparatide has been 
shown to act specifically via the PTH1 receptor, as bisphosphonates are a common therapeutic drug in 
osteoporotic women, the Applicant was asked to comment on the possibility of pharmacodynamic drug 
interactions between abaloparatide and bisphosphonates. According to recent literature (Cosman et al. 
[2014] osteoporosis Int 25, 2359-2381) it is common to follow teriparatide treatment with an 
antiresorptive agent. Abaloparatide treatment followed by alendronate treatment is subject to clinical 
observation. Conduct of non-clinical pharmacodynamic interaction studies is not considered necessary. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
The bioanalytical methods described for rat and monkey seem appropriate. However, the Applicant has 
not provided validated methods for measuring abaloparatide levels in dog plasma and serum. 
Moreover, there are no results on the pharmacokinetic profile of abaloparatide in the dog despite the 
compound being evaluated in GLP-compliant safety pharmacology studies in dogs (study BA058-130, 
BA058-131). Since a clinical relevant risk for cardiovascular safety was already identified it is 
concluded that a proper method validation in dogs as required otherwise is not necessary. 
Absorption 
Absorption of abaloparatide was investigated in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Doses up to 300 µg/kg 
day in rats and 450 µg/kg day in cynomolgus monkeys were applied. Four single dose and eleven 
repeated dose studies were performed with abaloparatide only. Three additional studies in rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys concern the specific impurity. 
Bioavailability of Abaloparatide was determined in rats after subcutaneous administration of 10 µg/kg 
bodyweight and was 27 % in females and 39 % in males. The Applicant points out that a similar result 
was obtained for humans (bioiavailability 40% in clinical study BA058-05-10). 
Systemic exposure was investigated in rats and cynomolgus monkeys in ovariectomised and naive 
animals. After single dose (first dose) administration abaloparatide peak plasma exposure (Tmax) was 
reached quickly between 15 to 30 minutes, with no notable differences between healthy animals and 
ovariectomised rats or monkeys in all dose groups. Exposures (Cmax and AUC) were approximately 
dose proportional in rats and monkeys independent of gender or health status (ovariectomised or not). 
No significant differences were detected between ovariectomised and intact animals. 
After repeated dose administration a time and dose dependent increase of exposure (AUC) was 
observed in naive rats at doses above 15 µg/kg day after 4 weeks and after 26 weeks above 1 µg/kg

day. The picture in non-human primates was less consistent although a trend for increasing AUCs 
during study duration can be seen. At week 13 (~Day 91) a remarkable increase of the AUC compared 
to Day 1 was noticed in females which was not apparent later on. The reason is unknown. 
The applicant points out, that since the observed increase in exposure was observed with ascending 
dose only the relevant dose range in ovariectomised animals should be considered only. The intended 
therapeutic dose of 80 µg /day equals a daily dose of 1.2 µg/kg bodyweight for a 65 kg patient. By 
applying the conversion factors for a allometric scaling for rat and non-human primates of 6.2 and 3.1 
as given by the relevant guiding documents this would result in a human equivalent dose of 7.4 µg/kg 
day (rat) and a human equivalent dose 3.7 µg/kg day (monkey) and that these doses would be 
covered by the dosing range of approximately 1 to 5 µg/kg bodyweight in ovariectomised rats and of 
round about 5 µg/kg in non-human primates. Considering this aspect the ratio of increase is about 2 in 
rats and between 0.5 and 2.7 in monkeys. The Applicant concludes that in humans no drug 
accumulation has to be anticipated. Although this argumentation may be valid during the development 
of the medicinal product a comparison of the exposure obtained in clinical studies and animal data may 
be of additional interest.  
According to the tabulated overview provided by the applicant on page 25 of the non-clinical overview 
the Cmax obtained in clinical use is 0.7 ng/mL and the AUC0-t is 1.25 ng·h/ml which equals a dose of 1 
to 5 µg/kg day in ovariectomised rats. In ovariectomised monkeys the highest dose applied (5 µg/kg 
day) does not reach the AUC levels which have to be anticipated for clinical use. However, in naïve 
monkeys much higher doses have been applied which show, that a comparable AUC would be reached 
below a dose of 10 µg/kg day. In study BA058-119 pharmacokinetic parameters in cynomlogus 
monkeys were obtained after 88 days of 10 µg/kg/day showing a heterogeneous response with one 
group of animals showing an increase of exposure which is indicated by a basal exposure with 
abaloparatide before the daily administration and a second group of animals which do not show this 
effect. Considering this aspect, an accumulation of abaloparatide cannot be completely excluded based 
on non-clinical data. The Applicant tries to explain these results by the appearance of antibody 
formation (ADA), which may stabilise abaloparatide /abaloparatide fragments which were measured 
therefore in the analytical assays. However, since no clear information regarding the homology 
between the non-clinical species and humans is provided it remains unclear if similar effects have to be 
anticipated in humans. 
The applicant summarizes that the elimination was independent of dose with half-lives in the range of 
approximately 0.2 to 1.3 hours with doses from 10 to 300 µg/kg SC in rats and of approximately 0.6 to 
1.3 hours with doses from 10 to 450 µg/kg SC in monkeys and points out further that half-lives of the 
OVX animals were slightly lower near the HED (5 µg/kg for OVX rats and monkeys), being around 0.3 
hours for both species, and lower than in humans (1.3 hours) after single dose administration. The 
Applicant points out further that mean residence times are coherent with the half-lives with dose-
independent values between 0.3 and 1.0 hour in rats and 1.0 and 2.2 hours in monkeys. In relation 
with the short half-life, the clearance of abaloparatide given SC is high with values of 2.6 to 8.1 L/h/kg 
for rats and 1.1 to 13 L/kg/h for monkeys. The volumes of distribution (Vz/F) range from 1.9 to 6.9 
L/kg in rats and from 1.4 to 15 L/kg in monkeys. Despite high clearance and Vz/F values for females at 
the dose of 200 µg/kg in Study BA058-119, there is no evident increase of either clearance or Vz/F 
values with dose in monkeys. Unfortunately, the applicant does not take the repeated dose 
toxicokinetic data into account. In general, the groups showing basal (resident) abaloparatide levels 
exhibit an increased elimination half-life and a decreased plasma clearance. It remains unclear whether 
or not this can be attributed to ADA formation and if this results in an increased pharmacodynamic 
effect or toxicity.

Distribution 
Distribution was investigated in two tissue distribution studies in rats and one in-vitro protein plasma 
binding study. One tissue distribution study was performed using 125I-Tyr attached terminally to 
abaloparatide. Although not elucidated in depth it becomes clear that the molecule becomes de-
iodinated shortly after application and that the obtained data will most likely reflect the fate of the 
iodide in the organism. The other distribution studies were performed with 125I labelled abaloparatide 
with a more protected label using the positions 5, 9 and 30 of the peptide. An in vitro assay confirmed 
the pharmacodynamics activity of the labelled test substance. 
The highest radioactive concentrations in the blood were observed at 0.25 to 0.50 hours post 
administration. The plasma radioactivity declined steadily to 72 hours and fell below the limit of 
quantification (BLQ) by 120 hours. The apparent plasma elimination half-life was 6.61 hours (males) 
and 8.07 hours (females). The ratio of blood to plasma radioactivity was generally less than 1, 
suggesting little preferential association of radioactivity with the cellular compartment of blood. 
The tissue distribution of radioactivity following SC administration of 125I-abaloparatide was maximal at 
the injection site, kidneys and pancreas, 0.5 hours after administration. Liver, brown fat and blood 
radioactivity also peaked at this time with values slightly above 100 ngEq/g. After 2 hours, the highest 
radioactive concentration was in urine. Radioactive concentration peaked at this time in almost all the 
other organs, with values generally not exceeding 121 ngEq/g. The radioactivity declined and was 
generally cleared by 72 to 120 hours in these organs.  
The applicant points out, that the results are consistent with a rapid distribution of 125I-abaloparatide, 
followed by rapid clearance and a renal route of elimination. However, this study does not necessarily 
show a marked binding of abaloparatide to the target bone tissues since no specific binding can be 
seen. In comparison to the results obtained with RIA assays the elimination half-life is markedly 
prolonged from approximately 1 hour to 7 to 8 hours and the results obtained may indicate rather the 
fate of the liberated 125Iodide within the organism than the distribution of abaloparatide within the 
body. No drug-related radioactivity was detectable in the eye or skin at 120 hours. However, the 
applicant did not evaluate distribution of radioactivity in pigmented rats. Thus it is not possible to 
assess potential melanin binding. Since abaloparatide does not absorb the visible wavelengths (290 to 
700 nm), this deficiency is not considered crucial. 
The binding of abaloparatide to plasma proteins was evaluated in dogs, monkeys and humans. The 
free fraction of abaloparatide was similar in dogs (26% in males and 29% in females) and in humans 
(26% in males and 30% in females), and was slightly higher in monkeys (43% in males and 53% in 
females). The free fraction in rats could not be determined. These data suggest that abaloparatide 
does not appear to be highly bound to plasma proteins and that at doses equivalent to the therapeutic 
dose, abaloparatide may be slightly more pharmacologically active in monkeys than in humans and 
dogs. 
Metabolism was investigated in four in vitro studies. One study evaluated in vitro the degradation of 
125I-Tyr0-abaloparatide by rat kidney and liver homogenates, as well as by the purified enzymes 
chymotrypsin and cathepsin B. Abaloparatide was quickly transformed in all preparations, the rate of 
transformation being kidney homogenate > chymotrypsin > liver homogenate > cathepsin B, with 
97%, 94%, 73% and 56% of transformed abaloparatide after 30 minutes. Liver and kidney 
homogenates led to the same metabolites, which were not found following incubation with 
chymotrypsin and cathepsin B. Additionally, kidney homogenates led to an additional metabolite, 
however the specific peptide sequence of these metabolites was not elucidated during this study. A 
Assessment report

metabolite profile of urine and faeces collected during the in vivo study did not allow the determination 
of the metabolites other than one, hypothesised to be free iodine eliminated via the urine. 
In a second in vitro study the degradation of abaloparatide in the presence of human liver and kidney 
homogenates was investigated. Six peptide fragments were identified after 1 hour incubation, 
consistent with a non-specific degradation of abaloparatide into multiple peptide fragments. The 
potential activity of the metabolites was investigated in the rat osteosarcoma cell line UMR-106 
expressing the PTH1 receptor. Ten potential abaloparatide fragments were tested, only one had 
agonistic activity (fragment 1-31) and one (fragment 20-31) had a weak antagonistic activity in 
presence of abaloparatide. The results of the studies indicate that the metabolic pathway of 
abaloparatide is consistent with non-specific proteolytic cleavage, both in rat and in human liver and 
kidney preparations. This resulted in the formation of inactive peptide fragments. The potential 
elimination of abaloparatide via proteolytic degradation and elimination via the kidneys appeared 
greater than that of the liver. In conclusion, abaloparatide was rapidly metabolised in vitro and in vivo 
into smaller peptide fragments, however no clearly defined pathway was identified.  
Excretion 
Excretion was investigated in two studies. One study was considered to be of minor interest because of 
the suspected liberation of the radioactive iodide as discussed above. In the second study 91% and 
102% of the radioactivity was excreted within the first 48 hours in males and females respectively. 
Faecal excretion was minimal, and 168 hours after administration, 82% ± 13% and 94% ± 9% of the 
radioactivity were excreted in urine and 4.8% ± 1.3% and 4.5% ± 1.7% were excreted in the faeces 
of male and female rats, respectively. The results obtained are in accordance with a renal elimination 
as main route of excretion. However, as already suggested the results may reflect rather the 
elimination of iodide out of organism than the elimination of abaloparatide. Most likely there will be a 
break-down of abaloparatide by the plethora of proteases. This will result in smaller peptides or single 
amino acids will take part in the anabolic and katabolic processes within the body. Under this aspect 
urea would be the final excretion product. This view is supported by the simple fact that no unchanged 
abaloparatide was found in the urine. The excretion into milk was not studied, because of the lack of 
relevance for the intended patient population (postmenopausal woman). Considering the results 
obtained within the biodistribution studies specific studies would most likely reflect the transmission of 
the labelled iodide and not the excretion of abaloparatide into the milk. Further studies are therefore 
not required. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Three drug interaction studies have been provided. Abaloparatide did not inhibit the drug transporters 
phospho-glycoprotein (P-gp) in HEK293 cells and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in Caco-2 
cells, indicating that abaloparatide is not expected to affect the distribution or elimination of drug 
substrates of these transporters. 
Abaloparatide had neither time-dependent direct nor metabolic-dependent inhibitory activity on the 
CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 isoenzymes, in 
the presence of human hepatic microsomes. In summary, abaloparatide had neither inhibitory nor 
inducing effect on any of the CYP enzymes tested. For further discussion, see Clinical 
Pharmacokinetics.

2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicity profile of abaloparatide was characterised in GLP-compliant single-dose studies in mice 
and rats, and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, up to 6 and 9 months 
duration, respectively. No in vitro potency data for these species was submitted (see Pharmacology); 
however, abaloparatide was shown to be pharmacologically active in both rats and monkeys; thus the 
choice of species is endorsed. Abaloparatide was administered by SC injection in all in vivo toxicity 
studies. This is the same administration route as the intended clinical route. The doses chosen for the 
studies are considered appropriate to characterize the toxicity of abaloparatide. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose studies were performed in mice and rats, using IV and SC administration of abaloparatide 
at a dose of 42 mg/kg bw. Transient hypoactivity and neurological signs were observed after IV, but 
not SC, injection. The approximate lethal dose for both species was > 42 mg/kg bw. The margins to 
human therapeutic dose are in the range of 3000-6000x. In conclusion, the acute toxicity of 
abaloparatide is considered low.  
Repeat-dose toxicity 
The majority of treatment-related findings in repeat-dose toxicity studies with abaloparatide in rats 
and monkeys were due to exaggerated pharmacology (agonism of PTHR1). The toxicity findings can be 
divided into primary effects on bone and secondary effects. Main target organs of toxicity were the 
bone, bone marrow, kidney and heart. 
In the 4 weeks study in rats with abaloparatide doses of 0, 15, 70 and 300 µg/kg bw/day no 
mortalities occurred and clinical signs were limited to transient tachypnea and vasodilation caused 
reddening of parts of the body. Reddish colour of the extremities and skin was observed in all three 
repeat-dose toxicity studies, at doses of > 10 μg/kg. The effect was transient, sometimes associated 
with tachypnea, and considered possibly due to a peripheral vasodilatory effect of abaloparatide. No 
similar findings were present in monkeys. Effects on investigated parameters mainly reflected 
exaggerated pharmacological effects including bone formation caused decrease in bone marrow 
spaces, signs of anaemia/thrombocytopenia and extramedullary haematopoiesis and increases in 
serum and urine Ca2+. Obviously related to stress, there was a non-dose dependent slight decrease in 
thymus weight, correlated with involution in one female, at ≥15 μg/kg. As in the rat studies of longer 
durations as well coagulation time was shortened and, as in the monkey studies seen as well, the 
albumin/globulin ratio was decreased. A decreased albumin/globulin ratio was observed in all rat 
studies, at doses of > 10μg/kg, and in cynomolgus monkeys at > 100 μg/kg. The applicant did not 
discuss the mechanism behind this finding. It is possible that it may be linked to calcium homeostasis, 
since both albumin and globulin can bind to calcium. The low dose of 15 µg/kg bw/day may with 
limitations be considered the NOAEL of this study, as already at this low dose slight secondary effects 
were observed. 
Similarly in the 13 week rat study (abaloparatide doses 10, 25, 70 µg/kg bw/day) no deaths occurred 
and transient vasodilation was seen. Apart from effects attributable to exaggerated pharmacological 
action on bone metabolism and subsequent consequences, among them effects on blood count, 
extramedullary haematopoiesis, increased spleen weight and Ca2+ homeostasis, coagulation time was 
shortened, albumin/globulin ratio was decreased and kidney weights were increased. In high dose 
males serum Ca2+ was increased transiently 3 hours after abaloparatide administration. Due to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 35/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
kidney effect with limitations a NOAEL of the low dose of 10 µg/kg bw/day may be considered, 
although already at this low dose slight secondary effects were observed. 
In the 26 weeks study in rats with identical abaloparatide doses as in the 13 weeks rat study one high 
dose female died to reasons obviously unrelated to abaloparatide (lymphosarcoma). Effects seen in 
this study are in line with those seen in the rat toxicology studies of shorter duration mirroring mainly 
exaggerated pharmacological effects of abaloparatide. Transient vasodilation was observed as in the 
other rat studies of shorter duration but also shortened coagulation time and decreased 
albumin/globulin ratio. Minimal to slight vacuolation of the zona glomerulosa was observed at ≥10 
μg/kg, being associated with increased weight of the adrenal gland at 70 μg/kg. This finding was not 
associated with any necrosis or inflammation in the adrenal gland, and is thus not considered to be 
adverse. Due to mineralisation of the renal pelvis with limitations a NOAEL of the low dose of 10 µg/kg 
bw/day may be considered, although already at this low dose slight secondary effects were observed.  
A 3 days dose range finding study in cynomolgus monkeys compared abaloparatide with hPTH(1-34) 
[consistent with teriparatide]. Serum Ca2+ increased after administration of 0.75 µg/kg bw/day of 
hPTH(1-34) similarly as after 7.5 µg/kg bw/day of abaloparatide (in males slightly above maximum 
pretest values).  
In another dose range finding study in monkeys of 2 weeks duration with abaloparatide doses of 0, 
3.5, 10, 50, 150, 450 and 1000 µg/kg bw/day (one animal of each sex/dosing group) the high dose 
female was sacrificed Day 11 in moribund state due to marked renal tubular necrosis. This female 
showed obviously stress-related moderate adrenal cortical hypertrophy. Apart from exaggerated 
pharmacological effects of abaloparatide on bone and subsequent consequences starting from 450 
µg/kg bw/day clinical signs (decrease in food consumption and bw) and in females renal effects were 
noted.  
In the 4 weeks study with daily doses of 0, 100, 200 and 450 µg/kg bw no deaths occurred but 1of 3 
high dose males presented in a poor condition. The effects noted in this study appear to be caused 
mainly by the pharmacodynamic effects of abaloparatide. One of 3 high dose males showed an 
increased kidney weight corresponding histopathologically to peritubular fibrosis and mineralisation. As 
the pharmacodynamic effects at the low dose are of low magnitude and as a decrease in 
albumin/globulin ratio seen in this study at the low dose is low and not of statistical significance 
(although dose-dependent), 100 µg/kg bw/day may with limitations be considered NOAEL of this 
study.  
In the 13 weeks study in cynomolgus monkeys with daily doses of 0, 10, 50 and 200 µg/kg bw and a 
recovery period of 2 weeks two high dose animals died after 8 and 9 weeks due to renal tubule-
interstitial nephropathy with mineralisation and myocardial degeneration with necrosis and 
mineralisation.  
Apart from exaggerated pharmacological effects of abaloparatide another female presented tubulo-
interstitial nephropathy and kidney weights were increased in high dose animals. Low and medium 
dose animals showed after abaloparatide administration transient serum Ca2+ increases mostly within 
physiological ranges. After the recovery period (2 animals / sex / group) obviously neither findings of 
any toxicological significance nor the presence of subendosteal fibroblast proliferation, osteoblasts, 
osteoclasts or woven bone is any longer reported. The medium dose of 50 µg/kg bw/day is accepted as 
the NOAEL.  
In the 39 weeks study in cynomolgus monkeys with abaloparatide doses of 0, 10, 25 and 70 µg/kg 
bw/day (lowered to 50 µg/kg bw/day at week 21) and a recovery phase of 2 weeks 4 animals died due 
to hypercalcaemia-caused morbidity (mineralisation of kidney tubules, myocardium, lung, stomach

epithelium, salivary glands): one low dose male at week 20, one high dose male and two high dose 
females at weeks 7, 7 and 15, respectively. Several preterminally euthanised animals showed 
obviously stress-related lymphoid depletion in the thymus and/or spleen. Kidney weights were 
increased starting at the medium dose (statistically significant in high dose males).  
Mineralisation was seen to different degrees in several organs of all dosed animals. Increases in serum 
Ca2+ are only reported for 1 of 4 females of the medium dose group and in 2 of 5 females of the high 
dose group. Therefore, apparently an increase in serum Ca2+ does not necessarily precede 
mineralisation of organs. The Applicant was asked to discuss how abaloparatide can be safely used in 
patients without exposing patients to the risks of organ mineralisation. Occurrence of tissue 
mineralisation in nonclinical animal studies is considered a class effect for PTH1 receptor agonists and 
was observed in nonclinical studies with teriparatide as well. Regarding teriparatide this effect in 
nonclinical studies translated apparently not into tissue mineralisation in patients during clinical use. A 
renal CT Scan Sub-study did not yield evidence of increased mineralisation in the subset of patients 
who underwent renal CT scans in clinical study BA058-05-003 with dosing of abaloparatide (80 µg 
SC/day), teriparatide (20 µg SC/day) or placebo over 18 months. The risk of organ mineralisation 
(calcification) is in response to an initial clinical question included in the Summary of safety concerns in 
the Risk Management Plan. In response to a request, the applicant amended SmPC section 5.3 
Preclinical safety data appropriately in order to add information regarding organ mineralisations in non-
clinical studies and AUC based exposure ratios to the intended clinical exposure.  
Regarding bone (femur, vertebra, other bone) no microscopic findings are reported (therefore, bone 
metabolism is obviously not increased). Emesis and non-formed or liquid faeces were observed in all 
pivotal studies in monkeys at doses of > 10 μg/kg. The emesis was probably the cause of decreased 
food consumption and associated lower body weight in males at > 10 μg/kg in the 39-week study. 
Emesis appears to be clinically relevant, since ‘nausea’ is listed in the adverse reactions table in section 
4.8 of the SmPC, with frequency common. It is considered that the study did not identify a NOAEL.  
Toxicokinetics 
In several of the repeat-dose studies in rats and monkeys, plasma exposure to abaloparatide increased 
more than expected from Day 1 to the end of the study, indicating accumulation. This was particularly 
evident in the 13-week monkey study, where it was suggested that the development of anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA) was associated with an increased exposure, resulting from a prolonged extravascular 
clearance of the drug. On the other hand, the assay used for antibody determination was considered 
unreliable by the Applicant, due to high unspecific binding. Thus the reason for the increased exposure 
in the 13-week study, as compared with the 39-week study, remains unclear. 
Exposure margins 
Safety margins between NOAELs in repeated dose toxicity studies and intended human clinical 
exposure are extremely small or nearly non-existent: for the rat Cmax based (13 weeks study, Day 86) 
1.052, AUC based (same study, Day 1) 1.153 (which is similar to 1.177 [26 week study, Day 1] or 1.8 
[same study, Day 182]), or less than 1.682 (rat 2 years carcinogenicity study, Day1). In the latter 
study already at the lowest dose of 10 µg/kg bw/day tissue mineralisation was found in the major 
arteries and kidneys. In the 39 weeks repeated dose toxicity study in monkeys of the longest duration 
(and therefore of main importance) no NOAEL could be determined due to obviously hypercalcaemia 
caused death of one male animal in the low dose group. Safety margins resulting from this study are 
below 3.5 based on AUC.

Genotoxicity 
Abaloparatide was tested in the standard battery of genotoxicity assays according to ICH S2 (R1) 
consisting of a bacterial gene mutation assay, and an in vitro and in vivo assay for chromosome 
damage. There was no evidence for a mutagenic potential of abaloparatide.  
Carcinogenicity 
Abaloparatide was investigated for its carcinogenic potential in rats in a 2-year bioassay with a 
comparator arm treated with hPTH(1-34). This is accordance with the ICH S6 (R1) and rat is 
considered a pharmacologically relevant species. 
Abaloparatide was administered via once daily SC injection at 0, 10, 25 and 50 μg/kg to Fischer 344 
rats. The comparator group was treated with 30 μg/kg hPTH(1-34). Based on broadly similar margins 
to human therapeutic exposure with the mid dose abaloparatide group (14-20x for abaloparatide, 14-
25x for hPTH) this comparison is considered relevant. 
Mortality rate in drug-treated rats was increased compared to controls, due to increased incidences of 
osteosarcoma and osteoblastoma at > 10 μg/kg abaloparatide, and at 30 μg/kg PTH(1-34). In females 
the incidence of bone tumours in mid dose females was similar to that in females treated with hPTH(1-
34) whereas the incidence was slightly higher in male rats compared to hPTH(1-34). 
Osteosarcomas originated from different bones with tibia being the most frequently affected. Males 
were more affected than females, showing higher incidences of osteosarcoma and associated clinical 
signs (limited usage or paralysis of hind legs). The incidence of palpable masses (mainly bone 
tumours) was increased in rats treated with abaloparatide compared to hPTH(1-34), however the time 
of onset did not differ significantly between the groups. Osteosarcoma metastases to soft tissues were 
frequent and comparable between abaloparatide and PTH (1-34). There were no other treatment-
related neoplastic findings in the study.  
Exposure at the lowest abaloparatide dose where osteosarcoma occurred (10 μg/kg/day), was 3.6x the 
human therapeutic exposure. However there was no neoplastic NOAEL. 
Non-neoplastic bone changes observed in the abaloparatide and hPTH(1-34) groups, included 
osteoblast hyperplasia, hyperostosis and osteofibrous dysplasia. Treatment related soft tissue 
mineralisation in the heart (vessels) and kidney (pelvis) was observed in abaloparatide and PTH(1-34)-
treated rats. Increased incidence of extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen, and increased 
incidence of alveolar histiocytosis, was observed in all abaloparatide-treated groups and in the PTH(1-
34)-treated group considered secondary effects to the obliteration of the bone marrow space and 
osteosarcoma lung metastases respectively. Dilatation, haemorrhage and/or inflammation of the 
urinary bladder were observed at a slightly increased incidence in abaloparatide-treated males at > 25 
μg/kg/day. These findings were probably secondary to the presence of osteosarcoma localised in the 
spine or pelvis, which may have interfered with the neural control of micturition. Overall, there was no 
significant difference in incidence or severity of non-neoplastic findings between the abaloparatide 
25 μg/kg group and the hPTH(1-34) group. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Since the intended patient population is postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the reproductive 
and developmental toxicology program was limited to a male fertility and early embryonic development 
study in rats with dosing of males only. A female fertility study, embryo-fetal development studies in 
rats and/or rabbits and a prenatal and postnatal development toxicity study were not performed. This 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 38/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is acceptable. Treatment with abaloparatide at doses of 10, 25 and 70 μg/kg/day for 2 weeks before 
mating, throughout the mating period and 2 weeks after, did not cause any effects on mating 
performance, sperm parameters, pregnancy index, uterine and litter parameters. 
Local tolerance 
The applicant conducted 2 local tolerance studies with venous, perivenous and subcutaneous 
administration in rabbits, which did not indicate a local irritating potential for abaloparatide. The 
abaloparatide concentration of the clinical formulation is by a factor of approx. 40 or 20 times higher, 
respectively, than those ones used in the preclinical local tolerance studies. Furthermore, the 
composition of the formulations is different. Therefore, the findings of these nonclinical local tolerance 
studies may underestimate the potential local tolerability in humans. As the meanwhile gathered 
clinical experience with the clinically intended formulation with repeat administration in Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 studies supports the tolerance in patients up to 18 months of treatment, conduct of non-
clinical local tolerance studies with the clinically intended formulation is considered neither necessary 
nor appropriate. 
Antigenicity 
Occurrence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was investigated in multiple repeated dose studies, among 
them the 12 months and 16 months pharmacology studies in rats (Study 10RAD029) and monkeys 
(Study 10RAD030), the carcinogenicity study (Study 10RAD032), and the 39 weeks repeated dose 
toxicity study in monkeys (Study 7801-125) using validated normalised assay cut-point (NACP) and 
RIA methods. There was a large variation in antibody response between the studies, ranging from < 
2% to 39%, without any apparent correlation to dose or duration of exposure.  
In long-term rat and monkey studies, where ADA detection was performed with more validated assays, 
the number of ADA-positive animals was low, both in rats and monkeys, and there was an apparently 
higher abaloparatide exposure in ADA-positive rats, but this was not the case in the single ADA 
positive monkey. The bioanalytical method used by the Applicant for determination of serum 
abaloparatide levels did not distinguish between free vs. antibody bound abaloparatide. Therefore, no 
information is available regarding the level of free, pharmacologically active abaloparatide in anti-
abaloparatide antibody positive animals. 
The low number of ADA-positive animals in long-term animal studies is in contrast to the situation in 
patients, where 49% developed ADA following 18 months of treatment (pivotal phase III study), and 
ADA formation correlated with a decrease in abaloparatide exposure. Thus the non-clinical results do 
not reflect the clinical situation and are considered of limited value for human risk assessment.  
Abaloparatide is a synthetic peptide with homology to the N-terminal part of human PTHrP. The amino 
acid sequence of rat, monkey and human PTHrP is identical and, therefore, abaloparatide shares the 
same degree of identity (76%) to the endogenous PTHrP of rats, monkeys and humans. The difference 
in immunogenicity across species cannot be explained only by the degree of amino-acid sequence 
identity. 
Immunotoxicity 
The observation of increased spleen weights, changes in white blood cell counts and formation of 
osteosarcomas and osteoblastomas in rats are related to the pharmacological effect of abaloparatide, 
namely the reduction of the bone marrow canal secondary to bone formation and the direct anabolic 
effect on bone. Therefore, these effects are of no immunotoxicological significance and the conduct of 
additional immunotoxicity studies with abaloparatide is not considered necessary.

Impurities 
A specific impurity of abaloparatide appeared during long term storage, and its toxicological profile was 
evaluated in molecular potency and target binding screens, 2- and 4-week toxicity studies in rats, and 
in a complete genotoxicity package (gene mutation test in bacteria, chromosomal aberration test in 
vitro, bone marrow micronucleus test in vivo). The results of these studies showed that this specific 
impurity was 10-fold less potent than abaloparatide, and did not inhibit molecular targets at clinically 
relevant doses. The genotoxicity studies showed negative results. There were no new or additional 
toxicological findings associated with this impurity, following abaloparatide/degradant administration at 
65/5 μg/kg/day or 21/49 μg/kg/day, for 4 weeks. The Applicant suggests a specification limit for this 
impurity of abaloparatide of ≤ 5% at the end of shelf life. Exposure to this impurity in the rat 
toxicology studies, which did not demonstrate any new or exaggerated toxicological findings, was up to 
around 600-fold compared to the human exposure to this impurity with the 80 ug dose at the proposed 
≤ 5% specification. At the NOAEL in a 2-week repeated dose toxicity study in rats exposure to this 
impurity was 155-fold compared to the human exposure with the 80 ug dose at the proposed ≤ 5% 
specification limit. 
In response to a request which was based on the concern of possibly higher antigenicity of this 
impurity compared to abaloparatide due to the structural difference, the applicant re-evaluated data 
from phase 3 clinical study BA058-05-003 considering anti-drug-antibody (ADA)-status and calculated 
amount of the impurity administered to the patients. The data show that ADA-positive and ADA-
negative patients had received similar (not statistically significantly different) amounts (average as 
well as maximal amounts) of the impurity, suggesting that the impurity is not a primary driver of 
immunogenicity in patients.   
The specification limit of ≤ 5% proposed by the applicant is considered toxicologically qualified. 
Phototoxicity 
As abaloparatide does not absorb visible wavelengths and as no evidence for accumulation in organs 
exposed to light was seen, abaloparatide does not raise concerns regarding phototoxicity. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has performed a Phase I assessment, as specified in the ERA guideline. The Log KOW 
values for abaloparatide, and LogP values for the non-natural amino acid 2-aminoisobutyric acid, which 
is a part of abaloparatide, were not experimentally determined. Normally this would be required; 
however, considering that abaloparatide is a peptide the predicted values can be accepted. 
Abaloparatide PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance 
as log KOW does not exceed 4.5. Therefore abaloparatide is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In vitro studies showed that abaloparatide is acting specifically via the PTH1 receptor. The non-clinical 
in vivo pharmacology program demonstrated that daily SC injections of abaloparatide stimulated the 
formation of bone and restored bone mineral density (BMD) at vertebral and nonvertebral sites in OVX, 
osteopenic rats and monkeys as compared to relevant vehicle controls. The provided non-clinical in 
vivo studies do not, however, convincingly show that abaloparatide displays a differentiating profile 
compared to hPTH(1-34) (teriparatide). Notably there was no significant difference in calcium plasma 
Assessment report

Page 40/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mobilisation at therapeutic doses of abaloparatide compared to hPTH1-34 in vivo, whereas 
hypercalcaemia was in fact observed at clinically relevant exposure levels of abaloparatide in repeat-
dose toxicity studies.  Furthermore, both compounds were similar efficacious anabolic agents capable 
of fully restoring BMD at comparable doses in OVX rats.  
In safety pharmacology studies performed in conscious dogs, SC administration of abaloparatide dose-
dependently and significantly increased heart rate (68-120% max increase at 1-10 µg/kg) while the QT 
interval was markedly shortened at all doses (max decrease 60 ms). The observed increase in heart 
rate is believed to be of clinical relevance and is expected to be observed clinically (see that section), 
whereas an influence on QT intervals appears to be not likely. 
Pharmacokinetic data revealed no unexpected findings regarding a synthetic peptide with SC 
administration. However, the pharmacokinetic profile of abaloparatide was not established in all 
species tested in vivo (i.e. PK results were absent in the dog). However, the relevance of this 
deficiency for the safe use of the product appears to be low. Further studies are not considered 
absolutely necessary.  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies with abaloparatide in rats and monkeys identified the bone, bone marrow, 
kidney and heart as main target organs for toxicity. The observed effects were due to exaggerated 
pharmacology (agonism of PTHR1). The anabolic effect on bone was overall more pronounced in rats 
than in monkeys, and occurred at lower doses and exposure levels as well. The reason for this 
difference between species is probably a more osteoblast-driven, proliferative response to PTH agonists 
in rats as compared with monkeys, where PTH appears to stimulate bone remodelling.  
The major non-clinical finding that is considered of potential concern for patients is tissue 
mineralisation, with or without associated hypercalcaemia. In long term animal repeated dose studies 
mineralisation of organs was seen at low dosages, and at exposure ranges close to the clinically 
intended exposure. 
The non-clinical data suggests that tissue mineralisation can occur even without persistent 
hypercalcaemia, as evidenced by the transient or (in 26-weeks rats) non-detectable changes in serum 
calcium levels. Furthermore, mineralisation in monkeys occurred also in the heart and other organs 
apart from the kidneys. Calcium deposition was associated with degenerative/necrotic and 
inflammatory lesions in the heart and kidney, and was not reversible in the 39-weeks study. 
Hypercalcaemia has been observed in the clinical setting as well (see the Clinical Assessment Report); 
therefore, due to a request the applicant included hypercalcaemia as an important identified risk and 
organ calcification as an important potential risk in the summary of safety concerns of the proposed 
RMP. 
In a two year bioassay in rats, abaloparatide induced the formation of osteosarcoma at every tested 
dose. Due to the high incidence of osteosarcomas there was a resulting lower survival, especially in 
males. There is a theoretical risk that the lower survival rate may have obscured less pronounced 
carcinogenic effects in other tissues. However, there is no evidence for carcinogenicity in other tissues 
than bone. 
The carcinogenic potential of abaloparatide in rats is qualitatively comparable to hPTH(1-34). 
Quantitative differences observed (e.g. higher incidence of bone tumours in males treated with 
abaloparatide versus hPTH(1-34)) are difficult to assess due to the lack of exposure data for hPTH(1-
34). Both molecules are activators of hPTH1R and the carcinogenic potential in rats is probably a class 
effect for hPTH1R agonists. The potential reasons for the rodent specific development of 
osteosarcomas are an exaggerated response of rat bones to constant hPTH1R activation and osteoblast 
stimulation and the differences in bone metabolism in rodents and humans.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 41/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The effect in rodents is predominated by bone formation whereas in primates the main effect is 
remodelling including bone resorption and reconstruction. The species differences between rats versus 
monkeys and humans in terms of bone anabolic response are well documented in scientific literature. 
There is broad scientific consensus on these species differences. Nevertheless, osteosarcoma must 
remain as an important potential risk for patients treated with abaloparatide and – similar to rhPTH(1-
34) –for which  appropriate risk mitigation and follow up measures would be necessary. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Overall, in the non-clinical documentation all concerns have been addressed adequately.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Abaloparatide is intended for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk 
of fracture to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures. In contrast to the primarily prescribed 
antiresorptive anti-osteoporotic drugs, e.g. bisphosphonates, which act by decreasing the bone loss, 
abaloparatide stimulates the production and activity of osteoblasts, increasing BMD by building new 
bone. Teriparatide is at time of this report the only bone anabolic drug licensed in the EU. The finished 
product abaloparatide is proposed to be supplied as a 1.5 mL multi-dose cartridge installed in a multi-
use pen for subcutaneous (sc) injection enabling self-dosing. 
Besides pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies abaloparatide has been investigated 
in 1 phase 2, dose-ranging, 24 weeks study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BA058-05-
002) and a 24 weeks extension (amendment 5) and 1 phase 3, pivotal clinical trial in postmenopausal 
women with osteoporosis to prevent the occurrence of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures (Study 
BA058-05-003) with an extension (BA058-05-005) for which the final analysis has been submitted 
during the procedure. 
GCP 
According to the applicant all clinical studies were performed in full compliance with Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and all other applicable local regulatory and ethical requirements and all clinical studies, 
including those conducted outside the European Community (EC) met the ethical requirements of 
Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Three inspection requests were adopted by the CHMP for this application, a routine 
(GCP/INS/2015/030) and two triggered requests (GCP/INS/2016/001; GCP/INS/2016/013). 
Six sites have been inspected with regard to this application. The routine request covered three 
investigator sites, one in Vilnius, Lithuania, one in Hong Kong, and the site of the contract research 
organisation in Denmark. In addition, two triggered, unannounced GCP inspections were requested and 
performed at three sites: an investigator site in Czech Republic and two investigator sites in Denmark.  
These inspections were conducted between February and April 2016 in connection with the conduct of 
the single pivotal trial BA058-05-003 supporting the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for 
abaloparatide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 42/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In parallel and at the same time of the triggered inspections requested by the CHMP, the Czech 
competent authority conducted GCP inspections at three investigator sites in Czech Republic. 
It should be noted that the triggered inspections have been focused to address specific concerns on the 
conduct of the clinical trial and thus the number of deviations in some facilities cannot be taken as a 
reflection of the compliance status in study BA058-05-003 in general. 
During the inspections conducted by the Czech competent authority, critical findings were identified 
relating to patient’s inclusion in the clinical trial, the quality system of the sites and the availability of 
documents requested during the inspection.  Due to the critical findings observed at two sites in Czech 
Republic, the inspectors concluded that the data from these sites cannot be reliable, and recommended 
to exclude them when assessing the marketing authorisation application.  
As a consequence, the CHMP has requested the applicant to exclude the data from these sites in the 
Czech Republic during the review of the marketing authorisation application for the purpose of the 
evaluation of the efficacy and safety of abaloparatide. The exclusion of these two study sites in the 
single pivotal study resulted in a reduction of the total study population by 16% from 2463 to 2070 
participants.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK properties of abaloparatide were evaluated in healthy subjects, subjects with renal impairment, 
and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Six (6) phase 1 safety, PK, and PK/PD studies (single 
dose, multiple ascending dose, bioavailability), as well as 1 dose-finding phase 2, 1 supportive phase 
2, and 1 pivotal phase 3 study (with an extension finalised during the MAA procedure) including a 
population PK analysis were conducted [studies 2-52-52127-001, BA058-05-001, BA058-05-001B,

BA058-05-010, BA058-05-011, BA058-05-012, BA058-05-002, BA058-05-007, and BA058-05-003 
(population PK analysis)].  
The first 2 phase 1 studies (2-52-52127-001, BA058-05-001) were conducted with an initial lyophilised 
formulation of abaloparatide. Study 2-52-52127-001 was a single-dose PK and bioavailability clinical 
trial in healthy male and female subjects >55 years of age, study BA058-05-001 was a repeated dose 
7-day PK/PD study in 39 healthy postmenopausal women from 50 to 73 years of age, study BA058-05-
001B was a repeated dose 7-day PK/PD study in 30 healthy postmenopausal women from 52 to 74 
years of age investigating a new liquid formulation presented as prefilled multi-dose cartridge for use 
in a pen injector device, study BA058-05-010 was a single-dose PK and bioavailability study in healthy 
male and female subjects 20 to 54 years of age, study BA058-05-011 was a single dose study to 
evaluate the effects of varying degrees of renal impairment on abaloparatide PK, and study BA058-05-
012 was a four way crossover thorough QT/QTc in healthy subjects. 
The applicant has provided an overview of analytical methods and details have been given in each 
relevant section. The analytical methods are considered appropriate. Conventional pharmacokinetic 
methods were used. In addition, a population PK analysis using data from the pivotal phase 3 trial was 
performed. The statistical methods used for PK analyses are acceptable.  
Bioavailability of the to be marketed formulation of abaloparatide was determined following a single SC 
and IV administration in healthy volunteers of both genders. Abaloparatide was rapidly absorbed with 
median Tmax of 0.4 h and 1.8 h for SC and IV administration, respectively, while mean t½ were 1.9 h 
and 0.9 h, respectively. Following SC injection Cmax reached 467.3 ± 143.83 ng/ml. Thereafter 
abaloparatide plasma concentrations declined in a multiphasic manner until 3 h for SC administration, 
the last time point with results above the LLOQ. Clearance and the apparent volume of distribution 
(Vz/F) were greater after SC than after IV administration. Bioavailability for abaloparatide 80 µg SC 
was 39.44% (90% CI: 32.6 to 47.8%).  
The applicant provided a new Pop PK model. The revised model assumed an empirical time varying IV 
infusion rate in study BA058-05-010 but it is clear that a constant infusion rate was used. The new 
model better described the data; a plausible mechanistic explanation for the modelled infusion rate has 
been provided. 
According to the applicant except for the first two studies in humans the same liquid formulation of 
abaloparatide in a multi-dose prefilled cartridge has been used to be applied with a pen delivery 
device. All relevant PK and PD data have been generated with this formulation. Thus no bioequivalence 
data are required. 
Abaloparatide is to be administered SC and therefore no studies to evaluate the effect of food on PK 
have been conducted. 
Human plasma protein binding of abaloparatide is about 70% and the apparent volume of distribution 
around 170 L after SC administration. Data indicate that abaloparatide has fast elimination and is 
primarily excreted in urine. Metabolism of abaloparatide has been investigated in preclinical studies 
only which is acceptable for a compound comparable to an endogenous protein. Abaloparatide appears 
to be rapidly degraded by multiple proteases into shorter peptide fragments which are probably 
excreted renally. 
Systemic exposure of abaloparatide appears to be approximately proportional to dose from 80 µg to 
240 µg without further increase at doses of 280 µg and 320 µg; the lack of further increases in 
systemic exposure beyond 240 µg of abaloparatide is consistent with a saturation of absorption from 
the SC injection site.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 47/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abaloparatide does not seem to exhibit time dependent pharmacokinetics; mean pharmacokinetic 
parameters were in general comparable between day 1 and day 7. 
The pharmacokinetics of abaloparatide in subjects with impaired renal function has specifically been 
investigated. Abaloparatide is primarily excreted in urine and systemic exposure increases with 
decreasing renal function but the available data so far do not indicate the need for a dose adjustment 
for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  
However, efficacy and safety of abaloparatide have been established in the phase 3 study BA058-05-
003; the typical abaloparatide exposure in this study should be considered the ”normal” exposure. 
Therefore, in the renal impairment study, the exposure comparison and any recommendations should 
be made against subjects with renal function that is typical of the pivotal efficacy / safety trial patient 
population in study BA058-05-003. The data from the phase 3 study indicate that patient with 
moderate and mild renal impairment had higher exposure compared to the renal impairment study in 
healthy subjects.  
Abaloparatide systemic exposure increases with decreasing renal function and in study BA-058-05-
001B a planned 160 µg dose group was abandoned due to increasing nausea events in participants 
receiving 120 µg of abaloparatide, indicating that increased exposure to abaloparatide is associated 
with an increase in adverse events. The applicant has provided results of the additional Study 
17RAD102 investigating the potential of abaloparatide as a substrate of renal transporters. The study 
seems adequate for all transporters except OAT3; based on these results, abaloparatide appears not to 
be a substrate of renal transporters OAT1, OCT2, MATE1, or MATE2K. The applicant is asked to further 
investigate whether abaloparatide is a substrate for OAT3 using a sensitive method with adequate 
uptake and positive controls as a PAM. 
No specific pharmacokinetic studies in subjects with hepatic impairment were performed which is 
acceptable. As a compound comparable to an endogenous protein, abaloparatide is not expected to be 
considerably eliminated via hepatic metabolic mechanisms. Results of the population pharmacokinetic 
analysis in the pivotal phase 3 trial showed no evidence for a correlation with hepatic function. 
From the scarce data available no significant influence of gender on PK parameters has been identified. 
Data are primarily available in female subjects; since abaloparatide is only indicated in women this is 
acceptable. 
Pharmacokinetics of abaloparatide in children have not been studied; the applicant received a product-
specific waiver for conducting paediatric studies for all subsets of the paediatric population. 
No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted for this program. The applicant 
considered the potential for drug-drug interactions to be low. It was argued that abaloparatide is a 
potent and selective ligand for PTHR1 with no known significant affinity to PTHR2 or other molecular 
targets; the likelihood of abaloparatide-mediated calcium mobilisation drug-drug interactions was thus 
considered low. Abaloparatide is also rapidly degraded by proteases in serum with a short halt-life, has 
no known inhibiting or inducing effects on metabolising enzymes from the CYP family, and is not a 
substrate or inhibitor of the P-gp and BCRP drug transporters. This is agreed. 
As regards interactions the abaloparatide cut-offs used to determine potential clinical relevance of in 
vitro enzyme and transporter inhibition data, based on EMA guideline on the investigation on drug 
interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1) are listed in the Table 5 below.

Table 5 EMA DDI guideline cut-offs for relevance of in vitro data of abaloparatide 
Abaloparatide has been investigated as a competitive and mechanism based inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2A6, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4/5 in vitro. In addition, abaloparatide was investigated as an 
in vitro inhibitor of human transporters, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, P-gp and BCRP. No 
inhibition was observed.  
The in vitro induction study in hepatocyte showed no risk for CYP induction of abaloparatide on 
CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A. However a decrease of the CYP mRNA levels compared to the vehicle control 
was observed.   
Exposure safety margins were calculated between maximally dosages used in toxicity studies and the 
intended dose in humans. This is of little value for calculations of margins between animal and human 
exposure. Far more relevant are the margins between systemic exposure at NOAELs determined in 
long-term animal toxicity studies and the systemic exposure in humans at the proposed dose. Organ 
mineralisation occurred at low dosages after long-term administration in animal studies and thus these 
safety margins are extremely small if present at all.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic evaluations of the effect of abaloparatide on bone metabolism markers and bone 
mineral density (BMD) were carried out in studies 2-52-52127-001, BA058-05-001, BA058-05-001B, 
BA058-05-002, BA058-05-007, BA058-05-011, BA058-05-012, and the pivotal phase 3 Study BA058-
05-003 with the initial 6 month of its ongoing extension BA058-05-005. Studies 2-52-52127-001 and 
BA-058-05-001 used the discontinued lyophilised formulation 1 of abaloparatide while all other studies 
used the to be marketed formulation. 
As regards primary pharmacology abaloparatide induced a linear increase with dose in BMD at the 
spine and differences to placebo were statistically significant after 24 weeks of treatment. Femoral 
neck BMD increased compared to placebo but only the difference for 80 µg abaloparatide was 
statistically significant compared to placebo and also at the hip the increase in BMD was highest with 
80 µg abaloparatide. At the ultra-distal wrist changes in BMD were not significantly different from 
placebo. The effects were also seen at the end of the extension period at 48 weeks.  
PTH levels decreased slightly and not-dose dependant with abaloparatide and this effect was sustained 
with 80 µg of abaloparatide.  
Treatment with abaloparatide led to a mobilisation of calcium and a transient decrease in serum 
phosphorus levels; both calcium and phosphorus levels remained within normal ranges and urine 
excretion remained unchanged.  
Mean s-P1NP levels fluctuated around predose levels with lower doses of abaloparatide while mean 
s-P1NP and s-P1CP levels increased following 80 µg up to 8 days and then declined slightly; s-OC and 
s-BALP followed an opposite trend with a slight decrease in concentrations throughout the first 3 days 
of dosing, before increasing up to day 14. Mean serum s-CTX concentrations remained at or near 
predose levels. When administered for 24 weeks P1NP, BALP, and s-OC showed a statistically 
significant linear trend in dose response and differences from placebo were statistically significant for

abaloparatide 40 µg and 80 µg. P1CP initially increased then declined toward baseline levels. CTX and 
NTX both showed an apparent dose-dependent rise across 24-week treatment; differences of CTX 
levels were statistically significant from placebo for abaloparatide 40 µg and 80 µg, while results for 
NTX were only statistically significant for 40 µg. Changes in bone markers P1NP, BALP, and s-OC were 
also seen after 48 weeks of treatment at the end of the extension period while CTX values tended to 
plateau or decrease after week 24; results for NTX were more variable and continued to increase for 
abaloparatide 80 µg.  
With lower doses of abaloparatide 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations remained unchanged while 
they increased steadily reaching a plateau above normal range at 24 h with 40 µg and 80 µg 
abaloparatide.  
As regards study BA058-05-007 investigating the transdermal application of abaloparatide only data 
from subjects who received abaloparatide 80 µg SC or placebo transdermal have been provided; the 
transdermal route of administration has not been applied for in the current procedure and according to 
the applicant is still under development. The provided data for abaloparatide 80 µg SC in this trial are 
in line with findings in study BA058-05-002 for abaloparatide 80 µg SC and thus the omission of the 
full CSR of study BA058-05-007 is considered acceptable within this application. 
The investigation of pharmacodynamic effects of abaloparatide in subjects with renal impairment 
showed slight differences in calcium, phosphate, and cAMP levels in serum and urine in subjects with 
different degrees of renal function, but no relationship with severity of renal impairment could be 
identified due to high variability and overlapping values. Thus although abaloparatide systemic 
exposure increases with decreasing renal function, no clear relationship could be confirmed for 
pharmacodynamic parameters.  
In the QT study 80 µg and 240 µg abaloparatide had no clinically meaningful or concerning impact on 
cardiac electrophysiology but caused a clear increase in heart rate. 
Secondary pharmacology has not been specifically investigated. Possible secondary pharmacodynamic 
effects of abaloparatide might be mediated via increased calcium levels in serum or urine. The effect of 
abaloparatide on calcium homeostasis has been investigated and the results do not indicate significant 
effects that would trigger a concern in this regard. There were, however, higher incidences of adverse 
events such as palpitations, nausea, dizziness, and headache for abaloparatide compared to 
teriparatide. A higher percentage of subjects discontinued treatment due to orthostatic hypotension 
defined as a composite adverse event of special interest (AESI) in the abaloparatide compared to the 
teriparatide group. This may suggest that abaloparatide has secondary pharmacodynamic effects 
besides the increase in calcium levels.  However, the available data indicate that abaloparatide is 
selective for the PTH1 receptor with no currently known secondary targets and that the primary 
pharmacology following abaloparatide treatment in nonclinical models was consistent with bone 
anabolic effects and secondary pharmacological effects including increases in urine and serum calcium 
levels, hypotension, and transient and reversible increases in heart rate. Changes observed in the 
cardiovascular system included positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. Abaloparatide did not bind 
to or activate the PTH2 receptor.  
Median peak levels of abaloparatide increased in an approximate dose-proportional manner with 20 µg, 
40 µg, and 80 µg SC and these doses induced a dose dependent increase in percent change in BMD at 
the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck, while no differences were seen at the ultra-distal wrist; 
the largest increase in BMD was noted for abaloparatide 80 µg SC. This dose-response relationship was 
also confirmed for serum markers s-P1NP, s-BALP, and s-OC.

Abaloparatide is neither expected to affect pharmacodynamic properties of concomitantly administered 
drugs nor are concomitant drugs expected to affect pharmacodynamic properties of abaloparatide; no 
studies on pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances have been 
conducted which is acceptable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of abaloparatide were evaluated in healthy subjects, subjects with renal impairment, 
and in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis; the latter included a population PK analysis. Human 
plasma protein binding of abaloparatide is about 70% and the apparent volume of distribution around 
170 L after subcutaneous administration. Data indicate fast elimination primarily via urine. Metabolism 
of abaloparatide has been investigated in preclinical studies only which is acceptable for a compound 
comparable to an endogenous protein. Abaloparatide appears to be rapidly degraded by multiple 
proteases into shorter peptide fragments which are probably excreted renally. Abaloparatide appears 
to show dose-proportionality between 80 and 240 µg without further increase in exposure at doses of 
280 µg and 320 µg indicating a saturation of absorption from the subcutaneous injection site. The 
available data do not indicate time dependent pharmacokinetics. Abaloparatide systemic exposure 
increases with decreasing renal function; no dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to 
moderate renal impairment. No specific pharmacokinetic studies in subjects with hepatic impairment 
were performed which is acceptable. From the scarce data available no significant influence of gender 
on PK parameters has been identified. No analysis of the influence of ethnicity, weight, or age on 
pharmacokinetic parameters has been identified. Exposure safety margins were calculated between 
maximally dosages used in toxicity studies and the intended dose in humans which is of little value for 
calculations of margins between animal and human exposure; organ mineralisation occurred at low 
dosages after long-term administration in animal studies and thus these safety margins are extremely 
small if present at all. Evaluation of the population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the model 
does not describe the data very well; inter-individual variability and maximal and minimal 
concentrations seem to be underestimated.  
As regards primary pharmacology abaloparatide induced increases with dose in bone mineral density at 
the spine, femoral neck, and hip; at the ultra-distal wrist changes in bone mineral density were not 
significantly different from placebo. PTH levels decreased slightly and not-dose dependant with 
abaloparatide, while calcium was mobilised and serum phosphorus levels decreased transiently. 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations increased steadily reaching a plateau above normal range at 24 h. 
As regards bone serum markers s-P1NP and s-P1CP levels increased with 80 µg abaloparatide and s-
osteocalcin and s-BALP slightly decreased throughout the first days of dosing before increasing; s-CTX 
concentrations remained at or near predose levels.  
In the QT study abaloparatide had no clinically meaningful or concerning impact on cardiac 
electrophysiology but caused a relevant increase in heart rate (see also ‘Thorough QTC study’ in the 
safety section below). 
Secondary pharmacology has not been specifically investigated. There were higher incidences of 
adverse events such as palpitations, nausea, and dizziness for abaloparatide compared to teriparatide 
and a higher percentage of subjects discontinued treatment due to orthostatic hypotension defined as 
a composite AESI in the abaloparatide compared to the teriparatide group; this may suggest that 
abaloparatide has secondary pharmacodynamic effects besides the increase in calcium levels. 
However, the available data indicate that abaloparatide is selective for the PTH1 receptor with no 
currently known secondary targets. Changes observed in the cardiovascular system included positive 
chronotropic and inotropic effects. Abaloparatide did not bind to or activate the PTH2 receptor.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall the available pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data are adequate for this application. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies and main clinical studies 
The application is based on 1 phase 2, dose-ranging, 24 weeks study in postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis (BA058-05-002) and 1 phase 3, pivotal clinical trial of abaloparatide in postmenopausal 
women with osteoporosis to prevent the occurrence of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures (Study 
BA058-05-003) and its extension (BA058-05-005). In previous CHMP scientific advice, the applicant 
was not recommended to perform only one pivotal trial, instead two separate studies for vertebral 
fractures and for non-vertebral fractures were recommended. 
Dose response study 
In the phase 2 dose response study BA058-05-002 postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis applied 
daily SC injections of either placebo, abaloparatide 20 µg, 40 µg, 80 µg, or teriparatide 20 µg; the 
initial treatment period was 24 weeks, but with protocol amendment 5, a 24 weeks extension was 
introduced for patients who had not had serious adverse events (SAE) considered treatment related, 
who were within 14 days of their last study drug administration, and who had not shown deterioration 
in BMD during the initial 24 weeks of treatment. Effects were assessed in terms of change in BMD from 
baseline to the end of the 24 weeks treatment period and the co-primary endpoints were changes in 
serum bone markers. An extension of care for a further 6 months was offered to patients.  
The data indicate that doses of 20 µg, 40 µg, and 80 µg abaloparatide SC induced a dose dependent 
increase in percent change in BMD at lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck, while no differences 
were seen at ultra-distal wrist; the largest increase in BMD was noted for abaloparatide 80 µg SC. This 
dose-response relationship was also confirmed for serum markers s-P1NP, s-BALP, and s-OC. Thus the 
available data support the dose of 80 µg abaloparatide selected for the pivotal phase 3 trial. 
Main study 
The only pivotal phase 3 study BA058-05-003 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo- and 
comparator-controlled, multicentre international study (EudraCT Number: 2010-022576-30). The study 
design is depicted below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 52/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2 Design of Study BA058-05-003 and extension BA058-05-005 
In line with the ‘Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products in the treatment of primary 
osteoporosis’ (CPMP/EWP/552/95, rev. 2) the duration of treatment in the pivotal phase 3 trial for a 
new osteoporotic medicinal product should in general at least be 24 months in order to provide clear 
fracture and bone safety data; a total duration of 18 months of treatment in the phase 3 study is thus 
of concern. The applicant argues that the combined study BA058-05-003 (18 months abaloparatide) 
and its extension BA058-05-005 (interim data first 6 months alendronate) satisfy the requirement for 
24-months of fracture assessment data. Patients treated either with abaloparatide or placebo but not 
those on teriparatide and who finalised study BA058-05-003 were offered participation in the extension 
study BA058-05-005 with additional 24 months of alendronate, from which the first 6 months were 
added to the original 18 month trial data for a total of 24 months of data. Although this design will 
allow for accruing 24 month of data the design has several deficiencies, among them patients on 
teriparatide have not been offered to participate in the extension study and the continuation in the 
extension study might introduce a selection bias to the data beyond 18 month of treatment. 
Methods  
Eligible for this trial were otherwise healthy, ambulatory, postmenopausal (≥5 years) women aged 50 
to 85 years with osteoporosis. Women were to have a BMD T-score ≤-2.5 and >-5.0 at the lumbar 
spine or hip (femoral neck) by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and radiological evidence of 2 
or more mild or one or more moderate lumbar or thoracic vertebral fractures, or history of low trauma 
forearm, humerus, sacral, pelvic, hip, femoral, or tibial fracture within the past 5 years. 
Postmenopausal women older than 65 who met the fracture criteria but had a T-score ≤-2.0 and >-5.0 
could be enrolled. Additionally, women older than 65 who did not meet the fracture criteria could also 
be enrolled if their T-score was ≤-3.0 and >-5.0.  
Further inclusion criteria were a body mass index (BMI) of ≥18.5 to ≤33 kg/m2, albumin-adjusted 
serum calcium, PTH (1-84), serum phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase values within normal range 
during screening; patients with an elevated alkaline phosphatase (AP) value, who met all other entry 
criteria needed a normal bone-specific AP result to be enrolled. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values 
needed to be above 15 ng/mL and within 3 times the upper normal (ULN) range. Resting 12-lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG) during screening should not show clinically significant abnormality and a QTc 
≤470 msec (Bazett’s correction). Systolic blood pressure was to be ≥100 and ≤155 mmHg, diastolic

blood pressure ≥40 and ≤95 mmHg, and the heart rate ≥45 and ≤100 beats per minute (bpm) (sitting 
or supine). Concomitant medications could be continued if not listed as exclusion criteria. 
Exclusion criteria were continuing significant deterioration of BMD at lumbar spine or hip from baseline 
(>7%, after confirmation), hypercalcaemia or hypercalciuria, treatment-related serious adverse events 
(SAEs), severe hypersensitivity to abaloparatide or teriparatide, refusal of treatment, inability to 
complete study procedures, loss to follow-up, and significant abnormality of serum haemoglobin (Hgb), 
haematocrit (Hct), white blood cells (WBC), platelets, or usual serum biochemistry (electrolytes, renal 
function, liver function, serum proteins). Investigators could also withdraw patients from the study for 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 3 or 4 AEs, a complex of 
AEs which justified treatment cessation, serious intercurrent illness, non-compliance, protocol 
violations, administrative reasons, and for evidence of clinically significant abnormality in the opinion of 
the investigator.  
Patients received either abaloparatide self-administered as an 80 µg daily subcutaneous (SC) injection, 
matching placebo, or teriparatide 20 µg for 18 months, randomised in a 1:1:1 scheme.  
According to the statistical analysis plan and the CSR the endpoints were defined as follows.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was the percent of patients with one or more incident new 
vertebral fracture according to Genant’s method (Genant HK, et al, J Bone Miner Res. 1993:1137-48) 
from the baseline spine X-rays until post-baseline spine X-rays over the study treatment period of 18 
month with abaloparatide 80 µg SC compared to placebo.  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the time to the first incident non-vertebral fracture (NVF) by 
the follow-up visit 10 which equals 19 months. The applicant argues that NVF may occur and become 
clinically apparent at any time in the study and that it was expected that abaloparatide might reduce 
the incidence of NVF and also delay their onset. To evaluate both the incidence and the time-to-event, 
the statistical method to analyse NVF had been changed from the planned analysis in the protocol to 
using (a) the log-rank test for the inferential statistic and (b) the Kaplan-Meier method for estimates of 
event rates and to use all data up to the end of the follow-up visit 10 (19 months). Furthermore, the 
endpoint was changed from the incidence of NVF up to end of treatment (18 month) to time to first 
incidence of NVF by the end of the follow-up visit 10 (19 month). NVF was source-document verified 
and adjudicated and included fractures of the hip, wrist, forearm, shoulder, collar bone, upper arm, 
ribs, upper leg (not hip), knee, lower leg (not knee or ankle), foot, ankle, hand, pelvis (not hip), 
tailbone, and other, those associated with low trauma defined as a fall from standing height or less, or 
a fall on stairs, steps or curbs, and those associated with minimal or moderate trauma other than a 
fall. NVF excluded those of the spine, of the breast bone, knee cap, toes, fingers, skull, facial bones, 
pathologic fractures, fractures associated with high trauma, and those associated with severe trauma 
other than a fall.  
Additional key secondary efficacy endpoints were the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine 
BMD, the percent change from baseline in total hip BMD, and the percent change from baseline in 
femoral neck BMD through end of 18-month treatment. 
Other efficacy endpoints defined in the statistical analysis plan were the change and the percent 
change in vertical (standing) height from baseline to end of 18-month, severity of incident new or 
worsening vertebral fractures with abaloparatide versus placebo over the study treatment period up to 
18 months, the percent change in distal 1/3 radius BMD from baseline through end of 18-month in a 
subset of patients, the percent change in serum P1NP, BALP, s-OC, and CTX in a subset of patients, 
and the incidence of patients with one or more incident new vertebral fractures with teriparatide 
compared to placebo over 18 months. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 54/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety related endpoints were incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) through the 30-day 
follow-up period, frequency of hypercalcaemia versus teriparatide, changes in clinical laboratory 
parameters, determination of serum calcium, creatinine clearance, and the urine calcium / creatinine 
ratio, post-dose electrocardiogram (ECG) assessments, assessments of postural hypotension (60 min 
post dose), bone biopsy of the iliac crest in a subset of patients receiving abaloparatide, placebo, and 
teriparatide for assessment of quantitative bone histomorphometry, local injection site tolerance, anti-
abaloparatide antibody assessment, assessment of renal parenchyma and collecting system for renal 
calcification via renal computed tomography (CT) scan in subset of patients. 
Radiographs were to be viewed and assessed centrally according to the ‘Charter for Independent 
Imaging Assessment’ by a blinded, independent radiologist and confirmed by a second blinded 
radiologist for all patients for whom an incident fracture had been identified. In case of disagreement a 
third consensus assessment was made to adjudicate the incident fracture. A standardised graded scale 
of severity of the vertebral deformity was provided for this assessment. 
NVFs were to be source-document verified and adjudicated according to the ‘BA058-05-003 Clinical 
and Non-vertebral Fracture Verification and Adjudication Process’. 
BMD scan for patient eligibility was to be determined at the study site; acceptability of each DXA scan 
was subsequently to be confirmed with the study sites by the Central Imaging CRO. According to the 
‘Charter for Independent Imaging Assessment’ all BMD measurements were centrally read by 
BioClinica-Synarc. The Synarc corrected BMD was used to derive percent (%) change from baseline in 
BMD. Investigators were blinded to results of all follow-up DXA scans throughout the study unless a 
safety issue was identified by the independent radiologist.  
The choice of incidence of new vertebral fractures as the primary endpoint is acceptable. As regards 
the key secondary efficacy endpoint and the additional key secondary and other efficacy endpoints, the 
description in the statistical analysis plan and the CSR is contradictory even within the documents; for 
further details see assessment of statistics below. 
The study was blinded for all three treatment groups up to the time of randomisation when the study 
medication kit was assigned to eligible patients; abaloparatide and placebo remained double-blind, 
while it was not possible to blind the positive control teriparatide as it was delivered in its commercial 
form. The blind for abaloparatide and placebo was maintained throughout Study 003, the 6-month 
extension on alendronate and during data analysis.  
Imaging data including spine X-ray images and DXA for BMD were centrally read as objective 
endpoints in a blinded fashion. All clinical fractures were also confirmed using source data without 
knowledge of treatment assignment. The overall safety of the study patients was monitored 
independently by a DSMB. 
Although the active comparator has not been blinded due to commercial availability of teriparatide, the 
blind has been adequately maintained between abaloparatide and placebo throughout the study and 
randomised distribution to study arms was double-blind. Thus blinding is acceptable as regards the 
comparisons of abaloparatide versus placebo. However, for the analysis of differences in effects 
between teriparatide and abaloparatide as well teriparatide and placebo it has to be considered that 
patients and physicians have been aware of the treatment applied in patients on teriparatide. 
In general, the methods of study BA058-05-003 are acceptable and teriparatide is an adequate 
comparator, although for the interpretation of the results it has to be considered that teriparatide 
treatment was not blinded.

The statistical analysis plan (SAP) was finalised two days prior to database lock with change of the 
analysis of key secondary endpoint NVFs from comparison of NVF incidence to time to first NVF. 
Additionally, post-hoc modifications to the definition of NVF were introduced following FDA advice.  
A hierarchical approach was employed to properly control the overall type-I error rate at the 2-sided 
significance level of 5% for testing the multiple hypotheses on the primary and the secondary efficacy 
endpoints for the efficacy. 
The comparison of percentage with vertebral fractures between treatment groups (primary analysis) 
was based on the mITT population excluding patients without post-baseline radiologic assessment. As 
a substantial proportion of randomised patients was excluded from the mITT population and 
differential, treatment-related drop-out between treatment arms was observed, bias cannot be 
excluded. The main reasons why patients had no post-baseline radiological assessment were early 
termination within 3 months from post-baseline X-ray and patient refusal. In line with the overall 
missing data patterns, more patients in the abaloparatide group had their last spine x-ray taken at an 
earlier time point than in the control groups. However, the requested sensitivity analyses address the 
influence of missing data on the results. The ITT-based sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint 
using multiple imputation provided by the applicant is acknowledged. Additional sensitivity analyses 
were requested, in particular analyses aiming to estimate the treatment effect taking loss of benefit 
after drop-out from active treatment. These sensitivity analyses were provided and supported the 
results of the primary analysis, including sensitivity analyses excluding the two sites from the Czech 
Republic. The analysis of time to first NVF was based on log-rank test, and the treatment effect was 
estimated as hazard ratio using Cox regression. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used 
as the primary analysis method to compare treatment groups for the percent change from baseline in 
BMD with missing imputation based on last observation carried forward (LOCF). For time to first NVF 
and BMD, analyses aiming to estimate the treatment effect taking loss of benefit after drop-out from 
active treatment were provided as well and the results supported the pre-specified analyses.   
The protocol amendments and the protocol deviations are not considered to have affected the outcome 
of this trial in a negative way. No unscheduled unblinding has been reported. However, it is of concern 
that the method for analysis of the key secondary endpoint NVFs was changed in the statistical 
analysis plan two days before database lock and that the definition of NVF events was modified in an 
amendment to the SAP after database lock which was explained in the study report by following a 
recommendation from the FDA. However, from a clinical point of view, the change of NVF definition 
(exclusion of knee cap) can be accepted. 
Baseline data 
All patients were postmenopausal women between the ages of 49 and 86 years, inclusive. The median 
age was 68 years (mean [SD] 68.8 [6.52]); 19% of the women were ≥75 years of age and only 4 
patients were ≥85 years of age (0.2%). The median number of years since menopause was 20. 
Approximately 80% of the patients were white. The mean BMI was approximately 25 kg/m2. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics are detailed below. 
The treatment groups were adequately balanced in terms of their centrally assessed BMD T-scores and 
prevalent vertebral fractures at baseline. About 25% had BMD T-scores ˃-2.5 and about 18% had 
severe osteoporosis (at least 1 BMD T-score ≤-2.5 at any anatomical site and prevalent vertebral 
fracture). 
Fracture history was locally assessed and reported in the eCRF by site investigators. There were no 
meaningful differences in the number of prior fractures, prior vertebral fractures, or prior NVFs 
between groups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018

Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were adequately balanced between groups including 
baseline fracture status, BMD T-score, and fracture history. Calculation on the 10 year fracture 
probability has also been provided; results of the assessment of the 10 year fracture probability are 
considered to apply with recommendations set out in the CHMP guideline on osteoporosis (see 
assessment of FRAX report below).  
Numbers analysed 
The percentage of discontinuation was different between groups; it was lowest in the teriparatide 
group where patients were aware of the assigned medication and highest in patients on abaloparatide. 
In addition, the highest percentage of discontinuation due to AEs occurred with abaloparatide. These 
differences were also apparent in comparison to placebo which was adequately blinded throughout the 
study. 
Of the 2070 patients enrolled, 73% (507/696), 80% (546/686), and 77% (531/688) in the 
abaloparatide, teriparatide, and placebo groups, respectively, completed the 18-month study. Of the 
patients who discontinued 72 (38.1%) in the abaloparatide, 44 (31.4%) in the teriparatide, and 41 
(26.1%) in the placebo group discontinued because of an adverse event (AE).  
There was also a significant difference in the percentage of patients with no post-treatment x-ray 
between groups; the percentage of patients with no post-treatment x-ray was higher in patients on 
abaloparatide compared to both placebo and teriparatide. The participant flow is detailed below.

Primary efficacy endpoint new vertebral fractures after 18 months abaloparatide versus placebo 
The predefined primary endpoint of the pivotal study BA058-05-003 was met and the reduction in the 
incidence of new vertebral fractures is considered clinically relevant. The analysis of the PP population 
as well as the sensitivity analysis supports the assumption that after 18 month of treatment 
abaloparatide is superior to placebo as regards the incidence of vertebral fractures. However, 
interpretation of the results is limited by the difference in discontinuation and the percentage of 
patients having a post-treatment x-ray. A potential bias cannot be excluded.

two sites from the Czech Republic) 
Only NEW vertebral fractures were included in the analysis. 
[1] 95% CI for Percent was based on the Wilson’s Score method. 
[2] P-value from Fisher’s exact test comparing Abaloparatide-SC with Placebo and Teriparatide with Placebo. 
[3] The risk reduction was calculated as (Abaloparatide-SC - Placebo) and (Teriparatide - Placebo). 95% CI was based on the 
Newcombe’s method. 
[4] The relative risk reduction was calculated as(Abaloparatide-SC - Placebo) / Placebo and (Teriparatide - Placebo) / Placebo. 95% 
CI was based on the Wald’s method. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoint non-vertebral fractures after 18 months 
The assessment of the key secondary efficacy endpoint non-vertebral fracture for abaloparatide versus 
placebo is considered a confirmatory approach. 
The analysis of the effect of abaloparatide versus placebo on the time to first incidence non-vertebral 
fracture was not statistically significant; the available data indicate a trend in favour of abaloparatide.

The comparison of non-vertebral fractures for abaloparatide versus teriparatide was not statistically 
significant (p=0.4919) and the reduction in the hazard ratio was accompanied by wide confidence 
intervals. . Furthermore, the scale of the y-axis leads to the visual impression of relatively large 
differences while the absolute differences are relatively small and attributable to a small number of 
events. Therefore, although visually different, differences between the curves may well be attributable 
to chance. 
Additional key secondary efficacy endpoints bone mineral density at total hip, femoral neck, and 
lumbar spine at 18 months  
According to the documents provided it appears that only comparisons of change in BMD from baseline 
to 18 months were prespecified for the analyses of ‘key secondary’ and ‘other key secondary efficacy 
endpoint’. Therefore, this assessment presents 18 months comparisons in this section, while 
comparisons of changes in BMD from baseline to 6 and 12 months are presented below in the section 
on ancillary analyses. 
Percentage change in total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine BMD from baseline to 18-month was 
statistically significantly higher with abaloparatide compared to placebo and results demonstrate a 
relevant increase in BMD at these sides in patients on abaloparatide. Increases in BMD were 
comparable between abaloparatide and teriparatide except for ultra-distal radius.

Ancillary analyses 
There were minimal numerical differences in change and percent change in vertical height between 
groups; these differences were neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant. 
The percentage of patients with severe incident new or worsening vertebral fractures was lower with 
abaloparatide and teriparatide than placebo. 
The percent change in BMD at the distal 1/3 radius, ultra-distal radius, and total radius from baseline 
up to 18 months was heterogeneous. In all cases BMD decreased. At the distal 1/3 radius the decrease 
in bone mineral density was lowest in participants receiving placebo and highest in those receiving 
teriparatide. At the ultra-distal radius BMD increased from baseline to 6 months in all groups and 
declined thereafter at 12 and 18 months and BMD was lowest in subjects on placebo. At the total 
radius the percent change in BMD from baseline was higher for abaloparatide versus placebo at 6 
months, but the difference became smaller at 12 and 18 months.  
The increase in the anabolic serum bone marker s-P1NP was higher for abaloparatide versus placebo at 
all time-points, while the increase with teriparatide was higher than with abaloparatide from 3 months 
onwards. The bone resorption marker s-CTX showed a transient increase for abaloparatide versus 
placebo from 3 to 12 months and increases in s-CTX were highest with teriparatide. 
Activities of BALP and s-OC were higher with abaloparatide versus placebo and highest in participants 
using teriparatide.

Teriparatide showed a significant reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures compared to 
placebo. 
Both abaloparatide and teriparatide reduced the incidence of new or worsening vertebral fractures 
versus placebo after 18 months of therapy. 
The time to first incidence of other fractures defined as clinical fracture, major osteoporotic fracture, 
wrist fracture, non-vertebral fracture including any level of trauma, and clinical spine fracture was 
prolonged with abaloparatide compared to placebo and patients on abaloparatide had fewer non-
vertebral fractures including all trauma levels and were fracture-free longer, and the time to first 
clinical spine fracture was prolonged and the incidence lower with abaloparatide versus placebo.  
Time to first incidence of other fractures was also numerically increased for abaloparatide compared to 
teriparatide but differences were mostly not statistically significant and are not considered clinically 
relevant. 
The percentage of patients with BMD changes ˃0%, ˃3%, and ˃6% at lumbar spine, femoral neck, and 
total hip combined was significantly higher with abaloparatide than with placebo and also higher than 
in patients on teriparatide.  
The data indicate that at least the lumbar spine and probably the femoral neck increases in BMD with 
abaloparatide were higher in patients with reduced creatinine clearance compared to patients with 
normal creatinine clearance. The effect might be due to an increase in abaloparatide exposure due to 
reduced renal elimination (see ‘Impaired renal function’ above). 
Analyses of new vertebral fracture, non-vertebral fracture, and BMD by subgroups including age, 
ethnicity, region, and risk at baseline did not indicate an interaction between treatment and the 
majority of subgroups investigated and Forest plots showed effects to be in the same direction for 
these analyses.  
Divergent results were seen for non-vertebral fracture in the subgroups Asian race and Asia region, for 
BMD at the total hip in the subgroup North America, and for BMD at the femoral neck in subgroups 
Black race, North America, and ‘prevalence of vertebral fracture at baseline ≥2 fracture’ but confidence 
intervals overlapped, the number of events was small, and there were too few patients in these 
subgroups to draw any conclusions. 
FRAX-report 
Aims of the FRAX analysis were to evaluate the distribution of fracture risk assessed at baseline using 
the FRAX® tool and to determine the efficacy of abaloparatide and teriparatide in study BA058-05-003 
as a function of baseline fracture risk. 
Baseline fracture probabilities estimated by FRAX® were low compared to several other phase 3 
studies in patients with osteoporosis but for example similar to that seen in clinical trials of 
bazedoxifene. Fracture probabilities increased with age. Baseline characteristics of fracture 
probabilities for patients recruited to the extension study BA058-05-005 did not differ from the 
population of study BA058-05-003 and there were no relevant differences between those who 
continued and those who did not.

Table 8 Ten-year probability (%) for Hip Fracture and Major Osteoporotic Fracture with and 
without BMD Overall (Study 003, excluding the two sites from the Czech Republic) 
Abaloparatide significantly reduced the incidence of all three clinical fracture outcomes in patients with 
probabilities at baseline that fell above the thresholds given in the CHMP guideline on osteoporosis (10-
year probability for spine fracture 15% to 20%, for hip fracture 5% to 7.5%, for major non-vertebral 
fracture 10% to 15%).  
Hazard ratios for the effect of abaloparatide on the various fracture outcomes did not change 
significantly across the range of baseline fracture probabilities, suggesting significant efficacy over the 
whole range. There was, however, a trend for the efficacy to increase with higher baseline major 
osteoporotic fracture probability; significant anti-fracture efficacy was demonstrated in patients 
deemed at high risk according to CHMP guideline on osteoporosis.  
At equivalent fracture probability percentiles, the treatment effect of abaloparatide was greater on 
vertebral fracture risk than on the risk of clinical fractures at other sites; findings were robust to 
several sensitivity analyses. 
There were no statistically significant interactions between treatment and the continuous or categorical 
baseline variables included in the FRAX analysis.

Clinical studies in special populations 
With the exception of phase 2 study BA058-05-011 in male and female volunteers with renal 
impairment no data from clinical studies in special populations have been submitted. For the pivotal 
trial BA058-05-003 subgroups analyses including the effect of age on abaloparatide efficacy have been 
provided; age groups investigated were <65 years, 65 to <75 years, and ≥75 years.

The majority of patients in the pivotal trial BA058-05-003 were in the age range of 65 to 74 years of 
age; about 18% to 20% percent of the treated population was 75 years of age or older at baseline. 
Only 4 patients (0.2%) were ≥85 years of age, 1 patient on abaloparatide (85 years) and 3 patients on 
placebo (85 and 86 years) 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
The applicant has only provided data from one pivotal trial and its extension. Thus no relevant pooled 
analyses or meta-analysis have been submitted. 
Supportive study  
The applicant has provided data from the supportive clinical trial BA058-05-005. In the extension study 
BA058-05-005 patients who were either on abaloparatide or placebo, but not those on teriparatide, in 
the base study BA058-05-003 and who finished the base study were offered to participate and 
received open-label alendronate 70 mg once weekly. The first patient was enrolled on 20 November 
2012 and the last patient completed on 03 October 2016; the final report is dated 19 October 2017. 
Even if not explicitly mentioned at every instance in this assessment report, the data for this 
supportive study are presented without data from the two sites in Czech Republic that cannot be used 
for the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of abaloparatide (see GCP section above).  
Study BA058-05-003 was completed by 1038 patients on abaloparatide or placebo and 963 entered 
study BA058-05-005 (ITT population); of these 863 (89.6%) completed study BA058-05-005, the 
primary reason for non-completion were adverse events. Eight (8) patients did not complete the study 
due to continuing significant deterioration of >7% of BMD at spine or hip from the BA058-05-005 
baseline. For further details see Table 11 below.

Demographic and baseline characteristics were adequately balanced between groups. When based on 
investigator’s locally evaluated DXA and X-rays recorded on the electronic case report form, 99.5% of 
patients in study BA058-05-005 met the study BA058-05-003 BMD and fracture inclusion criteria No 3. 
When centrally read and adjudicated by BioClinica-Synarc the percentage of women meeting this 
inclusion criteria dropped to 80.6%, therefore the assessments of inclusion criterion No. 3 were 
discrepant in the study. Imbalances between the abaloparatide/alendronate and the 
placebo/alendronate group were seen for baseline BMD values in line with the abaloparatide treatment 
effect in study BA085-05-003; fewer patients on abaloparatide/alendronate (9.4%), than on 
placebo/alendronate (19.6%) had severe osteoporosis at study BA058-05-005 baseline. 
For the primary endpoint incidence of new vertebral fractures (mITT) from study BA058-05-003 
baseline to Month 25 of study BA058-05-005 (18 months double-blind abaloparatide or placebo study 
BA058-05-003, 1 month follow-up, 24 months alendronate study BA058-05-005) 4/457 patients 
(0.88%) in the abaloparatide / alendronate group and 26/489 (5.32%) in the placebo / alendronate 
experienced new vertebral fractures; the risk reduction versus placebo (95% CI) was -4.44 (-6.86, 
-2.30; p<0.0001).  
In the placebo/alendronate group, there were 16 patients with new vertebral fracture at Month 18, and 
an additional 10 patients from Month 18 to Month 43, while in the abaloparatide group there were 2 
patients with new vertebral fracture at Month 18, and an additional 2 patients from Month 18 to Month 
43.  
The incidence of new vertebral fracture in the PP population was in line the analysis of the mITT 
population.  
In the analysis of new vertebral fracture in study BA058-05-005 from BA058-05-005 baseline, 0/457 
patients (0%) in the abaloparatide / alendronate group and 6/489 (1.23%) in the placebo / 
alendronate experienced new vertebral fractures at Month 6; the risk reduction versus placebo (95% 
CI) was -1.23 (-2.65, -0.16; p=0.0313). At Month 24 these values were 2/457 (0.44%) and 13/489 
(2.66%), respectively, a risk reduction versus placebo (95% CI) of -2.22 (-4.08, -0.64; p=0.0074).

Alendronate monotherapy started at 19 Months; [1] 95% CI for Percent was based on the Wilson’s Score method; [2] The risk 
reduction was calculated as (Abaloparatide-SC/Alendronate - Placebo/Alendronate). 95% CI was based on the Newcombe’s method; 
[3] The relative risk reduction was calculated as (Abaloparatide-SC/Alendronate - Placebo/Alendronate) / Placebo/Alendronate. 95% 
CI was based on the Wald’s method. 
As regards non-vertebral fractures the incidence from the BA058-05-003 baseline to end of study 
BA058-05-005 was 19/469 patients (4.05%) in the abaloparatide / alendronate and 32/494 (6.48%) in 
the placebo / alendronate group; the risk reduction versus placebo (95% CI) was -2.43 (-5.33, 0.44; 
p=0.0928). 
The incidence non-vertebral fractures from the BA058-05-005 baseline to end of study BA058-05-005 
was 10/469 patients (2.13%) in the abaloparatide / alendronate and 15/494 (3.04%) in the placebo / 
alendronate group; the risk reduction versus placebo (95% CI) was -0.90 (-3.05, 1.21; p=0.3778). 
In study BA058-05-005 all patients were switched from abaloparatide or placebo to alendronate after 
the 30-day period following Month 18 (Day 540) in study BA058-05-003. After transition to 
alendronate at Month 19, further increases in BMD from the BA058-05-003 baseline were observed in

both the abaloparatide / alendronate and the placebo / alendronate group, at Months 25, 31, 37 and 
43 with statistically significant differences favouring abaloparatide / alendronate (p˂0.0001) at the 
total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine for all time-points. Mean percent BMD increases were 
generally greater in the placebo / alendronate group for total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine than 
in the abaloparatide / alendronate group, but were not statistically significant except at Month 24 for 
total hip (p=0.0025) and the lumbar spine at all time-points (p˂0.0001). 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
According to the applicant all clinical trials were conducted in compliance with GCP principles. Three 
inspection requests were adopted by the CHMP concerning the conduct of the single pivotal trial 
BA058-05-003, a routine (GCP/INS/2015/030) and two triggered requests (GCP/INS/2016/001 - 
GCP/INS/2016/013). The routine request covered three sites, while two triggered, unannounced GCP 
inspections were also requested and performed at three sites. 
In parallel and at the same time of the CHMP triggered inspections, the Czech competent authority 
conducted national GCP inspections at three sites.  
Due to the critical findings observed at two sites in Czech Republic, the inspectors concluded that the 
data from these sites cannot be reliable, and recommended to exclude them when assessing the 
marketing authorisation application. As a consequence, the CHMP has requested the applicant to 
exclude the data from these sites in the Czech Republic during the review of the marketing 
authorisation application for the purpose of the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of abaloparatide. 
The GCP related serious findings, leading to the exclusion of two study sites, reduced the total study 
population by 16% from 2463 to 2070 participants.  
The applicant has provided only one pivotal study powered to assess superiority of abaloparatide 
versus placebo in reducing the risk of occurrence of new vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women. 
The effect of abaloparatide on the occurrence of new non-vertebral fracture was included as a 
secondary endpoint and no data from a separate study to assess the efficacy of abaloparatide on non-
vertebral fractures are available.  
In general the ‘Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products in the treatment of primary 
osteoporosis’ (CPMP/EWP/552/95, rev. 2) requests that the efficacy of an anti-osteoporotic drug should 
be tested for both the effect on vertebral as well as on non-vertebral fractures in separate studies. 
Although one pivotal study might be acceptable if the effect on the secondary endpoint non-vertebral 
fractures is undisputable, adherence to requirements set out in the guideline on one pivotal study is 
essential (e.g. statistical evidence considerably stronger than p<0.05, narrow confidence intervals, 
pre-specified alternative analyses for demonstration of consistency). Furthermore, in line with the 
CHMP guideline on osteoporosis the duration of treatment in the pivotal phase 3 trial for a new 
osteoporotic medicinal product should in general be at least 24 months in order to provide clear 
fracture and bone safety data; a total duration of 18 months of treatment in the provided phase 3 
study is thus limiting the extrapolation of the results. The applicant argues that the combined study 
BA058-05-003 (18 months abaloparatide versus teriparatide and placebo) and the interim data of its 
extension BA058-05-005 covering 6 months of alendronate treatment in patients on either 
abaloparatide or placebo but not those on teriparatide in the base study satisfies the requirement for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 78/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
24-months of fracture assessment data. It is further stated that abaloparatide is a rapid acting 
anabolic agent with an early onset of fracture prevention and that the 18-month duration of study 
BA058-05-003 is consistent with the final study designs and results of overall treatment exposures in 
the pivotal phase 3 studies for EU approved teriparatide and rhPTH(1-84). The chosen design will allow 
for accruing 24 months of data, but has several deficiencies, among them that patients on teriparatide 
have not been offered to participate in the extension study and that the continuation in the extension 
study might introduce a selection bias to the data beyond 18 month of treatment. 
In general, the primary efficacy endpoint of vertebral fractures is acceptable. However, the analysis of 
the primary endpoint was based on the mITT population excluding patients without post-baseline 
radiologic assessment. A substantial proportion of randomised patients were excluded from the mITT 
population. Although radiologic assessment was planned according to protocol when a patient 
discontinued treatment, post-baseline radiologic assessment was not available for 344 patients, which 
is mainly explained by non-repetition of scan for early drop-outs to limit radiation exposure, and by 
patient's refusal. Differential, treatment-related drop-out was observed and drop-out was probably the 
most important reason for missing radiologic data. Consequently, differences between treatment 
groups with regard to observed and unobserved baseline characteristics were not attributable to 
chance alone and resulting bias cannot be excluded. 
Furthermore, the mITT population includes drop-outs whose post-baseline radiological assessment was 
probably performed at time of dropout. This implies that the time in study and at risk of vertebral 
fracture differed between patients in the mITT population, and 18 month incidence of vertebral fracture 
may have been underestimated. The proportion of patients included in the primary mITT analysis with 
a spine x-ray taken at early termination / prior to month 18 was similar between abaloparatide and 
placebo groups, 11.9% and 11.0%, respectively, but smaller in the teriparatide group, 8.2%. The 
time-point for early termination / last post-baseline assessment did however differ between 
abaloparatide and both control groups; more patients in the abaloparatide group had the last spine x-
ray taken at an earlier time-point. This is in line with the overall pattern of time to withdrawal, which 
shows that discontinuations occurred earlier in the abaloparatide group compared to placebo or 
teriparatide groups. More patients having last spine x-ray at an earlier time point in the mITT 
population slightly favours abaloparatide but additional sensitivity analyses requested by the CHMP 
address this issue. 
Additionally, as the mITT analysis includes only on-treatment data it aims at estimation of the 
treatment effect if all patients had been fully adherent to randomised treatment until end of month 18; 
however, the treatment effect assuming loss of benefit after discontinuation of treatment is also 
relevant for the B/R evaluation in this context.  
The sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation based on the ITT population provided by the 
applicant is acknowledged. Not including treatment as a factor in the imputation model implies the 
assumption that the risk of vertebral fracture for patients with missing data is the same in all 
treatment groups (conditional on covariates), and that this risk is approximately the average risk in 
patients with non-missing data over all treatment groups. This assumption leads to a more 
conservative analysis than the primary analysis, which is appreciated. However, the treatment effect 
which is targeted by this analysis is not clear. Therefore, a placebo multiple imputation (pMI) analysis 
was requested to be performed replacing missing values for patients without outcome data similarly as 
in the sensitivity analysis but using a logistic regression model based only on placebo completers; this 
analysis aims at the treatment effect assuming loss of benefit after treatment drop-out, conditional on 
covariates.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 79/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis performed by the applicant did not replace values for patients in 
the mITT population who discontinued the study. Therefore, an ITT-based analysis replacing values of 
all drop-outs without vertebral fracture, including those with post-baseline evaluable radiologic 
assessment before month 18, using pMI, was requested to be performed, and an analysis where 
values for drop-outs without vertebral fracture are replaced based on pMI but considering the risk of 
vertebral fracture as proportional to the time after drop-out.  
The sensitivity analyses that were requested were performed and generally support the primary 
outcome showing clinically relevant and statistically significant superiority to placebo although 
treatment effects are reduced as expected for analyses addressing the treatment effect assuming loss 
of benefit after discontinuation from treatment. The sensitivity analyses were also repeated excluding 
data from two sites from the Czech Republic.  
Additionally, ITT-based tipping point analyses were requested to be performed, i.e. the number of 
vertebral fractures in the abaloparatide group in patients without outcome data and all dropouts should 
be determined that would have changed the conclusion with regard to statistical significance, which 
confirmed that conclusions would have changed only under extreme assumptions.  
As regards the analyses of the key secondary endpoint non-vertebral fractures it has to be taken into 
account that this should have preferably been tested in a separate study (see above) and that since 
instead only one pivotal study has been provided, the effect of abaloparatide on the secondary 
endpoint non-vertebral fractures should be undisputable (statistical evidence considerably stronger 
than p<0.05; precise estimates of the treatment effects, i.e. narrow confidence intervals; pre-specified 
alternative analyses for demonstration of consistency). The CHMP recommendation to define vertebral 
fractures and non-vertebral fracture in this one pivotal study as co-primary endpoints was not 
followed, but for the key secondary endpoint confirmatory testing was performed within a hierarchical 
testing procedure to control the family-wise type 1 error (see also section on benefit/risk regarding the 
conclusions from the secondary endpoint analysis). 
The analysis of this key secondary endpoint non-vertebral fracture was changed from comparison of 
event rates to an analysis of time to non-vertebral fracture in the statistical analysis plan that was 
finalised two days prior to database lock; usually, it is expected that changes to principle features of 
the analysis are documented in a protocol amendment rather than only in the statistical analysis plan. 
Furthermore, changes to analyses were introduced after database lock, including changes of the 
definitions of the primary and the key secondary endpoints and change of analysis from MMRM to 
ANCOVA for continuous secondary endpoints, which according to the applicant was done following US 
FDA advice. In the analysis of non-vertebral fracture applying time to event analysis (i.e. time to first 
non-vertebral fracture was analysed) non-informative censoring is assumed, which implies the 
assumption that the risk of non-vertebral fracture for a patient after drop-out is the same as the risk of 
a patient who continues the study. This means that the analysis addresses the treatment effect that 
would be observed when all patients would be adherent to study treatment until end of month 19.  
However, the treatment effect assuming loss of benefit after active treatment discontinuation is more 
relevant for the benefit-risk evaluation in this context. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis with imputation 
of patients censored before month 19 based on the time to event distribution in placebo patients was 
requested and showed smaller differences between abaloparatide and placebo as expected; the same 
sensitivity analysis was also performed excluding the GCP non-compliant study sites.  
As regards the hierarchical approach for testing the multiple hypotheses on the primary and the 
secondary efficacy endpoints different information can be found for the endpoints 6, 7, and 9 
concerning effects of abaloparatide versus teriparatide on BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and

lumbar spine; while the statistical analysis plan ‘Fixed-sequence Tests of the Primary and the 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints for Multiple Comparisons’ defines the comparison at 6 months as 
confirmatory and comparisons at 12 and 18 months as exploratory, other sections of the statistical 
analysis report, the final clinical study report, and the study protocol refer only to the 18 months 
comparison while the 6 and 12 months comparisons are not mentioned at all. In this assessment the 
effects after 18 months of treatment are described and discussed first and the effect after 6 and 12 
months are included in the ancillary analyses. BMD was analysed by ANCOVA (LOCF) and MMRM. 
However, the treatment effect that is targeted by ANCOVA (LOCF) is not clear; it is neither the effect 
that would be observed if all patients would be fully adherent to treatment, nor the effect that would 
be observed if loss of benefit from active treatment after treatment drop-out is taken into account. 
MMRM analysis addresses the treatment effect if all patients would have been fully adherent. Additional 
analyses assuming loss of treatment benefit after drop-out were requested; a placebo multiple 
imputation analysis supported the results of the original analysis. In a responder analysis considering 
missing data as non-response, statistically significant superiority of abaloparatide over placebo was 
observed but the difference was smaller than for observed cases due to higher drop-out in the 
abaloparatide group.  
Radiographs were viewed and assessed centrally by a blinded, independent radiologist and confirmed 
by a second blinded radiologist for all patients for whom an incident fracture had been identified. In 
case of disagreement a third consensus assessment was made to adjudicate the incident fracture. 
BMD scans for patient eligibility were determined at the study site; acceptability of each DXA scan was 
subsequently confirmed with the study sites by the Central Imaging CRO. Investigators were blinded to 
results of all follow-up DXA scans throughout the study unless a safety issue was identified by the 
independent radiologist.  
The active comparator teriparatide was not blinded due to commercial availability of teriparatide, but 
the blind has been adequately maintained between abaloparatide and placebo throughout the study 
and randomised distribution to study arms was double-blind. Thus blinding is acceptable as regards the 
comparisons of abaloparatide versus placebo. However, for the analysis of differences in effects 
between teriparatide and abaloparatide as well teriparatide and placebo it has to be considered that 
patients and physicians have been aware of the treatment applied in patients on teriparatide. 
Discontinuation and the percentage of patients with no post-treatment x-ray were significantly 
different between groups; discontinuation was highest with abaloparatide and lowest with teriparatide 
and the percentage of patients with no post-treatment x-ray was higher in patients on abaloparatide 
compared to both placebo and teriparatide. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Data from the dose-finding study BA058-05-002 indicate that doses of 20 µg, 40 µg, and 80 µg 
abaloparatide SC induced a dose dependent increase in percent change in BMD at lumbar spine, total 
hip, and femoral neck, while no differences were seen at ultra-distal wrist; the largest increase in BMD 
was noted for abaloparatide 80 µg SC. This dose-response relationship was also confirmed for serum 
markers s-P1NP, s-BALP, and s-OC. Thus the available data support the dose of 80 µg abaloparatide 
selected for the pivotal phase 3 trial. 
In the pivotal study BA058-05-003 demographic and baseline disease characteristics were adequately 
balanced between groups. Calculation of the 10 year fracture probability has also been provided and 
the results are considered to apply with recommendations set out in the CHMP guideline on 
osteoporosis.

The percentage of discontinuation was different between groups; it was lowest in the teriparatide 
group were patients were aware of the assigned medication and highest in patients on abaloparatide. 
In addition the highest percentage of discontinuation due to AEs occurred with abaloparatide and the 
percentage of patients with no post-treatment x-ray was higher in patients on abaloparatide compared 
to both placebo and teriparatide.  
The predefined primary endpoint, new vertebral fractures after 18 months of abaloparatide versus 
placebo, was met and the reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures (abaloparatide 0.51% 
vs placebo 4.2%) is considered clinically relevant. The analysis of the PP population as well as the 
sensitivity analysis support the assumption that after 18 month of treatment abaloparatide is superior 
to placebo as regards the incidence of new vertebral fractures but interpretation of the results is 
limited by the difference in discontinuation and the percentage of patients having a post-treatment x-
ray; a potential bias cannot be excluded. Additional sensitivity analyses have been provided.   
As regards the key secondary efficacy endpoint non-vertebral fractures after 18 months the 
prolongation of the time to first incident non-vertebral fracture with abaloparatide versus placebo was 
not statistically significant (p=0.3675) and confidence intervals were wide.  
Considering that study BA058-05-003 was the only pivotal trial in this application these results are not 
able to establish an advantage of abaloparatide versus placebo on non-vertebral fractures after 18 
months of treatment although the available data indicate a trend in favour of abaloparatide. The study 
did not show statistical evidence considerably stronger than p<0.05 nor did it demonstrate the 
required narrow confidence intervals. 
The comparison of non-vertebral fractures after 18 months for abaloparatide versus teriparatide was 
not statistically significant (p=0.4919) and the reduction in the hazard ratio was accompanied by wide 
confidence intervals. Non-vertebral fractures occurred in 15/696 (2.2%) patients on abaloparatide vs 
12/686 (1.7%) patients on teriparatide.  Any differences may well be attributable to chance. 
Furthermore, the scale of the y-axis leads to the visual impression of relatively large differences while 
the absolute differences are relatively small and attributable to a small number of events. Therefore, 
although visually different, differences between the curves may well be attributable to chance. 
As regards the additional key secondary efficacy endpoints BMD the percent changes at total hip, 
femoral neck, and lumbar spine from baseline to 18-month were statistically significantly higher with 
abaloparatide compared to placebo and results demonstrate a relevant increase in BMD in patients on 
abaloparatide. Increases in BMD after 18 months of treatment were also greater for abaloparatide 
compared to teriparatide at the total hip and femoral neck but not at the lumbar spine; teriparatide 
increased BMD from baseline to 18 months at all three sites. BMD decreased with placebo at all three 
sites.  
After 6 months of treatment patients on abaloparatide showed higher increases in BMD at the total hip, 
femoral neck, and lumbar spine than those on teriparatide, but these numerical differences are not 
considered clinically relevant and it has not been shown that they relate to a clinically relevant 
reduction in fracture risks. 
The responder analysis of change in BMD showed that the percentage of patients with BMD changes 
˃0%, ˃3%, and ˃6% at lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip combined was significantly higher 
with abaloparatide than with placebo and also higher than in patients on teriparatide.  
The percent change in BMD at the distal 1/3 radius, ultra-distal radius, and total radius from baseline 
up to 18 months was heterogeneous. In all cases BMD decreased. At the distal 1/3 radius the decrease 
in BMD was lowest in participants receiving placebo and highest in those receiving teriparatide. At the 
ultra-distal radius bone mineral density increased from baseline to 6 months in all groups and declined 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 82/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thereafter at 12 and 18 months and BMD was lowest in subjects on placebo. At the total radius the 
percent change in BMD from baseline was higher for abaloparatide versus placebo at 6 months, but the 
difference became smaller at 12 and 18 months.  
The data on change in BMD by baseline renal status indicate that at least the lumbar spine and 
probably the femoral neck increases in BMD with abaloparatide were higher in patients with reduced 
creatinine clearance compared to patients with normal creatinine clearance. This effect might be due to 
an increase in abaloparatide exposure following reduced renal elimination of abaloparatide.  
There were minimal numerical differences in change and percent change in vertical height between 
groups but differences were neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant. 
The percentage of patients with severe incident new or worsening vertebral fractures was lower with 
abaloparatide and teriparatide than with placebo. 
Teriparatide also showed a significant reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures compared 
to placebo and both abaloparatide and teriparatide reduced the incidence of new or worsening 
vertebral fractures versus placebo after 18 months of therapy. 
The time to first incidence of other fractures defined as clinical fracture, major osteoporotic fracture, 
wrist fracture, non-vertebral fracture including any level of trauma, and clinical spine fracture was 
prolonged with abaloparatide compared to placebo and patients on abaloparatide had fewer non-
vertebral fractures including all trauma levels and were fracture-free longer, and the time to first 
clinical spine fracture was prolonged and the incidence lower with abaloparatide versus placebo. Time 
to first incidence of other fractures was also numerically increased for abaloparatide compared to 
teriparatide but differences were mostly not statistically significant and are not considered clinically 
relevant. 
As regards the percent changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover the increase in the anabolic 
serum bone marker s-P1NP was higher for abaloparatide versus placebo at all time-points, while the 
increase with teriparatide was higher than with abaloparatide from 3 months onwards. The bone 
resorption marker s-CTX showed a transient increase for abaloparatide versus placebo from 3 to 12 
months and increases in s-CTX were highest with teriparatide. Activities of BALP and s-OC were higher 
with abaloparatide versus placebo and highest in participants using teriparatide. 
Analyses of new vertebral fracture, non-vertebral fracture, and BMD by subgroups including age, 
ethnicity, region, and risk at baseline did not indicate an interaction between treatment and the 
majority of subgroups investigated and Forest plots showed effects to be in the same direction for 
these analyses. Divergent results were seen for non-vertebral fracture in the subgroups Asian race and 
Asia region, for BMD at the total hip in the subgroup North America, and for BMD at the femoral neck 
in subgroups Black race, North America, and ‘prevalence of vertebral fracture at baseline ≥2 fracture’ 
but confidence intervals overlapped, the number of events was small, and there were too few patients 
in these subgroups to draw any conclusions.  
The FRAX analysis of the data from study BA058-05-003 indicates that the estimated baseline fracture 
probabilities were low compared to several other phase 3 studies in patients with osteoporosis but for 
example similar to that seen in clinical trials of bazedoxifene, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator 
approved in 2009 in the EU for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Fracture probabilities 
increased with age. Baseline characteristics of fracture probabilities for patients recruited to the 
extension study BA058-05-005 did not differ from the population of study BA058-05-003 and there 
were no relevant differences between those who continued and those who did not.

Abaloparatide significantly reduced the incidence of all three clinical fracture outcomes in patients with 
probabilities at baseline that fell above the thresholds given in the CHMP guideline on osteoporosis (10-
year probability for spine fracture 15% to 20%, for hip fracture 5% to 7.5%, for major non-vertebral 
fracture 10% to 15%) and hazard ratios for the effect of abaloparatide on the various fracture 
outcomes did not change significantly across the range of baseline fracture probability, suggesting 
significant efficacy over the whole range. There was, however, a trend for the efficacy to increase with 
higher baseline major osteoporotic fracture probability; significant anti-fracture efficacy was 
demonstrated in patients deemed at high risk according to the CHMP guideline on osteoporosis. At 
equivalent fracture probability percentiles, the treatment effect of abaloparatide was greater on 
vertebral fracture risk than on the risk of clinical fractures at other sites; findings were robust to 
several sensitivity analyses. 
With the exception of phase 2 study BA058-05-011 in male and female volunteers with renal 
impairment no data from clinical studies in special populations have been submitted. For the pivotal 
trial BA058-05-003 subgroups analyses including the effect of age on abaloparatide efficacy have been 
provided; age groups investigated were <65 years, 65 to <75 years, and ≥75 years. The majority of 
patients in the pivotal trial BA058-05-003 were in the age range of 65 to 74 years of age; about 18% 
to 20% percent of the treated population was ≥75 years of age at baseline and only 4 patients were 
≥85 years of age (0.2%).  
The applicant has only provided data from one pivotal trial and its extension. Thus no relevant pooled 
analyses or meta-analysis have been submitted.  
The data from the supportive extension trial BA058-05-005 in general support the findings of the 
pivotal trial; patients who were either on abaloparatide or placebo, but not those on teriparatide, in the 
base study BA058-05-003 and who finished the base study were offered to participate and received 
open-label alendronate 70 mg once weekly.  
For the primary endpoint incidence of new vertebral fractures (mITT) from study BA058-05-003 
baseline to Month 25 of study BA058-05-005 (18 months double-blind abaloparatide or placebo study 
BA058-05-003, 1 month follow-up, 24 months alendronate study BA058-05-005) 4/457 patients 
(0.88%) in the abaloparatide / alendronate group and 26/489 (5.32%) in the placebo / alendronate 
experienced new vertebral fractures; the risk reduction versus placebo (95% CI) was -4.44 (-6.86, 
-2.30; p<0.0001). New vertebral fractures from BA058-05-005 baseline occurred in 0/457 patients 
(0%) on abaloparatide / alendronate and 6/489 (1.23%) on placebo / alendronate at Month 6 [risk 
reduction versus placebo (95% CI) -1.23 (-2.65, -0.16; p=0.0313)] and 2/457 (0.44%) and 13/489 
(2.66%), respectively, at Month 24 [risk reduction versus placebo (95% CI) -2.22 (-4.08, -0.64; 
p=0.0074)].  
As regards non-vertebral fractures the incidence from the BA058-05-003 baseline to end of study 
BA058-05-005 was 19/469 patients (4.05%) on abaloparatide / alendronate and 32/494 (6.48%) on 
placebo / alendronate [risk reduction versus placebo (95% CI) -2.43 (-5.33, 0.44; p=0.0928)] and 
from BA058-05-005 baseline incidences were 10/469 patients (2.13%) on abaloparatide / alendronate 
and 15/494 (3.04%) on placebo / alendronate [risk reduction versus placebo (95% CI) -0.90 (-3.05, 
1.21; p=0.3778)]. 
Further increases in BMD from the BA058-05-003 baseline were observed in both the abaloparatide / 
alendronate and the placebo / alendronate group, at Months 25, 31, 37 and 43 with statistically 
significant differences favouring abaloparatide / alendronate (p˂0.0001) at the total hip, femoral neck, 
and lumbar spine for all time-points. Mean percent BMD increases were generally greater in the 
placebo / alendronate group for total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine than in the abaloparatide /

alendronate group, but were not statistically significant except at Month 24 for total hip (p=0.0025) 
and the lumbar spine at all time-points (p˂0.0001). 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
In the pivotal trial, abaloparatide administered at a dose of 80 µg SC daily over up to 18 months 
significantly reduced the risk of experiencing new vertebral fractures compared to placebo. Teriparatide 
as comparator also showed a significant reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures compared 
to placebo. 
A significant and clinically relevant efficacy of abaloparatide compared to placebo on non-vertebral 
fractures has not been established and there was no significant difference between abaloparatide and 
teriparatide on the time to first incidence of non-vertebral fracture. Only one hip fracture (on placebo) 
occurred in the study. 
The percent changes in BMD at total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine from baseline to 18-month 
were statistically significantly higher with abaloparatide compared to placebo and results demonstrate 
a relevant increase in BMD in patients on abaloparatide. There were no relevant differences in BMD 
after 18 months of treatment between abaloparatide and teriparatide except for ultra-distal radius. 
BMD decreased with placebo at all sites.  
Data on change in BMD by baseline renal status indicate that increases in BMD with abaloparatide are 
higher in patients with reduced creatinine clearance compared to patients with normal creatinine 
clearance; this effect might be due to an increase in abaloparatide exposure due to reduced renal 
elimination. 
Percent changes in the anabolic serum bone marker s-P1NP were higher for abaloparatide versus 
placebo at all time-points, while the increase with teriparatide was higher than with abaloparatide from 
3 months onwards. The bone resorption marker s-CTX showed a transient increase for abaloparatide 
versus placebo from 3 to 12 months and increases in s-CTX were highest with teriparatide. Activities of 
BALP and s-osteocalcin were higher with abaloparatide versus placebo and highest in participants using 
teriparatide. 
Analyses of new vertebral fracture, non-vertebral fracture, and BMD by subgroups including age, 
ethnicity, region, and risk at baseline did not indicate a clinically relevant interaction between 
treatment and these subgroups.  
The FRAX analysis of the data from study BA058-05-003 indicate that the estimated baseline fracture 
probabilities were low compared to several other phase 3 studies in patients with osteoporosis but for 
example similar to that seen in clinical trials of bazedoxifene. Fracture probabilities increased with age. 
Baseline characteristics of fracture probabilities for patients recruited to the extension study BA058-05-
005 did not differ from the population of study BA058-05-003 and there were no relevant differences 
between those who continued and those who did not. Hazard ratios for the effect of abaloparatide on 
the various fracture outcomes did not change significantly across the range of baseline fracture 
probability, suggesting significant efficacy over the whole range. There was however a trend for the 
efficacy to increase with higher baseline major osteoporotic fracture probability and at equivalent 
fracture probability percentiles, the treatment effect of abaloparatide was greater on vertebral fracture 
risk than on the risk of clinical fractures at other sites. 
Patients who were either on abaloparatide or placebo, but not those on teriparatide, in the base study 
BA058-05-003 and who finished the base study were offered to participate and received open-label

alendronate 70 mg once weekly in the supportive extension trial BA058-05-005; the data from this 
trial in general support the findings of the pivotal trial.  
Overall, efficacy regarding radiological new vertebral fractures was demonstrated, however, the pivotal 
study failed to demonstrate a statistically significant efficacy on non-vertebral fractures vs placebo. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety data are primarily derived from up to 18 month of treatment with abaloparatide compared to 
placebo and teriparatide in postmenopausal osteoporotic women in the pivotal phase 3 trial BA058-05-
003. Data from extension study BA058-05-005 only derives safety data after abaloparatide 
discontinuation since all patients participating were switched to alendronate. 
In study BA058-05-003, 694 patients received abaloparatide 80 µg SC daily and 507 (73%) completed 
18 months of exposure, while on teriparatide 546 out of 686 (80%) and on placebo 531 out of 687 
(77%) completed the trial. In studies BA058-05-003, BA058-05-002, and BA058-05-007 together 876 
subjects received 80 µg abaloparatide daily.  
The difference in patients completing trial BA058-05-003 is also evident in the mean (±SD) exposure, 
15.0 (±6.0) months on abaloparatide, 15.55 (±5.3) on teriparatide, and 15.8 (±5.1) on placebo. 
Patients on abaloparatide dropped out early, with drop-out ≤1 month and >1 month to ≤3 months 
being 7.9% and 3.8% on abaloparatide, respectively and 3.9% and 3.6% on teriparatide, respectively.

Overall, the extent and duration of exposure is adequate to assess the safety of abaloparatide, but for 
rare events, as well as for the assessment of carcinogenicity, adequate post-licensing safety data is 
needed (see risk management plan section). 
Adverse events 
In the analysis by system organ class relevant differences were seen for ‘cardiac disorders’ with 12%, 
6%, and 5%, respectively on abaloparatide, teriparatide, and placebo, and ‘nervous system disorders’ 
with 25%, 20%, and 20%, respectively.  
The adverse events palpitations (abaloparatide, teriparatide, placebo: 5.6%, 1.7%, 0.4%), nausea 
(8.5%, 5.4%, 3.1%), and dizziness (11.1%, 8.2%, 7.1%) occurred with a higher frequency in patients 
treated with abaloparatide compared with those receiving teriparatide or placebo; no long term clinical 
sequelae were reported in association with palpitations, nausea, or dizziness and no reports of falls in 
association with dizziness. The adverse event dizziness appeared to show a dose-response effect with 
0%, 9%, and 11% in patients treated with abaloparatide 20 μg, 40 μg, and 80 μg, respectively, and 
4% on both teriparatide and placebo. The higher frequency of abaloparatide in the SOC ‘cardiac 
disorders’ was mainly driven by the increased rate of palpitations.  
Hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria occurred less frequently in patients on abaloparatide than on 
teriparatide but more often than on placebo.

a) A transdermal placebo was administered. 
In general the highest incidence of adverse events by system organ class occurred with an onset 
between 0 to ˂2 months; in the system organ classes ‘cardiac disorders’, ‘gastrointestinal disorders’, 
‘nervous system disorders’, and ‘renal and urinary disorders’ the incidence of adverse events was 
higher in patients on abaloparatide compared to teriparatide and placebo, but decreased during the 18 
months study duration and differences were no longer apparent from 6 months onwards. In the 
system organ class ‘cardiac disorders’ the difference was primarily driven by palpitations, in the system 
organ class ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ by nausea, and in the system organ class ‘nervous system 
disorders’ by dizziness and headache. Frequencies in the system organ class ‘renal and urinary 
disorders’ were driven by hypercalciuria but the frequency of this adverse event was heterogeneous 
over the 18 months study duration.

The diminishing differences in frequency of adverse events in the system organ classes ‘cardiac 
disorders’, ‘gastrointestinal disorders’, and ‘nervous system disorders’ might be attributable to the 
differential drop-out between treatment groups; fewer patients on abaloparatide than on either 
teriparatide or placebo completed the 18 months trial BA058-05-003 and patients on abaloparatide 
dropped out earlier than on teriparatide or placebo.  
Around 80% of adverse events were considered mild to moderate and the frequencies were 
comparable between treatment groups. Frequencies of severe adverse events were too low for a 
reliable comparison between groups. 
The analyses of adverse events considered related to treatment by the investigators are in line with 
the analyses of adverse events independent of the relation to treatment. 
In the analysis of the data from the follow-up study BA058-05-005 there were no relevant differences 
between patients previously treated with abaloparatide and those previously treated with placebo. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of hypercalcaemia occurred less frequently in patients treated with abaloparatide than 
those treated with teriparatide but more often than those treated with placebo. In study BA058-05-003 
hypercalcaemia AEs occurred more often on teriparatide (4.8%) than abaloparatide (2.2%) or placebo 
(0.6%). Severe or serious hypercalcaemia AEs were reported for no patient on abaloparatide or 
placebo compared to 1 (0.1%) serious AE considered related to treatment on teriparatide. The 
percentage of patients who discontinued treatment due to hypercalcaemia AEs was numerically higher 
on teriparatide (0.6%) compared to abaloparatide (0.3%). There was no evidence of an increase in the 
incidence of hypercalcaemia with increasing doses of abaloparatide in study BA058-05-002.  
The incidence of hypercalciuria was lower in patients on abaloparatide than on teriparatide but higher 
than on placebo. In study BA058-05-003 the incidence of hypercalciuria AEs was lower on 
abaloparatide (14.3%) than on teriparatide (17.6%); it was higher than in the placebo group (11.1%). 
No patient on abaloparatide or on placebo experienced a severe or serious hypercalciuria AE while for 1 
patient (0.1%) on teriparatide a serious AE hypercalciuria considered related to treatment was 
reported. The number of patients who discontinued treatment due to hypercalciuria AEs was higher in 
the teriparatide than in the abaloparatide group (0.6% vs. 0.1%); no patient on placebo discontinued 
due to a hypercalciuria AE. 
The analyses of adverse events of renal impairment did not reveal significant differences between 
abaloparatide, teriparatide, and placebo groups. 
The incidences of orthostatic hypotension, defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 
≥20 mmHg from supine to standing or in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥10 mmHg from supine to 
standing in a post-dose blood pressure measurement, as well as palpitations, nausea, and dizziness 
were higher on abaloparatide, than teriparatide or placebo and the percentage of subjects who 
discontinued treatment due to orthostatic hypotension defined as a composite AESI was higher on 
abaloparatide compared to teriparatide and placebo. Orthostatic hypotension occurred in 28.4% of 
patients on abaloparatide, 19.8% on teriparatide, and 14.4% on placebo. The percentage of patients 
reporting serious orthostatic hypotension AEs was low and comparable between groups (0.3%, 0.6%, 
and 0.3% on abaloparatide, teriparatide, and placebo, respectively). The percentage of subjects who 
discontinued treatment due to orthostatic hypotension defined as a AESI was 3.6%, 1.7%, and 0.9% 
on abaloparatide, teriparatide, and placebo, respectively. The applicant argues that the increased 
incidence in orthostatic hypotension is due to an increase in heart rate post injection versus placebo

leading to an increased incidence of palpitations, dizziness, and nausea. This mechanistic consideration 
seems unconvincing; moreover, a comparable increase in heart rate was seen in patients treated with 
teriparatide.

(Study 003 Safety Population, excluding the two sites from the Czech Republic) 
Besides a post-injection increase in heart rate compared to placebo evaluations of electrocardiograms 
did not indicate clinically relevant changes. 
The bone biopsy analysis did not indicate a pathological effect of abaloparatide on bone parameters, 
but histomorphometry also did not show evidence of bone anabolic effects by abaloparatide or 
teriparatide questioning the sensitivity of the analysis.  
The analysis of renal CT-scans in a subset of patients from study BA058-05-003 to assess kidney 
calcification did not reveal an increased incidence of calculi with abaloparatide.  
No clinically relevant differences across treatment groups in local tolerance events for pain, swelling, or 
tenderness were reported in patient diaries from study BA058-05-003. Redness was slightly more 
often reported in the teriparatide than in the abaloparatide group, but teriparatide was applied open-
label limiting the validity of the comparison.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
As regards deaths and serious adverse events the analyses did not indicate clinically relevant 
differences between groups. In the 18 months pivotal phase 3 study BA058-05-003, 3 deaths occurred 
in patients on placebo and on abaloparatide each and 2 on teriparatide; none of these deaths were 
considered related to study medication.  
During the first 6 months of study BA058-05-005 there was 1 death in a patient switched from 
abaloparatide and overall there were 2 additional AEs leading to death, 1 each in the placebo / 
alendronate and abaloparatide / alendronate group; none of these deaths were considered related to 
study medication. However, numbers are too small for a final assessment of differences in the 
incidence of death and serious adverse events possibly attributable to abaloparatide. 
In the first 6 months of the follow-up study BA058-05-005, 5 events (brain neoplasm, colon cancer, 
intestinal adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, renal cancer) were reported in the SOC ‘neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps)’ in patients previously on abaloparatide 
versus none in patients previously on placebo; however this difference was not seen at later points 
during the trial.  
Laboratory findings 
Clinical chemistry 
The percentage of patients with uric acid above upper normal limit was lower in the abaloparatide than 
in the teriparatide group, but increased compared to placebo. Levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, 25-
hydroxyvitamin D, and PTH intact were also increased in line with the therapeutic effect of 
abaloparatide. 
Vital signs 
Vital sign measures included blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), body temperature and respiration 
rate. By end of treatment vital sign values were similar to baseline values and without notable 
differences between treatment groups. As discussed elsewhere in the report abaloparatide and 
teriparatide showed a marked increase in heart rate post injection versus placebo where no notable 
changes were seen.  
Electrocardiograms in Study 003 and thorough QTC study  
In study BA058-05-003, ECGs were performed pre-dose and 1 hour post-dose at regular intervals 
during the first year of the study (over 6 visits). The baseline heart rate was measured at rest and the 
change in HR was determined relative to any of the 1-hour post-dose measurements when subjects 
were active during the 6 visits.  
Table 21 below summarises the heart rate data at baseline and post-injection assessments.

Table 21 Study BA058-05-003. Heart rate at baseline and post-injection at Day 1, Month 1, 
Month 3 and Month 12 
Abaloparatide and teriparatide markedly increased heart rate post injection versus placebo. The mean 
increase from baseline in the abaloparatide group was stable and ranged (from Day 1 to month 12) 
between 6.9 and 7.8 bpm. For teriparatide the increase in heart rate post-dose was lower and ranged 
5.5 to 6.7 bpm from Day 1 to month 12 during this period. The number of observations decreases over 
time. Study discontinuations due to palpitations may have contributed to this loss of observations 
which may have led to an underestimation of the mean increase in heart rate post-injection. For 
placebo, the mean increase post-injection was 1.0 to 1.9 bpm. Pre-injection heart rate values were 
similar to baseline values for all time points in all three groups. Overall, 7.9%, 3.6%, and 0.7% of 
patients on abaloparatide, teriparatide, and placebo, respectively, had an increase in heart rate 
>25 bpm at any visit. 
Thorough QTC study 
In addition to assessment of ECG parameters in phase I studies 127-001, 001, 001B, 010, and 011, a 
thorough QTC study (study BA058-05-012) in 48 male and female healthy volunteers has been 
performed. In study 012, two different doses of abaloparatide were tested and compared with placebo 
and a positive control (moxifloxacin 400 µg orally). The table below summarizes the heart rate data 
(changes vs. baseline) for abaloparatide and placebo, including the mean difference in heart rate, up to 
24 hours. Subjects were requested to stay in a supine position. Meal and moderate activity were 
allowed after the first 4 hours.

In this single-injection study, abaloparatide caused a dose-related increase of heart rate, which peaked 
at 15 -30 min (the first two post-dosing assessment) with maximal mean increases of 15 bpm and 
20 bpm after dosing of 80 µg and 240 µg, respectively. The maximum increase in an individual 
subject in the abaloparatide 80 µg group was seen at 1 hour post-dose with 39.3 bpm. The mean 
increase 1 hour post-dose (9.5 bpm) in the abaloparatide 80 µg group was somewhat higher than in 
study BA058-05-003. Significant increases in heart rate persisted at least 12 hours (mean 9.5 bpm)  in 
the QT study. However, elevations were seen also in the placebo group after 6 hours but still less than 
for abaloparatide. The heart rate had almost returned to baseline and was comparable to placebo at 24 
h, i.e. the proposed time point for the next injection in a clinical setting.  
The marked mean post-dose increase in heart rate observed in the thorough QT study and in study 
BA058-05-003 is of major concern. In addition, the pivotal study had extensive exclusion criteria based 
on ECG findings and medical history of cardiovascular disease. Adequate wording in the PI is needed to 
mitigate the risks of cardiovascular events associated with the marked increased heart rate in the 
general osteoporosis population where concomitant cardiovascular diseases are expected to be more 
common than in the pivotal study. 
According to the study protocol, the primary PD endpoint was the time-matched, placebo-adjusted 
change from baseline in QTcF (Fridericia). The protocol allowed for switch to the “individualised” 
method if certain criteria were fulfilled which included a slope >|0.045| of the linear regression of QTcF 
versus RR and 2/3 of the subjects have their individual linear regression slopes >|0.045|.

Using Fridericia´s correction, the largest placebo-corrected ∆QTcF was observed 30 min after dosing 
and reached 6.8 ms (90% CI: 4.5 to 9.2) and 9.6 ms (90% CI: 7.3 to 12.0) in the 80 µg and 240 µg 
group, respectively. For the 80 µg dose of abaloparatide, using Fridericia´s correction, the study 
fulfilled the criterion for a negative QT study with an upper bound just below 10 ms. The 240 µg dose 
resulted in an upper bound above 10 ms.  
When the “individualised” correction method was applied, the upper limit for the confidence interval on 
the corrected QT interval did not exceed 10 ms in either of the treatment groups. The largest placebo-
corrected ∆QTcI was observed 30 min after dosing and reached 5.3 ms (90% CI: 2.7 to 8.0) and 7.1 
ms (90% CI: 4.4 to 9.7) in the 80 µg and 240 µg group, respectively. Thus by using this method the 
study fulfilled the criterion for a negative QT study (according to ICH E14 guideline) for both doses.

In the analysis by age groups <65 years, 65 to <75 years, and ≥75 years the SOC ‘vascular disorders’ 
occurred with a higher frequency in the abaloparatide than in the placebo group and showed an age-
related trend; a higher percentage of patients ≥75 years of age in the abaloparatide group reported 
hypertension than in the teriparatide or placebo groups. 
Only 4 patients (0.2%) were ≥85 years of age, 1 patient on abaloparatide (85 years) and 3 patients on 
placebo (85 and 86 years). 
The analysis of ethnic subgroups is limited by the low number of subjects of other than Caucasian 
origin (about 80%); only a comparison of study participants of Asian or Caucasian origin has been 
provided and even numbers in the Asian subgroup are small. Thus no definite conclusions can be 
drawn of differences in safety of abaloparatide between ethnic groups. 
The percentage of patients who experienced adverse events was higher in Asian compared to 
Caucasian patients, but the pattern between treatment groups was comparable for the majority of 
adverse events. There was no difference in medical history or the average number of concomitant 
medication between the 2 groups, but Asian patients were slightly older and had lower body weight 
than Caucasian patients. The applicant claims that older age and lower body weight may partially 
explain the slightly higher incidence of AEs in Asian patients. The analyses of adverse events by body 
weight indicated a general decrease in the incidence of adverse events with increasing body weight, 
but analysis of adverse events by age showed no clear relationship of age with the incidence of 
adverse events. 
The system organ classes ‘cardiac disorders’ and ‘nervous system disorders’ were reported with a 
higher frequency in Asian compared to Caucasian patients and occurred more often with abaloparatide 
compared to teriparatide and placebo; preferred terms with this pattern were palpitation and dizziness, 
while no system organ class or preferred term were reported with a higher frequency in the 
abaloparatide versus the placebo group and with a lower frequency in Asian compared to Caucasian 
patients. 
As regards weight an analysis by subgroups <54 kg, 54 to <68 kg, and ≥68 kg has been provided. 
Overall, the percentage of subjects with adverse events considered related across these groups 
decreased with increasing weight. 
The incidence of hypercalcaemia adverse events increased with decreasing renal function in the 
teriparatide group (1.3%, 3.6% and 7.7% for the normal, mild and moderate renal impairment). In 
patients on abaloparatide with impaired renal function, i.e. subgroups with creatinine clearance ˂60

EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 101/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ml/min (moderate renal impairment) and 60 to ˂90 ml/min (mild impairment), the incidence of 
hypercalcaemia adverse events was higher (1.9% for both groups of mild and moderate renal 
impairment) compared to patients with normal renal function (0.6%). The incidence of hypercalcaemia 
as a laboratory assessment was similar between the subgroups with creatinine clearance ˂60 ml/min 
(moderate renal impairment) and 60 to ˂90 ml/min (mild renal impairment). No analysis of adverse 
events by baseline hepatic function is possible since no patient with baseline hepatic impairment was 
included in study BA058-05-003. 
No relationship between adverse events and current or previous tobacco use in the past 5 years before 
study entry in patients treated with abaloparatide has been identified. 
Immunological events 
The incidence of hypersensitivity adverse events was comparable between abaloparatide and 
teriparatide. 
During 18 months in study BA058-05-003 about half of the patients developed anti-abaloparatide 
antibodies and about one third showed neutralising antibodies. The number of patients with anti-
abaloparatide antibodies declined during the extension period in study BA058-05-005 when patients 
were treated with alendronate, about one quarter was still antibody positive after 6 months into the 
extension. 
Whether development of anti-abaloparatide antibodies results in a decrease in pharmacokinetics of 
abaloparatide is unclear due to deficiencies in the bioanalytical method.  
The limited data available did not indicate an influence of the development of anti-abaloparatide 
antibodies as well as neutralising antibodies on the efficacy or safety of abaloparatide. However, the 
high amount of patients developing anti-abaloparatide antibodies and neutralising antibodies is of 
concern since the limited data do not allow assessing the long-term effect of these antibodies on 
parathyroid hormone activity in humans. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Abaloparatide is a peptide with specific affinity to the parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTHR1) with no 
known affinity to PTHR2 or other molecular targets. Since there are no known secondary targets and 
no known effects on CYP induction or inhibition the likelihood of drug-drug interactions was considered 
low. Thus no formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed which is acceptable. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
The number of patients who discontinued treatment and the incidence of adverse events leading to 
study discontinuation was higher in patients treated with abaloparatide than those treated with 
teriparatide or placebo. Adverse event most frequently associated with discontinuation in patients on 
abaloparatide were nausea, dizziness, headache, and palpitations; dizziness and headache were also 
among the most frequent adverse events associated with discontinuation in the teriparatide group but 
frequencies were lower than in the abaloparatide group. There were no relevant differences between 
these groups in the occurrence of serious adverse events leading to discontinuation. During the follow-
up trial BA058-05-005 there were 1 severe adverse event of nausea in a patient previously on placebo 
and 4 severe adverse events in patients previously on abaloparatide including intestinal

adenocarcinoma  (subsequently revised to ovarian epithelial cancer) and brain tumour, leading to 
discontinuation.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data for abaloparatide were derived from 10 clinical trials, but are primarily based on the single 
pivotal trial BA058-05-003 with up to 18 months of exposure to abaloparatide compared to placebo 
and teriparatide. In the extension study BA058-05-005 participants were switched to alendronate.  
In the pivotal study BA058-05-003, 694 patients received abaloparatide 80 µg SC daily and 507 (73%) 
completed 18 months of exposure, while on teriparatide 546 out of 686 (80%) and on placebo 531 out 
of 687 (77%) completed the trial; patients on abaloparatide dropped out early, with drop-out ≤1 
month and >1 month to ≤3 months being 7.9% and 3.8% on abaloparatide, respectively and 3.9% 
and 3.6% on teriparatide, respectively. 
Overall, the extent and duration of exposure is adequate to assess the safety of abaloparatide, but for 
rare events, as well as for the assessment of carcinogenicity, adequate post-licensing safety data 
would be needed. 
In the analysis of adverse events by system organ class relevant differences were seen for ‘blood and 
lymphatic disorders’, ‘cardiac disorders’, and ‘nervous system disorders’ with higher frequencies on 
abaloparatide compared to teriparatide, and placebo; the higher frequency of abaloparatide in the 
system organ class ‘cardiac disorders’ was mainly driven by the increased rate of palpitations.  
In the pivotal study, the 1 hour post-dose HR increased more in abaloparatide treated patients 
compared to teriparatide. For example, 20% of patients treated with abaloparatide experienced a 
increase in HR by >20 bpm at any time point vs. 11% of patients treated with teriparatide and 3% of 
placebo patients. Patients that experienced highest increases in HR by >40 bpm (0.7%) were all in the 
abaloparatide group.  
Associated adverse events such as palpitations (6% vs. 2%), tachycardia (1.3% vs. 0.4%), dizziness 
(11% vs. 8%), nausea (9% vs. 5%) and discontinuations of study drug due to adverse events (10% vs 
7%) were also reported more frequently in patients treated with abaloparatide compared to 
teriparatide. There were more early (≤1 month) drop-outs in the abaloparatide arm (7.9%) compared 
to teriparatide (3.9%). 
There were a considerable number of adverse events in the system organ class ‘neoplasms benign, 
malignant and unspecified (17 (2.4%), 27 (3.9%), and 24 (3.5%) for abaloparatide, teriparatide, and 
placebo, respectively); further analysis did not reveal any significant findings.  
The adverse event dizziness appeared to show a dose-response effect in patients treated with 
abaloparatide. Hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria occurred less frequently in patients on abaloparatide 
than on teriparatide but more often than on placebo. 
The analyses of adverse events considered related to treatment by the investigators are in line with 
the analyses of adverse events independent of the relation to treatment. 
In the analysis of the data from the follow-up study BA058-05-005 in which patients were switched to 
alendronate no differences in adverse events were seen between patients previously treated with 
abaloparatide and those previously treated with placebo. 
In general the highest incidence of adverse events was seen within the first 2 months of treatment and 
differences in occurrence of adverse events were most pronounced in this time period; differences 
were no longer apparent from 6 months onwards. The diminishing differences in frequency of adverse 
events in the system organ classes ‘cardiac disorders’, ‘gastrointestinal disorders’, and ‘nervous system 
disorders’ might be attributable to the differential drop-out between treatment groups; fewer patients

on abaloparatide than on either teriparatide or placebo completed the 18 months trial BA058-05-003 
and patients on abaloparatide dropped out earlier than on teriparatide or placebo.  
Around 80% of adverse events were considered mild to moderate and the distribution of severity was 
comparable between treatment groups for mild to moderate adverse events; frequencies of severe 
adverse events were too low for a reliable comparison between groups. 
Adverse events of hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria occurred less frequently in patients treated with 
abaloparatide than those treated with teriparatide but more often than those treated with placebo. The 
limited data available did not indicate an increase in the incidence of adverse events of hypercalcaemia 
with increasing doses of abaloparatide. 
The analyses of adverse events of renal impairment did not reveal significant differences between 
abaloparatide, teriparatide, and placebo groups, but the incidence of hypercalcaemia adverse events 
was higher in the patients with impaired renal function in the abaloparatide and teriparatide groups. 
The percentage of subjects who discontinued treatment due to orthostatic hypotension defined as a 
composite adverse event of special interest was higher on abaloparatide compared to teriparatide and 
placebo. 
Marked post-injection increases in HR with abaloparatide were observed in healthy volunteers in the 
thorough QT-study with a maximum mean increase of 14.6 bpm 15 min after the therapeutic dose of 
80 μg. Significant increases in HR seemed to persist for several hours. In this context, it should be 
noted that abaloparatide was proposed to be given once daily as a subcutaneous injection. Besides a 
post-injection increase in heart rate compared to placebo evaluations of electrocardiograms did not 
indicate clinically relevant changes. 
The bone biopsy analysis did not indicate a pathological effect of abaloparatide on bone parameters; 
histomorphometry also did not show evidence of bone anabolic effects by abaloparatide or teriparatide.  
The analysis of renal CT-scans in a subset of patients from study BA058-05-003 to assess kidney 
calcification did not reveal an increased incidence of calculi with abaloparatide.  
No clinically relevant differences across treatment groups in local tolerance events for pain, swelling, or 
tenderness were reported in patient diaries from study BA058-05-003. Redness was slightly more 
often reported in the teriparatide than in the abaloparatide group, but teriparatide was applied open-
label limiting the validity of the comparison. 
As regards deaths and serious adverse events the analyses did not indicate clinically relevant 
differences between groups. In the 18 months pivotal phase 3 study BA058-05-003, 3 deaths occurred 
in patients on placebo and on abaloparatide each and 2 on teriparatide; none of these deaths were 
considered related to study medication. However, numbers are too small for a final assessment of 
differences in the incidence of death and serious adverse events. During the first 6 months of study 
BA058-05-005 there was 1 death in a patient switched from abaloparatide and overall there were 2 
additional AEs leading to death, 1 each in the placebo / alendronate and abaloparatide / alendronate 
group; none of these deaths were considered related to study medication. However, numbers are too 
small for a final assessment of differences in the incidence of death and serious adverse events 
possibly attributable to abaloparatide. 
In the first 6 months of the follow-up study BA058-05-005, 5 serious adverse events (brain neoplasm, 
colon cancer, intestinal adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, renal cancer) were reported in the system 
organ class ‘neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps)’ in patients

previously on abaloparatide versus none in patients previously on placebo; however this difference was 
not seen at later points during the extension trial. 
The percentage of patients with uric acid above upper normal limit was lower in the abaloparatide than 
in the teriparatide group, but increased compared to placebo. Levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, 25-
hydroxyvitamin D, and PTH intact were also increased in line with the therapeutic effect of 
abaloparatide. 
In the analysis by age groups (<65 years, 65 to <75 years, and ≥75 years) a higher percentage of 
patients ≥75 years of age in the abaloparatide group reported hypertension than in the teriparatide or 
placebo groups. Only 4 patients (0.2%) were ≥85 years of age, 1 patient on abaloparatide (85 years) 
and 3 patients on placebo (85 and 86 years).  
The analysis of ethnic subgroups is limited by the low number of subjects of other than Caucasian 
origin (about 80%); only a comparison of study participants of Asian or Caucasian origin has been 
provided and even numbers in the Asian subgroup are small. Thus no definite conclusions can be 
drawn of differences in safety of abaloparatide between ethnic groups. The percentage of patients who 
experienced adverse events was higher in Asian compared to Caucasian patients, but the pattern 
between treatment groups was comparable for the majority of adverse events. There was no difference 
in medical history or the average number of concomitant medication between the 2 ethnic groups, but 
Asian patients were slightly older and had lower body weight than Caucasian patients. The applicant 
claims that older age and lower body weight may at least partially explain the slightly higher incidence 
of adverse events in Asian patients. The analyses of adverse events by body weight indicated a general 
decrease in the incidence of adverse events with increasing body weight, but the analysis of adverse 
events by age showed no clear relationship of age with the incidence of adverse events. The system 
organ classes ‘cardiac disorders’ and ‘nervous system disorders’ were reported with a higher frequency 
in Asian compared to Caucasian patients and occurred more often with abaloparatide compared to 
teriparatide and placebo; preferred terms with this pattern were palpitation and dizziness, while no 
system organ class or preferred term were reported with a higher frequency in the abaloparatide 
versus the placebo group and with a lower frequency in Asian compared to Caucasian patients. 
As regards weight groups <54 kg, 54 to <68 kg, ≥68 kg the percentage of subjects with adverse 
events considered related across these subgroups decreased with increasing weight. 
The incidence of hypercalcaemia adverse events increased with decreasing baseline renal function in 
the teriparatide group (1.3%, 3.6% and 7.7% for the normal, mild and moderate renal impairment). 
In patients on abaloparatide with impaired renal function, i.e. subgroups with creatinine clearance ˂60 
mL/min (moderate renal impairment) and 60 to ˂90 mL/min (mild renal impairment), the incidence of 
hypercalcaemia was higher (1.9% for both groups of mild and moderate renal impairment) compared 
to patients with normal renal function (0.6%). The incidence of hypercalcaemia  as a laboratory 
assessment was similar between the subgroups with creatinine clearance ˂60 mL/min (moderate renal 
impairment) and 60 to ˂90 mL/min (mild renal impairment). No analysis of adverse events by baseline 
hepatic function is possible since no patient with baseline hepatic impairment was included in study 
BA058-05-003. 
No relationship between adverse events and current or previous tobacco use in the past 5 years before 
study entry in patients treated with abaloparatide has been identified. 
The incidence of hypersensitivity adverse events was comparable between abaloparatide and 
teriparatide treated patients.

During 18 months in study BA058-05-003 about half of the patients developed anti-abaloparatide 
antibodies and about one third showed neutralising antibodies. The number of patients with anti-
abaloparatide antibodies declined during the extension period in study BA058-05-005 when patients 
were treated with alendronate, about one quarter was antibody positive after 6 months into the 
extension. Whether development of anti-abaloparatide antibodies results in a decrease in 
pharmacokinetics of abaloparatide is unclear due to deficiencies in the bioanalytical method. The 
limited data available did not indicate an influence of the development of anti-abaloparatide antibodies 
as well as neutralising antibodies on the efficacy or safety of abaloparatide. However, the rate of 
antibody development is high; about 50% of the women treated with abaloparatide developed anti-
abaloparatide antibodies, including about 30% with neutralising antibodies.  
Abaloparatide is a peptide with specific affinity to the parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTHR1) with no 
known affinity to PTHR2 or other molecular targets. Since there are no known secondary targets and 
no known effects on CYP induction or inhibition the likelihood of drug-drug interactions was considered 
low. Thus no formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed which is considered 
acceptable.  
The number of patients who discontinued treatment and the incidence of adverse events leading to 
study discontinuation were higher in patients treated with abaloparatide than those treated with 
teriparatide or placebo and patients on abaloparatide dropped out earlier than on teriparatide or 
placebo. Adverse event most frequently associated with discontinuation in patients on abaloparatide 
were nausea, dizziness, headache, and palpitations; dizziness and headache were also among the most 
frequent adverse events associated with discontinuation in the teriparatide group but frequencies for 
these adverse events were lower than in the abaloparatide group. There were no relevant differences 
between these groups in the occurrence of serious adverse events leading to discontinuation. During 
the follow-up trial BA058-05-005 within the first 6 months there were 1 severe adverse event of 
nausea in a patient previously on placebo and 4 severe adverse events in patients previously on 
abaloparatide including intestinal adenocarcinoma (diagnosis subsequently changed to ovarian 
epithelial cancer) and brain tumour, led to discontinuation. 
In the same trial, within 24 months trial period, 2 severe adverse events of nausea and peritoneal 
neoplasm in patients previously on placebo and 7 severe adverse events including 5 in the system 
organ class ‘neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps)’ in patients 
previously on abaloparatide, led to discontinuation. 
Abaloparatide was authorised in the US in April 2017. From May 2017 through 26 January 2018 
approximately 9200 pens were distributed to estimated number of 3600 patients (approximately 770 
patient-years of therapy). As of 26 January 2018, there had been no unanticipated events. The post-
marketing safety database received 1,308 total number of adverse events. These were classified as 
follows: 
•  Adverse events (serious & non-serious) (504 patients) 
o  Highest frequency: headache (n=126), nausea (n=84), dizziness (n=76) 
o  Highest frequency Cardiovascular events: palpitations (n=49), heart rate increased (n=25) 
o  All other cardiovascular events ≤10 each preferred term 
•  Serious adverse events (n=39 patients) 
o  Highest frequency SAEs: dizziness (n=5); headache, death (n=4 each); irregular 
heartrate, hospitalisation (n=3 each)

o  Death cases - 1 not related to treatment, 1 with prior hospitalization for thrombosis and 
unknown cause of death, 2 with unknown cause of death 
o  Additional Cardiovascular SAEs: heart rate increased, palpitations, blood pressure 
increased (n=2 each); atrial fibrillation (pacemaker, medical history), intracardiac 
thrombus (medical history), angina pectoris/myocardial infarction, thrombosis (death case 
above) (n=1 each) 
The limited post-marketing experience did not raise any additional safety concern (see further in the 
document). 
Additional expert consultations 
CHMP requested an ad hoc expert meeting to obtain the opinion of experts in the field of cardiology, 
osteoporosis and geriatrics, as well as from patient representatives, on the issue of observed heart 
rate accelerations post injection of abaloparatide in the context of a single pivotal phase 3 trial. 
Questions were addressed to the ad hoc expert group. The corresponding answers are presented 
below: 
Question 1 
Which data are available regarding the possible impact of an intermittent increase in heart 
rate (as seen in the clinical trial with abaloparatide) on cardiovascular risk in general and in 
the target population “postmenopausal women” in particular? 
Epidemiologic data and clinical trials show an association of increased heart rate (HR) with an 
increased prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) disease. In most studies this represents a single 
measurement of HR at the onset of the study. In the experts’ view such a link does not establish 
causality, may be due to various underlying diseases, and, in any case, is not directly comparable to 
the pattern of increase of HR seen with abaloparatide. Equally, examples of physiological short term 
acceleration of HR, such as due to exercise, food ingestion etc., cannot be seen as equivalent to HR 
increases induced by pharmacological intervention. There seem to be also no similar examples of 
pharmacologically-induced increase of HR where data of impact on CV risk would be available. Overall, 
the possible impact of the type of increase in HR seen with abaloparatide on CV risk in general and in 
postmenopausal women in particular remains unknown. However, experts pointed out the potential 
vulnerability of the elderly and very elderly, due to high prevalence of cardiovascular disease. 
The experts voiced concern about how little was known about the cause of the HR increase with 
abaloparatide, which could in principle be caused by a number of mechanisms, such as catecholamine 
driven, vagus tone related, or reflex tachycardia due to vasodilation. One hypothesis offered by the 
applicant is that PTHrP analogues (and PTH) activate extra-osseous PTHrP receptors and may lead e.g. 
to smooth muscle relaxation, vasodilation, and consequential reflex tachycardia. The experts found a 
further understanding of the cause of the HR acceleration would be important to better appreciate any 
potential CV risk of this HR acceleration; the experts would be much more reassured about limited CV 
risk if the cause of the HR acceleration would be due to reflex tachycardia following vasodilation. Some 
experts suggested that a mechanistic study, including monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure, and 
preferably in the target population, could be helpful to alleviate concerns regarding potential CV risk. 
Question 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 108/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the answer to question 1, please consider the extent of the possible cardiovascular 
risk associated with the intermittent increase in heart rate seen in the clinical trial with 
abaloparatide and the active comparator (teriparatide). 
Regarding the potential CV risk associated with the HR increase induced by abaloparatide, the experts 
considered the Thorough QT study 012 in healthy volunteers: There was overall less concern with the 
temporary mean HR increase vs. control, which decreased to < 5 bpm difference by 2.5 hours post 
injection; more concerning was the substantial HR increase in individual probands in that study, e.g. 
up to 41 bpm with abaloparatide vs. 21 bpm with the control at 6 hours post injection, with the max. 
HR increase at most time points ca. twice as high as the control. Overall, a lack of more 
comprehensive PK/PD data was also noted. In the pivotal clinical study 003, a higher percentage of 
patients treated with abaloparatide exceeded certain thresholds of HR increase (e.g. > 20 bpm post vs. 
pre injection) compared to both placebo and the comparator, teriparatide; higher rates of AE 
orthostatic hypotension and AEs leading to discontinuation were observed with abaloparatide. The 
experts found it not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the potential impact of such HR 
changes on CV events in an osteoporosis patient population. They also pointed out the limitation of 
pivotal trial 003 in that regard, as several CV diseases were exclusion criteria and it included a placebo 
arm, making it likely that “real world” patients (likely to have a high risk of fracture often associated 
with a high CV risk) would have a higher CV risk profile than the population studied in the trial.  
Considering these uncertainties, and as several CV conditions were exclusion criteria in the pivotal 
study 003, the cardiologists among the experts suggested to consider to contraindicate the use of 
abaloparatide for certain common conditions; these could include: Tachyarrhythmia, including atrial 
fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia; sinus tachycardia; angina pectoris 
(both symptomatic stable, and unstable); significant valvular stenosis; heart failure; recent myocardial 
infarction (< 3 months). 
The experts noted that teriparatide, considered as a same in class product, as comparator in the 
pivotal study 003 did exhibit also HR increases, albeit to a lesser extent, and that no concerning CV 
safety signal has emerged for teriparatide since its authorisation in 2003, although such signals may 
be difficult to detect in an elderly population.  
The experts further noted the availability of post authorisation safety data from the US, where 
abaloparatide has been approved in April 2017 (with use in up to 3600 pats. as of January 2018); 
however, the experts had doubts regarding the usefulness of such data to be informative on the CV 
safety profile, in particular in the likely absence of important patient baseline data. 
Question 3 
How do you consider the feasibility and effectiveness of the currently proposed risk 
minimisation measures in general practice? Should other risk minimisation measures, 
including ways to identify patients most susceptible to cardiovascular adverse events, be 
considered? 
The applicant explained that their data did not point to any parameters which identify patients most 
susceptible to HR increase a priori, i.e. before treatment with abaloparatide, including e.g. no 
differences in pattern according to age or according to having diabetes (with potentially some degree 
of autonomic neuropathy). 
In the pivotal study 003, patients with a HR increase of ≤ 20 bpm HR after the first injection 
experienced less cardiac TEAEs, mainly palpitations (with comparable TEAEs and other parameters and 
outcomes), and subsequent occurrences of HR increases of >20 bpm were reduced. As a possible 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 109/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measure to mitigate the potential risk arising from HR increase, the applicant proposed the 
identification of patients experiencing an increase in HR of >20 bpm at 1 hour post first injection with 
abaloparatide, to employ a different follow up strategy for these patients during subsequent treatment 
with abaloparatide. These patients should then be seen more frequently, which would be needed to be 
further specified in the product information. 
The experts were critical whether there could be a meaningful rational of different treatment strategy 
for patients with a HR of >20 bpm at 1 hour post first injection. Cardiologist experts raised the 
question whether such patients identified as having a higher risk of repeated heart rate increases 
exceeding a certain threshold should be considered for a more comprehensive investigation to exclude 
CV disease (including echocardiography and Holter monitoring), or may in some cases discontinue the 
medication overall. 
The practicality of assessing the HR at 1 hour post injection and a more frequent follow up was, 
however, not questioned, and considered by the majority of osteoporosis experts as unproblematic, as 
this kind of treatment is with specialists in most health care systems, although with some exceptions. 
However, it was seen as problematic to base such a decision on a single, quite variable, measurement 
at individual patient level, and also because such a strategy would be based on a post hoc assessment 
with all its limitations. 
According to the osteoporosis experts, short term side effects observed at time of HR increase, such as 
tendency to hypotension / dizziness, and a subsequent risk of falling, could be mitigated by moving 
injection time point to bed time, based on experience with teriparatide injections (although, risk of falls 
during night time might still be an issue). The majority of the osteoporosis experts considered side 
effects manageable, in particular considering that as a PTH-related osteoanabolic agent the length of 
treatment is limited to maximal total duration of 18 months. Patient representatives voiced concerns in 
case quite frequent follow-up visits would be needed and whether side effects might impact compliance 
longer-term. 
The applicant is proposing a post authorisation safety study (PASS), using a population-based health 
care data base, with as primary outcome major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (global, but in 
particular US-based). While details of such a PASS proposal were not part of the briefing or discussion 
of the AHEG meeting, the experts had nevertheless a number of general comments: In general, in the 
presence of only one single pivotal trial, a second randomised controlled trial could be desirable, but it 
was acknowledged that an RCT specifically for such a safety concern would be quite large. Although 
the absence of CV disease-related contraindications in the US labelling might allow inclusion of high CV 
risk patients in a US study, there may be major differences, for instance use of such osteoanabolic 
therapy in the EU might be mostly in severe osteoporosis, representing a different population. In any 
such study extensive cardiovascular baseline data should be recorded, which may not be available in 
existing registries. Moreover, evaluation of risk mitigation measures could be also a consideration. 
Therefore, an EU-centric focus of such a PASS might be preferable. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety data for abaloparatide are limited to an exposure of 18 months in comparison to teriparatide 
and placebo plus 24 months of open-label follow-up on alendronate without comparator for patients 
who finished the base study and were treated with either abaloparatide or placebo; no follow-up of 
patients previously on teriparatide is available although this might have delivered important 
information for the safety evaluation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 110/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Extent and duration of exposure as well as the chosen comparator teriparatide are adequate except for 
rare events and the assessment of carcinogenicity; post-licensing safety data will be collected to 
further assess the safety of abaloparatide in this regard. 
Relevant differences were seen in the incidences of the adverse events orthostatic hypotension, 
palpitations, nausea, dizziness, and headache, which occurred more often in abaloparatide treated 
patients compared with those receiving teriparatide or placebo; the adverse event dizziness showed 
also a dose-dependent effect in patients treated with abaloparatide. Marked post-injection increases in 
HR with abaloparatide were observed in healthy volunteers in the thorough QT-study. Significant 
increases in HR seemed to persist for several hours. Besides the post-injection increase in heart rate 
evaluations of electrocardiograms did not indicate clinically relevant changes. However, an increase in 
heart rate of the magnitude seen in the clinical trials with abaloparatide may have clinical 
consequences in vulnerable patients. The pivotal study had extensive exclusion criteria based on ECG 
findings and medical history of cardiovascular disease. Consequently, the number of cardiovascular 
adverse events in the study population was probably too low to conclude on any possible risks related 
to the post-baseline heart rate and blood pressure measurements in the study. In addition, the 
percentage of subjects who discontinued treatment due to palpitations, nausea, and dizziness occurred 
more frequently in the abaloparatide arm compared to teriparatide and placebo arms leading to 
possible follow-up bias and a lower number of reported cardiovascular AEs in this group over the study 
period.  
To mitigate these risks, the applicant proposed to monitor patients in clinical practice after the first 
dose of abaloparatide for heart rate and blood pressure; patients either particularly responsive to 
haemodynamic effects or vulnerable to adverse events like ischemia or syncope may be detected with 
medical staff nearby although this does not prevent events of increased heart rate or hypotension 
during the later course of the treatment. It was proposed that patients at increased cardiovascular risk 
e.g. due to coronary artery disease, pronounced atherosclerosis, symptomatic heart failure NYHA II or 
III, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy would have been monitored frequently during the course of 
treatment. If severe orthostatic hypotension or severe cardiovascular symptoms occur, treatment 
would have been discontinued. 
The risk of increased heart rate and orthostatic hypotension in vulnerable patients exists throughout 
treatment and the risk cannot fully be eliminated by monitoring patients after the first dose. 
Information provided through the SmPC sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1, as well as the PL were 
proposed. 
Hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria occurred less frequently in patients on abaloparatide than on 
teriparatide but more often than on placebo; the incidence of hypercalcaemia adverse events increased 
with decreasing baseline renal function. The analysis of renal CT scans in a subset of patients from 
study BA058-05-003 to assess kidney calcification did not reveal an increased incidence of calculi with 
abaloparatide compared to placebo. Organ calcification has been identified in preclinical trials; this has 
been addressed as an important potential risk in the Risk Management Plan. The percentage of 
patients with uric acid above upper normal limit was lower in the abaloparatide than in the teriparatide 
group, but increased compared to placebo.  
No analysis of adverse events by baseline hepatic function is possible since no patient with baseline 
hepatic impairment was included in study BA058-05-003. 
There were no significant differences between abaloparatide, teriparatide, and placebo in adverse 
events leading to death and serious adverse events, but numbers are too small for a final assessment. 
It was of concern that in the first 6 months of the follow-up study BA058-05-005, 5 serious adverse 
Assessment report

events (brain neoplasm, colon cancer, intestinal adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, renal cancer) were 
reported in the system organ class ‘neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and 
polyps)’ in patients previously on abaloparatide versus none in patients previously on placebo; 
however this difference was not seen at later points during the trial. 
In general the highest incidences of adverse events as well as differences between groups were seen 
within the first 2 months of treatment; differences were no longer apparent from 6 months onwards. 
The diminishing differences in frequency of adverse events might be attributable to the differential 
drop-out between treatment groups; fewer patients on abaloparatide than on either teriparatide or 
placebo completed the 18 months trial BA058-05-003 and patients on abaloparatide dropped out 
earlier than on teriparatide or placebo.  
The bone biopsy analysis did not indicate a pathological effect of abaloparatide on bone parameters; 
histomorphometry also did not show evidence of bone anabolic effects by abaloparatide or teriparatide.  
No clinically relevant differences across treatment groups in local tolerance were seen and the 
incidence of hypersensitivity adverse events was comparable between abaloparatide and teriparatide 
treated patients. About half of the patients developed anti-abaloparatide antibodies and about one 
third neutralising antibodies; antibody titres declined during the extension period on alendronate, but 
remained high. The limited data did not indicate an influence of the development of anti-abaloparatide 
antibodies as well as neutralising antibodies on the efficacy or safety of abaloparatide.  
While no increase in major adverse cardiovascular events in patients treated with abaloparatide 
compared to the comparators was seen in the pivotal study, common adverse events, likely linked in 
part to heart rate increase, such as palpitations, tachycardia, dizziness, nausea and discontinuations, 
were reported more frequently in patients treated with abaloparatide. With respect to serious 
cardiovascular events, due to the size and the exclusion criteria, the pivotal study did not have power 
to detect such events and therefore was considered by CHMP not sufficient to assess risk for adverse 
cardiovascular outcomes associated with heart rate increase in a generally more vulnerable real-life 
osteoporosis population.

stage. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Not applicable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Abaloparatide subcutaneous daily injection is intended for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 
order to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and consequently reduce the risk of vertebral and non-
vertebral fractures.  
In Europe, 22 million women and 5.5 million men were estimated to have osteoporosis in 2010; and 
3.5 million new osteoporotic fractures were sustained. Most fractures occur at the spine, wrist and hip. 
The vast majority of osteoporotic fractures occur in postmenopausal women and the incidence 
increases markedly with age. 
As regards anti-osteoporotic treatment for the reduction of the risk of osteoporotic fractures the 
majority of options aim at antiresorptive properties while therapeutic options to increase new bone 
formation and BMD with a bone anabolic agent are limited. Abaloparatide is a synthetic, 34 amino acid 
analogue of PTHrP(1-34) and belongs to the same class as teriparatide (approved for osteoporosis 
approximately 10 years ago) and stimulates the production and activity of osteoblasts, increasing BMD 
by building new bone.  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
A definition from 1993 states osteoporosis is a “disease characterised by low bone mass and 
microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to enhanced bone fragility and a consequent 
increase in fracture risk”. A more recent definition from the NIH Consensus Development Panel on 
Osteoporosis defines osteoporosis as a skeletal disorder characterised by compromised bone strength 
predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture (Szulc & Bouxsein, 2010). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The primary aim of pharmacological treatment is the reduction of the risk of osteoporotic fractures. 
Currently, there are two therapeutic approaches for the treatment of osteoporosis; one is to decrease 
bone loss with an antiresorptive drug and the other is to increase new bone formation and BMD with a 
bone anabolic therapy. Antiresorptive agents are e.g. oestrogens and selective oestrogen receptor 
modulators, anti-RANK ligand antibodies, and bisphosphonates. They inhibit the bone-resorbing 
activity of osteoclasts while an anabolic therapy like teriparatide in contrast stimulates the production 
and activity of osteoblasts, increasing BMD by building new bone.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The basis for the MAA of abaloparatide-SC is the 18 months pivotal Phase 3 study BA058-05-003 
(ACTIVE study) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The clinical efficacy and safety of daily 
80 μg abaloparatide was studied in comparison to a matched placebo and an open-label active control 
daily teriparatide 20 μg SC. A total of 2070 patients were randomised into three treatment arms of 
approximately 690 patients in each group. The 18 months period was followed by extension study 
BA058-05-005, where a total of 963 patients who previously received placebo (n=494) or 
abaloparatide (n=469) received 18 months of alendronate therapy. 
Based on the deviations found during the GCP inspections at two sites in Czech Republic of study 
BA058-05-003, data from these two sites cannot be used when assessing the marketing authorisation 
application and, consequently only endpoints and information excluding data from those two sites are 
the basis for the benefit-risk evaluation. The applicant proposed to consider a post hoc defined 
population of “postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture” (IROF population) to be the basis 
of the efficacy evaluation rather than the originally defined population excluding the two sites in Czech 
Republic; this was not considered acceptable. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Abaloparatide administered at a dose of 80 µg SC daily over up to 18 months significantly reduced the 
risk of experiencing new vertebral fractures compared to placebo in postmenopausal women; the 
active comparator teriparatide also showed a significant reduction in the incidence of new vertebral 
fractures compared to placebo in this population. New vertebral fractures (mainly non-clinical) 
occurred in 3 (0.5%) patients treated with abaloparatide, in 25 (4.2%) patients on placebo, and in 4 
(0.7%) patients on teriparatide. After 6 months of alendronate treatment in the extension study 
BA058-05-005 no patient previously on abaloparatide and 6 previously on placebo experienced new 
vertebral fractures while after 24 months these were 2 patients previously on abaloparatide and 13 on 
placebo. The absolute risk reduction in the abaloparatide treated group compared to placebo was -
3.65, (95% CI: (-5.59, -2.00) in study BA058-05-003 at month 18 (p<0.0001). In the extension study 
BA058-05-005 the risk reduction versus placebo (95% CI) was -1.23 (-2.65, -0.16; p=0.0313) at 
Month 6 and -2.22 (-4.08, -0.64; p=0.0074) at Month 24. 
The percent changes in BMD at total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine from baseline to 18-month 
were statistically significantly higher with abaloparatide compared to placebo and the results 
demonstrate a relevant increase in BMD in patients on abaloparatide; teriparatide also increased BMD 
from baseline to 18 months at all three sites. BMD decreased with placebo at all three sites.  
Percent changes in the anabolic serum bone marker s-P1NP were higher for abaloparatide versus 
placebo at all time-points, while the increase with teriparatide was higher than with abaloparatide from 
3 months onwards. The bone resorption marker s-CTX showed a transient increase for abaloparatide 
versus placebo from 3 to 12 months and increases in s-CTX were highest with teriparatide. Activities of 
BALP and s-osteocalcin were higher with abaloparatide versus placebo and highest in participants using 
teriparatide. 
The FRAX analysis of the data from study BA058-05-003 indicate that the estimated baseline fracture 
probabilities were low compared to several other phase 3 studies in patients with osteoporosis but for 
example similar to that seen in clinical trials of bazedoxifene. Fracture probabilities increased with age. 
Baseline characteristics of fracture probabilities for patients recruited to the extension study BA058-05-
005 did not differ from the population of study BA058-05-003 and there were no relevant differences 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 117/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between those who continued and those who did not. Hazard ratios for the effect of abaloparatide on 
the various fracture outcomes did not change significantly across the range of baseline fracture 
probability, suggesting significant efficacy over the whole range.  
In the open label extension study BA058-05-005 where patients previously on abaloparatide or placebo 
(but not those on teriparatide) were switched to alendronate, further increases in BMD from the 
BA058-05-003 baseline were observed in both groups; mean percent BMD increases were generally 
greater in the placebo / alendronate group than in the abaloparatide / alendronate group. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In contrast to the CHMP guideline on osteoporosis requiring in general a duration of treatment in the 
pivotal phase 3 trials for a new osteoporotic medicinal product of at least 24 months in order to 
provide clear fracture and bone safety data, the Applicant has provided only a total duration of 18 
months of treatment in the single phase 3 study, with a separate extension study without 
abaloparatide treatment. The chosen design has several deficiencies, among them that patients on 
teriparatide have not been offered to participate in the extension study and that the continuation in the 
extension study might have introduced a selection bias to the data beyond 18 months of treatment.  
The active comparator teriparatide was not blinded due to commercial availability of teriparatide and 
for the analysis of differences in effects between teriparatide and abaloparatide as well teriparatide and 
placebo it has to be considered that patients and physicians have been aware of the treatment applied 
in patients on teriparatide. Discontinuation and the percentage of patients with no post-treatment x-
ray were significantly different between groups; discontinuation was highest with abaloparatide and 
lowest with teriparatide and the percentage of patients with no post-treatment x-ray was higher in 
patients on abaloparatide compared to both placebo and teriparatide. 
GCP related serious findings lead to exclusion of two study sites in the single pivotal study, reducing 
the total study population by 16% from 2463 to 2070 participants. All assessments in this report were 
therefore based on this smaller subset of study participants. 
A significant and clinically relevant efficacy of abaloparatide compared to placebo on non-vertebral 
fractures has not been established [log-rank p=0.3675; HR (95% CI) 0.74 (0.38, 1.43)] and there was 
no statistically significant difference between abaloparatide and teriparatide on the time to first 
incidence of non-vertebral fracture [p=0.4919; HR (95%CI) 1.30 (0.61, 2.79)]. Furthermore, the 
analysis of this key secondary endpoint non-vertebral fracture was changed in the statistical analysis 
plan that was finalised two days prior to database lock and further changes to the analysis were 
introduced after database lock, including changes of the definition of the key secondary endpoint; 
usually, it is expected that changes to principle features of the analysis are documented in a protocol 
amendment rather than only in the statistical analysis plan.  
The time to first incidence of other fractures defined as clinical fracture, major osteoporotic fracture, 
wrist fracture, non-vertebral fracture including any level of trauma, and clinical spine fracture was 
numerically increased for abaloparatide compared to teriparatide but differences were mostly not 
statistically significant and are not considered clinically relevant. 
BMD in patients on abaloparatide appears to increase with diminishing creatinine clearance; this effect 
might be due to an increase in abaloparatide exposure due to reduced renal elimination. 
It is not clear if and how the differences in changes in serum bone markers s-P1NP, s-CTX, BALP, and 
s-osteocalcin relate to difference in the reduction of fracture risk between abaloparatide and 
teriparatide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 118/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There were only minimal numerical differences in change and percent change in vertical height 
between groups and differences were neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Relevant differences were seen in the incidences of the adverse events such as palpitations (5.6%, 
1.7%, and 0.4%, respectively), nausea (8.5%, 5.4%, and 3.1%, respectively), dizziness (11.1%, 
8.2%, and 7.1%, respectively), and the increase in heart rate (mean (SD) maximum increases 7.8 
(8.60) bpm, 6.7 (9.28) bpm, and 1.9 (8.95) bpm, respectively) which occurred more often in 
abaloparatide treated patients compared with those receiving teriparatide or placebo. Also the 
incidence of orthostatic hypotension, defined as a composite adverse event of special interest, was 
higher on abaloparatide than on teriparatide or placebo treatments (28.4%, 19.8%, and 14.4%, 
respectively).  The adverse event dizziness showed also a dose-dependent effect in patients treated 
with abaloparatide (20 μg, 40 μg, 80 μg: 0%, 9%, and 11%, respectively).  
TEAEs associated with hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria (AEs of special interest) occurred less 
frequently in patients on abaloparatide (2.2%, 14.3%) than on teriparatide (4.8%, 17.6%) but more 
often than on placebo (0.6%, 11.1%); the incidence of hypercalcaemia adverse events increased with 
decreasing baseline renal function (CrCl ≥90 ml/min, ≥60 <90 ml/min, <60 ml/min: 0.6%, 1.9% and 
1.9% for abaloparatide and 1.3%, 3.6% and 7.7% for teriparatide).  
There were no significant differences between abaloparatide, teriparatide, and placebo in adverse 
events leading to death and serious adverse events.  
In general the highest incidences of adverse events as well as differences between groups were seen 
within the first 2 months of treatment; differences were no longer apparent from 6 months onwards.  
Abaloparatide injection is followed by an increase in heart rate. In study BA058-05-003, abaloparatide 
and teriparatide markedly increased heart rate measured 1 hour post injection compared to placebo. 
The mean increases from baseline in the abaloparatide group ranged between 6.9 and 7.8 bpm from 
day 1 to month 12. For teriparatide, the mean increases in heart rate post-dose were lower, between 
5.5 to 6.7 bpm from day 1 to month 12, and for placebo, the mean increases post-injection were 1.2 
to 1.9 bpm. Overall, 7.9%, 3.6%, and 0.7% of patients on abaloparatide, teriparatide, and placebo, 
respectively, had a maximal increase in heart rate >25 bpm at any time point. About 20% of 
abaloparatide patients experienced a maximal increase in HR by >20 bpm at any time point, compared 
to 11% of teriparatide patients and 3% of placebo patients; only patients on treatment with 
abaloparatide experienced HR increases by more than 40 bpm and there was even a single case where 
the maximal increase in heart rate was >50 bpm. These observations were paralleled by a higher rate 
in cardiac related TEAEs in the abaloparatide group than in the teriparatide or the placebo group, 
primarily due to palpitations and tachycardia. 
In line with the findings in the pivotal study BA058-05-003, marked post-injection increases in heart 
rate for abaloparatide were observed in male and female healthy volunteers in the thorough QT-study 
BA058-05-012. The maximum mean increase of 14.6 bpm was noted 15 min after the therapeutic dose 
of 80 µg vs. 0.1 bpm in the placebo group. Mean increases of 9.5 bpm in the abaloparatide group vs. 
0.9 bpm in the placebo group were seen 1 h post-dose. Significant increases in heart rate seem to 
persist at least12 h (mean 9.5 bpm in the abaloparatide group vs 7.3 bpm in the placebo group). The 
mean heart rate had almost returned to baseline and was comparable to placebo at 24 h, i.e. the 
proposed time point for the next injection in a clinical setting.

There is substantial epidemiologic information concerning the relationship between heart rate and 
cardiovascular disease. Generally, these studies show that elevations of heart rate can be associated 
with the development or worsening of cardiovascular disorders but whether this is due to confounding 
or whether an increase in heart rate is a risk factor in itself is not clear. Furthermore, the 
epidemiological studies investigated the association of cardiovascular risk with overall mean heart rate 
and not with transitory, intermittent increases in heart rate due to an external intervention. 
The population of the pivotal trial BA058-05-003 is not considered entirely representative of the 
expected general patient population due to relevant exclusion criteria for study participation and for 
the most vulnerable populations either no or very limited data are available. 
AEs associated with the SOC cardiac disorders were reported more frequently in the abaloparatide 
group (12%) compared to placebo (5%) and teriparatide (6%). The difference between groups was 
driven by higher incidences of palpitations and tachycardia in the abaloparatide group.  
Taken together, an increase in heart rate due to vasodilation and possibly coronary vasodilation 
leading to coronary steal effects may precipitate myocardial ischemia in vulnerable patients. Albeit 
based on low event rates, a higher rate of myocardial ischemia was observed with abaloparatide and 
with teriparatide compared to placebo.   
Orthostatic hypotension, defined as a decrease in SBP of ≥20 mmHg from supine to standing or in DBP 
of ≥10 mmHg from supine to standing 1 hour post-dose, was reported in all treatment groups (7 AEs 
in abaloparatide, 4 in placebo and 3 in teriparatide). 
About half of the patients developed anti-abaloparatide antibodies and about one third neutralising 
antibodies; antibody titres declined during the extension period on alendronate, but remained high. For 
teriparatide an antibody rate of 2.8% is given in the SPC and of about 4% in the EPAR. The limited 
data did not indicate an influence of the development of anti-abaloparatide antibodies as well as 
neutralising antibodies on the efficacy or safety of abaloparatide.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety data for abaloparatide are limited to an exposure of 18 months in comparison to teriparatide 
and placebo plus 24 months of open-label follow-up on alendronate without comparator for patients 
who finished the base study and were treated with either abaloparatide or placebo; no follow-up of 
patients previously on teriparatide is available although this might have delivered important 
information for the safety evaluation.  
Extent and duration of exposure do not allow an assessment of rare adverse events or adverse events 
with late onset including carcinogenicity and long-term cardiovascular adverse effects; post-licensing 
safety data will be needed to further assess the safety of abaloparatide. 
As regards the increase in the incidence of orthostatic hypotension the applicant argues that this is due 
to an increase in heart rate post injection, but an increase in heart rate was also seen in patients 
treated with teriparatide resulting in a lower frequency of orthostatic hypotension adverse events.  
Regarding major adverse cardiac events (MACE), the number of events during 18 months was limited 
for any firm conclusions on differences between groups. There were 4 (0.6%) cases of myocardial 
ischemia / acute myocardial infarction in the abaloparatide group versus 5 (0.7%) in the teriparatide 
and 1 (0.1%) in the placebo group. Due to the size and the exclusion criteria, the pivotal study did not 
have power to sufficiently detect such MACE events and therefore was considered by CHMP not 
sufficient to assess risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with heart rate increase in a 
generally more vulnerable real-life osteoporosis population.

No studies in hypertensive women and in patients with stable heart failure were included in this MAA 
for abaloparatide. 
The thorough QT study produced data which fulfilled, although borderline, the criterion for a negative 
QT study.  
The analysis of renal CT scans in a subset of patients from study BA058-05-003 to assess kidney 
calcification did not reveal an increased incidence of calculi with abaloparatide compared to placebo but 
organ calcification has been identified in preclinical trials; this was proposed to be addressed as an 
important potential risk in the Risk Management Plan.  
No analysis of adverse events by baseline hepatic function is possible since no patient with baseline 
hepatic impairment was included in study BA058-05-003. 
There were no significant differences between abaloparatide, teriparatide, and placebo in adverse 
events leading to death and serious adverse events, but numbers are too small for a final assessment. 
It was of concern that in the first 6 months of the follow-up study BA058-05-005, 5 serious adverse 
events (brain neoplasm, colon cancer, intestinal adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, renal cancer) were 
reported in the system organ class ‘neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and 
polyps)’ in patients previously on abaloparatide versus none in patients previously on placebo; 
however this difference was not seen at later points during the trial. 
The diminishing differences in frequency of adverse events might be attributable to the differential 
drop-out between treatment groups; fewer patients on abaloparatide than on either teriparatide or 
placebo completed the 18 months trial BA058-05-003 and patients on abaloparatide dropped out 
earlier than on teriparatide or placebo, most frequently during the first month of the study. The most 
frequently occurring TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation by SOC were nervous system 
disorders (2.6%), gastrointestinal disorders (2.0%), cardiac disorders (1.7%), and investigation 
(1.1%) for abaloparatide, gastrointestinal disorders (1.3%) and nervous system disorders (1.9%) for 
teriparatide, and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (1.7%) for placebo. The mean 
duration of exposure for abaloparatide in study BA058-05-003 was 15.0 months compared to 15.6 
months in the placebo and 15.8 months in the teriparatide group. The pattern of shorter mean 
duration of treatment with abaloparatide compared to teriparatide and placebo was also seen in the 
phase 2 study BA058-05-002.  
As regards the validity of the bone biopsy analysis sensitivity seems limited since histomorphometry 
did not show evidence of bone anabolic effects by abaloparatide or teriparatide.  
Relatively marked differences in AE reporting were seen between Asian and Caucasian subpopulations 
with higher incidences of total AEs, related AEs, and serious AEs. The observed differences were mainly 
driven by preferred terms dizziness, headache, palpitations, and hypercalciuria.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The main clinical consequence of osteoporosis is an increased risk of fragility fractures. Radiological 
vertebral fractures are a common finding in postmenopausal women and usually asymptomatic 
(approximately 60%). A typical symptomatic vertebral fracture causes acute pain and decreased 
mobility that lasts about one month. Fractures that require surgery are the most dangerous aspect of 
osteoporosis. Hip fracture and the following surgery in particular, are associated with serious risks, 
permanent disability, and increased mortality. Radiological vertebral fractures on the other hand are 
considered as important markers of osteoporosis severity. BMD is a surrogate marker for osteoporosis 
severity and included in the osteoporosis definition by the WHO criteria. 
Abaloparatide significantly reduces the risk of developing new vertebral fractures. However, the CHMP 
guideline on osteoporosis requests that for the demonstration of efficacy of a new anti-osteoporotic 
drug effects on non-vertebral fractures should also be shown, preferably in a separate, adequate 
powered study. Abaloparatide has only been studied in 1 pivotal trial with non-vertebral fractures as 
key secondary, but not as co-primary endpoint. In this pivotal trial no effect of abaloparatide on non-
vertebral fractures has been established.  
Other endpoints investigated, e.g. BMD and serum bone markers, are in line with the primary finding 
of a reduction in the risk of osteoporotic fractures and endpoints investigated primarily show the same 
trend of an advantage of abaloparatide over placebo. However, these endpoints are only supportive 
surrogates, they do not establish effects in their own right, and do not allow a valid conclusion on 
efficacy nor on an advantage of abaloparatide over teriparatide as claimed by the Applicant.  
The identified risks of nausea, dizziness, and palpitations did not increase the number of syncopes or 
falls in study BA058-05-003 but led to more discontinuations in the abaloparatide treated patients. The 
inclusion and exclusion criteria in study BA058-05-003 were relatively extensive which impacts the 
generalisability of the pivotal study, mainly regarding safety data, to the elderly osteoporosis 
population with concomitant chronic diseases and medications. The marked increase in heart rate is of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 123/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concern in the general osteoporosis population where concomitant cardiovascular diseases are 
expected to be more common than in the population included in the pivotal trial. The increase in heart 
rate was more pronounced in patients treated with abaloparatide compared with teriparatide. 
An increase in heart rate of the magnitude seen in the clinical trials with abaloparatide may have 
clinical consequences in vulnerable patients. The pivotal study had extensive exclusion criteria based 
on ECG findings and medical history of cardiovascular disease. Consequently, the number of 
cardiovascular adverse events in the study population was too low to conclude on any possible risks 
related to the post-baseline heart rate and blood pressure measurements in the study. In addition, the 
percentage of subjects who discontinued treatment due to palpitations, nausea, and dizziness was 
higher in the abaloparatide compared to the teriparatide and placebo arms leading to possible follow-
up bias and a lower number of reported cardiovascular AEs in this group over the study period.  
To mitigate these risks, the applicant proposed to monitor patients in clinical practice after the first 
dose of abaloparatide for heart rate and blood pressure; patients either particularly responsive to 
haemodynamic effects or vulnerable to adverse events like ischemia or syncope may be detected with 
medical staff in attendance although this does not prevent events of increased heart rate or 
hypotension during the later course of the treatment. It was proposed that patients at increased 
cardiovascular risk e.g. due to coronary artery disease, pronounced atherosclerosis, symptomatic heart 
failure NYHA II or III or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy would have been monitored frequently during 
the course of treatment. If severe orthostatic hypotension or severe cardiovascular symptoms occur, 
treatment would have been discontinued. 
The risk of increased heart rate and orthostatic hypotension in vulnerable patients exists throughout 
treatment and the risk cannot fully be eliminated by monitoring patients after the first dose. 
Information provided through the SmPC in sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1, as well as the PL were 
proposed. 
The frequency of the development of anti-abaloparatide antibodies and neutralising antibodies is very 
high. The limited available data do not show an effect of antibodies to abaloparatide on efficacy or 
safety.  
There were a number of adverse events in the system organ class ‘neoplasms benign, malignant and 
unspecified´ and in the first 6 months of the follow-up study BA058-05-005, 5 events (brain neoplasm, 
colon cancer, intestinal adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, renal cancer) were reported in this system 
organ class in patients previously on abaloparatide versus none in patients previously on placebo; 
however this difference was not seen at later time-points during the trial.  
The incidence of hypercalcaemia adverse events is lower in patients treated with abaloparatide than 
teriparatide, but organ calcification has been identified in preclinical trials. Thus, it can currently not be 
excluded that abaloparatide might induce organ calcification and e.g. impair renal function. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy of treatment with abalaoparatide over 18 months regarding the incidence of new 
radiologically-detected vertebral fractures was demonstrated in the pivotal study (abaloparatide 0.51% 
vs. placebo vs 4.2%). However, the study failed to demonstrate statistically significant efficacy on non-
vertebral fractures versus placebo (abaloparatide 2.2% vs. placebo 3.1%). Only one hip fracture 
occurred in the study (on placebo). Similarity of the mechanism of action with teriparatide might allow 
some extrapolation regarding efficacy but direct in-study comparison with teriparatide was based on 
very few fracture events. New vertebral fractures occurred in 3/583 (0.51%) patients on abaloparatide 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 124/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
versus 4/600 (0.67%) patients on teriparatide. Non-vertebral fractures occurred in 15/696 (2.2%) 
patients on abaloparatide versus 12/686 (1.7%) patients on teriparatide.   
All available data indicate a dose related increase in heart rate that parallels exposure to 
abaloparatide. The marked increase in heart rate associated with abaloparatide is not solely related to 
peripheral vasodilation but there is a direct chronotropic effect on cardiomyocytes as indicated by non-
clinical studies. The heart rate increase with abaloparatide cannot be considered comparable to 
physiological variations in heart rate and is therefore a safety concern.  
Marked post-injection increases in heart rate with abaloparatide were observed in healthy volunteers in 
the thorough QT-study with a maximum mean increase of 14.6 bpm 15 min after the therapeutic dose 
of 80 μg. Significant increases in heart rate seemed to persist for several hours. This is of concern, 
particularly as abaloparatide was intended to be given once daily as a subcutaneous injection. 
In the pivotal study, the 1 hour post-dose heart rate increased more in abaloparatide treated patients 
compared to teriparatide. Therefore, safety data from clinical studies and post-marketing experience 
from teriparatide cannot be extrapolated to abaloparatide. In the pivotal study, for example, 20% of 
patients treated with abaloparatide experienced an  increase in heart rate by >20 bpm at any time 
point versus 11% of patients treated with teriparatide and 3% of placebo patients. Patients that 
experienced highest increases in HR by >40 bpm (0.7%) were all in the abaloparatide group. 
Associated adverse events such as palpitations (6% vs. 2%), tachycardia (1.3% vs. 0.4%), dizziness 
(11% vs. 8%), nausea (9% vs. 5%) and discontinuations due to adverse events (10% vs. 7%) were 
also reported more frequently in patients treated with abaloparatide compared to teriparatide. There 
were more early (≤1 month) drop-outs in the abaloparatide-arm (7.9%) compared to teriparatide 
(3.9%).  
Risk minimisation measures proposed by the applicant with contraindications in patients with pre-
existing cardiac disease, if followed, may reduce the CV risk associated with heart rate increases. 
However, thorough screening for undiagnosed conditions with echocardiography for these conditions 
appears unlikely to be feasible in a general osteoporosis population. In light of overall increased heart 
rate related adverse events compared to teriparatide, a reasonable target population for abaloparatide 
in clinical practice could not be identified. 
As a single pivotal trial of a new osteoporosis agent the size of the study was small. Only healthy 
ambulatory postmenopausal woman, screened for being free from any significant cardiac disturbances, 
were included and the overall number of serious cardiovascular events during the 18 month study 
period was low. Therefore, this study is not considered sufficient in order to assess the risk for adverse 
cardiovascular outcomes associated with heart rate increases in a real-life osteoporosis population 
generally more vulnerable regarding cardiovascular risk.  
Overall, this application for a new osteoporosis agent is not considered to be in accordance with EMA 
points to consider on application with one pivotal study with “particularly compelling results with 
respect to internal and external validity, clinical relevance, statistical significance, data quality, and 
internal consistency.” 
Considering the above mentioned limitations, the efficacy data are not considered sufficient to 
outweigh the risks associated with the increase in heart rate.  
The benefit-risk balance for abaloparatide is therefore negative.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy for Eladynos in the treatment of 
osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture (see Section 5.1), the CHMP 
considers by majority decision that the safety and efficacy of the above mentioned medicinal product is 
not sufficiently demonstrated, and, therefore recommends the refusal of the granting of the marketing 
authorisation  for the above mentioned medicinal product. The CHMP considers that: 
Whereas the safety and efficacy of the above mentioned medicinal product is not sufficiently 
demonstrated: 
 
The efficacy of Eladynos (abaloparatide), for the treatment of osteoporosis, was supported by 
one pivotal study only. This study failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect on non-
vertebral fractures vs. placebo which is a requirement outlined in the “Guideline on the 
evaluation of medicinal products in the treatment of primary osteoporosis”. In the pivotal study, 
there were serious GCP related findings and data from two sites had to be excluded which 
reduced the size of the study population.    
 
Marked post-injection increases in heart rate with abaloparatide were observed in healthy 
volunteers in the thorough QT-study with a maximum mean increase of 14.6 bpm 15 min after 
the therapeutic dose of 80 μg. In the pivotal phase III study, 1 hour post-dose heart rate 
increased more in abaloparatide treated patients compared to both placebo and teriparatide with 
42% of patients treated with abaloparatide experiencing an increase in heart rate of >15 bpm at 
any time. 
o  No increase in major adverse cardiovascular events in patients treated with 
abaloparatide was noted compared to comparators. However, more common adverse 
events such as palpitations, tachycardia, dizziness, nausea and discontinuations were 
reported more frequently in patients treated with abaloparatide compared to both 
teriparatide and placebo which may be related to the documented effect of 
abaloparatide on heart rate.  Furthermore, the size of the study was small and the 
number of serious cardiovascular events during the 18 month study period was low 
and therefore the study did not have power to detect such events. In addition, 
patients with significant pre-existing cardiovascular disease, being at a higher risk of 
cardiovascular events, were excluded from the study. Therefore, this study is not 
considered sufficient in order to assess risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 126/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
associated with heart rate increase in a generally more vulnerable real-life 
osteoporosis population.  
o  Risk minimisation measures including contraindications in patients with pre-existing 
cardiac disease as well as monitoring of patients at risk were proposed by the 
Applicant. However, in light of an increased baseline risk of cardiovascular events in 
the postmenopausal osteoporosis patient population, a reasonable target population 
for abaloparatide in clinical practice could not be identified. 
Therefore, the CHMP has recommended the refusal of the granting of the marketing authorisation for 
Eladynos. 
Due to the aforementioned concerns a satisfactory summary of product characteristics, labelling, 
package leaflet, risk management plan and follow-up measures to address other concerns as outlined 
in the list of outstanding issues cannot be agreed at this stage. 
Furthermore, the CHMP, in light of the negative recommendation, was of the opinion that it is not 
appropriate to conclude on the new active substance status at this time.  
Divergent positions to the majority recommendation are appended to this report. 
5.   Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 22 March 2018 
Following the CHMP conclusion that Eladynos was not approvable on the grounds outlined above, the 
applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal.  
Following a request from the applicant at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened an Ad 
Hoc Expert Group meeting on 10 July 2018 to seek their views on the CHMP grounds for refusal, taking 
into account the applicant’s response. 
Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The applicant presented detailed grounds for re-examination in writing and at an oral explanation. 
A summary of the applicant’s grounds for re-examination is presented as follows: 
Efficacy (the efficacy of Eladynos was supported by one pivotal study only, which failed to 
demonstrate a statistically significant effect on non-vertebral fractures vs. placebo) 
Ground #1: Failure to demonstrate a statistically significant effect on non-vertebral 
fractures as required by the osteoporosis guideline. 
 
In line with the requirements of the EMA guideline on osteoporosis, long-term 25 and 43-
month abaloparatide/alendronate (ALN) sequential therapy data showed statistically significant 
and clinically relevant reductions in non-vertebral fractures (NVF) (25 months, p=0.0244 and 
at 43 months, p=0.0237) in the pre-specified Per Protocol (PP) population, which is a pre-
planned analysis representative and supportive of the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population. In 
the context of Annex 1 to Directive 2001/83, the 25 and 43-month results should be 
considered.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 127/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pre-specified ITT analysis at 25 and 43 months is a comparison vs an active agent 
(alendronate). To analyse the effect of the sequential abaloparatide/ALN therapy compared to 
a true placebo, alone, the K-M rate of NVF fractures at 19 months (3.6%) in the placebo arm 
using the 003 ITT population has been linearly extrapolated to 43 months with a slope of 
0.19% per month (=3.6%/19). When comparing the 43-month Study 003/005 
abaloparatide/alendronate ITT data to the 43-month extrapolated placebo, the K-M rate of NVF 
for the ITT analysis (excluding the two Czech sites), is 4.2% in the abaloparatide/ALN group at 
43 months vs 8.15% in the placebo group, RRR 48%, p=0.0102 using a Chi-squared test. 
Similarly, at 25 months, the abaloparatide/alendronate data vs extrapolated placebo, the K-M 
rate is 4.74 vs 2.4%, RRR 49%, p=0.0334 using a Chi-squared test. These results support the 
superiority of abaloparatide/alendronate over placebo alone at 43 months. 
 
The long-term and sequential therapy of abaloparatide/alendronate represents how the 
product will be used in real-world settings in line with current clinical recommendations and 
supports the clinical relevance of these data. The pivotal study demonstrates clear and 
consistent long-term efficacy in all important and clinically relevant primary and secondary 
endpoints, thus supporting a high degree of internal consistency of all efficacy parameters. 
  Conbriza (bazedoxifene) was approved in the EU in 2009 for use in treating postmenopausal 
women with osteoporosis at increased risk of fracture despite the absence of a statistically 
significant decrease of non-vertebral fractures at 3 years in the single pivotal study (the CHMP 
accepted non-statistically significant post hoc analyses in small subgroups of women at high 
risk of non-vertebral fracture as the demonstration of efficacy). As indicated above and in 
contrast to Conbriza, long-term abaloparatide/ALN data showed a statistically significant and 
clinically relevant reduction in NVF.  In any event, the Applicant cannot identify any valid basis 
for the CHMP to apply a different (or higher) regulatory standard to the application for 
abaloparatide. 
 
The CHMP identified no Major Objections regarding efficacy in the 3rd D180LoOIs and it was 
verbally stated by the Rapporteurs on two separate occasions (debrief discussion after the first 
Oral Explanation (OE) and at the start of the Ad-hoc Expert Group meeting) that efficacy was 
no longer an issue. Therefore, the applicant has proceeded on this basis. 
Ground #2: The reduction of the size of the studied population as result of the exclusion of 
the two Czech study sites negatively impacts the efficacy assessment. 
 
The exclusion of these two sites, as expected, led to a loss of statistical power for the ITT 
analyses of non-vertebral fractures. However, in line with the requirements of the EMA 
guideline on osteoporosis, long-term 25 and 43-month abaloparatide/alendronate (ALN) 
sequential therapy data showed statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions in 
non-vertebral fractures (NVF) (25 months, p=0.0244 and at 43 months, p=0.0237) in the pre-
specified Per Protocol (PP) population. Similar point estimates and statistical significance of the 
relative risk reduction of non-vertebral fractures were observed, irrespective of whether the 
two sites were removed from the analyses or not. 
 
The loss of study power did not change the direction of the treatment effect which remains 
consistently in favour of abaloparatide as compared with the control arm. Overall, the study 
results were robust in that similar findings were still observed in all important and clinically 
relevant efficacy endpoints relating to assessment of vertebral, non-vertebral, major non-
vertebral (as defined by the EMA), major osteoporotic and clinical fractures.

  While the applicant acknowledges it may be difficult for the CHMP to overcome an apparent 
continuing lack of confidence and trust in the trial data due to the GCP issues identified at sites 
131 and 132 in the Czech Republic, no similar issues were identified at other study sites in 
inspections by EMA and other health authorities or in extensive audits by the applicant, and the 
applicant therefore believes there is no basis for not  accepting the validity and objectivity of 
the study data from the remaining sites.  
Ground #3: The submitted single pivotal study is not sufficient to demonstrate efficacy. 
 
The single abaloparatide study included 680 patients/arm, i.e. 20% more than the 550 
patients/arm of the pivotal Phase 3 study of teriparatide (Forsteo) and was appropriately sized 
against the primary endpoint. 
  When considering the longer-term treatment effect at Month 25 (p=0.0244) and at Month 43 
(p=0.0237) based on abaloparatide/alendronate sequential therapy, highly statistically and 
clinically relevant reductions in non-vertebral fractures were observed in the pre-specified Per 
Protocol population. 
 
The study 003/005 met all 8 prerequisites for relying on one pivotal study according to the 
applicable EMA Guideline.  
  As a matter of consistency in applying the regulatory standard in the same therapeutic 
indication, the clinical efficacy of the most recently approved medicinal products indicated for 
treating postmenopausal osteoporosis (including denosumab, bazedoxifene and teriparatide) 
was based on a single pivotal Phase 3 study. The Applicant cannot identify any valid basis for 
abaloparatide to be treated differently. 
Safety (Marked post-injection increases in heart rate with abaloparatide were observed 
together with possibly related adverse events. The size of the pivotal trial, the applied 
exclusion criteria and the low number of serious cardiovascular events did not allow to 
assess sufficiently the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and proposed risk 
minimisation measures could not identify a reasonable target population) 
Ground #4: The study was too small, not powered to detect serious cardiovascular events 
and not considered sufficient to assess the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in a 
real-world osteoporosis population. 
 
The CHMP recognized that “no increase in major adverse cardiovascular events in patients 
treated with abaloparatide was noted compared to comparators”, as supported by extensive 
evaluation of the Study 003 (19-month) and Study 005 (long-term follow-up, 43-month) data. 
  Despite the observed transient heart rate increases, no meaningful adverse events were 
experienced, indicating a potential risk and not an identified risk for serious cardiovascular 
events. 
 
The long-term and sequential therapy of abaloparatide/alendronate representing how the 
product will be used in the real-world setting in line with current clinical recommendations 
identifies no clinically relevant safety concern.  
  Representative of the intended patient population in real-world settings, the pivotal Study 
003/005 did include 69% of patients at risk of cardiovascular disease (16% of patients with 
cardiac disorders and 58% of patients with vascular disorders [e.g. hypertension]), pre-
existing at baseline in the overall study population. These patients did not experience more 
cardiac adverse events during the 18 months of therapy with abaloparatide compared to those 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 129/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treated with teriparatide.  There was no bias in the comparative analysis as the majority of 
these patients (74% abaloparatide, 78% teriparatide and 76% of placebo patients) completed 
the initial 18-month treatment. Further, 90% of these prior abaloparatide-treated patients and 
89% of the prior placebo patients completed the 24-month extension study. 
 
The similarity in the distributions of maximal heart rate increases at 1-hour post dose between 
abaloparatide and teriparatide (95% overlap; p=0.146 indicating no difference in the 
distributions) should be considered as relevant to support the safety of abaloparatide given 
their overall comparability and the 15 years of post-market clinical safety experience with 
teriparatide. 
  Consistent with the pivotal study results, the cumulative 12-month US post-marketing safety 
results (7,267 patients treated with about 1,810 patient years of exposure to abaloparatide) 
demonstrate a safety profile consistent with the submitted safety data from the pivotal trial. 
The cumulative data support the conclusion that there are no new signals of cardiovascular 
(CV) risk associated with abaloparatide treatment. 
  As initially endorsed by the CHMP and PRAC, any uncertainties on the potential risk associated 
with the transiently increased heart rate with abaloparatide can be appropriately and 
effectively studied in a prospective observational comparative PASS. This approach is also 
consistent with the adopted EU Good Pharmacovigilance Practices relating to risk management. 
 
The abaloparatide safety database included more than 1200 patients. Any requirement for a 
larger pre-approval safety study would be inconsistent with the established regulatory standard 
for managing an identified and/or potential risk identified in pre-authorisation scientific 
evaluation (Note for Guidance on Population Exposure to Assess Clinical Safety).  
Ground #5: In light of an increased baseline risk of CV events in the postmenopausal 
osteoporosis patient population, a reasonable target population for abaloparatide could not 
be identified. 
 
To mitigate any possible risk, and consistent with the pivotal trial inclusion/exclusion criteria 
and the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Expert Group, the Applicant agreed that the most 
vulnerable patients (at highest risk of cardiovascular disease or with existing significant cardiac 
disorders) will be contraindicated in the SmPC. It follows that patients who are less susceptible 
to cardiovascular risk would thus be considered as the target patient population where 
abaloparatide can be used safely and effectively. 
  An analysis of the risk of MACE, done in compliance with the EU guideline, found an upper limit 
of hazard ratio of 3.37 at 19 months and of 2.13 at 43 months, which, in both cases, are lower 
than 4.92, the upper limit for teriparatide, a drug with a well-established CV safety profile and 
which shares with abaloparatide the same mechanism of heart rate increase and possible risk 
of CV safety. 
 
Patients who are prescribed with abaloparatide will be closely monitored for symptoms 
according to the recommendations in the SmPC.  
  During the oral explanation of March 2018, the applicant agreed to conduct a Drug Utilisation 
Study which will include measurement of the effectiveness of the above risk minimisation of CV 
risk. 
 
The Ad-hoc Expert Group meeting (14 March 2018) reported that, “The majority of the 
osteoporosis experts considered side effects manageable, in particular considering that as a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 130/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PTH-related osteoanabolic agent the length of treatment is limited to maximal total duration of 
18 months.” 
Ground #6: The proposed PASS was not taken into account in the negative opinion and in 
the last assessment reports. 
  As requested by the PRAC, the applicant agreed to conduct a PASS, PMC-TYM-002, to address 
the important potential ‘cardiovascular risks associated with a marked transient increase in 
heart rate following abaloparatide injection and long-term cardiovascular risk in vulnerable 
(predisposed) patients’.  
 
The PASS was initially endorsed by the CHMP and the PRAC, and a protocol was to be 
submitted by the applicant within 6 months of the Marketing Approval. 
 
The proposed PASS approach is consistently applied by EU regulatory authorities to assess 
specific safety concerns in newly approved medications. This approach was similarly applied to 
the centrally approved medicinal products for treatment of osteoporosis (Conbriza and Prolia), 
in line with the EU pharmacovigilance regulatory framework established since 2010. 
 
The proposed PASS is appropriately designed to ensure that it can be practically implemented 
to provide valuable comparative data on the relative safety of abaloparatide and teriparatide.  
Ground #7: The Benefit-Risk is therefore negative 
 
The pivotal study demonstrates clear and consistent, statistically significant and clinically 
relevant long-term (43-month) efficacy in all important primary and secondary endpoints, thus 
supporting a high degree of internal consistency of all efficacy parameters in the study. 
 
The observed effects on VF and NVF of abaloparatide and the sequential therapy of 
abaloparatide/ALN compare favourably to the alternative therapies, including denosumab, 
bazedoxifene, alendronate and other antiresorptive approved therapies. 
 
The safety of abaloparatide was demonstrated in a population that is representative of the 
real-world osteoporosis population in Europe, and is supported by the important, post-
authorisation safety data collected in the US (7,267 patients treated with about 1,810 patient 
years of exposure to abaloparatide) showing no particular safety signals of concern.  
  Collectively, the long-term efficacy and safety data shown in the sequential therapy of 
abaloparatide/alendronate represent how the product will be used according to current 
treatment recommendations, and support the statistically significant and clinically relevant 
efficacy that was maintained with no cardiovascular risks identified. 
 
The proposed risk minimisation measures and pharmacovigilance plan (PASS and drug 
utilization study) are appropriate to address the potential cardiovascular risk associated with a 
marked transient increase in heart rate. 
 
Taken together, the benefit-risk relationship should be considered positive. 
Report from the 2nd Ad Hoc expert Group meeting held on 10 July 2018 
Question 1 
Do you consider the efficacy sufficiently established in the applied indication based on the 
provided data? Moreover, how do you view the supportive value of the PP population results 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 131/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as primary analysis as well as the results at 43 months in the ITT population based on the 
linear extrapolation model for the application? 
Although  this  application  is  based  on  a  single  study  only,  the  18-  month  Phase  3  study  BA058-003 
ACTIVE  study,  the  experts  were  of  the  view  that  efficacy  of  treatment  with  abaloparatide  over  18 
months regarding the incidence of new radiologically detected vertebral fractures was demonstrated in 
the  pivotal  study  (abaloparatide  0.51%  vs.  placebo  4.2%;  the  absolute  risk  reduction  in  the 
abaloparatide  treated  group  compared  to  placebo  was  3.65  (95%  CI:  2.00;5.59  ;  p<0.0001).  The 
osteoporosis  experts  considered  demonstration  of  such  an  effect  on  vertebral  fractures  as  highly 
relevant  for  an  osteoporosis  product.    The  extension  study  BA058-05-005  was  considered  supportive 
by the experts. 
With regards to the efficacy for non-vertebral  fractures, the  majority  of the experts were of the view 
that,  even  though  the  pivotal  study  failed  to  demonstrate  a  statistically  significant  effect  on  non-
vertebral  fractures  versus  placebo  (abaloparatide  2.2%  vs.  placebo  3.1%),  relevant  effects  on  major 
osteoporotic  fractures,  BMD  (total  hip,  femoral  neck,  lumbar  spine)  and  biomarkers  were 
demonstrated.  While  the  study  was  not  designed  for  direct  in-  study  comparison  with  teriparatide, 
similarities of the mechanism of action might allow some extrapolation. Therefore, taking together  all 
the  data  and  from  a  clinical  perspective,  the  majority  of  experts  was  of  the  view  that  an  effect  of 
abaloparatide on reduction of non-vertebral fractures is expected. The data on BMD would support this. 
The methodology expert was not favouring this approach and was of the view that the current data are 
not robust to establish a positive effect on reduction of non-vertebral fractures. 
Reservations were expressed regarding the use of the PP population because of selection risk and the 
use of the linear extrapolation model (for placebo) was also questioned. 
Question 2 
With regard to the observed heart rate increase upon administration of abaloparatide, do 
you consider that: 
a.  the HR measured at one hour post-dose represents the relevant value to 
discuss a potential safety issue or are other time-points post-dose better 
suited? 
b.  do you consider the observed HR increase to infer a potential safety risk for 
the target population? 
If so,  
i.  can you envision an osteoporosis patient population in which this 
would not be the case and how can the patients be described?  
ii.  do you consider that the proposed risk minimisation measures and the 
cardio-vascular contra-indications to adequately address the safety 
risk associated with the HR increase? 
iii.  how do you view the potential CV risk associated with heart rate 
increase of abaloparatide compared to teriparatide? 
2.a. Overall, the experts considered HR measurement within one hour post-dose (as was done in the 
clinical study) to be an appropriate timepoint. They discussed as well 15 minutes as a first timepoint.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 132/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In contrast, one expert even questioned the need of systematic HR measurement at all. 
2.b. The observed increase in heart rate could possibly infer a safety risk to certain groups of patients, 
such as patients who have pre-existing heart disease. 
The cardiology experts referred to some of the animal data presented by the applicant at the current 
expert meeting, where the applicant explained that (at least) part of the HR response is due to a direct 
effect  on  the  sinus  node.  This  chronotropic  effect  together  with  a  vasodilation  effect  as  the  main 
underlying  MoA  for  the  increase  in  HR  with  abaloparatide,  reassured  the  experts  with  regards  to  a 
potential  safety  risk.  The  experts  are  of  the  view  that  the  proposed  contraindications  which  exclude 
certain groups of patients where increased heart rate may infer a safety risk are important and could 
be considered reassuring.  The osteoporosis experts as well found the explanation on the mechanism 
of action for the observed heart rate increase reassuring. The lack of CV safety signals from the pivotal 
study was considered reassuring, although due to the very small number of MACE events these results 
should be interpreted with caution.  
It  was  acknowledged  that  the  data  from  the  randomised  trial  represent  a  selected  (more  healthy) 
population;  a  PASS  study  would  be  useful  to  provide  information  on  real-word  patients  (e.g.  elderly 
patient on multiple medications) 
i. The target population could be described by a list of contraindications to exclude patients for whom 
increased heart rate may pose a safety risk. 
ii.  The  experts  believe  that  risk  minimisation  measures  as  proposed  in  the  product  information  (4.3 
contraindications and 4.4 Special precautions and warnings for use), would address the potential safety 
risk associated with HR increase. 
The experts found a screening of heart rate (within 1 hour after first administration of abaloparatide), 
as  described  in  the  SmPC,  a  reasonable  proposal.  This  should  allow  capturing  those  patients  with  a 
relevant  increase  of  the  HR.  One  expert  mentioned  that  for  some  patients  HR  increase  may  appear 
later (i.e. not after the first administration) though; those patients may be offered HR /ECG screening, 
on a as needed basis, at the time when tachycardia symptoms are reported. 
iii.  The  experts  considered  that  the  potential  CV  risk  associated  with  increased  heart  rate  could  be 
expected to be somewhat similar, to a certain extent, for abaloparatide and teriparatide.  
However, they pointed out that uncertainties remain and a greater potential of an increased CV risk for 
abaloparatide  exists.  In  the  pivotal  study,  the  1-hour  post-dose  heart  rate  increased  more  in  the 
abaloparatide  treated  patients  compared  to  teriparatide.  Also  associated  adverse  events  such  as 
palpitations,  tachycardia,  dizziness,  nausea  and  discontinuations  due  to  adverse  events  were  also 
reported  more  frequently  in  the  abaloparatide  than  in  the  teriparatide  study  arm.  The  open-label 
design  of  the  teriparatide  makes  it  difficult  to  interpret  the  comparison  between  the  two  treatment 
groups.

Question 3 
Please discuss to what extent the results from the post marketing setting and from the 
planned PASS obtained in the US are relevant for the EU patients. This should include, but 
need not be limited to the following topics:  
a.  Is the anticipated EU population the same as the one that would currently use 
teriparatide?  
b.  Is their risk of CV events comparable to the EU target population? 
There was support for a Drug Utilisation Study in particular since this could provide useful information 
on the EU and US populations and could inform the design of the PASS study. 
It is expected that the EU and US patient population is different based on differences in availability of 
healthcare and reimbursement.  A further difference in the risk of CV events is expected from the fact 
that the abaloparatide US label contains no CV contraindications. 
 Therefore  the  experts  call  for  a  PASS  sized  to  have  adequate  participation  from  both  a  US  and  a 
European population. 
The experts recommended to ensure the inclusion of sufficient frail and elderly patients.   
The  experts  discussed  the  appropriate  comparator  in  the  PASS.  Teriparatide  and  denosumab  were 
mentioned  to obtain  more  comparable populations,  but  there  was  no  conclusion  regarding  this  point. 
One expert voiced concern that there is considerable GP use of denosumab in rather mild osteoporosis. 
Other comments 
One  patient  representative  made  a  call  for  the  applicant  to  collect  information  on  patient  reported 
outcome/QoL parameters.  In particular the effect on pain relief was mentioned. 
The  experts  did  not  raise  further  comments  on  the  grounds  for  refusal  adopted  by  the  CHMP  in  its 
opinion of March 2018).  
Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination  
The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the 
applicant and considered the views of the Ad Hoc Expert Group.  
Efficacy 
Ground #1: Failure to demonstrate a statistically significant effect on non-vertebral 
fractures as required by the osteoporosis guideline, and ground #3: The submitted single 
pivotal study is not sufficient to demonstrate efficacy. 
After exclusion of the two CZ trial sites due to GCP non-compliance, corresponding to a reduction of 
the study population by 16%, results of the key secondary endpoint, NVF (time to fracture event, 
abaloparatide vs placebo), were not statistically significant. Although there is a clear trend supporting 
efficacy of abaloparatide on NVF, the pre-specified analysis of NVF did not reach statistical significance. 
The Applicant argued that for assessment of abaloparatide´s efficacy on NVF one should consider the 
results of the extension trial -005 at 25 and 43 months, and specifically results in the Per Protocol (PP) 
population (rather than the ITT population). These analyses suggested a significant difference in NVF 
rate between the abaloparatide/alendronate and the placebo/alendronate group and several arguments 
were provided by the Applicant why this would be most appropriate.  However, using the PP population 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 134/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for the primary analysis of NVFs, as well as the extrapolation model for the placebo arm of the studies, 
was found to be not acceptable to CHMP, for the following reasons: 
ITT and Per Protocol (PP) Populations in Study 003/005: Considerations regarding the choice of the 
primary analysis population are described in ICH-E9 and pre-specified in the clinical study protocols 
and statistical analysis plans. The PP population in Study 005 included only 444/688 (64.5%) of the 
subjects in 003’s placebo group, and 436/696 (62.6%) in the abaloparatide group. Therefore, 
important patient selection has likely occurred, both due to patients not entering Study 005 and due to 
patients with protocol deviations during Study 005. Although it can be said that “the PP approach 
provides an estimate of the true treatment efficacy”, this is not an acceptable conservative method to 
analyse the treatment effect in a superiority trial. The PP analysis uses data of compliant and 
completing patients and usually overestimates the efficacy in comparison to the ITT analysis. Both 
according to the relevant guideline and according to the pre-specified analysis plans, the confirmatory 
analysis for the secondary endpoint of NVF should be based on the (m)ITT population. PP analyses 
were pre-specified, but as supportive analyses. The switch to the PP population is considered post-hoc 
and possibly data-driven and introduces significant selection of the population. As a consequence, the 
use of the PP population is not acceptable. Claims for superiority with regard to efficacy for NVFs were 
therefore not supported by CHMP. In addition, the lack of consistency between the ITT and PP analyses 
results reflects negatively upon the internal consistency of the trial results in the context of a single 
pivotal trial. 
Extrapolation: The Applicant chose a design that included a control treatment that was a hybrid 
between placebo and active, even during the period up to 24 months where efficacy should be 
established according to the guideline. In such an analysis, there is no conservative approach to 
account for the effect of the active controlled phase in the study in the statistical analysis. This is 
considered an important weakness in the design of the pivotal trial. In the context of a single pivotal 
trial, e.g. by introducing the linear extrapolation, deviating from the predefined statistical analysis is 
also not acceptable. 
Efficacy comparison with EU-approved products: The applicant submitted a cross-trial comparison of 
clinical efficacy (trial population, BMD, vertebral fractures and non-vertebral fractures) versus EU 
approved medicinal products of which the interpretation is challenging. The CHMP considered that such 
a comparison had severe limitations, such as changing clinical practice over the long time span 
covered, different baseline characteristics and different analysis populations (PP v ITT). 
Length of study: The scientific advice for the product stated that treatment duration in the pivotal trial 
should be (at least) 24 months. While it is agreed with the applicant that a treatment strategy of 18 
months for an anabolic agent followed by anti-resorptive treatment could be reasonable, and may be 
the usage scenario in clinical practice, the applicant designed the prolongation of the study beyond 18 
months as an extension trial to obtain data at 25 months. Not all participants from trial 003 continued 
in trial 005 and in this way uncertainty is introduced regarding which of many analyses would be most 
important. The 25 months analysis is not described in the SAP as the main assessment to be used for 
the MAA. Moreover, data from the extension of the trial beyond 18 months has several other 
limitations outlined in various sections of this report. 
Single trial: As mentioned in the CHMP points to consider guideline on clinical development, submission 
with only one pivotal study should be the exceptional case. A single pivotal study has to be particularly 
compelling with respect to internal and external validity, clinical relevance, statistical significance, data 
quality and internal consistency. Moreover, scientific advice recommended that compelling results 
should be provided both for VF and NVF, preferably as co-primary endpoints, in line with the guideline 
on evaluation of products for the treatment of osteoporosis, considering  the clinical importance of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 135/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NVF, in particular of the hip. By contrast, the pivotal trial was small, lacked compelling effect on NVF 
and only one event of hip fracture did occur, and did only include relatively healthy ambulatory 
postmenopausal woman. 
Comparison with teriparatide: The applicant argued that abaloparatide and teriparatide have similar 
structures and mechanism of action, and that the totality of the comparison of abaloparatide and 
teriparatide provided support that both drugs reduce similarly the risks of new vertebral and 
nonvertebral fracture in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and that these data also support 
the long-term efficacy of the sequential use of abaloparatide followed by alendronate in this 
population. In conclusion the applicant is of the opinion that the established benefit of teriparatide can 
be used to support the abaloparatide results. This reasoning can be accepted as hypothesis-generating 
only, as no formal equivalence or non-inferiority analysis was performed. Trial 003 was a trial in which 
two active agents were compared to placebo. There were no predefined confirmatory objectives for 
comparison of abaloparatide with teriparatide and no non-inferiority or equality margins were 
predefined, therefore the study was not designed to detect equality or differences. Moreover, unlike 
abaloparatide and placebo, teriparatide was used in a non-blinded fashion. Therefore, these data are 
considered of exploratory, but not of confirmatory quality. Specifically, the claim that efficacy with 
abaloparatide and teriparatide would be “similar” cannot be accepted based on these data. 
BMD data were generally supportive of efficacy for both vertebral and non-vertebral fracture efficacy, 
but these data are considered of supportive nature only. 
BMD data and fractures were analysed in multiple other ways (e.g. responder analyses) in the study 
reports and these additional analyses were considered of exploratory nature. 
Reference is made by the applicant to previous marketing authorisations for products for the treatment 
of osteoporosis; however, data provided, the level of efficacy demonstrated, safety concerns identified 
etc. do not allow direct comparison and each application is assessed independently. 
Based on the totality of the data, the majority of experts at the AHEG meeting on 10 July 2018 were of 
the view that an effect of abaloparatide on reduction of non-vertebral fractures could be expected; 
however, considering the deficiencies of the NVF data outlined above, and further considering the 
limited value of supporting evidence  from surrogate endpoints such as changes in BMD and serum 
markers of bone metabolism, CHMP considered that a robust positive effect on reduction of non-
vertebral fractures has not been established.  
The CHMP’s overall view on efficacy, taking into account the grounds for re-examination, is 
summarised in the B/R section on favourable effects (section 6.2). 
Ground #2: The reduction of the size of the studied population as result of the exclusion of 
the two Czech study sites negatively impacts the efficacy assessment. 
The CHMP has decided that the trial’s data can be used for the purpose of the MAA, after exclusion of 
the two sites where serious GCP non-compliance was reported by SUKL, the Czech Health Authority, 
mainly related to inclusion/exclusion data. All scientific conclusions of the CHMP from the pivotal trial 
made therefore unrestricted use of the full data set after exclusion of those sites. The validity and 
objectivity of the study data from the remaining sites was not questioned in the initial opinion adopted 
by the CHMP and is not being questioned in the present re-examination opinion.  
However, the fact remains that CHMP in its analyses and conclusions had to rely on a smaller sized 
data set from the pivotal trial compared to the data set initially submitted by the company, which may 
have negatively impacted on the demonstration of (statistically) significant effect of certain outcomes, 
namely efficacy with regard to NVFs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018

Safety 
Ground #4: The study was too small, not powered to detect serious cardiovascular events 
and not considered sufficient to assess the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in a 
real-world osteoporosis population. 
From a regulatory standards point of view, the total number of study participants exposed to 
abaloparatide in the pivotal study, after the exclusion of 2 study sites, was lower than expected by ICH 
standards of ca. 1500 (Note for Guidance on Population Exposure to Assess Clinical Safety 
(CPMP/ICH/375/95). 
Heart rate increase: In the QTc study the highest effect on pulse rate was seen at 15 minutes after the 
injection. As this was also the first time-point for which data are presented, the maximum increase in 
heart rate may not have been recorded.. With regard to the pivotal study, at 1 hour post dose the 
highest change in pulse rate has already passed and the 1-hour post dose data are not representative 
of the maximum change in heart rate, which remains uncertain.   Moreover, the effect on HR remained 
appreciable over 12 hours. 
Major adverse cardiac events in the pivotal study: The applicant was asked to present additional 
analyses of the study data to provide analyses for MACE and MACE + Heart Failure (regardless of 
hospitalisation) for study 003 and study 003/005. The included events were collected routinely as 
adverse events during the clinical trials but were not adjudicated. The number of events and the 
confidence intervals are summarised in the effects table (see below). This analysis did not indicate CV 
harm with abaloparatide treatment as compared to placebo with regard to MACE. The analysis of MACE 
+ Heart Failure showed a decrease in MACE or heart failure events in the abaloparatide treated 
patients versus placebo in Study 003. However, the study was not designed to detect CV events other 
than those reported by the investigator in routine monitoring. Major limitations of these analyses are in 
particular the lack of adjudication and the different drop-out rates of the various strata prior to the 
possibility of a MACE, possibly due to symptoms linked to heart rate increase, thus potentially 
introducing bias favouring abaloparatide. Moreover, due to the size and the exclusion criteria regarding 
CV risk factors, the number of events in the pivotal study was too small to assess such MACE events 
adequately. Therefore, this study is not considered sufficient in order to assess the risk for adverse 
cardiovascular outcomes associated with HR increases in a real-life osteoporosis population generally 
more vulnerable regarding cardiovascular risk. 
In comparison to teriparatide, based on results of study 003, AEs of palpitations (abaloparatide, 5.6%; 
teriparatide, 1.7%) and tachycardia (abaloparatide 1.3%; teriparatide, 0.4%) occurred more often 
with abaloparatide; both AEs occurred less frequently in the placebo group (palpitations, 0.4%; 
tachycardia, 0.3%). With regard to numerical increases of heart rate, results were also different. Only 
few serious cardiac-related events were observed, which seems to confirm that the population was not 
so frail. 
Presented post-authorisation data from the use of abaloparatide in the US between May 2017 and 
January 2018 was acknowledged by CHMP, but was considered of very limited value to exclude CV 
harm (in line with the view of the AHEG convened on 1 March 2018), as from those observational data 
it is difficult to exclude an increase in MACE and differences with the EU population may also be 
important.

The pivotal trial had several exclusion criteria to exclude CV risks: At inclusion for trial 003, resting 12-
lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during screening should not show clinically significant abnormality and 
should have a QTc ≤470 msec (Bazett’s correction). Systolic blood pressure was to be ≥100 and ≤155 
mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥40 and ≤95 mmHg, and the heart rate ≥45 and ≤100 beats per 
minute (bpm) (sitting or supine). In this population no relations were found between (any remaining) 
cardiac history, serious adverse events and increase in pulse rate. As no risk factors for (potential) 
adverse consequences of heart rate increase were identified, it is difficult to assess the additional value 
of any proposed risk minimisation measures. 
Overall, the patients enrolled in Study 003 were underrepresented with regard to pre-existing heart 
disease and were not fully representative of the European population of osteoporotic postmenopausal 
women receiving osteoporosis medications. The single pivotal trial was not considered sufficient in 
order to assess the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with HR increases in a real-life 
osteoporosis population. 
Ground #5: In light of an increased baseline risk of CV events in the postmenopausal 
osteoporosis patient population, a reasonable target population for abaloparatide could not 
be identified. 
The population defined in the proposed SmPC section 4.1 was a general osteoporosis population 
(‘treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture’). In clinical use, 
abaloparatide could have been expected to have a similar place as teriparatide, which is second line. 
However, the pivotal trial included almost no patients with bisphosphonate pre-treatment. Also, the 
second line positioning would likely be associated with extensive co-morbidities (including 
cardiovascular disease) which the applicant considered as exclusion criteria for their clinical trial, 
although contraindications in the SmPC were proposed to that regard. As osteoporosis is a risk factor 
for CV disease, a somewhat higher risk of MACE than in the general population might be expected. 
Overall, this means that the study population is not representing the proposed target population, 
questioning external validity of the trial results. 
With regard to the significance of the MACE results, see assessment of ground #4. 
With regard to the proposed risk mitigation measures and the PASS proposed by the applicant, see 
assessment of ground #6. 
The majority of osteoporosis experts at the AHEG of 1 March 2018 considered indeed side effects 
manageable; however, this concerned the short term symptoms after injection. 
Ground #6: The proposed PASS was not taken into account in the negative opinion and in 
the last assessment reports. 
The proposed PASS was considered and taken into account by CHMP.  
The choice of comparator was found to be problematic; for instance for teriparatide, while an approved 
indication might be similar in the US and the EU, its real world use could be different. 
The applicant proposed a Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) to further characterise the 
cardiovascular risk profile among new users of abaloparatide. The proposed PASS has limitations 
compared to a randomised, prospective trial: Full characterisation at baseline of the included patients 
is not possible as a consequence of its design; moreover, even propensity scores cannot fully address 
potential confounding by indication. The gold standard for post-authorisation assessment of CV risks 
has been set in the field of diabetes and includes a randomised, prospective trial. In this respect, the 
design of the proposed PASS would not match the standard set for the proposed aim albeit in a 
Assessment report

different therapeutic area. As a consequence the interpretability of the results would likely have been 
very challenging.  
The foreseen accrual of patients in the EU was considered low in comparison to US patients, 
considering likely differences in usage and population, with a rather long timeline to complete these 
studies.  
No risk factors for adverse effects of the increased pulse rate were identified during the procedure. 
Therefore, no specific measures are or can be proposed to mitigate this risk. 
The experts of the AHEG on 1 March 2018 welcomed in principle the conduct of such a PASS, would 
the product have been authorised, and were of the view that risk minimisation measures as proposed 
in the product information could address the potential safety risk associated with HR increase. CHMP 
has considered the AHEG advice and recommendations. However, the evidence confirming or excluding 
consequences for the patient of the pharmacologically induced temporary increases in pulse rate for 
potentially > 50% of the time during 1.5 years is scarce, and the AHEG did not eliminate uncertainties 
on the safety of the product sufficiently (see also assessment of ground #4).  
The  CHMP’s  overall  view on  safety is  summarised  in the  B/R section on  unfavourable  effects  (section 
6.4). 
Ground #7: The Benefit-Risk is therefore negative. 
With regard to the individual points raised by the applicant in this section, please see the previous 
sections covering the assessment of the grounds presented by the applicant regarding efficacy and 
safety aspects.  
CHMP’s overall assessment of the benefit-risk of abaloparatide following re-examination is provided in 
section 6 of this report. 
5.1.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP and PRAC, having considered the data submitted in the application for re-examination of the 
CHMP opinion of 22 March 2018, was of the opinion that due to the concerns identified with this 
application, the updated risk management plan version 1.5 cannot be agreed at this stage. 
6.  Benefit-risk balance following re-examination 
6.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Abaloparatide subcutaneous daily injection was intended for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis 
in order to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and consequently reduce the risk of vertebral and 
non-vertebral fractures.  
In Europe, 22 million women and 5.5 million men were estimated to have osteoporosis in 2010; and 
3.5 million new osteoporotic fractures were sustained. Most fractures occur at the spine, wrist and hip. 
The vast majority of osteoporotic fractures occur in postmenopausal women and the incidence 
increases markedly with age. 
As regards anti-osteoporotic treatment for the reduction of the risk of osteoporotic fractures the 
majority of options aim at anti-resorptive properties while therapeutic options to increase new bone

formation and BMD with a bone anabolic agent are limited. Abaloparatide is a synthetic, 34 amino acid 
analogue of PTHrP(1-34) which belongs to the same class as teriparatide (approved for the treatment 
of postmenopausal osteoporosis in the EU in 2003) and stimulates the production and activity of 
osteoblasts, increasing BMD by building new bone.  
Disease or condition 
A definition from 1993 states osteoporosis is a “disease characterised by low bone mass and micro-
architectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to enhanced bone fragility and a consequent increase 
in fracture risk”. A more recent definition from the NIH Consensus Development Panel on Osteoporosis 
defines osteoporosis as a skeletal disorder characterised by compromised bone strength predisposing a 
person to an increased risk of fracture (Szulc & Bouxsein, 2010). 
Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The primary aim of pharmacological treatment is the reduction of the risk of osteoporotic fractures. 
Currently, there are two therapeutic approaches for the treatment of osteoporosis; one is to decrease 
bone loss with an anti-resorptive drug and the other is to increase new bone formation and BMD with a 
bone anabolic therapy. Anti-resorptive agents are e.g. oestrogens and selective oestrogen receptor 
modulators, anti-RANK ligand antibodies, and bisphosphonates. They inhibit the bone-resorbing 
activity of osteoclasts while an anabolic therapy like teriparatide in contrast stimulates the production 
and activity of osteoblasts, increasing BMD by building new bone. 
Main clinical studies 
The basis for the MAA of abaloparatide-SC is the 18 months pivotal Phase 3 study BA058-05-003 
(ACTIVE study) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The clinical efficacy and safety of daily 
80 μg abaloparatide SC was studied in comparison to a matched placebo and an open-label active 
control daily teriparatide 20 μg SC. A total of 2070 patients were randomised into three treatment 
arms of approximately 690 patients in each group. The 18 months treatment period was followed by 
extension study BA058-05-005, where a total of 963 patients who previously received placebo (n=494) 
or abaloparatide (n=469) received 18 months of alendronate therapy. 
Based on the deviations found during the GCP inspections at two sites in Czech Republic of study 
BA058-05-003, data from these two sites cannot be used when assessing the marketing authorisation 
application and, consequently only endpoints and information excluding data from those two sites were 
the basis for the benefit-risk evaluation.  
6.2.  Favourable effects 
Abaloparatide administered at a dose of 80 µg SC daily over up to 18 months significantly reduced the 
risk of experiencing new vertebral fractures compared to placebo in postmenopausal women; the 
active comparator teriparatide also showed a significant reduction in the incidence of new vertebral 
fractures compared to placebo in this population. New vertebral fractures (mainly non-clinical) 
occurred in 3 (0.5%) patients treated with abaloparatide, in 25 (4.2%) patients on placebo, and in 4 
(0.7%) patients on teriparatide. The absolute risk reduction in the abaloparatide treated group 
compared to placebo was 3.65, (95% CI: 2.00; 5.59) (p<0.0001).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 140/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the extension study BA058-05-005, when both former abaloparatide and former placebo patients 
were treated with alendronate, benefit in the former abaloparatide group was preserved. At 25 months 
after the start of trial 003, new patients with vertebral fractures were for abaloparatide 2 (0.44%) 
versus placebo 21 (4.29%). The absolute risk reduction versus placebo (95% CI) was 3.86 (95% CI: 
2.00; 6.06). At 43 months after the start of trial 003, new patients with vertebral fractures were for 
abaloparatide 4 (0.88%) versus placebo 26 (5.32%). The absolute risk reduction versus placebo (95% 
CI) was 4.44 (95% CI: 2.30; 6.86). A statistically significant reduction of major osteoporotic fractures 
was seen for abaloparatide vs placebo at all time points (19, 25 and 43 months).  
The percent changes in BMD at total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine from baseline to 18 month 
were statistically significantly higher with abaloparatide compared to placebo and the results 
demonstrate a relevant increase in BMD in patients on abaloparatide; teriparatide also increased BMD 
from baseline to 18 months at all three sites. The advantage for former abaloparatide-treated patients 
remained, when all patients were switched to alendronate in extension study BA058-05-005 up to 43 
months. BMD increased earlier with abaloparatide compared to teriparatide, indicating earlier onset of 
effect.  
Percent changes in the anabolic serum bone marker s-P1NP were higher for abaloparatide versus 
placebo at all time-points, while the increase with teriparatide was higher than with abaloparatide from 
3 months onwards. The bone resorption marker s-CTX showed a transient increase for abaloparatide 
versus placebo from 3 to 12 months and increases in s-CTX were highest with teriparatide. Activities of 
BALP and s-osteocalcin were higher with abaloparatide versus placebo and highest in participants using 
teriparatide. 
Fracture probabilities at baseline (FRAX analysis) calculated from the data from study BA058-05-003 
were estimated to be low compared to several other phase 3 studies in patients with osteoporosis but 
for example similar to that seen in clinical trials of bazedoxifene. Fracture probabilities increased with 
age. Baseline characteristics of fracture probabilities for patients recruited to the extension study 
BA058-05-005 did not differ from the population of study BA058-05-003. Hazard ratios for the effect of 
abaloparatide on the various fracture outcomes did not change significantly across the range of 
baseline fracture probability, suggesting significant efficacy over the whole range.  
6.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In contrast to the CHMP guideline on osteoporosis requiring in general a duration of treatment in the 
pivotal phase 3 trials for a new osteoporotic medicinal product of at least 24 months in order to 
provide clear fracture and bone safety data, the Applicant has provided only a total duration of 
18 months of treatment in the single phase 3 study, with a separate extension study without 
abaloparatide treatment. The chosen design has several deficiencies, among them that patients on 
teriparatide have not been offered to participate in the extension study and that the continuation in the 
extension study might have introduced a selection bias to the data beyond 18 months of treatment.  
In trial 003, the active comparator teriparatide was not blinded due to commercial availability of 
teriparatide. Discontinuation and the percentage of patients with no post-treatment x-ray were 
significantly different between groups; discontinuation was highest with abaloparatide and lowest with 
teriparatide and the percentage of patients with no post-treatment x-ray was higher in patients on 
abaloparatide compared to both placebo and teriparatide. 
GCP related serious findings lead to exclusion of two study sites in the single pivotal study, reducing 
the total study population by 16% from 2463 to 2070 participants. All assessments in this report were 
therefore based on this smaller subset of study participants. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018

The efficacy of abaloparatide compared to placebo on non-vertebral fractures did not reach 
statistical significance (for the number of NVFs see effects table, below). During the re-examination, 
the Applicant presented data from the per protocol analysis of the non-vertebral fractures and from an 
analysis in which placebo data for non-vertebral fractures were extrapolated for the extension study 
over 18 months. While these analyses did provide statistically significant results, in line with the 
experts at the AHEG meeting on 10 July 2018 who expressed reservations to the use of the PP 
population and the use of the linear extrapolation model, these analyses were considered only as 
secondary analyses by CHMP. 
Furthermore, the analysis of the key secondary endpoint non-vertebral fracture was changed in the 
statistical analysis plan that was finalised two days prior to database lock and further changes to the 
analysis were introduced after database lock, including changes of the definition of the key secondary 
endpoint (upon a request of the US FDA); usually, it is expected that changes to principle features of 
the analysis are documented in a protocol amendment rather than only in the statistical analysis plan.  
The time to first incidence of other fractures defined as clinical fracture, major osteoporotic fracture, 
wrist fracture, non-vertebral fracture including any level of trauma, and clinical spine fracture was 
numerically increased for abaloparatide compared to teriparatide but differences were considered to be 
of unclear relevance.  
The relevance of differences in changes in serum bone markers and their relation to differences in the 
reduction of fracture risk between abaloparatide and teriparatide remain unclear. 
Based on the totality of the data, the majority of experts at the AHEG meeting on 10 July 2018 were of 
the view that an effect of abaloparatide on reduction of non-vertebral fractures could be expected. 
However, concerns with the level of evidence were raised, in particular from a methodological point of 
view from the NVF data, and further considering the limited value of supporting evidence from 
surrogate endpoints such as changes in BMD and serum markers of bone metabolism, CHMP considers 
that a robust positive effect on reduction of non-vertebral fractures has not been established.  
6.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Relevant differences were seen in the incidences of the adverse events such as palpitations 
(abaloparatide, teriparatide, placebo: 5.6%, 1.7%, and 0.4%, respectively), nausea (8.5%, 5.4%, and 
3.1%, respectively) and dizziness (11.1%, 8.2%, and 7.1%, respectively). Also the incidence of 
orthostatic hypotension, defined as a composite adverse event of special interest, was higher on 
abaloparatide than on teriparatide or placebo treatments (28.4%, 19.8%, and 14.4%, respectively). 
The adverse event dizziness showed also a dose-dependent effect in patients treated with 
abaloparatide (20 μg, 40 μg, 80 μg: 0%, 9%, and 11%, respectively). 
Hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria evaluated as composite Adverse Events of Special Interest occurred 
less frequently in patients on abaloparatide (2.2%, 14.3%) than on teriparatide (4.8%, 17.6%) but 
more often than on placebo (0.6%, 11.1%); the incidence of hypercalcaemia adverse events increased 
with decreasing baseline renal function (CrCl ≥90 ml/min, ≥60 <90 ml/min, <60 ml/min: 0.6%, 1.9%, 
1.9%).  
There were no significant differences between abaloparatide, teriparatide, and placebo in adverse 
events leading to death and serious adverse events.  
In general the highest incidences of adverse events as well as differences between groups were seen 
within the first 2 months of treatment; differences were no longer apparent from 6 months onwards.

Abaloparatide injection is followed by an increase in heart rate. In study BA058-05-003, abaloparatide 
and teriparatide markedly increased heart rate measured 1 hour post injection compared to placebo; 
the highest increase in heart rate may have occurred earlier. The highest measured effect on pulse 
rate was at 15 minutes after the injection in male and female healthy volunteers in the QTc study. In 
study BA058-05-003, the mean increases from baseline in the abaloparatide group ranged between 
6.9 and 7.8 bpm from day 1 to month 12. For teriparatide, the mean increases in heart rate post-dose 
were lower, between 5.5 to 6.7 bpm from day 1 to month 12, and for placebo, the mean increases 
post-injection were 1.0 to 1.9 bpm. Overall, 7.9%, 3.6%, and 0.7% of patients on abaloparatide, 
teriparatide, and placebo, respectively, had an increase (pre- to 1h post dose) in heart rate >25 bpm 
at any time. About 20% of patients on abaloparatide experienced an increase in HR by >20 bpm at 
any time point ; only patients on treatment with abaloparatide experienced maximal HR increases by 
more than 40 bpm and there was even a single case were the maximal increase in heart rate was >50 
bpm. These observations were paralleled by a higher rate in cardiac related TEAEs in the abaloparatide 
group than in the teriparatide or the placebo group, primarily due to palpitations and tachycardia.  
In line with the findings in the pivotal study BA058-05-003, marked post-injection increases in heart 
rate for abaloparatide were observed in male and female healthy volunteers in the thorough QT-study 
BA058-05-012. A mean increase of 14.6 bpm was noted 15 min after the therapeutic dose of 80 µg vs. 
0.1 bpm in the placebo group. Because the first post-dose measurement was also the highest, the 
maximum increase may have been missed. Mean increases of 9.5 bpm in the abaloparatide group were 
seen 1 h post-dose. Significant increases in heart rate seem to persist at least 12 h (mean 9.5 bpm in 
the abaloparatide group vs. 7.3 bpm in the placebo group). The heart rate had almost returned to 
baseline and was comparable to placebo at 24 h, i.e. the proposed time point for the next injection in a 
clinical setting.  
AEs associated with the SOC cardiac disorders were reported more frequently in the abaloparatide 
group (12%) compared to placebo (5%) and teriparatide (6%). The difference between groups was 
driven by higher incidences of palpitations and tachycardia in the abaloparatide group.  
Orthostatic hypotension, defined as a decrease in SBP of ≥20 mmHg from supine to standing or in DBP 
of ≥10 mmHg from supine to standing 1 hour post-dose, was reported in all treatment groups (7 AEs 
in abaloparatide, 4 in placebo and 3 in teriparatide). 
About half of the patients developed anti-abaloparatide antibodies and about one third neutralising 
antibodies; antibody titres declined during the extension period on alendronate, but remained high. For 
teriparatide an antibody rate of 2.8% is given in the SPC and of about 4% in the EPAR. The limited 
data did not indicate an influence of the development of anti-abaloparatide antibodies as well as 
neutralising antibodies on the efficacy or safety of abaloparatide.  
The thorough QT study yielded data which fulfilled the criterion for a negative QT study. 
6.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety data for abaloparatide are limited to an exposure of 18 months in comparison to open-label 
teriparatide and blinded placebo plus 24 months of open-label follow-up on alendronate without 
comparator for patients who finished the base study and were treated with either abaloparatide or 
placebo; no follow-up of patients previously on teriparatide is available although this might have 
delivered important information for the safety evaluation.  
Extent and duration of exposure do not allow an assessment of rare adverse events or adverse events 
with late onset including carcinogenicity and long-term cardiovascular adverse effects.

There is substantial epidemiologic information concerning the relationship between heart rate and 
cardiovascular disease. Generally, these studies show that chronic elevations of heart rate can be 
associated with the development or worsening of cardiovascular disorders but whether this is due to 
confounding or whether an increase in heart rate is a risk factor in itself is not clear. Furthermore, the 
epidemiological studies investigated the association of cardiovascular risk with overall mean heart rate 
and not with daily, pharmacologically induced transient increases in heart rate. Uncertainty remained 
regarding the clinical implications of the observed heart rate increases with abaloparatide. The 
applicant provided information pointing to both a positive chronotropic effect directly on the sinus node 
of the heart as well as a vasodilatory effect on smooth muscle to be relevant for the mechanism of 
action for the increase in heart rate caused by abaloparatide. While this was found to be reassuring, 
also by the experts of the AHEG meeting on 10 July 2018, the impact of such a periodic heart rate 
increase in the expected population to be treated with abaloparatide remains unknown. 
The population of the pivotal trial BA058-05-003 is not considered entirely representative of the 
expected general patient population. Because of the presence of a placebo control arm, it was 
considered unethical to include subjects with severe osteoporosis. Indeed, only about 1% of subjects 
listed bisphosphonates as a prior medication whereas US real-world data show that 36% of teriparatide 
users used anti-osteoporosis medication beyond calcium/vitamin D before treatment. Due to relevant 
entry criteria for study participation, there are only limited data available for many subjects with 
chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease. Abaloparatide has not been evaluated in 
hypertensive women and in patients with stable heart failure. 
Regarding major adverse cardiac events (MACE), the number of events was too limited for any 
conclusions on differences between groups. The applicant was asked to present additional analyses of 
the study data to provide analyses for MACE and MACE + Heart Failure (regardless of hospitalisation) 
for study 003 and study 003/005. The analysis of MACE + Heart Failure suggested a decrease in MACE 
or heart failure events in the abaloparatide treated patients versus placebo in Study 003. However, the 
included events were collected routinely as adverse events during the clinical trials and were not 
adjudicated. The number of MACE events and the confidence intervals are summarised in the effects 
table (see below). This analysis did not indicate CV harm with abaloparatide treatment as compared to 
placebo with regard to MACE. However, the study was not designed to detect CV events. While this 
might provide some reassurance, major concerns remained about the key limitations of these 
analyses, in particular the lack of adjudication and the different drop-out rates of the various strata 
prior to the possibility of a MACE,possibly due to symptoms linked to heart rate increase thus 
potentially introducing bias favouring abaloparatide. Moreover, due to the study size and the exclusion 
criteria regarding CV risk factors, the number of events in the pivotal study was too small to assess 
such MACE events adequately. Therefore, this study is not considered sufficient in order to assess the 
risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with HR increases in a real-life osteoporosis 
population generally more vulnerable regarding cardiovascular risk. 
The analysis of renal CT scans in a subset of patients from study BA058-05-003 to assess kidney 
calcification did not reveal an increased incidence of calculi with abaloparatide compared to placebo but 
organ calcification has been identified in preclinical trials; this was proposed to be addressed as an 
important potential risk in the Risk Management Plan.  
No analysis of adverse events by baseline hepatic function is possible since no patient with baseline 
hepatic impairment was included in study BA058-05-003. 
There were no significant differences between abaloparatide, teriparatide, and placebo in adverse 
events leading to death and serious adverse events, but numbers are too small for a final assessment. 
It was of concern that in the first 6 months of the follow-up study BA058-05-005, 5 serious adverse 
Assessment report

Page 144/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
events (brain neoplasm, colon cancer, intestinal adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, renal cancer) were 
reported in the system organ class ‘neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and 
polyps)’ in patients previously on abaloparatide versus none in patients previously on placebo; 
however this difference was not seen at later points during the trial. 
The diminishing differences in frequency of adverse events might be attributable to the differential 
drop-out between treatment groups. Fewer patients on abaloparatide than on either teriparatide or 
placebo completed the 18 months trial BA058-05-003 and patients on abaloparatide dropped out 
earlier than on teriparatide or placebo, most frequently during the first month of the study. There were 
more early (≤1 month) drop-outs in the abaloparatide arm (7.9%) compared to teriparatide (3.9%) or 
placebo (5.2%). The mean duration of exposure for abaloparatide in study BA058-05-003 was 15.0 
months compared to 15.6 months in the placebo and 15.8 months in the teriparatide group. The 
pattern of shorter mean duration of treatment with abaloparatide compared to teriparatide and placebo 
was also seen in the phase 2 study BA058-05-002.  
The sensitivity of the bone biopsy analysis seems limited since histomorphometry did not show 
evidence of bone anabolic effects by abaloparatide or teriparatide.  
Relatively marked differences in AE reporting were seen between Asian and Caucasian subpopulations 
with higher incidences of total AEs, related AEs, and serious AEs in Asians. The observed differences 
were mainly driven by preferred terms dizziness, headache, palpitations, and hypercalciuria.

6.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
6.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The main clinical consequence of osteoporosis is an increased risk of fragility fractures. Radiological 
vertebral fractures are a common finding in postmenopausal women and usually (approximately 60%) 
asymptomatic. A typical symptomatic vertebral fracture causes acute pain and decreased mobility that 
lasts about one month. Fractures that require surgery are the most dangerous aspect of osteoporosis. 
Hip fracture and the following surgery in particular, are associated with serious risks, permanent 
disability, and increased mortality. Radiological vertebral fractures on the other hand are considered as 
important markers of osteoporosis severity. BMD is a surrogate marker for osteoporosis severity and 
included in the osteoporosis definition by the WHO criteria. 
Abaloparatide significantly reduces the risk of developing new vertebral fractures. However, the CHMP 
guideline on osteoporosis requests that for the demonstration of efficacy of a new anti-osteoporotic 
drug effects on non-vertebral fractures should also be shown, preferably in a separate, adequately

powered study, as those fractures, in particular of the hip, are of considerable clinical relevance. 
Abaloparatide has only been studied in a single pivotal trial with non-vertebral fractures as key 
secondary endpoint. In this single pivotal trial no statistically significant effect of abaloparatide on non-
vertebral fractures has been established.  
Other endpoints investigated, e.g. BMD and serum bone markers, support the primary finding of a 
reduction in the risk of osteoporotic fractures and by showing the same trend of an advantage of 
abaloparatide over placebo. However, these endpoints are surrogates and they do not establish effects 
in their own right or allow a valid conclusion on efficacy on an advantage of abaloparatide over 
teriparatide as claimed by the Applicant.  
The identified risks of nausea, dizziness, and palpitations did not increase the number of syncopes or 
falls in study BA058-05-003, but led to more discontinuations in abaloparatide treated patients.  
The entry criteria in study BA058-05-003 were restrictive which impacts the generalisability and 
external validity of the pivotal study. The general elderly osteoporosis population has many 
concomitant chronic diseases and medications. The marked increase in heart rate is of concern as 
concomitant cardiovascular diseases are expected to be more common than in the population included 
in the pivotal trial. The increase in heart rate was more pronounced in patients treated with 
abaloparatide compared with teriparatide. 
An increase in heart rate of the magnitude seen in the clinical trials with abaloparatide may have 
clinical consequences in vulnerable patients. The pivotal study had several exclusion criteria based on 
ECG findings and medical history of cardiovascular disease. The number of cardiovascular adverse 
events in the study population was too low to conclude on any possible risks related to the post-
baseline heart rate and blood pressure measurements in the study. In addition, the percentage of 
subjects who discontinued treatment due to palpitations, nausea, and dizziness was higher in the 
abaloparatide compared to the teriparatide and placebo arms leading to possible follow-up bias and a 
lower number of reported cardiovascular AEs in this group over the study period.  
To mitigate these risks, the applicant proposed to monitor patients in clinical practice after the first 
dose of abaloparatide for heart rate and blood pressure; patients either particularly responsive to 
haemodynamic effects or vulnerable to adverse events like ischemia or syncope may be detected with 
medical staff in attendance although this does not prevent events of increased heart rate or 
hypotension during the later course of the treatment. A contra-indication was proposed for patients 
with tachyarrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, significant valvular stenosis, 
decompensated heart failure or uncontrolled and severe orthostatic hypertension. 
The risk of increased heart rate and orthostatic hypotension in vulnerable patients exists throughout 
treatment and the risk cannot fully be eliminated by monitoring patients after the first dose. 
Information provided through the SmPC in sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1, as well as the PL were 
proposed. 
The frequency of the development of anti-abaloparatide antibodies and neutralising antibodies is very 
high. The limited available data do not show an effect of antibodies to abaloparatide on efficacy or 
safety.  
The incidence of hypercalcaemia adverse events is lower in patients treated with abaloparatide than 
teriparatide, but organ calcification has been identified in preclinical trials. Thus, it can currently not be 
excluded that abaloparatide might induce organ calcification and e.g. impair renal function.

6.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy of treatment with abaloparatide over 18 months regarding the incidence of new radiologically-
detected vertebral fractures was demonstrated in the pivotal study (abaloparatide 0.51% vs. placebo 
vs 4.2%). However, the study failed to demonstrate statistically significant efficacy on non-vertebral 
fractures versus placebo (abaloparatide 2.2% vs. placebo 3.1%).Only one hip fracture occurred in the 
study (on placebo). Similarity of the mechanism of action with teriparatide might allow some 
extrapolation regarding efficacy but the study was not designed for direct in-study comparison with 
teriparatide. 
All available data indicate a dose-related increase in heart rate due to abaloparatide. The likely 
mechanism of the marked increase in heart rate associated with abaloparatide is related to peripheral 
vasodilation and a direct chronotropic effect on cardiomyocytes as indicated by non-clinical studies. 
The significance of this finding is as yet unknown, and was therefore of major concern to CHMP. 
Marked post-injection increases in heart rate with abaloparatide were observed in healthy volunteers in 
the thorough QT-study with a mean increase of 14.6 bpm 15 min after the therapeutic dose of 80 μg. 
Significant increases in mean heart rate persisted for at least 12 hours.  This is of concern, particularly 
as abaloparatide was intended to be given once daily as a subcutaneous injection.  
In the pivotal study, the 1 hour post-dose heart rate increased more in abaloparatide treated patients 
compared to teriparatide. Therefore, safety data from clinical studies and post-marketing experience 
from teriparatide cannot be extrapolated to abaloparatide. In the pivotal study, for example, 20% of 
patients treated with abaloparatide experienced an increase in heart rate by >20 bpm at any time 
point versus 11% of patients treated with teriparatide. Patients that experienced highest increases in 
HR by >40 bpm (0.7%) were all in the abaloparatide group. 
Associated adverse events such as palpitations (6% vs. 2%), tachycardia (1.3% vs. 0.4%), dizziness 
(11% vs. 8%), nausea (9% vs. 5%) and discontinuations due to adverse events (10% vs. 7%) were 
also reported more frequently in patients treated with abaloparatide compared to teriparatide. There 
were more early (≤1 month) drop-outs in the abaloparatide-arm (7.9%) compared to teriparatide 
(3.9%) or placebo (5.2%).  
Risk minimisation measures proposed by the applicant with contraindications in patients with pre-
existing cardiac disease may reduce the CV risk associated with heart rate increases. However, 
thorough screening for undiagnosed conditions (e.g. with echocardiography) for these conditions 
appears unlikely in a general osteoporosis population. The applicant proposed a Post-Authorisation 
Safety Study (PASS) to further characterise the cardiovascular risk profile among new users of 
abaloparatide as well as a Drug Utilisation Study (DUS) to describe prescription patterns, assess 
whether the medicine would be prescribed according to the Product Information and the risk 
minimisation measures (Contra-Indications) would be adhered to. The proposed PASS has limitations 
compared to a randomised, prospective trial, such as lack of full characterisation at baseline of the 
included patients and potential confounding by indication. Moreover, the foreseen accrual of patients in 
the EU was considered low in comparison to US patients, considering likely differences in usage and 
population, with a rather long timeline to complete these studies.  
In Europe as well as in the US, guidelines recommend anti-resorptive agents such as bisphosphonates 
as the first-line osteoporosis treatment. Anabolic agents, such as abaloparatide or teriparatide, could 
be used if osteoporosis is progressive despite therapy, e.g. manifested by a new fracture. This second 
line osteoporosis population was not included in the pivotal trial which included a placebo-control arm; 
only about 1% of subjects listed bisphosphonates as a prior medication whereas US real-world data 
show that 36% of teriparatide users used anti-osteoporosis medication beyond calcium/vitamin D

before treatment. This second line osteoporosis population is expected to be frail with much 
concomitant cardiovascular morbidity. However, many of these patients are excluded by the 
contraindication that was introduced. In light of overall increased heart rate, increase in related 
adverse events compared to teriparatide and the unknown impact thereof on the risk for 
cardiovascular events, a reasonable target population for abaloparatide in clinical practice could not be 
identified.  
As a single pivotal trial of a new osteoporosis agent the size of the study was small. Only relatively 
healthy ambulatory postmenopausal woman, screened for being free from any significant cardiac 
disturbances, were included and the overall number of serious cardiovascular events during the 
18 month study period was low. Therefore, this study is not considered sufficient in order to assess the 
risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with heart rate increases in a real-life osteoporosis 
population generally more vulnerable regarding cardiovascular risk.  
Overall, this application for a new osteoporosis agent is not considered to be in accordance with EMA 
points to consider on application with one pivotal study with “particularly compelling results with 
respect to internal and external validity, clinical relevance, statistical significance, data quality, and 
internal consistency.” 
Considering the above mentioned limitations and the potential risks associated with the increase in 
heart rate, efficacy is not considered demonstrated to an extent to outweigh those risks in the 
proposed target population.  
A positive benefit-risk balance for the proposed target population has therefore not been established 
for abaloparatide. 
6.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Eladynos is negative. 
7.  Recommendations following re-examination 
Based on the arguments of the applicant and all the supporting data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP re-examined its initial opinion and in its final opinion concluded by majority decision that the 
safety and efficacy of the above mentioned medicinal product is not sufficiently demonstrated, and, 
therefore recommends the refusal of the granting of the marketing authorisation for the above 
mentioned medicinal product 
Whereas 
 
The efficacy of Eladynos (abaloparatide), for the treatment of osteoporosis, was supported by 
one pivotal study only. This study failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect on non-
vertebral fractures vs. placebo which is a requirement outlined in the “Guideline on the 
evaluation of medicinal products in the treatment of primary osteoporosis”. In the pivotal 
study, there were serious GCP related findings and data from two sites had to be excluded 
which reduced the size of the study population.    
  Marked post-injection increases in heart rate with abaloparatide were observed in healthy 
volunteers in the thorough QT-study with a maximum mean increase of 14.6 bpm 15 min after 
the therapeutic dose of 80 μg. In the pivotal phase III study, 1 hour post-dose heart rate 
increased more in abaloparatide treated patients compared to both placebo and teriparatide 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/581111/2018  
Page 152/157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with 42% of patients treated with abaloparatide experiencing an increase in heart rate of >15 
bpm at any time. 
o  No increase in major adverse cardiovascular events in patients treated with 
abaloparatide was noted compared to comparators. However, more common adverse 
events such as palpitations, tachycardia, dizziness, nausea and discontinuations were 
reported more frequently in patients treated with abaloparatide compared to both 
teriparatide and placebo which may be related to the documented effect of 
abaloparatide on heart rate.  With respect to serious cardiovascular events, the size 
and other limitations of the study did not allow to draw definitive conclusions on such 
events. In addition, patients with significant pre-existing cardiovascular disease, being 
at a higher risk of cardiovascular events, were excluded from the study. Therefore, this 
study is not considered sufficient in order to assess risk for adverse cardiovascular 
outcomes associated with heart rate increase in a generally more vulnerable real-life 
osteoporosis population.  
o  Risk minimisation measures including contraindications in patients with pre-existing 
cardiac disease as well as monitoring of patients at risk were considered by CHMP. 
However, in light of an increased baseline risk of cardiovascular events in the 
postmenopausal osteoporosis patient population, a reasonable target population for 
abaloparatide in clinical practice could not be identified. 
Due  to  the  aforementioned  concerns,  a  satisfactory  summary  of  product  characteristics,  labelling, 
package leaflet, and risk management plan cannot be agreed at this stage. 
Divergent positions to the majority recommendation are appended to this report.

Divergent position – Eladynos (EMEA/H/C/004157) 
The  undersigned  members  of  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  the  CHMP’s  opinion  recommending  the 
refusal of the granting of a Marketing Authorisation for Eladynos. 
The reasons for the divergent opinion were as follows: 
From  the  totality  of  information,  including  both  the  data  from  the  pivotal  study  and  knowledge  of 
the effects of  teriparatide  (same  molecule  class,  same  mode  of  action),  we  conclude that  efficacy  of 
abaloparatide  has  been  sufficiently  demonstrated  in  the  applied  indication.  In  particular,  there  is  no 
scientific reason to presume efficacy only for vertebral but not for non-vertebral fractures,  regardless 
of  statistical  significance  being  demonstrated  for  vertebral  (but  not  for  non-vertebral)  fractures. 
As  regards  safety  we  are  reassured  by  the  discussion  of  the  experts  at  the  ad  hoc  expert  group 
convened  on  request  of  the  CHMP,  including  their  view  on  the  different  relevance  of  a  permanent 
versus  a  temporary  increase  in  heart  rate  and  the  lack  of  a  cardiovascular  event  signal  in  the 
pivotal  trial.  Although  the  increase  in  heart  rate  with  teriparatide  is  less  pronounced  than  with 
abaloparatide,  the  large  number  of  patients  having  been  exposed  to  teriparatide  is  expected  to 
have  resulted  in  relevant  numbers  of  patients  with  a  comparably  high  increase  in  heart  rate. 
Therefore,  further  reassurance  is  seen  in  the  absence  of  a  cardiovascular  event  signal  for 
teriparatide.  We  therefore  conclude  that  the  observed  differences  in  effects  on  the  cardiovascular 
system  compared  to  teriparatide  could  have  been  addressed  by  adequate  information  and 
restrictions given in the Product Information.

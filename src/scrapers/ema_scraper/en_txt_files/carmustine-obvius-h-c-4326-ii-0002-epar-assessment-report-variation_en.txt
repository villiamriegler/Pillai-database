2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The MAH initially applied for the following indication “carmustine with or without total body irradiation 
(TBI),  as  conditioning  treatment  prior  to  allogeneic  or  autologous  haematopoietic  progenitor  cell 
transplantation (HPCT) in haematological diseases.” 
The final claimed indication is: “as conditioning treatment prior to autologous haematopoietic 
progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in malignant haematological diseases (Hodgkin’s disease / Non-
hodgkin’s lymphoma” 
Assessment report

Epidemiology  
Indications for HSCT in Europe (Passweg JR et al 2016) are leukaemias (including primarily AML, ALL 
and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/myelodysplastic (MD)/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) : 33% 
of total; 96% of which were allogeneic); lymphoid neoplasias including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 
Hodgkin's lymphoma and plasma cell disorders: 57% 11% allogeneic); solid tumors 4% (3% 
allogeneic); and non-malignant disorders; 2203 (6% 88% allogeneic) in 2014 (J R Passweg et al 
2016).   
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been in use for treatment of malignancies since 
the  1950s  (Burman  et  al.,  2018).  HSCT  can  be  performed  with  stem  cells  collected  from  another 
individual  (allogeneic  transplantation)  or  from  the  same  patient  who  will  receive  them  (autologous 
transplantation)  (Burman  et  al.,  2018).  Over  the  past  10  to  20  years,  there  have  been  significant 
improvements  in  the  field  of  HSCT  with  increased  applicability  to  lymphoma.  The  upper  age  limit  for 
HSCT has continued to climb for both autologous stem cell transplantation and allogeneic SCT (Kuruvilla, 
2016). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Intensive chemotherapy as a conditioning regimen prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) is used for a subset of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL), especially those with aggressive or refractory disease.  
Management 
Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative procedure for a variety of 
malignant  and  non-malignant  conditions.  When  developed  initially,  allogeneic  HCT  was  considered  an 
approach  to  rescue  patients  from  the  toxic  side  effects  of  supra-lethal  doses  of  radiation  and 
chemotherapy  used  to  treat  various  underlying  diseases  by  transplanting  haematopoietic  stem  cells, 
which had the ability to reconstitute haematopoiesis. However, it soon became evident that much of the 
effectiveness  of  HCT  in  malignant  diseases  stemmed  from  the  immunologic  reactions  of  donor  cells 
against  malignant  host  cells  (Gyurkocza  et  al.,  2010).  Autologous  HCT  is  the  i.v.  infusion  of 
haematopoietic  stem  and  progenitor  cells  designed  to  re-establish  marrow  and  immune  function  in 
patients  with  a  variety  of  acquired  malignant  disorders,  who  are  being  treated  with  high  dose 
chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy to treat the disease. These include haematologic malignancies (for 
example,  Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (HL), B  and  T  cell lymphoma  and  multiple  myeloma)  (Forman,  2017). 
Carmustine has been used for more than 40 years and has a well-defined place in different oncological 
treatment protocols, such as in BEAM (carmustine [BCNU], etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) and 
transplantation  of  haemopoietic  stem  cells  in  patients  with  chemo-sensitive  first  relapse  of  Hodgkin’s 
disease irrespective of length of initial remission (Schmitz et al., 2002). Various clinical studies reported 
that CBV (cyclophosphamide, BCNU and etoposide) and BEAM regimens are effective therapy in patients 
with lymphomas (Bierman et al., 1996; Burns et al., 1995; Buser et al., 2007; Caballero et al., 1997; 
Geisler et al., 1998; Law et al., 2006; Neben et al., 2000; Nademanee et al., 1995; Przepiorka et al., 
1999;  Rossi  et  al.,  2003;  Wadhwa  et  al.,  2005).  CBV  as  a  preparative  regimen  for  allogeneic 
transplantation  in  combination  with  cyclosporine  and  methylprednisolone  as  graft-vs.-host  disease 
prophylaxis has acceptable toxicity and is an effective therapy in patients with relapsed or high-risk non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (Rossi et al., 2003). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/332634/2020 
Page 8/108 
 
 
  
  
BCNU  can  cause  gastrointestinal  disorders  (mild  to  moderate  nausea  and  vomiting  and  diarrhoea), 
haemorrhagic complications, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary complications, veno-occlusive disease, 
myelodysplastic  syndrome  (MDS)  (Fernández-Jiménez  et  al.,  1999;  Ingram  et  al.,  2008;  Law  et  al., 
2006; Moormeier et al., 1990; Przepiorka et al., 1999; Rossi et al., 2003). 
In various clinical studies, BCNU 300 mg/m2 is used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents 
in patients with refractory or recurrent lymphoma before allogenic or autologous HSCT with or without 
TBI (Bierman et al., 1996; Burns et al., 1995; Buser et al., 2007; Geisler et al., 1998; Ingram et al., 
2008; Liu et al., 2010; Przepiorka et al., 1999; Wadhwa et al., 2005). In a phase I dose escalation study, 
BCNU  150  -  750  mg/m2  is  used  in  combination  with  other  chemotherapeutic  drugs  in  patients  with 
refractory  NHL  (Moormeier  et  al.,  1990).  In  another  studies,  BCNU  (600  mg/m2,  450  mg/m2  or  300 
mg/m2)  is  used  in  combination  with  other  chemotherapeutic  agents  in  patients  with  haematological 
malignancies (Ager et al., 1996; Bolwell et al., 2002; Fleming et al., 1999). Based on clinical studies, 
Carmustine  Obvius  (300  -  600  mg/m2  intravenously)  is  given  in  combination  with  other 
chemotherapeutic agents in adult patients with haematological malignancies before HPCT. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Carmustine Obvius 100 mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion was registered 
via  centralised  procedure  according  to  the  Article  10(1)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended.  The 
reference  product  was  Carmubris-Trockenstechampull  mit  lösungmittel,  100  mg  (Emcure  Pharma  UK, 
Ltd.,  UK)  authorized  via  national  authorisation  procedure  in  Austria  in  1996  (1-21762).    Carmustine 
Obvius received the authorisation granted via centralized authorization procedure on 18 July 2018. The 
Company Obvius applied to the EMA claiming eligibility to the centralised procedure on the basis that it 
would address the shortage and impact an area of treatment need. 
The  active  substance  carmustine  (100  mg  per  vial)  is  a  cell-cycle  phase  non-specific  antineoplastic 
belonging to the nitrosourea group of compounds (bischloroethylnitrosourea), which are considered to 
function as alkylating agents and thereby slowing the growth of cancer cells. It is believed to alkylate 
DNA and RNA and may also inhibit enzymatic processes by carbamoylation of amino acids in proteins 
Carmustine Obvius is currently indicated as effective in the following malignant neoplasms as a single 
agent  or  in  combination  with  other  antineoplastic  agents  and/or  other  therapeutic  measures 
(radiotherapy, surgery): 
-  Brain  tumours  (glioblastoma,  Brain-stem  gliomas,  medulloblastoma,  astrocytoma  and 
ependymoma), brain metastases 
-  Secondary therapy in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease. 
The Applicant submitted an application to include a new indication: 
- with or without total body irradiation (TBI), as conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic or autologous 
haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in haematological diseases. 
The  final  indication  following  assessment  is  “as  conditioning  treatment  prior  to  autologous 
haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in malignant haematological diseases (Hodgkin’s 
disease / Non-hodgkin’s lymphoma”. 
Carmustine  is  given  in  combination  with  other  chemotherapeutic  agents  in  patients  with  malignant 
haematological diseases before HPCT at a dose of 300 - 600 mg/m2 intravenously.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
This application is based on bibliographic evidence. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
An  updated  environmental  risk  assessment  was  included  in  this  application  to  evaluate  whether  the 
addition of the new indications may result in a significant increase in the environmental exposure.   
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, the evaluation of the potential 
environmental risks posed by Carmustine Obvius 100 mg powder and solvent for concentrate for 
solution for infusion should be submitted. Using the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment 
(ERA) of Medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4474/00 corr 2, 2006) and Questions 
and Answers (Q&A) for the same document (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev 1, 2016) a Phase I 
(pre-screening) stage evaluation is performed. 
The objective is an estimation of exposure using an action limit of < 0.01μg of active substance per 
litre of surface water known as PECsurface water (Predicted Environmental Concentration in surface water). 
This ERA is an update of a previous version submitted when Marketing Authorisation was first granted 
for Carmustine Obvius 100 mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion. 
It is filed in the context of a type II variation for addition of a new therapeutic indication. The new 
therapeutic indication is “with or without total body irradiation (TBI), as conditioning treatment prior to 
allogeneic or autologous haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in haematological 
diseases”. 
According to Question 2 in the Q&A document, a new ERA should be provided in case a type II 
variation results in an increase of the patient population, e.g. when additional indications are claimed. 
As this is the case, an updated version of the previously submitted ERA containing information on the 
prevalence of the additional indication and an updated calculation of PECsurface water is presented. 
Indications and posology 
Previously authorised indications are described in the SmPC as follows: 
Carmustine is effective in the following malignant neoplasms as a single agent or in combination with 
other antineoplastic agents and/or other therapeutic measures (radiotherapy, surgery): 
- 
Brain tumours (glioblastoma, Brain-stem gliomas, medulloblastoma, astrocytoma and 
ependymoma), brain metastases 
- 
Secondary therapy in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease 
According to the submitted SmPC, the following new indication is claimed in addition: 
- 
with or without total body irradiation (TBI), as conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic or 
autologous haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in haematological diseases. 
Posology for the new indication is described as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/332634/2020 
Page 10/108 
 
 
  
  
Conditioning treatment prior to HPCT 
Carmustine is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in patients with 
haematological diseases before HPCT at a dose of 300 - 600 mg/m2 intravenously. 
Phase I of the environmental risk assessment of carmustine: 
1- Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity: 
A published value for the octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) for Carmustine of 1.53 is available 
(Chabner et al., 2014). This value is supported by Xie (2012). Since this value falls well below the 
action limit of 4.5, no further assessment for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity is required. 
This conclusion remains unaffected from the addition of a new indication in this updated document. 
• 
Previously filed PEC calculation based on already authorised indications  
2- Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC): 
The calculation of PECSURFWATER for carmustine was performed according the following formula and 
assumptions: 
where 
DOSEai = Maximum daily dose consumed per inhabitant (mg/inhabitant per day) 
Fpen = Fraction of marked penetration (refined value, see below) 
WASTEinh = Amount of wastewater per inhabitant per day (200 litre/inhabitant per day) 
DILUTION = Dilution factor (10). 
The following calculations were presented in the previous version of this ERA: 
Disease prevalence data: 
Glioblastoma: 1/100,000 [Orphanet] 
Medulloblastoma: 1/909,000 [Orphanet] 
Astrocytoma: 1/12,500 [Orphanet] 
Metastatic brain tumours: 7-14/100,000 [Owonikoko et al, 2014]1 
Multiple myeloma: 1-5/10,000 [Orphanet]1 
Hodgkin’s disease:1/40,000 [Orphanet] 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma: 1-5/10,000 [Orphanet]1 
1 In order to regard a worst-case scenario, the higher end of this range was used in the calculation 
below 
Treatment regime: 
Carmustine Obvius 100 mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion has a 
maximum of infusion once every six weeks according to the proposed SmPC 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010, 2011- page 3), resulting in ttreatment = 1 day and

ntreatment = 9 per year. 
Calculation of refined Fpen values: 
Refined Fpen for indication glioblastoma: 
Fpen = 1/100,000 patients/inhabitants x (1 d x 9)/365 d = 0.00000025 
Refined Fpen for indication medulloblastoma: 
Fpen = 1/909,000 patients/inhabitants x (1 d x 9)/365 d = 0.00000003 
Refined Fpen for indication astrocytoma: 
Fpen = 1/12,500 patients/inhabitants x (1 d x 9)/365 d = 0.00000197 
Refined Fpen for indication metastatic brain tumour: 
Fpen = 14/100,000 patients/inhabitants x (1 d x 9)/365 d = 0.00000345 
Refined Fpen for indication multiple myeloma: 
Fpen = 5/10,000 patients/inhabitants x (1 d x 9)/365 d = 0.00001233 
Refined Fpen for indication Hodgkin’s disease: 
Fpen = 1/40,000 patients/inhabitants x (1 d x 9)/365 d = 0.00000062 
Refined Fpen for indication Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma: 
Fpen = 5/10,000 patients/inhabitants x (1 d x 9)/365 d = 0.00001233 
Using the equation of Du Bois* (Du Bois & Du Bois, 1916) the body surface area in a human weighing 
70  kg  with  a  height  of  185  cm  can  be  calculated  to  1.85  m2.  According  to  the  proposed  SmPC  the 
maximum dose of Carmustine Obvius 100 mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion 
is 200mg/m2 which thereby equal a maximum dose per inhabitant of 370 mg. 
PECsurface water can then be calculated as follows, for each indication: 
* Body surface area = weight (kg)0.425 x height (cm)0.725 x 0.007184 
Calculation of PEC values 
Indication glioblastoma: 
PECsurface water = 370 x 0.00000025 
200 x 10 = 0.00000004625 mg/liter equals 0.00004625 μg/liter 
Indication medulloblastoma: 
PECsurface water = 370 x 0.00000003 
200 x 10 = 0.00000000555 mg/liter equals 0.00000555 μg/liter 
Indication astrocytoma: 
PECsurface water = 370 x 0.00000197 
200 x 10 = 0.00000036445 mg/liter equals 0.00036445 μg/liter 
Indication metastatic brain tumour: 
PECsurface water = 370 x 0.00000345 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/332634/2020

200 x 10 = 0.00000063863 mg/liter equals 0.00063863 μg/liter 
Indication multiple myeloma: 
PECsurface water = 370 x 0.00001233 
200 x 10 = 0.00000228105 mg/liter equals 0.00228105 μg/liter 
Indication Hodgkin’s disease: 
PECsurface water = 370 x 0.00000062 
200 x 10 = 0.000000115 mg/liter equals 0.0001147 μg/liter 
Indication Non-Hodgkin’s disease: 
PECsurface water = 370 x 0.00001233 
200 x 10 = 0.00000228105 mg/liter equals 0.00228105 μg/liter 
It was concluded that the emission of active substance for each indication is below the action limit of < 
0.01μg/liter. 
Sum PECsurface water water for all indications = 0.00573168 μg/liter 
Thus, the emission of active substance for all indication is also below the action limit of < 0.01 μg/liter. 
Even though high-dose therapy (e.g. 450 mg/m2 or once a day infusion for consecutive days) may be 
used for individual cases in cancer therapy, it is unlikely that the action limit of < 0.01μg/liter for PECsurface 
water will be exceeded. 
Based upon the above shown calculation, and as no other environmental concerns are apparent, it was 
assumed that Carmustine Obvius 100 mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion is 
unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients. The conduct 
of ERA studies was therefore not deemed necessary. 
Calculation of additional environmental entry based on the added indication 
Disease prevalence data and treatment regime 
For  an  estimation  of  prevalence,  the  latest  figures  published  by  the  European  Society  for  Blood  and 
Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) were regarded. EBMT published information on the prevalence of HSCT 
(i.e. the number of transplants performed) in 2017 in their annual report [EBMT annual report, 2018] 
based  on  a  publication  by  one  of  the  society’s  members  [Passweg  et  al.,  2019].  The  total  number  of 
transplants  reported  in  2017  was  45,418  (in  41,100  patients;  23,945  autologous  (58%)  and  17,155 
allogeneic (42%) patients). As described in the publication by Passweg et al., 3,101 transplants (in 2,948 
patients)  were  performed  in  non-European  countries  but  nevertheless  included  in  the  analysis.  These 
non-European countries were Algeria, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and 
Tunisia.  EMBT  stated  that  across  indications,  data  from  these  countries  make  up  6.9%  of  all  data. 
Subtraction of 6.9% from the overall transplantation numbers in the respective indication therefore gives 
a good estimation of the respective numbers limited to Europe alone. 
In addition, several non-EU but European countries (e.g. Russia, Turkey) were included in the analysis. 
As  no  information  was  provided  on  the  relative  extent  of  their  contribution  to  overall  transplantation 
numbers, it is not possible to calculate and subtract the number of transplantations performed in non-
EU countries from the publication. 
The  number  of  transplants  was  further  stratified  with  regard  to  indication.  Figures  on  the  number  of 
transplantations relating to the indications listed in the updated SmPC are presented below in Table 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/332634/2020 
Page 13/108 
 
 
  
  
and used for calculation of the prevalence. According to Eurostat, the EU population on January 1st 2018 
was estimated at 512,000,000 [Eurostat, 2018]. 
Table 1: Numbers of HCT in Europe 2017 by relevant indication [Passweg et al. 2019] 
As  can  be  observed  in  Table  1,  the  reported  number  of  HSCTs  in  the  three  relevant  indications 
corresponds to an overall prevalence of 0.3 transplantations in 10,000 inhabitants. This estimation of 
prevalence  clearly  represents  an  overestimation:  The  number  of  HSCTs  include  several  countries 
belonging  to  Europe  geographically  while  not  being  part  of  the  EU,  as  it  was  not  possible  to  subtract 
HSCTs from these countries based on the publication. The population of these countries was not added 
to the EU population for the calculation of prevalence.  
Also,  data  from  several  non-European  countries  were  included  in  the  calculation.  This  was  done  as  a 
precautionary  measure  in  case  that  their  contribution  to  HSCT  numbers  in  the  relevant  indications 
deviated from the 6.9% reported across all indications. As a conservative approach, the calculation of 
Fpen  and  PECsurface  water  resulting  from  the  added  indication  was  performed  based  on  the 
overestimated prevalence rate described above. 
This figure relates to the number of interventions conducted per year. Treatment is received once prior 
to  each  intervention,  resulting  in  ttreatment  =  1  day  and  ntreatment  =  1  per  year  since  the  number  of 
interventions, not the number of patients were used for the prevalence estimation. 
Calculation of refined Fpen value 
Refined Fpen value for the indication “Conditioning treatment prior to HPCT”: 
Fpen = 0.3/10,000 patients/inhabitants x (1 d x 1)/365 d = 0.000000082 
Calculation of new PEC value 
The single dose administered before each intervention is according to the SmPC 300 - 600 mg/m2. 
In line with the calculations presented above for the existing indications, an individual weighing 70 kg 
with a height of 185 cm with a body surface area of 1.85 m2 is assumed. The resulting maximum daily 
dose (based on a dose of 600 mg/m2) for the new indication is 1,110 mg. 
PECsurface water is correspondingly calculated: 
PECsurface water = (1,110 x 0.000000082) / (200 x 10)= 0.000000046 mg/liter equals 0.000046 μg/litre 
200 x 10 = 0.00000011 mg/liter equals 0.00010545 μg/liter 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/332634/2020 
Page 14/108 
 
 
  
  
 
It can be concluded that the emission of active substance related to the additionally claimed indication 
is below the action limit of < 0.01μg/liter. 
The new sum PECsurface water for all indications = 0.00577768 μg/liter 
Thus, the emission of active substance for all indication is still below the action limit of < 0.01 μg/liter. 
The Applicant has concluded that the resulting PEC for the new indication, as well as for the sum of new 
and previous indications, fall well below the action limit. All other features of the compound, which was 
already found not to fall into the PBT category during previous evaluation, remain unchanged. Therefore, 
this assessment ends in Phase I as in the previous version. The conduct of environmental studies is not 
deemed necessary. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The initially proposed extension of indication to include the use of carmustine with or without total body 
irradiation (TBI), as conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic or autologous haematopoietic progenitor 
cell  transplantation  (HPCT)  in  haematological  diseases  and  the  new  narrower  version  of  previously 
proposed  indication  is  based  on  published  scientific  literature.  No  new  non-clinical  data  was  revealed 
from an updated Non-clinical Overview and published literature data submitted as part of this type II 
variation application.  
As for environmental risk assessment the Applicant followed the recommendations laid down in the EMA 
“Guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products 
for  human  use” 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2 and evaluated whether the addition of the new indications may result 
in  a  significant  increase  in  the  environmental  exposure.  Thus,  the  predicted  environmental 
concentrations  were  calculated  based  on  refined  market  penetration  factors  (Fpen)  for  the  already 
registered as well as requested new indications.  
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
Carmustine Obvius is contraindicated in paediatric patients (see SmPC section 4.3).  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of carmustine.  
- Considering the above data, carmustine should be used according to the precautions stated in the 
SmPC in order to minimize any potential risks to the environment.  
Guidelines for the safe handling and disposal of antineoplastic agents must be observed. Any unused 
medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements

Paediatrics 
A total of 152 patients with haematological diseases received BCNU intravenously, in combination with 
other chemotherapeutic drugs as conditioning treatment before autologous HPCT. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  carmustine  as  a  well-known  active  substance  was  described  in  the  initial 
marketing  authorization. No  new  data  were  provided.  Clinical  overview  contains  information  from  the  
published literature.  
Administration/Distribution/Metabolism/Excretion 
Intravenous  administered  BCNU  is  rapidly  degraded,  with  no  drug  intact  detectable  after  15  min 
(Martindale,  2014).  Though  Weiss  &  Issell  (1982)  reports  that,  five  minutes  after  administration  no 
parent drug can be detected in plasma. Because of the good lipid solubility and the lack of ionization at 
the physiological pH, BCNU is very well transferred through the blood brain barrier. Within 30 min after 
intravenous  administration  drug  products  appear  in  the  spinal  fluid  at  concentrations  15  -  30  %  of 
concurrent  plasma  level  (Weiss  &  Issell,  1982).  Though  the  SmPC  BiCNU  (2015)  states  that  level  of 
radioactivity in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is at least 50 % higher than the level measured concurrently 
in  plasma.  The  distribution  of  BCNU  in  humans  is  characterised  by  a  two-chamber  model.  After 
intravenous infusion over one hour, the BCNU-level in plasma drops in a biphasic manner. The half-life 
α- and β-accounts to one to four and 18 - 69 min, respectively (SmPC BiCNU, 2015). It is presumed that 
the metabolites of BCNU cause its antineoplastic and toxic activity. Degradation product of BCNU can be 
detected in the urine up to 72 h after administration (Weiss & Issell, 1982). Approximately 60 - 70 % of 
a total dose is excreted in the urine in 96 h and about 10% as respiratory CO2. The fate of the remainder 
is undetermined (DeVita et al., 1967).

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of carmustine are described in the initial marketing authorization.   
Mechanism of action 
BCNU are lipid-soluble and have low molecular weight a characteristic that facilitate the entry into the 
brain.  BCNU  alkylates  DNA  and  RNA  and  has  also  been  shown  to  inhibit  several  enzymes  by 
carbamoylation of amino acids in proteins (Martindale, 2015). It is thought that the antineoplastic and 
toxic activities of BCNU may be due to metabolites. It is shown that DNAcross-linking does occur and 
that the reaction appears to proceed in two steps: Chlorethylation of a nucleophilic site on one strand 
and displacement of a chloride ion on the other strand. The result is an ethyl bridge between the strands 
that prevents unwinding of the DNA double helix, a lethal effect. The high alkylating activity very likely 
contributes to the toxic effect given interstitial pneumonitis. It is the alveolar lining cells that are injured 
(Weiss & Issell, 1982; Woolley et al., 1976). In addition, BCNU is known to carbamylate lysine residues 
on proteins (Kann, 1978) causing protein carbamylation, a post translational protein modification that 
could  irreversibly  inactivate  enzymes  including  glutathione  reductase  (Tew  et  al.,  1985;  Jochheim  & 
Baillie,  1993;  Vanhoefer  &  Yin,  1997).  Therefore,  by  inhibiting  glutathione  reductase  an  enzyme  that 
plays  critical  roles  in  cellular  oxidative  balance,  BCNU  treatment  may  modulate  the  cellular  oxidative 
status. 
Chemotherapy induces high remission rates in high-grade lymphoma. However relapse remains a major 
problem. One approach to this is myeloablative chemotherapy with transplantation of autologous bone 
marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). Immunological mechanisms have been suggested 
to play a role in the prevention of relapse after transplantation. Scheid et al. (1995) investigated the 
recovery of cellular immune functions after high-dose chemotherapy (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine and 
melphalan  or  busulfan  and  cyclophosphamide)  and  PBPC  transplantation  in  5  patients  (age:  18  -  49 
years) with high grade NHL. All patients showed rapid reconstitution of natural killer (NK) and inducible 
lymphokine-activated killer (LAK)-activity 10 - 14 days after transplantation. Four of 5 patients showed 
higher levels of LAK-generation in the post-transplant period compared with levels prior to myeloablative 
treatment. Absolute lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood reached 1.0 × 109/L between days 10 and 
13 with a predominance of CD8+ cells and an inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. Four of 5 patients had a 
transient  increase  in  CD56+  and  CD16+  cell  counts  post-transplant.  No  change  in  the  proportion  of 
CD25+ cells was noted. These results show that PBPC transplantation leads to a rapid recovery of cellular 
immune functions after myeloablative chemotherapy and provides evidence for an increased presence 
of LAK precursor cells early in the post-transplant period which can be activated by interleukin-2 to exert 
high levels of cytotoxicity. 
Moos  et  al.  (1998)  examined  the  clinical  significance  of  t(14;18)-positive  cells  in  samples  from  47 
patients (male/female: 26/21; age: 26 - 56 [median: 45] years) with follicular NHL who underwent high-
dose therapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSC). At the time of PBSC 
mobilisation, 25 patients were in first remission, while 22 patients had a history of previous treatment 
failure.  At  the  same  time,  43  patients  had  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)-positive  cells  in  samples 
from bone marrow and/or peripheral blood. Independent of the remission status, high-dose cytarabine 
and  mitoxantrone  with  granulocyte  colony-stimulating  factor  (G-CSF)  support  were  administered  for 
PBSC mobilisation. Following high-dose conditioning therapy which consisted of cyclophosphamide (200 
mg/kg)  and  hyperfractionated  TBI  (14.4  Gy)  or  BEAM  (BCNU,  etoposide,  cytarabine,  melphalan),  34 
patients received PCR-positive and 13 patients received PCR-negative autografts. After a median follow-
up  time  of  20  months  (range:  6  -  50)  post-transplantation,  33  patients  were  in  remission,  while  14 
patients  had  relapsed  after  a  median  time  of  14.5  months  (range:  10  -  42).  Using  the  Andersen-Gill

proportional  hazards  regression  model  for  the  analysis  of  RFS,  PCR-positive  findings  in  samples  from 
bone marrow and/or peripheral blood at any given time-point after transplantation were associated with 
an increased estimated hazard ratio of 4.5 in comparison with a PCR-negative finding (p = 0.013). On 
the other hand, patients included while they were in first remission had a smaller estimated hazard ratio 
of 0.3 when compared with patients with a history of previous treatment failure (p = 0.048). For the 
latter group of patients, this translates into a significantly smaller probability of RFS in comparison to 
patients who were in first remission at the time of  PBSC-mobilisation (p = 0.012). In conclusion, the 
remission status of the patients before autografting and the PCR status as assessed on the occasion of 
follow-up examinations are significant prognostic parameters for RFS in patients with follicular lymphoma 
undergoing high-dose therapy with PBSC autografting. 
Rossi et al. (1997) reported on long-term haematological recovery and clinical outcome after high-dose 
chemotherapy  supported  by  circulating  progenitor  cells  transplantation  in  NHL  patients, and  analysed 
the  role  of  variables  which  might  influence  engraftment.  Sixty  three  consecutive  NHL  patients  were 
enrolled  in  this  study.  Two  groups  of  patients  were  considered  for  analysis:  the  first  34  patients  had 
untreated diffuse large cell lymphoma with unfavorable prognostic factors. A second group of 29 patients 
underwent  transplantation  for  resistant  or  relapsing  NHL  with  low,  intermediate  and  high-grade 
histology. All patients received the BEAM (BCNU 300 mg/m2 × 1 day; cytarabine 200 mg/m2 × 4 days, 
twice daily; etoposide 100 mg/m2 × 4 days, twice daily and melphalan 140 mg/m2 × 1 day) conditioning 
regimen. All patients showed a rapid haematological reconstitution. Forty-three patients (68%) achieved 
long-term complete trilineage engraftment within a median of 107 days from circulating progenitor cells 
transplantation.  The  neutrophil  count  was  the  first  parameter  reaching  complete  normalisation,  and 
haemoglobin was the last. Failure to meet the trilineage levels was due to lack of platelet recovery and 
was more frequent in patients transplanted in the setting of salvage protocols. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, 
the probability of a full reconstitution was 80% in patients to whom transplant was offered as part of a 
front-line therapy and 50% when transplant was given in the salvage programmes. Multivariate analysis 
showed that sustained long-term haematological reconstitution was significantly related to younger age, 
the time taken to achieve short-term reconstitution, and bone marrow involvement. 
A comprehensive strategy of chemotherapy mobilisation of PBPC followed by high-dose chemotherapy 
for the treatment of refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease was evaluated. Patients with relapsed or 
refractory Hodgkin's disease were enrolled to receive cyclophosphamide, etoposide ± cisplatin (CE ± P) 
and recombinant human G-CSF mobilisation of PBPCs. Patients achieving ≤ 2.5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg 
following initial mobilisation were eligible to receive a second course of CE ± P. Unmanipulated PBPCs 
alone  were  infused  following  administration  of  high-dose  BCNU,  etoposide,  cytarabine,  and 
cyclophosphamide  (BEAC).  Thirty-eight  consecutive  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  Hodgkin's 
disease were initially enrolled to receive CE ± P. Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. A 
median of 6.4 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg (range: 0.66 - 62.3) were collected with a median of 3 (range: 2 - 
9) leukaphereses. Twenty-eight of 38 (74%) patients achieved ≥ 2.5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg. Analysis of 
variables  potentially  effecting  mobilisation  of  CD34+  cells  revealed  that  only  the  amount  of  prior 
chemotherapy statistically influenced collecting CD34+ cells (p = 0.005). Two of six patients undergoing 
a second mobilisation procedure achieved ≥ 2.5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg for a total of 30 patients eligible 
to proceed with high-dose BEAC. The 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS and PFS for all 38 patients is 
65 and 53%, respectively. The 3-year OS and PFS for the 28 patients receiving BEAC is 77 and 64% 
respectively vs. 33 and 30% for the 10 patients not receiving BEAC. The strategy of CE ± P and BEAC 
was well tolerated with a 100-day treatment-related mortality of 3.6%. All patients experienced rapid 
and sustained haematologic recovery with PBPCs alone. The median time to an absolute neutrophil count 
≥ 5 × 109/L and platelet transfusion independence was 10 days. Treatment of refractory or relapsed 
Hodgkin's  utilizing  a  strategy  of  CE  ±  P  PBPC  mobilisation  for  haematopoietic  reconstitution  following

high-dose BEAC is associated with acceptable toxicity and rapid engraftment. A 3-year PFS greater than 
60% can be achieved in the community hospital setting (Weaver et al., 1996).

Not applicable 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
As this concerns a bibliographic application, relevant publications on clinical pharmacology have been 
submitted with focus on the issues related to proposed indication. 
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of carmustine is well known, and published literature 
provides detailed information. The Applicant did not perform any new studies and provided summary of 
the  published  literature.  The  available  information  on  the  clinical  pharmacology  of  the  carmustine  is 
considered adequate. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Carmustine is well known active substance. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of carmustine is 
well  known  and  well  described  in  the  literature.  Clinical  overview  on  the  clinical  pharmacology  of 
carmustine is adequate and acceptable. Information in Section 5.2 of the SmPC is adequate. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose response studies were performed. The Applicant refers to published data. 
A reasonably tolerated dose of BCNU was determined in the initial clinical trial to be 250 mg/m2 of body 
surface in a single dose repeated at six-week intervals (DeVita et al., 1965).  
As the major determinant of dose is the myelotoxicity some dose individualisation is necessary depending 
on the degree of marrow compromise by prior treatment or concurrent use of other drugs. Most clinicians 
have elected to administer the total dose over two or three days to diminish the emesis effect (Weiss & 
Issell, 1982). 
In various clinical studies, BCNU 300 mg/m2 is used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents 
in patients with refractory or recurrent lymphoma before allogenic or autologous HSCT with or without 
TBI (Bierman et al., 1996; Burns et al., 1995; Buser et al., 2007; Geisler et al., 1998; Ingram et al., 
2008; Kessinger et al., 1991; Lancet et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2010; Milpied et al., 1998; Przepiorka et 
al., 1999; Wadhwa et al., 2005; Weaver et al., 1997). In a phase I dose escalation study, BCNU 150 - 
750 mg/m2 is used in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs in patients with refractory NHL 
(Moormeier et al., 1990). In another studies, BCNU (600 mg/m2, 450 mg/m2 or 300 mg/m2) is used in 
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in patients with haematological malignancies (Ager et 
al., 1996; Bolwell et al., 2002; Fleming et al., 1999). 
A  review  summarised  in  2017,  that  the  different  dose  of  BCNU  is  dependent  on  the  BCNU  based 
conditioning regime. In a BEAM regime prior to HPCT, BCNU 300 mg/m2 is used, whereas in CBV, higher 
dosis of BCNU are applied (Damaj et al., 2017). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/332634/2020

The dose of carmustine used in conditioning regimen depends on the chosen regimen. The dose of 300 
- 600 mg/m2 carmustine given intravenously before HPCT is considered acceptable and in line with 
available data from literature.

This  study  of  is  a  retrospective  registry  study  of  the  EBMT  database  and  aimed  to  provide 
information  on  the  potential  risks  and  benefits  of  TT-based  high-dose  regimens  for  AHCT  in 
distinct subtypes of lymphoma outside the PCNSL setting. TT-based regimens were compared to 
BEAM in AHCT for diffuse large DLBCL (excluding PCNSL), FL or HL. A total of 14,544 patients 
(589 thiotepa and 13,955 BEAM) met the eligibility criteria, and 535 thiotepa- and 1,031 BEAM-
treated  patients  were  matched  in  a  1:2  ratio  for  final  comparison.  No  significant  differences 
between thiotepa and BEAM groups for any survival end point were identified in the whole sample 
or disease entity subsets.

days; etoposide, 200 mg/m2 × 4 days; cytarabine, 400 mg/m2 × 4 day; melphalan, 140 mg/m2 
× 1 day) regimens for AHCT in lymphomas performed from 2008 to 2015. Even though the study 
primarily aimed to analyse the frequency of infection events, secondary study endpoints included 
OS and PFS. Therefore, the retrospective study was included into the main studies. In this study, 
1,038 patients (BEAM=607 [female 40.2%; age: 16.5-79.5 years], FEAM=431 [female 39.2%; 
age: 17.2-77.8 years]), of which 27% had HL, 14% indolent NHL, and 59% aNHL were enrolled. 
Baseline  characteristics  including  age,  sex,  stage,  B-symptoms,  extranodal  involvement, 
previous  treatments,  response  before  AHCT,  and  overall  conditioning  intensity  were  well 
balanced between BEAM and FEAM; notable exceptions were median AHCT year (BEAM = 2011 
vs. FEAM = 2013, p < 0.001), Sorror score ≥3 (BEAM = 15% vs. FEAM = 10%, p = 0.017), and 
radiotherapy use (BEAM = 18% vs. FEAM = 10%, p < 0.001). Response status at day 100 post-
AHCT (overall response:  BEAM = 91% vs. FEAM = 88%, p = 0.42), 2-year OS (83.9%; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 81.5% to 86.1%) and PFS (70.3%; 95% CI, 67.4% to 73.1%) were not 
different in the two groups. Mortality from infection was higher in the FEAM group (sub-HR, 1.99; 
95% CI, 1.02 to 3.88; p = 0.04). It was concluded by the authors that BEAM and FEAM do not 
appear different in terms of survival and disease control.

The study of Marchesi et al. (2018) also compared FEAM regimen to the BEAM regimen due 
to  supply  shortening  of  BCNU  in  Italy.  From  January  2007  to  January  2017,  362  consecutive 
lymphoma patients undergoing AHCT after BEAM (n = 200) and FEAM (n = 162) were analysed 
by reviewing clinical records in two centres of Rome. FEAM was administered according to the 
original protocol. Primary end-point was the treatment response rate assessed at day −100 after 
AHCT.  Secondary  end-points  were  (a.o.)  conversion  rate  into  CR  assessed  at  day  +100  after 
AHCT, PFS and OS. 
There was a significant difference in the median follow-up (77 months for BEAM vs 25 for FEAM; 
P  <  0.0001),  due  to  the  fact  that  FEAM  was  more  recently  introduced.  A  significantly  higher 
probability  of  being  in  a  CR  status  at  post-transplant  day-100  assessment  in  the  BEAM  group 
compared with FEAM (87% vs. 74.7%; P=0.01) was observed. No significant difference between 
the two cohorts in PFS (2-year-PFS BEAM: 76% vs. FEAM: 74%; P=0.211), cumulative incidence 
of relapse (2-year cumulative incidence of relapse BEAM: 12% vs. FEAM: 14%; P=0.235), and 
OS (2-year OS BEAM: 87% vs. FEAM: 84%; P=0.578) could be detected. 
Khattry  et  al.  (2016)  compared  the  LACE  (Lomustine  200  mg/m2,  etoposide  1000  mg/m2, 
cytarabine 2000 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 1800  mg/m2 and  mesna 1800  mg/m2) vs. BEAM 
(BCNU 300 mg/m2 i.v. on day -6, etoposide at 200 mg/m2 i.v. on days -5 to -2, cytarabine at 
200 mg/m2 i.v. twice daily on days -5 to -2 and melphalan at 140 mg/m2). LACE group consisted 
of  75  patients  (male/female:  56/19;  age:  4-58  [median:  23]  years)  and  BCNU  group  of  64 
patients  (male/female:  51/13;  age:  8-57  [median:  25]  years)  undergoing  AHCT  for  primary 
refractory or relapsed lymphoma. Ninety-two patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and 47 with NHL 
were enrolled. Probability of OS (LACE 46% vs. BEAM 47%; P=NS) and PFS (LACE 37% vs. BEAM 
47%; P=NS) at 5 years was comparable between two groups. The median days to myeloid (10 
vs.  11;  P=0.007)  and  platelet  engraftment  (13  vs.  15;  P=0.026)  were  shorter  for  the  LACE 
cohort. The incidence of grade 3-4 oral mucositis (9 vs. 38%; P<0.001) and parenteral nutrition 
requirement (32 vs. 69%; P<0.001) were significantly lower in the LACE cohort. TRM in the LACE 
group was 9% compared to 13% in patients treated with BEAM (P=NS). The authors concluded 
that LACE has better toxicity profile compared to BEAM and results in similar long-term survival 
in primary refractory or relapsed lymphoma transplant. 
Sakellari  et  al.  (2015)  retrospectively  analysed  the  outcome  of  patients  (HL  and  NHL) 
condiioned with BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan (BEAM, n=87; BCNU 300 mg/m2 
on day-6, etoposide [200 mg/m2/day] and cytarabine [200 mg/m2/day] on days -5 to -2 and 
melphalan 140 mg/m2 on day-1) or Busulfex, etoposide and melphalan (BuEM, n=50; Busulfex 
9.6  mg/kg,  etoposide  800  mg/m2  and  melphalan  140  mg/m2)  in  matched-pair  analysis  on  a 
planned 2:1 ratio. Eighty-seven patients treated with BEAM who fulfilled the matching criteria 
were randomly selected. Two-year PFS/OS were 63.2%/76.7% for BEAM vs. 65.6%/79.8% for 
BuEM  after  64.7  and  42.7  months,  respectively.  BEAM  correlated  with  faster  engraftment, 
reduced infections, less mucositis and liver toxicity, and BuEM with less need for blood cell and 
platelet  transfusions  and  G-CSF  administration.  In  conclusion,  BuEM  was  well  tolerated  and 
equally highly efficacious as BEAM for NHL and offered marginally significantly improved PFS and 
OS in HL with acceptable toxicity and zero mortality. 
Joffe et al. (2018) retrospectively compared BEAM (BCNU [300 mg/m2 i.v. day -7], etoposide 
[200 mg/m2 days -6 to -3], cytarabine [200 mg/m2 days -6 to -3], and melphalan [140 mg/m2 
day -2] to the TECAM (thiotepa [40 mg/m2 days -5 to -2], etoposide [200 mg/m2 days -6 to - 
3], cytarabine [200 mg/m2 days -4 to -1], cyclophosphamide [60 mg/kg day -3], and melphalan 
[60 mg/m2 days -2 to -1] regime in 125 NHL and HL patients. There have been not statistically 
significant differences in PFS, OS and TRM (3 years PFS 49% vs. 62%, P=0.16; 3 years OS 64%

vs. 71%, P=0.44; TRM 1.6% vs. 5%, P=0.35). The results also show comparable data for toxicity 
and  time  to  engraftment.  The  authors  conclude  that,  replacing  BCNU  by  thiotepa  and 
cyclophosphamide for AHCT conditioning, has comparable efficacy and safety profiles. 
Patir et al. (2018) retrospectively analysed 108  relapsed/refractory lymphoma patients who 
had high-dose treatments (TECAM and BEAM regimens) followed by AHCT between October 2012 
and February 2017. TECAM regimen (n=36 [male/female: 24/12]; age: 28-69 [median: 54.5] 
years)  consists  of  thiotepa  40  mg/m2  ×  4  days,  etoposide  200  mg/m2  ×  4  days, 
cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg × 1 day, cytarabine at 200 mg/m2 × 4 days, and melphalan 60 
mg/m2 × 2 days whereas BEAM (n=72 [male/female: 47/25]; age: 20-68 [median: 49] years) 
consists of BCNU 300 mg/m2 × 1 day, etoposide at 200 mg/m2 × 4 days, cytarabine 200 mg/m2 
× 4 days, and melphalan 140 mg/m2 × 1 day. At a median follow-up period of 16 months (9 
months for TECAM group; 27 months for BEAM group), the estimated 2-year PFS rates for the 
TECAM and BEAM groups were 55.7% and 52.9%, respectively (P=0.811). The estimated 2-year 
OS rate in the TECAM group (55.9%) was relatively inferior to that shown in the BEAM group 
(67%), but the differences were not significant (P=0.238). No differences were observed for time 
to  haematopoietic  recovery  and  duration  of  hospitalisation.  Incidences  of  transplant  related 
infectious and non-infectious complications were similar for each conditioning regimen. It was 
concluded  that  both  BEAM  and  TECAM  regimens  have  similar  efficacy  for  lymphoma  patients 
before AHCT 
In the study of the study of Kothari et al. (2016) two cohorts of patients undergoing AHCT for 
relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma were compared (50 patients per cohort), one conditioned 
with BEAM (BCNU 300 mg/m2, etoposide 800 mg/m2 (in divided doses), cytarabine 1600 mg/m2 
(in divided doses) and melphalan140mg/m2, and the other with LEAM (lomustine 200 mg/m2 
instead  of  BCNU).  There  was  no  significant  difference  in  OS  or  PFS  between  the  two  cohorts 
(median  3-year  OS  and  PFS  were  86%  and  69%,  respectively  for  LEAM,  and  86%  and  75%, 
respectively for BEAM. The NRM was similar in both cohorts: 4% for LEAM vs. 2% for BEAM at 
100 days, and 4% for both cohorts at 12 months. In summary, LEAM and BEAM appear to be 
generally comparable conditioning regimens for autologous transplantation. 
With the limitations of retrospective analysis, all these studies demonstrate that BCNU containing 
regimes  (especially  BEAM)  is  a  well-established,  widely  used  and  effective  method  for 
conditioning  prior  to  AHCT  in  HL  and  NHL.  To  date,  there  are  no  data  which  would  proof 
superiority above the BEAM regime in this setting. The fact, that all the cited studies above, are 
retrospective studies clearly hampers validity of the data. On the other hand, these retrospective 
analyses  were  performed  with  a  high  number  of  patients  for  each  study  and  in  total  8,402 
patients. 
Clinical studies in the conditioning treatment prior to allogenic HPCT 
Originally,  the  Applicant  has  refered  to  5  publications.  A  total  of  134  patients  with  haematological 
diseases received BCNU intravenously in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs as conditioning 
regimen before allogenic HPCT. 
There were 3 studies in Lymphoma patients, and 2 studies in NHL. 
The  efficacy  endpoints  used  to  evaluate  efficacy  of  conditioning  treatment  prior  allogenic  HPCT  were 
disease  control  (relapse  rate);  disease  free-survival  (DFS)/  event-free  survival  (EFS)),  the 
transplantation-related mortality (TRM)/ non-relapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS).

The  Applicant  additionally  provided  three  studies,  that  have  been  identified  as  studies  mainly 
supporting the evaluation of efficacy of BCNU-containing conditioning regimes for allo-HCT. Two of these 
studies investigate AML and one HL+NHL treatment. The total number of patients in these studies was 
571. 
Conditioning treatment prior to autologous HPCT 
The Applicant refers to 41 publication. A total of 3497 patients with haematological diseases received 
BCNU intravenously as conditioning regimen before autologous HPCT. 
Majority of references are related to the use of carmustine in NH, HL. There were 4 studies in Lymphoma 
patients, and 2 studies in multiple myeloma, one study in primary CNS lymphoma, solid tumors in NHL, 
one study combining HL, NHL, AML, myeloma, CML and AML patients. 
The efficacy endpoints used to evaluate efficacy of conditioning treatment prior autologous HPCT were 
disease control (relapse rate); progression-free survival (PFS)/ disease free-survival (DFS)/ non-relapse 
mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS).

Moormeier et al.(1990) - phase I dose escalation study, 40 patients (male/female: 19/21; age: 22 - 
62 [median: 43] years) with refractory solid tumours or relapsed/refractory NHL were treated with high-
dose cyclophosphamide (2.5 g/m2 given intravenously over 1 h on days -6, -4, and -2 [total dose, 7.5 
g/m2],  thiotepa  (225  mg/m2  given  intravenously  over  1  h  on  days  -6,  -4,  and  -2  [total  dose,  675 
mg/m2)], and BCNU (50 - 250 mg/m2 given intravenously over 1 h on days -6, -4, and -2 [total dose, 
150 - 750 mg/m2]), followed by autologous stem cell rescue. Of the 40 patients who were treated, nine 
were  not  able  to  be  evaluated  for  response  to  treatment  because  of  early  death  or  lack  of  clearly 
measurable disease at diagnosis or follow-up.  
Of the remaining 31 patients, 25 responded, for an overall response rate of 63% (95% CI ± 15%). There 
were 11 CR and 14 PR. The median time to disease progression was 14 weeks.  
Conclusion  -  Although  this  regimen  provided  effective  cytoreduction,  its  use  in  heavily  pre-treated 
patients with bulky disease is of limited value  
Ager et al. (1996) have investigated the toxicity of dose-escalation of BCNU, etoposide and melphalan 
('BEM')  chemotherapy  with  ASCT  in  patients  (n  =  72;  age:  18  -  66  years)  with  haematological 
malignancies. Seventy-two patients with haematological malignancies (Hodgkin’s disease, n = 20; NHL, 
n = 21; myeloma, n = 15; acute myeloid leukaemia, n = 13; chronic myeloid leukaemia, n = 2; ALL, n 
= 1) were treated with BCNU (600 mg/m2, 450 mg/m2 or 300 mg/m2 intravenously), etoposide 2 g/m2 
intravenously  and  melphalan  140  mg/m2  intravenously  followed  by  ABMT,  n  =  51,  or  autologous 
peripheral  blood  progenitor  cell  transplantation  (APBPCT),  n  =  21.  Liver  and  pulmonary  function  was 
monitored pre-transplant and at  
Sehn et al. (1998) - retrospective analysis of 35 patients (male/female: 14/21; age: 17 - 50 [median: 
29] years) with primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the mediastinum treated with high-dose CBV 
plus  autologous  haematopoietic  cell  transplantation  (AHCT)  to  determine  outcome  and  prognostic 
features for PFS. Thirty-five patients with primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the mediastinum in 
first response (CR or PR) with poor prognostic features, with primarily refractory disease, or with relapsed 
disease following conventional chemotherapy, were treated with CBV (cyclophosphamide 6,000 - 7,200 
mg/m2, BCNU, 450 mg/m2 and etoposide, 1,200 - 2,000 mg/m2) and AHCT.  
Estimated  5-year  PFS  varied  significantly  with  patient  disease  status  at  transplantation.  Patients 
transplanted in first response had an estimated 5-year PFS rate of 83%, compared with 58% and 27% 
for primarily refractory and relapsed patients, respectively (p = 0.02). The strongest predictor of PFS 
was  chemotherapy  responsiveness  immediately  before  transplantation.  Patients  with  chemotherapy-
responsive disease had a significantly greater PFS rate than patients with chemotherapy-nonresponsive 
disease (risk ratio, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.14 - 11.4). No other factors were found to be significant on univariate 
or  multivariate  analysis.  Patients  with  primary  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  of  the  mediastinum  can 
achieve prolonged PFS following high-dose chemotherapy and AHCT. Outcomes are strongly correlated 
with  disease  status  (first  response  vs.  refractory  vs.  relapsed)  at  transplantation  and  chemotherapy 
responsiveness immediately before transplantation. 
Cucuianu et al. (1995) assessed the efficiency of high-dose cytotoxic therapy followed by autologous 
bone marrow or peripheral progenitor cell rescue with haematopoietic growth factor support given in a 
group  of  27  patients  (16  men,  11  women)  at  the  Department  of  Haematology  of  the  Mont  Godinne 
University Clinics, mainly in the same interval 1990 - 1994. The reasons for introducing such a therapy

with low grade follicular NHL) were relapse of disease after conventional therapy (11 cases), resistance 
to initial therapy (5 patients) or because of histologically proven transformation to a more aggressive 
form (one case); in 10 patients with extended, poor prognosis forms, the procedure was used as part of

the first line therapy. The conditioning high dose chemotherapy was given according to various regimens, 
most of them containing cyclophosphamide, BCNU and etoposide, with or without TBI. In 14 patients, 
bone  marrow  graft  was  used,  while  PBPC  were  infused  in  the  remaining  13  patients.  The  number  of 
infused CFU-GM ranged between 7,650 and 3,900,000/kg, with a mean value of 461,000/kg. 
The median time intervals required to reach an absolute neutrophil count > 500/μL, a platelet count > 
50,000/μL and a haematocrit > 30% were 13 days, 20 days and 23 days respectively. Growth factors 
(GM-CSF and G-CSF) and PBPC use shortened the time for neutrophil recovery as well as neutropenia-
related  complications.  No  procedure-related  death  was  observed,  and  CR  was  achieved  in  22  cases 
(81.4%);  after  a  mean  follow-up  of  32.6  months,  14  patients  (55.5%)  are  alive  and  free  of  disease, 
while in 7 patients (31% of the complete responders) relapse occurred at an average time interval of 
8.2 months since the procedure. 
Martin  et  al.  (2015)  -  retrospective  analysis  of  73  consecutive  patients  (male/female:  54/19)  aged 
over  65  years  treated  for  aggressive  or  relapsed  lymphoma  by  high-dose  chemotherapy  with  BEAM 
(BCNU 300 mg/m2 on day -7, etoposide 100 mg/m2 every 12 h on days - 6 to -3, cytarabine 100 mg/m2 
every 12 h on days -6 to -3 and melphalan 140 mg/m2 on day - 2)) at full dosage followed by ASCT. 
Patient data were obtained from medical charts from two institutions. Median age was 67 years (65 - 
74). Significant comorbidities were present in 24.7% of patients.  
The  median  number  of  days  for  grade  4  neutropenia  was  9  (5  -  18).  The  early  treatment-  related 
mortality rate (< 100 days) was 2.7%. The estimated 2-year PFS and OS rates were 67.2% and 78.5%, 
respectively.  
Conclusion  -  the  full-dose  high-dose  chemotherapy-  ASCT  regimen  is  feasible,  safe  and  efficient  in 
selected patients over 65 years old. 
Fernández-Jiménez  et  al.(1999).  From  February  1992  to  June  1998  twenty-four  patients 
(male/female: 17/7; age: 18 - 59 years) receiving mini-BEAM therapy for resistance or relapse of their 
Hodgkin's  disease  were  included  in  a  study.  Four  patients  had  obtained  no  response  with  initial 
chemotherapy  (refractory),  8  had  obtained  an  incomplete  response,  7  were  in  first  relapse  and  5  in 
second  or  subsequent  relapse.  Fifteen  patients  received  mini-BEAM  (BCNU  60  mg/m2/day,  etoposide 
300 mg/m2/day, cytarabine 800 mg/m2/day and melphalan 30 mg/m2/day for one day) as first salvage 
chemotherapy regimen. The remaining nine patients had previously been exposed to a median of one 
salvage regimen. Patients received a median of 3 cycles of mini-BEAM. Sixteen patients achieved CR and 
four PR, yielding an overall response rate of 83%.  
No significant differences in response were observed between patients who received mini-BEAM as initial 
salvage  therapy  and  those  who  had  received  a  prior  salvage  regimen.  Eighteen  out  of  the  twenty 
responding patients went on to intensive therapy and APBSCT. With a median follow-up of 52 months, 
the cumulative probability of 7-year OS is 71% for the responders and that of the 6- year DFS is 42%. 
No treatment-related deaths were observed.  
Conclusion  -mini-BEAM  is  an  effective  salvage  regimen  with  moderate  toxicity  that  may  be  useful  for 
cytoreduction prior to stem cell procedures. 
Rodríguez et al., (2007) - Nineteen patients with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma treated with 
high-dose  chemotherapy  and  ASCT  within  the  GELTAMO  co-operative  group  between  1992  and  2004 
were  evaluated.  The  median  age  at  transplantation  was  46  years.  Fifteen  patients  underwent  the 
procedure as front-line therapy and four patients as salvage therapy. Most patients received peripheral 
stem cells (90%) coupled with BEAM or BEAC as conditioning regimen (79%).  
A 79% of patients achieved CR, 5% PR and 16% failed the procedure. After a median follow-up of 25 
months, eight patients died (seven of progressive disease and secondary neoplasia), while actuarial OS

and PFS at 3 years was 60% and 55%. Prognostic factors associated with a poor outcome included bone 
marrow involvement, transplantation in refractory disease state, attributing more than one factor of the 
age-adjusted-International Prognostic Index, Pretransplant peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) Score or 
Prognostic Index for PTCL.  
Conclusion – high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT offers better results than conventional chemotherapy 
in treating aggressive lymphomas. Although further follow-up is needed to confirm these results, more 
than half of the patients in this study were in continued remission. 
Martín et al. (2001) reported on long-term results of 55 consecutive patients (male/female: 36/19; 
age: 15 - 60 [median: 33.5] years) with Hodgkin's disease who received mini-BEAM (BCNU 60 mg/m2, 
etoposide 75 mg/m2, cytarabine 100 mg/m2, melphalan 30 mg/m2) as salvage therapy before ASCT. 
Eleven patients were refractory to front-line therapy, 17 were PR, and 27 patients had relapsed from 
Hodgkin's disease.  
Results - Twenty-eight patients achieved CR, and 18 achieved PR with a median of two cycles of mini-
BEAM, giving a total response rate of 84%. Significant factors predicting poor response (p < 0.05) were: 
initial  treatment  with  MOPP  (mechloroethamine,  oncovin,  procarbazine,  prednisolone),  ≥  2  previous 
chemotherapy  regimens  and  three  disease  characteristics  at  mini-BEAM  treatment:  presence  of  B 
symptoms, extranodal involvement or low serum albumin. However, only the last two factors retained 
independent influence on multivariate analysis. In total, 45/55 patients have been transplanted. Median 
follow-up after mini-BEAM administration for living patients is 68 months. At the time of reporting, 31 
out of 55 patients (56.4%) are still alive, 21 patients (38%) have relapsed, three (5.4%) have developed 
secondary neoplasias, and five have died of other complications not related to disease progression. The 
actuarial 7-year OS was 52%, the PFS 54% and the EFS 36%. The response to mini-BEAM was the most 
important prognostic factor for predicting the long-term probability of surviving the disease: none of the 
eight  patients  who  did  not  respond  to  mini-BEAM  were  alive  at  3  years.  On  multivariate  analysis, 
response to mini-BEAM and extranodal involvement before mini-BEAM had a significant influence on OS.  
Conclusion - Results showed the safety and efficacy of mini-BEAM before ASCT for refractory or relapsed 
Hodgkin's disease patients. 
Raut et al. (2016) reported analysis of all consecutive Hodgkin’s disease patients undergoing AHSCT 
from September 1999 to December 2014. Out of total 38 patients 26 were males and 12 were females. 
Thirty-two were adults and 6 were paediatric (< 18 years). None were elderly. Median age was 28 years 
(9 - 61). All received BEAM protocol as conditioning regimen. Median engraftment time for granulocytes 
was 12 and 14 days for platelets. Thirty three (86.84 %) patients achieved CR out of which 8 (24.24 %) 
had further relapse. Transplant related mortality occurred in 4 (10 %) patients. Finally, 26 (78.78 %) 
patients were disease free at median follow up of 60 months and median DFS was 35 months. DFS was 
66.66  and  65  %,  respectively  on  3  and  5  years.  While  OS  was  70.83  and  70  %  on  3  and  5  years, 
respectively. 
Esbah et al., (2016) - medical records of 62 patients who had undergone AHCT following BEAM (BCNU, 
etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) and high-dose ICE (hICE; ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) 
conditioning  regimens  were  analysed  retrospectively  and  compared  in  terms  of  efficacy.  The  study 
included  a  total  of  29  and  33  patients  diagnosed  with  relapsed/refractory  NHL  and  HL,  respectively. 
Patients received BEAM (n = 37) or hICE (n = 25) regimens for conditioning. One-year OS was 73 ± 6% 
in all patients. One-year OS was 71 ± 8% and 74 ± 9% in the BEAM and hICE groups, respectively (p 
= 0.86).  
The investigators concluded that there was no difference in terms of OS between the BEAM and hICE 
groups. The BEAM regimen has comparable efficacy to hICE in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL and 
HL.

Khattry et al. (2016)  compared  the  CCNU  (200  mg/m2  orally  for  1  day),  cytarabine  (2000  mg/m2 
intravenous  over  12  h  for  2  days),  cyclophosphamide  (1800  mg/m2  intravenously  over  1  -  2  h  for  2 
days) and etoposide (1000 mg/m2 intravenous infusion over 10 h for 1 day) (LACE, n = 75 [male/female: 
56/19];  age:  4  -  58  [median:  23]  years)  and  BCNU  (300  mg/m2  intravenously  for  1  day),  etoposide 
(200 mg/m2 intravenously for 2 days), cytarabine (200 mg/m2 intravenously twice daily for 2 days), 
melphalan  (140  mg/m2  intravenously  for  1  day)  (BEAM,  n  =  64  [male/female:  51/13];  age:  8  -  57 
[median: 25] years) conditioning regimens for toxicity, engraftment kinetics, and efficacy in 139 patients 
undergoing  AHSCT  for  primary  refractory  or  relapsed  lymphoma.  Ninety-two  patients  with  Hodgkin 
lymphoma and 47 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma were enrolled. Seventy-five patients received LACE while 
64  received  BEAM.  The  incidence  of  grade  3-4  oral  mucositis  (9  vs.  38%;  p  <  0.001)  and  parenteral 
nutrition requirement (32 vs. 69%; p < 0.001) were significantly lower in the LACE cohort. The median 
days to myeloid (10 vs. 11; p = 0.007) and platelet engraftment (13 vs. 15; p = 0.026) were shorter 
for the LACE cohort. TRM in the LACE group was 9% compared to 13% in patients treated with BEAM (p 
=  NS).  The  probability  of  OS  and  PFS  at  5  years  for  entire  cohort  was  46  and  41%,  respectively. 
Probability of OS (LACE 46% vs. BEAM 47%; p = NS) and PFS (LACE 37% vs. BEAM 47%; p = NS) at 5 
years was comparable between two groups.  
The  authors  concluded  that  LACE  has  better  toxicity  profile  compared  to  BEAM  and  results  in  similar 
longterm survival in primary refractory or relapsed lymphoma transplant. 
Olivieri et al. (2018) - a retrospective cohort study in 18 Italian centers to compare the efficacy of 
BEAM (BCNU, 300 mg/m2 × 1 day; etoposide, 200 mg/m2 × 4 days; cytarabine, 400 mg/m2 × 4 day; 
melphalan, 140 mg/m2 × 1 day) and FEAM (fotemustine, 150 mg/m2 × 2 days; etoposide, 200 mg/m2 
×  4  days;  cytarabine,  400  mg/m2  ×  4  day;  melphalan,  140  mg/m2  ×  1  day)  regimens  for  ASCT  in 
lymphomas performed from 2008 to 2015. In this study, 1038 patients (BEAM = 607 [female 40.2%; 
age:  16.5  -  79.5  years],  FEAM  =  431  [female  39.2%;  age:  17.2  -  77.8  years]),  of  which  27%  had 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 14% indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and 59% aggressive NHL were 
enrolled.  Baseline  characteristics  including  age,  sex,  stage,  B-symptoms,  extranodal  involvement, 
previous  treatments,  response  before  ASCT,  and  overall  conditioning  intensity  were  well  balanced 
between BEAM and FEAM; notable exceptions were median ASCT year (BEAM = 2011 vs. FEAM = 2013, 
p < 0.001), Sorror score ≥ 3 (BEAM = 15% vs. FEAM = 10%, p = 0.017), and radiotherapy use (BEAM 
= 18% vs. FEAM = 10%, p < 0.001). Response status at day 100 post-ASCT (overall response: BEAM 
= 91% vs. FEAM = 88%, p = 0.42), 2-year OS (83.9%; 95% CI, 81.5% to 86.1%) and PFS (70.3%; 
95% CI, 67.4% to 73.1%) were not different in the two groups. Mortality from infection was higher in 
the FEAM group (subhazard ratio, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.02 to 3.88; p = 0.04). 
It was concluded that BEAM and FEAM do not appear different in terms of survival and disease control. 
Patir et al. (2018) retrospectively analysed 108 relapsed/refractory lymphoma patients who had high-
dose treatments (TECAM and BEAM regimens) followed by AHSCT between October 2012 and February 
2017. TECAM regimen (n = 36 [male/female: 24/12]; age: 28 - 69 [median: 54.5] years) consists of 
thiotepa 40 mg/m2 × 4 days, etoposide 200 mg/m2 × 4 days, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg × 1 day, 
cytarabine  at  200  mg/m2  ×  4  days,  and  melphalan  60  mg/m2  ×  2  days  whereas  BEAM  (n  =  72 
[male/female: 47/25]; age: 20 - 68 [median: 49] years) consists of BCNU 300 mg/m2 × 1 day, etoposide 
at 200 mg/m2 × 4 days, cytarabine 200 mg/m2 × 4 days, and melphalan 140 mg/m2 × 1 day. At a 
median follow-up period of 16 months, the estimated 2-year PFS rates for the TECAM and BEAM groups 
were 55.7% and 52.9%, respectively (p = 0.811). The estimated 2-year OS rate in the TECAM group 
(55.9%) was relatively inferior to that shown in the BEAM group (67%), but the differences were not 
significant (p = 0.238). No differences were observed for time to haematopoietic recovery and duration 
of  hospitalisation.  Incidences  of  transplant-related  infectious  and  noninfectious  complications  were

similar  for  each  conditioning  regimen.  It  was  concluded  that  both  BEAM  and  TECAM  regimens  have 
similar efficacy for lymphoma patients before AHSCT. 
Singer et al. (2019a) retrospectively compared the outcomes of HL patients treated with BEAM (n = 
128  [male/female:  63/65];  age:  19  -  73  [median:  34]  years)  or  BUCYVP16  (n  =  105  [male/female: 
58/47]; age: 19 - 69 [median: 38] years) followed by AHSCT. Patients treated with BEAM were given 
BCNU 300 mg/m2 on day -6, etoposide 100 mg/m2 from days -5 to -2, cytarabine 100 mg/m2 from 
days  -5  to  -2,  and  melphalan  140  mg/m2  on  day  -1.  Patients  treated  with  BUCYVP16  were  given 
intravenously busulfan 0.8 mg/kg every 6 h for 14 doses on days -8 to -5, etoposide 40 mg/kg on days 
-5 to -4, and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg on days -3 to - 2. Haematopoietic stem cells were infused on 
day 0. After a median follow-up of 4.2 years for BEAM and 3.8 for BUCYVP16 from AHSCT, the 5-year 
cumulative incidence of relapse was 29% with BEAM compared with 56% with BUCYVP16 (p < 0.001). 
Median  PFS  and  OS  were  not  reached  with  BEAM  and  were  2.0  and  7.8  years  with  BUCYVP16, 
respectively. Improved PFS (p < 0.001) and OS (p = 0.001) were observed with BEAM for patients who 
needed transplant within 24 months from diagnosis and for patients not in CR (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, 
respectively)  at  AHSCT.  In  this  large  retrospective  comparison,  the  use  of  BEAM  conditioning  before 
AHSCT  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  improved  PFS  and  OS  and  lower  relapse  compared  with 
BUCYVP16. This supports the use of BEAM as a frontline conditioning regimen before AHSCT for early 
relapsed and non-CR HL. 
Similarly, Singer et al. (2019b) compared the outcomes of NHL patients treated with BEAM (n = 269 
[male/female: 170/99]; age: 20 - 77 [median: 60] years) at The Ohio State University and BUCYVP16 
(n = 409 [male/female: 264/145]; age: 27 - 78 [median: 58] years) at the Cleveland Clinic followed by 
AHCT  between  2006  and  2014.  Patients  treated  with  BEAM  were  given  BCNU  300  mg/m2  on  day  -6, 
etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days -5 to -2, cytarabine 100 mg/m2 on days -5 to -2, and melphalan 140 
mg/m2 on day -1. Patients treated with BUCYVP16 were given intravenous busulfan 0.8 mg/kg every 6 
h for 14 doses on days -8 to -5, etoposide 40 mg/kg days -5 to -4, and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg on 
days -3 to -2. Haematopoietic cells were infused on day 0. The primary endpoints were PFS, OS, and 
cumulative  incidence  of  relapse.  Patient  characteristics  between  the  two  groups  were  similar.  After  a 
median follow-up of 3.9 years for BEAM and 4.3 years for BUCYVP16 from AHCT, the rate of relapse (p 
= 0.69), PFS (p = 0.52), and OS (p = 0.11) were similar between the two conditioning regimens. No 
differences in survival outcomes were seen in disease subtypes. Multivariable analysis showed significant 
association toward improved OS with BEAM (HR: 1.56, 95% CI 1.16 - 2.10) (p < 0.01).  
Even though the study is limited by its retrospective nature and some differences in cohort, the findings 
indicated that BEAM could serve as an alternative conditioning regimen prior to AHCT for NHL. 
Weaver et al., (1998) - In a study, 49 patients with low-grade NHL received high-dose chemotherapy 
with  busulfan  and  cyclophosphamide  (BuCy)  or  BCNU,  etoposide,  cytarabine  and  cyclophosphamide 
(BEAC) followed by unpurged autologous peripheral blood stem (PBSC) infusion. All patients had failed 
initial  chemotherapy  or  progressed  after  an 
initial  remission.  PBSCs  were  mobilised  with 
cyclophosphamide  alone  (n  =  1),  cyclophosphamide,  etoposide  (n  =  19),  or  cyclophosphamide, 
etoposide  and  cisplatin  (n  =  29)  followed  by  G-CSF.  Twenty-two  patients  (73%  male;  age:  25  -  62 
[median:  46]  years)  received  busulfan,  16  mg/kg, and  cyclophosphamide,  120  mg/kg.  Twenty-seven 
patients  (41%  male;  age:  22  -  64  [median:  53]  years)  received  BCNU  300  mg/m2,  etoposide  600 
mg/m2,  cytarabine  600  mg/m2,  and  cyclophosphamide  140  mg/kg.  Four  patients  (8%)  died  of  non-
relapse causes, two (9%) in the BuCy group and two (7%) in the BEAC group. Twenty-seven patients 
(55%) relapsed or progressed at a median of 9.4 months (2-38) from PBSC infusion. Ten patients who 
relapsed are alive a median of 31 months (range, 6-47) after relapse. The probabilities of relapse at 3.6 
years for patients receiving BuCy or BEAC were 0.57 and 0.70, respectively (p = 0.92). Twenty-seven 
patients  (55%)  are  alive  at  a  median  of  3.6  years  (range:  1  -  5).  The  probabilities  of  survival  at  3.6

years for patients receiving BuCy or BEAC were 0.58 and 0.55, respectively (p = 0.72). The probabilities 
of EFS at 3.6 years for patients receiving BuCy or BEAC were 0.36 and 0.28, respectively (p = 0.82). It 
was concluded that BuCy and BEAC are an active regimen for the treatment of patients with low-grade 
NHL. 
Zaucha  et  al.  (2008)  -  In  retrospective  comparison  study,  treatment  results  of  two  high-dose 
regimens:  BEAM  (n  =48)  and  BuMelTT  (n  =  59)  in  autologous  transplant  patients  with  NHL  were 
analysed. Patients received BEAM (BCNU 150 mg/m2 intravenously for 60 min infusion on days -6 to -5 
[total dose 300 mg/m2], etoposide 100 mg/m2 intravenously twice daily for 120 min infusion on days-
5 to -2 [total dose 800 mg/m2], cytarabine 200 mg/m2 intravenously for 60 min infusion twice daily on 
days-5 to -2 [total dose 1600 mg/m2] and melphalan 140 mg/m2 intravenously for 120 min infusion on 
day-2)  or  BuMelTT  (busulfan  1  mg/kg/dose  orally  every  6  h  on  days-8  to  -6  [total  dose  12  mg/kg], 
melphalan 50 mg/m2 intravenously for 120 min infusion on days-5 to -4 [total dose 100 mg/m2] and 
thiotepa 250 mg/m2 intravenously for 120 min infusion on days-3 to -2 [total dose 500 mg/m2] from 
1998 to 2005. BEAM group patients were older (mean 59.7 vs. 50.1 years), more advanced (stage ≥ III 
88 vs. 61%), had higher IPI/FLIPI scores (score ≥ 3, 65 vs. 19%), and a higher comorbidity index (HCT-
CI) (score ≥ 2, 40 vs. 19%). Grade 3-4 complications occurred in 10 patients (17%), with six deaths in 
the BuMelTT group vs. none in the BEAM group. CR was achieved in 20 of 36 (56%) BuMelTT vs. 12 of 
39 (31%) BEAM patients. After adjusting for IPI/FLIPI, HCT-CI, age and stage of disease, the hazards of 
death, relapse and treatment failure were similar in both groups.  
It was concluded that BEAM regimen appeared to be equally effective but less toxic than BuMelTT. 
In study by Caballero et al (1997) carmustine was used as part of the BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, 
cytarabine  and  melphalan)  regimen  for  the  preparation  of  HSCT.  This  was  a  prospective  uncontrolled 
trial in 148 in patients with poor prognosis non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin’s disease. The 
median numbers of days to reach engraftment were 20 (range, 11–51), 12 (9–27) and 16 (13– follow-
up  of  30  months  (3–70  months)  for  patients  receiving  BM,  PBSC  or  both,  respectively.  Overall,  at  3 
months,  88  out  of  the  112  NHL  patients  were  in  CR  (81%)  and  12  had  progressed.  In  the  group  of 
patients with HD (n = 36), 83% were in CR at 3 months after the transplant. 
Kasenda et al.(2017) - To investigate safety and efficacy of high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT 
in  relapsed/refractory  PCNSL,  a  single-arm  multicentre  study  was  conducted  for  immunocompetent 
patients (<66 years [51.3% female]) with PCNSL failing high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy. 
Induction consisted of two courses of rituximab (375 mg/m2), high-dose cytarabine (2 × 3 g/m2) and 
thiotepa (40 mg/m2) with collection of stem cells in between. Conditioning for high-dose chemotherapy 
with ASCT consisted of rituximab 375 mg/m2, BCNU 400 mg/m2 and thiotepa (4 × 5 mg/kg). Patients 
commenced high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT irrespective of response after induction. Patients 
not achieving CR after high-dose chemotherapy-ASCT received whole-brain radiotherapy. Primary end-
point  was  CR  after  high-dose  chemotherapy-ASCT.  Thirteen  nine  patients  were  enrolled;  median  age 
and Karnofsky performance score are 57 years and 90%, respectively. About 28 patients had relapsed 
and 8 refractory disease. About 22 patients responded to induction and 32 patients commenced high-
dose chemotherapy-ASCT. About 22 patients (56.4%) achieved CR after high-dose chemotherapy-ASCT. 
Respective 2-year PFS and OS rates were 46.0% (median PFS 12.4 months) and 56.4%; median OS not 
reached. Four treatment-related deaths were recorded. BCNU, thiotepa, and rituximab based high-dose 
chemotherapy-ASCT is an effective treatment option in eligible patients with relapsed/refractory PCNSL. 
Comenzo et al., (2006) - ASCT with high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m2) is the most effective therapy 
for  multiple  myeloma.  To  determine  the  feasibility  of  combining  BCNU  (300  mg/m2)  with  high-dose 
melphalan, 49 patients with previously treated Durie-Salmon stage II/III myeloma (32 male/17 female, 
median age: 53 years) were enrolled on a phase I/II trial involving escalating doses of melphalan (160,

180, 200 mg/m2). The median β2-microglobulin was 2.5 (0 - 9.3); marrow karyotypes were normal in 
88%. The phase I dose-limiting toxicity was ≥ grade 2 pulmonary toxicity 2 months post-SCT. Other 
endpoints  were  response  rate  and  PFS.  High-dose  melphalan  was  safely  escalated  to  200  mg/m2; 
treatment-related mortality was 2% and ≥ grade 2 pulmonary toxicity 10%. The CR and near CR rate 
was 49%. With a median post-SCT follow-up of 2.9 years, the PFS and OS post-SCT were 2.3 and 4.7 
years. PFS for those with CR or near CR was 3.1 years while for those with stable disease it was 1.3 
years (p = 0.06).  
The investigators concluded that BCNU can be combined with high-dose melphalan for myeloma with 
minimal pulmonary toxicity and a high response rate. 
Child  et  al.,  (2003)  –  In  a  multicenter  study,  the  Medical  Research  Council  Myeloma  VII  Trial,  407 
patients  with  previously  untreated  multiple  myeloma  who  were  younger  than  65  years  of  age  were 
randomised to receive either standard conventional-dose combination chemotherapy (short infusion of 
30  mg/m2  doxorubicin  intravenously,  and  30  mg/m2  BCNU  intravenously  on  day  1  followed  by  100 
mg/m2 cyclophosphamide/day orally and 6 mg/m2 melphalan/day orally on days 22, 23, 24, and 25) or 
high-dose therapy (continuous infusion of 9 mg/m2 doxorubicin/day and 0.4 mg vincristine/day on days 
1 through 4, 1 g/m2 methylprednisolone/day intravenously or orally [maximum 1.5 g] on days 1 through 
5, and 500 mg/cyclophosphamide/day intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15) and an autologous stem-cell 
transplant. Among the 401 patients who could be evaluated (standard therapy, n = 200 [male/female: 
110/90], age: 35 - 64 years; intensive therapy, n = 2001 [male/female: 113/88], age: 33 - 66 years), 
the rates of CR were higher in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group (44% vs. 
8%, p < 0.001).  
The rates of PP were similar (42% and 40%, respectively; p = 0.72), and the rates of minimal response 
were lower in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group (3% vs. 18%, p < 0.001). 
Intention-to-treat  analysis  showed  a  higher  rate  of  OS  (p  =  0.04  by  the  log-rank  test)  and  PFS  (p  < 
0.001) in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group. As compared with standard 
therapy, intensive treatment increased median survival by almost 1 year (54.1 months [95% CI, 44.9 
to 65.2] vs. 42.3 months [95% CI, 33.1 to 51.6]). There was a trend toward a greater survival benefit 
in the group of patients with a poor prognosis, as defined by a high β2-microglobulin level (> 8 mg/L).  
The authors concluded that high-dose therapy with autologous stem-cell rescue is an effective first-line 
treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who are younger than 65 years of age. 
Carmustine with total body irradiation 
The Applicant referred  to  5 publication. A total of 334 patients  with haematological  diseases received 
BCNU  intravenously  in  combination  with  TBI/IFR  and  other  chemotherapeutic  drugs  as  conditioning 
treatment before allogenic or autologous HPCT. 
There are one reference related for each of the following malignant haematological disease :NHL, mantle 
cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin’s disease, lymphoma. 
The efficacy endpoints used to evaluate efficacy of conditioning treatment were disease control (relapse 
rate); progression-free survival (PFS)/ disease free-survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).

In study by Fermand et al. (1989) carmustine was used as a part of high dose chemotherapy (BCNU 
120 mg/m2, etoposide 250 mg/m2 and melphalan 140 mg/m2) together with TBI in patients with stage 
III aggressive multiple myeloma. This was retrospective study. Study population was 14 young patients 
(male/female: 8/6; age: 29 - 56 [median: 42.5] years). tumour mass reduction (over 90% in 12 cases). 
Two patients relapsed and died 12 and 15 months after the graft; another one relapsed but is still alive 
at 24 months. Two to 23 months (median 12 months) after the autograft, 10 patients are well either in 
apparent  CR  (2  cases)  or  with  a  state  of  stable  minimal  residual  disease.  Autologous  blood-derived 
haematopoietic stem cells induced successful and sustained engraftment in the 13 evaluable patients. 
No OS, DFS or PFS data were reported. 
The study by Brice at al (1992) was prospective, uncontrolled study in 24 patients with refractory or 
relapsed  NHL  or  Hodgkin's  disease.  Conditioning  regimens  were  CBV,  BEAM,  BEAC  and 
cyclophosphamide + TBI. 
In  study  by Wadhwa et al (2005)  carmustine  was  used  as  part  of  the  BEP  (carmustine,  etoposide, 
cisplatin) regimen for the preparation of HSCT. This was a prospective uncontrolled trial in 101 relapsed 
or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Kaplan-Meier 5-year probabilities of overall survival (OS) 
and disease-free survival (DFS) were 58.6% and 51.1%, respectively. 
Study  by  Vose  et  al  (2013)  was  a  Phase  III  randomized  study  of  rituximab/carmustine,  etoposide, 
cytarabine,and  melphalan  (BEAM)  compared  with  Iodine131  tositumomab/BEAM  with  autologous 
hematopoietic cell transplantation for chemotherapy-sensitive persistent or relapsed diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma.  The  carmustine  was  used  as  a  part  of  conditioning  regimens  B-BEAM  and  R-BEAM.  113 
patients were randomly assigned to R-BEAM and 111 patients assigned to B-BEAM. B-BEAM consisted of  
131I tositumomab (dosimetric dose of 5 mCi on day -19 and therapeutic dose of 0.75 Gy on day -12), 
BCNU 300 mg/m2 (day -6), etoposide 100 mg/m2 twice daily (days -5 to -2), cytarabine 100 mg/m2 
twice  daily  (days  -5  to  -2),  and  melphalan  140  mg/m2  (day  -1)  R-BEAM  consisted  of  rituximab  375 
mg/m2 on days -19 and -12 and the same chemotherapy regimen. Two-year PFS rates, the primary end 
point, were 48.6% (95% CI, 38.6 - 57.8%) for R-BEAM and 47.9% (95% CI, 38.2 - 57%; p = 0.94) for 
B-BEAM, and the 2-year OS rates were 65.6% (95% CI, 55.3 - 74.1%) for R-BEAM and 61% (95% CI, 
50.9 - 69.9%; p = 0.38) for B-BEAM. The 100-day treatment-related mortality rates were 4.1% (95% 
CI, 0.2 - 8.0%) for R-BEAM and 4.9% (95% CI, 0.8 - 9.0%; p = 0.97) for B-BEAM.  
Carmustine without total body irradiation 
In  6  publications,  a  total of  750  patients  with HL, NHL,  lymphomas  received  BCNU  intravenously  and 
other  chemotherapeutic  drugs  without  TBI  as  conditioning  treatment  before  autologous  HPCT.  The 
efficacy  endpoints  used  to  evaluate  efficacy  of  conditioning  treatment  were  disease  control  (relapse 
rate); progression-free survival (PFS)/ disease free-survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).

Nademanee et al. (1995) - In a retrospective study, 85 consecutive patients (male/female: 44/41) 
with 
relapsed  or 
refractory  Hodgkin's  disease  underwent  high-dose 
chemotherapy  or 
chemo/radiotherapy  followed  by  autologous  bone  marrow  (ABMT)  and/or  peripheral  blood  stem  cell 
(PBSC) transplantation. Two preparative regimens were used. Twenty-two patients (26%) without prior 
radiation  received  fractionated  TBI  1,200  Gy  in  combination  with  high-dose  etoposide  60  mg/kg  and 
cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg. Sixty-three patients (74%) with prior radiotherapy received BCNU 450 
mg/m2 instead of fractionated TBI. The median age was 32 years (range: 16 to 56). The median number 
of  prior  chemotherapy  regimens  was  three  (range:  1  to  7).  Forty-three  patients  (51%)  received 
transplants  in  first  relapse  or  second  CR,  whereas  33  (39%)  received  transplants  after  second  or 
subsequent  relapse.  All  relapsed  patients,  except  one,  received  conventional  salvage  chemotherapy 
and/or radiotherapy in an attempt to reduce tumour bulk before transplant. At the time of analysis in 
April 1994, 57 patients (67%) are alive, including 44 (52%) in continuous CR, with a median follow-up 
for the surviving patients of 28 months (range: 7 to 66). Thirty patients (35%) relapsed at a median of 
9  months  (range:  1  to  43).  At  a  median  follow-up  of  25  months  (range:  0.6  to  66),  the  cumulative 
probability of 2-year overall and DFS of all 85 patients is 75% (95% CI 64 - 84%) and 58% (95% CI 47 
- 69%), respectively. Multivariate stepwise Cox regression identified the number of prior chemotherapy 
regimens as the only significant prognostic factor predicting for both relapse and DFS. There were no 
significant differences in the outcome of the treatment between the two preparative regimens. 
Caballero et al. (2003) was a retrospective study in 452 patients (male/female: 257/195) diagnosed 
with diffuse large cell lymphomas (DLCL) treated with high-dose therapy included in the Grupo Español 
de  Linfomas/Trasplante  Autólogo  de  Médula  Osea  (GEL-TAMO)  Spanish  registry.  At  transplantation, 
median age was 42 years (range, 15 - 73), 146 patients (32%) were transplanted in first CR (1st CR), 
19% in second CR (2nd CR) and 47% had active disease: sensitive disease in 157 (35%) patients [95 
were in first PR (1st PR) and 62 in second PR (2nd PR)] and refractory disease in 55 (12%) patients. 
Age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI) was 2 or 3 in 51 patients (12%). Conditioning regimen 
consisted  of  BEAM  (BCNU,  etoposide,  cytarabine  and  melphalan)  in  39%  of  patients,  BEAC  (BCNU, 
etoposide, cytarabine and cyclophosphamide) in 33%, CBV (BCNU, etoposide and cyclophosphamide) in 
10% and cyclophosphamide plus TBI in 12%. Estimated OS and DFS at 5 years were 53% and 43%, 
respectively.  The  TRM  was  11%  (53  cases).  By  multivariate  analysis  three  variables  significantly 
influenced OS and DFS: number of protocols to reach 1st CR, disease status at transplant and TBI in the 
conditioning regimen. Age-adjusted IPI at transplantation also influenced OS.  
Liu  et  al.,  2010  was  a  retrospective  cohort  study  performed  at  a  Canadian  cancer  centre  for  NHL 
patients to compare the acute and long-term toxicities, disease RFS, and OS. The TBI regimen consisted 
of CY/E/TBI (cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg × 1 dose on day -2, etoposide 60 mg/kg × 1 dose on day -
4, and cytarabine 30 mg/m2 (to a maximal dose of 70 mg) given intrathecally on day - 7 and TBI 12 Gy 
in six fractions). The chemotherapy-alone regimen consisted of BEAM (BCNU 300 mg/m2 × 1 dose on 
day -6, etoposide 200 mg/m2 every 12 h × 8 on days -5 to -2, cytarabine 200 mg/m2 every 12 h × 8

on days -5 to -2, melphalan 140 mg/m2 × 1 dose on day - 1). Of 73 patients, 26 (male/female: 21/5; 
age: 24 - 65 [median: 45] years) received CY/E/TBI and 47 (male/female: 29/18; age: 24 - 65 [median: 
48]  years)  received  BEAM.  The  median  follow-up  for  the  CY/E/TBI  group  was  12.0  years  and  for  the 
BEAM  group  was  7.3  years.  After  PBSCT,  no  differences  in  acute  toxicity  were  seen  between  the  two 
groups.  The  5-year  disease  RFS  rate  was  50.0%  and  50.7%  in  the  CY/E/TBI  and  BEAM  groups, 
respectively (p = 0.808). The 5-year OS rate was 53.9% and 63.8% for the CY/E/TBI and BEAM groups, 
respectively  (p  =  0.492).  The  univariate  analysis  results  indicated  that  patients  with  Stage  IV,  with 
chemotherapy-resistant  disease,  and  who  had  received  PBSCT  before  2000  had  inferior  OS.  A  3-way 
categorical  analysis  revealed  that  transplantation  before  2000,  rather  than  the  conditioning  regimen, 
was  a  more  important  predictive  factor  of  long-term  outcome  (p  =  0.034).  The  12-Gy  TBI-based 
conditioning regimen for PBSCT for NHL resulted in diseases RFS and OS similar to those after BEAM. 
PBSCT  before  2000,  and  not  the  conditioning  regimen,  was  an  important  predictor  of  long-term 
outcomes. TBI was not associated with more acute toxicity or pneumonitis. The TBI regimen was similar 
to BEAM. 
Stockerl-Goldstein et al. (1996) - A study in 221 patients with high-risk, relapsed or refractory NHL who 
were treated with either chemotherapy alone (n = 87 [male/female: 36/51]; age: 9 - 61 [median: 48] 
years) or radiochemotherapy (n = 134 [male/female: 47/87]; age: 5 - 59 [median: 42] years) followed 
by ABMT or PBPCT. The patients were assigned preparatory regimens in a non-randomised manner and 
this  analysis  was  performed  to  evaluate  differences  in  outcome  with  the  two  preparatory  regimens. 
Actuarial  5-year  EFS  was  similar  in  patients  receiving  fractionated  (TBI)  plus  etoposide  and 
cyclophosphamide  compared  with  chemotherapy  alone  consisting  of  BCNU  plus  identical  doses  of 
etoposide  and  cyclophosphamide  (52%  vs.  46%,  p  =  0.08).  OS  favored  radiochemotherapy  (61%) 
compared  with  chemotherapy  alone  (53%,  p  =  0.02).  The  relapse  rate  was  the  same  in  both  groups 
(41%),  whereas  the  transplantation-related  mortality  (TRM)  was  similar  in  patients  receiving 
chemotherapy  alone  and  those  receiving  radiochemotherapy  (13%  vs.  7%  respectively,  p  =  0.30). 
Proportional  hazards  analysis  of  significant  variables  including  preparatory  regimen  found  only  the 
number of prior relapses to be predictive of EFS. Fewer number of prior relapses, radiochemotherapy 
and PBPCT were significant predictors of favorable OS. In additional analyses, the improved OS of the 
radiochemotherapy regimen was confirmed only for patients receiving ABMT but was not a significant 
predictor of outcome in patients transplanted with PBPCT.

Clinical studies in special populations 
A  total  of  152  paediatric  patients  with  haematological  diseases  received  BCNU  intravenously,  in 
combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs as conditioning treatment before autologous HPCT. 
The Applicant has provided following table to summarize publications in paediatric patients:

Carmustine shall not be used in paediatric population and is contra-indicated in the SmPC due to a high 
risk of severe pulmonary toxicity (see also Clinical Safety section).  
Supportive study(ies) 
Data  from  retrospective  registry  studies  are  presented  above.  The  Applicant  provided  information 
regarding supportive studies with BCNU as part of the conditioning regime in allo-HCT. Studies dealing 
with BCNU as part of the conditioning regime in allo-HCT to treat NHL, HL or AML which were not selected 
as main studies but include at least 20 patients were considered as supportive studies. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The studies presented by Applicant in the clinical overview regarding use of carmustine as a conditioning 
regimen prior autologous HCPT in adult patients included two Phase I studies, which were deemed not 
relevant to the new indication and 39 retrospective studies.  
The  study  by  Moormeier  et  al.,  (1990)  was  a  phase  I  trial  to  determine  the  MTD  and  toxic  effects  of 
BCNU when given in combination with high-dose cyclophosphamide and thiotepa. The study by Ager et 
al  (1996)  investigated  the  toxicity  in  3  patient  groups  receiving  3  doses  of  carmustine.  No  efficacy 
endpoints were assessed in this study. The study provided data related to the safety of carmustine dose 
escalation within BEM regimen.  
Two described studies regarding use of carmustine as a conditioning regimen prior allogenic HPCT were 
prospective, uncontrolled studies, and 3 other retrospective studies. In all studies carmustin was used 
as a part of conditioning regimen. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics characteristics across 
the studies varied. Three studies included patients over 60 years of age.   
Several  retrospective  studies  compared  BEAM  with  other  conditioning  regimens,  namely,  ICU,  LACE, 
FEAM,  TECAM,  BUCYVP16,  BuMelTT  or  modified  regimens  (dexa-BEAM,  BEAC).  Other  retrospective 
studies compared BEAC with BuCy or carmustine to rituximab, thiotepa, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin. 
Only two publications were related to use of carmustine as a part of conditioning regimen in patients 
with multiple myeloma. 
Recent publication by Joffe, Rosenberg, Rozovski et al. (2018), Wais et al (2018), Chen et al, 2015 (a 
large retrospective study of 4,917 patients with NHL and HL who underwent AHCT from 1995-2008 using 
the  most  common  HDT  platforms:  BEAM,  CBV,  BuCy  and  containing  TBI)  was  submitted;  this  study 
supports  findings  of  the  efficacy  of  BEAM  in  HL;  Sivaraj  et  al,  2018  (High-dose  BCNU/Melphalan 
conditioning regimen before autologous stem cell transplantation in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma), 
comprehensive review by Isidori et al (2016). According to the publication by Joffe, Rosenberg, Rozovski 
et  al.  (2018)  replacing  carmustine  with  thiotepa  and  cyclophosphamide  for  autologous  haemopoietic 
stem  cell  transplantation  provided  comparable  efficacy  and  safety  with  possible  advantage  in  older 
patients. 
The  study  by  Ingram  et  al  compared  two  regimens  of  BEAM  with  and  without  TBI  and  addition  of 
aletuzumab and demonstrated comparable outcome of patients with relapsed advanced stage follicular 
lymphoma treated with either BEAM-auto or BEAM-allo HSCT. 
Study  by  Law  et  al  concluded  that  CBV  as  a  preparative  regimen  for  allogeneic  transplantation  has 
acceptable toxicity and is an effective therapy in patients with relapsed or high-risk NHL. A proportion 
of these patients achieve long-term survival despite an aggressive disease status before HCT. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/332634/2020 
Page 82/108 
 
 
  
  
Rossi et al concluded that CBV is a safe and an effective alternative to TBI-containing regimens before 
allogeneic SCT for NHL. 
Several  retrospective  studies  compared  BEAM  with  other  conditioning  regimens,  namely,  ICU,  LACE, 
FEAM,  TECAM,  BUCYVP16,  BuMelTT  or  modified  regimens  (dexa-BEAM,  BEAC).  Other  retrospective 
studies compared BEAC with BuCy or carmustine to rituximab, thiotepa, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin. 
The study by Martin et al (2001) was a retrospective study on long term results in patients who received 
mini-BEAM as salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous transplantation. 
The  study  by  Fernández-Jiménez  et  al.(1999)  was  retrospective  study  summarizing  experience  with 
mini-BEAM  salvage  chemotherapy  to  reduce  tumor  burden  prior  to  peripheral  blood  stem  cell 
transplantation (PBSCT). 
The study by Martin et al (2015) aimed to retrospectively analyze the feasibility and outcomes of HDT, 
with BEAM at full dosage and hematopoietic stem cell support, in patients > 65 years old, treated for 
aggressive or relapsed lymphoma.  
The study by Raut et al. (2016) was retrospective study and did not include elderly patients. Median age 
was 28 years (9 - 61).   
The study by Esbach et al (2016) was retrospective study comparing efficacy of BEAM and high-dose 
ICU in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL and HL. The efficacy was considered comparable with more 
adverse effect observed in ICU group. 
The study by Khattry et al. (2016) was retrospective study comparing two conditioning regimens – LACE 
and  BEAM  in  patients  with  primary  refractory  or  relapsed  lymphoma.  Te  authors  concluded  that  that 
LACE is a better tolerated HDT regimen compared to BEAM in lymphoma transplant. LACE is associated 
with  lesser  transplant-related  toxicides.  However,  a  well-executed,  case-matched  control  study  with 
contemporary  registry  data  comparing  LACE  with  BEAM  is  required  to  determine  which  is  superior  in 
terms of overall survival. 
The study by Patir et al. (2018) was retrospective study comparing efficacy of TECAM and BEAM regimens 
in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma. 
The  study  by  Weaver  et  al.,  (1998)  compared  BEAC  with  high-dose  chemotherapy  with  busulfan  and 
cyclophosphamide (BuCy). This study did not include elderly patients. 
Nine  studies  mainly  able  to  demonstrate  efficacy  of  BCNU  in  conditioning  regimes  for  AHCT  in  the 
indications HL and NHL have been identified by the literature search. The studies are all retrospective 
analyses comparing different conditioning regimes, especially comparing BEAM to other regimes where 
BCNU is substituted. 
The studies classified as supportive studies mainly compare different BCNU-containing regimes against 
each other (e.g. BEAM vs. CBV vs. BEAC), or BCNU-regimes against TBI or BCNU-regimes against totally 
different regimes. 
Three studies with more than 100 patients could be identified to evaluate efficacy of BCNU containing 
regimes in allo-HCT. Further studies using FBM, BEAM or CBV regime show that BCNU-containing regimes 
have been tested and used in routine use in the last decades for allo-HCT. The low numbers of patients 
treated  as  well  as  the  uncontrolled  design  of  the  studies  clearly  hamper  the  value  of  these  studies. 
However, allo-HCT is used in HL and NHL patients when AHCT has not been successful or is not indicated, 
thus  allo-HCT  can  be  one  of  the  last  options  for  treatment.  Therefore,  high  patient  numbers  and 
comparative  designs  cannot  be  expected  in  this  setting.  Taken  this  into  consideration,  the  available 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/332634/2020 
Page 83/108 
 
 
  
  
studies clearly show efficacy of use of conditioning regimes including BCNU prior to all-HCT in HL and 
NHL patients. 
The  three  studies  about  use  of  FBM  in  AML  treatment  have  in  total  included  440  patients  and  their 
results, despite the lack of a control, demonstrate some efficacy in relation to other treatment options. 
The evidence provided by Applicant regarding use of carmustine with TBI was very limited. There was 
only  one  randomized,  controlled  prospective  study.  Although  carmustine  was  a  part  of  conditioning 
regimens in the study by Brice at al (1992), TBI was not used in combination with these regimens but 
only with cyclophosphamide.  
In regards to the use of carmustin without total body irradiation, only one study was prospective, non-
randomized study (Stockler-Goldstein et al., 1996).   
The magnitude of published evidence on efficacy of carmustine in other malignant haematological 
diseases as well as in allogenic HSCT is rather limited and can be partly explained by the shortage of 
carmustine supply noted in several publications and allogenic HSCT being a relatively new treatment 
modality compared to autologous HSCT.  Provided data in allogenic HSCT was sparse. Only three 
studies have been identified by the MAH as studies mainly supporting the evaluation of efficacy of 
BCNU-containing conditioning regimes for allo-HCT. In two of these studies mainly AML patients have 
been treated and the FBM regime (fludarabine, BCNU and melphalan) has been used. Of note, these 
studies had no comparative design. However, Bertz et al. compared their results with a similar group 
of the same treatment period, age and disease and found lower values (a significance analysis has not 
been provided) (Marks et al. 2008; Bertz et al. 2016). Robinson et al. compared a small proportion of 
patients conditioned with BEAM prior to allo-HCT for HL and NHL patients to higher number of patients 
treated with fludarabine-based conditioning regimes. They could not show a difference in survival 
outcomes (Robinson et al. 2002).  
Therefore, the submitted literature regarding use of carmustine prior to allo-HSCT was considered not 
sufficient for approval of the proposed indication, while the submitted published studies were deemed 
to support the use of carmustine prior to auto-HSCT. In this application bibliographic evidence was 
considered sufficient only for Hodgkin’s disease and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Therefore, reference to 
all malignant haematological diseases was too broad and the indication was restricted to focus on HL 
and NHL.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It is acknowledged that Carmustine is a well-known active substance with recognised efficacy as a part 
of different conditioning regimens for several decades. 
The final proposed indication - as conditioning treatment prior to autologous haematopoietic progenitor 
cell transplantation (HPCT) in malignant haematological diseases (Hodgkin´s disease / Non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma), is supported by the submitted bibliographic evidence. The efficacy of Carmustine as part 
of a conditioning regimen has been adequately documented. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The application is based on submitted published literature data covering time period from 1990 – 
2018. Overall, 84 publications were submitted in support to the proposed indication. Submitted data

set comprises 37 articles related to carmustine use in haematological malignancies (except  Hodgkin’s 
and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma), including one overview of the treatment approaches for haematological 
malignancies and one case report; 24 articles related to Hodgkin’s lymphoma; 15 articles related to 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, including 1 case report; 2 articles related to both Hodgkin’s lymphoma and 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; 1 overview of allogenic haemopoietic cell transplantation; 1 study on 
allogenic cell transplantation for not-specified malignancies; 1 study including patients with solid 
tumours and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; 1 paper describing Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome in 3 patients 
following to allogenic haemopoietic cell transplantation and chemotherapy regimen including 
carmustine (1 patient with fallopian tube cancer, 1 patient with testicular cancer and 1 patient with 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma); 1 article for neurological patients undergoing allogenic haemopoietic cell 
transplantation, and 1 article reviewing chemotherapy treatment regimens for various types of 
haematological malignancies. Some of those articles have limited utility for the safety evaluation.  
Patient exposure 
The retrospective analyses in total included 8,402 patients. Main and supportive studies included in 
total a 14,024 patients - 8,402 in main studies; 5,622 in supportive studies) and of these 9,951 
patients in total - 5,775 in main studies and 4,176 in supportive studies have been treated with BCNU 
as part of the conditioning regimen prior to AHCT for HL, NHL and AML.  
The safety data from literature are derived from a population with mostly malignant haematological 
diseases. Some limited exposure to patients with non-malignant diseases was also reported. The 
proposed dosing regimen of 300 – 600 mg/m2 is within the range of the studied dose for the proposed 
indication (the high-dose regimen studied for conditioning treatment prior to HPCT was 800 mg/m2 for 
adult population). The underlying diseases for which HPCT was being administered included myeloid 
leukaemia, Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, other malignant and non-malignant conditions. 
Conditioning regimens included variable agents other than carmustine (BCNU): vincristine, 
procarbazine, chlorambucil cyclophosphamide, melphalan and prednisolone.    
Adverse events 
Acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia after administration of BCNU in combination with other drugs or with 
radiation has been reported in seven patients; three with multiple myeloma (Mills et al., 1971; Rosner 
& Grünwald, 1974; Preisler & Lyman, 1977), one with Hodgkin´s disease (Foucar et al., 1979), one 
with non-Hodgkin´s lymphoma (Zarrabi et al., 1979) and two with malignant brain tumours (Cohen et 
al., 1976; Vogl, 1978). One patient developed cancer of the pancreas after receiving BCNU with other 
drugs for treatment of non-Hodgkin´s lymphoma (Jochimsen et al., 1976) and one patient developed 
cancer of the floor of the mouth after therapy with a combination including BCNU for multiple myeloma 
(Penn, 1976). 
In an abstract, two cases of acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia were reported among 76 cases of 
Hodgkin´s disease assigned randomly to a combination regimen of BCNU, vincristine, procarbazine and 
chlorambucil. The ratio of observed to expected leukaemia cases in this group was 250 (Pajak et al., 
1979). In a follow-up study of 364 patients with multiple myeloma, more than 239 received BCNU and 
all received melphalan, a known human leukemogen. Fourteen cases of acute nonlumphocytic 
leukaemia were observed, compared with 0.07 cases expected (relative risk [RR] = 214) (Bergsagel et 
al., 1979). 
In the Medletter (N.Y., US) from 2003 toxicity of BCNU is given as acute symptoms; nausea and 
vomiting including local phlebitis, whereas delayed toxicity is bone marrow depression (cumulative) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/332634/2020

with delayed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, pulmonary fibrosis, delayed renal damage, liver 
damage, leukaemia, myocardial ischaemia and veno-occlusive disease of liver (after transplantation 
dose). 
Ocular toxicity has been reported in patients given BCNU and seems to be more likely when given into 
the carotid artery, although it was also seen with high-dose intravenous therapy (Shingleton et al., 
1982; Greenberg et al., 1984). Lennan & Taylor (1978) describes a patient with multiple myeloma and 
plasma cell leukaemia developed severe, acute bilateral optic neuroretinitis eight days after 
chemotherapy with BCNU, procarbazine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone. The patient showed 
some return of function over the following six weeks before death. On the other hand, Cruciani et al. 
(1994) describes the lack of ocular toxicity in six patients with advanced nonpretreated colorectal 
cancer who received high doses of BCNU and mitomycin. No patient had any changes in visual acuity 
or complained of any subjective visual loss. There were no pathologic alterations of the orthoptic 
examination results, the anterior segment, or the fundus. There is some evidence that the alcohol 
diluent used to prepare BCNU solutions may contribute to the retinopathy (Greenberg et al., 1984)  
Studies have found a high incidence of fatal pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated with BCNU for 
gliomas during childhood e.g., patients who were treated before five or six years of age were more 
likely to die of pulmonary fibrosis than those treated at later age (O´Driscoll et al., 1995; Lohani et al., 
2004). However, there are reports of pulmonary toxicity and upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis occurring 
in adults given BCNU and high-dose chemotherapy (Parish et al., 2003; Holoye et al., 1976). Brian & 
Madtes (2012) describes that numerous studies in lymphomas, malignant gliomas and breast cancer 
have established a strong correlation between BCNU dose and pulmonary toxicity. The incidence of 
pulmonary toxicity is < 10 % when cumulative BCNU doses are < 800 mg/m2 body surface as a single 
agent, but in combination with other cytotoxic drugs, particular cyclophosphamide, the tolerated dose 
is lower. Several studies have demonstrated that doses of 600 mg/m2 body surface or higher are 
associated with an increased risk of pneumonitis, and for many years 450 mg/m2 body surface has 
been considered the upper dose limit of BCNU. Aronin et al. (1980) reports that symptomatic 
pulmonary disease occurred in 20 % of 93 patients with anaplastic gliomas being treated with BCNU, 
and that there is a relation between the occurrence of pulmonary toxicity and the total cumulative 
dose of BCNU.   
Pulmonary toxicity characterised by pulmonary infiltrates and/or fibrosis has been reported to occur 
with a frequency ranging up to 30%. This may occur within three years of therapy and appears to be 
dose related with cumulative doses of 1,200 - 1,500 mg/m2 being associated with increased likelihood 
of lung fibrosis. Risk factors include smoking, the presence of a respiratory condition, pre-existing 
radiographic abnormalities, sequential or concomitant thoracic irradiation and association with other 
agents that causes lung damage.     
Conditioning treatment prior to HPCT 
Allogeneic HPCT 
In a prospective phase II study, 30 adults with primary refractory or recurrent intermediate- or low-
grade lymphoma were treated with BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan) and marrow or 
blood stem cells from an HLA-identical donor on day 0. Median maximal regimen- related toxicity 
(RRT) grade was 2, and four patients (13%) had a grade 3 - 4 regimen related toxicity. Two patients 
had idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis. One patient had primary graft failure, and a second had 
autologous reconstitution documented at 3 months post-transplant (Przepiorka et al., 1999). 
In a study, 126 patients with relapsed, advanced stage follicular lymphoma who received BEAM (BCNU 
[300 mg/m2 day-6], cytarabine [200 mg/m2 twice daily day-5 to day-2], etoposide [200 mg/m2 day-
5 to day-2], melphalan [140 mg/m2 day-1])-alemtuzumab [10 mg/day or 20 mg/day days-5 to -1]

allogeneic HSCT (BEAM-allo) (n = 44) or BEAM-autologous HSCT (BEAM-auto) (n = 82). There were 
three deaths in the BEAM-auto group and 10 deaths in the BEAM-allo group that were identified at 
latest follow-up and attributed to non-relapse cause. The cumulative incidence of NRM at 1 year was 
2% vs. 20% respectively (p = 0.001). The cause of death in the BEAM-allo group was identified as 
bacterial sepsis (n = 2), adenovirus infection (n = 2), cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis and 
aspergillosis (n = 1), pseudomonas infection (n = 1), multi-organ failure (n = 2), thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (n = 1) and splenic rupture (n = 1). All three patients in the BEAM-auto 
group died of bacterial sepsis. At the time of censoring of the data, secondary malignancies were 
identified in five patients within the BEAM-auto group [three MDS, two Hodgkin disease] and one 
patient in the BEAM-allo group (MDS) (Ingram et al., 2008). Fifteen patients with Philadelphia 
chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) who were ineligible for allogeneic 
bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or interferon-α (INFα) therapy were included in this study. Eight 
patients were in the first late chronic phase, five were in the second chronic phase, one was in the 
accelerated phase, and one was in the blastic phase. Autologous bone marrow cells (median: 2.5 Å~ 
108 nucleated cells/kg) were stored at a median of 30 months after diagnosis. Patients were treated 
with cyclophosphamide (1.5 g/m2 daily for 4 days), BCNU (300 mg/m2), and etoposide (250 mg/m2 
daily for 3 days) (CBV), followed by reinfusion of autologous bone marrow. Haematopoietic recovery 
was rapid, and toxicity was mild to moderate in 14 patients. One patient died of CMV pneumonitis. 
Eight of 15 patients showed Ph suppression to < 90% Ph-positive metaphases after autologous BMT. 
Major cytogenetic responses (Ph suppression to < 35% Ph-positive metaphases) developed in four 
patients. Cytogenetic responses were observed in 4 of 11 patients infused with 100% Ph positive 
marrows, and in all 4 patients infused with Ph-mosaic marrows (mixture of diploid and Ph-positive 
cells). Better results were observed when autologous BMT was performed in the chronic phase 
compared with the advanced phases. The major cytogenetic responses have lasted for 3, 4, 12, and 
15+ months, whereas minor cytogenetic responses lasted for only a short time (< 2 months). Three of 
seven patients (43%) in the chronic phase with previous resistance to INFα therapy became sensitive 
to INFα therapy after autologous BMT. The authors concluded that intensive chemotherapy followed by 
autologous BMT produced cytogenetic remissions in patients with Ph-positive CML and re-induced 
disease sensitivity to INFα therapy in patients phase and stem cells are collected at a time of previous 
cytogenetic remission (Kantarjian et al., 1991). 
Sixty-five patients with haematological malignancies (25 multiple myeloma, 18 Hodgkin's disease, 22 
NHL) who received a BCNU-based regimen followed by autologous PBPC transplantation, were studied 
retrospectively to evaluate the incidence of post-transplant non-infective pulmonary complications 
(NIPCs), risk factors predictive of NIPCs, and response to steroids. BCNU given intravenously at a dose 
of 600 mg/m2 was combined with etoposide and cyclophosphamide in 40 patients (CBV regimen) and 
with etoposide and melphalan in 25 patients(BEM regimen). Seventeen of 65 patients (26%) had one 
episode of NIPCs. The median time to NIPCs was 90 days (52 - 289). Factors that increased the risk of 
developing NIPCs on multivariate analysis were female sex (p < 0.001) and CBV regimen (p < 0.05). 
All patients with NIPCs received prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight for 10 days then tapered 
by 5 mg every two days; complete response (CR) to steroids was achieved in 15 of 17 patients; one 
unresponsive patient died of interstitial pneumonia. BCNU given at the dose of 600 mg/m2 is well 
tolerated when associated with melphalan and etoposide. In females and in patients receiving BCNU 
with cyclophosphamide, a BCNU dose reduction may be advisable (Alessandrino et al., 2000). 
Buser et al. (2007) compared 10 patients (group A) treated with BEAM chemotherapy followed by 
delayed RIC HSCT at day 28 with 11 patients receiving BEAM followed immediately by fludarabine/TBI 
and allogeneic HSCT (group B). Non-haematological WHO toxicity grades were comparable for skin, 
mucosa, lung and infectious toxicities. Gut toxicity was more frequent and more severe in group B 
(median grade 0 (range: 0 - 1) vs. 2 (range: 1 - 3, p = 0.01)). Pain/malaise was, on the other hand,

more frequent and severe in group A: median 2.5 (range: 0 - 3) vs. 0 (range: 0 - 2, p = 0.01). Days 
in aplasia, days on antibiotics and length of hospital stay were significantly longer in group A. In a 
study, 31 patients with relapsed or be at high risk for subsequent relapse of NHL were received BCNU 
(15 mg/kg), etoposide (60 mg/kg), and cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg) on days -6, -4, and -2, 
respectively, followed by allogeneic HCT. NRM (n = 8) included infection (n = 3), GVHD (n = 2), 
diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (n = 1), veno-occlusive disease in the setting of concurrent acute GVHD of 
the liver (n = 1), and leukoencephalopathy (n = 1) (Law et al., 2006). 
The toxicity of cyclophosphamide, BCNU, and etoposide (CBV) as a suitable chemotherapyonly regimen 
was evaluated in 18 NHL patients. There was one case of regimen-related interstitial pneumonitis that 
developed on day 17. One patient was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis 6 months after transplant; 
this patient was also found to have severe non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Three patients with a 
history of prior radiation therapy did not experience significant pulmonary toxicity. Three patients were 
diagnosed with mild veno-occlusive disease of the liver; serum bilirubin remained less than 4 g/dL in 
all cases. One patient developed a mild chronic hepatitis of unknown aetiology 7 months after 
transplant and another developed pancreatitis after 11 months; both of these conditions resolved 
spontaneously. Sepsis syndrome developed in 3 patients (Rossi et al., 2003).  
Autologous HPCT 
In a phase I dose escalation study, 40 patients (male/female: 19/21; age: 22 - 62 [median: 43] 
years) with refractory solid tumours or NHL were treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide (2.5 g/m2 
given intravenously over 1 h on days -6, -4, and -2 [total dose, 7.5 g/m2], thiotepa (225 mg/m2 given 
intravenously over 1 h on days -6, -4, and -2 [total dose, 675 mg/m2)], and BCNU (50 - 250 mg/m2 
given intravenously over 1 h on days -6, -4, and -2 [total dose, 150 - 750 mg/m2]), followed by 
autologous stem cell rescue. Non-haematologic toxicity varied markedly in severity. Most patients 
experienced some degree of gastrointestinal toxicity. Mild to moderate nausea and vomiting were seen 
in 26 (65%) of the patients. Moderately severe mucositis, limiting oral intake, was seen in 30 (75%) 
patients. Diarrhea was also a problem, occurring in 23 (58%) of the patients. Hemorrhagic 
complications were seen in 21 patients. Infectious complications were seen during both the period of 
neutropenia and after haematopoietic recovery. The dose-limiting toxic effect was delayed drug-
induced pulmonary disease, seen in three patients who received 660 - 750 mg of BCNU/m2 in 
combination with cyclophosphamide and thiotepa. The early death rate due to toxic effects was 20%; 
all deaths were attributed to sepsis or respiratory failure. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
BCNU, when used in combination with 7.5 g of cyclophosphamide/m2 and 675 mg of thiotepa/m2, 
therefore appears to be 562.5 mg/m2 (Moormeier et al., 1990). The morbidity and TRM of CBV and 
BEAM were compared in 113 patients with NHL (n = 69) and Hodgkin's disease (n = 44) undergoing 
ASCT between 1990 - 2004. CBV (cyclophosphamide, 6000 mg/m2; etoposide, 750 mg/m2; and high-
dose BCNU, 800 mg/m2) was administered to 75 patients (male/female: 43/32; age: 18 - 62 [median: 
36] years) and 38 (male/female: 19/19; age: 18 - 70 [median: 48] years) received BEAM (BCNU, 300 
mg/m2; etoposide, 800 mg/m2; cytarabine, 800 mg/m2; melphalan, 140 mg/m2). Patients in the 
BEAM group had a significantly higher median age (p = 0.002) and were more heavily treated before 
ASCT (p = 0.003). More patients showed active disease at transplant in the BEAM group (p = 0.04). 
Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) was more frequent in the CBV group (11% vs. 0%, p = 0.048). 
There were 20 (18%) transplant-related deaths, 18 in the CBV and two in the BEAM group. Infectious 
complications (12 patients, seven with pneumonia) and SOS (four) were the most frequent causes of 
death. The cumulative incidences of TRM were 25% in the CBV and 7% in the BEAM group (p = 0.02). 
CBV thus produced a higher incidence of SOS and TRM than BEAM in this series (Puig et al., 2006). 
Between January 1996 and July 2002, 72 patients with NHL or Hodgkin's disease underwent high-dose 
chemotherapy with ASCT conditioned with either cyclophosphamide, etoposide, BCNU (CEB) or BCNU,

etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan (BEAM) at a single institution. In all, 52 patients (male/female: 
34/18; age: ≥ 15 years) received CEB (cyclophosphamide, 1500 mg/m2 Å~ 4 days; etoposide, 250 
mg/m2 Å~ 4 days [twice daily]; BCNU, 150 mg/m2 Å~ 4 days) and 20 patients (male/female: 13/7; 
age: ≥ 15 years) received the BEAM (BCNU, 150 mg/m2 Å~ 2 days; etoposide, 100 mg/m2 Å~ 4 days 
[twice daily]; cytarabine, 200 mg/m2 Å~ 4 days [twice daily]; melphalan, 140 mg/m2 Å~ 1 day) 
regimen. Patient characteristics that were significantly different between the two groups are tumour 
grade and extranodal involvement (p = 0.0196, 0.0341, respectively). Regimen-related toxicities 
examined yielded only diarrhea occurring at a higher rate in the BEAM group (81 vs. 51%, p = 
0.0026), although cases were milder (92 vs. 57%). Patients treated with CEB developed mucositis at a 
slightly higher rate (79%) than patients treated with BEAM (75%), but this difference did not reach 
statistical significance. However, the mucositis that occurred within the BEAM group was predominately 
mild (67%) in contrast to the predominance of moderate to severe cases in the CEB group (74%). In 
addition, patients treated with CEB required growth factor support for a longer time than patients 
treated with BEAM (p = 0.0399). Response rates were high in both groups, with trends favoring the 
BEAM group. OS was higher after treatment with BEAM than with CEB (84 vs. 60%) (Wang et al., 
2004). 
In a study, 24 patients (male/female: 17/7; age: 18 - 59 years) with resistance or relapse Hodgkin's 
disease were treated with mini-BEAM therapy to achieve a state of minimal residual disease prior to 
transplantation. There were no treatment-related deaths. Myelosuppression was the main toxicity. 
Non-haematologic toxicities, such as gastrointestinal side effects and mucositis, were mostly mild. 
There were neither transplantation-related deaths nor secondary leukaemia/ myelodysplasia (MDS) 
(Fernández-Jiménez et al., 1999). 
In another study, 131 patients (age: 13 - 57 years) with relapsed or primary refractory Hodgkin's 
disease were treated with a dose-intensive therapy protocol consisting of CBV (etoposide [2400 
mg/m2 continuous intravenous infusion] cyclophosphamide [7200 mg/m2 intravenously], and BCNU 
[300 - 600 mg/m2 intravenously]. The regimen was generally well-tolerated with 103 (79%) patients 
having none to moderate (grade 0 - 2) side-effects. There were 25 deaths from regimen-related 
toxicity: infection in 9 patients (7%); veno-occlusive disease in 6 patients (4%); interstitial 
pneumonitis in 4 patients (3%) and CNS hemorrhage in 3 patients (2%); cardiac toxicity in 2 patients 
(2%) and one patient (1%) died of renal failure. Two patients (2% of total) developed a secondary 
MDS and died approximately one- and four-years following transplantation. The regimen related 
mortality rate was 25% in the 62 patients transplanted prior to July 1990, and 13% afterwards (p = 
0.06). This was due to a decline in the pulmonary hepatic and infection related toxicity (Fleming et 
al., 1999). 
 A single-arm multicentre study was conducted for immunocompetent patients (<66 years) with PCNSL 
failing high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy to investigate safety of high-dose chemotherapy 
followed by ASCT in relapsed/refractory PCNSL. Induction consisted of two courses of rituximab (375 
mg/m2), high-dose cytarabine (2 × 3 g/m2) and thiotepa (40 mg/m2) with collection of stem cells in 
between. Conditioning for high-dose chemotherapy-ASCT consisted of rituximab 375 mg/m2, 
carmustine 400 mg/m2 and thiotepa (4 × 5 mg/kg). During high dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT 
haematological toxicities were most common as expected, but infections (65.6%), fever (50.0%) and 
mucositis (40.6%) were additional toxicities. Four (10.3%) treatment-related deaths were recorded: 
three patients with fatal sepsis (one during induction and two after high-dose chemotherapy-ASCT) 
and one case of treatment-associated CNS toxicity (after high-dose chemotherapy-ASCT without 
whole-brain radiotherapy before or after high-dose chemotherapy-ASCT) (Kasenda et al., 2017). 
In a study, 100 consecutive patients with malignant lymphoma treated with high-dose chemotherapy 
(BCNU 300 mg/m2 day 1, etoposide 200 mg/m2 days 2 - 5, cytarabine 400 mg/m2/24 h days 2 - 5,

melphalan 140 mg/m2 day 6) and ASCT, followed at least 1-year post-transplant, are reported, 68 
with NHL and 32 with Hodgkin's disease. Forty-one patients have died following the transplant, 27 
directly from relapse of lymphoma and 14 directly from treatment-related causes. Five cases of MDS 
and 2 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were observed among the 100 patients, 2 of whom had 
Hodgkin's disease and 5 NHL (Geisler et al., 1998). 
In another study, 119 patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's disease received high-dose 
therapy followed by autologous haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation. Six patients died within 
100 days of transplantation and 5 died at a later date of transplant-related complications. Secondary 
malignancies have developed in 6 patients, including MDS/leukaemia in four patients and solid 
tumours in two patients (Horning et al., 1997). 
A cohort of 76 patients with previous chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease (n = 27 [male/female: 
19/8]) and NHL (n = 49 [male/female: 27/22]) received high-dose BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine and 
melphalan (BEAM) followed by ASCT and was followed for relapse and development of leukemic 
complications. Six patients, four with Hodgkin's disease and two with NHL, developed leukemic 
complications, MDS in four cases and overt AML in two. All six showed an abnormal karyotype, in four 
of them highly characteristic of therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) and therapy-related AML (t-AML). The 
cumulative risk of t-MDS and t-AML increased from 16 months after start of the primary chemotherapy 
for lymphoma and reached 17.3% (SE 8.5%) after 74 months. If calculated from start of BEAM and 
ASCT, the cumulative risk increased as early as 4 months and reached 24.3% (SE 12.9%) after 43 
months. For the whole course of the disease, the RR of AML was 357 (95% CI: 43 - 1290), as two 
overt leukaemias were observed vs. 0.0056 expected cases of de novo AML. In the present cohort the 
risk of t-MDS and t-AML although high, did not differ from the previous experience in patients treated 
conventionally for Hodgkin's disease and NHL, and did not differ for patients receiving stem cells 
isolated from the bone marrow as compared to patients receiving stem cells isolated from peripheral 
blood. Antecedent chemotherapy seems to be the critical factor for the development of t-MDS and t-
AML rather than the BEAM and ASCT regimen, which however may accelerate the evolution of the 
disease (Pedersen-Bjergaard et al., 1997).  
Between February 1989 and December 1996, 70 consecutive patients (male/female: 36/34; age: 17 - 
53 years) with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease who received high-dose chemotherapy (BCNU, 
etoposide, cytarabine and cyclophosphamide) followed by autologous stem cell rescue were analysed. 
Of the 70 patients, 14 (20%) had non-relapse events, possibly related to the transplant procedure. 
Thirteen patients died. One patient who developed NHL of the cecum approximately 3.3 years after 
transplant received treatment and is currently alive 6 years post-transplant. Nine events occurred 
within 100 days; cardiopulmonary toxicity accounted for 8 of these early events. Eight of the nine 
patients who had early treatment-related mortality were transplanted before January 1993. 
Treatment-related related mortality occurred in only one of 24 (4%) patients transplanted after 
January 1993. Of the five patients with late non-relapse events, 3 developed secondary haematologic 
malignancies, including AML (one patient) and NHL (two patients) at 3.1-, 3.3- and 1.5-years post-
transplant. Interestingly, the latter two patients developed NHL involving the cecum. The karyotype of 
the bone marrow cells in the patient who developed AML was complex (44, XY, 2Y, 23, 25, 27, 111, 
217, 221, 1mar1, 1mar2, 1mar 3) in all cells (Lancet et al., 1998). 
Harrison et al. (1999) reported a retrospective comparative study of 4576 patients with Hodgkin's 
disease from the BNLI (British National Lymphoma Investigation) and UCLH Hodgkin's databases, 
which includes 595 patients who have received a transplant. Statistical analysis including Cox's 
proportional hazards multivariate regression model with time-dependent covariates was employed. 
This analysis reveals that the risk of developing MDS/AML was dominated by three factors, namely 
quantity of prior therapy (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.49 - 2.71, for each treatment block, p < 0.0001) and

whether the patient had been exposed to MOPP (mustine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisolone; RR 
3.61, 95% CI 1.64 - 7.95, p = 0.0009) or lomustine (CCNU) chemotherapy (RR 4.53, 95% CI 1.96 - 
10.44, p = 0.001). Following adjustment for these factors in the multivariate model the RR associated 
with transplantation was 1.83 (95% CI 0.66 - 5.11, p = 0.25). This study provides no evidence of a 
significantly increased risk of MDS/AML associated with BEAM therapy and autologous transplantation 
in Hodgkin's disease. Concern over MDS/AML should not mitigate against the timely use of this 
treatment modality. 
Jang et al. (2002) reported a case of 28-yearr-old female patient who developed treatment related 
MDS/AML with characteristic chromosomal abnormalities including 11q23 chromosomal rearrangement 
following high-dose chemotherapy with ASCT for NHL. The patient was admitted with bulky abdominal 
masses of B cell lineage NHL. After 2 cycles of systemic chemotherapy of the Vanderbilt regimen, the 
patient underwent ASCT with high dose chemotherapy of the BEAC regimen. She also received 
radiation of 48 Gy for the residual periportal lymphadenopathy. The initial cytogenetic analysis of the 
infused mononuclear cells revealed a normal karyotype. Twenty-two months after the ASCT, 
pancytopenia was noted and her bone marrow aspirate showed dysplastic hemopoiesis with 
myeloblasts up to 12% of nonerythroid nucleated cells. The patient was diagnosed as treatment 
related MDS (refractory anaemia with an excess of blasts). Cytogenetic analysis showed complex 
chromosomal abnormalities including 11q23 rearrangement, which is frequently found in 
topoisomerase II inhibitor-related haematologic malignancies. Four months later, it was noted that the 
treatment related MDS had evolved into an overt treatment related AML. Cytogenetic analysis showed 
an evolving pattern with more complex abnormalities. The patient was treated with combination 
chemotherapy, but her leukemic cells were resistant to the therapy. van der Lelie et al. (1995) 
described 3 patients who developed haemolytic uremic syndrome 4 to 6 months after high dose 
chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell support. One patient was conditioned with BEAC 
(BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, and cyclophosphamide) and received autologous bone marrow. The 
other two underwent triple peripheral stem cell transplantation after conditioning with CTC 
(carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and thiotepa). Symptoms were hypertension, microangiopathic 
haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal insufficiency. One patient had a retinal vein 
thrombosis. One patient died of a cardiac arrest shortly after the diagnosis was made. The remaining 
two achieved a PR: one with fresh frozen plasma without plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma but 
improved on high dose intravenous immunoglobulin and vincristine. It was concluded that Haemolytic 
uremic syndrome is a serious complication of the more intensive chemotherapy made possible by stem 
cell support. Because of the rapidly growing indications for this approach, an increase in this type of 
vascular complication is expected. 
A study performed by Reece et al. (1999) compared the RRT and overall NRM in Hodgkin's disease 
patients conditioned with either CBV (cyclophosphamide, BCNU, and etoposide) (26 patients) or CBVP 
(CBV + cisplatin) (68 patients) followed by ASCT. CBVP included a continuous infusion rather than 
intermittent doses of etoposide, a lower BCNU dose and the addition of cisplatin. RRT and NRM were 
determined for each regimen and compared; risk factors for each were examined by multivariate 
analysis. Grade IV (fatal) RRT occurred in five patients (pulmonary in two, cardiac in two, and CNS in 
one). Eighteen patients experienced grade II -III pulmonary RRT, consistent with BCNU damage in 15. 
Prior nitrosourea exposure was the main risk factor for pulmonary RRT. Grade II mucosal and hepatic 
RRT occurred less often after CBVP vs. CBV (p = 0.031 and 0.0003, respectively). In addition, three 
other early and eight late non-relapse deaths were seen. Median follow-up of the entire group is 5.1 
(range: 2.8 - 10.2) years. The probability of overall NRM was 26% (95% CI 13 - 50%) with CBV vs. 
23% (95% CI 12 - 41%) with CBVP (p = 0.40). The PFS and relapse rates were similar. Although the 
rates of fatal RRT, pulmonary RRT and overall NRM were similar with CBV or CBVP, CBVP produced less 
mucosal and liver RRT with a comparable antitumour effect.

A total of 297 adult patients who qualified for ASCT with NHL, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, 
and acute myeloid leukaemia were analysed to determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of 
neutropenic enterocolitis after high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT. Patients were conditioned with 
BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan (BEAM); melphalan alone; or busulfan and cyclophosphamide 
(BuCy) and transplanted with peripheral blood or bone marrow CD34+ cells. Diagnosis of neutropenic 
enterocolitis was established in case of neutropenic fever, abdominal pain or diarrhea, and bowel wall 
thickening > 4 mm on abdominal sonography. Neutropenic infections occurred in 262 patients (88%). 
Neutropenic enterocolitis was diagnosed in 32 patients (12%), a median +3 (1 - 5) days after SCT. 
Bloodstream infections were present in 18 patients, with Gram-negative bacteria in 11 patients. All 
patients were treated conservatively with carbapenems and total parenteral nutrition with bowel rest. 
The course of disease was complicated by ileus or septic shock in 9 patients and was fatal for 3 (9.6%) 
patients. In univariate analysis, the initial diagnosis of NHL (p = 0.017) and conditioning with BEAM (p 
= 0.043) had prognostic value. In multivariate analysis, only initial diagnosis of NHL (p = 0.017) had 
prognostic significance. It was concluded that neutropenic enterocolitis is a rare but severe 
complication in patients undergoing ASCT. Gram-negative bacteria remain the main causative 
pathogen. Abdominal sonography allows early diagnosis and treatment, effective in most of patients 
without surgery. In this analysis, neutropenic enterocolitis was seen more often in NHL patients 
treated with a BEAM regimen (Gil et al., 2013).  
Forty consecutive adult patients with primary refractory (n = 7) or relapsed (n = 33) Hodgkin's disease 
received high-dose BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cisplatin, and melphalan) followed by autologous PBPC 
infusion in a study. Twenty-four patients (60%) received high-dose BEAM as outpatients. Consolidative 
radiation therapy was administered to 14 patients (35%). Severe non-haematologic toxicities included 
gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea 17%, mucositis 25%), and interstitial pneumonitis (15%). One 
patient died of acute transplant-related complications (mortality rate 2.5%) (Argiris et al., 2000). 
Medical records of 62 patients who had undergone AHCT following BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, 
and melphalan) and high-dose ICE (hICE; ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) conditioning 
regimens were analysed retrospectively and compared in terms of adverse effects. The incidences of 
nausea/vomiting (grade ≥ 2) (84% vs. 44.7%; p = 0.04) and mucositis (grade ≥ 2) (13% vs. 3%; p 
= 0.002) were higher in the hICE group compared to the BEAM group. In addition, significantly more 
hepatotoxicity of grade ≥ 2 (40% vs. 2.7%; p < 0.005) and nephrotoxicity of grade ≥ 2 (48% vs. 
2.7%; p < 0.005) were observed among patients who received hICE. Significantly more patients (n = 
4; 25%) in the hICE group experienced veno-occlusive disease (VOD) compared to the BEAM arm, 
where no patients developed VOD (p=0.01). The investigators concluded that significantly more 
adverse effects were observed among patients treated with hICE compared to BEAM. The BEAM 
regimen seems to be more toxic than the hICE in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL and HL (Esbah 
et al., 2016). 
In a retrospectively study, the clinical aspects of the BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, and 
cyclophosphamide  (BEAC, n = 56) and BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM, n = 28) 
regimens for ASCT were evaluated in NHL. BEAM patients had significantly more frequent World Health 
Organisation grade greater than or equal to 2 diarrhea than BEAC patients (46.4 vs. 19.6%, p = 
0.010), but the incidence of mucositis, nausea/vomiting, and bleeding and the number of episodes of 
febrile neutropenia and septicaemia did not differ between the two groups. It was concluded that 
regimen-related toxicities were similar, except that BEAM was associated with more frequent but 
acceptable diarrhea (Jo et al., 2008).  
Olivieri et al. (2018) conducted a retrospective cohort study in 18 Italian centers to compare the 
safety of BEAM (n = 607) and FEAM (n = 431) regimens for ASCT in lymphomas performed from 2008 
to 2015. FEAM conditioning resulted in higher rates of gastrointestinal and infectious toxicities,

including severe oral mucositis grade ≥ 3 (BEAM = 31% vs. FEAM = 44%, p < 0.001), and sepsis from 
Gram-negative bacteria (mean isolates/patient: BEAM = 0.1 vs. FEAM = 0.19, p < 0.001) compared to 
BEAM. Zaucha et al. (2008) analysed treatment results of two high-dose regimens: BEAM (n = 48; 
BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) and BuMelTT (n = 59; busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa) in 
autologous transplant patients with NHL. Grade 3 mucositis was observed significantly more often in 
the BuMelTT group than in the BEAM group: 67 vs. 12% of patients, respectively (p < 0.0001). Life-
threatening, Grade 3 and 4 complications occurred only in 10 (17%) patients treated with BuMelTT. 
There were four cases of liver failure in the BuMelTT group compared to none in the BEAM group (p = 
0.13), 10 cases of pulmonary failure in the BuMelTT group compared to none in the BEAM group (p = 
0.002) and seven cases of cardiotoxicity among BuMelTT patients compared to one among the BEAM 
patients (p = 0.07). Six treatment-related deaths occurred in the BuMelTT group resulting from acute 
respiratory distress syndrome, severe idiopathic pneumonitis, multi-organ failure, veno-occlusive 
disease, systemic aspergillosis and cardiac arrest. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 95 (89%) of 
patients: 53 of 58 (91%) in the BuMelTT, and 42 of 49 (86%) in the BEAM group. Infection was 
documented in 40 (75%) patients receiving BuMelTT, due to viral (n = 14) (8 CMV), fungal (n = 5) (2 
aspergillosis) and bacterial (n = 33) vs. 26 (62%) patients receiving BEAM due to 6 viral (2 CMV), 5 
fungal (1 aspergillosis) and 22 bacterial cases. 
In a phase I/II trial, intravenous BCNU (300 mg/m2 on day -4) with activity against myeloma (n = 49 
[male/female: 32/17]; age: 34 - 69 years), was combined with escalating doses of intravenous 
melphalan (160, 180, 200 mg/m2) for myeloma patients undergoing SCT. There was one treatment-
related death in phase II due to sepsis associated with the transfusion of bacterially contaminated 
platelets that resulted in multi-organ failure. Therefore, 100-day treatment related mortality, was 2% 
(1/49). Overall, one patient had grade 4 pulmonary toxicity with grade 3 hypoxia and four had 
asymptomatic grade 2 pulmonary toxicity at 3 months post- SCT without hypoxia. Of 16 patients with 
baseline diffusing capacity from 50 - 70% predicted, one developed grade 4 pulmonary toxicity, while 
of 30 patients with diffusing capacity > 71% at baseline, four developed grade 2 toxicity. Although 
there was a minimal decrement in diffusing capacity at 2 months post-SCT in the majority of patients, 
by 12 months post-SCT there was recovery and overall improvement (Comenzo et al., 2006). 
A total of 43 relapsed and refractory HL patients underwent autologous haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (AHSCT) between January 1992 and December 2004, were received an intensified 
regimen of etoposide 2,400 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 7,200 mg/m2 and BCNU 600 mg/m2 (VCB). 
Grade III-IV RRT was 9% (n = 4). The 1-year cumulative incidence of interstitial pneumonitis was 
36%, however only two patients died of interstitial pneumonitis complications. Disease progression 
was the most common cause of death (n=10, 23%) (Benekli et al., 2008). 
Fifty-one consecutive patients with Hodgkin's disease have been treated with high-dose chemotherapy 
(cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and BCNU) and transplantation of autologous bone marrow (n = 44), 
autologous bone marrow plus PBSC (n = 2), PBSC (n = 1), syngeneic (n = 1), or allogeneic bone 
marrow (n = 3). The main toxicity encountered with the CVB regimen was interstitial pneumonia (IP), 
seen in four of 15 patients (27%) receiving ≥ 600 mg/m2 of BCNU. Three of these patients have died 
(Schmitz et al., 1993). 
Burns et al. (1995) analysed patient, disease, and treatment related factors associated with long 
term DFS in 62 patients with refractory or recurrent Hodgkin’s disease treated with high-dose 
cyclophosphamide (6000 mg/m2), BCNU (300 mg/m2), and etoposide (900 mg/m2) (CBV) followed by 
ASCT. There were no deaths resulting from toxicity of the preparative regimen, and all 62 patients 
survived the peri-transplant period. The median time to absolute neutrophil count recovery to ≥ 0.5 × 
109 L was 26 days. The major non-haematologic toxicity was bacteraemia in 12 patients. Three 
patients developed an idiopathic non-interstitial pneumonitis which resolved uneventfully on

antibiotics. One patient developed respiratory syncytial virus and 1 patient CMV pneumonia, and an 
additional patient had both CMV and aspergillus pulmonary infections. Two patients who developed 
clinical evidence of veno-occlusive disease during the transplant course were managed conservatively 
with resolution of symptoms. A study was to prospectively evaluate the retinal and optic nerve 
changes in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous haematopoietic 
progenitor cell support (AHPCS). One hundred and forty patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy 
and AHPCS underwent extensive pre- and post-transplant ophthalmologic evaluations for development 
of retinal microvascular complications. One hundred and ten patients received high-dose 
cyclophosphamide (1875 mg/m2/day Å~ 3), cisplatin (165 mg/m2 Å~ 1) and BCNU (600 mg/m2 Å~ 
1); thirty received identical doses of cyclophosphamide and cisplatin but received paclitaxel (135 
mg/m2 to 825 mg/m2) instead of BCNU. Thirty-four patients (24%) had retinal findings of either 
cotton wool spots (CWS) (n = 20) or retinal hemorrhages (n = 18) during follow-up, which ranged 
from 1 to 12 months. Ten (7%) of these patients, all of whom received BCNU, showed ocular toxicity 
characterised by CWS 1 to 4 months post-transplant (n = 10); optic disc edema (n = 3); and variable 
vision loss associated with the onset of BCNU-induced pulmonary toxicity. Retinal and optic disc 
microvascular complications may occur after high-dose chemotherapy followed by AHPCS. The 
association of ischemic retinal lesions and/or optic disc edema with BCNU-induced pulmonary toxicity 
and the lack of ocular toxicity in patients that did not receive BCNU may suggest that BCNU is the 
etiologic agent (Johnson et al., 1999). 
A 46-year old male patient diagnosed with PCNSL was admitted to a hospital for high-dose 
chemotherapy followed by ASCT. Conditioning regimen consisted of BCNU 400 mg/m2 intravenously 
over 3 h on day -6 and thiotepa 5 mg/kg on days -5 and -4. Ondansetron 8 mg and 
methylprednisolone 125 mg were administered as premedication 40 min prior to the BCNU infusion on 
day -6. One hundred and thirty minutes after the infusion began, the patient developed violent chest 
pains radiating into the jaw accompanied by tachycardia and hypertension (185/95 mmHg). The BCNU 
infusion was stopped, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed sinus tachycardia 
and ST depression in leads II, aVE, V5 - V6. The chest pain finally resolved after administration of 
sublingual nitrates and intravenous morphine. ECG returned to baseline after 90 min. In conclusion, 
high-dose c BCNU cardiotoxicity is rarely encountered in a clinical setting but considering the common 
use of this drug in ASCT, this side effect deserves to be known and recognised (Waibel et al., 2012). 
Carmustine with total blood irradiation From January 1993 to October 2002), 101 relapsed or 
refractory NHL patients were treated with high-dose chemotherapy (BCNU 600 mg/m2, etoposide 2400 
mg/m2, and cisplatin 200 mg/m2) and autologous transplantation. Within 3 weeks before 
transplantation, 70 patients received IFR 20 Gy to sites of currently active (> 2 cm) or prior bulky (> 5 
cm) disease. Four patients (4%) died within 30 days of stem cell infusion (1 pulmonary embolism, 2 
septicaaemias with multi-organ failure, and 1 progressive lymphoma). Two patients (2%) developed 
interstitial pneumonitis most likely secondary to high-dose BCNU. Neither of these patients had 
received radiation therapy to the mediastinum. Three cases (3%) of secondary acute myelogenous 
leukaaemia occurred (Wadhwa et al., 2005).  
Carmustine without total blood irradiation 
In a study, 85 consecutive patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's disease underwent high-dose 
chemotherapy (BCNU, etoposide and cyclophosphamide) or chemo/radiotherapy (etoposide and 
cyclophosphamide) followed by autologous bone marrow (ABMT) and/or peripheral blood stem cell 
(PBSC) transplantation. Eleven patients (13%) died of transplant-related complications including veno-
occlusive disease of the liver in five, acute and late interstitial pneumonitis in three, graft failure in 
one, cerebral hemorrhage in one, and therapy-induced MDS/acute leukaemia in one patient. Three 
patients developed therapy-induced MDS at 9, 10, and 29 months post-ABMT. The estimated 
Assessment report

Page 94/108 
 
 
  
  
probability of developing monotherapy-induced MDS/acute leukaemia was 3% (95% CI, 0.7 - 11%) 
and 6% (95% CI, 2 - 17%) at 2 and 3 years, respectively (Nademanee et al., 1995). 
Wheeler et al. (2001) observed a higher frequency of secondary malignancies in patients with 
Hodgkin's disease than in patients with NHL undergoing high dose therapy with the same non - TBI 
conditioning regimen. Three hundred patients with Hodgkin's disease and NHL were treated with 
cyclophosphamide, BCNU and etoposide and autologous stem cell support from 1986 through 1994. 
Median follow up of survivors is 3.9 years. Five-year survival is 51% for Hodgkin's disease and 48% for 
NHL. Eleven patients developed second malignancies (9/150 treated for Hodgkin's disease vs. 2/150 
treated for NHL) a median of 2.4 years from transplantation and 5.2 years from initial diagnosis. Six 
patients had MDS or AML and 5 had lymphomas or solid tumours. Actuarial risk of MDS/AML at five 
years for patients transplanted for non- HL is 3% (95% CI 0.6 - 9.6%). Hodgkin's disease patients had 
significantly different pre-treatment characteristics than patients with NHL. A Cox model showed that 
greater number of prior relapses and prior radiation therapy were significant risk factors for the 
development of MDS/AML. These data suggested that CBV is associated with a lower risk of secondary 
MDS/AML than TBI containing regimens and that much of the risk is associated with the 
pretransplantation therapy. The use of autotransplantation early in the course of therapy for relapsed 
lymphoma might prevent some cases of MDS/AML. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The incidence of pulmonary toxicity is < 10 % when cumulative BCNU doses are < 800 mg/m2 body 
surface as a single agent, but in combination with other cytotoxic drugs, particular cyclophosphamide, 
the tolerated dose is lower. Several studies have demonstrated that doses of 600 mg/m2 body surface 
or higher are associated with an increased risk of pneumonitis, and for many years 450 mg/m2 body 
surface has been considered the upper dose limit of BCNU. Aronin et al. (1980) reports that 
symptomatic pulmonary disease occurred in 20 % of 93 patients with anaplastic gliomas being treated 
with BCNU, and that there is a relation between the occurrence of pulmonary toxicity and the total 
cumulative dose of BCNU. An equation that allows prediction of pulmonary toxicity during the course of 
therapy with BCNU is presented. Pulmonary toxicity characterised by pulmonary infiltrates and/or 
fibrosis has been reported to occur with a frequency ranging up to 30%. This may occur within three 
years of therapy and appears to be dose related with cumulative doses of 1,200 - 1,500 mg/m2 being 
associated with increased likelihood of lung fibrosis. Risk factors include smoking, the presence of a 
respiratory condition, pre-existing radiographic abnormalities, sequential or concomitant thoracic 
irradiation and association with other agents that causes lung damage.  
Pulmonary toxicities which is a major safety issue for carmustine, were reported in both the adult and 
paediatric populations, including fatal outcomes. Risk factors for pulmonary toxicity may be previous 
lung disease, a history of smoking, or chest radiotherapy. According to Alessandrino etr al (2000) the 
increased toxicity was noticed in females. 
Overdose 
The main symptom of intoxication (overdose) is myelosuppression. In addition, the following serious 
side effects may occur: liver necrosis, interstitial pneumonia and encephalomyelitis. BCNU contains 
0.57 vol% ethanol which means 7.68 g per dose.

Laboratory findings 
No data on clinical laboratory data from the literature were available and discussed in this safety 
overview. 
There was no systematic reporting of clinical laboratory parameters available from this overview. Some 
biochemistry parameters were mentioned with respect to liver toxicity. There was also no reporting on 
vital signs or physical findings. 
Safety in special populations 
Limited experience is available for older patients. Martin et al. (2015) presented a retrospective 
analysis of 73 consecutive patients (male/female: 54/19) aged over 65 years treated for aggressive or 
relapsed lymphoma by high-dose chemotherapy with BEAM (BCNU 300 mg/m2 on day -7, etoposide 
100 mg/m2 every 12 h on days - 6 to -3, cytarabine 100 mg/m2 every 12 h on days -6 to -3 and 
melphalan 140 mg/m2 on day - 2)) at full dosage followed by ASCT. Patient data were obtained from 
medical charts from two institutions. Median age was 67 years (65 - 74). Significant comorbidities 
were present in 24.7% of patients. The median number of days for grade 4 neutropenia was 9 (5 - 
18). The early treatment- related mortality rate (< 100 days) was 2.7%. The estimated 2-year PFS 
and OS rates were 67.2% and 78.5%, respectively. In conclusion, the full-dose high-dose 
chemotherapy- ASCT regimen is feasible, safe and efficient in selected patients over 65 years old. 
Paediatric patients 
Paediatric patients were represented in a few published studies, although not clinically relevant to this 
application, since carmustine is not intended for use in this population.  
In a retrospective analysis, 24 paediatric patients (age: 7 - 21 years; median: 17 years) with primary 
refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease were received high-dose therapy regimens consisted of 
cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg) and etoposide (60 mg/kg) combined with either BCNU (n = 17; 10 - 
15 mg/kg), CCNU (n = 11; 6 mg/kg), or fractionated TBI (n = 6). Five patients succumbed to 
treatment-related toxicities, of whom 4 died of pulmonary failure. Fifteen patients (44%) developed 
post-AHCT idiopathic diffuse lung injury syndrome: acute alveolitis (n = 2); diffuse alveolar 
hemorrhage (n = 2); acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 2); delayed interstitial pneumonitis (n 
= 8); and bronchiolitis obliterans (n = 1). The following factors did not predict for the development of 
a diffuse lung injury syndrome in univariate analysis: prior treatment with bleomycin, pre-high-dose 
therapy pulmonary function tests, and prior thoracic irradiation (Frankovich et al., 2001). 
In a prospective study, the safety and efficacy of cyclophosphamide, BCNU, and etoposide (CBV) 
conditioning and APBSCT was evaluated in children (n = 69) with relapsed or refractory HL (n = 39 
[49% male]; median age: 14.5 years) and NHL (n = 30 [70% male]; median age: 12.8 years). All 6 
patients receiving 450 mg/m2 of BCNU developed grade III or IV pulmonary toxicity with onset 
between 30 to 60 days post-transplant. Four of the 6 required supplemental oxygen (duration 5 days 
to 9 months) and 5 received steroids. All but 2 came off supplemental oxygen therapy after a few 
days. One patient developed persistent abnormal pulmonary function testing’s but came off oxygen 
after 9 months. The other patient relapsed 6 months after transplant while on steroids and oxygen.  
Carmustine Obvius is contra-indicated in paediatric patients.  
Elderly 
Safety data in elderly patients were reported in at least one study (Martin et al, 2015) where 
increased frequency of AEs and therefore increased risk to certain ADRs cannot be excluded.

Fertility 
There is currently minimal data on fertility outcomes in premenopausal women undergoing ASCT with 
BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan (BEAM) conditioning. A retrospective analysis of fertility 
outcomes in premenopausal females aged between 18 and 40 years who underwent BEAM/ASCT for 
lymphoma between 1995 and 2011 was performed at four transplant centres. Of 41 premenopausal 
women who underwent BEAM conditioning, 25 met the inclusion criteria with the main exclusion 
criterion being inadequate documentation. Eighteen had Hodgkin lymphoma, and seven had non-
Hodgkin lymphoma. Median number of chemotherapy regimens pre-transplant was 2 (1 - 3). 
Seventeen women (68%) with a median age at transplant of 25 years (range: 17 - 33) recovered their 
menses. The comparative group without recovery was older with a median age of 34 years (range: 20 
- 40) (p = 0.007). Ten patients, with a median age at transplant of 22 years (range: 17 - 30), had 15 
naturally conceived pregnancies.   
Pregnancy 
Since high-dose conditioning with AHCT is contraindicated in pregnant woman, therefore publications 
about such cases were not to be expected. Brice et al. (1994) reported two cases of normal 
pregnancy after high dose chemotherapy and ASCT in two of the 72 women belonging to a group of 
188 patients transplanted in clinical unit for advanced malignant lymphoma. These pregnancies 
occurred 19 and 33 months after high dose therapy in two women aged 27 and 28, neither of whom 
had received previous TBI or pelvic radiotherapy.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Carmustine in combination with; 
- 
phenytoin and dexamethasone (alone or together) results in reduced activity of antiepileptic 
medicinal products. Phenytoin used as anticonvulsant drug in patients receiving chemotherapy is 
reported to interact with BCNU to give unexpected low phenytoin levels and thereby seizures. 
Bollini et al. (1982), reports of a case where a patient receives phenytoin 350 mg/day and 
phenobarbital 100 mg/day together with a combination of antineoplastic drugs including BCNU, 
vinblastine and methotrexate. Plasma concentrations of phenytoin dropped from 9.4 to 5.6 μg/mL 
and partial seizures occurred. In another case Grossman et al. (1989) describes that in patients 
given BCNU and cisplatin ten out of 17 patients receiving phenytoin required an increase in their 
daily dose to maintain therapeutic levels, whereas Gattis & May (1996) in a review article 
reported one case of interaction between phenytoin and dexamethasone in which phenytoin 
concentrations were decreased, which lead to inadequate seizure control and further medical 
complications and decreased quality of life. Finally, Ghosh et al. (1992) reports of patients 
receiving BCNU 900 - 1,050 mg/m2 body surface together with irradiation or in combination with 
other chemotherapeutics, that phenobarbital and carbamazepine levels remained relatively stable, 
but all patients required increased doses of phenytoin anticonvulsant therapy after beginning 
chemotherapy with BCNU. The increase in phenytoin dose ranged from 50 - 300 % above baseline. 
- 
cimetidine, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist is used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. 
Despite its clinical effectiveness and relative lack of toxicity, a number of isolated reports suggest 
that cimetidine may be responsible for a severe, but usually reversible leukopenia and 
thrombocytopenia. Alone cimetidine has been associated with bone-marrow toxicity (James & 
Prout, 1978; Chang & Morrison, 1979; Carloss et al., 1980) but together with BCNU this 
effect is magnified. Selker et al. (1978) reported that six out of eight patients receiving triple 
therapy (80 mg/m2 BCNU for three days, 300 mg cimetidine every six hours and steroids in 
variable dose levels) demonstrated nadirs well below that normally attributed to the chemotherapy

alone (white cell count < 500 and platelet count < 8,000), and the authors concluded that 
cimetidine magnifies bonemarrow depression. Volkin et al. (1982) showed that the use of 
cimetidine together with BCNU (and cranial irradiation) enhanced the myelosuppressive effect of 
the cytotoxic therapy e.g. neutrophil cell count averaged 2,160 ± 240/μL without cimetidine and 
650 ± 220/μL with the contemporary use of cimetidine. Further cimetidine interacts with BCNU 
indirectly due to binding to cytochrome P450 isoenzyme-system in the liver with subsequent 
inhibition of microsomal oxidative metabolism and degradation of BCNU. 
- 
digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used in the management of supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly 
atrial fibrillation and in heart failure. A study in patients undergoing antineoplastic therapy found 
that the absorption of digoxin from tablets was reduced by an average of 46.6 % whereas that of 
digoxin from liquid-filled capsules was not significantly changed (Bjornsson et al., 1986). 
Another study (Kuhlmann, 1982) with patients undergoing antineoplastic therapy found that the 
steady-state concentration of digoxin after giving acetyl-digoxin was reduced, but that digitoxin 
concentrations were maintained. It was suggested that the interaction was due to reduced 
absorption of digitalis glycosides through the damaged gastrointestinal mucosa and that liquid-
filled capsules or digitoxin might be preferred in these patients. The study by Kuhlmann (1982) 
was cited by Marcus (1985) and adds that the inhibition of digoxin absorption is reversible after 
one week and that the damaged to the gastrointestinal mucosa therefore is temporary. Finally, 
Graves et al. (1989) investigated the factors underlying the hypertension seen as a complication 
in autologous bone marrow transplantation when therapy includes multiple alkylating agents. Out 
of 18 patients 15 developed hypertension usually eight to ten days after the beginning of 
chemotherapy. The authors suggest a relationship between digoxin-like immune-reactive factor 
and blood pressure in hypertensive patients treated with multiple alkylating agents (Graves et al., 
1989). 
-  melphalan, a nitrogen mustard alkylating drug, results in increased risk of pulmonary toxicity. This 
was shown in a study by Zulian et al., (1989) where 38 patients with treated Hodgkin´s disease 
were given high dose combination chemotherapy using melphalan, BCNU and etoposide (a 
topoisomeriase inhibitor) in different combinations for autologous bone marrow transplantation. 
The most severe toxicity of the drug combination was respiratory failure. There were seven toxic 
deaths from this cause, five occurring before four months and two late deaths. The clinical cause 
was acute pneumon itis leading to adult respiratory distress syndrome and autopsy showed 
interstitial pneumonitis compatible with drug-induced damage and no residual Hodgkin´s disease. 
The authors conclude that combination of doses of 600 mg/m2 body surface BCNU and 140 mg/m2 
body surface melphalan represents an additive toxic effect and a high rate of toxic deaths due to 
lung damage (Zulian et al., 1989).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, 84 publications were submitted in support to the proposed indication. Submitted data set 
comprises 37 articles related to carmustine use in haematological malignancies (except Hodgkin’s and 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma), including one overview of the treatment approaches for haematological 
malignancies and one case report; 24 articles related to Hodgkin’s lymphoma; 15 articles related to 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, including 1 case report; 2 articles related to both Hodgkin’s lymphoma and 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; 1 overview of allogenic haemopoietic cell transplantation; 1 study on 
allogenic cell transplantation for not-specified malignancies; 1 study including patients with solid 
tumours and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; 1 paper describing Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome in  3 patients 
following to allogenic haemopoietic cell transplantation and chemotherapy regimen including 
carmustine (1 patient with fallopian tube cancer, 1 patient with testicular cancer and 1 patient with 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma); 1 article for neurological patients undergoing allogenic haemopoietic cell 
transplantation, and 1 article reviewing chemotherapy treatment regimens for various types of 
haematological malignancies.  
The safety data from literature are derived from a population with mostly malignant haematological 
diseases. However, some limited exposure to patients with non-malignant diseases was also reported. 
The proposed dosing regimen of 300 – 600 mg/m2 is within the range of the studied dose for the 
proposed indication (the high-dose regimen studied for conditioning treatment prior to HPCT was 800 
mg/m2 for adult population). The underlying diseases for which HPCT has been administered included 
myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, other malignant and non-malignant 
conditions. Conditioning regimens included variable agents other than carmustine (BCNU): vincristine, 
procarbazine, chlorambucil cyclophosphamide, melphalan and prednisolone.  The combination with 
other cytotoxic drugs hampers assessment of AE’s causality for carmustine. Furthermore, safety 
outcomes for carmustine strongly correlates with the Disease Risk Index.  
Patient exposure seems sufficient to assess the safety profile of carmustine for the newly proposed 
indication. However, a major shortcoming for the safety data presented is lack of a systematic 
reporting of AEs in the publications. Furthermore, some studies reported and discussed the serious 
adverse events only. Cumulative overview of safety population and data obtained from studies where 
severity of AEs was reported – were submitted. As expected, the most frequently reported severe AE 
was pulmonary toxicity. Severity increases by increasing the dose and most frequently was reported 
with the dose 45-700 mg/m2. Lower incidence in the 800-1000 mg/m2 group was more likely related 
to a very small sample.   
The applied dose in the new indication is two to three times higher (300-600mg/m2) compared to the 
dosage in the approved indications (150-200mg/m2).   
The effect of the dose increase has been discussed including information about studies investigating 
safety issues between different carmustine dosages and an evaluation of the line-listing which is based 
on studies included in the updated Clinical Overview. Different doses have been compared in the line-
listing and it was concluded that higher dose of BCNU increases the risk of adverse events, such as the 
risk for pulmonary toxicity. A warning statement regarding pulmonary toxicity has been included in the 
SmPC: “High-dose therapy with carmustine (especially with 600 mg/m2) prior to haematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation has been shown to increase the risk for incidence and severity of pulmonary 
toxicities. Therefore, in patients with other risks for pulmonary toxicities, use of carmustine needs to 
be weighed against the risks.” 
Pulmonary toxicities, a major safety issue for carmustine, were reported in both the adult and 
paediatric populations, including fatal outcomes. Risk factors for pulmonary toxicity may be previous 
lung disease, a history of smoking, or chest radiotherapy. Alessandrino et al. (2000) and Chen et al. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/332634/2020

(2015) noticed an elevated risk to develop pulmonary toxicities in females. This is addressed in the 
newly updated SmPC which includes a warning that high-dose carmustine increases incidence and 
severity of pulmonary toxicities. It was suggested that use of oral contraceptives might be associated 
with the elevated risk of pulmonary toxicities in females, however there was a lack of evidence 
supporting this hypothesis. 
The results from provided literature review can be used to characterize the safety profile in the new 
indication. The type of ADRs reported are generally in line with what is known from the safety profile of 
carmustine in the approved indications. In summary, use of carmustine before HPCT can cause all 
severity grades gastrointestinal disorders, haemorrhagic complications, ocular toxicity, interstitial 
pneumonitis, pulmonary complications, liver toxicity, veno-occlusive disease, and MDS.  
Furthermore, warning statements regarding cardiac, renal, nervous system disorders and infectious 
diseases have been included in the SmPC which seems acceptable.  
Electrolytic abnormalities grade 3-4 have been observed in 0.6 % of patients in the 300 mg group and 
in 4.6% of the 600 mg group. The occurrence of electrolytic abnormalities (hypokalemia, 
hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia) was listed under 4.8. in the SmPC.  
In addition, a warning for cardiac, renal, nervous system disorders and infectious diseases is included 
in the updated SmPC. The Applicant provided analysis of the pooled safety data, including line-listing 
of safety data from studies indicating severity of AEs, as well as post-marketing safety data, including 
EudraVigilance line-listing. Tachycardia was added to the SmPC section 4.8.  
There was no systematic reporting of clinical laboratory parameters available from this overview. Some 
biochemistry parameters were mentioned with respect to liver toxicity.   
Neutropenic enterocolitis is now included in the SmPC (see section 4.8) as it can occur as therapy-
related adverse event upon treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. 
Safety data in elderly patients were reported in at least one study (Martin et al, 2015). Elderly patients 
may have more comorbidities potentially affecting the frequency of AEs and therefore increased risk to 
certain ADRs cannot be excluded for elderly patients. Furthermore, elderly patients may have reduced 
renal clearance requiring close monitoring as already stated in the SmPC. A further warning into the 
SmPC that patients with higher disease status and comorbidities have a higher risk for adverse events 
(see section 4.2. and 4.4).    
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Paediatric patients were represented in a few published studies, although not clinically relevant to this 
application, since carmustine is not intended for use in this population and in fact it is contra-indicated 
in children (see SmPC section 4.3).  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The type of ADRs reported in the published trials assessed in this application are generally in line with 
what is known from the safety profile of carmustine in the approved indications.  The PI was updated 
with the addition of neutropenic enterocolitis and tachycardia. Pulmonary toxicity is a known 
complication from conditioning regimen including carmustine with a major impact on 
morbidity/mortality. Some publications revealed an elevated risk to develop pulmonary toxicities in 
females. This is also addressed in the updated SmPC.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 6.3 of the SmPC have been 
updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to neutropenic enterocolitis has been added to the 
product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and 
do not require user consultation with target patient groups.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This application concerns the use of carmustine Obvius as part of a conditioning treatment prior to 
autologous haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in malignant haematological diseases 
(Hodgkin’s disease / Non-hodgkin’s lymphoma). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Several treatment options are authorised in the EU for patients undergoing HSCT. These included 
radiation treatment or intensive treatment with cancer medicines such as busulfan to clear the bone 
marrow of existing cells in preparation for HSCT. The choice of conditioning regimen varies and is 
typically based on institutional experience. The most frequently used intensive chemotherapy cited in 
the literature is a combination of carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan (BEAM) (Damaj et 
al, 2017). BEAM regimen is considered the regimen of choice for patients with HL and NHL submitted 
to ASCT, due to its acceptable safety profile and a quite high antitumor efficacy.   
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The Applicant identified 9 main studies for BCNU in conditioning regimens prior to autologous HCT. All 
the main studies represent retrospective analyses comparing different conditioning regimes, especially 
comparing BEAM to other regimes where BCNU is substituted. The retrospective analyses in total 
included 8,402 patients. Main and supportive studies included in total a 14,024 patients - 8,402 in 
main studies; 5,622 in supportive studies) and of these 9,951 patients in total - 5,775 in main studies 
and 4,176 in supportive studies have been treated with BCNU as part of the conditioning regimen prior 
to AHCT for HL, NHL and AML.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The efficacy endpoints used to evaluate efficacy of conditioning treatment prior allogenic HPCT were 
disease control (relapse rate); disease free-survival (DFS)/ event-free survival (EFS)), the 
transplantation-related mortality (TRM)/ non-relapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS).In 
adults with malignant diseases use of carmustine based conditioning regiments provided OS similar or 
comparable to that of a thiotepa containing regimen. The submitted evidence support the use of 
carmustine in the new indication.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There is limited number of randomized well-controlled up-to-date studies of carmustine use in 
conditioning regimen prior HPTC. Considerable amount of efficacy data are retrospective and 
uncontrolled studies. The size of the effect on OS is difficult to evaluate due to lack of randomized 
controlled clinical trials. Majority of studies are either retrospective or prospective, uncontrolled real-
life studies. Although these studies reflect clinical practice, there are many factors related to patient 
and disease characteristics as well as physician choice which can influence the treatment decision.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Treatment-related  mortality  (TRM)  remains  a  matter  of  concern  and  acute  toxicities,  although  well 
known, are not always easily managed.  
Pulmonary toxicity is a known complication from conditioning regimen including carmustine with a 
major impact on morbidity/mortality. Especially high dose regimens with carmustine pose further risks 
regarding pulmonary toxicity. An increased risk for pulmonary toxicities upon treatment with 
conditioning regimes and HPCT for females has been reported. So far, this increased risk is described 
for the treatment itself including conditioning regimes without carmustine (e.g. TBI or busulfan-
cyclophosphamide) or with carmustine (BEAM: carmustine, etopside, cytarabine and melphalan or 
CBV: cyclophosphamide, carmustine and etoposide).   
Upon high-dose therapy with carmustine, the risk and severity for infections, cardiac, hepatic, 
gastrointestinal, and renal toxicity, diseases of the nervous system and electrolyte abnormalities 
(hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia) rises. Patients with comorbidities and worse 
disease status have a higher risk for adverse events. This needs to be considered on individual case 
basis especially for elderly patients. 
As part of this assessment “tachycardia” was included in section 4.8.  
Carmustine is carcinogenic in rats and mice at doses less than the recommended human dose based 
on body surface area. Secondary primary malignancies such as MDS have been reported in patients.  
Neutropenic enterocolitis can occur as therapy-related adverse event upon treatment with 
chemotherapeutic agents. This finding has been added under section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
This medicinal product contains 0.57 vol% ethanol (alcohol), it can be harmful in patients suffering 
from alcoholism and for high-risk groups such as patients with liver disease or epilepsy (see SmPC 
section 4.4). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Pulmonary toxicity is a known complication from conditioning regimen including carmustine with a major 
impact  on  morbidity/mortality.  Some  publications  revealed  an  elevated  risk  to  develop  pulmonary 
toxicities in females, reasons for this elevated risk have not been established. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The main studies identified as relevant to the indication represent retrospective analyses comparing 
different conditioning regimes, especially comparing BEAM to other regimes where BCNU is 
substituted. The retrospective analyses in total included 8,402 patients and could be considered as 
supportive. These analyses demonstrated that carmustine as part of the BEAM regimen is an 
established, widely used and effective conditioning regimen prior to AHCT in HL and NHL. 
Pulmonary toxicity is a known complication from a conditioning regimen including carmustine with a 
major impact on morbidity and is also seen in the submitted publications; an elevated risk to develop 
pulmonary toxicities was observed in females and is addressed in the updated SmPC. Upon high-dose 
therapy with carmustine, the risk and severity for infections, cardiac, hepatic, gastrointestinal, and 
renal toxicity, diseases of the nervous system and electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/332634/2020 
Page 106/108 
 
 
  
  
hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia) rises. Patients with comorbidities and worse disease status 
have a higher risk for adverse events (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The well-established use of carmustine as conditioning treatment prior to autologous haematopoietic 
progenitor cell transplantation in NHL and HL has been adequately documented. It can be concluded 
that the benefits outweigh the risks. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The submitted published scientific literature primarily pertains to the use of carmustine in the 
autologous stem cell transplantation procedure in patients with Non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma. 
The evidence provided by Applicant regarding use of carmustine with TBI and in the scope of allogenic 
hematopoietic cell transplantation is limited. 
The initially proposed indication included all malignant and non-malignant haematological diseases in 
adult patients, however this broad indication was not justified on the basis of submitted literature.  
No data were provided on the use of carmustine as a part of conditioning regimens in patients with 
severe aplastic anaemia, where allogeneic HSCT is the only available potential curative treatment, 
thalassaemia, sickle-cell disease, primary immunodeficiency. In fact, there is no data on use of 
carmustine as a part of conditioning regimens in patients with any non-malignant haemothological 
disease. 
Bibliographic evidence was considered sufficient only for Hodgkin’s disease, Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
and the indication was restricted accordingly to the use of carmustine as conditioning treatment prior 
to autologous haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in malignant haematological 
diseases (Hodgkin´s disease / Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma). 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Carmustine Obvius is positive.

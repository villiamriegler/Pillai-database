2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown aetiology characterized by 
fibrosis of the lung interstitium, decrease in lung volume, and progressive pulmonary insufficiency 
typically leading to death (Lynch and Toews 1998). 
IPF is recognized by the American Thoracic Society (ATS), European Respiratory Society (ERS), 
Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS), and the Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) as a distinct 
form of interstitial lung disease (ILD), defined by a constellation of clinical, histopathologic, and 
radiologic features (Raghu et al. 2018, Raghu et al. 2011, and ATS/ERS 2002) and is also categorized 
Assessment report  
EMA/117564/2023 
Page 5/90 
 
 
 
as the most common histopathologic form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (Katzenstein and Myers 
1998). 
The claimed therapeutic indication is “Esbriet is indicated in adults for the treatment of idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).” 
Epidemiology 
The incidence and prevalence of IPF varies across studies, depending on the case definition and the 
population studied. The annual incidence of IPF has been estimated as 6.8 to 17.4 per 100,000 in the 
United States and 0.22 to 7.4 per 100,000 in the European Union. Prevalence estimates range from 
14.0 to 63.0 per 100,000 in the United States and from 1.25 to 23.4 per 100,000 in the European 
Union (Raghu et al. 2006; Fernández Pérez et al. 2010; Nalysnyk et al. 2012). IPF is most prevalent in 
middle-aged and elderly patients, and most studies have found a higher frequency in men than in 
women (Nalysnyk et al. 2012). Symptoms have usually been present for at least 6 months before the 
diagnosis is made. 
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
IPF is believed to result from a series of microinjuries to the alveolar epithelium, triggering release of 
profibrotic mediators. The characteristic pathologic finding on biopsy of lung tissue is a pattern of usual 
interstitial pneumonia (UIP), with subepithelial fibroblastic foci throughout the lung. Inflammation, 
although it may initially be present, is not typically a prominent histopathologic finding. Rather, an 
unremitting fibrotic response relocates from the alveolar space to the interstitium, with fibroblast and 
myofibroblast proliferation, organization into fibroblastic foci, and excessive collagen deposition and 
accumulation (du Bois et al. 2010). Although the majority of patients have a history of cigarette 
smoking, the aetiology of IPF remains unknown. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The initial clinical presentation of IPF is typically that of slowly progressive dyspnea and non-productive 
cough. Digital clubbing occurs in up to 50% of patients. Lung auscultation reveals fine end inspiratory 
crackles, initially at the base of the lung and ultimately diffusely (Raghu et al. 2011). In advanced 
disease, features of right heart failure develop. 
Pulmonary function tests demonstrate a restrictive pattern, with a decrease in carbon monoxide 
diffusing capacity (DLco), and oxygen desaturation on exertion. Chest radiographs show diffuse 
interstitial opacities with volume loss, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans show a 
characteristic pattern of peripheral (subpleural), bibasilar, reticulonodular abnormalities associated 
with architectural 
distortion, honeycomb changes, and traction bronchiectasis (Raghu et al. 2011). 
IPF, untreated, is a rapidly progressive disease with an extremely poor prognosis. The clinical course is 
challenging to predict. For some patients, the course of disease is rapid, with fatal respiratory failure 
evolving over a few months (Selman et al. 2007). 
Other patients have a gradual progression over years, followed by acute exacerbations associated with 
abrupt and often fatal hypoxemic respiratory failure (Collard et al. 2007). 
Spontaneous remissions do not occur with IPF, and 10-year survival is less than 15% (Lynch and 
Belperio 2012). Clinically, IPF usually presents insidiously, with the gradual onset of a non-productive 
Assessment report

cough and dyspnea. Dyspnea is usually the most prominent and disabling symptom and is progressive 
in nature (ATS/ERS 2000). Pulmonary hypertension (PH) develops in many patients with IPF (the 
reported prevalence ranges between 30% and 81%), and presence of PH is associated with increased 
mortality (Corte et al. 2009). 
Formal classification of IPF severity does not currently exist. In 2011, the first evidence based 
clinical guidelines were established to help clinicians diagnose and manage IPF (Raghu et al. 2011).  
Despite updates to the therapeutic and diagnostic guidelines for IPF (Raghu et al 2015, Raghu et al. 
2018), there continues to be no formal guidance on disease staging. Likely, a major factor in the lack 
of definitive staging criteria is the fact that IPF progression is not always linear and patients may have 
long periods of stable disease followed by rapid decline. 
Despite this, it is generally accepted that forced vital capacity (FVC) and DLco are significant predictors 
of mortality in IPF. In contrast, HRCT pattern of UIP (probable vs. definite) is not (Hyldgaard 2020, 
Raghu et al. 2017, Yamauchi 2016). One proposed staging method, GAP (gender, age, physiology) 
staging (Ley et al. 2012), incorporates the use of FVC and DLco, in addition to gender and age, into its 
prediction of mortality risk. GAP stage I reflects the lowest risk of 1 and 3-year mortality whereas 
Stage III is the highest risk. However, GAP staging fails to predict functional changes over the next 
year (Ley et al. 2016). 
The official classification of disease severity in Japan uses the J system and has been discussed 
recently and evaluated against a revised J system as well as the GAP system (Kondoh et al. 2017). The 
revised J system and GAP system have been found to be valuable tools to predict mortality and 
manage IPF. However, the J system has not been used in any pivotal trials for IPF elsewhere and is 
only used in clinical practice in Japan. 
While there is no standardized definition for mild, moderate, and severe disease, clinical studies have 
used an FVC threshold of 50%–55% predicted and a DLco threshold of 35%–40% predicted to 
separate mild-to-moderate patients from those with severe disease (Richeldi et al. 2011, Noble et al. 
2011, King et al. 2011, IPFCRN 2012).  
Due to its relentlessly progressive nature and poor prognosis, the term “mild-to-moderate” IPF 
potentially misrepresents the seriousness of IPF, as it only refers to the functional status of a patient at 
the moment of evaluation (e.g., FVC or DLco values), but any patient with even very limited functional 
impairment (“mild” IPF) at diagnosis will progress to worse functional impairment and ultimately 
respiratory failure and death. 
Management 
Currently, two antifibrotic drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been shown to slow IPF progression 
(Oldham & Collard 2017) which led to their regulatory approvals across major geographies for the 
treatment of IPF. Pirfenidone was approved in the European Union (EU) in 2011, followed by 
nintedanib four years later in 2015. Both drugs were approved in the United Stated (US) in 2014. In 
contrast to the US and many other countries, the use of pirfenidone in the EU is limited to treatment of 
mild to moderate IPF only. With this submission, the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) seeks to 
extend the EU indication for pirfenidone to include patients with advanced IPF. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
The currently approved indication in the EU is: Esbriet is indicated in adults for the treatment of 
mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
Assessment report  
EMA/117564/2023 
Page 7/90 
 
 
 
The mechanism of action of pirfenidone has not been fully established. However, existing data suggest 
that pirfenidone exerts both antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in a variety of in vitro 
systems and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis (bleomycin- and transplant-induced fibrosis). IPF is a 
chronic fibrotic and inflammatory pulmonary disease affected by the synthesis and release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β) 
and pirfenidone has been shown to reduce the accumulation of inflammatory cells in response to 
various stimuli. Pirfenidone attenuates fibroblast proliferation, production of fibrosis-associated 
proteins and cytokines, and the increased biosynthesis and accumulation of extracellular matrix in 
response to cytokine growth factors such as, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and platelet-
derived growth factor (PDGF). 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Esbriet is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF), as follows: “Esbriet is indicated in adults for the treatment of mild to moderate idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).” 
With this variation, the applicant proposes to include treatment of ‘advanced’ idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF) by the deletion of the current qualifier ‘mild to moderate’, based on the results from 
Study MA29957 as follows: 
“Esbriet is indicated in adults for the treatment of mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
(IPF).” 
Utilising the data from the original pivotal trials investigating Esbriet as a treatment for IPF, as well as 
from study MA29957, a recently completed Phase 2 study in patients with advanced IPF, the Sponsor 
has performed retrospective analyses to compare the efficacy and safety profile of Esbriet in patients 
with mild to moderate IPF versus patients with advanced IPF. Data from the following studies has been 
used: 
• 
PIPF-004, PIPF-006 and PIPF-012 supported the original Marketing Authorisation (MA) for 
Esbriet on 28 February 2011 (EU/1/11/667/001-003 - EMEA/H/C/2154). PIPF-016 supported a 
subsequent variation to the Esbriet MA (EMEA/H/C/2154/II/0021). PIPF-025 was the post-
authorisation safety study performed to assess long-term safety of pirfenidone in a real-world 
setting.  
•  MA29957, a recently completed phase IIb study of pirfenidone plus sildenafil performed in 
patients with advanced IPF and at risk of group 3 pulmonary hypertension.  
The MAH did not seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The pharmacologically active ingredient Pirfenidone (RO0220912-000) was assessed for its potential 
environmental risk arising from the extended medical use to the entire IPF population, following the 
2006 EMA Guideline (corr. 2, 2015) for the Environmental Risk Assessment of Human Non-GMO 
Pharmaceuticals.

Pirfenidone is considered not to be PBT, nor vPvB.  
A risk to the STP, surface water, groundwater, sediment and terrestrial compartment is not anticipated 
based on the prescribed use of pirfenidone. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of Pirfenidone. Considering the above data, Pirfenidone is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
No further new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
For the assessment of efficacy of pirfenidone in patients with advanced IPF, the main analysis 
population was derived from the pooled Phase III Studies PIPF-004/-006, and PIPF-016. These studies 
supported the original Marketing Authorization for pirfenidone (EMEA/H/C/2154) and a subsequent 
type II variation (EMEA/H/C/002154/II/0021), respectively. The post-hoc analyses based on the data 
form these studies were conducted to stratify patients into those with advanced or non-advanced IPF 
based on their FVC and/or DLco values at baseline. While there is currently no official definition of 
advanced disease, the cutoffs of FVC <50% and DLco<35% are generally accepted criteria in current 
clinical studies of IPF. 
Moreover, the results from the open-label extension study, PIPF-012, show that the effectiveness of 
pirfenidone over long-term use is similar in advanced and non-advanced IPF patients. 
More recently, during 2020, the Sponsor completed the primary analysis of Study MA29957. MA29957 
is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
sildenafil added to pirfenidone in patients with advanced IPF and at risk of Group 3 PH. Data from the 
control arm of the study, pirfenidone added to placebo, is presented in this SCE to support conclusions 
from the analysis of advanced IPF patients in the aforementioned pooled Phase III studies. 
Studies Included in Submission 
This submission is based on the following studies:  
1.  For the analysis of efficacy on FVC and all-cause mortality, the pooled Phase III studies (PIPF-
004/006/016) are used to compare the effect of pirfenidone vs placebo in the subgroups of 
advanced (N=170) and non-advanced patients (N=1077). 
2.  This is complemented by the analysis of the annual rate of decline in FVC in mL of advanced 
(N=187) compared to non-advanced (N=409) patients from Study PIPF-012. 
3.  Finally, an indirect comparison is made with the annual rate of decline observed in Study 
MA29957.  
The all-cause mortality rate in PIPF-012 is also reported in both subgroups, as well as for MA29957. 
However, as there was no placebo control group in either Study PIPF-012 or Study MA29957, no 
statistical testing has been applied. 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose response studies were provided.  The dose for patients with advanced lung function 
impairment is the same as for patients with less advanced disease.

Methods 
Study PIPF-004 
This study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm study in patients with idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis. Patients were randomised 2:2:1 to receive pirfenidone 2403mg/d, placebo, or 
pirfenidone 1197mg/d, respectively. They were to remain in blinded study treatment from 
randomisation until approximately 72 weeks after the last patient had been randomised. The study 
included a wash-out period (for patients to discontinue all prohibited medication before screening), a 
screening period, a study treatment period and a final follow-up visit. All patients were required to 
have a final follow-up visit 3 to 4 weeks after the treatment completion visit. A Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) was chartered to review unblended safety and efficacy data at regular intervals 
during the trial and to evaluate the conduct and integrity of the study. 
PIPF-006 
This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with IPF. Patients 
were randomized 1:1 to receive pirfenidone 2403 mg/d or placebo and were to remain on blinded 
study treatment from randomization until approximately 72 weeks after the last patient had been 
randomized in the study. The primary efficacy parameter was the absolute change in percent predicted 
forced vital capacity (FVC) from Baseline to Week 72.  
The study included a Washout Period (for patients to discontinue all prohibited medications before 
screening), a Screening Period, a Study Treatment Period, and a Final Follow-up Visit. All patients were 
required to have a Final Follow-up Visit 3 to 4 weeks after the Treatment Completion Visit. A Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) was chartered to review unblinded safety and efficacy data at regular

PIPF-0016 
Study PIPF-016 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with IPF. Approximately 500 patients were to be 
randomized with equal probability to pirfenidone or placebo, and patients were treated for 52 weeks. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline to Week 52 in percent predicted FVC. 
There were four study periods: a Washout Period (required only if patients were on a prohibited 
medication), a Screening Period, a Study Treatment Period, and a Post-treatment Follow-up Visit. 
Eligible patients were randomized on Day 1 to pirfenidone 2403 mg or matching placebo. Over the first 
14 days, the dose was escalated from 1 capsule (267 mg) three times daily (TID) to the full 
maintenance dose of 3 capsules TID, as tolerated.

Post-Hoc Statistical Analysis of Efficacy in Advanced and Non-Advanced IPF from Pooled 
Pivotal Studies 
Patient Selection 
In this post-hoc analysis of the pooled data from studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006, and PIPF-016, the intent 
was to compare patients who had advanced IPF (defined as FVC [percent predicted] <50% and/or 
DLco <35%) at baseline to patients with non-advanced IPF (defined as defined as FVC ≥50% and DLco 
≥35%) at baseline. These criteria are different from those used to screen patients at the time the 
Assessment report  
EMA/117564/2023 
Page 16/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Phase III studies were conducted (PIPF-016 [FVC ≥50% and DLco ≥30% at screening; King et al. 
2014] and 
PIPF-004 and -006 [FVC ≥50% at screening and Day 1 and DLco ≥35% at screening; Noble et al. 
2011). Although the original inclusion criteria would suggest that patients with more advanced lung 
function impairment were not eligible for inclusion in these studies, this was not the case for several 
reasons: 
• 
• 
There were differences in eligibility criteria between the studies, and some inclusion criteria 
were assessed only at screening. 
There were differences between the definition of baseline used to determine eligibility and that 
used for statistical analysis purposes. 
The application of the post-hoc analysis selection criteria led to the identification of some patients who 
had changes in FVC or DLco values between screening (used for enrollment eligibility) and 
randomization (≥8 weeks following screening) with an increase in their lung function impairment by 
the start of dosing.  
Specifically, for PIPF-016, patients could be included in this analysis if they had DLco ≥30% and <35% 
at screening, or if they experienced a decline in FVC to <50% between screening and baseline (while 
FVC was assessed again at baseline, these values were not used to determine eligibility).

Table 2 Lung Function Entry Criteria for PIPF-016 Compared with PIPF-004 and PIPF-006 
Treatments 
The maintenance daily dose of Esbriet was three 267 mg capsules three times a day with food for a 
total of 2403 mg/day. In study PIPF-004 an additional dose was tested (1197 mg/day) but this dose 
was not included in the post-hoc analysis. 
Objectives 
Efficacy assessments conducted during each of the pivotal studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006, PIPF-016 have 
been previously described in the original Marketing Application (EMEA/H/C/2154) and subsequent Type 
II variation (EMEA/H/C/2154/II/0021) and are summarized in Table 3 below.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The analysis presented in this SCE focuses on change in FVC volume from baseline to Week 52 of 
treatment as well as the difference in the risk of all-cause death at 52 weeks. 
The assessment at 52 weeks was chosen as it was the duration of treatment in Study PIPF-016 for 
which data were available to be pooled with studies PIPF-004 and PIPF-006. While the pivotal studies 
included several additional endpoints, change in FVC volume was chosen for evaluation here because 
the annual rate of decline of FVC has become the most widely accepted endpoint in studies on IPF and 
other interstitial 
lung diseases (ILDs) and also facilitates descriptive comparisons with other studies. Moreover, it was 
the measure with the most data available for pooling across the three studies.

Sample size 
This is a post-Hoc Statistical Analysis of Efficacy in Advanced and Non-Advanced IPF from Pooled 
Pivotal Studies. The sample sizes of Studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006 and PIPF-0016 are described in the 
EPAR on the initial MA and variation EMEA/H/C/2154/II/0021. 
Randomisation 
Studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006 and PIPF-0016 were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 
3 Studies. PIPF-004, PIPF-006 supported the original Marketing Authorisation (MA) for Esbriet on 28 
February. PIPF-016 supported a subsequent variation to the Esbriet MA (EMEA/H/C/2154/II/0021).

Statistical methods 
FVC volume data up to 52 weeks of treatment for patients in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day and placebo 
cohorts from the three Phase III studies were pooled. Linear slope analysis of change from baseline to 
Week 52 in FVC volume was performed using a mixed model. Slopes were calculated based on 
observed data only and used actual observation times. 
Time-to-event outcomes were compared between pirfenidone and placebo using the log-rank test. A 
proportional hazards model, with treatment as a fixed effect, was used to estimate the hazard ratio 
(HR) and 95% CI. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to display event times and the numbers of patients 
at risk. Patients without an event were censored at or prior to 52 weeks, as appropriate for each 
outcome and 52-week completion status. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The three pivotal Phase III studies (PIPF-004, PIPF-006, and PIPF-016) recruited 1334 patients, of 
whom 623 were treated with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day and 624 received placebo; all 1247 patients 
were included in the analysis of efficacy in advanced/non-advanced IPF patients. The remaining 87 
patients received pirfenidone at a dose of 1197 mg/day in PIPF-004 and were not included in the 
pooled analysis of pirfenidone in advanced/non-advanced patients. Among the 1247 patients analyzed, 
1077 patients were categorized as having non-advanced IPF (FVC ≥50% and DLco ≥35%) and 170 
patients had advanced IPF (FVC <50% or DLco <35%).

Conduct of the study 
This is a post-Hoc Statistical Analysis of Efficacy in Advanced and Non-Advanced IPF from Pooled 
Pivotal Studies. The conduct of these studies had been assessed in above mentioned procedures. 
Baseline data 
Demography and Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Patient demographics in the non-advanced and advanced IPF groups were consistent across the 
respective subgroups for pirfenidone versus placebo treatment.  
Within the different disease severity groups, baseline FVC or DLco values were fairly well balanced 
between the pirfenidone and placebo subgroups. The differences in baseline demographics between 
the severity groups are consistent with the selection criteria and natural history of IPF. It should be 
noted that the main driver of classifying patients as advanced was a DLco value <35% rather than an 
FVC value below 50% which is reflected in the median FVC values of pirfenidone (59.2%) and placebo 
(64.2%).

Numbers analysed 
Among the 1247 patients analyzed, 1077 patients were categorized as having non-advanced IPF (FVC 
≥50% and DLco ≥35%) and 170 patients had advanced IPF (FVC <50% or DLco <35%). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Change in Forced Vital Capacity Volume at 52 Weeks 
In the pooled Phase III studies, the absolute and relative treatment differences between pirfenidone 
and placebo are not different in a clinically meaningful way between advanced and non-advanced 
patients, the absolute treatment difference being significant in both cases. 
In the linear slope analysis between pirfenidone and placebo subgroups among advanced patients, 
annual FVC decline was significantly lower with pirfenidone versus placebo (150.9 mL vs 277.6 mL; 
Assessment report  
EMA/117564/2023 
Page 22/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
p=0.0035). Among patients with non-advanced IPF, annual FVC decline was also significantly lower 
with pirfenidone versus placebo (128.7 mL vs. 216.7 mL; p=0.0001).  
Table 6 FVC Volume (mL) Change with Linear Slope Through Month 12 of Study Treatment (Pooled 
Studies PIPF-004/-006/-016) 
All-Cause Mortality 
The all-cause mortality rate is lower among patients treated with pirfenidone versus placebo both in 
patients with advanced and non-advanced IPF. Consistent with the natural history of IPF, the mortality 
rate in advanced patients is higher than in nonadvanced patients. 
From the analysis of patients from the pooled Phase III studies, the percentage of patients with 
advanced IPF who died from any cause was 4.4% (4/90) in the pirfenidone subgroup compared with 
15.0% (12/80) with placebo over 52 weeks of treatment. In time-to-event analyses, advanced IPF 
patients treated with pirfenidone had a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality over 52 weeks 
versus placebo (HR: 0.28; 95% CI 0.09–0.88; p = 0.0194). 
The percentage of patients with non-advanced IPF who died from any cause was 3.4% (18/533) in the 
pirfenidone subgroup compared with 5.5% (30/544) with placebo over 52 weeks of treatment . In 
time-to-event analyses, non-advanced patients treated with pirfenidone did not have a significantly 
lower risk of all-cause mortality over 52 weeks versus placebo (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.34–1.09; 
p=0.090)

Study PIPF-012 
An Open-Label Extension Study of the Long Term Safety of Pirfenidone in Patients with 
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)

Methods 
Study PIPF-012 was Phase IIIb, multicenter, long-term, open-label, safety study in patients with IPF 
who completed one of the previous Phase III studies (PIPF-004, PIPF-006, or PIPF-016). In addition, 
lung function was assessed for approximately the first 3 years (FVC and DLco). There was no criterion 
on IPF severity for enrolment into the study. Patients from Studies PIPF-004/ and PIPF-006 were 
enrolled under either the original protocol (all patients except those in the United Kingdom [UK]) or UK 
Amendment 1, while patients from Study PIPF-016 were enrolled later under Global Amendment 2 
which expanded the studies from which patients could enroll into PIPF-012. Global Amendment 2 was 
implemented after approximately 3 years of pulmonary function data had been collected in the study 
and further efficacy assessments were considered of limited utility. Thus, pulmonary function testing 
was eliminated with this amendment. 
All patients in PIPF-012 received open-label pirfenidone with the target maintenance dose being 2403 
mg/day. Patients discontinued blinded treatment at the end of Studies PIPF-004/006 3 weeks prior 
to starting treatment in PIPF-012, while patients from Study PIPF-016 started treatment in PIPF-012 
immediately upon discontinuing blinded treatment in PIPF-016. To maximize tolerability, the dose of 
pirfenidone in Study PIPF-012 was escalated over 15 days to the target maintenance dose of 
2403 mg/day (801 mg, three times daily [TID]), as tolerated. A patient on a lower maintenance dose 
at the end of Studies PIPF-004/PIPF-006 was limited to a lower dose in Study PIPF-012 until his or her 
treatment assignment in PIPF-004/-006 was unblinded; thereafter, at the discretion of the investigator 
and with the medical monitor’s concurrence, the patient’s dose could be escalated to 2403 mg/day, as 
tolerated. 
Treatments 
The target maintenance dose in this study was 2403 mg/day – the same as used in pivotal studies.   
Objectives and Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective (With Global Amendment 2) was to obtain additional safety data for pirfenidone 
2403 mg/day in patients with IPF who complete a qualifying trial of pirfenidone. 
Post-Hoc Statistical Analysis of Efficacy in Patients with Advanced or non-Advanced IPF 
Patient Selection 
All patients with baseline FVC and/or DLco values at the time of enrollment into PIPF-012 were 
included in the analysis. Patients enrolling from PIPF-016 were excluded from the analysis due to the 
fact that no pulmonary function data were collected from these patients at the time of enrolling into 
PIPF-012 due to Global Amendment 2. 
Patients with missing FVC and missing DLco were excluded from analysis as those patients could not 
be categorized as having advanced or non-advanced IPF. 
Efficacy Assessments 
Efficacy endpoints evaluated in Study PIPF-012 (up to the point of Global Amendment 2) were: 
• 
• 
Percent predicted FVC 
Percent predicted DLco (hemoglobin corrected) 
•  Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival time, relative to first dose in Study PIPF-012 
•  Kaplan-Meier estimate of lung-transplant−free survival time, relative to first dose in Study 
PIPF-012

Endpoints Analysed and Methodology 
Efficacy of pirfenidone by IPF severity was assessed in this post-hoc analysis by decline in FVC volume 
over 180 weeks, as measured using change from baseline and linear slope analysis of annual rate of 
decline. A yearly decline was estimated using a single arm repeated measures model for each 
subgroup of advanced and non-advanced patients. 
Results 
Patient Disposition 
A total of 609 patients were enrolled into study PIPF-012, of which 596 treated patients (187 patients 
with advanced IPF and 409 patients with non-advanced IPF) had FVC or DLco data available at 
baseline for inclusion in the post-hoc analysis of efficacy by IPF severity (non-advanced vs. advanced) 
(Table 9 below) Patients from the PIPF-016 study were not included in the analysis due to a lack of 
available FVC follow-up data due to implementation of Global Amendment 2. 
Table 9 Patients Included in Post-Hoc Analysis of Study PIPF-012 
Demography and Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Demographics were similar between non-advanced and advanced IPF patients in enrolled into PIPF-
012. The majority of patients in both groups were ≥65 years (67.5% and 67.4%, in non-advanced and 
advanced patients, respectively) with the median age in both groups being 69 years. Patients were 
mostly male, irrespective of having non-advanced (70.7%) or advanced IPF (74.9%) and the median 
time from IPF diagnosis to start of treatment in PIPF-012 was similar in non-advanced and advanced 
patients (2.5 and 2.7 years, respectively). 
At baseline, the mean (SD) percent predicted FVC was 76.1% (15.25) in the non-advanced group and 
59.8% (14.05) in the advanced IPF group. Mean percent predicted DLco was 47.0% (10.34) and 
29.2% (6.05), respectively.

596 patients (187 patients with advanced IPF and 409 patients with non-advanced IPF) had FVC or 
DLco data available at baseline and therefore they were included in the post-hoc analysis of efficacy by 
IPF severity. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Change in Forced Vital Capacity Volume from Baseline 
The annual rate of FVC decline was similar with longer-term pirfenidone treatment in patients with 
advanced and non-advanced IPF. 
Among advanced patients treated with pirfenidone during follow-up, the annual rate of FVC decline 
(slope) was -141.5 mL/year and that for non-advanced patients was -153.5 mL/year.

Table 11 FVC Decline During Follow-up Treatment in PIPF-012 
All-Cause Mortality 
Among patients treated in Study PIPF-012, the all-cause mortality rate over 180 weeks was lower 
among patients with non-advanced IPF (49/409; 12.0%) compared to patients with advanced IPF 
(52/187; 27.8%) which is consistent with the natural history of IPF. 
Study MA29957 
The trial title: 
Phase IIb, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Sildenafil Added to Pirfenidone in Patients with 
Advanced 
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and Risk of Group 3 Pulmonary Hypertension. 
Methods 
MA29957 was a Phase IIb, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international 
study of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of combination treatment of pirfenidone with added 
sildenafil in patients with advanced IPF and at risk of Group 3 PH who had been on pirfenidone 
treatment in a dose range of 1602-2403 mg/day for ≥12 weeks with demonstrated tolerability. Eligible 
patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 year (52 weeks) of treatment with either 
oral sildenafil (20 mg) or matching placebo TID while they continued to take pirfenidone.  
Treatment with sildenafil was initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of 
PAH. The randomized patients were stratified according to availability of a previous right heart 
catheterization (RHC) for inclusion (yes or no) and degree of pulmonary function, which was measured 
with the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/FVC ratio being below or above 0.8. 
The patients were provided pirfenidone for the study by the Sponsor and were instructed on proper 
use. Patients were instructed to stop taking their commercial pirfenidone and start taking the study-
provided pirfenidone. 
The study consisted of 5 phases: 
•  Run-in period of 12 weeks (if needed) 
•  Screening period 
•  28-day washout period (if needed);  
•  Double-blind treatment period (52 weeks) 
Assessment report  
EMA/117564/2023 
Page 31/90 
 
 
 
 
• 
Follow-up period (4 weeks) 
Additionally, there was the possibility for patients to continue to receive pirfenidone within the study 
protocol after the follow-up visit at Week 56 during a safety follow up period. 
After patients completed a washout period, patients entered a screening period, which lasted for up to 
28 days; during screening, patients were evaluated for eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. A run-in period was provided for countries where patients were not able to take pirfenidone for 
12 weeks due to reimbursement issues. 
At the start of screening, patients were on oral pirfenidone taken TID for at least 12 weeks, and the 
dose was in the range of 1602-2403 mg/day for ≥4 weeks prior to the first screening visit. It was 
expected that the dose would remain within the range of 1602-2403 mg/day throughout the study and 
in accordance with the product label.  
In addition, in the 4 weeks before the first screening visit, patients should have not experienced either 
a new or ongoing adverse event (AE) of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03 that was Grade 2 or higher and considered by the 
investigator to be related to pirfenidone, or had an interruption of pirfenidone treatment f,or >7 days 
for any reason. During screening, patients could return for the baseline visit (Day 1) as soon as 
eligibility was confirmed. 
Patients who experienced an event that was part of the composite primary endpoint (other than all-
cause mortality) continued treatment and were encouraged to complete the study. 
The primary analysis for the study was conducted when all patients completed the 52-week treatment 
phase and the mandatory 4-week follow-up visit.

pirfenidone, or an interruption in pirfenidone treatment for >7 days for any reason. It was 
expected that the dose of pirfenidone would be in the range of 1602–2403 mg/day throughout 
the study (in countries where patients were not able to take pirfenidone for 12 weeks due to 
reimbursement issues, this 12-week run-in supply was provided by the Sponsor) 
•  Had World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class II or III disease (Rubin 2004) at 
screening 
•  Had 6MWD of 100–450 m at screening 
Treatments 
At the start of screening, patients were on oral pirfenidone taken TID for at least 12 weeks, and the 
dose was in the range of 1602–2403 mg/day for ≥4 weeks prior to the first screening visit. It was 
expected that the dose would remain within the range of 1602–2403 mg/day throughout the study and 
in accordance with the product label. 
Objectives and Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy objective was evaluated using a composite endpoint based on a comparison of the 
proportion of patients who showed disease progression over 52 weeks of treatment, as evidenced by 
reaching the combined endpoint of relevant decline in 6MWD of ≥15% from baseline, respiratory-
related non-elective hospitalization, or all-cause mortality. 
The secondary objective was evaluated as the individual components of the primary endpoint as well 
as other assessments.

Of 247 screened patients, 70 patients were screen failures. The reasons for screen failures included 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (59 patients [62.8%]) and other (11 patients [11.7%]). A total of 88 
patients in the pirfenidone with added sildenafil group and 89 patients in the pirfenidone with added 
placebo group were randomly assigned to receive study treatment during double-blind period. All 
patients received study treatment in both groups. Therefore, the safety population included all 177 
randomized patients. 
During the study, one patient in the pirfenidone with added sildenafil group was unblinded after 
completing 52 weeks of double-blind treatment. The unblinding occurred during the additional safety 
follow-up period and, thus, the patient was not excluded from the analysis. 
A total of 51 patients (58.0%) in the pirfenidone with added sildenafil group and 37 patients (41.6%) 
in the pirfenidone with added placebo group completed the double blind treatment period of the study.  
Baseline data 
Demography and Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics for the study population are representative of the advanced 
IPF population and were generally well balanced between the pirfenidone with added sildenafil and 
pirfenidone with added placebo groups, with few exceptions. 
The median age of patients was similar between the two groups (pirfenidone with added sildenafil was 
70.0 years and pirfenidone with added placebo was 69.0 years). The majority of patients was male, 
White, and not Hispanic or Latino. 
The median body-mass index (BMI) value and NT-proBNP level at baseline were 27.1 kg/m2 and 125.5 
pg/mL in the pirfenidone with added sildenafil group and 27.2 kg/m2 and 161.0 pg/mL in the 
pirfenidone with added placebo group, respectively. Most of the females were postmenopausal.

A total of 177 patients (88 patients in the pirfenidone+sildenafil group and 89 patients in the 
pirfenidone+placebo group) were randomly assigned to receive treatment. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
This study has shown that adding sildenafil to pirfenidone was not associated with any meaningful 
reduction of the risk to experience a composite primary endpoint event nor on any of its components 
(relevant decline in 6MWD of ≥15% from baseline, respiratory related non-elective hospitalization, or 
all-cause mortality). The result of the primary endpoint was similar across pre-specified patient 
subgroups. 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint showed that the risk difference for pirfenidone+sildenafil 
vs. pirfenidone+placebo was 3.06% (95% CI: -11.30, 17.97; p = 0.6527), demonstrating that addition 
of sildenafil to pirfenidone was not associated with a meaningful reduction of the risk to experience a 
disease progression event. 
For PFS, the median time to event occurrence was similar between treatment groups (26.00 weeks vs. 
25.43 weeks), with an HR (95% CI) of 0.95 (0.67, 1.34; p = 0.7568). 
The median time to occurrence of multiple events was 7 weeks longer in the pirfenidone+sildenafil 
group (20.57 weeks) than in the pirfenidone+placebo group (13.29 weeks), and the HR (95% CI) to 
experience multiple disease progression events was 0.89 (0.68, 1.15; p = 0.3760). 
The proportion of patients with relevant 6MWT declines ≥15% from baseline was similar between 
treatment groups (53.4% in the pirfenidone+sildenafil group and 50.6% in the pirfenidone+placebo 
group) with risk difference (95% CI) of 2.85 (-12.13, 17.84; p = 0.7046). 
Median time from randomization to first occurrence of relevant declines ≥15% in 6MWD (m) was 
similar between treatment groups (39.0 weeks in the pirfenidone+sildenafil group and 38.71 weeks in 
the pirfenidone+placebo group), with an HR (95% CI) of 0.94 (0.62, 1.41; p = 0.7550).

Change in FVC Volume at Week 52 (Pirfenidone + Placebo) 
The annual rate of FVC decline from baseline to Week 52 among patients in the pirfenidone with added 
placebo group was -93 mL (SE: 46.4). 
All-Cause Mortality (Pirfenidone + Placebo) 
During the double-blind treatment period, 18/89 (20.2%) patients in the pirfenidone with added 
placebo group had died from all causes. The median time to occurrence of event was not calculable (as 
the median time was not reached). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Esbriet is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF), as follows: “Esbriet is indicated in adults for the treatment of mild to moderate idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).” 
This variation proposes to add advanced stages of the disease to the indication to allow treatment in all 
adult patients with IPF. The proposed indication is Esbriet is indicated in adults for the treatment of 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).”

No new pivotal data were provided with this application. 
Utilising the data from the original pivotal trials investigating Esbriet as a treatment for IPF, as well as 
from study MA29957, a recently completed Phase 2 study in patients with advanced IPF, the applicant 
has performed retrospective post-hoc analyses to compare the efficacy and safety profile of Esbriet 
in patients with mild to moderate IPF versus patients with more advanced IPF. Data from the following 
studies has been used for the assessment of the efficacy in patients with advanced IPF:

PIPF-012 study  
•  MA29957 study 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Analysis of pooled phase III studies (PIPF-004/006/016) 
Studies PIPF-004 and PIPF-006 were submitted in 2010 with the original MAA. The PIPF-0016 study 
was submitted in 2014 with the variation application supporting an update to section 5.1.  
PIPF-004 and PIPF-006 compared treatment with Esbriet 2403 mg/day to placebo. The studies were 
nearly identical in design, with few exceptions including an intermediate dose group (1197 mg/day) in 
PIPF-004. In both studies, treatment was administered three times daily for a minimum of 72 weeks. 
The primary endpoint in both studies was the change from Baseline to Week 72 in percent predicted 
Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). 
The design of PIPF-0016 study was similar to that of the previous pivotal studies, with the only 
significant differences being the study length (52 vs 72 weeks) and an update of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria to bring them into line with the more recent diagnostic standards. 
It is noted that pivotal studies submitted at the stage of the original MAA only enrolled subjects with 
FVC >50% (% predicted) at screening and a Day 1 and DLCO >35% (% predicted) at screening. In 
relation to FVC the same criteria for enrolment were used also in study PIPF-0016, i.e. patients had to 
have FVC >50% (% predicted) at screening. In relation to DLCO, the inclusion criteria were slightly 
different, i.e. PIPF-0016 study could enrol patients with slightly lower DLCO value, i.e. DLCO>30%. 
For the purpose of this submission, advanced IPF was defined by the applicant as patients with an FVC 
<50% predicted and/or DLCO <35% predicted at baseline, which can be accepted. 
It is noted that the majority of patients in the post-hoc analysis of pivotal studies who were included in 
advanced IPF group come from PIPF-0016 study (74% of patients) and only 25% from PIPF-004/006 
studies. This is due to the fact that PIPF-016 study enrolled patients with DLco ≥30% and therefore 
patients could be included in the advanced IPF group of this post hoc analysis if they had DLco ≥30% 
and <35% at baseline, or if they experienced a decline in FVC to <50% between screening and 
randomization.  
Although the original lung function entry criteria of PIPF-004/006 studies suggest that patients with 
more advanced lung function impairment were not eligible, some patients could have changes in DLco 
values between screening and randomization (≤8 weeks following screening) with an increase in their 
lung function impairment by the start of dosing.  
In the PIPF-004/006/016 studies a number of endpoints were investigated however the post-hoc 
analysis presented by the applicant focuses on two outcome measures, i.e. change in FVC volume from 
baseline to Week 52 of treatment as well as the difference in the risk of all-cause death at 52 weeks.

1247 patients were included in the post hoc analysis of PIPF-004/006/016 studies. 1077 patients were 
categorized as having non-advanced IPF (FVC ≥50% and DLco ≥35%) and 170 patients as having 
advanced IPF (FVC <50% or DLco <35%). The mean age of the analyzed subjects was 67-68. The 
majority of patients were male (more than 73 % in any treatment group) and elderly (i.e. ≥65 years 
of age). It needs to be highlighted that patients included in the post-hoc analysis of PIPF-004/006/016 
studies represent only a small subset of patients with advanced IPF; the minimal FVC (% Predicted) of 
included patients was 48% and minimal DLCO (% Predicted) of included patients was 27%. The 
applicant was requested to  discuss and justify if the subgroup of patients included in this post hoc 
analysis could be considered as a sufficient representation of patients with advanced IPF and whether 
the results could be extrapolated to a broader population of patients with advanced IPF.   
The applicant clarified that the results of studies PIPF-012 and MA29957 inclusion criteria that allowed 
for a more severe population and can be considered supportive for the extrapolation to the broader 
population of advanced IPF. In Study PIPF-012, in the patients with advanced IPF 50% had a DLco at 
baseline below 30.7% and 25% a DLco at baseline below 25.2%, thereby representing a much more 
IPF-advanced population than the one included in the pooled Phase 3 cohort. In Study MA29957 
advanced IPF patients were also at risk of group 3 pulmonary hypertension, representing other 
patients with advanced IPF. Additionally provided results for quartile 1, median and quartile 3 for FVC 
form baseline until 52 weeks, did not indicate that the beneficial effect of pirfenidone is less in the 
more affected population. With all the data provided, it is sufficiently supported that the results of the 
affected patients with advanced IPF investigated in studies provided by the applicant  can be 
extrapolated to all advanced IPF patients.  
Based on the results of the post-hoc analysis of PIPF-004/006/016 studies the applicant concluded that 
a similar treatment effect of pirfenidone was observed in patients with advanced as compared to 
patients with non-advanced IPF. The annual FVC decline was lower in the pirfenidone treated patients 
as compared patients on placebo regardless of the disease status.  Among patients with advanced IPF, 
the annual FVC decline was significantly lower with pirfenidone versus placebo (150.9 mL vs 277.6 mL; 
nominal p=0.0035). Among patients with non-advanced IPF, annual FVC decline was also significantly 
lower with pirfenidone versus placebo (128.7 mL vs. 216.7 mL; nominal p=0.0001). The additional 
provided results of ppFVC  support the findings of FVC volume. They show that the decline in ppFVC is 
somewhat greater in the advanced patient group, but the difference between the non-advanced and 
advanced patient group is even greater for the placebo. Furthermore, the similar lower rate of FVC 
decline compared to placebo already suggests similar protection against clinically and prognostically 
relevant respiratory deterioration. In both the non-advanced and advanced patient group  pirfenidone 
lowered the proportion of patients with a decline of ≥ 10 absolute percentage points or death 
compared to their respective placebo group. 
In relation to all-cause mortality assessment among patients with advanced IPF, less patients died in 
the pirfenidone group as compared to the placebo group. The percentage of patients with advanced IPF 
who died from any cause was 4.4% (4/90) in the pirfenidone subgroup compared with 15.0% (12/80) 
with placebo over 52 weeks of treatment (annual mortality rate).  
All-Cause Mortality (ACM) 
The Applicant considered the reduction of mortality the ultimate goal of treatment in IPF. A significant 
reduction in all-cause mortality was found in the pooled Phase III studies of pirfenidone (King et al 
20141, Nathan et al 20172). Although all-cause mortality may indeed allow for the assessment of

benefit in survival, it is a composite endpoint that does not differentiate between death from 
progression/complications of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and eventually death of TEAEs. To 
understand the meaning of the difference in ACM, additional treatment-emergent all-cause mortality, 
treatment-emergent IPF-related mortality and IPF-related mortality outcomes would inform about the 
different aspects. However, the numbers are too low for a further meaningful exploration.  
Considering the choice of the endpoint, it cannot fully excluded that the post-hoc decisions for the 
endpoints were influenced by the results of the analyses of the initial submissions. While the presented 
endpoints as such could be acceptable endpoints, no other endpoints are analysed, because of issues 
around missing data in certain data constellations, according to the Applicant. However, missing data 
might (according to reasons for missing data) indicate that there was no positive effect. Therefore, 
analysis of these endpoints with imputation based on the reasons for missing data can be informative. 
Alternatively, if results of these endpoints used in the studies, especially the placebo-controlled main 
studies, would support the outcome of the primary analyses, the totality of post-hoc data would be 
strengthened and less prone to selection bias. After imputing the missing outcomes apart from death 
by an average of the three most similar patients based on previous visits, the results of the 6MWT 
confirm the observation made for FVC that there is a treatment effect of pirfenidone in both non-
advanced and advanced patient compared to respective placebo groups. For 6 UCSD SOBQ score, 
there was a consistent effect of pirfenidone in reducing the worsening of dyspnoea in both populations 
compared to the greater deterioration in the placebo group. Therefore, these endpoints support the 
results of the primary endpoints. 
Statistical analysis 
The SAP acknowledged that analyses are post-hoc and no confirmatory testing was performed (p-
values are descriptive). The analysis presented in this SCE focuses on change in FVC volume from 
baseline to Week 52 of treatment as well as the difference in the risk of all-cause death at 52 weeks. 
No order of importance was placed on the endpoints (e.g. primary, secondary). 
FVC volume data up to 52 weeks of treatment for patients in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day and placebo 
cohorts from the three Phase III studies were pooled. Linear slope analysis of change from baseline to 
Week 52 in FVC volume was performed using a mixed model. Slopes were calculated based on 
observed data only and used actual observation times. 
Time-to-event outcomes were compared between pirfenidone and placebo using the log-rank test. A 
proportional hazards model, with treatment as a fixed effect, was used to estimate the hazard ratio 
(HR) and 95% CI. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to display event times and the numbers of patients 
at risk. Patients without an event were censored at or prior to 52 weeks, as appropriate for each 
outcome and 52-week completion status 
Post-hoc analyses are by definition not prespecified, hence type I error control is not possible. 
However,  the endpoints accounting for death as a negative outcome (imputation for death in FVC as 
FVC=0; considering death as failure for the clinical responder; imputing for death in UCSD as 
UCSD=120) showed all positive effects for pirfenidone in all studies in both advanced (albeit with more 
variation across studies) and non-advanced population. These endpoints are considered of more 
clinical importance than those where data are considered missing after the patient died (hypothetical 
estimand: the effect as if patient would not have died). So the lack of type I error is mitigated by the 
replication of a positive effect in clinically relevant outcomes, and hence the risk of a chance finding is 
considered acceptably low.

PIPF-012 study 
The additional data supporting this variation come from Study PIPF-012 which was a single-arm, Phase 
IIIb, multicenter, long-term, open-label, safety study in patients with IPF who completed one of the 
previous Phase III studies (PIPF-004, PIPF-006, or PIPF-016). There was no criterion on IPF severity 
for enrollment into this extension study. It is noted that after implementation for the Amendment 2 
pulmonary function tests were no longer collected in this study and therefore these results are not 
available for all patients. The target maintenance dose in this study was 2403 mg/day – the same as 
used in pivotal studies.   
The applicant presented the results of decline in FVC volume over 180 weeks in the subgroup of 
patients with advanced and non-advanced diseases. Information on survival was also provided.  
A total of 609 patients were enrolled into study PIPF-012, of which 596 treated patients (187 patients 
with advanced IPF and 409 patients with non-advanced IPF) had baseline FVC and/or DLco values at 
the time of enrollment into PIPF-012and were eligible for inclusion in the post-hoc analysis of efficacy 
by IPF severity (non-advanced vs. advanced). Patients from the PIPF-016 study were not included in 
the analysis due to a lack of available FVC follow-up data due to implementation of Global Amendment 
2. Similar as in pivotal studies the majority of patients were over 65 and male. The median age in both 
groups was 69 years of age. In relation to patients with advanced IPF the mean percent predicted FVC 
was 59.8% (range 22- 125) and the mean percent of DLCO was 29.2% (range 13-45) at baseline. It is 
noted that the duration of treatment was significantly shorter in patients with advanced IPF as 
compare to those with non-advanced IPF, i.e. the mean duration of treatment 28.2 months in the 
advanced IPF group and 41.4 months in the non-advanced IPF group. The applicant stated that reason 
for this is a higher rate of mortality among advanced IPF patients.  
The results of the post-hoc analysis of Study PIPF-012 study indicated that the annual rate of FVC 
decline (slope) in pirfenidone treated patients in the advanced IPF group was similar to the decline in 
the non-advanced group (-141.5 mL/year and -153.5 mL/year, respectively). However, all-cause 
mortality rate over 180 weeks was lower among patients with non-advanced IPF (49/409; 12.0%) 
compared to patients with advanced IPF (52/187; 27.8%).  
In both groups mortality was much higher than in the pivotal trials. Mortality was higher in the 
advanced group due to the natural history of IPF, compared to the non-advanced group, and in both 
groups higher in the second and third year than in the first year. This is not unexpected as the result 
of the ongoing progression, pirfenidone at its best can only slow down progression.  
MA29957 study 
Further data supporting the proposed changes to the indication come from MA29957 study which was 
a Phase IIb, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled of the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of combination treatment of pirfenidone with added sildenafil in patients with advanced 
IPF and at risk of Group 3 PH who had been on pirfenidone treatment in a dose range of 1602-2403 
mg/day for ≥12 weeks with demonstrated tolerability. In this study eligible patients were randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 year (52 weeks) of treatment with either oral sildenafil (20 mg) or 
matching placebo TID while they continued to take pirfenidone.  
This study was focusing on the effect of sildenafil on pulmonary hypertension (group 3 i.e. secondary 
to pulmonary disease) as the primary and secondary endpoints investigated in the study were typical 
for studies investigating treatments for pulmonary hypertension. The primary endpoint of this study 
was the combined endpoint of relevant decline in 6MWD of ≥15% from baseline, respiratory-related 
non-elective hospitalization, or all-cause mortality. There were a number of secondary endpoints in this 
study including the assessment of individual components of the primary endpoint. Changes from

baseline in pulmonary function tests (PFT) results such changes in DLco (% predicted), changes in FVC 
(% predicted) and changes in FVC in ml were investigated as a secondary endpoint which was not 
included in the multiplicity control strategy. 
Although the MAH acknowledged that study MA29957 was not designed to demonstrate a benefit of 
pirfenidone monotherapy in adult patients with advanced IPF, in support of this application the 
applicant is presenting the results of annual rate of decline in FVC volume in the comparator arm (i.e 
pirfenidone plus placebo arm). The results of the pirfenidone plus sildenafil arm was not considered to 
be relevant for this variation by the applicant and therefore these results were not discussed in detail 
in this report. 
89 out of 177 patients randomised into the MA29957 study were included in the pirfenidone plus 
placebo arm. The median age of patients was 70.0 years in the pirfenidone plus sildenafil group and 69 
in the pirfenidone plus placebo group. The majority of patients were male, White, and not Hispanic or 
Latino.  
The primary endpoint of this study was the combined endpoint of relevant decline in 6MWD of ≥15% 
from baseline, respiratory-related non-elective hospitalization, or all-cause mortality.  
The primary endpoint of this study was not met although as stated by the applicant these results are 
not relevant for this submission.  
In study MA29957, 89 patients treated with Esbriet monotherapy had a similar decline in FVC as 
Esbriet-treated patients in the post-hoc analysis of the pooled phase 3 trials PIPF-004, PIPF-006, and 
PIPF-016. The annual rate of FVC decline from baseline to Week 52 among patients in the pirfenidone 
with added placebo group was -93 mL (SE: 46.4).  
A total of 37 patients (41.6%) completed the double-blind treatment period. This was generally 
comparable with the pirfenidone+ sildenafil group. 
However, discontinuation is much higher than in the pivotal studies PIPF-004 and PIPF-006, in which 
discontinuation was 4.6% and 19.9%, respectively. Main reasons for early discontinuation were the 
occurrence of adverse events (32.6%), death (14.6%), and withdrawal of consent (5.6%). Patients 
with advanced IPF and risk of PH have a higher a priori risk of death i.e. 25% of the discontinuations. 
These  differences can be mostly explained by the difference in severity of the underlying disease, i.e., 
a higher  disease burden in patients with advanced IPF at risk of grade 3 PH.   
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The post-hoc analyses of patients with more advanced functional impairment from the pooled Phase III 
studies, the post-hoc analyses from patients with advanced disease from the open-label PIPF-012 
study, and the changes in functional parameters observed in MA29957 (patients with advanced IPF 
and Group 3 PH) are generally consistent across the different data sources and suggest a therapeutic 
benefit of pirfenidone in patients with advanced IPF is comparable to that observed in patients with 
mild to moderate IPF. The annual FVC decline was lower in the pirfenidone treated patients as 
compared patients on placebo regardless of the disease status.   
The decline in FVC observed over time in MA29957 (~100 mL) was lower than the average annual rate 
of decline of approximately 200 mL seen in untreated patients in the previous Phase III studies. This is 
consistent with the slowing of IPF. 
progression in patients with advanced IPF treated with pirfenidone in the pooled Phase III studies.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The clinical safety profile of pirfenidone in advanced IPF patients described in this SCS is primarily 
based on pooled safety data concerning treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) from: 
1.  the control arm in the Phase IIb Study MA29957 (also called SP-IPF), a multicenter, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week, international study of the efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of combination treatment with sildenafil and pirfenidone in patients with 
advanced IPF and at risk of Group 3 pulmonary hypertension (PH), who had been on 
pirfenidone treatment taken three times daily (TID) for ≥12 weeks, in a dose range of 1602-
2403 mg/day, for at least 4 weeks prior to the first screening visit. 
2.  the pivotal Phase III Studies (PIPF-004, PIPF-006 and PIPF-0016) in patients with advanced 
and non-advanced IPF. PIPF-004 and PIPF-006 supported the original EU Marketing 
Authorization Application (MAA) received for Esbriet (pirfenidone) on 28 February 2011 
(EU/1/11/667/001-003 - EMEA/H/C/2154). PIPF-0016 was submitted on 3 July 2014 as part of 
a Type II variation to support labelling amendments (EMEA/H/C/2154/II/0021). 
3.  the long-term safety Study PIPF-012  of pirfenidone. PIPF-012 was the open-label, extension 
study for patients completing PIPF-004, PIPF-006, and PIPF-0016. PIPF-012 also supported the 
original EU Marketing Authorization for Esbriet (pirfenidone) in 2011 and the Type II variation 
EMEA/H/C/2154/II/0021. 
4.  In addition, ancillary safety information from Study WB29908 (PIPF-025, PASSPORT), a post-
authorization safety study (PASS) of Esbriet evaluating long-term safety of Esbriet in a real-
world setting, is also provided. This study was conducted at the request of the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and was a follow-up measure to the EU marketing 
authorization received for Esbriet in 2011.Study WB29908 collected data from patients across 
the spectrum of IPF disease severity, including patients with advanced IPF. Regular reports for 
Study WB29908 were submitted to EMA with annual Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 
submissions. The first interim report was included with PSUR #3 (EMEA/H/C/002154/ 
PSU/005; 22 October 2012). The eighth and final report was included with PSUR #7 
(PSUSA/00002435/201702; 28 April 2017). 
Pooling 
Data from Study MA29957, in patients with advanced IPF treated with pirfenidone, were integrated 
with data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of pirfenidone in IPF (PIPF-004, PIPF-
006, and PIPF-016), and with long-term, follow-up Study PIPF-012. The pivotal Phase III trials (PIPF-
004, PIPF-006, and PIPF-016) enrolled pirfenidone treatment-naïve patients with advanced and non-
advanced IPF. 
Study PIPF-012 enrolled both pirfenidone treatment-naïve and pre-treated patients with advanced and 
non-advanced IPF. Study MA29957 only enrolled pirfenidone pre-treated patients with advanced IPF. 
In order to control for potential confounders caused by prior exposure to pirfenidone, the analysis of 
these studies is based on safety data pooled separately for pirfenidone treatment-naïve patients and 
pre-treated patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/117564/2023 
Page 46/90 
 
 
 
This allows also to explain the differences between the safety profile of pre-treated and  treatment-
naïve patients observed in previous studies (e.g., PIPF-012), where some common events (e.g., 
nausea) were observed at a higher frequency in treatment-naïve patients. 
Figure 2 below shows how the patient populations have been pooled. Of note, patients who were 
treated with 1197 mg/d in PIPF-004 and enrolled in PIPF-012, are considered pre-treated for this 
analysis.  
Figure 2 Pooling Strategy Scheme 
The safety data of pooled naïve patients and pooled pre-treated patients were then compared between 
patients with advanced and non-advanced IPF, where advanced IPF is defined as below: 
1.  In Studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006, and PIPF-016 only patients with forced vital capacity less than 
50% (FVC<50%) and/or carbon monoxide diffusing capacity at screening less than 35% 
(DLco<35%) predicted value were enrolled 
All patients enrolled in Study MA29957 had advanced IPF and were at risk for group 3 PH. For 
MA29957, advanced IPF was defined as measurable carbon monoxide diffusing capacity at screening of 
less than or equal to 40% (DLco≤40%) predicted value  
Study WB29908 (PIPF-025, PASSPORT) was not included in the integrated pooled population as this 
study reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) while the pivotal trials and Study MA29957 reported 
adverse events (AEs). The outcomes for patients with advanced IPF enrolled in Study WB29908 have 
instead been discussed separately. 
The studies in the pooled analysis were conducted over a period of more than 10 years, and were 
conducted for different periods of follow-up and duration. As such, direct comparison of frequency of 
AEs between studies would be inappropriate. 
For this analysis, exposure-adjusted data have instead been used to account for the differences in 
study duration and follow-up. 
In Studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006, PIPF-016 and PIPF-012, MedDRA version 11.0 was used, whereas in 
Study MA29957, MedDRA version 23.0 was used. The Sponsor acknowledges that different MedDRA 
versions were used in the different studies. 
Table 16 below presents the number of pirfenidone treatment-naïve and pre-treated patients from 
each study contributing to the comparison of the safety profile between advanced IPF disease and non-
advanced IPF disease.

Exposure to Study Treatment 
Of the pirfenidone treatment-naïve patients from the pooled population, the median treatment 
duration was roughly 4 months longer in patients with non-advanced IPF than patients with advanced 
IPF (16.4 months and 12.2 months respectively). 
Pirfenidone pre-treated patients from the pooled population remained on treatment longer than their 
treatment-naïve counterparts, which is likely due to the design of Study PIPF-012 where patients 
remained on pirfenidone for up to 80 months, much longer than any of the other studies reported 
here. For pre-treated patients with non-advanced IPF, median treatment duration was more than  
25 months longer than pre-treated patients with advanced IPF (41.7 months and 16 months 
respectively.

Overall, similar rates of TEAEs per 100 PY were observed in treatment-naïve patients from the pooled 
population with advanced IPF compared to treatment-naïve patients with non-advanced IPF (816.7 and 
868.5 respectively;) 
When analyzing TEAEs by SOC, two SOCs showed a higher TEAE rate (defined as ≥10/100 PYs) in 
advanced patients: respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; and cardiac disorders.  
The exposure-adjusted TEAE rate is similar between advanced and non-advanced patients across all 
remaining SOCs.

within the SOC: Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders 
The exposure-adjusted event rate difference between advanced and non-advanced treatment-naïve 
patients from the pooled population observed in the SOC respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders was primarily driven by the PT idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, along with other events (e.g., 
dyspnoea, PH, hypoxia) that are commonly associated with an aggravation of the patient’s underlying 
condition. For all 
reports of IPF, the investigator’s verbatim terms were reviewed and in all cases referred to IPF 
progression, IPF exacerbation, IPF aggravation, worsening or end stage IPF.

Adverse Events in Treatment-Naïve Patients from the Pooled Population by Preferred Term

The exposure-adjusted event rate difference between advanced and non-advanced treatment-naïve 
patients observed in the SOC cardiac disorders is mainly driven by the PT atrial fibrillation and 
tachycardia  
Out of 15 events of atrial fibrillation, 7 events were serious (6 events were assessed as not-related to 
pirfenidone and 1 event was assessed as related to pirfenidone by the investigator) and none had a 
fatal outcome. Atrial arrhythmias are the most commonly seen arrhythmias in patients with IPF. 
Supraventricular tachycardia and multifocal atrial tachycardia are known to be cardiac manifestations 
of IPF.

Overall, similar AE rates per 100 PY were observed between advanced and nonadvanced Patients.

The exposure-adjusted event rate difference between pre-treated patients with advanced IPF and non-
advanced IPF observed in SOC respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders is primarily driven by the 
PT IPF along with other events associated with an aggravation of the patient’s underlying condition.

Adverse Events in Pre-Treated Patients from the Pooled Population by Preferred Term 
within the SOC: Infections and Infestations 
The exposure-adjusted event rate difference between advanced and non-advanced  pre-treated 
patients observed in SOC infections and infestations is mainly due to the PT representing respiratory 
tract infections (i.e., lower respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, 
respiratory tract infection, and pneumonia;), and thus might be attributed to the higher severity of the 
underlying disease (Odashima et al. 2020; Mostafaei et al. 2021). 
All eight events of orchitis occurred in a single patient; they were all non-serious and were assessed as 
not-related to study treatment by the investigator.

Common adverse events 
Common Adverse Events in Treatment-Naïve Patients with Advanced IPF 
Among pirfenidone-naïve patients, all PTs that had a rate difference greater than 5 when comparing 
the rates in patients in with advanced IPF compared to non-advanced IPF; can all be attributed to the 
higher severity of the advanced underlying disease (i.e., IPF, bronchitis, dyspnoea, pneumonia, 
pulmonary hypertension, weight decreased, decreased appetite, oedema peripheral, and hypoxia)

Common Adverse Events in Pre-Treated Patients with Advanced IPF 
Most of the common TEAEs observed in pre-treated patients with advanced IPF  occurred at a rate 
similar to what is observed in pre-treated patients with non-advanced IPF. The common TEAEs with a 
rate difference greater than 5 in pirfenidone pre-treated patients with advanced IPF compared to non-
advanced IPF (i.e., IPF, dyspnea, and lower respiratory tract infection) can all be attributed to the 
advanced nature of the underlying disease.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
DEATHS 
Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease that steadily worsens over time. The median survival of 
patients ranges from 2.5 years to 3.5 years. Accordingly, a higher rate of fatal TEAEs has been 
observed in both treatment-naïve and pre-treated patients with advanced IPF, as described in the 
following sections.

Deaths in Treatment-Naïve Patients from the Pooled Population 
The only AE leading to death with an exposure-adjusted rate >1/100 PYs higher in treatment-naïve 
patients with advanced IPF compared to treatment-naïve patients with non-advanced IPF was IPF. This 
is an expected finding taking into consideration the higher severity of the underlying IPF.

in advanced patients compared to non-advanced patients were IPF and cardiac arrest. 
Both of these TEAEs appear related to the higher severity of the underlying advanced IPF (Kreuter et al. 
2016). A deeper analysis showed that none of the 4 TEAEs of cardiac arrest were attributed as related 
to pirfenidone by the investigator.

Table 28 TEAEs Leading to Death More Frequently in Pre-Treated Patients with Advanced vs. Non-
Advanced IPF 
TEAEs leading to death observed only in Pre-Treated Patients with advanced IPF 
All the observed AEs appear related to the underlying advanced IPF and associated co-morbidities 
(Table 29; Kreuter et al. 2016). Only 3 AEs leading to death occurred in more than a single case. All 
of them (4 events of cardiac arrest, 3 events of dyspnea, and 3 events of cardio-respiratory arrest) 
were assessed as not-related to pirfenidone by the investigator.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
Serious Adverse Events in Treatment-Naïve Patients 
When analyzing STEAEs by SOC, there were 3 SOCs that showed a higher rate of serious TEAEs 
(defined as a difference >5/100 PY) in treatment-naïve patients with advanced IPF as compared to 
treatment-naïve patients with non-advanced IPF: respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; 
cardiac disorders; infections and infestations. The exposure-adjusted rate of STEAEs was similar for all 
remaining SOCs across treatment-naïve patients with advanced IPF and treatment-naïve patients with 
non-advanced IPF.

Serious TEAEs in Treatment-Naïve Patients within the SOC: Respiratory, Thoracic, and 
Mediastinal Disorders 
The higher rate of STEAEs observed in treatment-naïve patients with advanced IPF for the SOC 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders was primarily driven by the PTs IPF and hypoxia. 
This is an expected finding considering the higher severity of advanced IPF. 
Table 31 Exposure-Adjusted STEAE Rate within the SOC: Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal 
Disorders 
Serious TEAEs in Treatment-Naïve Patients within the SOC: Cardiac Disorders 
The higher rate of STEAEs in the SOC cardiac disorders observed in treatment-naïve patients with 
advanced IPF is mainly driven by the PTs atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, and angina 
pectoris.  
Cardiovascular disorders were the most frequent seen in a study with 272 patients investigating the 
impact of comorbidities in IPF.

Table 32 Exposure-Adjusted STEAE Rate within the SOC: Cardiac Disorders 
Serious TEAEs in Treatment-Naïve Patients within the SOC: Infections and Infestations 
The higher rate of STEAEs observed in naïve advanced IPF patients observed for the SOC infections 
and infestations is mainly due to PTs representing respiratory tract infections (i.e., pneumonia, 
bronchitis) and appears related to the higher severity of the underlying disease. 
Table 33 Exposure-Adjusted STEAE Rate within the SOC: Infections and Infestations 
Serious Adverse Events in Pre-Treated Patients 
When analyzing STEAEs by SOC, there were 2 SOCs that showed a higher rate of serious TEAEs 
(defined as a difference >5/100 PY) in pre-treated patients with advanced IPF as compared to pre-
treated patients with non-advanced IPF: respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; and infections 
and infestations. The exposure-adjusted rate of serious TEAEs was similar for all remaining SOCs 
across pre-treated patients with advanced IPF and pre-treated patients with non-advanced IPF.

Serious TEAEs in Pre-Treated Patients within the SOC: Respiratory, Thoracic, and 
Mediastinal Disorders 
The higher rate of STEAEs observed in pre-treated patients with advanced IPF for the SOC respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders was primarily driven by the PT IPF, along with other events 
associated with an aggravation of the patient’s underlying condition. 
Table 34 Exposure-Adjusted STEAE Rate within the SOC: Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal  
Serious TEAEs in Pre-Treated Patients within the SOC: Infections and Infestations 
The higher rate of STEAEs observed in advanced, pre-treated patients for the SOC infections and 
infestations is mainly resultant of PT representing respiratory tract infections (i.e., pneumonia and

bronchitis) which might be attributed to the higher severity of the underlying disease (Odashima et al. 
2020; Mostafaei et al. 2021).

SEVERE TEAES 
Severe TEAEs with Highest Exposure-Adjusted Rate in Treatment-Naïve Patients from the 
Pooled Population with IPF 
Severe TEAEs (i.e., TEAEs of Grade 3 and higher) with an exposure-adjusted rate >1/100 PYs higher in 
treatment-naïve patients with advanced IPF than in treatment-naïve patients with non-advanced IPF 
are shown in Table 36 below. All these events appear directly or indirectly related to the severity of 
the underlying advanced IPF. 
An example of AE indirectly related to the severity of the underlying disease is syncope, which is a 
symptom of several disorders likely to occur more frequently in patients with advanced IPF, e.g. PH 
and cardiac disorders (Galiè et al. 2015). Of the 10 severe syncope events, 9 were assessed as not-
related, and 1 as related by the Investigator.

Severe TEAEs with Higher Exposure-Adjusted Rate in Pre-Treated Patients with advanced IPF 
Severe TEAEs with an exposure-adjusted rate >1/100 PYs higher in pre-treated patients with advanced 
IPF than in pre-treated patients with non-advanced IPF are shown in Table 37 below. The majority of 
these TEAEs appear related to the severity of the underlying advanced IPF. The difference in the rate 
of pulmonary embolism between advanced and non-advanced patients is minimal. All 5 events of 
pulmonary embolism were assessed as not related by the Investigator and no fatal outcomes were 
reported.

TEAEs That Occurred Only in Patients with Advanced IPF Regardless of Prior Pirfenidone 
Treatment (≥3 events) 
None of the TEAEs occurring only in patients with advanced IPF were serious events. The 8 events of 
orchitis all occurred in the same patient, none were serious events, and all were assessed as not 
related to 
pirfenidone by the Investigator. The TEAE N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide increased 
may be explained by the higher severity of the underlying advanced IPF. 
Rash is a well-known ADR associated with pirfenidone; the 3 events of rash papulosquamous reported 
in patients with advanced IPF are a specific subtype of rash and appear to be a random finding, as rash 
follicular and rash pustular were reported only in patients with non-advanced IPF.

TEAES OF SPECIAL INTEREST 
TEAEs of Special Interest in Treatment-Naïve Patients 
In the pirfenidone treatment-naïve patients, the exposure-adjusted event rates of TEAEs, serious 
TEAEs, severe TEAEs, TEAEs leading to death and TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was 
higher in patients with advanced IPF than in patients with non-advanced IPF. 
The rates of gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, photosensitivity, rash, dizziness, and fatigue are similar 
across advanced and non-advanced patients. 
The rate of weight decreased was higher in advanced IPF patients than in non-advanced IPF patients. 
Weight decrease is a known ADR of pirfenidone, and could occur more frequently in advanced IPF 
patients due to additional factors such as prolonged physical inactivity (which leads to loss of muscle 
mass), or to loss of appetite due to worsening of the underlying disease or depression (Britze et. al. 
2017; Torrisi et al. 2018). 
TEAEs of Special Interest in Pre-Treated Patients 
The exposure-adjusted event rate of serious TEAEs, severe TEAEs, TEAEs leading to death and TEAEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation is higher in pre-treated patients with advanced IPF compared to 
non-advanced patients. These differences are driven by SOCs and are discussed in the previous 
sections. 
The rates of GI disorder, photosensitivity, rash, dizziness, weight decreased and fatigue are similar in 
patients with advanced and non-advanced IPF.

Laboratory findings 
The applicant clarified that an analysis of laboratory data were not provided because all laboratory 
abnormalities considered clinically significant by the investigators were collected as adverse events 
(AEs) and presented with the rest of the safety assessment in the submitted Summary of Clinical 
Safety. In addition, many years of post-marketing signal detection activities has not identified any 
evidence suggesting that patients with advanced IPF are more prone to laboratory abnormalities than 
patients with non-advanced IPF.  
Safety in special populations 
No new data was submitted. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new data was submitted. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

TEAEs leading to Withdrawal of Treatment in Pre-Treated Patients 
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is the only TEAE leading to discontinuation which shows a rate difference 
higher than 1 TEAE/100 PYs in pre-treated advanced IPF patients. This is clearly related to the higher 
severity of the advanced IPF.

Post marketing experience 
Esbriet capsules were first granted marketing approval in the EU on 28 February 2011, which marks 
the IBD.  Esbriet capsules were approved in the United States (U.S.) on 15 October 2014 and Esbriet 
film-coated tablets were approved on 11 January 2017.  Esbriet film-coated tablets were also 
approved in the EU (24 April 2017), Canada (2 June 2017), Australia (23 October 2017), and 
Switzerland (8 November 2017).  As of the DLP of this PBRER (27 February 2021), Esbriet capsules 
have been approved in 70 countries worldwide and Esbriet film-coated tablets have been approved in 
more than 50 countries worldwide. 
The cumulative worldwide exposure to pirfenidone is estimated at 254,983 patient-
equivalents and 175,311 patient-years. 
The last safety review for Esbreit was performed the 14th PSUR (data lock point 27 February 2021). In 
this PSUR the risk-benefit balance of medicinal products containing pirfenidone was considered to 
remain unchanged. 
Study WB29908, PIPF-025 
The trial title: post-authorisation safety study of Esbriet (pirfenidone): a prospective 
observational registry to evaluate long-term safety in a real-world setting (PASSPORT) 
Study design 
This product registry was a multicenter, long-term, prospective, observational study evaluating the 
long-term safety in patients who were prescribed Esbriet. Patients received Esbriet at the discretion of 
their physicians, and were followed through the registry for 2 years after they began treatment with 
Esbriet under real-world conditions. 
This registry complied with the requirement of a PASS, and as a post-authorization commitment, was 
approved by the CHMP. 
This registry was conducted in accordance with the protocol and all applicable laws and regulations, 
including Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practices, the ethical practices having their origination in the  
Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable national guidelines (ISPE 2007, Declaration of Helsinki 2008). 
This study was conducted and closely monitored by the MAH, or designee, with oversight by a project-
specific SAB.

Setting 
The registry’s planned enrollment was 1000 Esbriet-treated patients from approximately 100 
pulmonary clinics throughout selected EU Member States. Enrollment was completed with a total of 
1009 patients who received treatment with Esbriet. 
Treating physicians collected pre-specified data, specifically serious and non-serious adverse drug 
reactions of special interest (ADRSI) or of relevance to the investigators, at baseline and every 3 
months thereafter for the duration of the patients’ participation in study. Each patient was followed 
until discontinuation of the study or up to a maximum of 2 years. The MAH also closely monitored the 
retention of patients and undertook all reasonable efforts to minimize loss to follow-up for the entire 
duration of the registry. 
Patients 
In the European Union, Esbriet is indicated for the treatment of mild-to-moderate IPF in adults. 
Consequently, the protocol did not encourage the use of Esbriet for any other condition or for use in 
pediatric patients. However, if a physician in collaboration with the patient and/or legal representative 
made an independent clinical decision to prescribe Esbriet outside the terms of the SmPC and the 
patient met the other protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria, then the patient was permitted to be 
included in the registry. 
Variables 
The primary variables in this study were safety variables. Only adverse drug reactions (ADRs), both 
serious and non-serious, were collected in this study to enable evaluation of the long-term safety of 
Esbriet. An ADR was defined as a noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product related to 
any dose in which a causal relationship between the medicinal product and the adverse event (AE) was 
at least a reasonable possibility. 
Important potential and identified risks were monitored as adverse drug reactions of special interest 
(ADRSIs) while on this study. ‘Other ADRs’ were also collected at the discretion of the principle 
investigator. Corresponding serious ADRs of special interest (SADRSIs) and ‘other SADRs’ were also 
monitored 
The important identified risks were: 
1.  Photosensitivity reactions and skin rashes 
2.  Abnormal liver function tests 
3.  Dizziness 
4.  Weight loss 
5.  Gastrointestinal symptoms 
6.  Fatigue 
7.  Angioedema 
The important potential risks were: 
8.  Falls 
9.  Drug interactions (including smoking, Ciprofloxacin, Warfarin) 
10. Increased platelet counts 
11. Specific cardiac events (including supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, atrioventricular block and 
sick sinus syndrome, ventricular arrhythmia, bundle branch block, and aortic or pulmonic 
valvular incompetence) 
12. Blood dyscrasias (specifically agranulocytosis, leukopenia, and neutropenia) 
13. Severe skin reactions

PASSPORT pre-specified 12 patient subgroups with missing safety information, based on patient 
information obtained at the time of screening.  One of 12 pre-specified  patient subgroups was the use 
in patients with advanced stages of IPF (baseline FVC <50%). 
Results in patients with patients with advanced stages of IPF (baseline FVC <50%): 
144 patients were in advanced stages of IPF (baseline FVC <50%). 
ADRSIs: 91 patients had 213 events (serious and non-serious). Most of these events were in the 
special interest categories of GI symptoms, photosensitivity reactions and skin rashes, fatigue and 
weight loss. 
Other ADRs: 55 patients had 82 events, predominantly non-serious events already listed in the 
SmPC.  These events included decreased appetite and respiratory events associated with the 
underlying disease (dyspnoea and cough); 1 patient each had pulmonary embolism, IPF, productive 
cough and respiratory failure. 
SADRSI: 9 patients had 13 events; one patient had a report of blood dyscrasias (mentioned 
previously) and the remaining events were predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms. 
SADR: none 
Other SADRs: gastric ulcer, pneumonia, decreased appetite, IPF, pulmonary embolism, and 
respiratory failure 
Death: 1 patient died from pneumonia (already mentioned). 
The MAH concluded that no new signals were observed for patients with advanced stages of IPF and 
the observed events in this subgroup are consistent with the known profile of Esbriet or related to the 
underlying disease in the target elderly population with IPF. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data for pirfenidone when used in patients with advanced IPF come from studies PIPF-004, 
PIPF-006, PIPF-016, MA29957, PIPF-012 and PIPF-025. PIPF-004, PIPF-006 and PIPF-016 were 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, PIPF-012 was an open label extension study, PIPF-025 was a post-
authorization safety study performed in a real-world setting. Finally, MA29957 study was performed in 
patients with the risk of pulmonary hypertension.  
The safety data from 5 studies were pooled.  
The data from study MA29957, in patients with advanced IPF treated with pirfenidone, were integrated 
with data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of pirfenidone in IPF (PIPF-004, PIPF-
006, and PIPF-016), and with long-term, follow-up Study PIPF-012.The safety profile of pirfenidone 
when used in patients with advanced IPF disease was compared to patients  with non-advanced IPF 
disease. The safety data from 5 pooled studies were presented separately for pirfenidone treatment-
naïve and pre-treated patients.  
The studies in the pooled analysis were conducted over a period of more than 10 years, and were 
conducted for different periods of follow-up and duration. As such, direct comparison of frequency of 
AEs between studies was impossible therefore the exposure-adjusted data have  been used to account 
for the differences in study duration and follow-up. 
The Applicant provided the safety set for the treatment naïve and pre-treated population separately, 
based on the knowledge that gastro-intestinal events are more frequently observed in early stage of 
treatment, possibly leading to early drop out.

Pooling strategy  
The pooling of the studies PIPF004, PIPF006 and PIPF016 is justified as they were conducted in a 
comparable time frame and used the same in and exclusion criteria. These studies primarily included 
patients with mild to moderate diseases. 
Pooling of study MA29957 into this dataset was however considered to be problematic as this study 
included only pre-treated, advanced patients and it comprises a specific patient group at risk of 
pulmonary hypertension.  
In addition, in study MA29957, adverse events were encoded using MedDRA version 23 instead of 
MedDRA version 11 in the other studies. The applicant considers that evaluation according these 
different MedDRA versions will have minimal impact (if any) on relevant outcomes as the safety 
analyses is analysed at system organ class [SOC] level, followed by an investigation of preferred term 
[PT] reported with higher frequency in advanced IPF. Although some uncertainties regarding the 
comparability of the MedDRA versions remain, this explanation is accepted. 
Tolerability in the advanced population (advanced IPF patients on pirfenidone as compared 
to non-advanced IPF  patients on pirfenidone-data from studies of PIPF-004, PIPF-006, 
PIPF-016, MA29957 and PIPF-012) 
Duration of exposure 
In general, the median duration of treatment was longer for patients with non-advanced IPF as 
compared to those with advanced IPF. In the treatment-naïve group of patients the median duration of 
treatment in patients with advanced IPF was 12 months whereas in the pre – treated group of 
advanced IPF patients the median duration of treatment was 15.3 months (based on the data from 5 
pooled studies). 
In study PIPF-025 patients were followed through the registry for 2 years after they began treatment 
with Esbriet under real-world conditions. 
Summary of adverse events- exposure adjusted rate incidence.  
Generally, the advanced population showed a higher incidence of rated adjusted adverse events (AE., 
SAE, AE’s leading to discontinuation) in the summary of adverse events in both the treatment naïve 
and pre-treated population. This consideration applies to the summary of any-cause AEs, as well to the 
summary of the drug-related AEs. These differences between the advanced and non-advanced group 
are likely related to the severity of the disease rather than a difference in tolerance of pirfenidone as 
discussed below. 
Common adverse events 
Treatment-naïve patients 
Overall, similar rates of TEAEs per 100 PY were observed in treatment-naïve patients from the pooled 
population with advanced IPF compared to treatment-naïve patients with non-advanced IPF (816.7 and 
868.5 respectively;) 
When analyzing TEAEs by SOC, two SOCs showed a higher TEAE rate (defined as ≥10/100 PYs) in 
advanced patients: respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; and cardiac disorders. 
In relation to SOC respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders the difference between group was 
driven primary by PT idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, along with other events (e.g., dyspnea, PH, 
hypoxia) that are commonly associated with an aggravation of the patient’s underlying condition.  
Assessment report  
EMA/117564/2023 
Page 74/90 
 
 
 
 
In relation to cardiac disorders the following PTs were more frequently reported in patients with 
advanced IPF: atrial fibrillation and tachycardia.  Out of 15 events of atrial fibrillation, 7 events were 
serious (6 events were assessed as not-related to pirfenidone and 1 event was assessed as related to 
pirfenidone by the investigator. Although these differences  could be related to the severity of the 
disease the applicant was requested to discuss AEs within the SOC of cardiac disorders by comparing 
the frequency of these events in patients with advanced IPF receiving pirfenidone to those receiving 
placebo. The requested discussion was provided and it is discussed below.  
Pre-treated patients  
Overall, similar AE rates per 100 PY were observed between advanced and non-advanced patients in 
the pre-treated group (675.2 and 673.1, respectively). 
When analyzing TEAEs by SOC, 2 SOCs showed a higher TEAE rate (defined as >10/100 PYs) in 
advanced patients: respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; and infections and infestations.  
SOC respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders is primarily driven by the PT IPF along with other 
events associated with an aggravation of the patient’s underlying condition such as dyspnoea, 
respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension. In addition, lower respiratory tract infection, 
bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory tract infection, and pneumonia occurred with 
the higher rate in patients with advanced IPF in the pre-treated group. The applicant was requested to 
discuss AEs within the SOC infections and infestations by comparing the frequency of these events in 
patients with advanced IPF receiving pirfenidone to those receiving placebo and the outcome is 
discussed below.  
For the related TEAEs differences between advanced vs non-advanced patients were seen for 
treatment-naïve patients in SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, driven by IPF, PH and 
dyspnea, and Soc Metabolism and nutrition disorders, driven by PTs decreased appetite and anorexia.  
IPF, PH and dyspnea are typical events for IPF and indeed it can be assumed that they are more 
related the progression of severity of the disease rather than to the treatment.  
Decreased appetite and anorexia are well known ADRs of pirfenidone.  
Tolerability in the advanced population (advanced IPF  patients on pirfenidone as compared 
to advanced IPF patients on placebo- data from studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006 and PIPF-016) 
As the safety profile of pirfenidone in advanced IPF and non-advanced IPF is being compared, it cannot 
be fully distinguished whether the observed differences are attributable to the higher severity of the 
underlying disease (as it is claimed by the applicant) or if there are differences in safety profile of 
pirfenidone  when used in advanced IPF patients.  
Theoretically patients with more advanced IPF and therefore with a worse clinical status could be more 
prone to development of some AEs compared to mild or moderate IPF patients.  
Therefore, the applicant was requested to discuss the safety profile of pirfenidone in advanced IPF 
patients and present an additional analysis by comparing the frequency of AEs in patients with 
advanced IPF on pirfenidone to those on placebo (based on the data from studies PIPF-004, 
PIPF-006 and PIPF-016). The safety data from MA29957 study were not included in this  pooled 
analysis as characteristics of patients included in this study were different. 
The applicant provided the requested analysis:  
In six SOCs the TEAE frequency (defined as ≥5) was higher in the pirfenidone arm with advanced 
patients (≥ 5%) compared to placebo; nervous system disorders; gastrointestinal (GI) disorders; 
infections and infestations; skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders; cardiac disorders; metabolism and 
Assessment report  
EMA/117564/2023 
Page 75/90 
 
 
 
nutrition disorders. Of these, the SOCs cardiac disorder, metabolism and nutrition disorders were also 
higher when comparing the non-advanced with advanced population.  
When looking on PTs level the events that were higher in the advanced population treated with 
pirfenidone were already listed as very common or common ADRs in the current Esbriet SmPC  
PTs that were higher in the advanced population treated with pirfenidone compared to the advanced 
population treated with placebo and to the non-advanced population treated with pirfenidone and not 
listed in the SmPC are pneumonia and bronchitis.  
Pneumonia was higher in the advanced patients on  pirfenidone compared to those placebo as well as 
to non-advanced patients. As clarified  by the applicant, although the PT pneumonia was higher in the 
pifenidone arm, the PT lobar pneumonia, pneumonia mycoplasmal and tracheobronchitis was higher in 
the placebo arm, more or less balancing the difference in the PT pneumonia. The incidence in 
bronchitis was higher in the prifidone arm, but only one of these reports was serious and deemed 
related by the investigator. These observations are not considered to be reliable evidence for 
amending the Product information.  
In the SOC nervous system disorders, peripheral neuropathy was higher in the advanced population 
treated with pirfenidone. When compared to the non-advanced population, in the treatment naïve 
patient the incidence was higher as well (2.8 % and 0.8%, respectively), but in the pre- treated 
patients not (0% and 3.1%, respectively). These are only considered to be as a weak signal and 
therefore no amendments to the product information was considered necessary.  
In the SOC cardiac disorders, the higher frequency observed in the pirfenidone arm versus the placebo 
arm was driven by small differences across several PTs, with bradycardia being the only PT with a 
difference higher than 3%. None of the three reports of bradycardia was assessed as serious or related 
to pirfenidone by the investigator. Because the frequency is also higher in the advanced group than in 
the non-advanced population, there seems a higher risk for cardiac disorders. While a difference 
compared to non-advanced patients might be explained by a difference in severity of the disease, the 
difference with placebo could indicate a possible treatment related effect however due to a  small 
number of events no firm conclusion could be made in this regard. No amendments to the product 
information was considered necessary however as agreed with the applicant AEs within the  SOC 
Cardiac disorders in patients advanced IPF will continue to be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance 
and the data presented in the in PSURs.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
In studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006, PIPF-012, PIPF-016 and MA29957 80 deaths were reported in the 
pooled advanced IPF group and 85 deaths were reported in pooled non-advanced IPF group. In 
general, the Exposure adjusted rate for Adverse Events leading to death was higher in the advanced 
IPF group (6.47 /100 patient years in Treatment-Naïve Patients and 18.59/100 patient years in Pre-
Treated Patients) as compared to the non-advanced IPF group 3.74/100 patient years in Treatment-
Naïve Patients and 4.50/100 patient years in Pre-Treated Patients). The difference is particularly high 
for Pre-Treated Patients. 
This finding is not unexpected as pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease that steadily worsens over 
time. The median survival of patients with IPF ranges from 2.5 years to 3.5 years and therefore more 
fatal TEAEs has been observed in patients with advanced IPF. The most common adverse events 
leading to death were observed within the SOC of respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. AEs 
leading to death with the higher exposure-adjusted rate in the advanced IPF group was IPF and cardiac 
arrest (seen in pre-treated patients and associated with respiratory failure).

Serious adverse events 
•  Advanced IPF patients on pirfenidone as compared to non-advanced IPF patients on 
pirfenidone (data from studies of PIPF-004, PIPF-006, PIPF-016, MA29957 and PIPF-
012) 
SAEs were also reported with the higher rate in patients with advanced IPF as compared to patients 
with non-advanced IPF (58.92/100 patient years in Treatment-Naïve Patients and 82.91/100 patient 
years in pre-treated patients in the advanced IPF group as compared to 36.59/100 patient years in 
treatment-naïve patients and 41.68/100 patient years in Pre-Treated Patients in the non-advanced IPF 
group). 
When analyzing STEAEs by SOC, there were 3 SOCs that showed a higher rate of serious TEAEs 
(defined as a difference >5/100 PY) in patients with advanced IPF as compared to patients with non-
advanced IPF: respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; cardiac disorders; infections and 
infestations.  
The higher rate of STEAEs observed with advanced IPF for the SOC respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders was primarily driven by IPF and hypoxia (for treatment-naïve patients) and IPF, 
Respiratory Failure, Dyspnoea and  Acute Respiratory Failure (for pre-treated patients). 
•  Advanced IPF patients on pirfenidone as compared to advanced IPF patients on 
placebo- pooled safety data from studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006 and PIPF-016 
One SOC, cardiac disorders, showed a frequency of serious TEAEs higher than 3% in the pirfenidone 
arm, however due to small number of events no firm conclusion could be made. The PTs within the 
SOC Cardiac disorders in patients with advanced IPF will be monitored by the applicant as disused 
above. 
Severe adverse events 
•  Advanced IPF patients on pirfenidone as compared to non-advanced IPF patients on 
pirfenidone 
The exposure-adjusted rate of severe TEAEs such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, dyspnoea, 
pneumonia, respiratory failure, fatigue, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac arrest, acute respiratory 
failure, pulmonary embolism hypoxia, syncope, bronchitis, atrial fibrillation and acute myocardial 
infarction was higher in advanced IPF patients as compared to non-advanced IPF patients.  
It is claimed that these TEAEs are indirectly or directly related to the severity of the underlying 
disease, which can be agreed.  
For related severe TEAEs, PTs with a difference of >1/100PY between advanced vs non-advanced 
patients were seen for IPF (treatment-naïve patients) and fatigue (pre-treated patients). 
•  Advanced IPF patients on pirfenidone as compared to advanced IPF patients on 
placebo- pooled safety data from studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006 and PIPF-016) 
In the comparison between advanced patients receiving pirfenidone as compared to those on placebo  
the cardiac disorders and injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOCs showed a frequency of 
severe TEAEs 3% or higher in the pirfenidone arm than in the placebo arm. Again as discussed above 
for the severe TEAEs, the imbalance between pirfenidone and placebo in this SOC is driven by small 
differences across several PTs, the main one being the PT Angina pectoris. In the SOC injury, poisoning 
and procedural complications, the imbalance between pirfenidone and placebo is driven by small 
differences across several PTs, with none showing a difference higher than 2%. The reported PTs are 
animal bite, fall, rib fracture, and stent occlusion, and no consistent pattern is observed.

EMA/117564/2023

TEAEs of Special Interest   
The rates of TEAEs of special interest such as gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, photosensitivity, rash, 
dizziness, and fatigue were similar across advanced and non-advanced patients. The rate of weight 
decreased was higher in advanced IPF patients than in non-advanced IPF patients. In the comparison 
between advanced patients receiving  pirfenidone as compared to those on placebo the frequencies of 
GI disorders, photosensitivity, rash, weight decreased, and fatigue are higher in the pirfenidone arm 
versus placebo and they are listed in the current Esbriet SmPC. 
Although initially not defined as AESI, extra attention lays on the SOC of hepatobiliary disorders 
because of the known effects of pirfenidone on the liver. Exposure-adjusted rates of TEAEs within the 
SOC of hepatobiliary disorders are comparable between advanced and non-advanced patients, as well 
as between treatment-naïve and pre-treated patients. Underlying PTs are slightly different between the 
four groups, with cholelithiasis having the highest incidence in all groups. The minor differences 
between the advanced and non-advanced population are considered not clinically relevant.  
Safety in patients with advanced IPF and risk of pulmonary hypertension (study 
MAA29957). 
Patients with IPF and PH have been shown to have markedly higher 1-year mortality rates than IPF 
patients without PH. In Study MA29957, 18/89 (20.2%) patients in the pirfenidone group had died 
from all causes. This was higher than the rate from the pooled Phase III studies (4.4%), indicating that 
the patients in study MAA29957 may differ from the other advanced patients. Whether patients with 
use advanced IPF and risk for group 3 PH have a different, possibly more severe/serious safety profile 
than patients with advanced IPF without PH was explored by the applicant. In the SOCs vascular 
disorders and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, infections and infestations and cardiac 
disorders, higher exposure-adjusted rates in severe or serious TEAEs or TEAEs leading to death were 
consistently observed in study MA29957 compared to study PIPF-012. However, these differences can 
be mostly explained by the difference in severity of the underlying disease, i.e., a higher disease 
burden in patients with advanced IPF at risk of grade 3 PH. 
Laboratory findings   
Originally no discussion was provided by the applicant in relation to the frequency of laboratory 
findings in patients with advanced IPF as compared to patients with non-advanced IPF. The applicant 
clarified that an analysis of laboratory data were not provided because all laboratory abnormalities 
considered clinically significant by the investigators were collected as adverse events (AEs) and 
presented with the rest of the safety assessment in the submitted Summary of Clinical Safety. In 
addition, many years of post-marketing signal detection activities has not identified any evidence 
suggesting that patients with advanced IPF are more prone to laboratory abnormalities than patients 
with non-advanced IPF.  
Nevertheless, the requested analysis was performed. Six parameters showed a frequency of lab shifts 
≥5% in the pirfenidone arm compared to the placebo arm. Of the six parameters showing differences 
in grade shifts between the pirfenidone and placebo arms, two (alanine amino transferase and 
Gamma-glutamyl-transferase increases) are listed in the SmPC for Esbriet, one (protein) is likely due 
to the very small dataset and three (lymphocytes, platelets, and hypophosphatemia) are not confirmed 
by the box plot analysis and the cumulative experience.  
Post marketing data 
Esbriet capsules were first granted marketing approval in the EU on 28 February 2011, which marks 
the IBD.  Esbriet capsules were approved in the United States (U.S.) on 15 October 2014 and Esbriet 
film-coated tablets were approved on 11 January 2017.  Esbriet film-coated tablets were also approved 
Assessment report  
EMA/117564/2023

in the EU (24 April 2017), Canada (2 June 2017), Australia (23 October 2017), and Switzerland 
(8 November 2017). As of the DLP of this PBRER (27 February 2021), Esbriet capsules have been 
approved in 70 countries worldwide and Esbriet film-coated tablets have been approved in more than 
50 countries worldwide. 
The cumulative worldwide exposure to pirfenidone is estimated at 254,983 patient-
equivalents and 175,311 patient-years. 
The last safety review for Esbriet was performed the 14th PSUR (data lock point 27 February 2021). 
The safety data on the use of the product in advanced stages of IPF also come from Study WB29908, 
PIPF-025. Study WB29908 was a multicenter, long-term, prospective, observational study evaluating 
the long-term safety in patients who were prescribed Esbriet. Patients received Esbriet at the 
discretion of their physicians, and were followed through the registry for 2 years after they began 
treatment with Esbriet under real-world conditions. 
This registry complied with the requirement of a PASS, and as a post-authorization commitment, was 
approved by the CHMP.  
In Study WB29908 144 patients in advanced stages of IPF (baseline FVC <50%) were included. In this 
study 91 patients with advanced stages of IPF had 213 events adverse drug reactions of special 
interest (ADRSIs) (serious and non-serious). Most of these events were in the special interest 
categories of GI symptoms, photosensitivity reactions and skin rashes, fatigue and weight loss. 55 
patients with advanced stages of IPF had 82 other adverse drug reactions, predominantly non-serious 
events already listed in the SmPC.  These events included decreased appetite and respiratory events 
associated with the underlying disease (dyspnoea and cough); 1 patient each had pulmonary 
embolism, IPF, productive cough and respiratory failure. 9 patients with advanced stages of IPF had 13 
serious adverse drug reactions of special interest: one patient had a report of blood dyscrasias 
(mentioned previously) and the remaining events were predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms. 
The first interim report was of this study was included with PSUR #3 (EMEA/H/C/002154/ PSU/005; 22 
October 2012). The eighth and final report was included with PSUR #7 (PSUSA/00002435/201702; 28 
April 2017). In the assessment report circulated during this procedure, the PRAC assessor concluded 
that no new safety signals were identified in this study. In addition, it was agreed that the safety 
profile of pirfenidone when used in patients with advanced stages of IPF was consistent with the known 
safety profile of Esbriet. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety issues were identified compared between the non-advanced and advanced population.  
Agreed updates to the safety information are in 4.4. of the SmPC that Esbriet is essentially Sodium 
free and that exposure-adjusted analyses of pooled clinical trials in IPF confirmed that the safety and 
tolerability profile of Esbriet in IPF patients with advanced disease (n=366) is consistent with that 
established in IPF patients with non-advanced disease (n=942). 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.6.  Risk management plan 
As part of the proposed extension of indication in this variation the MAH had submitted an updated 
RMP version 12, dated 26 November 2021, following the request to delete severe skin reactions an 
important potential risk, following the PSUR assessment.  At this stage in the product life-cycle with 
cumulative post-marketing experience it was considered that the safety specification can be further 
updated to remove the following safety concerns:  
-Gastrointestinal symptoms 
-Risk of medication error in patients transferring between capsules and tablets,  
-Patients with QT prolongation,  
-Patients with underlying specific cardiac events. 
There were some additional editorial changes requested for Part V and Part VI of the RMP. The MAH 
submitted an updated RMP vs 12.1 addressing all issues raised in the Request for Supplementary 
Information. 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 12.1 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 12.1 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) considers it justified not conducting User Consultation for 
the Package Leaflet for this variation because: 
•  No significant changes impacting the readability of the package leaflet have been made. 
• 
• 
The new additions to the text follow the same structure and use similar descriptions and 
terminology as used in the approved package leaflet. 
The target group of users will be almost identical between the approved indication (mild to 
moderate IPF patients) and the applied indication (all IPF patients), with no significant 
difference in age or safety profile. 
•  Moreover, no change to posology is proposed in this application 
According to the European Commission Guidance document, “Guidance concerning consultation with 
target patient groups for the package leaflet”, user consultation should be considered where significant 
changes are made to the package leaflet through a variation procedure or Article 61(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC update procedure. 
This type II variation seeks to amend the currently authorized indication of Esbriet (pirfenidone) to 
cover treatment of all adult patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The current authorised 
indication is restricted to the treatment of adults with mild to moderate IPF. User consultation was 
conducted in the context of the initial Esbriet Marketing Authorisation Application, which sought 
approval for the treatment of adult patients with IPF.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown aetiology characterised by 
fibrosis of the lung interstitium, decrease in lung volume, and progressive pulmonary insufficiency 
typically leading to death (Lynch and Toews 1998). 
IPF is recognized by the American Thoracic Society (ATS), European Respiratory Society (ERS), 
Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS), and the Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) as a distinct 
form of interstitial lung disease (ILD), defined by a constellation of clinical, histopathologic, and 
radiologic features (Raghu et al. 2018, Raghu et al. 2011, and ATS/ERS 2002) and is also categorized 
as the most common histopathologic form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (Katzenstein and Myers 
1998). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently, two antifibrotic drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been shown to slow IPF progression 
(Oldham & Collard 2017) which led to their regulatory approvals across major geographies for the 
treatment of IPF. Pirfenidone was approved in the European Union (EU) in 2011, followed by 
nintedanib four years later in 2015. Both drugs were approved in the United Stated (US) in 2014. In 
contrast to the US and many other countries, pirfenidone in the EU is only authorised in the treatment 
of mild to moderate IPF. With this submission, the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) seeks to 
extend the EU indication for pirfenidone to include patients with advanced IPF. 
The Official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT Statement (2015) rated several treatment options, without a 
distinction for the severities of IPF.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
No new pivotal data were provided with this application. 
Utilising the data from the original pivotal trials investigating Esbriet as a treatment for IPF, as well as 
from study MA29957, a recently completed Phase 2 study in patients with advanced IPF, the applicant 
has performed retrospective post-hoc analyses to compare the efficacy and safety profile of Esbriet 
in patients with mild to moderate IPF versus patients with more advanced IPF.  
For the purpose of the post-hoc efficacy analyses of Studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006, PIPF-016 and PIPF-
012 advanced IPF was defined as patients with an FVC <50% predicted and/or DLco <35% predicted 
at baseline. As a consequence, all other patients were defined as having non-advanced IPF. In study 
MA29957 advanced IPF was defined as a measurable DLco >40% AND Risk of Group 3 PH. 
Data from the following studies has been used for the assessment of the efficacy in patients with 
advanced IPF: 
• 
Pooled Phase III studies (PIPF-004/006/016): A total of 623 patients were treated with 
pirfenidone and 624 with placebo. Among the 1247 patients, 1077 patients were categorized as 
having non-advanced IPF and 170 patients had advanced IPF.  
Assessment report  
EMA/117564/2023 
Page 85/90 
 
 
 
• 
PIPF-012 study: total 596 patients had available FVC or DLco data in Study PIPF-012. Of these, 
187 patients were classified as advanced IPF and 409 patients as non-advanced IPF. 
•  MA29957 study: A total of 89 patients received pirfenidone with added placebo. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Based on the results of the post-hoc analysis of PIPF-004/006/016 studies a similar treatment effect of 
pirfenidone was observed in patients with advanced as compared to patients with non-advanced IPF. 
The annual FVC decline was lower in the pirfenidone treated patients as compared patients on placebo 
regardless of the disease status. Among patients with advanced IPF, the annual FVC decline was 
significantly lower with pirfenidone versus placebo (150.9 mL vs 277.6 mL; nominal p=0.0035). 
Among patients with non-advanced IPF, annual FVC decline was also significantly lower with 
pirfenidone versus placebo (128.7 mL vs. 216.7 mL; nominal p=0.0001). The provided annual rates of 
% predicted change in FVC were in line with the FVC changes in mL.  
In relation to all-cause mortality assessment among patients with advanced IPF, less patients died in 
the pirfenidone group as compared to the placebo group. The percentage of patients with advanced IPF 
who died from any cause was 4.4% (4/90) in the pirfenidone subgroup compared with 15.0% (12/80) 
with placebo over 52 weeks of treatment. 
The results of the 6MWT confirmed the observation made for FVC that there is a treatment effect of 
pirfenidone in both non-advanced and advanced patient compared to respective placebo groups. For 
UCSD SOBQ score, there was a consistent effect of pirfenidone in reducing the worsening of dyspnoea 
in both populations compared to the greater deterioration in the placebo group. In summary, the 
secondary endpoint support the results of the primary endpoints.  
The results of the post-hoc analysis of Study PIPF-012 indicated that the annual rate of FVC decline 
(slope) in pirfenidone treated patients in the advanced IPF group was similar to the decline in the  non-
advanced group (-141.5 mL/year and -153.5 mL/year, respectively). All-cause mortality rate over 180 
weeks was lower among patients with non-advanced IPF (49/409; 12.0%) compared to patients with 
advanced IPF (52/187; 27.8%). 
In study MA29957, 89 patients treated with Esbriet monotherapy had a similar decline in FVC as 
Esbriet-treated patients in the post-hoc analysis of the pooled phase 3 trials PIPF-004, PIPF-006, and 
PIPF-016. ACM was 20.2%. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The provided  analyses were made post-hoc and are thus posed to bias. However, from a clinical point 
of view the drug effect in different stages of severity and the clinical endpoints can be considered 
reasonably justified. Analyses of secondary endpoints support to the observed results and the totality 
of data make the risk of a chance finding negligible.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Exposure-adjusted analyses of pooled clinical trials in IPF confirmed that the safety and tolerability 
profile of Esbriet in IPF patients with advanced disease (n=366) is consistent with that established in 
IPF patients with non-advanced disease (n=942). Adverse events that were higher in the advanced 
population treated with pirfenidone and can be considered ADRs are already listed as very common or 
common ADRs in the current Esbriet SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/117564/2023 
Page 86/90 
 
 
 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
IPF is a disease with high morbidity. The morbidity increases upon progression of the diseases. In the 
SOCs vascular disorders and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, infections and infestations 
and cardiac disorders, higher exposure-adjusted rates in severe or serious TEAEs or TEAEs leading to 
death were consistently observed in study MA29957 compared to study PIPF-012.  
These  differences can however be mostly explained by the difference in severity of the underlying 
disease, i.e., a higher  disease burden in patients with advanced IPF at risk of  grade 3 PH. The small 
difference in the SOC cardiac disorders as compared to placebo is noted but all serous or severe cases  
were considered to be not related to pirfenidone by the investigator and following continued post-
marketing monitoring by the MAH no signal of a safety profile in these patient subgroups different from 
the known safety profile had emerged. AEs within the SOC Cardiac  disorders will continue to be 
monitored by the applicant in PSURs.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Based on the results of the provided post-hoc analysis a similar treatment effect of pirfenidone was 
observed in patients with advanced IPF as compared to patients with non-advanced IPF.  
The difference in annual FVC decline between pirfenidone and placebo is considered relevant. Even a 
stable response can be considered of high clinical relevance for patients because IPF is a fatal disease 
with progressive deterioration of lung tissue. Hence preservation of slowing decline of pulmonary 
function, FVC and diffusion capacity, can be considered as one of main goals of treatment of IPF. The 
difference in mortality in the advanced IPF patients of 10.6% between the pirfenidone and placebo also 
clearly indicates a relevant benefit.  
No new safety signals were identified in the pooled analysis of PIPF-004, PIPF-006, PIPF-016, 
MA29957, PIPF-012 and PIPF-025 studies. The safety data of pirfenidone when used in patients in 
advanced stages of IPF was investigated also in the PAS study (WB29908). This study corroborated 
that the safety profile of pirfenidone when used in patients with advanced stages of IPF was consistent 
with the known safety profile of Esbriet. Previously reported adverse events associated with the use of 
pirfenidone are gastro intestinal events, photosensitivity, rash, weight decrease, and fatigue while the 
hepatic function has to be monitored frequently as advised in the SmPC. These events are considered 
to be manageable in the overall IPF population proposed to be included in the label with the 
established risk minimisation measures. Based on a consistent difference between the pirfenidone arm 
versus the placebo arm for AEs in the SOC Cardiac disorders, the applicant will monitor post-marketing 
AEs within the SOC Cardiac disorders in patients advanced IPF and presented them in the PSUR. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Considering  the  clinical  benefit  demonstrated  for  patients  in  advanced  stages  of  the  disease  and  the 
manageable risk profile of Esbriet a positive B/R can be concluded.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Esbriet is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include treatment of ‘advanced’ idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) by 
the deletion of the current qualifier ‘mild to moderate’, based on the results from Study 
MA29957; this is a 52-week Phase IIb, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
clinical trial in IPF patients with advanced lung function impairment (DLco < 40% of predicted) 
and at high risk of grade 3 pulmonary hypertension, and additional analyses performed on the 
original pivotal trials for pirfenidone in IPF. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. In addition, the MAH took 
the opportunity to include information in section 4.4 of the SmPC related to the content of 
sodium per Esbriet capsule and tablet. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 
12.1 of the RMP has also been submitted. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

1.  Introduction 
On 18 December 2017, the MAH submitted two completed paediatric studies for Omnitrope 5 mg/ml 
powder and solvent for solution for injection, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. 
These in-use-drug surveys were conducted for the purpose of investigating the safety and efficacy of 
Somatropin Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection, Sandoz during real 
world use. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric studies do not influence the benefit risk for Omnitrope 
and that no consequential regulatory action is required. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
It is assumed that the submitted studies SAN-EP00-PW and SAN-EP00-SGA are stand-alone studies. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
N/A 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Omnitrope, a recombinant human growth hormone was developed as a biosimilar medicinal product to 
the reference product Genotropin and has been approved in the European Union since 2006 trough a 
centralized procedure (EMEA/H/C/607) for the following indications: 
Infants, children and adolescents  
-  Growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone (growth hormone 
deficiency, GHD).  
-  Growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome.  
-  Growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency.  
-  Growth disturbance (current height standard deviation score (SDS) < -2.5 and parental 
adjusted height SDS < -1) in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA), 
with a birth weight and/or length below -2 standard deviation (SD), who failed to show catch-
up growth (height velocity (HV) SDS < 0 during the last year) by 4 years of age or later.  
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), for improvement of growth and body composition. The diagnosis 
of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing.  
- 
Adults  
-  Replacement therapy in adults with pronounced growth hormone deficiency.  
-  Adult onset: Patients who have severe growth hormone deficiency associated with multiple 
hormone deficiencies as a result of known hypothalamic or pituitary pathology, and who have 
at least one known deficiency of a pituitary hormone not being prolactin. These patients should 
EMA/412047/2018  
Page 4/24 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
undergo an appropriate dynamic test in order to diagnose or exclude a growth hormone 
deficiency.  
-  Childhood onset: Patients who were growth hormone deficient during childhood as a result of 
congenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic causes. Patients with childhood onset GHD should 
be re-evaluated for growth hormone secretory capacity after completion of longitudinal growth. 
In patients with a high likelihood for persistent GHD, i.e. a congenital cause or GHD secondary 
to a hypothalamic-pituitary disease or insult, an insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) SDS < -2 
off growth hormone treatment for at least 4 weeks should be considered sufficient evidence of 
profound GHD.  
Dosing 
Dosing varies between indications and ranges from 0.025 to 0.050 mg/kg/day. 
For PWS the dose regimen is: Generally a dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m2 
body surface area per day is recommended. Daily doses of 2.7 mg should not be exceeded. Treatment 
should not be used in paediatric patients with a growth velocity less than 1 cm per year and near 
closure of epiphyses. 
For SGA the dose regimen is: A dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day (1 mg/m2 body surface area 
per day) is usually recommended until final height is reached (see section 5.1). Treatment should be 
discontinued after the first year of treatment if the height velocity SDS is below + 1. Treatment should 
be discontinued if height velocity is < 2 cm/year and, if confirmation is required, bone age is > 14 
years (girls) or > 16 years (boys), corresponding to closure of the epiphyseal growth plates.  
This report will discuss the studies submitted by the applicant:  
•  A specific use-results survey of Somatropin BS S.C. Injection 5 mg, 10 mg for Prader-Willi 
syndrome (SAN-EP00-PW). 
•  A specific use-results survey of Somatropin BS S.C. Injection 5 mg, 10 mg for SGA (small for 
gestational age) short stature not associated with epiphyseal arrest (SAN-EP00-SGA).

A specific use-results survey of Somatropin BS S.C. Injection 5 mg, 10 mg for Prader-Willi syndrome. 
2.3.2.1.1.  Description 
Rapporteur’s comment: No formal study report with a clear description of the design of the survey, the 
results and safety observations was submitted. No formal protocol was included in the dossier. The 
applicant is requested to submit both the protocol and the final study report of both surveys.

Objective(s) 
This specific use-results survey was conducted for the purpose of investigating the safety and efficacy 
of somatropin (Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection) in current clinical 
practice.  
Rapporteur’s comment: This survey will capture real life information on treatment, efficacy and safety. 
As such these are the first data collected in a real-world practice setting included in this dossier.  
Study design 
Survey forms were collected from patients in a two-year registration period from 11 contract 
institutions in Japan. Patients were observed for one year and data on clinical outcome was acquired.  
Rapporteur’s comment: From the submitted information it is not clear how patients and centres were 
selected. It can thus not be assessed whether selection bias occurred. The requested protocol and the 
final study report should provide this information. 
In this in-use drug survey no control group was included which will hamper the assessment of the 
efficacy results. The applicant is requested to compare the survey data with growth charts of healthy 
Japanese children and/or natural history data of Japanese patients with Prader-Willi syndrome.  
Further a one year observational period is rather short for the assessment of efficacy (change in body 
composition or growth). Literature regarding this subject often described a more than 2 year study 
period. No information on long-term safety can be collected.  
Study population /Sample size 
The survey was started in September 2013 with the objective of accumulating the total number of 
registered subjects in the first two years or 5 subjects. 
Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome were included. Diagnosis of PWS was confirmed by DNA analysis.  
Rapporteur’s comment: no specifications are provided about the diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome. It 
is assumed the diagnosis is confirmed with appropriate genetic testing according to the Endocrine 
Society international guidelines1. The requested protocol and the final study report should provide this 
information. 
From the submitted summary it can be concluded that 8 out of the 9 patients were treatment naïve. 
Since the biggest effect (catch-up growth) of treatment is expected within the first two years, this is 
important information as the efficacy might be exaggerated.  
No formal sample size calculation was made. The survey aims to include 5 patients. Given the rareness 
of the PWS this is considered acceptable.  
Treatments 
Somatropin (Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection).   
Rapporteur’s comment: no specifications are provided about the exact dosing regimen. It is assumed 
that the recommendations in the SmPC are followed. The requested protocol and the final study report 
should provide this information.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The reported outcome parameters are: Change in height, height SDS value, Change in growth rate, 
Growth rate SDS, bone age and degree of obesity. These parameters were evaluated at the start of the 
administration, after 6 months and after 12 months.  
Rapporteur’s comment: These are the standard anthropomorphic measurements. As this is PWS it is 
considered a drawback that no information on body composition is measured. Furthermore, it is not to 
be expected that the efficacy can be reliably measured within the time frame of one year. 
Statistical Methods 
The 6 and 12 months measurements were compared with the measurements at the start of 
administration and analysed with a paired t-test.  
Rapporteur’s comment: as stated above, the timeframe of one year is on the short side to measure 
effects of Somatropin treatment. The data is analysed with a paired t-test, which is informative but due 
to the very low number of subjects, one should be very cautious interpreting significant results as 
evidence for efficacy. It is assumed that no corrections for multiple testing were applied, which would 
have been the correct approach. It is assumed that p-values were considered significant when p≤0.05. 
The requested protocol and the final study report should provide this information. 
2.3.2.1.2.  Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The final number of registered subjects was 9. 
Rapporteur’s comment: The aim of the survey was to include 5 patients with PWS. 9 subjects were 
included. From the submitted information it can be concluded that 8 out of 9 patients were treatment 
naïve. Given the rareness of PWS this low number of patients is to be expected. However the low 
number of subjects will not allow for firm conclusions.  
Baseline data 
7 subjects were found positive for a 15q11-13 deletion, one patient had uniparental disomy and one 
patient with another unspecified genetic abnormality. During the two-year registration period, the final 
number of registered subjects was 9. The ages of the subjects ranged from 0 years and 4 months till 
11 years and 6 months old. 
At the start of administration, the following baseline data (mean ± SD) was acquired:

Rapporteur’s comment:  
According to Japanese growth charts, the mean height of 81.66 cm at approximately 3 years of age 
matches the corresponding height SDS value of -2.532. The height standard deviation score is in the 
range of what can be expected of PWS patients3.  
The growth rate of 9.48 cm/year seems high for normal healthy children aged 3. The reported growth 
rate is -8.66 SD from that of healthy children is inconsistent with the reported growth rate.  
The low amount of subjects in the growth rate SDS (n=3) is unexplained. Since data on the growth 
rate at the start of the administration is presented from n=5 subjects, it is expected to also include 
these in the growth rate SDS analysis. The requested final study report should provide this 
information. 
Growth rate SDS value is a more relevant marker for efficacy since growth rate (like height and bone 
age) is highly dependent on age and sex.  
A growth rate of mean 9.48 cm/year is inconsistent with -8.66 SD while after 12 months of treatment 
they are at -1.14 SD with a growth rate of 7.52 cm/year. Clarification is needed on this point. It is also 
unexplained why there is only n=5 available for the 6 months observation while there is growth rate 
data of n=7. 
The reported mean bone age of 4.6 years for this group of children with a mean chronological age of 
3.2 years old seems high, especially when this is compared to the growth rate SDS of -8.66. As a lower 
height SDS is generally accompanied by a chronological/bone age greater than 1 indicating a delay in 
biological maturation these results appear inconsistent. Further clarification on the baseline data is 
requested. 
The degree of obesity is reported as BMI (kg/m2). The BMI of 12.44 is lower than can be expected for 
children with PWS4 Further clarification on the baseline data will be requested.  
Actual dosing 
Patients were administered a staring dose between >0 and 1.0 mg/week after titration a maximum of 
7.8 mg/week divided over 6 or 7 injections. The maintenance dose varied from 1 to 4 mg/day for most 
patients 
Rapporteur’s comment:  
No information is provided on the dose administration in mg/kg. It cannot be concluded whether the 
dosing is according to the SmPC. The requested study protocol and final study report should provide 
this information. If applicable, the applicant is requested how and why and for which patients the 
advised dose regimen is not applied. 
Efficacy results 
Height 
A statistically significant increase in height at 6 and 12 months (p≤0.001) compared to baseline was 
reported.

Rapporteur’s comment:  
As also highlighted above, height is a general anthropomorphic measurement, associated with age. 
Since all the included subjects are children, mostly in infancy/early childhood, an increase in height is 
expected. Change in height is thus not reflective of efficacy, unless it can be compared to a control 
arm. It would be informative to compare the growth of these patients with standard growth curves of 
Japanese children. Further comparison with published Japanese growth curves for PWS patients might 
be useful.  
Height SDS  
No statistically significant differences are observed in height SDS value after 6 and 12 months of 
treatment.

Rapporteur’s comment: based on existing literature5, the improvement in height SDS is expected to be 
greater in mainly treatment naïve patients than the reported values. The applicant is requested to 
discuss these results. It is agreed with the applicant that the absence of statistically significant 
outcomes might be due to the small number of subjects.  
Growth rate  
The applicant reports no statistically significant differences, but a tendency toward improvement, on 
the growth rate 6 (p=0.614) and 12 (p=0.355) months after treatment.

Rapporteur’s comment:  
It is not agreed with the applicant that the reported growth rates, show a statistical trend towards 
significance (for a trend the p value should be between 0.05 and 0.1).  
A growth rate of 12.38 cm/year is high, which could be indicative of a catch up growth. Interpretation 
of the data in light of the efficacy is not possible in the absence of a control arm.  
Growth rate SDS 
The applicant reports no significant differences, but a tendency toward improvement, on the growth 
rate 6 (p=0.198) and 12 months (p=0.052) after treatment.

the low subject number.  As pointed out above, clarification on growth rates and the matching growth 
SDS values is requested.

Rapporteur’s comment:  
As with height, bone age interpretation of the data in light of the efficacy is not possible in the absence 
of a control arm. In addition, the number of subjects in this analysis is extremely small. The applicant 
should discuss the odd results of an increase in bone age of 2.4 years after 6 months of administration 
compared to baseline and the subsequent drop in bone age of 1.4 years at 12 months.  
Degree of obesity 
The applicant reports no significant differences, but a tendency toward improvement, on the degree of 
obesity 6 (p=0.275) and 12 (p=0.744) months after treatment. Body fat percentage was measured in 
1 subject at the start of administration and at 12months, showing improvement from 48.2% to 20.1%.

Rapporteur’s comment: Clarification is needed on this data. The reported values cannot be kg/m2 as 
reported for baseline. It is nog agreed with the applicant that the reported p-values are indication of a 
tendency towards improvement.  
Safety results 
There were no reports of adverse reactions in all 9 subjects. The only adverse event with no causal 
relationship was the occurrence of dermatitis diaper in an 11 months old subject.  
No other noteworthy problems were reported.  
The specified priority survey items; abnormal glucose tolerance, scoliosis and respiratory disorders 
were not found. No requests were made for anti-GH antibody measurements and thus this data is not 
available.  
Rapporteur’s comment: the specified priority item “abnormal glucose tolerance, scoliosis and 
respiratory disorders” were not reported and there were no reports on adverse reactions. It is agreed 
that the case of dermatitis diaper is indeed unlikely to be related to the Somatropin treatment. There 
were no unexpected or unlisted adverse events.

Rapporteurs comment: No formal study report with a clear description of the survey, the results and 
safety observations was submitted. No formal protocol was included in the dossier. The applicant is

2.3.2.2.2.  Methods 
Objective(s) 
This specific use-results survey was conducted for the purpose of investigating the safety and efficacy 
of somatropin (Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection) in current clinical 
practice.  
Rapporteur’s comment: This survey will capture real life information on treatment, efficacy and safety. 
As such these are the first data collected in a real-world practice setting included in this dossier.  
Study design 
Survey forms were collected from patients in a two-year registration period from 47 contract 
institutions in Japan. Patients were observed for one year and data on clinical outcome was acquired.  
Rapporteur’s comment: From the submitted information it is not clear how patients and centres were 
selected. It can thus not be assessed whether selection bias occurred.  
In this in drug use survey no control group was included which will hamper the assessment of the 
efficacy results. At the very least it would have been better to compare the study data with natural 
history data of Japanese patients with SGA.  
Further a one year observational period is rather short for the assessment of efficacy (change in body 
composition or growth). Literature regarding this subject often described a more than 2 year study 
period. No information on long-term safety can be collected.  
Study population /Sample size 
The survey was started in September 2013 with the objective of accumulating the total number of 
registered subjects in the first two years or 100 subjects. As the target number was not reached within 
2 years, the registration period was extended with two months.  
Patients with a diagnosis of small-for-gestational age short stature (SGA) were included.  
Rapporteur’s comment:  
No specifications are provided about the diagnosis of SGA. The requested protocol and the final study 
report should provide this information. 
From the submitted summery it is not clear if the patients were treatment naïve for Somatropin or that 
they were included during treatment. Since the biggest effect of treatment is expected within the first 
two years, this is important information. The requested final study report should provide this 
information. 
No formal sample size calculation was made. The survey aimed to include 100 patients, given the 
rareness of the condition this is considered acceptable.  
Treatments 
Somatropin (Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection).   
Rapporteur’s comment: no specifications are provided about the exact dosing regimen. The requested 
protocol and the final study report should provide this information.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The reported outcome parameters are: Change in height, height SDS value, Change in growth rate, 
EMA/412047/2018  
Page 11/24 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Growth rate SDS, bone age. These parameters were evaluated at the start of the administration, after 
6 months and after 12 months.  
Rapporteur’s comment: These are the standard anthropomorphic measurements from which 
interpretation on efficacy is difficult due to the lack of a control group. The applicant is requested to 
compare the results with the results of the normal, healthy Japanese population and – as far as 
available – with Japanese SGA growth curves. Furthermore, it is not to be expected that the efficacy 
can be measured within the time frame of one year. 
Statistical Methods 
The 6 and 12 months measurements were compared with the measurements at the start of 
administration and analysed with a paired t-test. 
Rapporteur’s comment:  
As stated above, the timeframe of one year is on the short side to measure effects of Somatropin 
treatment. The data is analysed with a paired t-test, which is informative. It is assumed that no 
corrections for multiple testing were applied, which would have been the correct approach. It is 
assumed that p-values were considered significant when p≤0.05. The requested protocol should 
provide this information. 
2.3.2.2.3.  Results 
Actual dosing 
Patients were administered a starting dose varying from >0 to 5.0 mg/week after titration the maximal 
dose was 25 mg/week divided over 6 or 7 injections. However, divergent administration schedules of 
2-5 injection per week did also occur.  
Rapporteur’s comment: It cannot be confirmed that the dose administration is in accordance with the 
SmPC. The dosing seems plausible however the recommended administration regimen is one injection 
per day. The occurrence of divergent schedules of 2-5 injections per week is thus not in accordance 
with the SmPC. The requested final study report should provide this information. 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The final number of registered subjects was 125. Three subjects were excluded from the efficacy 
analysis because of missing height data at the start of the administration.  
Rapporteur’s comment: the amount of registered subjects is 125, which exceeds the aimed 100 
subjects. The number of subjects allows for statistical analysis.  
Baseline data 
During the registration period, 125 subjects were included in the study of which 82 were male and 43 
female ranging from 3 years till 15 years and 11 months.  
At the start of administration, the following baseline data (mean ± SD) was acquired:

Rapporteur’s comment: According to Japanese growth charts, the mean height of 103.44 cm at 
approximately 7 years of age matches the corresponding height SDS value of -2.86. The height 
standard deviation score is in the range of what can be expected of SGA patients7. The growth rate of 
0.97 cm/year is very low compared to growth charts of healthy children, indicative of severe growth 
retardation. This corresponds to the -8.89 SDS value. Growth rate SDS value is a more relevant 
marker for efficacy since growth rate (like height and bone age) is highly dependent on age. The 
reported bone age of 5.21 years for this group of children of 7 years old is also indicative of a delayed 
biological development.

Rapporteur’s comment:  
As also highlighted above, height is a general anthropomorphic measurement, associated with age. 
Since all the included subjects are children, mostly in infancy/early childhood, an increase in height is 
expected. Change in height is thus not reflective of efficacy, unless it can be compared to a control 
group. It would be informative to compare the growth of these patients with standard growth curves of 
Japanese children and/or those of Japanese SGA children.  
Height SDS  
The MAH reports a significant increase in height SDS value after 6 (p≤0.001) and 12 (p≤0.001) 
months of treatment.

Rapporteur’s comment: It is agreed that the improvement in height SDS is significant however, it is on 
the lower side of what can be expected based on existing literature7. In addition, the reported height at 
12 months seems to be more in the -1.5 SDS range when compared to Japanese growth charts. 
General comment with regard to the calculated SDS values; it is requested to provide the reference for 
the growth charts used in this study and/or those of Japanese SGA children.

Rapporteur’s comment: Compared to baseline, the catch up growth observed 6 and 12 months after 
treatment is very high. It is difficult to reconcile this with the marginal improvement in height SDS 
value. It is agreed that the improvement in growth rate is significant but without a control arm it is 
difficult to interpret in light of the efficacy. It would be informative to compare the growth of these 
patients with standard growth curves of Japanese children and/or those of Japanese SGA children, 
when available.

Rapporteur’s comment: since all the included subjects are children, mostly in infancy/early childhood, 
an increase in bone age (in this case an increase of 1.27 years in one study year) is expected. The 
observation period of one year is too short to show complete catch up in bone age. Earlier studies in 
Japanese children report treatment periods of approximately 3 years to show complete alignment of 
bone age/chronological age in children with SGA treated with GH7 .  
Safety results 
Two out of 125 subjects presented with adverse reactions; 1 subject presented with anaemia, 1 
subject with increased AST and ALT. Adverse reactions were mild and administration of the drug was 
continued. Three adverse events with no causal relationship were reported, all minor. There were no 
reports of serious or fatal cases. The specified priority survey item; abnormal glucose tolerance, was 
not found. No requests were made for anti-GH antibody measurements and thus this data is not 
available. 
Rapporteur’s comments: the specified priority item “abnormal glucose tolerance” was not reported. 
The adverse reactions that were reported were mild. It is agreed that no noteworthy safety issues 
emerged. No unexpected or unlisted adverse events were reported. Anti GH antibodies were not 
measured since no unexpected absence of efficacy was observed.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Both studies SAN-EP00-PW and SAN-EP00-SGA are observational surveys, assessing the efficacy and 
safety of Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml powder in current clinical practice in Japan. The nature of these 
surveys, specifically the absence of a control arm, and the lack of data on body composition 
measurements make the interpretation of the efficacy data difficult.  
In addition, information lacks on study protocol, diagnosis of the patients, inclusion of the patients to 
assess whether selection bias is likely and on treatment prior to the study. Therefore, the applicant is 
requested to provide the protocol and the final study reports. For both studies, the observation period 
was 1 year which is too short to draw firm conclusions considering the safety and efficacy of GH 
treatment.  
In study SAN-EP00-PW, 9 subjects with PWS were included in the analysis. Several uncertainties exist 
on the baseline data. Especially the growth rate of 9.48 cm/year and corresponding growth rate SDS of 
-8.66 SD seem highly improbable. In addition, the reported degree of obesity seems low for PWS 
patients. A significant effect of treatment was only observed on height (cm). Without a comparison to a 
control arm or comparison with growth data from healthy Japanese children or Japanese PWS patients 
no conclusions can be drawn on efficacy. No statistically significant effects were observed on height 
SDS, growth rate, growth rate SDS, bone age and degree of obesity. The explanation of the applicant 
that this is due to the very small group size is plausible. However, it could be speculated that the 
absence of efficacy is due to low dose administration. No important safety issues were reported. Since 
adequate information on posology is lacking, no assessment of the safety and efficacy data can be 
made at this time.  
In study SAN-EP00-SGA, 125 subjects were included in the analysis. Significant effects on height, 
height SDS, growth rate, growth rate SDS and bone age were reported after 6 months and 1 year of 
treatment. Effects on height, growth rate and bone age are only informative when compared to a 
control arm or to growth charts of healthy peers and/or SGA patients. The effect on height SDS seems 
low compared to literature and also when compared to the catch up growth reflected in the increase in 
growth rate. No serious adverse reactions were reported. Since adequate information on posology is 
lacking, no assessment of the safety data can be made at this time. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Because of the observational nature of the data, assessment on efficacy is difficult. In addition, 
essential information about the studies is lacking. Without adequate information on design, 
methodology, posology, etc. no assessment of the efficacy data is possible at this moment. As a 
consequence, no assessment of the benefit/risk of Omnitrope can be made. The MAH is requested to 
provide additional information on these studies.

5.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
With this response document the applicant would like to address the Rapporteur’s comments from the 
preliminary Assessment Report (AR) received on 02 Mar 2018 (updated AR dated 22 Mar 2018) related 
to two local Japanese non-interventional post-marketing ‘drug use result surveys’ submitted to EMA in 
Dec 2017 in accordance with article 46 of the Pediatric Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. 
Background of the submitted ‘drug use result surveys’ 
The applicant would like to emphasize that the submitted ‘drug use result surveys’ were performed as 
part  of  the  Marketing  Authorization  Holder’s  (MAH)  local  post-marketing  pharmacovigilance 
commitment as requested by the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). The 
requested  ‘drug  use  result  survey’  aims  to  “obtain  or  verify  information  on  the  incidence  of  adverse

reactions by disease type and information on medicine quality, efficacy and safety in clinical practice, 
with no conditions specified for patients using the medicine in question”. 
Omnitrope is approved in Japan for the following indications: 
Turner’s syndrome (TS) 
•  Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) 
• 
•  Dwarfism associated with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) 
• 
•  Short stature in short children born small for gestational age (SGA) 
•  Adults growth hormone deficiency (limited to severe cases) 
Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) 
Assessors comment 
Following the requests, the applicant has provided the study protocols and result reports. The result 
reports are the same as the ones provided in the first round. 
Although one of the objectives of the studies as explicitly to study the efficacy of Somatropin, and 
efficacy data was gathered, the applicant states the provided data makes assessment of efficacy not 
possible. This is agreed upon. Assessment will thus primarily focus on safety.  
Request for additional clarification to be provided by The applicant 
Provide the protocol and the final study report for both studies 
The applicant’ response: 
As requested by the Rapporteur, the protocols for both submitted special drug use result surveys SAN-
EP00-PWS [Module 1.R Response to clarification request dated 02 Mar 2018 - Attachment 2] and SAN-
EP00-SGA  [Module  1.R  Response  to  clarification  request  dated  02  Mar  2018  -  Attachment  3]  are 
provided in English translation as part of this submission. 
The applicant would like to highlight that the final survey  reports for SAN-EP00-PWS [Module 5.3.5.4 
SAN-EP00-PWS] and SAN-EP00-SGA [Module 5.3.5.4 SAN-EP00-SGA] submitted on 15 Dec 2017 were 
representative of the final clinical study reports (CSR) in a format as submitted/approved by the PMDA. 
Following the advice as laid out in the post-authorization procedural advice for users of the centralized 
procedure  section  18.3  “How  shall  I  present  my  article  46  pediatric  study  application  at  submission” 
advising to submit the final CSR, The applicant considers all requirements fulfilled. 
Rapporteurs’ questions concerning both studies 
Question 1: Please provide background information on the study inclusion (especially on the 
selection of patients and study centers).  
The applicant’s response concerning SAN-EP00-SGA: 
All details on the inclusion criteria can be found in the protocol in section 2 ‘Planned number of patients 
and its rationale’ [Module 1.R Response to clarification request dated 02 Mar 2018 - Attachment 3].  
Selection  of  patients:  The  survey  was  planned  to  include  patients  who  change  from  their  previous 
treatment to Omnitrope. However, as the number of such patients was expected to be very small, the 
survey was opened to all patients receiving Omnitrope. All patients are on treatment. 
Selection  of  study  centers: Approximately 100 patients were expected to be enrolled in this survey 
during the enrollment period of two years with the number of participating study sites to be around 50. 
EMA/412047/2018  
Page 17/24 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The  study  centers  have  been  selected  based  on  the  following  criteria:  Prerequisite  for  each  hospital 
and clinical was the existence of a dedicated pediatric department and routine use of growth hormone 
treatment in short children born SGA.  
The applicant’ response concerning SAN-EP00-PWS: 
All details on the inclusion criteria can be found in the protocol in section 2 ‘Planned number of patients 
and its rationale’ [Module 1.R Response to clarification request dated 02 Mar 2018 - Attachment 2]. 
Selection  of  patients:  The  survey  was  planned  to  include  patients  who  change  from  their  previous 
treatment to Omnitrope. However, as the number of such patients was expected to be very small, the 
survey was opened to all patients receiving Omnitrope. Approximately 4 patients were expected to be 
enrolled in the survey. 
Selection  of  study  centers:  The  study  centers  have  been  selected  based  on  the  following  criteria: 
Prerequisite  for  each  hospital  and  clinical  was  the  existence  of  a  dedicated  pediatric  department  and 
experience with growth hormone treatment in children with PWS. The number of such study sites was 
estimated to be around 3 to 4. 
Assessors comment 
Study protocols were provided by the applicant for both studies SAN-EP00-SGA and SAN-EP00-
PSW. The selection of study centers was as follows for both studies: A written request for survey will 
be sent to all study sites to which the product is supplied and an agreement will be entered into with 
those that accept the request. At participating study sites, medical representatives (MRs) will fully 
inform investigators and other site staff involved in the survey of the objective, methodology, items 
etc. of the survey. 
The objective for the PWS study was to include 3 or 4 study sites with 1 or 2 patients per study site. 
11 sites were finally included in the study, providing 9 patients in total.  
For the SGA study the objective was to include around 100 patients from an estimated 50 study sites. 
47 sites were finally included in the study, providing 125 patients in total. These numbers are in 
concurrence with the respective study protocols. No specific information about the included study 
centers was provided.  
Based on the additional explanation reassurance is given that the inclusion of patients can be 
considered at random and that no bias is to be expected. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 2: How was diagnosis of SGA and PWS confirmed and how do the included subject 
numbers relate to the total amount of PWS and SGA patients in Japan? 
The applicant’s response concerning SAN-EP00-SGA: 
In  2011,  there  were  about  1,057,000  births  in  Japan.  Of  these  births,  approximately  5%  of  the 
children  are  SGA.  Ninety  percent  of  SGA  neonates  experience  catch-up  growth  by  the  age  of  2.  It 
means  that  the  remaining  10%  are  SGA  children.  It  is  estimated  that  every  year,  around  5,300 
children are candidates for therapy in Japan (Karlberg and Albertsson-Wikland 1995).  
For every patient enrolled in survey SAN-EP00-SGA, all data to confirm the diagnosis SGA have been 
collected  in  addition  to  demographic  and  baseline  data  to  determine  the  patient’s  eligibility  for  study 
participation:

Past medical history 
The applicant’ response concerning SAN-EP00-PWS: 
PWS is a rare disease and in Japan about 70 children are born with PWS per year (Ehara et al 1995). 
As  stated  in  the  response  to  2.2.1  the  survey  was  planned  to  include  patients  who  change  their 
previous  treatment  to  Omnitrope.  As  the  number  of  such  patients  is  expected  to  be  very  small 
(Omnitrope market share is <5%), the survey was conducted on all patients receiving Omnitrope. 
For every patient enrolled in survey SAN-EP00-PWS, all data to confirm the diagnosis PWS have been 
collected  in  addition  to  demographic  and  baseline  data  to  determine  the  patient’s  eligibility  for  study

Assessors comment 
The applicant provided information about which data was gathered to confirm diagnosis of PWS and 
SGA but not according to which guidelines the diagnosis was confirmed. From the measurements 
mentioned by the applicant it can be concluded that the international guidelines considering the 
diagnosis of PWS or SGA are applied and that for the diagnosis the criteria mentioned in the SmPC are 
used. Therefore it can be concluded that the patients included indeed suffered form PWS or SGA.

Question 3: The applicant should confirm that the submitted studies SAN-EP00-PWS and 
SAN-EP00-SGA are stand-alone studies 
The applicant’ response: 
Herewith, The applicant confirms that the submitted drug use result surveys SAN-EP00-PWS and SAN-
EP00-SGA were performed as part of the Marketing Authorization Holder’s (MAH) local post-marketing 
pharmacovigilance commitment and are stand-alone surveys following Japanese regulations. 
Assessors comment 
The  submitted  studies  SAN-EP00-PWS  and  SAN-EP00-SGA  are  stand-alone  studies.  Question  is 
answered.  
Issue resolved. 
Question 4: Please provide dosage information in mg/kg/day for both studies. 
The applicant’s response concerning SAN-EP00-SGA: 
Dosage  and  administration  was  according  to  the  Japanese  product  information.  A  dose  of  0.23mg/kg 
body weight was administered in 6 to 7 doses per week via subcutaneous route of administration. In 
case  of  insufficient  treatment  effect,  the  administered  dose  was  increased  up  to  0.47mg/kg  body 
weight per week. Dosing regimen remained the same. 
Detailed  information  on  the  dosage  and  administration  can  also  be  found  in  the  provided  survey 
protocol section 4 “Dosage and Administration” [Module 1.R Response to clarification request dated 02 
Mar 2018 - Attachment 3]. 
The  applicant  would  like  to  emphasize  that  this  is  in  contrast  to  the  European  product  information 
advising a dose of 0.035mg/kg body weight per day (equal to 0.245mg/kg body weight per week). A 
current version of the Japanese product information translated into English is attached to this response 
[Module 1.R Response to clarification request dated 02 Mar 2018 - Attachment 4]. 
The applicant’ response concerning SAN-EP00-PWS: 
Dosage and administration was according to the Japanese product information. A dose of 0.245mg/kg

Detailed  information  on  the  dosage  and  administration  can  also  be  found  in  the  provided  survey 
protocol section 4 “Dosage and Administration” [Module 1.R Response to clarification request dated 02

The  applicant  would  like  to  highlight  this  is  the  same  dose  as  advised  in  the  European  product 
information,  recommending  a  dose  of  0.035mg/kg  body  weight  per  day  (equal  to  0.245mg/kg  body 
weight per week). A current version of the Japanese product information translated into English will be 
attached to this response [Module 5.3.5.4 EP00-PWS]. 
Assessors comment 
The applicant states that dosing in both studies was according to the Japanese SmPC. As outlined by 
the applicant, the dosing for children SGA differs between the Japanese and European SmPC (dose 
EMA/412047/2018  
Page 20/24 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
increases are warranted in case of a lack of efficacy according to the Japanese SmPC). Since the 
minimum dose is more or less equal, the differences in dosing to not give rise to safety concerns for 
the European population. Although the applicant has not provided the dosages in mg/kg/day as 
requested, the applicant confirmed that the dosing was indeed according to the SmPC.  
Issue resolved. 
Question 5: The applicant is requested how, why and for which patients the advised dose 
regimen from the SmPC is not applied 
The applicant’ response: 
As stated in question 4 “Please provide dosage information in mg/kg/day for both studies” dosage and 
administration  for  survey  SAN-EP00-SGA  was  in  contrast  to  the  advised  dose  regimen  from  the 
European Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

Assessors comment 
The occurrence of deviant dosing schedules is implied by the occurrence of 2, 3 or 5 times a week 
injections in the SGA survey report. These deviations have not been addressed by the applicant. 
Although it might be of interest for patients and prescribers to know what the reasons for the deviation 
from the dosing schedule as mentioned in the SmPC was for the assessment of the safety profile this 
information is of less relevance. Therefore this issue will not further pursued. 
Issue will not be further pursued. 
Rapporteurs’ questions concerning study SAN-EP00-PWS 
Question 6: Please provide clarification on the inconsistencies in baseline data of study SAN-
EP00-PWS, specifically clarify the reported growth rates and corresponding growth rate SDS 
and the data on degree of obesity as well as the numbers reported. The reported values on 
degree of obesity after 6 and 12 months cannot be as those reported for baseline  
The applicant’ response: 
As stated in section 1.1 “Background of the submitted drug use result surveys”, the limitations of the 
data  received  from  survey  SAN-EP00-PWS  make  interpretation  and  conclusion  as  requested  by  the 
Rapporteur difficult. The applicant, however, agrees with the Rapporteur that the number of available 
data differ from the basal to 6 month visit and to 12 month visit, but with the final data received from 
the survey it is not possible to draw the requested conclusions. 
It is known that starting GH-treatment earlier will result in advantageous treatment outcomes. But due 
to the small number of patients enrolled in SAN-EP00-PWS (start of GH in 7 PWS younger than 5 years 
EMA/412047/2018  
Page 21/24 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
and  in  2  older  than  6  years)  any  change  will  be  weighting  the  statistical  analysis  and  bias  any 
conclusion drawn.  
Body weight and BMI are not the ideal parameters to assess the efficacy since the positive increase of 
muscle  mass  as  the  on  target  effect  of  GH-treatment  might  increase  the  body  weight  and  falsify  the 
interpretation  in  this  short  period  of  report.  Analysis  of  the  lipid  profile  or  the  measurement  of  body 
impedance  or  composition  would  have  been  necessary  to  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  effect  of 
GH-treatment in PWS patients (Nagai et al 2000). 
Overall,  the  survey  SAN-EP00-PWS  was  not  designed  to  evaluate  efficacy  in  this  population  but  as 
already stated in section 1.1 ‘Background of the submitted drug use result surveys’, safety rather than 
efficacy was the primary objective of the survey.  
Assessors comment 
The applicant has not adequately addressed the discrepancies in the data. It is agreed that the survey 
data can not be used for efficacy assessment however this does not justify the reporting of discrepant 
findings. Especially the discrepancy between growth rate and growth rate SDS is unexplained. Since 
growth rate SDS is derived from the growth rate, patients number are expected to match. The 
mismatch between growth rate and growth rate SDS might be reflective of reporting errors.  
As for question 6 this question is more related to the efficacy as reported by the applicant. The efficacy 
information as presented in this report cannot be assessed due to inconsistencies. The safety data as 
presented does not give rise to any safety issue, however. 
Issue will not be further pursued. 
Question 7: The applicant is requested to compare the growth of the PWS patients with 
standard Japanese growth curves and those of Japanese PWS patients 
The applicant’ response: 
As  stated  in  section  1.1  ‘Background  of  the  submitted  use-result  surveys’  the  limitations  of  the  data 
received from survey SAN-EP00-PWS as well as safety being the primary objective make a comparison 
with the reference population of either healthy subjects or PWS patients difficult. 
The  mean  height  of  Japanese  children  with  PWS  approximates  around  the  −2  SD  values  for  normal 
children until pubertal age. The height difference between the children with and without PWS becomes 
apparent during the pubertal stage. The fall-off in linear growth occurs after age 13 year in males and 
after 11 years in females, probably reflecting their lack of pubertal growth. All these findings indicate 
that  the  degree  of  short  stature  is  more  prominent  in  males  than  in  females,  irrespective  of  ethnic 
groups, and the growth in individuals with the syndrome is genetically determined (Nagai et al 2000). 
Assessors comment 
The applicant states that the difference in height between children with PWS and without PWS 
becomes apparent during the pubertal stage but is -2 SD until pubertal age. In study SAN-EP00-PWS, 
only prepubertal patients were included, the SDS values match that of the – 2 SD value as reported by 
the applicant. No comparisons have been made by the applicant to compare the growth of the PWS 
patients with standard Japanese growth curves however, since no assessment of efficacy can be made 
this is not of concern.   
This issue will not be further pursued.

Question 8: Please discuss the apparent discrepancies between the improvement in height 
SDS value observed in this survey and the larger improvement reported in literature  
The applicant’ response: 
Because PWS patients enrolled in the survey were of varying age and only one year of follow-up was 
performed,  it  is  not  advisable  to  compare  the  received  data  with  available  data  from  literature. 
However,  SDS  is  one  of  the  index  for  growth  and  it  is  thought  that  there  is  seen  a  trend  to 
improvement in the height SDS value. 
Assessors comment 
It is agreed that one year of follow up is too short to allow for firm conclusions regarding the height 
improvement of PWS patients. It it not agreed that there is a trend in improvement in height SDS 
value however, the small patients numbers hamper the use of statistical analysis and also not allow for 
firm conclusions.  
Issue will not be further pursued. 
Question 9: The applicant should discuss the odd results of an increase in bone age of 2.4 
years after 6 months of administration compared to baseline and the subsequent drop in 
bone age of 1.4 years at 12 months. 
The applicant’ response: 
The odd numbers in bone age between the 6 months and 12 months’ time point are a result of several 
factors: 
•  A data point for one patient with a bone age of below 1 year was missing at the 6 months’ time 
point as compared to 12 months 
• 
• 
The overall small number of patients 
The heterogeneity of the group 
All of the above listed factors resulted in the odd numbers observed during the survey. As a result, no 
meaningful  statistical  analysis  or  conclusion  on  the  efficacy  of  GH-treatment  can  be  drawn  from  the 
received data. 
Assessors comment 
It is agreed that no meaningful conclusions considering efficacy can be drawn from these data, the 
explanation that one absent data point for a patient with a low bone age skews the results is 
acceptable.  
Issue resolved.

Rapporteurs’ question concerning study SAN-EP00-SGA 
Question 10: The applicant is requested to compare the results of study SAN-EP00-SGA with 
the results of the normal, healthy Japanese population and – as far as available – with 
Japanese SGA growth curves. 
The applicant’ response: 
As  stated  in  section  1.1  ’Background  of  the  submitted  use-result  surveys’  the  limitations  of  the  data 
received  from  survey  SAN-EP00-SGA  and  primary  focus  being  safety  and  not  efficacy  make  a 
comparison with the reference population of either healthy subjects or SGA patients difficult. 
The  non-interventional  survey  setup,  the  heterogeneity  of  children  recruited  and  short  observation 
period  do  not  allow  drawing  any  conclusions  concerning  efficacy  of  Omnitrope  in  this  population.  The 
main objective of this survey was to assess the safety of Omnitrope after one year of treatment and no 
unexpected adverse events occurred in this population during this period. 
The applicant is not aware of Japanese-specific SGA growth charts that can be used for comparison of 
the obtained data with normal, healthy Japanese population. 
Assessors comment 
It is agreed with the applicant that the presented data do not allow for firm conclusions regarding the 
efficacy of Omnitrope in treating SGA. The data could have been compared to the growth curves of 
normal healthy Japanese children as requested. It is agreed that no concerns were raised concerning 
the safety.  
Issue resolved. 
6.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Because of the observational nature of the data, assessment on efficacy is difficult and does not allow 
for firm conclusions. The safety information however is assessable. No unexpected or unlisted safety 
issues were reported. It is agreed with the applicant that no further changes to the SmPC are 
necessary.

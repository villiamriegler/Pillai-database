Saxagliptin is a DPP4-inhibitor, used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It was first 
approved for marketing in the European Union (EU) via the Centralised Procedure on 01 October 2009 
as Onglyza and as fixed dose combination with metformin as Komboglyze on 24 November 2011. 
Currently saxagliptin is indicated as monotherapy, as dual therapy with metformin, SU or TZD, as 
triple therapy with metformin and SU, and as combination with insulin. In this type 2 variation the 
MAH seeks extension of the indication as triple oral therapy in combination with metformin plus 
dapagliflozin. The application is supported by data from three clinical trials (CV181168, CV181169, and 
MB102129). These trials were previously submitted in support of the QTERN (saxagliptin/dapagliflozin) 
marketing application (procedure number EMEA/H/C/004057, CHMP positive opinion dated 26 May 
2016). Supportive safety information are presented from the ST + LT Pool (pooled data from Study 
CV181169) and the ST + LT treatment periods (from Studies CV181168 and MB102129). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

2.4.1.  Main studies 
In support of the application three clinical trials were submitted: (CV181168, CV181169, and 
MB102129). Studies CV181169 and CV181168 will be used to support efficacy, and the integrated data 
from all 3 of these studies will be used to show safety and tolerability in the short-term plus long-term 
treatment periods (ie. ST + LT Pool) for up to 52 weeks. 
Methods 
Study CV181169 was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, 24-
week Phase 3 trial in 534 subjects designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy (primary endpoint: 
mean change from baseline in HbA1c) of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin added concurrently to metformin 
compared with dapagliflozin added to metformin and saxagliptin added to metformin in subjects with 
T2DM with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin alone. The study consisted of a screening 
period, followed by a lead-in period (4-weeks), and then a 24-week double-blind treatment period. 
Study CV181168 and Study MB102129 were multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group, 24-week Phase 3 trials in 315 and 320 subjects, respectively, designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy (primary endpoint: mean change from baseline in HbA1c) of the 
sequential addition of saxagliptin to dapagliflozin and metformin  (CV118168) or dapagliflozin to 
saxagliptin and metformin  (MB102129) compared with the addition of placebo in subjects with T2DM 
with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and dapagliflozin or saxagliptin. The studies had a 
screening period, followed by an OL treatment period (16 weeks), and then a 24-week double blind 
treatment period. Eligible subjects could enter the long-term (LT) extension for an additional 28 
weeks. In study MB102129, to facilitate recruitment, patients were divided into two strata, one of 
which comprised patients who were already being treated with a DPP4 inhibitor at the time of the 
screening visit. 
Study participants 
In all three studies, the target population was male and female subjects aged ≥18 years with T2DM 
and inadequate glycaemic control on metformin alone. Subjects were to have been on stable 
metformin therapy for at least 8 weeks prior to screening visit at a dose of ≥1500 mg per day, have a 
C-peptide value of ≥0.34 nmol/L, and have a body mass index (BMI) ≤45.0 kg/m2 at the screening 
visit. Subjects with moderate or severe impairment of renal function were excluded.

Objectives 
The objective of the studies was to assess superiority of the combination of saxagliptin + dapagliflozin 
added concurrently or sequentially to metformin  versus the monocomponents plus metformin in 
reducing HbA1c. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint for all 3 studies was mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were: 1) Mean change from baseline in 2-hour PPG during a liquid meal 
tolerance test (120-minute Meal Tolerance Test [MTT]) at Week 24; 2) Mean change from baseline in 
FPG at Week 24; 3) Percent of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response, defined as a 
HbA1c <7.0% at Week 24, and 4) Mean change from baseline in body weight at Week 24. 
Other efficacy endpoints were about rescue treatment or discontinuation for lack of efficacy, AUC glucose 
during MTT, serum lipids. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed using a longitudinal repeated measures analysis with 
terms for baseline value, treatment group, time, the interaction of treatment group and time, and the 
interaction of baseline value and time, including only observations prior to rescue. Point estimates and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the adjusted mean changes within each treatment 
group as well as for the differences in adjusted mean changes between treatment groups. For all three 
studies, in order to protect the overall type I error rate, the interpretation of the family-wise statistical 
significance of treatment comparisons for each secondary efficacy endpoint was done using a step-wise 
procedure (in CV181169, the test was simultaneously applied to the two treatment comparisons). 
The analysis of mean change from baseline at Week 24 for the secondary efficacy endpoint 2-hour PPG 
was based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model using last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
methodology with terms for treatment group and baseline value in the model. Analyses of the mean 
change from baseline at Week 24 for FPG and total body weight were performed using the same 
longitudinal repeated measures model as for the primary efficacy endpoint. The proportion of subjects 
achieving therapeutic glycaemic response (defined as HbA1c <7.0%) at Week 24 (LOCF) was 
summarised by treatment group and compared between treatment groups using the methodology of 
Zhang et al (Zhang et al 2008) and Tsiatis et al (Tsiatis et al 2008). The 95% CIs for the response rate 
within each treatment group as well as for the difference in response rates between treatment groups 
was calculated with adjustment for baseline HbA1c.

Recruitment 
Recruitment periods for each of the studies were as follows:  
Study CV181168 Study initiation date: 29-jun-2012, Study completion date: 12-Jan-2015. Database 
lock for the 24 week, Short-term, Double blind period was 27-aug-2014. 
Study CV181169 : Study initiation date: 05-jun-2012, Study completion date: 17-Jan-2014. 
Study MB102129 : Study initiation date: 21-sep-2012, Study completion date: 19-Feb-2015. Database 
lock for the 24 week, short-term, double blind period was 25-sep-2014. 
Conduct of the study 
In general, there were no important differences between treatment groups. In all studies, the most 
common reason for subjects enrolled but not entering treatment period was no longer meeting 
eligibility criteria (between 40 and 50%). As can be expected, in study CV181168 and MB102129 a 
number of subjects was sufficiently controlled after the OL treatment period, and thus were not 
randomised for additional treatment. 
Baseline data 
The demographics and disease characteristics of the subjects in study CV181169, CV181168, and 
MB102129 are summarized in Table 4. The treatment groups within the respective studies were well-
balanced with regard to demographic and baseline characteristics, including diabetes-related medical 
history (hyperlipidaemia, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and CV disease). The majority of subjects were 
White; mean age was 53.8-55.1 years. There were few subjects ≥75 years of age (1 to 5 subjects per 
study). The entrance criterion of HbA1c ≥8.0%, ≤12.0% (Study CV181169) and ≥8.0%, ≤11.5% 
(Studies CV181168 and MB102129) in subjects not controlled on metformin monotherapy was selected 
to be more representative of patient populations with T2DM encountered in clinical practice. In Study 
CV181169, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.9%. In Studies CV181168 and MB102129, the mean 
baseline HbA1c values after the pre-randomisation OL treatment period were 7.9% and 8.2%, 
respectively. Across studies, subjects had a high mean weight ≥87 kg and body mass index (BMI) ≥31 
kg/m2. Mean duration of T2DM was at least 7.6 years. Along with high mean baseline HbA1c, these 
characteristics suggest more advanced disease in these subjects and are representative of T2DM 
patients that present in clinical practice who have not achieved their target goals.

Numbers analysed 
For all three studies, the primary data set for efficacy analysis was the respective Randomised 
Subjects data set. These consisted of data from all randomised subjects who took at least one dose of 
double-blind study drug during the ST double-blind periods. Numbers are shown in Table 2 (Disposition 
of subjects). 
Outcomes and estimation 
The endpoints are presented in the tables summarizing the efficacy results in the following section.  
Summary of main studies 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Design 
This was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study in 534 
subjects with T2DM designed to compare the mean change from baseline in 
HbA1c achieved with saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin vs. saxagliptin 
+ metformin and vs. dapagliflozin + metformin after 24 weeks of double-
blind treatment. The target population was male and female subjects aged 
≥18 years with T2DM and inadequate glycaemic control on metformin alone. 
Subjects were to have been on stable metformin therapy for at least 8 weeks 
prior to screening visit at a dose of ≥1500 mg per day, have a C-peptide 
value of ≥0.34 nmol/L, and have a body mass index (BMI) ≤45.0 kg/m2 at 
the screening visit. Subjects with moderate or severe impairment of renal 
function were excluded.

Statistical methods 
Treatments groups 
Endpoints and 
definitions 
The mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 was assessed 
comparing the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin treatment group vs. 
the saxagliptin + metformin treatment group and vs. the dapagliflozin + 
metformin treatment group. The min test approach of Laska and Meisner was 
implemented to test saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin vs. saxagliptin + 
metformin and vs. dapagliflozin + metformin. Statistical significance of the 
primary endpoint would be claimed if the p-values for both comparisons were 
significant at the 2-sided, 0.05 significance level. Power calculations for 
longitudinal repeated measures analyses depend on many factors, including 
the pattern of drop out over time and correlations among the various time 
points included in the model. Power calculations were based on ANCOVA with 
LOCF, with the expectation that this would provide a good estimate of the 
power for the primary analysis using a longitudinal repeated measures model. 
With 163 subjects per treatment group, there was 90% power to detect a 
difference in mean HbA1c of 0.4% between the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + 
metformin treatment group vs. the saxagliptin + metformin treatment group 
and vs. the dapagliflozin + metformin treatment group, assuming a standard 
deviation of 1.0%. Assuming that 5% of subjects would not have a post-
baseline assessment, a total of approximately 516 subjects (172 subjects per 
treatment arm) needed to be randomized. Assuming that 50% of screened 
subjects would fail to meet screening criteria, a total of 1032 subjects needed 
to be screened.

This was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study in 
315 subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) designed to compare the 
mean change from baseline in HbA1c achieved with saxagliptin + 
dapagliflozin + metformin vs. placebo + dapagliflozin + metformin after 24-
weeks of ST double-blind treatment. 
Screening period: 
Up to 2 weeks 
Open-Label treatment phase: 
14-16 weeks 
Main treatment phase 
Efficacy and  safety Extension phase: 
24 weeks 
28 weeks 
The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 
24 (using longitudinal repeated measures analysis) comparing the saxagliptin 
+ dapagliflozin + metformin treatment group and the placebo + dapagliflozin 
+ metformin treatment group. Statistical significance would be claimed if the 
p-value for the comparison was significant at the 2-sided, 0.05 significance 
level. Power calculations were based on ANCOVA with LOCF, with the 
expectation that this would provide a good estimate of the power for the 
primary analysis using a longitudinal repeated measures model. With 133 
subjects per treatment group, there was 90% power to detect a difference in 
mean HbA1c of 0.4% between the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin 
treatment group and the placebo + dapagliflozin + metformin group, 
assuming a standard deviation of 1.0%. Assuming that 5% of subjects would 
not have a post-baseline assessment, a total of approximately 280 subjects 
(140 subjects per treatment arm) needed to be randomized. Assuming that 
50% of screened subjects would fail to meet screening criteria, a total of 934 
subjects needed to be screened. The number of subjects with HbA1c ≥ 8.0% 
and ≤ 9.0% at the start of the open-label treatment period was to be capped 
at 50%.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No separate studies were conducted specifically to address the efficacy of dapagliflozin + saxagliptin in 
special populations. In all three studies, treatment-by-subgroup interaction testing was used to 
evaluate treatment effects on the primary endpoint (adjusted mean change in HbA1c) in subgroups 
where the effect might vary (from the primary endpoint analysis). Subgroups analysed were Baseline 
HbA1c, Race, Gender, Age, Female/Age and Region. 
There were no interactions between baseline HbA1c and treatment (the interaction p-values were 
above the 0.1 threshold) in all 3 studies. In all studies, mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c at 
Week 24 were generally greater for subjects with higher baseline values. No potential treatment 
interactions (p-values >0.10) were detected for age or gender subgroups or race. 
The subgroup analysis for disease duration subgroups in Study CV181169 did not reveal any 
interaction between disease duration and treatment. 
In Study CV181169, a potential interaction was detected for region. However, no such interaction was 
seen in study CV181168 and MB102129 and an interaction is also not representative of the broader 
saxagliptin and dapagliflozin experience. 
Potential treatment interactions were detected for female age in Studies CV181169 (p=0.0082) and 
MB102129 (p=0.0154). In Studies CV181169 and MB102129, the reduction of HbA1c in saxagliptin-

containing treatment groups was diminished in women ≤50 years of age. Results are shown in Table 8. 
However, as the studies were not designed to detect such subgroup differences, and due to the small 
sample size in the female ≤50 groups, these results should be interpreted with caution.

Primary efficacy endpoint: HbA1c change from baseline at Week 24 
The primary efficacy endpoint was met for both studies (Table 9). Repeated measures analysis of the 
primary endpoint (excluding data after rescue) demonstrated a clinically relevant effect of saxagliptin 
+ dapagliflozin + metformin treatment  in lowering HbA1c at Week 24 which was statistically 
significant versus  the addition of dapagliflozin to metformin (studies CV181169 and CV181168) and 
versus the addition of saxagliptin to metformin (studies CV181169).  
In Study CV181168, the adjusted mean changes from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 in the saxagliptin 
+ dapagliflozin + metformin and placebo + dapagliflozin + metformin groups were 0.51% and 0.16%, 
respectively. The difference with saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin treatment was -0.35% 
(p<0.0001) vs placebo + dapagliflozin + metformin. 
In study CV 181169,  adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 was -1.47% for the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin treatment group, -0.88% for the saxagliptin + metformin 
group and -1.20% for the dapagliflozin + metformin group.  The difference with saxagliptin + 
dapagliflozin + metformin treatment was -0.27 versus dapagliflozin + metformin. 
The treatment effect observed at the end of the 24-week period was durable to the end of the 52-week 
ST + LT treatment period of Study CV181168. At week 52 changes from baseline in HbA1c in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin and placebo + dapagliflozin + metformin groups were -0.38% 
(95% CI: -0.53, -0.22) and 0.05% (95% CI: -0.11, 0.20) respectively, with a mean difference of -
0.42% [(5% CI: -0.64, -0.20).

Secondary endpoints 
120-minute PPG change from baseline at week 24 
Repeated measures analysis of 120-minute PPG at Week 24 (excluding data after rescue) did not show 
a statistically significant effect of saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin in lowering PPG at Week 24 
(LOCF) when tested against placebo + dapagliflozin + metformin in Study CV181168 or when tested 
simultaneously against both saxagliptin + metformin and dapagliflozin + metformin in Study 
CV181169. The difference between the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group and the 
dapagliflozin + metformin was -0.51 and -0.32 mmol/L in study CV181169 and CV181168, 
respectively. 
FPG change from baseline at week 24 
The adjusted mean change in FPG from baseline at Week 24 (excluding data after rescue) for the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group was larger than that of the saxagliptin + metformin 
group and similar to that of the dapagliflozin + metformin group. Differences between the triple 
therapy and dapagliflozin + metformin treated group were -0.34 and -0.20 mmol/L, respectively in 
trial CV181169 and CV181168 (non-significant). In study CV181168 changes were maintained up to 
week 52, with a difference between triple therapy and dapagliflozin + metformin group of -0.45 
mmol/L. 
Proportion of subjects achieving therapeutic glycaemic response (HbA1c<7%) at Week 24 
In study CV181169, the proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c <7% at Week 24 was nearly 2-fold 
higher in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group (41.4%) compared with the saxagliptin + 
metformin group (18.3%) and the dapagliflozin + metformin group (22.2%). The adjusted differences 
between the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group and the saxagliptin + metformin and 
dapagliflozin + metformin groups were 23.1% and 19.1%, respectively. The 95% CIs for the 
differences excluded zero for the comparison versus the saxagliptin + metformin (14.7, 31.5) and 
dapagliflozin + metformin (10.1, 28.1) treatments. 
In study CV181168, the proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c <7.0% at Week 24 was greater in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group (35.3%) than in the placebo + dapagliflozin + 
metformin group (23.1%). The difference between the two groups was 12.2%. At Week 52 the 
adjusted percent of subjects with HbA1c <7.0% was 29.3% in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + 
metformin group and 13.1% in the placebo + dapagliflozin + metformin group; the adjusted percent 
difference between the two treatment groups at Week 52 was 16.2% (95% CI: 8.1, 24.2).  
Body weight change from baseline at Week 24 
In both studies, the dapagliflozin-containing treatment groups showed a decrease from baseline in 
mean adjusted body weight at Week 24 (-0.51 kg to -2.39 kg). The weight reduction observed in 
groups treated with both saxagliptin and dapagliflozin suggests that the dapagliflozin-induced weight 
loss is maintained in the presence of saxagliptin. 
Over 52-weeks of treatment, there were modest body weight decreases in both treatment groups in 
Study CV181168: -1.13 kg in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group, and -1.50 kg in the 
placebo + dapagliflozin + metformin group. Dapagliflozin  results in the consistent reduction of body 
weight. Saxagliptin has been shown to be weight neutral. The combination of saxagliptin + 
dapagliflozin + metformin provides significant glycaemic control with the potential for moderate weight 
loss.

Discontinuation for lack of glycaemic control or rescue for failing to achieve prespecified glycaemic 
targets 
In Study CV181168, the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group had fewer subjects 
discontinued for lack of glycaemic control or rescued for failing to achieve prespecified glycaemic 
targets than the placebo + dapagliflozin + metformin group (2.5% and 4.4%, respectively). 
Discontinuation or rescue began at Week 14.

In Study CV181169, the saxagliptin + metformin group had the greatest proportion of subjects 
discontinued for lack of glycaemic control or rescued for failing to achieve prespecified glycaemic 
targets: 9.4%, compared with 5.5% in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group and 3.4% in 
the dapagliflozin + metformin group. Discontinuation or rescue began at Week 8. 
In the ST + LT period, lower proportions of subjects discontinued study treatment for lack of glycaemic 
control or were rescued for failing to achieve pre-specified glycaemic targets in the saxagliptin + 
dapagliflozin + metformin treatment group (18.6%) compared to the placebo + dapagliflozin + 
metformin group (28.4%) through Week 52. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In support of the Application, data from three clinical Phase 3 studies were submitted. All three were 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active (CV181169) or placebo-controlled (CV181168 and 
MB102129), parallel-group studies. Study CV181169 consisted of a screening period, followed by a 
lead-in period (4-weeks), and then a 24-week double-blind treatment period. Study CV181168 and 
MB102129 had a screening period, followed by an OL treatment period (16 weeks), and then a 24-
week double-blind treatment period. 
Studies CV181169 and CV181168 were used to support efficacy, and the integrated data from all 3 of 
these studies were used to show safety and tolerability in the short-term plus long-term treatment 
periods (ie, ST + LT Pool) for up to 52-weeks. 
Study CV181169 was a concomitant add-on study: patients inadequately controlled by metformin only, 
were randomised to receive saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin or saxagliptin + metformin or 
dapagliflozin + metformin. 
Study CV181168 and MB102129 had a sequential design. During the OL treatment period subjects 
received dapagliflozin (study CV181168) or saxagliptin (study MB102129) in addition to metformin. 
Subjects insufficiently controlled on this combination after 14 weeks of treatment received the 
additional drug (saxagliptin or dapagliflozin) or placebo for the 24 double-blind treatment period. 
In all three studies, studies, the target population was male and female subjects aged ≥18 years with 
T2DM and inadequate glycaemic control on metformin alone. Subjects had to be on stable metformin 
therapy for at least 8 weeks prior to screening visit at a dose of ≥1500 mg per day, with a C-peptide 
value of ≥0.34 nmol/L, and a body mass index (BMI) ≤45.0 kg/m2 at the screening visit. Subjects with 
moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) were excluded. 
Inadequate glycaemic control was defined as central laboratory HbA1c at screening visit of ≥8.0% and 
≤12.0% for study CV181169 and ≥8.0% and ≤11.5% for study CV181168. Study MB102129 was 
comprised of two strata: Stratum A, with subjects who had been on stable metformin therapy alone, 
and Stratum B, with subjects who had been on a maximum dose of a DPP4 inhibitor for ≥8 weeks prior 
to screening visit in addition to metformin. For Stratum A, inadequate glycaemic control was defined as 
central laboratory HbA1c ≥8.0% and ≤11.5% at the screening visit, while for Stratum B it was defined 
as central laboratory HbA1c ≥7.5% and ≤10.5% at the screening visit. For both study CV181168 and 
study MB102129, inadequate glycaemic control for randomisation into the 24-week short-term (ST) 
study periods (after the open-label treatment periods), was defined as central laboratory HbA1c of 
≥7.0% and ≤10.5%, slightly lower than the ≥8.0% and ≤12.0% criterion for randomisation into study 
CV181169. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/291920/2017 
Page 26/43 
 
  
  
The design and conduct of the studies were appropriate to establish the efficacy and safety of 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin vs dapagliflozin + metformin.  
In study CV181169, metformin XR release tablets were used as background therapy. Metformin XR 
tablets are not registered in all EU countries. There are no formal studies that have demonstrated non-
inferiority compared to Metformin IR. In the MAA for dapagliflozin and for Komboglyze (FDC of 
saxagliptin + met) Metformin XR has been used in trials, but not in the pivotal trials. Two thirds of 
subjects used metformin XR in a dose between 1700 and 2500 mg daily, and one third used 1500-
1700 mg daily. Maximum recommended dose of metformin XR is 2000 mg, while maximum daily dose 
for metformin IR is 2550 to 3000 mg. That is probably the reason why more patients in the two 
sequential studies used metformin in higher doses (above 2500 mg) as in these studies metformin IR 
was used. Mean metformin doses were not presented, but these will be lower in study CV181169. This 
makes a comparison between studies more complicated. 
The randomisation and blinding procedures were adequate. The analysis populations, analysis of the 
primary and secondary endpoints and the step-wise procedure to ensure control of the overall type I 
error rate are acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study population of the three studies can be considered representative of the target population. 
However, few subjects ≥75 years old were included. 
Baseline HbA1c was rather high in study CV181169 (8.94%). In study CV181168 and MB102129 
baseline HbA1c was initially also high (9.33 % in Study CV181168 and around 9% in MB102129 at 
Week -16). Due to treatment with, respectively, dapagliflozin and saxagliptin, HbA1c decreased during 
OL treatment, and “baseline” HbA1c as defined by the Applicant at randomisation was 7.91 and 
8.20%, respectively. 
Primary endpoint 
Primary endpoint (change in HbA1c at Week 24) was met in both studies used for efficacy. Repeated 
measures analysis of the primary endpoint (excluding data after rescue) demonstrated a clinically 
relevant effect of saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin treatment  in lowering HbA1c at Week 24 
which was statistically significant versus  dapagliflozin + metformin (studies CV181169 and CV181168) 
and versus  saxagliptin + metformin (studies CV181169). Results show that both components 
contribute to the effect of the combination, although dapagliflozin seems to be more effective than 
saxagliptin. 
The difference of Saxa + Dapa + metformin vs Dapa + Met was small: only -0.27% in study 
CV181169. This is below the accepted delta for non-inferiority trials in diabetes. Apparently, the 
additional value of Saxagliptin on top of Dapagliflozin and Metformin is small. The clinical relevance is 
debatable, although one could argue that the response rate is different (22% Dapa + Met vs 41% 
Dapa/Saxa +Met). The finding observed in Study CV181169 is confirmed in Study CV181168: the 
additional efficacy of Saxagliptin on top of Dapa + Met is limited (HbA1c = -0.35%). This figure is very 
close to the delta of 0.30% used in non-inferiority trials. Although this difference is statistically 
significant, the clinical relevance is doubtful. Even the response rate Saxa +  Dapa + Met is not 
convincingly superior to Dapa + Met (35% vs 23%).  
The Applicant has shown that, when given together, the contribution of both components depends on 
baseline HbA1c. Saxagliptin is contributing a larger proportion to the total combination effect at lower 
baseline HbA1c levels than at higher ones, and conversely, dapagliflozin is contributing a larger 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/291920/2017 
Page 27/43 
 
  
  
proportion to the total combination effect at higher baseline HbA1c levels than at lower ones. 
Furthermore, the difference measured between the combination and the monocomponents is not quite 
representative for the actual contribution of each component. Although there is no direct 
pharmacodynamic interaction, when combined, both the effect of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin seems 
to be reduced, as the total effect of the combination is not the sum of the individual effects. This is 
because both components for their action are dependent on plasma glucose levels.  
Saxagliptin has potential benefits apart from HbA1c reduction, such as effect on glucagon and C-
peptide, but their clinical relevance remains unproven. 
Nevertheless, there might be patients who can benefit from the addition of saxagliptin. However, as 
the response is variable and it is not known which patient will benefit, treatment effects should be 
monitored in individual patients.  
Secondary endpoints 
120-minute PPG 
In all treatment groups a reduction in 120-minute PPG was observed. Reductions were numerically 
greater in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group. However, only the difference between 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin and saxagliptin + metformin was statistically significant, 
suggesting that adding dapagliflozin has more effect on 120-minute PPG than adding saxagliptin. 
FPG 
Reductions in FPG were seen in all dapagliflozin-treated groups. Numerically, these decreases were 
largest in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin +metformin groups, but the differences with dapagliflozin + 
metformin treated groups were not statistically significant. Significance was reached for the 
comparison between saxagliptin + dapagliflozin +metformin and saxagliptin + metformin groups. For 
FPG too, results suggest that dapagliflozin has more effect than saxagliptin. 
Responders 
In study CV181169, treatment with saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin resulted in 41% 
responders (HbA1c < 7%) after 24 weeks, compared to 18% for the saxagliptin + metformin group 
and 22% for the dapagliflozin + metformin group. In the sequential add-on study percentage 
responders after the OL treatment period was 22% for the dapagliflozin + metformin group. Adding 
saxagliptin in the 24 week treatment period resulted in an increase in responders (35%) that was 
larger than in the placebo group (23%).  
Body weight 
Treatment with saxagliptin was weight neutral. 
Subgroups 
The total number of elderly patients is limited in the three trials, and especially the number of subjects 
of 75 years and above: total number of 9. 
In female subjects < 50 year, saxagliptin was virtually ineffective. Although the numbers of females 
< 50 was limited, the contrast with older females and males is large. Reduction in HbA1c was only 
-0.13 in the younger female group in study CV181169, and there was no statistical significant 
difference between the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group vs dapagliflozin + metformin 
group, suggesting that the effect in the triple therapy group was due to the addition of dapagliflozin 
and not by saxagliptin. In Study MB102129, HbA1c increased in females < 50 years treated with 
saxagliptin + metformin.  The Applicant has conducted a number of exploratory analyses to investigate 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/291920/2017 
Page 28/43 
 
  
  
if evidence exists for a smaller treatment effect in younger females. There were no indications that 
baseline characteristics C-peptide, T2DM duration, BMI, FPG, PPG, and eGFR could explain the 
difference in study CV181169. Individual effects in younger females showed large variability. An 
analysis of 10 pooled studies did not reveal a treatment-by-female age for saxagliptin 5 mg. However, 
for saxagliptin 2.5 mg, the possibility of female age interaction cannot be excluded. But the clinical 
consequences, if any, are limited. 
Long-term results 
Results of the 52-week ST + LT treatment period of Study CV181168 indicate that glucose control was 
sustained at week 52. At week 52 change from baseline in HbA1c in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + 
metformin was -0.38% (compared to -0.51 at week 24); in the dapagliflozin + metformin group 
change was +0.05 (compared to -0.16 at week 24). Mean treatment difference at week 52 was -
0.42% (compared to -0.35% at week 24).  
Similar results were seen for percentage responders: a slight decrease in percentage responders was 
observed at week 52 compared to week 24 (from 35.3% to 29.3% in the saxa + dapa + met group, 
and from 23.1% to 13.1% in the dapa + met group), but the difference between treatment groups 
was sustained (12.2% at week 24 and 16.2% at week 52). 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Studies indicate that adding saxagliptin to metformin and dapagliflozin in subjects insufficiently 
controlled by these treatments can result in improved glycaemic control, although the additional 
effects are modest. Nevertheless, there might be patients who can benefit from this combination. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Saxagliptin was approved as Onglyza for marketing in the European Union (EU) via the Centralised 
Procedure on 01 October 2009 and has now been approved in more than 90 countries. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials reported in ≥5% of 
patients treated with Onglyza 5 mg and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are 
upper respiratory tract infection (7.7%), urinary tract infection (6.8%) and headache (6.5%). 
The safety and tolerability of the combined use of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin is based on 3 Phase 3 
studies (CV181168, CV181169, and MB102129) and a Phase 1 study (CV181191) conducted in the 
clinical development programme. For the purpose of summarising the safety experience, the safety 
data from the 3 Phase 3 studies (ie, 52-week ST + LT treatment period in Studies CV181168 and 
MB102129 and 24-week ST treatment period in Study CV181169) were pooled. The integrated safety 
population is referenced as the ST + LT Pool. The rationale for pooling the safety data from the 3 
Phase 3 studies is based on the overall similarity in their study design, and the availability of a larger 
subject population that is sufficient to establish the safety profile of the combined use of saxagliptin 
and dapagliflozin. The pooled population included all randomised and treated subjects from the 3 
studies. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 1169 subjects were included in the safety analysis population of the ST + LT Pool. Of these, 
492 received saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin, 336 received saxagliptin + metformin, and 341 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/291920/2017 
Page 29/43 
 
  
  
received dapagliflozin + metformin. The median exposure to study treatment was 359 days in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group and approximately 176 days each in the saxagliptin + 
metformin and the dapagliflozin + metformin group. The median exposure to study treatment in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group was nearly double that of the saxagliptin + metformin 
and dapagliflozin + metformin groups. This difference is due to the duration of Studies CV181168 and 
MB102129 in the ST + LT Pool that included a 28-week LT extension period. All 3 studies had a 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin treatment arm. The saxagliptin + metformin and dapagliflozin 
+ metformin groups were each included in only 2 studies, with 1 study each having a LT extension 
with the respective treatment arm. This results in the longer median exposure in the saxagliptin + 
dapagliflozin + metformin group. Because of this imbalance in exposure time among the groups in the 
ST + LT Pool, there are additional tables which adjust for exposure to allow for cross comparison of 
incidence rates for AEs.  
At least 235 subjects in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group received saxagliptin and 
dapagliflozin for >360 days. 
Adverse events  
Adverse events reported in the ST + LT Pool are summarised in Table 10.  
Of the 1169 subjects in the Integrated ST Pool, 670 reported at least 1 AE. The proportion of subjects 
who reported at least 1 AE was 282 subjects (57.3%) in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin 
group, 207 subjects (61.6%) in the saxagliptin + metformin group, and 181 subjects (53.1%) in the 
dapagliflozin + metformin group. There were no differences in hypoglycaemia, SAEs, related AEs or 
SAEs. There were two deaths during the studies (in the saxa + dapa + met group and in the dapa + 
met group). 
Overall, no new safety findings were identified in any treatment group, and the combined use of 
saxagliptin and dapagliflozin was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual agents.

Common adverse events 
Common AEs (reported in ≥2.0% of subjects in any treatment group) in the ST + LT Pool are 
summarised by PT in Table 11. 
The most common AEs by preferred term (PT) in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin 
treatment group were urinary tract infection (UTI) (5.5%), headache (4.3%), and nasopharyngitis 
(4.3%). The most common AEs by PT in the saxagliptin + metformin treatment group were UTI 
(7.1%), influenza (5.7%), and headache (5.4%). The most common AEs by PT in the dapagliflozin + 
metformin treatment group were UTI (5.3%), nasopharyngitis (4.4%), and headache (4.1%). Taken 
together, the common AE profile observed with the combined use of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin in 
the ST + LT Pool is consistent with the established safety profiles of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin when 
used individually.

Serious adverse event/deaths/discontinuations due to adverse events 
Deaths 
Two subject deaths were reported in the ST + LT Pool: 1 subject in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + 
metformin group (Study MB102129) died of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and acute heart failure; 
and 1 subject in the dapagliflozin + metformin group (Study CV181168) died of MI. Both of these 
deaths were considered by the Investigator to not be related to study treatment. 
In Study CV181168, 1 subject died prior to receiving study treatment (rectal adenocarcinoma), and 1 
subject died during the OL treatment period (dapagliflozin + metformin)( pulmonary embolism). In 
Study CV181169, 1 subject died 6 months after the final treatment and post database lock (gastric 
neoplasm).  
Serious adverse events 
Overall, the incidence of SAEs was low and balanced across the 3 treatment groups. A total of 39 
subjects experienced at least 1 SAE: 16 subjects (3.3%) in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin 
group, 10 subjects (3.0%) in the saxagliptin + metformin group, and 13 subjects (3.8%) in the 
dapagliflozin + metformin group. In the saxagliptin +dapagliflozin + metformin group, 2 SAEs were 
considered by the Investigator to be related to the study treatment: pyelonephritis in Study CV181168 
and thrombocytopaenia in Study MB102129. In the saxagliptin + metformin group, 1 SAE was 
considered treatment-elated by the Investigator: hyperkalaemia in Study CV181169. 
Eight subjects discontinued study treatment due to an SAE: 5 subjects  (1.0%) in the saxagliptin + 
dapagliflozin + metformin group (pyelonephritis, cardiac failure, thrombocytopenia, unstable angina 
and invasive ductal breast carcinoma, respectively), 2 subjects (0.6%) in the saxagliptin + metformin 
group (ankle fracture and gangrene, respectively), and 1 subject (0.3%) in the dapagliflozin + 
metformin group (MI). 
Discontinuations due to adverse events 
A total of 22 subjects discontinued the study treatment due to an AE: 13 subjects (2.6%) in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group, 3 subjects (0.9%) in the saxagliptin + metformin 
group, and 6 subjects (1.8%) in the dapagliflozin + metformin group. Subjects who discontinued the 
study treatment due to an AE were numerically greater in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin 
group; however, PTs of the AE that led to discontinuation were dispersed across various SOCs in this 
group and did not occur in more than 2 subjects. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Hypoglycaemia 
Overall, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was low (≤1.8% in any treatment group). Hypoglycaemia 
events, excluding data after rescue, were reported in a total of 14 subjects: 7 subjects (1.4%) in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group, 1 subject (0.3%) in the saxagliptin + metformin group, 
and 6 subjects (1.8%) in the dapagliflozin + metformin group. None of the reported hypoglycaemia 
events was a major episode of hypoglycaemia, and no subject discontinued the study treatment due to 
hypoglycaemia. Confirmed hypoglycaemia, defined as fingerstick glucose value ≤50 mg/dL with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/291920/2017 
Page 32/43 
 
  
  
associated symptoms, was reported in 1 subject in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group  
The event was considered a minor episode. 
Renal impairment/failure 
In the ST + LT Pool, the incidence of AEs of renal impairment/failure was balanced, with an AE of renal 
impairment/failure reported in 18 subjects: 10 (2.0%) in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin 
group, 6 (1.8%) in the saxagliptin + metformin group, and 2 (0.6%) in the dapagliflozin + metformin 
group. These included AEs of the PT GFR decrease, renal impairment, renal failure, renal failure acute,  
renal failure chronic, blood creatinine increased, urine output decreased. None of the subjects had a 
serious AE of renal impairment. Five subjects (3 subjects in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + 
metformin group and 2 subjects in the dapagliflozin + metformin group) discontinued study treatment 
due to an AE of renal impairment/failure. Four of the 5 subjects discontinued study treatment due to a 
decrease in GFR, which was below protocol-specified criteria. 
Infections 
In the ST + LT Pool, the incidence of AEs of the SOC Infections and infestations was generally balanced 
across the 3 treatment groups, with at least 1 AE reported in 130 subjects (26.4%) in the saxagliptin 
+ dapagliflozin + metformin group, 102 subjects (30.1%) in the saxagliptin + metformin group, and 
100 subjects (29.3%) in the dapagliflozin + metformin group. The most common PTs in the SOC were 
UTIs, nasopharyngitis, and influenza. This was consistent across the treatment groups and across the 
safety profile for the mono-components. 
Genital infections were reported in 38 subjects. The proportion of subjects who reported an AE of 
genital infection in the ST + LT Pool was higher in the 2 dapagliflozin-containing treatment groups: 15 
(3.0%) subjects in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group and 20 (5.9%) subjects in the 
dapagliflozin + metformin group compared to 3 (0.9%) subjects in the saxagliptin + metformin group. 
UTI was the most commonly reported AE in the ST + LT Pool. UTIs were balanced across the 3 
treatment groups (72 subjects total): 28 subjects (5.7%) in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + 
metformin group, 25 subjects (7.4%) in the saxagliptin + metformin group, and 19 subjects (5.6%) in 
the dapagliflozin + metformin group. More females in each treatment group reported PTs of UTI 
compared to males (8.3% vs 2.6% in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group, 12.0% vs 
2.9% in the saxagliptin + metformin group, and 9.1% vs 1.8% in the dapagliflozin + metformin group, 
respectively). 
Malignancies 
Six subjects in the Integrated ST Pool reported AEs in the SOC Neoplasms benign, malignant, and 
unspecified (including cysts and polyps): 4 (0.8%) subjects in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + 
metformin group, 1 (0.3%) subject in the saxagliptin + metformin group, and 1 (0.3%) subject in the 
dapagliflozin + metformin group. Of these 6 subjects, 3 subjects in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + 
metformin group had events that were reported as SAEs: gastric neoplasm, hepatic cancer, and 
invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Considering the short latency between first drug exposure and 
tumour diagnosis, a causal relationship to any specific tumour type is considered unlikely. 
The malignancies that are defined as AEoSI in the saxagliptin/dapagliflozin FDC clinical programme 
include bladder neoplasm, breast neoplasm, and pancreatic cancer. No case of bladder neoplasm was 
reported in the Integrated ST Pool. One case of invasive ductal breast carcinoma was reported in 1 
subject in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group. No AE of the PT pancreatic cancer was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/291920/2017 
Page 33/43 
 
  
  
reported in the Integrated ST Pool; however, the malignancy of hepatic cancer reported at Week 16 in 
1 subject in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group during the double-blind treatment 
period was, upon adjudication, determined to be pancreatic cancer that metastasised to the liver. 
Fractures 
AEs of fractures were reported in a total of 9 subjects: 3 subject (0.6%) in the saxagliptin + 
dapagliflozin + metformin group, 4 subjects (1.2%) in the saxagliptin + metformin group, and 2 
subjects (0.6%) in the dapagliflozin + metformin group. 
Cardiovascular events and Cardiac Failure 
CV events that were adjudicated and confirmed as CV events were reported in a total of 10 subjects: 5 
subjects (1.0%) in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group, 2 subjects (0.6%) in the 
saxagliptin + metformin group, and 3 subjects (0.9%) in the dapagliflozin + metformin group. 
AEs suggestive of heart failure were reported in a total of 18 subjects: 6 subjects (1.2%) in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group, 8 subjects (2.4%) in the saxagliptin + metformin 
group, and 4 subjects (1.2%) in the dapagliflozin + metformin group. Two subjects in the saxagliptin 
+ dapagliflozin + metformin group discontinued study treatment due to SAEs. One subject 
discontinued due to a SAE of cardiac failure. The other subject died due to SAEs of acute MI and 
cardiac failure acute. A subject  in the dapagliflozin + metformin group discontinued from study 
treatment; this subject had non-serious AEs of cardiac failure and hepatocellular injury, but 
discontinued due to ascites. 
Other AEs of special interest 
There were no unexpected findings for lymphocyte/thrombocyte counts, pancreatitis, severe cutaneous 
adverse events, hypersensitivity, hepatic events and volume depletion. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology values and blood chemistry values were generally within the normal range throughout 
the treatment period. 
Small mean increases from baseline in haemoglobin, haematocrit, and platelet count were seen in the 
dapagliflozin-containing treatment groups for these analytes, consistent with the dapagliflozin clinical 
programme. 
Clinical chemistry values generally remained within the normal range. Small mean increases from 
baseline in creatinine were observed in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin and dapagliflozin + 
metformin groups. These changes started at Week 6 and shifted towards baseline by Week 52. There 
were also small decreases in eGFR observed across the treatment groups. There were no clinically 
meaningful changes from baseline in electrolytes, creatine kinase (CK), and total protein. 
Mean values in hepatic laboratory values in the ST + LT Pool were small, stable, consistent over time, 
and generally stayed within normal range.  
Microscopic haematuria was reported in similar proportion of subjects across the 3 treatment groups: 
7.5%, 6.1%, and 7.9% of subjects in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin, saxagliptin + 
metformin, and dapagliflozin + metformin groups, respectively. Across all treatment groups, mean 
baseline values of the albumin/creatinine ratio were consistently above normal (>30 mg/g) through 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/291920/2017 
Page 34/43 
 
  
  
Week 52. Generally, there was a slight decrease in mean change from baseline over time in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin treatment group, an increase in the saxagliptin + metformin 
group, and a slight increase in the dapagliflozin + metformin group. The mean changes over time in 
these parameters were not considered to be clinically relevant. 
The frequency of Marked Abnormalities (MAs) in laboratory test results in the ST + LT Pool was 
generally low and similar across the 3 treatment groups. 
Marked abnormalities (elevations) in CK were observed in a higher proportion of subjects in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group (7 subjects) compared with the saxagliptin + metformin 
(no subject) and dapagliflozin + metformin (1 subject) groups. These elevations were transient in 
nature, with levels normalising to baseline values within an average of 2 weeks, while subjects 
continued on treatment without interruption (except for 1 subject). None of the subjects had study 
treatment permanently discontinued due to CK elevation. In most subjects (7 of 8), the CK elevation 
was asymptomatic and observed at a single time point (isolated finding). Only 1 subject had an 
associated AE of myalgia, which was related to increased physical activity. None of the subjects had 
associated changes in renal function or CV events. Most subjects (7 of 8) had alternative plausible 
explanations, including concomitant use of medications known to elevate CK levels (eg. statins or 
fibrates), increased physical activity, syncope with possible fall, CK elevations observed prior to 
randomisation, and acute illness. Overall, review of the data revealed that most of the CK increases 
were asymptomatic, resolved without interruption of medication and had alternative plausible 
explanations suggesting that a causal relationship with saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin 
treatment is unlikely. 
Consistent with its mild diuretic effect, dapagliflozin-containing treatments were associated with larger 
decreases from baseline in systolic and diastolic BP; these small effects on BP were consistent over 
time. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses of AEs were performed for age, gender, and race. 
Age 
Of the 1169 subjects in the Integrated ST Pool, 1007 subjects (86.1%) were aged <65 years, 162 
subjects (13.9%) were aged ≥65 years, and 9 subjects (0.8%) were aged ≥75 years. The distribution 
of subjects by age was balanced across the treatment groups. No clinically meaningful difference in the 
AE incidence was observed in the age subgroup <65 years and ≥65 years. There were too few subjects 
(0.8%) in the ≥75 year age group to evaluate the AE reporting in this group. The proportion of 
subjects who had AEs of SOC cardiac disorders was higher in the age category ≥ 65 years (8.0%, 13 
out of 162 subjects) when compared with that in age category <65 years (2.2%, 22 out of 1007 
subjects). However, within the age category ≥ 65 years, the proportion of subjects who had AEs of 
cardiac disorders was comparable across the 3 treatment groups (6.3% in the saxagliptin + 
dapagliflozin + metformin group, 8.9% in the saxagliptin + metformin group, and 9.3% in the 
dapagliflozin + metformin group. 
Gender 
There were 563 males and 606 females in the ST + LT Pool. Overall, a slightly higher proportion of 
female subjects reported AEs as compared with males. In males, 125 (54.8%) subjects in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group, 93 (54.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin + metformin 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/291920/2017 
Page 35/43 
 
  
  
group and 83 (50.3%) subjects in the dapagliflozin + metformin group reported an AE. In females 157 
(59.5%) subjects in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group, 114 (68.7%) subjects in the 
saxagliptin + metformin group and 98 (55.7%) subjects in the dapagliflozin + metformin group 
reported an AE. The increased proportion of females reporting AEs is in part because of an increased 
frequency of UTI and vulvovaginal mycotic infection in the female subgroup. For both females and 
males, the most frequently reported AEs were in the SOC Infections and infestations. 
Race 
The majority of subjects in the  ST + LT Pool were White (946 subjects, 80.9%); 98 subjects were 
black.. The most common AEs were similar in both the White and Black subgroups and were consistent 
with the overall AEs in the ST + LT Pool. Because of the low numbers of subjects who were of Asian 
(48) or Other racial origin (77), no conclusions could be drawn based on an analysis of AEs. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between saxagliptin and dapagliflozin was evaluated in 
healthy subjects in Study CV181191. The coadministration of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin did not 
affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug and that of the active metabolite (5-hydroxy saxagliptin). 
No dose adjustment of either saxagliptin or dapagliflozin is needed when the 2 drugs are 
coadministered. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 22 subjects discontinued the study treatment due to an AE: 13 subjects (2.6%) in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group, 3 subjects (0.9%) in the saxagliptin + metformin 
group, and 6 subjects (1.8%) in the dapagliflozin + metformin group. Subjects who discontinued the 
study treatment due to an AE were numerically greater in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin 
group; however, PTs of the AE that led to discontinuation were dispersed across various SOCs in this 
group and did not occur in more than 2 subjects. 
Phase 1 safety experience 
A total of 42 healthy volunteers were dosed in this study. All treatments were well tolerated. There 
were no deaths, SAEs, or DAEs. A total of 16 subjects (38.1%) reported at least 1 AE; of these, 10 
subjects (23.8%) reported an AE that was considered by the Investigator to be related to the study 
treatment. All AEs were reported as mild; and headache was the most commonly reported AE (6 of 42 
subjects). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
For the purpose of summarising the safety experience, the safety data from the 3 Phase 3 studies (ie, 
52-week ST + LT treatment period in Studies CV181168 and MB102129 and 24-week ST treatment 
period in Study CV181169) were pooled. The rationale for pooling the safety data from the 3 Phase 3 
studies is based on the overall similarity in their study design, and the availability of a larger subject 
population that is sufficient to establish the safety profile of the combined use of saxagliptin and 
dapagliflozin. The pooled population included all randomised and treated subjects from the 3 studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/291920/2017 
Page 36/43 
 
  
  
A total of 1169 subjects were included in the safety analysis population of the ST + LT Pool. Of these, 
492 received saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin, 336 received saxagliptin + metformin, and 341 
received dapagliflozin + metformin.  The median exposure to study treatment was 359 days in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group and approximately 176 days each in the saxagliptin + 
metformin and the dapagliflozin + metformin group. The median exposure to study treatment in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group was nearly double that of the saxagliptin + metformin 
and dapagliflozin + metformin groups, because triple therapy was included in both LT extensions, while 
dual therapy was only included in one of the LT extensions. 
Numerically more patients in the saxagliptin + metformin group (61.6%) reported at least 1 AE 
compared to the dapagliflozin + metformin group (53.1%) and the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + 
metformin group (57.3%). The difference consisted primarily in slight differences in percentage of 
infections and headache. The triple combination was not associated with more AEs. No new safety 
concerns were noted.  
There were no remarkable differences between groups in serious adverse events. Also, incidence of 
subjects who discontinued study treatment due to an AE was low. 
The incidence of hypoglycaemia events was low. Numerically, there were more events of 
hypoglycaemia in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group and dapagliflozin + metformin 
group as compared to the saxagliptin + metformin group. This is to be expected, as glucose control 
with saxagliptin + metformin was less than that with the other two groups. 
With regard to adverse events of special interest, there were also no differences between treatment 
groups, and there were no unexpected findings. Especially, no differences were seen in incidence of 
cardiovascular events and heart failure events. Overall, numbers were small, and studies were not 
powered to detect differences in these AEs. 
The Applicant performed a number of subgroup analyses. With respect to age, it should be remarked 
that the number of elderly subjects (>65 years) was limited: 162. Especially, the number of subjects 
>75 was low: only 9, thus limiting the extent of the analysis. For subjects > 65 years, compared to 
subjects < 65 years, no unexpected findings were observed. The older age group experienced some 
more SAEs and events in the category of accidents and injuries, Anticholinergic syndrome, and Cardiac 
disorders. These are not unexpected. 
Female subjects experienced more AEs than males, especially UTIs and vulvovaginal mycotic 
infections. 
No efficacy/safety trials were executed in special populations.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
As expected, specific side effects related to the monocomponents, such as UTI for dapagliflozin and GI 
events for saxagliptin may occur when the two products are given together, but in general the 
combination was tolerated reasonably well. 
The number of elderly subjects, and especially subjects >75 years was limited in the three studies. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

2.6.  Risk management plan 
For this procedure, no new safety concerns have been identified and updated RMPs for Onglyza and 
Komboglyze were not submitted and therefore not assessed.  
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Saxagliptin (Onglyza) is a DPP4-inhibitor, used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
The MAH seeks to extend the indication for saxagliptin with triple therapy with metformin plus 
dapagliflozin, when metformin together with dapagliflozin plus diet and exercise, does not provide 
adequate glycaemic control. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are several classes of medicinal products for the treatment of T2DM, with different mechanism 
of action. All products have been shown to reduce blood glucose level, and to improve HbA1c. 
Combination treatment is a generally accepted therapy to improve glycaemic control in subjects failing 
on one or more treatments. 
Based on the extensive therapeutic experience including a well-understood safety profile, metformin is 
currently recommended as first-line treatment for all patients with T2DM, unless contraindications 
apply (most notably, GFR < 30 ml/min). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The application is supported by data from three clinical trials (CV181168, CV181169, and MB102129). 
These trials were previously submitted in support of the QTERN (saxagliptin/dapagliflozin) marketing 
application (procedure number EMEA/H/C/004057, CHMP positive opinion dated 26 May 2016). 
Supportive safety information is presented from the ST + LT Pool (pooled data from Study CV181169) 
and the ST + LT treatment periods (from Studies CV181168 and MB102129). 
Study CV181169 was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, 24-
week Phase 3 trial in 534 subjects designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy (primary endpoint: 
mean change from baseline in HbA1c) of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin added concurrently to metformin 
compared with dapagliflozin added to metformin and saxagliptin added to metformin in subjects with 
T2DM with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin alone. The study consisted of a screening 
period, followed by a lead-in period (4-weeks), and then a 24-week double-blind treatment period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/291920/2017 
Page 38/43 
 
  
  
 
Study CV181168 and Study MB102129 were multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group, 24-week Phase 3 trials in 315 and 320 subjects, respectively, designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy (primary endpoint: mean change from baseline in HbA1c) of the 
sequential addition of saxagliptin to dapagliflozin and metformin  (CV118168) or dapagliflozin to 
saxagliptin and metformin  (MB102129) compared with the addition of placebo in subjects with T2DM 
with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and dapagliflozin or saxagliptin. The studies had a 
screening period, followed by an OL treatment period (16 weeks), and then a 24-week double blind 
treatment period. Eligible subjects could enter the long-term (LT) extension for an additional 28 
weeks. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Repeated measures analysis of the primary endpoint demonstrated a clinically relevant effect of 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin treatment (added concomitantly or sequentially) in lowering 
HbA1c at Week 24 which was statistically significant versus the combination of dapagliflozin and 
metformin (studies CV181169 and CV181168). Difference versus dapagliflozin + metformin was -
0.27% in study CV181169 and -0.35% in study CV181168.  
Results of secondary endpoints were in line with the primary analysis, although not all comparisons 
reached statistical significance. In study CV181169, the proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c <7% 
at Week 24 was nearly 2-fold higher in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group (41.4%) 
compared with the dapagliflozin + metformin group (22.2%). The difference in responders depended 
on baseline HbA1c with the largest difference for subjects with baseline HbA1c of 8 – 9% (± 30%), 
and smallest for subjects with HbA1c <8% (7% vs saxagliptin + metformin) or >9% (9% vs 
dapagliflozin + metformin). 
In study CV181168, the proportions were 35.5% in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group 
and 23.1% in the dapagliflozin + metformin group. Treatment with saxagliptin was weight neutral. 
Effects on HbA1c were sustained at week 52. 
Incidence of hypoglycaemia was low. Numerically, there were more events of hypoglycaemia in the 
saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group and dapagliflozin + metformin group as compared to the 
saxagliptin + metformin group, but differences were small.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Only study CV181168 had the right design for the claimed indication, i.e. addition of saxagliptin to 
patients failing on dapagliflozin and metformin. In study CV181169, saxagliptin was added 
concomitantly with dapagliflozin to subjects inadequately controlled by metformin only. 
The number of elderly subjects (>65 years) was limited: 162. Number of subjects > 75 was only 9. 
Data from these subjects and data from the individual monocomponent clinical programmes in elderly 
patients are reassuring. 
Benefit in female subjects < 50 year was uncertain. In the studies saxagliptin showed very little effect 
in this patient group. Additional analyses did not reveal a treatment-by-female age interaction for 
saxagliptin 5 mg, but for saxagliptin 2.5 mg an interaction could not be excluded. 
In study CV181169, metformin XR tablets were used. These tablets are not registered in all EU 
countries. In the other two studies metformin IR tablets were used. Two thirds of subjects used 
metformin XR in a dose between 1700 and 2500 mg daily, and one third used 1500-1700 mg daily. 
Maximum recommended dose of metformin XR is 2000 mg, while maximum daily dose for metformin

IR is 2550 to 3000 mg. That is probably the reason why more patients in the two sequential studies 
used metformin in higher doses (above 2500 mg) as in these studies metformin IR was used. This 
makes a comparison between studies in terms of background therapy more complicated. 
Addition to other SGLT-2 inhibitors than dapagliflozin has not been studied. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
For the purpose of summarising the safety experience, the safety data from the 3 Phase 3 studies (ie, 
52-week ST + LT treatment period in Studies CV181168 and MB102129 and 24-week ST treatment 
period in Study CV181169) were pooled. A total of 1169 subjects were included in the safety analysis 
population of the ST + LT Pool. Of these, 492 received saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin, 336 
received saxagliptin + metformin, and 341 received dapagliflozin + metformin.  The median exposure 
to study treatment was 359 days in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group and 
approximately 176 days each in the saxagliptin + metformin and the dapagliflozin + metformin group. 
The median exposure to study treatment in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group was 
nearly double that of the saxagliptin + metformin and dapagliflozin + metformin groups, because triple 
therapy was included in both LT extensions, while dual therapy was only included in one of the LT 
extensions. 
Numerically more patients in the saxagliptin + metformin group (61.6%) reported at least 1 AE 
compared to the dapagliflozin + metformin group (53.1%) and the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + 
metformin group (57.3%). The difference consisted primarily in slight differences in percentage of 
infections and headache. The triple combination was not associated with more AEs. No new safety 
concerns were noted.  
There were no remarkable differences between groups in serious adverse events. Also, incidence of 
subjects who discontinued study treatment due to an AE was low. 
The incidence of hypoglycaemia events was low. Numerically, there were more events of 
hypoglycaemia in the saxagliptin + dapagliflozin + metformin group and dapagliflozin + metformin 
group as compared to the saxagliptin + metformin group. This is to be expected, as glucose control 
with saxagliptin + metformin was less than that with the other two groups. 
With regard to adverse events of special interest, there were also no differences between treatment 
groups, and there were no unexpected findings. Especially, no differences were seen in incidence of 
cardiovascular events and heart failure events. Overall, numbers were small, and studies were not 
powered to detect differences in these AEs. 
Female subjects experienced more AEs than males, especially UTIs and vulvovaginal mycotic 
infections. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The Applicant performed a number of subgroup analyses. With respect to age, it should be remarked 
that the number of elderly subjects (>65 years) was limited: 162. Especially, the number of subjects 
>75 was low: only 9, thus limiting the extent of the analysis. For subjects > 65 years, compared to 
subjects < 65 years, no unexpected findings were observed. The older age group experienced some 
more SAEs and events in the category of accidents and injuries, Anticholinergic syndrome, and Cardiac 
disorders. These are not unexpected. 
No efficacy/safety trials were executed in special populations.

3.6.  Benefit-Risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effect 
The most important effect is the reduction in HbA1c of around -0.30% when saxagliptin is added to 
dapagliflozin and metformin. This is just near the accepted delta for non-inferiority in clinical trials for 
diabetes. Apparently, the additional value of saxagliptin on top of dapagliflozin and metformin is small. 
However, as for Qtern, there might be patients who can benefit from the addition of saxagliptin. 
An important benefit is the low incidence of hypoglycaemia. Fear of hypoglycaemia might be an 
obstacle when trying to achieve good metabolic control, and therefore, a treatment with low risk for 
hypoglycaemia  has a clear benefit. 
Secondary endpoints were in line with the primary endpoint. 
In general, the combination treatment was well tolerated, and no unexpected safety issues were 
observed. 
Only study CV181168 had the right design for the claimed indication, i.e. addition of saxagliptin to 
patients failing on dapagliflozin and metformin. In study CV181169, saxagliptin was added 
concomitantly with dapagliflozin to subjects inadequately controlled by metformin only. However, this 
is considered less important, as the additive value of saxagliptin could be assessed.  
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Adding saxagliptin to patients failing on metformin and dapagliflozin can result in a modest 
improvement of glycaemic control. The additional risk for hypoglycaemia is low, and no new or 
unexpected safety issues have been observed. 
Therefore the benefit risk balance is considered positive. 
Since the initial authorisation of saxagliptin-containing products, the general wording of the indication 
for medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes has evolved, and in addition more data has been 
accumulated regarding the combined use of saxagliptin with other products for the treatment of 
diabetes representing the standard of care. Therefore, it was suggested to the MAH to amend the 
wording of the indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC to refer in more general terms to the combined 
use of saxagliptin and saxagliptin/metformin with other products for the treatment of diabetes, 
including insulin. Although this wording of the indication is relatively broad, the combinations studied 
are described in section 5.1 of the SmPC. The MAH agreed, and the following indications are proposed 
and accepted: 
Onglyza 
Onglyza is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to 
improve glycaemic control: 
• 
• 
as monotherapy when metformin is inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications 
in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, including insulin, when 
these do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data 
on different combinations).

Komboglyze 
Komboglyze is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to 
improve glycaemic control: 
• 
• 
• 
in patients inadequately controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone  
in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, including insulin, in 
patients inadequately controlled with metformin and these medicinal products (see sections 4.4, 
4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different combinations). 
in patients already being treated with the combination of saxagliptin and metformin as separate 
tablets.

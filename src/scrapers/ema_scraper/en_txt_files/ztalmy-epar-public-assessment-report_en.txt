for marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Ztalmy, through the 
centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 10 
December 2020. 
Ztalmy was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/19/2224 on 13 November 2019 in the 
following condition: Treatment of CDKL5 deficiency disorder. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated 
with cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 deficiency disorder (CDD) in patients 2 years of age and older. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0171/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0171/2021 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Ztalmy as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Ztalmy 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a developmental encephalopathy caused by pathogenic variants in 
the gene cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5). The clinical characteristics commonly associated with 
a CDKL5 mutation include early-onset medication-refractory seizures, severe intellectual and gross 
motor impairment, and severe sleep disturbances. Since 2013, CDD is characterised as a separate 
disorder, whereas before that time it was classified as an atypical variant of Rett Syndrome. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
CDD is a rare, genetically defined paediatric epilepsy with an estimated incidence of 1:40,000 to 
1:60,000 live births (Olson 2019; Demarest 2019). The disorder is more common in females than in 
males (ratio 4:1; Olson 2019). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The CDKL5 gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome and encodes a serine-threonine 
kinase essential for neuronal maturation and development (Jakimiec et al., 2020). CDKL5 is widely 
expressed in the brain. A wide variety of pathogenic variants in the CDKL5 gene have been reported, of 
which most are de novo mutations. In addition, cases of parental mosaicism have been reported 
(Orphanet). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The severity of CDD is variable, although most children experience treatment-resistant seizures and 
severe neurodevelopmental impairment. Patients may experience one or more of several different 
seizure types, including tonic-clonic, atonic, clonic, tonic, myoclonic, absence, and focal seizures, as 
well as infantile spasms (IS) (Kilstrup-Nielsen et al., 2012). Three stages of seizures in the course of 
CDD have been proposed: Stage I, early-onset epilepsy (onset 1 to 10 weeks); Stage II, epileptic 
encephalopathy with IS and hypsarrhythmia; Stage III, tonic seizures with myoclonia and variable 
level of control with ASMs (Bahi-Buisson et al., 2008). Frequent myoclonic jerks are a key component 
of epileptic manifestations at this later stage. Some patients show a peculiar seizure pattern with 
prolonged generalized tonic-clonic events lasting 2 to 4 minutes gradually transitioning to repetitive, 
distal myoclonic jerks.  
Other neurologic manifestations include deficits in speech or language, limited or complete loss of 
functional hand use, stereotypies, hypotonia, cortical blindness, autistic features, and sleep 
disturbances. Children may also have dysautonomia, impaired swallowing, or constipation. 
The overall life-expectancy for a CDD patient is likely shorter than for age-matched healthy individuals. 
Due to the rarity of CDD, little is known about long-term prognosis and life expectancy. Most 
individuals who have been identified with this condition are under 18 years of age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 13/132 
 
 
 
 
2.1.5.  Management 
There are currently no treatments approved specifically for seizures associated with CDD. Seizures in 
CDD are treated with anti-seizure medications, corticosteroids, a ketogenic diet, vagal nerve 
stimulation and neurosurgery.  
2.2.  About the product 
Ganaxolone (GNX) is a methyl-substituted analogue of the endogenous neurosteroid allopregnanolone, 
a derivative of progesterone. The structure of GNX is identical to allopregnanolone, with a methyl 
substitution at the 3β position. This structural modification prevents back-conversion to intermediates 
active at steroid receptors and increases GNX bioavailability (Lyden et al., 2000). 
GNX elicits its anti-seizure effects by targeting allosteric sites of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A 
(GABAA) receptor to positively modulate and enhance the function of both synaptic and extrasynaptic 
GABAA receptors.  
The sought indication for Ztalmy (GNX) was for the adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures 
associated with CDD in patients 2 years of age and older.  
Ztalmy is an oral solution and should be titrated gradually to achieve the recommended daily dose 
based on clinical response and tolerability. It is given 3 times per day. In patients weighing ≤ 28 kg, 
the recommended daily dose is 63 mg/kg/day. In patients weighing > 28 kg, the recommended daily 
dose is 1800 mg/day. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on: 
-  Seizures in CDD are abundant and serious  
-  The efficacy of the existing anti-epileptic treatment options in seizures in CDD is modest 
-  Ganaxolone could be a welcome addition to the existing arsenal of treatment options for seizures in 
CDD, based on the effect of ganaxolone on seizures in CDD observed in the global Phase 3, 
randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind (DB) study 1042-CDD-3001, which appears larger than 
usually seen with ASMs.   
-  The safety of ganaxolone appears acceptable 
However, during assessment, a number of Major Concerns had to be addressed and it was no longer 
appropriate to pursue the accelerated assessment. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

2.4.2.  Active substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The chemical name of ganaxolone is 1-[(3R, 5S, 8R, 9S, 10S, 13S, 14S, 17S)-3-hydroxy-3, 10, 13-
trimethyl-1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17-tetradecahydrocyclopenta[a]phenanthren-17-
yl]ethenone corresponding to the molecular formula C22H36O2. It has a relative molecular mass of 
332.53 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of ganaxolone was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, 
ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV), infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(NMR), mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. The solid-state properties were investigated by 
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). 
The active substance is a crystalline white to off-white powder, which is non-hygroscopic and 
practically insoluble in water. Ganaxolone exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 8 chiral 
centres. Ganaxolone has a steroid core structure and derives its absolute configuration from the 
starting material which is synthesised using established procedures. The downstream diastereomeric 
impurities from epimerization are routinely controlled in the active substance specification as specified 
impurities. In addition, the correct enantiomer of the active substance is routinely confirmed by optical 
rotation. 
The polymorphic nature of ganaxolone was investigated in detail. Only a single crystalline form, Form 
A, was identified under all studied conditions. 
The risk of presence of elemental impurities was evaluated in line with ICH Q3D. Based on the risk 
assessment provided, it is acceptable that only Palladium is routinely controlled in the active substance 
specification.

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured by one manufacturing site. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. The ASMF holder is the single supplier of the 
active substance.  
Ganaxolone is synthesised in two main steps using a well-defined starting material with an acceptable 
specification. 
Particle size is controlled in the specification of the active substance. 
During the procedure, a Major Objection was raised in relation to the designation of the starting 
material. In response, further justification regarding the designation and the control strategy were 
presented. The responses were satisfactory and resolved the Major Objection. The starting material is 
acceptable. 
During the procedure, a further Major Objection was raised in relation to the control of a potentially 
genotoxic impurity which is used in the last step of the manufacturing process of the starting material. 
In response, control of the impurity was added to the active substance starting material specification 
with a suitable limit. The limit is supported by results of spiking experiments. Responses were sufficient 
to resolve the Major Objection. The starting material specification is acceptable. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, the starting material and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags which are then 
placed in a HDPE drum. The primary packaging material complies with EU 10/2011 and Ph. Eur. 3.1.3. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (FT-IR, HPLC), melting range 
(Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), purity (HPLC), residual solvents (GC headspace), specific rotation (Ph. Eur.), 
water content (KF), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), particle size (laser diffraction), elemental impurities 
(ICP-MS), and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.).  
The proposed specification is acceptable and in line with ICH Q6A requirements. The particle size limit 
is acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for six batches representative of the proposed commercial process and six process 
validation batches are provided. In addition, batch data was also provided for earlier batches 
manufactured during development. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch 
to batch. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 16/132 
 
 
 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from 9 batches (including four registration batches and three process validation batches) 
of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in a container closure system 
representative of that intended for the market for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25°C / 
60% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The following parameters were tested: appearance, crystallinity, assay, 
purity, water content, microbial enumeration and bacterial endotoxins. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications and no significant trends were observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Photostability was 
studied in solution as well as in the solid state and the active substance is classified as light sensitive. 
Forced degradation studies were also carried out in both solid and solution phase demonstrating the 
stability-indicating nature of the analytical methods. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months without special 
temperature storage conditions. The container adequately protects the active substance from light. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Ztalmy 50 mg/ml is a white to off-white suspension for oral use. Each bottle contains 110 ml of 
suspension.  
Pharmaceutical development focused on obtaining a product suitable for the target population 
(indication: treatment of rare paediatric epilepsies). The quality target product profile (QTPP) for the 
finished product was defined and CQAs were also defined following a question during the procedure 
(CQAs: appearance, identification, assay, related substance, preservative assay, re-suspendability, 
uniformity of dosage units, pH, particle size distribution, dissolution, deliverable volume, viscosity, 
preservative effectiveness/microbial tests, weight loss, elemental impurities, nitrosamines and residual 
solvents).  
The active substance ganaxolone is practically insoluble in water and therefore the main challenge in 
product development was to obtain an adequate dissolution profile. A high surface area facilitates 
dissolution in the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration. 
The selection of excipients, including functions and rationale for quantities, is described. Excipients 
were selected based on experience from previous products. Sodium laurilsulfate is used to stabilise the 
formation of the active substance particles and hypromellose is used to stabilise the active substance 
particles formed during the process and to stabilize the diluted drug product. All excipients are well 
known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, except for 
artificial cherry flavour, which complies with in-house standards and the 30% simethicone emulsion, 
which complies with USP. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The 
list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this report. The 
safety of the selected excipients in view of use in the paediatric population and acceptability/ 
palatability issues have been sufficiently addressed and justified. During the procedure, a Major 
Objection was raised on the content of preservatives and in particular, the use of sodium benzoate and 
benzyl alcohol, which is a component of artificial cherry flavour. The applicant provided satisfactory 
responses to resolve the Major Objection. As the level of the preservatives is safe and acceptable for 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 17/132 
 
 
 
the target population, the formulation is accepted with a commitment by the applicant to developing a 
sodium benzoate free formulation (see recommendations). Development work has already started 
(refer to PIP EMEA-002341-PIP01-18-M01).  
Excipient compatibility studies were not conducted during development, however no physical or 
chemical incompatibilities were observed on assessment of available stability data for clinical batches. 
29 finished product batches have been manufactured using different batches of each excipient and 19 
batches of active substance. The specifications were met in all cases. The information provided is 
sufficient. 
Compatibility of the product with commonly used food and beverages and enteral feeding tubes is 
being investigated, however the results are not available yet (see recommendations). The applicant 
committed to investigating these issues further and this is acceptable. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. A short 
overview of the early formulations used in clinical studies is provided. The relevant clinical studies 
relevant for this Marketing Authorisation Application have all been performed with the same 
formulation as proposed for commercial use.  
Formulation development is described with a focus on the development of a suitable milling process. 
The relevant physico-chemical characteristics have been identified (particle size distribution, 
dissolution, re-suspendability, viscosity, foam formation) and are adequately discussed. The test 
methods and limits for these characteristics have been justified. The specification limits for particle size 
distribution are acceptable in view of the available results for batches obtained by the milling process 
and equipment intended for the commercial manufacturing both at release and during stability studies. 
The proposed shaking procedure for administration of the suspension is acceptable but will be re-
evaluated or adjusted, if needed based on ongoing re-suspendability experiments with shorter 
shaking/standing times. This work will be completed post-approval (see recommendations). 
The development of the dissolution method is described. The solubility of ganaxolone in different media 
with varying concentrations of surfactants has been investigated and the medium with the lowest 
possible concentration of surfactant capable to achieve dissolution has been selected. The selection of 
the dissolution method conditions is adequately discussed and justified. The dissolution method for 
release testing uses a compendial apparatus. The impact of deviations in manufacturing or the 
composition were studied. Qualitative changes in formulation did not result in significant differences in 
dissolution profiles. Based on the results of the tests and considering the solubility of the active 
substance, the discriminatory power of the method is adequately demonstrated. 
The manufacturing process development is discussed, with a focus on the milling and dilution steps. 
Although the batches obtained show difference, especially upon storage, they have both been used 
alongside each other in clinical studies and no significant difference in vivo was observed. The studies 
performed to select the process parameters of the milling step have been adequately described. The 
critical process parameters are media load, chiller set point and agitator speed. Control of these 
parameters is critical in order to control the suspension, which has to be limited to avoid precipitation 
of an excipient. The critical process parameters have been studied by testing combinations of 
investigated settings. Manufactured batches have also been tested after storage at long term and 
accelerated conditions up to 6 months. The results confirm that the parameters ranges selected are all 
suitable and that the process is adequately controlled by monitoring of outlet temperature and particle 
size distribution. The suitability of the proposed administration devices has been confirmed in terms of 
accuracy of dosing, microbial contamination, readability of the graduation and syringeability 
throughout the proposed period of use. The selected 3 ml and 12 ml syringes are considered adequate 
for the intended dosing regimen (see also chapter on stability for further details). 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023

To confirm the suitability of the primary packaging, a leachables simulation study was conducted where 
the finished product in the proposed commercial container closure system was aged. Results confirmed 
that leachables at significant levels are not expected in the finished product in normal use. 
The primary packaging is a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a polypropylene (PP) child 
resistant (CR) cap lined with an induction foil. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  Dosing syringes of 3 ml and 12 ml are co-packaged with 
the medicinal product. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured at one manufacturing site, with further sites involved for 
secondary packaging and QC testing. 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: compounding of solutions, homogenisation and 
milling of the slurry, filtration and dilution of the milled slurry and bottle filling. The process is considered 
to be a non-standard manufacturing process.  
The manufacturing process is described in sufficient detail. There is only one proposed commercial 
batch size. 
A critical process time is identified for the harvested milled slurry. Holding times at other stages of the 
process have also been adequately defined. 
The target fill weight corresponds to an approximate overfill of 5.5 ml ensuring that the label claim 
volume can been extracted.  
During the procedure, a Major Objection was raised in relation to the need to provide process 
validation data from 3 full production scale batches. In response, the required information was 
presented to resolve the Major Objection. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process 
controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance, identification (HPLC and HPLC (DAD), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), uniformity of 
dosage units (Ph. Eur.), re-suspendability (HPLC), preservative assay (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), 
pH (Ph. Eur.), deliverable volume (USP), particle size analysis (Ph. Eur.), burkholderia cepacia (USP), 
microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.), specific organisms (Ph. Eur.), viscosity (Ph. Eur.) and uniformity of 
mass delivered doses (Ph. Eur.). Efficacy of antimicrobial preservation (Ph. Eur.) and weight loss 
(weight determination) are only tested at shelf-life. 
Release and shelf-life specifications are acceptable and include all relevant parameters in line with ICH 
Q6A. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. All ICH Q3D class 1 
and 2A elements were evaluated. In addition, elements which could possibly be present in the finished 
product due to the manufacturing process of active substance (catalyst), or the finished product have 
also been considered. The relevant elements have been monitored in ten finished product batches 
manufactured using the proposed commercial manufacturing. Batch analysis data demonstrated that 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 19/132 
 
 
 
each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the 
presented data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls 
in the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is 
satisfactory. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed as requested by the CHMP as a Major Objection considering all suspected and 
actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there 
is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, 
no specific control measures are deemed necessary. The Major Objection raised during the procedure 
is resolved. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for all batches of the proposed formulation manufactured to date 
and include batches manufactured with investigated milling systems. This comprises 28 batches of 
which 10 were manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site and of which 5 were 
designated as registration batches. The registration batches were manufactured using the proposed 
commercial active substance and manufacturing process and were released using the proposed 
commercial finished product specifications. Results confirm the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data is available from five batches of finished product manufactured by the proposed 
commercial process, of which four were pilot scale and one was full commercial scale. All batches were 
packed in the packaging proposed for marketing and were stored both upright and inverted. Samples 
were stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines. The batches of 
medicinal product are representative of those proposed for marketing. In addition, supportive data is 
available from several batches, which were stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions 
(25°C / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH).  
Samples were tested for the same parameters as for release and in addition, for weight loss and 
efficacy of antimicrobial preservation. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and 
are stability-indicating. The results show no significant changes or trends. 
Forced degradation studies were conducted on one batch and confirmed the stability indicating nature 
of the analytical methods for assay and impurities testing. Samples were exposed to acid hydrolysis, 
base hydrolysis, heat, oxidation and photolytic conditions. The highest level of degradation was 
observed under acid-hydrolysis conditions. Minor degradation was observed upon exposure to 3 times 
the exposure recommended in ICH guidance. An acceptable mass balance was obtained under all 
stressed conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 20/132 
 
 
 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Results  confirm  that  the  finished  product  in  the  commercial 
packaging is not sensitive to degradation by light. 
In-use stability study 
An in-use stability study was conducted using aged finished product that was within or had exceeded 
its two year shelf-life. Testing included microbiological testing in accordance with USP and Ph. Eur. and 
was conducted over 31 days which is the proposed in use shelf-life. All tested parameters complied 
with their limits. Analytical results are comparable from the first dose from a full bottle to the last dose 
from a depleted bottle. No trends related to the age of the finished product were observed. The results 
demonstrate that the preservative systems inhibit bacterial and yeast/mould challenges (inoculation) 
for up to 24 months under long-term storage conditions and for the in-use shelf-life.  
Temperature excursions and freeze thaw studies 
Temperature excursions have been studied between 5°C ±3°C /ambient RH and 25°C ±2°C /60% 
±5%RH (24 hours each, three cycles) to simulate the finished product encountering cold conditions, 
between 25°C ±2°C /60% ±5% RH and 40°C ±2°C /75% ±5% RH (24 hours each, three cycles) to 
simulate brief exposure to warmer temperature and a freeze/thaw study has been conducted (2 days 
at -20°C and 2 days at 25°C/60% RH, one or three cycles) to determine the effects of freezing of the 
finished product. Results show that the suspension is stable across the studied temperatures. 
Dosing devices and repeated use 
During the procedure, a Major Objection was initially raised on the proposed dosing device (12 mL oral 
syringe) as the suitability was not considered adequately justified. The “in-use” microbiological study 
conducted did not adequately reflect real-world use and results therefore could not be extrapolated to 
expected patient use. In response, the applicant proposed new dosing devices, which are the 3 ml and 
12 ml syringes (differently graduated) now co-packed with the product. According to the supplier’s 
specifications, the syringes should not be used for more than 50 cycles. For the 12 ml syringes, 
considering the minimal dose that is to be measured with these syringes, the content of one bottle is 
spent after 36 cycles. The SmPC clearly indicates that for each new bottle, a new syringe should 
always be used. For the 3 ml syringe, the SmPC clearly indicates that it should be replaced with a new 
one after 16 days (48 cycles) of use and two syringes are provided with each bottle. These instructions 
are considered adequate. 
A study was conducted simulating the normal use of the product and syringes as per the SmPC 
(maximum repeat use of new syringes i.e., 36 cycles for the 12 ml syringe and 60 cycles for the 3 ml 
syringe). The study addressed the readability of the graduation marks, the risk of microbial 
contamination and the accuracy of dosage. For all three aspects, results adequately demonstrate that 
the syringes are suitable for the intended use, the graduation does not change and the tests for 
microbial contamination and uniformity of delivered doses comply with the requirements until the end 
of the study. The suitability of the dosing devices has been adequately confirmed and the syringes 
comply with Ph. Eur. 2.9.27 requirements. The Major Objection is resolved. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years without any special temperature 
storage conditions and in-use instructions to ‘use within 30 days of first opening the bottle’ as stated in 
the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. During the procedure, two Major Objections were raised on 
the active substance relating to the designation of the starting material and the control of an impurity 
in the starting material. Satisfactory responses were received to resolve the Major Objections. In 
addition, four Major Objections were raised on the finished product relating to the preservative 
content, the need to provide process validation data, the nitrosamine risk assessment and the dosing 
device. Satisfactory responses were received on the issues raised and the Major Objections are 
resolved. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to the need to develop a sodium 
benzoate-free formulation and to continue and finalise further development studies related to the 
compatibility of the oral suspension with food, drinks, enteral tubes as well as to further study shake 
time and stand time. These points are put forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality 
development (see recommendations). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro primary pharmacodynamics 
The in vitro primary PD studies consisted of radioligand binding assays, the evaluation of GABAA 
receptor-mediated currents and chloride uptake experiments. 
The radioligand binding assays performed in rat brain cortical membrane suspension demonstrated 
that GNX was able to inhibit the binding of TBPS (chloride channel antagonist) and potentiate the 
binding of flunitrazepam (benzodiazepine site) and muscimol (GABA recognition site). GNX exhibited 
modulatory activity with an IC50 of 80 nM for TBPS, an EC50 of 125 nM for flunitrazepam, and 86 nM for 
muscimol. GNX was demonstrated to be stereoselective and was a positive modulator of the chloride 
channel site and the benzodiazepine site. In addition, GNX had positive allosteric modulatory effects at 
GABAA receptors similar to those of the endogenous steroid allopregnanolone (3α,5α-P). 
In Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing human GABAA receptors (α1β1γ2L, α2β1γ2L and α3β1γ2L), GNX 
concentration-dependently enhanced chloride currents evoked by GABA, with an EC50 of 213, 94 and 
122 nM, respectively. GNX directly activated the GABAA receptor at relatively high concentrations (1–
10 µM).  
In rat brain cortical synaptoneurosomes, GNX potentiated GABA-stimulated chloride uptake in a 
concentration-dependent manner (at 1 μM and 10 μM) up to 43%, indicating that GNX enhances 
GABAA receptor function.  
In vivo primary pharmacodynamics 
The anticonvulsant activity of GNX was characterized in chemically-induced convulsion models 
(pentyletetrazol (PTZ), TBPS, aminophylline, bicuculline, strychnine), in the 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-
induced lethality model, in the maximal electroconvulsive shock (MES) model and in the cornea-kindled 
convulsion model. 
In mice, the maximal protection against PTZ-induced clonic seizures was 10 minutes after GNX 
administration, whereas in rats, GNX was also maximally protective after 30 minutes. In both mice and 
rats, the efficacy of GNX decreased over time. GNX administered to mice increased the dose of PTZ 
required to produce clonic convulsions, thus the seizure threshold, in a dose-dependent manner, before 
reaching a dose sufficient to produce ataxia in the rotarod test. GNX also dose-dependently protected 
against PTZ-induced seizures in rats. After oral administration in rats, the GNX dose that was 
protective for 50% of the animals tested (ED50) was 21.0 mg/kg. 
GNX demonstrated protective effects in mice against convulsions induced by bicuculline, TBPS and 
aminophylline, with ED50 values of 4.6 mg/kg, 11.7 mg/kg and 11.5 mg/kg. There was no protective 
effect against convulsions induced by strychnine, probably because strychnine is an antagonist of 
glycine and acetylcholine receptors.  
In rats kindled to stage 5 seizures by daily electrical stimulation of the cornea, IP administration of 
GNX exhibited potent anticonvulsant effects, with an ED50 of 4.5 mg/kg. 
In the MES model, GNX (IP) dose-dependently inhibited seizures in mice, with an ED50 of 29.7 mg/kg 
and an onset of 30 minutes. The efficacy of GNX against MES significantly decreased over time. After 
oral administration in rats, GNX dose-dependently inhibited MES-induced seizures, with an ED50 of 58.4 
mg/kg. In both mice and rats, the effective doses caused drug-related behavioural effects in the 
rotarod test.  
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 23/132 
 
 
 
In the 4-AP model, doses that induced protection were compared to doses that caused general 
behavioural toxicity in the same mice, as measured by loss of traction reflex. The protective dose 
without causing general behavioural toxicity was 30 mg/kg; higher doses (56 and 100 mg/kg) also 
caused a loss of traction, whereas lower doses (10 and 17 mg/kg) were not protective.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro secondary pharmacodynamics 
The selectivity of GNX was evaluated in binding screens of receptors, ion channels, and enzymes. In 
addition, GNX and major human metabolite M2 activity on the progesterone receptor and oestrogen 
receptors α and β was assessed. The functional activity of M2 at the GABAA receptor was also 
investigated, in addition to a screen of 44 pharmacological targets.  
In a screen of CNS receptors, the activity of GNX as a competitive inhibitor of the binding of several 
radioligands was investigated for 37 types of receptors or recognition sites. At 10 µM, GNX had limited 
activity (not more than 40%) on inhibiting or stimulating ligands for the GABA recognition-, 
benzodiazepine-, and chloride channel sites. This is probably due to the absence of exogenously added 
GABA and/or the absence of chloride ions in the incubation mixture, which are thought to be necessary 
for GNX’ allosteric action.  
GNX had a minimal affinity for cytosolic steroid receptors (IC50 > 10 μM), including soluble oestrogen, 
glucocorticoid, progesterone and testosterone receptors. 
In an in vitro binding assay screen with receptors, transporters, and ion-gated channel systems that 
have CNS sites of action, GNX (10 μM) inhibited (95.8%) binding of the antagonist radioligand for the 
GABA-gated chloride channel.  
The applicant also provided an evaluation of M2 and GNX activity as agonist and antagonist of the 
human progesterone receptor and oestrogen receptors (PGR, ERα and Erβ, respectively). Neither M2 
nor GNX demonstrated activity as agonist or antagonist of the human progesterone receptor and 
oestrogen receptors (PGR, ERα and Erβ, respectively) except for antagonist activity of M2 at the ERβ 
receptor. 
In an in vitro off-target radioligand assay, M2 (10 µM) was evaluated against 44 pharmacological 
targets. M2 showed no significant effects (>50%), except for agonist activity against the adenosine A2A 
(human) receptor (61% inhibition). Since the free fraction is about 0.3 µM, this is sufficiently below the 
concentration required to elicit activation of the A2A receptor. 
In vivo secondary pharmacodynamics 
To evaluate the dependence potential of GNX, GLP-compliant drug abuse liability studies in rats were 
conducted that evaluated self-administration, drug discrimination and physical dependence. 
In self-administration studies, GNX showed reinforcing characteristics from 0.1 mg/kg.  
GNX also generalised to midazolam in drug discrimination studies, suggesting that GNX may produce 
midazolam-like psychoactive effects, such as the risk of tolerance and abuse.  
In a physical dependence study, rats demonstrated signs of withdrawal and tolerance to the 
behavioural and physiological effects of GNX at clinically relevant exposures, indicating that GNX may 
cause the development of physical dependence. However, these effects were less pronounced 
compared to diazepam.

2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology package comprised GLP-compliant cardiovascular (dogs), respiratory (rats) 
and CNS (rats) safety studies, and non-GLP CNS studies (rodents), including a rotarod test, locomotor 
test, cognitive function study and a sedation study.  
In a GLP-compliant female rat CNS study, preformulated GNX (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) was evaluated 
for clinical observations, body weights and the modified Irwin battery. In line with ICH S7A, the 
modified Irwin battery evaluated motor activity, behavioural changes, coordination, sensory/motor 
reflex responses and body temperature. A transient, GNX-related decrease in body temperature (<5%) 
was observed in all dose groups. At 20 mg/kg onwards, the only GNX-related CNS effects were 
abnormal visual responses and ataxia. Ataxia was considered to be dose-dependent. Mild to moderate 
grasping loss, abnormal righting reflex and low carriage were observed in animals in the high-dose 
group. All behavioural effects ranged from mild to moderate between 2-6 hours post-dose and were 
noted at the mid and high dose in a dose- and time-dependent manner, most likely due to the 
sedative, pharmacological effect of GNX.  
Locomotor activity (both mice and rats) and cognitive function (mice) studies were dose-dependently 
influenced by GNX. In mice, dose-dependent effects of GNX on motor function started from 20 mg/kg 
onwards and in rats at 5 mg/kg. The lowest dose, which produced a significant decrease in locomotor 
activity for GNX was 16-fold lower than valproate (GNX 50 mg/kg vs valproate 800 mg/kg) and 18-fold 
lower than ethosuximide (GNX 50 mg/kg vs ethosuximide 900 mg/kg) in mice. In rats, on the 
contrary, the minimum sedative dose for GNX (15 mg/kg) was 53-fold lower than valproate and 
ethosuximide (800 mg/kg), suggesting that GNX has more potent sedative effects compared to 
controls. 
Higher doses (40 mg/kg in mice and 20 mg/kg in rats) also caused a loss of righting reflex, which was 
considered adverse. Cognitive function was significantly impaired at a dose of 30 mg/kg. These GNX 
effects were presented as deficits in motor function or in the latency to learn a response and were 
attributed to the sedative effect of GNX. GNX had strong sedative properties when administered IV to 
rats as a nanosuspension formulation or a Captisol formulation. In both formulations, GNX transiently 
induced dose-dependent, deep sedation but not full anaesthesia, starting from the low dose.  
In two GLP-compliant in vitro hERG inhibition studies, no significant hERG inhibition was observed with 
GNX at concentrations up to 10 µM, which is approximately 11-fold the total GNX concentration at the 
clinical Cmax of ~300 ng/ml. Assuming that 1% of GNX is available as a free fraction, the safety margin 
for unbound GNX becomes 1100 times the anticipated clinical Cmax and no hERG-related effects would 
be expected in humans.  
In a GLP-compliant telemetry study in male dogs, it was reported that orally administered doses of 
preformulated GNX up to 15 mg/kg did not affect body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate (HR), 
or qualitative or quantitative ECG parameters (QRS duration and RR, PR, and QT(c) intervals), but it 
was associated with ataxia.  
Notably, HR appeared to be increased up to 140 bpm in all dose groups, including controls, when the 
drug was administered. In addition, in GNX-treated animals, the HR remained elevated in a dose-
related manner for up to five hours past dosing, while in control animals, the HR returned to baseline 
quickly after dosing. However, there were no signs of cardiovascular effects in the clinical studies. 
In a GLP-compliant respiratory safety study in female rats, no notable changes were related to 
preformulated GNX in respiratory rate, tidal volume, or minute volume at doses up to 40 mg/kg.

2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions of GNX with ethanol and diazepam were investigated in non-GLP 
rodent studies. 
Ethanol potentiation studies in mice and rats suggested that GNX may increase the sedative effect of 
ethanol in a dose-dependent manner. 
A combination study of diazepam and GNX was conducted in the rat lithium-pilocarpine model of status 
epilepticus (SE). Diazepam (5 mg/kg) or GNX (3 or 6 mg/kg) administered (IV) individually had 
modest effects on suppressing EEG activity. It should be noted that there were only 2 animals in the 
GNX alone groups. In contrast, the combination of diazepam with GNX suppressed EEG activity in a 
dose-dependent manner. One animal in the diazepam + GNX 6 mg/kg group died post-dosing at the 
time when the EEG activity was most severely reduced. The other animals in this group appeared 
deeply sedated. In a separate group of rats, plasma levels of GNX and diazepam alone and in 
combination were measured. The Cmax and half-life of these compounds were not influenced by co-
administration, suggesting that the synergistic effect was not due to a PK interaction. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Fifteen single-dose PK studies were conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys. The single-
dose study in rabbits demonstrated low and highly variable exposure, which precluded rabbits from 
being used in an assessment of embryofoetal toxicity.  
2.5.3.1.  Absorption 
The single-dose PK of GNX was studied in male and female CD-1 mice at different doses. Following IV 
dosing at 10 mg/kg (n = 4 mice/time point), the plasma concentration of GNX declined quickly (~4-
fold from 0.5 – 1 hour after dosing) in a bidirectional fashion (0-8h). For both male and female mice, 
distribution volume (Vss) was very high (21 L/kg), i.e. ~29-fold more than body water. Clearance 
(plasma) was 263 and 298 mL/min/kg for male and female mice, respectively, which is ~3-fold the 
liver blood flow. The terminal half-life (t1/2) value after dosing was 1.3 and 1.6 h in male and female 
mice, respectively. 
Upon oral administration of 40 mg/kg (n = 4 mice/time point), the absorption in plasma was fast, with 
a Tmax of 1.5 h, but present at the first timepoint (15 min) and extending up to 2h. A terminal 
elimination half-life (t1/2) value of 1.9 and 3.7 h was found in female and male, respectively, but this is 
underestimated given the short follow-up. Absolute oral bioavailability (Fpo) in mice was only 6.2% 
(M) and 8.0% (F), with exposure (AUC) in females (179 ng*h/mL) higher than in males (156 
ng*h/mL). In a different study, mice were orally dosed (male, 500 and 1000 mg/kg; female, 250 and 
500 mg/kg), yielding a similar (dose normalised) exposure, but absorption in male mice appeared to 
be slower than in female mice.  
The PK of GNX in plasma and brain tissue was determined in male CF1 mice following a single dose IV 
administration (10 mg/kg, n = 8/time point, 0-24h), and it was found that GNX rapidly entered the 
brain. At the first time point (1 min), the highest brain exposure (Cmax 8223 ng/g) was found, which 
was 4-fold lower than in plasma (36331 ng/mL).  
GNX exposure in the brain declined quickly thereafter (distribution half-life of 15 min), but less fast 
than in plasma, leading to 5-fold higher levels in the brain than in plasma at 5 min and ~9-fold higher 
at 15 – 30 min post-dosing. Total GNX brain exposure (AUCinf) was about 2-fold higher than in 
plasma. Similar results were found upon intraperitoneal (IP) GNX dosing (20 mg/kg), which gave a 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023

comparable exposure in brain and plasma at the first timepoint (5 min) and 1.5 (at plasma Tmax 0.5 
h) and 4-fold at 2 h post-dosing.  
In a third study with 3H-GNX (single IV dose, 10 mg/kg) administered to male CF1 mice, it was found 
that radioactivity declined biphasic in plasma with a rapid distribution phase and a slower elimination 
phase (plasma t½ 20h, brain 
were 0.9 and 1.2, respectively. Following a single oral administration of 20 mg/kg 14C-GNX to CD-1 
mice (male/female), 14C-GNX related radioactivity showed a Tmax at 1 – 4h and declined thereafter up 
t½ 15h). For unchanged GNX, the elimination t½ for plasma and brain 
to 72h after dosing with a terminal half-life (t1/2) value of 26-40 h.  
The single-dose PK of ganaxolone was studied in male Sprague Dawley rats following IV dosing at 
2 mg/kg and oral gavage dosing at 40 or 80 mg/kg GNX (n = 3/time point). Following IV 
administration, the plasma concentration of GNX declined in a bidirectional fashion (0-8h). Distribution 
to the tissues was very fast, with a half-life of 3 minutes, and distribution volume (Vss) was high (7.9 
L/kg), i.e. ~12-fold more than body water. Clearance from plasma was 77 mL/min/kg, which is 1.4-
fold the liver blood flow. Terminal half-life (t1/2) value up to 8h after dosing was ~1.5 h.  
Upon oral administration to male rats, the absorption in plasma was fast with a Tmax of 1.5 to 2 h for 
the 40 - 80 mg/kg (50% HPβCD) and 40 mg/kg (20% HPβCD) groups, respectively. Thereafter, the 
plasma concentration of GNX declined, but this was slower with increasing doses or lower HPβCD 
formulation. A terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) value of 5.5 – 8.6 h was found, but this is 
underestimated, given the short follow-up. Upon oral dosing of GNX, blood exposure (AUC0–∞) 
increased more (~8-fold) than dose-proportional over the dose range of 40 to 80 mg/kg (in 50% 
HPβCD). Absolute oral bioavailability (Fpo) was stated to be 11.3% for 40 mg/kg (50% HPβCD), 
44.7% for 80 mg/kg (50% HPβCD), and 17.3% for 40 mg/kg (20% HPβCD). The formula used to 
calculate the Fpo was corrected as the Fpo is the ratio of the dose-normalised AUCpo/AUCiv.  
Following a single oral administration of 10 mg/kg 14C-GNX to SD rats (male/female), 14C-GNX related 
radioactivity showed a Tmax at 1 – 4h and declined thereafter up to 72h after dosing with a terminal 
half-life (t1/2) value of ~13 h. In a second study given 14C-GNX (IV 2 mg/kg, PO 40 mg/kg) to male SD 
rats, a similar biphasic PK profile of the 14C-related radioactivity was seen upon IV administration with 
a fast biphasic distribution of label to the tissues but a longer terminal elimination than with non-
labelled GNX (T½ 11-12h). Upon oral administration, a Tmax of radioactivity in plasma was seen at ~2 
h and a terminal elimination T½ of 31 h. Absolute oral bioavailability, calculated using 14C-related 
AUC0-inf values (and without the CL in the formula, using the actual dose), was 67 and 77% for blood 
and plasma. The blood-to-plasma (B/P) ratio, based on [14C]-GNX related oral exposure (AUC) was 
found to be 0.56, indicating a preferential partitioning in plasma. 
The PK of [14C]-GNX was evaluated in female rabbits after single oral (10, 40, 60, 80 mg/kg, n=2-4) 
and IV (2, 4 mg/kg, n=1) doses. Upon IV administration, GNX plasma concentration showed a 
biphasic, rapid decline, which was by 2-fold in 10 min and about 20-fold in the first 2 h, thereafter, the 
terminal elimination half-life was 7-10 h. However, the [14C]-GNX related radioactivity showed a much 
slower decline, i.e. only 2-fold in the first 6 h after dosing, indicating fast and extensive metabolism. At 
2 h after dosing, the plasma [14C]-radioactivity concentration was ~20-fold higher than GNX, 
suggesting substantial metabolism. The terminal elimination half-life of [14C]-radioactivity was >24 h. 
In fasted male Beagle dogs (n = 3), the single-dose PK was studied following IV dosing at 2 mg/kg and 
oral gavage dosing at 40 or 60 mg/kg GNX. Following IV administration in dogs, the plasma 
concentration of GNX declined in a bidirectional fashion (0-8h). Distribution to the tissues was very fast 
with a half-life of 6 minutes, and distribution volume (Vss) was high (3.5 L/kg), i.e. ~6-fold more than 
body water. Plasma clearance was 29 mL/min/kg, similar to the liver blood flow. Terminal half-life (t1/2) 
value up to 8h after dosing was 1.7 h. Upon oral administration to male dogs, the absorption in plasma 
was fast but extended with Tmax ranging from 0.75 to 8 h. Thereafter, the plasma concentration of

GNX declined with finally a terminal half-life (t1/2) value was 34 - 60 hrs but measured only up to 24-
52 hrs. Upon oral dosing of GNX, blood exposure (AUC0–∞) increased more (3-fold) than dose-
proportional over the dose range of 40 to 60 mg/kg (in 50% HPβCD). For the 40 mg/kg dose, two 
different formulations were used (20% and 50% HPβCD), which both gave a similar exposure (AUC0–
∞), but with the 20% HPβCD formulation, a 2-fold higher Cmax was found, and a steeper decline 
thereafter. Absolute oral bioavailability (Fpo) was updated using the correct formula and found to be 
64.6 for 40 mg/kg (50% HPβCD), 116% for 60 mg/kg (50% HPβCD), and 54.9% for 40 mg/kg (20% 
HPβCD).  
Following a single oral administration of 10 mg/kg 14C-GNX to Beagle dogs (male/female), 14C-GNX 
related radioactivity showed a Tmax at 1 – 1.5h, was found to be 2-fold higher in females than in 
males and declined thereafter slowly with terminal half-life (t1/2) value of 30-47 h. In a second study 
given 14C-GNX (IV 2 mg/kg, PO 10 mg/kg) to male Beagle dogs (n=6), a similar biphasic PK profile of 
the 14C-related radioactivity was seen upon IV administration with a fast distribution of label to the 
tissues but a longer terminal elimination than with GNX. Upon oral administration, a Tmax of 
radioactivity in plasma was seen at 84 min and a terminal elimination of 29 h. Absolute oral 
bioavailability, calculated using 14C-related AUC0-inf values, was >90% for blood or plasma. The blood 
to plasma (B/P) ratio, based on [14C]-GNX related concentration (AUC), was found to be 0.57, 
indicating a preferential partitioning in plasma. 
The single-dose PK of ganaxolone in fasted male cynomolgus monkeys (n=4) was studied following IV 
dosing at 2 mg/kg and oral dosing at 10 mg/kg ganaxolone with and without food. Following IV 
administration, the plasma concentration of ganaxolone declined in a multidirectional fashion 
characterized by a systemic clearance of 1.4 L/h/kg (50% of liver flow) and a high volume of 
distribution (Vss) of 3.4 L/kg, which is ~5-fold more than body water. Following oral administration, 
absorption was slow in plasma in fasted condition (Tmax 7.4 hrs) and slightly faster with food (Tmax 
4.9 hrs). Based on AUC, in plasma, exposure was 20% lower with food than in fasted condition and 
Cmax 29% lower with food. Oral bioavailability was low (4.0%) and slightly lower with food (3.2%).  
2.5.3.2.  Distribution  
In vitro: The equilibrium dialysis method showed that GNX was highly protein-bound, generating 1.1% 
of unbound GNX in human plasma and that more than 10 hr were needed to reach equilibrium.  
Protein binding studies with GNX were also performed in vitro using plasma from mice, rats and 
humans at 50 or 500 ng/ml (n=2) after incubation at 37°C for 4 h. GNX plasma protein binding (PPB) 
was found to be >86.3%, >94.6%, >84.4% at 50 ng/ml and >99.1%, >99.3%, and >99.3% at 500 
ng/ml for mouse, rat and human, respectively. In a later supplied study report CYP2472 R2, which 
described the determination of the extent of protein binding of ganaxolone in plasma of humans, rats, 
and dogs using equilibrium dialysis (up to 8 hrs), ganaxolone at 5 µM (1662.5 ng/ml) was found to be 
very highly protein bound with PPB values ≥99.9% in rat, dog and human plasma. 
In vitro studies with the human putative metabolite (M2) indicates that M2 is very highly protein-
bound in mice, rats and dogs. M2 appeared highly permeable in human Caco-2 cells. 
The partitioning of GNX into plasma and blood was determined after single-dose oral administration of 
[14C]-GNX to mouse, rat and dog. The blood-to-plasma (B/P) ratio, based on [14C]-GNX related 
concentration (Cmax), was found to be 0.56, indicating a preferential partitioning in plasma. This B/P 
ratio increased over time up to 0.87 at 72 hrs after dosing, indicating some red blood cell (RBC) 
partitioning over time.

In vivo: The in vivo tissue distribution of a single dose of labelled [3H]-ganaxolone was investigated in 
the male CF1 mice (IV, 10 mg/kg [3H]-GNX) in a mass balance study up to 24 hrs post-dose. At the 
earliest time point (15 min) radioactivity was highest in the liver and intestines, followed by the 
kidney, brain, lung, spleen, testis, and heart and declined thereafter in all tissues except the intestines 
(highest at 6 hrs).  
The in vivo tissue distribution of a single dose of labelled [14C]-ganaxolone was investigated in the 
male SD albino rat (IV 2 mg/kg, PO 40 mg/kg [14C]-GNX) in a mass balance study up to 48 hrs post-
dose. At the earliest time point (1 h) after IV or PO administration, radioactivity was detected in all 23 
tissues, indicating a fast and broad distribution, and declined thereafter in generally all tissues except 
intestines upon IV administration (highest at 8 hrs). Upon PO administration, the highest radioactivity, 
except in the gastro-intestinal tract, was found in the liver, adrenal glands, fat pancreas, lymph gland 
and mammary glands. At 48 hrs post-dose total tissue radioactivity declined to ~2% of the dose as 
compared to 87% at 1h. Label in brain and testes indicates passage of the respective barriers by GNX. 
The in vivo tissue distribution of a single dose of labelled [14C]-ganaxolone was investigated in the 
partially-pigmented male Long Evans rat (PO 5 mg/kg [14C]-GNX) using quantitative whole-body 
autoradiography (QWBA) at 1h, 4h, 24h, 72h and 168 h post-dose. Tissue distribution was wide in 
pigmented rats and comparable to that in the non-pigmented male rats. The highest 14C-related 
radioactivity at 1 h post-dose was found in bile and liver. The earliest time point (1h) was for most 
tissues, the Tmax. Tissue to plasma ratio (T/P) was generally found to be between 0.2 – 1.5 for all 
tissues during the first 4 hours post-dose, except for the liver (T/P=19). No radioactivity was found in 
abdominal fat, bones, and eye lens. At 72h post-dose, radioactivity in all tissues was not detectable, 
except for the liver. As pigmented and non-pigmented skins were comparably labelled, it is concluded 
that there is no melanin binding. Radioactivity was found to cross the testis, and blood-brain barrier, 
and exposure was about 2-fold lower than in blood. 
After a single oral administration of [14C]ganaxolone to lactating SD rats, [14C]-GNX-derived 
radioactivity was readily secreted as GNX and metabolites into milk. GNX was both in plasma (16%) 
and milk (71%) the largest component of radioactivity. The milk to plasma ratio ranged from 2.2 – 4.2 
for [14C]-GNX-derived radioactivity and 3.6 – 14 for GNX, indicating a selective distribution to milk. 
2.5.3.3.  Metabolism  
In vitro metabolism studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP P450 enzymes are 
consistent with ganaxolone metabolism by CYP3A4, and to a much lesser extent by 3A5, 2B6, 2C19 
and 2D6 enzymes. The metabolism of GNX was further evaluated in rat and human liver microsomes, 
using labelled ([3H]- or [14C]-) GNX. The primary metabolite observed with human liver microsomes 
was identified as 16α-hydroxyganaxolone (M1). This metabolite was also formed during incubation of 
[14C]-GNX with the mouse, rat, and dog liver microsomes. The initial metabolites in the proposed 
pathway, 16α-hydroxyganaxolone, 20β-hydroxyganaxolone, and 3β-hydroxymethylganaxolone (all 
mono-hydroxylated), when isolated from microsomal incubates and re-introduced into microsomal 
incubations, were all further metabolized to 20-keto reduced di-hydroxylated and tri-hydroxylated 
metabolites.  
In vivo metabolism with metabolite identification was evaluated in mice, rats and dogs, providing 
information on possible metabolic pathways. Gender differences in the metabolic profiles were 
observed, caused by a sex difference in hepatic expression of the metabolising (CYP) enzymes yielding 
different metabolite levels in female as compared to male rodents.  
Following a single oral administration of 20 mg/kg 14C-GNX to CD-1 mice (male/female, M/F), 
radio-HPLC profiles showed that unchanged GNX was the minor source of circulating radioactivity in 
Assessment report

Page 29/132 
 
 
 
plasma (1.8%/1.5%). The largest of the >10 circulating radioactive metabolites in plasma (M/F) were 
M39 (22%/12%), M35 (11%/7%) and M45 (1.5%/8.8%). M44 was a minor circulating component in 
male mouse plasma, while it was at 12.7% in female mouse plasma. Most of the metabolites were 
formed via Phase I biotransformation, e.g. multiple (mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-) hydroxylation 
(16alpha-OH, 3beta-OH) and ketone reduction (20beta-OH).  
In mouse faeces (0-72h), containing 93% of the radioactive dose, most of the excreted radioactivity 
was associated with unchanged GNX (5-8%) and 10 metabolites, of which M40/M41 (~11%), M36 
(~9%), M35 (12%, male-only), and the rest were 1-6% of the radioactive dose. In urine, containing 
about 4-8% of the radioactive dose, unchanged GNX (0.01%) and 13 metabolites were found, of which 
M44 was excreted as the largest radioactive component (~0.4% of the radioactive dose), while the 
others were <0.2%. 
Following a single oral administration of 20 mg/kg 14C-GNX to SD rats (male/female), radio-HPLC 
profiles showed that unchanged GNX was the minor source of circulating radioactivity in male plasma 
but large in female (M/F, 1.0%/8.5%). The largest of the >15 circulating radioactive metabolites in 
male rat plasma (M/F) were M31 (25%/1.5%), M30 (8.3%/0.4%) and M28/M29 (7.0%/0.5%), while in 
female rat plasma the largest were M23 (1%/16%), M1 (1%/12%), and M26/M27 (0.1%/8.3%). Most 
of the metabolites were formed via Phase I biotransformation, e.g. multiple (mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-
) hydroxylation (16alpha-OH, 3beta-OH) and 20-ketone reduction (20beta-OH). Glucuronidation was 
the only observed Phase II metabolic reaction. 
In rat faeces (0-72h), most of the excreted radioactivity (58% of dose) in male rats was mainly 
associated with unchanged GNX (21%), and >15 metabolites, of which M33 (~5%) was the largest 
and the rest were 0.1-2.6% of the radioactive dose, while in female rat faeces, containing 75% of 
radioactivity dose, unchanged GNX (~3%) were minor. In female faeces, M23 (~8%) and M24/M25 
(10%) were the major metabolites, and the rest of the >15 metabolites were 0.1-4% of the 
radioactive dose. In urine containing 16% (M) and 8% (F) of the radioactive dose, ~12 metabolites 
were found, of which in male M20 and M21/M22 were excreted at about ~4% of the radioactive dose, 
while the others were <1.5%. Unchanged GNX was less than 0.1% in urine. 
Following a single oral administration of 10 mg/kg 14C-GNX to Beagle dogs (male/female), radio-HPLC 
profiles showed that unchanged GNX was a large part of circulating radioactivity in dog plasma (M/F, 
21%/34%). The largest of the 14 circulating radioactive metabolites was M1 (28%/21%). Of the other 
metabolites in dog plasma (M/F), M15 (7%/5%) and M5 (2%/3%) were identified, while the remaining 
metabolites were 0.2-6.4% of the radioactivity in plasma. These others in plasma were 42%/36% of 
total radioactivity from 0-48h. Most of the metabolites were formed via Phase I biotransformation, e.g. 
multiple (mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-) hydroxylation (16alpha-OH, 3beta-OH) and 20-ketone reduction 
(20beta-OH).  
In dog faeces (0-168h/216h), most of the excreted radioactivity (~70% of dose) in male and female 
dogs was associated with unchanged GNX (M/F, 24%/27%) and ~20 metabolites, of which M1 
(32%/22%) was the largest, followed by M5 (6%/3%) and the rest of the metabolites were less than 
6% of the radioactive dose. In urine containing 3% (M) and 5% (F) of the radioactive dose, ~24 
metabolites were found, each excreted at less than 0.4% of the radioactive dose. Unchanged GNX was 
less than 0.1% in urine. 
A comparison of ganaxolone metabolites in human plasma upon multiple dosing was made with 
metabolites in mouse, rat and dog plasma. In human pooled plasma samples, approximately 30 
metabolites with each >1% of the total peak area were detected in total. While the parent compound 
was detected as a minor component (<1%), two major (>10%) metabolites were detected, which 
were GNX+O+gluc(uronide) at 21% and GNX+2O at 16% of total drug-related exposure in humans. 
The glucuronide GNX+O+gluc was also found in dog plasma (at 4%), and female mouse plasma (12%)

but not in rat plasma or male mouse plasma. The other major metabolite, GNX+2O was not detected 
in rat, mouse or dog plasma. In addition, six other human metabolites were found, with each a 
presence of 4% - 9% of total exposure, of which five were glucuronides (~5% GNX+O+gluc, 7-9% 
GNX+2O+gluc, 6-8% GNX+H2O+gluc, 4-6% GNX+H2O+gluc, 4-6% GNX+H2O+O+gluc) and one not 
(4-5% GNX+H2O+H2). Of these latter metabolites, four with a total exposure of 18% - 25% were not 
present in the pivotal preclinical chronic toxicology species (female) rat and dog.  
2.5.3.4.  Excretion 
After a single oral administration of [14C]ganaxolone, the excretion of radioactivity was predominantly 
through the faecal (biliary) pathway, and, for the mouse, rat, and dog, it accounted for 93%, 64-82% 
and ~71% of the radioactivity dose, while the urinary route (including cage wash) contributed 4-8%, 
12-29% and 8-17%, respectively. The total recovery of radioactivity, 3 (rodents) or 5 (dog) days after 
dosing, was high in the mouse (>97%), rat (93%) and human (>90%) and moderate in the dog (77-
81%).  
In separate ADME studies in male Beagle dogs, given [14C]ganaxolone, and in male SD rats, given 
[3H]ganaxolone, a similar excretion profile was found when dosed orally or intravenously (IV), with 
predominantly faecal (po ~70%, IV 65-76%) as compared to renal (po 13-21%, IV 15%-23) 
excretion. The high faecal excretion upon IV administration may indicate that biliary (and/or intestinal) 
excretion plays an important part in the excretion of ganaxolone. 
In male and female bile duct-cannulated SD rats, following intravenous administration of [3H]-GNX, 
excretion into the bile, faeces, and urine was 78%, 1% and 7-17% of the radioactivity dose, 
respectively, indicating a predominant biliary clearance. Following oral administration, also 78% was 
found in bile, while 6% and 4-9% of the dose was excreted into faeces or in urine, confirming the 
mainly biliary excretion and that this was found after a high oral absorption.  
2.5.3.5.  PK studies with Human Metabolite M2 
In vitro studies with the human metabolite M2 indicate that it is highly protein bound in the plasma of 
all species tested (mouse, rat, dog and human). M2 significantly inhibited CYP2C8 activity, with 70% to 
82% of CYP2C8 activity inhibited at the highest concentration of M2 (50 µM). M2 also exhibited non-
NADPH mediated, time-dependent inhibition of human CYP2B6 with pre-incubation. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Two single-dose toxicity studies were performed with GNX in mice and rats. A non-GLP exploratory 
study was conducted in male mice to evaluate different intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) vehicle 
formulations.  
A pivotal GLP-compliant study with IV administration of GNX formulated in 50% HP-β-CD was 
conducted in rats. Animals dosed with ≥ 2 mg/kg showed immediate ataxia, and with doses ≥ 10 mg/kg 
these animals lost the righting reflex. The incidence, duration, and severity of clinical signs were dose-
dependent and more severe in female rats than in males. These findings were also observed in the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 31/132 
 
 
 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
GNX was initially formulated in oral suspensions containing β-CD and evaluated in repeat-dose 
toxicology studies in mice (1 week, dosing up to 250 mg/kg/day), in rats (up to 6 months, dosing up 
to 400 mg/kg/day) and in dogs (up to 6 months, dosing up to 20 mg/kg/day). In the second stage of 
development, a new formulation - not containing β-CD - was evaluated in repeat-dose toxicology 
studies in mice (2 weeks, dosing up to 1000 mg/kg/day), in rats (4 weeks, dosing up to 80 
mg/kg/day) and in dogs (up to 12 months, dosing up to 15 mg/kg/day) using a preformulated oral 
GNX suspension. This preformulated oral suspension is also used in patients with the intended 
indication. In the third stage, a more aggressive approach to dosing was taken in rodents to 
compensate for the reduced exposure and accommodation of the acute sedation effects. The 
preformulated oral GNX suspension was evaluated in repeat-dose toxicology studies in mice (up to 4 
weeks, dosing up to 1000 mg/kg/day) and in rats (13 weeks, dosing up to 1000 mg/kg/day) in a 
twice-daily dosing (BID) with an incremental dosing strategy. In the fourth stage, an IV formulation of 
GNX was developed. This included repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats (up to 2-weeks, dosing up to 42 
mg/kg/day) and in dogs (up to 4 weeks, dosing up to 7.2 mg/kg/day).  
Findings common to all repeat-dose toxicology studies in mice, rats, and dogs were CNS-related clinical 
signs. The incidence, duration, and severity of sedation signs were dose-dependent, ranging from 
decreased activity to unresponsive, usually within 1-2 hours after dosing, and were usually resolved 
before dosing the next day. Several treatment-related mortalities occurred in all species due to severe 
sedation signs, and the sedation effects were considered dose-limiting. Since these CNS-related clinical 
signs often occurred at the lowest tested dose, no NOAEL for sedation effects was established.  
In rodents, increased liver weights were observed, which was associated with hepatocellular 
hypertrophy. In more recent studies, liver enzyme activity was assessed and demonstrated increased 
CYP450 activity (mainly CYP3A and CYP2B) in GNX-treated rodents compared to control animals. This 
autoinduction of CYP isoenzymes also led to a dose-dependent reduction in GNX exposure with 
repeated dosing in rodents and higher exposures achieved in females compared to males, which 
resulted in females being more sensitive than males in the rodent repeat-dose studies. Additionally, 
increased thyroid gland weights associated with follicular cell hyperplasia were observed in the 13-
week pre-carcinogenicity study and 12-week juvenile toxicity studies. In general, the liver and thyroid 
gland findings are believed to be secondary to the autoinduction of CYP isoenzymes in rodents and are 
considered non-adverse. No findings in the liver and thyroid gland or clear gender differences were 
observed in dogs.  
In dogs, a dose-dependent increase in heart rate observed in the 12-month repeat-dose toxicology 
study (at doses of 3 to 15 mg/kg/day) with the preformulated GNX suspension: average heart rates at 
15 mg/kg/day in the 12-month study were up to 66% higher than those of the control group, which 
were accompanied by a physiologically normal shortening of the PR and QT intervals. Some dogs dosed 
with 10 and at 15 mg/kg/day (4/10 dogs for each dose) had an instance (a single instance in 7/8 
dogs) of transient sinus tachycardia (heart rate greater than 190 bpm). There were no changes in QRS 
duration or QTc interval observed nor any changes in blood pressure parameters. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
GNX was evaluated in a GLP-compliant Ames test, in vitro mouse lymphoma cell mutagenesis assay 
and in vivo micronucleus assay in rats dosed with GNX up to 140 mg/kg, and demonstrated no 
genotoxic potential. 
In addition to GNX, the genotoxic potential of the human metabolite M2 was evaluated in GLP-
compliant in vitro genotoxicity studies. While M2 did not increase the number of revertants in the Ames 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 32/132 
 
 
 
Test, it did increase the incidence of aberrant metaphases in the in vitro mammalian chromosome 
aberration assay.  
A GLP-compliant in vivo genotoxicity assay with doses up to 150 mg/kg/day M2 in female and male rat 
was conducted. This dose was considered the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) based on an exploratory 
Dose Range Finding (DRF) study. Cmax levels were ~7.6-fold higher compared to humans.  
Micronucleus assessment of the bone marrow and a COMET analysis of the liver revealed no genotoxic 
potential of M2. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
A 4-week and 13-week pre-carcinogenicity assays were conducted with GNX in CByB6F1-
Tg[HRAS]2Jic: Wild Type mice and SD rats. 
In the 4-week study in CByB6F1-Tg[HRAS]2Jic: Wild Type mice, all GNX dose groups received 125 mg/kg 
BID for the first 3 days of dosing and then the mid- and high-dose groups received 250 and 500 mg/kg 
BID, respectively, for the remaining 25 days of dosing. Findings were limited to increases in body weight 
gain and food consumption (males only) and non-adverse dose-dependent increases in liver/gall bladder 
weights, which correlated with a significant increase in CYP2B and CYP3A activity. See also repeat dose 
toxicity section above for key findings. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been completed in rats and mice with GNX 
formulations containing β-CD. Juvenile toxicity studies were conducted in rats with both β-CD 
containing formulations and the preformulated GNX suspension.  
One GLP-compliant fertility and early embryonic development study was conducted in rats with doses 
up to 40 mg/kg/day GNX. The sedation effects observed in this study were consistent with the findings 
in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. An increased incidence of extended oestrus cycle was observed in 
females dosed with 40 mg/kg/day, which did not affect other reproductive parameters. No effects on 
the male reproductive system were observed. No adverse findings in the female and male reproductive 
organs were observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs. Therefore, the NOAEL 
for fertility and early embryonic development in rats was considered 40 mg/kg/day. 
One exploratory and one definitive GLP-compliant embryofetal development study were conducted in 
mice with doses up to 300 mg/kg/day GNX. The sedation effects observed in these studies were 
consistent with the findings in the pre-embryofoetal 1-week repeat-dose toxicity study. Dams dosed 
with ≥ 200 mg/kg/day showed reduced bodyweight gain, which was accompanied by reduced food 
intake. GNX elicited no teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or fetotoxicity in mice. Therefore, the maternal 
(excluding sedation effects) and embryo-fetal development NOAELs were considered 175 mg/kg/day 
and 300 mg/kg/day in mice, respectively.  
A GLP-compliant combined embryofoetal- and pre-and postnatal development study was conducted in 
rats with doses up to 40 mg/kg/day GNX. The sedation effects observed in this study were consistent 
with the findings in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. Dams dosed with 40 mg/kg/day showed reduced 
bodyweight gain at gestation days 6-16, which was accompanied by reduced food intake, while, at the 
same dose, approximately half of the animals showed intermittent body tremors whilst the animals 
appeared asleep. A slightly prolonged duration of the pregnancy was observed in these animals. In 
addition, one 10 mg/kg/day and one 40 mg/kg/day females were prematurely sacrificed due to 
dystocia. Dams treated with 20 and 40 mg/kg/day showed an increase in the mean litter percentage 
Assessment report

incidence of foetuses with an additional lumbar rib (24% and 10% at these 2 dosages, respectively 
compared to 5 % in the control group), although there was no dosage-relationship. GNX elicited no 
teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or fetotoxicity in rats. Therefore, the maternal (excluding sedation 
effects) and embryo-fetal development NOAELs were considered 20 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day in 
rats, respectively.    
F1 animals of dams treated with 40 mg/kg/day showed an increased bodyweight directly after birth, 
which was likely related to the prolonged duration of the pregnancy. However, at weaning, these F1 
animals showed reduced bodyweight gain compared to control animals. F1 animals showed delayed 
development (delayed attainment of surface righting reflex and air righting reflex in both sexes and 
delayed attainment of balano-preputial skinfold cleavage in males) but this was likely secondary to 
reduced body weight gain. No effects were observed on the reproductive performance of F1 animals, 
and no abnormalities were found in the F2 generation up to day 20 postpartum. Therefore, in rats, the 
NOAEL for postnatal development was considered 20 mg/kg/day. 
Multiple juvenile toxicity studies have been conducted with oral administration of different GNX 
formulations in neonatal rats (start dosing on PND 7). Oral GNX formulations containing β-CD were 
evaluated in one 2-week exploratory and one definitive GLP-compliant 6-week study with dosing up to 
60 mg/kg/day. The preformulated oral GNX suspension was evaluated in one 3-week exploratory study 
and one definitive GLP-compliant 12-week study with BID dosing up to 500 mg/kg/day. In general, the 
findings with both formulations were consistent and demonstrated similar findings as in adult rats, 
including sedation effects and increased liver and thyroid weights (with histopathological correlates). In 
the 6-week juvenile toxicity study with GNX formulation containing β-CD, a delay in sexual maturation 
(vaginal patency) occurred in females dosed with 50 mg/kg/day.  
A GLP-compliant acute neuropathy study was also conducted in neonatal rats (Study 00398515). On 
PND 7 (the time of the brain growth spurt) the rats were administered the same dose as in the 12-
week juvenile toxicity study (20, 45, and 90 mg/kg/day as divided doses). An increase in 
neurodegeneration occurred in multiple brain regions, consistent with findings from other GABA 
modulators. The incidence, severity, and distribution of the neurodegeneration increased with the GNX 
dose administered on PND 7, with findings at the highest dose comparable to that of the positive 
control, the NMDA antagonist, dizocilpine (MK-801). 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data of GNX in β-CD containing formulations was collected in repeat-dose toxicity studies 
in the rat and dog. In rodents, exposure levels increased with a dose less than dose-proportional. 
Exposure levels decreased over time, suggesting metabolism induction after repeated dosing. In 
addition, females consistently had higher exposure levels compared to male animals. GNX safety 
exposure margins reached 2.08-2.87 fold in rats after 6 months at the highest tested dose of 40 
mg/kg/day. In dogs, exposure levels generally increased in a dose-proportional manner, and no clear 
gender difference was observed. GNX safety exposure margins reached 2.71-4.11 fold in rats after 6 
months at the highest tested dose of 10 mg/kg/day. 
Toxicokinetic data of the preformulated GNX suspension was evaluated in repeat-dose toxicity studies 
in mice, adult and juvenile rats and dogs. Similar trends were observed in these studies, although 
exposure levels in rats were generally lower than those achieved with β-CD containing formulations. 
Therefore, an incremental BID dosing approach was implemented for rodents to offset the anticipated 
liver enzyme induction and avoid overt toxicity. GNX safety exposure margins reached 0.18-0.63 fold 
in mice after 4 weeks at the highest tested dose of 1000 mg/kg/day. In rats, exposure margins 
reached 0.35-1.57 fold in adult rats after 13 weeks at the highest tested dose of 1000 mg/kg/day and 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 34/132 
 
 
 
0.35-0.98 fold in juvenile rats after 12 weeks at the highest tested dose of 500 mg/kg/day. In the 
dogs' 12-month repeat-dose toxicity study, exposure margins reached 6.01-7.85 fold at the highest 
tested dose of 15 mg/kg/day.  
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
GNX was not considered a local irritant when administered IV (1 mg/kg) or perivascular (0.25 mg/kg) 
to the ears of NZW rabbits. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
No studies for antigenicity, immunogenicity, photosafety have been conducted. In agreement with the 
argumentation of the applicant, this is accepted.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
The primary pharmacodynamics in vitro and in vivo studies suggested that GNX acts as a positive 
allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor complex. GNX demonstrated potent, broad, GABAA-
mediated anticonvulsant activity in several types of seizure models tested. The proof of concept that 
GNX is protective of convulsion is adequately demonstrated.  
The evaluation of human major metabolite M2 revealed no agonist, nor antagonistic action on GABAA 
receptors, human progesterone or oestrogen receptors that would suggest relevant secondary 
pharmacology, except for the antagonist activity of M2 at the ERβ receptor with an IC50 of 3.03 µM. 
Consequently, a potential hormonal effect of M2 at levels reached in human plasma cannot be 
excluded. Accordingly, the information regarding these in vitro findings is correctly reflected in section 
5.3 of the SmPC. Long term safety, including sexual maturation and growth, is also listed as safety 
concern/important potential risk in the RMP and will be monitored.  
Overall, the dependence studies suggested that GNX may cause physical and behavioural dependence 
in humans, as evidenced by its reinforcing properties, the sharing of a subjective interoceptive cue 
with benzodiazepines, as well as the presence of a mild withdrawal syndrome.  
In vivo GNX-related effects mainly included dose-dependent sedation, an expected pharmacological 
effect of GNX. GNX had no notable effects in cardiovascular and respiratory studies. Thus, apart from 
the sedation, in vivo studies did not reveal reasons for concern, however it should be noted that clinical 
exposures were not reached in rats. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Gender differences in the metabolic profiles were observed in the preclinical species, caused by a sex 
difference in hepatic expression of the metabolising (CYP) enzymes yielding different metabolite levels 
in female as compared to male rodents. As this large difference in CYP expression is rat specific, the 
impact on the human patient population, especially the adolescent, may be low, although no data are 
available to assess this. 
The observed in vivo metabolism of GNX was complex and showed a 20-keto reduction and/or multiple 
(1-4) hydroxylations followed by subsequent conjugations. A complete overview of all the metabolites 
formed in the different species, including human, is not available and it is not clear which metabolites 
are the most relevant at steady-state. Therefore, the MAH committed to further characterise the GNX 
metabolite pattern at steady state in human (see also clinical pharmacology sections, category 3 study, 
as detailed in the RMP). 
Toxicology 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 36/132 
 
 
 
 
 
The most common finding across all GNX toxicology studies was sedation, an exaggerated 
pharmacologic effect of a GABAA receptor modulator. Some level of sedation (decreased activity, 
ataxia, prostration, etc.) was observed in almost all toxicity studies. The sedation effects were 
reversible and dose-dependent in both incidence and severity. The progression of sedation effects 
tended to follow a stepwise increase in severity, from decreased activity to ataxia to prostration. The 
CNS effects tended to be most severe within the first few hours after a daily dose was administered, 
particularly in the first week of dosing. At lower doses, the CNS effects resolved by the next daily dose, 
suggesting a Cmax-driven effect, and abated with the duration of administration, suggesting 
accommodation to the sedation effects over time. 
Besides the sedation effects, (intermittent) tremors were observed in several toxicity studies in dogs 
and pregnant and juvenile rats. These rare events only occurred at the highest GNX exposures and in 
animals that showed other severe clinical findings. These observations suggest that these adverse 
events were secondary to severe toxicity rather than directly related to the pharmacology of GNX, and 
that the likelihood of their occurrence in clinical subjects receiving therapeutic doses of GNX is low. 
The only other findings outside of the CNS effects were increased liver and thyroid gland weights in 
rodents, at times associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy and follicular cell hyperplasia. There is 
evidence to support that these findings are a result of autoinduction of CYP isoenzymes (particularly 
CYP3A and CYPB2) that occurs in rodents but not in dogs or humans. Increases in liver and thyroid 
weights were greater in females than in males, which is in agreement with a more pronounced 
induction of CYP isoenzymes in females. It is noted however that females achieved higher GNX 
exposure over males, and yet it was also the females that tended to have a greater magnitude of 
reduction in exposure with multiple dosing and higher liver weights. The applicant stated that this 
inconsistency is likely due to male rodents making more CYP3A, which is considered acceptable.  
The results of the studies conducted with preformulated GNX suspensions were consistent with the 
previous repeat-dose toxicology studies (with formulations containing β-CD), except for the additional 
finding of a dose-dependent increase in heart rate with incidences of sinus tachycardia in the 12-month 
repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs. There were no histopathological correlates associated with the 
change in heart rate, and the single-dose cardiovascular safety study in male dogs showed no 
abnormal findings. The CHMP agreed that, taking into account that the safety margins based on Cmax 
were 8-fold fold compared to humans, the human relevance of this finding is likely low.  
Regarding carcinogenicity, the applicant will provide a 26-week carcinogenicity study report in 
transgenic mice (category 3 study with final report expected Q1 2025, as listed in the RMP). The 
applicant also committed to provide a WoE assessment to evaluate the need of a 2-year 
carcinogenicity study in rat (expected Q2 2024 and listed as category 3 studies, as detailed in the 
RMP). This is agreed by the CHMP. 
The sedation effects observed in the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were consistent 
with the findings observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies.  
In the pre-and post-natal development toxicity study in SD rats, dams treated with 20 and 40 
mg/kg/day showed an increase in the mean litter percentage incidence of foetuses with an additional 
lumbar rib (24% and 10% at these 2 dosages respectively compared to 5% in the control group) 
although there was no dosage-relationship. This skeletal finding is likely secondary to maternal 
toxicity, as observed by decreased maternal body weight gain associated with maternal stress. 
Juvenile rats dosed with ≥ 45 mg/kg/day showed decreased bodyweight gain compared to control 
animals. This was also observed in the F1 generation dosed with 40 mg/kg/day in the pre-and 
postnatal development study but not in adult animals. The reduction in body weight gain was seen 
primarily at the highest dose group, and the effects on growth would probably be due to poor health 
Assessment report

Page 37/132 
 
 
 
and long periods of sedation rather than a direct effect of GNX treatment, also considering that no 
effects on femur length were observed in any groups.  
In juvenile rats, no effect on femur length and bone density was observed at doses up to 500 
mg/kg/day.  
In the acute neuropathy study in neonatal rats, the incidence, severity, and distribution of 
neurodegeneration in multiple brain regions increased dose-dependently, starting at the lowest tested 
dose of 20 mg/kg. However, in the 12-week pivotal repeat-dose juvenile toxicity study, there were no 
behavioural changes (motor activity, acoustic startle, learning, or memory) identified at any doses (up 
to 500 mg/kg/day), either during the dosing period or after cessation of dosing. In addition, there were 
no histological changes in the brain after repeated GNX administration. A discussion on the 
neurodegenerative findings with GABAA modulators and NMDA antagonists during the brain growth 
spurt was provided: in contrast to the other agents, treatment-related apoptotic neurodegeneration 
after ganaxolone treatment did not lead to behavioural deficits in juvenile rats. In addition, the timing 
of the brain growth spurt in rats is significantly different compared to humans, indicating that the 
intended target population of 2 years and older are less susceptible to apoptotic neurodegeneration. 
Altogether, the CHMP agreed that the relevance of this finding for humans is low. The findings in 
juvenile animals are adequately reflected in SmPC section 5.3. 
In the 6-week juvenile toxicity study with GNX formulation containing β-CD, a delay in sexual 
maturation (vaginal patency) occurred in females dosed with 50 mg/kg/day. In the second pivotal 12-
week study with the preformulated GNX suspension, a significant delay in sexual maturation was again 
observed in females dosed with ≥ 45 mg/kg/day and females dosed with 20 mg/kg/day also showed a 
slight delay in sexual maturation. Although there was a significant delay in attaining sexual maturation, 
this did not affect oestrous cyclicity or any fertility or reproductive parameters at any doses (up to 500 
mg/kg/day). Even though it was noted that patients with CDD are unlikely to give birth at a later 
stage, the applicant is advised to monitor sexual maturation carefully. The findings in juvenile animals 
are adequately reflected in SmPC section 5.3. 
The metabolite M2 was newly identified in human subjects administered GNX and contributes between 
10% and 20% of total drug-related material in human plasma.  In view of the genotoxicity 
investigation results, the CHMP agreed to conclude that M2 is not genotoxic. 
In a 28-day PK study with ganaxolone in rats, with a dosing regimen reflecting the previously 
conducted studies, M2 levels were 5-10 fold higher in female rats compared to male rats, and 
significantly lower compared to the levels formed in humans.  
For  further  characterization  of  M2,  a  GLP-compliant  4-week  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  rats  was 
performed. Reduced bodyweight gain was observed in males dosed with ≥ 100 mg/kg/day, and in females 
dosed with 150 mg/kg/day, which was accompanied by significant reduced food intake at the highest 
dose level. A dose-dependent decrease in prostate gland weight was observed in males dosed with ≥ 25 
mg/kg/day. This correlated with small prostates which were noted macroscopically in males dosed with 
≥ 100 mg/kg/day. In addition, males dosed with ≥ 100 mg/kg/day M2 had small seminal vesicle glands. 
Related microscopic changes included acinar atrophy and decreased secretion in the prostate glands and 
seminal vesicle glands, with a dose-dependent increase in incidence and severity. Additionally, decreased 
epididymis  weight  was  observed  in  males  dosed  with  ≥   100  mg/kg/day,  without  histopathological 
correlates.  The  applicant  states  that  the  finding  in  the  prostate  and  seminal  vesicles  gland  could  be 
associated with the decrease in bodyweight gain in animals dosed with ≥ 100 mg/kg/day, however that 
a  treatment-related  effect  cannot  be  excluded.  Also,  microscopic  findings  in  the  prostate  gland  were 
already observed at the lowest tested dose where no effect on bodyweight was noted. In females dosed 
with  ≥   50  mg/kg/day,  a  dose-dependent  increase  in  incidence  of  hepatocellular  hypertrophy  was 
observed, and females dosed with 150 mg/kg/day had increased relative weight of the liver. This was

not  observed  in  male  animals  and  could  be  due  to  induction  of  xenobiotic-metabolizing  enzymes, 
however  this  was  not  determined.  In  view  of  these  findings,  no  NOAEL  could  be  established.    The 
applicant also provided a preliminary summary of a 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, in which 
animals were given 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day M2 per oral administration. In general, similar findings as 
in the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study were observed. Since the clinical relevance of these findings 
remains unclear, the applicant commits to provide the final results of the 6-month repeat-dose toxicity 
in rats with M2 post-approval (category 3 study, as listed in the RMP) and will perform an embryofetal 
developmental  toxicity  study  (category  3  study,  as  listed  in  the  RMP).  These  findings  are  adequately 
described in the SmPC section 5.3. 
Furthermore, the applicant commits to perform a weight-of-evidence (WoE) assessments for the need 
for  a  2-year  carcinogenicity  study  in  rat  with  GNX  and  M2,  and  for  juvenile  toxicity  study  with  M2 
(category 3 studies, as listed in the RMP). 
Regarding the environmental risk assessment, no risk to surface water, groundwater, soil and the STP 
is expected. However, in order to complete the ERA regarding the sediment compartment, the 
applicant agrees to provide the OECD 218 study report and updated risk assessment post-approval.  
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The marketing authorisation application for ganaxolone is considered approvable from a non-clinical 
point of view.  
The relevant non-clinical information is appropriately reflected in the Product Information.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
- Submission of a 26-week GNX and M2 carcinogenicity study report in transgenic mice 
- Submission of the final results of the 6-month repeat-dose toxicity in rats with M2 
- Submission of an embryofetal developmental toxicity study with M2 
- Submission of a WoE assessment reports regarding the need of a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rat 
with GNX and M2 (6 and applicant 7) 
- Submission of a WoE assessment report for a juvenile toxicity study for M2 
In addition, the applicant agrees to complete post-approval the ERA sediment compartment study and 
update the ERA accordingly.

Population PK studies 
Two population PK analysis studies were conducted, Study 1042-CDD-POPPK-001 and 09-0600-POP-
PK-01. 
1042-CDD-POPPK-001  
The population PK-study 1042-CDD-POPPK-001 was conducted to estimate the exposure in paediatric 
patients. Data from 3 clinical studies was included in the analysis (Study 1042 0900 (Phase 2a), Study 
1042 CDD-3001 (Phase 3) and GNX alone treatment arms of Study 1042 DDI 1001 (Phase 1)). 
Overall, the population PK analysis included 146 subjects and 694 PK observation records. Covariates 
tested included age, sex, race, height, body weight, body mass index, body surface area, albumin, 
ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin, and creatinine clearance (1042 CDD POPPK 001). The most apparent 
correlations between covariates were measures of body size: weight, height, BMI, BSA, and age all 
showed correlations > 0.5. 
Figure 2 shows individual measurable plasma drug concentration versus time after dose (semi-log), 
coloured by study.  
The blue dots concern data in paediatric patients with CDD (Study 1042 CDD-3001). Exploratory 
analysis showed that GNX appears to exhibit multi-compartment kinetics and that concentrations in 
paediatric patients were of similar magnitude as observed in healthy volunteers in Study 1042-DDI-
1001.

Figure 2: GNX Concentration versus Time Since Last Dose  
Although the prediction-corrected VPCs suggest some over-prediction of the GNX concentrations for 
paediatric subjects from 0 to 4 hours post-dose, likely due to the sparse data in paediatric and a 
structural trend in the elimination phase, the base population PK model was considered the best model 
for the data and fit-for-purpose for estimating the exposure in paediatric subjects.

Simulated GNX profiles were generated using the final population PK model for four different age 
groups: 2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, 12 to <18 years, and ≥ 18 years. The median weight for the 
subjects in each age group category in the analysis dataset was used for the simulations. Doses of 63 
mg/kg/day up to 1800 mg were administered until steady-state was achieved. The maximum GNX 
concentration, minimum GNX concentration, and 24-hour area under the GNX plasma concentration-
time curve were calculated at steady-state. 
09-0600-POP-PK-01 
Population PK-study 09-0600-POP-PK-01 was conducted in 2009 to develop a model to describe the 
population pharmacokinetics of ganaxolone in adult patients with partial-onset seizures and to identify 
sources of inter-individual variability in the pharmacokinetics of ganaxolone. Pharmacokinetic data 
from the phase 2 study 1042-0600 were included in this older version of the pop PK model. 
The model included a covariate “inducer category” representing concomitant Anti-seizure medications 
(ASM) metabolic classification. Concomitant ASMs were classified under the following categories: 
inducers and non-inducers of CYP. Phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital were classified as 
general inducers. All other ASMs were classified as non-inducers.

Figure 4: Steady-state ganaxolone plasma concentrations versus time in adult with refractory epilepsy; 
patients with concomitant carbamazepine or phenytoin or both medications are designated as inducer 
while patients with other concomitant anti-epileptic medications are classified as non-inducer 
Plasma concentration-time data for this analysis were obtained from 94 adult subjects, with a total of 
442 observations used. Approximately six plasma samples were collected from each patient. 
Formulation development  
As GNX is poorly soluble, several different GNX oral formulations were tested to find a formulation that 
results in an adequate and predictable absorption of GNX. The final formulation is a GNX oral 
suspension, 50 mg/mL. 
The applicant evaluated the effect of particle size distribution on PK using the data of four different 
studies (1042-CDD-3001, 1042-0900, 1042-HAP-1001 and 1042-DDI-1001) and a more detailed 
analysis of data from study 1042-HAP-1001.  
Several studies were conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of different formulations. The most 
relevant comparative studies are study 1042-0118 and 1042-0106.01. In these studies, the relative 
bioavailability of a nanosized GNX suspension was compared to other solid GNX formulations when 
administered following a standardized meal. Based on the biopharmaceutical studies, the applicant 
concluded that the hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) tablet and suspension formulation have a 
favourable absorption profile with a tmax of approximately 2.5 hours.  
Absorption 
The PK of GNX in humans have been investigated in both single- and multiple-dose studies. Clinical 
trials were conducted with several formulations to determine the effects of food, gender, and rising-
dose exposures.  
Co-administration of the to-be-marketed ganaxolone oral suspension with a high-fat meal increased 
Cmax by 2-fold and AUC by 3-fold compared to fasted levels (study 1042-0400). Following oral 
administration, GNX is rapidly absorbed without the involvement of active transport proteins. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 46/132 
 
 
 
 
maximum concentration is observed at a median tmax of 1.25 hours after single dosing and about 2 -3 
hours at a steady state. A steady-state is achieved within 2 to 3 days.  
Ganaxolone undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, the oral bioavailability of ganaxolone following 
administration of the suspension formulation at a dose level of 600 mg is approximately 13%.  
The population PK model (1042-CDD-POPPK-001) was used to simulate GNX steady-state exposure 
data of the GNX suspension, 600mg TID in paediatric and adult CDD Patients; the steady-state 
exposure (AUC0-24) relevant for safety is approximately 4100 ng*hr/mL, and the maximum 
concentration (Cmax,ss) is approximately 300 ng/mL. Simulated GNX profiles were generated using the 
population PK model for 4 different age groups: 2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, 12 to < 18 years, and 
≥ 18 years.  
Doses of 63 mg/kg/day up to 1800 mg were administered until steady-state was achieved. At steady-
state, the GNX Cmax, Cmin, and AUC0-24 were calculated (see Table 5).

Distribution 
Ganaxolone is extensively distributed throughout the body. Ganaxolone is approximately 99% protein-
bound in serum. Ganaxolone demonstrated high binding to plasma proteins in human, rat, and dog 
plasma after both 4- and 8-hour incubations. Ganaxolone gave mean fu values of <0.001 and 0.01 in 
the presence of human, plasma respectively, in a 4-hour and 8-hour incubation, respectively. 
Study 1042-C14GNX-lac-1001 suggests extensive distribution into the tissues and a slow release of 
GNX and metabolites from the tissues. The apparent volume of distribution of GNX based on the 
average of all cohorts from IV study 1042-0405 approximates 800 L (using IV doses in the range of 
10-86 mg), which confirms extensive distribution into tissues. 
In study OPT-2016-063, Ganaxolone did not appear to be a substrate of any of the investigated 
transporters (BCRP, P-gp, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3). 
Elimination 
GNX is rapidly and extensively metabolised with a t1/2 of about 4.5 hours, with negligible excretion of 
unchanged drug in urine and faeces. A terminal half-life (t½) of 7.8 to 10.1 hours was observed at 
steady state. The levels of total radioactivity appeared to decline slowly in a multiphasic manner with 
an arithmetic mean t1/2 of 413 hours in both mass balance studies. The excretion of the radioactivity 
was slow; this could be due to the slow release of GNX and/or metabolites from the tissues. This is 
supported by the milk excretion study and as the GNX half-life increases with the dose without

apparent increase of exposure. The total amount of radioactivity excreted in faeces and urine was 
65.60 – 72.83% and 21.07 – 30.9%, respectively. 
A milk excretion study 1042-C14GNX-lac-1001 was conducted in five healthy adult lactating women 
treated with a 300 mg oral dose of ganaxolone. Concentrations of ganaxolone in breast milk were 
approximately 4-fold higher than in plasma. The calculated maximum relative infant dose for 
ganaxolone is approximately 0.157 mg/kg/day based on an average milk intake of 150 mL/kg/day, 
which is less than 1% of the maternal dose and approximately 0.24% of the labelled paediatric dose of 
63 mg/kg/day.  
Mass balance and metabolic profiling indicate that GNX is extensively metabolized to multiple steroid 
metabolites, including metabolites with a very long half-life (up to 230 hours). These metabolites can 
be expected to accumulate at steady state, especially as GNX is administered three times daily. Due to 
accumulation, the main metabolites at steady state may differ from those following a single dose. 
Different names were used for the metabolites of GNX and metabolite identification data differ between 
studies. 
In vitro studies suggest that Ganaxolone is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 
CYP3A5. CYP2B6, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 may be involved to a much lesser extent.  
In the presence of recombinant enzymes, ganaxolone was a substrate for UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and 
UGT2B7. Metabolic profiling studies suggest multiple metabolic routes: oxidation, dehydrogenation, 
hydrogenation, sulphation and glucuronidation have been observed.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The single-dose pharmacokinetics of GNX, following the administration of escalation dose levels of GNX 
Oral Suspension, was investigated under high fat, fed conditions in study 1042-HAP-1001.

Several early studies investigated the pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of GNX. These studies 
include study 1042-0404, which evaluated the PK of GNX following multiple doses of GNX capsules at 
a dose level of 600, 800, and 1000 mg BID. Steady state was reached within 3 days of administration. 
Data suggest that over the dose range of 600 to 1000 mg BID under fed conditions, exposure to GNX 
increases less than proportionally with increases in dose, with this disproportionality being more 
pronounced at the high end of the dose range.

Less than proportional PK was also observed for early GNX HPMC tablets formulation in the higher 
doses of 1200-1600mg (study 1042-0115)  
About dose-proportional PK was observed in study 1042-0403, following single and multiple doses of 
early GNX capsules in the 200mg-600mg dose range and in CA042 9301.01, for early GNX β-CD 
complex suspension formulation in the 50mg-600mg dose range. 
Multiple-dose data from study 1042-0403, with GNX capsule formulation at doses of 200, 400, and 
600 mg BID, showed that steady-state was achieved within 48 hours and accumulation for AUC0-12 was 
approximately 43 to 81%, yielding an effective t½ with BID dosing of 7 to 10 hours. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment Study 1042-IRF-1001 assessed the PK and safety and tolerability of adult subjects 
with normal renal function and severe renal impairment. Renal impairment had no impact on the 
exposure of ganaxolone; a single dose of ganaxolone 300 mg was well tolerated in adults with normal 
and severe renal impairment.  
Subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment were excluded from the Phase 3 clinical trials. 
Hepatic impairment study 1042-IHF-1001 evaluated the influence of hepatic impairment on the PK of 
ganaxolone. Patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment had an approximately 6-fold 
increase in AUC as compared to those with normal hepatic function. The impact of mild hepatic 
impairment could be considered negligible ((1.2 fold increase in AUC). In patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment, a 1.7 fold increase in AUC has been observed.  
Studies in healthy subjects have not shown a gender effect for PK with early GNX formulations in 
studies CA042-9501.01 and CA042-9505.01.  
The eldest patient included in the CDD trials was 19 years, but many adults were included in other 
clinical trials. The pharmacokinetics in the elderly was not discussed.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Study 1042-DDI-1001 assessed the effects of strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole (200mg QD for 11 
days) and strong inducer rifampin (600mg QD, fasting conditions) on the pharmacokinetics of GNX 
under fed conditions. Concomitant coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole 
increased GNX exposure (AUC0-inf) by 17%. Multiple doses of rifampicin, a potent inducer of multiple 
metabolic pathways, decreased GNX AUCs by approximately 57-68% and Cmax by approximately 57%. 
This is in line with the importance of metabolism as an elimination route of GNX and the induction of 
enzymes by rifampicin. 
Study 1042-0402 assessed the effects of GNX (400mg BID) on the pharmacokinetics of probe CYP3A4 
substrate midazolam (2mg). There was a minor influence of the pharmacokinetics of midazolam; the 
AUC0-inf ratio (90%CI) for GNX+ MDZ/ MDZ was 86.7 (67.7, 111.1). 
The  drug-drug  interaction  between  GNX  and  anti-seizures  was  evaluated  using  sparse  sampling  data 
from  study  1042-600,  data  were  analysed  in  popPK  study  09-0600-POP-PK-01.  Concomitant 
administration  of  CYP3A4-inducing  anti-seizures  (carbamazepine,  phenytoin,  and  phenobarbital) 
resulted in approximately 40% lower plasma exposures of GNX, as compared to subjects not receiving 
strong inducers. These results are in line with the results of the DDI study with CYP inducer rifampicin.

Ganaxalone as a substrate 
Ganaxolone, at a concentration of 0.12 µM was rapidly metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 
and CYP3A5 in study 199N-0501. Study XT154127 confirmed that GNX at a concentration range of 1, 
10, and 100 µM is primarily metabolised by Cyp 3A4/5 or GNX. This study showed that also CYP2B6, 
CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 may be involved to a much lesser extent. GNX was not a substrate for CYP1A2, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2E1. 
Study 11042.HR.IT.95.09 investigated the effects of the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole on the 
metabolism of the GNX in human and rat liver microsomes. Ketoconazole inhibited NADPH-dependent 
oxidation of [3H] GNX in human microsomes by 89.8%. 
In studies OPT-2016-063 and OPT-2016-020, ganaxolone did not appear to be a substrate of any of 
the investigated transporters. Ganaxolone, at concentrations of 1, 3, and 10 μM, was not a substrate 
of human BCRP, P-gp, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3.  
Ganaxolone is a substrate for UGT1A3, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B15. No formal drug-drug 
interaction studies have been conducted with ganaxolone in combination with UGT inhibitors such as 
valproate 
The effect of valproic acid, at concentrations of 20-200 µg/mL, on protein binding of ganaxolone, was 
evaluated in study C1042.361.056. There were no significant differences in the percentages of free and 
bound GNX in the presence or absence of valproic acid. The average percent of free GNX over all 
conditions was 0.86%, and the average percent bound was 99.14%. 
Ganaxalone as a perpetrator 
In studies OPT-2016-063 and OPT-2016-020, ganaxolone did not appear to be an inhibitor of any of 
the investigated transporters. Ganaxolone, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 30 µM, was not an 
inhibitor or inducer of the transporters BCRP, P-gp, MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BSEP. 
In study XT155147 with ganaxolone, at concentrations ranging from 0.003 - 1 mM, some direct 
inhibition of CYP2C8 (21%), CYP2D6 (24%), and CYP3A4/5 (as measured by midazolam 1′-
hydroxylation; 27%) was observed; however, the IC50 values were reported as > 30 µM, the highest 
concentration of GNX tested. No evidence of direct inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or 
CYP3A4/5 (as measured by testosterone 6β-hydroxylation) was observed and GNX not appear to cause 
time dependent or metabolism dependent inhibition of any the CYP450 isoenzymes evaluated. 
In study XT153121 with ganaxolone, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 30 µM, GNX caused 
increases in CYP2B6 activity and mRNA levels in all 3 hepatocyte preparations. Activity levels were

increased up to 6.89 fold and were 32.4% of the positive control response. While GNX had little or no 
effect on CYP3A4/5 activity, it did cause concentration-dependent increases in CYP3A4 mRNA levels in 
all 3 hepatocyte preparations. CYP3A4 mRNA levels were increased up to 52 fold and were 32.2% of 
the positive control response. The responses were concentration-dependent in 2 of 3 hepatocyte 
preparations. GNX had little or no effect (ie, < 2- fold change and/or < 20% of the positive control 
response) on CYP1A2 activity and mRNA levels. Based on this study it was concluded that GNX is a 
potential in vivo inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. 
Study 11042.HM.VT.94.08 evaluated the potential for GNX (at concentrations of 2 and 20 µM) to have 
an effect on the metabolism of Anti-seizure medications carbamazepine (50μM or 500 μM), phenytoin 
(100 μM) , phenobarbitone (340 μM), valproic acid (0.7 mM or 3.5 mM), and ethosuximide (0.5 mM 
and 1 mM), and conversely, the potential for these same Anti-seizure medications (at concentrations 
equivalent to their maximum therapeutic plasma range) to affect the metabolism of GNX, in human 
liver microsomes. At the tested concentrations, none of the 5 anti-seizure agents significantly inhibited 
or activated the metabolism of [3H]-GNX in human liver microsomes. Carbamazepine metabolism was 
increased by 20 µM GNX, but not 2 µM GNX. When carbamazepine at concentrations of 50 and 500 µM 
was incubated with 20 µM GNX the metabolism of carbamazepine was increased by 2 to 4-fold and 
1.5-fold, respectively. GNX inhibited the metabolism of phenytoin by up to 55% and 23% in male and 
female liver microsomes, respectively. GNX had no significant effect on the metabolism of valproic 
acid. An assessment of the effect of GNX on the metabolism of ethosuximide and phenobarbitone was 
not possible. 
Study 11042.HM.IT.95.04 evaluated the potential for GNX (0.5 µCi of [3H]-GNX) to have an effect on 
the metabolism of the steroids [14C] progesterone 250 nM, [14C] oestradiol 150 µM, and [14C] 
norgestrel 100 µM in human liver microsomes. GNX did not inhibit the metabolism of progesterone, but 
there were minor changes in the metabolite profile that accounted for less than 2% of the overall 
metabolism. Progesterone was a weak competitive inhibitor of GNX, with an inhibition constant of 
approximately 30 µM. Since oestradiol and norgestrel were not significantly metabolized by the human 
liver microsomes, the potential for GNX to inhibit their metabolism could not be assessed. Oestradiol 
and norgestrel did not significantly affect the metabolism of GNX. 
In vitro study CYP2472_R2 showed that GNX did not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 
up to concentrations of 100 µM. Some inhibition of UGT1A3 and UGT1A4 was observed, at a clinically 
relevant concentration of 40 µM the UGT activity was decreased by approximately 50%. In the 
presence of recombinant enzymes, ganaxolone was a substrate for UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7. 
In in vitro study B21A34-R GNX inhibited Estrogen sulfotransferase (SULT1E1) with an IC50 of 2.2 µM. 
At clinically relevant doses the unbound plasma concentrations of GNX is less than 0.01 µM 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
GNX is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors located in the CNS. GNX and benzodiazepines 
positively modulate synaptic GABAA receptors comprised of α and γ subunits (Campo-Soria et al., 
2006). However, GNX acts via a distinct binding site on the GABAA receptor and, unlike 
benzodiazepines, also modulates extrasynaptic GABAA receptors that are comprised of α and δ subunits 
(Belelli et al., 2006; Belelli and Lambert, 2005).  
GNX potentiates GABAergic transmission at nanomolar concentrations and acts as a direct agonist at 
micromolar levels (Reddy 2019).

Synaptic GABAA receptors mediate phasic inhibitory neurotransmission, whereas extra-synaptic 
receptors are involved in maintaining tonic inhibitory currents. Synaptic GABAA receptors internalize 
and become unresponsive with seizure and also downregulate and become unresponsive with chronic 
administration of benzodiazepines. In contrast, extrasynaptic GABAA receptors maintain their activity 
after seizure and remain responsive with chronic GNX treatment (Reddy and Rogawski, 2000). 
In addition to their anticonvulsant effects, GNX and related neurosteroids may have a neuroprotective 
activity, particularly relevant to CDD. Research has provided evidence on the role of CDKL5 in the 
normal growth and structure of neurons and that mutations in CDKL5 responsible for CDD cause 
neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Moreover, certain neurosteroids may play a role in the repair of 
neuronal damage caused by CDKL5 mutations (Barbiero et al., 2020; Barbiero et al., 2017). 
Specifically, normal dynamics of the neuronal cytoskeleton require interaction between CDKL5 and a 
GTPase--activating protein, IQGAP1, which controls cellular activities dependent on actin and proteins 
affecting microtubule tracking. A deficiency of CDKL5 displaces IQGAP1 from migrating cells and 
impairs its ability to interact with the CLIP170. This results in the inability of CLIP170 to guide neuronal 
microtubules within cells and, thereby, disrupts the normal migration of neurons. CLIP170 is a cellular 
target of pregnenolone, a neurosteroid precursor to allopregnanolone (the endogenous analogue of 
GNX). Pregnenolone induces a conformational change in CLIP170, restoring its affinity to microtubules 
and rescuing neuronal migration defects resulting from CDKL5 deficiency. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Study 1042-0405 investigated the safety, PK, and PD of intravenous (IV) ganaxolone administered as 
an ascending bolus dosing (Stage 1) and as a bolus dosing followed by a continuous infusion (Stage 2) 
in healthy subjects. 
The primary objective of this clinical study was to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of IV 
ganaxolone administered as a bolus dose and continuous infusion in healthy subjects. The secondary 
objectives were to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) effect on EEG parameters, to evaluate the PD 
effect on Bispectral Index (BIS) parameters, to evaluate the effect on clinical sedation scores and on 
ventilatory parameters. 
A total of 36 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study, 30 subjects into Stage 1 and 6 subjects 
into Stage 2. 
In Cohort A there was no significant change in BIS values following the 10 mg bolus. Following the 30 
mg bolus the BIS showed a significant decrease by 5 minutes (median value 54), which recovered to 
80 by 30 minutes postdose and remained at that value by the end of the monitoring period of 60 
minutes (median value 82). 
In Cohort B with 20 mg bolus over 2 minutes, the median BIS values showed a rapid decline to 81 at 5 
minutes, maintained until 45 minutes with a gradual recovery approaching baseline at 60 minutes (BIS 
value 89). 
In Cohort C with 30 mg infusion over 60 minutes, BIS showed an initial change at 15 minutes postdose 
(median BIS value 84) with a further decline to a nadir of median BIS value 70 by 60 minutes 
postdose. Once the infusion was discontinued at 60 minutes, the BIS remained low (median BIS value 
70 at 75 minutes) with gradual recovery to baseline values at 2 hours post-dose. 
In Cohort D with 10 mg infusion over 60 minutes, the BIS values exhibited a similar pattern to those in 
Cohort C but to a lesser extent. The nadir of the curve at 75 minutes post-dose had a median BIS 
value of 78, and recovery to baseline value was attained by 90 minutes post-dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 55/132 
 
 
 
In Stage 2 Cohort A with an initial bolus of 6 mg over 5 minutes followed by a 4-hour infusion of 20 
mg/h, the BIS values showed an initial decline at 5 minutes with a further decrease in median values 
by 15 minutes. The median BIS values were then maintained between mid-60 to mid-70 values for the 
duration of the infusion. Following discontinuation of the infusion, the BIS values showed an initial 
recovery (median BIS value of 82 at 255 minutes) with a return to baseline values by 270 minutes 
post-dose. 
The median MOAA/S scores remained unchanged throughout all dosing cohorts. 
Quantitative EEG: Overall, the changes seemed most evident in cohort 1B where a bolus infusion was 
administered over 2 minutes rather than slower infusions. The mean alpha/delta ratio and spectral 
edge frequency appeared more informative than alpha power, and these parameters had a temporal 
inverse relationship with the BIS. Taken together, these 3 qEEG measures suggest that at low doses of 
ganaxolone, faster EEG frequencies increase (increase in relative alpha power, alpha/delta ratio and 
spectral edge frequency). With a higher dose (30 mg), delta frequencies increase (relative alpha power 
and alpha/delta ratio decrease after initial increase). However, no firm conclusions can be made since 
a control group was not present in Stage 1 Cohort A or Stage 2 Cohort A, and the number of subjects 
(active and control) were small.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Study 1042-HAP-1001 was a single-centre, randomized, DB, double-dummy, placebo- and active-
controlled, 5-way crossover study to evaluate the abuse potential (primary endpoint) of single oral 
doses of GNX compared with single oral doses of lorazepam and PBO in healthy, male and female, non-
dependent, recreational CNS depressant users. In addition, PK, safety, and tolerability (all secondary 
endpoints) of single oral doses of GNX were evaluated. Part A of the study was the dose selection, and 
Part B was the main study. In the dose selection part, sequential escalating doses of GNX were 
administered, with a wash-out period of 5 days between doses. Three dose levels were tested: 
1000mg, 1500mg and 2000mg GNX. The positive control was lorazepam 6 mg. 
Each dose of ganaxolone produced responses that showed less abuse potential than lorazepam 6 mg. 
The lower limits of the 1-sided 95% CIs for comparing lorazepam 6 mg with ganaxolone were 14.3, 
12.5, and 8.0 for ganaxolone 400, 800 and 2000 mg, respectively (all P < 0.0001). Ganaxolone 400 
mg produced responses that showed similar abuse potential compared to placebo, with a difference of 
less than 11 points (upper CI limit of 8.8; P = 0.0072). However, ganaxolone 800 and 2000 mg each 
produced responses that could not be considered similar to those of placebo as they exceeded the 
prespecified margin of 11 (upper CI limits of 17.0 [P = 0.5000] and 19.0 [P = 0.6864], respectively).  
Ganaxolone 400 mg was not significantly different from placebo on key secondary endpoints (Overall 
Drug Liking VAS Emax and Take Drug Again VAS Emax), but did show significantly greater positive, 
sedative, and other effects compared to placebo. Ganaxolone 800 and 2000 mg showed significantly 
greater effects than placebo on the key secondary endpoints and measures of positive, sedative, and 
other drug effects. Ganaxolone was not associated with significant negative effects at any dose level.  
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Methods 
Bioanalytical methods: The bioanalytical methods used have been adequately described and 
appropriately validated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 56/132 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis and statistical methods: Appropriate single and multiple-dose 
parameters were determined, and acceptable statistical methods have been used to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics of GNX.  
Population PK study methodology: The applicant presented two population PK analysis studies. 
Population PK-study 1042 CDD POPPK 001 was used to simulate steady-state PK parameters of 
ganaxolone suspension for the proposed dose regimen in the paediatric CDD population and in healthy 
paediatric and adult subjects. Although the model may be considered fit-for-purpose for estimating the 
exposure in paediatric subjects, the PopPK predictions cannot be considered accurate. Simulated PK 
parameters are indicative and the model could not be used for dosing selection or dosing 
recommendation in the target population. 
Population PK-study 09-0600-POP-PK-01 had several major methodological drawbacks, as only 
based on one study with sparse sampling and different estimated model parameters than model 1042 
CDD POPPK 001, the model appeared to describe the data in the study reasonably well. Therefore, 
this model may only be used for estimating the effect of CYP3A*-inducing comedication on GNX PK. 
Nevertheless, based on this study, it may be concluded that ganaxolone oral clearance was increased 
by approximately 40% in patients taking either carbamazepine or phenytoin or both drugs. 
Formulation development 
An oral suspension formulation was selected as the final formulation, this formulation is considered an 
age and disease appropriate for the intended patient population.  
Different formulations have been studied during the development of the ganaloxone suspension. In 
phase 2 and 3 studies, HPMC GNX tablet and capsule formulations or GNX β-CD complex suspension 
were used. The bioavailability and the food effect differ between formulations, and no direct 
comparison of the suspension and any other solid GNX formulations has been made. Comparison of the 
different formulations is solely based on cross-study comparison as appropriate bridging data are not 
available. 
As the pharmacokinetics of the historical β CD formulations have been characterised extensively, 
across study comparison can be made. The bioavailability of GNX β-CD complex suspension 
formulation was higher than the bioavailability of the to-be-marketed HPMC oral suspension under 
high-fat conditions; however, the variability of the GNX β-CD complex suspension formulation was also 
higher due to a larger food effect. Because the exposure was generally higher for the historical β CD 
complex suspension compared to the 50 mg/mL oral suspension formulation, the pooled safety 
analysis is not expected to underestimate the safety of GNX due to the inclusion of these early trials.  
Two comparative bioavailability studies (1042-0118 and 1042-0106.01) investigated the PK of 
nanoparticle-sized GNX suspensions and other solid GNX formulations. However, these studies were 
not intended to provide performance and bioavailability characteristics of the proposed commercial 
formulation and are not intended for bridging. There is therefore no formal bridging data. 
Despite considerable differences between formulations across studies, the studies with historical 
formulations can be considered supportive, provided that the interpretation of the clinical results of the 
studies with different formulations is made with caution. The applicant has simulated the steady state 
exposure in adults and children based using pop PK model 1042 CDD POPPK 001 which included data 
of the Phase 1 studies with the final suspension formulation. 
The HPMC suspension formulation was selected as the final formulation. The applicant appropriately 
explained that this formulation was selected as it had the most consistent exposure and least 
variability with food intake. Further, the applicant explained that the suspension formulation is 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 57/132 
 
 
 
appropriate for young children and adults with CDD because motor impairments (including dysphagia) 
are common in these patients.  
Although, data are difficult to compare due to the non-linearity of the higher doses and the different 
dose regimens used (BID vs TID), the steady-state exposure is expected to be about 25% higher with 
the GNX oral suspension, based on the comparison between population simulations and the multiple-
dose studies conducted with different formulations and doses.  
Absorption  
For the adults, there are no multiple-dose steady-state PK parameters, for the to-be marketed GNX 
oral suspension at the 600mg TID dose regimen. The pharmacokinetics of the GNX oral suspension at 
a dose of 600mg TID (or maximum paediatric TID dose) has been simulated in population PK study 
1042-CDD-POPPK-001. However only two adult patients with a low mean weight of 35 kg and aged 
19 years were included in the population dataset. When the model was used to simulate the 
pharmacokinetics of GNX600mg TID, for a 70kg adult, the exposure was much lower than for the 
highest dose in paediatric patients.  Therefore, PopPK model 1042-CDD-POPPK-001 cannot not be used 
to simulate PK data for 70kg adults. 
No formal absolute bioavailability study was conducted. The bioavailability of the to –be- marketed 
suspension formulation has been calculated based on the results of DDI Study 1042 DDI-1001, and the 
results of Study 1042-0405, with IV ganaxolone. The oral bioavailability (F) of the suspension 
formulation, at a dose level of 600 mg, is approximately 13%. 
Studies have shown that the impact of food is formulation dependent. Ganaxolone is a lipophilic steroid 
drug and its bioavailability of ganaxolone increases under fed conditions. Data appear to suggest that 
the release of bile salts facilitates the absorption of ganaxolone. Study 1042-0400 showed that 
administration of the commercial formulation 400 mg GNX suspension 50 mg/mL after a high-fat meal 
increased plasma concentrations and exposure about 2 to 3-fold as compared with the fasted state. 
The tmax and the elimination half-life of GNX were not significantly affected.  
Moreover, study CA042-9401.01, conducted with GNX capsules, points out that the type of food may 
be relevant for the absorption of GNX. It was observed that the peak plasma GNX levels following a 
high-fat meal were 3 times higher than those observed following a high carbohydrate meal and nearly 
12 times higher than those observed following an overnight fast. This study indicates that the type of 
food may be relevant for the absorption of GNX and may be a source of variability in daily practice. It 
is unclear if the type of meal has an effect on the PK of the to-be-registered GNX suspension 
formulation. As the effect of different types of food is not known, a statement that Ztalmy should be 
administered with similar types of feed if possible is included in the SmPC. 
Elimination and metabolism 
Mass balance and metabolic profiling data indicate that GNX is extensively metabolized to multiple 
steroid metabolites, including metabolites with a very long half-life.  
Based on single dose mass balance study 1042-GNX.AME-1001 was concluded that metabolites Oxy-
didehydro-ganaxolone (M60b = M2) and potentially also oxy-dehydro-ganaxolone sulfate (M43 = M17) 
are contributing to the long half-life of the radioactivity and, therefore, probably, the most important 
metabolites at steady state. 
The metabolites that were identified as main metabolites in the steady state study 8333043 
(ganaxolone+O+gluc and ganaxolone+2O) were apparently not evaluated in long term toxicity studies 
in animals.  
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 58/132 
 
 
 
Only metabolite M2 is considered appropriately characterized at steady state. The other steady state 
metabolites of ganaxolone have not been appropriately characterized. Additional characterisation work 
is ongoing for M43 = M17.  
The applicant commits to provide the results of the additional characterisation of the metabolite 
M43=M17 (category 3 study, as defined in the RMP). The applicant also commits to characterise the 
GNX metabolite pattern at steady state (category 3 study, as defined in the RMP). 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
The proposed dose of GNX ranges from 150 mg to 600 mg TID (450-1800mg daily) for adults. Dose 
proportionality of the to-be-marketed 50 mg/ml suspension formulation has been investigated over a 
range of 400-2000 mg. Less than proportional PK is observed with high doses of ganaxolone 
suspension (doses of 1000 mg or more). As ganaxolone did not appear to be a substrate for any of the 
investigated transporters in vitro study OPT-2016-063, low solubility is the most likely cause. 
In studies with early formulations (GNX HPMC tablets, GNX capsules and GNX β-CD complex 
suspension formulation), dose-proportional PK was observed for doses up to 600mg GNX. Data suggest 
that over the dose range of 600 to 1000 mg BID under fed conditions, exposure to GNX increases less 
than proportionally with increases in dose, with this disproportionality being more pronounced at the 
high end of the dose range. Based on the totality of data, it is expected that the pharmacokinetics of 
the to-be-marketed 50mg/ml suspension will be approximately dose-proportional in the clinical dose 
range of 150-600mg for adults.  
In the pop PK model, saturable absorption for paediatric patients was included. Saturable absorption 
was only included in the popPK model for paediatric patients and not for adults, although less than 
dose proportional PK has been observed in adults in several clinical trials. The highest proposed dose 
given may be larger than the maximum absorbed dose, even for adults. Bodyweight is apparently an 
explanation for differences between subjects in the degree of saturable absorption. No changes in the 
posology are however needed as the GNX dose is titrated based on effect and tolerability.  
Based on population PK analysis simulations, the estimated AUC0-8 is approximately 1550 ng*hr/mL for 
the 600mg TID dose in 70kg adult patients at steady state and 2310 ng*hr/mL for the 21 mg/kg in 
paediatric subjects of 2-6 years old. The estimated accumulation is about 1.6-fold for the TID dose 
regimen. The simulated exposure was much higher in paediatric patients when compared to adults. 
Pharmacokinetics of Ganaxolone in Adults and Children 
The eldest patient included in the CDD trials 1042-CDD-3001 and 1042-09009.00 was 19 years. In 
other clinical trials, many adults of different ages were included; however, none of these studies 
evaluated the to-be-marketed formulation and/or the 600mg TID dose regime. The investigated adults 
were also mosty healthy subjects or a different population. Therefore, data in adults are mainly based 
on population PK simulations. 
The applicant provided population PK simulations for healthy adult subjects using the NHANES 
database. Following administration of GNX 600 mg three times a day in adults, the expected exposure 
(AUC0-24 hr) is about 4000 ng*hr/mL, based on population PK simulations and PK studies in healthy 
volunteers. Overall, the simulated exposure in adults was reversely correlated with bodyweight and 
therefore it cannot be excluded that the drug may be less effective in adults with normal body weight. 
The applicant also estimated the adult GNX exposure following a 600-mg oral dose of GNX based on 
single dose study 1042-DDI-1001 (healthy volunteers) and ongoing single dose study 1042-HME-1001. 
The calculated AUC0-24hr were 3860 ng*h/mL and 4260 ng*h/mL. This is roughly in line with population PK 
estimates.  The applicant will provide the final report of the single dose study 1042-HME-1001 post-
approval.

Special populations 
The applicant evaluated the PK of GNX following oral administration to adult and paediatric patients 
with CDD in pop PK study 1042-CDD-POPPK-001. Covariate analysis was conducted, and weight was 
identified as the relevant covariate. None of the other covariates had an additional impact on GNX 
exposure. However, due to the relatively small and homogenous dataset, no final conclusions can be 
drawn yet on the potential impact of age, albumin, creatinine clearance and liver parameters.  
The impact of Race (white N=83, black N=8, Asian N=1, other N=2) was also evaluated in popPK 
model 09-0600-POP-PK-01. This analysis indicated that GNX pharmacokinetics are unlikely to be 
influenced by race. 
The applicant evaluated the pharmacokinetics of GNX in patients with impaired renal function in study 
1042-IRF-1001. Based on the results of the study it can be concluded that renal impairment had no 
impact on the exposure of ganaxolone. There is no experience in patients with end-stage renal disease. 
The information is correctly reflected in the SmPC. 
GNX is extensively metabolised and study 1042-IHF-1001 showed that hepatic impairment has 
significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of ganaxolone. The impact of mild hepatic impairment could 
be considered negligible (1.5 fold increase in Cmax and 1.2 fold increase in AUC0-t). A dose reduction 
is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment and not for patients with mild and 
moderate hepatic impairment. The information is correctly reflected in the SmPC. 
In Studies CA042-9501.01 and CA042-9505.01 gender did not affect the PK of GNX. However, both 
studies evaluated early formulations and study CA042-9505.01 was not designed to evaluate full 
pharmacokinetic profiles and PK parameters such as Cmax, tmax, AUC, and clearance could not be 
calculated due to limited sampling. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. Potential 
gender differences of the GNX metabolic profile have not been evaluated. As GNX is structurally related 
to progestogen, sex differences cannot be excluded. Like other steroids, GNX is metabolized by 
multiple pathways, via CYP enzymes but also via sulphation and glucuronidation. It should be noted 
that the metabolite pattern was different between male and female mice and rats, which is not 
uncommon for drugs metabolised by CYP enzymes. As studies in healthy subjects have not shown a 
gender effect on parent GNX and possible sex differences are not expected to affect the clinical efficacy 
of GNX, the CHMP agreed that this is acceptable. 
Interactions 
The metabolism of GNX is highly complex. GNX is extensively metabolized by humans to give a variety 
of  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  metabolites,  and  a  total  of  over  50  metabolites  have  been  detected.  In  vitro 
studies suggest that GNX is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP3A5. CYP2B6, 
CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 may be involved to a much lesser extent. Metabolic profiling suggests multiple 
metabolic routes: oxidation, dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, sulphation and glucuronidation have been 
observed.  
In the presence of recombinant enzymes, GNX was a substrate for UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7. GNX 
did not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 up to concentrations of 100 µM. Some inhibition 
of UGT1A3 and UGT1A4 was observed, at a concentration of 40 µM the UGT activity was decreased by 
approximately 50% (study CYP2472_R2). This information has been added to the SmPC. 
In vitro study XT153121 and non-clinical studies in different species had indicated that GNX could be 
an inducer of CYP3A4 at concentrations of 0.1 to 30 µM.; however, in clinical DDI study, 1042-0402 
GNX  only  had  a  minor  influence  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  midazolam.  Hence,  GNX  is  no  relevant 
inducer in vivo at 400 mg BID doses. However, it should be noted that the 400 mg BID dose is more 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 60/132 
 
 
 
than 2-fold lower than the maximal posology of 600 mg TID, and hence the potential inducing effects 
are not evaluated under the worst-case situation. 
GNX  will  be  frequently  co-administered  with  other  Anti-seizure  medications.  Most  Anti-seizure 
medications are extensively metabolised via CYP and/or UGT-pathways. The applicant has not evaluated 
the potential effect of GNX on the pharmacokinetics of other Anti-seizure medications in vivo. In vitro 
studies  suggest  that  GNX  may  be  an  inducer  of  CYP3A*(study  XT153121);  some  direct  inhibition  of 
CYP3A was observed (study XT155147), and an increase of carbamazepine metabolism and a decrease 
of  valproic  acid  metabolism  was  observed  in  human  liver  microsomes  vitro  (11042.HM.VT.  94.08). 
Although these in vitro studies are difficult to interpret, drug interaction with other anti-seizures cannot 
be excluded.  
GNX is a substrate for UGT1A3, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B15. In a subgroup analyses (see Clinical 
efficacy), an effect modification is apparent when GNX is used concomitantly with clobazam, valproate 
or vigabatrin. The effect appeared most pronounced for valproate, a UGT inhibitor. No formal drug-drug 
interaction  studies  have  been  conducted  with  ganaxolone  in  combination  with  UGT  inhibitors  such  as 
valproate.  Dose  reduction  of  ganaxolone  and/or  the  UGT  inhibitor  may  be  necessary  when  given  in 
combination.   
Even though the interaction study with midazolam indicated that there is no induction of CYP3A4, this, 
however, is considered not sufficient evidence for absence on effect on oral contraceptives especially 
given the similarities in structure and metabolism between ganaxolone and oral contraceptives. As the 
CDD population is usually not capable of bearing offspring, a DDI study is currently not warranted. 
Accordingly, a statement indicating that potential interaction of ganaxolone with oral contraceptives 
has not been investigated is included in the SmPC Section 4.5. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The precise mechanism by which GNX exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of seizures 
associated with CDD is unknown, but its anticonvulsant effects are thought to result from the 
modulation of the GABAA receptors in the CNS, similar to benzodiazepines (e.g. clobazam) and other 
anti-seizure medications (ASMs) such as vigabatrin and felbamate. According to the applicant, GNX 
binds to a distinct site on the GABAA receptor and modulates the extrasynaptic GABAA receptors.  
The potential for abuse of GNX was evaluated in study 1042-HAP-1001. Of the three GNX doses 
evaluated in the study, the 2000mg dose obtained the highest scores on all endpoints (maximum daily 
dose for CDD: 1800mg). It is noted however that the abuse potential seems less than for lorazepam 
6mg. A limitation of the study is that it only evaluated the abuse potential of single-dose GNX in 
recreational polydrug users. In clinical practice, GNX will be dosed repeatedly in patients with CDD, 
most likely in a controlled setting. Therefore the CHMP agreed that GNX has the potential for abuse 
and a warning is included in section 4.4, with a cross reference to section 5.3. 
No pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction studies were submitted. For this CDD indication, GNX is 
given as adjunctive to other ASMs. With respect to PK interactions, DDI study 1042-DDI-1001 the 
strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin reduced GNX exposure by 57-68% and in pop PK study 09-0600-POP-
PK-01 a reduction of about 40% was observed when GNX was concomitantly used with CYP inducing 
anti-seizures. This information has been reflected in SmPC section 4.5. Subgroup analyses on 
concomitant use with specific anti-seizure medications indicate that somnolence and sedation occur 
more frequently when these are used with GNX. Therefore, there is a warning in section 4.4 on 
somnolence and sedation emphasizes that these effects can be potentiated when anti-seizure 
medication is used concomitantly.

2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP agrees that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ganaxolone have been 
sufficiently evaluated.  
The relevant findings are appropriately reflected in the Product Information. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
- Characterisation of the GNX metabolite pattern at steady state. 
- Submission of the results of the additional characterisation of the metabolite M43=M17. 
In addition, the applicant agrees to provide post-approval the final report of the single dose study 1042-
HME-1001.

Methods 
•  Study Participants  
The main inclusion criteria were: 
• 
(a) Molecular confirmation of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic CDKL5 variant, early onset, difficult 
to control seizures, and neurodevelopmental impairment were required. 
The Principal Investigator must have reviewed the results of the genetic analysis and confirmed that 
gene mutation was likely to be the cause of the epilepsy syndrome. If the subject had a de novo 
variant of unknown significance in the kinase domain of the CDKL5, parental testing was negative and 
met all other inclusion criteria; then the subject was included. 
•  Male or female subjects aged 2 through 21 years, inclusive. 
• 
Failure to control seizures despite appropriate trial of 2 or more anti-seizure medications at 
therapeutic doses. 
•  Had at least 16 seizures of major motor seizure types: bilateral tonic (sustained motor activity ≥ 3 
seconds), generalized tonic-clonic, bilateral clonic, atonic/drop or focal to bilateral tonic-clonic per 
28 days in each 1-month period in the 2-month period prior to screening. 
•  Subject was approved to participate by sponsor and/or designee (ie, Epilepsy Consortium) after 
review of medical history, genetic testing, seizure classification, and historical seizure calendars. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023

• 
Participants were on a stable regimen of zero to 4 anti-seizure medications (including moderate or 
strong inducer or inhibitor anti-seizure medications eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin, etc.) for ≥ 1 
month prior to the screening visit, without a foreseeable change in dosing for the duration of the 
double-blind phase. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), ketogenic diet, and modified Atkins diet did 
not count towards this limit but must have been unchanged for 3 months prior to screening. 
•  Subjects with surgically implanted VNS were allowed to enter the study provided that all of the 
following conditions were met: VNS had been in place for ≥ 1 year prior to the screening visit, the 
settings remained constant for 3 months prior to the screening visit and remained constant 
throughout the double-blind phase, the battery was expected to last for the duration of the double-
blind phase. 
• 
• 
Felbamate: The use of felbamate was allowed provided that the subject had been maintained on a 
stable dose of felbamate for > 6 months and had stable liver function (AST and ALT) and 
hematology during the course of treatment and was expected to remain constant throughout the 
double-blind phase. 
Parent/caregiver was able and willing to maintain an accurate and complete daily electronic seizure 
calendar for the duration of the study. 
•  Was able and willing to take investigational product with food TID. GNX must have been 
administered with food. 
The key exclusion criteria were: 
• 
• 
Previous exposure to GNX. 
Pregnant or breastfeeding. 
•  West Syndrome with hypsarrhythmia pattern on EEG or seizures predominantly of IS type; if 
EEG pattern/seizure type was uncertain, study inclusion was reviewed and determined by the 
sponsor/sponsor delegate. 
•  Concurrent use of ACTH, prednisone or other glucocorticoid was not permitted, nor use of 
moderate or strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5/7. Moderate or strong inducer or 
inhibitor ASMs were allowed (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin, etc.). 
•  Subjects on ACTH, prednisone, or other systemically (non-inhaled) administered steroids 
should have been off the product > 28 days prior to screening.  
•  Subjects with a positive result on THC or CBD test (via urine or plasma drug screen) at the 
screening visit, and a positive result on THC or CBD test (via plasma) at the baseline visit 
without prescription for Epidiolex in epilepsy were excluded from the study. Concomitant 
Epidiolex (CBD) use was allowed in the double-blind phase provided the subject had been on a 
stable dose for at least 1 month prior to screening and was expected to remain on a stable 
dose without a foreseeable change for the duration of the double-blind phase. THC and/or CBD 
were allowed in the open-label phase. 
•  Use of dietary supplements or herbal preparations were not permitted if subject had been 
using them consistently for less than 3 months prior to screening or did not plan on remaining 
on stable doses for the duration of the double-blind phase. Use of St. John’s Wort was not 
permitted. 
•  Changes in ASMs within the last month prior to screening. All ASMs must have been stable in 
dose for at least 1 month prior to screening unless otherwise noted.  
Assessment report

Page 64/132 
 
 
 
•  Had an active CNS infection, demyelinating disease, degenerative neurological disease, or CNS 
disease deemed progressive as evaluated by brain imaging (MRI). 
•  Had any disease or condition (medical or surgical; other than CDKL5) at screening that might 
have compromised the hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, or 
hepatic systems; or other conditions that might have interfered with the absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the IP, or would have placed the subject at increased 
risk. 
•  An AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) > 3 x ULN at study entry. If AST or ALT increased > 3 x ULN 
during the study, subject was followed with weekly laboratory repeat testing and continued in 
study if levels were trending down. Subject was discontinued if levels did not decline to < 3 x 
ULN. 
• 
Total bilirubin levels greater than ULN at study entry. In cases of documented, stable medical 
condition (ie, Gilbert’s Syndrome) resulting in levels of total bilirubin greater than ULN, the 
medical monitor determined if a protocol exception could be made. If total bilirubin increased 
to 1.5 x ULN or more during study, the subject was discontinued.  
•  Subjects with significant renal insufficiency, eGFR < 30 mL/min (calculated using the 
Cockcroft-Gault formula, Paediatric GFR calculator or Bedside Schwartz), were excluded from 
study entry or were discontinued if the criteria was met post-baseline. 
•  Treatments 
17-week double-blind treatment phase 
Subjects received either GNX or PBO, prescribed in increments of 15 mg/kg/day up to 63 mg/kg/day 
(max 1800 mg/day) as an oral suspension TID. Subjects weighing ≤ 28 kg were dosed on an mg/kg 
basis, and subjects weighing > 28 kg were dosed by mg/day. All investigational products prescribed 
per day was administered in 3 divided doses following a meal or snack. The titration scheme during the 
initial 28-taper is shown in Table 12.  
Table 9: Titration scheme for double-blind treatment period 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 65/132 
 
 
 
 
Subjects who were not able to tolerate 63 mg/kg/day (or 1,800 mg/day max) were allowed to be 
maintained on a lower dose. A minimum dose of 33 mg/kg/day or 900 mg/day was generally required 
during the double-blind phase unless a lower dose was agreed to. 
Dose changes, including alternative dosing paradigms (e.g., a lower dose during the daytime and a 
higher dose in the evening) were discussed with the Sponsor’s medical monitor. Subjects who 
discontinued investigational product underwent a 2-week taper period unless otherwise medically 
indicated. Subjects who discontinued investigational product treatment before the completion of the 
double-blind phase were followed per-protocol (PP) and maintained Diary entries until the double-blind 
phase was completed. These subjects also completed the safety follow-up assessments 2 weeks after 
the taper. 
Subjects or parent/caregiver were to record administration of investigational product and background 
ASMs in the eDiary/seizure calendar. Compliance with investigational product treatment was assessed 
by inspecting the subjects’ eDiary/seizure calendar and returning supplies with queries as necessary. 
Subjects that fell below 80% compliance at 2 consecutive visits during the double-blind phase were not 
included in the per-protocol population. 
Open-label extension phase 
Following the completion of the 17-week, double-blind phase subjects randomized to PBO will 
transition to GNX, while subjects randomized to GNX will stay on 63 mg/kg/day suspension (maximum 
1800 mg/day) or Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). Subjects begun the 4-week blinded dose titration to 
63 mg/kg/day or 1800 mg/day (or MTD) after completing Visit 5.  
•  Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of GNX compared with placebo as adjunctive 
therapy for the treatment of seizures in children and young adults with genetically confirmed CDD at 
the end of the 17-week double-blind phase. 
The secondary objectives were defined as follows: 
1)  To assess behavioural/neuropsychiatric changes correlated with domains of attention, sleep, 
and a target behaviour chosen by the parent/caregiver, using objective tests of CNS function 
for GNX compared with PBO as adjunctive therapy at the end of the 17-week double-blind 
phase. 
2)  To assess the safety and tolerability of GNX compared with PBO as adjunctive therapy at the 
end of the 17-week double-blind phase. 
3)  To assess PK parameters in subjects receiving GNX doses up to 63 mg/kg/day (1800 mg/day 
maximum) throughout the study  
4)  To assess the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of GNX when administered as 
adjunctive therapy throughout the open-label phase. 
The exploratory objectives of this study are the following: 
• 
• 
• 
To assess changes correlated with other behaviour domains as assessed by the Anxiety, 
Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS). 
To assess changes to the quality-of-life scales as assessed by the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) 
and the Quality-of-Life Inventory-Disability (QI-Disability). 
To assess the potential use of an electroencephalogram (EEG) to study background activity as 
a biomarker of change in underlying brain function.

The 28-day major motor seizure (or primary seizure) frequency was based on an electronic 
seizure diary (eDairy) for each subject. Primary seizure types of bilateral tonic (sustained motor 
activity ≥ 3 seconds), generalized tonic-clonic, bilateral clonic, atonic/drop or focal to bilateral tonic-
clonic seizures will be counted towards the primary endpoint.  
Parent/caregiver was to record daily seizure frequency denoting seizure type and frequency, ASMs 
(rescue medications) and compliance with the investigational product treatment in an electronic 
seizure diary. Seizures were to be noted as occurring as individual seizures, seizures occurring in a 
cluster with countable seizures or seizures occurring in a cluster with uncountable seizures. In rare 
cases when an eDiary completion was not feasible, a paper seizure calendar was to be used to log in 
daily seizure type and frequency (with approval by the Sponsor). 
To standardize seizure identification and classification in the study, a Seizure Identification and 
Diagnostic Review Form (SIF/DRF) were submitted and reviewed by the Epilepsy Study Consortium. 
Approval of the SIF/DRF was required prior to randomization. In addition to this form, videos of the 
subject’s seizure types were reviewed to confirm proper classification provided that the 
parent/caregiver. Parents/caregivers had to make every effort to capture one example of each of the 
primary seizure types that their child experiences.  
A responder analysis in which subjects with a percent reduction from baseline in 28-day major motor 
seizure frequency during the double-blind treatment period of at least 50 percentage points were 
identified and the overall proportion within each treatment group was tabulated.  
The Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) is a 7-point Likert scale that the 
parent/caregiver and clinician used to rate the change in overall seizure control, behaviour, safety and 
tolerability after initiation of investigational product relative to baseline (1- very much improved, 2- 
much improved, 3-minimally improved, 4- no change, 5- minimally worse, 6- much worse, and 7- very 
much worse). 
The Caregiver Global Impression of Change in Seizure Intensity/ Duration (CGICSID) is a 7-
point Likert scale (1- very much improved, 2- much improved, 3-minimally improved, 4- no change, 5- 
minimally worse, 6- much worse, and 7- very much worse). The parent/caregiver assesses change in 
seizure intensity and/or duration after initiation of the investigational product relative to baseline.  
The Caregiver Global Impression of Change in Attention (CGICA) is a 7-point Likert scale (1- 
very much improved, 2- much improved, 3-minimally improved, 4- no change, 5- minimally worse, 6- 
much worse, and 7- very much worse) in which the parent/caregiver assesses change in attention after 
initiating investigational product relative to baseline. 
The Caregiver Global Impression of Change (CGI-C– target behavior) is a 7-point Likert scale 
(1- very much improved, 2- much improved, 3-minimally improved, 4- no change, 5 - minimally 
Assessment report

worse, 6- much worse, and 7- very much worse) in which the caregiver chooses one domain from 
possible domains of sociability, communication, irritability, and hyperactivity to assess change in target 
behaviour after the initiation of investigational product relative to baseline.  
The Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS) is a rating scale designed to screen for anxiety 
and depression in individuals with intellectual disability. The 28-question scale is filled out by the 
parent/caregiver and is based on the subject’s behaviour.  
The Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) is a psychological questionnaire designed to 
measure sleep behaviours in children and adolescents. The 22-question test was filled out by the 
parent/caregiver. 
The Parenting Stress Test (PSI) 4th edition is designed to evaluate the magnitude of stress in the 
parent-child system. It focuses on three major domains of stress: child characteristics, parent 
characteristics and situational/demographic life stress. This is an 18-item parent report assessment, 
with each item rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1- strongly disagree, 2- disagree, 3- undecided, 4- 
agree, and 5- strongly agree). 
The Quality-of-Life Inventory- Disability (QI-Disability) is a parent/caregiver reported quality of 
life scale developed for children with intellectual disabilities. The scale measures six domains over the 
past month: physical health, positive emotions, negative emotions, social interaction, leisure and the 
outdoors, and independence. Each question will be rated categorically (never, rarely, sometimes, 
often, and very often). 
To determine the neurosteroid levels, blood samples will be drawn at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 5 
(Week 17), and at the Final OL Visit. 
An additional exploratory endpoint was the measurement of EEG. A routine EEG was to be performed 
at Visit 2 (baseline), Visit 5 (Week 17) in the double-blind phase, and to be assessed at the Final OL 
Visit to record seizure activity. All EEG study data collected were to be submitted to a central reviewer 
for interpretation. 
•  Sample size 
Based on data from the 7 patients in Study 1042-0900 evaluating GNX in CDKL5 patients, the standard 
deviation for the percent change in 28-day seizure frequency was estimated to be 44.5. Therefore, 
with a difference in 28-day seizure frequency between GNX and PBO, a trial with 100 subjects 
randomized 1:1 would have 92% power to detect this effect when using an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) that preserves a (one-sided) 2.5% false-positive error rate. The actual analysis will use a 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which has approximately the same power as the ANOVA. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Subjects were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio (GNX: PBO) based on a randomization schedule at Visit 
2 (Week 0). An IWRS centrally randomized subjects and instructed the investigator which numbered 
bottle to use to dose a subject. The content of each bottle was blinded using labels. Only the 
investigational product supplier and the sponsor’s investigational product manager were unblinded as 
to the contents of each bottle of investigational product. Study staff as well as subject and caregiver 
were blinded to treatment 
•  Statistical methods 
The Intent to Treat (ITT) population comprised all randomized subjects who received at least one 
dose of the investigational product. Treatment groups were defined according to the treatment 
assignment at randomisation. The ITT population was the primary population for the efficacy analyses 
and for the concomitant ASM level and neurosteroid level analyses. The safety population comprised all 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023  
Page 69/132 
 
 
 
randomised subjects who received at least one dose of investigational product. Treatment groups were 
defined according to the treatment actually received. All safety analyses were performed in the Safety 
Population. The Per-Protocol (PP) population consisted of ITT subjects who received study drug for at 
least 6 weeks, provided at least 5 weeks of post-baseline seizure data, and had no major protocol 
violations (defined prior to database lock). A supportive analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints was conducted in this population. 
Subject demographics, characteristics, and medical history at randomization was summarized using 
descriptive statistics. 
The estimand framework for the primary endpoint is as follows: 
Population: target study population comprises children and young adults with CDKL5 Deficiency 
Disorder (CDD) who also meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria as specified in the study protocol. 
The analysis population is the ITT Population defined as all randomized participants. 
Variable: The variable is the primary efficacy endpoint, the percentage change from baseline in 28-day 
primary seizure frequency during the 17-week DB treatment phase. 
Population-Level Summary: The population-level summary will be the difference of the percentage 
change on primary efficacy endpoint between GNX and PBO groups and its 2-sided 95% CI.  
Intercurrent Events (ICEs) and their handling rules are discontinuations due to lack of efficacy and 
discontinuations due to expected AEs. Both ICEs were addressed by the treatment policy strategy. The 
use of rescue medication was allowable at any time during the study. A patient may have required 
rescue medication during the trial but continued with the trial post-rescue medication. Therefore, the 
efficacy of the trial treatment was be assessed regardless of the need for rescue medication. 
A supplemental estimand was defined post-hoc, considering the ICE rescue medication as treatment 
failure. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change in 28-day primary seizure frequency through 
the end of the double-blind treatment phase relative to the baseline period. Baseline and post-baseline 
28-day seizure frequency were calculated as the total number of seizures in the baseline phase or the 
17-week DB treatment phase divided by the number of days with seizure data in that phase, multiplied 
by 28. The calculation for percent change from baseline in 28-day seizure frequency was done as 
follows for each subject: 
The baseline, post-baseline, and arithmetic and percent changes from baseline in 28-day seizure 
frequency were summarized using descriptive statistics. The difference between the treatment groups 
in the percent changes was tested for statistical significance at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, 
using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test (since skewness and/or outliers were anticipated). Moreover, an 
estimate of the median difference between GNX and PBO, together with the 95% confidence interval, 
was calculated by the Hodges–Lehmann approach that is used to compare the treatment effect while 
the data is non-normal distributed. 
Intermittent (random/sporadic) missing data during the baseline and DB phase were assumed 
missing completely at random, and the collected data were used to calculate the 28-day seizure 
frequencies. For early drug termination prior to the end of the 17-week DB phase, caregivers were 
instructed to continue to provide daily seizure records until the end of the 17-week DB phase.

EMA/267469/2023  
Page 70/132 
 
 
 
 
Three sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint were performed. Missing data handling 
for subjects that stop recording was tested using placebo-based imputation and worst case (3rd highest 
count) imputation. A third sensitivity analysis tested the effect in the subgroup of patients with low 
Allo-S levels (≤ 2500 pg/mL at baseline). 
While the study was ongoing, the applicant was notified that the eDiary could prompt 
parent/caregivers to re-enter some seizure and medication information, leading to overreporting. In 
order to mitigate this issue and only map original records for analysis, the eDiary vendor (Signant 
Health) reviewed all records collected in the eDiary; all confirmed duplicate (second) records were 
flagged and were not presented in the final datasets. 
The key secondary endpoints were the number (%) of subjects with a ≥50% reduction from baseline 
in primary seizure frequency and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) at the last 
scheduled visit in the 17- week DB treatment phase. The response rate was analysed using Fisher’s 
Exact test, and the corresponding p-value was provided as well as the difference in proportions along 
with the 95% CI for the difference. In addition, a cumulative responder curve was provided. The CGI-I 
score was analysed using ordinal logistic regression. The estimated odds ratios, 95% CI and the p-
value was presented. 
There was a single primary efficacy endpoint, and formal hypothesis testing was performed for this 
endpoint first. If the null hypothesis was rejected for the primary efficacy endpoint, statistical 
hypothesis testing was performed on the 2 key secondary endpoints. First, the responder endpoint was 
tested, and if statistically significant, the testing process continued with CGI-I. 
For other secondary endpoints, the baseline and post-baseline values and the arithmetic changes from 
baseline were summarized using descriptive statistics for change from baseline endpoints, and the 
number and percentage of subjects with each score were summarized for score endpoints.

At the end of the 4-week titration phase, 9 out of 10 of the subjects weighing > 28 kg in the GNX 
group and 9 out of 11 subjects in the PBO group achieved the optimal dose level of 1800 mg/day, and 
31 out of 40 subjects weighing ≤ 28 kg in the GNX group and 33 out of 40 subjects in the PBO group 
achieved the optimal dose level of 63 mg/kg/day TID. 
Overall, 11 subjects in the GNX group and 12 subjects in the PBO group needed a dose reduction after 
reaching the optimal dose (1800 mg/day for subjects weighing > 28 kg, 63 mg/kg/day for subjects 
weighing ≤ 28 kg) during titration.  
Of 101 subjects randomized, 95 (94.1%) completed the 17-week double-blind phase; 6 (5.9%) 
subjects discontinued the study. The most common reasons for premature discontinuation are listed in

Genetic testing 
More than half of the subjects in the GNX (33 [66.0%] subjects) and PBO (26 [51.0%] subjects) 
groups had confirmed pathogenic CDKL5 variants. For the other subjects, likely pathogenic CDKL5 
variants were identified in 11 (22.0%) subjects in the GNX group and 20 (39.2%) subjects in the PBO 
group and variants of unknown significance were identified in 6 (12.0%) subjects in the GNX group and 
5 (9.8%) subjects in the PBO group. Two (4.0%) subjects in the GNX group also had a variant of 
unknown significance in the kinase domain.  
Seizures 
All subjects had seizure onset by 1 year of age. The median age at the first seizure for all subjects was 
2.0 months (range: 0 to 14 months). 
Historical seizure information recorded in the 2 months prior indicates that bilateral tonic seizures were 
the most frequent seizure types recorded during the 2 months historical control period, with a median 
number of seizures of 20.0 (range: 0 to 379) for all subjects (median number of seizures of 20.5 
[range: 0 to 379] for subjects in the GNX group and 18.0 [range: 0 to 203] for subjects in the PBO 
group) during Month 1, and median number of seizures of 18.0 (range: 0 to 334) for all subjects 
(median number of seizures of 21.0 [range: 0 to 334] for subjects in the GNX group and 18.0 [range: 
0 to 189] for subjects in the PBO group) during Month 2. Of all seizures captured during the diagnostic 
review, the most frequently observed were bilateral tonic seizures, observed in 31 (30.7%) subjects 
(13 [26.0%] subjects in the GNX group and 18 [35.3%] subjects in the PBO group) 
Anti-epileptic Drug Medications 
Overall, 98 (97.0%) subjects (48 [96.0%] subjects in the GNX group, 50 [98.0%] subjects in the PBO 
group) used any prior ASM medication. The median number of ASM medications taken and stopped 
prior to treatment for all subjects was 7 (range: 1 to 16) (7 [range: 2 to 16] for subjects in the GNX 
group, 7 [range: 1 to 14] for subjects in the PBO group). Subjects enrolled in the study were allowed 
to be on a stable regimen of up to 4 concomitant antiseizure medications. Concomitant ASM

Non anti-seizure Drug Medications 
Overall, 21 (20.8%) subjects (7 [14.0%] subjects in the GNX group, 14 [27.5%] subjects in the PBO 
group) used any prior non-ASM medication. 
Concomitant non-ASM medications were used by 89 (88.1%) subjects (42 [84.0%] subjects in the 
GNX group, 47 [92.2%] subjects in the PBO group). The most frequent (used by ≥ 10 subjects in either 
treatment group) concomitant non-ASM medications were paracetamol (15 [30.0%] subjects in the 
GNX group, 15 [29.4%] subjects in the PBO group) and Macrogol 3350 (5 [10.0%] subjects in the GNX 
group, 11 [21.6%] subjects in the PBO group).

Non-pharmacological Therapies 
Overall, 17 (16.8%) subjects (9 [18.0%] subjects in the GNX group, 8 [15.7%] subjects in 
the PBO group) had prior therapies (used and discontinued by subjects prior to the first 
dosing day of the study drug). A ketogenic diet was the most frequent prior therapy, 
administered to 6 (5.9%) subjects (3 [6.0%] subjects in the GNX group, 3 [5.9%] subjects in 
the PBO group); all other prior therapies were administered to ≤ 2 subjects in either 
treatment group. 
Concomitant therapies were administered to 55 (54.5%) subjects (29 [58.0%] subjects in the 
GNX group, 26 [51.0%] subjects in the PBO group). The most frequent (used by ≥ 10 subjects 
in either treatment group) concomitant therapies were physiotherapy (20 [40.0%] subjects in 
the GNX group, 21 [41.2%] subjects in the PBO group), speech rehabilitation (15 [30.0%] 
subjects in the GNX group, 18 [35.3%] subjects in the PBO group), and occupational therapy 
(12 [24.0%] subjects in the GNX group, 15 [29.4%] subjects in the PBO group). 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint:  
Within the 13-week maintenance portion of the 17-week double-blind phase, subjects in the 
GNX group had greater improvement from baseline in 28-day seizure frequency for major 
motor seizure types compared to subjects in the PBO group. There was a statistically 
significant difference in the median percent change from baseline in 28-day seizure frequency 
for major motor seizure types between the GNX and PBO groups (-29.39% for subjects in the 
GNX group, -6.49% for subjects in the PBO group; Wilcoxon Test p = 0.0081, Table 16).

The primary seizure types include bilateral tonic (sustained motor activity ≥3 seconds), generalized tonic-
clonic, atonic/drop, bilateral clonic, and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic. 
The baseline interval consists of 6 weeks prior to the first dose. 
Secondary endpoints 
50% responder rate 
The number (%) of subjects with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in major motor seizure frequency 
(response rate) numerically favoured the GNX group (12 [24.5%] subjects in the GNX group, 5 [9.8%] 
subjects in the PBO group; p = 0.0643). In the maintenance phase of the study, the responder rate 
was nominal statistically significant in favour of GNX (p=0.0283, see Table 16). 
A cumulative responder curve of 28-day seizure frequency for major motor seizure types for subjects 
in the ITT population over the maintenance phase is presented in Figure 7.

Seizure counts were based on the sum of the individual seizures, the countable seizures, and the clusters with 
uncountable seizures (each cluster with uncountable seizures counts as 1 seizure). Within the baseline and post baseline 
intervals, 28-day seizure frequency was calculated as the total number of seizures in the interval divided by the number 
of days with available seizure data in the interval, multiplied by 28. 
The major motor seizure- types included bilateral tonic (sustained motor activity ≥ 3 seconds), generalized tonic clonic, 
atonic/drop, bilateral clonic, and focal to bilateral tonic clonic. 
The baseline interval consisted of the 6 weeks prior to the first dose.

Summaries are based on the individual seizures, the countable seizures, and the clusters with uncountable seizures. 
The major motor seizure types include bilateral tonic (sustained motor activity = 3 seconds), generalized tonic-clonic, 
atonic/drop, bilateral clonic, and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic. 
Within the baseline and post baseline intervals, the percentage of seizure-free days is the number of days in the interval with 
zero seizures divided by the number of days with seizure data in the interval, multiplied by 100. 
The baseline interval consists of the 6 weeks prior to the first dose. 
The 17-week postbaseline interval consists of the first day after the first dose up to the day before Visit 5 (Week 17), if 
available; otherwise up to the last day with seizure data. However, if a subject successfully completes the double-blind phase 
without a Visit 5, with a Taper Visit, and does not enter the open-label extension, then the interval ends the day before the 
Taper Visit. 
Duplicate seizure diary entries were excluded from this analysis.

reported any improvement (“minimally improved, “much improved,” or “very much improved”) in 
attention at Visit 3, Visit 4, and Visit 5 compared to caregivers of subjects in the PBO group. However, 
at the end of Week 17 the CGICA result favouring GNX group was of only “minimally improved”

Median percent change from baseline in seizure frequency – all types 
The median percent change from baseline in seizure frequency for all seizure types was -19.09% for 
subjects in the GNX group and -8.91% for subjects in the PBO group, with a median shift from the PBO 
group to the GNX group of -17.38%, indicating improvement in the GNX group compared to the PBO 
group. 
Percent Change from Baseline in 28-day Seizure Frequency per Seizure Subtype 
For the following seizure types, which were considered part of major motor seizures, a numerical 
improvement for GNX over placebo could be observed: bilateral tonic (median percent decrease from 
baseline -16.75%), generalized tonic-clonic (-47.89%), atonic/drop, (-49.18%), bilateral clonic (-
159.05%), and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic (-150.0%) seizures.  
With regard to the remaining seizure subtypes measured during the study, a numerical improvement in 
seizure frequency in the GNX group over placebo was observed with the exception of focal motor with 
intact awareness or altered awareness seizures and epileptic spams. In the former, a greater reduction 
in seizure frequency was reported for subjects treated with placebo (-52.56%, n=6) compared to GNX-
treated subjects (-16.19%, n=10). For the latter, worsening of epileptic spasms was recorded for 
subjects treated with GNX (1.55%, n=12), whereas a minor reduction was seen for subjects treated 
with placebo (-3.66%, n=10). 
Use of rescue medication 
Twenty-five (50.0%) subjects in the GNX group and 22 (43.1%) subjects in the PBO group took at 
least 1 rescue medication during the 17-week double-blind phase, and 20 (40.0%) and 17 (33.3%), 
respectively, in the maintenance phase. See Table 20 for an overview of the most commonly used 
rescue medication during the maintenance phase. Of those subjects who took at least 1 rescue 
medication, the median number of doses taken was 8.0 (range: 1 to 112) for subjects in the GNX 
group and 6.0 (range: 1 to 79) for subjects in the PBO group. The median number of days rescue 
medication was used was lower in the ganaxolone arm (462; 273 - 560) than in the placebo arm (499; 
406 - 740). Sensitivity analysis assessing the influence of handling rescue medication in the analysis is 
described below.

phase (data cut-off 22 June 2021) 
•  Ancillary analyses 
The three sensitivity analyses and the per-protocol analyses supported the primary analysis. Post-
hoc sensitivity analyses were provided where rescue medication was seen as a treatment failure. 
For the primary endpoint, a tipping point analysis penalising rescue treatment from 0 to 30% in 
both study arms showed that rescue medication did not affect the treatment estimate. In another 
analysis penalising the ganaxolone arm only, the treatment difference was no longer significant 
when rescue treatment would reduce the treatment effect in the ganaxolone arm by 25%. For the 
50% responder endpoint, regarding rescue medication as non-response reduced the number of 
responders. In the primary analysis, 12 (24.5%) subjects in the ganaxolone group and 5 (9.8%) 
subjects in the placebo group showed a 50% reduction from baseline in major motor seizure 
frequency (p = 0.064), including rescue medication as non-response lowered the responders to 6 
(12.2%) and 3 (6.0%) (p = 0.3178). 
Adult population 
In the double-blind phase of study 3001, there were two subjects > 18 years of age at study entry. 
Both subjects were 19 year-old, one was randomized to placebo and the other to GNX.  
Additional limited efficacy data on use of GNX for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD in 
adult patients comes from the OLE phase of study 3001 (see below).

2.6.5.2.  Supportive study(ies) 
Study 1042-0900 
The study was a phase 2a multicenter, 26-week open-label proof-of-concept trial evaluating GNX as 
adjunctive therapy for uncontrolled seizures in children with PCDH19 Epilepsy, CDD, Dravet Syndrome, and 
other epileptic syndromes such as LGS and CSWS followed by 52 weeks of additional open-label treatment. 
Design 
The study consisted of a 26-week open-label treatment period followed by a 52-week open-label extension 
period. For entry into the 52-week open-label extension, subjects must have completed all scheduled clinical 
study visits and shown a min of 35% improvement in mean seizure frequency per 28 days vs baseline over 
the 28-day period preceding study entry or upon sponsor approval after consultation with the principal 
investigator, Subjects were treated with open-label GNX oral suspension or GNX capsules at doses up to 
1800 mg/day.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change in total seizure frequency (sum of individual 
seizures and clusters) per 28 days relative to baseline. 
A total of 30 subjects were enrolled (including 7 CDD subjects) in the 26-week open-label treatment period, 
and 15 subjects (50.0%) completed treatment. 15 subjects (50.0%) discontinued during the 26-week open-

label treatment period, and the main reasons were lack of efficacy (8 subjects [26.7%]) and AE or SAE (4 
subjects [13.3%)]). Of the 15 subjects eligible for a 52-week extension period, 14 subjects were enrolled, 
and 8 (57.1%) completed treatment. 6 subjects (42.9%) discontinued treatment during the extension period 
and all discontinued due to a lack of efficacy. 
26-week open-label treatment period 
For the primary endpoint, the median percent change in 28-day total seizure frequency for the sum of 
individual seizures and clusters in the 26-week open-label treatment period relative to the baseline was -
47.34%, -10.22%, and -25.98% at Day 91 for the CDD, LGS, and PCDH19 cohorts, respectively.  
At Week 26, the median percent change from baseline was -37.70%, -9.19%, and -24.59% for the CDD, 
LGS, and PCDH19 cohorts, respectively. 
52-week open-label treatment period 
The median percentage change in 28-day total seizure frequency for the sum of individual seizures and 
clusters in the 52-week open-label extension period relative to the baseline was reduced in all 3 cohorts. At 
Day 181, the median percentage change was -58.94%, -38.74% and -13.48% for the CDD, LGS, and 
PCDH19 cohorts, respectively.  
At Week 52, the median percentage change from baseline was -61.93%, -37.75% and -13.48% for the CDD, 
LGS, and PCDH19 cohorts, respectively. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of GNX for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD was investigated in a single pivotal 
phase 3 study 3001 and an exploratory phase 2a proof of concept basket trial study 0900.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 0900 
This was a 26-week open-label study evaluating GNX as adjunctive therapy for uncontrolled seizures in 
children with epileptic syndromes, followed by 52 weeks of additional open-label treatment. The study 
included subjects with seizures associated with CDD, PCDH19 Epilepsy and the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. 
The primary endpoint was the median percent change in total seizure frequency (sum of individual seizures 
and clusters) per 28 days relative to baseline. 
Study 3001 
Design  
This was a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study that evaluated adjunctive GNX on top 
of other anti-seizure medications (ASMs) in children and young adults with CDD. 
The study consisted of a 6-week prospective baseline period, 17-week double-blind treatment phase with a 4 
weeks titration and 13 weeks maintenance period. The study has an ongoing open-label extension phase, 
including an additional 4-week titration phase in order to maintain blinding for treatment received in the 
double-blind.  
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023 
Page 91/132 
 
 
 
This study design is considered conventional for studies in refractory epilepsy and in line with the 
recommendations of the EMA Epilepsy guideline.  
Target population 
Overall, the main inclusion/exclusion criteria enabled the selection of a patient population that increased the 
likelihood of detecting the GNX’s effect.  
The key inclusion criteria with respect to confirmation of CDD was the requirement of molecular confirmation 
of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic CDKL5 variant, early-onset difficult-to-control seizures, and 
neurodevelopmental impairment.  
Another key inclusion criterion was age 2 through 21 years (inclusive). The choice of the lower limit of 2 
years is considered a reasonable compromise for a clinical trial that has the objective of showing the actual 
efficacy of GNX, in order to exclude the confounding effect of the presence of a “honeymoon” period.  
The remaining in-and exclusion criteria are agreed.  
Outcomes 
The primary endpoint was the (median) percentage change from baseline in 28-day major motor seizure 
frequency over the 17-week, double-blind treatment phase. Major motor seizures, or primary seizures, are 
defined as bilateral tonic (sustained motor activity ≥ 3 seconds), generalized tonic-clonic, bilateral clonic, 
atonic/drop or focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. It was agreed in previous Scientific Advice that these 
seizure types are considered relevant for CDD and easier to count compared to other types of seizures since 
they are more clearly observable (EMEA/H/SA/3732/1/2018/PED/SME/III corrigendum). The percentage 
change is based on median seizure frequency, which is supported given the skewed distribution of seizure 
frequency.  
The key secondary endpoints are the 50% responder rate, defined as the number (%) of subjects with a ≥ 
50% reduction from baseline in major motor seizure frequency and the Clinical Global Impression of 
Improvement (CGI-I) at the last scheduled visit in the 17-week double-blind treatment phase. The CGI-I is 
scored by Parents/Caregivers and Clinicians separately. 
For rare epilepsies such as CDD, seizure frequency is considered acceptable as primary endpoint as long as a 
responder rate, which is usually preferred as the primary endpoint in the EMA Epilepsy guideline, has been 
included as a key secondary endpoint. This is the case for study 3001.  
Additional secondary and exploratory outcome variables deemed relevant for the evaluation of GNX for 
seizures associated with CDD are: days of motor seizure freedom, Clinical Global Impression of Change in 
target domains identified by parent/caregiver (CGI-C), Caregiver Global Impression of Change in Attention 
(CGICA), Caregiver Global Impression of Change in Seizure Intensity/Duration (CGICSID), and change in 
seizure frequency for all seizure type.  
EEG measurements were included as an exploratory pharmacodynamic endpoint in study 3001. However, the 
available number of EEG data available was too limited to perform any analyses.  
The applicant clarified that no exit criteria (e.g., nth seizure) were used in the Study 3001, hence failed 
efficacy was not defined a priori, despite the recommendations of EMA Guideline that consider the treatment 
retention time as an important variable to allow the assessment of the global clinical effectiveness of an Anti-
seizure medication. During the study, subjects could be on a stable regimen of 0-4 other ASMs. In addition, 
the use of rescue medication was permitted. This was also captured by an exploratory endpoint. Rescue 
Assessment report

medication were considered as background therapy and no recommendation was made with respect to 
dosing.  
Randomisation and blinding 
The blinding procedure is considered adequate. The randomisation procedure using IWRS, is acceptable.  
Statistical methods 
The sample size was based on the treatment effect observed in the PoC study and the calculation is correct. 
It was increased from 70 to 100 in protocol amendment 1.  
There are five versions of the SAP, the last two dated after the database lock only related to the OLE 
extension analyses 
The definition for the ITT, safety and per-protocol population are considered standard and acceptable. The 
estimand definition, using a treatment policy strategy in case of discontinuation or use of rescue medication, 
together with a supplemental estimand, using a hypothetical/composite strategy in case of rescue medication 
(treatment failure), are agreed. 
The analysis of the primary endpoint was performed with the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test; given the skewness of 
seizure frequencies, this is an acceptable method. Moreover, an estimate of the median difference between 
GNX and PBO, together with the 95% confidence interval, was calculated by the Hodges–Lehmann approach 
that is used to compare the treatment effect while the data is non-normal distributed. 
For the analysis of the primary endpoint, in addition to the non-parametric approach as the Wilcoxon rank-
sum test, the applicant should apply a parametric model as supportive analysis, i.e., the percentage 
reduction from baseline should be estimated using a negative binomial regression model. Moreover, factors 
known to influence outcome, such as baseline seizure frequency and seizure severity (if available) should be 
taken into account. The evaluation and discussion of concomitant products that could have impact on the 
overall efficacy were provided by the applicant after the requested use of a parametric model as supportive 
analysis, i.e., the percentage reduction from baseline using a Negative binomial regression model. A non-
significant treatment effect was shown, although a trend in favor of GNX was found. Of note, the justification 
provided by the applicant for the correct use of non-parametric model is not supported since the underlined 
assumptions of the model do not require normal distribution of the data. For the analysis of count data, a 
Poisson regression or, in case of overdispersion, a negative binomial regression can be actually used to 
consider covariates, hence the proposed model is deemed appropriate to analyze seizure rates. 
Missing seizure data will be considered missing completely at random and collected data will be used to 
calculate the 28-day seizure frequencies. This can be acceptable as the amount of missing data is sporadic 
and appears to be at random. Two sensitivity analyses were performed to test the missing data assumption, 
placebo-based imputation and worst-case imputation, which are considered acceptable. 
The key secondary 50% responder endpoint was analysed using Fisher’s exact test, which is acceptable. 
Ordinal regression was used for the key secondary CGI-I endpoint. As it is unlikely that the assumption of 
proportional odds was met, post-hoc the CGI-I endpoints were reanalysed using Chi-square, which led to the 
same results. Type I error rate across the primary and key secondary endpoints was appropriately handled 
by a sequential testing procedure. 
The primary and secondary endpoints use data from the titration plus maintenance phase. According to the 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic disorders, efficacy 
endpoints should be based on the maintenance phase only. The reason is that the effect size observed in this 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023 
Page 93/132 
 
 
 
period is no longer confounded by the dose adaptation of GNX. Upon request, analyses performed over the 
maintenance period were provided only for the primary, secondary, and seizure-related exploratory 
endpoints.  
Due to a diary error, some seizures were entered twice. This was repaired by flagging duplicate entries. As 
the first entry will be more reliable, this was used in the analysis. 
The applicant planned subgroup analyses on Allo-S level and gender, which is acceptable. However, since this 
is a single pivotal study, consistency of effect is needed. Additional (post hoc) subgroup analyses have been 
provided to evaluate consistency: baseline seizure frequency, gender, age categories, dose level, reached, 
use of rescue medication (yes/no), geographic region, Allo-S level, subjects whose seizure worsened during 
treatment (yes/no) and most commonly used concomitant ASMs (valproate, levetiracetam, clobazam, 
vigabatrin: yes/no and/or combinations thereof), presence/absence of somnolence and changes in 
background concomitant ASM medication.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study 0900 
The study enrolled subjects with CDD (n=7), protocadherin-19 epilepsy (PCDH19, n=11) and Lennox-Gastaut 
Syndrome (LGS, n=10). The assessment of this study will be restricted to the CDD cohort. 
At the end of the 26-week open-label phase, the median percentage change from baseline in seizure 
frequency was -37.70% for subjects with CDD. Interpretation of the results from this study is hampered due 
to the lack of a control arm and the very small sample size. In the end, only 4 subjects with CDD finished the 
26-week open-label treatment phase.  
The contribution of the results of this study to support the indication is limited.  
Study 3001  
Conduct of the study 
Several changes to the study protocol were made through Amendment 1.0, dated 05 May 2019, and 
Amendment 2.0, dated 26 May 2020. The most important changes were the addition of subgroup analyses by 
the Allo-S levels and Gender to the protocol and of a third sensitivity analysis on subjects with low Allo-S 
levels (Amendment 1.0), and the order of (key) secondary endpoints (the 50% responder rate and the CGI-I 
became the key secondary endpoints) (Amendment 2.0).” 
Of the 114 subjects screened, 13 (11.4%) were considered screen failures in accordance with the exclusion 
criteria.  
At the end of the 4-week titration phase, not every subject reached the target dose of 1800 mg/day (or 63 
mg/kg/day). There were also 23 subjects (11 in GNX, 12 in placebo) who required a dose reduction after 
initially reaching the target dose. The reasoning for not reaching the target dose or requiring a dose reduction 
at a later stage in the study was mostly related to the occurrence of adverse events. In clinical practice, GNX 
will be titrated based on tolerance. The mean model dose of GNX administered during both the double-blind 
and open-label phase are close to the target dose (1500 mg and 1690 mg, respectively), indicating that 
subjects were able to tolerate high doses of GNX.

Overall the study population appears to be representative of a CDD population, and most of the baseline 
characteristics seem to be well-balanced over the treatment arms.  
The median (range) number of concomitant ASMs was 2 overall (max 6) in both GNX (max 6) and PBO (max 
5) groups. According to the EMA Guidelines on epilepsy “…add-on trial should be conducted optimally in the 
presence of only one or two pre-existing ASMs, which plasma levels are kept stable within appropriate limits. 
…”. Based on the demographic data, GNX patients tended to take a higher number of concomitant ASMs than 
PBO patients. 
Regarding the concomitant ASM medications, it was shown by the applicant that the vast majority of them 
were between 2 and 5 at each treatment group. Moreover, around 50% of non-pharmacological treatments 
like ketogenic diet or VNS were used in the 2 to 3 concomitant AES medications at each group. Although the 
28-Day mean (SD) seizure frequency at baseline was 141.1 (200.9) for the PBO group and 223.9 (598.71) 
for the GNX group, their use did not show striking difference in the 13-week maintenance period and the OL 
phase that could have differentiated or privileged specific subgroups in each treatment arm. 
Efficacy results – double blind treatment period 
For the primary endpoint and 50% responder rate, an analysis over the maintenance period was provided. 
For the remaining endpoints, the analysis provided was performed over the titration+maintenance period 
(referred to as the 17-week double-blind phase).  
The median percent change from baseline in major motor seizure frequency in the maintenance phase was -
6.49% for subjects in the placebo group and -29.39% for subjects in the GNX group. The median shift was -
29.31% (CI95% -51.45, -8.90), and the difference between the group was statistically significant in favour of 
GNX treatment (p < 0.0081). Sensitivity analyses testing the handling of missing data supported the findings 
of the primary analysis. 
The results described above indicate a possible beneficial effect of GNX on major motor seizures associated 
with CDD. Initially, it could be excluded that the high use of rescue medication partially explains this effect, 
i.e., half of the subjects in GNX received rescue medication at some point, more than PBO subjects (50% 
[n=25] vs. 43.1% [n=22]). In addition, the median number of doses taken was higher for the GNX group 
compared to the placebo group (8 vs. 6), this is even reflected in a higher maximum dose (max 112 doses vs 
max 79 doses for the placebo group). The median number of days rescue medication was used was however 
lower in the GNX arm (462; 273 - 560) than in the placebo arm (499; 406 - 740). Post-hoc sensitivity 
analysis testing the influence of rescue medication on the primary and seizure-related secondary endpoints 
where rescue medication was seen as treatment failure. The sensitivity analysis using a tipping point 
penalising both treatment arms up to 30% did not affect the treatment estimate for the primary endpoint, 
while when penalising the ganaxolone arm only needed, the primary endpoint was no longer statistically 
significant when a 25% reduction in treatment effect in case of rescue medication was added to the 
ganaxolone arm. In the analysis of the 50% responder endpoint, the number of responders dropped when 
rescue medication was seen as non-response, but it remained numerically in favour of the ganaxolone arm.  
Based on the data, the most commonly used rescue medications during the maintenance period were 
benzodiazepines (e.g. midazolam, diazepam and clonazepam), with an imbalance specifically for midazolam 
in the GNX arm. The indications of these drugs suggest that rescue medication was most often used in 
situations wherein rapid cessation of prolonged seizures/status epilepticus was warranted. Additional 
analyses have been provided showing that the use of rescue medication was not followed by a decrease of 
major motor seizure frequency (i.e. the primary endpoint).

As dose changes of concomitant ASM therapies were not collected in a structured way it is not possible to 
gather any detailed summary tabular data by treatment group in the 13-week maintenance period and in the 
open-label phase.  
The number (%) of subjects with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in major motor seizure frequency 
(response rate) at the end of the 17-week double-blind phase numerically favoured the GNX group (12 
[24.5%] subjects in the GNX group, 5 [9.8%] subjects in the PBO group, net difference 14.7%). 
Nevertheless, as this endpoint did not reach statistical significance, the sequential testing procedure stopped 
here, and none of the secondary endpoints were formally statistically significant. Upon request, the responder 
rate over the maintenance phase only was provided. Herein 15 subjects (30.6%) in the GNX group and 6 
subjects (12%) in the PBO group were considered a responder. The difference compared to placebo was 
nominal statistically significant (p=0.0283). This reiterates the importance of conducting the main analyses 
over maintenance period only, as the effect size estimate could be influenced by allowed and planned dose 
adaptations in the titration period. Moreover, the cumulative response curves show a clear separation 
between the GNX and PBO arms, further supporting a relevant effect of GNX. Thus, the results from these 
analyses, support that GNX has a clinically relevant effect on primary seizures.   
Higher proportions of parents/caregivers of subjects in the GNX group rated the response to treatment at the 
end of the 17-week double-blind phase as “minimally improved” or “much improved” compared to 
parents/caregivers of subjects in the PBO group. Although a modest improvement was observed, there was 
no difference between the groups on the CGI-I score (nominal p = 0.0971). With respect to clinicians, higher 
proportions of subjects in the GNX group were rated the response to treatment at the end of the 17-week 
double-blind phase as “minimally improved” compared to clinicians of subjects in the PBO group. No 
difference was observed between the groups on the CGI-I (nominal p = 0.3518). Moreover, in both CGI-I 
scores, more subjects in the GNX group were rated as “much worse” or “very much worse” compared to 
placebo.  
The change from baseline in the percentage of median seizure-free days was 4.91% for subjects in the GNX 
group and 0.17% for subjects in the PBO group, with a median shift from the PBO group to the GNX group of 
1.72%.  
At the end of Week 17, the CGICA result favouring GNX group was “minimally improved” (46.7% vs 29.8% 
for the PBO group), and the CGI-C result was “much improved” (44.4% vs 30.4% for the PBO group).  
Taken together, while not all (seizure-related) secondary endpoints are supportive of the primary, the 50% 
responder rate and response curve performed over the maintenance phase indicate a clinically relevant 
reduction in seizure frequency for GNX when compared to placebo.   
Subgroup analyses 
Pre-specified (gender, Allo-S levels) subgroup analyses, as well as specifically requested analyses were 
provided.  
Most of the requested subgroup analyses show a consistent effect in favour of GNX, with the exception of the 
subgroup analyses on Allo-S levels (low/mid/high) and concomitant anti-seizure medication (valproate, 
clobazam and vigabatrin).  
For the Allo-S subgroup analysis, the forest plots suggest a trend that a higher allo-S level leads to better 
efficacy of GNX. Allo-S levels were initially included as subgroup analyses based on previous research 
suggesting better efficacy of GNX with low Allo-S levels. The findings of the subgroup analyses over study 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023 
Page 96/132 
 
 
 
3001 seem to suggest the opposite effect (i.e. higher Allo-S better efficacy); however, given the large 
confidence intervals that also mostly overlap with each other, no definitive conclusions can be drawn. 
Initial subgroup analyses performed over the maintenance period for concomitant use with valproate, 
clobazam or vigabatrin, suggested effect modification GNX. Note that during the maintenance period, 
subjects were not permitted to start new anti-seizure medication. The effect modification suggested a larger 
effect of GNX on major motor seizures when it was taken concomitantly with valproate or clobazam, whereas 
concomitant vigabatrin resulted in a much smaller effect size for GNX. Cumulative response curves on 
primary seizure frequency for these specific subgroups have been provided. Although it seems that a larger 
effect is obtained when GNX is combined with clobazam and valproate, GNX is still more effective than either 
of the placebo arms when it is not combined with these specific ASMs. For vigabatrin, both the placebo as 
well as the GNX group perform worse compared to those who did not take concomitant vigabatrin. A post hoc 
analysis on seizure worsening indicated that a larger group of subjects experienced some kind of seizure 
worsening in the GNX + vigabatrin group compared to subjects who did not combine GNX with vigabatrin. 
But the largest worsening is observed for subjects in the placebo group + vigabatrin. Altogether, a specific 
interaction between vigabatrin and GNX with respect to seizure worsening is not observed.  
Overall, the provided response curves do not indicate any effect modification of GNX + respective 
concomitant anti-seizure medication (ASM) that warrant any changes to the SmPC.  
Efficacy results - Ongoing open-label extension phase 
An interim report for the OLE phase has been provided (data cut-off June 2022). The interim data suggest 
that subjects who switched from placebo to GNX in the OLE phase benefitted from treatment, as shown by 
the increase in median percentage reduction in seizure frequency over time. With respect to the GNX arm, 
except for months 34-36, the reduction in seizure frequency does not fluctuate that much over time. At 
month 34-36, the median percentage change from baseline in major motor seizure frequency was 1.04 (-
82.62, 110.69) in the GNX group. This seems to be primarily driven by a single patient who experienced a 
seizure worsening of 101.7%, which is not an uncommon event for severe refractory epilepsies.   
Efficacy in special populations 
Additional studies in special populations were not performed. 
Approval was initially sought for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD in patients from 2 years of 
age. CDD is relatively recently characterised as a distinctive disorder. Of several other developmental 
epileptic encephalopathies, it is known that the disease changes over time and this is associated with 
changes in the seizure profile. However, for CDD, it is unclear how the disease, in particular the seizure 
characteristics, progresses into adulthood.  The controlled data available in adult CDD patients treated with 
GNX is very limited. There were 2 subjects aged > 18 years, one in placebo and the other in GNX (both 19 
years old), and precluded conclusions whether GNX was efficacious. Therefore, the applicant was requested 
to perform an extrapolation from children with CDD to adults (with reference to the Extrapolation of efficacy 
and safety in paediatric medicine development (EMA/189724/2018).  
Based on the provided response, efficacy obtained with GNX in children with CDD cannot be extrapolated to 
adults with CDD, as disease similarity has not been shown between these patient subpopulations. The claim 
that seizure semiology and disease severity are generally stable into adulthood could not be verified through 
scientific literature. There seems to be no natural history data or longitudinal observational data available 
that supports this. Although limited efficacy data have been provided on 7 subjects who turned > 18 years 
old during the OLE phase of the study, the results hamper interpretation whether seizure semiology remains 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023 
Page 97/132 
 
 
 
the same as it focuses only on primary seizure types and lack a comparison to childhood. Moreover, the 
results from these subjects are mixed, and do not provide convincing data to start treatment with GNX in 
naïve adults with CDD. In addition, based on the provided PK modelling, lower GNX exposure is expected for 
adults with normal body weight, which may lead to GNX being less effective at the target dose. Although GNX 
is titrated based on response, higher doses than the maximum dose of 1800 mg/day have not been 
investigated. Thus, as efficacy cannot be extrapolated, the current data do not support use of GNX in 
treatment naïve adults. The CHMP agreed that the indication should therefore be for studied population ie 
patients 2 to 17 years of age. However, while the data preclude use of GNX in treatment naïve adults with 
CDD, the limited OLE efficacy data do indicate that there is no reason to withdraw treatment in adulthood if a 
patient has initiated treatment during adolescence and perceived a clear benefit.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
GNX treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in monthly number of major motor seizures. 
Although support from secondary endpoints is limited, the median percentage reduction is supported by the 
50% responder rated and cumulative response rate over the maintenance period, indicating a clinically 
relevant reduction in seizures when compared to placebo.  
The CHMP agreed the efficacy obtained in paediatric patients with CDD cannot be extrapolated to adult 
patients with CDD and starting treatment with GNX in naïve adults with CDD cannot not be recommended. It 
was however agreed that treatment with GNX may be continued into adulthood if initiated in 
childhood/adolescence. 
The relevant findings are correctly reflected in the SmPC. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
GNX has been investigated in a broad range of CNS conditions (several epileptic syndromes, migraine, post-
partum depression and PTSD). A total of 1930 subjects were exposed to GNX (1837 subjects across 42 
completed clinical studies to oral GNX, 77 subjects exposed to IV GNX and 16 subjects administered both oral 
and IV GNX). 379 subjects were exposed to the to-be-marketed oral suspension formulation and dose of GNX 
in 8 Phase 2/3 studies (238 paediatric subjects and 141 adults). 
Three safety pools were defined (data lock point is 24 February 2021): 
Pool A = CDD Exposure Set (all patients with CDD exposed to GNX). 102 patients were included in the safety 
database for GNX in CDD (50 patients on GNX in DB phase Study 3001, 45 patients who switched from 
placebo to GNX in OL phase of Study 3001 and 7 CDD patients from basket Study 0900 in rare genetic 
epilepsies).  
Pool B = All Exposure Set (all patients exposed to GNX regardless of the indication and formulation used). 
N=1135. 
Pool C = Paediatric Exposure Set (a subset of Pool B with only paediatric safety data <18 years) N=238. 
Duration of exposure

As of the 24 Feb 2021 cut-off date, a total of 466 subjects received at least 1 dose of the to-be-marketed 
formulation of oral GNX in clinical trials. This includes 325 subjects who received oral GNX up to the 
maximum recommended therapeutic dose for the treatment of CDD up to 1800 mg/day (for subjects 
weighing > 28 kg). 
Table 20: Total Duration of Exposure for the Intended To-be marketed Formulation of Oral Ganaxolone 
All CDD Patients 
At the cut-off date of 30 June 2022, the mean duration of exposure was 613.7 days for subjects in the CDD 
Exposure Set. The subjects in the PBO group received a mean of 533.8 days of GNX treatment in the OLE 
phase. Subjects spent the majority of their time at the target dose of 1800 mg/day for subjects > 28 kg or 
63 mg/kg/day for subjects ≤ 28 kg.

2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
A similar proportion of patients on GNX (86%) and placebo (88.2%) experienced AEs. For approximately half 
of the patients in placebo, these were mild and for approximately half of the patients on GNX these were 
moderate. Serious AEs were reported for 9.8% of patients on placebo and 12% for patients on GNX. 
Treatment-related AEs were reported for 43.1% of patients on placebo and 70% for patients on GNX. Slightly 
more patients on placebo stopped because of AEs, while on GNX these leaded to dose reduction or temporary 
study drug discontinuation.

placebo. Sedation was reported as treatment-related AE for 6% for patients on GNX and 3.9% for patients on 
placebo. Constipation was reported as treatment related AE for 6% for patients on GNX and 0% for patients 
on placebo. Salivary hypersecretion was reported as treatment-related AE for 6% for patients on GNX and

In Pool A (CDD Exposure Set), the most common treatment-related AE was somnolence: 26.5%. Seizure was 
the second most common treatment-related AE: 13.7%. Weight decrease and decreased appetite were 
reported for 2.9% and 4.9% of patients, respectively. Rash as a treatment-related AE was reported for 2 
(2%) patients. 
In the pool with all subjects exposed to GNX (N=1135), the most common drug-related AEs were in CNS 
effects: somnolence, dizziness, headache, sedation and seizures.  
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
A comparable incidence of serious AE (SAEs) was seen between GNX treatment and placebo: 12% vs. 9.8%. 
Three subjects in the GNX group and 1 subject in the placebo group had SAEs that led to dose reduction or 
temporary or permanent withdrawal of the study drug. In the GNX group, two SAEs were considered not to 
be related to GNX (urinary tract infection and bronchitis). While decreased oxygen saturation was reported

for one patient on GNX, the unresponsiveness to stimuli was considered related to GNX and placebo, 
respectively. 
Table 25: Summary of Serious Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by SOC and Preferred Term – (Study 
1042-CDD-3001 17 week Double-blind Phase, Safety Population) 
In all CDD patients who were exposed to GNX (Pool A), the most common reported SAE was seizures: 4.9%.  
Deaths 
As of 30 Jun 2022, thirteen patients died in the total clinical development program of GNX: twelve were 
during or after GNX treatment and one after placebo treatment.  
Three patients in the CDD exposure set died: the most likely causes of death were meningococcal sepsis, 
experienced SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) and cardiac arrest (possibly SUDEP). The first 
two cases are considered not related to GNX, while the latter was considered as possible related to GNX dose 
decrease rather than to the GNX itself.  
In study 0900, two patients died: one patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome died of hepatic failure and one 
patient with (most likely) CDD died of cardiac arrest in the OLE phase of the study. Two patients with 
infantile spasms (IS), three adults with status epilepticus (SE), one patient with drug-resistant partial-onset

seizures and one patient with complex partial seizures randomized to placebo deceased. According to the 
applicant, all cases are not related to GNX.  
Rash, reproductive system AEs and breast disorders 
Rash, reproductive system AEs and breast disorders were firstly considered adverse events of special interest 
(AESI). Rash was included as an AESI in the GNX development program due to its structural and 
pharmacologic similarity to endogenous allopregnanolone, allopregnanolone being derived from progesterone, 
which is associated with autoimmune dermatitis and rash.  
In the DB phase of study 3001, rash was reported for 2 (4%) of patients on GNX and for 2 (3.9%) on 
placebo. One subject (2%) on GNX reported dermatitis atopic. In the CDD Exposure Set population, 9 (8.8%) 
subjects reported a TEAE in the reproductive system and breast disorders SOC and 7 (6.9%) subjects 
reported rash. In all patients exposed to GNX regardless of indication (Pool B, N=1135), rash was reported in 
39 (3.4%) of patients. 38 Of these patients received a daily dose of between 1000 and 1800mg. 
In all CDD patients treated with GNX, the following AESIs in the reproductive system and breast disorders 
were reported: dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia and polymenorrhoea were reported for 2 (2.0%), other AE’s in 
this SOC were each reported once (1%).  
In all patients exposed to GNX regardless of indication, 48 (4.2%) of patients reported AESIs of reproductive 
system and breast disorders. 47 of these patients received a daily dose between 1000 and 1800mg. 
Dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia was reported for 6 (0.5%) of patients, menstruation irregular and 
polymenorrhoea was reported for 5 (0.4%) of patients, and vaginal haemorrhage was reported for 4 (0.4%) 
of patients. Breast tenderness was reported for 7 (0.6%) of patients. Other AESIs were reported once 
(0.1%).

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
The laboratory evaluations and vital signs were determined in the DB and OL phase of study 3001, study 
0900 and in the 3 safety pools. No clinically relevant changes in laboratory values regarding haematology, 
chemistry, urinalysis or vital signs were observed. 
ECGs and Potential Effects on Cardiac Safety: 
A cardiac safety report assessed cardiac data from non-clinical trials, 4 clinical trials (studies 1042-SE-2001, 
1042-PPD-2002, 1042-PPD-2003) and available results from the ongoing study 1042-CDD-3001 DB phase. In 
addition, a Phase 1 thorough QT/QTc study 1042-TQT-1001 provided data related to the effects of maximal 
steady-state GNX exposures following oral dosing and is intended to provide information that will further 
inform the understanding of the effects of GNX on QTc and other ECG parameters. The study showed that 
adverse events associated with GNX in this study were: dizziness (10 [17.5%] of 57 subjects), somnolence 
(9 [15.8%] of 57 subjects), fatigue (4 [7.0%] of 57 subjects each), headache and nausea (3 [5.3%] of 57 
subjects each), and dyspepsia and gastritis (2 [3.5%] of 57 subjects each). No clinically meaningful signals of 
QTc prolongation or other cardiovascular toxicities have been observed in clinical trials to date.  
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
The results from the subgroup analyses for intrinsic factors (age [<12 and ≥12 years old], race, ethnicity, and 
weight suggest that the safety profile of GNX is similar in several subgroups. Regarding gender, drug-related 
somnolence was reported for 35% of males (n=7) and 28% of females (n=23); for drug-related seizures this 
was 25% for males and 24.4% for females, and for drug-related sedation this was 10% for males and 2.4% 
for females. 
Extrinsic Factors 
The results from the subgroup analyses for geographic region did not reveal differences. The GNX oral 
suspension (50 mg/mL) demonstrated 2-fold and 3-fold higher exposure (by Cmax and AUC0-inf, 
respectively) when administered under high-fat, fed conditions compared to fasted levels. To ensure 
sufficient bioavailability of GNX, it should be taken with food. In clinical trials with CDD subjects, doses were 
administered following a meal or snack. Therefore, no additional safety concerns are expected from food 
effects. 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
Given the nature of CDD and the age of the patients included, no pregnancies were reported for the CDD 
population. 
GNX is excreted in human milk. Concentrations of ganaxolone in breast milk were approximately 4-fold 
higher than in plasma.

2.6.8.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Concomitant ASMs 
Concomitant medication use was evaluated for the CDD Exposures Set. Most subjects in the CDD Exposure 
Set received at least 1 concomitant ASM (97.1%). The median duration of concomitant ASM use during the 
study in the CDD Exposure Set was 1446.0 days (range 1 to 6977 days).  
The most common concomitant ASMs were valproate sodium (33.3%), clobazam (31.4%), levetiracetam 
(25.5%), and vigabatrin (19.6%). 
Additional analyses showed that for concomitant valproate use, somnolence was the most reported AE when 
valproate and GNX were used concomitantly: 55.6% (n=10). This was lower for patients on GNX, who did not 
use valproate concomitantly: 21.9% (n=7). For the other ASMs the incidence of somnolence was comparable 
or lower when concomitantly used with GNX.  
For concomitant clobazam use, the overall incidence of AEs was higher when clobazam was not used 
concomitantly for both patients on GNX and placebo. 
The incidence of somnolence and seizure is comparable in the patients on GNX regardless of concomitant 
levetiracetam use. Sedation is more frequent when levetiracetam is not concomitantly used: 8.1 vs 0%. 
For concomitant vigabatrin use, sedation was the most common AE: 30% (n=3) when concomitantly used 
with GNX. When vigabatrin was not concomitantly used, somnolence was most common: 40% (n=16), with 
an incidence higher than when vigabatrin was concomitantly used with GNX (40 vs 10%). The incidence of 
seizures was lower when vigabatrin was concomitantly used with GNX (0 vs 12.5%). 
Other CNS depressants 
GNX is associated with CNS-effects. Concomitant use of GNX with CNS depressants may increase the risk of 
sedation, somnolence, and gait disturbances which have been reported as drug-related TEAEs for GNX.  
Alcohol 
In animal models, GNX has been shown to potentiate the effects of alcohol in a similar manner to that of 
benzodiazepines and valproic acid. No reports of adverse effects with GNX and adult epileptic subjects have 
been reported. However, subjects should be prohibited from drinking alcohol during treatment with GNX. 
2.6.8.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the DB phase of study 3001, seizures were the most reported AE leading to discontinuation for both the 
placebo group (2 (3.9%)) and the GNX group (2 (4.0%)). In the OL phase, seizure was the most reported AE 
leading to discontinuation for patients who switched to GNX: 3 (6.7%) vs 0 in the patients who remained on 
GNX treatment. In the pool of CDD patients exposed to GNX, 13 (12.7%) of patients discontinued because of 
AEs. Most reported AEs were seizures, 5 (4.9%) and somnolence 3 (2.9%). 
In Pool B, containing all exposed subjects to GNX, 128 (11.3%) subjects have discontinued the study drug 
due to AEs. This is comparable to the pool of CDD patients exposed to GNX. The most common AEs leading 
to discontinuation in Pool B were fatigue (21 [1.9%] subjects), dizziness (19 [1.7%] subjects), somnolence 
(19 [1.7%] subjects), and seizure (12 [1.1%] subjects.

2.6.8.8.  Supportive safety data 
Open-label extension of Study 3001 
Of the 88 patients who continued from the double-blind phase into the OLE phase, 40 (45.5%) patients were 
ongoing in the OLE phase as of the data cut-off point of 30 Jun 2022 (19 [44.2%] patients in the GNX group, 
21 [46.7%] patients in the PBO group). Sixty-one patients (69.3%) were treated in the OLE for at least 1 
year, 50 (56.8%) were treated in the OLE for at least 2 years, and 11 (12.5%) were treated in the OLE for at 
least 3 years. The patient with the longest treatment time in the OLE was treated for at least 3.5 years. 
A total of 41 patients (46.6%) in the OLE phase reported a total of 101 AEs that were considered related to 
study drug. Treatment-related AEs that were reported in > 2 subjects were: somnolence (15 patients, 
17.0%), seizure (10 patients, 11.4%), decreased appetite (5 patients, 5.7%), weight decreased (4 patients, 
4.5%), attention-seeking behaviour and gait disturbance (3 patients each, 3.4%).  
Severe CNS AEs were seizure (3 patients, 3.4%; 5 severe AEs) and somnolence and status epilepticus (2 
patients each, 2.3%; 2 severe AEs each).  
Serious AEs were: seizure (6 patients, 6.8%), pneumonia (5 patients 5.7%), acute respiratory failure, 
dehydration, and pneumonia aspiration (3 patients each, 3.4%), Covid-19, influenza, pneumonia viral, 
sepsis, status epilepticus, and vomiting. 
A total of 11 patients (12.5%) discontinued study drug due to an AE during the OLE phase.  
Two patients were 19 years old at time of study 3001 enrolment and seven patients turned 18 years of age 
during the OLE phase. The reported AEs seems to be in line with the observed safety data in the overall study

population. Of the 44 TEAE’s, four were SAEs: three were considered unrelated to study treatment (sepsis, 
urinary tract infection, seizure) and one was classified as related (unresponsive to stimuli). In the SOC of 
Infections and Infestations, AEs were also reported in the 9 adults: 11 TEAEs, generally mild or moderate, 
with the exception of two SAEs considered not related to GNX (sepsis and urinary tract infection). 
Withdrawal 
Based on non-clinical data, GNX was tapered off in clinical practice to minimize withdrawal effects or 
symptoms. 13.7% of patients on GNX compared to 2% of patients on placebo reported AEs after 
discontinuation. For the patients who were randomised to GNX, vomiting and pyrexia (3.9% each) were most 
reported AEs. AEs like diarrhoea and seizures were reported in 1.0% and 2.0% of patients, respectively.  
2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
GNX has not been previously authorised and marketed in EU. 
GNX was approved by the FDA in the US on 18 March 2022. No new safety information has been reported 
since the date of commercialization. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety database 
The main evidence for the safety profile of GNX in CDD comes from the completed double-blind (DB), 
randomized, placebo-controlled study 3001. Supportive evidence comes from 7 paediatric patients with CDD 
who are included in a 26-week open-label, proof-of-concept basket study 0900 in children with rare genetic 
epilepsies.  
At the cut-off date of 24 February 2021, 101 patients are included in DB phase of study 3001. In addition, 
Pool A (CDD Exposure Set) provides safety data of 102 CDD patients exposed to GNX in study 3001 (DB and 
OLE) and 0900. These patients received GNX via the proposed route of administration (oral) and according to 
the proposed posology. 
Other safety pools include an All Exposure Set (n= 1135, including all subjects exposed to GNX regardless of 
the indication and formulation used) and the Paediatric Exposure Set (n= 238, including only paediatric 
safety data [<18 years]).  
At the data cut-off of 30 June 2022, the mean exposure duration for all CDD patients treated with GNX is 
613.7 days; the median is 702.5 days. 70.5% Of patients have an exposure for ≥12 months, 58% of patients 
have an exposure for ≥18 months, 48.9% for ≥24 months and 8% for ≥36 months.  
Adverse events 
Most reported adverse events (AEs) were in the domains of Nervous System Disorders, Infections and 
Infestations, Gastrointestinal disorders, General Disorders and Administration Site, Respiratory, Thoracic and 
Mediastinal Disorders, Psychiatric Disorders and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders.  
Compared to placebo, the incidence of the following AEs was higher in GNX: somnolence, sedation, pyrexia 
and upper respiratory tract infection. The most common reported AE for patients on placebo were seizure and 
vomiting. Some of the observed AE’s may comply with the normal background incidence in paediatrics 
Assessment report

Page 110/132 
 
 
 
subjects, i.e. diarrhoea, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux, vomiting and ear infection. Others may be 
disease-related, like gastrointestinal disorders and salivary hypersecretion.  
In the DB phase of study 3001, 70% of the AEs reported for the GNX group were considered to be treatment-
related by the investigator versus 43.1% for placebo. The most common treatment-related AEs for GNX were 
somnolence, seizure, sedation, constipation and salivary hypersecretion. 
In the OLE phase of study 3001 (data cut-off 30 Jun 2022) and in the Pool containing all CDD patients 
exposed to GNX, the observed AEs were in line with the DB phase of the study. For the all exposure set (Pool 
B, N=1135) the most common drug-related AEs were CNS effects: somnolence, dizziness, headache, 
sedation and seizures. The incidence of somnolence and headache was dose-dependent. For dizziness, 
sedation and seizures, there was a suggestion of dose-dependency. This seems in line with non-clinical 
findings of dose-dependent incidence, duration, and severity of CNS-effects. 
The incidence of drug-related somnolence (34% vs. 5.9%) and sedation (6.0% vs. 3.9%) in the DB phase of 
Study 3001 was higher in the GNX group than in placebo. For lethargy (4.0% vs 3.9%) the incidence was 
comparable. All three are considered to fall within the spectrum of sedation. The applicant provided additional 
informaiton showing that most events of somnolence, sedation and lethargy occurred relatively quick after 
the initiation of GNX treatment and most cases resolved during treatment. It appears that over time patients 
develop tolerance for GNX. 
Decreased appetite was reported for 2.2% of patients who switched from placebo to GNX vs. 7% for patients 
who remained on GNX in the OLE phase of study 3001. Also, weight decrease was reported for 2.2% of 
patients who switched from placebo to GNX vs. 4.7% for patients who remained on GNX. For one patient, the 
drug-related weight decrease was a serious AE. It is acknowledged that CDD is associated with 
gastrointestinal problems. The 3 out of 56 patients who had a week 132 visit had a median change from 
baseline of -1.3kg; this implies that 2 out of 3 patients lost weight. Moreover, these two patients received 
doses between 1000-1800mg, which is in line with the proposed posology. Additional information is provided 
indicating that for both patients the events of weight decrease were considered related to GNX and led to 
dose reductions. For both patients the events resolved. It should be noted that the 1 patient on a dose 
>1800mg is also losing weight until week 52 visit, and at week 68 his change from baseline is 0.9 kg which is 
considered comparable to baseline. 
The relevant adverse drugs reactions are appropriately reflected in the Product Information. 
Serious adverse events 
In the DB phase of study 3001, three subjects in the GNX group and 1 subject in the placebo group had 
serious AEs (SAEs) that led to dose reduction or temporary or permanent withdrawal of the study drug. The 
incidence of SAEs was comparable between the GNX and the placebo groups (12% vs 9.8%, respectively). 
The most frequently reported SAEs were under the SOC of infections and infestations (6% in the GNX group; 
3.9% in the placebo group). In the OLE phase, SAEs were more frequent for both the placebo and the GNX 
groups (24.4% and 25.6%, respectively). Events in the Nervous System Disorders SOC were the most 
common (11.1% in the PBO group; 11.6% in the GNX group), as well as events in the Infections and 
Infestations SOC (8.9% in the PBO group; 14% in the GNX group). Based on the available data, it is not 
possible to rule out that the occurrence of these SAEs under the SOC of infections and infestations was not 
related to the assumption of GNX. Therefore, they should be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance 
and with the development of GNX in other indications, especially in a paediatric setting. 
In the OLE phase of study 3001, the most common SAE was seizure: 6.8% of patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023 
Page 111/132 
 
 
 
In all CDD patients exposed to GNX, the most commonly reported SAE was seizures 4.9%, dehydration, 
aspiration pneumonia and vomiting (2.9%). Of note, SAEs were reported more frequently in the GNX group 
(25.5%) than in the placebo group (9.8%), but the greater duration of exposure may explain this. Of the 
SAEs considered treatment-related, no clear profile can be disentangled because of the low number of events 
and the variety of events.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Rash 
Rash was included as an adverse event of special interest (AESI) in the GNX development program due to its 
structural and pharmacologic similarity to endogenous allopregnanolone. Allopregnanolone is derived from 
progesterone, associated with autoimmune dermatitis and rash. Rash was reported in with incidences of 4% 
of patients on GNX and for 3.9% on placebo in the DB phase of study 3001, 4.4% in the OL phase of study 
3001, 6.9% of all CDD patients and 3.4% in all patients exposed to GNX (N=1135). Two cases of non-serious 
rash as a drug-related AE for GNX were reported in DB phase Study 3001. One case was mild; the other was 
considered moderate. Throughout the GNX clinical development program, there have been no cases of 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or any other clinically important rashes reported in 
the clinical development program. The additional analyses show that a history of allergic reactions does not 
predispose subjects to later cutaneous adverse reactions when taking GNX, nor is there currently evidence 
that GNX use is associated with an increased risk of rash. It is agreed that rash can be removed from the 
listed AESI. 
During the CHMP scientific advice, it appeared that the 13-w juvenile toxicity study in rats to assess potential 
effects on bone density and sexual maturation/reproductive performance had monitored neonates up to 49 
days of life, equivalent to 12 years of age, just before adolescence. Thus, effects on sexual maturation were 
not explored non-clinically. Although it was acknowledged that CDD patients are unlikely to give birth, it was 
strongly advised to monitor bone density and also sexual maturation during phase 3. 
Reproductive system and breast disorders 
The reported incidences of AEs like menorrhagia, menstruation irregular, oligomenorrhoea and 
polymenorrhoea fall within the incidences in a normal population. Therefore no solid conclusions can be 
drawn. These events should be monitored in adolescents through routine pharmacovigilance and reported in 
upcoming PSUR. 
Sexual maturation 
Tanner stages for patients in study 3001 are provided. Clinically, at baseline, most patients were in Tanner 
Stage 1, which is in line with the mean age of the cohort of 7.3 years. A Tanner staging at week 52 is 
available for about half of the patients. With this limited number of patients and a short duration of exposure, 
which is clearly before the age at the start of sexual maturation, no proper assessment can be made. Delays 
in sexual maturation and growth were observed non-clinically. It seems reasonable that the non-clinically 
observed delay in sexual maturation is caused by the delay in growth. Effects on sexual maturation and 
growth need to be followed up for a longer period, considering that these adverse events have a longer 
latency. In the RMP, sexual maturation and growth are included as an important potential risk under ‘long 
term safety’ in the safety specifications. The applicant will participate to the CDKL5 Registry, with questions 
dedicated to physical, neurological, and reproductive development asked at baseline and annually thereafter. 
In addition, assessments of height and weight will be monitored.

Deaths  
As of 30 Jun 2022, thirteen patients deceased in the total clinical development program of GNX; twelve 
during or after GNX treatment and one after placebo treatment. The relation between GNX and the cause of 
death for most patients is unlikely.  
Laboratory findings 
No clinically relevant changes in laboratory values regarding haematology, chemistry, urinalysis or vital signs 
were observed.  
ECGs and Potential Effects on Cardiac Safety 
In a 1-year dog toxicity study, transient sinus tachycardia (>190 beats per minute [bpm]) was observed 
after 3 months of dosing in 4 animals and was accompanied by decreased PR and QT interval but no 
treatment effect on QRS duration or QTc. Because of these non-clinical findings, the CHMP advised sufficient 
ECG monitoring during the clinical trial. 
TQT Study (1042-TQT-1001) showed that adverse events associated with GNX in this study were: dizziness 
(10 [17.5%] of 57 subjects), somnolence (9 [15.8%] of 57 subjects), fatigue (4 [7.0%] of 57 subjects each), 
headache and nausea (3 [5.3%] of 57 subjects each), and dyspepsia and gastritis (2 [3.5%] of 57 subjects 
each). This is in line with the known safety profile of GNX, which mainly consists of CNS-related adverse 
events. This study investigated higher doses than what will be used in clinical practice in CDD. With regard to 
short-term safety, these results are reassuring.  
For all CDD patients, tachycardia paroxysmal was reported for one patient on placebo and for one patient on 
GNX, tachycardia was reported. In the large pool of all treated subjects with GNX, bradycardia and 
tachycardia were reported for two patients each. Other cardiac preferred terms were reported for one patient 
each. These low incidences are considered to fall within the incidences of a normal population.  
An analysis of the available clinical safety data does not reveal an apparent increased risk of cardiac arrest in 
study participants exposed to GNX at this time, however the risk cannot be excluded and these events (in 
particular SAE of cardiac arrest and/or SUDEP) should be promptly reported and trigger additional 
evaluations. 
Special populations 
Two patients were 19 years old at time of study enrolment and seven patients turned 18 years of age during 
the OL phase of the study. For these patients (n= 9) separate safety data has been provided.  The reported 
AEs seems to be in line with the observed safety data in the overall study population. Of the 44 TEAE’s, four 
were SAEs: three were considered unrelated to study treatment (sepsis, urinary tract infection, seizure) and 
one was classified as related (unresponsive to stimuli). In the SOC of Infections and Infestations, AEs were 
also reported in the 9 adults: 11 TEAEs, generally mild or moderate, with the exception of two SAEs 
considered not related to GNX (sepsis and urinary tract infection). The reported AEs like menorrhagia, 
menstruation irregular, oligomenorrhoea and polymenorrhoea fall within the incidence in a normal 
population, but at the moment no definitive conclusion can be drawn. Therefore, these events should be 
monitored in adolescents through routine pharmacovigilance and reported in upcoming PSUR.  
The Study 1042-IRF-1001 showed that renal impairment has no impact on the exposure of ganaxolone, a 
single dose of ganaxolone 300 mg was well tolerated in adults with normal and severe renal impairment. 
With regard to the use of GNX in patients with pre-existing hepatic failure (Study 1042-IHF-1001), adverse 
events seem in line with the safety profile of GNX. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment reported more 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023 
Page 113/132 
 
 
 
treatment related AEs. The proposed dosing recommendations and warning for hepatic impairment are 
agreed.  
From the subgroup analyses provided, no apparent differences for several subgroups seemed present. 
Pyrexia was more commonly reported in subjects <12 years old compared with subjects > 12 years old in the 
CDD Exposure Set, which is expected in a paediatric population. TEAEs of seizure were more frequent in 
subjects who worsened during the treatment than in subjects who did not worsen.  
Pregnancy and lactation 
As expected, given the nature of CDD and the age of the patients included, no pregnancies were reported for 
the CDD population and there is limited data on the use of GNX in pregnant women 
Animal studies did not indicate (in)direct harmful effects. However, the exposure in animals was lower than in 
humans.  
GNX is excreted in human milk. Concentrations of ganaxolone in breast milk were approximately 4-fold 
higher than in plasma. It should therefore be evaluated if breastfeeding should be discontinued or that GNX 
should be discontinued taking into account the benefits of both for the child as well as for the mother. 
The information is appropriately reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
Drug-drug interactions 
No formal DDI studies were conducted. Additional subgroup analyses have been provided. Based on these 
analyses, a warning that other CNS depressants, including other anti-seizure medications, could potentiate 
the effect on somnolence and sedation has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Non-clinical data indicate that patients should not be drinking alcohol while being treated with GNX. In the 
SmPC, a warning not to use alcohol during GNX treatment and interaction with alcohol is included. 
Supportive safety data 
Withdrawal 
Based on non-clinical data, GNX is tapered off in clinical practice to minimize withdrawal effects or symptoms. 
13.7% of patients on GNX compared to 2% of patients on placebo reported AEs after discontinuation. The 
patient randomised to placebo reported hypoxia after discontinuation. For the patients who were randomised 
to GNX, vomiting and pyrexia (3.9% each) were most reported AEs. AEs like diarrhoea and seizures were 
reported in 1.0% and 2.0% of patients, respectively. Down titration at discontinuation is included in section 
4.2 of the SmPC. 
Abuse 
As discussed in the clinical pharmacology sections, the potential for abuse of GNX was evaluated in study 
1042-HAP-1001. Of the three GNX doses evaluated in the study, the 2000mg dose obtained the highest 
scores on all endpoints (maximum daily dose for CDD: 1800mg). It is noted however that the abuse potential 
seems less than for lorazepam 6mg. A limitation of the study is that it only evaluated the abuse potential of 
single-dose GNX in recreational polydrug users. In clinical practice, GNX will be dosed repeatedly in patients 
with CDD, most likely in a controlled setting. Therefore the CHMP agreed that GNX has the potential for 
abuse and a warning is included in section 4.4, with a cross reference to section 5.3.

Overdose 
No intentional overdose or misuse of GNX in clinical studies has been reported to date. Accidental overdose 
has been reported in a total of 4 subjects. All cases of unintentional overdose were resolved. 
Suicidality 
For the CDD population, no information is available. A general warning regarding suicidal behaviour and 
ideation in patients treated with ASMs is included in the SmPC.  
Long term safety 
The long-term safety data for GNX in CDD is limited. 70.5% of patients have an exposure for ≥12 months, 
58% of patients have an exposure for ≥18 months, 48.9% for ≥24 months and 8% for ≥36 months. The long-
term safety of GNX in CDD will be monitored post-authorisation.  
From the safety database all the relevant adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics.

The primary objective of the registry is to 
collect and enable sharing of real-world 
demographic, clinical, PRO, and treatment 
data collected from patients with CDD or 
their legal guardians and ultimately, their 
clinicians.  Secondarily, the CDKL5 Registry 
aims to aid in establishing best practices in 
standard of care for CDD, to inform clinical 
study design by collecting real-world data 
and providing access to the scientific and 
research community, to enable research 
through data sharing, to understand patient 
needs and quality of life factors, and to 
enable rapid recruitment by connecting 
patients to clinical trials.

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements submission 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 18.03.2022. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Ztalmy (ganaxolone) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as ganaxolone is a new active substance and authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The CDKL5 gene is located on the X chromosome. Mutations in certain regions of the CDKL5 gene result in a 
rare X-linked disorder known as CDKL5 deficiency disorder. This disorder manifests as early-onset with 
severe neuro-developmental impairment, behavioural abnormalities and difficult-to-control seizures.  
Neurologic manifestations include deficits in speech or language, limited or complete loss of functional hand 
use, stereotypies, hypotonia, cortical blindness, autistic features, and sleep disturbances. Patients may also 
have dysautonomia, impaired swallowing and constipation. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is currently no treatment approved specifically for seizures associated with CDD. Seizures in CDD are 
treated with anti-seizure medications, corticosteroids, ketogenic diet, vagal nerve stimulation and 
neurosurgery.  
Despite these treatments, patients with CDD remain highly refractory. Thus, there is a need for more 
effective therapies of seizures associated with CDD. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study 3001 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety 
of ganaxolone as adjunctive to concomitant anti-seizure medications for the treatment of seizures associated 
with CDD. The study consisted of a 4-week baseline phase, a 4-week titration phase, and a 13-week 
maintenance phase. Upon completion of the maintenance phase, subjects could enter the open-label 
extension phase, which is ongoing. Subjects on placebo switched to GNX.  
Subjects between 2 – 21 years of age were eligible to enrol into the study if they had a molecular 
confirmation of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic CDKL5 variant, early-onset difficult-to-control seizures and 
neurodevelopmental impairment. In addition, subjects had to have at least 16 major motor seizures per 
month prior to screening and a history of failure to control seizures despite an appropriate trial of 2 or more 
anti-seizure medications.  
A total of 101 subjects were randomized to GNX (n=50) or placebo treatment (n=51). The target dose of 
GNX oral suspension was 63 mg/kg/day for subjects weighing ≤ 28 kg or 1800 mg/day for subjects weighing 
> 28 kg.  
The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in 28-day (median) major motor seizure 
frequency during the 17-week, double-blind treatment phase. Major motor seizures, or primary seizures, are 
defined as bilateral tonic (sustained motor activity ≥ 3 seconds), generalized tonic-clonic, bilateral clonic, 
atonic/drop or focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023 
Page 122/132 
 
 
 
The key secondary endpoints are the 50% responder rate, defined as the number (%) of subjects with a ≥ 
50% reduction from baseline in major motor seizure frequency and the Clinical Global Impression of 
Improvement (CGI-I) by caregivers at the last scheduled visit in the 17-week double-blind treatment phase. 
The CGI-I is scored by Parents/Caregivers and Clinicians separately. 
Additional secondary endpoints are the days of motor seizure freedom, the Clinical Global Impression of 
Change in Seizure Intensity/Duration (CGICSID), the Clinical Global Impression of Change in target domains 
identified by parent/caregiver (CGI-C) and the Caregiver Global Impression of Change in Attention (CGICA).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The percentage change from baseline in median major motor seizure frequency in the maintenance phase 
was -6.49% for subjects in the placebo group and -29.39% for subjects in the GNX group. The median shift 
between groups was -29.31% (95% CI: -51.45; -8.90), indicating a statistically significant improvement in 
the GNX group over placebo (p= 0.0081).  
The number (%) of subjects with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in major motor seizure frequency 
(response rate) numerically favoured the GNX group (12 [24.5%] subjects in the GNX group, 5 [9.8%] 
subjects in the PBO group; 95% CI: -4.7;33.8, p > 0.0643). Over the maintenance phase, there were 15 
subjects in the GNX group (30.6%) and 12 subjects in the PBO group (12.0%) who were considered a 
responder and the difference compared to placebo was nominal statistically significant (p=0.0283) 
The Clinical Global Impression of Change – Improvement (CGI-I) as rated by the Parents/Caregivers, 
reported numerically higher proportions in the GNX treatment group that subjects “minimally improved” 
(27.1% vs. 14.6%) or “much improved” (35.4% vs. 27.1%) compared to the placebo group. A higher 
percentage of subjects were rated as having “no change” by their parents/caregivers in the placebo group 
(45.8%) compared to the GNX group (29.2%).  
In the CGI-I as rated by clinicians, subjects were reported “much improved” equally across the treatment 
groups (14.6% for both treatment groups). The clinicians scored more subjects in the GNX group as 
“minimally improved” than the placebo group (39.6% vs. 27.1% for the GNX and placebo groups, 
respectively). A similar percentage of subjects was reported for “no change” for both treatment arms (33.3% 
vs 39.6% for GNX and placebo, respectively).  
The change from baseline in the percentage of median seizure-free days was 4.91% for subjects in the GNX 
group and 0.17% for subjects in the PBO group, with a median shift from the PBO group to the GNX group of 
1.72% (95% CI: -2.71, 7.84).  
The majority of GNX subjects showed Caregiver Global Impression of Change in Seizure Intensity/Duration 
(CGI-CSID) scores of very much improved (4.4% for GNX vs 2.1% for placebo), much improved (33.3% for 
GNX vs 10.6% for placebo), or minimally improved (24.4% for GNX vs 23.4% for placebo). The nominal p-
value was 0.015 (last visit). 
For the CGICA and CGI-C, at the end of Week 17 the CGICA result favouring GNX group was of only 
“minimally improved” (46.7% vs 29.8% for the PBO group) and the CGI-C result was of only “much 
improved” (44.4% vs 30.4% for the PBO group).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The efficacy of GNX as an adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with CDD in patients from 2 years of 
age is based on a single pivotal study 3001. Thus, the study should be particularly compelling concerning 
internal and external validity, clinical relevance, statistical significance, data quality and internal consistency. 
While a statistically significant reduction in favour of GNX treatment was observed for major motor seizures, 
it was questioned whether the high use of rescue medication could partially explain this effect, as half of the 
subjects in the GNX group received rescue medication at some point. However, the median number of days 
rescue medication used was lower in the GNX arm (462) than in the PBO arm (499). Post-hoc sensitivity 
analysis using a tipping point penalising both treatment arms up to 30% did not affect the treatment 
estimate for the primary endpoint. In the analysis of the 50% responder endpoint, the number of responders 
dropped when rescue medication was seen as non-response, but it remained numerically in favour of the 
GNX arm (24.5% for GNX and 9.8% for PBO, respectively). Thus, rescue medication may have affected the 
efficacy measurement, but this was to a similar degree in both treatment arms, and the treatment difference 
found was not affected.  
Although there is inconsistent support from secondary endpoints, the seizure reduction observed under GNX 
treatment can be considered clinically relevant through the 50% responder rate and cumulative response 
curve analysed over the maintenance period.  
The majority of the study population consisted of children and young adolescents (mean age was 7 years). 
There were 2 “adult” subjects, which were both aged 19 years (one in placebo and one in GNX). In light of 
the limited data available, the available efficacy/safety data in adult patients with CDD, as well as an 
extrapolation exercise, taking into account the seizure characteristics, were discussed. The efficacy obtained 
with GNX in children with CDD cannot be extrapolated to adults with CDD, as disease similarity has not been 
shown between these patient subpopulations. The claim that seizure semiology and disease severity are 
generally stable into adulthood could not be verified through scientific literature. There seems to be no 
natural history data or longitudinal observational data available that supports this. Limited efficacy data have 
been provided on 7 subjects who were 15 years of age at study entry and became > 18 years during the OLE 
phase of the study. The results from these subjects were mixed and did not provide convincing data to start 
treatment with GNX in naïve adults with CDD. Moreover, the results hamper interpretation whether seizure 
semiology remains the same as it only focuses on primary seizure types and lack a comparison to childhood. 
In addition, based on the provided PK modelling simulations, the simulated exposure in adults was reversely 
correlated with bodyweight and therefore it cannot be excluded that the drug may be less effective in adults 
with normal body weight. Although GNX is titrated based on response, higher doses than the maximum dose 
of 1800 mg/day have not been investigated and thus are not recommended. Thus, as efficacy cannot be 
extrapolated, the current data do not support use of GNX in treatment naïve adults. While the data preclude 
use of GNX in treatment naïve adults with CDD, the limited OLE efficacy data do indicate that there is no 
reason to withdraw treatment in adulthood if a patient has initiated treatment during adolescence and 
perceived a clear benefit. These recommendations are included in the agreed restricted indication of Ztalmy.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of GNX was studied in 1930 subjects with different indications: several epileptic syndromes, 
migraine, post-partum depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023 
Page 124/132 
 
 
 
The main evidence of the oral use of GNX in patients with CDD comes from the completed study 1042-CDD-
3001. Supportive evidence comes from seven paediatric patients with CDD who are included in a 26-week 
open-label, proof-of-concept basket study 0900 in children with rare genetic epilepsies.  
Safety Pool A provides data of 102 CDD patients exposed to GNX. These patients received GNX via the 
proposed route of administration (oral) and according to the proposed posology. 
In the DB phase of study 3001, 70% of the AEs reported for the GNX group were considered to be treatment-
related by the investigator versus 43.1% for placebo. The most common treatment-related AEs for GNX were 
somnolence (34%), seizure (10%), sedation, constipation and salivary hypersecretion (all 6%). This profile 
was also observed in the OLE phase of study 3001 and in Pool A. 
The incidence of drug-related somnolence (34% vs 5.9%) and sedation (6.0% vs 3.9%) was higher in the 
GNX group than in the placebo group. For lethargy (4.0% vs 3.9%), the incidence was comparable. All three 
are considered to fall within the spectrum of sedation. 50% Of the patients on GNX and 43.1% of the patients 
on placebo used rescue mediation. All rescue medications were CNS depressants. Additional analyses show 
that the incidence of somnolence-related AEs was not associated with the use of rescue medication. 
Decreased appetite was reported for 2.2% of patients who switched from placebo to GNX vs 7% for patients 
who remained on GNX in the OLE phase of study 3001. Also, weight decrease was reported for 2.2% of 
patients who switched from placebo to GNX vs. 4.7% for patients who remained on GNX. The drug-related 
weight decrease was a serious AE for one patient. 
In the DB phase of study 3001, three subjects in the GNX group and 1 subject in the placebo group had serious 
SAEs that led to dose reduction or temporary or permanent withdrawal of the study drug. In the GNX group, 
two SAEs were considered not being related to GNX (urinary tract infection and bronchitis). No causality for 
decreased oxygen saturation in one patient on GNX could be concluded.  
In  the  OLE  phase  of  study  3001,  the  most  common  SAE  in  both  groups  was  seizure:  4.7%  for  patients 
continuing GNX treatment and 6.7% for patients who switched from placebo to GNX. In all CDD patients who 
were exposed to GNX, the most commonly reported SAE was seizures: 4.9%. The imbalance between placebo 
and GNX seems to be explained by a longer exposure to GNX in the OLE. 
In the DB phase of study 3001, two patients on GNX and four on placebo discontinued because of AEs. Seizures 
were the most reported AE leading to discontinuation for both the placebo group; 2 (3.9%), as the GNX group 
2  (4.0%).  In  the  OLE  phase,  ten  patients  who  switched  from  placebo  to  GNX  discontinued  because  of  AEs 
versus  one  patient  in  the  group  who  remained  on  GNX.  Seizures  were  the  most  reported  AE  leading  to 
discontinuation for both patients who switched to GNX. In the pool of CDD patients exposed to GNX, 13 (12.7%) 
of patients discontinued because of AEs; the most reported AEs were seizures and somnolence. 
Rash was included as an adverse event of special interest (AESI) in the GNX development program due to its 
structural  and  pharmacologic  similarity  to  endogenous  allopregnanolone.  However,  since  the  accumulated 
evidence suggests that the reports of treatment-emergent skin rashes reported do not differ from non-serious 
rashes  that  are  relatively  commonly  encountered,  and  there  has  not  been  evidence  to  date  of  significant 
autoimmune  skin  reactions  to  GNX,  the  applicant  decided  to  remove  rash  as  an  AESI.  One  mild  and  one 
moderate  case  of  rash  as  a  drug-related  AE  for  GNX  were  reported  in  DB  phase  Study  3001.  Both  were 
considered  non-serious.  Throughout  the  GNX  clinical  development  program,  there  have  been  no  cases  of 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or any other clinically important rashes reported in the 
clinical development program. The additional analyses show that a history of allergic reactions is not associated 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023 
Page 125/132 
 
 
 
with rash, nor is there currently evidence that GNX use is associated with an increased risk of rash. It is agreed 
that rash can be removed from the listed AESI. 
As of 30 Jun 2022, thirteen patients deceased in the total clinical development program of GNX: twelve during 
or after GNX treatment and one after placebo treatment. The relation between GNX and the cause of death for 
most patients is unlikely. Three patients in the CDD exposure set deceased; the most likely cause of death is 
meningococcal sepsis, experienced SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) and cardiac arrest (possibly 
SUDEP).  The  first  two  cases  are  considered  not  related  to  GNX,  while  the  latter  was  considered  as  possible 
related to GNX dose decrease rather than to the GNX itself. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Non-clinical and PK uncertainties still exist concerning the metabolites formed in humans.  
GNX is rapidly and extensively metabolized. In the mass balance studies, the excretion of the radioactivity 
was slow, with a half-life of 413 hours. This could be due to metabolites with a long half-life. Due to 
accumulation, the main metabolites at steady-state may differ from those following a single dose. The 
steady-state metabolite pattern of GNX has been evaluated in Study 8333043. In this study 
ganaxolone+O+gluc and Ganaxolone+2O were identified as major human steady-state metabolites. 
However, due to misinterpretation of results, possible stability issues and the lack of appropriate reference 
metabolite compounds, the identity of the main steady-state metabolites could not be confirmed and the 
study cannot be used as supportive evidence. 
Based on single dose data, metabolites oxy-didehydro-ganaxolone (M60b = M2) and potentially also oxy-
dehydro-ganaxolone sulfate (M43 = M17) appear to be contributing to the long half-life of the radioactivity 
and are, therefore, possibly the most important metabolites at steady-state. Additional characterization work 
is ongoing for M43= M17 and the applicant commits to submit the results of this characterisation once 
available (category 3 study, as listed in the RMP). 
As the GNX metabolite pattern at steady state remains unclear, the applicant commits to characterise the 
GNX metabolite pattern at steady state (category 3 study, as listed in the RMP). 
The putative major human metabolite M2 demonstrated no functional activity at the GABAA receptor. 
However, a potential hormonal effect of metabolite M2 at clinical exposures cannot be excluded. M2 was 
considered not genotoxic in a standard battery of genotoxicity assays. However, in a short-term repeat-dose 
toxicity study in rats, findings in the seminal vesicles and prostate glands of males were observed. These 
findings could potentially be treatment-related and clinically relevant. A stepwise approach for the non-clinical 
characterization of the safety profile of M2 is still ongoing and will be conducted post-approval (category 3 
studies, as listed in the RMP).  
The clinical safety database in CDD is relatively small (101 patients are included in DB phase of study 3001 at 
the cut-off date of 24 February 2021). The number of adults who were treated with GNX is limited: two 
patients were 19 years old at time of study enrolment and seven patients turned 18 years of age during the 
OLE phase of the study. For these patients (n= 9) separate safety data has been provided. The reported AEs 
seems to be in line with the observed safety data in the overall study population. The safety provided in 
adults with CDD is not considered comprehensive, nor useful to justify the extrapolation of the indication to 
adults with CDD. However, the applicant accepted the restricted indication to use in children/adolescents. 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023 
Page 126/132 
 
 
 
  
Long-term safety data for GNX in CDD is limited, and there are some concerns concerning the long-term 
safety of GNX, especially sexual maturation and growth. A delay in sexual maturation was observed in non-
clinical studies. Tanner stages for study 3001 are provided. At baseline, most patients included were in 
Tanner Stage 1, this is compliant with the mean age of the cohort of 7.3 years. A Tanner staging at week 52 
is available for about half of the patients. Due to the limited number of patients with Tanner stages, no 
proper assessment can be made. 
Limited discussion on growth is available. Instead, descriptive data are provided. It is acknowledged that 
CDD is associated with gastrointestinal problems. The data implies that 2 out of 3 patients lost weight at 
week 132 while receiving a dose in line with the proposed posology. Additional information indicated that for 
both patients the events of weight decrease were considered related to GNX and led to dose reductions. For 
both patients the events resolved. It is agreed that based on these data no amendments are made to the 
SmPC. It seems reasonable that the non-clinically observed delay in sexual maturation is caused by the delay 
in growth. Effects on sexual maturation and growth need to be followed up for a longer period, considering 
that these adverse events have a longer latency. The applicant will participate in the CDKL5 Registry and 
questions dedicated to physical, neurological, and reproductive development will be asked at baseline and 
annually thereafter. In addition, assessments of height and weight will be monitored.  
An analysis of the available clinical safety data does not reveal an apparent increased risk of cardiac arrest in 
study  participants  exposed  to  GNX  at  this  time.  Though,  the  risk  cannot  be  excluded  and  these  events  (in 
particular SAE of cardiac arrest and/or SUDEP) should be closely monitored, be promptly reported and trigger 
additional evaluations.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment with GNX resulted in a clinically relevant reduction in major motor seizures associated with CDD as 
reflected in the median seizure frequency, 50% responder rate and cumulative response curve.  
GNX treatment is associated with somnolence and sedation. This is consistent with the safety profiles of other 
anti-seizure medications. Somnolence and sedation occurred relatively quick after GNX initiation, and most 
cases resolved during treatment.  
The long-term safety data in patients is limited. A delay in sexual maturation and growth was observed after 
exposure to GNX in non-clinical studies, and preliminary studies with putative major human metabolite M2 did 
not exclude a potential hormonal effect of M2. Since GNX is a chronic treatment in growing children, evaluation 
of the possible impact of GNX on sexual maturation and growth is important. Effects on sexual maturation and

growth have a long latency, therefore a long follow-up period is needed. Sexual maturation and growth are 
included  as  an  important  potential  risk  under  ‘long  term  safety’  in  the  safety  specifications.  In  the  CDKL5 
Registry, in which the applicant will participate, questions dedicated to sexual maturation and the assessment 
of growth will be investigated at baseline and annually thereafter.  
Extrapolation of efficacy from children to adults with CDD in not possible and in view of the limited efficacy 
data from subjects who became >18 years during the OLE phase of the study, the indication of GNX should 
be restricted to use in children and adolescents. However, for patients, who initiated treatment in 
childhood/adolescence, for whom a clear benefit is observed treatment with GNX can be continued when they 
reach adulthood. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the provided data and argumentation, treatment with GNX is approvable for use in children and 
adolescents. GNX treatment may be continued into adulthood in patients who initiated in 
childhood/adolescence if a clear benefit has been observed. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
As part of a pilot program ‘CHMP early contact with patient organizations’, relevant patient organizations for 
CDD were contacted by the EMA. The aim is to enable patients to share their experiences, concerns and 
needs related to their condition with the Rapporteurs/CHMP so that this can be considered in a timely manner 
during the assessment process, if appropriate. The feedback received indicated that additional medication for 
CDD is welcomed.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit risk balance of Ztalmy (ganaxolone) for the adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures 
associated with cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) in patients 2 to 17 years of 
age is positive. Ztalmy may be continued in patients 18 years of age and older.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Ztalmy is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Ztalmy is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with cyclin-dependent kinase-
like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) in patients 2 to 17 years of age. Ztalmy may be continued in 
patients 18 years of age and older.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Assessment report  
EMA/267469/2023 
Page 130/132 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any 
agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency, 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that ganaxolone is to be qualified as a 
new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0171/2021 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

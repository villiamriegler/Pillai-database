2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
In patients with breast cancer, melanoma, HNSCC, and multiple other solid tumor cancers, the ability to 
identify whether the cancer has spread greatly influences patients’ outcomes and future treatment. 
Intraoperative lymphatic mapping (ILM) and lymph node biopsy have been used in cancer patients to 
evaluate the association of the tumour with the lymphatic system and determine whether the primary 
tumour has spread to the regional lymph nodes. ILM is a procedure whereby a surgeon tracks lymphatic 
drainage (anatomic nexuses of lymphatic channels) from a tumour or tumour bed using a visually tracked 
colorimetric agent (such as a vital blue dye [VBD]) and/or a gamma emitting radiolabelled agent (used in 
conjunction with a gamma camera and/or an intraoperative gamma detection probe). Lymph nodes that 
are found to contain the injected agent and express such anatomical connections from the tumour have 
the highest likelihood to harbour metastatic disease and are often called ‘sentinel’ lymph nodes (or SLNs). 
These lymph nodes may be selectively removed as extended lymphatic dissection is known to result in 
significantly increased morbidity in many patients. The pathology assessment of the removed SLNs 
completes the diagnostic process. 
Currently there are two types of agents that are widely employed for mapping lymphatic structures: 
1. Radiopharmaceuticals, e.g., Tc 99m-labeled Nanocis, Nanocoll, and sulfur colloid. 
2. Colorimetric agents, e.g., VBD, which, worldwide, include but are not limited to Lymphazurin (isosulfan 
blue), Patent Blue V, and methylene blue. 
Worldwide, the most commonly used agents for ILM mapping in breast cancer and melanoma are Tc 
99m-labelled colloids. According to the 2009 European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) General Recommendations for 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014  
Page 8/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sentinel Node Diagnostics the agents most used in Europe are Tc 99m human serum albumin colloids 
(including albumin nanocolloid, Nanocoll, and Senti-Scint). 
This Centralised application concerns Lymphoseek containing tilmanocept, a diagnostic receptor-targeted 
radiopharmaceutical to be used in the delineation and localisation of lymph nodes. 
Lymphoseek accumulates in lymphatic tissue by specifically binding to mannose binding receptors (MBRs; 
CD206) that reside on the surface of lymph-node resident dendritic cells and macrophages.  Lymphoseek 
is a wholly synthetic macromolecule consisting of multiple units of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid 
(DTPA) and mannose, each attached to a 10 kDa dextran backbone.  The mannose moieties act as a 
substrate for the receptor, and the DTPA serves as a chelating moiety for radiolabelling with Tc-99m. It is 
claimed that Lymphoseek’s small diameter permits enhanced diffusion into lymphatic channels and blood 
capillaries, resulting in rapid injection site clearance.  Upon entry into the blood, it is claimed that the 
agent binds to receptors in the liver or is filtered by the kidney and accumulates in the urinary bladder. 
The Lymphoseek cold kit compromises vials containing tilmanocept (drug substance) to be reconstituted 
and radiolabelled with Tc-99m, and locally injected near a tumour (i.e., intradermal [ID], subcutaneous 
[SC], Intratumoral, or peritumoral [PT] injection).  Lymphoseek is not intended for systemic/intravenous 
(IV) injection. 
The proposed indication for Lymphoseek (the reconstituted solution for injection containing technetium 
Tc 99m tilmanocept) was:  
Lymphoseek is a diagnostic receptor-targeted radiopharmaceutical used in the delineation and 
localisation of lymph nodes. Lymphoseek is used intraoperatively for evaluation of 
tumour-draining lymph nodes with a handheld gamma detection probe, and may be used for 
complementary preoperative external gamma detection-based imaging. 
The final indication for Lymphoseek was: 
This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
Radiolabelled Lymphoseek is indicated for imaging and intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph 
nodes draining a primary tumour in adult patients with breast cancer, melanoma, or localised 
squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.   
External imaging and intraoperative evaluation may be performed using a gamma detection 
device. 
The medicinal product should only be administered by trained healthcare professionals with technical 
expertise in performing and interpreting sentinel lymph node mapping procedures.  
The recommended dose is 50 micrograms tilmanocept radiolabelled with technetium Tc 99m at 18.5 MBq 
for same day surgery or 74 MBq for next day surgery.  The dose of 50 micrograms should not be adjusted 
for body weight differences.  The total injection amount should not exceed 50 micrograms tilmanocept, 
with a total maximum radioactivity of 74 MBq (2.0 mCi) per dose.   
Following reconstitution and labelling, Lymphoseek is intended to be injected in close proximity to the 
tumour and used in preoperative gamma detection imaging in conjunction with a stationary gamma 
camera (scintigraphy), single photon emissioncomputed tomography (SPECT), or SPECT/computerized 
tomography SPECT/CT, and/or intraoperatively in conjunction with a gamma detection probe to localise 
sentinel lymph nodes in the lymphatic pathway draining the tumour. 
This medicinal product must be radiolabelled before administration to the patient.  The radiolabelled 
product is a clear, colourless solution with no visible particles. Following radiolabelling, administration can 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014

be by either intradermal, subcutaneous, intratumoural, or peritumoural injection.  For melanoma, 
administration is intradermal in single or multiple divided injections. For breast cancer, administration is 
intradermal, subareolar (single or multiple divided injections) or peritumoural (multiple divided 
injections). For squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, administration is peritumoural (multiple 
divided injections). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation containing 250 micrograms 
of tilmanocept as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: trehalose, dihydrate, glycine (E640), sodium ascorbate (E301), stannous chloride 
dihydrate (E512), sodium hydroxide (E524), hydrochloric acid (E507), nitrogen (E941) and water for 
injections.  
The product is available in type I glass vial with a butyl rubber stopper sealed with a flip-off seal. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Tilmanocept is a new chemical entity and a novel radiodiagnostic imaging agent, targeting the 
radioisotope, technetium-99m to a mannose-binding protein that resides on the surface of dendritic cells 
and macrophages. Tilmanocept consists of a macromolecule of multiple units of 
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and mannose, each attached synthetically to a dextran 
backbone.  The mannose acts as a substrate for the receptor (mannose-binding protein), with the DTPA 
serving as a chelating agent for labelling with 99mTc.  
The chemical name of tilmanocept  is dextran, 3 [(2-aminoethyl)thio]propyl 17-carboxy-10, 13, 
16-tris(carboxymethyl)-8-oxo-4-thia-7, 10, 13, 16-tetraazaheptadec-1-yl 
3-[[2-[[1-imino-2-(D-mannopyranosylthio)ethyl]amino]thio]propyl ether and has the following 
structure: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014  
Page 10/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The structure of tilmanocept is a mixture of many possible molecular permutations. Techniques that 
acquire collective or average based signals such as NMR and FT-IR were used to characterise the active 
substance, which are more appropriate than techniques looking at individual components, such as mass 
spectrometry.  
The active substance, tilmanocept is off-white to buff-coloured powder. Tilmanocept is very soluble in 
water, insoluble in alcohol and moderately hygroscopic.  Since the substance is to be formulated into a 
true solution prior to lyophilisation during the manufacture of the finished product, its polymorphism was 
not studied. An average molecule of the substance contains approximately 62 glucopyranosyl units, each 
with 5 stereo centres, with the side chains having further stereo centres. Therefore, it is not possible to 
determine the absolute stereochemistry of tilmanocept by typical analytical techniques and this is 
acceptable. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured in one manufacturing site. 
Tilmanocept is synthesised in 4 main steps using commercially available well defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications.  
The manufacture consists in four conjugation steps, allylation, amination of the allyl conjugate, DPTA 
conjugation and mannose conjugation. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, assay (HPLC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph 
Eur), impurities (HPLC), heavy metals, identification (FT-IR, 1H-NMR), residual solvents, total aerobic 
microbial count (Ph Eur), total combined yeasts  and molds count (Ph Eur), amine number (1H-NMR), 
DTPA Number (UV spectroscopy), mannose number (HPLC), calculated molecular weight and molecular 
mass distribution (GPC).  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data (6 pilot scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in HDPE bottles, which differ from the proposed commercial packaging  for 24 months under long 
term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% 
RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, impurities, water content, total aerobic 
microbial count, total combined yeasts and moulds, and molecular mass distribution. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development  
Lymphoseek is presented as a lyophilised solid to be reconstituted with Sodium Pertechnetate 99mTc 
Injection to provide a solution of 99mTc-Lymposeek for intradermal, subcutaneous, and epilesional use.  
The formulation contains excipients (reducing agent, transchelating, bulking, antioxidant and 
pH-adjusting agents) necessary for the radiolabelling of the product in the radiopharmacy.  
The active substance is a powder that is moderately hygroscopic and very water soluble. Evidence of good 
physico-chemical stability in aqueous solution is provided. The molecule size allows for rapid clearance 
from the injection site and for easy passage into capillaries.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
An overview was provided of the development of the formulation through clinical development. Phase I 
studies used a formulation which did not contain trehalose or glycine; upon progression to phase II and 
III trials, the proposed commercial formulation was chosen.  
The starting point for developing the manufacturing process was identifying the critical process 
parameters that should be monitored or controlled. These were identified as control of oxygen content 
throughout the manufacturing process as the minimisation of oxidation is important to minimise oxidation 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014  
Page 12/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the excipients stannous chloride dihydrate and sodium ascorbate and control of the pH during 
compounding. Presence of oxygen was minimised and pH was controlled during development.  
Comprehensive details of the development of the lyophilisation process were presented. These include 
reports of low temperature thermal analysis, lyophilisation cycle refinement and optimisation, a process 
target confirmation study and boundary studies of the process parameters. Stability batches from these 
boundary studies were initiated to confirm the acceptability of the resultant dosage form. 
The chosen sterilisation method was aseptic filtration of the bulk solution since sterility assurance cannot 
be applied to a dry blend of powders and terminal sterilisation is not possible due to instability of the 
excipient stannous chloride dihydrate in aqueous solution.   
The differences in the manufacturing process between clinical, stability and proposed commercial batches 
were presented.  These are minor, with increased control for the commercial batches.  The differences 
would not be considered to lead to differences in the quality of the product and are satisfactory. 
The development of the container closure system was described adequately and reflected the validated 
vial type/size at the various sites used in the development of the product.  The material (glass and butyl 
rubber stopper) remained the same throughout the development.  Stability results indicated the 
compatibility of the product with the primary packaging. Leachables studies were described, from which 
it was concluded that in consideration of the intended low dose and the extremely low levels of leachables, 
these are not required to be monitored in routine release or stability testing.  
Container closure integrity was examined using a microbial ingress test and a dye ingress test.  The 
applicant carried out dye ingress testing on all stability batches in addition to sterility testing, with the aim 
to eventually use integrity testing in lieu of sterility testing.  All microbial ingress and dye ingress results 
indicated the satisfactory integrity of the proposed container closure system.  Residual moisture in the 
proposed stoppers was determined and considered sufficiently low as to be acceptable. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls  
The manufacturing process and controls are conventional for an aseptically filled and lyophilized 
pharmaceutical product. The manufacturing process consists of nine main processes: pre-compounding, 
compounding, transfer, filtration and filling, lyophilization process, capping and vial washing, and 
inspection. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form:  
appearance (container/closure, lyophilized product, and reconstituted solution), reconstitution time, 
solution pH, residual moisture, osmolality, assay (HPLC-CAD), identification (HPLC-CAD), uniformity of 
dosage units (Ph Eur), free DTPA (HPLC-DAD), stannous chloride dihydrate content (differential 
polarography), sodium ascorbate content (HPLC-DAD), sterility (Ph Eur), bacterial endotoxins ( Ph Eur) 
and particulate matter (Ph Eur). 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. The finished 
product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional final 
product release testing

Stability of the product 
Stability data is provided in three  primary, two process qualification/characterization, and three  process 
validation stability batches stored under long-term conditions of 25°C / 60% RH for up 36 months and 
under accelerated conditions of 40°C /75% RH for up 6 months. The batches are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance (container/closure, lyophilized product, reconstituted solution), 
reconstitution time, pH, residual moisture, osmolality, potency, radiochemical purity, stannous chloride 
dihydrate content, L-ascorbic acid content, sterility, bacterial endotoxins and particulates. 
In-use stability was conducted to determine the shelf-life of reconstituted product as determined by HPLC 
and ITLC data. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance

NZW rabbits. Cardiovascular safety system studies were conducted in the beagle dog.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Three in vitro PD studies (NEO3-08, NEO3-08A, and NEO3-10) have been performed.

(rhMBR) 
In  vitro  Binding  Study  of  Tilmanocept  with  Low  and  High  Mannose 
Conjugation;  Binding  to  Human  Macrophage  Mannose  Binding  Receptor  
Proteins 
The in vitro study (NEO3-08), with living human macrophages, determined a threshold performance 
concentration of approximately 1.5 µM for initial injection for clinical applications.   
The in vitro study (NEO3-08A) showed that Lymphoseek bound with human Mannose Binding Receptor 
(hMBR) on monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) cells as determined by Western blot and 
autoradiography; and no non-specific binding was observed. In addition, Lymphoseek binding was 
evident in recombinant hMBR (rhMBR) transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) but not in the 
empty vector-transfected HEK 293 cells. Lymphoseek binding was also shown to be competitively 
inhibited by pre-incubation with unlabelled Lymphoseek. This provided strong evidence that Lymphoseek 
selectively binds to its intended receptor target, hMBR. 
A second in vitro study (NEO3-10) was conducted to evaluate the effect of varying the number of 
mannose moieties per molecule of tilmanocept drug substance on in-vitro binding to human macrophage 
hMBRs using a competitive binding paradigm.  Binding efficacy was evaluated for tilmanocept batches 
containing 7.4, 13.6, and 19.1 mannose moieties/dextran and in a reference standard containing 17.2 
mannose moieties/dextran.  Relative to these batches, binding efficacy was significantly reduced in the 
tilmanocept batch containing 7.4 mannose moieties/dextran, which is well below the lower boundary of 
the manufacturing specification range of 12 mannose moieties.  From these data, a threshold value for 
reduced binding performance was estimated at 11.7 mannose moieties per dextran.  In in vitro studies, 
technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept exhibited specific and tight binding to human CD206 receptors with a 
primary binding site affinity of Kd = 2.76 x x 10-11 M.

In Vivo Tissue Distribution of [99Tc]-Lymphoseek in Rabbits (WIL 608002) 
Tissue distribution of Tc 99m Lymphoseek was evaluated in New Zealand White rabbits administered a 
dose of approximately 1.4 μg/kg (5 μg/rabbit) and approximately 140 μCi [5.2 MBq] as a single SC 
injection into the distal portion of the left thigh. Animals were euthanized, and blood, urine, and tissue 
samples were collected at 0.25, 1, and 3 hours after dose administration. At 15 minutes and 1 hour after 
dose administration, approximately 1% of the injected dose of the Tc 99m Lymphoseek equivalents was 
found in ipsilateral popliteal lymph node, indicating rapid absorption in local lymph node tissue, while 
none was detected in contralateral popliteal lymph node. At 3 hours postdose, Tc 99m Lymphoseek 
equivalents had declined from levels found at the 1 hour time point in blood and all tissues with the 
exception of kidneys, bladder contents, and colon contents, demonstrating ongoing systemic clearance. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No studies evaluating secondary pharmacodynamics were submitted.

Pilot  Pharmacokinetic  Study  of  111Indium-Lymphoseek  in  a  Mongrel  Dog  (Study  Batelle 
N106921) 
This non-GLP pilot study was performed in a single animal. Administration was by single SC injection of 
52.5 μg/kg and approximately 1 mCi [37 MBq] of radioactivity in a volume of 1.0 mL/kg.  Cmax was 18.47 
ng/mL and was observed at 1 hour (tmax), AUClast was 118.28 hr·ng/mL, and apparent clearance (CL/F) 
was 326.49 mL/hr/kg.  
14-Day  Toxicity  Study  of  111Indium-Lymphoseek  in  Sprague-Dawley  Rats  (Study  Battelle 
N106923) 
Study Battelle N106923 was conducted to determine the toxicity of tilmanocept (drug substance) when 
administered via SC injection to Sprague Dawley rats for 14 consecutive days. For the TK groups, 23 
animals/sex/group were administered 0, 10.5, 21, or 42 µg /kg. At day 1 and 14, 111Indium-tilmanocept 
was administered, and at day 2-13 unlabelled drug was used.  
An overall mean (± SEM, n=12) absorption half-life value of 0.067 ± 0.01 hours (approximately 4 
minutes) was determined. Observed t max values were in close agreement with the fitted values, and there 
was no apparent dose- or sex-related effect. The group mean fitted tmax ranged approximately 7 to 18 
minutes.  The Cmax and AUClast results suggest that doses ranging from 10.5 μg/kg (low dose) to 21 
μg/kg (mid dose) to 42 μg/kg (high dose) are in a dose-proportional range for the rat, and repeated 
administration did not appear to have inhibitory or inductive effect. The Vd/F was not dependent on sex 
or single vs. repeated administration. The overall Vd/F was 1160 ± 50 mL/kg.

Elimination was not dependent on the dose, sex, or single vs. repeated administrations so was not 
considered saturable. Alpha phase (fast) elimination was well defined for all groups; the overall alpha  
half-life was 0.540 ± 0.035 hours. The overall beta (slow elimination) half-life (excluding curves with 
ill-defined terminal linear phases) was 53.8 ± 11.3 hours. The overall central compartment elimination 
half-life was 3.10 ± 0.70 hours.

14-Day Toxicity Study of 111Indium-Lymphoseek in Mongrel Dogs (Study Battelle N106922) 
Study Battelle N106922 was conducted to determine the toxicity of tilmanocept (drug substance) when 
administered via SC injection to Sprague Dawley rats for 14 consecutive days. Doses administered were 
0, 10.5, 21 and 42 µg /kg/day. Animals were administered 111Indium-tilmanocept on day 1 and 14. 
Blood samples were collected before dosing, 10, 20 and 30 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 
hours after dosing. Urine was collected at 0 to 2, 2 to 6, 6 to 12, 12 to 24, and 24 to 48 hours. 
The overall absorption half-life value was approximately 23 minutes. The group mean fitted tmax ranged 
from approximately 28 to 66 minutes. 
 Cmax and AUClast were dose and single vs. repeated dose-dependent, but not sex dependent and 
increased proportionally with increasing dose. These findings indicate that doses ranging from 10.5 to 21 
μg/kg are in a dose proportional range for the dog.

The Vd/F was not dependent on sex or single vs. repeated administration. The overall Vd/F was 887 ± 62 
mL/kg. 
Elimination was not dependent on the dose, sex, or single vs. repeated administrations. Elimination was 
evaluated using the alpha (fast), beta (slow), and central compartment elimination rate constants and 
half-lives (Table 6). The alpha phase was well defined for all groups; the overall alpha half-life was 1.32 
± 0.04 hours. The overall beta half-life (excluding curves with plateau-like terminal linear phases) was 
87.6 ± 14.9 hours. The overall central compartment elimination half-life was 6.54 ± 0.89 hours.  
The overall CL/F was 116 ± 13 mL/hr/kg. Peak equivalent concentrations of [In-111]-tilmanocept in the 
urine were observed for most male and female groups on Days 1 and 14 during the 2 to 6 hour collection 
interval. Of the total amount of [In 111]-tilmanocept equivalents eliminated by the kidneys, 
approximately 90% or more was measured in the urine within 24 hours after dosing on Day 1 and within 
12 hours after dosing on Day 14.  The group mean percentage of dose excreted in the urine ranged from 
26.5% to 43.0%, and the overall mean from all groups was 35.0% ± 1.6%.

Tissue Distribution of [99mTC] Lymphoseek in Rabbits (WIL 608002) 
TC 99m Lymphoseek in PBS was administered in 11 rabbits (7F/4M) by a single bolus SC injection in the 
distal portion of the thigh. A single 1.4 µg /kg dose (5 μg/animal) was administered with a resulting 
radioactive dose of approximately 140 μCi/animal (the actual dose ranged from 131 to 145 μCi [4.8 to 5.4 
MBq]). Blood, urine, and tissue samples were collected at 0.25, 1, and 3 hours postdose.

In females, TC 99m Lymphoseek equivalents were widely distributed by 0.25 hours postdose, with 
highest doses in plasma (7.7%ID), urinary bladder contents (7.7%ID) and injection site skin (6.5%ID). 
No analysis was performed in males at this time point. At 1 hour postdose TC 99m Lymphoseek 
equivalents increased substantially at the injection site in females (33.6%ID) and males (24.1%ID) 
relative to values in females at 0.25 hours postdose. Urinary contents (14.62 and 8.07 %ID in males and 
females), kidneys (5.86 and 6.67%ID in males and females), and liver (5.28 and 6.66 %ID in male and 
females) amounts all increased relative to values in females at the 0.25 hour time point, whereas plasma 
levels appeared to decline. By 3 hours postdose, the highest fraction of dose was present in the urinary 
bladder contents (34.7%ID in males, 27.4%ID in females). This, in conjunction with moderately elevated 
levels in the kidneys, indicates urinary excretion is an important route of elimination of Tc 99m 
Lymphoseek. %ID also increased in gastrointestinal tract, but accounted for <3%ID at any of the time 
points evaluated. Liver values were highest at approximately 6%ID at the 1 hour time point and 
decreased to approximately 4%ID at 3 hours after dosing. Approximately 1%ID was found in the draining 
left popliteal lymph node at each time point evaluated, while little to none was found in the right popliteal 
lymph node or in either left or right axillary lymph nodes at any time point.

In a published tissue biodistribution study of [99mTc]DTPA-mannosyl-dextran in New Zealand White 
rabbits, similar distribution profiles were observed. Following injection to the right rear paw, 1-2% of 
injected dose was found in the right popliteal lymph node at 15 min, 1 h, and 3h postdose. 
Metabolism 
No specific metabolism studies were submitted. The applicant provided the following description of the 
theoretical metabolism of tilmanocept.

Dextran Core: Dextrans are polysaccharides composed of linear glucose residues. They are produced by 
the enzyme dextran sucrase during growth of various strains of Leuconostoc bacteria in media containing 
sucrose.  Dextrans  are  isotonic  and  can  be  stored  at  room  temperature.  Dextran  is  broken  down 
completely to CO 2 and H2O by dextranase present in spleen, liver, lung, kidney, brain, and muscle at a 
rate approaching 70 mg/kg every 24 hr. 
DTPA: DTPA has been in clinical use for nearly 55 years. Its biodistribution and metabolic fate have been 
extensively studied. It is currently used as an imaging agent with 99mTc with a Sn2+ reducing agent, 
exactly like the Lymphoseek radionuclide labelling system. 
Mannose:  The  metabolic  fate  of  mannose  is  well  established.  No  known  untoward  metabolites  are 
established  as  “toxic”  from  mannose  metabolism.  Mannose  is  a  well-established  molecular  species  in 
blood and interstitial fluid (0.55 mM). Mannose is the functional targeting moiety of Lymphoseek (to the 
mannose  binding  receptor  [MBR;  CD206]  of  the  reticuloendothelial  cells  in  the  lymph  nodes).  Its 
metabolic fate is estimated to be similar to other mannose ligands. 
Thioether leashes: The thioether leashes that extend to hold mannose and DTPA as well as free leashes 
are readily metabolized as other such molecular entities, via the cytochrome P450 pathway. The primary 
modulators of this degradation are CYP1A2, 3A4, 2B6, 2C9*1, 2C18, 2C19, 2D6*1, and FMO1; disulfoton, 
CYP1A2, 3A4, 2B6, 2C9*1, 2C9*2, 2C18, 2C19, 2D6*1, and FMO1; sulprofos, CYP1A1, 1A2, 3A4, 2C9*1, 
2C9*2,  2C9*3,  2C18,  2C19,  2D6*1,  and  FMO1;  methiocarb,  CYP1A1,  1A2,  3A4,  2B6,  2C9*1,  2C19, 
2D6*1, and the flavin mono-oxygenases. 
Excretion 
Specific  excretion  studies  were  not  conducted  in  separate  studies.  Excretion  data  are  available  in 
nonclinical toxicity studies N106923 (Rats) and N106922 (dogs). 
In the dog study, the overall central compartment elimination half-life was 6.54 ± 0.89 hours. The 
apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) did not appear to be dependent on sex or single vs. repeated 
administration. Peak [In 111]-tilmanocept concentrations in the urine were observed for most male and 
female groups on Days 1 and 14 during the 2 to 6 hour collection interval. Of the total amount of [In 
111]-tilmanocept equivalents eliminated by the kidneys,  approximately 90% or more was measured in 
the urine within 24 hours after dosing on Day 1 and within 12 hours after dosing on Day 14. The overall 
percentage of dose excreted in the urine was 35.0% ± 1.6% in this dog study. 
In the rat study, the overall central compartment elimination half-life was 3.10 ± 0.70 hours. The analysis 
of urine samples,  obtained from the satellite group animals before dosing on Day 1 and Day 14, and after 
dosing at the pre-specified time points, indicated that elimination of [In 111]-tilmanocept equivalents in 
urine was also independent of dose, sex, or single vs. repeated administrations.  This result suggests that 
elimination  over  repeated  doses  of  [In  111]-tilmanocept  remained  first  order  and  that  no  saturation 
occurred. The overall mean percentage of dose excreted in the urine was 29.1% ± 1.8% in rats. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The proposed human dose is 50 μg Tc 99m Lymphoseek per procedure, equivalent to 0.714 μg/kg if an 
estimate of 70 kg is used for human body weight. The administration of 14 to 280 μg/kg in single dose 
animal studies is equivalent to approximately 20 to 390 times that for the anticipated human dose. 
Administration of 10.5 to 42 μg/kg/day in repeated dose animal studies represent approximately 15 and 
60 times the anticipated human dose.

Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicity of tilmanocept drug substance was determined when administered via SC injection to groups 
of 10 Spague Dawley rats/sex/group (toxicity) or 23 rats/sex/group (pharmacokinetics) for 14 
consecutive days at 0 (vehicle), 10.5, 21 and 42 µg/kg/dose. Blood and urine samples were also collected 
following the first and last doses to establish a toxicokinetic (TK) profile, using indium-111-radiolabeled 
tilmanocept ([In 111]- tilmanocept).  
There were no treatment related deaths. There were no treatment related overt signs of toxicity or 
changes in body weight, food consumption, ophthalmologic findings, or physical findings. There were also 
no treatment related changes in clinical pathology parameters, urinalysis values, organ weights, or 
macroscopic or microscopic findings. 
Based on no treatment-related effects being observed in any dose group, the  NOEL for 14 consecutive 
days of tilmanocept SC administration in rats was considered to be ≥ 42 μg/kg/day.

14-Day Study of 111Indium-Lymphoseek in Mongrel Dogs (Study N106922) 
The toxicity of tilmanocept drug substance was determined when administered via SC injection to groups 
of 12/sex mongrel dogs for 14 consecutive days at dose levels of 0 (vehicle), 0.0105, 0.021, 0.042 
mg/kg/dose. Blood and urine samples were also collected on Day 1 and Day 14 to establish a TK profile 
using [In
]-labeled tilmanocept.  
111
Following at least 15 consecutive doses of tilmanocept, there were no treatment related clinical 
abnormalities or body weight, food consumption, ophthalmologic, or physical changes. There were no 
effects on heart rates,  electrocardiograms, or interval data. There were also no treatment related 
changes in clinical pathology parameters, urinalysis values, organ weights, or macroscopic or microscopic 
changes.  
Based on no treatment-related effects being observed in any dose group, the NOAEL for at least 15 
consecutive days of tilmanocept SC administration in dogs was considered to be ≥ 42 μg/kg/day.

Reproduction Toxicity 
No studies on reproduction toxicity were submitted. 
Local Tolerance  
The potential for local irritation from a single intramuscular (thigh) injection was evaluated in two single 
dose GLP studies in rabbits using either tilmanocept drug substance, or unlabeled Lymphoseek drug 
product. No treatment-related effects were observed with tilmanocept. Using unlabeled Lymphoseek, 
mild inflammation and tissue degeneration were seen in one rabbit in the high dose (280 μg/kg) group. 
No other treatment-related observations were noted.  
In the previously reported single subcutaneous dose toxicity study in mongrel dogs with tilmanocept, 
minimal to mild inflammation was observed at the injection site in some dogs at all doses with mild to 
moderate inflammation of the subcutis and skeletal muscle vacuolar degeneration.  
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
An antigenicity study was performed in 50 male guinea pigs to determine the potential of tilmanocept to 
induce Type 1 systemic hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reactions). Animals were given a single 
intravenous challenge dose following four weekly subcutaneous sensitization doses. Treatment with 
tilmanocept at doses of 14.0, 28.0, or 280 μg/kg did not induce any anaphylactic reactions and had no 
effect on mortality, clinical observations, or changes in body weights. All animals survived until 
scheduled termination. 
Immunotoxicity 
No immunotoxicity studies were submitted. 
Metabolites 
No studies on metabolites were submitted. 
Studies on impurities 
No studies on impurities were submitted. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The LogKow of Lymphoseek is expected to be << 3.0. Experimental data for Lymphoseek are not 
available, and the logKow values of the DTPA unit, mannose and the dextran-10 unit were estimated 
using the EPI SuiteTM KOWWINTM model (US EPA, 2007). An experimental value of the logKow of 
mannose was available in the model (-3.24). The dextran-10 unit is the backbone that is constructed of 
several sugar units. The logKow for such backbone consisting of 4 sugar units was calculated to be -7.53, 
demonstrating that the logKow value of a polymer of mannose-entities will not be higher than that of the 
individual entities. Finally, the logKow of the DTPA unit was estimated to be -4.9. Therefore, a PBT 
assessment is not needed for Lymphoseek.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In in vitro studies, technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept exhibited specific and tight binding to human CD206 
receptors with a primary binding site affinity of Kd = 2.76 x 10-11 M.  Plasma pharmacokinetic results from 
the 14 day repeated dose toxicity studies with [In 111]-tilmanocept demonstrated rapid absorption into 
the circulating blood in both rats and dogs (absorption half-life approximately 4 and 23 minutes, 
respectively). Observed Cmax values, ranging from 10.3 to 28.6 ng/mL for rats and 6.8 to 42.8 ng/mL for 
dogs, were in good agreement with the fitted Cmax values, increased proportionately with increasing 
dose, and were similar for males and females. Fitted tmax values ranged from approximately 7 to 18 
minutes for rats and 28 to 66 minutes for dogs, again indicating rapid absorption. The AUC1ast values were 
also similar for both sexes at a given dose group and increased proportionately with increasing dose in 
both rats and dogs. 
Tilmanocept binds specifically to mannose binding receptors, and therefore off-target interactions are not 
expected. The absence of secondary pharmacodynamic studies is acceptable.

No specific metabolism studies were conducted to assess metabolite formation following administration of 
tilmanocept. The metabolism of the constituents of Lymphoseek has been described by the applicant. 
Lymphoseek localised to the kidneys, bladder and liver, which supports the predicted biliary/faecal route. 
In the absence of significant findings, particularly renal or hepatic findings, in the repeat dose studies, the 
absence of comprehensive studies on metabolism and excretion are not considered to pose a safety 
concern. ICH guidance M3(R2) titled “Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials 
and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (2010)”, states that nonclinical characterization of a 
human metabolite(s) is only warranted when that metabolite(s) is observed at exposures greater than 10 
percent of total drug-related exposure and at significantly greater level in humans than the maximum 
exposure seen in the toxicity studies.” As lymphoseek is intended to be administered as a single 50 μg 
dose, it is accepted that given the low dose and frequency of dosing, it is not necessary to quantify all 
circulating metabolites to the 10 percent level. 
Urinary excretion was a major route of elimination in all three studies. In the repeated dose studies in rats 
and dogs, the overall percentage of dose excreted in the urine (across dose groups) was 29.1% for rats 
and 35.0% for dogs. Peak excretion generally occurred during the 0 to 2 or 2 to 6 hour post-dose 
collection periods, and > 90% of the dose excreted by the kidneys was collected by 6 to 24 hours after 
dosing. Analyses of urine samples after repeated dosing indicated that elimination of radiolabeled 
tilmanocept in urine was also independent of dose, sex, or single vs. repeated administrations.  
All the studies with a pharmacokinetic component were conducted using only one proposed route of 
administration i.e. the subcutaneous route. There are four proposed clinical routes of injection: 
intradermal, subcutaneous, intratumoural and peritumoural. However, the subcutaneous route of 
administration is the most practical route of administration and provides sufficient data for the purpose of 
non-clinical studies. 
In the two single toxicities studies, a single subcutaneous dose of tilmanocept or unlabeled Lymphoseek 
up to a nominal tilmanocept dose of 140 μg/kg (42 μg/rat) was generally well tolerated. No significant 
overt signs of toxicity, no treatment related necropsy findings, and no evidence of macroscopic or 
microscopic histopathological changes were observed with the exception of slight lymphoid hyperplasia of 
the inguinal lymph node in one study. However, given that no such evidence has been raised in the clinical 
safety database of over 500 patients, this finding does not lead to any concern and further animal studies 
are not considered necessary. 
In NZW rabbits a single subcutaneous dose of tilmanocept was well tolerated at all dose levels examined 
up to 140 μg/kg. There was no evidence of any treatment-related effect on mortality, overt signs of 
toxicity, body weight, gross pathology, or necropsy findings. Minimal to mild hepatocyte centrilobular 
hypertrophy was noted in treated rabbits and one control rabbit. In a study conducted in guinea pigs. 
tilmanocept was found not to have antigenic potential. 
In a single subcutaneous dose toxicity study in mongrel dogs with tilmanocept, minimal to mild 
inflammation was observed at the injection site in some dogs at all doses with mild to moderate 
inflammation of the subcutis and skeletal muscle vacuolar degeneration. The inflammatory reaction was 
attributed a host response to foreign material, rather than a direct toxic effect of the drug. This reaction 
was not seen after subcutaneous injection in the other toxicity studies. No significant effects were 
observed on mortality, overt signs of toxicity, body weight, food consumption, clinical pathology, gross 
pathology, organ weights, organ-to-body weight ratio or histopathology. 
In the in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation assay, the results of the 24-hour assay without metabolic 
activation were ambiguous. However, the total daily dose of the product is low, administered only on one 
occasion or very infrequently. Therefore, according to the draft ICH M7 guideline, it is expected to be 
below the limit of toxicological concern.

No CNS and respiratory safety studies were submitted. Based on metabolic body weight the expected 
accrual in 7.11 ng and ~92.43 ng in the brain and lungs, respectively, which is sufficiently low that no risk 
is posed to patients. In animals studies at supratherapeutic doses there were no observed respiratory or 
behavioural changes, or histopathological changes associated with these systems. In the lack of in vivo 
and histopathological findings and no respiratory or CNS signs in over 500 patients, the absence of CNS 
and respiratory studies is acceptable. 
No carcinogenicity studies were submitted. ICH guidance S1A indicates that pharmaceuticals 
administered infrequently or for short duration of exposure do not require assessment of carcinogenicity 
unless there is cause for concern. Lymphoseek is intended for single administration. Therefore, the lack of 
carcinogenicity studies is acceptable. 
As the product is indicated for adults aged 18 years and older, the lack of studies in juvenile animals is 
acceptable. 
No reproductive or developmental toxicity studies were submitted. Given the high specificity and rapid 
clearance, the absence of pathologic changes in reproductive organs in repeated dose toxicity studies, 
and  the  minimal  duration  of  patient  exposure,  the  lack  of  studies  on  the  toxicity  to  reproduction  is 
acceptable. However, the toxicity of the product when used during pregnancy and lactation remains of 
concern. This risk has been addressed as part of the RMP.  
In  summary,  non-clinical  data  reveal  no  special  hazard  for  humans  based  on  conventional  studies  of 
safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the non-clinical studies submitted for the marketing authorisation application for 
tilmanocept were considered adequate and acceptable for the assessment of non-clinical aspects for the 
product tilmanocept. The lack of carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies was 
justified and considered acceptable. The PECSURFACEWATER (0.00025 μg/L) is below the action limit of 0.01 
μg/L, and no other environmental concerns are apparent. Therefore, it is concluded that the product is 
unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical pharmacology database consisted of three Phase 1 studies (NEO3-A, NEO3-B, and NEO3-C) 
and one Phase 2 study (NEO3-01).  Clinical pharmacology parameters were not assessed in the Phase 3 
studies.  
The pivotal phase 3 studies were NEO3-05 and NEO3-09 in melanoma and breast cancer patients, and 
NEO3-06 in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: diagnostic radiopharmaceutical, tumour detection, ATC Code: V09IA09.

The PK of Lymphoseek was assessed by examining the injection site clearance rate constant (kc), the 
injection site clearance half-life (Tc), the percent-of-injected dose in the sentinel node (%IDSN), and the 
absolute sentinel node uptake for Lymphoseek (LSN).

The  studies  NEO3-A  and  NEO3-B  evaluated  the  radiopharmacokinetics  of  Tc-99m  DTPA  mannosyl 
dextran (Lymphoseek) against a known sentinel node imaging agent- filtered sulphur colloid (fTcSC). The 
methodologies of the studies were similar. The eligible patients were randomised into 2 groups, Groups 1 
and 2, evaluated/ imaged with fTcSC and 1.0 nmol Lymphoseek, respectively. Subsequently, further 2 
groups were sequentially assigned in both studies to evaluate an additional 2 doses of Lymphoseek.  
Radiopharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in the tables below.

In study NEO3-A, Lymphoseek was studied at three doses (0.2, 1.0, and 5.0 nmol; 500 µCi each), and all 
three doses were cleared from the injection site faster than fTcSC (500 µCi).  Similar results were also 
observed with the three doses studied (1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 nmol; 500 µCi each) in study NEO3-B.

While the absolute uptake of Lymphoseek into the primary sentinel lymph node was dose-dependent, the 
percentage of dose reaching the primary sentinel node appeared to be independent of dose.  
The  1.0 nmol  Lymphoseek  dose,  in  study  NEO3-A,  resulted  in  comparable  distribution  to  the  primary 
sentinel node with fTcSC treatment. 
The  study  NEO3-C  was  conducted  to  optimize  the  imaging  protocol  and  obtain  preliminary  efficacy 
information,  including  injection  site  retention  and  sentinel  node  localization  at  3  and  16  hours 
post-administration; to provide an assessment of the clearance kinetics of the radiotracer, Lymphoseek; 
and to quantify its imaging and detection properties relative to Tc-99 sulphur colloid. 
Lymphoseek was eliminated from the injection site significantly faster than Tc-SC: the mean elimination 
half-life was 2.6 hours for Lymphoseek compared with 27 hours for Tc-SC.

The injection site clearance rates were similar for all doses of Lymphoseek, and all doses of Lymphoseek 
were cleared significantly faster from the injection site than the comparator, technetium 99m sulphur 
colloid. 
The mean Lymphoseek injection site clearance half-life was approximately 2 to 3 hours vs. approximately 
15 to 27 hours for TcSC. Although the patient populations in the studies were different (two studies in 
women with breast cancer and one study in men and women with melanoma), injection site clearance 
rates were similar for all doses of Lymphoseek. 
Lymph Node Uptake 
Lymph node uptake was examined in three Phase 1 studies. After a single PT, ID, or SC dose, Lymphoseek 
readily dispersed and localised. L SN was dose-related for Lymphoseek (ranging from 0.09 pmol at the 0.2 
nmol dose to 58.2 pmol at the 10.0 nmol dose). Lymphoseek relative uptake (%IDSN) was generally 
independent of dose and ranged from 0.05%IDSN to 1.81%IDSN, while the TcSC values ranged from 
0.64%IDSN to 3.66%. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation/ Estimated radiation exposure 
The radiation doses estimated or measured in patients on the pivotal clinical studies are listed in the 
tables below. 
The radiation absorbed dose values for breast cancer patients in NEO3-A are shown in the Table 18. The 
effective dose equivalent (EDE) is 1.60x10-2 mSv/MBq for males and 1.79x10-2 mSv/MBq for females.  A 
18.5 MBq (0.5 mCi) dose of Lymphoseek would yield a radiation exposure of 296 to 330 μSv.  For patients 
with breast cancer, tissues with the highest estimated radiation absorbed dose at the 18.5 MBq activity 
are injection site (1.659 milligray [mGy]), ovary (0.187 mGy), and kidney (0.186 mGy).

The radiation absorbed dose values for melanoma patients (NEO3-B) are shown in the Table 19.  The EDE 
is 1.09x10-2 mSv/MBq for males and 1.36x10-2 mSv/MBq for females.  A 18.5 MBq (0.5 mCi) dose of 
Lymphoseek would yield a radiation exposure of 202 to 251 μSv.  For patients with melanoma, tissues 
with the  highest estimated radiation absorbed dose at the 18.5 MBq activity are injection site (0.790 
mGy), ovary (0.299 mGy), and kidney (0.278 mGy).

a  Due to the differences in injection sites among melanoma patients, the injection site was assumed to 
be the breast for the purposes of this calculation, as it represents the nearest anatomical construct for 
the skin from the anatomical sites appropriately included in the estimates.

Elimination 
Upon  entry  into  the  blood,  the  agent  binds  to  receptors  in  the  liver  or  is  filtered  by  the  kidney  and 
accumulates in the urinary bladder. The amount of the accumulated radioactive dose in the liver, kidney, 
and bladder reached a maximum 1 hour post administration of Lymphoseek and was approximately 1%

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Phase 2 clinical study, NEO3-01 
In  this  study,  the  PD  properties  of  Lymphoseek  were  assessed  in  patients  with  melanoma  or  breast 
cancer.  The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  determine  preoperative  and  intra-operative 
lymphoscintigraphic localisation of lymph node(s) in the lymphatic pathways draining the primary site of 
melanoma or breast cancer using Lymphoseek as a radiotracer. 
Each patient received 50 μg Lymphoseek, with a recommended activity of 11 to 185 MBq (0.3 to 5.0 mCi). 
Injections were made ID or SC in close proximity to the primary tumour. 
Preoperative evaluations followed normal practice and could include lymphoscintigraphy. ILM could occur 
between  15  minutes  and  30  hours  post-injection,  depending  on  surgical  schedule.  VBD  injection  at 
surgery was allowed as an adjunct lymphatic mapping agent, but not required by the protocol. 
Intraoperatively, based on the investigator’s intraoperative assessment, Lymphoseek localised at least 
one tissue sample in 75 of the 78 per protocol patients (96.2%), and the localisation rate was similar 
between the two tumour types (97.9% of patients with melanoma and 93.5% of patients with breast 
cancer). On a per tissue basis, of the 180 specimens identified in vivo, 171 (95.0%) were identified by 
Lymphoseek and all 171 tissues were subsequently determined to be lymphoid tissue in pathology.  
The effect of time between Lymphoseek injection and surgery on the localisation rate was also evaluated. 
In  patients  with  melanoma,  the  time  interval  made  no  difference  in  the  localisation  rate  (97.5%  for 
same-day  vs.  100%  for  next-day  surgery).  However,  in  patients  with  breast  cancer,  the  same  day 
surgery  group  had  a  95.5%  localisation  rate  compared  with  88.9%  in  the  next-day  surgery  group. 
However this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.5032, Fisher’s exact test).

Injection Volume Effects (NEO3-05) 
The main source of the non-concordance in study NEO3-05 was the deviation from the volume of injection 
by  2  study  sites  (05  and  06).  The  results  for  this  study  have  been  for  these  sites  alone,  for  all  sites 
together,  and  with  the  exclusion  of  these  2  sites.  Following  the  observation  that  injection  volume 
deviations  affected  the  concordance  rates,  and  non-clinical  study  NEO3-08  was  initiated to  study  this 
effect.  
Table 23: 
Condordance rates for blue dye and Lymphoseek by study sites 
The in vitro study NE03-08 with human MDMs was conducted to evaluate injection volume effects on the 
behaviour  and  specificity  of  the  binding  of  Lymphoseek  to  the  hMBR,  and  was  precipitated  by  the 
observed discordance in the Phase 3 study NEO3-05 between results from Lymphoseek and the clinical 
standard,  VBD  in  breast  cancer  and  melanoma  patients.  A  break-point  performance  concentration  of 
approximately  1.5  μM  for  initial  injection  was  determined  for  clinical  applications.  Volume  excursion 
(excessive injection volumes of greater than 4 mL of Lymphoseek, per se) may significantly alter 0.5 
Vmax, thus potentially affecting the expected binding performance in patients.                                
The  results  of  this  study  confirmed  Lymphoseek’s  specific  binding  interaction  with  the  hMBR  and 
supported injection volume excursion as the root cause of discordance in the performance of Lymphoseek 
at two clinical sites in the NEO3-05 study. On the basis of this study, preferred clinical single injection 
volumes for Lymphoseek were set to 0.1 to 0.5 mL, with total injection volume limits set at 0.1 to 1.0 mL.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The radiopharmacokinetic parameters for Lymphoseek were evaluated in three Phase 1 studies. The 
patient populations in the studies were different two studies in women with breast cancer, men and 
women with melanoma in the third. The injection site clearance rates were similar for all doses of 
Lymphoseek, and all doses of Lymphoseek were cleared significantly faster from the injection site than 
the comparator, TcSC (mean clearance half-life, 1.75 to 3.05 hours for Lymphoseek vs. 14.7 to 
27.1 hours for TcSC). 
In one Phase 1 study in breast cancer patients, Lymphoseek at all three doses tested (4, 20, and 100 
micrograms) exhibited fast injection site clearance (elimination rate constants in the range of 0.222/h to 
0.278/h).  Uptake of technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept into the primary sentinel node increased dose 
dependently (p=0.009): Lymphoseek injection at 4, 20, and 100 micrograms produced primary sentinel 
node levels (LSN) of 0.09 ± 0.20 pmol, 6.53 ± 2.52 pmol, and 10.58 ± 8.43 pmol of technetium Tc 99m 
tilmanocept, respectively.  The percent-of-injected dose reaching the primary sentinel node (%IDSN) was 
0.05% ± 0.10%, 0.52% ± 0.38%, 0.21% ± 0.17% in the 4, 20, and 100 microgram Lymphoseek dose 
groups, respectively.  The plasma %ID per gram for two dose levels peaked at 4 hours; the mean values 
for the 4 and 100 microgram doses were 0.0090%/g ± 0.0048%/g and 0.0039%/g ± 0.0046%/g, 
respectively. The 20 microgram dose peaked at 2.5 hours with a mean %ID/g of 0.0023%/g ± 
0.0005%/g.  
In the second Phase 1 study in breast cancer patients in which patients were injected with 20 micrograms 
Lymphoseek, the mean elimination rate constant of technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept was 0.299/h and the 
drug half-life at the injection site was 2.6 h.  The %IDSN was 1.68% ± 1.22% in the 3 hour injection to 
surgery group and 1.81% ± 2.19% in the Lymphoseek 16 hour injection to surgery group.   
In the Phase 1 study in melanoma patients, Lymphoseek at all three doses tested (20, 100, and 200 
micrograms) cleared the injection site with elimination rate constants in the range of 0.227/h to 0.396/h, 
resulting in drug half-life at the injection site of 1.75 to 3.05 h).  Uptake of technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept 
into the primary sentinel node increased dose-dependently: Lymphoseek injection at 20, 100, and 200 
micrograms produced LSN values of 5.01 ± 8.02 pmol, 17.5 ± 13.7 pmol, and 58.2 ± 41.2 pmol of 
technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept, respectively. The %IDSN taken up into the primary lymph node was 
0.50% for the 20 microgram dose, 0.35% for the 100 microgram dose, 0.58% for the 200 microgram 
dose of Lymphoseek.  The plasma %ID per gram for two dose levels peaked at 15 minutes; the mean 
values for the 20 and 200 microgram doses were 0.0104%/g ± 0.0135%/g and 0.0065%/g ± 
0.0082%/g, respectively. The 100 microgram dose peaked at 1 and 2 hours with a mean %ID/g of 
0.0018%/g ± 0.001%/g at each timepoint. 
Two of the Phase 1 studies included a range of Lymphoseek drug doses (doses of 0.2, 1.0, and 5.0 nmol 
in NEO3-A and 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 nmol in NEO3-B). In these studies, the lowest dose tested (0.2 nmol; 
NEO3-A) failed to localise lymphatic structures in greater than 60% of patients, indicating that this dose 
would likely be suboptimal. The next higher doses (1.0 and 5.0 nmol) were not significantly different in 
intraoperative imaging performance. L SN (amount of Lymphoseek at a sentinel node) of Lymphoseek was 
dose-dependent in the NEO3-A and NEO3-B studies, with the amount increasing with increasing dose. In 
all three studies, %IDSN of Lymphoseek was generally independent of dose, with mean uptake of 0.5% 
to 1.81% across the four drug doses.  This uptake was numerically lower than that for the TcSC (0.64% 
to 3.66%), though the uptake among treatment groups was not significantly different. Each 250 
microgram vial contains an excess of product.  However, it is recommended that the vial be prepared as 
instructed and a 50 microgram aliquot be used for a single patient dose. Individual injection volumes 
should not exceed 0.5 mL or be less than 0.1 mL.  Total injection volume should be no greater than 1.0 
CHMP assessment report

mL and no less than 0.1 mL.  Dilution of the product in volumes greater than 1.0 mL could affect the in 
vivo disposition of Lymphoseek. For instructions for preparation and control of the radiochemical purity of 
the radiopharmaceutical, see section 12. For patient preparation and dosimetry information, see section 
4.4 and 11 of the SmPC. 
An overall analysis of dose performance predicted that a dose of 50 μg Lymphoseek (~2.7 nmol) would 
provide clinically relevant localisation as well as minimising the overall exposure to Lymphoseek. 
Additionally, the Phase 1 NEO3-C study, using a single Lymphoseek dose of 1.0 nmol, evaluated two 
labelling doses (18.5 MBq [0.5 mCi] and 37 MBq [1.0 mCi]) between same day and next day surgery 
procedures. No significant differences were indicated between Lymphoseek radiolabelling amounts in 
terms of uptake into the sentinel nodes at the 3 hour (18.5 MBq) or 16 hour (37 MBq) post-surgery 
injection times. The recommended minimum time for imaging is 15 minutes post injection. Intraoperative 
lymphatic mapping may begin as early as 15 minutes post injection. Patients scheduled for surgery on the 
day of injection will receive 18.5 MBq technetium Tc 99m labelled product.  Administration should occur 
within 15 hours of the scheduled time of the surgery and intraoperative detection. Patients scheduled for 
surgery on the day after injection will receive 74 MBq technetium Tc 99m labelled product.  Administration 
should occur within 30 hours of the scheduled time of the surgery and intraoperative detection. 
Data for the blood and plasma pharmacokinetics are also limited (up to 6 hours).  There is no elimination 
data from plasma post 6 hours, however it is accepted that the circulating concentrations are very low and 
the radioactive half-life is relatively short. Technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept is eliminated primarily through 
the kidneys. The metabolism of technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept has not been investigated 
experimentally. Tilmanocept may be metabolised in the liver to its component molecules, namely dextran 
(which is renally excreted and/or further metabolised to glucose), mannose (an endogenous sugar) and 
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (which is renally excreted). As with all general metabolites, especially 
those in which the liver plays a measurable roll of elimination, some biliary elimination of technetium Tc 
99m tilmanocept is also likely to occur. 
The %ID for liver, kidneys, and bladder as calculated from the whole body scans of breast cancer patients 
at 1, 2.5, and 12 hours after administration was below 2.6% at all times (all dose levels combined). The 
%ID for liver, kidneys, and bladder as calculated from the whole body scans of melanoma patients at 1 
and 12 hours after administration ranged from 1.1% to 3.1% at 1 hour, and all decreased to less than 1% 
by 12 hours. 
No data on excretion has been provided. However, as the dose is low and given infrequently and the 
radioactive half-life is short, this is accepted.   
The applicant has discussed the metabolic fate based on the three main tilmanocept constituents – 
dextran, mannose and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), all of which are constituents of 
medical products or are themselves medical products approved for other uses or intents. These 
constituents are, within Lymphoseek, bound together and each constituent is known to be metabolised/ 
eliminated in routes as previously established in the assessment of the constituents themselves. Any of 
the main constituents of tilmanocept formed as a result of hepatic metabolism, would be eliminated by 
well recognised routes. Information on elimination has been provided in section 5.2 of the SmPC 
regarding the possible metabolism of Lymphoseek and the clearance of main expected metabolites. 
Extensive dose-range and adjustment studies with the medicinal product in normal and special 
populations have not been performed. The pharmacokinetics of technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept in 
patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been characterised (see section 5.2).There were no 
data collected in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Therefore, caution is advised when dosing in 
these subjects and statements have been introduced in the SmPC in section 4.4 with the following 
CHMP assessment report

wording: Careful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased 
radiation exposure is possible. The estimated radiation dose to the patient would not exceed 0.69 mSv 
even if none of a 74 MBq dose (2.0 mCi) were eliminated (see section 4.2). 
No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies were submitted. However, it is recommended that 
Lymphoseek is not co-injected (mixing) with any other product (e.g., VBD) because of the potential 
influence of what is termed the fluid dynamic effect due to the added volume of the co-injected product. 
It has been determined that adding additional tracing agents or other injectants temporally or 
anatomically proximal to Lymphoseek could alter the performance of Lymphoseek. Therefore, the 
following warning has been included in section 4.5 of the SmPC:  Adding very large volumes of tracing 
agents or other injectants temporally or anatomically proximal to Lymphoseek could affect the in vivo 
disposition of Lymphoseek.  Additional tracing agents should not be injected within 30 minutes of 
Lymphoseek administration.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the clinical pharmacology studies submitted by the applicant were 
adequate. There was some missing information on the metabolism of Lymphoseek. Since Lymphoseek is 
to be administered on very rare occasions at very low doses, the magnitude of the risks are low and pose 
no further concerns. There is also missing information on the use of the medicinal product in hepatic and 
renal impaired patients and information on the importance of hepatic and renal clearance was missing. 
The risks for these patient populations have been addressed with a warning and precaution of use in the 
SmPC.  The CHMP considered that the benefit risk balance was not affected by this missing information 
and all concerns have been adequately addressed in the RMP and SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The localization of Lymphoseek in the primary sentinel node was compared between dosing groups within 
disease (breast cancer in NEO3-A and melanoma in NEO3-B) and for combined data from both diseases.  
Forty-eight patients were included in the combined data analysis: 36 who received Lymphoseek and 12 
who received fTcSC.  Within the group receiving Lymphoseek; 6, 12, 12, and 6 patients, received 0.2, 1.0, 
5.0, and 10.0 nmol doses, respectively. 
There was a significant variation in the absolute amount localized for the Lymphoseek 0.2 nmol dose 
compared with the 5.0 and 10.0 nmol doses. This was due in large part to the lack of localization in four 
of the six patients in the 0.2 nmol dose group.  This non-localization appeared to be related the small dose 
(0.2 nmol) since none of the patients receiving higher doses of Lymphoseek lacked localization.  These 
data indicate that 0.2 nmol is a suboptimal dose for effective localization and use in anatomic delineation 
of lymphatic structures. The differences between other groups in the relative amount of Lymphoseek 
localised were less striking.  The 1.0 and 5.0 nmol doses were not significantly different.  The dose of 1.0 
nmol was considered to be unacceptably proximal to the dose of 0.2 nmol, and it was determined that the 
1.0 nmol dose could create a potentially less robust clinical practice due to increased risk of 
non-localization.  The higher dose of 5.0 nmol provided no significant gains over the 1.0 nmol dose in 
imaging performance.  The dose of 50 µg Lymphoseek (~2.7 nmol) was selected to provide successful 
localization (i.e., reduce the chance of non-localization) while exposing patients to less drug. 
CHMP assessment report

Additionally, the NEO3-C study, using a single Lymphoseek dose of 1.0 nmol, evaluated two Tc-99m 
labelling doses (18.5 MBq [0.5 mCi] and 37 MBq [1.0 mCi]) between same day and next day surgery 
procedures. No significant differences were indicated between Lymphoseek radio-labelling amounts in 
terms of the %IDSN at the 3 hour (18.5 MBq) or 16 hour (37 MBq) post-surgery injection times.

Treatments 
In  this  open-label,  single arm,  within-patient  comparative  study,  all  patients were  to  undergo  ILM  by 
experienced physicians. Prior to surgery, patients received 50 μg Tc 99m Lymphoseek injected in close 
proximity to the primary tumour. The interval between injection and ILM could range from 15 minutes to 
30 hours, depending on surgical scheduling. 
Patients scheduled for surgery on the day of injection received 0.5 mCi Tc 99m Lymphoseek (50 μg) and 
patients scheduled for surgery the next day received 1.0 mCi Tc 99m Lymphoseek (also 50 μg). At or near 
the  time  of  ILM  (prior  to  incision),  VBD  was  injected  in  close  proximity  to  the  tumour.  Preoperative 
evaluation of the patient followed standard clinical practice and could include lymphoscintigraphy. 
Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
All medications taken or administered by the patient for seven days prior to surgery were recorded on the 
source  documents.  All  concomitant  medications  post-surgery  through  Day  30  were  recorded  on  the 
source documents. Documentation included the name of the drug, dose level, frequency, route, reason 
for  use,  and  the  start/stop  dates.  Medications  administered  for  anaesthesia  and  analgesics  related  to 
surgery did not need to be captured in the CRFs. 
Any chemotherapy regimens were prohibited prior to surgery for patients enrolled in this study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was the concordance between Tc 99m Lymphoseek and VBD in the in vivo 
detection of the excised lymph node(s) as confirmed by pathology. 
The secondary objective was the assessment of the resected lymph node(s) to confirm the 
presence/absence of tumour metastases. 
The safety objective was the evaluation of patient safety through observation of adverse events, clinical 
laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of lymph nodes identified intraoperatively by 
localization of VBD (by blue hue) that were also identified intraoperatively by localization of Tc-99m 
Lymphoseek (by 3σ rule). This was a per node concordance measure that used the number of lymph 
nodes stained by VBD as the denominator. Concordance was achieved when a VBD-stained lymph node 
was also detected by Tc-99m Lymphoseek based on the handheld gamma probe count(s) satisfying the 
threshold criterion. Any lymph node count not meeting this threshold criterion was considered a negative 
(i.e., Tc-99m Lymphoseek non-localized) finding. 
The primary safety endpoints were based on the evaluation of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, 
vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
–  The primary concordance rate calculated on a per patient basis. This per patient estimate of 
concordance was the number of patients for whom all VBD-stained lymph nodes were also 
Tc-99m Lymphoseek hot divided by the number of patients in the ITT population. 
–  The reverse concordance rates (based on the reverse intent-to-treat [RITT] population; both 
per node and per patient), where VBD localization was compared against Tc-99m 
Lymphoseek localization, treating Tc-99m Lymphoseek as comparator or “truth” standard. 
These proportions used similar numerators as the concordance variables, but used the 
number of lymph nodes or patients that were identified intraoperatively by Tc-99m 
Lymphoseek as the denominator. 
Other efficacy endpoints included measures of Tc-99m Lymphoseek detection and VBD detection relative 
to pathological finding of metastases in the excised lymph nodes, and calculations of sensitivity and false 
negative rates (FNRs) for each detection method in all patients undergoing lymphadenectomy. 
Exploratory endpoints were based on subgroup analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy measures 
by study site and by tumour type (melanoma vs. breast cancer). In addition, data regarding medical 
history and co-medication were summarized and exploratory analyses were conducted as needed.  
Sample size 
Exploratory results from the Phase 2 NEO3-01 study showed an intraoperative concordance rate between 
Tc-99m  Lymphoseek  and  VBD  of  0.944  for  melanoma  and  breast  cancer  patients.  An  observed 
concordance rate of at least 0.95 was assumed. 
The hypothesis of H0: P ≤ 0.90 versus Ha: P > 0.90 was evaluated by a one-sided exact test of a binomial 
proportion with a nominally stated α-level = 0.05. Given an assumed observed concordance rate of 0.95 
and  a  target  Type  II  error  rate  of  0.20  (80%  power),  the  minimum  sample  size  estimate  was  203 
VBD-stained lymph nodes that fulfilled the definition of the ITT population. The exact α-level and power 
of the test were 0.0495 and 85.89%, respectively. 
The number of patients needed to satisfy the sample size requirement of 203 VBD stained nodes was a 
random variable, and depended on two observed quantities: the proportion of patients having at least one 
VBD-stained lymph node and the number of such nodes per patient. Data from the Phase 2 NEO3-01 
study suggested that 0.90 of the patients would have at least one VBD-stained node. The number of VBD 
nodes per patient was expected to range from 1.0 (by definition) to 1.5 for those patients with these 
nodes. As a crude estimate, 226 ITT patients (203 blue dye nodes/0.90 blue dye nodes/patient) were 
needed to yield 203 VBD-stained nodes. This estimate assumed that each patient having a VBD stained 
node would contribute at most one such node for analysis. From the NEO3-01 study, approximately 0.95 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014

of the enrolled patients met criteria that were similar to the ITT definition used for this trial. Thus, to 
obtain the desired number of ITT-based patients and VBD stained lymph nodes, the patient estimate of 
226 patients was upwardly adjusted to 238 patients (226 patients/0.95). 
Patient accrual was restricted such that no more than 60% of the 203 VBD-stained lymph nodes came 
from a certain cancer type. That is, either cancer type (breast cancer, melanoma) could not contribute 
more than 122 VBD-stained nodes to the primary analysis of concordance. 
Randomisation 
This was an open-label, single arm, within-patient comparative study. Concordance between techniques 
in identifying lymph nodes before excision was evaluated on data collected within each patient. After 
meeting protocol-specified eligibility criteria, each patient was assigned a unique patient number 
identifying him/her within the trial. Once assigned, all patients received a single 50 μg dose of Tc 99m 
Lymphoseek. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label, single arm (nonrandomized) study. 
Statistical methods 
Four prospectively planned population definitions were used for analysis and reporting, in the pivotal 
studies.  
The ITT population consisted of those eligible patients (and nodes excised from such patients) who signed 
informed consent, were injected with Tc-99m Lymphoseek and VBD, underwent surgery, and had one or 
more lymph nodes stained blue intraoperatively by VBD for which the pathologist confirmed the type (i.e., 
lymph node versus non-lymph node) and contents (e.g., tumour cells).  
A PP population was limited to those ITT patients (and nodes excised from such patients) for whom there 
were no associated major protocol violations that impacted the assessment of efficacy.  
The safety population consisted of all patients (and nodes excised from such patients) who had signed 
informed consent and received any injection of Tc-99m Lymphoseek.  
The safety PP population was limited to those safety patients (and nodes excised from such patients) for 
whom there were no associated major protocol violations that impacted the analyses.  
The primary analysis population of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints was the ITT population 
including all study sites; the secondary endpoints related to pathology were based on the safety 
population; and supportive analyses used the PP and safety PP populations. 
One additional population was defined in the study the NEO3-05 study- the RITT (reverse ITT) population 
which included all enrolled patients (and their lymph nodes) who were injected both Tc-99m Lymphoseek 
and VBD, who underwent surgery and had at least one lymph node detected intraoperatively by Tc-99m 
Lymphoseek, and for whom the tissue type (lymphatic/non-lymphatic) and pathology status 
(presence/absence of tumour cells) had been confirmed for the excised tissue. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints of reverse concordance (per node and per patient) used the RITT 
population. 
For both NEO3-05 and NEO3-09, the primary measure of efficacy was the concordance rate between 
Lymphoseek and vital blue in the in vivo localization of lymph node(s) prior to their excision. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014

The primary measure of concordance, based on a “per node” calculation, was of the form: 
The following hypotheses were tested on the primary endpoint of the study using an exact binomial test 
of the null hypothesis (i.e., that the true concordance rate PC1 was ≤ 0.90) with a one-sided significance 
level of α=0.05 for NEO3-05, or a two-sided significance level of α=0.05 (one-sided α=0.025) for 
NEO3-09. 
Again, for both Phase 3 studies, a secondary measure of concordance was based on a “per patient” 
estimate (PC2). This measure was calculated as: 
Analysis of concordance using the per patient derivation was based on calculating a point estimate and a 
95% exact binomial confidence interval. A formal statistical test of the per patient concordance endpoint 
was not performed. 
Additionally, the following secondary efficacy variables were analyzed for both studies: 
• 
The proportions of excised lymph nodes that were positive by pathology for four groupings of VBD 
and Lymphoseek findings were examined (i.e., blue/hot, blue/not hot, not blue/hot, and not 
blue/not hot). The denominator for each calculation was the total number of nodes excised from 
the safety population. 
•  Sensitivities and false negative rates (FNRs) were calculated separately for Lymphoseek and VBD 
in patients undergoing lymphadenectomy. Sensitivity was based on the number of excised nodes 
that were identified by a mapping agent and that were pathology positive (i.e., contained tumour) 
divided by the number of pathology-positive nodes. The FNR was calculated as the number of 
excised nodes that were missed by a mapping agent (i.e., not hot or not blue) and 
pathology-positive divided by the number of pathology-positive nodes. 
Statistical tests of hypotheses were not performed for these secondary efficacy endpoints analyses. 
Instead, point estimates and 95% exact binomial confidence intervals were calculated. 
The reverse concordance rate (PC3), based on a per node calculation, was as follows: 
The number and proportion of reverse concordant nodes for each tumour type were computed. A 95% 
confidence interval was calculated for the overall reverse concordance rate. To note, reverse concordance 
was calculated, and a statistical test of PC3 vs. 0.90 using a two-sided significance level of α=0.05, was 
conducted for NEO3-05 as defined in a supplemental statistical analysis plan (SAP). However, both 
reverse concordance and superiority testing were incorporated prospectively into the NEO3-09 study. 
For superiority testing, the following hypotheses, where PC3 was the reverse concordance rate (of VBD 
relative to Lymphoseek) and PC1 was the concordance rate (of Lymphoseek relative to VBD), were 
conducted using McNemar’s test with a two-sided significance level of α=0.05 (one-sided α=0.025). This 
test was conducted in NEO3-09 only after passing the primary endpoint of concordance of Lymphoseek 
relative to VBD. The statistical hypotheses were as follows:

a 
A secondary measure of reverse concordance was also based on a per patient estimate. This measure was 
calculated as: 
The number and proportion of reverse concordant patients for each tumour type were computed. A 95% 
exact binomial confidence interval was computed for the overall reverse concordance rate per patient. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Overall, 195 patients were screened and enrolled into the study. A total of 26 (13.3%) patients were 
withdrawn from the study. Of those enrolled patients, 179 (91.8%) received study drug administration, 
nine (4.6%) were considered to be screen failures, six (3.1%) withdrew consent prior to receiving an 
injection of Tc 99m Lymphoseek, and one (0.5%) did not receive Tc 99m Lymphoseek due to 
unavailability of the study drug at the time of injection (“Other”). 
Of those 179 patients receiving Tc 99m Lymphoseek, 169 (86.7% of the enrolled population) completed 
the study. Ten patients were withdrawn from the study after study drug administration: seven patients 
were considered to have had a protocol violation, two patients were lost to follow-up, and one patient did 
not map any radioactivity with Tc 99m Lymphoseek following injection (“Other”). 
No patients discontinued due to AEs and there were no deaths. A summary of patient disposition is shown 
in Table 24.

Patient disposition – Study NEO3-05 (all enrolled patients) 
Recruitment 
The study started on 12 June 2008 (first patient enrolled) to 18 June 2009 (last patient completed). This 
was a single dose study, with safety follow-up at 30 days post-injection. 
Conduct of the study 
There were three revisions to the original protocol (07 February 2008). Noteworthy changes are 
summarized here. However, all protocol revisions occurred prior to first patient enrollment and thus did 
not have an effect on the conduct of the study. 
Version II (13 March 2008): This amendment revised the original protocol to allow for the screening visit 
to occur up to 30 days prior to enrollment. Lymphoscintigraphy was now to be performed at surgery for 
all patients. Neoprobe now provided Lymphoseek as well as Patent Blue V to the study sites. 
Version IIB (09 April 2008): This amendment contained the following updates: 
 The two stage design was removed. 
The maximum sample size was increased from 177 vital blue stained nodes and 193 expected patients to 
203 VBD stained nodes and 238 expected patients. 
A supportive measure of the primary efficacy endpoint was added using the number of patients with VBD 
stained nodes as the denominator. 
The calculation of sensitivity/false negative rate for each detection method was added as a secondary 
efficacy endpoint. 
The modified ITT population was revised to be the ITT population; this study population must have 
pathology determination of the type and contents (i.e., tumor cells) of the excised tissue. The PP 
population was to include all ITT patients with no major protocol violations. 
The alternative hypothesis was changed from P ≥ 0.95 to P ≥ 0.90.

A list of acceptable gamma detection devices was added, and detectors were allowed if they were only 
able collect counts in 10-second intervals. 
Methods of injection and appropriate injection volumes were included: breast cancer patients could have 
intradermal, periareolar, subareolar, or peritumor injections and melanoma patients were to have 
intradermal injection. 
A procedure for pathological evaluation the excised tissue was specified. Evaluation was to include serial 
sectioning with H&E staining as well as IHC staining. IHC staining for melanoma patients was to use the 
MART-1/melan-A melanocyte differentiation antigen and/or HMB-45 antibody; IHC staining for breast 
cancer patients was to use the Anti- Cytokeratin CAM 5.2 reagent. 
Version III (20 May 2008): This protocol revision requested sites to use Lymphazurin (isosulfan blue 1%) 
for the VBD. However, if it was unavailable, Patent Blue V could be used and would be supplied by the 
Sponsor. The radiolabeling procedure was updated to include an option for a final preparation volume of 
0.5 mL for a total injection volume of 0.1 mL. 
Baseline data 
The baseline demographic characteristics of the patients in study NEO3-05 are listed in the 2 tables 
below.

Abbreviations: SD=standard deviation; min=minimum, max=maximum; lbs=pounds 
Numbers analysed 
Four analysis populations were prospectively planned and analysed. The ITT population (N=158) was the 
primary population for efficacy evaluation. The per protocol (PP) population (N=156) was used for 
supportive efficacy evaluation, consisting of the ITT population lacking major protocol violations. The 
safety population (N=179) consisted of all eligible patients injected with Tc 99m Lymphoseek. The safety 
PP population (N=176) was used for supportive safety evaluation, consisting of the safety population 
lacking major protocol violations. 
A revised Statistical Analysis Plan defined two additional data analyses for the analysis of efficacy: one 
additional population, a reverse ITT population (N=167), and a new subgroup, defined as all study sites 
except Study Sites 05 and 06. This subgroup analysis included an ITT subgroup that excluded Study Sites

05 and 06 (N=136), a PP subgroup that excluded Study Sites 05 and 06 (N=135), a safety subgroup that 
excluded Study Sites 05 and 06 (N=152), and a safety PP subgroup that excluded Study Sites 05 and 06 
(N=150). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Concordance Rate between Tc-99m Lymphoseek and Vital Blue Dye (All Sites) 
Nodal level: Of 256 lymph nodes in the ITT node population, 239 nodes were detected by both VBD and 
Tc-99m Lymphoseek. The corresponding nodal concordance rate (PC1) was 93.36%.  
The exact binomial test of this result, against the null hypothesis H0: PC1 ≤ 0.90, was statistically 
significant at the 0.05 one-sided α level (p=0.0401).  
The corresponding nodal concordance rates for melanoma and breast cancer patients were 97.52% and 
89.63%, respectively. 
Table 26: 
Count and proportion of concordant nodes (ITT population) – Study NEO3-05 
The concordance was slightly higher in the PP population: 
Table 27:  
Count and proportion of concordant nodes – Study NEO3-05 
At a patient level (ITT; N=158), the overall concordance rate (PC2) was 92.41%, with concordance 
remaining higher among melanoma patients (96.00%) than among breast cancer patients (89.16%).

Pathology Results from Excised Lymph Nodes (All Sites) 
A total of 380 lymph nodes were excised, and evaluated for histology and pathology, from the safety 
population. All but one was confirmed to be lymphoid tissue. It was later noted that this was incorrectly 
entered into the database as “not lymphoid tissue.” However, the database was not changed because of 
this post-study finding.  
Of the 380 excised lymph nodes, 41 (10.79%) were pathology-positive for presence of tumour cells. 
A  total  of  192  lymph  nodes  from  breast  cancer  patients  were  excised;  of  these,  23  (11.98%)  were 
pathology-positive for presence of tumour cells. A total of 188 lymph nodes from melanoma patients were 
excised; of these, 18 (9.57%) were pathology-positive for presence of tumour cells. 
Of these 41 pathology-positive lymph nodes, 38 nodes were identified by Tc-99m Lymphoseek, 33 nodes 
were  identified  by  VBD,  and  32  nodes  were  identified  by  both  Tc-99m  Lymphoseek  and  VBD.  The 
corresponding sensitivity rate in detection of lymph nodes positive for tumour cells was higher for Tc-99m 
Lymphoseek (0.9268) compared with VBD (0.8049). The false negative rate for VBD (0.1951) was more 
than 2.5 times the false negative rate for Tc-99m Lymphoseek (0.0732).

Concordance Rate Using the Reverse ITT Analysis Population (i.e., Reverse Concordance) 
Based on the reverse ITT concordance population (N=343 nodes from 167 patients), nodal concordance 
of VBD against Tc-99m Lymphoseek was 69.68% (239 nodes). That is, less than 70% of nodes found 
positive by Tc-99m Lymphoseek were detected by VBD. 
Reverse  concordant  nodes  are  those  nodes  that  were  determined  in  vivo  to  be  both  “blue”  (due  to 
presence of VBD) and “hot” (due to presence of Tc-99m Lymphoseek). Reverse concordant patients are 
those patients for whom all nodes that were determined in vivo to be “hot” were also determined to be 
“blue”. There was 68.21% nodal concordance in melanoma patients (118 out of 173 nodes) and 71.18% 
nodal concordance in breast cancer patients (121 out of 170 nodes). The exact binomial test of this result 
against the same null hypothesis used for primary concordance, H0: PC3 ≤ 0.90, was not statistically 
significant (p=1.0000). 
On a patient level, the overall reverse concordance was 56.89% (95 out of 167 patients), with reverse 
concordance higher among breast cancer patients (62.07%) than among melanoma patients (51.25%).

Concordance between Tc-99m Lymphoseek and Vital Blue Dye (Excluding Sites 05 and 06) 
These analyses were supplemental analyses conducted excluding Sites 05 and 06 owing to the complete 
excursion from protocol injection volumes.  
Of  215  total  ITT  nodes  evaluated  in  this  subgroup,  210  were  identified  by  both  VBD  and  Tc-99m 
Lymphoseek, giving a concordance rate of 97.67% and the exact binomial test of this result against the 
null  hypothesis,  H0:  PC1  ≤  0.90,  was  statistically  significant  (p<0.0001).  In  this  population,  nodal 
concordance  rates  from  melanoma  and  breast  cancer  patients  were  similar  (97.48%  and  97.92%, 
respectively). 
At a patient level (ITT subgroup; N=136), the overall concordance rate (PC2) was 96.32% (131 patients), 
with  concordance  being  similar  between  melanoma  patients  (95.89%)  and  breast  cancer  patients 
(96.83%).

Pathology Results from Excised Lymph Nodes (Excluding Study Sites 05 and 06) 
A total of 327 lymph nodes were excised, and evaluated for histology and pathology, for this subgroup of 
the safety population (excluding the Sites 05 and 06). All were confirmed to be lymphoid tissue, and 38 
(11.62%) were pathologically positive for presence of tumour cells.  
A  total  of  145  lymph  nodes  from  breast  cancer  patients  were  excised;  of  these,  21  (14.48%)  were 
pathology-positive for presence of tumour cells.  
A  total  of  182  lymph  nodes  from  melanoma  patients  were  excised;  of  these,  17  (9.34%)  were 
pathology-positive for presence of tumour cells.

Of  the  38  positive  lymph  nodes  (excluding  Sites  05  and  06),  36  nodes  were  identified  by  Tc-99m 
Lymphoseek,  31  nodes  were  identified  by  VBD,  and  31  nodes  were  identified  by  both  Tc-99m 
Lymphoseek and VBD. In this population, the corresponding sensitivity rate in detection of lymph nodes 
positive for tumour cells also was higher for Tc-99m Lymphoseek (0.9474) compared with VBD (0.8158). 
The false negative rate for VBD (0.1842) was more than 3.5 times the false negative rate for Tc-99m 
Lymphoseek (0.0526). 
Table 34: 
Sensitivities  and  false  negative  rates  for  Lymphoseek  and  VBD  –  Study 
NEO3-05 (safety population without sites 05 and 06) 
Sensitivities and false negative rates are also displayed by disease type.  
Of the 21 pathology positive lymph nodes from breast cancer patients, 19 (0.9048) nodes were identified 
by  Tc-99m  Lymphoseek,  15  (0.7143)  nodes  were  identified  by  VBD,  and  15  (0.7143)  nodes  were 
identified  by  both  Tc-99m  Lymphoseek  and  VBD.  Of  the  17  pathology-positive  lymph  nodes  from 
melanoma patients, 17 (1.0000) were identified by Tc-99m Lymphoseek and 16 (0.9412) were identified 
by VBD. 
The corresponding false negative rate for VBD in breast cancer patients (0.2857; 6/21) three times as 
high  as  the  false  negative  rate  for  Tc-99m  Lymphoseek  (0.0952;  2/21).  The  false  negative  rate  for 
Tc-99m Lymphoseek in melanoma was zero, whereas that of VBD was 0.0588 (1/17).

Study NEO3-09: A Phase 3, Prospective, Open-Label, Multicenter Comparison Study of 
Lymphoseek and Vital Blue Dye as Lymphoid Tissue Targeting Agents in Patients With 
Known Melanoma or Breast Cancer Who Are Undergoing Lymph Node Mapping 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The main inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as for study NEO3-05. 
Treatments 
The treatment regimen was similar to study NE03-05. Technetium Tc 99m Lymphoseek Injection was 
given in a 50 μg dose by intradermal or subareolar injection in close proximity to the primary tumor, 
followed by injection of VBD and ILM. Formulated, unlabelled Lymphoseek (tilmanocept) 0.25 mg drug 
product was radiolabeled with Tc 99m at 0.5 or 2.0 mCi, depending on time of surgery. 
Each investigational site used Lymphazurin (1% isosulfan blue for injection) as the VBD agent. 
Instructions for preparing and administering Lymphazurin were provided in the package insert. This agent 
was administered near the tumor site (according to the tumor type) via injection at or near the time of ILM 
(prior to incision). 
Objectives 
The objectives were the same as for the studies NE03-05 and NE03-06. 
The primary objective of efficacy was the concordance between Tc-99m Lymphoseek and VBD in the in 
vivo detection of the excised lymph node(s) as confirmed by pathology. 
The  secondary  objective  was  the  assessment  of  the  resected  lymph  node(s)  to  confirm  the 
presence/absence of tumour metastases. 
The safety objective was the evaluation of patient safety through observation of adverse events, clinical 
laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The endpoints were similar to studies NE03-05 and NE03-06. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  lymph  nodes  identified  intraoperatively  by 
localization  of  VBD  (by  blue  hue)  that  were  also  identified  intraoperatively  by  localization  of  Tc-99m 
Lymphoseek (by 3σ rule). This was a per node concordance measure that used the number of lymph 
nodes stained by VBD as the denominator. Concordance was achieved when a VBD-stained lymph node 
was also detected by Tc-99m Lymphoseek based on the handheld gamma probe count(s) satisfying the 
threshold criterion. Any lymph node count not meeting this threshold criterion was considered a negative 
(i.e., Tc-99m Lymphoseek non-localized) finding. 
The  first  secondary  efficacy  variable  was  a  supportive  measure  of  the  primary  concordance  rate 
calculated on a per patient basis. This per patient estimate of concordance was the number of patients for 
whom all VBD-stained lymph nodes were also Tc-99m Lymphoseek hot divided by the number of patients 
in the ITT population. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014  
Page 64/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  next  secondary  efficacy  variables  were  the  reverse  concordance  rates  (based  on  the  reverse 
intent-to-treat [RITT] population; both per node and per patient), where VBD localization was compared 
against  Tc-99m  Lymphoseek  localization,  treating  Tc-99m  Lymphoseek  as  comparator  or  “truth” 
standard. These proportions used similar numerators as the concordance variables, but used the number 
of  lymph  nodes  or  patients  that  were  identified  intraoperatively  by  Tc-99m  Lymphoseek  as  the 
denominator. 
Other secondary measures of efficacy included measures of Tc-99m Lymphoseek detection and VBD 
detection relative to pathological finding of metastases in the excised lymph nodes, and calculations of 
sensitivity  and  false  negative  rates  (FNRs)  for  each  detection  method  in  all  patients  undergoing 
lymphadenectomy. 
Exploratory  endpoints  were  based  on  subgroup  analyses  of  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy 
measures by study site and by tumour type (melanoma vs. breast cancer). In addition, data regarding 
medical  history  and  co-medication  were  summarized  and  exploratory  analyses  were  conducted  as 
needed.  
The primary safety endpoints were based on the evaluation of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, 
vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations. 
Sample size 
The hypothesis to be tested was the same as in NEO3-05, however, this time a one-sided α-level of 
0.025 was used. Given the proportions specified for testing (assumed concordance rate of 0.96) and a 
target Type II error rate of 0.10 (90% power), the minimum sample size required was 196 VBD-stained 
lymph nodes that fulfilled the definition of the ITT population. The exact one-sided α-level and power of 
the test were 0.0207 and 0.904, respectively. 
The number of patients needed to satisfy the sample size requirement of 196 VBD-stained nodes was a 
random variable, and depended on two observed quantities: the proportion of patients having at least 
one VBD-stained lymph node and the number of such nodes per patient. Based on the average number 
of ITT nodes per patient in the Phase 3 NEO3-05 study (1.5806 ITT nodes/patient), approximately 124 
ITT patients were estimated to be needed to be enrolled to produce 196 VBD-stained nodes. From 
NEO3-05, approximately 13% of the patients injected with Tc 99m Lymphoseek did not meet ITT criteria 
(did not express a blue node in vivo or did not have VBD injected). Thus, to obtain the desired number 
of ITT patients and VBD-stained lymph nodes, the estimate of 124 ITT patients needed required that 
approximately 143 patients needed to be injected with Tc 99m Lymphoseek (124 ITT patients/0.87 ITT 
patients per injected). Additionally, there were approximately 8% of the patients enrolled in NEO3-05 
who were early withdrawals. This brought the enrolment estimate for this study up to 155 (143 injected 
patients/0.92 injected patients per enrolled). 
Randomisation 
The study was designed as a single arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was designed as an open label study.

Statistical methods 
The statistical methods used to analyse the study population and the primary and secondary measures 
were the same as for study NEO3-05. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 165 patients were screened, and 163 patients were enrolled into the study. Two patients were 
evaluated to be screen failures.  
Of those patients enrolled, 93.3% (152/163) completed the study. 
A total of 11 (6.7%) patients were withdrawn from the study; no patients discontinued due to adverse 
events, and there were no deaths in this study.  
Ten patients were withdrawn  from the study prior to injection of Tc-99m Lymphoseek: four withdrew 
consent,  and  six  were  unable  to  be treated  before  completion  of  the  study  (Other:  withdrawn  due  to 
Sponsor request/before deadline). 
One patient withdrew after study drug injection; and one patient was lost-to-follow-up. 
Summaries of patient disposition are provided in the table below. 
Table 35: 
Patient disposition – Study NEO3-09 
Recruitment 
The study started on the 07 July 2010 (first patient enrolled) to 29 April 2011 (last patient completed). 
This was a single dose study, with safety follow-up at 30 days post-injection. 
Conduct of the study 
There were no major protocol violations in this study. There were no violations of inclusion criteria and 
one violation of exclusion criteria: one patient was indicated to have a tumour with a Breslow depth less 
than 0.75 mm. The patient was enrolled, and a waiver was granted, because the Breslow depth was 
unable to be determined at the time of screening due to primary tumour location underneath the right 
index fingernail. Final pathology confirmation of disease revealed tumour with Clark Level 4 (4.1 mm 
Breslow depth). This patient, therefore, met all inclusion and exclusion criteria and was included in the 
study analyses.

The largest contribution of protocol deviations involved vital sign and laboratory measurements; these 
deviations were independently reviewed by medical consultants and were considered not clinically 
significant. Thus, the deviations were considered not to have significantly influenced study results.  
There no were episodes of noncompliance within the safety population of patients receiving the study 
agent, Tc-99m Lymphoseek, at the indication total dose (50 μg).

Numbers analysed 
The total number of accrued patients was prospectively estimated to be between 124 and 155 in order to 
provide the estimated number of VBD-stained lymph nodes to power the primary outcome; 165 patients 
were enrolled; 153 patients were injected with Tc 99m Lymphoseek. 
A total of five populations were planned and analysed: the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (N=133), the 
reverse ITT (RITT) population (N=152), the per protocol (PP) population (N=133), the safety population 
(N=153), and the safety PP population (N=153). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Concordance Rate between Tc-99m Lymphoseek and Vital Blue Dye 
All 229 lymph nodes in the ITT node population that were detected by VBD (blue) were also detected by 
Tc-99m Lymphoseek (hot nodes; ≥3σ counts). The primary endpoint, the corresponding nodal 
concordance rate (PC1), was thus 100%, and the exact binomial test of this result, against the null 
hypothesis H0: PC1 ≤ 0.90, was highly significant at p<0.0001 
Additionally, the concordance rates for nodes from melanoma and breast cancer patients were also 
100%. 
Since the PP and ITT populations were identical, results were the same for the PP population.

Table 38: 
Count and proportion of concordant nodes – Study NEO3-09  
The concordance rate for every study site was 100%. The average volume of Tc-99m Lymphoseek 
injected at each study site ranged from 0.14 to 2.60 ml.  
At a patient level, the overall concordance rate of detection by both VBD and Tc-99m Lymphoseek in the 
ITT population (N=133) was 100%. Similarly, the concordance rates for melanoma and breast cancer 
patients were both 100%. Since the PP and ITT populations were identical, results were the same for the 
PP population. 
Table 39: 
Count and proportion of concordant patients – Study NEO3-09  
Reverse Concordance Rate and Superiority 
Based on the RITT analysis population (N=378 nodes from 152 patients), nodal reverse concordance of 
VBD against Tc-99m Lymphoseek was 60.58% (229 nodes). There was 58.88% reverse concordance in 
melanoma patients (116 out of 197 nodes), and 62.43% reverse concordance in breast cancer patients 
(113 out of 181 nodes). The one-sided p-value for the test of reverse concordance against the null 
hypothesis H0: PC1 ≤ PC3 was significant (p<0.0001).

Table 40:

population) 
Additionally, a one-sided test of reverse concordance against the anticipated rate of 90% (i.e., null 
hypothesis H0: PC3 ≤ 0.90) was not significant (p=1.0000). 
On a patient level, the overall reverse concordance rate of VBD against Tc-99m Lymphoseek in the RITT 
population was 50% (76 out of 152 patients). There was 49.33% reverse concordance in melanoma 
patients (37 out of 75 patients), and 50.65% reverse concordance in breast cancer patients (39 out of 77 
patients).

Pathology Diagnostic Performance 
In  the  safety  population  (N=379  nodes  in  153  patients),  40  nodes  (10.55%)  were  determined  to  be 
pathologically  positive.  Of  the  40  pathology-positive  nodes,  30  were  detected  by  both  Tc-99m 
Lymphoseek and VBD, 10 were detected only by Lymphoseek, and none were detected by only VBD or by 
neither detection method. Since the safety PP  and safety populations were identical, results were the 
same for the safety PP population.

Table 42: 
Number and Proportion of Pathology-Positive Nodes by Lymphoseek and VBD 
Detection Categories – Study NEO3-09 (Safety Population) 
In the safety population, 40 of the 40 pathology-positive nodes were detected by Tc-99m Lymphoseek, 
and 30 of the 40 were detected by VBD. The corresponding sensitivity rate for detection of lymph nodes 
for tumour cells was 100% for Tc-99m Lymphoseek, compared to 75% for VBD. The false negative rate 
was  25%  for  VBD  and  0%  for  Tc-99m  Lymphoseek.  Since  the  safety  PP  and  safety  populations  were 
identical, results were the same for the safety PP population. 
Table 43: 
Sensitivities and False Negative Rates for Tc-99m Lymphoseek and VBD – Study 
NEO3-09 (Safety Population) 
A summary of excised nodes for each detection category is shown in the table below. All 379 safety nodes, 
pathologically positive or negative, were detected by Tc-99m Lymphoseek.  
In  patients  with  melanoma,  for  the  28  pathology-positive  nodes,  20  were  detected  by  both  Tc-99m 
Lymphoseek and VBD, and eight by Tc-99m Lymphoseek only.  
In patients with breast cancer, for the 12 pathology-positive nodes, 10 were detected by both Tc-99m 
Lymphoseek and VBD, and two by Tc-99m Lymphoseek only.  
Overall, for the 339 pathology-negative nodes, 199 were detected by both Tc-99 m Lymphoseek and VBD 
and 139 by Tc-99m Lymphoseek only.

Table 44: 
Summary  of  Excised  Nodes  for  Each  Detection  Category  –  Study  NEO3-09 
(Safety Population) 
There were 33 patients with at least one pathology-positive lymph node (21 for melanoma, 12 for breast 
cancer).  Of  these,  there  were  10  patients  (8  melanoma  and  2  breast  cancer)  for  whom  all  of  their 
pathology-positive lymph nodes were hot, but at least one was not blue. Of these 10 patients, six patients 
had  all  of  their  pathology-positive  lymph  nodes  hot  and  not  blue.  No  patients  had  any  of  their 
pathology-positive  lymph nodes  blue  and  not  hot.  Therefore,  3.92%  (6/153)  of  the  safety  population 
were upstaged by Tc-99m Lymphoseek findings alone, and none was upstaged by VBD.

There were 19 patients in whom VBD failed to detect any nodes. Of those 19 patients, four had 
pathology-positive nodes. The pathology rate (percent of patients with pathology positive nodes) in these 
patients was 21.1% (4/19). In the remaining portion of patients, i.e., 133 patients for whom VBD 
detected at least one lymph node, 29 patients had at least one pathology-positive node. The pathology 
rate in these 133 patients was 21.8%. However, of the 33 patients with pathology-positive nodes, 
Tc-99m Lymphoseek detected 100% of those nodes. Therefore, Tc-99m Lymphoseek pathology 
elucidation rate was clinically important in the overall assessment of 21.1% of the VBD patient 
assessment failures (4/19) for disease status, and potentially influential in post-surgical therapy for these 
patients.

NEO3-06: A Phase 3, Prospective, Open-Label, Multicenter Study of Lymphoseek-Identified 
Sentinel Lymph Nodes (SLNs) Relative to the Pathological Status of Non-Sentinel Lymph 
Nodes in an Elective Neck Dissection (END) in Cutaneous Head and Neck and Intraoral 
Squamous Cell Carcinoma 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria 
1. The patient provided written informed consent with Health Information Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA) authorization before participating in the trial. 
2. The patient had a diagnosis of primary SCC of the head and neck either cutaneous or intraoral that 
was anatomically located in the mucosal lip, buccal mucosa, lower alveolar ridge, upper alveolar ridge, 
retromolar gingival (retromolar trigone), floor-of-the-mouth, hard palate or oral (mobile) tongue and 
was stage T1-T4a, N0, M0. 
3. Clinical nodal staging (N0) was confirmed by negative results from contrast CT scan or 
gadolinium-enhanced MRI or lateral and central neck ultrasound within 30 days of the planned

recurrence. 
• No malignancy for the past 5 years (except effectively treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, 
carcinoma in situ of the cervix effectively treated with surgery alone, lobular carcinoma in situ of the 
ipsilateral or contralateral breast treated with surgery alone, or carcinoma of the mouth that was in situ 
or minimally invasive), and no evidence of recurrence. 
7. The patient was at least 18 years of age at the time of consent. 
8. The patient had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of Grade 0 to 2 (see 
Appendix 5: Performance Status Criteria of the protocol [Appendix 16.1.1]). 
Exclusion criteria 
1. The patient had a diagnosis of SCC of the head and neck in the following anatomical areas: 
non-mobile base of the tongue, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. 
2. The patient was pregnant or lactating. 
3. The patient had clinical or radiological evidence of metastatic cancer to the regional lymph nodes. 
4. The patient had a history of neck dissection, or gross injury to the neck that precluded reasonable 
surgical dissection for this trial, or radiotherapy to the neck.

5. The patient had had other nuclear imaging studies, including technetium, conducted within 2.5 days 
(60 hours) of injection. 
6. The patient was actively receiving systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
7. The patient was currently participating in another investigational drug trial or participated within 30 
days before consenting. 
8. Patient was on immunosuppressive, anti-monocyte, or immunomodulatory therapy. 
Treatments 
All patients received Lymphoseek, which was administered in the Nuclear Medicine Department or clinic 
room by a certified nuclear medicine physician or surgeon. 
Patients scheduled for surgery on the same day of injection received 0.5 mCi (18.5 MBq) Lymphoseek (50 
μg) and patients scheduled for surgery the next day received 2.0 mCi (74 MBq) Lymphoseek (50 μg). 
Injection of Lymphoseek was at time point 00:00. Patients received 50 μg of Lymphoseek in the total 
injection volume of 0.1 to 1.0 mL. Individual injections (aliquots) did not exceed 0.5 mL or were less than 
0.1 mL. All injections were peritumoral. A total volume of 0.1 to 0.5 mL was injected from a single syringe 
in a single injection overlying the primary tumour or a total volume of 0.5 to 1.0 mL was injected from 
multiple syringes into 4 aliquots at 12:00, 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions of the clock peritumorally, or 5 
aliquots at 12:00, 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions of the clock peritumorally and to the deepest side of the 
tumour. 
Patients with intraoral SCC and cutaneous SCC had a same-day surgery injection radiolabeled with 0.5 
mCi (18.5 MBq) Tc 99m (recommended time from injection to surgery 1 to less than 15 hours) or 2.0 mCi 
(74 MBq) Tc 99m for injections on day before surgery (recommended time from injection to surgery 15 to 
30 hours). 
Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
To determine the false negative rate (FNR) associated with Lymphoseek-identified SLNs relative to the 
pathology status of non-SLNs. [The FNR was the ratio of false negatives/(true positives + false 
negatives). The estimate was made on a per-patient basis and relative to those patients with 
pathology-positive nodes.] 
Secondary Objectives: 
To determine the sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and overall accuracy of 
Lymphoseek-detected SLNs relative to the pathology status of non-SLNs. Additional secondary 
objectives included the detection rate of SLNs by Lymphoseek and the rate of tumor detection in 
non-SLNs. 
Safety Objective: 
To evaluate patient safety through observation of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital 
signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations.

Efficacy Analysis: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the FNR associated with Lymphoseek-identified SLNs relative to 
non-SLNs. Lymphoseek-identified lymph nodes constituted the in vivo-identified lymph nodes such that, 
when counted with a handheld gamma detector, counts met or exceeded the defined 3 sigma gamma 
counting rule (3σ rule). 
The estimate was made on a per-patient basis and relative to those patients with pathology-positive 
nodes as assessed by local or central pathology. Where both pathology assessments were conducted but 
differed (i.e., local laboratory results were negative but central laboratory results were positive), the 
central pathology results determined the final pathology status of the node. 
Lymphoseek positivity was based on radioactivity or counts derived from the application of the handheld 
gamma detector in vivo, where such counts satisfied the 3σ rule of greater than the quantity of 3 square 
roots of the mean background count (i.e., 3 standard deviations [SD]) added to the mean background 
count. Any nodal count not meeting this 3σ rule was considered a negative finding (not localized and/or 
not detected as an SLN).  
Once in vivo SLN(s) were identified by the presence of Lymphoseek, they were removed and their ex vivo 
radioactivity status was also determined. All tissue excised to the extent that such tissue represented 
anatomical locations that harbored SLN(s) were also counted ex vivo with a handheld gamma detector. 
Once probing was complete, the remaining non-SLNs were also removed and assessed by pathology. All 
tissues were labeled and documented with regard to patient, anatomical location, and Lymphoseek status 
(+/- with regard to in vivo comparison to the 3σ rule)  
An initial local pathology status of the SLNs was determined via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. 
This primary trial site evaluation after bifurcation through the long axis of the lymph nodes consisted of 
sectioning the node every 2 to 3 mm producing at least 3 levels through the node for evaluation. Had this 
initial evaluation of Lymphoseek-positive nodes been positive for any tumor presence, this was recorded 
and no further local pathology evaluation was required. If this initial pathology evaluation was negative, 
additional sectioning and staining at the site were permitted based on institutional standards. Pathology 
status for tumor in all non-SLNs was categorized as positive or negative based on the slide derived from 
the single bifurcation. 
Secondary measures of efficacy included selected measures of diagnostic performance (sensitivity, NPV, 
and overall accuracy) of Lymphoseek-identified SLN(s) in relationship to the non-SLN(s). 
The secondary efficacy variables were the following proportions and rates: 
• sensitivity of Lymphoseek to detect patients with at least 1 pathology-positive SLN (sensitivity = 1-FNR) 
• negative predictive value (NPV) of Lymphoseek for detection of patients with at least 1 
pathology-positive SLN 
• overall accuracy of Lymphoseek in classifying patients with at least 1 pathology-positive lymph node 
versus those with all negative nodes 
• by-patient rate (proportion) of lymph node detection by Lymphoseek  
• by-patient rate (proportion) of tumor detection in SLNs 
• by-patient rate (proportion) of tumor detection in all lymph nodes (both SLNs and non- SLNs) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014  
Page 78/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A true negative was defined as a patient for whom all SLNs identified by Lymphoseek were pathology 
negative or no SLNs were identified and all non-SLNs were pathology negative. A true positive was 
defined as a patient for whom at least one Lymphoseek-identified SLN was pathology positive. Patients 
lacking an SLN detected by Lymphoseek but having an otherwise positive non-SLN were counted as a 
false negative. 
The by-patient rate (proportion) of the SLN detection by Lymphoseek, the by-patient rate (proportion) of 
tumor detection in SLNs, and the by-patient rate (proportion) of tumor detection in all lymph nodes were 
determined as additional secondary measures of efficacy. 
Exploratory analyses used the primary and secondary efficacy variables, categorized by trial site, 
anatomical tumor location, and time of surgery relative to Lymphoseek administration. There were no 
new exploratory efficacy variables. 
Safety: 
Safety was evaluated by examining the incidence of AEs, changes over time in laboratory tests, vital 
signs, ECGs, and physical examination findings. 
Sample size 
A total of 392 patients were expected to be accrued in order to yield 114 patients with 1 or more 
pathology-positive lymph nodes from the END (SLNs and/or non-SLNs). At the prospectively planned 
interim analysis, a total of 85 patients were injected (thus, analyzed for safety), 83 patients were in the 
intent-to-treat (ITT) population (i.e., must have been injected, gone to surgery, and had at least 1 SLN or 
non-SLN removed with a known pathology status), and 39 patients in the ITT were pathology positive. 
Randomisation 
The study was non-randomised. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was a single arm study. 
Statistical methods 
For the primary endpoint, the FNR was calculated as the ratio of false negatives/(true positives + false 
negatives). More specifically, the FNR was defined as follows: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014  
Page 79/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FNR = (# of patients with ≥  1 pathology-positive lymph node for whom Lymphoseek did not 
detect any pathology-positive SLNs) ÷ (total # of patients with ≥  1 pathology-positive lymph 
node) 
The primary endpoint was summarized by use of a point estimator and a 2-sided exact 95% confidence 
interval (CI) computed on a binomial proportion. The point estimate for FNR was simply the observed 
rate. The statistical hypotheses. 
H0: FNR ≥ 0.14 vs. Ha: FNR < 0.14 
were tested using a 1-sided significance level of α=0.025 (2-sided significance level of 0.05), such that if 
the upper limit of the 95% CI for the FNR was less than 0.14, the null hypothesis was rejected in favor of 
the alternate hypothesis. 
In order to maintain the overall level of significance at the 1-sided α = 0.025 level after a prospectively 
planned interim analysis using α = 0.02486, this test would have been performed using an adjusted 
1-sided α = 0.00032 at the completion of the trial if the trial was not stopped for efficacy at the interim 
analysis. 
For the secondary measures, sensitivity was calculated as one minus the FNR (1 – FNR). The remaining 
measures of diagnostic performance were defined as follows: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014  
Page 80/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Sensitivity of Lymphoseek to detect patients with at least 1 pathology-positive lymph node: 
Sensitivity = 1 – FNR = a/(a+c) 
• Negative predictive value (NPV) of Lymphoseek for detection of patients with at least 1 
pathology-positive lymph node: 
NPV = # patients with a true negative/# patients with true negative or false negative 
NPV = d/(c+d) 
• Overall accuracy of Lymphoseek in classifying patients with at least 1 pathology-positive lymph node 
versus those with all negative nodes: 
Overall accuracy = # patients with a true positive or a true negative/# ITT patients 
Accuracy = (a+d)/(a+c+d) 
• A by-patient rate (proportion) of tumor detection in all lymph nodes taken from the END (both SLNs and 
non-SLNs): 
Overall Proportion of Patients with Tumors = (a+c)/(a+c+d) 
The final 2 secondary endpoints were calculated as shown below: 
• A by-patient rate (proportion) of SLN detection (i.e., lymph node detection by Lymphoseek): 
Rate of SLN Detection = # of patients with SLNs total # of patients in ITT 
• A by-patient rate (proportion) of tumor detection in SLNs: 
Proportion of Patients = # of patients with ≥  1 pathology-positive SLN with Tumors in SLN(s) total # of 
patients in ITT 
Point estimates and CIs were used to summarize the secondary endpoints and subgroup analyses. These 
estimators were based on patient counts. The CIs were calculated using exact methods with a 95% 
coverage probability. 
Summarization of safety data included AEs, laboratory tests, ECGs, physical examinations, and vital 
signs. 
Prospectively Planned Interim Analysis 
A group sequential design was used as a guideline to monitor the ongoing FNR results. The stopping rule 
was based on a 1-sided test, assumed 2 unequally spaced analysis points (i.e., after 38 and 114 patients 
with a pathology-positive SLN and/or non-SLN), and had α (1-sided) and 1-β probabilities equal to 0.025 
and 0.90, respectively. The interim and final alpha levels were computed using the Wang-Tsiatis stopping 
boundaries: 
l = −ck ρ −1/ 2 k 
u = ck ρ −1/ 2 k 
The shape parameter (ρ) was set to 1.0, while k represented the analysis number (1 or 2) and c was set 
so that the type I error was equal to α. Early stopping occurred for positive (low FNR) results if the interim 
significance level for a 1-sided exact test of binomial proportion, after ≥ 38 patients with a 
pathology-positive lymph node, was ≤ 0.02486. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014  
Page 81/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An independent DSMC reviewed the interim results and made recommendations regarding early stopping 
and/or changes in the trial design.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 117 patients were screened: 101 patients were enrolled into the trial and 16 patients were 
evaluated to be screen failures. Of the 101 enrolled patients, 85 patients were injected with Lymphoseek 
and all 85 (84.2%) patients completed the trial. Of the 101 patients who were enrolled into the trial, a 
total of 16 (15.8%) patients were withdrawn. 
Table 46:   Patient disposition – Study NEO6-09 (all screened patients) 
Recruitment 
A total of 117 patients were screened: 101 patients were enrolled into the trial and 16 patients were 
evaluated to be screen failures. 
Conduct of the study 
The original trial protocol was revised 7 times with main changes being related to update of sample size, 
clinical trial information, naming conventions and editorial changes, clarification on the pathology process 
and procedures, collection of slides sections and ICH staining for central pathology, clarification on the 
administration of the medicinal product and the detection of radioactivity. Further amendments were 
made on the SAP. 
Major protocol violations occurred for 9 intraoral-tumor patients in this trial. Four of the 9 patients had 
violations of Lymphoseek dosing (either too low or too high dose). Two patients had violations of END 
(END was performed before SLN mapping for one patient and not performed for another patient. Other 
major violations occurred for 1 patient each: imaging of the regional nodal basin was performed outside 
of the 30-day window and no waiver was requested; no in vivo count was found for a third lymph node for  
a patient; and an informed-consent violation occurred for a patient (an ultrasound to confirm nodal status 
was performed the day before the patient was consented for the trial).

Numbers analysed 
Three patient populations were used to analyze and report the data: A total of 3 populations were 
analyzed in this trial: the ITT population (N=83), the PP population (N=75), and the safety population 
(N=85). The ITT population included all patients injected with Lymphoseek, who underwent surgery, and 
who had 1 or more SLNs or non-SLNs with a known pathology status. The PP population included all ITT 
patients who lacked major protocol violations where such violations compromised the assessment of the 
efficacy endpoints. The safety population included patients with signed informed consent and who 
received any injection of Lymphoseek. 
A total of 18 patients were excluded from the number of all enrolled patients (N=101) to define the ITT 
population (N=83): 16 of these patients were excluded because they were not injected with Lymphoseek 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014  
Page 83/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 2 patients were excluded because they did not have intraoperative SLNB or END, and therefore had 
no SLN or non-SLN with known pathology. 
The analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints and subgroup analyses were made using the ITT 
population as defined, whereas the PP patients were used in a supportive manner. 
Exploratory analyses, which used the primary and secondary efficacy variables, were conducted using the 
ITT population. All analyses of safety were based on the safety population, as were summaries of baseline 
data. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Analysis (False Negative Rate of Lymphoseek) 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the FNR for patients in the ITT population with at least 1 
pathology-positive lymph node that was not an SLN. Lymphoseek detection of pathology-positive lymph 
nodes is presented in Table 49.

Rate of in vivo sentinel lymph node detection in patients by lymphoseek - 
In the PP population, Lymphoseek identified at least 1 SLN in 74 of 75 patients, corresponding to a lymph 
node detection rate of 0.9867 (95% CI, 0.9279 to 0.9997). 
Other secondary outcomes: 
Lymphoscintigraphy was performed in 100% of patients overall: 6 and 79 patients with cutaneous and 
intraoral tumor types, respectively. For 92.9% of patients undergoing lymphoscintigraphy, hot spots 
representing hot tissues other than the injection site were noted on a scan.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Two retrospective meta-analyses (NEO3-14 and NEO3-15) were also conducted, contrasting Lymphoseek 
against radiocolloidal agents (e.g., Nanocoll or Nanocis), the colloidal agents being utilized on the basis of 
European clinical practice of ILM and wherein these agents may have been used in conjunction with a vital 
VBD. The results of this meta-analysis are presented in the tables below.

Retrospective meta-analyses 
In addition, NEO3-14 and NEO3-15 are meta-analysis studies on intraoperative lymph node mapping 
(ILM) agents in breast cancer patients (NEO3-14) or melanoma patients (NEO3-15) based solely on the 
European clinical practice of ILM and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).  The primary objectives were to 
evaluate the following key clinical efficacy endpoints: 
• 
• 
the localization rate of the in vivo detection of the excised lymph node(s)  
the degree of localization as measured by the number of localized nodes per patient  
NEO3-14: The efficacy results for patients with breast cancer from the Phase 3 studies NEO3-05 and 
NEO3-09  were  analysed  against  seven  European  studies  identified  from  the  literature  (Ref: 1-7).    The 
majority of the published studies used colloids in conjunction with VBD, and results for the combined use 
of  these  agents  was  compared  to  the  use  of  Lymphoseek  alone.    The  Localization  Rate  Benchmark 
Population was 6,313 patients, yielding an estimated localization rate of 0.9683 and a 95% Confidence 
Interval of 0.9529 to 0.9837.

The  study  NEO3-01  served  as  a  pilot  study  for  the  two,  phase  3,  pivotal  studies,  and  the  results  are 
discussed as supportive evidence of the efficacy of Lymphoseek. 
Table 71: 
Summary of study design for study NEO3-01 
Overall, 84 patients were enrolled, with mean age of 55.5 years (range 22 to 89 years).  Most of the 
patients were female (63.1%) and Caucasian (94.0%).   
The results of preoperative patient evaluation using Lymphoseek are summarized in the table below.  
Lymphoscintigraphy was performed in 57 of the 80 injected patients, and a “hot spot” was located in 53 of 
these patients (93.0%).

Overall, based on the investigator’s intraoperative assessment, Lymphoseek localized in at least 
one tissue sample in 75 of the 78 PP patients (96.2%). Lymphoseek was localized in lymphoid tissue for 
97.9% of patients with melanoma and for 93.5% of patients with breast cancer.  Overall, and for each 
type of tumour, the localization rate was significantly greater than 80%, the predesigned statistical 
endpoint. 
Most patients (79.5%) had their surgery the same day as being injected with Lymphoseek. Only 20.5% 
were injected and went to surgery the next day.   
The “per tissue” in vivo results for Lymphoseek localization were similar between the two tumour types for 
the same day of injection: 97.7% (melanoma) vs. 92.6% (breast cancer).   
For the next day surgery, 100% of the tissue specimens from patients with melanoma were localized 
compared with 83.3% tissue specimens from patients with breast cancer.   
A total of 46 out of 47 patients (97.9%) with melanoma localized Lymphoseek to at least one tissue, with 
similar rates between same day and next day surgery groups.  For patients with breast cancer, the “per 
patient” localization rate was 93.5% overall, with 95.5% (21/22) for same day injection and surgery and 
88.9% (8/9) for next day surgery.  These disease specific rates were not significantly different as per 
Fisher’s exact test (p = 0.5032).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application for sentinel node detection in breast cancer and  melanoma was supported by 2 pivotal 
studies and NEO3-06 and NEO3-09 and by 2 retrospective meta- analyses. Supportive evidence was also 
provided by the phase 2 study NEO3-01. 
The 2 pivotal studies (NEO3-05 and NEO3-09) in breast cancer and melanoma patients, were conducted 
comparing the lymph nodal detection rates, using Lymphoseek, with the detection rates using VBD, with 
the same patients. The primary endpoint in both studies was the concordance rate between Lymphoseek 
and VBD, i.e., the rate of Lymphoseek positivity in patients/ nodes that were positive with VBD. The CHMP 
concern, regarding the pivotal studies, was previously highlighted in the scientific advice provided to the 
Applicant, in that the current EU standard for sentinel lymph nodal detection used radiocolloids labelled 
with 99m-technetium. At the same time the difficulty in comparing 2 radiopharmaceuticals within the 
same patient was also acknowledged. For the study NEO3-05, in the ITT analysis, the applicant claims 
success based on a one-sided interval of 5%. This is generally not acceptable, and the confidence interval 
does  not  exclude  90%.  Therefore  non-inferiority  has  not  been  rigorously  demonstrated,  though  it  is 
accepted that it is very close. However, the results of this study are corroborated by the subsequently 
conducted study NEO3-09, in which there are no concerns regarding the statistical methodology. The 
applicant has further conducted a meta-analysis of the results of both the pivotal studies. 
The CHMP had concerns that the comparison of Lymphoseek was to vital blue due not to radiocolloids 
(described as the standard in the CHMP scientific advice). In order to address this concern and provide a 
comparison  with  current  EU  standard,  radiocolloids,  the  applicant  conducted  2  meta-analyses  of 
published literature of radiocolloids used in sentinel lymph nodal detection. One was conducted for studies 
in  patients  with  breast  cancer,  and  one  in  patients  with  melanoma.  The  methodology  and  dose  of 
radiation  in  most  of  the  studies  chosen  for  the  meta-analyses  was  similar  to  the  Lymphoseek  pivotal 
studies. Therefore, the CHMP considered the meta-analyses as supportive evidence for the application. 
The indication for sentinel node detection in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas is 
supported by the pivotal study NEO3-06. The Study NEO3-06 evaluated, as the primary endpoint, the 
false negative rate on using Lymphoseek for sentinel node detection in head and neck squamous cell 
cancers. For this study the DSMC recommended stopping the trial for efficacy (which ended in 
approximately 40 months) because of the positive (low) false negative rate (FNR), which reached the 
statistical significance specified for the stopping rule.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Breast cancer and malignant melanoma: 
In  the  analyses  of  the  two  pivotal  Phase  3  studies  in  breast  cancer  and  melanoma,  Lymphoseek 
demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  concordance  rate  with  VBD.  Additionally,  Lymphoseek 
demonstrated a statistically superior concordance rate for lymph node detection when compared with the 
reverse concordance rate of VBD. Therefore, a  high proportion of nodes that were VBD positive were 
detected  by  Lymphoseek,  whereas  a  lower  proportion  of  nodes  that  were  Lymphoseek  positive  were 
detected by VBD. 
The detection concordance between Lymphoseek and VBD was similar among patients with melanoma 
and patients with breast cancer. 
Lymphoseek  also  demonstrated  a  higher  sensitivity  for  detecting  pathology-positive  lymph  nodes, 
corresponding to a decreased false negative rate when compared with VBD, on a per node basis.

Retrospective meta-analyses from breast cancer and malignant melanoma: 
The  retrospective  meta-analyses  compared  Lymphoseek  results,  obtained  in  the  two  pivotal  Phase  3 
studies, to data from recent SLN peer-evaluated mapping studies of European practice (i.e., using colloids 
in  conjunction  with  VBD)  in  patients  with  known  breast  cancer  or  melanoma.  The  applicant  claimed 
superiority by comparing the results of Lymphoseek with the lower boundary of the confidence interval for 
the estimate of the European studies. This was considered not an acceptable proof of superiority.  
However, for the localisation rate the lower end of the confidence interval for Lymphoseek did lie above 
the  upper  end  of  that  of  the  European  studies  for  both  breast  and  melanoma,  and  for  the  degree  of 
localisation, even though the confidence intervals did not exclude one another, those of Lymphoseek did 
lie above the point estimate for the European studies. From this data, it was concluded that Lymphoseek 
was at least not inferior to the European standards. 
Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas: 
The  primary  end-point  of  the  pivotal  study  in  head  and  neck  squamous  cell  cancer  patients  was  the 
evaluation of the false negative rate.  
There were 39 patients that were found to have cancer in at least one loco-regional node. Only in one 
patient was the sentinel node that was identified by Lymphoseek found to be negative and any other node 
positive.  This  gives  a  false  negative  rate  of  2.56%  (95%  CI,  0.06%  to  13.49%)  for  sentinel  node 
localisation.    This  was  significantly  better  than  the  predicted  performance  (p<0.0205).  Lymphoseek 
sensitivity  was  therefore  0.9744  (95%  CI,  0.8652  to  0.9994);  NPV  was  0.9778  (95%  CI,  0.8823  to 
0.9994); and overall accuracy was 0.9880 (95% CI, 0.9347 to 0.9997). No differences in analyses by 
clinical trial site or by anatomical location of the primary tumour yielded any observable effect.  
The applicant’s description of a false negative rate (i.e., when the “hot” node(s) removed are examined 
histologically and found to have no evidence of cancer but other “cold” nodes in the block dissection are 
found  to  contain  cancer)  was  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.    However,  the  less  rigorous 
examination  of  the  “non-sentinel  nodes”,  i.e.,  nodes  not  taking  up  Lymphoseek;  as  compared  to  the 
rigorous examination of the Lymphoseek designated “sentinel nodes” was a concern. It was considered 
that  the  less  rigorous  examination  of  the  non-sentinel  nodes  would  have  underestimated  the  false 
negative rate.  
In  their  response,  the  applicant  referred  to  clinical  practice  guidelines  and  expert  opinions  regarding 
sentinel node detection, to justify the asymmetrical examination of the sentinel and non-sentinel nodes. 
The applicant also provided evidence from the literature to demonstrate that a more thorough pathology 
review  of  non-SLN  rarely  leads  to  false  negatives  being  found.  Review  of  literature  showed  2  studies 
conducted with radiocolloids which did perform rigorous examination of non-sentinel nodes as is expected 
of sentinel nodes (Christensen et al 2011; Stoeckli et al 2007). These studies demonstrated that sentinel 
nodes were never missed  by the diagnostic and that therefore, there is no need in future to perform 
rigorous examination of the non-sentinel nodes, when this specific method of detecting sentinel nodes is 
employed. Reasons have been provided to show that the performance of Lymphoseek is at least similar to 
radiocolloids,  as  seen  in  patients  with  breast  cancer  and  malignant  melanoma.  In  addition  further 
statistical evaluation of the results based on the radiocolloid data from the literature, demonstrates that 
the  chances  of  having  any  additional  pathology-positive  patients  in  the  44  pathology-negative  (pN0) 
patients of Study NEO3-06 are extremely low at less than 0.36% (0.0036).

This issue was discussed at the SAG. The SAG acknowledged that the histological examination of lymph 
nodes as performed in the study reflects current practice and did not raise particular concerns regarding 
a potential under-estimation of the false negative rate with respect to a more intensive sampling (the 
false-negative rate would not be expected to change significantly). Therefore, based on the applicant’s 
responses and the opinion of the SAG (see below) concerning the methodology of the histopathological 
examination,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  indication  in  head  and  neck  cancer  was  not  approvable. 
Therefore,  based  on  the  opinion  of  the  SAG  and  the  inclusion  criteria  of  patients  in  the  pivotal  trial 
NEO3-06, the CHMP restricted the indication to localised squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. 
The CHMP also noted that the results of this study would have been useful in the assessment of the impact 
of  Lymphoseek  on  “diagnostic  thinking”  and  “patient  management”  of  Lymphoseek  in  head  and  neck 
cancer. It was discussed that SLN dissection is not standard clinical practice for head and neck cancers. 
However,  it  is  acknowledged  that  impact  of  Lymphoseek  on  “diagnostic  thinking”  and  “patient 
management” has been demonstrated in breast and melanoma cancers. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Lymphoseek in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for visualisation of lymphatic drainage of 
solid malignant tumours for diagnostic purposes (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Supportive study 
The data from the supportive study NE0-01 also confirmed that Lymphoseek has a high specificity for 
lymph nodes relative to other tissues as all tissues identified by Lymphoseek (171) were histologically 
confirmed to be lymphoid tissue. Overall, Lymphoseek showed a high per tissue sensitivity rate (92%) 
and a low false negative rate (8%) in the tumour-positive lymph nodes, which suggests that Lymphoseek 
is accurately identifying lymph nodes that have a high potential for containing tumour metastases.   
Additional expert consultation 
Following a CHMP request, a Scientific Advisory Group meeting was convened on 11 July 2014 to provide 
advice on the list of questions adopted by the CHMP at its April 2014 meeting. The SAG final answers to 
the questions from the CHMP are as follows: 
1.  Is sentinel LN identification of value in the staging and/or pre-operative evaluation of 
patients with head and neck cancer?  
Based on the available data, the value of sentinel-node identification in head and neck cancer 
(more specifically, oral cavity cancer) in terms of clinical outcome is currently unknown. Although 
conceptually one could envisage a place for this approach (in view of the expected reduction of 
morbidity associated with the ability to avoid neck dissection), there is a concern that recurrence 
may be adversely affected. The data presented in the application did not include clinical outcomes 
and do not allow to address this risk. Further studies on clinical outcomes compared to standard 
approaches are warranted.  
2.  If so, would this be applicable to head and neck cancer in general or is there a need to 
restrict by tumour type and/or location?  
In view of the general concerns expressed in the answer to question No. 1 (lack of clinical 
outcome data to establish the benefits and risks of this approach), there is no convincing 
evidence-based support for the approach as a whole and it is therefore not possible to propose 
evidence-based restrictions.

In oral cavity cancer, sentinel node detection is performed in some experienced institutions but is 
not an established approach based on generally acceptable scientific standard. In published 
studies and local guidelines, sentinel-node detection is often restricted to T1-T2, N0 squamous 
cell oral cavity cancer in patients without prior treatment for head and neck cancer. This 
restriction is mainly driven by the risk of recurrence associated with more advanced stages. Also, 
T3-T4 tumours generally require neck dissection anyway, so that sentinel lymph node detection 
is generally not relevant. Furthermore, in T3-T4 tumours, extensive tumour invasion may stop 
the tracer from entering the node, leading to false-negative results.  
3.  To what extent might it be reasonable to extrapolate the data in breast cancer and 
melanoma to other tumour types and locations, including head and neck cancer, with 
respect to identification of the sentinel node(s).  
It is not possible to extrapolate the benefits of this approach from melanoma and breast cancer to 
oral cavity cancer. This is due to important differences between these diseases, for instance in 
terms of drainage patterns by tumour type (e.g., rapid lymphatic drainage in melanoma; sentinel 
node activity outside the expected basin in breast cancer and melanoma), practical aspects of the 
nuclear medicine procedure (e.g.,  interpretation criteria in case of multiple “hot spots” in head 
and neck cancer), as well as biology (e.g., prevalence of loco regional disease versus systemic 
spread) and additional treatments that may affect outcome (systemic versus local therapy). 
4.  The claim for an indication for Lymphoseek in the evaluation of patients with head and 
neck cancer is supported by a study intended to evaluate the false negative rate for 
identification of tumour positive nodes. Is the study methodology satisfactory and do 
the presented results reliably establish the false negative rate? Specifically, is the SAG 
reassured that the histological examination of nodes not identified as sentinel by 
Lymphoseek is sufficient and does not raise concerns regarding under-estimation of 
the false negative rate? 
The submitted study is not considered satisfactory from a methodological point of view since it 
does not provide information about the long term clinical outcome (locoregional relapse) and the 
reliability to evaluate false negative rate associated with Lymphoseek when compared to EU 
accepted standard methods (radiocolloids). 
When evaluated per lymph node (as it was presented), the false negative (FN) rate and the 
negative predictive values (NPV) have the disadvantage to depend on the number of lymph nodes 
which have been resected: a large number of resected lymph nodes will lead to a large number of 
negative lymph nodes (true negative TN) and thus to a “dilution” of the small number of false 
negative nodes [NPV = TN/(TN+FN)]. This approach could be of interest in a comparative study 
(which is not the case of the study presented) with the adequate statistical corrections for 
clustered data. A patient-based approach is needed, with a clear definition of FN and TN patients. 
However, it is acknowledged that the histological examination of lymph nodes as performed in the 
study reflects current practice and did not raise particular concerns regarding a potential 
under-estimation of the false negative rate with respect to a more intensive sampling (the 
false-negative rate would not be expected to change significantly). 
The lack of an appropriate control (radiocolloids) and long term results (locoregional relapse rate) 
remain major issues. 
5.  Are such data sufficient in principle to establish the place of Lymphoseek in the 
staging and/or pre-operative evaluation of patients with head and neck cancer? Does 
the SAG consider that the benefits outweigh any risks relating to false negative 
evaluation?  
The data submitted are not sufficient to establish the benefits and risks of lymphoseek (see 
answers to questions No. 1-4). Although the benefits (in view of the expected reduction of 
morbidity associated with the ability to avoid neck dissection and its rare complications) can be 
assumed, the risk of an increase in the rate of recurrence is not known and therefore is not 
considered acceptable. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014  
Page 102/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is also a risk of increased recurrence if the procedure is not adequately performed. In trials 
with multiple institutions, a high number of false-negative results has been observed, which 
raises concern as to the general reproducibility of the method[14]. 
6.  If the SAG considers that these data are not sufficient to support the requested 
indication, what further information would the SAG consider necessary? 
Whether sentinel node biopsy might replace neck dissection in patients with clinically negative 
neck lymph nodes who suffer from oral squamous cell carcinoma is unknown. A comparative 
study on clinical outcome against standard therapy is considered necessary in order to establish 
the benefits and risks of this procedure. 
Furthermore, the SAG considered that in the context of the current application (melanoma, 
breast indications): 
• 
• 
The use of blue dye alone was not the best comparator to use in the breast and melanoma 
studies since the combination of radio-colloids and blue dye has been established as a 
superior approach compared to blue dye alone [15]. Nanocolloid is the EU standard for 
these indication and therefore this compound should have been used as comparator. 
Furthermore, the blue dye detection being visual only takes into account the axillary 
basin, whereas the detection of radioactive sentinel node in the internal mammary chains 
may impact the patient management (resection in some cases, more frequently 
prophylactic irradiation) [16]. Moreover, lymphatic mapping with blue dye only in 
melanoma is cumbersome and clearly inferior to radio colloids, especially in aberrant 
drainages. 
In the meta-analyses presented, the precise number of nodes which have been detected 
as sentinel lymph nodes should be reported for the different tracers since a high rate of 
positive detection may artificially reduce the false-negative rate. If all resected lymph 
nodes are considered sentinel nodes the false negative rate will be 0 and the NPV will be 
100%. However, this decreases the interest in the method. The procedure is meant to be 
a minimally invasive, but accurate staging mechanism.  Accordingly, the objective is to 
resect a very limited number of lymph nodes to reduce the morbidity of lymph node 
dissection and to be able to analyse those few nodes in details (e.g., thin cuts, 
immunohistochemistry). The definition sentinel node (in every study) must be addressed 
against general definitions. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from the pivotal studies NEO3-05 and NEO3-09 supported by the meta-analyses provided 
satisfactory evidence of the efficacy of Lymphoseek in the detection of sentinel lymph nodes in patients 
with breast cancer or melanoma. The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic agent was demonstrated 
and  the  impact  on  diagnostic  thinking  and  patient  management  is  considered  self-evident  given  that 
lymph node mapping is widely used in breast cancer and melanoma.   
The results of the phase 3 study conducted in cutaneous and oral head and neck squamous cell cancer 
patients are considered supportive of the indication for sentinel node detection in this patient 
population. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data for Lymphoseek is available from the Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical studies.  Patients 
enrolled into these studies included patients with breast cancer, melanoma, or head and neck squamous 
cell carcinoma (HNSCC).  Data from a total of 542 patients contributed to an integrated safety database.   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014  
Page 103/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Primary safety data were available from three Phase 1 studies: NEO3-A and NEO3-C (patients with breast 
cancer), and NEO3-B (patients with cutaneous melanoma). In addition to the Phase 1 studies, safety data 
are  available  from  one  Phase  2  study  (NEO3-01)  and  two  completed  Phase  3  studies  (NEO3-05  and 
NEO3-09); all three of which were conducted in patients with melanoma or breast cancer diagnoses.  The 
applicant  expanded  the  safety  database  to  include  the  data  a  Phase  3  study  in  patients  with  HNSCC 
undergoing lymphatic mapping (NEO3-06).  Data from NEO3-06 patients who received a Lymphoseek 
injection and underwent surgery as of 10 May 2012 and completed the 30 day follow-up are included in 
the safety database.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Overall,  27  patients  (5.0%)  reported  experiencing  at  least  one  serious  adverse  event.    No  patients 
withdrew from the study because of an SAE or AE, and no deaths were reported.  
Within the integrated safety database, a total of 29 SAEs were reported for 27 patients (5.0%) in the 
overall safety population.  SAEs were distributed among nine SOCs, with the infections and infestations 
SOC having the highest incidence (n=7; 1.3%).  The only SAE that occurred in more than one patient was 
cellulitis (4 patients).  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Overall, changes from baseline to post-injection (postoperative) time points were small for haematology 
parameters, except basophils (overall mean decreased from baseline approximately 40%), eosinophils 
(overall mean decreased from baseline approximately 50%), lymphocytes (overall mean decreased from 
baseline  approximately  33%),  and  monocytes  (overall  mean  increased  from  baseline  approximately 
28%). 
Overall,  variability  was  high  (S.D.  greater  than  one-third  of  the  mean)  for  basophils,  eosinophils, 
leukocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes.  
Shifts from Baseline: 
Haematology parameters at baseline and at 6 to 30 hours post-injection were categorized as being below 
normal range, within normal range, or above normal range. Shift tables for each parameter show the 
number  of  patients  who  moved  within  these  three  categories  from  baseline  to  the  post-injection 
(postoperative) assessment. 
CHMP assessment report

Clinical Chemistry 
Overall,  changes  from  baseline  to  post-injection  time  points  were  small  for  all  blood  chemistry 
parameters. Variability was high (S.D.s greater than one-third of the mean) for alanine aminotransferase, 
alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin.  
An  AE  of  hyperglycaemia  was  reported  for  one  patient  with  high  glucose,  and  one  patient  with  high 
glucose had a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes. An AE of hypoglycaemia was reported for one 
patient with low glucose. 
Urinalysis 
Mean changes over time 
Overall, means and S.D.s, at baseline and during the 6 to 30 hour safety assessment period, for specific 
gravity, urobilinogen, and pH did not vary from baseline to post-injection time points. Overall, variability 
was high (SDs greater than one-third of the mean) for urobilinogen. 
Of six urinalysis values judged by the investigator as clinically significant, two clinically significant values 
occurred  in  two  patients  at  the  6  to  30  hour  assessment  but  baseline  values  were  missing,  and  four 
clinically  significant  values  occurred  in  two  patients  during  both  baseline  and  the  6  to  30  hour  safety 
assessment period in the melanoma and breast cancer disease groups 
None of these abnormal clinical laboratory parameters reported as AEs were judged to be related to study 
drug. 
Shifts from Baseline 
Urinalysis  parameters  (specific  gravity,  urobilinogen,  and  pH)  at  baseline  and  at  6  to  30  hours 
post-injection  were  categorized  as  being  below  normal  range,  within  normal  range,  or  above  normal 
range.  Shift  tables  for  each  parameter  show  the  number  of  patients  who  moved  within  these  three 
categories  from  baseline  to  the  post-injection  assessment.  No  shifts  occurred  in  greater  than  3%  of 
patients comprising the safety population. 
Only one urinalysis parameter, specific gravity, displayed a two-category shift in ≥ 1% of patients. This 
occurred  in  1.1%  of  patients  from  above  normal  range  before  injection  to  below  normal  range 
post-injection. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Vital Signs 
Vital signs at baseline and at 6 to 30 hours post-injection are summarized across cancer type for the 
pooled studies. 
Vital signs monitored at baseline, 15 and 30 minutes, and 1, 2, and 6 to 30 hours post injection included 
systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, radial pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature 
(in degrees Fahrenheit). No clinically significant findings were observed at baseline or during the 6 to 30 
hour post-injection assessment period. 
Any  patients  who  had  post-injection  vital  signs  recorded  perioperatively  and/or  intraoperatively  were 
under  the  effects  of  anaesthesia.  Due  to  the  influence  of  anaesthesia  and  the  operating  room 
environment,  these  vital  signs  are  expected  to  be  decreased  and  do  not  represent  any  effects  of 
Lymphoseek.

Abnormal vital sign results that were reported as AEs include hypertension (in one patient in NEO3-05) 
and hypotension (in four patients, two in NEO3-09 and two in NEO3-06). The investigator judged the 
hypertension AE to be mild in severity, not serious, and not related to study drug. The investigator judged 
one of the hypotension AEs as mild in severity, two of the AEs as moderate in severity, and one as severe. 
The severe event, occurring in one patient in the HNSCC group, was also judged as serious . This serious 
AE, like the other AEs of hypotension, was not related to study drug and resolved. The other three events 
of  hypotension  were  judged  as  not  serious.  Only  one  of  these  vital  sign  results  reported  as  an  AE 
(hypertension) did not resolve. 
Physical Examination Findings 
Findings from the physical examinations remained normal from baseline to post-injection timepoints for 
most  patients  as  shown  in  the  shift  table  for  physical  examination  findings.  Greater  percentages  of 
patients had shifts from abnormal to normal than from normal to abnormal for findings related to skin; 
neck; head, eye, ear, nose and throat (HEENT) examination; heart; lungs; abdomen; and extremities. 
For findings related to lymph nodes, more shifts were recorded from normal to abnormal than abnormal 
to normal and for general appearance, shifts were similar in both directions, from normal to abnormal and 
from abnormal to normal.   
Electrocardiograms 
Mean Changes Over Time 
Changes in mean ECG parameters, overall, from baseline to the 6 to 30 hour safety assessment period 
were minimal (increases in heart rate of 5.3 bpm, PR of 5.2 msec, and QT of 4.1 msec; decreases in QRS 
duration of 0.9 msec and QRS axis of 1.4 degrees) and not clinically significant 
Changes in Individual Patients 
Of 10 patients with ECG changes that the investigator judged as abnormal and clinically significant, for 
five of these patients with missing values or values within the normal range at baseline, the abnormal 
changes occurred during the 6 to 30 hour safety assessment period in the melanoma, breast cancer, and 
HNSCC disease groups. 
Abnormal ECG results that were reported as AEs in the SOC investigations were ECG abnormal and ECG 
ST-T segment abnormal (in one patient), and ECG T-wave inversion (in two patients). In the SOC cardiac 
disorders AEs were reported in ten (1.8%) of 542 patients overall and included atrial fibrillation (in three 
patients);  myocardial  infarction,  sinus  bradycardia,  and  tachycardia  (two  patients  each);  and 
bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, and ventricular extrasystoles (one patient each).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the overall safety population, close to 40% of the patient population experienced an adverse event. It 
should be noted that all patients underwent surgery soon after the administration of Lymphoseek, and a 
large number of the adverse events are attributed to surgery or other related treatments. Only 3% of the 
population had an adverse event that was attributed by the investigators to be related to Lymphoseek.  
Most of these were localised to the site of administration of Lymphoseek. In the 553 patients evaluated in 
the clinical studies, the most common adverse reactions were injection site irritation (0.7%; 4 of 553 
patients) and injection site pain (0.2%; 1 of 553 patients). It is unlikely that there are drug interactions 
with Lymphoseek, as it is administered to the site and travels to the local lymph glands. Therefore, the 
lack of drug interaction studies is acceptable. The applicant did not submit studies in special populations 
such  as  hepatic  impairment,  renal  impairment  and  paediatric  popualtion.    The  number  of  patients  is 
insufficient  to  make  any  meaningful  conclusions  on  differences  or  similarity  of  adverse  events  by 
demographic  subpopulations,  however  racial  and  gender  differences  are  unlikely  to  have  any  major 
differences in adverse events. Differences in BMI or disease types may influence differences in surgical 
outcomes but are also considered unlikely to have differences in response to Lymphoseek injection. There 
is no expectation to see any major differences between the groups. The missing data has been addressed 
in the RMP. 
The incidences of serious adverse events were also low and none were attributed to Lymphoseek, and 
there were no deaths. 
The dose of radioactivity was increased, from 1 mCi to 2 mCi, in anticipation of the extension of time from 
injection to SLN biopsy. The dose of radiation, however, is well below the 99mTc index for other imaging 
procedures.  
Elderly  patients  aged  65  or  older  (32%)  were  evaluated  in  clinical  studies;  no  safety  issues  were 
identified.  No dose adjustment is recommended based on age. 
The safety and efficacy of Lymphoseek in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years has not yet 
been established. No data are available. 
The product is contraindicated for patients whish have hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of 
the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to any of the components of the radiolabelled pharmaceutical. 
Renal and hepatic impairment  
Careful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation 
exposure is possible. The estimated radiation dose to the patient would not exceed 0.69 mSv even if none 
of a 74 MBq dose (2.0 mCi) were eliminated (see section 4.2). 
The patient should be well hydrated before the start of the examination and frequent voiding of urine 
during the initial hours after examination would reduce radiation exposure to the patient.  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Precautions with respect to environmental hazard see section 6.6.

When an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is 
important to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be 
assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the woman 
has  missed  a  period,  if  the  period  is  very  irregular,  etc.),  alternative  techniques  not  using  ionising 
radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient.  
There are no data from the use of Lymphoseek in pregnant women.  No reproductive toxicity studies in 
animals were performed, and it is not known if Lymphoseek can cause foetal harm when administered to 
a pregnant woman.  
Radionuclide procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation dose to the foetus. Only 
essential  investigations  should  therefore  be  carried  out  during  pregnancy,  when  the  likely  benefit  far 
exceeds the risk incurred by the mother and foetus. 
It is not known whether technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept is excreted into human milk.  
Before administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breast-feeding consideration should be 
given  to  the  possibility  of  delaying  the  administration  of  radionuclide  until  the  mother  has  ceased 
breast-feeding, and to what is the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the 
secretion of activity in breast milk. If administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be 
interrupted for 24 hours post injection and the expressed feeds discarded. 
Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with Lymphoseek. 
Lymphoseek has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. 
Exposure to ionizing radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for the development of 
hereditary defects. As the effective dose to an adult (70 kg) is 0.69 mSv when the maximal recommended 
activity of 74 MBq is administered adverse events are expected to occur with a low probability. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
The total injection amount should not exceed 50 micrograms tilmanocept, with a total maximum 
radioactivity of 74 MBq per dose.  Chronic or acute overdose is unlikely to occur given the total injection 
amount. No clinical consequences were observed at dose levels of 3.7 times the recommended dose of 
Lymphoseek in humans, or at 390 times the anticipated human exposure of tilmanocept in animals.  
In the event of administration of a radiation overdose with tilmanocept the absorbed dose to the patient 
should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body by 
frequent micturition or by forced diuresis and frequent bladder voiding 
In general, radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used, and administered only by authorised persons 
in  designated  clinical  settings.  Their  receipt,  storage,  use,  transfer,  and  disposal  are  subject  to  the 
regulations and/or appropriate licenses of the competent official organisation.  
Radiopharmaceuticals  should  be  prepared  in  a  manner  which  satisfies  both  radiation  safety  and 
pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.

Contents of the vial are intended only for use in the preparation and radiolabelling of Lymphoseek and are 
not to be administered directly to the patient without first undergoing the preparative procedure.  Each 
250 microgram vial contains an excess of product.  However, it is recommended that the vial be prepared 
as instructed and a 50 microgram aliquot be used for a single patient dose; any remaining material should 
be discarded after reconstitution and use. 
For instructions on reconstitution and radiolabelling of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 12.  The radiolabelled product is a clear, colourless solution with no visible particles. 
If at any time in the preparation of this product the integrity of this vial is compromised it should not be 
used.  
Administration  procedures  should  be  carried  out  in  a  way  to  minimise  risk  of  contamination  of  the 
medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory. 
The  content  of  the  kit  before  extemporary  preparation  is  not  radioactive.  However,  after  sodium 
pertechnetate (99mTc), Ph.Eur is added, adequate shielding of the final preparation must be maintained.  
The  administration  of  radiopharmaceuticals  creates  risks  for  other  persons  from  external  radiation  or 
contamination  from  spill  of  urine,  vomiting,  etc.  Radiation  protection  precautions  in  accordance  with 
national regulations must therefore be taken.  
Any  unused  medicinal  product  or  waste  material  should  be  disposed  of  in  accordance  with  local 
requirements. 
For instructions on the safe preparation of Lymphoseek see the SmPC section 12. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
There are no serious concerns with regards to the clinical safety of Lymphoseek. The incidence of adverse 
events  related  to  Lymphoseek  was  low,  and  the  radiation  exposure/  absorbed  doses  are  within  the 
acceptable limits. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
All tissues detected by Lymphoseek in studies NEO3-05 and NEO3-09, were confirmed to be lymph nodal 
tissue. The results of these pivotal studies show a greater detection rate with Lymphoseek for all nodes; 
as  well  as  lower  false  negative  rate  with  Lymphoseek  for  pathologically  positive  lymph  nodes,  in 
comparison to vital blue. This is demonstrated by the high concordance rate and the comparatively low 
reverse concordance rate, between sentinel node detection by Lymphoseek and VBD. 
Therefore the efficacy of Lymphoseek in the detection of sentinel nodes in patients with breast cancers or 
melanoma  is  considered  demonstrated.  The  beneficial  effects  (diagnostic  performance  and  patient 
management) of sentinel node detection in these patient populations are already recognised in clinical 
practice. 
The  proposed  indication  currently  includes  head  and  neck  cancers.  Although  there  were  concerns 
regarding  the  methodology  of  the  study,  it  has  been  justified  that  there  is  very  minimal  chance  for 
additional positive pathology in the study patients. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  CHMP  in  previous  scientific  advice  stated  that  VBD  was  not  considered  standard  practice  in  the 
European setting. This issue was addressed by the applicant by providing retrospective meta-analyses of 
EU  published  literature  using  the  CHMP  recommended  comparator,  radiolabelled  sulphur  colloid. 
Comparison of the results from the meta-analyses with the results of pivotal studies with Lymphoseek 
showed that from these indirect comparisons it is possible to conclude that Lymphoseek inferiority to the 
European standards is unlikely. There are no further uncertainties in the beneficial effects in relation to 
the  breast  cancer  and  melanoma  indication.  However,  for  the  indication  in  localised  squamous  cell 
carcinoma of the oral cavity, it is acknowledged that although there is increasing interest and recognition 
of a possible benefit of sentinel node detection in head and neck cancer, it is not recognised as standard 
practice that is widely accepted and used in the EU. There is a lack of long-term data on the outcome of 
patients  that  have  been  staged  and  resected  based  on  the  detection  of  sentinel  node  for  localised 
squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
There are no major concerns with regards to the clinical safety of Lymphoseek. The incidence of adverse 
events  related  to  Lymphoseek  appears  low,  and  the  radiation  exposure/  absorbed  doses  are  within 
acceptable limits. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/718908/2014  
Page 117/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There is uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects on patients with impaired renal and 
hepatic function. There were no data submitted on elimination, excretion and metabolism of Lymphoseek 
in humans. It is thought that metabolism of Lymphoseek occurs in the liver and that elimination primarily 
occurs via renal excretion. Therefore, warnings have been included in the SmPC and the risks have been 
addressed in the risk management plan.  
As the overall total patient exposure to Lymphoseek is small, there may be rare events that have not been 
reported so far. These risks will be managed through the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The  efficacy  of  Lymphoseek  in  the  detection  of  sentinel  lymph  nodes  in  patients  with  breast  cancer, 
melanoma and localised squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity has been demonstrated. In addition, 
the diagnostic performance and impact on patient management has been established for sentinel lymph 
node detection with the use of radiocolloids in clinical practice.  
The risks associated with the use of Lymphoseek in intraoperative lymph nodal mapping in breast cancer 
and melanoma appear to be low and manageable. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
Based on the results of the pivotal trials NEO3-05, NEO3-09 and NEO-06 and the supportive data from the 
meta-analyses, the benefits of Lymphoseek in the imaging of SLN in breast cancer, melanoma and 
localised squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity outweighed the adverse events (injection site 
irritation and injection site pain). Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance for 
Lymphoseek in the indication for imaging and intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes draining a 
primary tumour in adult patients with breast cancer, melanoma, or localised squamous cell carcinoma of 
the oral cavity is positive.   
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Lymphoseek in the diagnosis of “This medicinal product is for 
diagnostic use only. Radiolabelled Lymphoseek is indicated for imaging and intraoperative detection of 
sentinel lymph nodes draining a primary tumour in adult patients with breast cancer, melanoma, or 
localised squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.  External imaging and intraoperative evaluation 
may be performed using a gamma detection device.” is favourable and therefore recommends the 
granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

Divergent positions expressed by CHMP members 
Some members of the CHMP expressed a divergent position as follows: 
Divergent opinion 
For the localised squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity indication: 
There is no convincing evidence-based support for the indication in localised squamous cell carcinoma of 
the oral cavity.  There is only data from a small study in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma, 
intended to evaluate the false negative rate for identification of tumour positive nodes. In this study there 
was a false negative rate of 2.5% (0.6%; 13.5%), i.e. compatible with possible lymph node involvement 
not detected by Lymphoseek in up to around 10+% of the patients, this is considered too high to be 
acceptable. 
For the breast cancer and melanoma indication: 
Regarding the indication for sentinel-node identification in melanoma and breast cancer, it has not been 
clearly demonstrated that Lymphoseek is at least similar to radiolabelled nanocolloids (which is standard 
European practice (EMA/150127/2010)) in terms of technical and diagnostic performances.  Further 
cross-over studies on concordance between Lymphoseek and nanocolloids are warranted. 
The CHMP members that have a divergent position for all indications are:

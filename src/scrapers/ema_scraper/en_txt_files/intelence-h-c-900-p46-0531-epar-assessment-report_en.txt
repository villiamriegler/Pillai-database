1.  Introduction 
On 24/02/2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study (TMC125-C234 - IMPAACT P1090 
study) for Intelence, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
The main results from the Week 48 of this study have been submitted to EMA in January 2019 
(procedure EMEA/H/C/00900/P46/053). The results of the post Week 48 follow-up period are described 
in the clinical study report, which is included in this submission and a summary of the results is also 
described in the short critical expert overview. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
This study was part of the Intelence Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-000222-PIP01-08-M09, 
decision P/0121/2019), for which a full PIP compliance check has been performed (compliance 
statement EMEA-C-000222-PIP01-08-M09). The extension of the indication in HIV-1 infected pediatric 
subjects aged ≥2 to <6 years (procedure EMEA/H/C/000900/II/0058) was approved by the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) in April 2020, based on the Week 48 analysis of Study TMC125-C234/P1090. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Three tablet formulations are registered in EU, which can be either swallowed whole or dispersed: 
- A scored 25-mg tablet (F066). 
- A 100-mg tablet (F060). 
- A 200-mg tablet (F068). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In the European Union (EU), INTELENCE, in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) and 
other antiretroviral (ARV) medicinal products, is indicated for the treatment of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced adult patients and 
in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced pediatric patients beginning at 2 years of age. The 
recommended dose of ETR for paediatric patients aged ≥2 years to <18 years and weighing ≥10 kg is 
based on body weight:

The extension of the indication in HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects ≥2 to <6 years of age was based 
on the Week-48 analysis of Study TMC125-C234/P1090. The MAH submitted a final report of this 
study, including the long-term follow-up period after the week 48 endpoint. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study TMC125-C234 (IMPAACT P1090) 
The design and W48 results of this study were already detailed and discussed within the 
PAM P46/053 and the variation II/058. 
Description 
Study TMC125-C234 (IMPAACT P1090) is an ongoing Phase 1/2 study which evaluates the 
pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of ETR in HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 
aged 2 months to <6 years who were on a virologically failing ARV regimen (containing ≥3 ARVs) for 
at least 8 weeks or on a treatment interruption of at least 4 weeks with a history of virologic failure 
while on a combination ARV regimen (containing ≥3 ARVs). The main results from the Week-48 of this 
study are summarized in this document. 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary Objectives 
- To evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics of ETR in combination with an OBR in HIV-infected 
children aged ≥ 2 months to < 6 years. 
- To determine the safety and tolerability of ETR in combination with an OBR in children aged ≥ 2 
months to < 6 years, through 48 weeks of therapy. 
- To determine the appropriate dose of ETR in combination of an OBR for children aged ≥ 2 months to 
< 6 years. 
Secondary Objectives 
- To assess the antiretroviral activity of ETR containing regimens through 48 weeks of therapy. 
- To determine the immunological changes (change in CD4 percent and absolute count; 
CD4/CD8 ratio and percent) through 48 weeks of ETR therapy in combination with an OBR. 
- To determine changes in viral drug resistance during 48 weeks of ETR therapy in combination with an 
OBR. 
- To assess the relationship between ETR pharmacokinetics and the antiviral activity and safety of ETR 
containing regimens. 
- To explore the relationship between subject-specific gene CYP profile, sex, age, weight, race, HIV 
regimen (e.g., boosted PI) and HIV response markers and pharmacokinetics of ETR.

Study design 
This is a Phase I/II, multicenter, open label 48 week study of ETR in combination with at least 2 active 
agents (a boosted PI and at least one additional active drug), for treatment experienced HIV-1-infected 
infants and children ≥ 2 months to < 6 years separated by age into three cohorts. 
The study was planned to be conducted in the following 3 age cohorts: 
Each cohort was to begin enrollment into an initial mini-cohort of 6 subjects. Once the PK and safety 
data were found to be acceptable (as defined per protocol), enrollment was to be continued at the 
same ETR dose to complete enrollment of the remaining subjects in that age cohort (for Cohort I: at 
least 12 subjects), and the mini-cohort of the next age cohort was to be opened for enrollment. 
Subjects in the specific cohort were to continue their treatment at the selected dose, with the aim to 
have at least 12 evaluable subjects whose initial dose was the final recommended ETR dose for their 
age cohort according to PK and safety criteria. 
A dose of ETR was considered acceptable if the dose was tolerated (based on the safety criteria) and if 
the geometric mean ETR AUC12h was between 60% and 150% of the geometric mean ETR AUC12h in 
HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced adults from the DUET studies (ie, between 2,713 and 6,783 ng•
h/mL). 
A failure to meet the safety and/or PK criteria would result in an adjustment of the (starting) dose. 
Subjects already in the (mini-)cohort were to be adjusted to the newly recommended ETR dose if the 
investigator and protocol team believed this was in the best interest of the subject. 
In addition, subjects could have an individual ETR dose adjustment, based on their individual ETR 
exposure (AUC12h) compared with the adult AUC12h from the DUET studies (ie, the individual ETR 
AUC12h should be >2,350 ng•h/mL, the 10th percentile of the ETR AUC12h in HIV-1 infected adults). 
At the start of the study, all subjects in the first mini-cohort (n=6, aged ≥2 to <6 years) were on an 
ETR dose of 5.2 mg/kg bid. A comparison of the geometric mean ETR AUC12h in the mini-cohort with 
that in adults indicated that it was unlikely that with this ETR dose (5.2 mg/kg bid for all bodyweights), 
the geometric mean ETR exposure would be within target for the full cohort. A revision of the ETR 
dosing table was therefore introduced for the remainder of the cohorts as presented below:

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/298507/2021

The study consists of a 48-week treatment period with an early study discontinuation visit for subjects 
who prematurely discontinued, a 4-week follow-up visit for the subjects who discontinued ETR, and a 
long-term safety follow-up of up to 5 years for the subjects continuing to receive study-provided ETR. 
In March 2016 the study protocol was amended by IMPAACT to align with the requirements described 
in the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) (Decision P/0163/2015) and hence offer the possibility of 
opening of Cohort III, based on available PK and safety data to ongoing participants, while the first 
mini-cohort of Cohort II may still be enrolling. This amendment also included a study “go/no-go 
decision point” which was set 2 years after opening of Cohort II in order to determine whether, based 
on the examination of accrual rate and all of the relevant safety and pharmacokinetic data, it would be 
safe and worth to continue the study in an attempt to find an optimal dose for Cohorts II and III. 
On 2 October 2017 (2 years after opening of Cohort II), in line with the study protocol, IMPAACT and 
the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) jointly decided to close enrollment in the study. Cohort I had 
been fully enrolled (N=20), as well as Cohort II (N=6 in the mini-cohort). No patients had been 
enrolled in Cohort III, as investigators preferred to continue to enrol sequentially. At the decision point, 
it was deemed unlikely to find subjects for mini-cohort III in a reasonable timeframe and the total of 
26 subjects enrolled in the study was considered sufficient to fulfil the PIP requirements and allows a 
PK and clinical analysis to assess the dose of ETR to be used in HIV-1 infected children aged <6 years. 
Results are available from the Week-48 analysis of Study TMC125-C234, which includes all available 
PK, safety, efficacy, and resistance data from Cohort I (N=20) and Cohort II (N=6) up to the cut-off 
date of 12 July 2018.

Study population/Sample size 
A minimum of 12 subjects will be enrolled into each cohort of the study. Up to 18 subjects may be 
enrolled into Cohort 1. The total sample will include at least 36 evaluable subjects who have been 
treated exclusively at the doses judged to be optimal for their age cohorts. 
Main inclusion criteria: 
- Age ≥ 2 months to < 6 years old at study entry (For subjects who were born at ≤ 37 weeks 
gestational age, the subject must be at least 12 weeks of age, AND ≥ 46 weeks post-conceptual age at 
study entry) 
- HIV-1 RNA viral load > 1,000 copies/mL 
- Treatment experienced children on a failing combination antiretroviral regimen (containing at least 3 
ARVs) for at least 8 weeks OR Treatment experienced children on a treatment interruption of at least 4 
weeks with a history of virologic failure while on a combination antiretroviral regimen (containing at 
least 3 ARVs). 
- Availability of sufficient active ARV drugs to create an OBR consistent with protocol requirements. 
- Ability to swallow ETR whole or dispersed in an appropriate liquid. 
Main exclusion criteria: 
- Evidence of phenotypic resistance to ETR at screening. Phenotypic cutoffs of > 10 for loss of 
sensitivity for cohorts I, II, III. 
- Diagnosis of a new CDC Stage C. 
- Disallowed medications, including: Darunavir use in subjects < 3 years old, Fosamprenavir/ritonavir 
(etravirine increases fosamprenavir exposure posing a potential safety issue), Maraviroc, 
Saquinavir/ritonavir, Tipranavir/ritonavir (tipranavir/ritonavir significantly decreases etravirine), 
Ritonavir, used as sole PI therapy, Unboosted PIs including nelfinavir (drug interaction unknown – 
etravirine may increase nelfinavir), Other NNRTIs. 
Treatments 
Study treatment is defined as etravirine (ETR) 25 mg and 100 mg tablets. Both will be provided by the 
study. ETR will be dosed orally according to the dosing table:

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/298507/2021  
Page 8/16 
 
 
 
ETR tablets should be swallowed whole with a sufficient amount of water or other liquid within 30 
minutes following a meal. Subjects unable to swallow the tablets whole may disperse the tablets in a 
container with a minimum of 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of water. One minute should be allowed for the 
tablet(s) to be dispersed, stirring will aid in the dispersion. The dispersed tablet(s) in water may be 
further diluted with a beverage (see list below) not to exceed 30 mL (2 tablespoons) total volume. The 
recommendation for administration to infants is to disperse the tablet in approximately 10 mL of liquid 
(e.g. formula or milk). 
Darunavir 100 mg/mL suspension, darunavir 75 mg tablets, and darunavir 150 mg tablets, will be 
provided through the study if not reasonably available locally. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoints: 
Toxicity Endpoints: 
- Termination from treatment due to a suspected adverse drug reaction (SADR)

- Adverse events of Grade 3 or higher severity 
- Death 
Pharmacokinetic Endpoint: Failure to meet PK targets: The target geometric meanETR AUC12h for this 
study is between 60% and 150% of the geometric mean AUC12h observed in HIV-1-infected 
treatment-experienced adults from the DUET studies (i.e. between 2713 and 6783 ng•h/mL). For the 
individual subject management in this study, subjects with an individual AUC12h below the 10th 
percentile of adult exposure (i.e. <2350 ng•h/mL) will be dose-adjusted in order to meet an AUC12h ≥ 
2350 ng•h/mL. 
Results 
The W48 results (including baseline characteristics, efficacy, PK and safety results) were 
already detailed and discussed within the PAM P46/053 and the variation II/058. Only the 
long-term follow-up period results are provided. 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Twenty-six subjects (20 subjects from Cohort I [≥2 to <6 years age group] and 6 subjects from 
Cohort II [≥1 to <2 years age group]) had been enrolled and received at least one dose of ETR. 
Seventeen subjects (75.0% [15/20] in Cohort I and 33.3% [2/6] in Cohort II) completed the study. A 
total of 9 subjects (25.0% [5/20] in Cohort I and 66.7% [4/6] in Cohort II) had discontinued ETR and 
the study. In total, 4 subjects discontinued the study prior to Week 48 (2 subjects in each cohort) and 
5 subjects discontinued the study after Week 48 (3 subjects in Cohort I and 2 subjects in Cohort II).

Efficacy results 
Virologic response and failures were not assessed during the long-term follow-up period. 
Plasma Viral Load Over Time 
The overall plasma viral load as assessed by log10 HIV-1 RNA (copies/mL) showed a gradual decrease 
postbaseline for both age groups and was maintained below the baseline values until the end of the 
study.

Immunology 
The CD4+ counts and percentages showed an increase from baseline over time for Cohort I (≥2 to <6 
years age group), while no consistent trend was observed overtime in Cohort II. However, the CD8+ 
counts and percentages showed a consistent decrease from baseline over time in both cohorts. 
Furthermore, for both cohorts the resulting change from baseline in CD4/CD8 ratio over time was 
positive and maintained above the baseline throughout the study.

Resistance 
There was no genotype/phenotype evaluation performed in the follow-up period since there was no 
early discontinuation for any subject during this period. 
Safety results 
The long-term safety data from the follow-up phase, which lasted 577 days was similar to that 
observed in the 48-Week Phase of the study. No new safety signals were observed; furthermore, 
changes in clinical laboratory values, vital signs and physical examination finding were consistent with 
those observed in the 48-week study phase.

Common AEs 
During the entire treatment phase including data up to Week 48, all 26 (100.0%) subjects reported at 
least 1 AE. The most frequently reported AEs (≥50%) in the combined group by PTs were nasal 
congestion (20 [76.9%] subjects), cough (19 [73.1%] subjects), rhinorrhea (15 [57.7%] subjects), 
pyrexia (14[53.8%] subjects), and rash (13 [50.0%] subjects). 
Drug-related AEs 
During the entire treatment phase including data up to Week 48, there were 5 (19.2%) subjects (4/20 
[20.0%] subjects from Cohort I [≥2 to <6 years age group] and 1/6 [16.7%] subject from Cohort II 
[≥1 to <2 years age group]) who reported AEs that were considered at least possibly related to ETR as 
assessed by the investigator Adverse events which were considered at least possibly related to ETR 
were blood pressure diastolic increased and vomiting in 1 subject and lipase increased in 2 subjects 
from Cohort I (≥2 to <6 years age group) and rash in 1 subject from Cohort II (≥1 to <2 years age 
group). 
SAEs 
During the entire treatment phase including data up to Week 48, eight (30.8%) subjects total reported 
10 SAEs; 5/20 (25.0%) from Cohort I (≥2 to <6 years age group) and 3/6 (50.0%) subjects from 
Cohort II (≥1 to <2 years age group). All SAEs occurred between baseline and the Week 48 visit, 
except for 1 event each of Grade 3 neutrophil count decreased and Grade 3 forearm fracture, which 
occurred post Week 48 analysis treatment phase; both these events were in subjects from Cohort I 
(≥2 to <6 years age group). Two subjects had more than 1 SAE (lipase increased and platelet count 
decreased platelet count decreased and ligament sprain). Three SAEs were Grade 4 in severity 
(platelet count decreased, lipase increased, and anemia) and 1 SAE was Grade 2 in severity (ligament 
sprain); all other events were Grade 3 in severity. There were no deaths during the study. 
Two SAEs of lipase increased in 2 subjects from Cohort I (≥2 to <6 years age group) were considered 
to be at least possibly related to ETR. Six SAEs were considered at least possibly related to the 
Optimized Background Regimen (OBR): lipase increase (n=2; Cohort I [≥2 to <6 years age group]), 
neutrophil count decreased (n=2; Cohort I [≥2 to <6 years age group] and n=1; in Cohort II [≥1 to 
<2 years age group]), and anemia (n=1; Cohort II [≥1 to <2 years age group]).

AEs of interest 
During the entire treatment phase including data up to Week 48, there were 20 (76.9%) subjects (15 
[75.0%] subjects from Cohort I [≥2 to <6 years age group] and 5 [83.3%] subjects from Cohort II 
[≥1 to <2 years age group]) with at least 1 AEOI. The AEOIs reported were related to skin, hepatic, 
pancreatic, lipid-related, neuropsychiatric, and neoplasm events. 
Post Week 48, there were 2 additional subjects with skin-related AEOIs. One subject from Cohort I (≥2 
to <6 years age group) experienced AEOI of the category ‘rash cases’ and 1 subject from Cohort II 
(≥1 to <2 years age group) experienced AEOI of the category ‘cutaneous reactions’. Both events were 
Grade 2 in severity, not reported as serious, and considered as not related to treatment with ETR. 
No other AEOIs (hepatic, pancreatic, lipid-related, neuropsychiatric, and neoplasm events) were 
reported post Week 48. There were no cardiac or bleeding events reported during the entire study 
period. 
Laboratory parameters 
The majority of the treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were Grade 1 or Grade 2. 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities were observed in a total of 9 subjects, 25.0% (5/20) of 
subjects in Cohort I and 66.6% (4/6) of subjects in Cohort II; all were reported as AEs. Apart from the 
earlier described Grade 4 alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
Grade 3 and Grade 4 lipase, and Grade 3 cholesterol abnormalities, the following Grade 3 and 4 
hematologic abnormalities were reported: 
- Lipase: One subject from Cohort I with Grade 0 at baseline had Grade 3 toxicity postbaseline and 1 
subject from Cohort I with Grade 2 at baseline had Grade 4 toxicity postbaseline. 
- ALT: One subject from Cohort II with Grade 0 at baseline had Grade 4 toxicity postbaseline 
- AST: One subject from Cohort II with Grade 0 at baseline had Grade 3 toxicity postbaseline 
- Hemoglobin: One subject from Cohort II with Grade 0 at baseline had Grade 4 toxicity postbaseline 
- Platelets: One subject from Cohort II with Grade 0 at baseline had Grade 3 toxicity postbaseline 
- Neutrophils: Three subjects from Cohort I with Grade 0 at baseline had Grade 3 toxicity postbaseline 
and 1 subject from Cohort II with Grade 1 at baseline had Grade 3 toxicity postbaseline 
Other safety observations 
None of the AEs relating to vital signs (increases in blood pressure and pulse) during the entire 
treatment phase were considered clinically significant. No Grade 4 increases in systolic blood pressure 
or diastolic blood pressure were observed. 
Vital sign results for the entire treatment period were the same as the results up to Week 48. There 
were no additional changes in the vital sign evaluation post Week 48 analysis. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The Week  48  results  of  study  TMC125-C234  were  already  assessed  for  the  extension of  indication  of 
Intelence  in  HIV-1  infected  pediatric  subjects  aged  ≥2  to  <6  years.  The  long-term  follow-up  data  of 
this  study,  above  the  Week  48  endpoint,  did  not  identify new  efficacy  nor  safety  concerns.  However, 
the  number  of  subjects  is  very  limited,  with  only  17  subjects  who  have  continued  their  ETR-based

treatment above 48 weeks. Only a few additional AEs have been reported after 48 weeks. Overall, all 
the  AEs  possibly  related  to  ETR  reported  during  the  whole  study  are  already  listed  in  the  Intelence 
SmPC. Of note, since the last Week 48 report, there was no new resistance data.  
In  conclusion,  the  data  from  this  paediatric  study  are  consistent  with  the  known  efficacy  and  safety 
data of ETR in adult subjects and did not impact the current indication in paediatric subjects ≥2 years 
old. No revision of the currently approved SmPC is considered warranted. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

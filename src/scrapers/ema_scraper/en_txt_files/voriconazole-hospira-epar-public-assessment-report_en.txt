2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Voriconazole is a broad spectrum, second generation triazole antifungal agent with close structural similarity to 
fluconazole.  Like  other  azole  antifungals,  voriconazole  acts  by  inhibiting  the  cytochrome  P450-dependent 
enzyme, 14-α-sterol demethylase that is required for ergosterol biosynthesis. Exposure of fungi to voriconazole 
results in depletion of ergosterol and accumulation of 14- α-methylated sterols which are thought to contribute 
to the disruption of membrane structure and function thereby inhibiting fungal growth. 
In vitro, voriconazole displays broad-spectrum antifungal activity against Candida species (including fluconazole 
resistant  C.  krusei  and  resistant  strains  of  C.  glabrata  and  C.  albicans)  and  fungicidal  activity  against  all 
Aspergillus species tested. In addition voriconazole shows in vitro fungicidal activity against emerging fungal 
pathogens,  including  those  such  as  Scedosporium  or  Fusarium  which  have  limited  susceptibility  to  existing 
antifungal agents. Its mode of action is inhibition of fungal cytochrome P450-mediated 14α-sterol demethylation, 
an essential step in ergosterol biosynthesis. 
Voriconazole  has  shown  various  levels  of  clinical  efficacy  against  Aspergillus  spp  (including  A.  flavus,  A. 
fumigatus,  A.  terreus,  A.  niger,  A.  nidulans),  Candida  spp.  (including  C.  albicans,  C.  glabrata,  C.  krusei,  C. 
parapsilosis, C. tropicalis,  C. dubliniensis, C. inconspicua,  C. guilliermondii), Scedosporium spp.(including S. 
apiospermum, S. prolificans) and Fusarium spp.  
The reference medicinal product for this application, Vfend 200 mg powder for solution for infusion is indicated 
in adults and children aged 2 years and above as follows: 
 
 
 
 
Treatment of invasive aspergillosis. 
Treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients 
Treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei). 
Treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/151531/2015 
Page 7/23 
 
  
  
VFEND  should  be  administered  primarily  to  patients  with  progressive,  possibly  life-threatening 
infections. 
 
Prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in high risk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) 
recipients. 
The applicant for this generic medicinal product chose to apply for the above indications, except the prophylaxis 
one. It is therefore proposed that Voriconazole Hospira is indicated in adults and children aged 2  years and 
above as follows: 
 
 
 
 
Treatment of invasive aspergillosis. 
Treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients 
Treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei). 
Treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp. 
Voriconazole should be administered primarily to patients with progressive, possibly life-threatening infections. 
The applicant proposed an additional pack size containing 5 vials, in addition to the one containing 1 vial, as is 
the case for the reference medicinal product. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a powder for solution for infusion containing 200 mg of voriconazole as 
active substance.  
Other ingredients are: sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium (SBECD). 
The product is available in 30 ml clear type I glass vial closed with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper and sealed with 
an aluminium flip off seal with a red plastic matte top button.  
After reconstitution each ml contains 10 mg of voriconazole. Once reconstituted, further dilution is required 
before administration. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of voriconazole is (2R,3S) -2- (2,4-difluorophenyl) -3- (5-flouro-4-pyrimidinyl) 
-1(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) 2-butanol and has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/151531/2015 
Page 8/23 
 
  
  
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white or almost white powder that is very slightly soluble in water, 
freely soluble in acetone and methylene chloride.  
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. 
The structure of voriconazole has been confirmed by CHN analysis, UV, IR, 1H NMR, MS, DSC and XRD studies. 
Voriconazole exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 2 chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is controlled 
routinely by chiral HPLC. Polymorphism has been observed for voriconazole. Based on DSC and X-Ray diffraction 
studies, it is concluded that the manufacturing process followed by ASMF holder consistently produces the same 
polymorphic form. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Voriconazole is synthesized in 4 main steps using commercially available well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. Two manufacturing sites are involved in the voriconazole manufacture. 
The  active  substance  manufacturer  has  developed  a  high  yielding  diasterioselective  process  to  form 
voriconazole. 
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the 
ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, solubility, identity (IR, HPLC), appearance of 
solution (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurities including eniantomeric purity (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water 
content  (Ph.  Eur.),  heavy  metals  (Ph.  Eur.),  sulphated  ash  (Ph.  Eur.),  polymorphic  identity  (XRD),  nickel 
(ICP-OES), bacterial endotoxin test (Ph. Eur.), TAMC/TYMC and test for specified microorganisms  (Ph. Eur.). 
Voriconazole is described in the Ph. Eur. and limits are in line (or tighter) with current Ph. Eur. limits.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/151531/2015 
Page 9/23 
 
  
  
 
 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods  appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data (7 batches including 3 production scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  on  6  batches  including  3  production  scale  batches  of  active  substance  from  the  proposed 
manufacturers stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 60 
months (18 months for the 3 production scale batches) under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The parameters tested were the same as for release.  The analytical methods used were the same as for release 
and were stability indicating. 
As part of analytical method validation, photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 
two  batches.  Results  showed  that  the  active  substance  is  light  sensitive  but  adequately  protected  in  the 
proposed packaging. Results also showed that voriconazole is very sensitive to base, slightly degraded due to 
acid and peroxide, and very slightly degraded due to water at 60˚C. Voriconazole is not degraded due to thermal 
or humidity stress conditions.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development  
The  aim  was  to  develop  a  powder  for  solution  for  infusion  that  contains  200  mg  of  voriconazole  in  a 
concentration of 10 mg/ml once reconstituted, that has a safety and stability profile similar to the centrally 
authorised reference product Vfend (EMEA/H/C/000387). The applicant has developed the formulation based on 
the information from the product information available for reference product, the analytical results obtained 
from analysis of the reference product and CHMP  EPAR-scientific discussion report for Vfend published. The 
studies performed by applicant on the reference product as part of the development work are qualitative and 
quantitative  composition,  container  closure  characterization,  head  space  analysis  and  physicochemical 
properties of reference product.  
The excipient types and grades were selected to be the same as those in the reference product. The excipient is 
a  well-known  pharmaceutical  ingredient  and  its  quality  is  compliant  with  pharmacopoeial  standards  (USP). 
There is no novel excipient used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC. 
Comparative  data  between  the  proposed  finished  product  and  the  reference  product  regarding  substitution 
pattern and average degree of the SBECD molecule as well data on formation of the complex active substance 
/excipient were provided. 
No bioequivalence study was performed as the generic finished product is applied by parenteral administration 
route. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/151531/2015 
Page 10/23 
 
  
  
The proposed manufacturing process consists of a sterile filtration /aseptic process followed by a lyophilisation 
step.  
The applicant has performed extensive development and optimization studies of the proposed manufacturing 
process.  
No overage is used. However, an overfill is included to allow an extractable volume of 20ml. 
Compatibility studies were performed to assure that the finished product is compatible with reconstituents and 
diluents  listed  in  the  package  leaflet.  Results  demonstrate  that  voriconazole  is  physically  compatible  and 
chemically stable when reconstituted with: water for injection or Sodium chloride (0.9%) solution for injection, 
and further diluted with 5% Dextrose and Lactated Ringers USP, 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride USP, 
5% Dextrose and 20 mEq Potassium Chloride USP, 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride USP. 
The primary packaging is 30 ml clear type I glass vial closed with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper and sealed with 
an  aluminium  flip  off  seal  with  a  red  plastic  matte.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  The  choice  of  the 
container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the  intended  use  of  the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls  
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  5  main  steps:  solution  preparation/compounding,  pre-  and  sterile 
filtration,  filling  and  stoppering,  lyophilisation,  capping  and  labelling.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a 
non-standard manufacturing process.  
The critical steps are compounding, filtration, filling and lyophilisation. 
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on 3 production scale batches. In addition the 
following validation data were also provided: filter validation, media fill study, holding time validation data, 
validation of sterilization and depyrogenation of containers and closures. It has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, 
identification of the active substance (UV, HPLC), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), water content (KF), 
pH (Ph. Eur.), appearance and clarity of reconstituted solution (visual and Ph.Eur.), colour of solution (Ph. Eur.), 
reconstitution time, uniformity of dosage units (Ph.  Eur.), osmolality (Ph.Eur.), sterility (Ph.  Eur.), bacterial 
endotoxins level (Ph. Eur.), particulate contamination (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods  appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  on  three  production  scale  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/151531/2015

Stability of the product 
Stability data on 3 production scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 12 months 
at 25 ºC / 60% RH and  30 ºC / 65% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Samples were stored in the inverted and upright position. The 
batches are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed 
for marketing.  
Samples were tested according to the methods used for release testing with the exception of the identification 
of the active substance test, the uniformity of dosage units test and osmolality test that were not performed. The 
analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Stress studies on the finished product were performed by subjecting the samples to temperature cycling. The 
study was performed by storing samples at –20°C ± 5°C for 48 hours followed by 40°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5% RH 
for 48 hours for a total of 3 temperature cycles. The results demonstrate that the thermal cycling conditions had 
no impact on the stability of the finished product. 
In addition, samples from one batch of finished product stored in primary packaging, primary and secondary 
packaging and primary packaging with foil wrapping were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The results showed that there was a substantial 
increase  in  the  impurity  level  observed  in  the  directly  exposed  product  and  that  the  degradation  can  be 
prevented by storing the finished product in the outer carton. The following storage precaution “Store in the 
original package in order to protect from light” is included in the SmPC. 
Stability data regarding the finished product admixture with intravenous solutions were provided. The storage 
conditions  studied  were  storage  for  up  to  36  hours  at  refrigerated  conditions  (2°C-8°C)  for  the  primary 
reconstituted vial, followed by dilution and further storage up to 36 hours at refrigerated conditions (2°C-8°C) 
and 3 hours at room temperature. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
None.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A  non-clinical  overview  has  been  provided,  and  was  based  on  up-to-date  and  adequate  scientific  literature 
(referring 42 publications up to year 2013). The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional 
non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data.  The  non-clinical  aspects  of  the  SmPC  are 
brought  in  line  with  the  SmPC  of  the  reference  product.  The  impurity  profile  has  been  discussed  and  was 
considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology  
The pharmacology of voriconazole is well characterised and established. Additional pharmacology studies have 
not been conducted by the applicant, as they are not required for this generic MAA. The submitted non-clinical 
overview provides detailed information on the in vitro and in vivo activity-efficacy studies in animal models from 
the published literature. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of voriconazole is well known. Formal non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not been 
conducted and CHMP considered this acceptable for this generic application. 
The submitted non-clinical overview provided a comprehensive overview of the published information on the 
pharmacokinetics of voriconazole, including the PK parameters in different animal species. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Published  toxicity  data  for  voriconazole,  including  acute,  subacute  and  chronic  toxicity  data,  genotoxicity, 
reproductive toxicity, carcinogenicity were provided and assessed by the CHMP. The information included in the 
product information was deemed acceptable by the CHMP.  
The impurity profile of Voriconazole Hospira 200 mg powder for solution for infusion is considered comparable to 
that of the reference product. CHMP agreed that comprehensive toxicology studies were therefore not required. 
The non-clinical aspects included in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the product SmPC are in line with the information of 
the reference product and with the published scientific literature and were considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  was  submitted.  According  to  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk 
Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00)  the  absence  of  ERA  can  be 
acceptable for marketing authorisation applications for generic medicinal products, if adequately justified.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/151531/2015 
Page 13/23 
 
  
  
The absence of an ERA with this application was justified by the applicant by the fact that the introduction of 
Voriconazole Hospira is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes 
for all voriconazole containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the 
ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
The  applicant  also  confirmed  that  there  are  no  materials  of  animal  origin  used  in  the  manufacture  of  the 
proposed product. Therefore, there are no concerns with regard to the compliance with the Note for Guidance on 
Minimizing  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents  via  Human  and  Veterinary 
Medicinal Products (EMEA/410/01 Rev. 3). 
The  CHMP  considered  the  applicant’s  justification  for  omitting  a  further  environmental  risk  assessment  as 
acceptable. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The preclinical safety (toxicology) of voriconazole has been extensively investigated in a series of studies, which 
included in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, general toxicology studies, carcinogenicity and reproductive 
studies. Results from these studies indicate that the toxicity profile of voriconazole is well characterised and is 
acceptable. Additional toxicity studies for generic voriconazole are not warranted. CHMP agreed that the PK of 
voriconazole is sufficiently characterised and no additional studies are deemed necessary. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  provided  non-clinical  literature  and  the  non-clinical  review  pertaining  to  the  pharmacology  and  the 
toxicology of voriconazole was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This  is  an  application  for  a  powder  for  solution  for  infusion  containing  voriconazole  200  mg.  The  applicant 
provided a clinical overview outlining the clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of voriconazole, and 
provided efficacy and safety data for voriconazole based on published literature (the overview refers to 101 
publications  up  to  year  2013).  The  product  information  of  this  generic  is  brought  in  line  with  the  product 
information of the reference product, for the indications applied for. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
As  already  mentioned,  for  the  clinical  assessment  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) is of particular relevance.  
Exemption  
According to the  Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **) 
an in-vivo bioequivalence study was not requested for this application, as “the product is to be administered as 
an  aqueous  intravenous  solution  containing  the  same  active  substance  in  the  same  concentration  as  the 
currently approved product”. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/151531/2015 
Page 14/23 
 
  
  
Bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the generic medicinal product is to be administered as an 
aqueous  intravenous  solution  containing  the  same  active  substance  as  the  currently  approved  product. 
However, if any excipients interact with the active substance (e.g. complex formation), or otherwise affect the 
disposition of the active substance, a bioequivalence study is required unless both products contain the same 
excipients in very similar quantity and it can be adequately justified that any difference in quantity does not 
affect the pharmacokinetics of the active substance. 
The  excipient  sulphobutylether  beta  cyclodextrin  sodium  forms  a  complex  with  the  active  substance 
voriconazole. According to the applicant the applied product contains the same amount of sulphobutylether beta 
cyclodextrin sodium as the reference product. The CHMP therefore agreed that a biowaiver is acceptable.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Voriconazole is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral administration, with maximum plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) achieved 1-2 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of voriconazole after oral 
administration is estimated to be 96 %. 
The volume of distribution at steady state for voriconazole is estimated to be 4.6 l/kg, suggesting extensive 
distribution into tissues. Plasma protein binding is estimated to be 58 %. Less than 5% of the drug is excreted 
unchanged in the urine. The inter-individual variability of voriconazole pharmacokinetics is high. 
In vitro studies showed that voriconazole is metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP2C19, 
CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. 
In vivo studies indicated that CYP2C19 is significantly involved in the metabolism of voriconazole. This enzyme 
exhibits  genetic  polymorphism.  For  example,  15-20  %  of  Asian  populations  may  be  expected  to  be  poor 
metabolisers. For Caucasians and Blacks the prevalence of poor metabolisers is 3-5 %. Studies conducted in 
Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects have shown that poor metabolisers have, on average, 4-fold higher 
voriconazole exposure (AUCτ) than their homozygous extensive metaboliser counterparts. Subjects who are 
heterozygous  extensive  metabolisers  have  on  average  2-fold  higher  voriconazole  exposure  than  their 
homozygous extensive metaboliser counterparts. 
The major metabolite of voriconazole is the N-oxide, which accounts for 72 % of the circulating radiolabelled 
metabolites in plasma. This metabolite has minimal antifungal activity and does not contribute to the overall 
efficacy  of  voriconazole.  Voriconazole  is  eliminated  via  hepatic  metabolism  with  less  than  2  %  of  the  dose 
excreted unchanged in the urine. 
After administration of a radiolabelled dose of voriconazole, approximately 80 % of the radioactivity is recovered 
in the urine after multiple intravenous dosing and 83 % in the urine after multiple oral dosing. The majority 
(>94 %) of the total radioactivity is excreted in the first 96 hours after both oral and intravenous dosing. 
The terminal half-life of voriconazole depends on dose and is approximately 6 hours at 200 mg (orally). Because 
of  non-linear  pharmacokinetics,  the  terminal  half-life  is  not  useful  in  the  prediction  of  the  accumulation  or 
elimination of voriconazole. 
The applicant has submitted no additional PK study and CHMP agreed that no such studies are required for this 
application. 
Bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the generic medicinal product is to be administered as an 
aqueous  intravenous  solution  containing  the  same  active  substance  as  the  currently  approved  product. 
However, if any excipients interact with the active substance (e.g. complex formation), or otherwise affect the 
disposition of the active substance, a bioequivalence study is required unless both products contain the same 
Assessment report

Page 15/23 
 
  
  
excipients in very similar quantity and it can be adequately justified that any difference in quantity does not 
affect the pharmacokinetics of the active substance. 
The  excipient  sulphobutylether  beta  cyclodextrin  sodium  forms  a  complex  with  the  active  substance 
voriconazole. According to the applicant the applied product contains the same amount of sulphobutylether beta 
cyclodextrin sodium as the reference product. Thus, a biowaiver was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and CHMP agreed that no such studies are required for this 
application.  
The  primary  mode  of  action  of  voriconazole  is  the  inhibition  of  fungal  cytochrome  P-450-mediated  14 
alpha-lanosterol  demethylation,  an  essential  step  in  fungal  ergosterol  biosynthesis.  The  accumulation  of  14 
alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane and may be 
responsible for the antifungal activity of voriconazole. Voriconazole has been shown to be more selective for 
fungal cytochrome P-450 enzymes than for various mammalian cytochrome P-450 enzyme systems. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
As  already  mentioned,  all  requirements  described  in  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **, Appendix III) are fulfilled, and CHMP agreed that  a biowaiver is 
acceptable. 
Voriconazole has been in medicinal use in the EU for more than 10 years, and its efficacy and safety profile are 
well known.  
The applicant has not conducted any clinical trials for efficacy and safety with Voriconazole Hospira, since it is 
essentially similar to the reference product. 
The applicant provided in the submitted clinical overview the necessary supportive information explaining the 
information given in the proposed  Voriconazole Hospira product information. CHMP  agreed  that the  product 
information of Voriconazole Hospira included in this application reflects the approved PI of the reference product 
for the indications applied for by Voriconazole Hospira.  
The efficacy of voriconazole has been shown in a number of randomized clinical trials. A discussion on the safety 
and tolerability of voriconazole has been also provided, and has adequately addressed the known issues on renal 
safety, hepatic safety, visual disturbances and dermatological reactions. 
In accordance to the risk minimisation measures requested by the CHMP for the reference product, additional 
risk  minimisation  measures  will  be  also  introduced  for  the  important  identified  risks  of  hepatic  toxicity  and 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) for Voriconazole Hospira. Hospira will develop a Patient Alert Card, a HCP check 
list and Q&A document, similar to the requests made by the CHMP for the reference medicinal product. 
The CHMP considered the provided clinical overview on clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety as adequate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/151531/2015 
Page 16/23 
 
  
  
The CHMP also noted that the applicant has aligned the product information of Voriconazole Hospira with the 
updated product information of the reference medicinal product for the indications claimed for by Voriconazole 
Hospira.   
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers that in view of the provided information, the application is approvable from the clinical 
point of view. 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative 
requirements.  
2.6.  Risk management plan

2.7.  PSUR submission 
At the time of granting the marketing authorisation, the submission of periodic safety update reports is not 
required for this medicinal product. However, the marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety 
update reports for this medicinal product if the product is included in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) 
provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83 and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This  application  concerns  a  generic  version  of  voriconazole  200  mg  powder  for  solution  for  infusion.  The 
reference product Vfend is indicated for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, treatment of candidaemia in 
non-neutropenic patients, treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. 
krusei) and treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp. Vfend should 
be administered primarily to patients with progressive, possibly life-threatening infections. In addition, Vfend is

also indicated for the prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in high risk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) recipients, indication which was not applied for by this applicant. 
No  non-clinical  studies  have  been  provided  for  this  application,  but  an  adequate  summary  of  the  available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient by the CHMP. From a 
clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
as well as the efficacy and safety of the active  substance;  the applicant’s clinical overview on these  clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient by the CHMP. 
According  to  the    Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence  (London,  20  January  2010,  Doc.  Ref.: 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.  1/  Corr  **)  an  in-vivo  bioequivalence  study  was  not  requested  for  this 
application, as “the product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active 
substance in the same concentration as the currently approved product” and a biowaiver was accepted by the 
CHMP. 
The applicant has made the appropriate amendments to the Voriconazole Hospira product information, which 
was  brought  in  line  with  the  updated  latest  information  for  the  reference  product.  This  was  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. As mentioned above, the prophylaxis indication which was approved for Vfend was not 
claimed for by Voriconazole Hospira and is therefore not reflected in the approved PI of Voriconazole Hospira.  
The CHMP agreed that the overall benefit/risk ratio for Voriconazole Hospira 200 mg powder for solution for 
infusion is positive.  
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen  reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Voriconazole Hospira in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, treatment of candidaemia 
in non-neutropenic patients, treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. 
krusei) and treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp is favourable 
and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

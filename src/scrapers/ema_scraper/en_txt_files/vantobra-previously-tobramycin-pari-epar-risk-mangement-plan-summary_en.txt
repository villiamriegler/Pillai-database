Summary of risk management plan for Tobramycin PARI (tobramycin) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Tobramycin PARI. The RMP details 
important risks of Tobramycin PARI, and how more information will be obtained about 
Tobramycin PARI's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Tobramycin PARI's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Tobramycin PARI should 
be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Tobramycin PARI should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, 
all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Tobramycin PARI's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Tobramycin PARI is authorised for the management of chronic pulmonary infection due to 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) (see 
SmPC for the full indication). It contains tobramycin as the active substance and it is 
administered by inhalation. 
Further information about the evaluation of Tobramycin PARI’s benefits can be found in 
Tobramycin PARI’s EPAR, including its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tobramycin-pari. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of Tobramycin PARI, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Tobramycin PARI's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
• 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen as to ensure 
• 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
• 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Tobramycin PARI is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
 
 
 
 
 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Tobramycin PARI are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be administered safely. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Tobramycin PARI. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to 
be collected.

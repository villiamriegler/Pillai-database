1. 
Introduction 
Obesity is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the greatest public health 
challenges  for  the  21st  century  with  alarming  trends  in  several parts of the world, including Europe 
[World Health Organization, 2005a].  It is a condition where there is excess body fat, resulting from a 
positive  energy  balance.    Obesity  occurs  when  an  individual’s  energy  intake  exceeds  energy 
expenditure  from  physical  activity  and  metabolic  processes  over  a  long  period  of  time.    Being 
overweight  is  invariably  a  precursor  to  being  obese,  and  as  such  it  is  the  greatest  risk  factor  for 
obesity.    The  adverse  health  consequences  of  overweight  and  obesity  are  numerous  and  well 
documented  [World  Health  Organization,  2002],  and  in  Europe  it  is  known  that  overweight  and 
obesity (along with raised cholesterol and hypertension) are among the risk factors associated with the 
greatest loss of healthy life [Lopez, 2006]. 
Currently in Europe, almost 400 million adults are estimated to be overweight and about 130 million 
to be obese [World Health Organization, 2005a].  The average BMI (Body Mass Index) in Europe is 
now  26.5 kg/m2  and  overweight  affects  between  25%  and  75%  of  the  adult  population  among  the 
different countries within Europe [World Health Organization, 2005a]. 
Data  on  the  prevalence  of  overweight  and  obesity  among  adults  have  been  reported  from  most 
countries  in  the  European  Union  (EU),  although  the  age  range  and  dates  of  the  surveys 
differ[International Association for the Study of Obesity, 2007].  Prevalence varies markedly between 
countries with the proportion of males with a BMI ≥25 kg/m2 ranging from 45.7% (Estonia) to 75.4% 
(Germany), and for females ranging from 34.5% (Italy) to 58.9% (Germany).   
Risks  of  coronary  heart  disease,  ischaemic  stroke,  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  and  certain  cancers 
increase  steadily  with  increasing  BMI  [World  Health  Organization,  2002].  Obesity  is  a  major  risk 
factor  for  osteoarthritis  [Woolf,  2006]  and  is  also  associated  with  obstructive  sleep  apnoea 
[Kopelman, 2000], atrial fibrillation, and asthma [Malnick, 2006]. However, it should not be assumed 
that  the  health  consequences  are  limited  to  the  severely  obese  population:  risks  to  health  increase 
progressively  from  well  below  the  overweight  threshold  [International  Obesity  Task  Force,  2005]. 
According to the World Health Report, 58% of diabetes globally, 21% of ischaemic heart disease and 
between  8%  and  42%  of  certain  cancers  were  attributable  to  BMI  >21  kg/m2  [World  Health 
Organization, 2002]. 
alli  (orlistat)  is  indicated  in  conjunction  with  a  mildly  hypocaloric  diet  for  the  treatment  of  obese 
patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater or equal to 30 kg/m², or overweight patients (BMI > 
28 kg/m²) with associated risk factors. 
The currently approved formulation is presented as 120 mg hard capsules. 
In  this  Annex  II  application,  the  applicant  applied  for  the  introduction  of  a  lower  strength,  orlistat 
60 mg hard capsules indicated  ‘for weight loss in adults who are overweight (body mass index, BMI, 
≥25 kg/m2)  and  should  be  taken  in  conjunction  with  a  mildly  hypocaloric,  lower-fat  diet.’  and 
proposed  the  classification  for  supply  of  orlistat  60 mg  hard  capsules  to  ‘medicinal  product  not 
subject to medical prescription’. 
2.  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
alli is currently presented as 120 mg hard capsules in PVC/PE/PVDC blister packs and glass bottles 
of 21, 42 and 84 capsules. The applicant introduced a new strength of 60 mg hard capsules packaged 
in high-density polyethylene (HDPE ) bottles with a foil induction seal cap liner with polypropylene 
child resistant caps using a push down and turn opening mechanism. 
The composition of the additional strength of alli 60 mg capsules is essentially similar to the currently 
approved alli 120 mg capsules and has been well defined.

Drug Substance  
The applicant confirmed that no further changes were made in the documentation already submitted 
for the active substance (orlistat 120mg). The applicant has taken into account the quality information 
of active substance which has been assessed previously. In other words, the active substance used in 
this Line Extension, is identical to that used in the manufacture of the approved alli 120 mg capsule 
(EU/1/07/401/001-006) 
Drug Product  
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
to:  Formulation  development  (including 
The primary aim of the applicant was to develop an additional strength (60 mg) of orlistat for the use 
of the anti-obesity agent as a non-prescription medicine. As already mentioned that new dosage (60 
mg) is compositionally identical to alli 120 mg capsules : therefore, the quantitative compositions of 
the granulation and bulk pellet blend are the same for the two strengths. Additionally, a gelatin band 
is added in order to distinguish both strengths. It was agreed that the data from the basis of approval 
for alli 120 mg capsules was considered suitable to support the current 60 mg capsules application, in 
relation 
justification  for  excipient  selection  and 
composition);  Manufacturing  process  development  (including  identification  of  critical  processing 
steps,  process  scale-up  and  optimisation,  and  establishment  of  appropriate  process  controls); 
bioequivalence/pharmacological equivalence studies supporting the final formulation. In this context, 
it  was  agreed  that  no  changes  would be necessary to alli 60mg capsules, which will require further 
development activities. Therefore, the development was focussed on capsule banding and its effect on 
the  dissolution  profile.  It  is  important  to  underline  that  further  studies  confirmed  that  there  are  no 
significant differences between the dissolution profiles for the banded and unbanded capsules of alli 
60  mg.  Furthermore,  it  was  demonstrated  that  there  are  no  significant  differences  between  the 
dissolution profiles of both strengths (60 mg & 120 mg).  
•  Adventitious Agents 
Neither the excipients nor the active substance is derived from human or animal origin. Certificates of 
Suitability have been provided for the gelatine capsule which is of ruminant origin. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
This manufacturing process is based upon the manufacturing process already authorised for alli 120 
mg.  Therefore,  it  involves  standard  technology  using  standard  manufacturing  processes  such  as 
blending,  wet  granulation,  drying,  sieving  and  blending,  followed  by  encapsulation  in  hard  gelatin 
capsules,  and  finally  the  addition  of  gelatin  bands.  It  was  noticed  that  the  equipment  used  is 
commonly available in the pharmaceutical industry. The proposed commercial process was validated 
by a number of studies for the major critical steps of the manufacturing process. The batch analysis 
data show that these additional strengths can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed 
finished product specification, which is suitable for control of the capsules. 
•  Product Specification 
The proposed release and shelf life specifications provided contain the quality relevant characteristics 
required for this pharmaceutical form. Furthermore, the specifications were established according the 
ICH guidelines and include the following tests: appearance, assay, identity test (HPLC/IR), impurities 
(HPLC), uniformity of dosage units, dissolution, microbial quality (Ph Eur). 
Following a length discussion it was agreed that the specifications for the proposed product would be 
identical to the already authorised strength product. 
3
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All  analytical  procedures  that  were  used  for  testing  the  drug  product  were  properly  described. 
Moreover,  all  relevant  methods  were  satisfactorily  validated  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ICH 
guidelines.  
The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly 
according the agreed finished product specifications. 
•  Stability of the Product 
The stability studies were conducted according to the relevant ICH guidelines. 9 batches of product 
stored  in  the  proposed  marketing  containers  (with  desiccant)  for  periods  up  to  36  months  at 
25°C/60%RH,  30°C  60%RH.,  30°C  /65%RH  and  40°C  /75%RH.  It  is  important  to  underline  that 
Orlistat  has  poor  chemical  stability  at  40°C  due  to  a  low  melting  range  (42  -  44°C)  of  the  active 
substance.  
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf life as stated in the SPC is acceptable. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  active  substances’  manufacture  and  control  is  essentially  the  same  as  that  reviewed  for  the 
already authorised strength.  
The development of the formulation and manufacturing process for the finished product is essentially 
the  same  and  has  been  performed  with  a  view  to  the  main  variables  that  could  compromise  the 
efficacy and safety of the product. The information presented indicates consistency and uniformity of 
the finished product.  
3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Substantial pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological data for orlistat and its metabolites 
have previously been reported for orlistat 120 mg capsules (Xenical). Based on this available data and 
established  clinical  experience  with  orlistat  120 mg  capsules  (Xenical),  the  pharmacological, 
toxicological and safety-in-use profile of orlistat, when used as recommended, is well characterised.   
No additional non-clinical testing has been undertaken.  
A  revised  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  has  been  submitted  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP 
guidance  for 
the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use 
[EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, June 2006]. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The ERA indicated that the proposed use of orlistat 60mg will result in an increased environmental 
exposure in the EU from 29.4 Metric tons of orlistat to 57 Metric tons which is effectively a doubling 
of  the  environmental  exposure  to  orlistat.  This,  however,  is  a  worst  case  estimate  because  the 
applicant expects there to be a reduction in the sales of the prescription product following the launch 
of orlistat 60 mg.  
The increased exposure will mainly affect the terrestrial compartment, and any effects in the aquatic 
compartment would be marginal. Available data (e.g. tests conducted on earthworms and soil micro-
organisms) have indicated that ecotoxicity in the terrestrial compartment is unlikely to be a concern 
however the applicant has initiated studies to further investigate potential effects in the terrestrial and 
aquatic compartment. 
4
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
the  available 
Since  orlistat  60 mg  and  orlistat  120 mg  capsules  are  dose  proportional, 
pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  data  with  orlistat  120 mg  capsules  (Xenical) 
are  supportive  of  the  lower  strength,  orlistat  60  mg.  On  the  basis  of  this  information,  the  CHMP 
considered acceptable that no additional non-clinical testing has been undertaken with orlistat 60 mg. 
With respect to the ERA, the CHMP considered that it has been adequately addressed. A number of 
studies  (OECD  218/219,  OECD  307  and  OECD  210)  are  expected  to  be  submitted  as  part  of  a 
follow–up-measure. 
4.  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
This extension of the marketing authorisation concerns a new strength, orlistat 60 mg to be indicated 
in: 
‘alli is indicated for weight loss in adults who are overweight (body mass index, BMI, ≥25 kg/m2) and 
should be taken in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric, lower-fat diet.’ 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic data provided for orlistat 120 mg are supportive of orlistat 60 mg, the proposed 
new strength. Orlistat acts locally in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with minimal systemic absorption 
and  the  proportion  of  orlistat  that  is  absorbed,  and  its  metabolites,  are  subject  to  biliary  excretion.  
Due  to  its  minimal  systemic  absorption,  the  potential  for  systemic  adverse  reactions  and 
pharmacokinetic interactions with other medicines is limited. 
Pharmacodynamics 
No  new  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  performed  for  alli  60mg.  The  pharmacodynamic  data 
provided for orlistat 120 mg are supportive of orlistat 60 mg, the proposed new strength.  
Orlistat acts locally in the gastrointestinal tract inhibiting gastrointestinal lipases and has very limited 
systemic  pharmacodynamic  activity.    The  potential  for  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  is 
secondary to orlistat’s effect on lipid absorption so that there is a theoretical risk of reduction in the 
absorption of lipid soluble drugs and vitamins. 
Few  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  performed  but  the  study  by  Zhi  et  al  demonstrated  a 
statistically significant reduction in the AUC and Cmax of amiodarone. Other lipid soluble drugs with a 
low  therapeutic  index  may be affected to a clinically relevant extent (e.g with ciclosporin, warfarin 
and oral contraceptives).

Dose response studies 
A dose-response relationship was established for orlistat in study BM14150 (previously submitted for 
the original marketing authorisation application (MAA) for orlistat 120 mg) based on change in body 
weight.  Orlistat 60 mg (N=123) was the lowest dose tested that was statistically significant based on 
least  squares  mean  change  in  body  weight  (from  the  start  to  the  end  of  the  double-blind  treatment 
period at week 24).  The least squares mean difference from placebo was -1.86 kg for orlistat 60 mg 
(p=0.002) at the end of treatment.  The categorical analysis for subjects losing >10% of initial body 
weight showed a similar relationship to orlistat dose. 
Main clinical studies 
The pivotal studies from the original marketing authorisation application for orlistat 120 mg (studies 
BM14149 and NM14161) are supportive clinical data for orlistat 60 mg, the proposed new strength. 
These  studies  were  double-blind,  double-dummy,  randomised,  parallel-group,  placebo-controlled, 
multicentre studies and included a 60mg arm as well as the 120mg arm. The main objective of these 
studies  was  to  determine  the  weight  loss  effect  of  60 mg  orlistat,  120 mg  orlistat,  or  placebo 
administered  t.i.d  (three  times daily) in combination with a mildly hypocaloric diet, during the first 
year of treatment.  
Study  NM17247  was  a  multi-centre,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group 
study conducted in overweight patients with a BMI of ≥ 25 and < 28 kg/m2. The main objective of this 
study was to assess the efficacy of orlistat 60 mg tid plus diet as compared with placebo plus diet on 
change in the body weight over 16 weeks in subjects with BMI ≥25 to < 28 kg/m2 . 
alli  60mg  has  been  shown  to  increase  weight  loss  in  overweight  and  obese  subjects  compared  to 
placebo.  The weight loss increases with increased baseline BMI measurements such that the obese 
subject benefits more than the overweight or normal weight subject. 
Data  from  the  original  MAA  (studies  BM14149,  NM14161)  demonstrate  efficacy  of  the  60mg 
strength in subjects with a BMI of  ≥28 with 45% achieving a weight loss of ≥5% of baseline body 
weight and 21% achieving a weight loss of ≥10% of baseline body weight (compared to 29.3% and 
11.5% respectively in the placebo group).  This degree of weight loss is clinically relevant in regard to 
the risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 
There are, however, fewer data on the efficacy of the 60 mg dose in subjects with a BMI of 25 to 28.  
Only  four  months  data  in  this  population  have  been  submitted  in  the  present  application  (study 
NM17247) and over this time period only 13% of subjects in the orlistat group achieved a weight loss 
≥10% baseline body weight. Forty-four% achieved a weight loss of ≥5% of baseline body weight and 
67%  achieved  a  weight  loss  of  ≥3%.    Only  the  percentage  losing  ≥3%  baseline  body  weight  was 
statistically significantly greater than placebo and the clinical relevance of a 3% weight loss has not 
been clearly demonstrated (see Table 2).

While it may be appropriate to extrapolate from these results to 6 months or 12 months, the CHMP 
considered that it is not known if, in this population (BMI 25-28) the rate of weight loss will continue 
with  continued  treatment.    In  these  subjects  the  actual  weight  loss  was  small  (3-4.5  kg  over  3-4 
months) and only 1.15kg more than the placebo group on average but appeared to continue while the 
medication is taken and not to plateau after a short time.   
Clinical studies in special populations 
No  clinical  studies  have  been  performed  in  special  populations.  The  proposed  indication  for  alli 
60 mg does not include the use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Analysis performed across trials  
A pooled analysis of the data from the two pivotal studies of the original MAA were presented in the 
dossier.  This analysis demonstrated a similar efficacy of the 60mg orlistat to that seen with 120mg 
orlistat in patients with a BMI of ≥28 (see Figure 1).

ITT population, observed data; mean ± SE 
Based  on  the  pooled  analysis,  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  after  6 months  of  treatment 
was  -2.09 kg,  -4.40 kg  and  -5.18 kg  for  placebo,  60 mg  and  120 mg,  respectively  in  the  ITT 
population  (p<0.001  for  the  comparisons  with  placebo).    There  was  some  further  weight loss in all 
three  groups  over  the  next  6 months  of  treatment.    Adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  after 
12 months  of  treatment  was  -2.32 kg,  -4.78 kg  and  -5.56 kg  for  placebo,  60 mg  and  120 mg, 
respectively,  in  the  ITT  population  (p<0.001  for  the  comparisons  with  placebo).    Based  on  the 
comparison of the adjusted mean change from baseline for the 60 mg dose, 92% of the efficacy at 12 
months was achieved at the 6 month time-point.  
Supportive studies 
The  supportive  studies  include  studies  of  the  use  of  orlistat  in  the  real-life  situation  in  the  United 
States (US), ie behavioural studies NM17285 and RDH-ORL-002. 
•  NM17285 
In the actual use study NM17285, customers were invited to decide whether orlistat was appropriate 
for  them  with  very  little  input  from  the  pharmacist.    Fewer  than  50%  of  patients  with  excluded 
conditions  made  an  appropriate  selection  decision  based  on  the  product  information  alone  (see 
Table 3).

Eligible Subjects 
Table 4 showed the subjects who actually purchased and used the product.  Fewer than 50% made the 
appropriate decision to talk to a physician prior to using this product when they had a condition that 
would  possibly  exclude  them  from  using  the  product.    However  they  were  given  only  minimal 
guidance at the point of sale.  
Following the results of this study, some labelling changes were made by the applicant to ensure more 
appropriate self-selection and were considered acceptable by CHMP.  In addition, the labelling was 
further  amended  to  emphasise  key  safety  messages  at  the  CHMP’s  request.  A  positive  user-testing 
confirmed that the packaging and the leaflet for alli 60mg was both readable and easily understood.   
Weight loss according to baseline BMI 
Subjects with an initial BMI of <25 had a mean weight loss of 2 pounds, subjects with an initial BMI 
of 25-29.9 had a mean weight loss of approximately 5 pounds, and subjects with an initial BMI of ≥ 
30 had a mean weight loss of about 8 pounds. Measured weight loss according to different times of 
measurement are showed in Table 5.

Lifestyle changes 
An overwhelming majority of subjects (>90%), indicated that they were very successful or somewhat 
successful  in  maintaining  their  diet.  These  results  remained  consistent  at  every  interview  for  the 
duration of the study. 
At study completion, approximately 32% of subjects indicated that they exercised more than they did 
prior to study enrolment. 
•  RDH-ORL-002 
This study was an open, uncontrolled study based in shopping malls to determine the effect of 60mg 
orlistat plus diet administered for 4 weeks on weight change. 
In this simple study to investigate the use of orlistat in the real-life setting subjects achieved a mean 
weight loss of 8 lbs based on subjects’ diaries.  This study was conducted in subjects with a BMI ≥27. 
Withdrawal 
Regarding  the  possibility  of  rebound  weight  gain  following  withdrawal  of  orlistat  treatment,  two 
studies  conducted  with  orlistat  120mg  demonstrated  some  weight  gain  following  discontinuation  of 
therapy.  However these patients were allowed to take a eucaloric diet rather than being encouraged to 
continue  a  low  calorie  diet.    Importantly  the  results  did  not  demonstrate  a  ‘rebound’  weight  gain 
where  the  weight  rose  to  above  the  baseline  weight.    The  success  of  any  attempt  to  lose  weight  is 
dependent upon the consumer’s willingness to change lifestyle habits in the long term and orlistat is 
no different from other weight loss aids in this respect. In fact because of its mode of action orlistat 
encourages  a  change  to  less  fatty  foods  which may help consumers to maintain a healthier lifestyle 
after stopping treatment. 
In  the  placebo-controlled  studies  fewer  subjects  dropped  out  of  the  orlistat  groups  compared  to  the 
placebo groups and in the ‘real-life’ study NM17285, the majority of subjects successfully maintained 
their diet while 32% increased the amount of exercise they took while taking orlistat.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Orlistat 60mg tds taken with a hypocaloric diet has been shown to be effective in reducing weight to a 
greater extent than placebo in patients with a BMI ≥28.   
Results  from  previously  submitted  studies  BM14149  and  NM14161  demonstrated  efficacy  of  the 
60mg strength in subjects with a BMI of ≥28 with 45% achieving a weight loss of ≥5% of baseline 
body weight and 21% achieving a weight loss of ≥10% of baseline body weight (compared to 29.3% 
and  11.5%  respectively  in  the  placebo  group).    This  degree  of  weight  loss  is  clinically  relevant  in 
regard to the risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 
In real-life use the majority of patients taking orlistat 60 mg were able to adhere to the low-calorie, 
low-fat diet and a third of patients increased the amount of exercise taken.  
Although,  the  effect  size  was  modest  and  smaller  than  seen  with  the  currently  approved  dose  of 
120mg, evidence was presented that halving the dose of orlistat did not halve the efficacy; but that the 
efficacy  of  orlistat  60mg  was  85%  that  of  orlistat  120mg.  At  this  dose,  nearly  50%  of  patients 
achieved a weight loss of ≥5% of their baseline body weight and there is a body of evidence in the 
literature  that  demonstrates that this level of weight loss is beneficial to parameters of the common 
co-morbidities of obesity, such as hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia. The CHMP was 
therefore of the opinion that the effect size of orlistat 60 mg could be considered clinically relevant.  
The applicant was requested to provide further evidence of efficacy in the proposed target population 
(BMI 25-28) at the dose of 60mg tds. 
In  response,  the  Applicant  proposed  to  increase  the  lower  limit  for  BMI  from  25  to  28  kg/m2.  The 
CHMP therefore considered this point resolved provided the SPC restricts use to subjects with a BMI 
≥ 28 kg/m2. It is acknowledged that the guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products used 
in weight control recommends recruiting overweight subjects with risk factors. The inclusion criteria 
for  study  BM14149  only  specified  a  BMI  ≥  28  kg/m2  for  subjects  to  be  included  in  the  study  and 
therefore subjects without additional risk factors were studied. 
Further sensitivity analyses for studies BM14149 and NM14161 were provided. In study NM14161, 
the results for the 60mg dose remain significant in all the sensitivity analyses. In study BM14149, the 
results remained significant at 6 months but the baseline carried forward analysis was not significant 
for the 60mg dose at 12 months. Overall, however, these sensitivity analyses are reassuring and show 
clear evidence of efficacy at one year for the 60mg dose. The responder rates for the 60mg dose were 
very similar to the 120mg dose responder rates.  
Clinical safety 
Orlistat  120mg  has  been  on  the  market  since  1998  and  therefore  there  has  been  extensive  patient 
exposure.  The safety profile of orlistat is therefore well documented.  
The  following  studies  for  orlistat  120 mg  also  provide  safety  data  for  orlistat  60 mg:  BM14149; 
NM14161;  NM14302;  BM14150, and BM15421D (XENDOS).   Three additional studies have been 
undertaken  with  orlistat  60 mg  capsules  in  the  US  and  provide  further  safety  data  for  the  current 
application.

The pattern of AEs was generally similar for subjects treated with orlistat 60 mg in Study NM17247 
(BMI 25 to <28 kg/m2) and in the three long-term studies included in the pooled analysis 
(BMI ≥28 kg/m2), indicating that the AE profile of orlistat 60 mg is not influenced by BMI (for BMI 
of ≥25 kg/m2) (Table 7).

Serious adverse events and deaths 
In  study  NM17247,  2  subjects  receiving  orlistat  60 mg  t.i.d.  experienced  serious  adverse  events 
(SAEs)  in  this  study.    Both  events  (repair  of  umbilical  hernia,  intervertebral  disc  prolapse)  were 
considered unrelated to study medication.   
In  study  NM17285,  5  (1.8%)  of  the  284  safety  subjects  experienced  a  total  of  six  SAEs  during 
treatment with orlistat 60 mg in this uncontrolled study.  Four of these SAEs were considered to be 
unrelated to study drug by a study physician.  Two events were considered possibly related to study 
drug and these were abdominal pain and chest pain (secondary to oesophageal spasm).   
In  the  pooled  analysis  (BM14149,  NM14161  and  NM14302),  the  incidence  of  cholecystitis  and 
cholelithiasis  at 6 months and 1 year was low in  all three treatment groups of these studies with no 
evidence  of  increased  incidence  with  orlistat  treatment.    As  was  also  noted  in  the  XENDOS  study 
(placebo  vs  orlistat  120mg),  more  orlistat-treated  patient  had  cholelithiasis,  but  equal  numbers  of 
patients in both treatment groups had cholecystitis. 
Three deaths were reported in the pooled studies, one during the placebo lead-in (car accident; study 
NM14302), and two deaths from myocardial infarction (one on 60 mg t.i.d., Study BM14149, and one 
120 mg t.i.d., Study NM14161).  None was considered treatment related.  
Laboratory findings 
There is a possible trend towards increased elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alanine 
transaminase  (ALT)  with  orlistat  120mg  compared  to  placebo  but  this  was  not  seen  in  the  orlistat 
60mg group. 
In the 3 phase III studies, the frequency of two consecutive low levels of vitamins A, D, E and beta-
carotene during 1 year of treatment was low in all treatment groups.  For vitamin D and beta-carotene, 
there was a significantly lower frequency of two consecutive low vitamin levels with the 60 mg dose 
compared to the 120 mg dose.  
Psychiatric events 
From the clinical trial data the only psychiatric event that appeared to be associated with orlistat and 
that gives an apparent dose response was ‘anxiety’.  
Fracture risk 
The data from clinical trials did not suggest a decrease in bone mineral density associated with use of 
orlistat. 
Cancer risk 
Data  from  investigations  of  a  possible  association  between  orlistat  and  breast  cancer  or  colorectal 
cancer did not support a causal relationship between orlistat and breast cancer or colorectal cancer. 
Safety in special populations 
•  Elderly 
The discontinuation rates at 1 year among  the elderly population analysed (from 7 phase III studies 
previously submitted in the original MAA) were 13.3% and 12.9% for the 60 mg and 120 mg doses 
respectively;  these  were  lower  than  in  the  placebo  group  (26.2%).  There  was  no  unusual  or 
unexpected  pattern  of  SAEs  in  this  elderly  population,  and  specifically,  the  overall  incidence  of 
gastrointestinal AEs was similar to that seen in the general population.   
14
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Similarly,  summary  statistics  of  laboratory  changes  over  time  revealed  few  differences between the 
elderly  and  general  populations.    Any  changes  were  small  and  did  not  appear  to  be  clinically 
meaningful.   
Vitamin  D  deficiency  and  the  concomitant  use  of  orlistat  in  the  elderly  is  considered  as  a  risk  of 
osteoporosis,  given  that  vitamin  D  deficiency  may  contributing  factor.  However,  there  was  no 
evidence  of  an  increased  risk  of  bone  fractures  from  post-marketing  data.  The  advice  to consumers 
using orlistat 60 mg to take a multivitamin supplement containing vitamins A, D, E and K may thus 
be considered sufficient to address this concern. 
•  Under age consumers, those of normal weight and those with eating disorders 
Orlistat has been studied in a limited number of adolescent subjects. However; orlistat 60 mg is not 
proposed to be indicated for use in subjects under 18 years of age.  
•  Hepatic and renal impairment 
There are no data on the use of orlistat in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Due to the very 
limited  absorption  of  orlistat  such  impairment  is  unlikely  to  cause  an  increase  in  plasma 
concentrations of orlistat and cholestasis is a contraindication due to the biliary route of excretion.   
•  Pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy and breast feeding are contraindications to the use of orlistat 60 mg. 
Immunological events 
Orlistat is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to orlistat. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Due  to  the  low  systemic  absorption  of  orlistat  few  drug-drug  interactions  have  been  observed.  
However  the  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  orlistat  on  the  absorption  of  fats  may  interfere  with  the 
absorption of lipid-soluble drugs.  
• 
Fat-soluble vitamins 
The  results  of  measurements  of  vitamin  levels  in  clinical  trials  of  orlistat  showed  a  small  but 
statistically  significant  decrease  in  levels  of  vitamins  D  and  E  and  betacarotene.    However  despite 
these  decreases,  levels  of  these  vitamins  remained  within  the  normal  range  even  after  one  year’s 
treatment. It is proposed to include include advice to consumers that a daily multivitamin supplement 
should be taken while taking orlistat in the product information. 
• 
Warfarin 
A study in patients taking warfarin was conducted by the applicant in the US to ascertain if they could 
safely self-select the product without professional advice. A total of 54 warfarin users participated in 
the study. Overall, 39 of the 54 participants (72%) appropriately self-selected based on their condition 
(taking  warfarin)  by expressing an intent to contact a doctor before use.  Encouragingly, more than 
97%  of  warfarin  users  indicated  that  they  discussed  their  concomitant  medications  with  their 
physicians,  and  91%  said  that  their  international  normalised  ratio  (INR)  levels  were  monitored 
routinely. However, in order to enhance compliance with this statement even further, the prominence 
of the warning on the US pack label was increased. 
In 6 months post-marketing experience with the non prescription product in the US there was one case 
of a probable interaction between orlistat and warfarin in which the consumer reported that her blood 
was ‘too thin’ and that she had been advised by her physician to discontinue orlistat. 
15
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Ciclosporin 
Concomitant use of ciclosporin and orlistat is contraindicated.  Following amendments to the US label 
to  include  distinct  warning  statements  to  target  (a)  organ  transplant  recipients  and  (b)  consumers 
using  ciclosporin  for  other  indication  the  label  was  tested  in  a  self-selection  study.  The  study 
population was 60 subjects who were 1) organ transplant recipients currently using cyclosporine, and 
2)  also  interested  in  losing  weight.    The  majority  (98.3%)  of  subjects  made  a  correct  selection 
decision  and  indicated  that  the  highlighted  organ  transplant  alert  was  very  clear  and  easy  to 
understand. The one subject who made an incorrect selection decision stated that he would not use, 
non prescription orlistat until he received approval from his physician. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
The  incidence  of  withdrawals  due  to  adverse  events  was  generally  low  and  mainly  related  to 
gastrointestinal  adverse  effects.    In  the  longer  term  studies,  the  incidence  of  withdrawal  during  the 
second  six  months  of  treatment  was  lower  than  the  incidence  of  withdrawal  during  the  first  six 
months.   
The incidence of AEs leading to withdrawal during the first 6 months of treatment was greater for the 
orlistat  treatment  groups  compared  with  placebo  but  less  for  the  60 mg  dose  compared  with  the 
120 mg  dose  (2.1%  placebo;  4.8%  for  orlistat  60 mg;  7.3%  for  orlistat  120 mg).    GI  AEs  were  the 
most frequent event leading to withdrawal (0.8% placebo; 3.2% orlistat 60 mg; 5.4% orlistat 120 mg).   
The incidence of serious AEs during the first 6 months of treatment was similar across the treatment 
groups (3.5% placebo; 3.4% orlistat 60 mg; 3.5% orlistat 120 mg). 
From a safety perspective, the choice of orlistat 60 mg, rather than 120 mg, for non-prescription use, 
is appropriate based on consideration of the withdrawal rates and the overall incidence of GI events.   
Post marketing experience 
Using  worldwide  sales  data,  cumulative  patient  exposure  of  orlistat  120 mg  from  first  launch  is 
approximately 6.37 million patient years.  Up to 30 April 2007, 6,396 spontaneous reports associated 
with  orlistat 120 mg from Healthcare Professionals and serious, unblinded, attributable clinical trial 
cases  describing  a  total  of  12,498  adverse  events  have  been  received.    The  majority  of  the  events, 
78%, were non-serious according to regulatory criteria. The majority of events reported were in the 
Gastrointestinal  Disorders  System  Organ  Class  (SOC)  (33.4%),  the  Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Tissues 
Disorders SOC (10.5%), the General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions SOC (9.6%) and 
the Nervous Systems Disorders SOC (8.0%).  The majority of the events resolved.  The safety profile, 
as assessed from the 12,498 events, is similar to that seen in the clinical studies. 
Additionally,  data  were  available  from  two  post-marketing  studies  conducted  in  the  UK  [Acharya, 
2006] and Germany [Wirth,2005]. Overall both studies demonstrated that orlistat was generally well 
tolerated and that the safety profile remains unchanged. In both studies, gastrointestinal events were 
the most frequently reported adverse events. 
The US post-marketing experience of the orlistat 60 mg (used as a non prescription product) has also 
been  provided  from  07  February  2007  to  06  November  2007.    The  safety  data  since  the  data  lock 
point of the submitted report including the review  of the individual adverse event cases received to 
date, monthly aggregate data review and routine literature searching has not identified any significant 
new information or safety concerns.

Discussion on clinical safety 
In  terms  of  safety,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  profile  of  orlistat  60  mg  does  not  raise  major 
concerns,  given  the  cumulative  safety  experience  (over  9  years)  of  orlistat  120  mg,  and  the 
usage/postmarketing experience of orlistat 60 mg in the US.  
The  dose  of  60mg  of  orlistat  causes  milder  gastrointestinal  adverse  effects  than  120mg  and  this 
resulted in many fewer withdrawals due to adverse events in the pivotal studies conducted on orlistat 
60mg and 120mg. 
Nevertheless,  the  CHMP  had  some  concerns  over the reporting of anxiety during clinical trials, the 
potential  impairment  of  fat  soluble  vitamins  (A,D,E  and  K)  absorption  and  the  reported  unwanted 
pregnancies  in  patients  taking  oral  contraceptive  pills  (OCP).  Consequently,  addition  of  the  term 
‘anxiety’  as  an  adverse  reaction  as  well  recommendation  for  vitamin  intake  and  use  of  additional 
contraceptive  method  in  case  of  severe  diarrhoea  were  included  in  the  product  information  and 
accepted by CHMP.  
Another concern was the results of the self selection study performed in patients taking warfarin. 
Concomitant  use  of  orlistat  and  anti-coagulants  such  as  warfarin  can  lead  to  unbalanced  INR 
measurements which may lead to reports of bleeding. Following the results of the study and one US 
reported case of warfarin interaction, the CHMP recommended to contraindicate the use of warfarin 
and other oral anticoagulants with orlistat 60 mg, intended to be used in the non prescription setting. 
Having  considered  the  introduction  of  this  new  strength  (orlistat  60  mg)  intended  to be used in the 
non prescription setting, the CHMP also recommended the restart of the PSUR cycle of the product as 
follows: 6 monthly PSURs for one year after the Commission Decision on this extension application 
then yearly for 2 years and every three years thereafter.

Legal Status 
According  to  the  European  Commission  guideline  on  ‘Changing  the  classification  for  supply  of 
medicinal product for human use’ (January 2006), the applicant proposed the classification for supply 
of alli 60 mg to ‘medicinal product not subject to medical prescription’. The applicant considers that 
the criteria for medical prescription under article 71 of the Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, are not 
met.  
However, the CHMP had further concerns related to the proposed legal status for alli 60 mg which 
were addressed by the MAH during an oral explanation held on 23 September 2008, as follows: 
First  criterion  for  medical  prescription  under  article  71  of  the  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as 
amended – “Medicinal products shall be subject to medical prescription when they are likely to 
present  a  danger  either  directly  or  indirectly,  even  when  used  correctly,  if  utilised  without 
medical prescription.” 
1)  Increased  risk  that  patients  may  not  have  their  underlying  co-morbid  conditions  identified 
(usually co-existing with obesity), thus delaying the diagnosis and definitive treatment of any 
underlying conditions 
Results from Consumer surveys conducted in the EU [GSK, TNS Market Research, 2008] and in the 
US [GSK, ACNielsen and Synovate, 2008] were presented to CHMP. 
The  EU  survey  was  to  characterise  the  usual  habits  of  overweight  and  obese  people  in  eight  EU 
markets  and  demonstrated  that  there  was  a  high  rate  of  patient/physician  interaction  in  this 
population.  The majority of overweight patients (83%) had had their blood pressure checked in the 
preceding 12 months and 44% had had a test for diabetes.  
Further data following the launch of alli 60 mg as a non-prescription medicine in the US demonstrated 
that patient/physician interaction and physicians’ prescribing of weight-loss medicines had not been 
adversely affected by the wider availability of alli. 
Finally,  the  applicant  proposed  strengthening  the  information  on  the  labelling  and  Package  Leaflet 
including  simple  and  clear  guidance  to  potential  purchasers  about  the  consequences  of  being 
overweight and directing them to see their doctor for a general health check so that co-morbidities can 
be assessed and managed appropriately avoiding a delay in the detection and treatment of co-morbid 
conditions.    Patients  with  existing  co-morbidities  are  also  encouraged  to  consult  their  physicians 
during the use of orlistat so that control of co-morbidities can be maintained. 
2)  Potential for incorrect use of the product, as the patient can use the product where it is not 
indicated, uses it for a longer period than recommended or exceeds the recommended dose 
(specifically, on the use of orlistat by underage adolescents and children or by patients with 
eating disorders) 
Data  from  12  month  experience  in  the  US  of  alli  60  mg  as  a  non-prescription  medicine  were 
presented. These showed that actual incorrect use of alli in the US was limited, with the majority of 
consumers using the product correctly and appropriately. 
Adverse  event  reports  supported  the  conclusion  that  the  incidence  of  misuse  was  small  and  the 
adverse events that have been reported in inappropriate patient populations followed the known safety 
profile of the product, i.e., the vast majority were gastrointestinal, and have not resulted in any serious 
consequences. 
The applicant also indicated that the majority of patients used alli 60 mg for ≤6 months although a 
maximum duration of use is not stated in the US labelling.

Having considered the data submitted by the applicant and the criteria for medical prescription under 
article 71 of the Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, the CHMP recommended the classification of alli 
60 mg to ‘medicinal product not subject to medical prescription’. 
7.  Data exclusivity 
The Applicant provided additional clinical studies (studies NM17247 and NM17285, an ‘actual use’ 
study)  and  Consumer  Surveys  conducted  in  the  US  [GSK, ACNielsen and  Synovate, 2008] and the 
EU [GSK, TNS Market Research , 2008] in support of this application and claimed a one-year data 
exclusivity  on  these  data.  The  CHMP  reviewed  the  clinical  data  submitted,  taking  into  account  the 
provisions of Article 74a of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, in support of the classification of alli 
60 mg hard capsules as ‘medicinal product not subject to medical prescription’.  
Whereas : 
-  The  Consumer  Surveys  conducted  in  the  US  [GSK,  ACNielsen  and  Synovate,  2008]  and  the  EU 
[GSK,  TNS  Market  Research  ,  2008]  are  not  eligible  for  the  one-year  data  exclusivity,  taking  into 
account the provisions of Article 74a of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended; 
-  Taking  into  account  the  European  Commission  guideline  on  ‘Changing  the  classification  for  the 
supply  of  a  medicinal  product  for  human  use’,  the  CHMP  considered  that  studies  NM17247  and 
NM17285 were not relevant and necessary for demonstrating efficacy of orlistat 60 mg , nor did they 
give  more  insight  into  the  safety  of  orlistat  60  mg,  due  to  the  design  of  the  studies.  The  Applicant 
committed to conduct two surveys to assess demographic and clinical characteristics of alli users in 
the  EU  (first  survey)  and  also  the  usage  patterns  in  the  EU  (second  survey).  These  measures  will 
provide further data on how orlistat 60 mg will be used in the EU in order to ensure its appropriate 
safe and effective use in a non-prescription setting; 
- The original clinical data available at the time of the initial marketing authorisation for the product 
confirmed  that  the  reduced  strength  retains  the  efficacy  (BM14149  and  NM14161)  with  fewer  and 
less severe undesirable effects observed.  The data that have become available (from clinical trials and 
post-marketing  experience  of  orlistat  120  mg  and  60  mg  in  the  US)  on  the  safety  and  use  of  the 
product  since  its  marketing  authorisation    also  provided  further  reassurance  of  the  overall  safety 
profile.  The CHMP therefore considered that there is no need to generate new safety/efficacy data to 
support  the  classification  of  alli  60  mg  hard  capsules  as  ‘medicinal  product  not  subject  to  medical 
prescription’.; 
The CHMP concluded that studies  NM17247 and NM17285 submitted by the Applicant for which 
the claim for one year data exclusivity is sought, were not relevant and necessary to the classification 
of alli 60 mg hard capsules as ‘medicinal product not subject to medical prescription’.

8.  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the 
conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance  of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way.  At  the 
time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  is  one  minor  unresolved  quality  issue,  which  does  not  have  any 
impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the medicinal product. This will be addressed as part of the follow-
up measures to be addressed post-authorisation. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Since  orlistat  60 mg  and  orlistat  120 mg  capsules  are  dose  proportional, 
the  available 
pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  data  with  orlistat  120 mg  capsules  (Xenical) 
are  supportive  of  the  lower  strength,  orlistat  60  mg.  On  the  basis  of  this  information,  the  CHMP 
considered acceptable that no additional non-clinical testing has been undertaken with orlistat 60 mg. 
With respect to the ERA, the CHMP considered that it has been adequately addressed. A number of 
studies  (OECD  218/219,  OECD  307  and  OECD  210)  are  expected  to  be  submitted  as  part  of  a 
follow–up-measure. 
Efficacy 
The clinical data provided by the applicant are considered clinically relevant and sufficient to support 
the  extension  of  the  marketing  authorisation  to  add  the  new  lower  strength,  orlistat  60  mg  in  the 
following indication: ‘alli is indicated for weight loss in adults who are overweight (body mass index, 
BMI, ≥28 kg/m2) and should be taken in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric, lower-fat diet.’  
Safety 
The safety profile of orlistat 60 mg, new lower strength, is better than that of the currently approved 
strength, orlistat 120 mg. The dose of 60mg of orlistat causes milder gastrointestinal adverse effects 
than 120mg and this resulted in many fewer withdrawals due to adverse events in the pivotal studies 
conducted on orlistat 60mg and 120mg. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having  considered  the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the 
proposed activities described in section 5 adequately addressed these. 
•  User consultation 
The results of the readability test of the package leaflet were considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
The risk-benefit remains favourable under the proposed conditions of use of the medicinal product. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131)  routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
(cid:131)  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.

Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority 
decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  alli  60  mg  indicated  for  ‘weight  loss  in  adults  who  are 
overweight  (body  mass  index,  BMI,  ≥28 kg/m2)  and  should  be  taken  in  conjunction  with  a  mildly 
hypocaloric,  lower-fat  diet.’,  as  a  medicinal  product  not  subject  to  medical  prescription,  was 
favourable and therefore recommended the extension of the marketing authorisation. 
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  clinical  data  (studies  NM17247  and  NM17285,  EU  and  US 
surveys)  submitted  by  the  applicant  taking  into  account  the  provisions  of  Article  74a  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC, as amended, and did not consider that the data submitted in support of the classification 
of the medicinal product, alli for the new lower strength 60 mg were significant.

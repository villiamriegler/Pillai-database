are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

efficacy, including all variations introduced since the 
granting of the initial marketing authorisation, the CHMP 
considered that the benefit-risk balance of Conbriza in the

authorised indications remains favourable and therefore 
recommended the renewal of the marketing authorisation, 
subject to the conditions as laid down in Annex II to the 
Opinion.  
The CHMP considered that the Marketing Authorisation 
could be granted with unlimited validity.  
The CHMP recommended amendments to the Annexes I, II

SmPC, Annex 
The efficacy and safety data supporting the marketing 
sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 with relevant safety and 
II, Labelling 
authorisation for bazedoxifene were based on the 
efficacy data obtained following 7 years of treatment 
and PL 
multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo  and 
with bazedoxifene in extension II to Study 3068A1-
301-WW. In addition, upon request by the CHMP 
following the assessment of PSUR 4, the MAH 
proposes the addition of wording in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC to include the incidences of thyroid cancer and 
raloxifene controlled, Phase 3 study 3068A1-300 GL in 
postmenopausal women for the prevention of osteoporosis 
and the 36 month, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo  and raloxifene controlled, Phase 3 study 3068A1-
301 WW in older, postmenopausal women for the 
Conbriza

ovarian cancer observed in Study 3068A1-301-WW, 
and the update of sections 4.7 and 4.8 of the SmPC 
to include information on the ocular adverse events 
reported and advice regarding the effects of these 
events on the ability to drive. The Package Leaflet 
has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH 
has taken the opportunity to update the annexes in 
line with the latest QRD template, version 8, and to 
update the list of local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
treatment of osteoporosis. The 3 year Core study of 301 
WW (CSR 39808) was extended by two 2 year double-
blind, placebo-controlled study extensions (Extensions I 
and II) to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of 
bazedoxifene in the reduction in fracture incidence in 
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Extension I was 
a 2-year extension from the end of Year 3 until the end of 
Year 5 (Month 60); the results of the 5-year period of the 
Core study and Extension I were presented in CSR-74587. 
Extension II was the second 2-year extension, from the end 
of Year 5 until the end of Year 7 (Month 84); the efficacy 
and safety data for the 7 year period of the Core study and 
Extensions I and II are presented within this variation 
application (CSR-81179).  
A total of 1,732 subjects continued into the second 2-year 
extension (bazedoxifene 20 mg: n=560, bazedoxifene 
40/20 mg: n=582, and placebo: n=590). 
After 7 years of treatment, the incidence of new vertebral 
fractures remained lower in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group 
(7.64%) compared to placebo (9.90%) with a relative risk 
reduction of 30% (p=0.022). The increases in BMD (bone 
density) relative to placebo remained statistically significant 
at the femoral neck, femoral trochanter, and total hip.  The 
increase from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at 7 years in 
the bazedoxifene 20 mg group was not statistically greater 
than in the placebo group. 
After 7 years the rate of VTE (deep vein thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism and retinal vein thrombosis) per 
1,000 women-years was 2.06 in the bazedoxifene 20 mg 
group and 1.36 in the placebo group (relative risk 1.51). 
The rate per 1,000 women-years for ischaemic strokes was 
the same for the 20 mg bazedoxifene (1.78) and the 
Conbriza  
EMA/172882/2021 
Page 8/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
placebo (1.78) groups.  The rate per 1,000 women years 
for TIA was higher for the bazedoxifene 20 mg group 
(0.96) compared to placebo (0.55). 
With reference to effects on the uterus, after 7 years of 
treatment, the endometrial thickness in the bazedoxifene 
20 mg group did not change and remained similar to 
placebo; there were no cases of endometrial cancer in the 
bazedoxifene 20 mg group compared to 7 cases in the 
placebo group (p<0.008).   
In the osteoporosis treatment study in 7,492 
postmenopausal women (mean age, 66 years), among 
1,886 subjects treated with bazedoxifene (20 mg), there 
were 5 cases of thyroid cancer (0.69 per 1,000) and among 
1,885 subjects treated with placebo, there was 1 case of 
thyroid cancer (0.14 per 1,000) after 7 years of treatment.  
There were no cases of thyroid cancer in the 40 mg 
treatment group up to 5 years. Further, there were 5 cases 
of ovarian cancer (0.69 per 1,000) and among 1,885 
subjects treated with placebo, there were 0 cases of 
ovarian cancer after 7 years of treatment.  There was one 
case of ovarian cancer in the 40 mg treatment group up to 
5 years. After 7 years of treatment, there were 13 cases of 
breast cancer in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group (1.78 per 
1,000 women-years) and 11 cases in the placebo group 
(1.50 per 1,000 women-years). 
There have been post-marketing reports of ocular events 
other than retinal vein thrombosis.  These reports include 
visual acuity reduced, blurred vision, photopsia, visual field 
defect, visual impairment, dry eye, eyelid oedema, 
blepharospasm, eye pain and eye swelling.  The underlying 
nature of these events is uncertain.  If ocular symptoms 
occur, patients should be advised to seek medical attention 
Conbriza  
EMA/172882/2021 
Page 9/14 
 
 
 
 
and should avoid driving or use of machines that requires 
accurate visual perception until symptoms have resolved, 
or until they have received medical advice that it safe to do 
so.

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
the PI to include information regarding the concomitant 
administration of Apexxnar with a seasonal quadrivalent 
influenza vaccine, adjuvanted (QIV).  
Apexxnar may be administered concomitantly with seasonal 
influenza vaccine (QIV; surface antigen, inactivated, 
adjuvanted). In subjects with underlying conditions 
associated with a high risk of developing life-threatening 
pneumococcal disease, consideration may be given to 
separating administrations of QIV and Apexxnar (e.g. by

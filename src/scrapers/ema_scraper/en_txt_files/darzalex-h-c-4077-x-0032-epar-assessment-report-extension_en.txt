2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Darzalex (daratumumab) administered intravenously is approved in the European Union for the 
treatment of patients with multiple myeloma as a 20 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion.  
This application concerns a line extension application for a 120 mg/mL liquid for subcutaneous (SC) 
injection (new pharmaceutical form, strength and route of administration) of daratumumab introducing 
the addition of recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) at the drug substance level.  
Assessment report

Daratumumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody expressed by genetically engineered Chinese 
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. It binds CD38 on multiple myeloma cells with high affinity and specificity, 
and it harbours several effector functions including CDC and ADCC. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH applied for all previously authorized indications for Darzalex as mentioned above. No new 
indication is being requested in this application. DARZALEX is indicated: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or with bortezomib, melphalan and 
prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are 
ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant. 
in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult 
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are eligible for autologous stem cell 
transplant. 
in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the 
treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. 
as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, 
whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who 
have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Multiple myeloma is estimated to represent 0.9% of all cancers worldwide (Bray 2018). The incidence of 
multiple myeloma increases steadily with age, with a median age at diagnosis of approximately 65 to 72 
years (Howlader 2017; Merz 2017; Song 2016). The annual number of new cases of multiple myeloma 
diagnosed is estimated to be approximately 48,297 in Europe (IARC/WHO 2018). The estimated world-
wide 5-year prevalence is approximately 230,000 patients (Ruzafa 2016). Major strides have been made 
in  the  treatment  of  multiple  myeloma  in  the  last  decade.  Despite  the  availability  of  new  therapies, 
106,105 deaths were estimated worldwide due to multiple myeloma in 2018 (Bray 2018), and annually, 
approximately 24,300 deaths are estimated in Europe (Ferlay 2015). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features-Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Multiple Myeloma is a malignant disorder, characterized by uncontrolled and progressive proliferation 
of a plasma cell, resulting in an overabundance of monoclonal paraprotein (IgG, IgA, IgD or IgE) or 
Bence-Jones protein (monoclonal K or h light chains), destruction of bone, an impaired production of 
normal immunoglobulins and displacement of normal bone marrow hematopoietic precursors. The 
cause of the myeloma cell’s failure to differentiate is unknown, chromosomal changes, such as 
translocations of chromosome 14q32, deletions (chromosome 13q, 17p) and deregulation of 
oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes such as the c-my oncogene play a role, as well as 
environmental changes in the bone marrow. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis prognosis 
Characteristic hallmarks of multiple myeloma include osteolytic lesions, fractures, vertebral collapse 
and pain, anemia, recurrent or persistent infections, hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency or failure, and 
Assessment report

in some patients, hyperviscosity syndromes, clotting abnormalities and neurological complications.  
Approximately 20% of patients are symptom free and diagnosed by chance (Desikan, 2000). 
The disease is characterized by multiple relapses, with each successive relapse, the chance of response 
and duration of response typically decreases resulting in resistant disease, progressive morbidity and 
eventual mortality. The prognosis depends on a variety of factors including cytogenetics, age and stage 
of MM at time of diagnosis. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Treatment  options  in  Multiple  Myeloma  are  dependent  on  age,  performance  status,  comorbidity, 
suitability for intensive treatment as well as aggressiveness of the disease. Progress has been made over 
the last 15 years in the treatment of multiple myeloma, the survival of patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma has increased from approximately 3 years with no improvement from the years 1985 
to 1998 (Kyle 2003) to 6 to 10 years today (Moreau 2015). The improvement in prognosis is primarily 
attributable to the adoption of high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation 
(ASCT)  and  the  introduction  of  proteasome  inhibitors  (PIs)  and  immunomodulatory  agents  (IMiDs)  in 
the last decade. While newer approved medications (pomalidomide and carfilzomib) have provided some 
additional options for relapsed patients, both are modifications of existing agents in the same class (IMiD 
and PI, respectively). Lately, monoclonal antibodies like daratumumab IV and elotumumab IV have been 
introduced.  
Despite these advances, multiple myeloma remains incurable. After relapse from PIs and IMiDs, patients 
are often retreated with drugs that have the same mechanism of action. Ultimately, the disease becomes 
refractory. Patients who are heavily pretreated and/or refractory to both a PI and IMiD have a dismal 
prognosis, they are difficult to get back into a durable remission, and median survival is only between 8 
to 9 months (Kumar 2012; Usmani 2015, Verelst 2015). For patients who are refractory to at least 3 of 
the  common  PIs  and  IMiDs  (bortezomib,  lenalidomide,  carfilzomib,  or  pomalidomide),  the  median 
survival  decreased  to  only  5  months.  Especially  the  treatment  option  for  the  majority  of  the  MM 
population, i.e., the more fragile and elderly patients, is overall associated with low response rate and 
short survival. (Smith 2005, 2001, Palumbo 2006). 
Therefore, besides from novel therapeutic strategies to improve and deepen ORR, treatment modalities 
minimising the toxicities and treatment duration that are associated with current treatment options are 
needed.   
About the product 
Daratumumab is a targeted immunotherapy that binds with high affinity to tumor cells that overexpress 
CD38,  a  transmembrane  glycoprotein.  Multiple  mechanisms  of  action  have  been  described. 
Daratumumab IV received marketing authorization in the EU in May 2016 and is now approved in many 
countries  worldwide  for  the  treatment  of  multiple  myeloma.  Based  on  the  cumulative  total  of 
915,039,200  mg  of  daratumumab  distributed  from  launch  (cumulative  to  31  October  2018),  the 
estimated  cumulative  exposure  to  daratumumab  IV  in  marketed  use  is  34,316  person-years. 
Daratumumab administered IV (DARZALEX) has been well-tolerated with manageable side effects, the 
most common side effect associated with daratumumab is infusion-related reactions (IRRs), which are 
experienced  by  approximately  half  of  subjects  receiving  daratumumab  IV-based  regimens,  with  most 
(>90%) IRRs occurring during the first infusion. To minimize the risk of IRRs, the IV infusion requires a 
large  infusion  volume  (500  to  1000  mL)  with  an  infusion  rate  of  approximately  7  hours  for  the  first 
infusion, and subsequent infusions of 3 to 4 hours.

The  MAH  has  developed  a  subcutaneous  (SC)  formulation  containing  1800  mg  daratumumab  (120 
mg/mL) co-formulated with 30,000 U recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20; 2000 U/mL) 
in a single vial (hereafter referred to as daratumumab SC). The SC formulation is given as a flat dose 
(1800 mg), injected into the SC tissue of the abdomen over approximately 3 to 5 minutes. The rHuPH20 
used in the daratumumab SC formulation is the same as that approved in combination with other protein 
therapeutics  for  SC  administration  HyQvia,  Rituxan  Hycela,  Herceptin  Hylecta  in  the  US;  HyQvia, 
Herceptin SC, and MabThera SC in the European Union [EU]) and in the commercial product Hylenex 
recombinant (hyaluronidase human injection) approved in the US.  
The goal in developing daratumumab SC was to demonstrate comparable efficacy and safety to the 
existing IV formulation but providing faster administration and lower rates of IRRs and to extrapolate 
the extensive data already generated for daratumumab IV to the new SC formulation. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This  submission  provides  data  supporting  the  approval  of  a  subcutaneous  (SC)  formulation  of 
daratumumab  (daratumumab  SC),  a  co-formulated  drug  product  containing  daratumumab  and 
recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) in a single vial. Daratumumab SC is given as a flat 
dose  (1800  mg),  injected  into  the  SC  tissue  of  the  abdomen  over  approximately  3  to  5 minutes. 
Hyaluronidase increases permeability of the SC tissue by depolymerizing hyaluronan. rHuPH20 increases 
the tissue dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs and fluids by acting locally and transiently 
within the SC space. 
In  support  of  the  non-clinical  part  of  this  application  the  results  of  the  nonclinical  program  for 
daratumumab,  as  submitted  in  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  for  DARZALEX,  can  be 
applied to daratumumab SC. In addition, the nonclinical program for rHuPH20, submitted in support of 
line  extensions  procedures  for  MabThera  and  Herceptin®  are  provided  and  can  also  be  applied  to 
daratumumab SC. Emphasis is placed on the assessment of Non-clinical studies of the combination of 
dara-rHuPH20  which  are  also  being  submitted.  Clinical  data  submitted  are  derived  from  4 studies  in 
subjects treated with daratumumab as an 1800 mg flat dose (co-formulated with rHuPH20) and injected 
SC into the abdomen. Quality aspects of the product development are also being assessed  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Darzalex is currently authorised as a 20 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion in 5 mL and 20 mL 
glass vials containing 100 mg and 400 mg of daratumumab, respectively. It is formulated with glacial 
acetic  acid,  mannitol,  polysorbate  20,  sodium  acetate  trihydrate,  sodium  chloride  and  water  for 
injections. 
The scope of this application is the introduction of a new dosage form: 1800 mg solution for subcutaneous 
(SC)  injection  in  a  15  mL  single-use  vial  (120  mg  daratumumab  per  mL).  It  is  formulated  with 
recombinant  human  hyaluronidase  enzyme  (rHuPH20),  L-histidine,  L-histidine  hydrochloride 
monohydrate, sorbitol, L-methionine, polysorbate 20 and water for injections. RHuPH20 acts as a skin 
permeation  enhancer  that  facilitates  SC  delivery.  It  is  produced  in  genetically  engineered  CHO  cells. 
Detailed information on the manufacture and control is presented in the dossier. RHuPH20 has already 
been approved as an excipient in other antibody-based medicinal products for SC injection. 
The active substance manufacturing process has been optimised for the more concentrated 120 mg/mL 
daratumumab active substance for SC injection and is run at a new manufacturing facility.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Daratumumab is a fully human monoclonal glycosylated immunoglobulin G1κ (IgG1κ). The antibody is 
produced  by  genetically  engineered  CHO  cells  and  binds  with  high  affinity  and  specificity  to  the 
extracellular domain of human CD38. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing process 
A  new  manufacturing  site  (Biogen  (Denmark)  Manufacturing  ApS)  has  been  proposed  for  the 
manufacture  of  daratumumab  used  for  the  SC  presentation.  A  second-generation  active  substance 
manufacturing  process  optimised  for  the  more  concentrated  120  mg/mL  active  substance  has  been 
established. Valid GMP certificates for Biogen Denmark and all active substance quality control sites are 
provided.  
The adapted process is not considered to constitute an alternate process, but rather changes introduced 
to increase antibody titer while maintaining the batch scale. The working cell bank and the bioreactor 
scale  (15,000  L)  are  identical  to  the  currently  approved  process  for  20  mg/mL  daratumumab  active 
substance.  Changes  have  been  made  to  the  cell  culture  media  and  the  bioreactor  duration  has  been 
decreased from 15 days for 20 mg/mL daratumumab to 13 days for 120 mg/mL daratumumab.  
None of the culture media contain components of animal origin.  
The  120  mg/mL  active  substance  purification  process  has  been  adjusted  compared  to  the  20  mg/mL 
active  substance  in  order  to  manage  the  increased  antibody  titer.  The  Protein  A  affinity  and  cation-
exchange  column  resins,  as  well  as  the  virus  removal  filter,  have  been  replaced.  Virus  validation 
confirmed adequate viral clearance capacity of the purification process using the new resins and virus 
filter. In addition, where the 20 mg/mL active substance manufacturing process has a virus inactivated 
and  neutralised  intermediate  (VIN  intermediate)  which  can  be  stored  frozen,  the  120  mg/mL 
manufacturing process uses a straight-through process without this option. Additionally, the final UF/DF 
step has been modified to achieve the higher active substance concentration in a different formulation 
buffer. The final formulation (except for the addition of rHuPH20 during finished product manufacturing) 
is made at the active substance level. 
The  harvest  from  the  bioreactor  is  confirmed  to  be  free  of  microbial  growth  by  testing  for  microbial 
detection, mycoplasma and adventitious viruses (all are IPCs with acceptance criteria). IPCs control for 
the  levels  of  bioburden  and  endotoxin  throughout  purification,  and  by  the  end  of  the  purification  the 
sterile-filtered active substance is tested for its content of host cell proteins. The proposed controls are 
all considered appropriate and do not call for comments.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical and non-critical output parameters are defined in the dossier for the individual manufacturing 
steps. Adequate justifications for the respective acceptance criteria have been provided.

Process validation 
The 120 mg/mL active substance manufacturing process has been re-evaluated and re-validated due to 
the  introduced  process  changes.  Consistency  of  the  daratumumab  manufacturing  process  was 
demonstrated  by  manufacture  and  analysis  of  five  consecutive  commercial-scale  process  validation 
batches.  Residual  host  cell  DNA  and  residual  Protein  A  was  consistently  shown  to  be  removed  to

sufficiently low levels within these process validation batches, as well as in other clinical batches, which 
makes the Applicant’s proposal of omitting in-process control (IPC) testing of these two process-related 
impurities acceptable. The residual host cell DNA and Protein A levels will, however, still be measured, 
with established alerts limits, in association with the monitoring of the resin lifetimes. 
Virus removal re-filtration at Stage 8, re-concentration of pre-formulated bulk at Stage 9 and re-filtration 
of  the  active  substance  at  Stage  10  has  been  validated  at  reduced  scale.  To  further  support  the 
reprocessing at commercial scale (one step per batch), verification studies will be performed on the first 
commercial  scale  batches  that  require  reprocessing.  The  proposed  reprocessing  steps  are  found 
acceptable and in line with the CHMP process validation guideline (EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014). 
Manufacturing process development 
In  comparability  studies,  20  mg/mL  daratumumab  active  substance  batches  were  compared  to  120 
mg/mL daratumumab active substance batches used in the clinical development. The analytical program 
encompasses both the release assays as well as extended characterisation and demonstrates that 120 
mg/mL daratumumab active substance batches have physicochemical and biological characteristics, as 
well as impurity levels, that are comparable to the 20 mg/mL daratumumab active substance.  
Characterisation 
The elucidation of structure confirmed that the change in the manufacturing method did not result in any 
significant structural change. 
The  120  mg/ml  daratumumab  active  substance  batch  was  used  for  all  characterisation  studies.  The 
protein structure of daratumumab was characterised using a wide variety of orthogonal techniques. The 
characterisation results, presented in Table 3, are in general identical or highly similar to those presented 
in the 20 mg/mL Darzalex solution for infusion. 
No detectable differences in biological activity was found between the two active substance batches.   
The head-to-head comparability study presented showed that, in general, the 120 mg/mL daratumumab 
active  substance  corresponds  to  the  20  mg/mL  daratumumab  active  substance.  Product-related 
impurities  in  the  active  substance  were  characterised.  It  can  be  concluded  that  the  adaptations 
introduced to the daratumumab manufacturing process for production of 120 mg/mL daramtumumab 
active substance is without negative impact on the impurity profile. 
Specification 
The specification for the active substance includes control of identity, purity and impurities, potency and 
other general tests. 
Analytical methods 
All analytical methods, except for identity, are identical to the methods used for release and stability 
testing of 20 mg/mL daratumumab active substance. The identity test has been adequately validated.  
Batch analysis 
Analysis data on 12 batches of the active substance were provided. Batch analysis results confirm that 
the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  120  mg/mL  daratumumab  active  substance  of  an 
acceptable and consistent quality. 
Reference materials 
No change 
Stability 
The  shelf  life  of  the  active  substance  is  24  months  when  stored  frozen  at  the  recommended  storage 
conditions  of  -70  (±10°C)  or  -40  (±10°C),  which  allows  more  flexibility  compared  to  the  approved 
storage temperature of the 20 mg/mL daratumumab active substance at -70ºC. The shelf life claim is 
Assessment report

based  on  an  ongoing  stability  program  for  clinical,  process  validation,  and  post-process  validation 
batches. The stability program is designed to follow ICH guidelines.  
Statistical trending analyses of the real-time stability data (-40 ±10 °C) were performed when applicable 
as per ICH Q1E guidance. Stability data from storage at -70°C is support the lower storage condition. 
The proposed shelf life and storage conditions for the active substance are considered acceptable.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
Description and composition of the dosage form 
The daratumumab finished product is supplied as a sterile 120 mg/mL solution for injection, intended 
for administration by the SC route. The solution is clear to opalescent, colourless to yellow. Each vial 
contains 1800 mg of daratumumab in a 15 mL nominal fill volume and an excess volume of at least 1.3 
mL. The finished product contains no preservatives and is for single use only. 
The nominal composition of the finished product along with the function and grade of the excipients used 
in preparation of the finished product are provided. 
All excipients used in the finished product formulation are of non-animal origin and, with the exception 
of rHuPH20, all the excipients are of pharmacopoeial grade. RHuPH20 is a skin permeation enhancer that 
facilitates  SC  delivery;  it  is  a  known  excipient  used  in  the  formulation  of  other  centrally  authorised 
monoclonal antibody products; further details are provided below.  
Pharmaceutical development 
The  primary  reason  for  developing  and  optimising  the  SC  formulation  was  to  significantly  reduce  the 
burden of administration time associated with IV administration. To facilitate SC delivery, the finished 
product was formulated with rHuPH20.  
The selection of the formulation composition was based on the results of a high throughput formulation 
screening, a short-term stability study, and other development studies. The lead formulation was further 
tested for robustness against manufacturing, processing, and shipping stress. Based on the outcome of 
all  these  studies,  the  finished  product  formulation  was  optimised  to  achieve  a  daratumumab 
concentration of 120 mg/mL allowing SC delivery and a single vial liquid dosage form presentation (1800 
mg/vial of daratumumab).  
The  applicant  has  applied  QbD  principles  in  the  development  of  the  finished  product  and  their 
manufacturing process.  
A  Quality  Target  Product  Profile  (QTPP)  has  been  presented  including  the  derived  Critical  Quality 
Attributes (CQAs).  
The manufacturing process for the 120 mg/mL daratumumab finished product and its associated control 
strategy were developed based on the QTPP and the manufacturing experience gained with the approved 
product at the commercial manufacturing facility. A formal risk assessment was performed to establish 
an appropriate set of controls for the CQAs constituting of parametric controls, material controls, IPC 
tests, release testing, stability testing, characterisation testing, process validation, and process controls.  
Criticality  assessment  was  performed  on  all  the  parameters  of  the  finished  product  manufacturing 
process steps that could potentially impact the CQAs. These steps (e.g. compounding, sterile filtration, 
aseptic filling, stoppering and capping, and their critical process parameters (CPPs) were identified and 
proven acceptable ranges (PARs) were set.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/273138/2020  
Page 13/132 
 
 
 
Acceptable  justifications  for  the  IPC  acceptance  criteria  are  provided  in  the  dossier.  IPC  tests  were 
performed  on  all  Phase  3  and  process  validation  batches  at  the  critical  steps  in  the  finished  product 
manufacturing process. The number of process validation batches has been justified. 
The  primary  packaging  material  consisting  of  a  type  1  glass  vial  with  an  elastomeric  closure  and  an 
aluminium seal with a flip off button comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements and is considered suitable 
for  a  solution  for  injection  intended  to  be  administered  subcutaneously.  Additionally,  the  secondary 
packaging  is  protecting  the  finished  product  against  light  exposure,  as  the  finished  product  is  light 
sensitive. The stability data for the finished product demonstrates that the container closure also provide 
adequate  protection  from microbial  contamination,  as  has  been  shown  for  all  the  clinical  and  process 
validation batches placed on stability at 2-8 °C after 0, 12 and 24 months of storage. This is supported 
by container closure integrity tests.  
Studies to determine the extractables and potential leachables from the bromobutyl stoppers have been 
conducted and are justified.   
The finished product was evaluated for compatibility with different types of syringes, plungers and types 
of SC administration sets. The results from these studies show that the finished product is compatible 
with the claimed components and studies are justified.  
Excipient - recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) 
The rHuPH20 is a glycosylated single chain protein. rHuPH20 acts locally and transiently to depolymerise 
the substrate hyaluronan at the site of injection in the skin. This facilitates the absorption and dispersion 
of  the  injected  monoclonal  antibody  by  temporarily  reducing  viscosity  and  resistance  to  flow  in  the 
subcutaneous space.  
The rhuPH20 is produced in genetically engineered CHO cells. Detailed information on the manufacture 
and control is presented in the dossier. rHuPH20 from the same supplier has already been commercially 
registered within the EU as a biological excipient when co-formulated with other biological therapeutics 
(see  above).  Therefore,  the  assessment  of  the  manufacture  and  control  of  rhuPH20  is  only  shortly 
summarised in the assessment report.  
The  rHuPH20  manufacturing  process  is  based  on  a  cell  bank  system.  The  manufacturing  process  is 
described in satisfactory detail. There are no materials of animal origin used in the process. 
•  Suitable in-process controls and release controls are proposed.  
The  proposed  rHuPH20  Bulk  Enzyme  specification  has  been  applied  throughout  clinical  development 
(Phase 1 to Phase 3) and is found acceptable.  
Viral safety is confirmed for the rHuPH20 MCB, WCB, and end-of-production cells.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturing process 
The 120 mg/mL daratumumab finished product, is manufactured by Cilag AG Schaffhausen, Switzerland, 
where also primary packaging, secondary packaging and quality control of the drug product is performed. 
Quality control is also performed at Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, and batch release and quality control 
is performed at Janssen Biologics B.V., in the Netherlands. Secondary packaging and physical importation 
are performed by Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Belgium.  
The  commercial  manufacturing  process  of  daratumumab  finished  product  consists  of  receiving  and 
storage  of  frozen  active  substance,  thawing,  compounding,  and  pre-filtration  to  create  the  finished 
product solution. The finished product solution is sterile filtered and aseptically filled into vials, which are 
stoppered and capped to achieve the final finished product. The vials are 100% optically inspected, and 
stored at 2-8°C. The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient details in the dossier.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/273138/2020  
Page 14/132 
 
 
 
A  risk  assessment  for  the  potential  presence  of  elemental  impurities  in  the  finished  product  was 
conducted in accordance with ICH Q3D guideline, taking into account potential contributions from the 
active substance, excipients, manufacturing equipment, container closure system (primary packaging), 
and  processing  water.  No  elemental  impurities  above  the  calculated  permitted  daily  exposure  for 
parenteral finished products were identified in 120 mg/mL daratumumab finished product. 
Process validation 
Validation  of  the  process  steps  was  performed  to  demonstrate  control  of  the  finished  product 
manufacturing process. The following steps were evaluated as part of the process validation: thawing 
and holding, compounding, pre-filtration, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, stoppering and capping, optical 
inspection, secondary packaging, and other possible post-fill process steps (e.g., 100% container closure 
integrity test), and the results met the pre-established acceptance criteria.  
Those aspects of the process that were validated met one or more of the following five types of pre-
determined criteria: acceptance criteria for IPCs, acceptable ranges for CPPs, acceptance criteria for all 
finished  product  release  tests,  acceptance  criteria  for  all  process  characterisation  testing  and/or 
additional acceptance criteria for product characterisation testing (qualified, non-routine tests used to 
characterise the finished product). 
Reproducibility  is  demonstrated  by  the  manufacturing  of  three  consecutive  finished  product  process 
validation batches. Additionally, the results of the release and characterisation tests used to evaluate 
the consistency of these batches confirmed that the manufacturing process reliably produces the finished 
product with consistent biochemical, biological, and physical properties. 
All process characterisation, finished product release and characterisation sampling tests met the release 
acceptance  criteria  and  process  validation  specifications  for  all  quality  attributes  including  microbial 
control. The proposed holding times are considered acceptable. 
Media fills were performed to qualify the aseptic filling process and demonstrate that the procedures and 
environmental  conditions in  the  commercial manufacturing  facility  were  capable  of  supporting  aseptic 
processing of the finished product, as demonstrated by the results of the three most recent semi-annual 
re-qualification runs of 2017/2018.    
Satisfactory  validation  reports  on  filters  used  during  the  manufacturing  process,  as  well  as  validation 
reports  on  sterilisation  of  equipment,  components  and  stoppers,  depyrogenation  of  glass  vials  and 
decontamination of filling isolators has been provided in the dossier.   
Qualification of finished product shipping was evaluated through qualification of the shipping systems 
used for transportation through the supply chain and is found acceptable. 
Ongoing process verification is in place where data from commercial manufactured batches are reviewed 
periodically to verify that the validated state is maintained. This is acceptable.  
Product specification 
The specification for the finished product includes control of identity, purity and impurities, potency and 
other  general  tests.  The  tests  listed  on  the  finished  product  specification  for  release  and  stability  is 
acceptable and in line with ICH Q6B.  
Process-related  impurities  in  the  finished  product  are  the  same  as  those  listed  and  evaluated  for  the 
active substance.  
Analytical methods 
Many  analytical  procedures  are  identical  to  the  procedures  used  to  analyse  Darzalex  20  mg/mL.  All 
analytical procedures have been adequately described and have been revalidated in the proposed new 
SC formulation, and are thus suitable for analysis of the 120 mg/mL daratumumab finished product. 
Batch analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/273138/2020

Batch analysis results have been presented for a justified number of batches of 120 mg/ml daratumumab 
finished product; justified number of clinical batches and justified number of process validation batches. 
The  batch  results  are  all  well  within  specification  limits,  and  the  results  confirm  consistency  and 
uniformity of the product, indicating that the manufacturing process is under control. 
Reference materials 
No change. 
Stability of the product 
The acceptable shelf life of 120 mg/mL daratumumab finished product is 12 months when stored at the 
recommended storage condition of 2-8 °C and protected from light. 
Stability  results  from  batches  manufactured  according  to  commercial  process  as  well  as  pilot  scale 
batches have been provided. The studies are performed in accordance with ICH Q5C (Stability testing of 
Biotechnological/Biological products). Results from accelerated and stress studies have been provided.    
All  stability  data  for  batches  stored  at  recommended  storage  conditions  remained  within  specification 
acceptance criteria at all time points tested.  
A photostability study has been performed showing degradation, aggregation and decrease in potency 
of the finished product during light exposure, thus supporting the storage condition “protect from light”. 
Additionally, a temperature cycling study on two finished product batches was performed, showing that 
120 mg/mL daratumumab finished product remains stable following possible temperature fluctuations 
during transportation. 
During the shelf-life, the product in unpunctured vial may be stored at room temperature (≤300C) and 
ambient light for a single period of up to 24 hours in the original carton to protect from light. Once the 
product has been taken out of the refrigerator, the product must not be returned to the refrigerator. 
Once transferred from the vial into the dosing syringe (provided separately), the Darzalex solution for 
subcutaneous injection can be stored for up to 4 hours at ambient temperature and ambient light. 
Adventitious agents  
During cell line development, fetal bovine serum was used. No animal-derived materials have, however, 
been  used  to  prepare  the  master  cell  bank  or  working  cell  banks  or  have  been  used  during  antibody 
manufacturing. 
Mycoplasma  and  microbial  bioburden  are  controlled  through  use  of  a  sanitary  process  design  and 
appropriate testing. Bioburden and endotoxin contamination is also evaluated as part of routine release 
testing.  
Viral  clearance  is  achieved  through  two  orthogonal  steps;  viral  inactivation  (low-pH  treatment),  and 
physical  removal  by  virus  removal  filtration.  Five  manufacturing  steps  were  evaluated  for  their  virus 
reducing capacity.  
A viral safety factor for retrovirus-like particles (RVLP) in the manufacturing process was calculated from 
viral clearance values using XMuLV, a specific model virus for the RVLP in the production CHO cell line 
used for clinical and commercial manufacturing. Unprocessed cell culture supernatant in the production 
bioreactor  was  found  to  contain  a  maximum  of  2.5  x  109  RVLP/mL.  The  manufacturing  process  was 
calculated to provide sufficient removal capacity to assure a level of less than 1 lipid-enveloped RVLP 
per 5.3 x 1011 doses.  
With regard to non-specific model virus studies, cumulative minimum clearances of 13.5 log10 for mouse 
virus minute, 28.3 log10 for pseudorabies virus, and 19.8 log10 for reovirus type 3 were demonstrated. 
Overall, the study on the virus reduction capacity of the manufacturing process is acceptable.

Compliance with the TSE Guideline (EMEA/410/01 – rev. 3) has been demonstrated.  
Post approval change management protocol(s)  
PACMPs to the daratumumab manufacturing process  
The  Applicant  has  included  three  PACMPs  in  the  line  extension  application  where  the  validation  of 
reprocessing at commercial scale batches is deferred until a time when it is required. Separate PACMPs 
are provided for reprocessing at Stage 8, Stage 9 and Stage 10. All three PACMPs are found acceptable. 
PACMP to the excipient rHuPH20 manufacturing process  
A PACMP has been proposed to support implementation of new manufacturing equipment and process 
changes at the rHuPH20 active substance manufacturing site. A process validation campaign consisting 
of suitable number of consecutive rHuPH20 Bulk Enzyme lots will be conducted to support comparability 
of pre- and post-change rHuPH20 Bulk Enzyme. In-process control and release testing results from the 
process validation lots will be compared to the results from a suitable number of historical lots using the 
currently approved process and evaluated using pre-established assessment limits. The PACMP includes 
a plan to evaluate comparability of the finished product manufactured using the pre-changes and post-
changes rHuPH20 Bulk Enzyme. The proposed strategy is acceptable The PACMP is found acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  overall  quality  documentation  provided  in  this  line  extension  application  to  introduce  a  new 
pharmaceutical form, Darzalex 1800 mg solution for injection for subcutaneous use, is considered to be 
adequate.  
The active substance manufacturing process has been successfully optimised to produce the more 
concentrated 120 mg/mL daratumumab active substance in the new manufacturing facility. The 
changes have been adequately explained and supported by data. An appropriate control strategy is in 
place to guarantee consistent quality of the active substance, finished product, including the non-
compendial excipient rHuPH20. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral and TSE safety.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
From a quality point of view, the line extension application for Darzalex is considered approvable.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The results of the nonclinical program for daratumumab, as submitted in the initial Marketing 
Authorisation Application (MAA) for DARZALEX IV for multiple myeloma, can be applied to 
daratumumab SC. In addition, the nonclinical program for rHuPH20, submitted in support of line 
extensions procedures for MabThera and Herceptin® are provided and can also be applied to 
daratumumab SC.  
In this nonclinical assessment report, only newly performed studies in support of the combination 
formulation are assessed in detail.  
The new studies submitted in this application are: 
• 
Two new studies on rHuPH20 alone carried out to investigate the local effects at the infusion 
site following SC delivery in Yucatan mini-pigs and Sprague-Dawley rats. 
o 
o 
Local skin reactions were assessed after ID administration of rHuPH20 to Sprague 
Dawley rats (study R09090).  
Induration and local infusion site evaluations were performed after SC administration of 
rHuPH20 to Yucatan mini-pigs (studies 11028, 11018 and 11125).  
• 
• 
Three non-GLP studies in Yucatan mini pig were performed to evaluate infusion rate, injection 
pressure and the effect of needle size on SC infusion of dara-rHuPH20. (Studies 15036, 16020, 
16093) 
Three tissue distribution studies following ID, SC, or intravenous (IV) administration of 
125I-labeled rHuPH20 in mice (12214-B, 13128, 13184). 
•  A single-dose GLP rabbit local tolerance study was performed to support the safety of dara 
rHuPH20 when administered by SC infusion (Study T-2014-031).  
Safety pharmacology endpoints were evaluated as part of the repeated dose toxicity studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys. The previously performed studies are summarised in brief where appropriate. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Daratumumab  (dara) is  a human  immunoglobulin  (Ig)G1ĸ  antibody  based  therapeutic  agent  that  has 
already been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma for the IV formulation as Darzalex. 
The  applicant  has  developed  a  new  subcutaneous  (SC)  formulation  containing  dara  which  is  co-
formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), and this is applied as an extension to the 
IV Darzalex formulation. rHuPH20 is an endoglycosidase used to increase the dispersion and absorption 
of  co-administered  drugs  when  administered  by  a  SC  route.  PH20  hyaluronidase  depolymerizes 
Hyaluronan  (HA)  which  results  in  a  transient  reduction  in  the  viscosity  of  the  gel-like  phase  of  the 
extracellular  matrix,  and  in  this  way,  PH20  temporarily  facilitates  dispersion,  and  allows  for  larger 
volumes to be administered via the SC route.  
Only chimpanzee has been identified as the relevant toxicological species, as daratumumab only binds 
to  human  and  chimpanzee  CD38,  but  not  that  of  other  common  toxicological  species.  Due  to  ethical 
reasons, further studies on the SC formulation was not conducted in chimpanzee. Only local tolerance 
studies in rabbits and Yucatan mini-pigs were conducted on daratumumab and rHuPH20 combined via 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/273138/2020  
Page 18/132 
 
 
 
 
SC administration to assess local tolerability and feasibility of route of administration. It is agreed that 
the  results  of  the  nonclinical  program  for  daratumumab,  as  submitted  in  the  initial  Marketing 
Authorisation  Application  for  Darzalex  IV  formulation,  can  be  applied  to  daratumumab  SC,  as  the 
intended target concentration is similar following both SC and IV administration. Furthermore, some of 
the data regarding rHuPH20 submitted in support of the dara-rHuPH20 application is the same as that 
approved  for  subcutaneous  administration  of  MabThera  (H/C/165/X/0083,  approved  in  2014)  and 
Herceptin  (H/C/278/X/0060,  approved  in  2013),  and  reference  is  given  respectively  to  the  EPAR  for 
these products where the studies have already been assessed. 
Studies on the primary pharmacology of daratumumab have already been assessed in connection with 
the  authorisation  of  the  IV  formulation  of  Darzalex.  The  dispersive  properties  of  rHuPH20  was  also 
already assessed previously. It was concluded that rHuPH20 has locally-acting dispersive properties in 
the skin. 
In reviewing the submitted studies, it was apparent that the company behind rHuPH20 has performed 
additional  studies  not  previously  assessed.  The  new  studies  on  rHuPH20  alone  were  carried  out  to 
investigate the local effects at the infusion site following SC delivery in Yucatan mini-pigs and Sprague-
Dawley rats.  
Local  skin  reactions  as  a  function  of  delivery  volume  and  buffer  composition  following  intradermal 
administration  of  rHuPH20  was  investigated  in  Sprague-Dawley  rats.  No  histologic  findings  were 
observed at the injection sites that were attributed to the buffer, human serum albumin (HSA), rHuPH20, 
or volume injected in the rat intradermal space. 
When immunoglobulin G (IgG) was subcutaneously infused to Yucatan mini-pigs, concomitant infusion 
with rHuPH20 resulted in reduction of the local effects of SC administration as measured by local swelling, 
skin surface temperature, histological changes as well as induration, which corresponded with greater 
maintenance of normal cutaneous blood pressure. Furthermore, reduced changes in infusion pressure 
with increased volumetric dispersion and skin pliability was observed as well as a maintained cutaneous 
blood perfusion in the presence of rHuPH20 during large volume infusions of IgG. 
No  stand-alone  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  with  either  daratumumab  or  rHuPH20. 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were incorporated into the design of the repeat-dose toxicology studies 
as suggested in ICH S6(R1).  
With  reference  to  the  assessment  performed  in  connection  with  the  authorisation  of  Darzalex  IV 
formulation there were no treatment-related adverse effects on cardiovascular, respiratory, or central 
nervous system parameters in the 6-week repeat-dose toxicology studies in chimpanzees administered 
daratumumab.  
Previously,  a  39  week  study  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  using  rHuPH20  has been  provided in  support of 
another SC formulation containing rHuPH20, where safety pharmacology endpoints were included. No 
treatment-related  adverse  effects  of  once  weekly  SC  administered  rHuPH20  were  observed  on 
cardiovascular, respiratory, or central nervous system parameters at up to 2 mg/kg/day. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The information provided by the applicant regarding the bioanalytical methods is considered acceptable. 
Both  GLP  compliant  and  non-GLP  compliant  studies  were  submitted  which  were  either  validated  or 
qualified according to current guidelines. 
Regarding tissue distribution of rHuPH20, this was further investigated in CD-1 mice after single IV, ID 
or SC administration of 125I-rHuPH20 at different doses. The studies showed a similar rate of distribution 
for the different administration pathways, where radioactivity in tissues was well distributed after 2-5 
minutes post-dose. Cmax was obtained after 15 min-2 h. The elimination half-life was similar between 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/273138/2020  
Page 19/132 
 
 
 
 
 
the  different  administration  routes  and  ranged  from  3.5-5.9  h.  In  terms  of  total  radioactivity  dose 
administered,  apart  from the injection  site,  the highest  proportions  were  associated  with  liver,  lungs, 
urinary bladder content, kidneys, thyroid/parathyroid glands and gall bladder/bile. 
Excretion studies on rHuPH20 showed a rapid excretion mainly via urine with similar recoveries across 
administration  routes;  70-80  %  and  >98  %  for  ID,  IV  and  SC  administration,  respectively.  Smaller 
proportions was recovered in faeces. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No  new  toxicological  studies  have  been  performed  with  daratumumab  or  rHuPH20  besides  a  GLP 
compliant local tolerance study in NZW rabbits as well as three non-GLP studies in Yucatan minipigs. 
A study in juvenile mice were submitted in support of rHuPH20. However, the indication for Darzalex SC 
formulation is in the adult population only. Therefore, the juvenile study with rHuPH20 is considered not 
relevant and has not been assessed in detail. For future application for use in children, an assessment 
of the juvenile population must be performed. 
In  a  GLP  compliant  local  tolerance  study  NZW  rabbits  received  14 mL  of  rHuPH20  SC  alone  or  in 
combination  with  daratumumab  (20  mg/mL)  at  a  rate  of  5  mL/min.  The  following  parameters  were 
evaluated during the in-life phase of the study: clinical signs, body weights, body weight changes, food 
consumption, dermal scoring, and body temperatures. Animals were euthanized on day 4 and further 
examined.  Dosing  with  rHuPH20  did  not  result  in  any  findings  besides  barely  perceptible  erythema, 
flaking,  and  purple  discolorations  at  the  injection  site  which  were  observed  in  all  groups.  No 
daratumumab related macroscopic or microscopic findings were observed. This is endorsed. 
Three studies were conducted with female Yucatan mini-pigs via SC administration to investigate local 
reactions at the injection site as a function of differing concentrations of human IgG or daratumumab, 
differing concentrations of rHuPH20, rate of injection and needle size. The volume used in the nonclinical 
studies were identical to the clinically used volume (15 mL). 
There  were  no  statistical  differences  between  different  concentrations  on  rHuPH20  on  degree  of 
erythema, swelling and local infusion site swelling, however, injection pressure was reduced in a dose-
dependent trend with increasing concentration of rHuPH20. The higher flow rate of 4 mL/min resulted in 
less reactions than the lower rate. Furthermore, it was shown that the 23-gauge needle produced the 
smallest bleb with manual injection. 
Non-clinical  investigations  of  the  potential  impact  of  ADA  on  fertility  and  offspring  development  were 
investigated in reproductive and developmental studies in CD-1 mice and NZW rabbits. In mice, exposure 
to ADA in offspring was confirmed throughout development from late gestation through adulthood. Male 
and female fertility investigations in rabbits showed that persistent exposure to ADA prior to mating had 
no impact on mating behaviour and fertility. Furthermore, ADA did not show effects on the offspring pre-
weaning or post-weaning through maturity and mating. NZW rabbit was shown to be a relevant species 
for the safety assessment of rRbPH20 ADA impact. 
Endogenous  PH20  expression patterns  were  characterized  in  human  tissue.  The  study  concluded  that 
the  human  anti-PH20/rHuPH20  antibodies  demonstrated  specific  binding  only  to  the  testis.  Gene 
expression studies in mice, rabbit and human tissue furthermore showed that SPAM1/PH20 is primarily 
expressed in the adult male reproductive tract. 
Darzalex is however not indicated during pregnancy. Therefore, the information on the effect of ADA on 
fertility and offspring development is not considered relevant for this application.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment for rHuPH20 and daratumumab have already been addressed in 
previous market authorisations and are not further addressed in this assessment report, as the 
indication for the SC formulation is to simply substitute the IV administration. Hence, no increase in 
the exposure of daratumumab to the environment is foreseen.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Only chimpanzee has been identified as the relevant toxicological species, as daratumumab only binds 
to  human  and  chimpanzee  CD38,  but  not  that  of  other  common  toxicological  species.  Due  to  ethical 
reasons, further studies on the SC formulation was not conducted in chimpanzee, which is accepted and 
supported.  
Only  local  tolerance  studies  in  rabbits  and  Yucatan  mini-pigs  were  conducted  on  daratumumab  and 
rHuPH20  combined  via  SC  administration  to  assess  local  tolerability  and  feasibility  of  route  of 
administration. It is agreed that the results of the nonclinical program for daratumumab, as submitted 
in  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  for  Darzalex  IV  formulation,  can  be  applied  to 
daratumumab  SC,  as  the  intended  target  concentration  is  similar  following  both  SC  and  IV 
administration.  Furthermore,  some  of  the  data  regarding  rHuPH20  submitted  in  support  of  the  dara-
rHuPH20  application  is  the  same  as  that  approved  for  subcutaneous  administration  of  previously 
authorized products. 
No adverse findings was observed in the conducted local tolerance studies and as the documentation 
submitted  in  support  of  the  extension  was  considered  adequate,  no  nonclinical  Other  Concerns  have 
been raised. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The nonclinical data submitted for the new SC formulation of Darzalex is considered sufficient to 
support authorisation from a nonclinical point of view. The conclusions from the nonclinical assessment 
is considered sufficiently reflected in section 4.6 and 5.3 in the SmPC. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The submission for daratumumab SC consists of 4 clinical studies in subjects with multiple myeloma.

GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with the ethical principles originating in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation of technical 
Requirements and GCP guidelines as claimed by the MAH 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical Methods 
A validated electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassay was used for quantitation of daratumumab 
in serum samples. Carry-over was not investigated. Bioanalysis of daratumumab SC in studies MMY1004, 
MMY1008, MMY2040 and MMY3012 was performed at a CRO or in-house at Janssen. The method was 
cross-validated  between  sites.  The  in-study  performance  of  the  daratumumab  assay  was  overall 
considered  acceptable  for  daratumumab  SC.  Immunogenicity  of  daratumumab  SC  will  be  reassessed 
following reanalysis with an improved screening ADA assay. The tissue permeability enhancer rHuPH20 
was not measurable in serum according to the Applicant and no bioanalysis of rHuPH20 was performed. 
rHuPH20 immunogenicity was assessed by use of validated assay. 
Evaluation and Qualification of Models  
An exploratory analysis on concentration-time data and covariates was performed to compare the PK of 
daratumumab SC and IV. Data from studies MMY3012, MMY1004 part 2 and MMY1008 were fitted using 
the datatumumab model derived for IV infusion with the absorption of the SC formulation modelled as a 
first-order absorption process. 
Pop PK population 
Only  subjects  using  the  SC  formulation  (MMY1004  Part  2,  MMY1008,  MMY3012,  and  MMY2040)  were 
included in the population pharmacokinetics analyses. Subjects using the mixed-and-deliver formulation 
in MMY1004 Part 1 were not included. All serum samples, with available actual time of blood collection 
as well as daratumumab dose administration, were used for the population pharmacokinetics analysis.

The Pop PK model for SC administration was similar to the previous model for IV administration but with 
an additional depot compartment to account for the first-order SC absorption process. 
Figure 1 Michaelis Menten PK model for Daratumumab 
The Pop PK population consisted of data from 742 patients or 5305 data points. BLQ data (less than 3% 
of  the  data  set)  was  excluded  by  the  M1  method  for  parameter  estimation  but  included  in  the  final 
dataset.

The  exponents  for  weight  on  clearance  and  volume  are  1.24  and  0.91;  which  are  different  to  those 
expected for allometry (0.75 and 1, respectively). The intra-individual variability is moderate, 34.8%. 
The inter-individual variability is high (>36%) for all PK parameters. Sex, IgG myeloma, baseline albumin 
and weight were identified as significant covariates for daratumumab SC exposure.

Immunogenicity was not evaluated as a covariate in the Pop PK analysis. Exposure profiles did not seem 
to be affected in the ADA positive subjects (N=2 and N=20 for ADA against daratumumab and rHuPH20, 
respectively). 
The rate of absorption was estimated to 0.012 h-1 based on Pop PK. No formal bioavailability study was 
performed.  The  bioavailability  after  SC  injection  was  estimated  to  68.9%  by  Pop  PK.  All  clinical 
daratumumab  SC  data  included  in  the  Pop  PK  population  used  the  commercial  SC  formulation.  No 
bioequivalence  studies  were  conducted.  Food  effect  was  not  investigated.  The  mean  volume  of 
distribution was estimated to 5,25 L (V1) and 3.78  L (V2) by Pop PK analysis. The Pop PK estimated 
linear clearance is 4.96 mL/h and the associated mean half-life 20.4 days. After combination therapy, 
the  half-life  ranged  from  23-27  days.  In  studies,  steady-state  was  reached  after  5  months  at  the 
proposed dose schedule for daratumumab SC monotherapy. Dose proportionality was evaluated between 
doses 1200 mg SC (n=4) and 1800 mg SC in study MMY1004, using the explorative formulation Dara-
MD.  The  commercial  formulation  Dara-CF  gave  about  30%  higher  exposure  than  the  Dara-MD 
formulation following 1800 mg SC for 8 weeks.

Table 4 
Daratumumab elimination showed both dose- and time-dependent clearance. Clearance decreased with 
increasing doses and with multiple dosing due to target depletion. Daratumumab SC accumulated over 
time with an accumulation ratio of 4.8 and 5.4, after eight weekly doses at 1800 mg SC, for Cmax and 
AUC0-7, respectively. The intra-individual variability determined by Pop PK is moderate (34.8%), while 
the inter-individual variability is moderate to high for PK parameters (36.9% for V1, 58.7% for CL, 67.4 
for  Vmax,  145.9%  Kdes  and  36.1%  for  Ka).  The  inter-individual  variability  for  exposure  parameters 
ranged from 37.8% to 50.8% in Study MMY1004 with rich PK sampling.

Observed mean exposure (Ctrough at Cycle 3 Day 1) was comparable after SC and IV administration in 
Study MMY3012. This exposure level was also comparable to the simulated Cycle 3 Day 1 Ctrough by 
Pop PK analyses. AUC0-7d was simulated in Cycle 1 after 1st weekly dose to 720 and 1187 µg/mL×day 
and  prior  to  Cycle  3  Day  1  to  4017  and  4019  µg/mL×day  for  daratumumab  SC  and  IV  respectively. 
AUC0-28d after Q4W dosing (representing steady-state) was simulated to 5887 and 5206 µg/mL×day 
for SC and IV respectively. The simulated exposure at steady-state was 13% higher after SC dosing than 
after  IV.  Non-inferiority  between  SC  and  IV  administration  was  evaluated  by  means  of  Ctrough  after 
sparse sampling and not AUC.  
In Study MMY1004 and MMY1008 mean Ctrough values seemed notable higher than observed in Study 
MMY3012 after a similar dosing schedule and formulation. This could be attributed to differences in study 
characteristics. 
Table 5 
Variations in drug metabolising enzymes are not expected to affect the elimination of daratumumab as 
daratumumab  is  biotransformed  as  other  endogenous  IgG’s.  However,  glomerular  filtration  and 
subsequent  renal  metabolism  may  contribute  to  the  elimination.  Forest  plots  of  sub-group  analysis 
showed a minor increase in predicted exposure in patients with moderate renal function compared to a 
typical  subject.  Patients  with  severe  renal  function  were  represented  in  the  population  (N=28)  and

showed no effect on exposure based on mean Ctrough. The effect of impaired hepatic function is not 
evaluated for daratumumab SC as only patients with mild hepatic impairment was representative in the 
SC dataset.  
Absorption  
The rate of absorption for daratumumab after SC administration was approximately 0.012 hour-1 based 
on population pharmacokinetics evaluation. 
• 
Bioavailability 
No formal relative bioavailability study was performed. 
The  absolute  bioavailability  of  1800  mg  daratumumab  SC  estimated  using  pooled  population 
pharmacokinetics  analysis  was  approximately  68.9%  (RSE  2.7%)  which  is  consistent  with  other 
monoclonal antibodies subcutaneously co-administered with rHuPH20. 
In Study MMY3012, the mean peak serum concentration for daratumumab IV administration (16 mg/kg) 
was 767 (278) μg/mL and occurred at the end of infusion on Cycle 3 Day 1. For daratumumab SC (1800 
mg), the mean peak serum concentration of 721 (373) μg/mL occurred on Day 4 of Cycle 3, as would 
be expected for subcutaneous administration of a monoclonal antibody. 
Bioequivalence  
No  biopharmaceutic  studies  were  conducted  in  support  of  daratumumab  SC.  The  dose  selection  was 
based on Study MMY1004. The clinical Studies MMY1004 Part 2, MMY1008, SC arm of MMY3012, and 
MMY2040  used  the  same  daratumumab  SC  formulation,  identical  to  the  proposed  commercial 
formulation. Part 1 of MMY1004 used a mixed-and-deliver experimental daratumumab formulation for 
SC administration. 
Distribution 
The mean estimated volume of distribution for the central compartment (V1) was 5.25 L (36.9% CV) 
and for the peripheral compartment (V2) 3.78 L, suggesting that daratumumab primarily localised within 
the vascular system with limited extravascular tissue distribution. Both were related to body weight as 
expected for monoclonal antibodies. 
Elimination 
Excretion 
The clearance of daratumumab is not expected to change as a result of change in formulation or route 
of administration. Daratumumab is cleared by parallel linear and nonlinear saturable, target-mediated 
clearance. The target-mediated clearance of daratumumab decreases with multiple dosing, as the target 
depletes. The Pop PK estimated mean linear clearance is 4.96 mL/h (58.7% CV), which is close to the 
clearance of nonspecific endogenous IgG in the literature. Body weight, baseline albumin concentration, 
and  type  of  myeloma  (IgG  versus  non-IgG)  were  identified  as  statistically  significant  covariates  that 
affect linear clearance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/273138/2020  
Page 30/132 
 
 
 
 
 
The model-derived geometric mean half-life associated with linear elimination was 20.4 (22.4% CV) days 
for monotherapy and 23-27 days for combination therapies, based on post hoc PK estimates. Similar to 
previous daratumumab IV monotherapy studies, steady state appears to be reached approximately 5 
months into every 4 weeks dosing at the proposed dose schedule of 1800 mg daratumumab SC. 
Metabolism 
As  an  IgG1қ  mAb,  daratumumab  is  presumably  biotransformed  in  the  same  manner  as  any  other 
endogenous IgG (degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways) and undergoes 
a similar elimination.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
The dose proportionality was assessed in MMY1004. Following a 1.5-fold increase in dose (from 1200 
mg to 1800 mg), the first dose Cmax increased 2-fold, and eighth dose Cmax increased approximately 
1.4-fold and the AUC0-7d increased approximately 2-fold for first dose and 1.4-fold for the eighth weekly 
dose (Table 11). 
Time dependency 
The single- and multiple-dose PK of daratumumab SC were evaluated in Studies MMY1004 Part 2 and 
MMY1008 (Table 12). Daratumumab exhibited both concentration- and time-dependent PK with parallel 
linear and nonlinear (saturable) elimination, characteristic of target-mediated clearance.

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In Study MMY1004, the inter-subject variability for 1800 mg Dara-CF and Dara-MD, expressed as %CV 
for Ctrough, Cmax and AUC7days of Cycle 2 Dose 4, was moderate and similar between formulations, 
ranging from 37.8% to 50.8%.

Study MMY3012: Analysis of maximum Ctrough (Cycle 3 Day 1)  
A  total  of  295  subjects  were  included  in  the  PK-evaluable  analysis  set,  with  daratumumab  SC  and 
daratumumab  IV  groups  being  generally  similar  in  sample  size.  The  average  (SD)  maximum  Ctrough 
(Cycle 3 Day 1 predose) were 593 (306) and 522 (226) μg/mL, respectively, for the daratumumab SC 
and daratumumab IV groups.  
The geometric means ratio for Ctrough was 107.93% (90% CI: 95.74%, 121.67%) for daratumumab 
SC versus daratumumab IV. Since the lower limit of the 90% CI exceeded 80%, daratumumab SC was 
demonstrated to be non-inferior to daratumumab IV in terms of pharmacokinetics.

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
The effect of renal impairment was assessed for both monotherapy (both IV and SC) and combination 
therapy (SC only) treatment regimens. In the daratumumab IV monotherapy group, the geometric mean 
values for Cycle 3 Day 1 Ctrough by renal function were: normal (472 μg/mL, N=70), mild (380 μg/mL, 
N=81),  moderate  (452  μg/mL,  N=80),  and  severe  (362  μg/mL,  N=19).  In  the  daratumumab  SC 
monotherapy  group,  the  geometric  mean  values  for  Cycle  3  Day  1  Ctrough  by  renal  function  were: 
normal (405 μg/mL, N=80), mild (504 μg/mL, N=112), and moderate (598 μg/mL, N=87). 
In  the  pooled  population  PK  analyses  of  daratumumab  SC  in  subjects  with  multiple  myeloma  renal 
impairment was not identified to significantly influence the PK of daratumumab 
Of all patients included in the PK studies, 56% were ≥65 years. A total of 276 patients were aged 65.74 
years and 156 patients were aged 75-84 years. 
Impaired hepatic function 
In  the  PoP  PK  analysis,  hepatic  impairment  was  not  identified  to  significantly  influence  the  PK  of 
daratumumab in mild hepatic impairment. 
Gender 
The geometric mean values for Cycle 3 Day 1 Ctrough for males versus females were 433 μg/mL (N=146) 
and 407 μg/mL (N=108) in the daratumumab IV monotherapy group, and 476 μg/mL (N=150) and 539 
μg/mL (N=138) in the daratumumab SC monotherapy group, respectively 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/273138/2020  
Page 34/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In combination therapy, the geometric mean values for Ctrough after 6 weekly doses for males versus 
females were 441 μg/mL (N=124) and 542 μg/mL (N=75), respectively. The overall exposures did not 
overlap between the 2 groups in combination therapy. 
Race 
Race  did  not  have  clinically  relevant  effects  on  daratumumab  exposure.  Table  15  describes  the 
distribution of race within each study included in the Pop PK population. 
Table 9 
Study MMY1008 investigated the PK of daratumuma SC in 6 Japanese patients which was comparable 
to the across-study exposure (Table 20 Section 2.1.8). In addition, race was not a significant covariate 
in the Pop PK analysis. The Forest plot showed an increased Ctrough (about 30%) in non-white 
compared to white race. This effect was not observed after IV (16 mg/kg) administration. 
Weight 
The  flat-dose  administration  of  daratumumab  SC  achieved  adequate  exposure  for  all  body  weight 
subgroups,  as  the  maximum  Ctrough  (Cycle  3  Day  1  predose)  exceeded  the  236  μg/mL  threshold 
previously established in daratumumab IV studies as necessary for 99% target saturation. 
The mean observed concentrations of daratumumab for the lower body weight subgroup (≤65 kg) were 
approximately  60%  higher  in  the  daratumumab  SC  group  than  the  daratumumab  IV  group  based  on 
arithmetic  mean  ratios.  The  higher  exposure  in  this  subgroup  was  maintained  in  later  cycles  and  at 
steady state. The mean concentration of daratumumab in the higher body weight subgroup (>85 kg) 
was  approximately  12%  lower  at  Cycle  3  Day  1  predose,  in  the  daratumumab  SC  group  than  the 
daratumumab IV group. At later cycles, the concentrations were comparable.

Figure 4 
Weight was a significant covariate in the Pop PK analysis. Mean observed Ctrough was about 60% higher 
in  the  lower  bodyweight  sub-group  (≤65  kg)  in  the  SC  group  as  compared  to  the  IV  group  in  Study 
MMY3012. In the >85 kg sub-group, exposure was 12% lower at Cycle 3 Day 1 after SC but similar to 
IV at later cycles. This is further discussed in other parts of this report. 
Elderly 
In the daratumumab SC monotherapy group, the geometric mean values for Cycle 3 Day 1 Ctrough for 
age subgroups were: <65 years of age (468 μg/mL, N=127), ≥65 to <75 years (534 μg/mL, N=106), 
and ≥75 years (542 μg/mL, N=55). In the combination therapy dataset, the geometric mean values for 
Ctrough after 6 weekly doses were <65 years of age (458 μg/mL, N=76), ≥65 to <75 years (482 μ
g/mL, N=74), and ≥75 years (497 μg/mL, N=49).

Of all patients included in the PK studies, 56% were ≥65 years. A total of 276 patients were aged 65-
74 years and 156 patients were aged 75-84 years. Only 3 patients included in the PK studies were ≥85 
years thus no conclusion can be made separately for this age-group. However, a sufficient number of 
elderlies was included in the study, and therefore no dose adjustment is necessary on the basis of age. 
Children 
Daratumumab SC is intended for treatment of multiple myeloma that develops in adults 
(predominately elderly). No children were included in the daratumumab SC program. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No interaction studies were conducted with daratumumab SC.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Multiple mechanisms of action have been observed for daratumumab including complement dependent 
cytotoxicity, antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity, antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis, 
and direct cytotoxicity by induction of apoptosis by Fc-γ receptor mediated crosslinking of tumor-bound 
monoclonal antibodies (Overdijk 2016).  
No mechanism of action studies were included in the current submission.

The  simulated  typical  PK  profiles  for  daratumumab  SC  1800  mg  and  daratumumab  IV  16  mg/kg 
administered according to the approved monotherapy dose schedule (every week for 8 weeks, every 2 
weeks for 16 weeks, and then every 4 weeks thereafter) are presented in Figure 7. 
Figure 5 
 The 
simulated target saturation over time after daratumumab SC 1800 mg and daratumumab IV 16 mg/kg 
is shown in Figure 8. The target saturation with the daratumumab SC dose was similar to that with the 
daratumumab IV dose, which remained >96% over time. This shows that once the initial once weekly 
dose schedule rapidly established efficacious concentrations, dosing frequencies of every 2 weeks and 
every 4 weeks produced serum concentrations that maintained target saturation (Figure 8). 
Figure 6 
None of the investigated intrinsic factors (ie, age, sex, race, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and 
ECOG  status)  had  clinically  relevant  effects  on  the  exposure  to  daratumumab.  Consistent  with  the 
findings from previous IV studies, although subjects with IgG myeloma or subjects with lower baseline 
albumin concentrations appeared to have lower exposure, clinical analyses demonstrated that the lower 
daratumumab concentrations in subjects with IgG myeloma and subjects with lower baseline albumin 
Assessment report

values had no clinically relevant effect on efficacy. Therefore, no dose adjustment is recommended based 
on  any  of  these  factors.  Similar  patterns  for  the  effect  of  IgG  and  albumin  concentrations  have  been 
observed in the previous studies for daratumumab IV monotherapy. 
The population PK and E-R analyses provided the following scientific and quantitative justification for the 
selected flat-dose daratumumab SC 1800 mg dose: 
•  At the recommended dose of daratumumab SC 1800 mg, and the same dosing schedule as 
daratumumab IV 16 mg/kg, the predicted target saturation at the maximal trough 
concentrations was highly consistent (ie, >97.5%) across different body-weight subgroups 
although there may be some difference in the predicted maximal trough concentrations among 
the subgroups.  
•  Across body-weight range, the maximum Ctrough (Cycle 3 Day 1 predose) was higher than the 
concentration at 99% effect of 253 μg/mL for the majority of subjects. 
• 
The clinical primary analysis demonstrated that daratumumab 1800 mg was well tolerated: the 
E-R analyses of AEs showed that there were flat E-R relationships for IRRs and neutropenia. 
Immunogenicity: The incidence of treatment-emergent anti-daratumumab antibodies for daratumumab 
SC treatment was low, with 1 of 426 subjects (0.2%) being positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). The 
1  subject  in  monotherapy  who  was  positive  for  anti-daratumumab  also  had  transient  neutralizing 
antibodies. There were no treatment-emergent anti-daratumumab positive subjects in the combination 
therapy  study  (MMY2040).  Daratumumab  exposure  was  comparable  in  subjects  that  were  antibody 
negative and those with anti-daratumumab antibodies or NAbs. See Table 17. 
Table 11 
• 
•  A total of 18 of 420 (4.3%) subjects were positive for anti-rHuPH20 antibodies at baseline prior 
to  administration  of  daratumumab  SC.  The  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  non-neutralizing 
anti-rHuPH20  antibodies  was  6.4%  (27/420),  with  6.9%  (16/233)  in  the  monotherapy

daratumumab  SC  groups,  and  5.9%  (11/187)  in  the  pooled  combination  daratumumab  SC 
groups.  
2.4.3.2.  Secondary pharmacology 
Neutropenia 
In monotherapy studies, the event rate of neutropenia (any grade and Grade 3 or higher) was higher in 
subjects with lower body weights following daratumumab SC compared with subjects with lower body 
weights following daratumumab IV (Figure 9).  
Figure 7 
Given lower body weight subjects have higher exposure, the probability of neutropenia with increasing 
exposure  was  evaluated.  The  E-R  analysis  using  the  exposure  metrics  of  Cmax  after  first  dose  (not 
confounded by dose interruption or dose delay) demonstrated that there was no apparent relationship 
between  incidence  of  neutropenia  and  daratumumab  exposure  after  daratumumab  SC  1800  mg 
monotherapy (Figure 10, Figure 11).

Figure 8 
Figure 9 
Although  slightly  higher  neutropenia  rates  were  observed  at  lower  body  weights  following  the 
daratumumab SC 1800 mg administration a flat relationship was observed with body weight for both 
infections (any grade) and infections (Grade 3 or higher) (Figure 12). 
Assessment report

Page 41/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10 
The incidence rate of neutropenia (any grade and Grade 3 or higher) was increasing with lower body 
weights following daratumumab SC. The mean rate of neutropenia (any grade and grade 3 or higher) 
was similar across exposure quartiles for IV and SC, however the confidence interval for the highest 
exposure subgroup expressed as Cmax after the first dose (<254 ng/mL) was markedly increased 
following SC administration. This was effect was not present after multiple dosing. There was no 
relation between incidence of infections and body weight following daratumumab IV or SC. 
2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or 
substances  
Combination therapy with daratumumab SC 1800 mg and common small molecule treatment for multiple 
myeloma was studied in Study 2040 (N=122) in three study cohorts: 
•  D-VRd  (multiple  myeloma  transplant  eligible):  bortezomib,  lenalidomide,  and  low  dose 
dexamethasone, dosing once weekly for Cycles 1-3 and a single dose on Day 1 of Cycle 4 (21-
day cycles). 
•  D-VMP  (multiple  myeloma  ineligible  for  transplant):  bortezomib,  melphalan,  and  prednisone, 
daratumumab dosing once weekly for Cycle 1 followed by every 3 weeks for Cycles 2-9, then 
every 4 weeks thereafter (42-day cycles for Cycles 1-9 and 28-day cycles thereafter). 
•  D-Rd  (relapsed or  refractory  multiple  myeloma):  lenalidomide,  and  low  dose  dexamethasone, 
daratumumab dosing once weekly for Cycles 1 and 2 followed by every 2 weeks for Cycles 3-6, 
then every 4 weeks thereafter (28-day cycles). 
PK  results  across  studies  (mono-  and  combination  therapy)  are  tabulated  in  Section  2.1.8  Table 
“Amendment 3”).  The simulated trough concentrations following six weekly doses of daratumumab SC 
1800 mg for combination therapies were compared with that for monotherapy in Figure 13.

Page 42/132 
 
 
 
 
Figure 11 
Daratumumab SC in combination with common small molecule treatment of multiple myeloma was 
studied in study MMY2040. The mean Ctrough at Cycle 3 Day 1 was comparable between treatment 
cohorts D-VMP, D-Rd and D-VRd (392, 526 and 450 µg/mL respectively) and slightly lower than mean 
Ctrough after monotherapy, 593 µg/mL (Study MMY3012). This effect on PK was not considered 
clinical relevant, which is supported.  
No data on the effect of concomitant treatment with antivirals, antibacterials, analgesics and other 
medicinal products commonly used in patients with multiple myeloma were submitted. 
2.4.5.  Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The purpose of the exposure-response analysis was to supplement the evidence of efficacy and safety 
of daratumumab in the subjects after SC injection of daratumumab co-formulated with rHuPH20 and to 
confirm the selected SC dose of 1800 mg.  
The  E-R  analysis  for  daratumumab  monotherapy  was  based  on  data  from  studies  MMY1004  Part  2, 
MMY1008  and  MMY3012;  the  E-R  analysis  for  combination  therapies  was  based  on  data  from  study 
MMY2040.  
Efficacy 
Examination of the relationship between ORR and maximum trough concentrations suggested a similar 
exposure-efficacy relationship between daratumumab SC and daratumumab IV. See “Box Plot”. Cross-
study comparisons with data from Studies MMY3003 (in which subjects received DRd) and MMY3007 (in 
which subjects received D-VMP) indicated a similar E-R relationship for efficacy between daratumumab 
SC and daratumumab IV for both DRd and D-VMP combinations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/273138/2020  
Page 43/132 
 
 
 
  
Figure 12 
Daratumumab SC produced higher trough concentrations in both responders and nonresponders, and 
slightly higher ORRs compared with the approved daratumumab IV (Figure 15). 
For combination therapy, a high ORR was observed across the studied concentration range, indicating 
that  maximum  efficacy  in  terms  of  ORR  were  attained  for  daratumumab  SC  1800  mg.  Cross-study 
comparisons for DRd group with Study MMY3003 (daratumumab IV, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) 
and  for  D-VMP  with  Study  MMY3007  (daratumumab  IV,  bortezomib,  melphalan,  and  prednisone) 
indicated a similar E-R relationship for efficacy for daratumumab SC as for daratumumab IV, for both 
DRd and D-VMP combinations. 
Safety 
The E-R relationship for safety was explored for selected AEs, including overall SAEs, overall Grade 3 or 
higher TEAEs, and neutropenia. Both the peak daratumumab concentrations after the first dose, and the 
overall  peak  concentrations  were  investigated  for  their  potential  relationship  with  the  other  AEs.  To 
mitigate the effect from dose interruption, modification or discontinuation, peak concentrations (Cmax) 
after first dose was used as an exposure metric. See Figure “Rate of SAE..”. No relationship was observed 
between  exposure  and  safety  endpoints  (SAEs  and  Grade  3  or  higher  TEAEs)  using  the  peak 
concentrations after the first dose. For combination of daratumumab SC with bortezomib, lenalidomide, 
and dexamethasone (VRd), VMP, and lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd), no E-R relationship for safety 
was observed.

To  mitigate  the  impact  of  route  of  administration  on  daratumumab  exposures,  the  MAH  performed 
additional exposure-safety analyses to assess the probability of serious AEs and Grade 3 or higher TEAEs 
in  relation  to  predicted  peak  concentration  after  first  dose,  based  on  exposure  quartiles  defined  for 
daratumumab IV and SC administration separately.

2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A validated electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassay was used for quantitation of daratumumab 
in serum samples. Carry-over was not investigated. Bioanalysis of daratumumab SC in studies 
MMY1004, MMY1008, MMY2040 and MMY3012 was performed at Frontage Satellite Laboratory in 
Exton, PA or in-house at Janssen. The method was cross-validated between sites. The in-study 
performance of the daratumumab assay was overall considered acceptable for daratumumab SC. For 
the SC program, the Applicant has agreed to re-assess immunogenicity of daratumumab by re-analysis 
of ADA samples taken in studies MMY1004, MMY1008, MMY3012 and MMY2040 using the new PandA 
screening assay. The tissue permeability enhancer rHuPH20 was not measurable in serum according to 
the Applicant and no bioanalysis of rHuPH20 was performed. rHuPH20 immunogenicity was assessed 
by use of validated assay.  
Standard software and methods were used for pharmacokinetic data analysis. The Pop PK population 
consisted of data from 742 patients or 5305 data points. BLQ data (less than 3% of the data set) was 
excluded by the M1 method for parameter estimation but included in the final dataset. The exponents 
for weight on clearance and volume are 1.24 and 0.91; which is different to those expected for 
allometry (0.75 and 1, respectively). The intra-individual variability is moderate, 34.8%. The inter-
individual variability is high (>36%) for all PK parameters. GoF plots showed a number of data points 
<1000 hrs with CWRES outside the ±5 limits. The Applicant did an additional sensitivity analysis, 
excluding 22 outliers with CWRES ≥5 in the final population PK model. The exclusion did change the 
estimates of the parameters slightly and did improve precision of the model. The effect was largest at 
the highest concentrations (Cmax). However, as there were outlier concentrations from both IV and SC 
administrations, it is considered acceptable that they are included in the final model as they would not 
impact the non-inferiority evaluation.   
VPCs showed the model underpredicted long term exposure (after 1500 hrs) with wide confidence 
intervals. Similar trends were shown for both IV and SC data thus the model predicted daratumumab 
SC concentrations with similar precision as daratumumab IV. Therefore, the final Pop PK model is 
considered acceptable for predicting daratumumab SC exposure metrics. Immunogenicity was not 
evaluated as a covariate in the Pop PK analysis. However, exposure profiles did not seem to be 
affected in the ADA positive subjects (n=2 and 20 for ADA against daratumumab and rHuPH20, 
respectively).  
Sex, IgG myeloma, baseline albumin and weight were identified as significant covariates for 
daratumumab SC exposure. No dose modifications were recommended. This is agreed except for 
weight. It was agreed that data available for patients above 120 are limited to make any dose 
recommendation. This is reflected in the SmPC of the product and the company has committed to 
submit efficacy data from ongoing studies in the subgroup of patients.  
The rate of absorption was estimated to 0.012 h-1 based on Pop PK. No formal bioavailability study was 
performed. The bioavailability after SC injection was estimated to 68.9% by Pop PK. All clinical 
daratumumab SC data included in the Pop PK population used the commercial SC formulation. No 
bioequivalence studies were conducted. Food effect was not investigated. The mean volume of 
distribution was estimated to 5,25 L (V1) and 3.78 L (V2) by Pop PK analysis. The Pop PK estimated 
linear clearance is 4.96 mL/h and the associated mean half-life 20.4 days. After combination therapy, 
the half-life ranged from 23-27 days. In studies, steady-state was reached after 5 months at the 
proposed dose schedule for daratumumab SC monotherapy. Daratumumab is biotransformed as other 
endogenous IgG’s. Variations in drug metabolising enzymes are not expected to affect the elimination 
of daratumumab. Dose proportionality was evaluated between doses 1200 mg SC (n=4) and 1800 mg 
SC in study MMY1004, using the explorative formulation Dara-MD. The commercial formulation Dara-
CF gave about 30% higher exposure than the Dara-MD formulation following 1800 mg SC for 8 weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/273138/2020  
Page 46/132 
 
 
 
For daratumumab IV formulation, dose proportionality has been shown for doses ≥1 mg/kg. The MAH 
argues that the PK profiles for Dara-CF and Dara-MD SC are similar to daratumumab IV, and that the 
time- and concentration-dependent PK are similar. It was agreed that this supports dose 
proportionality between 1200 mg SC and 1800 mg SC.  
Daratumumab elimination showed both dose- and time-dependent clearance. Clearance decreased 
with increasing doses and with multiple dosing due to target depletion. Daratumumab SC accumulated 
over time with an accumulation ratio of 4.8 and 5.4, after eight weekly doses at 1800 mg SC, for Cmax 
and AUC0-7, respectively. The intra-individual variability determined by PopPK is moderate (34.8%), 
while the inter-individual variability is moderate to high for PK parameters (36.9% for V1, 58.7% for 
CL, 67.4 for Vmax, 145.9% Kdes and 36.1% for Ka). The inter-individual variability for exposure 
parameters ranged from 37.8% to 50.8% in Study MMY1004 with rich PK sampling. All clinical studies 
in the daratumumab SC program were conducted in patients with multiple myeloma.  
Observed mean exposure (Ctrough at Cycle 3 Day 1) was comparable after SC and IV administration in 
Study MMY3012. This exposure level was also comparable to the simulated Cycle 3 Day 1 Ctrough by 
Pop PK analyses. AUC0-7d was simulated in Cycle 1 after 1st weekly dose to 720 and 1187 µg/mL×day 
and prior to Cycle 3 Day 1 to 4017 and 4019 µg/mL×day for daratumumab SC and IV respectively. 
AUC0-28d after Q4W dosing (representing steady-state) was simulated to 5887 and 5206 µg/mL×day 
for SC and IV respectively. The simulated increase in AUC at steady-state after SC dosing corresponds 
to 13%. Further safety implications are not expected since the higher steady-state exposure following 
1800 mg SC administration are within exposures observed in daratumumab IV clinical studies. 
Non-inferiority between SC and IV administration was evaluated by means of Ctrough after sparse 
sampling and not AUC. The simulated concentration-time profiles and observed Ctrough values for SC 
and IV were comparable. 
In Study MMY1004 and MMY1008 mean Ctrough values seemed notable higher than observed in Study 
MMY3012 after a similar dosing schedule and formulation. The Applicant argued that differences in 
study characteristics could explain the higher mean Ctrough observed in studies MMY1004 and 
MMY1008 compared to MMY3012. There was a notable smaller sample size in studies MMY1004 (n=25) 
and of MMY1008 (n=6) compared to MMY3012 (n=257). This explanation was accepted. 
In the combination therapy dataset, the geometric mean values for Ctrough after 6 weekly doses were: 
normal  (441  μg/mL,  N=69),  mild  (480  μg/mL,  N=77),  and  moderate  or  severe  (522  μg/mL,  N=53). 
Generally, the moderate renal impairment group had slightly higher Ctrough, but the difference is not 
considered to be significant or clinically meaningful. 
Very few subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment were represented in the daratumumab 
SC program in both the monotherapy (N=0) and combination therapy (N=1) dataset to make meaningful 
conclusions for daratumumab SC dosing for these hepatic subgroups. This is also reflected in the SmPC 
of the product. 
In the pooled population PK analyses of daratumumab SC in subjects with multiple myeloma, gender 
had a statistically significant effect on V1. However, it did not have a significant overall effect on exposure 
and is not considered to have clinical relevance. 
No interaction studies were conducted with daratumumab SC. Daratumumab is biotransformed like 
other endogenous IgGs. No interactions with concomitant medications are expected. 
Exposure-response  relationships  were  investigated  by  means  of  exploratory  regression  models. 
Simulations showed a similar target saturation with the daratumumab SC 1800 mg dosing schedule as 
observed for the approved daratumumab IV dosing schedule for multiple myeloma.

The  baseline  and  treatment-emergent  immunogenicity  incidence  for  anti-rHuPH20  antibodies  were 
consistent with literature reports (Rosengren 2015) and as seen for Rituxan Hycela and Herceptin Hylecta 
Daratumumab  exposure  was  comparable  between  antibody  negative  subjects  and  those  with  anti-
rHuPH20 antibodies.  
The incidence rate of neutropenia (any grade and Grade 3 or higher) was increasing with lower body 
weights following daratumumab SC. The mean rate of neutropenia (any grade and grade 3 or higher) 
was  similar  across  exposure  quartiles  for  IV  and  SC,  however  the  confidence  interval  for  the  highest 
exposure  subgroup  expressed  as  Cmax  after  the  first  dose  (<254  ng/mL)  was  markedly  increased 
following SC administration. This was effect was not present after multiple dosing. There was no relation 
between incidence of infections and body weight following daratumumab IV or SC. 
Daratumumab  SC  in  combination  with  common  small  molecule  treatment  of  multiple  myeloma  was 
studied  in  study  MMY2040.  The  mean  Ctrough  at  Cycle  3  Day  1  was  comparable  between  treatment 
cohorts D-VMP, D-Rd and D-VRd (392, 526 and 450 µg/mL respectively) and slightly lower than mean 
Ctrough after monotherapy, 593 µg/mL (Study MMY3012). This effect on PK was not considered clinical 
relevant,  which  is  supported.  No  studies  on  the  effect  of  concomitant  treatment  with  antivirals, 
antibacterials,  analgesics  and  other  medicinal  products  commonly  used  in  patients  with  multiple 
myeloma were submitted. Daratumumab acts through multiple MoA’s and are eliminated independent of 
CYPs, hence genetic differences are not expected to result in different PD responses. 
Responders (ORR) had slightly higher exposure compared to non-responders with no difference for SC 
or  IV.  According  to  the  Applicant,  no  relation  was  established  between  safety  end  points  and 
daratumumab exposure. This is not agreed. The probability for adverse events was slightly lower for SC 
compared  to  IV  across  concentration  quartiles,  with  a  trend  of  less  events  with  increasing  exposure. 
Patients after SC treatment in the high exposure quartile Q4 had a lower probability for Serious AEs but 
notable higher probability of Grade 3 or higher TEAE’s as compared to IV. Overall, there appeared to be 
no apparent trend of increase in the probability of Grade 3 or higher  TEAEs with increase daratumumab 
SC exposure when the totality of data was evaluated (from  Q1 to Q4)  
The clinical pharmacology was adequately addressed. 
2.4.7.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology for daratumumab SC was described in 4 clinical studies in patients with 
multiple myeloma: MMY1004, MMY1008, MMY2040 and MMY3012. The bioanalysis and PK evaluation 
was overall acceptable. Evaluation of immunogenicity status of daratumumab SC was not considered 
acceptable and should be re-assessed using a newly developed analytical method. 
Non-inferiority between SC and IV administration was evaluated by means of Ctrough after sparse 
sampling and not AUC. The simulated concentration-time profiles and observed Ctrough values for SC 
and IV were comparable. Non-inferiority was established between the approved daratumumab IV dose 
regimen (16 mg/kg) and daratumumab SC (1800 mg) based on sparse sampling Ctrough as exposure 
metric and not AUC. Similar significant covariates were identified for daratumumab SC as for IV with 
no recommendations for dose modification. Concomitant daratumumab SC with common small 
molecule treatment for multiple myeloma was evaluated in Study 2040. The proposed dosing 
schedules resulted in similar daratumumab exposure levels. It was agreed that data available for 
patients above 120 kg body weight are too limited to make any dose recommendation. This is reflected 
in the SmPC of the product and the company has committed to submit efficacy data from ongoing 
studies in the subgroup of patients. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology:

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical studies which provide the basis for evaluation of the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) 
daratumumab in Multiple Myeloma (MM), consists of the pivotal phase 3 study MMY3012 of 
monotherapy daratumumab, and the phase 2 study MMY2040, where daratumumab is combined with 
standard background therapies in MM. Further two supportive studies have been submitted.

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The Phase 1b study MMY1004, is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter, dose escalation study 
(Part 1) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and anti-tumor activity of SC daratumumab with 
rHuPH20 to subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Two doses of daratumumab (1200 
and 1800 mg) in an intermediate SC formulation were evaluated. Eligible patients had to be ≥18 years 
of age with documented MM and had undergone prior treatment with ≥2 lines of anti-myeloma therapy. 
Prior lines of therapy must have included a PI and an IMiD. 
A total of 53 patients were included in the Part 1 using a mix- and deliver preparation, 8 subjects in 
the 1200 mg group and 45 subjects in the 1800 mg group. The 1800 mg dose level provided similar or 
higher exposure to IV 16 mg/kg daratumumab and was therefore selected for further investigation. 
Part 2 (dose confirmation) of Study MMY1004 tested a final, co-formulated preparation of a flat dose of 
daratumumab and rHuPH20, 1800 mg of the same investigational product examined in Study 
MMY3012. The schedule was identical to that used for all daratumumab SC studies, including Study 
MMY3012. The peak plasma concentrations of daratumumab SC occurred approximately 72 hours after 
injection, whereas peak plasma concentration with IV administration occurred at or near the end of the 
infusion. Assessments of tumor response and disease progression were conducted in accordance with 
the IMWG response criteria. A validated computerized algorithm based on IMWG criteria was used to 
determine response and disease progression for each subject. No formal statistical hypothesis testing 
was conducted. 
Response rates and the safety profile (including immunogenicity) for daratumumab SC in Study 
MMY1004 appeared similar to the approved IV formulation of daratumumab. The incidence of IRRs was 
16%. These results indicated that flat dosing of daratumumab (1800 mg) via SC administration is a 
feasible approach and could bring benefits in terms of reduced administration time and IRRs compared 
with daratumumab IV. Based on data from studies MMY1004 and MMY1008, daratumumab SC 1800 
mg was selected for further evaluation in Phase 2 and 3 studies. 
The dose-response study MMY1004 was performed using an experimental, not the commercial 
daratumumab-MD formulation, at the dose levels 1200 mg and 1800 mg. Only four patients received 
the 1200 mg dose of daratumumab-MD. 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Monotherapy MMY3012 
The  Study  MMY3012  is  a  Phase  3,  randomized,  open-label,  active-controlled,  multicenter  study 
comparing monotherapy of the SC formulation of daratumumab to the IV formulation in subjects with 
Multiple myeloma who had received at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a PI and an IMiD, or whose 
disease was double refractory to both a PI and an IMiD. The planned total sample size was approximately 
480 subjects, randomly assigned to the Dara-SC group or the Dara-IV group in a 1:1 ratio. 
The randomization will be stratified by body weight at baseline ≤ 65 kg, 66 kg to 85 kg, >85 kg), number 
of prior lines of therapy (≤ 4 prior lines versus >4 prior lines) and type of myeloma (IgG versus non-
IgG). The data cutoff for the primary analysis occurred on 08 January 2019, approximately 6 months 
after the last subject was randomized.  
The aim of the study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of SC daratumumab to IV daratumumab with 
comparable efficacy between both formulations and no clinically meaningful difference in safety except 
from a lower rate of IRRs for daratumumab SC.  
A schematic overview of the study design is provided in Figure 15.

Treatments 
Dara-SC  will  be  provided as  a  fixed-dose  of  1800  mg  (combination  drug  product  containing  rHuPH20 
drug substance (2000 U/mL) and daratumumab drug substance (120 mg/mL)), the volume being 15 ml 
administered  by  manual  push  over  3-5  minutes  in  the  abdominal  SC  tissue  in  left/right  locations, 
alternating between individual doses. Dara-IV will be provided as in previous studies and according to 
the SmPC.  
The  dose  and  schedule  of  daratumumab,  bortezomib,  lenalidomide,  melphalan,  prednisone  and 
dexamethasone  are  in  line  with  clinical  practice  and  acceptable.  The  guidelines  for  prevention  and 
management of infusion-related reactions due to daratumumab are in line with clinical practice and the 
SmPC, (see the AR for details). 
Study MMY 3012  
Each treatment cycle is 28 days. Study drug will be administered once weekly in Cycles 1 and 2, every 
2 weeks in Cycles 3 to 6, and then every 4 weeks thereafter. Tight visit windows (±1 day) are required 
for Day 1 in the first 3 treatment cycles because of the co-primary endpoint assessments at those 
visits. Changes to within-cycle dosing should not affect Day 1 of the next cycle.  
 Table 13 
For dose delays and modification, see protocol for details.  
Study MMY 2040  
D-VMP Cohort: The Treatment Phase consist of 9 cycles of the VMP regimen (1 Cycle = 6 weeks) with 
daratumumab. Thereafter, subjects will receive daratumumab monotherapy in 28-day cycles and 
continue to receive study drugs until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons.   
Table 14 
Prednisone  will  not  be  given  on  days  that  dexamethasone  is  given  as  pre-medication.  Instead, 
dexamethasone will serve as the treatment dose of corticosteroid for Day 1 of Cycles 1 through 9 
D-Rd  Cohort:  Each  treatment  cycles  is  approximately  28  days  and  subjects  will  continue  to  receive 
study drugs until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons.

Table 15 
During  weeks  when  the  subject  receives  an  administration of  daratumumab, half  the  dexamethasone 
dose will be given on the day of administration via IV or PO administration before the administration and 
half the dose will be given via PO administration the day after the administration. This is applicable only 
for subjects taking the full 40-mg dose. Subjects on the 20-mg dose should receive the entire 20 mg 
prior  to  daratumumab  administration.  During  weeks  when  no  daratumumab  administration  is 
administered, dexamethasone will be administered at a dose of 40 mg/week PO (or 20 mg/week PO for 
subjects ≥75 years or BMI <18.5). 
D-VRd Cohort : The Treatment Phase consist of 4 cycles of approximately 21 days. Subjects in the D-
VRd cohort will continue to receive the study drugs for a maximum of 4 cycles (see Table 22), if disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons, the subject will discontinue treatment before the 4 
cycles are completed. 
Table 16 
For subjects with creatinine clearance between 30 and 60 mL/min, the dose of Lenalidomide is 10 mg 
every 24 hours.  
Bortezomib must be administered after the daratumumab administration and may be up to 48 hours, 
however subsequent doses must be adjusted to account for the delay. 
Dexamethasone  will  be  administered  at  20  mg  weekly  for  subjects  ≥75  years  of  age  or  underweight 
(body mass index [BMI] <18.5). If dexamethasone is given on the daratumumab dosing day, then this 
will serve as the premedication and no additional dexamethasone administration will be needed.

•  VGPR or better rate, (D-VMP and D-Rd cohort) 
•  ORR (D-VRd cohort) 
•  Duration of response (DOR) 
•  MRD Negative Rate 
All responses are according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria. 
The primary endpoint ORR is fully acceptable in the monotherapy study of daratumumab comparing the 
SC and the IV formulation, as well as for the combination studies D-VMP and D-Rd cohorts. However, 
for the D-VRd group, the primary endpoint is VGPR or better. The MAH has justified, that historical data 
showed, that the ORR for  patients treated with VRd and eligible  for  autologous  stem  cell  transplant 
(ASCT) was 97% or higher. In order to allow assessment of a clinical benefit of adding daratumumab to 
the VRd backbone regimen, the MAH therefore decided to use VGPR or better as primary endpoint. This 
is acceptable. 
The MAH has formulated several clinically relevant secondary endpoints in both studies. The MAH has 
planned  to  evaluate  MRD  negativity  rate  in  subjects  who  received  D-VMP  and  D-Rd.  The  MAH  has 
clarified, that due to the shortness of the study of D-VRd in transplant  eligible patients, only 3 months 
of treatment, they considered it not appropriate to require patients to undergo a bone marrow procedure 
for MRD analysis.   
Sample size 
Study MMY3012 
Non-inferiority of Dara SC to Dara IV was defined using a 60% retention of the lower bound (20.8%) of 
the 95% CI of ORR from Study MMY2002. In the clinical Study MMY2002, a study of 106 subjects with 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least 3 prior therapies and who were treated 
with Dara IV 16 mg/kg, an ORR of 29.2% (95% CI: 20.8%, 38.9%) was observed. The clinical relevance 
of the 60% retention of ORR was justified based on the benefit/risk of Dara SC and a strong indication 
of similar efficacy from early efficacy and pharmacokinetics data. With a planned 1:1 randomization, 480 
subjects (n=240 in the Dara SC group and n=240 in the Dara IV group) will be needed to demonstrate 
non-inferiority with a power of 80% and a one-sided alpha=0.025, assuming that the true ORR is the 
same for both groups. The sample size calculation is based on the methodology for the non-inferiority 
test for non-unity null, as described by Farrington and Manning (1990).  
The study recruited 263 subjects in the Dara SC group and 259 subjects in the Dara IV group, 522 in 
total. The enrolment of the extra 42 Japanese subjects beyond the initially planned 480 subjects was to 
meet a health authority commitment request. 
The study is also designed to establish comparability of maximum 
 between Dara SC and Dara IV. 
The  selection  of  non-inferiority  margin  and  the  choice  of  alpha  level  follow  the  convention  for 
Ctrough
bioequivalence  studies.  The  two  formulations  of  daratumumab  will  be  considered  similar  if  the  lower 
 on Cycle 3 Day 1 is at least 80% 
bound of the 90% CI for the ratio of the geometric means of 
(noninferiority  margin  of  20%).  A  one-sided  test  is  selected  based  on  previous  analyses  that 
 and  efficacy.  However,  there  is  no 
demonstrated  a  strong  relationship  between  maximum 
Ctrough
apparent  relationship  between  drug  exposure  in  the  therapeutic  dose  range  and  adverse  events  of 
Ctrough
interest. With a planned 1:1 randomization, 480 subjects, and a one-sided alpha=0.05, the power will 
be >95%. This assumes a true ratio of the 
 of 1, a non-inferiority margin of at least 80% of the 
geometric mean ratio and a coefficient of variation of 0.6.

Study MMY2040 
Table 17 
In the study MM2040 combination study a naïve comparison with historical trials will be performed. The 
MAH did not specify which method was used to calculate the confidence interval and neither whether the 
estimate or the lower bound of the confidence interval will be used for the comparison.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Randomization 1:1 in the study MMY3012 was centralized computer-generated, block randomization 
was applied based on the stratification factors: body weight at baseline (≤65 kg, 66 kg to 85 kg, >85 
kg), number of prior lines of therapy (≤4 prior lines versus >4 prior lines), and type of myeloma (IgG 
versus  non-IgG).  Study  MMY2040  is  a  single  arm  study  and  therefore  randomization  was  not 
applicable. Both studies are open-label, it is acceptable that they are not blinded.  
Statistical methods 
The method described by Farrington and Manning (1990) for the non-inferiority of non-unity null is used. 
In the Study MMY3012, the response is measured during or after treatment with study drug but at or 
prior to the start of subsequent anticancer therapy. Therefore, the primary estimand is discussing the 
treatment effect in a scenario where patients could discontinue the daratumuab treatment but are not 
allowed to switch to other anticancer therapies before PD. Non-inferiority of daratumumab SC will be 
declared if both ORR and Cthough are meet.  The objective of the study is to assess the comparability of 
daratumumab  SC  and  daratumumab  IV  without  the  influence  of  subsequent  therapy.    Two  different 
strategies  are  used  to  handle  intercurrent  events.  Observations  that  occurred  after  treatment 
discontinuation but before starting a new anticancer therapy were included in the analysis (treatment 
policy). Observations occurred after starting a new anti-cancer therapy were not included in the analysis 
(hypothetical  strategy).  The  handling  of  intercurrent  events  is  concordant  with  the  objectives  of  the 
study. Supplementary estimands were requested during the assessment to contextualize the results. 
Given  that  the  objective  of  the  study  is  to  demonstrate,  at  least,  non-inferiority  of  daratumumab  SC 
relative to daratumumab IV, a hypothetical estimand considering the per-protocol population will also 
be evaluated during the assessment.  
For the Study MMY2040,  
the MAH clarified  that  the  primary  estimand  in  Study  MMY2040  is  the  best  response  rate  (ORR  or 
VGPR  or  better)  prior  to  any  subsequent  anticancer  therapy  for  multiple  myeloma  but  ignoring 
treatment discontinuation (any component of the  combination treatment). The  ORR  or rate of VGPR 
or better reported in the Study MMY2040 CSR for D-VRd, D-VMP, and D-Rd  cohorts  were  based  on 
disease  evaluations  prior  to  start  of  subsequent  anticancer  therapy  for  multiple  myeloma,  which 
reflected  response  to  the  study  treatment  without  confounding  the  impact of subsequent therapy. 
It  is  acceptable,  that  for  both  studies,  MMY3012  and  MMY2040,  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  will  be 
based  on  the  results  of  a  validated  computerized  algorithm,  based  on  the  IMWG  response  criteria. 
Although all randomized patients analysis set (ITT) is preferred for the efficacy analyses, both the ITT 
and the PP-analysis sets are considered equally important for the non-inferiority analyses.

The co-primary efficacy endpoint of the study MMY 3012 is overall response rate (ORR). Subjects with 
overall responses achieved after the start of subsequent anticancer therapy will not be considered as 
responders.  For  each  response  categories,  two-sided  95%  Clopper-Pearson  exact  confidence  interval 
(CI) will be presented by treatment group. Farrington-Manning (FM) test will be used to test the overall 
response rate. The FM estimate of relative risk with its 2-sided 95% confidence interval and p-value will 
be reported. If the lower bound of the 95% CI is ≥ 60%, the non-inferiority of Dara SC relative to Dara 
IV will be concluded. If non-inferiority in ORR is established and the lower limit of the 95% CI of the 
relative  risk  is  ≥100%,  the  superiority  of  Dara  SC  relative  to  Dara  IV  will  be  concluded.  No  data 
imputation will be applied for missing response data.  
A  sensitivity  analysis  of  ORR  based  on  the  per-protocol  and  response-evaluable  analysis  sets  will  be 
performed in a similar manner as described in the primary analysis. 
A sensitivity analysis of ORR, in which disease response is based on investigator assessment according 
to the IMWG response criteria, will also be performed in a similar manner as in the primary analysis. 
A supplementary analysis of ORR based on the first 480 randomized subjects in intent-to-treat analysis 
set will also be performed in a similar manner as in the primary analysis. 
 Subjects who switched to another treatment without experiencing PD were censored in the PFS analysis 
at their last observation before starting the new treatment. Many of  the subjects who discontinued did 
so based on unconfirmed PD and clinical suspicion of  progression.  In  several  cases,  investigators  call 
PD  based  on  imaging  or  hypercalcemia,  that  the  algorithm  did  not  agree  with. In the ITT population, 
12 (4.6 %) and 17 (6.5 %) patients switched to other treatment before PD in the Dara IV and Dara SC 
arms, respectively. In the answer to OC 32 the MAH presented sensitivity analysis for PFS  where these 
patients are considered events. The results are consistent with those presented in the primary analysis. 
There  are  14  and  9  patients  who  were  considered  non-evaluable  in  the  Dara  IV  and  Dara  SC  arm, 
respectively.   The MAH explained that 4 subjects never received treatment, 14 subjects discontinued 
before the first post-dose disease assessment and 5 subjects had a first dose closed to the data cut-off 
date and therefore their assessments were not included in the primary analysis.   
The superiority of Dara SC to Dara IV was not demonstrated since the relative risk did not exceed 1, 
therefore only non-inferiority is assessed in this report. 
For the Study MMY2040, the ORR is the primary efficacy endpoint for the D-VMP and D-Rd cohorts, 
and  the  VGPR  or  better  response  rate  is  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  the  D-VRd  cohort.  The 
implementation  of  Clopper-Pearson  exact  90  %  CI  is  agreed  for  each  response  rate.  A  sensitivity 
analysis based on the investigator assessment was planned. According to the CSR (page 31/1897) the 
discontinuation  rate  is  5  (D-VMP),  2  (D-VRd)  and  5  (D-Rd).  The  MAH  clarified  that  according  to  the 
protocol  subjects  who  discontinue  study  treatment  before  disease  progression  will  continue  h ave 
disease  evalu ation   every 4  weeks  until  8  weeks  after  the  final  dose  of  study  drug  at  which 
point  the  subject  will  be  considered as completed in the study. Patients who discontinued treatment 
were  included  in  the  analysis  of  response  rate with their best response. Observations made after the 
patients started a new anti-cancer therapy were ignored. 
There are 1 (D-VRd), 2 (D-VMP) and 2 (D-Rd) patients which are classified as non-evaluable. The MAH 
explained  that  2  subjects  who  are  listed  as  non-evaluable  died  before  the  first  post-baseline 
assessment.  Three  patients  were  hospitalized  with  very  poor  condition  that  did  not  allowed  a  full 
evaluation.

The key secondary endpoints related to IRRs, VGPR or better, ORR and CR or better, were analyzed in 
the same way as the primary endpoint. Stratified CMH test will be used, and the CMH estimate of odds 
ratio and its 2-sided 95% confidence interval and p-value will be reported.  
Analysis of PFS and OS will be performed on the ITT analysis set. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used 
to estimate the distribution of overall PFS and OS for each treatment group. The median PFS and OS 
with 95% CI will be provided, and the distributions between the 2 treatment groups will be compared 
using  the  stratified  log-rank  test.  The  treatment  effect  (hazard  ratio)  and  its  2-sided  95%  CI  will  be 
estimated using a stratified Cox regression model with treatment as the sole explanatory variable.  
Sensitivity analysis were based on investigator assessment according to the IMWG response criteria and 
will be performed in a similar manner as described above. 
Censoring rules for PFS 
Table 18 
The censoring rules are not totally agreed, censoring of patients who did not receive study product and 
without any post-baseline data is accepted since those patients are very few (Dara IV = 1, Dara SC= 1). 
However, censoring patients who switched to other anti-cancer therapies (Dara IV = 12, Dara SC= 17) 
or withdrew consent (Dara IV = 4, Dara SC= 3) or were lost to follow-up (Dara IV = 0, Dara SC= 1) 
before a PFS event is not endorsed. The reason is that treatment discontinuation/switch could be related 
to the study treatment. The MAH presented the following sensitivity analyses:  
1.  Patients  who  discontinued  daratumumab  due  to  any  reason  before  experiencing  a  PFS  event  are 
imputed as PFS events.   
2. Patients who discontinued daratumumab and started a new anticancer therapy before experiencing a 
PFS  event  are  imputed  as  PFS  events.  Patients  who  were  lost  to  follow-up  or  withdrew  consent  are 
censored.  
The results of the requested sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of the censoring rules of PFS were 
concordant with those presented in the primary analysis. 
For  both  analyses,  patients  still ongoing  in  the  trial should  be  censored  (administrative  censoring)  as 
well as patients who did not receive any investigational product and did not have any post-baseline data. 
According to table TEFPFS03 ( CSR page 802) there are no patients censored due to discontinuation due 
to AE and therefore censoring rules are not defined for those patients.  The MAH explained that subjects 
who discontinue study treatment due to an AE but develop confirmed disease progression or who died 
prior  to  the  start  of  other  anticancer  therapy  are  considered  PD  or  death.    A  total  of  39  subjects 
discontinued study treatment due to an AE; 23 of 39 subjects developed confirmed disease progression 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/273138/2020  
Page 61/132 
 
 
 
 
or died, 16 subjects were censored due to receiving other anticancer therapy (9 subjects), withdrawal 
consent to study (1 subject), lost to follow-up (1 subject) or study cut-off (5 subjects).  
Duration of response and the MRD negativity rate for the Study MMY2040, was planned in the SAP but 
not  presented  in  the  submission.  The  MAH  clarified  that  among  responders,  the  median  duration  of 
response could not be estimated for either cohort because most responders were alive and progression-
free  at  the  time  of  the  primary analysis. In addition, the initial IV studies for these combinations have 
extensive  long-term  follow-up. The  MAH presented  MRD  results  during the responses D150.  The  MRD 
results for patients who had a suspected complete response showed 16.4% and 15.4% MRD negativity 
by  the  threshold  of  10-5  for  the  D-VMP  and  D-Rd  groups  respectively,  this  is  reassuring  in  a 
relapse/refractory setting of MM.  
Multiplicity control for the primary and secondary endpoints 
Non-inferiority of Dara SC relative to Dara IV will be claimed if both endpoints of ORR and maximum 
Ctrough  meet  their  criteria.  Therefore,  the  overall  type  I  error  will  be  strictly  controlled  at  level  of 
alpha=0.025 (one-sided). In order to control for multiplicity for several secondary endpoints, the MAH 
used  a  hierarchical  approach.  The  strategy  applied  controls  the  false  positive  rate  at  5  %.  For  Study 
MMY2040, no type I error control strategy was defined, neither in the SAP nor in the protocol. The study 
has only one primary endpoint, and several major secondary endpoints. The p-value of the secondary 
endpoints is not interpretable since the MAH has not planned for a strategy to prevent multiplicity issues.  
The original version of the SAP for study MMY 3012 was dated Feb 6 2018. The SAP was amended in 
Feb 12 2019, and the section regarding the statistical hypotheses was changed. However, the changes 
were not described initially by the MAH. The MAH explained that the only clarification changes were in 
the Amendment 1 of the  SAP.  The MAH also presented the requested document with track-changes. 
The first version of the SAP for study MMY2040 was dated 20 March 2019, and was not amended. It is 
noted  that  the  SAP  was  finalized  posterior  to  the  data  cutoff  date  (4  March  2019).  DoR  was  not 
calculated; however this was not reflected in the SAP. The MAH clarified that the SAP was finalized after 
the data cut-off date and before the database lock. The MAH also wrote in the SAP that DOR may not be 
mature at the time of the primary analysis. 
Table 19 
The discontinuation rate was approximately 57% for both Dara IV and Dara SC. The main reason for 
discontinuation was progressive disease (PD), similar for the Dara SC and the Dara IV arm,43.1% and 
44.2% respectively. A high discontinuation rate due to PD is expected in a study with relapsed/refractory 
MM on monotherapy daratumumab. Adverse events comprised 7.5%, with more AEs in the Dara IV arm. 
The reported “discontinuation due to physician decision” was higher in the Dara SC arm, as compared 
with the Dara IV arm. The main reasons were decline in clinical condition, lack of response or suspicion 
of PD, reasons that are comprehensible in a relapse/refractory setting. No correlation to dosing route or 
treating Principal Investigator was identified.

Table 22 
In  general  the  baseline  demographics  characteristics  are  well  balanced  between  the  two  treatment 
groups. The median age in the total population was 67.0 years with approximately 20% being ≥75 of 
age. More patients were in the range 18 -< 65 years of age in the Dara SC group compared with the 
Dara IV group, 46% versus 38.6%.  A majority of the patients were male (54.6%) and most subjects 
were white (78.2%), and ECOG 0-1. The median weight was 73 kg (range 29-138). A range from 28.6 
- 39 kg is an extremely low weight, The MAH has explained, that a total of 11 patients had a body weight 
below 45 kg, 5 patients in the SC group and 6 patients in the IV group, the MAH has provided narratives 
for all these patients. The protocol did not specify any body weight-based exclusions. It is of concern, 
that  2  patients  had  hepatitis  C  and  chronic  hepatitis  B  respectively  and  some  had  cardio-vascular 
diseases, thus comorbidity combined with older age and low body weight makes these patients highly 
fragile from a clinical point of view. It could be questioned whether some of these patients should have 
been excluded. However discontinuation due to AE and death was similar in both treatment arms, and 
although  small  numbers,  no  safety  concerns  were  raised.  The  fact that  these  fragile  patients  actually 
tolerated several cycles of treatment is reassuring.

The majority of patients had IgG myeloma and had measurable disease in serum only (53.8%) or urine 
only (17%). Patients were evenly distributed across ISS stages, 70.7% and 69.8% had stage I and II in 
the dara IV group compared with the dara SC group. Dara SC group. Most patients had standard risk 
disease, and the baseline disease characteristics are well balanced, except from a higher proportion of 
patients with high risk cytogenetics in the dara SC group, 26.3% vs. 17.3% in the dara IV group.  Median 
time  since  diagnosis  was  5.6  years,  and  patients  had  received  a  median  of  4  prior  lines  of  therapy. 
Approximately 1/3 of the patients had received > 4 lines of therapy, while 2/3 had received ≤ 4 lines. 
One of the inclusion criteria was that patients should have received at least 3 prior lines of chemotherapy 
including a PI and an IMiD. The MAH has clarified that a total of 496 of 522 subjects (95%) had before 
study entry, received at least 3 prior lines of chemotherapy, including a PI or an IMID. The remaining 
26 (5%) were refractory to both a PI and an IMID.  
Patients  included had  received  multiple prior  regimens, all  patients had  previously  received  PI(s)  and 
IMiD(s),  and  84.9%  had  received  prior  bortezomib  and  lenalidomide.  The  use  of  prior  therapies  was 
overall similar between the two treatment groups, except from the use of ASCT. In the dara SC group, 
54.8% were treated with ASCT compared with 46.7% in the dara IV group. This may be related to the 
slightly higher proportion of patients at age 18-<65 years in the dara SC group compared with the dara 
IV group. Approximately 30% were refractory to PI+IMiD+Alky, and a total of 49.4% were refractory to 
both a PI and an IMiD, this is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

confidence, thus the study met its co-primary endpoint, showing dara SC is non-inferior to dara IV. 
The primary results were consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses, incl. PP analysis and response-
evaluable analysis set. 
Subgroup Analyses of Overall Response Rate

Overall, analyses on ORR showed consistent results across the different subgroups. There seem to be 
no difference pertained to type of myeloma (IgG or non-IgG) or to number of prior lines of therapy (≤ 4 
or > 4 lines), except from ORR seemed better for patients who received ≤ 4 prior lines, however this 
subgroup  was  small  and  the  95%  CI  wide.  Body  weight  analyses  of  ORR  showed  consistent  efficacy,

except from the ≤ 65 kg and > 85 kg subgroups. Although small subgroups and a wide 95% CI, there 
seem to be a trend to a better ORR in the Dara SC group. The effect of weight on ORR is discussed in

Numbers of patients in the MMY2040 are few, but the  MAH has updated the results, , two patients did 
not  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  in  the  D-Rd  arm  and  were  considered  major  protocol  deviations,  5 
patients discontinued, 4 due to AEs and 1 due to PD. The update of the results with a data cut-off of 
11 November 2019 added 7.4 months of follow-up. The median  duration of treatment in the  D-VMP  
and  D-Rd  cohorts  was  14.3  and  14.9  months,  respectively. In  the  D-VRd  cohort,  the  median 
treatment  duration  was  
unchanged from the initial SC submission (2.6 months). The  ORR  was  89.6%  for  the  D-VMP  cohort 
(initial  SC  submission:  88.1%) and 93.8% for D-Rd cohort (initial SC submission:  90.8%). The ORR 
for VRd was unchanged at 97% as all subjects had completed or discontinued  the  study  at  the  time 
of  the  initial  SC  submission.  The  depth  of  response  improved  with  a  CR/sCR rate of 47.8% (initial 
SC submission: 17.9%) in the D-VMP cohort and CR/sCR rate of 38.5% (initial SC submission: 18.5%) 
in the D-Rd cohort. 
The MMY2040 protocol was amended a few times, but the amendments were not considered controversial 
to the study. However the table: “Summary of Protocol Amendments” listed on p. 24 in the csr-body-
54767414mmy2040  and  in  the  AR  says:  MMY3012.  The  MAH  confirms  that  the  information  in  the

(CSR) is correct and relevant to Study MMY2040. An erratum has been prepared. 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
The median age was 59 years in the D-VRd group, and 69 and 75 years in the D-Rd and D-VMP group 
respectively.    Approximately  21.5%  of  the  patients  in  the  D-Rd  group  were  ≥75  years  of  age.  Most 
patients are white (56.7%, 68.7% and 69.2% in the D-VRd, D-VMP and D-Rd groups) and the majority 
of  patients  are  male,  71.6%  and  69.2%  (D-VRd  and  D-Rd).  The  median  weight  for  the  3  treatment 
groups was 66-80.6 kg with a wide range: 43- 147.6 kg. Patients were ECOG 0-2 (D-VRd and D-VMP) 
and ECOG 0-1 (D-Rd). In general, the baseline demographics characteristics are well balanced between 
the treatment groups.

Efficacy Results Comparison with Historic IV Studies 
The results from the Study MMY 2040 were compared with historical data from previously submitted IV 
combination studies (MMY3007 and MMY3003), using the Safety Analysis Set to ensure consistency.   
Due  to  the  different  lengths  of  follow-up  between  Study  MMY2040  and  previously  submitted  IV 
combination studies (MMY3007 and MMY3003), ORR data from the first dose of study treatment up to 
the end of Month 6 for each subject was compared across studies: D-VMP cohort (n=67) vs. MMY3007 
IV group (n=346); D-Rd cohort (n=65) vs. MMY3003 IV group (n=283). To ensure consistency across 
studies, the Safety Analysis Set was used for side-by-side comparisons of Study MMY2040 with Studies 
MMY3007 and MMY3003.  
Combination Therapy Study Population, Subject and Enrollment Information 
Subject enrollment information for the primary analysis is summarized above for Study MMY2040 in

Due to the different length of the follow-up period, the ORR data was compared across studies, from the 
first dose of study treatment up to the end of Month 6 for each patient: D-VMP vs. MMY3007 (dara IV + 
VMP) and D-Rd vs. MMY3003 (dara IV + Rd). The ORR results appear similar for dara SC in the D-VMP 
and D-Rd groups when compared with dara IV in the MMY3007 and MMY3003 (Table 10, 11). However, 
data  should  be  interpreted  with  caution,  the  SC  data  are  compared  with  historical  data,patients 
characteristics were not quite similar. In the IV dara-VMP group, more patients had ISS stage III and 
ECOG 2 (41% and 26%) compared with the SC dara + VMP (22% and 6%), but number of patients with 
cytogenetic  high-risk  disease  was  similar.  In  the  Dara-RD  group,  there  were  more  patients  with 
cytogenetic high-risk disease in the SC group compared with the IV group, 36% vs. 15%.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  current  submission  is  supported  by  one  Phase  3  study  MMY3012  of  SC  vs.  IV  administration  of 
Daratumumab  in  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  Multiple  Myeloma,  and  one  phase  2  study  to 
evaluate SC Daratumumab in combination with standard Multiple Myeloma treatment regimens.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  pivotal  study  in  the  efficacy  evaluation  is  the  phase  3  study  MMY3012,  a  randomized,  active 
controlled multicentre study of monotherapy SC daratumumab versus IV daratumumab. The MAH has 
also submitted a phase 2 study of SC daratumumab in combination with 3 different standard Multiple 
myeloma  treatment  regimens:  bortezomib  +  melphalan  +  prednisone  (D-VMP),  lenalidomide  + 
dexamethasone (D-Rd) and bortezomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone (D-VRd). Daratumumab SC is 
administered as a 1800 mg flat dose, co-formulated with rHuPH20 in both studies. No comparator is in 
the  combination  therapy  study,  data  is  compared  to  historical  data  from  previously  submitted  IV 
combination studies.  
The in- and exclusion criteria clearly define 4 groups of patients, above 18 years and ECOG 0-2, with 
Multiple  Myeloma:  1)  Relapsed/refractory  MM  who  have  received  at  least  3  prior  lines  of  therapy  for 
monotherapy daratumumab and whose prior therapy included a PI and an IMiD, 2) newly diagnosed MM 
ineligible for ASCT for the combination D-VMP, 3) newly diagnosed MM eligible for ASCT for D-VRd and 
4) relapsed MM who have received at least one prior therapy (D-Rd). No trials were performed for  dara 
in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone and who have received at least one prior treatment.  
The  MAH  has  justified  the  extrapolation  of  the  indication  daratumumab  in  combination  with  other 
standard back-bone therapies such as the combination bortezomib and dexamethasone.  
In  general  the  baseline  demographics  characteristics  are  well  balanced  between  the  two  treatment 
groups in the MMY3012 Study, except from a higher proportion of subjects with high cytogenetic risk in 
the dara SC group (dara SC: 26.3%vs. dara IV: 17.3%). The study population in the two studies was 
overall representative to patients with Multiple Myeloma. However, the range of weight was wide with 
extremely low values as 28.6 - 39 kg; a total of 11 patients had a body weight below 45 kg, 5 patients 
in the SC group and 6 patients in the IV group, the MAH has provided narratives for the these patients, 
they  were  in  general  considered  fragile  with  comorbidities,  but  the  protocol  did  not  specify  any  body 
weight-based  exclusions.  No  difference  in  discontinuation  due  to  AE  and  death  was  reported  and  no 
further safety concerns were raised. The fact that these fragile patients actually tolerated several cycles 
of treatment is reassuring. 
The reported “discontinuation due to physician decision” was higher in the Dara SC arm, as compared 
with the Dara IV arm.  The main reasons were decline in clinical condition, lack of response or suspicion 
of PD, reasons that are comprehensible in a relapse/refractory setting. No correlation to dosing route or 
treating Principal Investigator was identified.

Overall, the studies were well conducted,  the study MMY2040 was still ongoing and most patients  still 
on treatment, but the MAH has updated the study adding 7.4 months of follow-up.  
The primary endpoint ORR is fully acceptable for the monotherapy study of daratumumab comparing the 
SC and the IV formulation, as well as for the combination studies D-VMP and D-Rd cohorts. However, 
for the D-VRd group, the primary endpoint is VGPR or better.  The MAH has justified, that historical data 
have showed, that the ORR for patients treated with VRd and eligible for autologous stem cell transplant 
(ASCT) was 97% or higher. In order to allow assessment of a clinical benefit of adding daratumumab to 
the VRd backbone regimen, the MAH decided to use VGPR or better as primary endpoint.  
The secondary endpoints in both studies are considered clinically relevant. However, the MRD negativity 
is evaluated in all patients, except from newly diagnosed patients eligible to ASCT. The MAH has clarified, 
that  due  to  the  shortness  of  the  study  of  D-VRd  in  transplant  eligible  patients,  only  3  months  of 
treatment, they considered it not appropriate to require patients to undergo a bone marrow procedure 
for MRD analysis.   
The studies are aiming at non-inferiority of Dara SC to Dara IV, defined by using a 60% retention of the 
lower bound (20.8%) of the 95% CI from a previous Study MMY2002 of Dara IV. In the MMY2002 Study 
in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, patients who had received at least 3 prior therapies, had an 
ORR of 29.2% (95% CI: 20.8%, 38.9%) after Dara IV 16 mg/kg. 
The clinical relevance of the 60% retention of ORR was justified based on the benefit/risk of Dara SC 
and a strong indication of similar efficacy from early efficacy and pharmacokinetics data. Stratification 
factors for study MMY3012 were body weight at baseline (≤ 65 kg, 66 kg to 85 kg, >85 kg), number of 
prior lines of therapy (≤ 4 prior lines versus >4 prior lines), and type of myeloma (IgG versus non-
IgG). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The monotherapy study met its co-primary endpoint showing that Daratumumab SC was non-inferior to 
daratumumab IV in terms of ORR as assessed by the computerized algorithm according to IMWG criteria. 
The results were consistent across several sensitivity analyses and across the pre-specified subgroups. 
There seem to be no difference pertained to type of myeloma (IgG or non-IgG). Pertained to number of 
prior lines of therapy (≤ 4 or > 4 lines), the ORR seems better for patients who received ≤ 4 prior lines, 
however this subgroup was small and the 95% CI wide. Although small subgroups and a wide 95% CI, 
there seem to be a trend to a better ORR in the Dara SC group. Body weight analyses of ORR showed 
consistent efficacy, except from the ≤ 65 kg and > 85 kg subgroups. Thus further justification for a flat 
SC dose regimen should be discussed in relation to high body weight extremes with low exposure and a 
potential risk of lower efficacy. 
The median PFS was comparable between treatment, as were the rate of VGPR or better, but the OS 
data were not mature   
For both studies, the median duration of administration was significantly shorter, 5 min. in the SC group 
compared  with  the  IV  administration  in  the  monotherapy  study.  This  may  have  an  impact  on  the 
secondary endpoint, IRR, which was significantly reduced in the Dara SC group compared with the Dara 
IV group, daratumumab SC: 12.7%; daratumumab IV: 34.5%; odds ratio=0.28 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.44; 
p<0.0001). 
The combination therapy study MMY 2040 was updated, adding 7,4 months of follow-up.  
The  median  duration  of  treatment  in  the  D-VMP  and  D-Rd  cohorts  was  14.3  and  14.9  months, 
respectively. In  the  D-VRd  cohort,  the  median  treatment  duration  was unchanged from the initial SC 
submission (2.6 months). The  ORR  was  89.6%  for  the  D-VMP  cohort  (initial  SC  submission:  88.1%) 
and 93.8% for D-Rd cohort (initial SC submission:  90.8%). The ORR for VRd was unchanged at 97%

as all subjects had completed or discontinued  the  study  at  the  time  of  the  initial  SC  submission. 
The  depth  of  response  improved  with  a  CR/sCR  rate  of  47.8%  (initial  SC  submission:  17.9%)  in 
the D-VMP cohort and CR/sCR rate of  38.5% (initial SC submission: 18.5%) in the D-Rd cohort. 
The  MAH  has  compared  the  SC  combination  therapy  of  D-VMP  and  D-Rd  with  historical  data  from 
previously  submitted  IV  combination.  Although  the  baseline  characteristics  were  not  quite  similar  in 
relation  to  age  and  number  of  patients  with  cytogenetic  high-risk  disease,  and  patients  on  SC  dara 
combinations had a short follow up period of approximately 7 months, the ORR for SC D-VMP was  89.6% 
compared with 90.9% with the similar combination treatment using dara IV. The ORR for the SC D-Rd 
was 93.8% compared with 92.9% for the IV formulation. The secondary endpoints were in general not 
mature,  but  overall,  the  SC  data  seem  consistent  with  the  previous  historical  IV  data  for  the 
daratumumab combination therapy.   
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The Study MMY3012 met its primary endpoint and showed statistically significant results. The observed 
mean exposure (Ctrough at Cycle 3 Day 1) was comparable after SC and IV administration by Pop PK 
analyses: 463 (86.1-1109) vs. 499 (9.97-1720). The ORR was 41.1% for Dara SC and 37.1% for Dara 
IV. The relative risk of Dara SC over Dara IV and 95% CI was 1.11 (0.89, 1.37), p < 0.0001, thus the 
study met its co-primary endpoint, showing Dara SC is non-inferior to dara IV. The concern regarding 
lower exposure in extreme high body weight SC patients and potential loss of efficacy, has been 
addressed with text amendments to the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
In the 3  monotherapy  studies  (MMY3012,  MMY1004,  MMY1008)  and 1  combination  study  (MMY2040) 
included in this submission, safety data for daratumumab SC reflect data derived from subjects treated 
with daratumumab as an 1800 mg flat dose (co formulated with rHuPH20 30,000 U) and injected SC 
into the abdomen.

Patient exposure 
In Study MMY3012, both the median total number of treatment cycles completed (6.0) and median 
duration of treatment (4.7 months) for the daratumumab SC group were similar to that for the 
daratumumab IV group. Subjects assigned to the daratumumab SC group received up to 15 cycles of 
treatment with daratumumab SC and had a duration of treatment of up to 12.9 months. This was 
consistent with the maximum number of cycles and maximum treatment duration for the 
daratumumab IV group (Table 47)

All drug-related TEAEs were balanced between treatment groups (<5% difference in incidence) 
except neutropenia (daratumumab SC: 12.3%; daratumumab IV: 6.2%) and chills (5.4% and 11.6%, 
respectively; Attachment TSFAE03). A majority of all TEAEs in both treatment groups were assessed 
by the investigator to be related to study drug (50.8% and 57.8%, respectively – see Table 49).

The incidence of severe hemorrhagic TEAEs was low and balanced between daratumumab SC and 
daratumumab IV in Study MMY3012 and similar for the D-VMP and D-Rd regimens in Study MMY2040 
compared to historic data with the corresponding daratumumab IV combination regimens in Studies 
MMY3007 and MMY3003, respectively. The totality of data for Studies MMY3012 or MMY2040 did not 
indicate any clear evidence of a relationship between thrombocytopenia and Grade 3 or higher 
hemorrhagic events

The  overall 
incidence  of 
infection  and 
infestation  TEAEs  remained  balanced  between  the 
daratumumab SC and daratumumab IV groups regardless of time of onset. In both treatment groups, 
the  proportion  of  subjects  with  new  onset  infection  and  infestation  TEAEs  tended  to  be  lower  after  6 
cycles of treatment (daratumumab SC: 20.3% for Cycles 7+ vs 28.5% and 27.4% for Cycles 1-2 and 3-
6, respectively; daratumumab IV: 17.3% for Cycles 7+ vs 24.4% and 23.6% for Cycles 1-2 and 3-6, 
respectively) (Mod5.3.5.3/ISS/AttTSFINF02).  
Most infection and infestation TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2, with the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs low 
and  similar  for  the  daratumumab  SC  and  daratumumab IV  groups  (10.4%  and  11.2%,  respectively). 
Pneumonia was the only Grade 3 or 4 infection TEAE reported in ≥2% of subjects in the daratumumab 
SC or daratumumab IV groups (2.7% and 3.9%, respectively) (Mod5.3.5.3/ISS/AttTSFINF01).  
A  small  number  of  treatment-emergent  infections  were  fatal,  and  this  proportion  was  lower  in  the 
daratumumab  SC  group  (3/119  subjects  in  the  daratumumab SC  and  10/117 subjects  in  the 
daratumumab IV group) (Mod5.3.5.1/MMY3012/Sec8.1.2.4.4). 
Most infections were manageable and rarely led to treatment discontinuation (daratumumab SC, 1.2%; 
daratumumab IV, 3.5%) (Mod5.3.5.3/ISS/AttTSFAE11)

Combination therapy 
In each daratumumab SC combination therapy cohort of Study MMY2040, the majority of infection and 
infestation TEAEs were assessed as Grade 1 or 2 in severity. 
D-VMP cohort: The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 infection and infestation TEAEs was 11.9%, with pneumonia 
being the most common of these events (4.5%) (Mod5.3.5.2/MMY2040/AttTSFAEINF01). Treatment was 
discontinued for 2 subjects (3.0%) in this cohort due to a Grade 3 or 4 infection TEAE (pneumonitis and 
neutropenic sepsis) (Mod5.3.5.2/MMY2040/AttTSFAE05A), the latter of which subsequently worsened to 
Grade 5 (Mod5.3.5.2/MMY2040/Sec7.1.2.4.6). 
D-Rd cohort: The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 infection and infestation TEAEs was 23.1%, with pneumonia 
being the most common of these events (6.2%) (Mod5.3.5.2/MMY2040/AttTSFAEINF01). Treatment was 
discontinued for 2 subjects (3.1%) in this cohort due to a Grade 3 or 4 infection TEAEs (Grade 3 or 4 
pneumonia in both) (Mod5.3.5.2/MMY2040/AttTSFAE05A). 
D-VRd cohort: The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 infection and infestation TEAEs was 7.5%, with pneumonia 
being the only such event reported in >1 subject in this cohort (3.0%) (TSFAEINF01). Treatment was 
not discontinued for any subject in this cohort due to a Grade 3 or 4 infection TEAE (TSFAE05A). 
A similar proportion of subjects in the daratumumab SC (23.6%) and daratumumab IV (20.8%) groups 
received a transfusion of any type of blood product (most commonly packed RBCs) although the number 
of  transfusions  was  higher  in  the  daratumumab  IV  group  (daratumumab  SC:  193;  daratumumab  IV: 
318) (see Table TSITRSF01/CSR). There were more transfusion days, which is a more precisely defined 
measure  compared  to  “transfusion  events”,  in  the  IV  arm,  where  there  were  more  AEs  of  anaemia, 
mainly driven by four heavily treated patients.

As of the cutoff date for Study MMY2040, few deaths (4 across 3 cohorts) occurred within 30 days of the 
last  dose,  and  each  of  these  deaths  were  due  to  an  AE  (ie,  Grade  5  TEAE)  (Mod5.3.5.2/MMY2040/ 
Sec7.1.2.1): 
Modified from Mod5.3.5.3/ISS/AttTSFAE13 
•  D-VMP cohort: Two deaths (3.0%) (neutropenic sepsis, pneumonitis) 
•  D-Rd cohort: One death (1.5%) (myocardial infarction) 
•  D-VRd cohort: One death (1.5%) (respiratory failure) 
In the monotherapy study deaths due to AEs were similar in the two arms (6.6% and 5.4% in IV and SC 
arms, respectively, see Table 59).  
There were no deaths in studies MMY1004 (Part 2; 25 patients) or MMY1008 (6 patients), which are also 
part of the pooled daratumumab SC cohort in the SCS.  
There were four deaths in study MMY2040; two in the D-VMP cohort, and one each in the D-Rd and D-
VRd cohort of which the causality is impossible to determine.

Serious adverse events 
Monotherapy 
All serious TEAEs were balanced between treatment groups (<5% difference in incidence; Attachment 
TSFAE06).  Although  ≥ 1  serious  TEAE(s)  was  reported  for  approximately  30%  of  subjects  in  both 
treatment groups, the incidence of any specific preferred term being reported as serious was low, with 
only pneumonia being reported at ≥2% incidence in either treatment group (Table 60). 
Table 54 
Combination therapy 
 The SOC Infections and infestations and General disorders and administration site conditions were the 
most frequent SAEs by SOC in Study 2040 (Table 31/CSR), and for D-VMP and D-Rd the SOC 
Infections and infestations is lower than in the historical controls. (Table 61)

Clinical Chemistry 
Monotherapy 
The worst toxicity grades observed during treatment for chemistry parameters were balanced (<5% difference 
in  incidence)  between  treatment  groups  except  for  Grade  1  creatinine  high  (daratumumab  SC:  31.3%; 
daratumumab IV: 25.2%) and Grade 1 hyponatremia (20.1% and 28.9%, respectively; Table 63). 
Grade 3 or 4 abnormal chemistry values were uncommon, with only Grade 3 hyponatremia (6.7%) and Grade 
3 hyperglycemia (5.1%) having incidence ≥5% (both in the daratumumab SC group). 
No subject in either treatment group met criteria for drug-induced liver injury. 
Combination therapy 
In Study MMY2040, treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 biochemistry laboratory abnormalities were infrequent 
(<5%) in all treatment cohorts with the exception of Grade 3 low sodium and Grade 3 high creatinine in the 
D-VMP cohort (11.9% and 6.0%, respectively)  
Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 elevations in hepatic laboratory parameters were rare in each cohort, and

Weight 
Monotherapy 
The distribution of subjects by baseline body weight was comparable for the pooled daratumumab SC group 
and daratumumab IV group for Study MMY3012, ie, ~36% for those weighing ≤65 kg, ~40% for those weighing 
>65 to 85 kg, and ~24% for those weighing >85 kg.  
• 
• 
The  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  of  any  grade  was  higher  in  the  ≤65  kg  subgroup  for  the  pooled 
daratumumab  SC  group  compared  with  the  daratumumab  IV  group  of  Study  MMY3012  (95.2%  vs 
89.1%),  and  this  difference  was  driven  primarily  by  Grade  1  and  2  TEAEs  (43.8%  and  38.1%, 
respectively) (Table 66). 
For each body weight subgroup, the overall incidences of maximum Grade 3  or 4 TEAEs, maximum 
Grade  5  TEAEs,  serious  TEAEs,  and  TEAEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  for  the  pooled 
daratumumab SC group were either similar to or lower than corresponding incidences observed in the 
daratumumab IV group of Study MMY3012.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Monotherapy 
Discontinuation of study treatment due to a TEAE(s) was reported at similarly low rates in the daratumumab 
SC (6.9%) and daratumumab IV (8.1%) groups in Study MMY3012 (see Table 49), as was the proportion of 
subjects who were discontinued from treatment due to a Grade 3 or 4 TEAE (4.2% and 5.0%, respectively). 
Those  TEAEs  (any  grade)  leading to  discontinuation of  study  treatment in  1%  or  more of  subjects  in either 
 
 
 
 
treatment group were thrombocytopenia (daratumumab SC, 0.8%; daratumumab IV, 1.9%), anemia (0.8% 
and 1.2%, respectively), and septic shock (0.8% and 1.2%, respectively). 
Combination therapy 
Comparison to Historic Data with Daratumumab IV:  
•  D-VMP Regimens 
−  The overall incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation through Month 6 was low and similar for 
Studies MMY2040 (3.0%) and MMY3007 (3.2%). 
•  D-Rd Regimens 
−  The overall incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation through Month 6 was low and similar for 
Studies MMY2040 (4.6%) and MMY3003 (5.7%). 
Post marketing experience 
Daratumumab SC has not been authorized for use in any country worldwide. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  main  focus  of  the  safety  evaluation  is  on  the  pivotal  study  MMY3012  as  this  is  a  phase  3,  open-label, 
randomised study.  
For study MMY3012 (N=260) and the daratumumab SC pooled monotherapy population (N=291) the reasons 
for  discontinuation,  the  overall  percentage  of  subjects  who  remained  on  treatment,  the  number  of  cycles 
received, median duration of treatment, and median relative dose intensity were consistent with those reported 
for the daratumumab IV treatment.  
Study MMY2040, where daratumumab was given as SC treatment in combination with other well-established 
treatments (D-VRd, D-VMP, D-Rd) used in combination with daratumumab IV and compared to historical data, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/273138/2020 
Page 119/132 
  
  
 
 
 
 
is  considered  supportive  although  important  for  the  safety  evaluation  of  daratumumab  SC  in  these 
combinations.  The  median  follow-up  duration  in  Study  MMY2040  with  daratumumab  SC  was  7-10  months 
shorter than those for historical daratumumab IV data from the primary analyses of the D-VMP group (Study 
MMY3007)  and  the  D-Rd  group  (Study  MMY3003).  Therefore,  the  comparison  of  daratumumab  SC  and 
daratumumab IV combination safety profiles from these studies are based on data collected from the first dose 
of study treatment up to the end of month 6 for each subject. 
The  overall  TEAE  profile  for  subjects  treated  with  daratumumab  SC  in  the  randomised  comparative  study, 
MMY3012, and in the Pooled Monotherapy Safety analysis set was comparable to that for the daratumumab IV 
treatment group of MMY3012 (Table 49). TEAEs (all grades and grade 3-4) were balanced with <5% difference 
in incidence except for the incidence of neutropenia, which was higher in the daratumumab SC groups (Study 
MMY3012 and pooled; Table 52 and Table 53). Despite this, the AEs in the SOC Infections and Infestations 
were similar although with Upper respiratory tract infections (only grade 1-2) being higher in the SC arm. SAEs 
and discontinuations related to febrile neutropenia were low and comparable as was the use of hematopoietic 
growth factors. In the monotherapy study deaths due to AEs and SAEs were similar in the two arms. The safety 
profile is reflected in the SPC.  
In  the  combination  therapy  study  (the  D-VMP  and  D-Rd  regimens)  SAEs,  Grade  3  or  4  TEAEs,  and  TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation were similar to that reported for the same combination therapy regimens in Studies 
MMY3007  and  MMY3003,  respectively  (IV),  see  Table  51.  Cytopenias  were  the  most  common  Grade  3  or  4 
TEAEs in all 3 cohorts but the incidence was similar or lower when compared to historical data for neutropenia, 
anaemia and thrombocytopenia, and the SOC Infections and infestations were similar or lower in the SC arms. 
In  the  combination  study  the  results  were  compared  to  historical  data,  which  is  not  ideal,  but  there  is  no 
obvious biological explanation why the results from the monotherapy study (MMY3012) would not be applicable 
in combination treatments that has previously been used in combination with daratumumab IV. 
Treatment with daratumumab SC in study MMY3012 was associated with a significant lower risk of IRRs both 
overall  and  grade  3-4.  The  reduction  in  IRRs  is  considered  a  major  therapeutic  advantage  with  relation  to 
safety.  
All  injection-site  reactions  in  monotherapy  study  MMY3012  and  combination  therapy  study  MMY2040  were 
grade 1 and 2 and none led to treatment discontinuation. These reactions are considered a minor disadvantage 
especially in light of the reduced incidence of IRRs. 
Regarding weight and the use of a flat dose: Daratumumab SC was administered as a flat dose of 1800 mg, 
regardless of body weight, whereas daratumumab IV is administered at a weight-based dose of 16 mg/kg. For 
the  ≤65  kg  group  comparable  concentration-time  profiles  independent  of  SC  or  IV  administration  were  not 
seen:  Ctrough  daratumumab  SC  values  are  markedly  increased  from  Cycle  3  Day  1  and  onwards  (see  the 
pharmacology section). A higher incidence of any grade and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in the pooled SC group 
was observed and corresponded to a higher incidence of all grade AEs in the SOC Infections/Infestations but 
comparable  grade  3  or  4  AEs  and  SAEs  in  the  ≤65  kg  subgroup  (in  this  SOC)  leading  to  the  difference  in 
neutropenia being of minor clinical relevance.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  daratumumab  is  well  known  and  clinically  manageable,  it  is  overall  as  reflected  in  the 
SmPC. The median duration of administration of Dara SC was considerably shorter than for Dara IV, and Dara 
SC had a significantly lower incidence of IRR compared with Dara IV. A higher incidence of any grade and grade 
3 or 4 neutropenia in the pooled SC group was observed and corresponded to a higher incidence of all grade 
AEs in the SOC Infections/Infestations, but this was not associated with any clinically meaningful differences 
in sequelae such as infections. No new safety signals were observed, all OC’s have been addressed by the MAH 
in a satisfactory manner.

as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose 
prior  therapy  included  a  proteasome  inhibitor  and  an  immunomodulatory  agent  and  who  have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment options for multiple myeloma are dependent on age, performance status, comorbidity, suitability for 
intensive treatment as well as aggressiveness of the disease and related prognostic factors. Current treatments 
include different combinations of chemotherapy, proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, high dose 
chemotherapy  and  ASCT  and  monoclonal  antibodies  such  as  daratumumab  IV  and  elotuzumab  IV.  Most 
treatment regimens include a glucocorticoid. 
In the past years, multiple targeted therapies and immunotherapies including second generation IMiDs and PIs 
and  monoclonal  antibodies  (daratumumab  IV)  were  approved  for  the  treatment  of  myeloma  or  entered  of 
clinical testing (Larocca 2017). With modern therapy, patients with standard risk multiple myeloma have an 
estimated median survival of 8 to 10 years (Rajkumar 2018). Despite advances in treatment options, multiple 
myeloma remains incurable. With each successive relapse, the chance of response and the duration of response 
typically decrease. Ultimately the disease becomes refractory or patients develop intolerability to PIs and IMiDs. 
Patients  who  are  refractory  to  both  a  PI  and  an  IMiD  have  a  dismal  prognosis  and  median  survival  is  only 
approximately 8 to 9 months (Kumar 2012; Usmani 2016). 
Therefore, besides from novel therapeutic strategies to improve and deepen ORR, treatment modalities 
minimising the toxicities and treatment duration that are associated with current treatment options are 
needed.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The submission is mainly based on a phase 3 multicentre, randomized, open-label efficacy (non-inferiority), 
safety and pharmacokinetics study comparing monotherapy daratumumab IV to daratumumab SC in 522 
patients with a relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Further submitted were a phase 2 study evaluating 
daratumumab SC in combination with standard treatment regimens in patients newly diagnosed with multiple 
myeloma (eligible and ineligible to ASCT) and relapsed patients, a phase 1b dose-escalation study and a 
phase 1 study of daratumumab SC in Japanese patients with a relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Co-Primary endpoints:  
The ORR was 41.1% for daratumumab SC and 37.1% for daratumumab IV (incidence ratio 1.11 (90% CI: 
0.89, 1.37), p < 0.0001).  
The observed mean exposure (Ctrough at Cycle 3 Day 1 in Study MMY3012) of daratumumab was comparable 
after SC and IV administration by Pop PK analyses: 463 (86.1-1109) vs. 499 (9.97-1720) µg/ml. 
Key secondary endpoint: 
A reduction in the IRRs was shown in the daratumumab SC group (12.7%) compared to daratumumab IV 
(34.5%); odds ratio=0.28 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.44); p<0.0001.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Sex, IgG myeloma, baseline albumin and body weight were identified as significant covariates for 
daratumumab SC exposure and in the Pop PK analysis. There is a concern with regard to lower exposure in 
extreme high body weight SC patients (>120 kg) and potential loss of efficacy. While no dose modifications 
can currently be recommended, the risk of possible reduced efficacy in patients with body weight >120 kg 
has been adequately reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC.. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
A  higher  incidence  of  any  grade  and  grade  3  or  4  neutropenia  in  the  pooled  daratumumab  SC  group  was 
observed Despite this, the AEs in the SOC ‘Infections and Infestations’ were similar..  
No  new  clinically  relevant  safety  concerns  were  identified  for  daratumumab  SC.  The  safety  profile  for 
daratumumab SC, administered at a flat dose of 1800 mg, is generally consistent with the well-characterized 
safety profile for daratumumab 16 mg/kg IV. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no relevant uncertainties related to unfavourable effects.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The results for ORR and Ctrough indicate that the efficacy of daratumumab SC is not inferior to daratumumab 
IV, which is authorised for treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (see 3.1.1 for exact indications). 
Compared with daratumumab IV, daratumumab SC had a lower incidence of IRR when administered as 
monotherapy and at the same schedule as daratumumab IV, and this has relevance for patients. While a 
higher incidence of any grade and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was observed in the pooled daratumumab SC 
group, compared to daratumumab IV, this was not associated with clinically meaningful differences in 
sequelae such as infections or discontinuations. The availability of daratumumab in the pharmaceutical form 
for subcutaneous administration is considered a major benefit to the patients, because this route of 
administration reduces the treatment burden for patients and healthcare providers. 
The efficacy results for daratumumab SC in combination with standard backbone combination therapy in 
supportive studies indicated comparability to previously approved combination therapies using daratumumab 
IV.  
While daratumumab IV dosing is weight-based, daratumumab SC was administered as a flat dose of 
1800 mg. Subgroup analyses across body weight distribution showed similar efficacy pertaining ORR. In 
addition, the MAH commits to evaluate clinical trial data to further characterize efficacy and exposure of the 
daratumumab subcutaneous formulation in patients with body weight >120 kg and: 
a) Conduct subgroup analysis of subjects with body weight >120 kg in ongoing randomized studies to 
further characterize the impact of body weight >120 kg on exposure and efficacy outcomes. 
b) Submit these data as part of a Type II variation, reflecting the conclusions of this analysis by 
1Q2023 (interim results presented with the PBRER in 1Q2021 and 1Q2022). 
In conclusion, daratumumab SC was well tolerated both as monotherapy and in combination with standard 
background MM therapy. The AEs of daratumumab SC are well known and considered manageable, no new 
clinically relevant safety concerns were identified for the daratumumab SC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Daratumumab, administered as an IV infusion, has a favourable balance of benefits and risks in the 
relapsed/refractory setting of multiple myeloma (MM), as well as in newly-diagnosed patients, ineligible to 
HDT and ASCT.  
In the present submission, daratumumab SC is shown to be non-inferior to daratumumab IV in terms of ORR, 
to be associated with fewer IRRs and to have a Ctrough that is comparable after SC and IV administration. No 
new safety signals were raised, and the AEs were considered clinically manageable. Furthermore, the 
duration of administration of daratumumab SC was considerably shorter than for daratumumab IV, which is 
considered a benefit to the patients.  
Therefore, the favourable effects of daratumumab SC outweigh the risks.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Darzalex (daratumumab) subcutaneous formulation is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Darzalex is not similar to Imnovid, Farydak, Kyprolis, Ninlaro, 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of, Darzalex 1800 mg solution for subcutaneous injection is favourable in the 
following indication: 
DARZALEX is indicated: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for 
the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous 
stem cell transplant. 
in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with 
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant. 
in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the 
treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. 
as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, 
whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Darzalex subject to the 
following conditions:

Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European Medicines Agency web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required  pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of DARZALEX (daratumumab) in each Member State (MS) the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder (MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational materials, 
aiming at increasing awareness about the Important Identified Risk of “Interference for blood typing 
(minor antigen) (Positive Indirect Coombs’ test)” and providing guidance on how to manage it. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each MS where DARZALEX (daratumumab) is marketed, all HCPs and 
patients who are expected to prescribe, dispense and receive this product have access to/are provided 
with the below. 
The HCPs and Blood Banks educational materials, shall contain the following key elements: 
o  
The guide for HCPs and Blood Banks, to advice about the risk of interference for blood typing 
and how to minimise it; 
o The Patient Alert Card. 
The Guide for HCP and Blood Banks shall contain the following key elements: 
o  
o  
o  
All patients should be typed and screened prior to start treatment with daratumumab; 
alternatively, phenotyping may also be considered; 
Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect Coombs test (interfering with cross-matching of 
blood) may persist for up to 6 months after the last product’s infusion, therefore, the HCP 
should advise the patient to carry the Patient Alert Card until 6 months after the treatment has 
ended; 
Daratumumab bound to Red Blood Cells (RBCs) may mask the detection of antibodies to minor

antigens in the patient’s serum; 
The determination of a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted; 
The interference mitigation methods include treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to 
disrupt daratumumab binding or other locally validated methods. Since the Kell Blood group 
system is also sensitive to DTT treatment, Kell-negative units should be supplied after ruling 
out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT-treated RBCs. Alternatively, genotyping may also 
be considered; 
In case of urgent need for transfusion, non-cross matched ABO/RhD compatible RBC units can 
be administered as per local bank practices; 
In the event of a planned transfusion, the HCPs should notify blood transfusion centres about 
the interference with indirect antiglobulin tests; 
Reference to the need to consult the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC); 
Reference to the need of giving the Patient Alert Card to the patients and to advise them to 
consult the Package Leaflet (PL). 
The Patient Alert Card, shall contain the following key elements: 
o  
A warning message for HCPs treating the patient at any time, including in conditions of 
emergency, that the patient is using DARZALEX (daratumumab), and that this treatment is 
associated with the Important Identified Risk of Interference for blood typing (minor antigen) 
(Positive Indirect Coombs’ test), which might persist for up to 6 months after the last product’s 
infusion, and a clear reference that the patient should continue to carry this card until 6 months 
after the treatment has ended; 
Contact details of the DARZALEX (daratumumab) prescriber; 
Reference to the need to consult the Package Leaflet (PL).

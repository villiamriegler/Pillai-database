2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The initially claimed therapeutic indication was: 
“The treatment of adult patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive generalized 
myasthenia gravis (gMG) with remaining symptomatology despite at least one immunomodulatory 
therapy (see section 5.1). 
Myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare, chronic, neuromuscular autoimmune disease mediated by 
pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies, binding to acetylcholine receptors or to 
functionally related molecules in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), 
which causes debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. 
Epidemiology  
In about two-thirds of patients, the first symptom is weakness of extrinsic ocular muscles. In 1 of 10 MG 
patients, symptoms remain limited to extrinsic ocular muscles (ocular myasthenia gravis). However, in 
more than 80% of patients, the symptoms progress within 2 years to affect other bulbar muscles as well 
as  limb  muscles  (generalised  MG).  The  generalized  muscle  weakness  leads  to  difficulties  in  mobility, 
speech, swallowing, and vision, as well as impaired respiratory function and extreme fatigue. Up to 20% 
of  patients  experience  potentially  life-threatening  myasthenic  crisis,  with  respiratory  failure  requiring 
mechanical ventilation.  
The disease presents with two peaks of incidence, below or above the age of 50, termed early-onset MG 
and  late-onset  MG,  respectively.  The  prevalence  of  MG  in  the  European  Union  is  estimated  at  3.7  in 
10,000, equivalent to a total of around 191,000 people1 . 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
MG  is  caused  by  pathogenic  autoantibodies  that  interfere  with  synaptic  transmission  at  the 
neuromuscular junction and impair or prevent muscle contraction2,3,4. In approximately 85% of cases, 
circulating  antibodies  target  the  acetylcholine  receptor  (AChR)  itself.  In  the  remaining  15%, 
approximately half have antibodies against muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK), while the other half

may be positive for autoantibodies against lipoprotein-related protein receptor 4 (LRP4) or other antigens 
associated with the neuromuscular junction5,6. 
The  pathogenic  actions  of  IgG  autoantibodies  include  functional  blockade  of  AChR,  accelerated 
internalization and degradation of AChR, and activation of the complement system. These pathogenic 
actions result in reduced density of functional AChR and simplification of the NMJ, leading to failure of 
neuromuscular transmission. Anti-AChR autoantibodies are of the IgG1 and IgG3 subtypes. Anti-MuSK 
autoantibodies are IgG4 subtype and do not activate the complement pathway7.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
MG  is  an  autoimmune  disease  characterized  by  muscle  weakness  that  fluctuates,  worsening  with 
exertion,  and  improving  with  rest.  In  most  cases,  initial  symptoms  are  ocular  and  include  ptosis  and 
diplopia,  but  within  2 to  3 years  of  onset,  the  disease  usually  worsens,  and  other  muscles  become 
affected; this is referred to as generalized MG (gMG)8. Additional symptoms typically include difficulty 
chewing, dysphagia, dysarthria, hypophonia, dyspnea, difficulty holding the head upright, and fatigue, 
marked reductions in the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), extreme fatigue, and episodes 
of pulmonary failure requiring mechanical ventilation9 10.  
Hospitalizations  for  gMG  exacerbations  are  common,  with  the  need  for  respiratory  support,  including 
mechanical  ventilation  secondary  to  respiratory  failure  (eg, myasthenic  crisis)  with  no  substantial 
improvement in mortality or length of hospitalization over time. 
The  Myasthenia  Gravis  Foundation  of  America  (MGFA)  Clinical  Classification  categorizes  patients 
according to clinical evaluation, which in increasing severity can be: ocular MG; mild, moderate, severe 
generalized symptoms of MG; MG that requires intubation11.  
The diagnosis of myasthenia gravis is confirmed by the combination of relevant symptoms and signs, a 
positive  test  for  specific  autoantibodies  and  a  positive  neurophysiological  examination,  including 
repetitive nerve stimulation or single-fiber electromyography, and symptomatic improvement following 
treatment with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. 
Management 
Current treatment options include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and long-term immune therapies with 
immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate, but 
tacrolimus, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide are also used. Thymectomy is also a treatment option. 
Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab are used. Eculizumab, an anti-C5 treatment, was approved in 
the  EU  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  refractory  gMG  and  who  are  AChR-Ab  seropositive. 
Plasmapheresis/plasma exchange (PLEX) and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are mostly used as 
rescue therapies in situations of clinical deterioration12.

At the time of this application, with the exception of AChE inhibitors, corticosteroids, the complement 
inhibitor eculizumab (Soliris), and azathioprine (Jayempi), which have received regulatory approval for 
the treatment of gMG, all other existing therapies are used off-label. 
Patients with AChR-Ab seronegative gMG have greater limitations on treatment options, as AChE 
inhibitors are known to have reduced efficacy in this population and eculizumab is approved only for 
AChR-Ab seropositive patients and is limited to treatment of refractory MG. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Ravulizumab  (Ultomiris,  ALXN1210)  is  a  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  that  binds  to 
complement component 5 (C5) and blocks its activation by complement pathway convertases. 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA43 
Currently, Ultomiris is approved for Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical Haemolytic 
Uremic Syndrome (aHUS): 
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with a body weight of 10 kg or 
above with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) 
- 
- 
in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity.  
in patients who are clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the past 
6 months (see section 5.1). 
Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of patients with a body weight of 10 kg or above with atypical 
haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) who are complement inhibitor treatment-naïve or have received 
eculizumab for at least 3 months and have evidence of response to eculizumab (see section 5.1). 
Ravulizumab,  derived  through  targeted  engineering  from  eculizumab  (h5G1.1-mAb;  Soliris),  is  a 
terminal complement inhibitor that specifically binds to C5 with high affinity, inhibiting the enzymatic 
cleavage  of  C5  into  C5a  (the  proinflammatory  anaphylatoxin)  and  C5b  (the  initiating  subunit  of  the 
membrane  attack  complex  [MAC  or  C5b-9]).  By  binding  specifically  to  C5,  ravulizumab  antagonizes 
terminal  complement-mediated  inflammation,  cell  activation,  and  cell  lysis.  This  mechanism  of  action 
provides a therapeutic rationale for the use of ravulizumab in diseases in which activation of terminal 
complement plays an etiologic role. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Not applicable. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MA. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No additional nonclinical data with ravulizumab have been generated for this application.  
The CHMP adopted a report on similarity of Ultomiris with Soliris (Eculizumab) and 
Vyvgart (efgartigimod alfa) on  
EMA/686052/2022  
Page 9/99 
 
 
 
 
Direct  testing  of  ravulizumab  in  non-clinical  models  of  Myasthenia  Gravis  (MG)  is  precluded  by 
ravulizumab being a highly specific monoclonal antibody that binds only to human C5. 
A summary of results from relevant published studies has been submitted. 
In MG, complement activation initiates an inflammatory cascade that induces blockade of neuromuscular 
transmission and resulting in skeletal muscle weakness13. Published nonclinical experiments of MG have 
demonstrated  that  uncontrolled  complement  activation  leads  to  membrane  attack  complex  (MAC) 
deposition at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and impairment of the neuromuscular transmission in 
anti-AChR  antibody-positive  MG 14 15 16 17.  The  pro-inflammatory  properties  of  the  activated  terminal 
complement components, C5a and C5b 9, have been implicated in a wide range of inflammatory disease 
states18. Data presented supports terminal C5 inhibition with anti-C5 mAb, such as ravulizumab, as a 
viable therapeutic approach for patients with MG.  
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the CHMP guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, 
carbohydrates and lipids are exempted of environmental risk assessment because, due to their nature 
they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Due to the fact that ravulizumab is a 
monoclonal antibody and thus a protein, no Environmental Risk Assessment is provided for this 
application which was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No additional nonclinical data with ravulizumab have been generated for this application since the dose 
and administration route proposed for this new indication of gMG is the same that was previously 
approved for atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH) indications. This was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A full nonclinical package was provided as part of the initial marketing authorisation application (MAA) 
for Ultomiris in 2018. With the exception of the published studies discussed above, no additional 
nonclinical data have been generated. This is considered acceptable by CHMP.  
Considering the above data, ravulizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
The non-clinical data available supports the use of Ultomiris in the approved indication.

Absorption 
Ravulizumab is intended to be administered intravenously which results in 100% bioavailability. The 
tmax is expected at the end of infusion or soon after end of infusion. Over the studied dose and regimen 
range, ravulizumab exhibited dose proportional and time linear PK.

Distribution 
The mean (SD) Vss in adult patients with gMG is 5.74 (1.16) L. 
Elimination 
As an IgG monoclonal antibody, ravulizumab is expected to be metabolized in the same manner as any 
endogenous IgG (degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways) and is subject 
to similar elimination. Ravulizumab contains only natural occurring amino acids and has no known 
active metabolites. The mean (SD) t½ and CL of ravulizumab in adult patients with gMG is 56.6 (8.36) 
days and 0.00313 (0.000996) L/h, respectively.

Population PK model 
A  Pop-PK  analysis  was  previously  performed  to  assess  concentration-time  profiles  of  ravulizumab 
following  IV  administration  in  healthy  subjects  and  patients  with  PNH.  A  2-compartment  model  with 
linear  clearance  adequately  characterized  the  concentration-time  profiles  of  ravulizumab.  The  Pop-PK 
analysis included 38 (12.7%) healthy subjects and 261 (87.3%) patients with PNH. The Pop-PK model 
in patients with PNH included the effect of body weight on all clearance and volume parameters (CL, Q, 
Vc,  and  Vp).  In  addition,  the  Pop-PK  model  included  the  effect  of  BMI  on  volume  of  distribution 
parameters (Vc and Vp). Finally, the PNH model included the effect of hemoglobin on central parameters 
(CL and Vc).  
Rescue  therapy  (e.g,  high-dose  corticosteroid,  PE/PP,  or  IVIg)  was  allowed  if  a  patient  experienced 
clinical  deterioration  as  defined  in  the  protocol  for  Study  ALXN1210-MG-306.  PE/PP  interventions  are 
expected  to  result  in  the  bulk  removal  and  replacement  of  plasma,  thereby  removing  pathologic 
substances such as pathologic antibodies, immune complexes, and cytokines, as well as ravulizumab. 
Also,  IVIg  treatment  is  expected  to  competitively  bind  the  endosomal  neonatal  Fc  receptor  recycling 
mechanism of monoclonal antibodies and, thus, inhibit neonatal recycling of ravulizumab, resulting in 
reduced serum ravulizumab concentration19. Thus, supplemental dosing of study drug was implemented 
in Study ALXN1210-gMG-306 if PE/PP or IVIg rescue therapy was administered. As a result, the Pop-PK

base model was developed to account for additional pathways of elimination of ravulizumab as a potential 
effect of PE/PP or IVIg and supplemental doses administered secondary to these interventions.

Final Pop-PK pharmacostatistical parameter estimates for ravulizumab are presented in Table 6. 
A sensitivity analysis was  performed by using the Pop-PK model developed in patients with PNH as a 
reference  model  for  assessing  which  (if  any)  covariates  should  be  included  in  the  gMG  Pop-PK  base 
model.  For  patients  with  PNH,  the  final  model  included  body  weight,  BMI,  sex,  and  hemoglobin  as 
significant  covariates  on  PK.  The  PNH  model  was  used  to  model  the  current  data  from 
Study ALXN1210-MG-306.

The covariate effects on CL and Q of ravulizumab are presented below. 
• 
The CL of ravulizumab was dependent on body weight. The exponent for the effect of weight on 
CL  was  0.975  [(Body  Weight/70)0.975],  suggesting  higher  CL  values  in  patients  with  higher 
body  weight.  For  example,  typical  subjects  with  body  weight  values  of  40.0  and  166  kg 
(corresponding  to  minimum  and  maximum  values  in  the  PK  population;  refer  to  Table  2)  are 
expected to have CL values 42% lower and 2.3-fold (0.00137 and 0.00550 L/h, respectively) 
relative to a typical subject with a body weight of 70 kg, respectively. 
• 
• 
• 
The CL of ravulizumab during an IVIg intervention was 0.0108 L/h. The effect of IVIg intervention 
on  the  CL  of  ravulizumab  was  robustly  estimated  (RSE  <5%).  The  faster  CL  of  ravulizumab 
during an IVIg intervention corresponded to a t1/2β of 14.7 days.  
The CL of ravulizumab during a PP/PE intervention was 0.793 L/h. The RSE for the effect of PP/PE 
on CL was high (RSE = 45.5%) since only two patients in the PK population required PP/PE. The 
faster CL of ravulizumab during a PP/PE intervention corresponded to a t1/2β of 3.6 days. 
The Q of ravulizumab was dependent on body weight. Similar to CL, the exponent for the effect 
of weight on Q was 0.975 [(Body Weight/70)0.975]. The effect of weight on Q had therefore the 
same magnitude of effect as that presented for CL. 
Covariate effects on Vc and Vp of ravulizumab are presented below. 
• 
The Vc of ravulizumab was dependent on body weight. The exponent for the effect of weight on 
Vc was 0.702 [(Body Weight/70)0.702], suggesting higher Vc values in patients with higher body 
weight. For example, typical subjects with body weight values of 40.0 and 166 kg (corresponding 
to minimum and maximum values in the PK population) are expected to have Vc values 32% 
lower and 1.8-fold higher (1.99 and 5.41 L, respectively) relative to a typical subject with a body 
weight of 70 kg, respectively. 
• 
• 
Female patients presented a Vc approximately 8% lower than that derived in male patients.  
The Vp of ravulizumab was dependent on body weight and BMI. The effect of weight on Vp had 
the same magnitude as that presented for Vc. 
Summary of Ravulizumab PK parameters in subpopulations of interest 
The effect of specific covariates on the CL and Vc of ravulizumab relative to the reference population is 
presented in Figure 4.

The PD following body weight-based dosing of ravulizumab IV to patients with PNH, aHUS, or gMG is 
similar in that serum free C5 concentration was less than 0.5 μg/mL in 100% of samples obtained during 
treatment in adult patients with gMG or PNH and in greater than 99.5% of samples in adult patients with 
aHUS. 
Immunogenicity 
There were no treatment-emergent ADA-positive findings (ie, positive findings in patients that were not 
present at baseline or were present at baseline but the titer was higher after study drug administration) 
after ravulizumab administration during the Randomized-Controlled Period of Study ALXN1210-MG-306. 
In the ravulizumab group, 8 (9.3%) patients had an ADA-positive sample at baseline (pretreatment) but 
otherwise had ADA-negative samples at all times post treatment. 
A total of 78 (90.7%) patients presented with negative ADA at baseline and 8 (9.3%) presented with 
confirmed  positive  ADA  at  baseline.  Baseline  ADA  did  not  affect  the  CL  of  ravulizumab  according  to 
covariate analysis. All post-dose samples were associated with negative ADA in patients who received 
ravulizumab in the Randomized-Controlled Period.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ravulizumab  is  a  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  that  binds  to  C5  and  blocks  its  activation  by 
complement pathway convertases, thereby preventing the release of the proinflammatory anaphylatoxin 
C5a and the formation of the terminal complement complex via C5b. 
Autoantibodies recognize targeted neural or muscle tissues, including the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), 
leading to uncontrolled terminal complement activation at the neural or muscle surface20. Autoantibody-
driven uncontrolled terminal complement activation with membrane attack complex (MAC)-dependent 
lysis and activation, and C5a-dependent inflammation at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) causes AChR 
loss and failure of neuromuscular transmission.

Biophysica Acta (BBA)-Molecular Basis of Disease, 1852(4), 651-657.

EMA/686052/2022  
Page 23/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consistent with this model, both complement component (C) 3 (C3a and C3b) fragments and the MAC 
C5b-9 have been found in NMJs of MG patients21 . Taken together, the data support that uncontrolled 
terminal  complement  activation  at  the  NMJ  plays  a  role  in  the  destruction  of  post-synaptic  structure. 
Rapid,  complete,  and  sustained  inhibition  of  terminal  complement  activation  is  a  biologically  rational 
approach to prevent the damage caused in patients with gMG. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-efficacy relationship 
All serum free C5 concentrations post dose for the ravulizumab-treated patients during the Randomized-
Controlled  Period  were  < 0.5 μg/mL  (Figure ),  including  patients  experiencing  clinical  deterioration. 
Thus,  ravulizumab  treatment  resulted  in  immediate,  complete,  and  sustained  terminal  complement 
inhibition in all patients with gMG throughout the entire treatment period with body weight-based dosing.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology properties of ravulizumab in patients with gMG has been characterized using 
experimental information from Study ALXN1210-MG-306, which included pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic observations in 86 patients receiving ravulizumab and 89 patients in the placebo 
group. The model development programs were considered adequate by CHMP.  
Ravulizumab Cmax and Ctrough concentrations were remarkably lower in the highest (above 100 kg) 
weight group compared to the lowest one (40-60 kg) even after the first (loading) dose. This 
difference became much more pronounced through the last maintenance dose, reaching a difference of 
47% in Ctrough between the highest and the lowest bodyweight groups. 
The population PK model used incorporates a two-compartment model with linear clearance that was 
previously developed in healthy subjects and patients with PNH. In general, the structural and 
stochastic elements of the population PK model are adequate to properly describe the observed data in 
patients with gMG. PK parameters of the peripheral compartment (Q and Vp) were fixed to the value 
obtained in patients with PNH and healthy subjects, but CL, Vc and covariates effects were re-
estimated in patients with gMG. This modelling strategy might be explained by the lack of sufficient 
data in the alpha- and beta-distribution phases. However, the assumption that similar Vp and Q across 
the different indications is unclear and it may cause a model-misspecification on other PK parameters 
of the model. Despite of this, the relative standard errors of PK parameters were below 10%, except 
for IVIg intervention (due to the unbalanced and scarce (n=2) distribution of subjects), showing the 
adequacy of the final parameter estimates.  
A sensitivity analysis was  performed by using the Pop-PK model developed in patients with PNH as a 
reference  model  for  assessing  which  (if  any)  covariates  should  be  included  in  the  gMG  Pop-PK  base 
model.  For  patients  with  PNH,  the  final  model  included  body  weight,  BMI,  sex,  and  hemoglobin  as 
The CHMP adopted a report on similarity of Ultomiris with Soliris (Eculizumab) and 
Vyvgart (efgartigimod alfa) on

significant  covariates  on  PK.  It  was  noted  that,  the  effect  of  hemoglobin  on  CL  and  Vc  were  not 
statistically  significant  because  the  95%  CI  included  0.  The  effect  of  BMI  on  Vc  and  Vp  remained 
statistically  significant.  The  effect  of  sex  on  Vc  was  also  statistically  significant.  Overall,  the  effect  of 
hemoglobin originally identified in patients with PNH was no longer significant in patients with gMG. 
Comparison of exposure in patients with PNH, aHUS and gMG showed similar exposure PK metrics and 
half-life of ravulizumab, suggesting no significant differences due to disease condition.  
Regarding assessment of immunogenicity, there were no treatment-emergent ADA-positive findings and 
as such no impact of immunogenicity on ravulizumab PK or PD is expected in patients with gMG. 
Of note, the covariate analysis revealed a clinically relevant effect of body weight on Ctrough,ss and 
Cmax,ss, suggesting that differences >20% are expected in patients with body weight <52 and >93 
kg compared to the reference patient (70 kg). Despite the fact that experimental ravulizumab PK 
exposure metrics following the maintenance dose  are different to model-predicted ravulizumab PK 
exposure metrics following the maintenance dose, both suggest clear differences in exposure despite 
the different dosing regimen by body weight group. From the PK/PD relationship no clinically relevant 
differences in biomarker response and safety events among the three body-weight sub-groups of adult 
patients have been identified and the dosing regimen recommended in patients with gMG is identical to 
the one proposed in patients with PNH or aHUS. This is considered adequate by the CHMP. 
Regarding the clinical evaluation of the effect of ravulizumab in Japanese and non-Japanese patients 
no relevant differences in exposure were observed. However, since only six Japanese patients were 
enrolled no definitive conclusions can be made at this time.  
The PK/PD relationship has been empirically established through the graphical representation of 
experimental PK and PD observations, but no model-based approach has been conducted that would 
enable to understand whether alternative dosing strategies might be of interest. Based on the 
experimental evidence, the selection of 175 µg/mL might be justified based on C5 free concentration in 
treated patients vs. placebo arm. This result is in line with the threshold identified for patients with 
PNH and aHUS. Free C5 concentrations in the ravulizumab group were definitely below this threshold 
not only post-dose, but also pre-dose, even the outliers. It was further clarified that these low free C5 
values were bioanalytical outliers most likely, since no assignable cause of these low free C5 values 
were revealed by the bioanalytical run data and subsequent sample analysis report and ravulizumab 
concentrations of these patients were always below the level of quantification, justifying that they were 
not exposed inadvertently to ravulizumab during the study. 
The exposure-safety evaluation revealed no clinically relevant relationship of ravulizumab quartiles and 
the incidence/probability of adverse events. A minor trend was observed for arthralgia, headache and 
nausea, but in general the probability were below 25%. Therefore, no significant exposure-safety 
relationship in patients with gMG is observed in Study ALXN1210-MG-306. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology properties of ravulizumab in patients with gMG have been characterized in 
86 patients receiving ravulizumab and 89 subjects receiving placebo (Study ALXN1210-MG-306). The 
modelling strategy and study design conditions seem appropriate to achieve the planned objectives. A 
previously developed population PK model in patients with PNH has been applied, showing its ability to 
characterize the observed data. 
The available clinical pharmacology data submitted supports the use of ravulizumab in the approved 
indication.

2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The ravulizumab dosing regimen was designed based on modelling and simulation analyses using data 
from healthy subjects and patients with PNH and aHUS to maintain efficacious concentrations across the 
longer dosing interval.  
The body weight-based ravulizumab treatment regimen proposed for adult patients with gMG is identical 
to the one approved for PNH and aHUS which includes a loading dose on Day 1, followed by maintenance 
doses on Day 15 and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter, administered by IV infusion (Table 15 ).

Treatments 
During the Randomized-Controlled Period, patients received a weight-based loading dose of ravulizumab 
(Table 19) or placebo on Day 1 followed by blinded maintenance doses of ravulizumab or placebo on 
Day 15 and then once every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter. Both ravulizumab and placebo were administered 
by IV infusion.

Following completion of the Day 183 (Week 26) assessments, in order to maintain the blind of the 
Randomized-Controlled Period, patients in the placebo group received a blinded loading dose of 
ravulizumab (2400 mg for those weighing ≥ 40 to < 60 kg, 2700 mg for those weighing ≥ 60 to < 100 
kg, or 3000 mg for those weighing ≥ 100 kg). Patients in the ravulizumab group received a blinded 
ravulizumab dose of 900 mg starting at Week 28, all patients began open-label ravulizumab 
maintenance dosing q8w. 
Throughout  the  study,  rescue  therapy  (eg,  high-dose  corticosteroid,  PE/PP,  or  IVIg)  was  allowed  if  a 
patient  experienced  protocol-defined  Clinical  Deterioration.    For  this  protocol,  Clinical  Deterioration  is 
defined as any of the following: 
1. Patients who experience an MG Crisis, which is defined as weakness from MG that is severe enough 
to  necessitate  intubation  or  to  delay  extubation  following  surgery.  The  respiratory  failure  is  due  to 
weakness of respiratory muscles. Severe bulbar (oropharyngeal) muscle weakness often accompanies 
the respiratory muscle weakness, or may be the predominant feature in some patients; or, 
2. Significant symptomatic worsening to a score of 3 or a 2-point worsening from Baseline on any one 
of the individual MG-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) items other than double vision or eyelid droop; 
or, 
3. Administration of rescue therapy to a patient whose, in the opinion of the Investigator or Investigator-
designated  physician,  health  would  be  in  jeopardy,  if  rescue  therapy  were  not  given  (eg,  emergent 
situations). 
During the OLE period, all patients from investigative sites in the concerned countries will switch from 
the 10 mg/mL to the 100 mg/mL formulation of ravulizumab with no change to the weight-based dose 
regimen until end of the study (Section 4.5). Following the formulation change, all subsequent 
ravulizumab doses will use the 100 mg/mL formulation

Sample size 
The  power  calculations  were  based  on  the  longitudinal  change  from  baseline  in  MG-ADL  total  score 
observed in REGAIN (Study ECU-MG-301 - the Phase 3 study conducted with eculizumab in refractory 
gMG patients). The treatment effect (difference between the eculizumab and the placebo arms in mean 
change (95% CI) from baseline to Week 6 for MG-ADL) was estimated to be -1.9 (-3.27, -0.55) and the 
estimated common SD was 3.7.  Based on these parameter estimates and the assumption that Study 
ALXN1210-MG-306 would provide similar results, a total of N = 160 patients was required to ensure at 
least 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of no treatment effect for MG-ADL at the Type I error rate 
= 5% (2-sided) based on a t-statistic for 2 independent samples.

Patients  were  stratified  by  region  (North  America,  Europe,  Asia-Pacific,  and  Japan)  and  were  then 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the ravulizumab or placebo group. 
Blinding (masking) 
All  investigative  site  personnel,  Sponsor  staff,  Sponsor  designees,  staff  directly  associated  with  the 
conduct of the study, and all patients were blinded to patient treatment assignments. The double-blind 
was maintained by using identical study drug kits and labels for ravulizumab and placebo. The placebo 
had an identical appearance to that of ravulizumab.  
After the 26-Week Randomized- Controlled Period and assessments on Day 183 (Week 26), patients in 
the placebo group received a blinded loading dose of ravulizumab and patients in the ravulizumab group 
received a blinded ravulizumab dose of 900 mg.  
Starting at Week 28, all patients will begin open-label ravulizumab maintenance doses q8w. For patients 
in the ravulizumab group, a blinded ravulizumab dose of 900 mg was chosen to ensure maintenance of 
complete C5 inhibition until the next scheduled maintenance dose at Week 28 (Day 197). 
Statistical methods 
The primary hypothesis for this study is that ravulizumab is superior to placebo in improving MG-ADL 
total  score  at  Week  26.  The  treatment  effect  based  on  the  primary  endpoint  was  estimated  by  the 
difference in means between the ravulizumab group and the placebo group in the change from Baseline

in MG-ADL total score at Week 26 irrespective of rescue therapy. A lower value of the corresponding 
estimate indicates a beneficial treatment effect. 
The  following  secondary  hypotheses  were  included  in  step-wise  multiplicity  adjustment  (provided  the 
null hypothesis for primary endpoint was rejected) 
1. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in improvement of QMG total score at Week 26. 
2. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in QMG 5-point response (≥ 5-point improvement from baseline 
in QMG total score) at Week 26. 
3. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in improvement of the MG-QOL15r total score at Week 26. 
4. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in improvement of Neuro-QOL Fatigue total score at Week 26. 
5. Ravulizumab is superior to placebo in MG-ADL 3-point response (≥ 3-point improvement from baseline 
in MG-ADL total score) at Week 26. 
The  study  was  designed  to  control  the  overall  2-sided  Type  I  error  of  α  =  0.05.  The  primary  null 
hypothesis  was  to  be  tested  first  at  α=0.05.  If  statistically  significant,  5  secondary  hypotheses  were 
tested for superiority using a closed-testing procedure with the following order: 
1. Change from Baseline in QMG total score at Week 26 
2. Proportion of patients with improvement of at least 5 points in the QMG total score from baseline at 
Week 26 
3. Change from Baseline in MG-QOL15r at Week 26 
4. Change from Baseline in Neuro-QOL Fatigue at Week 26 
5. Proportion of patients with improvement of at least 3 points in the MG-ADL total score from baseline 
at Week 26 
The testing proceeded from (#1) to (#5), and if statistical significance was not achieved (p-value >0.05), 
then  subsequent  endpoints  were  not  considered  statistically  significant.  Estimates  and  CIs  were 
computed for all these secondary endpoints regardless of the outcome of the closed testing procedure. 
Under this prespecified closed testing procedure, no adjustment of the Type I error was required. 
Analysis Populations 
The following analysis sets are defined in the SAP: 
•  Randomized  Set:  All  patients  who  were  randomized.  Patients  were  analyzed  according  to  the 
treatment they were randomized to receive, regardless of the treatment received. 
• 
• 
Full Analysis Set: All randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
Per Protocol Set: All patients in the Full Analysis Set without any major protocol deviations during 
the  Randomized-Controlled  Period  and  who  met  all  of  the  prespecified  criteria  outlined  in 
Appendix 16.1.9 SAP Section 6.2 
•  Modified Full Analysis Set: A subset of patients in the Full Analysis Set which excludes patients 
who were impacted by COVID-19 during the Randomized-Controlled Period (details provided in 
Appendix 16.1.9 SAP Addendum 1.0) 
•  Safety Set: All patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug (ravulizumab or placebo). 
Patients were analyzed according to the treatment they actually received (must have received 
that treatment for the entire duration of the Randomized-Controlled Period).

PK Analysis Set: All patients who received at least 1 dose of ravulizumab and who had at least 
1 post-baseline PK concentration available 
•  Ravulizumab Treated Set: All patients who received at least 1 dose of ravulizumab either in the 
Randomized-Controlled Period or the Open-Label Extension Period 
•  Open-Label Extension Set: All patients who received at least 1 dose of ravulizumab starting from 
Week 26 and who have completed Week 52 study visit or who would have completed Week 52

have completed Week 52 study visit or withdrew from the study prior to Week 52 
The FAS will be the primary population used for the analyses of all efficacy endpoints for the Randomized-
Controlled  Period.  Sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  will  also  be 
conducted  using  the  PPS.  The  Randomized-Controlled  Period  Baseline  is  defined  as  the  last  available 
assessment value prior to first study drug infusion. In general, the baseline assessment will be the Day 
1 assessment. For QMG and MGC, in the event that cholinesterase inhibitor was not withheld for at least 
10 hours prior to administration of the QMG and MGC tests, the Screening Visit assessment will be used 
as Baseline. If cholinesterase inhibitor was not withheld for at least 10 hours for these visits, the Day 1 
assessment will be used as Baseline. 
Efficacy analyses of MG-ADL and QMG total scores will be performed on the OLEES. The OLE Baseline is 
defined  as  the  last  available  assessment  prior  to  first  study  drug  administered  in  the  OLE  Period.  In 
general, the OLE Baseline assessment will be the Day 183 assessment. In the event that cholinesterase 
inhibitor was not withheld for at least 10 hours prior to administration of the QMG test, the prior visit 
assessment will be used as baseline. 
Primary Analysis 
The primary endpoint is change from Baseline in MG-ADL total score at Week 26 of the Randomized-
Controlled Period. 
Change from Baseline in MG-ADL total score at Week 26 was analyzed using a mixed-effect model for 
repeated measures (MMRM; [Mallinckrodt 2001, 2004]). The model will include the MG-ADL change from 
Baseline  score  at  each  prespecified  time  point  (Weeks  1,  2,  4,  10,  12,  18,  and  26)  as  the  response 
variable, fixed categorical effects of treatment, study visit and treatment-by-study visit interaction, the 
randomization stratification variable region; as well as fixed covariate of baseline MG-ADL total score. 
An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the correlations among repeated measurements 
within each patient. If this analysis fails to converge, the following structures will be tested and the final 
covariance  structure  will  be  determined  by  Akaike’s  information  criterion:  first  order  autoregressive, 
compound symmetry, and Toeplitz method. A difference in treatment effect between the ravulizumab 
and  placebo  treatment  groups  along  with  a  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval (CI)  and  p-value  will  be 
calculated. The Kenward-Rogers method will be used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. 
Missing data will not be imputed for the primary analysis. Similar summaries will be presented for the 
other Randomized-Controlled Period study visits. Absolute levels and the change in MG-ADL total score 
will be summarized by treatment group and visit. 
Subgroup Analyses 
The following subgroups by treatment group were considered: Region, gender, race, age at first study 
drug infusion (18 to 65 years and > 65 years), IST use at baseline (corticosteroid, corticosteroid + IST, 
none),  years  from  diagnosis  to  informed  consent  (≤  median,  >median),  MGFA  (II,  III,  and  IV),  and 
baseline body weight categories (≥ 40 to < 60 kg, ≥ 60 to < 100 kg, and ≥ 100 kg). If the number of

patients for a given subgroup category was less than 10, then the category maybe collapsed with another 
category. 
Amendments of the analysis plan Prior to Unblinding or Database Lock 
Additional analyses were implemented through Addendum 1.0 (dated 03 Dec 2020) and Addendum 2.0 
Version 1.0 (dated 10 Jun 2021) to the final SAP. 
The SAP Addendum 1.0 included changes required to address the impact of COVID-19 on the planned 
analyses as described in the Final SAP Version 1.0. The study objectives for this study did not change. 
Additionally,  the  originally  planned  statistical  methodology  as  specified  in  SAP  Version  1.0  has  not 
changed. 
The SAP Addendum 2.0 included additional summaries of MG therapies for the Safety Set, additional MG 
therapy categories for subgroups for primary and secondary endpoint analyses of the Full Analysis Set, 
additional  covariance  structures  in  the  mixed-effect  model  for  repeated  measures  (MMRM)  for  the 
secondary endpoints of at least 3-point improvement in MG-ADL and at least 5-point improvement in 
QMG from baseline to Week 26, and a summary of  treatment-emergent AEs  during the Randomized-
Controlled  Period  utilizing  standardised  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  query 
(narrow)  (SMQ[N])  of  hypersensitivity  for  the  Safety  Set  (to  replace  the  infusion-related  reaction 
summary). 
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 242 screened patients, 67 patients were screen failures. The most common (≥ 5%) reasons for 
screen failure were not having a positive serologic test for anti-AChR antibodies at screening (n = 25) 
and not having an MG-ADL profile ≥ 6 (n = 16). Twenty-two patients failed initial screening but met all 
entry criteria upon second screening and were subsequently enrolled in the study. 
In total, 175 patients were randomized and treated (placebo: N = 89; ravulizumab: N = 86) (Figure 9). 
Thirteen patients withdrew from the study prior to completing the Randomized-Controlled Period: 3 due 
to  patient  decision;  3  due  to  physician  decision,  2  due  to  AEs  ;  2  deaths  (cerebral  hemorrhage  and 
COVID-19 pneumonia; 1 due to noncompliance with study drug; 1 due to protocol violation, and 1 due 
to other/Sponsor decision. 
As of the clinical data cutoff date, 75 of the 79 patients in the Open-Label Extension Set (ie, patients 
who had received at least 1 dose of ravulizumab starting from Week 26 and who had reached Week 52 
or would have completed the Week 52 Visit by the data cutoff dates but had withdrawn from the study 
prior to Week 52) had completed the Week 52 Visit (Table 20). Four of the 79 patients in the Open-Label 
Extension Set had withdrawn from the study during the Open-Label Extension Period (2 due to patient 
decision and 2 deaths due to COVID-19).

Important deviations were reported for 41 (23.4%) patients during the Randomized-Controlled Period 
(Table 22). Additional details on each type of deviation are provided below.  
Following  the  assessment  of  all  important  protocol  deviations,  Alexion  concluded  that  none  were 
considered to have impacted the safety of the patients or the reliability of the study data.

Analysis Set) 
Note: Percentages were based on the number of patients in the respective treatment group and may add to more 
than 100% since a patient may have more than 1 important protocol deviation. Protocol deviations due to COVID-19 
are also presented in the overall column. 
Abbreviation: COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019 
Since this study was conducted during the COVID 19 pandemic, it was anticipated that some patients 
would not be able to travel to the study site on the protocol-specified visit days and would potentially 
receive study drug outside of the dosing window. Therefore, the calculation for treatment compliance 
was modified from being based on the “number of scheduled doses given/number of expected scheduled 
doses”  to  reflect  the  percentage  of  time  during  the  Randomized-Controlled  Period  that  patients  were 
considered  to  have  complete  terminal  complement  inhibition  (ie,  100%  –  sum  [percentage  of  time 
patients were noncompliant with scheduled doses]).

Table 24: Baseline Disease Characteristics (Full Analysis Set) (cont.) 
Prior Therapy 
Overall, usage of non-MG medications prior to the start of the study was similar between the placebo 
and  ravulizumab  groups.  The  most  commonly used  (in  ≥  25% of  total  patients)  non-MG  medications 
were drugs for peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (49.7%); lipid-modifying agents, plain 
(34.9%); and vitamin A and D, including combinations of the two (32.0%).  
All patients used MG therapy (including symptomatic therapies) prior to the start of the study and usage 
was similar between the placebo and ravulizumab groups. Overall, the most common (in ≥ 25% of total 
patients)  MG  medications  used  prior  to  study  treatment  were  pyridostigmine  bromide  (77.7%), 
prednisone (51.4%), mycophenolate mofetil (32.6%), azathioprine (31.4%), and immunoglobulins not 
otherwise specified (28.6%).  The majority (50.9%) of patients used only 2 ISTs with the most common 
(20%) combination being corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil. Within 2 years prior to Screening, 
19.4% of patients used any PE/PP and 43.4% of patients used IVIg. 
Concomitant Therapy 
Overall, 97.7% of patients (100% in the ravulizumab and 95.5% in placebo group) took at least 1 non-
MG  concomitant  medication  during  the  Randomized-Controlled  Period.  Of  note,  patients  in  the 
ravulizumab group used lipid modifying agents (ravulizumab: 44.2%; placebo: 27.0%), blood glucose 
lowering drugs, excluding insulin (ravulizumab: 29.1%; placebo: 19.1%), and selective calcium channel

blockers with mainly vascular effects (ravulizumab: 22.1%; placebo: 12.4%) more than those patients 
in the placebo group.  
The  most  commonly  reported  (in  ≥  25%  of  patients)  groupings  of  concomitant  non-MG  medications 
other  than  meningococcal  vaccine  were  drugs  for  peptic  ulcer  and  gastro-esophageal  reflux  disease 
(52.6%); other analgesics and antipyretics (41.1%); lipid-modifying agents, plain (35.4%); vitamin A 
and D, including combinations of the two (35.4%); antithrombotic agents (26.9%); anti-inflammatory 
and antirheumatic products, non-steroids (25.7%); and calcium (25.1%). 
Regarding  MG  medications,  a  majority  of  patients  (69.1%)  were  taking  corticosteroids  at  the  time  of 
their  first  dose  of  study  drug  in  the  Randomized-Controlled  Period  (placebo:  73.0%;  ravulizumab 
65.1%). Almost half (47.4%) of patients were using only 2 ISTs (placebo: 52.8%; ravulizumab 41.9%); 
the  most  common  (18.3%)  combination  was  corticosteroids  and  mycophenolate  mofetil  (placebo: 
22.5%; ravulizumab 14.0%). 
A  majority  (70.3%)  of  patients  continued  to  take  corticosteroids  during  the  Randomized-Controlled 
Period  (placebo:  74.2%;  ravulizumab  66.3%).  Change  (introduction,  discontinuation,  or  increased  or 
decreased dosage) of ISTs occurred in 24% of patients overall (placebo: 21%; ravulizumab 27%) during 
the Randomized-Controlled Period. The most common change was use of new immunoglobulins due to 
MG symptoms worsening (10.0%). Most of the changes in ISTs were either allowable or not clinically 
significant.  
Overall, MG medications (other than IVIg) used by ≥ 25% of patients during the Randomized-Controlled 
Period were pyridostigmine bromide (65.7%), prednisone (45.1%), and mycophenolate mofetil (26.9%). 
During the Randomized-Controlled Period, 10.3% of patients used IVIg (placebo: 14.6%; ravulizumab: 
5.8%) and 1.7% of patients used any PE/PP (placebo: 1.1%; ravulizumab: 2.3%). 
All  patients  used  concomitant  MG  medications  during  the  Open-Label  Extension  Period.  Overall, 
concomitant  MG  medications  (other  than  IVIg)  used  in  ≥  25%  of  patients  during  the  Open-Label 
Extension  Period  were  pyridostigmine  bromide  (64.6%),  prednisone  (54.4%),  and  mycophenolate 
mofetil (34.2%). 
The most commonly used IST during the Open-Label Extension Period was corticosteroids (72.2%). A 
total  of  39.2%  of  patients  used  only  2  ISTs  during  the  Open-Label  Extension  Period,  with  the  most 
common (21.5%) combination being corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil. 
During  the  Open-Label  Extension  Period,  6.3%  of  patients  used  IVIg  and  3.8%  of  patients  used  any 
PE/PP. 
In  the  Open-Label  Extension  Period  of  the  study,  physicians  had  the  option  to  adjust  IST  therapies. 
Approximately half (50.6%) of patients had a change in concomitant MG medication during the Open-
Label Extension Period. The most common change was a decrease in corticosteroids for systemic use, 
plain due to MG symptoms improved (26.6%) 
Compliance 
During the Randomized-Controlled Period, treatment compliance was 94.4% in the placebo group and 
96.5% in the ravulizumab group. Including the Open-Label Extension Period for the subset of patients 
who reached (or would have reached) 52 weeks of exposure as of the data cutoff date, the mean (SD) 
ravulizumab  exposure  presented  in  this  safety  summary  is  234.3  (86.65)  days  in  127 patients: 
258.2 (96.48) days  in  86  patients  randomized  to  ravulizumab  and  184  (6.78)  days  in  41  patients 
randomized  to  placebo  who  switched  to  ravulizumab  during  the  Open-Label  Extension  Period.  The 
majority (92.9%) of patients had 100% treatment compliance during the Ravulizumab Treatment Period 
(ie, since the first dose of ravulizumab).

The  least-squares  (LS)  mean  (SEM)  reduction  from  Baseline  to  Week  26  in  MG-ADL  total  score  was 
significantly greater in the ravulizumab group (-3.1 [0.38]) compared to the placebo group (-1.4 [0.37]) 
during  the  Randomized-Controlled  Period  (mean  treatment  difference:  -1.6  [0.49];  95%  confidence 
interval [CI]: -2.6, -0.7; p = 0.0009).  
In the ravulizumab group, improvement in MG-ADL total score was observed as early as Week 1 with 
improvement sustained through Week 26 (Figure 10).

Note: Baseline was defined as the last available assessment value prior to first study drug infusion. Estimates were 
based on MMRM that included treatment group, stratification factor region, and MG-ADL total score at baseline, study 
visit, and study visit by treatment group interaction. P-values were for the comparison of treatment groups in change 
from baseline. An unstructured covariance structure was used. 
* = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, and *** = p < 0.001 represent 2-sided nominal p-values. 
The change from Baseline in MG-ADL total score to Week 26 was consistent with the Full Analysis Set 
for the Per Protocol Set and Modified Full Analysis Set. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
The actual change from Baseline in the MG-ADL total score to Week 26 using pre-specified sensitivity 
analysis  is  summarized  for  the  Full  Analysis  Set.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  supported  the 
results of the primary analysis (Table 26).

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
A statistically significant improvement was observed in the ravulizumab group compared to the placebo 
group  for  the  first  2  of  the  5  secondary  endpoints  (ie,  QMG  and  QMG  responder)  according  to  a 
prespecified hierarchical testing order (Table 27). Since the treatment difference did not reach statistical 
significance for the change from baseline in MG QoL15r total score assessment (p = 0.0636), nominal p 
values are presented for change from Baseline in Neuro QoL Fatigue score and improvement of at least 
3 points in MG ADL total score at Week 26. Results for all secondary endpoints consistently favoured 
ravulizumab compared to placebo.

Updated Study ALXN1210-MG-306 results 
A CSR addendum was produced to provide further information for the 161 patients who received 1 or 
more doses of ravulizumab in the Open-Label Extension Period. Data available through 09 Nov 2021 for 
those  161  patients  demonstrate  that  clinically  meaningful  impacts  in  patients  with  generalized 
myasthenia  gravis  (gMG)  are  maintained  through  at  least  60  weeks  of  ravulizumab  treatment.  This 
updated analysis represents 141.6 patient-years of ravulizumab exposure. 
While all patients who entered the Open-Label Extension Period received ravulizumab, patients 
randomized to the ravulizumab group also received 26 weeks of ravulizumab treatment during the 
Randomized-Controlled Period (RAV/RAV group). Patients randomized to receive placebo during the 
Randomized-Controlled Period had their first dose of ravulizumab at the start of the Open-Label 
Extension Period (Day 183 Visit) (PBO/RAV group). 
Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) and Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) 
Improvement in the MG-ADL total score observed during the Randomized-Controlled Period in the 
RAV/RAV group was sustained from Week 26 through Week 60 during the Open-Label Extension Period 
(least squares [LS] mean change at Week 60; -4.0 [95% confidence interval [CI]-4.8, -3.1]). During 
the Open-Label Extension Period, a rapid and sustained improvement of a similar magnitude to that in 
the RAV/RAV group during the Randomized-Controlled Period for MG-ADL total score through Week 60 
was observed in the PBO/RAV group (LS mean change at Week 28: -3.2 [95% CI -4.0, -2.4]; LS mean 
change at Week 60 (-3.3 [95% CI -4.3, -2.2]).

Note: Randomized-Controlled Period Baseline was defined as the last available assessment value prior to first study 
drug infusion in the Randomized-Controlled Period Baseline. Week 26 represented the start of the Open-Label 
Extension Period. The Randomized-Controlled Period estimates are based on MMRM that includes treatment group, 
stratification factor region, baseline score, study visit, and study visit by treatment group interaction. Visits up to 
Week 26 were included in the model. The Open-Label Extension Period estimates are based on MMRM that includes 
stratification factor region, baseline score, and study visit. A model was fit for the ravulizumab and placebo of the 
Open-label Extension Set separately. Data up to Week 60 at data cut-off are included.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main efficacy data in support of this extension of indication application was obtained from one 
Phase III clinical trial (Study ALXN1210-MG-306; Study MG-306). 
This submission was initially based on data from the 26-week double-blind phase (completed) and the 
available results from the extension phase (still ongoing) as of the first data cut-off date (11 May 
2021). Additional data, was provided during the procedure, for the 161 patients who received 1 or 
more doses of ravulizumab in the extension period collected up to the Week 60 visit in the Open-Label 
Extension Period as of the data cut-off date (09 Nov 2021).  
The selection criteria defined subjects with confirmed diagnosis of gMG (determined by the presence of 
AchR  antibodies  and  electrophysiological/pharmacological  confirmation)  who  were  symptomatic  (MG-
ADL ≥6) in spite of being treated with current standard of care. 
Prior or concomitant MG treatment was not a requisite at baseline which could have led to inclusion of 
recently  diagnosed  patients.  However,  in  the  study  only  one  randomized  patient  was  not  previously 
treated.  Patients having received recent treatment with rituximab or IVIg/PE were excluded as well as 
those who had been previously treated with eculizumab.  
A  total  of  242  patients  were  screened,  of  which  175  patients  were  randomized  (86  patients  to  the 
ravulizumab group and 89 patients to the placebo group). A total of 158 patients (90.3%) entered the 
Open-Label extension: 77 (89.5%) in ravulizumab arm and 81 (91.0%) in placebo arm. Only the data 
from 79 patients (38 patients from the ravulizumab group and 41 patients from the placebo group) who 
reached Week 52 by the time of the data cut-off are available for analysis. This is an important limitation 
for the assessment of the maintenance of the effect.   
In Study MG-306 most of demographics and disease characteristics at baseline were well balanced over 
treatment  arms  and  the  population  is  considered  to  have  been  adequately  selected  and  is  as 
representative of the EU. 
Most of the patients had moderate to severe weakness affecting muscles other than the ocular muscles 
(66% MGFA Class III/IV), all had received prior treatment for their condition and most of them were 
treated at entry with more than one MG medication. Patients presented with a mean MG-ADL total score 
of  9.0,  and  the  mean  QMG  total  score  of  15.0.  As  such,  CHMP  considered  that  in  spite  of  previous 
treatments,  the  patient  population  included  in  the  trial  showed  a  relevant  disease  burden  in  order  to 
assess the effect of ravulizumab in the approved indication.  
The proposed dosing regimen is based on body weight and is identical to that approved for the treatment 
of PHN and aHUS (for further discussion on the approved dosing regimen please refer to the discussion 
on clinical pharmacology above section 2.3.5). This is considered adequate by CHMP. 
Patients  on  placebo,  who  entered  the  OLE  period,  received  a  loading  dose  of  ravulizumab  and  those 
treated  with  ravulizumab  in  the  randomized  controlled  period  received  a  blinded  dose  of  900  mg  of 
ravulizumab to ensure maintenance of complete complement component 5 (C5) inhibition until the next 
scheduled maintenance dose.  
During the double-blind period ravulizumab was administered in a 10 mg/mL formulation. During the 
OLE period a total of 35 patients were switched to a 100 mg/mL formulation following the same dosing 
regimen than that received during the controlled period. The 74 patients from the US did not receive 
this  formulation,  apparently  due  to  the  lack  of  availability  for  supplying  the  product  during  the  study 
The CHMP adopted a report on similarity of Ultomiris with Soliris (Eculizumab) and

duration. Apart from the differences between both formulations, those regarding qualitative composition, 
preparation, or administration conditions were not considered clinically relevant.  
With respect to the impact of COVID 19 pandemic on the conduct of the study a total of five patients (3 
patients on placebo and 2 patients on ravulizumab) missed a total of 6 infusions due to COVID-19 (3 
placebo patients missed 1 infusion each and 2 ravulizumab-treated patients missed 1 and 2 infusions 
each). Patients on ravulizumab treatment and 2 patients on placebo did not receive further doses after 
COVID-19  and  discontinued  the  study.  One  placebo  patient  received  a  scheduled  dosing.  CHMP 
considered that since only a low number of patients missed infusions due to COVID-19 and this affected 
both arms in a similar way, no impact on the efficacy or safety results is expected. 
Plasma exchange (PE), plasmapheresis (PP), and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) have been shown 
to  reduce  ravulizumab  serum  levels  As  such,  regarding  the  need  for  a  supplemental  dose  in  case  of 
plasma  exchange  (PE),  plasmapheresis  (PP),  or  intravenous  immunoglobulin  (IVIg  additional 
clarifications  were  requested  by  the  CHMP  on  whether  the  proposed  supplemental  dose  resulted  in 
comparable exposure over time. Simulations in four scenarios were performed where the rescue therapy 
with  plasma  exchange  (PE),  plasmapheresis  (PP)  or  intravenous  immunoglobulin  (IVIg)  could  be 
potentially administered: a) immediately after the loading dose (Day 1); b) at 2 weeks after the loading 
dose (immediately before the first maintenance dose on Day 15); c) immediately after any maintenance 
dose; and d) at 8 weeks after any maintenance dose (immediately before the next maintenance dose). 
The  body  weight  strata  were  also  taken  into  account.  The  simulations  performed  show  that  the 
recommended  supplemental  doses  of  ravulizumab  did  not  lead  to  apparent  drug  accumulation.  
Therefore,  a  supplemental  dose  of  ravulizumab  IV  is  recommended  immediately  after  each  PP  or  PE 
session or complete IVIg course. This information is appropriately reflected in section 4.2 of the Product 
Information (PI). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The evaluation of efficacy of ravulizumab focused on the assessment of the gMG signs and symptoms 
by the patient (MG-ADL; primary endpoint) and the physician (QMG; main secondary endpoint).  
The primary endpoint was the change in MG-ADL score reported by the patient. At Week 26 ravulizumab 
arm  showed  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  MG-ADL  score  from  baseline  irrespective  of  rescue 
therapy in comparison with placebo.   Patients in the ravulizumab treatment group showed a 3.1-point 
reduction  whereas  patients  receiving  placebo  showed  a  1.4-point  reduction  (mean  difference:  -1.6 
[0.49]; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.6, -0.7; p = 0.0009).    
The MG-ADL responder criterion was met in 48 (56.7%) patients in the ravulizumab group compared to 
30  (34.1%)  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  Of  note,  this  analysis  was  not  considered  (formally) 
statistically significant according to the prespecified hierarchical testing for secondary endpoints.   
Main secondary endpoints assessed the effect of ravulizumab by the physician (QMG total score; QMG 
responder rate). A statistically significant difference was observed between ravulizumab and placebo (-
2.0  [-3.2,  -0.8];  p=0.009).  More  patients  on  ravulizumab  showed  significantly  better  control  of  the 
disease. 30% of patients on ravulizumab had ≥ 5 point reduction in the QMG total score compared with 
11.3% placebo (OR 3.350 [95% CI 1.443, 7.777]; p=0.0052). 
Of note, the efficacy analyses were conducted irrespective of the rescue therapy received by the patients 
in  case  of  clinical  deterioration.  Additional  analyses were  conducted  based  on rescue  therapy:  one  of 
them includes the change from baseline in MG-ADL total score up to the time of rescue therapy and the 
second  excludes  the  22  patients  requiring  rescue  therapy  (14  placebo-  and  8  ravulizumab-treated 
The CHMP adopted a report on similarity of Ultomiris with Soliris (Eculizumab) and 
Vyvgart (efgartigimod alfa) on

patients). The results do not suggest that the use of rescue therapy has had a significant impact on the 
response to ravulizumab. 
According  to  the  testing  hierarchy,  the  remaining  three  secondary  endpoints  (change  in  MG-QOL15r 
score,  change  in  Neuro-QoL  fatigue  scale,  MG-ADL  responder  rate)  were  not  considered  statistically 
significant even if results numerically favoured ravulizumab compared to placebo. 
MG Composite Scale results were in line with those observed for MG-ADL score and QMG scales. Patients 
treated with both ravulizumab and with placebo experienced a reduction in the scores (ravulizumab -6.1 
[0.73], placebo -3.2 [0.71]). The difference was statistically significant (-2.9 [0.93]; 95% CI: -4.8, -
1.1; p = 0.0019) although the clinical relevance is perceived as borderline considering the three-point 
reduction threshold established as clinically meaningful in the literature.   
Achieving improvement with minimal manifestations of the disease was reported in 25.6% of patients in 
the ravulizumab group compared to 9.9% of patients in the placebo group at Week 26. More patients 
treated with placebo than those receiving ravulizumab suffered clinical deterioration (18 [20.2%] vs. 10 
[11.6%])  or  required  rescue  therapy  (14  [15.7%]  vs.  8  [9.3%])  during  the  study.  Similarly,  fewer 
patients  on  ravulizumab  needed  hospitalization  due  to  MG  during  the  26  week  period  of  treatment 
compared to placebo (7 [8%] vs. 3 [3%]).  
No  important  differences  were  observed  between  ravulizumab  and  placebo  in  subgroups  studied 
according region, sex, race, age, disease characteristics or body weight.  
Overall, ravulizumab showed an effect over placebo on the control of symptoms assessed by the patient 
(MG-ADL score, primary endpoint) and by the physician (QMG score; secondary endpoint) in a population 
with an established condition of moderate severity in spite of concomitant MG therapy. This is consistent 
with the MGC score results, a scale derived from the other two scales mentioned above.  
However,  the  clinical  meaningfulness  of  the  observed  changes  versus  the  respective  established 
thresholds  was  questioned  by  the  CHMP.  CHMP  considered  that    the  fact  that  the  analyses  were 
performed irrespective of whether rescue therapy was used could introduce a confounding factor in the 
assessment of the efficacy of ravulizumab. The small (absolute) differences between groups in relevant 
clinical  aspects  such  as  required  rescue  therapy  (difference  6.4%),  clinical  deterioration  experienced 
(difference 8.6%) or need of hospitalization due to MG (difference 5%) additionally put into question the 
benefit of the product in the management of MG. 
The statistically significant reduction experienced in symptoms of 1.6 points in the mean change in MG-
ADL  score  (primary  endpoint)  with  respect  to  baseline  during  the  randomized  controlled  period  was 
considered as a modest effect. This also applied to the observed findings in the main secondary endpoints 
when they were expressed in terms of absolute changes of the respective scales. 
CHMP  acknowledged  that  Study  MG-306  included  a  population  on  IST  treatment  with  remaining 
symptomatology in whom an effect may be difficult to evidence due to the limited room for improvement 
and the fluctuating nature of the condition.  
As stated, the clinical relevance of the treatment effect could be questioned based on the fact that it did 
not  achieve  the  accepted  thresholds  for  clinical  meaningfulness  for  the  utilized  scales  established  in 
literature  (i.e.  MCID  of  2  point22,23).  However,  it  should  be  considered  that  this  difference  has  been 
defined  by  absolute  change  from  baseline  in  individual  patients,  and  not  as  differences  in  average 
changes  between  groups24.  In  this  regard  these  thresholds  should  be  used  for  individual  responder

analyses  and  not  as  a  reference  point  for  a  population-average  drug-placebo  treatment  effect. 
Admittedly, this criterion could be considered as a cut-off value in responder analysis, as this is based 
on an “individual level” approach. In this respect 63.9% of patients treated with ravulizumab and 53.0% 
of patients treated with placebo showed a 2-point reduction in MG-ADL score, with the reported 10.9% 
difference being of difficult interpretation. Moreover, the measured difference between ravulizumab and 
placebo did not achieve the treatment effect of 1.9 points on the MG-ADL score used at the planning 
stage.  
 An estimation of the effect size for the primary and secondary endpoints (MG-ADL and QMG scales) was 
provided in order to inform about the magnitude of treatment effects, showing an Hedge’s g effect size 
of -0.49 and -0.50, respectively, which is defined as a moderate effect.  
While there are some uncertainties on the clinical relevance of the treatment effect size, the totality of 
the demonstrated effects has to be considered. In this respect, the CHMP considered that the observed 
treatment effects are consistent across the responder rates reported both from the patient’s (MG-ADL) 
and physician’s perspective (QMG). It should also be highlighted that more stringent criteria led to clearer 
differences between the ravulizumab and the placebo groups.  
From the patient perspective (QoL measures), the changes in the MG-QOL15r score and in the Neuro-
QoL  fatigue  scale  were  not  statistically  significant  even  if  results  numerically  favoured  ravulizumab 
compared to placebo.  
Supportive evidence derives also from the clinical impact of ravulizumab in the course of the disease. 
Ravulizumab treated patients experienced less clinical deterioration, less MG-related hospitalization 
and required less rescue therapy than placebo treated patients (Table 3 above). The interpretation of 
these outcomes is limited by the reduced numbers of events by group and the exploratory nature of 
the endpoints. However, a consistent response has been shown in the scales measured, which 
reinforces the observed effect.   During the extension period, where changes in background therapy 
were allowed, 50.3% of patients had a change in concomitant MG medication.  The most common 
change was a decrease in corticosteroids for systemic use due to MG symptoms improved (20.7%) 
with 11 (6.5%) patients discontinuing corticosteroids for systemic use.  
Whereas some uncertainties still remain (e.g., what treatment effect size with respect to placebo is to 
be considered clinically relevant) the totality of the data submitted supports the conclusion that 
efficacy has been sufficiently demonstrated in order to support the use of ravulizumab in the approved 
indication. 
Maintenance of the effect 
Maintenance of the effect of ravulizumab beyond 6 month treatment is based on the still ongoing open 
label period, where all patients involved in Study MG-306 are treated with ravulizumab and followed up 
to 2 years.  An update of the Study MG-306 with a clinical database cut-off date of 09 Nov 2021 was 
provided during the assessment of this applicaton. Additional data from the 161 patients who received 
1 or more doses of ravulizumab in the extension period collected up to the Week 60 visit in the Open-
Label Extension Period was provided.  All patients received treatment with ravulizumab during the 
Open-Label Extension Period, including patients randomized to ravulizumab and patients randomized 
to placebo during the Randomized-Controlled Period (RAV/RAV and PBO/RAV group, respectively). 
When patients who received placebo in the randomized controlled period were treated with 
ravulizumab in the open-label extension period an improvement similar to that achieved by patients on 
active treatment in the first part of the study was observed. In patients previously treated with 
ravulizumab, the response was maintained.  
The CHMP adopted a report on similarity of Ultomiris with Soliris (Eculizumab) and 
Vyvgart (efgartigimod alfa) on  
EMA/686052/2022  
Page 66/99 
 
 
 
During this phase of the clinical trial background therapy could be adjusted. In this period 50.3% of 
patients had a change in concomitant MG medication.  The most common change was a decrease in 
corticosteroids for systemic use due to MG symptoms improved (20.7%) with 11 (6.5%) patients 
discontinuing corticosteroids for systemic use.  
With  the  limitations  given  by  the  open  label  design  and  the  fact  that  the  study  is  still  ongoing,  the 
maintenance of the effect was considered sufficiently established. The final results of the study will have 
to be submitted once available. 
Ravulizumab  is  structurally  related  to  eculizumab,  both  products  providing  sustained  inhibition  of 
complement component 5. It is therefore conceivable that gMG patients in treatment with eculizumab 
could be switched to ravulizumab seeking for more convenient administration if response is achieved. 
This is not the case in non-responder to eculizumab patients in whom non response to ravulizumab is 
likely. This information has been reflected in the SmPC.    
Wording of the indication 
The initial proposed indication was:  
“The treatment of adult patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive generalized 
myasthenia  gravis  (gMG)  with  remaining  symptomatology  despite  at  least  one  immunomodulatory 
therapy (see section 5.1).”  
CHMP considered that this proposal did not reflect the studied population. CHMP noted that the majority 
(50.9%) of patients used only 2 ISTs. In order to substantiate whether the use of immunomodulatory 
therapy (including the number of therapies received) has an impact on the efficacy of ravulizumab and 
defines the target population who should receive ravulizumab in clinical practice additional analyses were 
provided. With respect to prior use of IST, this does not appear to have a relevant impact on the effect 
of ravulizumab. And when it is observed it seems to be likely driven by the low number of subjects. 
With respect to the available evidence in other subsets of the population that are covered by the broad 
indication proposed, e.g. MFGA class IV and V subjects further clarifications have been presented. 
a.  there  were  only  9  patients  with  a  MGFA  Class  IV,  included  in  the  study.  The  mean  treatment 
difference  in  MG-ADL  total  score  was  -7.2  [3.26]  (95%  CI:  -14.9,  0.4;  p  =  0.0593).  The  mean 
treatment difference in QMG total score was -4.4 [2.35]; (95% CI: -9.4, 0.7; p =0.0836). The results 
do not suggest that ravulizumab does not have an effect in these patients.  
b.  patients with a MGFA Class V were excluded from the study. Available postmarketing data on the 
use of eculizumab nin Japan showing a similar response in these patients to that achieved by less 
severe  patients.  Give  the  similarities  with  ravulizumab  in  principle  there  are  not  reasons  for 
restricting the use of ravulizumab in this subset. However, the lack of Class V gMG patients treated 
with ravulizumab has been reflected in the SmPC.     
Further justifications were provided to address the concerns raised regarding the wording of the 
indication and the appropriateness of adopting an indication similar to that approved for eculizumab. It 
was highlighted that there are several differences between both clinical developments.  The provided 
justification aims at addressing various aspects: 
a)  There are differences in the selection criteria of pivotal study conducted with eculizumab (Study 
ECU-MG-301) and that conducted with ravulizumab (Study ALXN1210-MG-306). Whereas the 
patients enrolled in the eculizumab study were required to have failed to a previous treatment with

Vyvgart (efgartigimod alfa) on

≥2 IST or ≥1 IST + PE/IVIg, patients included in the ravulizumab study had no requirement for 
treatment failure. In this case the study allowed patients with/without concomitant treatment. 
b)  The comparison of the populations enrolled in eculizumab and ravulizumab studies shows that in 
general the eculizumab population had more severe disease at entry than the ravulizumab 
population.  
c)  Patients in the eculizumab study had received more lines of treatment than patients included in the 
ravulizumab study. 
• 
• 
In the eculizumab study 46.4% of patients had received ≥2 ISTs; 31.2% ≥3 ISTs and 
20.8% ≥4 ISTs; 79.2% had received IVIg and 48.0% PP/PE. 
In the ravulizumab study 19.4% of patients had received only 1 IST; 50.9% only 2 ISTs, 
43.4% had received IVIg and 19.4% PP/PE. A total of 6 patients had no received prior 
therapy at entry. 
d)  The concomitant treatment at entry in patients receiving ravulizumab was as follows: 10.3% of 
patients were receiving no concomitant treatment with ISTs, 42.3% were using only 1 IST, and 
47.4% were using 2 or more ISTs. These numbers have not been provided for eculizumab 
patients. 
In general, patients included in the eculizumab study seems to correspond to a more severe, more 
heavily treated patients, in accordance with the approved indication in a refractory population, while 
the patient population included in the ravulizumab study would justify granting a broader indication.  
As such, the wording of the approved indication for ravulizumab was amended as follows:      
“Ultomiris is indicated as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with gMG 
who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.” 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The effect of ravulizumab over placebo on the control of symptoms assessed by the patient (MG-ADL 
score, primary endpoint) and by the physician (QMG score; secondary endpoint) has been demonstrated. 
A consistent treatment effect has been shown based on available efficacy data that, even if of modest 
magnitude  in  the  short-term,  it  can  be  considered  a  sufficiently  robust  demonstration  of  the  clinical 
benefit  of  ravulizumab  when  added  to  standard  therapy  in  patients  with  gMG.  The  findings  from  the 
(updated) Extension open label period further support the maintenance of the effect in this population.  
The final results of the study will have to be submitted once available. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The overall safety evaluation is based on the following data from Study ALXN1210 MG 306: 
• 
Randomized Controlled Period – data for the randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled 26-
week treatment period. 
• 
Ravulizumab  Treatment  Period  –  data  through  the  52  week  data  cut-off  date  (11  May  2021) 
were included for patients who had reached Week 52 or were expected to reach Week 52 by the time of 
The CHMP adopted a report on similarity of Ultomiris with Soliris (Eculizumab) and

the data cutoff date (ie, including patients who had withdrawn from the study prior to Week 52). Results 
for the Ravulizumab Treatment Period include data from: 
• 
Patients treated with ravulizumab during the Randomized-Controlled Period regardless 
of whether the patients continued to receive treatment with ravulizumab during the Open-Label 
Extension Period (referred to as the RAV/RAV group) 
• 
Patients treated with placebo during the Randomized-Controlled Period and who switched 
to ravulizumab in the Open-Label Extension Period (referred to as the PBO/RAV group) 
All  safety  analyses  for  the  Randomized-Controlled  Period  are  presented  for  the  Safety  Set  which 
consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug (ravulizumab or placebo).  
All safety analyses for the Ravulizumab Treated Period are presented for the Ravulizumab Treated Set 
which consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose of ravulizumab either in the Randomized-
Controlled Period or the Open-Label Extension Period.   
Subgroup  analyses  were  based  on  geographic  region,  sex,  race,  age  at  first  study  drug  infusion, 
immunosuppressive therapy (IST) use at baseline, years from diagnosis to informed consent, baseline 
MGFA clinical classification, and baseline body weight categories. 
Patient exposure 
In total, 175 patients were randomized and treated (placebo: n = 89; ravulizumab: n = 86). Thirteen 
patients  withdrew  from  the  study  prior  to  completing  the  Randomized-Controlled  Period,  including 
2 patients who discontinued study drug due to AEs and 2 patients who died (cerebral hemorrhage and 
COVID-19 pneumonia). 
As  of  the  clinical  database  cutoff  date,  75  of  the  79  patients  in  the  Open-Label  Extension  Set  (ie,  all 
patients who received at least 1 dose of ravulizumab starting from Week 26 and who have completed 
Week 52 study visit or who would have completed Week 52 by the data cutoff date but withdrew from 
the study) had completed the Week 52 Visit. Four of the 79 patients in the Open-Label Extension Set 
had withdrawn from the study during the Open-Label Extension Period (2 due to patient decision and 2 
deaths due to COVID-19). A total of 75 patients were ongoing in the Open-Label Extension Period as of 
the  52-week  data  cutoff  date:  35  patients  who  received  ravulizumab  during  both  the  Randomized-
Controlled Period and the Open-Label Extension Period, and 40 patients who received placebo during the 
Randomized-Controlled Period and switched to ravulizumab in the Open-Label Extension Period.

Note: Reasons for study withdrawal due to COVID-19 are also presented in the overall column.  
a  Two additional patients were randomized in error: 1 patient was randomized but could not be dosed due to a water leak in the 
laminar hood while preparing study drug; patient was ultimately screen failed. Additionally, 1 patient was randomized and screen 
failed due to pyridostigmine not being withheld 10 hours prior to Screening assessments; this patient was subsequently re-screened 
and re-randomized (patient was counted in the “Randomized” row).

Overall, 50.9% of patients in the Safety Analysis Set were female; 73.1% were White, and the mean 
age was 55.6 years at the time of first infusion. The majority of patients (69.1%) were 18 to 65 years 
of age at the time of first infusion, and approximately half of the patients (53.7%) were in the weight 
category ≥ 60 kg to < 100 kg at baseline.  
Overall, 82 (47%) patients (placebo: 39 [44%]; ravulizumab: 43 [50%]) had hospitalizations within 2 
years prior to Screening; mean number of hospitalizations was 2.3 for both treatment groups. A majority 
of  these  patients  had  hospitalizations  related  to  MG  (placebo: 32/39 patients;  ravulizumab:  32/43 
patients); mean number of MG-related hospitalizations was 2.0 for both treatment groups. 
Adverse events 
The safety profile for ravulizumab was similar to that of placebo in adult patients with gMG during the 
26-week Randomized-Controlled Period (Table32).

As  of  the  data  cut-off  date,  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  (≥  10%  of  total  patients)  in  the 
Ravulizumab Treated Set, were headache (18.1%), diarrhoea (12.6%), and nausea (10.2%) (Table 36). 
Of the patients who experienced headaches, most of the AEs of headache (24 of 30 events) occurred 
during the first 6 months of treatment.

Note: The Ravulizumab Treated Set consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose of ravulizumab either in the Randomized-Controlled Period 
or the Open-Label Extension Period. Per scope, only data during the Randomized-Controlled Period were included for patients not expected to 
have Week 52 at data cutoff. This applied to both RAV/RAV and PBO/RAV patients. In summarizing n (%), if a patient had multiple events for 
a particular SOC or Preferred Term, the patient was counted only once for that SOC or Preferred Term. At the time of the data cutoff date, data 
for  only  13  patients  receiving  ravulizumab  treatment  > 12 months  were  available;  2  of  the  13  patients  reported  AEs  during  this  period 
(ALXN1210-MG-306 CSR Table 14.3.3.1.1.4). AEs were coded using MedDRA Version 24.0.

Adverse Events Through Week 60  
During the Ravulizumab Treatment Period, 88.8% of patients experienced at least 1 adverse event 
(AE; 881 events) (Table 37).  
At least 1 treatment-emergent serious adverse event (SAE) was experienced by 41 (24.3%) patients 
(75 events). Seven (4.1%) patients (10 events) had SAEs related to coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) or suspected COVID 19. Five (3%) patients experienced an SAE assessed as related to 
investigational product. 
A total of 3 patients in the RAV/RAV group had SAEs which led to discontinuation of study drug. SAEs 
of infected skin ulcer and COVID-19 pneumonia with fatal outcome occurred in 1 patient each during 
the Randomized Controlled Period; and 1 SAE of myasthenia gravis occurred in 1 patient during the 
Open-Label Extension Period.

Of the 881 AEs in the Ravulizumab Treatment Period, most AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. 
A total of 30 (17.8%) patients in the Ravulizumab Treated Set experienced AEs that had a maximum 
severity of Grade 3. All the Grade 3 AEs occurred in 1 patient each with the exception of pyrexia, 
pneumonia, syncope, dyspnea, urticaria, and hypertension (2 patients each) and myasthenia gravis (4 
patients).  
Seven (4.1%) patients experienced AEs that had a maximum severity of Grade 4 which included: 
headache, hypotension, vein rupture, appendicitis, arthritis bacterial, COVID-19 pneumonia, and 
suspected COVID-19.

Only 1 patient (placebo group) had an infusion reaction that was a SAE (infusion-related reaction) during 
the  Randomized-Controlled  Period.  Two  patients  in  the  placebo  group  had  infusion  interruptions  and 
withdrew from the study due to infusion reactions. One patient in the ravulizumab group had an infusion 
interruption due to infusion site extravasation on Day 69. 
Infusion Reactions Through Week 60  
Local (infusion site or injection site reactions), systemic (infusion-associated/infusion-related 
reactions), and immune-mediated reactions as defined in Table 40 were evaluated during the 
Randomized-Controlled Period. 
Table 40: Definitions for Infusion Reactions 
Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; SMQ = Standardized MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) 
Query  
A total of 59 (34.9%) patients reported infusion reactions during the Ravulizumab Treatment Period. 
The most common infusion reactions were headache (11.2%) and nausea (6.5%). A total of 9 
infusions in 8 patients had interruptions due to AEs. In 7 of the 8 patients, the infusion was 
subsequently re-started and completed.  
 Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Other Serious Adverse Events During the Randomized-Controlled Period 
Overall,  34  (19.4%)  patients  in  the  Safety  Set  experienced  1 or  more  SAEs  (51  events)  during  the 
Randomized-Controlled Period; 14 (15.7%) patients in the placebo group and 20 (23.3%) patients in 
the ravulizumab group (Table ).  
Four (4.5%) patients in the placebo group and 7 (8.1%) patients in the ravulizumab group had SAEs in 
the SOC of Infections and infestations: all SAEs of infections were observed in 1 patient each, with the 
exception  of  COVID-19  pneumonia  (ravulizumab:  n = 2)  and  cellulitis  (placebo:  n = 2).  A  higher 
percentage of patients in the ravulizumab group reported AEs in the SOCs of Infection and infestations 
and  Respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal  disorders.  The  AEs  reported  in  the  SOC  of  Respiratory,

thoracic,  and  mediastinal  disorders  were  consistent  with  symptoms  of  the  underlying  disease  and/or 
comorbid diseases. 
Two patients in the ravulizumab group had SAEs of transient ischemic attack; both events were assessed 
as not related to study drug by the Investigator: 1 patient had a history of supraventricular tachycardia, 
hypertension, and coronary artery disease and 1 patient had a history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia. 
Three patients had SAEs that resulted in discontinuation of study drug. 
Three patients had SAEs that resulted in interruption of study treatment: 2 patients in the placebo group 
(herpes zoster and cellulitis) and 1 patient in the ravulizumab group (bacterial arthritis). 
Six patients had SAEs that were assessed to be related to study drug by the Investigator; 4 patients in 
the placebo group (cellulitis: n = 2; herpes zoster: n = 1; and infusion-related reaction: n = 1) and 2 
patients in the ravulizumab group (dysphagia: n = 1; tendonitis: n = 1).  
One patient in the ravulizumab group had an SAE of suicide attempt; the patient was hospitalized on 
Day 122 and discharged on Day 132. The patient had a prior history of depression and suicide attempt 
and this event was assessed as not related to study drug by the Investigator.

Other Serious Adverse Events During Ravulizumab Treatment Period Through the Data Cutoff Date 
As of the 52-week data cutoff date, 27 (21.3%) patients in the Ravulizumab Treated Set had experienced 
1 or more SAEs during ravulizumab treatment (Table ). Overall, 12 (9.4%) patients reported SAEs in 
the  SOC  of  Infections  and  infestations  and  6  (4.7%)  patients  reported  SAEs  in  the  SOC  of  Nervous 
system disorders. 
For  the  patients  in  the  RAV/RAV group  who  experienced  SAEs,  most  SAEs  occurred  during  the 
Randomized-Controlled Period; 4 patients who were treated with ravulizumab during the Randomized-
Controlled Period had SAEs between > 6 to 12 months of ravulizumab treatment during the Open-Label 
Extension Period.  
Five  patients  in  the  PBO/RAV  group  had  SAEs  after  switching  to  ravulizumab  during  the  Open-Label 
Extension  Period.  One  patient  had  an  SAE  assessed  as  related  to  study  drug  during  the  Open-Label 
Extension Period which was due to “worsening of MG symptoms.”  
After the 52-week data cutoff date, 1 patient in the placebo group who switched to ravulizumab during 
the  Open-Label  Extension Period  had  a  non-fatal  SAE  of  meningitis  (unknown aetiology).  The  patient 
had  received  meningococcal  vaccination  prior  to  study  entry.  The  event  was  considered  by  the 
Investigator  to  be  related  to  ravulizumab  (compatible  with  partially  treated  bacterial  meningitis).  No 
action  was  taken  with  ravulizumab  in  response  to  this  event  and  the  patient  continued  to  receive 
ravulizumab in the study.

Note: The Ravulizumab Treated Set consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose of ravulizumab either in the Randomized-Controlled Period 
or the Open-Label Extension Period. Per scope, only data during Randomized-Controlled Period were included for patients not expected to have 
Week 52 at data cutoff. This applied to both RAV/RAV and PBO/RAV patients. In summarizing n (%), if a patient had multiple events for a 
particular SOC or Preferred Term, the patient was counted only once for that SOC or Preferred Term. AEs were coded using MedDRA Version 
24.0.

Deaths 
A total of 7 deaths occurred in the study by the time of 60-week CSR addendum (2 in the randomized 
control period and 5 in the Open Label Extension Period). None of the deaths were related to study drug 
by the Investigator. These deaths are summarized in the Table 43 below.

Adverse Events Related to COVID-19 
During the Randomized-Controlled Period, 4 (4.5%) patients in the placebo group and 5 (5.8%) patients 
in the ravulizumab group had COVID-19 related AEs per the MedDRA v24.0 SMQ search of “COVID-19.” 
None of these events was considered to be related to study drug by the Investigator. 
As of the data cutoff date, 9 total patients in the Ravulizumab Treated Set experienced COVID-19 related 
AEs  (ie,  includes  the  5  patients  in  the  ravulizumab  group  who  had  COVID-19  related  AEs  during  the 
Randomized-Controlled  Period).  However,  upon  additional  medical  review  1  of  the  9 patients  had  an 
event of viral pneumonia which was not confirmed to be related to COVID-19. None of these events was 
considered to be related to study drug by the Investigator.

Six patients had COVID-19 related SAEs; however, upon additional medical review 1 of the 6 patients 
had an SAE of viral pneumonia which was not confirmed to be related to COVID-19. Three patients died 
during  the  study  due  to  COVID-19;  all  3  patients  had  multiple  underlying  risk  factors  for  COVID-19 
complications (such as metabolic, respiratory, and cardiovascular disease and obesity). 
Laboratory findings 
There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters in Study ALXN1210-MG-306 that 
were of safety concern.  
•  Vital signs, physical examination, and ECG: No safety signals were identified. 
•  Columbia-Suicidal  Severity  Rating  Scale:  None  of  the  patients  in  the  ravulizumab  group  had 
suicidal  ideation  or  suicidal  behavior  at  the  timepoint  of  the  C-SSRS  evaluations  during  the 
Randomized-Controlled Period. Although suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior was not noted 
during the C-SSRS evaluation timepoints, it was noted that 1 patient in the ravulizumab group 
was hospitalized during the Randomized-Controlled Period due to a suicide attempt. This patient 
had a prior history of depression and suicide attempt; the SAE  was considered not related to 
study drug by the Investigator.  
• 
Pregnancy: No patients or partners became pregnant during the study.  
Immunogenicity 
No  treatment-emergent  ADA-positive  findings  were  observed  after  ravulizumab  administration  in  any 
patients during the Randomized-Controlled Period. All assay results for antidrug neutralizing antibodies 
were negative. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
Analyses of the safety profile by intrinsic factors (ie, sex, race, age, geographic location) identified no 
sensitive  subgroups  that  were  considered  to  have  an  influence  on  the  overall  safety  profile  of 
ravulizumab.. 
Extrinsic Factors 
Analyses  of  the  safety  profile  by  extrinsic  factors  (ie,  immunosuppressant  therapy  use  at  baseline) 
identified no sensitive subgroups that were considered to have an influence on the overall safety profile 
of  ravulizumab.  Some  extrinsic  factors,  including  immunosuppressant  therapy  use,  were  included  as 
categorical covariates in the population PK analysis. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with ravulizumab IV.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
During the Randomized-Controlled Period, 3 (3.4%) patients in the placebo group and 2 (2.3%) patients 
in the ravulizumab group discontinued study drug due to AEs:  
•  2 patients (placebo) discontinued study drug and withdrew from the study due to infusion-related 
reactions (1 SAE and 1 non-serious AE; both events were considered related to study drug by the 
Investigator)  
•  1 patient (placebo) discontinued study drug due to non-serious back pain (not related to study drug) 
and withdrew from the study due to physician decision on Day 101. 
•  1 patient (ravulizumab) discontinued study drug due to an SAE of infected skin ulcer (not related to 
study drug) and subsequently withdrew from the study on Day 153 due to physician decision 
•  1 patient (ravulizumab) died due to COVID-19 pneumonia  
As of the data cutoff date, 4 patients who received ravulizumab during the Randomized-Controlled Period 
had SAEs which led to discontinuation of study drug (includes the 2 patients in the ravulizumab group 
who had SAEs which led to discontinuation of study drug during the Randomized-Controlled Period as 
well as 2 patients in the ravulizumab group who died during ravulizumab treatment in the Open-Label 
Extension Period.  
None of the patients who received placebo during the Randomized-Controlled Period discontinued study 
drug after switching to ravulizumab during the Open-Label Extension Period. 
Post marketing experience 
The  estimated  postmarketing  exposure  to  ravulizumab  IV  since  the  first  Marketing  Authorization 
(21 Dec 2018) through 30 Jun 2021 was 3996.7 PY for PNH and aHUS indications. 
Meningococcal infection remains an important identified risk for ravulizumab IV based on the mechanism 
of  action,  findings  from  the  ravulizumab  clinical  studies,  and  long-term  experience  with  eculizumab 
(Soliris), another approved C5 complement inhibitor.  
Three patients with PNH reported meningococcal infection in the postmarketing setting of ravulizumab 
(2 patients with serotype non-typeable and 1 patient with unknown serotype) with a reporting rate of 
approximately  0.08  per  100  PY  [3 patients/3996.7  PY],  between  197  to  322 days  of  the  first  dose  of 
ravulizumab  IV.  Administration  of  a  meningococcal  vaccination  at  least  2 weeks  prior  to  the 
administration of ravulizumab IV was confirmed in all 3 patients. 
Long-term postmarketing experience  with  eculizumab  showed  consistent 
reporting 
rate  of 
meningococcal infections in eculizumab-treated patients over the past 10 years at approximately 0.3 to 
0.5 per  100 PY with  the  reporting  rate  for  fatal  outcomes  at  0.03 per  100 PY representing  9.2%  of 
patients  who  experienced  meningococcal  infections, similar  to the  proportion  of  fatal  events  in  the 
general  population  among  individuals  with  meningococcal  infections  (10%  to 15%)  (MacNeil,  201825; 
Van Deuren, 200026).  
Additionally, hypersensitivity reactions were confirmed as an identified risk based on a cumulative data 
review of the Standardised MedDRA Query (SMQ) hypersensitivity

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of ravulizumab in gMG has been evaluated in one Phase 3 study (Study ALXN1210 MG-306) 
which  includes  a  placebo-controlled  26-week  treatment  period  (completed)  and  a  2-year  open  label 
extension still ongoing. The primary analysis for Study 306 was conducted with a clinical cut-off date of 
11 May 2021. 
Overall, a total of 86 patients were exposed to ravulizumab in the Randomized-Controlled Period. 
These patients were treated with the proposed dosing regimen for a median duration of 25.6 weeks. 
Treatment compliance was 94.4% in the placebo group and 96.5% in the ravulizumab group.  
The demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the placebo and ravulizumab 
groups. 
Regarding the long-term safety profile, only 35 patients have been treated, for a period of 52 weeks. A 
such, the CHMP considered that the safety database presents limitations especially regarding less 
frequent or delayed events.  However, given the low prevalence of Myasthenia Gravis, patient 
exposure is considered acceptable for the short-term safety assessment of ravulizumab. 
The available safety information of ravulizumab in the already authorised indications (PNH, aHUS) can 
be  taken  as  supportive  taking  into  account  that  patients  have  been  treated  with  the  same  dosing 
regimen. Study ALXN1210-MG-306 is expected to be completed (last patient’s last visit) by 30 May 2023. 
The final clinical study report (CSR) will be available within 12 months from study completion (Q2 2024) 
and will be submitted once available.  
An updated analysis of Study ALXN1210-MG-306 was performed and submitted during this application 
(data cut-off date 09 Nov 2021) that includes data through Week 60 for 169 patients.  
The safety profile for ravulizumab was similar to that of placebo in adult patients with gMG during the 
26-week Randomized-Controlled Period. 
Most  patients  included in the  Randomized–Controlled  period  reported  AEs:  90.7%  in  the  ravulizumab 
group  vs.  86.5%  in  the  placebo  group.  Of  them,  33.7%  of  both  ravulizumab-  and  placebo-treated 
patients reported AEs considered as related to study drug.  
A total of 5 patients withdrew from study treatment due to AEs (3 on placebo, 2 on ravulizumab) during 
the  double-blind  period  in  Study  MG-306.  Three  of  them  (1  on  placebo,  2  on  ravulizumab)  were 
considered  as  serious.  Two  additional  patients  discontinued  the  treatment  due  to  SAEs  during  the 
extension period. 
During the Ravulizumab Treatment Period, 86.6% of patients experienced at least 1 AE. The percentage 
of  patients  reporting  AEs  was  35.1%  during  months  6  to  12  of  ravulizumab  treatment,  compared  to 
85.8% during months 0 to 6 of ravulizumab treatment. The majority of AEs were considered to be not 
related to study drug, 
During the Randomized-Controlled Period, headache, diarrhoea), and nausea were the most frequently 
reported AEs (≥ 10% of all patients).  
Regarding adverse events through week 60, the most frequently reported AEs (≥ 10% of all patients) 
were headache and diarrhoea. A total of 58 (34.3%) patients reported AEs assessed as related to study 
drug by the Investigator. There was no trend towards increase in the incidence of AEs with longer-term

exposure to ravulizumab and the safety profile has shown to remain consistent over time. The percentage 
of patients reporting AEs was 84.6%, 56.3%, and 30.7% during months 0 to 6, > 6 to 12, and > 12 to 
18 of ravulizumab treatment, respectively. No new safety signals have emerged with longer exposure to 
ravulizumab 
Injection-related reactions were reported in a similar rate by ravulizumab (32.6%) and placebo (31.5%). 
No relevant differences were observed between both groups. 
No new adverse events have been reported in this new population. Overall, the AE profile is consistent 
with that known for ravulizumab in other indications.  
The majority of the events were of mild or moderate severity. Severe events were reported by 16 of 
patients treated with ravulizumab (18.6%) vs. 14 (15.7%) of those on placebo.  
More  ravulizumab  -treated  patients  experienced  ≥1  SAE  (23.3%  ravulizumab  vs..  15.7%  placebo), 
although most of them were considered as not related to the study drug. The most frequently reported 
SAEs were those related with infections and Nervous System disorders.  
Life-threatening events were reported by 2 patients treated with ravulizumab (2.3%): arthritis bacterial 
(n = 1); and COVID-19 pneumonia (n = 1) vs. 1 (1.1%) of those on placebo: diabetic ketoacidosis (n = 
1).  
The incidence and nature of SAEs during the open-label period is similar to those reported during the 
double-blind period. The most frequently reported AEs were headache (16.6%), diarrhoea (13.6%), 
nausea (9.5%), back pain (9.5%), fatigue (9.5%), nasopharyngitis (8.9%), urinary tract infection 
(8.9%), arthralgia (8.9%), dizziness (8.3%), abdominal pain (5.3%) COVID-19 (5.3%) and upper 
respiratory tract infection (5.3%). No clear safety signals were identified. All AEs mentioned above 
were already reflected in the PI with the exception of COVID-19 and urinary tract infections. Regarding 
the urinary infections reported it was explained that the differences between groups were driven by 
one patient, that all patients reporting urinary infections had other predisposing risk factors and that 
the incidence did not increase with longer exposure to ravulizumab. 
Around 21% of patients reported at least a SAE. The most frequently reported were those related to 
infections (9.4%) and nervous system disorders (4.7%).  
A total of 7 deaths occurred in the study but none were related to study drug by the investigator.  
Only  meningococcal  infections  were  included  as  Adverse  events  of  special  interest.  No  events  were 
reported  during  the  analysed  period.  However,  after  the  52-week  data  cutoff  date,  1  patient  in  the 
placebo group who switched to ravulizumab during the Open-Label Extension Period had a non-fatal SAE 
of meningitis of unknown aetiology. The patient had received meningococcal vaccination prior to study 
entry.  The  event  was  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  ravulizumab  (compatible  with 
partially treated bacterial meningitis). No action was taken with ravulizumab in response to this event 
and the patient continued to receive ravulizumab in the study. 
Regarding the safety profile in special populations, subgroup analyses were performed by sex, race, age, 
geographic  location.  No  relevant  differences  were  detected  between  different  subgroups.  However, 
results for some of the subgroups should be interpreted with caution given the small number of patients. 
With  respect  to  drug-drug  interactions  no  specific  studies  were  conducted,  the  subgroup  analysis  by 
immunosuppressant therapy used at baseline did not show any relevant safety signal. 
No  clinically  significant  changes  in  the  laboratory  results,  vital  signs,  physical  examinations,  and 
electrocardiograms were observed.

The postmarketing global data by the data cut-off date of 30 Jun 2021 do not seem to show any new 
safety concern. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety database of ravulizumab in the approved indication is considered limited both in terms of the 
number  of  exposed  patients  and  the  duration  of  the  exposure.  However,  the  small  size  of  the  safety 
database is not unexpected considering the rarity of the condition.  
Given the low prevalence of Myasthenia Gravis, patient exposure is considered acceptable for the short-
term safety assessment of ravulizumab. 
As for the long-term safety profile the extension study is ongoing. 
Overall, the reported AE profile is consistent with that known for ravulizumab in other indications, with 
no unexpected findings. 
CHMP considered that the available safety data supports the use of ravulizumab in the approved 
indication. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC 
have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Ultomiris 300 mg/ 30 mL concentrate for solution for 
infusion (parent leaflet). The bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The approved indication for Ultomiris is: 
“Ultomiris is indicated as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with gMG 
who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.”

Myasthenia  gravis  (MG)  is  a  rare  complement-mediated  autoimmune  disease  characterised  by 
the production  of  autoantibodies  targeting  proteins  located  at  the  neuromuscular  junction.  The  most 
common target of autoantibodies in gMG is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). 
Patients with gMG present with muscle weakness that characteristically becomes more severe with 
repeated use and recovers with rest. Muscle weakness can be localised to specific muscles, but often 
progresses to more diffuse muscle weakness27,28,29. Generalised myasthenia gravis symptoms can 
become life-threatening when muscle weakness involves muscles that are responsible for breathing. 
The most dangerous complication of gMG, known as myasthenic crisis, requires hospitalisation, 
intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Approximately 15% to 20% of patients with gMG will 
experience a myasthenic crisis within 2 years of diagnosis30. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Most therapies for gMG focus on either augmenting the AChR signal or non-specifically suppressing the 
autoimmune  response.  First-line  therapy  for  symptomatic  gMG  is  treatment  with  acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE)  inhibitors  and  in  patients  who  remain  symptomatic,  corticosteroids  with  or  without  systemic 
immunosuppressants  are  used  off-label.  Immunosuppressants  used  frequently  in  gMG  include 
azathioprine  and  mycophenolate  mofetil.  Cyclosporine,  methotrexate,  tacrolimus,  cyclophosphamide, 
and  rituximab  are  also  used  occasionally.  Intravenous  immunoglobulin  (IVIG)  and  plasma  exchange 
(PLEX)  are  typically  used  short-term  to  manage  worsening  MG  symptoms  and  in  patients  with 
myasthenic  crisis  or  life-threatening  signs  such  as  respiratory  insufficiency  or  dysphagia 31 , 32 .  
Eculizumab,  a  monoclonal  antibody,  has  been  approved  for  the  treatment  of  refractory  generalized 
myasthenia gravis (gMG) in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Clinical evidence supporting the new indication is primarily based on the ongoing Study ALXN1210-MG-
306. Study ALXN1210 MG 306 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo controlled, 
26-week multicenter study with an ongoing open-label extension to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
ravulizumab  (n=86)  administered  by  IV  infusion  compared  to  placebo  (n=89)    in  adult  patients  with 
gMG. 
The study consists of an up to 4-week Screening Period, a 26 week double-blind, Randomized 
Controlled Period, and an Open-Label Extension Period of up to 2 years. Patients were treated on a 
body weight-based posology receiving a loading dose of 2400-3000 mg followed by maintenance doses 
of 3000 -3600 mg on Day 15 and then every 8 weeks (q8w). This dosing regimen is identical to that 
approved for the treatment of PHN and aHUS. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study MG-306 met its primary endpoint (change from Baseline in MG-ADL total score at Week 26 of the 
Randomized-Controlled Period). Patients treated with ravulizumab showed significantly better control of 
MG symptoms than those who received placebo on the subjective assessment by the patient (MG-ADL).

At Week 26 the mean difference between the treatment arms was -1.6 (95% CI -2.6, -0.7; p = 0.0009). 
This was supported by sensitivity analyses in the PP population as well as by supplemental analyses for 
the primary endpoint.   
The secondary endpoints, also assessed changes from baseline to Week 26, included the change in the 
Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) total score, the proportion of patients with improvements of at 
least 5 and 3 points in the QMG and MG-ADL total scores, respectively, as well as changes in quality-of-
life assessments. 
The quantitative evaluation of relevant muscle groups by the physician (QMG) measured as secondary 
endpoint  also  showed  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  ravulizumab  and  placebo.  The  LS 
mean (SEM) reduction from Baseline to Week 26 in QMG total score was -2.0 [0.59]; 95% CI: -3.2, -
0.8; p = 0.0009). 
A numerically greater effect was observed in the QoL MG scales (change in MG-QOL15r score, change in 
Neuro-QoL fatigue scale) favouring ravulizumab although according to testing hierarchy, they did not 
reach statistical significance. The LS mean (SEM) reduction from Baseline to Week 26 in MG-QoL15r total 
score was -1.7 [0.7]; 95% CI: -3.4, 0.1; p=0.0636. 
The LS mean (SEM) reduction from Baseline to Week 26 in Neuro-QoL Fatigue score was -2.2; 95% CI: 
-6.9, 2.6; p=0.3734. 
30% of patients on ravulizumab had ≥ 5 point reduction in the QMG total score compared with 11.3% 
placebo (OR 3.350 [95% CI 1.443, 7.777]; p=0.0052). 
In  addition,  more  patients  in  the  ravulizumab  group  (56.7%)  compared  to  placebo  group  (34.1%) 
achieved  a  ≥3-point  reduction,  although  this  analysis  was  not  considered  (formally)  statistically 
significant  according  to  the  prespecified  hierarchical  testing  for  secondary  endpoints.    MG  Composite 
Scale results are in line with those observed for MG-ADL score and QMG scales. Patients treated with 
both  ravulizumab  and  with  placebo  experienced  a  reduction  in  the  scores  (ravulizumab  -6.1  [0.73], 
placebo -3.2 [0.71]). The difference was statistically significant (-2.9 [0.93]; 95% CI: -4.8, -1.1; p = 
0.0019).   
Patients in the ravulizumab arm suffered fewer clinical deteriorations (10 [11.6%] vs. 18 [20.2%]) or 
rescue  therapy  (8  [9.3%]  vs.  14  [15.7%])  than  the  patients  in  the  placebo  arm  during  the  study. 
Similarly, fewer patients on ravulizumab needed hospitalization due to MG during the 26 week period of 
treatment compared to placebo (7 [8%] vs. 3 [3%]). 
Maintenance of the effect of ravulizumab beyond 6-month treatment is based on the still ongoing open 
label period, where all patients involved in Study MG-306 are treated with ravulizumab and followed up 
to 2 years.  An update of the Study MG-306 with a clinical database cut-off date of 09 Nov 2021 was 
provided during this application. Additional data from the 161 patients who received 1 or more doses 
of ravulizumab in the extension period collected up to the Week 60 visit in the Open-Label Extension 
Period have been provided.  All patients received treatment with ravulizumab during the Open-Label 
Extension Period, including patients randomized to ravulizumab and patients randomized to placebo 
during the Randomized-Controlled Period (RAV/RAV and PBO/RAV group, respectively). When patients 
who received placebo in the randomized controlled period were treated with ravulizumab in the open-
label extension period an improvement similar to that showed by patients on active treatment in the 
previous study was observed. In patients previously treated with ravulizumab, the response was 
maintained.  
During this phase of the clinical trial background therapy could be adjusted. In this period 50.3% of 
patients had a change in concomitant MG medication.  The most common change was a decrease in

corticosteroids for systemic use due to MG symptoms improved (20.7%) with 11 (6.5%) patients 
discontinuing corticosteroids for systemic use. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The magnitude of the effect regarding the primary endpoint was questioned by CHMP. CHMP 
considered that the statistically significant reduction experienced in symptoms of 1.6 points in the 
mean change in MG-ADL score (primary endpoint) with respect to baseline during the randomized 
controlled period was modest. This also applied to the observed findings in the main secondary 
endpoints, when they were expressed in terms of absolute changes of the respective scales. 
The clinical relevance of the treatment effect was questioned based on the fact that it did not achieve 
the accepted thresholds for clinical meaningfulness for the utilized scales established in literature (i.e. 
MCID of 2 point33,34).  
CHMP considered that these thresholds should be used for individual responder analyses and not as a 
reference point for a population-average drug-placebo treatment effect. Admittedly, this criterion could 
be considered as a cut-off value in responder analysis, as this is based on an “individual level” approach. 
In this respect 63.9% of patients treated with ravulizumab and 53.0% of patients treated with placebo 
showed  a  2-point  reduction  in  MG-ADL  score,  being  the  reported  10.9%  difference  of  difficult 
interpretation. Moreover, the measured difference between ravulizumab and placebo did not achieve the 
treatment effect of 1.9 points on the MG-ADL score used at the planning stage.  
An estimation of the effect size for the primary and secondary endpoints (MG-ADL and QMG scales) was 
provided in order to inform about the magnitude of treatment effects, showing an Hedge’s g effect size 
of -0.49 and -0.50, respectively, which is defined as a moderate effect.  
From the patient perspective (QoL measures), the changes MG-QOL15r score and in Neuro-QoL fatigue 
scale  were  not  statistically  significant  even  if  results  numerically  favoured  ravulizumab  compared  to 
placebo.  
As it was reflected also by the inclusion criteria on prior/concomitant medications, in the ravulizumab 
study 306, gMG patients of lower disease severity were also included. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the Randomized-Controlled Period headache, diarrhoea and nausea were the most frequently reported 
AEs (≥ 10% of all patients). Overall, the AE profile is consistent with that known for ravulizumab in other 
indications. 
More  ravulizumab  -treated  patients  experienced  ≥1  SAE  (23.3%  ravulizumab  vs.  15.7%  placebo), 
although most of them were considered as not related to the study drug. The most frequently reported 
SAEs were those related with infections (8.1% of patients treated with ravulizumab, 4.5% of patients 
treated with placebo); and Nervous System disorders (5.8% of patients treated with ravulizumab, 4.5% 
of patients treated with placebo). 
In the Ravulizumab Treated Set 88.8% of patients reported AEs (related AEs 34.3%). No additional 
safety issues were identified with prolonged and repeated administration of ravulizumab. As for the

long-term safety profile the most frequently reported AEs were headache (16.6%), diarrhoea (13.6%), 
nausea (9.5%), back pain (9.5%), fatigue (9.5%), nasopharyngitis (8.9%), urinary tract infection 
(8.9%), arthralgia (8.9%), dizziness (8.3%), abdominal pain (5.3%) COVID-19 (5.3%) and upper 
respiratory tract infection (5.3%).  
No meningococcal infections were reported during the analysed period. After the 52-week data cut-off 
date, 1 patient in the placebo group who switched to ravulizumab had a non-fatal SAE of meningitis of 
unknown aetiology during the Open-Label Extension Period. 
Seven  deaths  have  been  reported  in  the  total  ravulizumab  group.  None  of  the  fatal  events  were 
considered by the investigator to be related to ravulizumab treatment. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, a total of 86 patients were exposed to ravulizumab in the Randomized-Controlled Period. These 
patients were treated with the proposed dosing regimen for a median duration of 25.6 weeks. Treatment 
compliance was 94.4% in the placebo group and 96.5% in the ravulizumab group. A such, the CHMP 
considered that the safety database presents limitations especially regarding less frequent or delayed 
events.

Notes: Secondary efficacy endpoints were tested in a hierarchical approach (numbers included for testing order). Hierarchical testing 
proceeded  from  1 to  5,  and  if  statistical  significance  was  not  achieved  (p-value  >  0.05),  then  subsequent  endpoints  were  not 
considered statistically significant and all displayed p-values from analyses of lower hierarchy were to be considered nominal. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Generalized Myasthenia Gravis is associated with relevant disability due to muscle weakness and 
fatigue of fluctuating course especially in patients with at least moderate condition. Treatment is aimed 
to control the symptoms and the underlying immune dysregulation. With respect to the structurally 
related eculizumab (administered every 2 weeks) ravulizumab allows a reduction in the frequency of 
infusions. It represents a reduced treatment burden, which is of value for the patients usually requiring 
numerous other treatments in the context of a chronic disease.   
Overall, ravulizumab has shown an effect over placebo on the control of symptoms assessed by the 
patient (MG-ADL score, primary endpoint) and by the physician (QMG score; secondary endpoint) in a 
population with an established, advanced condition of moderate severity in spite of concomitant MG 
therapy. This is consistent with MGC score results, a scale derived from the other two scales. 
While the magnitude of a clinically relevant effect could be questioned, the totality of the evidence 
should be considered when concluding on the efficacy of ravulizumab. In this respect the observed 
treatment effects are consistent across the responder rates reported both from the patient’s (≥ 3-point 
reduction in MG-ADL total score) and physician’s perspective (≥ 5 point reduction in the QMG total

score). It should also be mentioned that more stringent criteria (i.e. greater point reduction 
thresholds) led to more clear differences between the ravulizumab and the placebo groups. 
Supportive evidence derives also from the clinical impact of ravulizumab in the course of the disease. 
Ravulizumab treated patients experienced less clinical deterioration, less MG-related hospitalization 
and required less rescue therapy than placebo treated patients. However, the interpretation of these 
outcomes is limited by the reduced numbers of events by group and the exploratory nature of the 
endpoints. However, a consistent response has been shown in the scales measured, which reinforces 
the observed effect.   During the extension period, where changes in background therapy were 
allowed, 50.3% of patients had a change in concomitant MG medication.  The most common change 
was a decrease in corticosteroids for systemic use due to MG symptoms improved (20.7%) with 11 
(6.5%) patients discontinuing corticosteroids for systemic use.  
Maintenance of the effect of ravulizumab beyond 6-month treatment is based on the still ongoing open 
label period, where all patients involved in Study MG-306 are treated with ravulizumab and followed up 
to 2 years.  With the limitations given by the open label design and the fact that the study is still 
ongoing, the maintenance of the effect is considered sufficiently established. The final results of the 
study will be submitted once available. 
The safety database of ravulizumab in the proposed indication is considered limited in terms of the 
number of exposed patients. The updated analysis of Study ALXN1210-MG-306 performed (data cut-
off date 09 Nov 2021) includes data from 169 patients through Week 60.  
The small size of the safety database is not unexpected considering the rarity of the condition. Overall, 
the reported AE profile is consistent with that known for ravulizumab in other indications. No additional 
safety issues were identified with prolonged and repeated administration of ravulizumab. 
The extension study is ongoing. The MAH should submit the final results when available in order to 
complete the long-term efficacy and safety assessment. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Ravulizumab has shown an effect over placebo on the control of symptoms assessed by the patient 
and by the physician. Whereas some uncertainties still remain (e.g. what treatment effect size with 
respect to placebo is to be considered clinically relevant) the totality of data submitted supports the 
conclusion that efficacy has been sufficiently demonstrated to support the use of ravuzilumab in the 
approved indication. 
Long-term efficacy is based on the effect of ravulizumab during the open label extension period of the 
study, still ongoing.  With the limitations given by the open label design and the fact that the study is 
still ongoing, the maintenance of the effect is considered sufficiently supported. 
The observed safety profile of ravulizumab per se does not raise any severe or unexpected concerns 
and it is consistent with that known for ravulizumab in other indications; it is noted, however, that the 
conclusions are based on a very limited safety database. 
As for the wording of the indication CHMP considered that taking into account that eculizumab and 
ravulizumab are structurally similar, do share the same mechanism of action and that the design of 
study ECU-MG-301, which supported approval  of eculizumab for the treatment of refractory 
generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) 
antibody-positive, was similar to that of the ravulizumab MG-306 study, the same indication wording 
as the one for Soliris could be considered adequate also for ravulizumab. However further justification 
was provided that demonstrated that there are several differences between the population included in

the eculizumab study (Study ECU-MG-301) and that included in the ravulizumab study (Study 
ALXN1210-MG-306). In general, patients included in eculizumab study seem to correspond to a more 
severe, more heavily treated population, in accordance to the requirement of having failed to at least 2 
previous treatments and the approved indication in a refractory population.  
Whereas the fact that ravulizumab and eculizumab share biochemical structure, mechanism of action 
and target population would favour granting a similar therapeutic indication, the differences in the 
population in whom the efficacy and safety data have been obtained would justify a different wording. 
This does not necessary mean that the effect of both medicinal products differs from each other but 
that the therapeutic indication is adjusted to the available evidence.  
Considering the above, granting a broader indication to ravulizumab seems justified. As such, the final 
approved indication for ravulizumab is:      
“Ultomiris is indicated as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with gMG 
who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.” 
Regarding the claim for an additional year of market protection submitted by the MAH, it is considered 
that Ultomiris in the claimed indication brings a significant clinical benefit over existing therapies based 
on an improved efficacy compared to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids and azathioprine, 
and a major contribution to patient care compared to Soliris (based on a reduced treatment burden 
with approximately 7 infusions for ravulizumab versus 26 infusions for eculizumab annually).

Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Ultomiris is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

corresponding sections in the Package Leaflet are updated accordingly. The RMP has been updated to 
version 4.0 to align with the indication extension. Lastly, the minor editorial corrections are made 
throughout the SmPc and package leaflet. The Applicant also requested 1 year of market protection for

a new indication (Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Ultomiris is similar to Soliris and not similar to Vygart 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. 
Derogation(s) from market exclusivity 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 
the following derogation laid down in Article 8.3 of the same Regulation apply: 
the holder of the marketing authorisation for Soliris has given his consent to the MAH. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
HIV-1 infection is a life threatening and serious disease of major public health significance, with 
approximately 35 million people infected worldwide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 8/159  
  
  
 
 
Standard of care for the treatment of HIV-1 infection uses combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) to 
suppress viral replication to below detectable limits, increase CD4 cell counts, and stop disease 
progression. For ART-naive HIV infected patients, current treatment guidelines suggest that initial 
therapy consist of two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs) and either a non-
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or an integrase 
strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI). Virologically suppressed, HIV infected patients may switch from their 
current regimen because of safety or tolerability concerns or for regimen simplification. All patient 
populations may benefit from once daily fixed dose combination (FDC) regimens as these have been 
shown to provide increased adherence and improved clinical and virologic outcomes. 
The success of ART means that morbidity and mortality in the HIV infected population is increasingly 
driven by non AIDS–associated comorbidities. Clinical attention has become more focused on the 
optimization of tolerability, long term safety, and adherence to potent ART regimens. There remains a 
significant medical need for new, effective therapies that take into consideration the non-HIV 
comorbidities, demographics of the aging HIV infected population, antiretroviral (ARV) resistance and 
regimen simplification. 
Chronic kidney disease is important, since observational studies have demonstrated a relationship 
between kidney disease and progression to AIDS and death. Moreover, HIV associated nephropathy 
present in up to 30% of patients and this is a common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
requiring dialysis. 
ART with proven efficacy and safety in the both elderly and young patients is important; limited data 
and treatment options are available in both populations. The elderly have increased risks for 
comorbidities, including those related to renal and bone. There are specific and complex challenges for 
the treatment of adolescents, who also represent the population that will require ART for the longest 
time. 
Tenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide analogue with limited oral bioavailability that inhibits HIV-1 reverse 
transcription. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), an oral prodrug of TFV, has improved bioavailability, 
and delivers high systemic exposures of TFV with favourable efficacy and safety data. TDF is a 
preferred NtRTI for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 
infection. 
While TDF is used broadly in the treatment of HIV-1 infection, an important identified risk with its use 
is nephrotoxicity, which is associated with increased creatinine in some patients, increased protein loss 
(particularly tubular), and occasional cases of proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT) (including Fanconi 
syndrome). These risks necessitate increased renal monitoring with use of TDF-containing products, 
placing burden on the patient and healthcare provider. Reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) have 
also been seen after the initiation of ART, with larger decreases in BMD observed with TDF than with 
other NRTIs. 
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an investigational oral prodrug of TFV. TAF is more stable in plasma 
than TDF, provides higher intracellular levels of the active phosphorylated metabolite tenofovir 
diphosphate (TFV-DP), and approximately 90% lower circulating levels of TFV relative to TDF. The 
distinct metabolism of TAF offers the potential for an improved safety profile compared with TDF.

iron oxide yellow (E172). 
The product is packaged in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a polypropylene continuous-
thread, child-resistant cap, lined with an induction activated aluminium foil liner containing 
30 film-coated tablets. Each bottle contains silica gel desiccant and polyester coil. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Elvitegravir 
The information on chemistry, manufacturing and control of elvitegravir active substance has been 
previously assessed through centralised procedure and approved in the EU as part of the marketing 
authorisation applications for Vitekta (EU/1/13/883/001-2) and Stribild (EU/1/13/830/001-2). 
The Module 3.2.S sections of the dossier for elvitegravir provided by the Applicant are identical to the 
3.2.S sections submitted and approved with the aforementioned marketing authorisations. 
General information 
The chemical name of elvitegravir is 6-(3-chloro-2-fluorobenzyl)-1-[(2S)-1-hydroxy-3-methylbutan-2-
yl]-7-methoxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid and has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 10/159  
  
  
 
 
 
Elvitegravir appears as a white to pale yellow crystalline non-hygroscopic powder, sparingly soluble in 
methanol and ethanol and practically insoluble in water and aqueous solutions at pH 2.0 to 8.3. Its pKa 
is 6.6 and the distribution coefficient Log D is 4.5 (at pH 6.8).  
Elvitegravir exhibits polymorphism and appears in three polymorphs. The most thermodynamically 
stable polymorphic form has been determined and the crystallisation process is designed to 
consistently deliver this form. It contains a single asymmetric centre at C-11. The absolute 
configuration was established by single crystal X-ray crystallography and has been determined to be of 
“S” configuration. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Elvitegravir is manufactured in six well-defined synthetic steps using commercially available starting 
materials. The active substance is obtained from three manufacturers. The route of synthesis has been 
described in sufficient detail and adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The 
specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have 
been presented. Information about the formation, presence, origin and fate of impurities during 
manufacture has been satisfactorily discussed. 
Representative batch analysis data provided for all three proposed manufacturing sites produced with 
the proposed synthetic route show that the active substance can be manufactured reproducibly. 
Specification 
The elvitegravir active substance specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual 
inspection), identification (IR, HPLC, UV), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), enantiomeric purity 
(chiral HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals 
(Ph. Eur.), polymorphic form (DSC-Ph. Eur.), and particle size (laser light scattering). 
Impurities, including genotoxic impurities, have been evaluated and qualified where necessary. The 
proposed limits are found to be acceptable from a safety point of view and therefore they are 
considered justified.  
A microbial limit test for the active substance is not required in accordance with ICH Q6A because the 
latter steps of the active substance manufacturing process conducted in aqueous organic solvent 
mixtures and are expected to limit microbial content. In addition, confirmatory testing demonstrated 
that elvitegravir is moderately to completely inhibitory to microbial growth. Furthermore, data 
presented in the dossier indicate that no significant bioburden is present.  
The analytical methods have been well described and validated according to ICH Q2 (R1) and are 
suitable to control the quality of the active substance. 
Batch analysis data on commercial scale batches of the active substance manufactured by all three 
proposed manufacturers have been provided. The results comply with the specifications and confirm 
consistency and uniformity of the manufacturing process regardless of the manufacturing site. 
Stability 
Stability studies have been conducted for four commercial scale batches from the first manufacturer  
and one batch from the second under ICH long term (25 °C±2 °C/60±5% RH) and accelerated 
conditions (40 °C±2 °C / 75%±5% RH) in the proposed packaging. Results were submitted for up 36 
months at long term conditions and for up to 9 months at accelerated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 11/159  
  
  
 
 
Long term and accelerated stability samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurity content, and 
water content. The enantiomeric purity and polymorphic form were tested annually during the long 
term studies. Enantiomeric purity was determined for 1 batch, at the beginning and end of the 
accelerated study and polymorphic form was tested at the end of the accelerated study. The analytical 
methods used are stability indicating. 
All parameters remained within the specification limits under both conditions over the duration of study 
for all four batches. The data show no discernible trends for assay, total impurity content, individual 
specified impurities, degradation products or any other tested parameter. 
In addition, a photostability study of elvitegravir has been assessed as per the ICH Q1B Guideline on 
one batch from the second manufacturer. No significant difference was observed between the control 
sample and exposed sample in appearance, assay, impurity content, polymorphic form and 
enantiomeric purity. The data indicate that elvitegravir is not sensitive to light.  
Based on the presented stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage when the active 
substance is packed in the proposed packaging materials is acceptable. 
Cobicistat 
The information on chemistry, manufacturing and control of cobicistat active substance has been 
previously assessed through centralised procedure and approved in the EU as part of the marketing 
authorisation applications for Tybost (EU/1/13/872/001-2) and Stribild (EU/1/13/830/001 2). 
The Module 3.2.S sections of the dossier for cobicistat provided by the Applicant are identical to the 
3.2.S sections submitted and approved with the aforementioned marketing authorisations. 
General information 
The chemical name of cobicistat is 1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl [(2R,5R)-5-{[(2S)-2-[(methyl{[2-(propan-2-
yl)-1,3-thiazol-4-yl] methyl}carbamoyl)amino]-4-(morpholin-4-yl)butanoyl]amino}-1,6-
diphenylhexan-2-yl]carbamate and has the following structure: 
Cobicistat is an amorphous solid with a low glass transition temperature of 35 ºC. Because of the low 
glass transition temperature, cobicistat under ambient conditions undergoes moisture and temperature 
induced phase transition from a foam into a rubber-like material. To increase physical stability of 
cobicistat it is adsorbed on silicon dioxide. Cobicistat on silicon dioxide is a white to pale yellow 
amorphous powder and as cobicistat is also hygroscopic as determined by dynamic vapour sorption at 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 12/159  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
room temperature. The relatively higher water uptake of cobicistat on silicon dioxide compared to 
cobicistat is due to the hygroscopic nature of the silicon dioxide carrier. Importantly however and 
contrary to cobicistat itself, moisture uptake of cobicistat on silicon dioxide is reversible and therefore 
cobicistat is isolated by adsorption on silicon dioxide to provide a stable solid form, which is suitable for 
further finished product manufacture. 
It shows three pKa; 1.8 (thiazole group), 2.5 (alkylthiazole group) and 6.4 (morpholino group). The 
partition coefficient Log P is 4.3 (at pH 8.5 buffer). No crystal forms have been found. It has three 
chiral centres and is produced as a single isomer. The stereochemical configuration is defined through 
the synthetic process and the use of starting material with suitable chirality. Appropriate specifications 
for these starting materials ensure consistent quality during manufacture of cobicistat. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Three sites are proposed for the manufacture of the active substance. Cobicistat on silicon dioxide is 
manufactured in four well-defined synthetic steps. Details about possible reprocessing have been 
provided. The route of synthesis has been described in sufficient detail and adequate in-process 
controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate 
products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Because the actual loading value of 
cobicistat on silicon dioxide is subject to manufacturing variability, a target loading with an appropriate 
range was adopted to ensure a robust down-stream manufacturing process. 
All three sites have manufactured commercial scale batches of cobicistat on silicon dioxide and many 
smaller scale batches during the development of the product. Batch analysis data show that the active 
substance produced by both manufacturers is of similar quality and can be manufactured reproducibly. 
Specification 
Cobicistat on silicon dioxide specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification 
(cobicistat: IR, HPLC, UV; silicon dioxide: USP/NF), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), 
enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and heavy metals (Ph. 
Eur.).  
No crystal forms have been identified and since the active substance is produced as an amorphous 
solid adsorbed onto silicon dioxide, a test for polymorphism is not required as per ICH Q6A. 
Cobicistat genotoxic potential has been evaluated in accordance with the recommendations in ICH 
Q3A. All the identified impurities are of low concern for genotoxicity, and therefore no further 
qualification studies were considered necessary. The proposed test and limits are acceptable.  
A microbial limit test for the active substance is not required in accordance with ICH Q6A because the 
latter steps of the active substance manufacturing process are non-aqueous and been shown to limit 
microbial content. In addition data presented on several batches during development indicate no 
significant bioburden is present.  
All in-house analytical methods have been validated according to ICH Q2A principles. 
Batch analysis data on commercial scale batches of the active substance manufactured by all three 
proposed manufacturers have been provided. The results comply with the specifications and confirm 
consistency and uniformity of the manufacturing process regardless of the manufacturing site.

Stability 
Two pilot scale and one production scale batch from the first manufacturer and on one full scale batch 
from the second manufacturer packaged in the proposed container were put on stability testing in 
accordance with the ICH Q1A (R2) Guideline under long-term conditions at 5 °C for up to 36 months 
and accelerated at 25 °C/60% RH for up to 36 months. Appearance, water content, assay, impurities 
and chiral purity have been monitored. The analytical methods used are stability indicating. All 
physicochemical attributes of cobicistat on silicon dioxide remained within the specification acceptance 
limits following 36 months of long-term storage at 5 °C and no apparent trend has been observed. A 
statistical analysis performed for assay, total impurities and the major chiral impurity also demonstrate 
that there is little change over time. The physicochemical attributes of cobicistat on silicon dioxide 
remained also within the specification acceptance limits following 36 months of storage at 25 °C/60% 
RH. 
Furthermore, two of the above batches were also tested under 30 °C/75% RH for up to 12 months to 
evaluate the stability of cobicistat on silicon dioxide at elevated temperatures that may be encountered 
during shipping and handling. The duration of temperature and humidity excursions is limited to 3 
months. 
In addition, a photostability study was conducted on cobicistat on silicon dioxide according to ICH Q1B 
Guideline. The results showed no significant change in appearance, assay, and impurity content 
following exposure to light. The data indicate that cobicistat on silicon dioxide is not sensitive to light.  
Based on the presented stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage when the active 
substance is packed in the proposed packaging materials is acceptable. 
Emtricitabine 
The information on chemistry, manufacturing and control of emtricitabine active substance has been 
previously assessed through centralised procedure and approved in the EU as part of the marketing 
authorisation applications for Emtriva (EU/1/03/261/001-3), Truvada (EU/1/04/305/001-2), Atripla 
(EU/1/07/430/001-2), Eviplera (EU/1/11/737/001-2) and Stribild (EU/1/13/830/001-2). 
The Module 3.2.S sections of the dossier for emtricitabine provided by the Applicant are identical to the 
3.2.S sections submitted and approved with the aforementioned marketing authorisations. 
General information 
The chemical name of emtricitabine is 4-amino-5-fluoro-1-[(2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-
5-yl]-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one and has the following structure: 
Emtricitabine appears as a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder, freely soluble in 
methanol and water. Its pKa is 2.65 and the partition coefficient Log P is -0.43. It has 2 chiral centres 
at carbons 2 and 5 of the oxathiolane ring. Two enantiomeric pairs of diastereomers can exist; cis-(-)-
FTC and cis-(+)-FTC, trans-(-)-FTC and trans-(+)-FTC. The synthetic route has been chosen to be 
stereoselective for the formation of the desired cis-(-) enantiomer, emtricitabine. Three polymorphs of

emtricitabine have been observed. However, the most stable thermodynamically form at room 
temperature, is consistently produced. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Emtricitabine is manufactured by two possible synthetic routes sharing a common first step and 
followed by two options comprising either one or two extra steps. The synthesis was described in 
sufficient detail. The synthetic process results in the stereoselective formation of an intermediate and 
thus the formation of the desired emtricitabine enantiomer. Five manufacturing sites are involved. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The process has been 
shown to consistently produce emtricitabine that meets the required quality standards. 
Specification 
Emtricitabine specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification (IR, HPLC), 
clarity of solution (visual), water content (Ph. Eur.), enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), and 
particle size (Laser Light Scattering). Analytical methods have been validated in accordance with ICH 
guidelines. The testing and the proposed limits applied, conform to current ICH guidelines and are 
acceptable from a toxicological and clinical perspective. 
Extended testing during development has demonstrated that only a single polymorphic form results 
from the synthetic process of emtricitabine. Therefore as per ICH Q6A, testing for polymorphic form at 
release is not necessary. Development data demonstrate the absence of indicator organisms and 
therefore as per ICH Q6 indicate that microbial testing of the active substance is not required. 
Batch analysis data on 22 commercial scale batches of the active substance from all proposed 
manufacturers were provided. The results comply with the specifications and confirm consistency and 
uniformity of the manufacturing process. 
Stability 
Thirteen commercial scale and additional pilot scale batches of emtricitabine manufactured using both 
synthetic routes and packaged in the proposed container were put on stability testing in accordance 
with the ICH Q1A (R2) Guideline under long-term conditions at 25 ºC/60% RH for up to 36 months. Of 
the above batches, eight commercial scale and five pilot batches were put under accelerated at 40 
ºC/75% RH for up to 6 months. In addition another three batches were put under intermediate 30 
ºC/65% RH conditions for up to 12 months. Samples are tested for appearance, impurities and 
degradation products, assay, water content and for enantiomeric purity by validated stability indicating 
methods. Stability data for emtricitabine manufactured by both synthetic routes were comparable. All 
tested parameters remained within the specification limits throughout the tested period for all three 
stability conditions. In one isolated batch one degradation product exceeded the specification limit at 
the last time point (36 months). The same degradation product, is observed in emtricitabine stored at 
accelerated storage. Four batches exceeded the specification limit at 6 months. These data indicate 
that emtricitabine should not be exposed to elevated temperatures for extended periods of time but 
poses no quality issue for the active substance.  
A photostability study was conducted on one batch of emtricitabine. The results showed no significant 
changes in appearance, purity, and impurity content and indicate that emtricitabine is not sensitive to 
light.

Based on the long-term stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage when the active 
substance is packed in the proposed packaging materials is considered acceptable. 
Tenofovir alafenamide 
General information 
The chemical name of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is propan-2-yl N-[(S)-({[(2R)-1-(6-amino-9H-
purin-9-yl)propan-2-yl]-oxy}methyl)(phenoxy)phosphoryl]-L-alaninate, (2E)-but-2-enedioate (2:1) 
and has the following structure: 
The chemical structure of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate has been adequately demonstrated by 
infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H, 13C, and 31P), mass 
spectrometry, elemental analysis, ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. 
The active substance is a white to off-white or tan, slightly hygroscopic powder. Tenofovir alafenamide 
fumarate is a BCS Class 3 compound, with high aqueous solubility throughout the physiological pH 
range. The solubility of the active substance in aqueous media slightly decreases with increasing pH 
values. It is soluble at low pH (pH 2.0), sparingly soluble at pH 3.8, and slightly soluble at pH values 
up to 8.0. Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is freely soluble in methanol, soluble in ethanol, sparingly 
soluble in isopropanol and slightly soluble in acetone. 
Tenofovir alafenamide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of three chiral centres. The chiral 
centre at the propyloxy side chain is in the R-configuration. The absolute stereoconfiguration of the 
carbonylethylamino substituent is derived from the amino acid L-alanine, which has the S-configuration 
at the alpha-carbon. The remaining stereocentre is located at the phosphorus atom and is in the Sp 
configuration. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. 
Polymorphism has been observed for tenofovir alafenamide fumarate. A single polymorphic form is 
consistently generated through the manufacturing process and this form has been adequately 
characterized. 
The applicant has provided justification for TAF to be considered as a NAS on the basis of its unique 
chemical structure. However, both TAF and TDF which is a known active substance are prodrugs being 
metabolised to the same major active metabolite (TFV) in vivo. Therefore, both active substances 
share the same therapeutic moiety and as such, TAF is not considered a NAS on quality grounds. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is obtained from two manufacturers using the same synthetic route. 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 16/159  
  
  
 
 
 
The active substance is synthesized in multiple steps. During the evaluation procedure, the active 
substance starting materials were redefined to be in line with ICH Q11. Commercially available well-
defined starting materials with acceptable specifications are used. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Critical process 
parameters were identified using a risk assessment approach.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have 
been justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is 
considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance packaging is in compliance with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as 
amended.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual examination), identity (IR, 
HPLC), identity of fumaric acid (HPLC), clarity of solution (visual examination), water content (Ph. 
Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC, HPLC-MS, GC), residual solvents (GC), elemental impurities 
(ICP MS), and melting point (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data (n=16 using the proposed commercial process; 13 of which were commercial scale 
and 3 pilot scale) of the active substance, manufactured at both proposed manufacturing sites are 
provided. Additional batch analysis data for development batches used in pre-clinical pharmacokinetics 
and toxicological studies are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from 
batch to batch. 
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA).  
Stability 
Stability data on 6 commercial scale batches of active substance from the both proposed 
manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term 
conditions at 5 ºC and for up to 24 months under accelerated conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was 
performed on one batch. Results on stress conditions for up to 6 months at 40 ºC / 75% RH on 5 
batches were provided. Additionally, results for 4 days at 60 ºC / ambient RH; for 4 days at 50 ºC / 
ambient RH; and for 4 days at -20 ºC were also provided on one batch. 
The parameters tested are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015

Degradation products increased under accelerated conditions but remained within the specification. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch, indication that the 
active substance is not photosensitive. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the both proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period at the recommended long 
term storage conditions in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The proposed commercial finished product formulation is a green, capsule shaped, film-coated tablet 
with the dimensions of 19 mm x 8.5 mm, debossed with “GSI” on one side of the tablet and “510” on 
the other side of the tablet, containing 150 mg of elvitegravir, 150 mg of cobicistat, 200 mg of 
emtricitabine, and 10 mg of tenofovir alafenamide (as fumarate) as active substances. 
The overall goal of Genvoya film coated tablet development was to create a tablet containing the same 
amounts of elvitegravir, cobicistat and emtricitabine active substances as currently combined in Stribild 
fixed dose combination film-coated tablet and to replace tenofovir disoproxil contained in Stribild with 
tenofovir alafenamide, a second-generation prodrug of tenofovir. The commercial formulation 
accommodates the required formulation and manufacturing process changes to incorporate tenofovir 
alafenamide fumarate (TAF fumarate) at a much lower dose than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 
while maintaining the established doses and biopharmaceutical performance of the other active 
substances, as well as ensuring satisfactory TAF fumarate chemical stability and content uniformity. 
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to develop a stable immediate release solid dosage form 
for oral use, providing high bioavailability of the four active substances. The critical quality attributes 
(CQA) of the finished product are: size and colour, strength, content uniformity, % dissolved, 
degradation product content, water content, and microbiological quality. 
Elvitegravir (EVG) and cobicistat (COBI) are BCS Class 2 compounds with low aqueous solubility and 
high permeability, and emtricitabine (FTC) is a BCS Class 1 compound with high aqueous solubility and 
high permeability. TAF fumarate is a BCS Class 3 compound with high aqueous solubility and low 
permeability. Co-formulation of EVG, COBI on silicon dioxide, FTC and TAF fumarate was enabled by 
the choice of the solid oral tablet as a dosage form and avoiding physical and chemical interactions 
between the four active substances. This was achieved through selection of appropriate intra- and 
extragranular excipients in amounts that achieve: chemical and physical stability, rapid and complete 
dissolution, consistent pharmacokinetic performance, satisfactory powder properties to ensure 
acceptable tablet content uniformity, and adequate tablet tensile strength to ensure physical tablet 
integrity. 
Formulation composition, manufacturing process design and selection of excipients were intended to 
ensure content uniformity of all active substances within specifications.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards, except the coating material which is commercially available and tested according to an in 
house standard. All the components of the coating material comply with the standards in EU Regulation 
231/2012 or compendial monographs. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this 
report. 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 18/159  
  
  
 
 
The physical and chemical compatibility between EVG, COBI, FTC, and excipients have been 
established previously for Stribild film-coated tablets. The compatibility between TAF fumarate and the 
other ingredients was established with stability studies. 
The formulations used during clinical studies following the definition of the desired tablet composition 
and TAF fumarate strength were differing only in the type of non-functional coating material used and 
therefore no bioequivalence study comparing early development formulations to the one proposed for 
marketing was required. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method for routine release and stability testing of the 
finished medicinal product has been demonstrated. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. 
The manufacturing development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design of 
experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. The risk 
identification was based on the prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and 
manufacturing processes as well as on the experience from formulation development and process 
design. The critical process parameters have been adequately identified. 
The primary packaging is high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a polypropylene continuous-
thread, child-resistant cap, lined with an induction activated aluminium foil liner. Each bottle contains 
silica gel desiccant and polyester coil. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of multiple main steps: blending of the active substance with 
intragranular/extragranular excipients, fluid-bed granulation/dry granulation and milling, compression, 
tablet film-coating and packaging. Critical process parameters have been identified. The process is 
considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. The complete 
process will be validated at commercial scale prior to commercialisation; which was considered 
acceptable based on the enhanced development results presented and on experience gained in several 
commercial scale batches already manufactured. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The 
in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Proven acceptable ranges have been defined for several steps. The available development data, the 
proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the 
proposed PARs. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance (visual examination), identification (HPLC, UPLC, UV), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(UPLC), degradation products (UPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), dissolution (UPLC), and 
microbiological examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 19/159  
  
  
 
 
Batch analysis results are provided for 16 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Additional 
batch results of 3 commercial scale batches used in clinical studies were provided as supporting data. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 7 commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 
up to 24 months at both 25 ºC / 60% RH and 30 ºC / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Results on 
stress conditions for up to 4 days at 60 ºC / ambient RH; at 50 ºC / ambient RH; and at -20 ºC were 
also provided on one batch. The batches of medicinal product are representative to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. 
It was demonstrated that stability data of the finished product manufactured using active ingredients 
from different suppliers is representative and there are no differences in stability. 
Samples were tested for the same parameters as for release. The analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and were stability indicating. The specification acceptance limits were met for all 
quality attributes at long-term storage conditions. It was shown that the finished product is not 
photosensitive; however it should be stored in the original packaging in order to protect it from 
moisture. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 24 months and storage conditions as stated in the 
SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished 
product and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the 
manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
N/A 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Elvitegravir (EVG) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) that is licensed in the EU to be co-
administered with a ritonavir (RTV)-boosted protease inhibitor and with other antiretroviral (ARV) 
agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults.  Elvitegravir prevents integration of the HIV-1 
genetic material into the host-cell genome. 
Cobicistat (COBI) is a strong mechanism-based cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor (a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer) that increases the systemic levels of co-administered agents metabolised 
by CYP3A enzymes, including EVG and the HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) atazanavir (ATV) and 
darunavir (DRV).   
Emtricitabine (FTC) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), and intracellularly it is 
phosphorylated to the active metabolite, emtricitabine triphosphate which has activity against HIV and 
hepatitis B virus.   
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a prodrug of tenofovir (TFV), and after absorption TAF is converted to 
TFV intracellularly, which is phosphorylated to the active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), 
that competes with natural 2’-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) for incorporation by the HIV-1 or 
HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) and, once incorporated, results in chain-termination.  TAF differs from 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) as it is more stable in human plasma than TDF despite rapidly 
undergoing intracellular conversion to TFV.  Treatment with TAF results in higher levels of TFV-DP in 
PBMCs and 90% lower circulating levels of TFV relative to TDF. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Summary 
Pharmacology programmes have been completed for each of the four components of E/C/F/TAF, 
comprising of primary pharmacology, secondary pharmacology and safety pharmacology studies.  
A small number of pharmacology studies have been completed with combinations of EVG and COBI, 
FTC and TDF, and EVG/COBI/FTC/TFV.  No additional pharmacology studies have been conducted for 
the E/C/F/TAF combination.  The proposed FDC is based on the complimentary pharmacological 
mechanisms of action of EVG, FTC, and TAF and clinical evidence is presented to support the use of 
nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs) and INSTIs in HIV-infected patients.  In

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
EVG: 
Elvitegravir (EVG) has been shown to inhibit viral replication in a number of laboratory strains and 
isolates of HIV-1.  EC50 values vary dependent on the cell line in question, but EVG has been shown to 
be effective against wild type HIV-1 in T-cell lines (EC50= 0.38 nM), EC50 is 0.35 nM against HIV-1 
macrophage-tropic virus in monocyte/macrophage cells, and 0.62 nM against clinical HIV-1 isolates in 
PBMCs.  Activity of EVG has been shown against HIV-2.  A calculated EC95 is 1.25 nM (0.56 ng/mL) in 
the absence of human serum (HS) components and 100 nM (44.8 ng/mL) in the presence of the HS 
components HSA and AAG in human PBMC cultures infected with HIV-1. 
No in vivo animal studies have been conducted with EVG and evidence of pharmacodynamics has been 
obtained from clinical study.

COBI: 
The primary pharmacological effect of cobicistat is to act as a potent inhibitor of human CYP3A.  CYP3A 
inhibition studies, using an established clinical CYP3A inhibitor, ritonavir (RTV), as a comparator, were 
performed to test the specificity of CYP3A inhibition, mechanism of inhibition, and to determine the 
enzyme inactivation parameters of COBI.   
The potency of COBI as an inhibitor of CYP3A was compared with RTV by using markers of activity for 
CYP3A enzymes (midazolam [MDZ] 1’-hydroxylase, testosterone 6β-hydroxylase, and terfenadine 
hydroxylase.  Formation of the oxidative metabolite (M1) of EVG was measured as this indicated the 
extent of CYP3A enzyme activity.  In addition, the effects of COBI and RTV on the human hepatic 
microsomal metabolism of atazanavir (ATV) and telaprevir (VX-950), were determined by monitoring 
the loss of the parent molecule. 
COBI has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of human CYP3A enzymes, demonstrating similar 
activity against both MDZ 1’-hydroxylase and testosterone 6β-hydroxylase as RTV (Study No. AD-216-
2028).  In addition Cobicistat was found to be an efficient inactivator of human hepatic microsomal 
CYP3A activity, with kinetic parameters (kinact = 0.47 min-1, KI = 1.1 μM) similar to those of RTV 
(kinact = 0.23 min-1, KI = 0.26 µM.  Clinical activity of COBI has been further established in human 
pharmacodynamic studies.  
FTC: 
Emtricitabine (FTC) is a synthetic analogue of the naturally occurring pyrimidine nucleoside, 2′-
deoxycytidine.  Intracellularly, FTC is converted through 3 phosphorylation reactions to its active tri-
phosphorylated anabolite FTC-TP.   
Emtricitabine triphosphate inhibits viral polymerases by direct binding competition with the natural 
deoxyribonucleotide substrate (deoxycytidine triphosphate; dCTP), and after incorporation into DNA, 
by DNA chain termination.  Published literature describes that the EC50 of FTC against laboratory 
adapted strains of HIV-1 ranged from 0.001 to 0.62 µM depending on cell type and virus strain used in 
the assay.  With clinical isolates of HIV-1, EC50 values ranged from 0.002 to 0.028 µM.   
In vivo animal studies have been completed with FTC or FTC in combination to demonstrate its activity 
against immune deficiency in the macaque monkey.  Macaques were infected with the simian 
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and 50 days post inoculation animals were treated subcutaneously with 
either TFV (20 mg/kg) and FTC (50 mg/kg) or were not given any drugs.  The treated macaques 
achieved SIV levels that were below the limit of detection (ie, < 100 copies/mL of viral RNA), whereas 
only 1 of the non-treated macaques showed a decrease in SIV RNA.  SIV levels remained low in all 
treated animals for up to 6 months.   
In another study, monkeys were exposed to 14 weekly doses of SHIV (SIV/HIV chimeric virus).  
Rhesus macaques were injected subcutaneously with TFV/FTC daily, at 2 hours before and 24 hours 
after the first virus exposure or at 2 hours before first virus exposure only.  Twenty of the 21 control 
animals became infected, however all 6 of animals treated with TFV/FTC daily or before and 24 hours 
after the first challenge were fully protected after 14 challenges.  In the single-dose group, 1 of 6 
animals was infected, confirming that multiple dose therapy was highly effective at protecting these 
animals against rectal transmission of HIV.

TAF: 
Tenofovir alafenamide is hydrolysed to tenofovir (TFV) by the lysosomal carboxypeptidase, Cathepsin A 
(CatA).  To investigate the intracellular activity of TAF in lymphoid cells and tissues, CD4+ T 
lymphocytes and monocyte-derived macrophage (MDMs) were isolated from PBMCs from viable donors 
(Study No. PC-120-2017) and extent of CatA activity determined by measuring the rate of conversion 
of TAF to TFV-alanine.  Level of active CatA was similar across all donors, as was the rate of conversion 
from TAF to TFV-alanine in CD4+ cells.  Cathepsin A activity was approximately 2-fold greater in MDMs 
compared with CD4+ T cells.  There was conversion of TAF to TFV-DP across both cell types in all donor 
extracts (Figure 2).   
As shown in Figure 1, TAF is hydrolysed to TFV, and is then metabolised to the active metabolite, TFV-
DP, which is an inhibitor of HIV-1, HIV-2 and HBV polymerases, and is an inhibitor of HIV-1 RT that 
competes with deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) for incorporation into nascent DNA and terminates 
the elongation of the viral DNA chain during the process of retroviral reverse transcription, thereby 
effectively blocking the replication and spread of infectious HIV.   
In vitro studies have shown that TAF has effective anti-HIV activity in lymphoid T-cells, primary human 
PBMCs, and macrophages with EC50 values ranging from 3 to 14 nM.  The in vitro activity of TAF 
against HIV-1 is 100- to 600-fold greater than TFV and 4- to 6-fold greater than TDF (Robbins et al. 
1998).   
In MT-2 cells, TAF shows low cytotoxicity with a selectivity index (SI) of > 10,000).  Based on data 
generated with the parent nucleotide TFV, TAF is expected to be active against a wide range of HIV-1 
subtypes and also against HIV-2.  In addition, TAF is a potent inhibitor of HBV replication, exhibiting in 
vitro activity comparable to that of TDF with an EC50 value of 18 nM.

TAF = tenofovir alafenamide; TFV = tenofovir; TFV-MP = tenofovir monophosphate; TFV-DP = tenofovir disphosphate Following incubation for 4 hours 
with 1μM TAF, the formation and quantity of intracellular TAF metabolites in CD4+ T cells (A) and MDMs (B) were determined by HPLC combined with 
mass spectrometry. 
Further work evaluated the interaction potential of TAF with other CatA inhibitors such as HIV protease 
inhibitors (PIs) (Study No. PC-120-2001).  The HIV PIs DRV, ATV, lopinavir (LPV), and RTV, as well as 
the pharmacoenhancing agent COBI, did not inhibit CatA-mediated hydrolysis of TAF up to a 
concentration of 50 μM, well above the clinical Cmax of each drug.  In a similar manner the potential for 
interaction with HCV PIs - TMC-435, BI-201355, MK-5172, GS-9256, and GS-9451 showed little-to-no 
inhibition of CatA, with IC50 values ranging from 25 to > 50 μM.  2 irreversible inhibitors of the HCV 
protease, telaprevir and boceprevir, were identified as potent inhibitors of CatA-mediated hydrolysis of 
TAF, with IC50 values of 0.3 and 0.2 μM, respectively.  When adjusted for plasma binding, these IC50 
values are 6- to 8-fold below the clinical maximum concentration (Cmax) levels observed in patients. 
No primary PD studies in animals were conducted; however studies were completed with the active 
component of TAF, TFV.  Monkeys received a single dose of 30 mg/kg radiolabelled TFV 
subcutaneously, and the extent of TFV in plasma and levels of intracellular TFV and TFV metabolite 
concentrations were determined.  The TFV concentration in plasma reached a maximum of 
approximately 50 µM and declined with a t1/2 of 5 to 7 hours.  As was seen in the in vitro studies, TFV 
is efficiently taken up by PBMCs and is metabolised to TFV-DP, with the intracellular concentrations of 
the active metabolite TFV-DP reaching 0.9 µM. 
E/C/F/TAF: 
The anti-HIV-1 activity of TAF in combination with a broad panel of representatives from the major 
classes of approved anti-HIV agents (NtRTIs, NNRTIs, INSTIs, and PIs) was evaluated in HIV-1IIIB 
infected MT-2 cells.   
The combination of TAF with TFV resulted in an additive effect as both will deliver TFV-DP to cells.   
TAF exhibited moderate to high synergistic effects when combined with any of the NtRTIs or NNRTIs 
(Table 1).  The combination of TAF with INSTIs resulted in a high level of synergy.  The combination of 
TAF with PIs resulted in moderate synergy.  Finally combining TAF with COBI, a PK enhancer co-
formulated with TAF in E/C/F/TAF FDC and with no antiviral activity, resulted in an overall additive 
effect.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The ability EVG, COBI, FTC or TAF (TFV) to affect anti-viral activity of other antiretrovirals has been 
explored in some detail, reviewing their in vitro cytotoxicity, mitochondrial toxicity, off target activity 
and potential metabolic toxicities.   
EVG: 
The cytotoxicity of EVG was evaluated in a number of human cell lines and primary cells.  EVG showed 
weak cytotoxicity in primary PBMCs (drug concentration that results in a 50% reduction in cell viability 
[CC50] > 100 μM) (Study No. JTK303-PH-010, non-GLP), primary T-lymphocytes (CC50 40 μM), 
primary monocytes/macrophages (CC50 >500 μM), and macrophages (CC50 26 μM) (Study No. PC-
186-2004, non-GLP).  
Using a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, EVG cytotoxicity was observed in a dose-dependent 
manner after 7 days of culture with PBMCs, with a CC50 value of 9.7 µM (SI of > 48,000) in the 
absence of HS and 170 µM in the presence of 50% human serum (SI of > 100,000; Study No. JTK303-
PH-006, non-GLP)).  No difference in the cytotoxicity of EVG was detected in unstimulated versus 
stimulated PBMCs in the absence of human serum (mean CC50 values of 10.8 and 16.6 µM, 
respectively; Study No. PC-183-2001, non-GLP). 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 27/159  
  
  
 
 
 
A variety of clinical symptoms observed in patients with HIV treated with prolonged NRTI therapy may 
be linked to mitochondrial toxicity.  As a result EVG was tested in vitro for its effect on mitochondrial 
DNA levels in HepG2 liver cells.  EVG produced no measurable changes in mitochondrial DNA levels at 
a dose of 10 µM (Study No. TX-183-2009, non-GLP).   
Elvitegravir showed no significant inhibition of or increased binding to a series of 22 receptors, 7 
enzymes, and 3 cell-based assay systems, including the immune cell functions of cell adhesion (ICAM-
1/VCAM-1 mediated), interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion, and mixed lymphocyte reaction (splenic 
lymphocytes; Study No. JTK303-PH-008, non-GLP).   
In addition EVG did not inhibit the activity of human topoisomerase I and II enzymes at concentrations 
up to 50 and 150 µM, respectively (Study No. JTK303-PH-004). 
COBI: 
Cobicistat in vitro cytotoxicity has been evaluated in MT-2 lymphoblastoid T-cells following 5-day 
incubation and in HepG2 hepatoma cells following 3-day incubation (Study No. PC-216-2003, non-
GLP).  Cobicistat did not show significant cytotoxicity in MT-2 and HepG2 cells (CC50 of 88 and 44 µM, 
respectively). 
Potential molecular targets for COBI were screened, using radioligand binding assays against a panel of 
67 mammalian ion channels and receptors in two studies, Study No. TX-168-2007 and TX-168-2011.  
COBI demonstrated significant binding at calcium, potassium, and sodium ion channels at 10 µM. 
Chronic treatment of HIV-infected patients with RTV is known to induce changes in body fat 
distribution (lipodystrophy), elevate blood levels of cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) and triglycerides 
(hypertriglyceridemia), and cause insulin resistance.  As COBI is an analogue of RTV the ability of COBI 
to affect metabolic toxicity was examined on proteasomes, adipocytes and proteases.  COBI showed 
lower potential for metabolism-related toxicities compared to RTV, it had no effect on lipid 
accumulation and had reduced inhibitory effects on glucose uptake and proteasome activity (Study 
Nos. PC-216-2001 and PC-216-2004, non-GLP).  
FTC: 
For FTC, no cytotoxicity was observed in vitro in human PBMC, MT-2, HepG2, CEM, MOLT-4, and Vero 
cells at concentrations up to 100 µM.  FTC was also found to be nontoxic to human bone marrow 
progenitor cells in vitro.   
The potential for mitochondrial toxicity with FTC was evaluated.  FTC was incubated with HepG2 cells 
at concentrations ranging between 0.1 and 10 µM for 2 weeks, and MT-2 cells were incubated with FTC 
at concentrations up to 100 µM for up to 8 weeks (Study No. TPI 11963, non-GLP).  FTC had no 
adverse effects on cell growth, mitochondrial DNA synthesis, or lactic acid production.  Further studies 
confirmed this finding.   
The inhibition of mitochondrial DNA synthesis was also assessed in an in vitro cell culture assay using 
Molt-4 cells (a T-lymphoblast cell line) (Study No. TGZZ/93/0016 and TGZZ/93/0023, non-GLP).  FTC 
did not reduce the ratio of mitochondrial to cellular DNA when tested at concentrations of up to 100 µM 
after 7 days of continuous cell exposure. 
FTC had no significant binding affinity at 19 different receptors (Study No. TPZZ/93/0002, non-GLP), 
has shown little or no direct effect on various isolated muscle preparations (cholinergic, adrenergic, 
histaminergic, and serotonergic), and had no major inhibitory effects on the contractile responses to

acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, isoproterenol, arachidonic acid, histamine, bradykinin, and 
angiotensin II (Study No. TPZZ/92/0055, non-GLP). 
TAF/TFV: 
A range of studies have been completed to examine the potential secondary effects of TAF, utilising 
studies already completed for TFV.   
The cytotoxicity profiles (CC50 values) of TAF, its stereoisomer GS-7339, TDF, and TFV were 
investigated in resting and dividing human PBMCs following 5 days of continuous drug incubation 
(Study No. PC-120-2009, non-GLP).  The maximum concentrations of drugs used were 100, 100, 50, 
and 2000 μM, for TAF, GS-7339, TDF, and TFV, respectively.  TAF doses used in this in vitro study 
were supra-therapeutic in concentration and duration. CC50 values for TAF ranged from 6.8 μM in 
dividing PBMCs to 25.1 μM in resting PBMCs.  TAF showed low cytotoxicity in resting and in dividing 
PBMCs.   
The cytotoxicity profiles (CC50 values) of TAF, TDF, TFV, and a panel of clinically relevant antiretroviral 
inhibitors were also evaluated in 2 T-lymphoblastoid cell lines (MT-2 and MT-4) following 5 days of 
exposure (Study No. PC-120-2007, non-GLP), TAF showed low cytotoxicity in T-lymphoblastoid cells 
providing ≥1997-fold increased selectivity relative to antiviral activity in T-lymphoblastoid cell lines.  .  
Similarly TAF demonstrated low cytotoxicity to hepatic cells (Study No. PC-120-2007, non-GLP). 
Tenofovir alafenamide also showed little to no effect on erythroid and myeloid progenitor proliferation 
in vitro (Study No. PC-120-2016, non-GLP). 
TFV exhibited low levels of cytotoxicity in resting and activated human PBMCs, and in an established T-
lymphocyte cell line, with CC 50 values >1 mM.  Similar findings for TFV were observed in HepG2 cells, 
skeletal muscle cells of human origin, and in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs). 
Similarly, TFV has shown no effect on haematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro (Study No. PC-120-2016, 
non-GLP).  Overall TFV has a low order of cytotoxicity in vitro. 
The cytotoxicity of TAF and TFV was assessed in human HEK293T cells transiently expressing OAT1 
and OAT3 (Study No. PC-120-2018, non-GLP).  Cells were incubated with serial dilutions of TFV or TAF 
for 4 days.  TAF did not interact with the renal organic anion transporters 1 or 3 (OAT1 or OAT3), and 
TAF exhibited no OAT-dependent cytotoxicity in human epithelial kidney cells transiently expressing 
these transporters.  In addition, the selectivity index (considering CC50 in renal HEK293 cells 
expressing OAT1 or OAT3 relative to EC50 in primary CD4+ T lymphocytes) for TAF (29,000 and 4270, 
respectively) was much higher than for TFV (14 and 82, respectively).  As a result TAF is unlikely to 
accumulate in renal proximal tubules in an OAT-dependent manner, supporting the hypothesis that it 
has the potential for an improved renal safety profile.   
When primary osteoblasts and PBMCs were treated with TAF doses consistent with human therapeutic 
exposure, comparable TFV-DP levels were achieved (Study No. PC-120-2008).  At these therapeutically 
relevant doses of TAF, there were no in vitro effects on cell viability with primary osteoblasts or PBMCs. 
Similar to the other components in E/C/F/TAF FDC, the impact of TAF on mitochondrial toxicity was 
assessed.  Previous studies have demonstrated a minimal effect of TFV on the mitochondrial DNA 
synthesis in vitro.  The potential for TAF to induce mitochondrial DNA depletion was evaluated in 
HepG2 cells (Study No. PC-120-2006, non-GLP).  HepG2 cells treated with TAF (0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 μM) 
for 10 days exhibited no significant reduction in mitochondrial DNA compared with untreated cells.   
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 29/159  
  
  
 
 
No effect of TFV was seen on the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA or lactic acid production in HepG2 
human liver cells or in normal human skeletal muscle cells (SkMCs) (Study No. P1278-00042, non-
GLP).  The results confirm the low potential for TFV to interfere with mitochondrial functions. 
Combinations: 
The combination of TFV and FTC was studied for cytotoxicity in MT-2 cells.  No cytotoxicity was 
observed at the highest concentrations tested, up to 50 µM TFV and 5 µM FTC (Study No. PC-164-
2002, non-GLP).  Cytotoxicity studies were also conducted on the combination of TFV and FTC in 
HepG2 cells to evaluate their potential combined mitochondrial toxicity; no cytotoxicity was observed 
(Study No. TX-104-2001, non-GLP). 
Given the lack of effects in the in vitro studies with the individual agents (EVG, COBI, FTC, TFV, or 
TAF) or with the combination of EVG+COBI+FTC+TFV, no additional secondary pharmacodynamic 
studies have been conducted for the E/C/F/TAF combination. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Both in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies have been completed for EVG, COBI, FTC, and 
TAF.  No studies were conducted to examine the E/C/F/TAF combination.   
EVG: 
Cardiovascular System: 
Elvitegravir at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 µM had no effect on the hERG tail current in vitro (Study 
No. JTK303-SP-003, GLP).  A slight reduction (24.3%) in the hERG tail current was observed at the 
highest feasible concentration of 10 µM.   
In isolated guinea pig papillary muscle, EVG at concentrations up to and including 3 µM had no effect 
on action potential parameters, including resting membrane potential, action potential amplitude, 
action potential duration at 50% and 90% of repolarisation, and maximal upstroke velocity (Study No. 
JTK303-SP-004, GLP). 
Elvitegravir was orally administered to 4 male conscious, telemetered beagle dogs at 0 (vehicle; corn 
oil), 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, in a dose volume of 2.5 mL/kg, in ascending order with an interval of 7 
days between each of the doses.  At doses up to 100 mg/kg, EVG did not produce adverse effects on 
blood pressure, heart rate (HR), or the ECG up to 24 hours after dose administration (Study No. 
JTK303-SP-002, GLP). 
Central Nervous System: 
Male SD rats were treated with single oral doses of EVG (100, 300 and 2000 mg/kg) or vehicle control 
(Study No. JTK303-SP-001, GLP) using gavage at a dose volume of 10 ml/kg.  No effects were 
observed in terms of behaviour and general central nervous system effects at any dose.   
Respiratory System 
Elvitegravir was orally administered to 4 male beagle dogs at 0 (vehicle; corn oil), 10, 30, and 100 
mg/kg in ascending order with an interval of 7 days between each of the doses.  At doses up to 100 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 30/159  
  
  
 
 
mg/kg, EVG did not produce any adverse effects on respiratory rate or oxygen saturation (Study No. 
JTK303-SP-002, GLP). 
Gastrointestinal: 
The effect of EVG on the autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle was examined using isolated 
guinea pig ileum (Study No. JTK303-SP-005, non-GLP).  EVG at a high concentration (30 μM) inhibited 
single contractions by each of the contraction inducers, but the inhibition was slight, indicating that 
EVG has no definite effect on the autonomic nervous system or smooth muscle. 
In vivo, EVG did not affect the intestinal transport of a charcoal meal in male SD rats at doses up to 
2000 mg/kg (Study No. JTK303-SP-006, non-GLP). 
Metabolites:  
The most prominent metabolites of EVG, GS-9200 (M4) and GS-9202 (M1) were characterised to 
determine their ability to inhibit the hERG channel in CHO cells (Study No. TX-183-2005, non-GLP).  
GS-9200 and GS-9202 had IC50 values of > 100 µM and 81 µM, respectively.  These concentrations 
are at least 250-fold above clinical exposures. 
COBI: 
Cardiovascular System: 
Cardiovascular effects with COBI have been extensively examined during its development.  In vitro 
studies included evaluation of hERG tail current.  COBI inhibited hERG  (IC50 1.8 µM) and the hCav1.2 
L-type calcium channel (IC 50 6 µM), but was a weak inhibitor of the hNav1.5 sodium channel (IC50 
86.5 µM) (Study Nos. TX-216-2009, GLP and TX-216-2015, non-GLP).  Further in vitro work looking at 
action potential duration (APD) using rabbit Purkinje fibres revealed that COBI shortened APD at ≥1 
µM but there was no indication that this could lead QT prolongation (Study No. TX-168-2012, non-
GLP).   
Two Langendorff studies using rabbit hearts were completed to further examine the effects of COBI.  
In a study completed with COBI alone, COBI was associated with negative inotropic effects and 
shortening of the APD on the isolated rabbit heart at concentrations ≥1 µM.  At ≥3 µM, decreases in 
the QT interval and increases in the PR and RR intervals were noted (Study No. PC-216-2007, non-
GLP).  In a second Langendorff study in rabbit hearts, COBI produced similar negative inotropic effects 
(PR interval prolongation, and produced decreases in left ventricular [LV] function) at concentrations 
≥1.5 µM.  When COBI was combined with ATV, the changes to PR interval and left ventricular function 
were similar to that seen with COBI on its own (1.5 μM COBI coadministered with 1.5 μM ATV).  QRS, 
QT interval was unaffected by COBI alone, or when in combination with ATV (Study No. PC-216-2009, 
non-GLP).   
An in vivo cardiovascular study in telemetered conscious dogs was completed.  In this study male dogs 
received escalating doses of COBI by oral gavage at 5, 15, and 45 mg/kg, at a dose volume of 2 mL/kg 
(Study No. TX-216-2008, GLP).  A vehicle control group was also studied.  There were no adverse 
effects on hemodynamic and electrocardiograph (ECG) parameters up to 45 mg/kg.  Mild prolongation 
of PR interval was noted predominantly following the high dose (45 mg/kg) and sporadically at the mid 
dose (15 mg/kg).  There was a slight increase in QTc interval (<4%) only at the highest dose tested, 
low enough to not be considered clinically significant.   
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 31/159  
  
  
 
 
Overall the results of these studies suggest that COBI has low potential for QT prolongation, and a 
likely capacity to prolong the PR interval and decrease LV function.  No cardiac changes of note were 
observed in the 39 week toxicity study in dogs with COBI, and in a thorough QT clinical study there 
was no prolongation of QTc interval therapeutic and supratherapeutic exposures.  A non-significant 
increase in PR interval was observed in the QT/QTc clinical study.   
Central Nervous System: 
In the rat CNS study, changes were limited to salivation, decreases in arousal, locomotor and motor 
activities, and decreases in body temperature at doses of 150 mg/kg and above (Study No. TX-216-
2006, GLP).  The NOAEL was 50 mg/kg.  Tissue distribution studies in rats showed low levels of COBI-
derived radioactivity in brain suggesting minimal transport across the blood:brain barrier.   
Respiratory System: 
No adverse effects were observed in the rat respiratory study (NOAEL 500 mg/kg) (Study No. TX-216-
2007, GLP). 
FTC: 
Cardiovascular System: 
In vitro the effects of FTC on cardiac preparations was evaluated using isolated cardiac muscle from 
rat, guinea pigs and cats (Study No. TPZZ/92/0056, non-GLP).  Results from these in vitro studies 
suggested that FTC was free of negative cardiac effects at 1 µM. 
No effects on the cardiovascular system were reported in anesthetised dogs administered a cumulative 
dose of 38.5 mg/kg of FTC intravenously over a 1-hour period (Study No. TPZZ/92/0076, non-GLP).  
Rats given oral doses of up to 250 mg/kg FTC showed no effect on heart rate or blood pressure (Study 
No. TPZZ/92/0057, non-GLP).  In addition, there were no abnormalities reported on the ECG data 
obtained from the repeated-dose toxicity studies in monkeys, where AUC exposures were up to 26-fold 
higher than in humans administered the 200 mg dose.   
Central Nervous System: 
A range of central nervous system effects were examined in a single study conducted with male ICR 
rats (Study No. 477, non-GLP).  Mice (10/dose) were given FTC orally at 0 (distilled water), 10, 30, or 
100 mg/kg as a single dose.  FTC did not affect reflex, spontaneous locomotion, motor coordination, 
anticonvulsant activity, proconvulsant activity or analgesic activity at any dose tested.   
A further two studies in rats examined the effects of FTC on reflexes, analgesic activity and conditioned 
avoidance (Study Nos. TPZZ/93/0001 and TPZZ/93/0119, non-GLP).  FTC had no effect on these 
parameters.  
Respiratory System: 
Effects of FTC on the respiratory system have been examined in mice, rats and dogs.  In mice (Study 
No. TPZZ/93/0001, GLP) and rats (Study No. TPZZ/93/0001, GLP), animals were exposed to up to 
1000 mg/kg of oral FTC with no effect on respiratory rate at any dose.  In dogs (Study No. 
TPZZ/92/0076, GLP), male beagle dogs were intravenously administered FTC at 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20

mg/kg (cumulative dose = 38.5 mg/kg) over an hour.  No changes were observed on respiratory 
function at any dose.   
Gastrointestinal: 
Male ICR mice (10/dose) were given FTC orally at 0 (distilled water), 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg, then given 
a charcoal suspension orally at 1 hour postdose.  Emtricitabine did not affect GI motility at any dose 
(Study No. 477, non-GLP). 
Renal:  
Male Long Evans-derived rats were given FTC orally at 0 (distilled water), 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg and 
urine was collected for 6 hours postdose.  FTC did not affect urine output, pH, or electrolyte excretion 
at any dose (Study No. 477, non-GLP). 
TAF: 
In vivo safety pharmacology experiments were conducted using TAF as the monofumarate form (GS-
7340-02) in 50 mM citric acid.  In the in vitro hERG assay, TAF as GS-7340-03 was dissolved in DMSO 
and diluted with HEPES-buffered physiological saline to a final concentration of 0.3% DMSO. 
Cardiovascular System: 
TAF (as GS-7340-03) was evaluated at concentrations of 1 and 10 μM (free base equivalents [fbe]), 
and hERG inhibition was not significant.  The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of TAF on hERG was 
estimated to be greater than 10 μM (Study No. PC-120-2005, GLP).  
Oral administration of TAF (as GS-7340-02) to conscious instrumented male beagle dogs at dose levels 
of 30 or 100 mg/kg (24 and 80 mg fbe/kg) did not induce pharmacologic effects on heart rate, 
systemic blood pressure, or ECGs (Study No. D2000006, GLP). 
Central Nervous System: 
The effect of TAF on the central nervous system has been examined in GLP Study No. R990188 using 
male SD rats.  Animals were treated with single oral doses of TAF (as the monofumarate form) with 
doses of 0, 100 or 1000 mg/kg (80 or 800 mg free base equivalents [fbe]/kg).  There was no evidence 
of any effect on the CNS at any dose tested up to 1000 mg/kg.   
Gastrointestinal: 
SD rats were administered TAF (as GS-7340-02) by oral gavage at doses of 0, 100 or 1000 mg/kg (0, 
80 or 800 mg fbe/kg).  At the highest dose the rate of gastric emptying was reduced, although this 
was not observed at 100 mg/kg (80 mg fbe/kg).  A dose of 100 mg/kg was considered to have had no 
effect on gastric emptying or intestinal motility. (Study No. R990187, GLP). 
Renal:  
The effect of TAF (as GS-7340-02) on the renal system was evaluated in male SD rats following 
administration of single oral doses of 0, 100, or 1000 mg/kg (80 or 800 mg free base equivalents 
[fbe]/kg) (Study No. R990186, GLP).  Urinary output of calcium was increased at 1000 mg/kg,

however this was correlated with an increase in serum calcium concentration and indicated that the 
kidneys were functioning well in order to reduce the serum calcium load.  The no-effect dose for a 
pharmacological effect on the renal system was 1000 mg/kg. 
E/C/F/TAF: 
COBI has shown the potential for PR prolongation and to decrease LV function, no clinically-relevant 
cardiovascular changes have been observed with COBI administered as an individual agent, within the 
E/C/F/TDF FDC or within the E/C/F/TAF FDC.   
From the cardiovascular studies with TAF, there is potential for PR interval to be prolonged, as seen in 
the 39 week dog study at 18/12 mg/kg/day.  This change was observed to be associated with 
decreased weight gain, bone and renal toxicity, and significant decreases in triiodothyronine (T3).  In 
the safety pharmacology study in dogs however there was no evidence of PR prolongation or any 
change in ECG results in doses of up to 1000 mg/kg.  Results from the clinical thorough QT study also 
have revealed no cardiac signal. 
As there has been a comprehensive program for each of the four components in respect of safety 
pharmacology, no studies have been conducted with the combination in accordance with CHMP 
guidance (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005).  There is sufficient knowledge of the individual 
components to assess potential overlaps in safety risks, and the results do not warrant additional 
investigation of the combination.   
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of EVG, COBI, FTC, and TFV/TAF were 
evaluated in vitro and in a variety of animal models in vivo.  In addition, the drug-drug interaction 
profile was also evaluated.  The pharmacokinetics of the E/C/F/TAF FDC is discussed based on the 
results of non-clinical studies completed with the individual agents, no additional pharmacokinetic 
studies have been conducted for the E/C/F/TAF combination. 
Methods of analysis 
EVG: The in vivo pharmacokinetic, toxicokinetics, distribution, and excretion of EVG were assessed in 
the mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog.  Analysis of EVG in plasma from mouse, rat, and dog used validated 
methods based on high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC/MS/MS).  Similar methods were utilised to detect levels of EVG metabolites: GS-9204, GS-9200, 
GS-9202 and GS-9203.  For quantification of radiolabelled EVG, liquid scintillation counting (LSC), and 
radio-profiling was performed by LC with flow radio-detection.  Validation of each in vitro assay to 
detect levels of EVG and its metabolites has also been extensively undertaken.   
COBI: Analysis of COBI in plasma from mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs utilised fully validated methods 
based upon LC/MS/MS.  Similar methods were used for the analysis of the COBI metabolite, GS-9612, 
in plasma from mice, rats, and dogs.  LSC and radio-profiling were also utilised to detect radioactivity 
of [14C]COBI in mice, rats and dogs.   
FTC: The in vivo pharmacokinetic, toxicokinetics, distribution, and excretion of FTC were assessed in 
mouse, rat, and monkey.  Analytical methods used to quantify FTC in mouse, rat, and monkey plasma 
from the early preclinical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies employed 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 34/159  
  
  
 
 
reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and HPLC-MS (plasma and urine).  LC-
radio-profiling has been utilised to detect [3H]FTC in mice and monkeys, and to detect [14C]FTC in rats 
and monkeys.  
TAF: The in vivo pharmacokinetic, toxicokinetics, distribution, and excretion of TAF were assessed in 
mouse, rat, dog, and monkey.  The in vitro absorption, metabolism, and drug interaction 
characteristics of TAF were studied in appropriate model systems.  Levels of TAF and TFV in rats and 
dog plasma and PBMCs were determined using fluorescence derivitization/HPLC.  Additional methods to 
detect levels of TAF and TFV in mouse, rat, rabbit and dog plasma/PMBCs included validated LC/MS/MS 
methods, and HPLC detection methods.  The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of TAF 
were assessed in various species following a single oral administration of [14C]TAF, and levels of TAF 
and its metabolites were measured using LSC, HPLC or LC/MS/MS coupled with flow-through detector 
(RFD).  In vitro determination of TAF levels were in the main determined by LC/MS/MS, with some LC-
radio-profiling.  Induction potential of TAF on CYP activity measured mRNA levels using qRT PCR 
methods.   
E/C/F/TAF: In vitro transporter methods were developed to measure the impact of EVG, COBI, FTC 
and TFV on various transporter assays.  Validation reports are supplied to support the use of MDCKII 
and CHO cells, as well as assays using vesicular preparations.   
Absorption  
EVG: 
The in vitro permeability of [14C]EVG was studied using monolayers of LLC-PK1 porcine kidney cells 
transfected with an expression vector for human P-gp or with the empty control expression vector 
(Study No. JTK303-AD-026).  EVG underwent significant efflux across these cells, suggesting that it is 
a substrate for human P-gp. 
Single-dose pharmacokinetics of EVG and [14C]EVG were studied in rats and dogs.  Absorption was 
rapid following oral dosing to rats (Study Nos. JTK303-AD-005 and JTK303-AD-007) and dogs (Study 
Nos. JTK303-AD-006 and JTK303-AD-008).  Bioavailability was also in rats (30-35%) and in dogs (26-
33%), clearance also varied from low in rats to a more moderate level seen in dogs.   
COBI: 
Cellular permeability of COBI was studied using monolayers of Caco-2 cells (Study No. AD-216-2023).  
There was little evidence to suggest that COBI underwent significant efflux across these cells. 
Single-dose pharmacokinetics were studied in a number of species including rats (Study No. AD-216-
2020), dogs (Study No. AD-216-2021), and monkeys (Study No. AD-216-2022).  oral bioavailability of 
COBI was moderate in the rat (33%) and low in the dog and monkey (11% and 7%, respectively).  
High clearance values indicated that there is potential for high hepatic metabolic first-pass extraction 
following oral absorption in these species. 
The multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for COBI were derived as part of the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in mice (10 to 100 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TX-216-2032, TX-216-2041, TX-216-2026), 
in rats (10 to 100 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TX-216-2004,TX-216-2017), and in dogs (5 to 45 
mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TX-216-2005,TX-216-2016) dosed for periods of 4 weeks to 39 weeks.  There 
were species differences in autoinduction during these studies, with hepatic microsomal fractions from 
treated mice and rats showing higher levels of CYP3A, but with no increases in treated dogs.  COBI has 
been found to activate rat PXR, but not in humans. 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 35/159  
  
  
 
 
Multiple-dose toxicology studies in rats were also performed with COBI in combination with EVG and 
ATV.  In general, COBI only modestly increased EVG and ATV steady state exposures compared to EVG 
and ATV when dosed alone, consistent with its dual action as a reversible CYP3A inhibitor and a P450 
inducer in rodents.   
FTC: 
No in vitro permeability studies have been carried out with FTC, as FTC shows high, dose-independent 
bioavailability in vivo in mice and monkeys.  Single-dose pharmacokinetics of FTC have been studied in 
mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys.  FTC was rapidly and well absorbed with oral bioavailability 
ranging from 58% to 97% over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg/kg. 
The multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for FTC were derived as part of the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in mice (80 to 3000 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TOX109; IUW00701; TOX599; TOX628), in rats 
(60 to 3000 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TOX108; TOX097), and monkeys (40 to 2000 mg/kg/day; Study 
Nos. TOX600; TOX627; TOX032) dosed for periods of 3 days to 104 weeks.  There were no significant 
differences in pharmacokinetics following single and multiple dosing.  Exposure to FTC (Cmax and 
AUC) increased approximately proportionally with dose and was similar between males and females. 
TAF: 
In vitro: Permeability of TAF was examined using Caco-2 cells (Study No. AD-120-2037).  TAF was 
applied to monolayers of these cells at 10, 100, and 1000 µM, and TAF showed a dose dependent 
increase in forward permeability and a decrease in efflux ratio indicating saturable efflux transport.  
Addition of the efflux transport inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA) diminished the efflux ratio and increased 
the permeability.   
Mouse: Both single and repeat dose studies were completed in mice.   
In the single dose pharmacokinetic study in mice, TAF/TFV were evaluated following administration of 
TAF by dosing either GS-7340-02 or GS-7340-03 to male CD-1 mice or GS-7340-03 to both male and 
female 001178-W mice via oral gavage (Study Nos. AD-120-2014 and AD-120-2016).   
Tenofovir exposure increased with the increase in dose and was greater than dose proportional 
between 10 to 100 mg/kg.  Gender differences in plasma TFV levels were less than 2-fold in Cmax and 
AUC0-t values.  The pharmacokinetic profiles for the 2 different fumarate forms of TAF were observed 
to be generally similar.

Table 3.  Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose of GS-7340-03 to 001178-W 
Wild type Mice 
GS-7340-02 was administered by oral gavage for up to 14 days to male and female mice at a dose of 
100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day (Study No. TX-120-2006).  Due to early death for animals given 500 or 
1000 mg/kg/day, only the 100 mg/kg/day dose group was evaluated.  GS-7340 at 100 mg/kg/day 
corresponded to a Day 14 Cmax of 27.1 and 2.89 ng/mL for males and females, respectively; the AUC0-
24 could not be calculated due to the lack of a distinct elimination phase. GS-7340 rapidly converted to 
its metabolite, TFV.  There were no significant differences in TFV pharmacokinetic profiles between 
males and females. 
Following daily administration of GS-7340-02 to mice via oral gavage for at least 13 weeks at doses of 
0, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, the pharmacokinetic parameters for TAF and TFV were determined 
(Study No. TX-120-2007).  Exposure to TFV increased with the increase in GS-7340-02 dose from 10 
to 100 mg/kg/day.  The increases in Cmax and AUC0-t were generally greater than proportional 
between the 10 to 100 mg/kg/day dose levels.  Gender-based differences were less than 2-fold in TFV 
Cmax and AUC0-t values.  There was no sign of accumulation of TFV after multiple dosing, and there is 
rapid and extensive conversion of TAF to TFV after oral administration in mice. 
Rat: Both single and repeat dose studies were completed in rats.   
In the single dose pharmacokinetic study in rats, the two forms of TAF (GS-7340-02 and GS-7340-03) 
were again compared, as was the exposure to TFV between TAF and TDF (Study Nos. R990130, AD-
120-2015, and R2000065).  TAF was rapidly absorbed and generation of the major metabolite TFV was 
observed with a Tmax of less than 1 hour.  TFV exposure increased in a greater than dose proportional 
manner.  There no significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two forms of TAF, 
GS-7340-02 and GS-7340-03.

In a comparison between exposure of TFV generated due to TAF or TDF (Study No. R20000065), rats 
were treated orally with a single dose of 400 mg/kg of TAF (GS-7340-02) or TDF.  The plasma Cmax 
and AUC for TFV were 2- to 3-fold higher with 400 mg/kg TAF compared to 400 mg/kg TDF. 
The plasma pharmacokinetic profile of TFV was determined during the course of a 28 day oral gavage 
toxicity study in adult male and female albino rats following daily administration of either 1.5, 6.25, 
25, 100 or 400 mg/kg/day GS-7340-02 (Study No. R990182).  A greater than dose proportional 
increase in exposure was observed.  There was no evidence of accumulation.  
In a 26-week toxicology study, GS-7340-02 was administered once daily at doses of 0 (vehicle only), 
5, 25 and 100 mg/kg/day by oral gavage and plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of TFV were 
determined on Day 1 and during Weeks 13 and 26 (Study No. TOX-120-001).  No consistent 
differences in plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were found between male and female rats.  Mean 
tenofovir Cmax and AUC values increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 5 to 100 
mg/kg/day.  Mean TFV AUC obtained on Day 1 was slightly lower than that measured during Weeks 13 
and 26, which suggested that there was a slight accumulation of tenofovir with repeat dosing. 
Dog: Both single and repeat dose studies were completed in dogs.   
In Study No. 99-DDM-1278-001-PK the effect on pharmacokinetic parameters due to changes in the 
stereo configuration, fumarate form, food, and the route of administration was examined.  In this 
study Beagle dogs were administered TAF as a single IV bolus (GS-7340-02 [6.3 mg/kg]), or oral 
administration (TAF as free base [18.0 mg/kg], its diastereomer GS-7339 [18.0 mg/kg], the mixture 
GS-7171 [16.0 mg/kg], or GS-7340-02 [4,8, 5.0, and 20 mg/kg under fasted and 5.0 mg/kg under fed 
conditions]).  Following oral administration, TAF and its diasteroisomer were rapidly absorbed and 
eliminated with a tmax of less than 0.5 h and t½ ranging from 0.2-0.9 h.  The plasma exposures to the 
intact prodrugs were similar when TAF or GS-7339 were dosed separately, however, when the isomeric 
mixture, GS-7171, was dosed, the exposure to GS-7339 was approximately 3-fold higher than TAF.  
TFV exposure was similar for both diasteroisomers, although exposure in PBMCs was higher following 
dosing with TAF than with GS-7339.  The effect of food led to a decrease in overall plasma exposure of 
TFV and TAF (2.5 fold).   
When male Beagle dogs were given a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg TAF, there was rapid absorption 
and elimination, tmax was less than 0.5 h and t½ ranged from 0.2-0.9 h. The pharmacologically active 
metabolite, TFV-DP was the major metabolite in liver achieving a Cmax of 126 µM at 4.0 hours 
postdose. 
Following daily oral administration of 8.29 mg/kg TAF for 7 days to male Beagle dogs, the plasma and 
liver pharmacokinetic profiles were determined on day 1 and 7 (Study No. AD-120-2033).  TAF was 
rapidly absorbed and exhibited a short terminal half-life (t½) of 0.3 hours in plasma on both Day 1 and 
7.  The rapid disappearance of TAF was accompanied by an increase in TFV.  Tenofovir was the major 
metabolite detected in plasma achieving a maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of 1.47 and 2.12 μM 
on Day 1 and 7, respectively.  The pharmacologically active diphosphate metabolite, TFV-DP, was 
efficiently formed in dog livers achieving concentrations of 242 and 153 μM at 4.0 and 24 hours 
postdose on Day 7, respectively. 
The plasma PK of TAF and TFV and TFV levels in PBMCs were determined during the course of a 28-day 
oral gavage toxicity study in adult male and female beagle dogs following daily administration of either 
vehicle, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10 mg/kg/day GS-7340-02 (Study No. D990175-PK).  Repeat dosing at 
10 mg/kg/day resulted in nonlinear pharmacokinetics between Days 1 and 28 with TAF median AUC 
values of 0.454 and 0.985 μg·h/mL, Cmax values of 582 and 1280 ng/mL, and t½ λz values of 18 and 
23 minutes, respectively.  The TFV Cmax values appeared to be linear with increasing dose as well as 
repeat dosing.  The TFV t½ was estimated to be 37 h and substantial accumulation of TFV was

observed after repeat dosing. The TFV levels in PBMCs were not linear with increasing dose; however, 
a linear correlation was observed between TFV levels in PBMCs and corresponding trough plasma 
concentrations. PBMC concentrations were approximately 100-fold higher than corresponding plasma 
concentrations. 
In a 9-month toxicology study in dog, GS-7340-02 was administered once daily at doses of 0, 2, 6, 
and 18 mg/kg/day (Study No. TOX-120-002).  The dose of 18 mg/kg/day was decreased to 12 
mg/kg/day on Day 2 of Week 7 for males and Day 2 of Week 8 for females due to severe clinical signs 
and reduced body weight and food consumption.  The concentrations of GS-7340 and tenofovir in 
plasma samples and total TFV in Week 39/40 PBMC samples were determined.  GS-7340 was rapidly 
absorbed and converted to tenofovir following oral dose administration, with peak plasma 
concentrations of GS-7340 and tenofovir occurring at 0.5 and 1 hour post dose, respectively. GS-7340 
was eliminated rapidly from the plasma with a terminal phase half-life of less than 1 hour.  The median 
t½ of tenofovir was estimated to be in the range of 25 to 31 hours on Day 1.  The plasma 
pharmacokinetics of GS-7340 and tenofovir were comparable between male and female dogs after oral 
administration.  Plasma Cmax and AUC values for TAF increased more than proportionally over the 
dose range of 2 to 18/12 mg/kg/day.  The plasma TFV Cmax and AUC increased roughly dose 
proportional.  There was some accumulation of tenofovir following repeat dosing (~3-fold). Tenofovir 
concentrations in PBMCs were measurable at 24-hour post dose for all dose groups.  The median 
terminal phase half-life of total tenofovir in PBMCs was estimated to be 31 hours (similar to the 
tenofovir plasma estimate) from the recovery animals with PBMC concentrations measured up to 72 
hours.  Dose-normalized PBMC mean AUC values of total tenofovir increased more than dose 
proportionally during Week 39/40. 
Monkey: 
Single dose pharmacokinetics for TAF and TFV, and TFV in PBMCs was determined using rhesus 
monkeys administered single oral doses of GS-7340-02 at 0.5, 5.0, and 50 mg/kg (Study No. 
P2000087).  Tenofovir alafenamide and TFV levels increased rapidly with tmax values of approximately 
0.5 and 1 hour, respectively (Table 5).  Levels of TFV in PBMCs were also detected, levels of TFV 
persisted in PBMCs for up to 96 h and persisted to a higher extent to samples treated with acid 
phosphatase suggesting that a significant proportion of TFV-related material in PBMCs was in 
phosphorylated forms (Table 6).

Table 6.  Concentrations of TFV in PBMCs from Monkeys Dosed with GS-7340-02 
Following daily oral administration of GS-7340-02 at 0, 3, and 30 mg/kg/day or TFV at 15 mg/kg/day 
for 28 days, pharmacokinetic profiles of TAF and/or TFV were determined on Day 1, Day 14 and Day 
28 (Study No. P2000114-PK).  No significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were found 
between males and females.  The pharmacokinetic parameters for TFV were dose linear on Day 1 but 
were greater than dose-linear on Day 28 after oral administration of GS-7340-02.  There was no 
statistically significant accumulation of TFV following repeat dosing of either GS-7340-02 or TFV.  The 
intracellular TFV concentrations in PBMCs were determined from the 30 mg/kg/day GS-7340-02 dose 
group where 72.3 and 27.2 µg/mL were detected on Day 14 and Day 28, respectively. 
E/C/F/TAF: 
Potential drug interactions within the combination could affect absorption, FTC shows high passive 
permeability and is unlikely to be affected when administered with EVG, COBI, or TAF.  Tenofovir 
alafenamide and EVG are both efflux substrates in the intestine; therefore, absorption is increased in 
the presence of COBI due to inhibition of intestinal efflux transport.  
In vitro mechanistic studies on the potential for COBI to affect the absorption of TAF are described 
under drug interactions.  
Non-clinical studies of the absorption kinetics of the E/C/F/TAF FDC have not been conducted, however 
this has been assessed in appropriate clinical studies with the combination. 
Distribution 
EVG: 
Plasma protein binding of EVG is high and is concentration independent in rats, dogs, monkeys and 
humans (Study No. JTK303-AD-014).  The fraction unbound varied from 0.1% in rats to 1.2% in 
monkey.  The fraction unbound in human plasma, or in a physiological concentration of HSA, averaged 
0.7%.  EVG does not distribute to blood well from samples taken from rats, dogs, monkeys and 
humans (Study No. JTK303-AD-013).   
After oral administration of [14C]EVG to male or female albino rats, there was rapid distribution of 
radioactivity to highly perfused organs (liver, adrenal gland, kidney, heart, lung, and pancreas), with 
relative exclusion from the eye and brain (Study No. JTK303-AD-005).  Exposure in pregnant rats was 
generally similar to that in non- pregnant animals. 
COBI: 
Binding of COBI in plasma was moderately high, yielding a fraction unbound of 6.3% in human plasma 
at 1 μM COBI (Study No. AD-216-2026; AD-216-2076).  The extent of COBI binding to mouse, rat, 
and monkey plasma was similar, and the fraction of unbound COBI was similar acroos all species, 
including humans (4.75-6.54%).  COBI does not distribute well into the cellular fraction of blood from 
mouse, rat, dog, or human. 
Assessment report

After oral administration of [14C]COBI to albino and pigmented rats (Study Nos. AD-216-2034 and AD-
216-2060, respectively), radioactivity was rapidly and widely distributed to most tissues.  Distribution 
was extensively to glandular and elimination organs - GI tract, included liver, adrenal, kidney, and 
pituitary.  The tissues with the lowest Cmax values were eye, spinal cord, and brain, bone, and 
secondary sex organs.  There was no difference in distribution patterns between pigmented and non-
pigmented animals, except for higher concentrations to the uveal tract of the eye and to pigmented 
skin, suggesting an association between COBI and melanin.  Similar to EVG, exposure was no different 
in pregnant animals as compared to non-pregnant animals.   
FTC: 
The protein binding of FTC was very low (< 5%) in mouse, rabbit, monkey, and human plasma (Study 
No. TBZZ/93/0025).  The tissue distribution of [14C]FTC was characterised in rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys after a single oral dose of 200 mg/kg (Study Nos. TOX092 and TOX063, respectively).  
Distribution was extensive and rapid; levels were detected within 1 h post oral administration.  There 
was no sign of FTC accumulation and elimination was rapid, no radioactivity was observed after 72 
hours post-dose.   
Pharmacokinetic parameters for FTC in pregnant animals appeared to be generally similar to those 
reported for non-pregnant animals 
TAF/TFV: 
The extent of binding of TAF to plasma protein was determined using dog and human plasma only 
(Study No. AD-120-2026).  Rat plasma was not included as TAF is highly unstable in rat plasma due to 
the presence of a high number of esterases.  Protein binding of TAF was moderate in dog and human 
plasma with the percent unbound values of 48.0% and 46.8%, respectively.  The in vitro values are 
slightly higher than those observed using ex vivo samples from TAF treated humans which ranged from 
14 – 23%.  For the use in the interaction studies, the percentage of unbound TAF was round up to be 
20%.   
The protein binding of TFV has been determined in human plasma and serum using centrifugal 
ultrafiltration (Study No. P0504-00039.1). Percent of unbound TFV was 99.3 ± 3.3% in human plasma, 
and 92.8 ± 3.6% in human serum.  Tenofovir therefore showed very low protein binding in either 
human plasma or serum. 
Extensive tissue distribution studies with TAF were completed using mice, rats and dogs.   
Male CD-1 mice were treated with a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg [14C]TAF (Study No. AD-120-2011).  
Most tissues reached maximum concentration by 1 hour post-dose.  The tissues showing the highest 
maximum concentrations of radioactivity, excluding GI tract, included liver, gall bladder, urinary 
bladder, diaphragm, kidney cortex, kidneys, and kidney medulla.  The tissues with the lowest Cmax 
values were testis, brain cerebrum, fat (abdominal), spinal cord, and brain medulla.  Similar 
distribution profiles were seen in male C57 Black (pigmented) mice.  More persistent exposures in eye 
lens, eye uveal tract, and eyes were observed in CD57 black mice compared to CD-1 mice, although 
there was no indication that there was a difference in distribution between pigmented and non-
pigmented skin, or that TAF was more preferentially distributed to melanin-containing tissues. 
Male SD or Long Evans rats were administered oral 5 mg/kg [14C]TAF (Study AD-120-2020).  There 
was rapid distribution to most tissues, both to pigmented and non-pigmented rats.  The tissues 
showing the highest maximum concentrations of radioactivity included kidney cortex, kidney(s), kidney 
medulla, and liver.  The tissues with the lowest Cmax values were brain olfactory lobe, seminal 
vesicle(s), eye vitreous humour, thymus, eyes, testis(es), and harderian gland for Sprague-Dawley 
rats and bone, brain olfactory lobe, seminal vesicle(s), fat (abdominal), muscle, eye vitreous humour,

and eye(s) for Long Evans rats.  There was no indication that there was any difference in distribution 
between pigmented and non-pigmented animals, binding to melanin was unlikely.   
The distribution of TAF and TFV in pregnant and lactating animals has been evaluated.  In pregnant 
rats, rabbits and monkeys the extent of placental transfer of TAF and TFV was measured during the 
embryo-fetal developmental studies.  In rats there was a clear increase in TFV exposure with 
increasing dose of TAF (Study Nos. TX-120-2001 and TX-120-2002).  Multiple dosing in the dose-range 
finding study showed signs of accumulation of TFV, however this was not seen in the definitive study.   
In rabbits, there was an increase in exposure to TAF and TFV with increasing dose, with no evidence of 
accumulation (Study Nos TX-120-2004 and TX-120-2005).   
In the monkey the extent of placental transfer of TFV following subcutaneous administration was 
determined in pregnant rhesus monkeys (Study No. 96-DDM-1278-005).  Placental transfer of TFV 
appeared to be significant with a foetal/maternal serum concentration ratio of 0.17 ± 0.07 (mean ± 
SD) at approximately 30 minutes post-dose. 
E/C/F/TAF: 
Drug interactions, within the 4-drug combination, that affect distribution would not be expected from 
the data available.  Although plasma protein binding is high for EVG and moderate for COBI and TAF, 
the binding is very low for FTC and TFV.  As a result, interactions through binding displacement would 
not be anticipated.  An in vivo study with [14C]EVG and co-dosed RTV revealed no change in the tissue 
distribution of EVG.  As COBI shows similar transporter properties as RTV, albeit weaker, it is likely 
that COBI would not affect the overall distribution profiles for any of the other components in the FDC.   
Metabolism 
EVG: 
The primary metabolic pathways for EVG are hydroxylation to M1 (GS-9202), catalysed by CYP3A 
(Study No. JTK303-AD-017), and glucuronidation at the carboxylic acid moiety, catalysed by UGT1A1 
and UGT1A3 in humans (Study No. AD-183-2034), yielding M4 (GS-9200).  Minor pathways detected 
include benzylic hydroxylation (M2), generation of the direct ether glucuronide (M3) and combinations 
of the primary pathways (M7 and M8). 
After oral or intravenous administration of [14C]EVG to rats (Study No. JTK303-AD-019) and dogs 
(Study No. JTK303-AD-020), parent EVG was the most abundant analyte in plasma, with the 
glucuronide, M4, being the most abundant circulating metabolite.  The glucuronides, M4 and M7, were 
the most abundant analytes in rat bile, but in faeces these were apparently subject to deconjugation as 
EVG and M1 were the most abundant analytes.  A similar pattern was seen in dog faeces with EVG and 
oxidative metabolites being the most abundant analytes. 
COBI: 
The primary metabolic pathways for COBI are methine oxidation of the isopropyl moiety (M31, GS-
9612), cleavage adjacent to the methylurea (M26, GS-341842), cleavage of the carbamate (M21, GS-
9454), and cleavage and deethylation of the morpholine (M39).  Oxidation is primarily catalysed by 
CYP3A, which can generate all metabolites, with a minor role for CYP2D6 (which contributes to the 
generation of M31) (Study No. AD-216-2025). 
After oral administration of [14C]COBI to mice (Study No. AD-216-2073), rats (Study No. AD-216-
2082), and dogs (Study No. AD-216-2101), COBI was the most abundant analyte in plasma.  Parent 
COBI, M21, and M31 were the most abundant analytes in faeces, with M39 also being significant in dog 
faeces.  Profiles in bile from rats and dogs were complex, with many small peaks being detected (each 
accounting for ≤5.3% of the dose). 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 42/159  
  
  
 
 
FTC: 
FTC is not subject to significant metabolism by CYP enzymes.  Generation of a minor (~1%) sulfoxide 
metabolite (M1 and/or M2) was catalysed by CYP3A4, and inhibitor studies suggested that at least one 
other enzyme, possibly flavin-containing monooxygenase, may play a role (Study No. 15396 v1).  A 
minor direct glucuronide metabolite, M3, was also detected.   
FTC was not extensively metabolised and is eliminated primarily as unchanged drug by renal excretion 
in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys.  Over 90% of the radioactivity in mouse and rat urine and 
64% of the radioactivity in monkey urine was unchanged drug.  Only trace levels of metabolites were 
found in faeces (Study Nos. TEIN/93/0015, TEIN/93/0016, TOX063).  In all 3 species, metabolism 
accounted for only a minor percentage of FTC elimination.  FTC is subject to Phase I metabolism 
(oxidation to a diastereomeric sulfoxide) and to some direct conjugation (glucuronidation of 
hydroxymethyl group) as minor metabolic routes. 
TAF: 
Tenofovir alafenamide is subject to intracellular metabolism to TFV, which is further phosphorylated to 
the anabolites, TFV-MP and TFV-DP with TFV-DP being the pharmacologically active form.   
The applicant has proposed a possible metabolism pathway based upon the findings from mice, rats, 
dogs and humans (Figure 3.4.1).  TAF is also subject to intracellular metabolism to TFV, which is 
further phosphorylated to the anabolites, tenofovir-monophosphate and TFV-DP with TFV-DP being the 
pharmacologically active form (Figure 3).

Figure 3.  Proposed metabolism pathway for TAF 
In vitro Metabolism: The potential for CYP enzymes to metabolise TAF was assessed by incubating TAF 
with 6 individual bacterially expressed human CYP enzyme preparations co-expressed with human 
NADPH CYP reductase (Study No. AD-120-2004).  Metabolism of TAF was not detected by CYP1A2, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP 2D6.  Tenofovir alafenamide was slowly metabolised by CYP3A4 at a 
rate of 1.9 min-1 which was 26.6% of the positive control, testosterone.

Intracellular metabolic activation of TAF in PBMCs or other lymphatic tissues involves conversion to TFV 
by cathepsin A.  In contrast to PBMCs, TAF was primarily hydrolysed by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in 
primary hepatocytes.  Tenofovir is then further phosphorylated to TFV-DP by cellular nucleotide 
kinases.   
The in vitro activation of TAF in human primary hepatocytes was evaluated and compared with that of 
TDF and TFV (Study No. AD-120-2017).  Following a 24-hour continuous incubation of primary 
hepatocytes with 5 µM TAF, TDF, or TFV, the levels of TFV-Diphosphophosphonate (GS-77938) 
increased to 1,470, 302, and 12.1 pmol/million cells illustrating that incubation with TAF resulted in 5- 
and 120-fold higher intracellular levels of GS-77938 compared to TDF and TFV, respectively. 
The in vitro metabolism of [14C]TFV was studied in dog plasma, in control and induced (Aroclor 1254) 
rat liver microsomes, and also in dog liver and intestinal S9 fractions (Study No. 96-DDM-1278-003).  
Tenofovir was recovered unchanged under all conditions: no metabolites were detected in either rat 
microsomal preparation, with or without the addition of NADPH cofactor.  There was no evidence of 
chiral inversion either.  
In vivo Metabolism: 
The metabolic profiles of TAF were determined in plasma, urine, faeces, kidney, liver, and nasal 
turbinate from mice (Study No. AD-120-2012); in plasma, urine, bile, and faeces from rats (Study No. 
AD-120-2021); and in plasma, urine, bile, faeces, bone, and liver from dogs (Study No. AD-120-2008).  
The metabolite profiles were also determined in human plasma, urine, and faeces following 
administration of a single oral dose of [14C]TAF (Study No. GS-US-120-0109).  The findings from these 
studies are summarised in Table 7.   
TFV accounted for a majority of drug related material in plasma, urine, and faeces from all species 
except for human plasma, in which uric acid (M27B) was the predominant metabolite accounting for 
73.9% of the total AUC over 96 hours.  Uric acid is also detected to a large extent in mouse plasma 
(19.4%).  M18 was the major metabolite in rat bile accounted for 63% of total radioactivity recovered 
in bile.  M18 and its oxidised metabolite, M16 were the major metabolites in dog bile accounted for 29 
and 38% of total radioactivity recovered in bile.  Various oxidative metabolites were found in dog bile.  
No metabolites unique to human were observed. 
The extent of TFV transformation to TFV-DP was examined in PBMCs, red blood cells (RBCs) and lymph 
nodes from monkeys (Study No. P2001025).  Animals were administered a single dose of 15, 30, or 60 
mg/kg of [14C]TFV subcutaneously.  TFV was taken up by PBMCs and anabolised to TFV-DP, with 
intracellular concentrations of the active antiviral anabolite reaching 1.6 µM (60 mg/kg dose group).  
The half-life of TFV-DP in this experiment was >50 hours.  A similar pattern developed in RBCs and 
lymph nodes.  The long intracellular half-life in this respect supports the proposed once daily clinical 
dosing regimen.

E/C/F/TAF: 
EVG does not interact with drug metabolising enzymes as a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer while TAF is 
a weak substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A.  The effect of CYP3A inhibition by TAF should be minimal as

COBI is already a potent inhibitor of CYP3A.  The potential consequences of inhibition of CYP3A 
metabolism is further discussed in the section on pharmacokinetic interactions.   
FTC and TAF are analogues of different nucleosides, cytidine and adenosine, respectively and so have 
no overlapping metabolism pathways, and in fact in experiments in which both drugs are incubated 
together at doses higher than that expected to be achieved in the clinic, there was no influence on 
conversion of TFV to TFV-DP with the presence of FTC. Conversion of FTC to FTC-triphosphate was also 
unaffected.  In vitro studies also confirm that there exists a synergism between FTC and TAF (Study 
No. PC-183-2004).  
Excretion 
EVG: 
Recovery of administered [14C]EVG to rats and dogs was high, ≥97.7% following both oral and IV 
administration.  Recovery was almost complete by 48 hours post-dose, and the majority was found in 
faeces, although approximately 1% was also seen in urine following IV dosing.  In BDC rats 25% of 
radioactivity was recovered in bile and 69.2% in faeces.   
Excretion of EVG in rat milk was studied as part of a prenatal and postnatal developmental toxicology 
study in rats (Study No. TX-183-2006).  There is limited but detectable excretion of EVG from plasma 
to milk.   
COBI: 
After oral administration of [14C]COBI to mice (Study No. AD-216-2073), rats (Study No. AD-216-
2034), and dogs (Study No. AD-216-2067), recovery of radioactivity was high (≥86.1% in all groups) 
with the majority being found in faeces (≤2.06% in urine).  Recovery was largely complete by 48 
hours post- dose.  In BDC animals, approximately 69.3% was recovered in bile in rats, and this was 
63.9% in dogs.   
Excretion of COBI in rat milk was studied as part of a prenatal and postnatal developmental toxicology 
study in rats (Study No. TX-216-2033).  COBI was present in milk samples 2 hours post-dose.  
FTC: 
The primary route of elimination of [3H]FTC and [14C]FTC was via renal excretion of parent drug after 
oral and IV administration in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys.  The majority of the FTC recovered 
in the faeces after oral administration most likely represents unabsorbed drug, rather than biliary 
excretion.  Although FTC is metabolised to only a minor extent, its metabolites are also excreted via 
the kidneys. 
Excretion into milk has not been evaluated for FTC. 
TAF/TFV: 
Excretion of oral radiolabelled TAF has been reviewed across mice, rats and dogs.   
Mice were administered a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg [14C]TAF (Study No. AD-120-2011).  Recovery 
of radioactivity was 61% from urine and faeces 48 hours post-dose.  An average of 41.3 and 27.7% of 
the administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose. 
Male bile duct-intact and BDC male SD rats were given a single 5 mg/kg oral dose of 14C]TAF (Study 
No. AD-120-2020).  [14C]TAF was rapidly excreted within 24 hours after oral dosing.  The mean values 
of 71.9 and 22.2% of the administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, respectively, by 
168 hours post-dose.  The mean overall recovery of radioactivity was 96.7%.   
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 48/159  
  
  
 
 
Excretion of radiolabelled TFV was examined following IV administration at doses of 10 or 50 mg/kg to 
SD rats.  Excretion was 85.2 ± 7.63% at 24 hrs, and 92.7% ± 6.77 % by 7 days post dose in urine.  
Faecal elimination was 3.18% ± 1.85% by 24 hours, and 4.48% ± 1.89% by 7 days post dose. 
In dogs the excretion of [14C]TAF was determined after administration of a single 15-mg/kg oral dose 
of 14C-TAF to bile duct-intact and BDC male dogs (Study No. AD-120-2007).  [14C]TAF was readily 
excreted mostly within 48 hours after oral dosing.  The mean values of 37.4% and 35.9% of the 
administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose.  
Overall mean recovery of radioactivity was 80.4%. 
Excretion of radiolabelled TFV was evaluated in dogs following a single IV dose of [14C]TFV (Study No. 
96-DDM-1278-002).  The primary route of elimination was via urine, where 70.03% of total 
radioactivity was recovered.  Total faecal recovery of radioactivity was 0.42% of the total dose. 
Bile excretion: Bile excretion has been examined in both rat and dog studies following oral 
administration with radiolabelled TAF.  3.2%, and 2.11% of the administered radioactivity were 
excreted in faeces, urine, and bile, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose.  The mean overall recovery 
of radioactivity after oral dosing to BDC rats was 99.9%. 
The excretion of [14C]TAF was determined following oral administration of a single 15-mg/kg dose of 
[14C]TAF to male dogs (Study No. AD-120-2007).  Mean values of 42.7%, 26.5%, and 14.0% of the 
administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces, urine, and bile, respectively, through 168 hours 
post-dose.  Based on the radioactivity excreted in urine and bile, a minimum of approximately 41% of 
the orally administered dose was absorbed.  Elimination via biliary excretion appears to be the major 
route of elimination of [14C]TAF in dogs.  The overall recovery of radioactivity in BDC dogs was 86.2%.   
Excretion to milk: The extent of TFV excretion in lactating monkeys was evaluated.  Milk was obtained 
from 2 lactating adult female rhesus monkeys following a single 30 mg/kg subcutaneous dose of TFV 
(Study No. P2000116).  TFV was detected in the milk, the AUC in milk was between 18.6-21.5% of 
that seen in plasma.   
E/C/F/TAF: 
FTC and TFV are almost exclusively eliminated by renal excretion, while very little EVG or COBI is 
excreted in the urine, as a result any interaction between the compounds during excretion are thought 
to be unlikely.  In addition COBI has also been shown to have no inhibitory effect on OAT1 and only 
weak inhibition of MRP4, which are the transporters responsible for renal excretion of TFV. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
EVG: 
EVG showed no detectable inhibition of activities catalysed by CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 2E1 in 
human hepatic microsomal fraction and was not a clinically meaningful inhibitor of UGT 1A1, UGT1A3, 
and UGT2B7 while it was a weak inhibitor of UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 in vitro.   
In studies in human hepatocytes EVG showed no significant ability to activate human aryl hydrocarbon 
receptor (AhR) at concentrations up to 10 μg/mL (22 μM).  EVG does have potential to induce enzymes 
and transporters controlled by PXR, subsequently CYP3A activity is increased.   
EVG affected human P-gp-dependent transport only at a concentration (30 μM) above its aqueous 
solubility, and is also a moderate inhibitor of human organic anion transporting polypeptide 1 (OATP1) 
but a more potent inhibitor of human OATP1B3 (IC50 0.44 μM).  
COBI: 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 49/159  
  
  
 
 
COBI inhibits human CYP3A enzymes, its intended pharmacological action.  Cobicistat is a potent 
mechanism-based inhibitor of human CYP3A with inactivation kinetics (kinact 0.47 min-1, KI 1.1 μM), 
similar to those of RTV.  COBI does not inhibit human CYP1A2, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19, is a very weak 
inhibitor of CYP2C8 (IC50 30.1 μM), a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 (IC50 9.2 μM), and a modest inhibitor 
of CYP2B6 (IC50 2.8 μM).  COBI is also identified as a weak inhibitor of human hepatic microsomal 
UGT1A1 activity (IC50 16.3 μM).   
COBI showed no ability to activate human AhR and was a very weak activator of human PXR.  Other 
targets for induction (uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 [UGT1A1] mRNA, P-gp mRNA, 
and CYP2B6 mRNA and protein) were all unaffected or weakly affected by COBI treatment. 
At systemic concentrations achieved in plasma at the 150 mg COBI dose, COBI does not inhibit the 
drug transporters P-gp, MRP1, MRP2, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion 
transporter 1 (OAT1), or OAT3.  However, at concentrations achievable briefly in the intestinal lumen 
during absorption ([I]2 = 770 μM) COBI can inhibit intestinal efflux transporters such as P-gp and 
BCRP.  COBI is a moderate inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (hepatic uptake transporters).   
With respect to renal transporters, COBI is a weak inhibitor of MRP4, multidrug and toxin extrusion 
protein 2-K (MATE2-K), and organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), and a more potent inhibitor of MATE1 
and organic cation transporter novel, type 1 (OCTN1).   
FTC: 
FTC was not an inhibitor of activities catalysed by CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A in 
human hepatic microsomal fractions.  FTC also did not show inhibition of the glucuronidation of 7-
hydroxycoumarin, a general UGT substrate.  FTC did not activate human AhR or PXR at concentrations 
up to 50 μM.  In vitro studies indicate that FTC is not a substrate or an inhibitor of any of the 
transporters tested except for being a substrate of OAT3. 
TAF/TFV: 
The potential for TAF to be involved in drug-drug interactions has been assessed in a range of in vitro 
test systems.  The potential of TAF or its metabolites to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes and serve as 
substrates or inhibitors of xenobiotic transporters was assessed.  The effect of other drugs, including 
other antiviral agents that may be co-administered with TAF, on intestinal stability and the absorption 
potential was also determined.  Considering the data generated using ex vivo human tissue the extent 
of unbound TAF was estimated to be 20% of total exposure.   
Inhibition of Cytochrome P450 enzymes and UGT1A1: 
The potential for TAF and TFV to inhibit human CYP-mediated drug metabolism was examined in vitro 
using hepatic microsomal fractions and enzyme-selective activities (Study Nos. AD-120-2003 and 
V990172-104).  Inhibition of the following CYP450 enzymes was evaluated, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A.  TAF at a concentration of 25 µM was shown to weakly inhibit 
CYP3A with an IC50 ranging from 7.4 to 7.6 µM.  TFV did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, 
CYP2E1, and CYP3A.   
In Study No. AD-120-2040, the potential for TAF to be a mechanism based inhibitor of human CYP 
enzmes was investigated.  TAF at a concentration of 50 µM had no effect on inhibition to any of the 
tested isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6).  Tenofovir alafenamide 
did not inhibit UGT1A1 up to 50 µM (IC50 > 50 µM) (Study No. AD-120-2006).

Enzymology of Metabolism: 
To examine whether TAF may be metabolised by intestinal esterases and/or CYP enzymes following 
intestinal absorption, the effects of other HIV PIs and CYP inhibitors was explored in Study No. AD-
120-2027.  TAF was incubated with HIV-1 PIs (atazanivir or darunavir) or CYP inhibitors (ritonavir or 
COBI) at concentration of up to 100 µM.  The stability of TAF was unaffected by the presence of these 
CYP inhibitors or PIs.    
In order to investigate which enzymes are involved in activation of TAF in human hepatocytes, TAF was 
incubated alongside known CatA inhibitors (approved hepatitis C virus NS3 inhibitors, telaprevir and 
boceprevir), CES1 inhibitor (bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, BNPP), CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor (COBI), or 
telaprevir and BNPP together (Study No. AD-120-2031).  BNPP inhibited the metabolism of TAF in a 
dose dependent manner.  Formation of the active constituent of TAF, TFV-DP was unaffected on co-
incubation with telaprevir, boceprevir, or COBI.  Combining BNPP and telaprevir resulted in an 
enhanced level of inhibition.  From the results of this study it is implied that TAF is primarily 
hydrolysed by CES1 and CatA.   
Induction Liability: 
The ability of TAF to induce CYP enzymes/activity, P-gp or UGT1A1 was examined using cultured 
human hepatocytes treated with 1, 10, and 100 µM TAF once daily for 3 consecutive days (Study No. 
AD-120-2032).  Increases in CYP mRNA levels and increased CYP activity is represented in Table 8.   
Table 8.  Effect of TAF Treatment on CYP mRNA Levels and Activity in Cultured Human Hepatocytes 
There was evidence of cytotoxicity following dosing with 100 µM TAF with reduced CYP activity but 
increased mRNA levels.  After treatment with 10 µM TAF, the mRNA levels of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 
increased by 3.0- and 8.3-fold which correspond to 3% and 6% of control levels.  This demonstrates 
that TAF has a potential to induce CYP isoenzymes at 10 µM but this was reduced to little or no 
induction potential at 1 µM.  There was no evidence of a change in induction potential for P-gp or 
UGT1A1 mRNA.   
The potential for TAF to induce human drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters through the 
activation of human AhR or human PXR was further evaluated in cell-based systems (Study No. AD-
120-2005).  At a concentration of 50 µM TAF was only able to activate PXR at 23% of a positive 
control, rifampicin.  This effect reduced to less than 5% with a dose of 15 µM TAF.  Activation of AhR 
was not observed following dosing with 50 µM TAF.  TAF is unlikely to activate either PXR or AhR 
xenobiotic receptors.

Potential for Transporter-Mediated Drug Interactions with TAF and TFV: 
The ability of TAF and/TFV to affect to action of drug transporters has been explored in a number of in 
vitro studies.  A run-down of the relevant transporters affected by TAF (and EVG, COBI and FTC) is 
listed in Table 9 (transporter substrates) and Table 10 (transport inhibition).   
TAF:  
In terms of inhibiting drug transporters, TAF was unable to inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 
(Study No.s. AD-120-2019 and AD-120-2036).  Inhibition to OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BSEP, OCT1, and 
MATE1 was observed but only to a small extent, i.e. at doses that were 200-fold in excess to clinical 
meaningful exposures.  TAF is unlikely to mediate the role of transporter-mediated drug interactions. 
In terms of TAF acting as a substrate to drug transporters, TAF has been shown to be a substrate for 
intestinal efflux transporters, P-gp and BCRP.  There is an increase in TAF absorption in the presence of 
cyclosporine A (CsA) and COBI (inhibitors of P-gp and BCRP) (Study Nos. AD-120-2037 and AD-120-
2013).  In a study completed in which dogs were orally administered TAF at 2 mg/kg following 
untreated or pretreated animals with 75 mg/kg CsA, there was increased exposure to TAF in the CsA 
pretreated animals, although this had no effect on the overall level of TFV present.  The increased TAF 
plasma exposure led to an increase in levels of TFV-DP detected in PBMCs, suggesting that co-
administration of TAF with an efflux transport inhibitor (i.e. COBI) would increase absorption and also 
result in higher levels of the active anti-viral substance, TFV-DP.   
TAF was found to be a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  Exposure to 
TAF may be affected by inhibitors of these transporters or genetic polymorphisms that affect the 
transport activities.  Unlike TFV, TAF was not a substrate for renal transporters, OAT1 and OAT3. 
TFV:  
The route of elimination of TFV is renal excretion by a combination of glomerular filtration and tubular 
secretion.  In order to understand the role of transporters in the renal secretion of TFV and to explore 
potential drug interactions based on these transport systems, the interactions of TFV with a variety of 
both uptake and efflux transporters were studied in vitro.   
Results of in vitro transport studies indicate that the active tubular secretion of TFV is mediated by 
human OAT1 (basolateral uptake) and MRP4 (apical efflux) transporters acting in series in proximal 
tubules (Study Nos. PC-103-2001, AD-104-2001, AD-104-2002).  Human OAT3 may play a secondary 
role in the tubular uptake of TFV.  Neither P-gp nor MRP2 appear to be involved in the efflux of TFV.   
As the primary transporter handling the uptake of TFV, OAT1 has been assessed for its potential role in 
drug interactions between TFV and other renally secreted therapeutics including antibiotics, anti-
inflammatory agents, and other antivirals (including PIs).  Under physiologically relevant conditions, 
none of the tested drugs affected OAT1-mediated transport of TFV, indicating a low potential for renal 
interactions with TFV due to inhibition of this pathway (Study No. PC-104-2010 and Study No. PC-104-
2011).  
COBI also shows no detectable inhibition of human OAT1 or OAT3.  Similarly, PIs ATV, LPV, and RTV 
did not exhibit any effect on the active cellular elimination of TFV mediated by the MRP4 efflux pump, 
and COBI is a very weak inhibitor of MRP4.  The results of in vitro drug interaction studies indicate that 
PIs or COBI are unlikely to exert any substantial effect on the renal elimination of TFV in general or 
result in the accumulation of TFV in renal proximal tubules.  
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 52/159  
  
  
 
 
The results from in vitro studies investigating the contribution from MRP1 in tubular reabsorption of 
TFV (Study No. PC-104-2014) indicated that MRP1 is not involved in the reabsorption of TFV at the 
basolateral membrane of proximal tubule cells.  
TFV did not inhibit the activity of human OCT2 or MATE1 (IC50 >300 μM) so TFV is unlikely to cause 
drug interactions through inhibition of these transporters (Study No. AD-104-2012). 
E/C/F/TAF: 
To complement the studies described for the individual components of E/C/F/TAF FDC, a number of 
transporter studies were conducted with the STB components, EVG, COBI, FTC, and TFV.  The results 
from these studies have relevant impact on the TAF component as TFV is the major circulating 
metabolite of both TAF and TDF.  The ability of each of the components in E/C/F/TAF FDC have also 
been summarised in Tables 9 and 10.   
EVG, TAF, and TFV do not inhibit any of the transporters tested at clinically relevant concentrations in 
vitro, so are unlikely to pose any concern in this aspect of transporter-mediated drug interactions.   
Renal excretion of TFV is facilitated by basolateral uptake by OAT1 and OAT3 and apical efflux by the 
MRP4 efflux transporter.  There is no evidence for inhibition of TFV renal excretion by FTC, EVG, or 
COBI as they show weak or undetectable inhibition of OAT1, OAT3, and MRP4 in vitro.  Transport of 
TFV by OAT1, OAT, and MRP4 was not inhibited by COBI under physiological conditions and clinically 
relevant concentrations (Study Nos. PC-236-2008 and PC-236-2009).  In addition, COBI had no effect 
on the accumulation of TFV in human renal tissue slices at clinically relevant concentrations (Study No. 
PC-236-2007).  Cobicistat is a weak to moderate inhibitor of OCT2, MATE2-K, and OCTN1, while COBI 
and EVG are more potent inhibitors of MATE1.   
However, TAF is not an inhibitor of any of these transporters (Study No. AD-104-2012); therefore, 
there is low potential to further decrease the activity of the transporters relative to STB.  The inhibition 
of BSEP by COBI is unlikely to be clinically meaningful as the IC50 (6.5 μM) is in excess of the total 
plasma Cmax of COBI. 
COBI is a weak inhibitor of intestinal efflux transporters, but high concentrations of COBI in the 
intestinal lumen, achievable briefly during absorption, may inhibit P-gp and result in increase in TAF 
exposure.  In the presence of 90 μM COBI in the Caco-2 permeability assay, TAF permeability 
increased 4.6-fold and the efflux ratio was significantly decreased, suggesting a P-gp mediated drug 
interaction (Study No. AD-120-2013). 
Since both EVG and COBI are inhibitors and TAF is a substrate of OATP transporters in vitro, the 
exposure to TAF may be affected by EVG and COBI via inhibition of hepatic uptake. However, only a 
modest increase in exposure (not considered clinically relevant) of the OATP substrate, rosuvastatin, 
was observed when it was co-dosed with both EVG and COBI.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a prodrug of Tenofovir (TFV). A comprehensive program of nonclinical 
studies has been conducted with EVG, COBI, and FTC in support of marketing authorisations for these 
medicinal products. Only new data relating to TAF will be discussed in this report. Tenofovir 
alafenamide was evaluated in mouse, rat, dog, and non-human primate repeat-dose toxicity studies up

to 39 weeks in duration. In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were conducted. Rat fertility and 
developmental toxicity studies were conducted, along with developmental and reproductive toxicity 
studies and a local irritation study in the rabbit. The vehicle for toxicity studies used was 1) 25mM 
citric acid or 2) 0.5% polysorbate 20, 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose, 0.9% benzyl alcohol or 3) 0.1% 
(v/v) Tween 20 and 0.1% (v/v) hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). 
With agreement from Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/629722/2012; EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/2012/1), no carcinogenicity studies were 
conducted due to the lack of TAF exposure in rats and TgRasH2 mice and lower TFV exposure in rats 
and mice compared to the same studies in which TDF was administered. No peri/postnatal study was 
conducted based on scientific advice adopted by CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/ 214541/2013; 
EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/FU/1/2013/1). As with the carcinogenicity study rationale, there is an inability to 
measure plasma concentrations of TAF in rats, and TFV exposure after TAF administration was less 
than that already tested in the TDF peri/postnatal study. 
The absence of nonclinical safety studies with the combination is in accordance with the CHMP 
Guideline on the Non-Clinical Development of Fixed Combinations of Medicinal Products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005, January 2008). Extensive clinical safety data are available for the 
approved drugs FTC (Emtriva), TDF (Viread), the FTC/TDF FDC product (Truvada), and the E/C/F/TDF 
FDC product (STB, Stribild) and support the overall risk/benefit of this new E/C/F/TAF FDC product. 
In the development of TAF, 3 forms of the active drug substance were used: GS-7340, synonym for 
GS-7340 as the free base; GS-7340-02, synonym for GS-7340 as the monofumarate (1:1 molar ratio 
of free base to fumaric acid), and GS-7340-03, synonym for the hemifumarate (2:1 molar ratio of free 
base to fumaric acid). The hemifumarate, GS-7340-03 (TAF fumarate) is the selected for final 
development. It is stated that GS-7340-03 is considered comparable to GS-7340-02 based on 
physical/chemical properties and both exist as the free base in blood and biological fluids.  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies used GS-7340-02 however the applicant states that any potential effects 
of the hemifumarate have been evaluated by studies of the monofumarate. The hemifumarate, GS-
7340-03 was used in the male and female fertility study, dermal and ocular irritation studies, the local 
lymph node assay, and a second impurity qualification study.

In male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (5/sex/group) given an oral dose (15 mL/kg) of TAF at 100, 
300, or 1000 mg/kg (80, 240, 800 mg/kg free base equivalents [f.b.e.]/kg) followed by a 14-day 
observation period (study number: R990185) the NOAEL was considered to be 1000 mg/kg. 
Male and female beagle dogs (1/sex/group) were given a single oral dose (15 mL/kg) of 30, 90, or 270 
mg/kg (24, 72, 216 mg f.b.e./kg) TAF followed by a 14-day observation period (Study number: 
D990181). In-life observations of salivation, vomiting, reduced activity, tremors, incoordination seen at 
270 mg/kg which resolved 2 days following dosing. There was an increase in blood urea nitrogen at 
270 mg/kg (present on study Day 2, not study Day 14. Thymus weights were at all doses compared 
with controls, and thymic atrophy was present in males at 90 and 270 mg/kg. Renal tubular changes 
characterised by basophilia and/or karyomegaly were present in the male at 270 mg/kg and females at 
270 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg. The NOAEL as considered to be 30 mg/kg.

A two week mouse study was conducted; however the results were not interpretable due to a large 
number of confirmed gavage errors and the viscosity of the formulation.

food consumption was noted at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day. In the nasal turbinates an increased incidence 
and severity of  minimal to slight infiltrates of neutrophils in respiratory and olfactory mucosa, and 
minimal to moderate (100 mg/kg/day only) degeneration of olfactory epithelium was seen in both 
sexes at all doses. In addition adverse findings were noted in the nasal turbinates (exudate in the 
lumen) of both sexes at 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day. Minimal infiltrates and minimal olfactory 
degeneration were observed at a lower incidence in control animals. Minimal increased apoptosis of the 
rectum was seen in males and females at 100 mg/kg/day. No NOAEL could be determined. Due to 
limited concentration data for TAF, AUC values could not be calculated. At week 13, the TFV AUCtau 
(combined sexes) was 0.213 μgh/mL at 10 mg/kg/day.

4-Week Oral Rat Toxicity Study (Study number R990182) 
Daily oral administration of GS-7340-02 (15 mL/kg) at 1.5, 6.25, 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (1.2, 5, 
20, 80, 320 mg free base equivalents (f.b.e.)/kg/day) to SD rats (10/sex/group) for 28 days resulted 
in decreased body weight gain, reduced food consumption, decreases in white blood cell (WBC) and 
RBC parameters, calciuria, decreased bone mineral density (BMD), decreased 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin 
D3, renal karyomegaly, thymic atrophy, and atrophy of cancellous bone of the femur. Most effects 
were seen at 400-mg/kg/day group; however, some changes were noted at 25 mg/kg/day with a non-
significant decrease in 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 observed at 6.25 mg/kg/day. Based on changes in 
WBCs, the NOAEL was considered to be 6.25 mg/kg/day (no change in WBC count was observed at 
doses up to 100 mg/kg/day in the subsequent 26-week rat toxicity study – see below). 
26-Week Oral Rat Toxicity Study (TOX-120-001)  
Daily oral administration of TAF (GS-7340-02) at 5, 25, and 100 mg/kg/day (4, 20, 80 mg 
f.b.e./kg/day) to SD rats (15/sex/group) for 26 weeks resulted in minimal renal cortical tubular 
karyomegaly (100 mg/kg/day) and minimal to slight tibial cancellous bone atrophy (females, 100 
mg/kg/day), changes in bone density measurements (100 mg/kg/day) and changes in biochemical 
markers of bone turnover (25 and 100 mg/kg/day) were also noted. These effects were not observed 
at 5 mg/kg/day. TAF (GS-7340-02) dose-dependently increase biochemical markers of bone turnover 
in males and dose-independently decrease serum 1,25-dihydroxy- and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in both 
sexes at 25 and 100 mg/kg/day. It is stated that as the effects (increases in biochemical markers of 
bone turnover and changes in related hormones) seen at 25 mg/kg/day were minimal, it was 
concluded that the NOAEL was 25 mg/kg/day.

Toxicokinetic analysis of plasma samples showed that TAF was rapidly absorbed after oral dosing and 
was rapidly converted to TFV. No consistent differences in plasma pharmacokinetics were found 
between the sexes. Tenofovir was eliminated from the plasma with half-lives ranging from 7 to 13 
hours. Mean TFV Cmax and AUC values for combined sex groups increased dose proportionally over 
the dose range of 5 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day at each study period.

Rabbits (Study number TX-120-2003) 
Daily oral administration of TAF (GS-7340-02) at 20, 50 and 75 mg/kg/day to female rabbits, for 7 
days, was generally well tolerated. Plasma exposure to TAF and TFV generally increased with increase 
in dose level from 20 to 75 mg/kg/day. Values for mean Cmax and AUC0-t of TFV were generally 
higher on Day 7 than on Day 1. TAF was rapidly and extensively converted to TFV. The mean TAF 
AUC0-t on day 7 was unable to be calculated at 20 mg/kg/day (due to values below the lower limit of 
quantitation of 1.00 ng/mL) and was 0.252 and 1.174 μg·hr/mL at 50 and 75 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
The mean TFV AUC0-t on day 7 was 2.256, 5.741 and 10.070 μg·hr/mL at 20, 50, and 75 mg/kg/day, 
respectively. 
Dog 
4-Week Oral Toxicity Study (Study number: D990175) 
Daily oral administration of TAF (GS-7340-02) at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.08, 0.24, 0.8, 2.4, 
8 mg f.b.e./kg/day) to male and female beagle dogs (4/sex/group) for 28 days resulted in increased 
AST in females at 10 mg/kg/day and renal tubular karyomegaly and/or basophilia in both sexes at 10 
mg/kg/day and 1 male and 1 female at 3 mg/kg/day. Mean values for bone specific alkaline 
phosphatase, N telopeptide, parathyroid hormone, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D and 25 hydroxyvitamin D 
were generally similar across all groups. There were no effects on peripheral quantitative computed 
tomography-derived bone densitometry parameters (eg, bone mineral content and bone mineral 
density of the total slice and trabecular and cortical/subcortical compartments). The NOAEL was 
considered to be 1 mg/kg/day. 
At the lower doses, only Cmax and Tmax values for TAF were determined as most values were below 
the lower limit of quantitation of the assay. TAF was rapidly absorbed on Day 1, with median peak 
values within 0.25 to 0.5 hours of 18.5, 38.7, and 0.582 μg/mL at 1.0, 3.0, and 10 mg/kg/day,

respectively. Peak TFV concentrations occurred within 1 hour. At 10 mg/kg/day, Day 28 TFV Cmax and 
AUCtau were 0.44 μg/mL and 5.26 μgµh/mL, respectively (males and females combined). Comparisons 
between Day 1 and Day 28 at 10 mg/kg/day showed potential accumulation upon repeat dosing. 
Tenofovir in PBMCs was measurable (18.6 μg/mL) after 28 days of 10 mg/kg/day TAF.

39-Week Oral Toxicity Study with a 3 month recovery period (Study number: TOX-120-002). 
Male and female beagle dogs were administered daily oral doses (10 mL/kg) of TAF (GS-7340-02) at 2, 
6, or 18/12 mg/kg/day (1.6, 4.8, 14.4/9.6 mg f.b.e./kg/day) for 13 weeks (2/sex/group) or 39 weeks 
(4/sex/group). A dose-related decrease in body weight gain at 39 weeks was seen in all males at all 
doses and for females at 18/12 mg/kg/day. The dose for the high dose group was reduced from 18 to 
12 mg/kg/day on Days 45 and 51, for males and females, respectively, due to the occurrence of 
severe clinical signs and reduced body weight.  
There were 2 unscheduled deaths of high-dose males. One of these was considered to be due to a 
gavage accident and not treatment related. A different high-dose male was euthanized on Day 45 due 
to its deteriorating clinical condition, considered to be treatment related. Prior to necropsy the animal 
had shown reduced body weight; reduced food consumption; increased AST, globulin levels, 
triglyceride, cholesterol, total bilirubin; and decreased monocyte and platelet counts. Macroscopically, 
there was bilateral enlargement of the submandibular lymph nodes, which histologically had slight 
inflammation and plasmacytosis. Histopathology findings of significance included a mild, mononuclear 
infiltrate in the ocular posterior uvea; renal cortical tubular degeneration; atrophy of GALT, mesenteric 
lymph node, and thymus accompanied by an infiltrate of macrophages; mucosal atrophy of the fundic 
gland; mucosal hyperplasia of the pyloric gland; and mucosal degeneration and/or regeneration in the 
cecum and colon. 
Increased mean AST (~2.6x compared to control) and total bilirubin (~1.6x compared to control) in 
dogs administered 18/12 mg/kg/day. No ECG changes occurred at 2 mg/kg/day. At Week 39, a dose-
related prolongation of PR interval was observed at 6 (~ +13%) and 18/12-mg/kg/day (~ +24%) 
groups. TAF reduce heart rate with an associated QT interval prolongation was seen at 18/12 
mg/kg/day. According to the Applicant these changes were associated with decreases in serum 
triiodothyronine (T3).  After the 13-week recovery period, serum T3 values returned to levels similar to 
the controls.  
The applicant states that all bone markers showed age-related decreases. After 3 months, there were 
some differences noted among mean values for bone formation (skeletal alkaline phosphatase [sALP]) 
and bone resorption markers (urinary free deoxypyridinoline and N telopeptide) at all doses compared 
to controls. After 9 months, statistically significant increases in mean values for the bone resorption 
marker urinary N telopeptide were noted for both sexes at 18/12 mg/kg/day (p ≤0.05), compared to 
controls. A similar though not statistically significant trend was noted in animals at 6 mg/kg/day, 
suggesting a dose-related response. No significant changes in free deoxypyridinoline were observed,

with no consistent effects (increases) among treated groups. For the formation marker, serum sALP 
values at all doses were comparable controls except for one male at 18/12 mg/kg/day, which was 
outside the control ranges. At the end of the recovery period, bone marker values returned to below 
the control range consistent with an age effect and recovery from treatment. 
At 18/12 mg/kg/day administered once daily to young beagle dogs for 39 weeks resulted in changes in 
bone densitometry parameters (by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA] analysis) considered to 
reflect primarily effects on bone growth. These changes were considered by the Applicant as secondary 
to the effects on body weight. 
Histopathology changes were noted in the kidneys, eyes, lungs, and spleen after both 13 and 39 
weeks. The liver and possibly the adrenal glands were additional target organs identified after 39 
weeks. After 13-weeks of treatment, findings of renal cortical tubular degeneration/regeneration and 
karyomegaly were seen at 6 or 18/12 mg/kg/day; findings after 39 weeks of treatment were similar. 
These changes were minimal to slight (Grade 1 to 2) at 6 mg/kg/day in both sexes. At 18/12 
mg/kg/day severity ranged from mild to moderate (Grade 2 to 3). After 39-weeks of treatment, similar 
lesions (minimal (Grade 1 karyomegaly and tubular degeneration) were seen in 2 males at 2 
mg/kg/day.  
A minimal to slight (Grade 1 to 2) infiltration of mononuclear cells in the ocular posterior uvea was 
noted in some animals at 18/12 mg/kg/day after both treatment periods. Alveolar histiocytosis was 
present in the lungs after 13-weeks at 18/12 mg/kg/day. Additional pulmonary findings noted following 
39-weeks of treatment and consisted of macrophage accumulation with pigment, which was detected 
predominantly at18/12 mg/kg/day and in few animals at 6- or 2-mg/kg/day. An infiltration of 
macrophages laden with pigment was very frequently seen in the splenic white pulp at 18/12 
mg/kg/day after both treatment periods. After 39 weeks of treatment centrilobular hepatocellular 
cytoplasmic acidophilic inclusions were seen at 18/12 mg/kg/day, pigment deposits in hepatic 
macrophages and/or sinusoidal cells (Kupffer cells) was seen at 18/12 mg/kg/day. Also, similar 
pigment deposits in the sinusoidal cells (tissue macrophages) of the adrenal glands were seen in a few 
animals at 18/12 mg/kg/day. The cause of the intracellular pigment in tissue macrophages in the lung, 
liver, spleen, and adrenal is not known but could represent accumulation of the test article and/or test 
article metabolite(s) in these cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. After the 13-week recovery 
period test article-related histological changes were still present in the kidneys, lungs, and liver 
however were reduced in incidence and severity. 
At 18/12 mg/kg/day, a minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in some organs (eye [choroid 
plexus, ciliary body], lung, and spleen) in some animals. In-life ophthalmologic examinations were 
normal. 
The NOAEL after 39 weeks of treatment was considered to be 2 mg/kg/day. Treatment-related findings 
were completely or partially reversible following a 13-week recovery period.

Non-human primate  
4-Week Oral Rhesus Monkey Toxicity Study (Study number P2000114) 
Animals were given TAF (GS-7340-02) at 3 or 30 mg/kg/day (2.4, 24 mg f.b.e./kg/day) or TFV at 15 
mg/kg/day. According to the company there were no adverse in-life effects and no clear test article-
related effects on body weight, serum chemistry, plasma chemistry, haematology (including 
lymphocyte subsets determined by flow cytometry), standard urinalysis parameters, organ weights, 
and bone-related or histologic parameters. There was 1 death at 30-mg/kg/day TAF, which was not 
considered test article-related (no further details are provided on the toxicology summary). Kidney, 
liver, and skeletal muscle samples assayed for indicators of mitochondrial integrity showed no effects. 
The NOAEL for TAF was considered to be 30 mg/kg/day.  
The TAF Cmax values were nonlinear with dose, with greater than expected increases in Cmax with dose. 
The TAF AUCtau could only be calculated at 30-mg/kg/day group, with a mean value of 1.03 µg·h/mL 
and a terminal elimination half-life of 0.335 hours. There was no sex difference. 
Table 15.  Mean Pharmacokinetics vales for TAF  
Day 28 TFV Cmax and AUC exhibited slightly greater than proportional increases with increasing dose. 
Comparison between Days 1 and 28 showed no statistical difference for Cmax or AUC indicating no 
change in clearance over time. There was no sex difference.

Carcinogenicity 
Elvitegravir, FTC and TDF have all demonstrated low carcinogenic potential in conventional 2-year 
studies.  
COBI was not carcinogenic at exposures that were 7-to 16-fold higher than those observed clinically. 
In the rat, following repeated oral administration for a minimum of 97 weeks at 10, 25, and 50 
mg/kg/day (males) and 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (females), COBI caused an increased incidence of 
combined thyroid follicular cell adenoma and carcinomas at exposures (AUC) that were lower than that 
observed clinically. It is acknowledged that the thyroid and liver changes are considered adaptive 
changes, secondary to hepatic microsomal enzyme induction due to activation of PXR. Given that this 
extent of activation of PXR and CYP3A does not occur at clinically relevant concentrations in humans, 
COBI is not considered to pose a carcinogenic risk in man. 
Based on the scientific advice adopted by the CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/2012/1), carcinogenicity 
studies are not required for TAF. Indeed, TAF is not genotoxic, the lack pre-neoplastic lesions in 
repeat-dose studies especially in dog where higher exposure to this prodrug was reached (8-fold the 
human recommended dose based on AUC), the low exposure to TAF in rodents make long term 
carcinogenicity studies with sufficient exposure unfeasible, the irrelevant TgRasH2 mouse model for 
carcinogenicity testing with TAF (limiting pharmacokinetic factor), the lack special hazard for humans 
based on carcinogenicity studies with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and by the fact that TAF is rapidly 
converted to tenofovir and therefore disappears relatively quickly from plasma in humans (Tmax 1 h). 
Given the lack of genotoxicity for each compound (EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF), the low carcinogenic potential 
for EVG, FTC, COBI and TDF, it is considered unlikely that new combination dosing would change this 
profile. Therefore the conduct of carcinogenicity study with the EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF combination is not 
considered necessary.

Reproduction Toxicity 
Oral Fertility and General Reproduction Toxicity Study of TAF in Sprague-Dawley Rats (Study 
number TX-120-2012).  
Male and female Crl:CD(SD) rats 20, 80, or 160 mg free base equivalent (f.b.e.)/kg/day (22, 90, 180 
mg GS-7340-03/kg/day) TFV (GS-7340-03). Males were necropsied after at least 10 weeks of dosing, 
the reproductive organs were weighed followed by assessment of sperm motility and total 
concentration. Male and female reproductive performance was evaluated based on results of 
confirmation of mating and pregnancy. There were some effects on male body weight at 80 and 160 
mg/kg/day and female at 160 mg/kg/day throughout the study.  
There were no differences in premating estrous cycles. There were no test article-related differences in 
male or female reproductive parameters. There were no test article-related effects on the uterine and 
fetal parameters and no significant differences in female reproductive organ weights. There was a 
slight increase in absolute testis weight (significant increase (9%) in the adjusted mean of the left 
testis only) at 160 mg/kg/day. This was considered by the Applicant to be test article-related but not 
adverse, as there were no other reproductive organ weight or functional reproductive effects. There 
were no test article-related effects observed on mean epididymal sperm motility or on sperm 
concentration. The NOAEL for male and female toxicity was 80 mg/kg/day. The TAF NOAEL for 
reproductive and early embryonic toxicity was 160 mg/kg/day.  
Oral Embryo-Fetal Development Study of TAF in Rats (Study number: TX-120-2002) 
Four groups of 25 pregnant female Crl:CD(SD) rats were given daily doses of TAF (GS-7340-02), by 
oral gavage, from GD 6 to 17, inclusive. Targeted dose levels were 0 (vehicle control), 25, 100 and 
250 mg/kg/day. Dose formulation analysis showed that each 5 mg/kg/day animal was administered a 
GS-7340-02 concentration of 3.85 mg/mL instead of 5 mg/mL for 5 to 8 days between GD 10 and 17, 
providing a daily dose of 19.3 mg/kg/day (77% of targeted dose) on these days. Dose formulation 
analysis showed that each 20 mg/kg/day animal was administered a GS-7340-02 concentration of 12.9 
mg/mL instead of 20 mg/mL for 4 to 7 days between GD 6 and 12, providing a daily dose of 64.6 
mg/kg/day (65% of targeted dose) on these days. 
At 250 mg/kg/day a statistically significant decrease in the number of animals noted with incomplete 
ossification of the interparietal and hyoid bones was noted at 250 mg/kg/day. Other minor skeletal 
anomalies were comparable in incidence to controls. At this dose group body weights, body weight 
gains and food consumption were significantly decreased during the treatment period. On GD 21, the 
mean body weight of the 250 mg/kg/day group was 10 % lower than that of the controls. Mean 
corrected body weights (body weight on GD 21 minus gravid uterus weight) and mean corrected body 
weight gains (body weight gain on GD 6 to 21 minus gravid uterus weight) were also lower at 250 
mg/kg/day, with the corrected mean body weights also 10% lower than controls on GD 21. Fetal 
weights (males, females and sexes combined) were decreased dose dependently and remained within 
the range of historical control data, however fetal weights at 250 mg/kg/day were at the lower 
extreme of this range. The incidences of fetal major malformations, minor external, visceral and 
skeletal anomalies and were not affected by TAF. Sternebrae variants (1 to 4 and 5 and 6) were 
increased at 250 mg/kg/day.  
In summary, at 250 mg/kg/day, there was decreased fetal body weight associated with some delays in 
the rate of ossification. There was no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity attributed to TAF in 
this study. The maternal TAF NOAEL and the TAF NOAEL for embryo-fetal development were both 
considered to be 100 mg/kg/day, which resulted in GD17 AUC0-t values of 17.4 and 0.2 μg·hr/mL for 
TFV and TAF, respectively.

Plasma concentrations of TAF were all below the lower limit of quantitation at 25 mg/kg/day. Exposure 
to TAF increased with the increasing dose from 25 to 250 mg/kg/day. Exposure to TFV increased with 
the increase in TAF dose from 25 to 250 mg/kg/day.

and 17  
Oral Embryo-Fetal Development Study of TAF in Rabbits (TX-120-2005) 
TAF (GS-7430-02) was administered by oral gavage to time-mated F0 generation female rabbits (20 
main study females per group and 3 toxicokinetic females per group) at 0 (vehicle control), 10, 30 and 
100 mg/kg/day. Lower body weight gains were noted at 100 mg/kg/day for the first week following 
treatment initiation. Lower food intake was noted at 100 mg/kg/day from GD 8 to 24. Three animals at 
this dose consumed less than 30 g for at least 4 days during the dosing period. There were no TAF-
related macroscopic changes. The number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, live fetuses, dead 
fetuses, resorptions, the sex ratio and the pre and post implantation losses were not affected. There 
was no effect of TAF on fetal weights. The incidence of major malformations, minor external, visceral, 
skeletal anomalies and common skeletal variants were not affected by TAF. 
Exposure to TAF increased increasing dose (10 to 100 mg/kg/day). The increases in Cmax were 
greater than proportional between 10 to 100 mg/kg/day and the increases in AUC0-t were greater 
than proportional between 30 to 100 mg/kg/day on GD 20. Exposure to TFV increased with increasing   
TAF doses from 10 to 100 mg/kg/day. The increases in Cmax and AUC0-t were roughly proportional 
between the 10 to 100 mg/kg/day. Accumulation of TFV was observed after multiple dosing. 
Concentrations of TFV were higher than concentrations of TAF, indicating that TAF was extensively 
converted to TFV. The TAF NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 30 mg/kg/day (AUC0-t = 1.1 and 5.0 
μg·h/mL for TAF and TFV, respectively) and the TAF NOEL for embryo-fetal development was 100 
mg/kg/day (AUC0-t = 11.0 and 27.3 μg·h/mL for TAF and TFV, respectively.

Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
Based on the scientific advice adopted by CHMP(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/214541/2013; 
EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/FU/1/2013/1), a peri/postnatal study in rats is not required for TAF registration 
due to the lack of TAF exposure in rats and lower TFV exposure compared to TDF.

Local Tolerance  
In a bovine corneal opacity and permeability assay (BCOP) TAF (GS-7340-03) elicited an in vitro 
irritancy score of 21.0 ± 8.7 with a 4-hour incubation and was predicted to be a noncorrosive/non-
severe eye irritant. 
In a dermal irritation study in rabbits animals were given a single 4 hour, semi-occlusive, dermal 
administration of approximately 0.5 g of TAF (GS-7340-03 and were observed for 4 days (Study 
Assessment report

number: TX-120-2011). No local dermal reaction was observed in any animal throughout the duration 
of the study. The Primary Irritation Index was calculated to be 0.0; TAF was classified as a ‘non-
irritant’. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Female mice were given TAF (GS-7340-03) at of 10, 25 or 50% w/v. The animals were administered 
TAF by daily application of 25 μL of the appropriate concentration or control (vehicle or positive), to the 
dorsal surface of both ears for 3 consecutive days. The proliferative response of the lymph node cells 
(LNCs) from the draining auricular lymph nodes was assessed 5 days following the initial application, 
by measurement of the incorporation of 3H-methyl thymidine (3HTdR) by β-scintillation counting of 
LNC suspensions. The response was expressed as radioactive disintegrations per minute per lymph 
node (dpm/node) and as the ratio of 3HTdR incorporation into LNC of test nodes relative to that 
recorded for control nodes (test/control ratio), termed as SI. The test substance is regarded as a 
sensitizer if at least one concentration of the chemical has a SI of 3 or more. The SI obtained for 10%, 
25%, and 50% w/v were 0.9, 1.0, and 1.0, respectively, which indicates that TAF did not show the 
potential to induce skin sensitisation. The EC3 value (the “estimated concentration of 3” is the 
concentration of test substance which would result in a SI of 3 in the LLNA) was determined to be 
higher than 50% w/v. The SI for the positive control substance hexyl cinnamic aldehyde was 6.3, 
which demonstrates the validity of this study. 
Studies on impurities 
Two studies were conducted to evaluate the toxicity and to qualify potential impurities of TAF. In the 
first male SD rats were given TAF (GS-7340-02) at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day from 2 different purity lots (Lot 
No. 1 - 97.7% and Lot No. 2 - 83.1%) for 14 days. The impurities, including 13% GS-7339, were 
added to the more pure lot. Administration of 97.7% pure and 83.1% pure GS-7340-02 by oral gavage 
for 14 days to male rats was well tolerated. No test article-related findings were noted, and no 
differences were found between the 2 lots tested. At 50 mg/kg/day on Day 14, the TFV Cmax was 218 
ng/mL and the AUC0-t was 1965 ng·hr/mL for 97.7% pure GS-7340-02 (Lot No. 1:7340-02-AC-1EA) 
and the TFV Cmax was 395 ng/mL and the AUC0-t was 2481 ng·hr/mL for 83.1% pure GS-7340-02 
(Lot No. 2: 7339-AZS-27-1094-41). 
In the second study male and female rats were given oral doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg/day (free base 
equivalents) for 29 days. Test article 1 was 99.3% pure GS-7340-03. Test article 2 was 98% pure GS-
7340-03 containing 11 spiked impurities. Test article 3 was 97.8% pure GS-7340-03 containing 4 
spiked impurities. Administration of GS-7340-03 drug substance with 3 different impurity profiles was 
well tolerated. There were no significant in-life or histopathological differences between the 3 lots 
tested.  
Several degradation products related to COBI and FTC have been identified in batches of 
EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF tablets and all of them have been observed in batches of EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF 
tablets. Some of these products were tested in a 28-day toxicity study in rats using non-degraded and 
degraded EVG/COBI tablets. The degradation products of TAF observed in the EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF 
tablets is consistent with those in the TAF drug substance. There are no unique impurities or 
degradants in the EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF tablets.

The impurities and degradation products present in EVG, COBI, FTC, and TAF and in 
EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF tablets have been qualified through toxicology studies which employed drug 
substance from normal productions batches, laboratory scale batches with enhanced levels of 
impurities, or samples subjected to forced degradation conditions (high heat and humidity).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Detailed nonclinical data have been submitted in support of this application for E/C/F/TAF, including 
study reports for each of the individual components EVG, COBI, FTC and TAF.  Combination studies are 
also provided for the EVG/COBI combination, FTC/TDF combination and the E/C/F/TAF combination.  
Nonclinical virology studies of EVG, COBI, FTC and TFV/TAF/TDF were also provided. 
The pharmacodynamics of TAF has been reviewed in both in-vitro and ex-vivo studies, demonstrating 
its uptake into PBMCs, conversion to tenofovir and metabolism to its active form of tenofovir 
disphosphate (TFV-DP). TAF has demonstrated anti-HIV activity in studies using lymphoid T-cells, 
primary human PBMCs, and macrophages. There would be limited impact of substituting TAF for TDF in 
the combination product based on studies examining cytotoxicity, off target toxicity, changes in 
mitochondrial function or of metabolism toxicity.  Safety pharmacology studies revealed no significant 
concerns for TAF over and above that already established for other components in the combination 
product.   
The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of EVG, COBI, FTC and TFV/TAF were evaluated 
in vitro and in a variety of animal models.  In addition, the drug-drug interaction profile was evaluated. 
The pharmacokinetics of the E/C/F/TAF FDC is discussed based on the results of nonclinical studies 
completed with the individual agents; no additional pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted for 
the E/C/F/TAF combination.   
The kidney and bone findings seen in the rat and dog toxicology studies are known toxicities of TFV. 
This has been adequately addressed in the product literature.  
Prolonged PR intervals (approximately 13% to 24%) with associated QT interval prolongation were 
noted in the 39-week dog study. No PR prolongation or any change in ECG results occurred in the 
safety pharmacology study that evaluated a TAF dose up to 100 mg/kg or in the clinical thorough QT 
study.  
At 18/12 mg/kg/day in dogs (39-week dog study), a minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in 
some organs (eye [choroid plexus, ciliary body], lung, and spleen) in some animals. The posterior 
uveitis seen at the high dose (18/12 mg/kg) corresponds to 9 and 40-fold the human recommended 
dose based on TAF and TFV AUC respectively. In-life ophthalmologic examinations were normal in this 
study. There were no test article-related effects on ophthalmic exams or microscopic exams of ocular 
tissue observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice (up to 13 weeks), rats (up to 26 weeks), 
nonhuman primates (4 weeks, or in the 4-week dog toxicology study. Although clinical data do not 
identify any cases of posterior uveitis, these data are limited and a potential clinical risk for ocular 
effects is reflected in the RMP.  
Adverse degenerative (olfactory) and acute inflammatory (infiltrate neutrophil) changes in the nasal 
mucosa were noted in mice given TAF for 13 weeks. Given that these findings were not seen in any 
other species or in rats for longer durations of administration it can be agreed that they probably do 
not pose a clinical risk. 
In the rat fertility and reproductive toxicology study an increase in absolute testis weight (significant 
increase [9%] in the adjusted mean of the left testis only) was seen at 160 mg/kg/day. This was 
considered by the applicant to be test article-related but not adverse, as there were no other 
reproductive organ weight or functional reproductive effects. Sternebrae variants (1 to 4 and 5 and 6) 
were increased at 250 mg/kg/day in the rat embryo-fetal development study (the NOEL was

considered to be 100 mg/kg/day [84 mg/kg/day achieved]). There were no effects seen the embryo-
foetal development study in rabbits. 
The product information states that both sexes should use contraception and female patients of 
childbearing potential should use either a hormonal contraceptive containing at least 30 μg 
ethinyloestradiol and containing norgestimate as the progestagen or should use an alternative reliable 
method of contraception. The effect of co-administration of the combination with oral contraceptives 
containing progestagens other than norgestimate is not known and, therefore, should be avoided. This 
is considered acceptable. 
As has been demonstrated for other products containing EVG and COBI, EVG has been shown to be 
persistent in soil, although has demonstrated low toxicity to terrestrial and sediment dwelling species, 
and should not pose a risk to the environment.  COBI does not bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms, 
and given the low toxicity of COBI to aquatic organisms, there should be no significant risk to the 
environment.  FTC does not bioaccumulate and is of low risk to the aquatic or terrestrial environments. 
TAF is a next generation pro-drug of tenofovir (TFV) and TFV has been shown to have low toxicity to 
aquatic organisms, no bioaccumulation and should pose no significant risk to the environment.   
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No major concerns have been identified from the nonclinical data. The applicant has submitted data to 
characterise TAF, which showed a similar toxicity profile to TDF which is overall qualitatively similar 
than TDF since mainly characterized by kidney (karyomegaly, tubular degeneration), bone. These 
correlate with the known clinical toxicities of TDF. Safety margins are higher for TAF in comparison to 
TDF. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
E/C/F/TAF is essentially Stribild (STB) in which TDF is substituted with tenofovir alafenamide [TAF; GS-
7340]) that allows for ingestion of a very much lower oral dose compared to TD (10 mg vs. 245 mg). 
TAF is presented for clinical use as the fumarate (11 mg GS-7340-03 vs. 300 mg TDF in STB) but all 
doses reported below refer to the TAF content of the various formulations. The focus of the evaluation 
is on the following studies conducted with TAF alone or in FDCs with other agents in healthy subjects 
and HIV-infected patients:

GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Two forms of TAF were used during clinical development: 
• 
• 
TAF monofumarate (GS-7340-02) with 1:1 ratio of GS-7340 to fumarate  
TAF fumarate (GS-7340-03), which is the hemifumarate form, with a 2:1 ratio of GS-7340 to 
fumarate 
TAF fumarate (GS-7340-03) was selected for Phase 2/3 studies and the commercial presentation. 
The validated bioanalytical methods for TAF in human plasma and urine involved protein precipitation 
extraction of TAF and its internal standard (TAF-d7) followed by LC MS/MS with positive ionization. The 
linear ranges were 1 to 1000 ng/mL in plasma and 2-1000 ng/mL in urine. 
Absorption  
GS-US-292-0101 was an open-label crossover study that compared two formulations (monolayer and 
bilayer) of E/C/F/TAF (each containing either 25 or 40 mg TAF as the monofumarate) with Stribild and 
with TAF 25 mg alone. Healthy subjects were assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts and randomised to 1 of 4 
treatment sequences within each cohort as follows.  
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 74/159  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cohort 1 (10 M and 10 F) received: 
•  A: STR Formulation 1 containing 150 mg EVG/150 mg COBI/200 mg FTC/25 mg TAF 
•  B: STR Formulation 1 containing 150 mg EVG/150 mg COBI/200 mg FTC/40 mg TAF 
•  C: Stribild 
•  D: 25 mg TAF 
Cohort 2 (10 M and 10 F) received: 
• 
• 
E: STR Formulation 2 containing 150 mg EVG/150 mg COBI/200 mg FTC/25 mg TAF 
F: STR Formulation 2 containing 150 mg EVG/150 mg COBI/200 mg FTC/40 mg TAF 
•  C and D as above 
Each treatment was administered with food for 12 days with 2-day washout periods between 
treatments.  
Following administration of E/C/F/TAF 25 mg as Formulations 1 and 2 the exposures to TAF and TFV 
were substantially higher vs. TAF 25 mg administered alone. TAF AUClast and Cmax were ~2.2 and 2.3-
fold higher, respectively, while TFV AUCtau and Cmax were ~3.1 and 3.7-fold higher, respectively.

Table 25.  GS-US-292-0101: Statistical Comparison of TFV Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Test 
Versus Reference Treatments (Analysis Set: Tenofovir PK) 
TFV plasma exposures were lower following administration of FDC Formulations 1 and 2 (25 and 40 
mg) and TAF alone compared to Stribild. Mean TFV exposures (AUCtau and Cmax) following TAF alone 
were ~90% lower compared with those achieved after Stribild. 
TAF and TFV exposures after STRs containing 25 or 40 mg TAF were generally dose-proportional. 
A comparable increase in TAF and TFV exposures was observed in GS-US-311-0101 (see below) when 
TAF (8 mg) was given with and without COBI (150 mg) such that the TAF AUClast and Cmax were ~2.7 
and 2.8 fold higher, respectively, while TFV AUCtau and Cmax were both ~3.3-fold higher. On this basis 
it was considered that the difference in exposures between Formulations 1 and 2 vs. TAF alone was 
COBI-mediated, likely due to inhibition of P-glycoprotein–mediated intestinal secretion of TAF. 
On comparing STR Formulations 1 and 2 containing TAF 25 mg or 40 mg with Stribild the GMRs and 
90% CIs for AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau of EVG, COBI and FTC were contained within the protocol-defined 
lack of interaction boundary of 70% to 143%. The stricter 80% to 125% boundary criterion for 
bioequivalence was also met for EVG, COBI and FTC exposures. The actual exposures of EVG, COBI 
and FTC were consistent with historical data from previous studies.

GS-US-292-0103 – Study Title:  A Phase 1, Multiple Dose Study Evaluating the Relative 
Bioavailability of Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/ GS-7340 STR Relative to the Administration of 
Individual Components Cobicistat-Boosted Elvitegravir, Emtricitabine, and GS-7340 
GS-US-292-0103 was an open-label crossover study in similar numbers of healthy male and female 
subjects aged 18 to 45 years per Cohort. 
Cohort 1 assessed the effects of the STR on EVG and COBI and subjects received in randomised order: 
•  A: STR containing EVG 150 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 10 mg 
•  B: EVG 150 mg + COBI 150 mg 
Cohort 2 assessed the effects of the STR on FTC and TAF and subjects received in randomised order: 
•  A: as above 
•  C: FTC 200 mg + TAF 25 mg 
Each treatment was administered once daily with food for 12 days with no washout periods. 
There were 34 healthy subjects enrolled (Cohort 1-14; Cohort 2-20) with median ages of 26 years and 
36 years, respectively, and overall mean eGFRCG at baseline of 126.9 mL/min. 
The TAF and TFV exposures following administration of the 10 mg TAF as a constituent of the STR were 
comparable to those observed following administration of TAF 25 mg co-administered with FTC. The 
result confirmed the 2 to 3-fold increase in exposures observed when TAF was dosed with COBI. 
Specifically, the 90% CIs around the GLSM ratios for TAF and TFV exposures relative to FTC + TAF 25 
mg were within 70% to 143%.  
The mean (%CV) TFV AUC and Cmax after multiple doses were > 90% lower than previously observed 
following administration of Stribild in GS-US-236-0110.

The data supported the selection of 10 mg TAF in the STR for further clinical development. 
Following the administration of E/C/F/TAF 10 mg, the GLSM ratios and 90% CIs for EVG, COBI, and 
FTC were all contained within the protocol-defined 70% to 143% lack-of-effect boundary relative to 
EVG + COBI or FTC + TAF 25 mg, indicating no clinically relevant differences. The stricter 80% to 
125% boundary was also met for the relevant EVG, COBI, and FTC exposure parameters, consistent 
with previous findings from GS-US-292-0101.

•  A light/low-fat meal of approximately 400 kcal and 20% fat 
•  A high-calorie/high-fat meal of approximately 800 kcal and 50% fat 
Administration of E/C/F/TAF under fed conditions resulted in a lower TAF Cmax and delayed Tmax with a 
magnitude of effect that was similar between meal types. In contrast the GLSM ratios and 90% CI for 
TAF AUClast after each meal type all exceeded 100% and the upper 90% boundaries were 124% and 
126%.

Distribution 
In the TAF metabolite profiling study GS-US-120-0109 (see below) the mean whole blood-to-plasma

dose suggesting slower clearance of radioactivity from blood cells relative to plasma. Radioactivity was 
not detectable in blood for 6/8 subjects at 504 h post-dose and the others had low radioactivity close 
to the LLOQ. 
In AD-120-2026 the in-vitro binding of TAF to human plasma proteins was evaluated using equilibrium 
dialysis conducted over 3 h at 37°C. Human plasma was spiked with TAF at a final concentration of 2 
µM and LC/MS/MS was used with LLOQ 0.3 nM. The free fraction in human plasma was similar to that 
in dogs. 
However, in several human ex vivo studies it seems that the estimated unbound fraction was ~20%, 
i.e. lower than reported above (e.g. see the control groups in the renal and hepatic impairment 
studies). 
Based on POPPK analyses for each of TAF and TFV (see section 2.1.8): 
• 
• 
• 
For TAF the apparent volume of the central compartment (Vc/F) was 10.3 L and the apparent 
volume of peripheral compartment (Vp/F) was 447 L.  
For TFV the Vc/F was 1600 L and the Vp/F was 1670 L.  
TFV Vc/F and Vp/F were lower in moderate renal impairment and higher in those with supra-
normal eGFR compared to normals. Both were also lower in in healthy subjects vs. HIV-
infected patients.

Metabolism 
In the TAF metabolite profiling study GS-US-120-0109 healthy male volunteers (median eGFRCG 117.5 
mL/min; range 87.7 to 198.2 mL/min) received a single TAF 25 mg capsule containing 24.15 mg TAF 
plus 100 μCi [0.85 mg] radiolabeled [14C]TAF. Dosing was with water within 5 minutes of completing 
a standardised breakfast.  
Quantifiable levels of [14C] radioactivity were observed in whole blood for up to 360 h post-dose in 
most subjects but radioactivity was undetectable in plasma after 192 h post-dose.  
Quantifiable levels of TAF were observed in plasma for up to 6 h post-dose and then remained BLQ. 
TAF was extensively metabolised with only 1.41% (± 0.561%) of the total radioactive dose appearing 
in urine as TAF and no radioactive TAF was detected in faeces.

Metabolite profiling (pooled samples) showed two concentration peaks in the plasma [14C]radioactivity 
profile:  
•  At the first maximal plasma radioactivity concentration around 2 h post-dose the predominant 
species was TAF, accounting for 72.6% of the total [14C]radioactivity quantified.  
•  At the second maximal plasma radioactivity concentration around 24 to 48 h post-dose the 
predominant species was uric acid, accounting for 97.6% of the total [14C]radioactivity 
quantified.  
Over 96 h post-dose the predominant species circulating in plasma was uric acid, which accounted for 
73.9% of the total [14C]radioactivity AUC. The TAF and TFV AUCs represented 1.8% and 1.5% of the 
total [14C]radioactivity AUC, respectively. Low quantities of other metabolites were formed including 
xanthine, hypoxanthine and adenine (identical to the endogenous products of purine metabolism).

Figure 6.  GS-US-120-0109: Tentative Pathways for Metabolism of TAF by Humans 
Note: M12 = TFV. 
Note: Pathways are proposed based on general knowledge of metabolism and do not imply definitive pathways. Direct experimentation was not 
performed. 
Additional information comes from in-vitro studies that assessed the stability of TAF in plasma, 
intestinal S9 and hepatic S9 fractions from humans. TAF was moderately stable in human plasma and 
intestinal S9 with half-lives of 74.7 and 58.3 minutes, respectively. TAF stability in human intestinal S9 
fractions was also determined in the presence of HIV PIs resulting in a lower half-life of 24.5 minutes. 
TAF was relatively less stable in human hepatic S9 fractions with a half-life of 20.6 minutes. The 
predicted human hepatic extraction ratio was calculated to be 76.2%. 
Using bacterially expressed human CYP enzyme preparations (Bactosomes), co-expressed with human 
NADPH CYP reductase, metabolism of TAF was not detected by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or 
CYP 2D6. TAF was slowly metabolised by CYP3A4 (1.9 min-1), which was 26.6% of that for 
testosterone (7.2 min-1). 
Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
It was concluded that TAF is primarily hydrolysed by CatA in PBMCs. Cathepsin A is a ubiquitously 
expressed multifunctional enzyme with deamidase, esterase and carboxypeptidase activities and is 
encoded by the CTSA gene. Genetic polymorphisms have been described, some of which can result in 
depressed enzymic activity.  
In primary human hepatocytes it has been reported in the literature that CES1 is the major enzyme 
that converts TAF to TFV and that CatA makes a small contribution. Several CES1 genetic variants that 
are associated with enzyme activity have been identified at very low frequency (G143E [heterozygous: 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 86/159  
  
  
 
 
 
2%-4% and homozygous: 0.05%] and D260fs [very rare]). In a study of HBV-infected subjects all of 
the patients genotyped for the rs71647871 (G143E) variant of CES1 were found to carry the reference 
homozygous genotype (i.e. there were no carriers of the minor allele of this variant genotype). In 
addition, since TAF can be activated by both CES1 and CatA in liver, the genetic polymorphisms 
causing a marked effect on TAF activation are expected to be extremely rare. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
In studies in which a range of TAF doses were used, including the monotherapy studies and the TQT 
study that used 25 mg and 125 mg doses, there was very approximate dose proportionality for TAF 
and TFV. 
Time dependency 
In GS-US-120-0109 plasma radioactivity showed two peaks. There was a time-dependent profile with 
TAF as the most abundant species in the first few hours and uric acid predominating in the remaining 
period.  
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
• 
• 
The inter-subject variability in TAF plasma exposure varied across studies depending on 
whether intensive or sparse sampling was employed (% CV: 26% - 34% across Phase 1 
studies and 58% - 118% across Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies). 
The inter-subject variability in TFV plasma exposure was generally modest/low and comparable 
across studies (% CV: 18% - 41% across Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies). 
Inter-subject variability in intracellular concentrations of TFV-DP is greater than observed for parent 
drug in plasma. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
POPPK analyses were performed for TAF and TFV using PK data collected as shown in Table 34.

The analysis was conducted via nonlinear mixed-effects modelling with NONMEM 7.3.0 software. Due 
to expected differences in characteristic time scales of TAF and TFV concentrations (rapid elimination of 
TAF with no accumulation and much longer half-life of TFV leading to significant TFV accumulation) PK 
modelling was first performed separately for TAF and TFV. The final models for TAF and TFV were then 
combined into a joint model. 
For each of the separate models, the base model was first established followed by the development of 
the covariate model. One- and two compartment PK models with various oral absorption models were 
tried during base model development. Structural model refinement was based on various goodness-of-
fit indicators, including diagnostic plots, plausibility and precision of the parameter estimates, the 
minimum objective function value and the number of estimated parameters. 
Covariate modelling used a combination of the full model approach and backward elimination 
procedure. The covariates investigated were body size measures (weight, BSA or BMI), age, sex, race, 
creatinine clearance at baseline and population (healthy subjects, ARV-naive and ARV-experienced 
patients). Influence of identified covariates on exposure and a degree to which the covariate explained 
variability of exposure was determined by comparing 90% prediction intervals of estimated individual 
steady-state exposure parameters in the data set with the corresponding parameters computed from 
the models for typical subjects, where values of one covariate were altered from its reference value. 
For continuous covariates, 5th and 95th percentiles of the values in the data set were used; for 
categorical covariates, levels other than reference were used in computations. 
The available data for analysis are summarised in Table 35.

Visual predictive check simulations for the final models, for all data and stratified by covariates,

TAF pharmacokinetics 
The two-compartment population PK model with absorption lag time and sequential zero- and first-
order absorption described TAF concentrations. Extensive covariate analyses did not identify any 
covariates that had a statistically significant influence on TAF PK, and no covariates were retained in 
the final model.  
The predicted steady-state AUC and Cmax for a typical subject were 188.1 ng/mL*h and 165.6 ng/mL, 
respectively. The mean (95% CI; % CV) predicted steady-state AUC and Cmax in the pivotal studies 
(GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111) were 206.4 (55.6 - 526.1; 71.8%) ng/mL*h and 162.2 (46.5 
– 340; 51.1%) ng/mL, respectively. Elimination of TAF was rapid, and plasma concentrations were not 
detectable by 8 hours post dose in most patients. Tables 36 and 37 show predicted Cmax and AUC by 
covariates.

The predicted steady-state AUC, Cmax, and Cmin values for a typical reference subject (not Black, male, 
HIV patient, CrCL=100 mL/min) were 331.2 ng/mL*h, 16.9 ng/mL, and 12.1 ng/mL for AUC, Cmax, and 
Cmin respectively. Corresponding mean (95% CI; % CV) predicted individual steady-state parameters 
in the pivotal studies were 292.6 ng/mL*h (179.8 - 445.7 ng/mL*h; 27.4%), 15.2 ng/mL (9.3 - 23.1 
ng/mL; 26.1%) and 10.6 ng/mL (6.4 -16.6 ng/mL; 28.5%).

• 
• 
For those with CrCL 50 mL/min, apparent clearance (CLM/F), apparent central volume (VcM/F) 
and apparent peripheral volume (VpM/F) were respectively 44%, 44% and 65% lower vs. 
reference subjects. 
For those with CrCL 150 L/min the respective values were 40%, 40% and 85% higher vs. 
reference subjects.  
•  Differences in eGFR explained the main part of variability in AUC, Cmax and Cmin. These 
parameters were 73-78% higher in subjects with CrCL 50 mL/min (5th percentile of eGFR 
values in the analysis population) compared to 100 mL/min and they were 28-29% lower in 
subjects with CrCL of 150 mL/min (95th percentile of eGFR values in the analysis population) 
compared to 100 mL/min. 
In addition: 
•  CLM/F was 11% lower in females and 12% higher in Blacks  
•  VcM/F and VpM/F were 67% and 36% lower in healthy subjects compared to HIV patients 
Of the other covariates, only being healthy contributed to explaining variability in Cmax, with 29% 
higher Cmax in healthy subjects. Apparent central and peripheral volumes of distributions were 
respectively 67% (95% CI: 61-74%) and 36% (95% CI: 26 - 46%) lower in healthy subjects 
compared to HIV patients. 
The effects of the rest of the covariates on AUC, Cmax and Cmin were minor (respectively 13%, 10.6%, 
and 14.7% higher in females; 10.7%, 8.7%, and 12.1% lower in Blacks; 12% lower Cmin in healthy 
subjects). 
Differences in TFV exposure between subjects due to statistically significant covariates were less than 
2-fold. Since the systemic TFV exposure following E/C/F/TAF STR is approximately 90% lower 
compared to E/C/F/TDF regimen, these differences were not considered clinically meaningful. 
Intensive PK sub-study data  
The Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in the ART-naïve included intensive PK sub-studies that reported the 
TAF and TFV plasma concentrations. Thus, the data provide a direct comparison of plasma TFV levels 
between E/C/F/TAF and STB in HIV-infected patients rather than an historical comparison. The Phase 3 
studies GS-US-292-0104 and 0111 showed that TFV plasma AUCtau after TAF was 10.4% and 7.5% of 
the value observed after TDF, consistent with TAF 25 mg vs. TDF 300 mg given alone in GS-US-120-
0104.

The data also demonstrated that the intracellular TFV-DP AUCtau was higher with TAF although there 
was clearly considerable variability (study 0104: 7.13 µmol.h/L vs. STB 2.11 µmol.h/L; study 0111: 
21.02 µmol.h/L vs. STB 7.76 µmol.h/L). 
The Phase 2 study GS-US-292-0102 reported similar differences for TFV between E/C/F/TAF and STB. 
This study also reported EVG, COBI and FTC plasma levels but only from the E/C/F/TAF group. 
Therefore the comparison was made with other E/C/F/TAF studies and with historical data for STB.

Table 44.  Pharmacokinetic Parameters for TAF and TFV after a Single Dose of TAF 25 mg in Subjects 
with Severe Renal Impairment or Normal Renal Function 
TAF - In severe renal impairment there was a 92% (< 2-fold) higher mean plasma AUCinf, 92% higher 
AUClast and 79% higher Cmax. Correspondingly the mean plasma TAF CL/F was lower (61,717.8 mL/h 
vs. 117,633.1 mL/h, respectively, p = 0.003) but the half-life was not statistically significantly 
different. At 1 and 4 h the mean percent unbound TAF was not different between those with severe 
renal impairment (20.0% and 14.2%) vs. controls (20.1% and 13.6%). Approximately 0.117 mg TAF 
(0.47% of the dose) was excreted in urine in renally impaired subjects vs. ~0.500 mg (2.00%) in 
controls with renal clearance of 4.2 mL/min and 35.8 mL/min, respectively (but renal clearance is not a 
relevant pathway for TAF elimination). 
TFV – In severe renal impairment there was much higher (about 5-6-fold) plasma exposure to TFV vs. 
controls with lower plasma and renal clearance but no significant difference in half-life. TFV plasma 
protein binding at 2 and 24 h was not different between groups (e.g. 99.2% vs. 98.9% at 24 h). 
Approximately 30% vs. 24% of the dose was excreted in urine. 
The plasma TFV exposures (mean TFV AUCinf 2073.8 ng•h/mL vs. 342.6 ng•h/mL for controls) were 
within or below the TFV exposure ranges of subjects with normal renal function taking TDF 300 mg 
once daily.

Moderate Renal Impairment 
Details of the design of this open-label study in HIV-infected patients with eGFRCG 30-69 mL/min are 
provided in the efficacy and safety sections. There was an intensive PK/PD sub-study and sparse 
sampling. TAF PK parameters were consistent with data obtained from HIV-infected patients with 
normal renal function in other Phase 2/3 studies (mean AUClast 227.5 ng*h/mL, 229.8 ng*h/mL and 
259.0 ng*h/mL) and in healthy subjects (AUClast 244.8 ng*h/mL). Exposure to TAF was numerically 
higher in those with baseline eGFR < 50 vs. ≥50 mL/min but lower than the mean AUClast of 510.6 
ng*h/mL in subjects with eGFRCG 15 to 29 mL/min observed in GS-US-120-0108 (see Table 45).

a One subject was excluded for sensitivity analysis as TAF PK parameter estimates are unreliable due to an unusual PK profile 
TFV PK was higher when eGFRCG was 30 to 69 mL/min compared to HIV-infected patients in Phase 2/3 
studies (mean TFV AUCtau 326.2, 311.8 and 286.2 ng*h/mL) but lower than that observed in those 
with eGFRCG 15-29 mL/min in GS-US-120-0108 (mean AUCinf 2073.8 ng*h/mL) and lower than 
observed with TDF-containing regimens in patients with normal renal function. Exposure to TFV was 
higher in the subgroup with eGFRCG < 50 vs. those with values ≥ 50 mL/min but was still <30% of 
plasma levels observed with TDF.

eGFRCG (< 50 or ≥ 50 mL/min) in Cohort 1 (PK Substudy Analysis Set) 
EVG and COBI - The EVG and COBI PK parameters were in the range of data following administration 
of E/C/F/TAF in the Phase 2 study (mean EVG AUCtau 22,797.0 ng*h/mL; mean COBI AUCtau 9459.1 
ng*h/mL. Exposures were comparable across eGFR groups and consistent with non-renal elimination 
pathways. 
FTC - FTC plasma levels were higher in those with screening eGFRCG 30 to 69 mL/min compared to the 
Phase 2 study patients (mean AUCtau 20,968 ng*h/mL vs. 11,714.1 ng*h/mL).

with the FTC PK parameters observed in subjects with mild (CrCL = 50 to 80 mL/min) or moderate 
renal impairment (CrCL = 30 to 49 mL/min).

The AUC reported for the 29 patients with data (~21,000 ng*h/mL) was similar to that in adults with 
mild renal impairment not requiring dose adjustment (mean AUC 19,900 ng*h/mL). This comparison is 
based on the following data for Emtriva as per US Product Information (Table 49 is reproduced from

At 1 and 4 h post-dose the mean unbound TAF ranged from 16% to 19% in mild hepatic impairment 
and from 14% to 23% in moderate hepatic impairment. At 2 and 24 h post-dose the mean unbound 
TFV was > 99% in mild or moderate hepatic impairment. For TAF and TFV binding was similar to

Elderly 
The POPPK analysis did not detect an effect of increasing age on PK within the limits of the database 
(i.e. with 80 treated aged > 65 years).  
Children 
The data for TAF come from 24 adolescents enrolled into GS-US-292-0106, which suggested no 
difference between ART-naïve adolescents and adults (data from GS-US-292-0102) for TAF or TFV. The 
POPPK predicted values were also comparable between adolescents and adults for TAF and TFV. The 
COBI exposures were lower in adolescents vs. adults in studies 0102 and 0103 (based on ratio and 
90% CI within 80, 125%) but the EVG Cmax and AUC were comparable and only the EVG Ctrough was 
lower (69.3; CI 52.8, 91). FTC exposures were also comparable between age groups.

Race 
The  POPPK  analysis  did  not  detect  an  effect  of  racial  group  on  TAF  PK.  There  was  a  statistically 
significant effect of race on TFV PK but the range of exposures was comparable and >80% lower than 
observed with STB so that the difference was not considered to be clinically relevant. 
In  GS-US-292-0108 single  and  multiple  QD  dosing  with  E/C/F/TAF  (10  mg)  was  compared  between 
healthy Japanese (10) and Caucasian (10) subjects. After multiple dosing: 
• 
• 
• 
The AUCs of each analyte were lower in Japanese vs. Caucasian subjects.  
The Cmax values were more variable but were lower in Japanese subjects for EVG and COBI. 
The Ctau values for EVG, COBI, FTC and TFV were all lower in Japanese subjects.  
The lower bounds of the 90% CI were well below 80% for: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
EVG and COBI Cmax, AUCtau and Ctau. 
FTC AUCtau and Ctau. 
TAF AUClast.

Nevertheless,  the  differences  observed  are  not  expected  to  affect  the  overall  antiviral  effect  of  the 
FDC.

Cytochrome P450 inhibition 
•  Using human liver microsomal CYP isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6 and CYP3A) TAF IC50 values were > 25 µM except that TAF showed weak inhibition of 
CYP3A-mediated  oxidation  of  midazolam  or  testosterone  with  IC50  values  of  7.6  or  7.4  µM, 
respectively. 
•  TAF was not a mechanism-based inhibitor of human CYP enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9,  CYP2C19  and  CYP2D6  50  µM.  The  maximum  change  in  activity  was  17.4%  with 
CYP2C8. 
•  TFV at 100 μM did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A.

Due to cytotoxicity cell viability was significantly affected at 100 µM TAF and mixed responses to TAF 
with increased mRNA levels and reduced CYP activities were observed. At 1 and 10 µM TAF there were 
no significant increases in mRNA levels or CYP activities. At 10 µM TAF the mRNA levels of CYP1A2 and 
CYP3A4 increased by 3.0- and 8.3-fold, or 3% and 6% of the induction with positive controls.  
UGT1A1 inhibition 
TAF  was  assessed  for  inhibition  of  oestradiol  3-glucuronide  formation  in  insect  cell  microsomal 
fractions containing baculovirus-expressed human UGT1A1. TAF did not inhibit UGT1A1 up to 50 µM. 
UGT1A1 and P-gp induction 
There was no significant induction of P-gp and UGT1A1 mRNA by TAF (less than 2-fold increases).  
Other transporter studies 
TAF 
TAF  showed  little  or  no  inhibition  of  the  transport  of  model  substrates  by  P-gp,  BCRP,  OAT1, 
OAT3 and OCT2. Weak inhibition of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BSEP, OCT1 and MATE1 was observed 
but  none  was  inhibited  by  50%  at  100  µM  TAF,  which  is  approximately  200-fold  Cmax  in 
plasma. 
TAF  is  a  substrate  for  the  intestinal  efflux  transporters  P-gp  and  BCRP.  An  increase  in  TAF 
absorption  was  observed  in  the  presence  of  efflux  transport  inhibitors  CsA  or  COBI.  The 
applicant  has  started  that  co-administration  of  TAF  with  efflux  inhibitors  may  potentiate 
antiviral efficacy by increasing TFV-DP levels in PBMCs.  
TAF  is  also  a  substrate  for  hepatic  uptake  transporters  OATP1B1  and  OATP1B3.  Exposure  to 
TAF  may  be  affected  by  inhibitors  of  these  transporters  or  genetic  polymorphisms  that  affect 
transport activities.  
TAF was not a substrate for renal transporters OAT1 and OAT3 or for OCT1. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TFV 
The active tubular secretion of TFV is mediated by human OAT1 (basolateral uptake) and MRP4 (apical 
efflux) transporters acting in series in proximal tubules. Human OAT3 may play a secondary role in the 
tubular uptake of TFV.  
OAT1  has  been  assessed  for  its  potential  role  in  drug  interactions  between  TFV  and  other  renally 
secreted  agents.  Under  physiologically  relevant  conditions,  none  of  the  tested  drugs  affected  OAT1-
mediated transport of TFV. 
MRP1 is not involved in reabsorption of TFV at the basolateral membrane of proximal tubule cells. 
Neither P-gp nor MRP2 appear to be involved in the tubular efflux of TFV. 
TFV did not inhibit the activity of human OCT2 or MATE1 (IC50 > 300 μM). 
Other relevant information 
• 
• 
There is no evidence for inhibition of TFV renal excretion by FTC, EVG or COBI.   
Transport of TFV by OAT1, OAT and MRP4 was not meaningfully inhibited by COBI at clinically 
relevant concentrations. In addition, COBI had no effect on the accumulation of TFV in human 
renal tissue slices at clinically relevant concentrations. 
•  COBI is a weak to moderate inhibitor of OCT2, MATE2-K and OCTN1 while COBI and EVG are 
more potent inhibitors of MATE1 but TAF is not an inhibitor of any of these transporters. 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 100/159  
  
  
 
 
• 
Inhibition  of  BSEP  by  COBI  is  unlikely  to  be  clinically  meaningful  as  the  IC50  (6.5  μM)  is  in 
excess of the total plasma Cmax. 
•  COBI  is  a  weak  inhibitor  of  intestinal  efflux  transporters  but  high  concentrations  in  the 
intestinal lumen may inhibit P-gp and increase TAF exposure. In the presence of 90 μM COBI in 
the  Caco-2  bidirectional  permeability  assay  TAF  forward  permeability  increased  4.6-fold  and 
the efflux ratio significantly decreased, suggesting P-gp mediated drug interaction. 
•  COBI is a specific and potent inhibitor of CYP3A so that the weak inhibition effected by TAF is 
not expected to add to the DDI potential of the STR.  
• 
TFV and FTC do not inhibit each other's pharmacological activation through phosphorylation. 
Activation of human AhR or human PXR 
•  At 50 µM TAF the extent of activation of PXR was only 23% of the maximal effect of rifampicin 
and  15  μM  TAF  demonstrated  activation  of  <  5%  of  the  maximal  induction  elicited  by 
rifampicin.  
•  TAF did not activate AhR up to 50 µM, the highest concentration tested.

Treatments were as follows:  
In  Cohort  1  FTC/TAF  (40  mg)  plus  EFV  resulted  in  no  clinically  relevant  changes  in  FTC,  TFV  or  TAF 
AUCs compared with FTC/TAF (40 mg) dosed alone based on the pre-defined acceptance criteria.

The TAF and TFV Cmax values were lower on co-administration but the differences were not considered 
to be clinically meaningful. EFV exposures were comparable to historical data. 
In  Cohorts 2 and 3 co-administration of FTC/TAF (25 mg) with DRV/co (800/150 mg) for 10-12 days 
resulted in comparable exposures to TAF and FTC but substantially higher TFV exposures vs. FTC/TAF 
(25 mg) dosed alone in Cohort 2.  
• 
• 
TAF  AUClast  and  Cmax  increased  following  co-administration  of  single  doses,  suggesting  an 
inhibitory  drug  interaction  resulting  in  increased  availability  of  TAF  that  abated  following 
multiple dosing.  
The  increase  in  TFV  but  not  TAF  exposures  after  multiple-dose  co-administration  was 
considered  to  be  due  to  a  mixed  inhibitory/inductive  effect  of  COBI  on  P-gp,  influencing  TAF 
absorption.  
•  COBI  and  FTC  exposures  were  consistent  with  historical  data  (e.g.  GS-US-236-0101  and 
0110). 
• 
There was no effect of co-administration with FTC/TAF on DRV PK. 
In  Cohort  4  co-administration  of  TAF  8  mg  plus  COBI  150  mg  gave  substantially  higher  TAF  and  TFV 
exposures vs. TAF 8 mg dosed alone. COBI exposures were in the range of historical data. The effect 
was ascribed to COBI-mediated inhibition of P-gp-mediated intestinal secretion of TAF. 
Pharmacokinetic  results  for  the  primary  exposure  parameters  of  GS-7340,  TFV,  COBI,  FTC,  and  DRV

GS-US-292-1316 – E/C/F/TAF with Sertraline [SER] 
Co-administration of E/C/F/TAF (10 mg) with SER was evaluated because SER is eliminated by 
CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 with percentage contributions estimated to be ~35%, 
29%, 14%, 13% and 9%, respectively. COBI is an inhibitor of CYP3A (major) and CYP2D6 (minor).  
Based on the pre-defined acceptance criteria co-administration had no clinically relevant effect on the 
PK of EVG, COBI, FTC, TAF, TFV or SER. Exposures to all analytes were consistent with historical data. 
All except two comparisons gave 90% CI that fell within 80, 125% and in the two exceptions (COBI 
Ctau and SER AUC0-∞) the lower boundary was only just below 80%. 
GS-US-342-1167 – E/C/F/TAF with Sofosbuvir [SOF] and GS-5816  
GS-5816 is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A which is being developed for use with SOF 400 mg daily. Cohorts 
2, 3 and 4 were dosed within 5 minutes of completing breakfast (~ 600 kcal, 25-30% fat) with 4-day 
washouts.

J: SOF/GS-5816 once daily for 8 days; K: E/C/F/TAF once daily for 8 days 
Treatment L: SOF/GS-5816 plus E/C/F/TAF once daily for 8 days 
Co-administration of SOF/GS-5816 with E/C/F/TAF resulted in an increase in SOF, GS-331007 and GS-
5816 exposures, which were attributed to COBI.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The increase in SOF exposure was attributed to inhibition of drug transporters (e.g. P-gp) by 
COBI.  
The relative increase in GS-331007 exposure was similar to that observed when ledipasvir 
(LDV)/SOF was administered with EVG/COBI and does not require SOF dose adjustment.  
The ~50% increase in GS-5816 exposure was attributed to inhibition of drug transporters (e.g. 
P-gp) and CYP enzymes by COBI. 
Exposures to EVG and FTC were not altered following co-administration with SOF/GS-5816.  
There was ~100% increase in COBI Ctau when E/C/F/TAF was given with SOF/GS-5816. Due 
to the relatively short COBI t1/2 (~3.5 h) there was no impact on AUC COBI. 
TFV was unchanged when E/C/F/TAF was given with SOF/GS-5816. GS-5816 inhibits P-gp but 
there was no effect of co-administration on TAF (P-gp substrate) or TFV since COBI already 
effected P-gp inhibition. 
It was concluded that SOF/GS-5816 may be administered with E/C/F/TAF without dose adjustment. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
TAF is predominantly hydrolysed to TFV by Cathepsin A (CatA) cleavage in target lymphoid cells. TFV 
(a monophosphate; i.e. nucleotide analogue) is then metabolised to TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP, i.e. a 
triphosphate molecule), which is a competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 RT. In HIV-infected T-cells, 
macrophages and PBMCs TAF EC50 values ranged from 3 to 14 nM. The in-vitro activity of TAF against 
HIV-1 is 100- to 600-fold greater than TFV and 4- to 6-fold greater than TDF.  
In primary CD4+ T lymphocytes and MDMs isolated from PBMCs from 13 donors the levels of active 
CatA were comparable across donors and the mean rate of TFV-alanine formation was similar between 
quiescent and activated CD4+T cells (2.7 vs. 3.0 pmol/min•μg) with ≤  3-fold differences between 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 104/159  
  
  
 
 
 
donors. In both primary cell types, the intracellular accumulation of TAF metabolites and conversion of 
TAF to TFV-DP were consistent across the 8 demographically diverse donors. 
Certain viral PIs are inhibitors of CatA. Up to a concentration of 50 μM, which is well above the clinical 
Cmax of each of DRV, ATV, LPV, RTV and COBI, there was no significant inhibition of the CatA-
mediated hydrolysis of TAF. In contrast, telaprevir and boceprevir (irreversible inhibitors) inhibited 
CatA-mediated hydrolysis of TAF with IC50 values of 0.3 and 0.2 μM, respectively, and use with 
E/C/F/TAF is not recommended. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
TAF monotherapy 
GS-120-1101 was an early study (2003) that compared the antiviral activity of TAF (50 mg and 150 
mg QD as the monofumarate) vs. TDF during 14 days monotherapy in 30 ART-naïve patients (27 
male) with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 15,000 copies/mL and CD4 cell count ≥ 200 cells/mm3 at screening. 
All dosing used a 2 h pre- and post-dose fasting window. TAF appeared rapidly in plasma but had a 
half-life of 20 to 40 minutes. Repeat dosing showed a longer elimination half-life and greater TFV 
accumulation in the TAF groups. TFV was detectable within PBMCs earlier, more consistently, and at 
greater concentrations after TAF vs. TDF. 
DAVG1, 2 and 3 were significantly greater in the TAF vs. TDF groups but there was no significant 
difference between the TAF doses. No resistance mutations to TAF or TDF were detected in any groups 
and there was no consistent effect on CD4 counts although there was an increase in each group.

GS-US-120-0104 compared TAF monotherapy (8, 25 or 40 mg) to TDF and placebo over 10 days 
with all dosing once daily in the fasting state based on DAVG11. HIV-1 infected patients with HIV-1 
RNA > 2000 copies/mL, CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3 and without use of ARV within 90 days were 
eligible. TAF was rapidly absorbed with a short plasma t½ of ~0.40 hours and no evidence of 
accumulation on multiple dosing. TFV plasma concentrations were substantially higher when it was 
given as TDF 300 mg. At steady state, the mean TFV AUCtau after TAF doses were 97%, 86% and 
79% lower, respectively, vs. the mean after TDF dosing while Cmax was 98%, 94% and 89% lower, 
respectively.

The PBMC TFV-DP concentrations were highly variable across dose groups and time points. However, 
the mean AUCtau was similar between TAF 8 mg and TDF 300 mg and was ~ 7-fold and ~ 25-fold 
higher after 25 mg and 40 mg doses of TAF, respectively. After the last dose 3/6 TAF patients still had 
detectable TFV-DP on day 21 compared to 1/4 TDF patients studied. The antiviral effect of TAF 8 mg 
was similar to that of TDF 300 mg. There were statistically greater decreases in viral load with 25 mg 
and 40 mg TAF vs. TDF 300 mg and first phase decay slopes for plasma HIV-1 RNA were significantly 
steeper with TAF.

Resistance studies 
Since TAF is a pro-drug of TFV it is affected by the same resistance associated mutations (RAMs). In-
vitro studies indicated that TAF and TFV have similar propensities to select for mutational resistance 
and that EC50 values are affected to a similar extent by various mutations and combinations of 
mutations (in terms of fold differences vs. wild-type viruses).  
Viral breakthrough experiments were conducted using known TDF-resistant HIV-1 isolates in MT-2 cells 
at a higher multiplicity of infection (MOI) compared to typical EC50 assays; the EC50 values for TAF and 
TFV were 0.02 and 5 µM, respectively. The cells were incubated in the presence of TAF or TFV (at the 
EC95) followed by HIV-1 infection. After 4 or 5 days of incubation cultures were scored for viral 
breakthrough (i.e., CPE) and the procedure was repeated every 4 to 5 days for up to 4 weeks. 
Physiologically relevant concentrations of TAF inhibited viral breakthrough for the duration of the 
experiment for 9/11 viruses but viral breakthrough was only inhibited for 2/11 viruses in the presence 
of TFV. However, breakthrough of viruses with 5 TAMs was not prevented by TAF or TFV. 
Secondary pharmacology 
GS-US-120-0107 was a TQT study using single doses of 25 mg and 125 mg TAF taken within 5 
minutes of consuming a standard breakfast. Pharmacokinetic parameters for TAF and TFV following 
single oral doses of 25 or 125 mg TAF were approximately proportional to dose. The lower bound of 
the 2-sided 90% CI for the mean difference between moxifloxacin and placebo was greater than 5 ms 
at 2 post-dose time points (3 and 4 h) establishing assay sensitivity. For the primary analysis, TAF was 
concluded to have no QTcF prolongation effect as the upper bounds of the 2-sided 90% CIs for the 
mean difference between 25 mg and 125 mg TAF and placebo were below 10 ms at each time point 
after dosing. Small negative changes in QTcF were observed at both doses.

No-one had a treatment-emergent absolute QTc interval > 500 ms or a change from pre-dose baseline 
QTc > 60 ms with any correction factor. No subject had a treatment-emergent absolute QTc interval > 
480 ms or a change from pre-dose baseline > 30 ms following either dose of TAF. There was no 
consistent, pharmacologically meaningful association between time-matched, baseline-adjusted and 
placebo-corrected QTc and TAF or TFV plasma concentrations. There was a weak negative association 
between TFV plasma concentrations and QTcF that was maintained after adjustment for gender.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
In GS-US-120-0104 mean viral load declines for TAF 25 mg and 40 mg doses were statistically 
greater than for the 8 mg dose. The PK/PD relationships between TAF and TFV plasma exposures and 
antiviral activity were explored using a maximum (PD) effect (Emax) model, where Effect = (Emax • 
log 10 PK parameter)/(log 10 PK parameter 50 + log PK parameter). The TAF AUC fitted well with an 
Emax model, with an Emax of ~1.7 to 1.8 log 10 decline from baseline and the EC50 for AUC of ~32 
ng•h/mL. A similar fit/Emax estimate was obtained using TAF Cmax.  
Upon comparison of antiviral activity with 40 mg and previous data with 120 mg (GS-120-1101), TAF 
25 mg was expected to provide near-maximal activity. Plasma TFV AUC, which was substantially lower 
with TAF vs. TDF, did not correlate with antiviral activity. 
In Phase 3 studies in ART-naïve patients GS-US-292-0104 and 0111 the PK/PD analysis used 
available PK data and the primary efficacy endpoint (< 50 copies/mL at week 48; FDA snapshot 
algorithm). There were no trends in exposure-response relationship observed, which supported the

selection of TAF 10 mg for the E/C/F/TAF FDC based on equivalent exposure to unboosted TAF 25 mg, 
which was concluded to provide near maximal antiviral efficacy in the monotherapy study (see above). 
The results were also in accordance with the lack of statistically significant covariates on PK in the 
POPK analyses and the comparable efficacy observed across patient subgroups according to 
demographics. Evaluations of exposure-safety relationships in these two studies did not find an 
association between PK and diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, GI/abdominal pain, percentage change from 
baseline at Week 48 in BMD or maximum increase from baseline in serum creatinine. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
The cellular enzymes responsible for TFV phosphorylation are adenylate kinase (AK) and nucleotide 
diphosphate kinase, which are highly active and ubiquitous. Adenylate kinase exists as 2 isozymes, 
AK1 and AK2, and phosphorylation of TFV is mediated more efficiently by AK2. The effects of 
combination of TFV with other agents that require intracellular phosphorylation has been investigated 
in vitro. Combination with ABC did not change the rates of phosphorylation of either compound to the 
triphosphate (active) forms. 
The anti-HIV-1 activity of TAF in combination with a broad panel of representatives from the major 
classes of approved anti-HIV agents (N[t]RTIs, NNRTIs, INSTIs, and PIs) was evaluated in HIV-1IIIB 
infected MT-2 cells. Viral growth/inhibition was evaluated by measuring virus-induced CPE. The 
ddI+ribavirin (RBV), d4T+RBV and TAF+TAF combinations were controls for synergy, antagonism and 
addition, respectively. 
TAF exhibited moderate to high synergistic effects (synergy scores from 41 to 131) when combined 
with any of the N(t)RTIs or NNRTIs. The combination of TAF with INSTIs resulted in the highest level of 
synergy (synergy scores of 271, 205, and 179 for EVG, RAL and DTG, respectively. The combination of 
TAF with PIs resulted in moderate synergy (synergy scores of 96 and 56 for ATV and DRV, 
respectively). Combination of TAF with COBI resulted in an additive effect. The synergy values 
observed for TAF with all the drugs tested were comparable with those of TFV performed in parallel 
and to values previously reported for TFV. None of the drug combinations containing TAF exhibited 
antagonistic antiviral effects. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Selection of the formulation and dose of TAF 
Stribild is marketed as a bilayer tablet whereas the E/C/F/TAF FDC is a monolayer tablet. After daily 
dosing with food in GS-US-292-0101 both the mono- and bilayer formulations containing 25 mg TAF 
(monofumarate) gave TAF and TFV plasma concentrations that were substantially higher (2- to 3-fold 
increase in GS-7340 and TFV)  vs. 25 mg TAF given alone. In addition, both formulations containing 25 
mg TAF gave very much lower TFV plasma levels compared to STB along with comparable exposures 
to EVG, COBI and FTC. These results indicated that mono- and bilayer tablets performed similarly and 
supported the monolayer presentation.  
Co-administration of 8 mg TAF with 150 mg COBI in GS-US-311-0101 increased the Cmax and AUC of 
TAF and TFV vs. 8 mg TAF alone to the same extent as observed with the test formulations in GS-US-
292-0101 vs. 25 mg TAF alone. On this basis it was reasonable to conclude that the effect was mainly 
due to inhibition of P-gp-mediated intestinal secretion of TAF by COBI.  
Based on the TAF monotherapy study GS-US-120-0104 it was calculated that the final FDC formulation 
should contain ~10 mg TAF in order to provide steady state plasma TAF and TFV exposures and 
antiviral effects similar to those achieved with ~25 mg TAF given alone. To confirm this calculation, 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 111/159  
  
  
 
 
GS-US-292-0103 compared an FDC containing 10 mg TAF (as 11.2 mg [hemi]-fumarate; the final 
presentation) with FTC 200 mg and TAF 25 mg, there being no known interaction between the latter. 
After multiple daily dosing with food, the plasma TAF Cmax and AUC after the FDC containing 10 mg 
TAF vs. TAF 25 mg met the bioequivalence criteria. The plasma TFV Cmax and AUC were ~1.14 and 
1.24-fold higher with the FDC but still very substantially lower than occurs after STB. Also, 
bioequivalence between groups was observed for EVG, COBI and FTC.  
Dosing conditions 
Oral dosing with the FDC containing 10 mg TAF in GS-US-292-0110 indicated that both meal types 
slowed the rate of absorption and increased the extent of absorption of TAF and TFV to a very similar 
extent vs. the fasted state. Nevertheless, FDC dosing was with food in efficacy studies because of the 
EVG and COBI content and this is recommended in the SmPC. 
TAF distribution and fate 
There does not appear to be a potential for in-vivo isomerisation. 
TAF was selected for potential clinical use based on its rapid disappearance from plasma, efficient 
loading into PBMCs, intracellular conversion to TFV (via CES1 and CatA to form TFV-alanine and then 
hydrolysis in lysosomes to form TFV, which is then phosphorylated to the active diphosphate form 
exactly as happens after dosing with TDF. This hypothesis fits with the fact that <2% of an oral 
radioactive dose appeared in urine as intact TAF and none in faeces whereas TFV accounted for almost 
all of the radioactive dose recovered from urine and faeces. In contrast, although TAF accounted for 
most of the plasma radioactivity in the first few h, most of the radioactivity in plasma (74%) was 
associated with uric acid over 96 h post-dose. After conversion to TFV, TAF is mainly metabolised via 
the purine catabolic pathway. This includes formation of uric acid, which does not appear to be a 
significant safety issue for TAF (see the safety section).    
It cannot be ruled out that there could be a clinically important effect on safety if E/C/F/TAF is co-
administered with agents that could interfere with the purine catabolic pathway. Consequently this is 
appropriately described in the SmPC. In addition, the applicant committed to perform an in vitro study 
on the potential for significant effects on plasma TFV concentrations upon co-administration of TAF and 
xanthine oxidase inhibitors.  
Based on nonclinical studies the applicant has concluded that the conversion of TAF to TFV in PBMCs is 
via lysosomal carboxypeptidase A (cathepsin A; CatA). In-vitro studies did not suggest significant 
inhibition of the conversion step by HIV protease inhibitors (known to inhibit CatA) but the HCV PIs 
telaprevir and boceprevir could have an effect intracellularly and co-administration of E/C/F/TAF with 
these agents is not recommended in the SmPC. It cannot be ruled out that future drugs likely to be co-
administered with E/C/F/TAF could have an effect on CatA activity and significantly affect the 
conversion of TAF to TFV intracellularly. As a recommendation, the applicant is requested to review any 
new viral protease inhibitors that may be approved in future for their ability to inhibit Cat A. 
Special populations 
The SmPC recommends no dose adjustment in adult patients with estimated creatinine clearance 
≥ 30 mL/min or with Class A or B hepatic impairment. This advice conflicted with the existing SmPC for 
Emtriva but it was agreed on the basis of the safety data in patients with baseline CrCL 30-50 mL/min 
in study GS-US-292-0112, suggesting that although FTC plasma levels are higher when CrCL falls into 
this range there are no important effects on safety. Plasma levels of TFV in subjects with severe renal 
impairment after a 25 mg dose of TAF did not exceed those observed after dosing subjects with normal 
renal function with 300 mg TDF. In addition, the safety data support a benign profile for TAF vs. TDF. 
Therefore, relaxation of the minimum CrCL applied to TDF was accepted for E/C/F/TAF.

Each of Stribild, EVG and COBI are indicated only for use in adults. FTC and TDF are both approved for 
use in adolescents at the same dose as in adults although for TDF this use is restricted for reasons of 
safety to adolescents with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first line agents. In light 
of the substitution of TDF with TAF and the low plasma exposures, the PK, safety and efficacy data 
supported use of E/C/F/TAF in adolescents at the same dose as in adults.  
Drug interactions 
Changing TDF to TAF has no major effect on the risk for clinically significant DDIs to occur since most 
of the issues are due to the EVG and COBI content.  
Pharmacodynamic considerations 
The evidence to support selection of 25 mg TAF once daily comes from the monotherapy studies. In 
the second study 25 mg and 40 mg achieved effects on viral load that were similar to that of 50 mg 
and 150 mg in a prior study, suggesting a plateau effect from ~25 mg upwards and superiority over 
TDF 300 mg. It was clear that 8 mg TAF was not an appropriate dose. Doses between 8 and 25 mg 
were not studied.  
The peripheral blood mononuclear cell TFV-DP concentrations were highly variable across dose groups 
and time points. This fact may or may not explain why the intracellular PBMC concentrations of TFV-DP 
were ~ 7-fold and ~ 25-fold higher after 25 mg and 40 mg doses of TAF, respectively, vs. TDF. Thus 
there was a lack of linearity with dose. Despite this apparent difference in intracellular TFV-DP the 40 
mg dose of TAF did not have a superior antiviral effect to 25 mg. Since the antiviral effect should carry 
more weight, the TAF monotherapy studies support a conclusion that doses lower than 25 mg should 
not be pursued and that increasing the dose beyond 25 mg is unlikely to achieve a greater antiviral 
effect.   
To further support the selection of the 25 mg TAF dose the applicant provided the results of Emax 
modelling. It is important to note that there was no relationship detected between plasma TFV and 
antiviral activity.  
The models gave an Emax of ~1.7 to 1.8 log 10 decline in viral load from baseline. The EC50 
approximated to a TAF AUC of ~32 ng•h/mL. It was concluded that 25 mg TAF will provide near 
maximal activity.  
In this regard it should be noted that after 10 days dosing with TAF 25 mg alone the mean and median 
TAF AUClast values were 115 and 109 ng.h/mL, respectively. In addition, the POPPK analysis gave a 
mean (95% CI; % CV) predicted steady-state AUC from Phase 3 studies in the ART-naïve of 206.4 
(55.6 - 526.1; 71.8%) ng/mL*h. The predicted range across various subgroups was from ~170-250 
ng.h/mL. On this basis, the 10 mg TAF dose in the FDC is predicted to give AUC values that 
comfortably exceed the EC 50 in the majority. 
It is also relevant to note that the slight deviation from dose proportionality in TAF and TFV plasma 
levels observed in the negative TQT study for 25 vs. 125 mg TAF over the 5-fold range tested suggests 
that uptake of TAF into cells and conversion to TFV was not easily saturable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
TAF is a prodrug of TFV with a distinct metabolic profile to TDF that results in > 90% lower circulating 
levels of TFV and > 4-fold higher intracellular levels of the active phosphorylated metabolite TFV-DP. 
Co-administration of 8 mg TAF with 150 mg COBI increased the Cmax and AUC of TAF and TFV vs. 8 mg 
TAF alone to the same extent as observed with the test formulations vs 25 mg TAF alone. It was 
concluded that the effect was mainly due to inhibition of P-gp-mediated intestinal secretion of TAF by

COBI. Oral dosing with the FDC containing 10 mg TAF indicated that meals slowed the rate of 
absorption and increased the extent of absorption of TAF and TFV to a very similar extent vs. the 
fasted state. Nevertheless, FDC dosing was with food in efficacy studies because of the EVG and COBI 
content and therefore administration with food is recommended in the SmPC. Changing TDF to TAF has 
no major effect on the risk for clinically significant DDIs to occur since most of the issues are due to 
the EVG and COBI content.

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
In support use of 10 mg TAF, a Phase 2 study was conducted in ART-naïve adults (GS-US-292-0102) 
with an open-label (OL) extension that also enrolled a cohort of virologically suppressed adults. In the 
double-blind phase patients were randomised (2:1) to E/C/F/TAF or STB once daily with food. After 
Week 48, patients continued on blinded study drug until treatment assignments were unblinded. At the 
unblinding visit they had the option to receive E/C/F/TAF in the OL extension. 
In the double-blind phase  
Of the 170 treated, study drug discontinuation occurred in 7 E/C/F/TAF (6.3%; 4 due to AEs) and 5 
STB (8.6%; 0 due to AEs) patients. There was no difference in the Week 24 virologic success rates. An 
additional analysis of virologic success based on < 20 copies/mL using the FDA snapshot algorithm 
gave rates of 77.7% for E/C/F/TAF and 72.4% for STB (difference 2%; 95% CI -11.8, 15.9%).

c Week 24 window was between Day 140 and 195 (inclusive). 
d Discontinuation due to other reasons included subjects who discontinued study drug due to investigator's discretion, withdrew consent, lost to follow-up, 
subject noncompliance, protocol violation, pregnancy, and study discontinued by sponsor. 
Similar rates for sustained virologic success were achieved through Week 48 (days 308-377).

High rates of virologic suppression (< 50 copies/mL) were maintained through Week 96 (M = F at 
Week 96: 87.5%; M = E at Week 96: 96.1%) and there were no cases of rebound between Weeks 48 
and 96.  
In the OL extension phase 
In the E/C/F/TAF group virologic suppression through Week 96 was 87.5% (M = F) and 96.1% (M = 
E). Virologic suppression was maintained and CD4 cell count increased in the 91 who switched to 
E/C/F/TAF in the extension phase so that at Week 24 98.9% in the all TDF to TAF group had < 50 
copies/mL (M = E) and mean (SD) change from open-label baseline in CD4 cell count was 61 (159.1) 
cells/µL. Week 144 data for those randomised to the E/C/F/TAF group and Week 48 following switch to 
E/C/F/TAF from D/C/F/TAF (n = 70) or from a TDF-containing regimen showed that in the original 
E/C/F/TAF group 84.8% (95/112) maintained < 50 copies/mL at Week 144. Of those who switched 
98.6% and 100% were still suppressed at Week 48. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Two studies were conducted in ART-naïve patients (GS-US-292-0104 and 0111) and one in 
virologically suppressed patients who switched to E/C/F/TAF or continued the prior ART regimen (GS-
US-292-0109).

a Following the baseline visit, subjects returned for study visits at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 and then every 12 weeks through Week 96. 
b Subjects will continue to attend visits every 12 weeks following Week 96 until treatment assignments are unblinded. 
c Once Gilead provides unblinded treatment assignments to the investigators, all subjects will return to the clinic (preferably within 30 days) for an 
unblinding visit. At the unblinding visit all subjects will discontinue their blinded study drugs and will be given an option to participate in an OL rollover 
study. Subjects who do not wish to participate in the OL rollover study will discontinue their blinded study drugs and will return for a 30 Day Follow-up 
visit following the unblinding visit. 
d Subjects who have discontinued study drugs prior to the unblinding visit will not be eligible for the OL rollover study; these subjects will be asked to 
continue attending the scheduled study visits through the unblinding visit and discontinue the study after the unblinding visit.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of E/C/F/TAF vs. STB in HIV-infected, ART naive 
adults based on HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48. The details of the assay(s) used to measure 
HIV RNA are not reported but virological responses are reported at the < 50 and < 20 copies/mL level.  
A sample size of 840 patients randomised 1:1 (420 per group) was planned to achieve at least 95% 
power to assess a non-inferiority margin of 12% applied to the difference in Week 48 response rate 
(HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL as defined by the FDA snapshot algorithm) between 2 groups. It was 
assumed that each treatment would elicit a response rate of 0.85. The significance level was 1-sided 
alpha of 0.025. 
Two interim IDMC analyses were conducted prior to the primary analysis. An alpha penalty of 0.00001 
was applied for each interim analysis so the primary efficacy hypothesis of non-inferiority of E/C/F/TAF 
vs. STB was tested with a 1-sided, 0.02499 alpha level. The Week 48 primary efficacy analysis used 
the FAS. The baseline stratum weighted difference in the response rate and its 95.002% CI were 
calculated based on stratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel (MH) proportion. 
Based on planned Week 48 interim analyses conducted after all randomised patients had completed 
the Week 48 study visit or had prematurely discontinued. It was planned that data would be combined 
across studies to assess efficacy, including an assessment of superiority of E/C/F/TAF over STB. After 
Week 96, patients will continue to take their blinded study drugs and attend visits every 12 weeks until 
treatment assignments are unblinded, at which point all patients will return for an unblinding visit and 
will be given the option to participate in an open-label (OL) rollover study to receive E/C/F/TAF.

Overall 867/872 randomised patients received a dose of study drug and 813 (E/C/F/TAF 94.9%; STB 
92.6%) were still on treatment at the Week 48 cut-off date while 54 had discontinued study drugs 
(E/C/F/TAF 5.1%, 22; STB 7.4%, 32) mainly due to withdrawal of consent (8 vs. 7). Demographic and

disease characteristics were similar between treatments. The majority was male (85.4%), the median 
age was 33 years (18 to 76) and most were white (58.2%). Most had acquired HIV-1 via homosexual 
sex. The majority (93.4%) was asymptomatic. The baseline median eGFRCG value was slightly higher 
in the E/C/F/TAF group (118.5 mL/min vs. STB 112.8 mL/min) whilst 79 (9.1%) had dipstick 
proteinuria.

The median rate of adherence to study drug up to the Week 48 visit was 98.8% in both treatment 
groups and most (84.6% vs. 80.9%) had adherence rates of ≥ 95%. At Week 48 the virologic success 
rates were very high and E/C/F/TAF was non-inferior to STB. Similar findings applied in the Week 48 
PP Analysis Set (97.8% vs. 98.0%; 95.002% CI: -2.2% to 2.1%).

HIV-1 RNA levels decreased rapidly in the first 2 weeks and were stable after Week 8 through Week 
48, when mean decreases were E/C/F/TAF -3.24 log 10 copies/mL and STB -3.27 log 10 copies/mL.  
The Week 48 virologic success rates for the pre-defined subgroups of interest were similar between 
treatments. Based on an additional analysis evaluating the interaction between regions and treatment 
effect, the differences between the E/C/F/TAF and STB groups in the rate of virologic success across 11 
pre-defined regions were similar between E/C/F/TAF and STB groups.

Results – GS-US-292-0111 
The study was conducted at 121 sites in 10 countries. Overall 866/872 patients randomised received a 
dose of study drug and 804 (E/C/F/TAF 94.7%, STB 91.0%) were still on study drug at the Week 48 
cut-off date. The most common reasons for premature discontinuation of study drug were LTFU (2.3% 
vs. 2.1%). Three patients died (alcohol intoxication E/C/F/TAF; alcohol and multiple drug toxicity and 
myocardial infarction STB). 
Demographic and disease baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. The 
majority was male (84.6%), the median age was 33 years (range 18 to 71) and most were white 
(55.2%). The majority had acquired HIV-1 via homosexual sex (74.9%). Most (89.9%) were 
asymptomatic. The median eGFRCG value was E/C/F/TAF 115.9 mL/min vs. STB 114.7 mL/min and 95 
(11.0%) had proteinuria by dipstick.

The median rate of adherence to study drug up to Week 48 was high and similar between treatment 
groups (E/C/F/TAF 98.5%; STB 98.8%). Most patients (78.5% and 80.8%) had ≥ 95% adherence.

Virologic outcomes at Week 48 were also similar between treatments when assessed using the FDA-
defined snapshot algorithm applied to HIV-1 RNA < 20 copies/mL. Rates of virologic failure in this 
analysis were the same for the two treatments (13.9% vs. 13.8%) and similar findings applied in the 
PP Analysis Set (E/C/F/TAF 87.7%; STB 87.2%; 95% CI: -4.7% to 4.3%). The pure virologic response 
rates through Week 48 were E/C/F/TAF 93.7% vs. STB 93.1%. 
HIV-1 RNA levels decreased rapidly in the first 2 weeks on study drugs and were then stable from 
Week 8 through Week 48. The mean decreases at Week 48 were E/C/F/TAF 3.19 log 10 copies/mL and 
STB 3.14 log 10 copies/mL.  
The subgroup analyses based on the FDA-defined snapshot algorithm applied to Week 48 data showed 
that in four subgroups (females, baseline HIV-1 RNA ≤ 100,000 copies/mL, baseline CD4 count ≥ 200 
cells/μL and adherence rate ≥ 95%) the virologic success rates favoured E/C/F/TAF vs. STB. The 
differences between the E/C/F/TAF and STB groups across the 8 predefined regions were similar.

a Following the baseline visit, subjects were scheduled to return for study visits at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, and then every 12 weeks through Week 96. 
b Subjects who complete the study through Week 96 and do not wish to continue to participate will be required to return to the clinic 30 days after the 
completion of the study drug for a 30-day follow-up visit. 
c After Week 96, all subjects will be given the option to receive open-label E/C/F/TAF and attend visits every 12 weeks until it becomes commercially 
available, or until Gilead terminates clinical development of E/C/F/TAF. 
d The study drugs E/C/F/TAF, STB, ATR, ATV/r+TVD, and ATV/co+TVD were administered orally, once daily with food, at approximately the same time 
each day. Those randomized to continue with ATR were instructed to take the study drug once daily an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. 
HIV-infected patients aged ≥ 18 years were eligible if they had participated in pre-defined clinical 
studies and had achieved virological suppression on any of the following FTC/TDF regimens: 
•  STB 
•  Atripla (EFV/FTC/TDF; ATR) 
•  COBI-boosted atazanavir (ATV/co) + FTC/TDF (Truvada; TVD) 
•  Ritonavir (RTV)-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) + TVD 
Plasma HIV-1 RNA was to have been undetectable for at least 6 consecutive months. Other inclusion 
criteria were the same as for the two studies in ARV-naïve patients. Patients were randomised (2:1) 
to: 
•  Switch to E/C/F/TAF (n = 1000) 
•  Maintain existing ARV (n = 500) 
Randomisation was stratified by prior treatment regimen (i.e. STB, ATR, ATV/r or ATV/co+TVD). All 
treatments were to be administered once daily with food at approximately the same time each day 
except for ATR, which was to be administered on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime (due to 
EFV). After completing 96 weeks of randomised treatment, all patients will be offered open-label 
E/C/F/TAF. 
Objective 
The primary objective was to evaluate the non-inferiority of switching to a TAF-containing FDC 
relative to maintaining TDF-containing regimens in virologically suppressed patients based on HIV-1 
RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 (US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm). The definitions of virologic 
outcomes were as for the Phase 3 studies in ARV-naïve. 
The study planned to enrol 1000 in the switch group and 500 in the continuation group. It was 
assumed that both treatment groups would have a response rate of 90% (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL 
at Week 48; FDA snapshot algorithm). There was an interim IDMC analysis prior to analysis for the 
primary endpoint. An alpha penalty of 0.0001 was applied for the IDMC meeting so the alpha level for 
the primary endpoint at Week 48 was adjusted to 0.0499. The difference in the response rate (P1 – 
P2) and its 95.01% CI was calculated using Mantel-Haenszel (MH) proportion stratified by prior 
treatment (STB, ATR or ATV/boosted+TVD). It was concluded that the E/C/F/TAF group was non-
inferior to the FTC/TDF+3rd Agent group if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95.01% CI of the difference 
in response rates was greater than -12%.

Results – GS-US-292-0109 
The study was conducted at 168 study sites across 20 countries. Overall 1436/1443 randomised 
patients received a dose of study drug. Demographic and disease baseline characteristics were similar 
between treatments except for E/C/F/TAF 25.9% vs. FTC/TDF+3rd Agent 17.2% of Hispanic or Latino 
ethnicity. The majority was male (89.3%) with a median age of 41 years (21 to 77 years) and most 
were white (67.2%). Most had acquired HIV via homosexual sex (78.6%). In accordance with the 
protocol, 1409/1436 (98.1%) had baseline HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. The median baseline CD4 
count was 669 cells/µL and median baseline CD4% was 35.9%. The majority (90.8%) had no 
proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis and eGFR values measured by CG or by either of the CKD-EPI 
methods were similar between treatment groups. The distributions of patients by prior treatment 
regimens were as follows: 
Following the completion of all patients through Week 48, comparable percentages maintained 
virologic suppression at < 50 c/mL. Rates in the PP Analysis were 99.1% for E/C/F/TAF and 98.9% for 
FTC/TDF+3rd Agent. In addition, percentages with HIV-1 RNA < 20 copies/mL at Week 48 were 
E/C/F/TAF 93.5% and FTC/TDF+3rd Agent 90.4% (difference 3.2%, 95% CI: 0.1% to 6.3%). One 
patient (0.1%) from the E/C/F/TAF group had a confirmed virologic rebound and the virus showed 
emergent resistance (M184M/l).

Study Title: A Phase 3 Open-label Safety Study of Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
Alafenamide Single-Tablet Regimen in HIV-1 Positive Patients with Mild to Moderate Renal Impairment 
This open-label study was primarily designed to assess the safety profile of E/C/F/TAF in HIV-infected 
patients with stable renal impairment (eGFRCG 30-69 mL/min) at Week 24. Enrolment was in 2 
cohorts: 
o  Cohort 1: switched to E/C/F/TAF from an existing ARV regimen on which they had HIV-1 RNA 
< 50 copies/mL for at least 6 months or they had successfully completed GS-US-236-0118. 
o  Cohort 2: ARV-naïve with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL 
All subjects received E/C/F/TAF once daily with food. Selection criteria were similar to those for Phase 
3. 
In Cohort 1 the majority was male (79.3%) with median age 58 years (63 were ≥ 65 years). Most 
(65.3%) were taking TDF-containing regimens prior to the switch. The baseline median CD4 count and 
CD4% were 632 cells/µL and 34.7%, respectively. Overall, 97.5% had baseline HIV-1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL and 2.5% had ≥ 50 to ≤ 100,000 copies/mL. The majority acquired HIV via homosexual sex 
(52.1%), 74.4% were asymptomatic and 14.0% had AIDS. Overall, 33.1% had eGFRCG < 50 mL/min, 
63.6% had eGFRCG 30-59 mL/min, 42.3% had clinically significant proteinuria (UPCR > 200 mg/g) and 
48.9% had clinically significant albuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g). Dipsticks showed that 9.5% had Grade 
2, 23.1% had Grade 1 and 67.4% had no proteinuria. In Cohort 2 only 6 patients were enrolled. 
Following the completion of all patients to Week 48 there were no clinically relevant differences in 
virologic success rates between subgroups (age, sex, race, region, or study drug adherence rate) for 
Cohort 1. The virologic success rate for those aged ≥ 65 years was 85.7% (54/63). The percentages 
with < 20 copies/mL at Week 48 using the FAS were 90.1% for Cohort 1 (baseline eGFRCG < 50 
mL/min 88.8%; baseline eGFRCG ≥ 50 mL/min 90.7%) and 6/6 in Cohort 2. In Cohort 1, 2 patients 
(0.8%) had virus that showed resistance to multiple drug classes. One had the same resistance 
documented in an historic genotype and the other appeared to have had reinfection with a resistant 
virus.

CD4 cell counts remained stable during treatment with E/C/F/TAF for Cohort 1 and increased in Cohort 
2 with a mean change from baseline to Week 48 of 152 [SD 152.3] cells/µL. 
Analysis of viral resistance  
An integrated virology analysis was performed for patients from GS-US-292-0102 (Phase 2), 
GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 (Phase 3). Genotyping of the PR/RT genes was conducted at 
screening and patients had to have viruses with genotypic sensitivity to FTC and TDF. Genotyping of 
the IN gene was conducted at screening in Phase 3 and viruses were to have genotypic sensitivity to 
EVG. HIV genotype distributions were comparable between treatment groups, with subtype B 
predominant (87%) followed by AE (6.7%). 
No impact of baseline RAMs or HIV subtype was observed on treatment outcomes (p > 0.05).  
Of 1903 treated patients only 1.9% (19/978) E/C/F/TAF and 2.4% (22/925) STB were included in the 
RAP and only 14 and 16 in respective groups were included in the final RAP. For those with data: 
•  4/10 E/C/F/TAF patients had viruses with new RAMs, all of which had M184V associated with 
phenotypic resistance to FTC (FC ≥ 63 to > 89) and primary INSTI-R (2 with E92Q, one with 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015

N155H and one with T66A). Phenotypic resistance to EVG was observed in 3 cases and the 
other had assay failure. One developed K65R without phenotypic resistance to TFV (FC = 1.0). 
•  7/13 STB patients had viruses with new RAMs, all of which had M184V/I detected with 
phenotypic resistance to FTC in 5 cases. Four had emergent primary INSTI-R including 2 with 
E92Q, one Q148R and one E92E/Q plus Q148R; all showed phenotypic resistance to EVG (FC = 
12.8 to > 156). Four had additional NRTI-R detected including 2 with K65R, one with K70K/E 
and one with E44E/D but 3 remained sensitive to TFV (FC = 0.5 to 1.3) and one had assay 
failure. 
There were no additional substitutions in the RT or IN genes observed in HIV from more than one 
patient with virologic failure in the E/C/F/TAF or STB groups. 
Viruses in virologic failures were assessed for phenotypic resistance to all commercially available 
NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs and INSTIs. Cross-resistance profiles were consistent with historical data.  
•  Nine who had emergent M184V/I and phenotypic resistance to FTC had cross-resistance to 
lamivudine, with FC values of 5 to > 128. Two with K65R that were successfully phenotyped 
had cross-resistance to ABC (FC = 6.3 and 6.4) but not to ZDV. Viruses with K70K/E and 
E44E/D remained sensitive to ABC and ZDV.  
•  Six of the 7 with virologic failure who had emergent primary INSTI-R and phenotypic 
resistance to EVG showed cross-resistance to raltegravir (FC = 2.9 to 75). The virus that was 
not cross-resistant had emergent T66A at virologic failure, which is an EVG-specific resistance 
mutation. Three of the 7 were assessed for cross resistance to DTG and all remained sensitive 
with FC values < 4. 
The results observed in the other efficacy studies (GS-US-292-0106, -0112 and -0109) were consistent 
with the integrated analysis.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Phase 2 and 3 studies vs. STB in ART-naïve 
Due to the antiviral activity of the EVG/COBI and FTC content of STB and E/C/F/TAF, the Phase 2 and 3 
studies vs. STB are not sensitive enough to provide definitive evidence that the TAF dose is sufficient. 
Therefore the critical data to support the dose in the FDC come from the monotherapy studies (with 
doses ranging from 8 to 150 mg), the Emax modelling and the PK data that supported adjusting the 
dose in the FDC from 25 mg to 10 mg. These data are then supported by the Phase 3 comparative 
efficacy data and the analyses of emergence of mutational resistance.  
The Phase 2/3 studies in ART-naïve patients were all conducted vs. STB because a major aim was to 
compare the safety profiles of TDF and TAF. Overall, the clinical development plan in the ART-naïve 
population is considered to be appropriate and acceptable. In terms of the actual results of these 
studies the following observations are made: 
In Phase 3 the primary analyses were based on percentages with < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 using 
the FDA snapshot algorithm and gave very high response rates that were comparable between 
treatments. Results were also reported for percentages reaching < 20 copies/mL and these data, along 
with all the sensitivity analyses conducted, consistently support a conclusion of comparability between 
treatments.  
In Phase 2 there was a suggestion that STB might be better in those with the highest baseline viral 
loads (but only 20% had >100,000 c/mL) and lowest CD4 counts (but < 5% had < 200 cells/µL). In 
Assessment report  
EMA/688326/2015 
Page 133/159  
  
  
 
 
the Phase 3 studies slightly higher percentages had >100,000 c/mL (~23%) and < 200 cells/µL 
(13%). One study essentially showed no difference between treatments whereas in 0111 the point 
estimates were lower with E/C/F/TAF even though the CI overlapped. Since patients were documented 
to have susceptible virus at baseline there is no obvious explanation and the findings could have 
occurred by chance. Further exploration did not identify any differences in demographic details of the 
subgroups enrolled with the highest viral loads and lowest CD4 counts (including numbers falling into 
both categories) in each treatment group. The finding is mentioned in the SmPC. 
Female patients accounted for ~15% of the total in Phase 3 and showed results comparable to those 
for men, with no appreciable difference between treatments. 
In Phase 2 96% of patients had HIV-1 B. The virological responses by HIV-1 subtypes pooled across 
Phase 3 studies did not suggest any specific problems but data are few. 
Virologically suppressed patients who switched to E/C/F/TAF 
Data were obtained in the open-label extension of the Phase 2 study (switch from a DRV/COBI-
containing regimen) and in GS-US-292-0109. The comparative safety data in patients who did and did 
not switch to E/C/F/TAF in study 0109 are considered to be more important than the efficacy data. 
Nevertheless, the efficacy data from both datasets do not point to unexpectedly high rates of virologic 
rebound at the < 50 or < 20 c/mL cut-offs after switching and the CD4 counts were well maintained. 
Therefore these data support a conclusion that E/C/F/TAF can suffice to maintain virologic suppression.  
E/C/F/TAF in mild/moderate renal impairment  
In the Phase 2 and 3 studies ART-naïve patients were to have eGFRCG ≥ 50 mL/min at baseline and 
the means/medians exceeded 100 mL/min. The same inclusion criterion was applied to the switch 
study in virologically suppressed patients. Therefore, study 0112 was intended to support the safety of 
E/C/F/TAF in HIV-infected patients with eGFRCG 30-69 mL/min. The FTC dose was not adjusted for 
those with eGFRCG < 50 mL/min in this study and the safety data obtained supported no dose 
adjustment for E/C/F/TAF for patients with eGFRCG ≥ 30 mL/min. 
Focussing on Cohort 1, this population was expectedly older than in the ART-naïve studies. Switching 
to E/C/F/TAF was associated with very few virologic rebounds at the < 50 or < 20 c/mL cut-offs 
regardless of baseline renal function.   
Use in adolescents 
STB, EVG and COBI are not approved for use in adolescents and use of TDF is restricted because of 
safety concerns in growing adolescents, including effects on bone mineralisation. Using the PK data 
from 24 patients enrolled into cohort 1 of GS-US-292-0106 the POPPK analysis suggested comparable 
plasma exposures to TAF and TFV in adults and adolescents. There is no known reason to think that 
TAF uptake and intracellular conversion to TFV would be impeded in adolescents compared to adults. 
Most of these patients were black, noting that ART-naïve black adults generally responded slightly 
better than other ethnic groups in Phase 3. Also, 58.3% were female and the median age was 15 years 
(range 12 to 17). The data for all 50 enrolled suggest that responses to treatment are similar to those 
in adults.  
Virological data 
The data do not point to any major concerns.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The selected 10 mg dose of TAF in the FDC derives from monotherapy studies, the Emax modelling 
and PK data. These data are further supported by the Phase 3 comparative efficacy data and the 
analyses of emergence of mutational resistance. The Phase 3 primary analyses gave very high 
comparable response rates in terms of proportion of patients achieving < 50 copies/mL at Week 48. 
Data < 20 copies/mL along with all the sensitivity analyses conducted consistently support a 
conclusion of comparability between treatments. Data from the switch study d support a conclusion 
that E/C/F/TAF can suffice to maintain virologic suppression. Data in HIV-infected patients with renal 
impairment support the safety of E/C/F/TAF with eGFRCG 30-69 mL/min. PK data suggested 
comparable plasma exposures to TAF and TFV in adults and adolescents supporting the use in this 
population. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The focus is on the HIV-infected patients who received E/C/F/TAF in the six studies Phase 2/3 studies.

Bone Mineral Density 
At Week 48 in GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 fewer patients in the E/C/F/TAF group had a 
> 3% decrease from baseline in hip BMD (E/C/F/TAF 16.8%; STB 50.1%) or in spine BMD (E/C/F/TAF 
26.5%; STB 45.8%).  
Virologically suppressed adults who switched to E/C/F/TAF from a TDF-based regimen in Study GS-US-
292-0109 had statistically significant improvements in both hip and spine BMD. Mean (SD) percentage 
changes from baseline in BMD at Week 48 were 1.949% (2.9956) at the hip and 1.861% (3.0889) at 
the spine. There were minimal changes in the FTC/TDF+3rd Agent group (p < 0.001).

In GS-US-292-0109 there was no change from baseline in serum levels of C-telopeptide in the 
E/C/F/TAF group compared with an increase from baseline in the FTC/TDF+3rd Agent group at 
Week 48 (p = 0.007). 
Renal safety  
No cases of proximal renal tubulopathy were reported (including Fanconi syndrome) in patients who 
have received E/C/F/TAF for any length of time. 
Ocular safety (AESI due to nonclinical findings) 
ART-naive in Phase 3 (GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111) 
The incidence of AEs in the eye disorders SOC was 7.0% for E/C/F/TAF (61) and 7.3% for STB (63), of 
which 16 and 9 in respective groups had AEs considered related to study drugs by the investigator. 
There were no AEs of uveitis in the E/C/F/TAF group although 23 (2.7%) vs. 15 (1.7%) in the STB 
group had AEs that could represent symptoms of uveitis, of which the most common was vision blurred 
in E/C/F/TAF 1.3% vs. STB 1.0%.

AEs in the SOC of eye disorders were reported for 5.5% E/C/F/TAF (53) and 4.6% FTC/TDF+3rd Agent 
(22) patients. There were no reports of uveitis. AEs that could represent symptoms of uveitis were 
reported for 1.9% E/C/F/TAF and 0.8% FTC/TDF+3rd Agent patients. In the ophthalmologic sub-study 
most patients had normal assessments at Week 24 (26/31 vs. 12/14) and Week 48 (14/18 vs. 6/8).

Agent 0.04 mg/dL (p < 0.001). 
eGFR 
In ART-naive patients in GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 the decreases from baseline in 
median eGFRCG were smaller with E/C/F/TAF vs. STB. Consistent results were observed using eGFRCKD-
EPI serum creatinine. The difference was statistically significant from Week 2 to 48 (see Figure 11).

In patients who switched from a TDF-based regimen to E/C/F/TAF (GS-US-292-0109) there were 
minimal changes in eGFRCG that varied by prior regimen (median change from -0.4 to 5.8 mg/dL).  
Other renal biomarkers 
In the ART-naive patients in GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 there were significant differences 
between groups for the parameters shown in Table 79. There was no change from baseline in median 
FEUA using adjusted serum creatinine at Week 48 in the E/C/F/TAF group vs. an increase in the STB 
group (p < 0.001 at Week 48). There were no differences in median TmP/GFR between treatment 
groups. The median FEPO4 using adjusted serum creatinine was increased relative to baseline through 
Week 48 for both groups and was significantly greater in the STB group (p = 0.005) at Week 48.

In GS-US-292-0109 there were decreases from baseline in UPCR and UACR with E/C/F/TAF but 
increases from baseline with FTC/TDF+3rd Agent at Week 48 (p < 0.001). There were also decreases 
from baseline in the E/C/F/TAF group in urine RBP to creatinine and beta-2-microglobulin to creatinine 
ratios but increases at most time points in the FTC/TDF+3rd Agent group (p < 0.001).  
Other laboratory parameters 
ART-naive in Phase 3 (GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111) 
Median increases from baseline in fasting lipid parameters occurred with both treatments but were 
greater in the E/C/F/TAF group at Week 48 (p < 0.001).  
More E/C/F/TAF patients had categorical changes in NCEP ATP III lipid classifications from baseline 
except for HDL. Grade 3 LDL abnormalities were reported for 5.0% (42) in the E/C/F/TAF group and 
2.2% (18) in the STB group.  
Virologically suppressed (GS-US-292-0109) 
There were increases from baseline in fasting lipid parameters in the E/C/F/TAF group only, regardless 
of prior treatment, and categorical shifts from baseline were more frequent vs. FTC/TDF+3rd Agent. 
Grade 3 fasting LDL abnormalities occurred in 7.2% E/C/F/TAF (67) vs. 0.9% FTC/TDF+3rd Agent.  
Safety in special populations 
Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GS-US-292-0112) 
This open-label study was primarily designed to assess the safety profile of E/C/F/TAF in HIV-infected 
patients with eGFR CG in the range 30-69 mL/min. There were no clinically significant changes from 
baseline in aGFR, eGFRCG, eGFRCKD-EPI, cysC and eGFRCKD-EPI, creatinine. Significant decreases in 
proteinuria (UPCR), albuminuria (UACR), and tubular proteinuria from baseline occurred as early as 1 
week after switch to E/C/F/TAF from a TDF-containing regimen with median levels decreasing to below 
the baseline levels. Improvements in BMD were also noted (see Table 81).

ART-naïve adolescents (GS-US-292-0106) 
This open-label study was conducted in 50 ARV-naïve adolescents aged from 12 to <17 years. All have 
received E/C/F/TAF for at least 8 weeks while 25 have received 48 weeks.  
At least 1 AE was reported for 84.0% (42/50), most of which were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Four 
subjects (8.0%) had a Grade 3 or 4 AE. The most common AEs were nausea, URTI and respiratory 
tract infection (each reported in 24.0%; 12) and 18 (36.0%) had an AE considered related to study 
drug by the investigator, most of which were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity, most commonly nausea, 
abdominal pain, vomiting, upper abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Four subjects (8.0%) had a SAE but 
only one patient (visual impairment and intermediate uveitis) had SAEs considered related to study 
drug by the investigator. No subject had an AE that led to study drug discontinuation and there were 
no deaths. One other event of potential uveitis occurred in a subject who used illicit substances prior to 
sleeping and then awoke with blurred vision and photophobia. The visual changes resolved later that 
same day.

The median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline in serum creatinine was 0.06 (0.00, 0.12) mg/dL at Week 
1 (baseline median [Q1, Q3], 0.58 [0.50, 0.79] mg/dL). Creatinine subsequently stabilized without 
progressive changes with a median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline at Week 24 of 0.08 (0.00, 0.15) 
mg/dL. No graded abnormalities of serum creatinine were reported. 
The median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline in eGFR (calculated using the Schwartz formula) at Week 1 
was -13.0 (-26.0, 0.0) mL/min/1.73 m2 (baseline median [Q1, Q3], 156.0 [129.0, 185.0] mL/min/1.73 
m2). The median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline at Week 24 was -15.0 (-30.0, 0.0) mL/min/1.73 m2. 
No AEs of decreased eGFR or renal failure were reported. 
Post-baseline, treatment-emergent Grade 1 or Grade 2 proteinuria, generally isolated and transient, 
was reported for 36.0% (18/50). Proteinuria was not reported as an AE for any subject. There were no 
SAEs of proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi Syndrome) and no subject had laboratory 
findings consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy. 
At Week 24, 3/47 subjects (6.4%) had a ≥ 4% decrease in spine BMD but none had a ≥ 4% decrease 
in TBLH BMD.

Three subjects have had > 4% decrease from baseline in spine BMD at Week 24. A corresponding > 
4% decrease was not observed in TBLH BMD, and spine BMD subsequently increased in the 2 subjects 
with available Week 48 data. Therefore, the applicant considers that these events likely represent 
transient spine BMD decreases due to growth.  
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in median values for any haematology or 
clinical chemistry parameter. Increases from baseline in the fasting lipid parameters were observed at 
Week 24 (median [Q1, Q3] change from baseline):

Most (96%, 48/50) had at least 1 treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality reported, most of which 
were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Excluding Grade 3 haematuria detected by non-quantitative dipstick 
analysis, Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities were reported for 4 subjects. Isolated abnormalities of 
grade 3 decreased neutrophils were reported for 3 subjects. One subject had transient Grade 3 
haematuria following quantitative analysis. None of these laboratory abnormalities was reported as an 
AE. 
Results from GS-US-292-0106 were compared with those from a study of STB also in HIV-infected, 
ART-naive adolescents (GS-US-236-0112) which had similar objectives, design, procedures and 
assessments. The applicant acknowledges that none of STB, EVG, COBI or TDF are approved for use in 
ART-naïve adolescents but the studies allow for a comparison of the safety of TAF versus TDF.  
The E/C/F/TAF and STB studies each enrolled 50 adolescents (median age 15 years in both studies, 
56% vs. 30% female, 88% vs. 68% Black, 22% vs. 20% with baseline HIV-1 RNA > 100,000 
copies/mL, median CD4 count 456 vs. 402 cells/μL, median eGFR [using the Schwartz formula] 156.0 
vs. 139.5 mL/min/1.73m2). Most AEs in both studies were mild and unrelated to treatment, with no 
deaths or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation.  
At Week 24, the median change from baseline in serum creatinine was 0.08 mg/dL in both studies, 
with median eGFR (using the Schwartz formula) changes from baseline of -14.1 mL/min/1.73m2 for 
E/C/F/TAF and -14.0 mL/min/1.73m2 for STB, consistent with the effect of COBI. Proteinuria (any 
grade) occurred in 36% E/C/F/TAF vs. 42% STB subjects, with Grade 2 proteinuria in 8% vs. 14% of 
participants, respectively.

Discontinuation due to AEs 
•

• 
In the ART-naive in GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 AEs that led to discontinuation of 
treatment occurred in 8 E/C/F/TAF (0.9%) and 13 STB (1.5%) patients. No AE leading to 
discontinuation was reported for >1 patient in the E/C/F/TAF group.  
In GS-US-292-0109 discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 9 E/C/F/TAF (0.9%) and 7 
FTC/TDF+3rd Agent (1.5%) patients. In the E/C/F/TAF group none was reported for >1 
patient. Most of these AEs were non-serious and considered to be related to study drug. 
In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GS-US-292-0112) AEs leading to study 
drug discontinuation were reported for 8 (3.3%) patients. Three AEs were considered related 
to study drug, including worsening of sleep disturbance, worsening renal insufficiency and 
choking. Two patients discontinued due to renal AEs of renal failure, both of which reflected 
declining GFR. One had labile hypertension and the other was considered unrelated to study 
drug.  
•  No adolescents in GS-US-292-0106 discontinued study drug due to an AE. 
• 
In the TAF Phase 1 studies 5 subjects discontinued due to 7 AEs. The AEs considered drug-
related were elevated CPK, headache, urticaria (2), pruritus and anxiety.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The Phase 2/3 programme allows for direct comparisons between E/C/F/TAF and STB in previously 
untreated patients as well as the effects of switching from TDF to TAF within regimens, including 
switching from STB to E/C/F/TAF.  
E/C/F/TAF vs. STB in ART-naïve patients  
The safety profile of E/C/F/TAF was mostly very similar to that of STB. Rates for individual types of 
AEs, including Grade 3/4 and drug-related AEs, were comparable or slightly lower vs. STB. In the two 
Phase 3 studies the rates of fractures were low and comparable but fewer patients in the E/C/F/TAF 
group had a > 3% decrease from baseline in hip or spine BMD, noting nonetheless that such decreases 
did still occur in the 48 weeks after starting treatment with E/C/F/TAF. The FRAX analysis also 
suggested a benefit for E/C/F/TAF over STB as did bone biomarkers. 
Switching from TDF to TAF  
It could be expected that AE rates could be higher compared to those who remained on regimens that 
were previously tolerated. The most remarkable finding was the difference in rate of AEs considered to 
be drug-related by investigators. However, this finding occurred in an open-label study, which may 
have influenced investigator assignments to some extent. In addition, the difference seems to have 
been driven by gastro-intestinal AEs and there were few Grade 3 or 4 events. Fractures were reported 
in 1.5% E/C/F/TAF vs. 0.6% FTC/TDF+3rd Agent groups but at Week 48 there were increases from 
baseline in mean BMD at the hip or spine in the E/C/F/TAF group compared to no appreciable change 
in those who did not switch and the FRAX analysis also suggested some benefit from switching.

EMA/688326/2015 
Page 149/159  
  
  
 
 
 
Ocular safety 
Current data do not suggest that the nonclinical findings translate into a concern regarding the ocular 
safety of TAF. There was one adolescent with uveitis considered to be drug-related by the investigator. 
At present it seems reasonable to keep this issue under close review with appropriate reflection in the 
RMP. 
Laboratory findings 
The following issues are of note: 
• 
Renal effects 
In the two Phase 3 studies in ART-naive patients there were statistically significantly smaller increases 
from baseline in mean serum creatinine with E/C/F/TAF vs. STB from Weeks 2 to 48 along with lower 
rates of graded abnormalities. Correspondingly, the decreases from baseline in median eGFRCG were 
statistically significant smaller with E/C/F/TAF vs. STB through the same period. Other renal 
biomarkers suggested no difference between groups or favoured the E/C/F/TAF group. 
In patients who switched from a TDF-based regimen to E/C/F/TAF there was effectively no change 
from baseline in mean serum creatinine to Week 48 compared to a small increase in those who 
continued with FTC/TDF+3rd Agent. In patients who switched to E/C/F/TAF there were minimal 
changes in eGFRCG that varied by prior regimen. Other renal biomarkers generally favoured switching 
to E/C/F/TAF. 
The detailed assessments of renal function in the study in patients with baseline eGFRCG in the range 
30-69 mL/min support a conclusion that E/C/F/TAF has an acceptable safety profile in terms of renal 
effects.  
Thus far there have not been any cases of PRT or Fanconi’s syndrome in patients treated with 
E/C/F/TAF.  
• 
Fasting lipids 
In the Phase 3 studies in previously ART-naïve patients E/C/F/TAF was associated with higher rates of 
abnormal fasting lipids, including Grade 3 and 4 abnormalities, than STB. Similarly, higher rates of 
abnormal fasting lipids were observed in those who switched to E/C/F/TAF vs. those who maintained a 
TDF-containing regimen. The categorical changes from baseline in NCEP ATP III lipid classifications are 
consistent with rates observed with ABC and other non-TDF-based regimens in ART-naive patients. The 
difference between TAF and TDF-containing regimens likely reflects the known lipid-lowering effect of 
TFV and the much lower plasma levels of TFV in those given E/C/F/TAF.  
• 
Uric acid 
Taking into account the metabolic pathway, it should be noted that there was no excess of Grade 3 or 
4 hyperuricaemia with E/C/F/TAF in the ART-naïve Phase 3 studies and only a slightly higher rate of 
hyperuricaemia of any Grade. For mean and median uric acid there was effectively no change from 
baseline to Week 48 in the E/C/F/TAF group and a small decrease in the STB group.  
Grade 3 or 4 hyperuricaemia occurred in 2 E/C/F/TAF and no non-switch patients in 0109. Also, any 
grade hyperuricaemia occurred in 13.2% vs. 5.0% although no AEs were related to abnormal uric acid. 
There were also four patients with renal impairment who had Grade 3 or 4 hyperuricaemia in 0112 
after switching to E/C/F/TAF, two in each eGFRCG sub-group. There was no change from baseline in the 
mean and median uric acid in those with values ≤ 50 mL/min and modest increases in the group with 
> 50 mL/min. These four patients had raised uric acid at baseline.  
Despite the laboratory data AEs that could be due to hyperuricaemia were not observed.

Safety in adolescents 
The applicant proposed use of E/C/F/TAF in patients aged from 12 years and weighing at least 35 kg. 
The number of adolescents exposed is small but the PK analyses suggest similar exposure and the 
safety profile appears mostly comparable with that in adults in terms of the range of AEs reported. 
BMD Z-scores did not change notably from baseline through Week 24, indicating that bone 
mineralisation occurred at rates consistent with those of the reference population. The median change 
from baseline in eGFR has been ascribed to COBI.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of E/C/F/TAF is similar to that of STB. The rates of fractures were low and 
comparable but fewer patients in the E/C/F/TAF group had a > 3% decrease from baseline in hip or 
spine BMD, noting that decreases did still occur in the 48 weeks after starting treatment with 
E/C/F/TAF. In the switch study fractures were reported in 1.5% E/C/F/TAF vs. 0.6% FTC/TDF+3rd 
Agent groups.  At Week 48 there were increases from baseline in mean BMD at the hip or spine in the 
E/C/F/TAF group compared to no appreciable change in those who did not switch. The FRAX analysis 
also suggested benefit for E/C/F/TAF in the naïve as well as in the switch study. Overall, the renal 
safety profile of TAF appears to be better than that of TDF, which may be ascribed to the lower plasma 
TFV levels. Higher rates of abnormal fasting lipids were observed with E/C/F/TAF compared to STB. 
The difference between TAF and TDF-containing regimens likely reflects the known lipid lowering effect 
of TFV and the much lower plasma levels of TFV in those given E/C/F/TAF. Overall, the benefits in 
terms of renal and bone effects appear to outweigh any concerns there may be regarding the lipid 
profile. Hyperuricaemia has occurred at higher rates with E/C/F/TAF and this issue will be kept under 
monitoring as described in the RMP. 
Finally, current data do not suggest that the nonclinical findings translate into a concern regarding the 
ocular safety of TAF. However, this issue will be monitored in the RMP.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 1.0 without changes. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.   
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Genvoya (elvitegravir / cobicistat / 
emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new 
active substance. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
TAF was selected for development specifically because it had potential to be active with much lower 
TFV plasma levels and hence to improve safety vs. TDF. Thus selection of the TAF dose could not be 
based on the simple strategy of matching plasma profiles of TFV achieved with TAF vs. those observed 
with TDF. The critical data to support the dose in the FDC come from the monotherapy studies (with 
TAF doses ranging from 8 to 150 mg), the Emax modelling and the PK data that supported adjusting 
the dose in the FDC from 25 mg to 10 mg.  
The selection of the 10 mg dose in the FDC is supported by the Phase 3 studies vs. STB in which 
percentages with < 50 and < 20 copies/mL at Week 48 using the FDA snapshot algorithm gave very 
high response rates that were comparable between treatments (difference in percentages: 2.0%; 95% 
CI: -0.7% to 4.7%). These data, along with all the sensitivity analyses conducted, consistently support 
a conclusion of comparability between treatments. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The available data from extended follow-up in some studies further support lack of imbalance in rates 
of viral rebound associated with mutational resistance. Nevertheless, longer term usage is needed to 
better define the risk. 
The Phase 2/3 studies in ART-naïve patients were all conducted vs. STB. The potential merits of using 
an alternative comparative regimen that is commonly used for first line treatment can be debated. 
Nevertheless, in this case a major aim was to compare the safety profiles of TDF and TAF and 
therefore selection of STB was rational. 
In Phase 2 there was a suggestion that STB might be better in those with the highest baseline viral 
loads and lowest CD4 counts. One Phase 3 study essentially showed no difference between treatments 
whereas the other showed that point estimates were lower with E/C/F/TAF in these subgroups, even 
though the CI overlapped. Since patients were documented to have susceptible virus at baseline there 
is no obvious explanation and the findings could have occurred by chance. Nevertheless, the results 
are shown in the SmPC. 
Female patients accounted for ~15% of the total in Phase 3 and showed results comparable to those 
for men, with no appreciable difference between treatments. Also, 96% of patients had HIV-1 B so that 
although there was no sign of reduced efficacy against other types no definite conclusions can be 
drawn. 
STB, EVG and COBI are not approved for use in adolescents and use of TDF is restricted because of 
safety concerns in growing adolescents, including effects on bone mineralisation. POPPK analyses using 
data from GS-US-292-0106 suggested comparable plasma exposures to TAF and TFV in adults and 
adolescents (n=24). The efficacy data come from 50 adolescents and most were black, noting that 
ART-naïve black adults generally responded slightly better than other ethnic groups in Phase 3. Also, 
58.3% were female and the median age was 15 years (range 12 to 17). The data suggest that, as 
predicted by the PK analyses, virological responses to treatment are similar to those in adults. 
However, with such limited data, specific monitoring of use in adolescents is recommended in the RMP.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of E/C/F/TAF was mostly very similar to that of STB. Rates for individual types of 
AEs, including Grade 3/4 and drug-related AEs, were comparable or slightly lower vs. STB. In the two 
Phase 3 studies the rates of fractures were low and comparable but fewer patients in the E/C/F/TAF 
group had a > 3% decrease from baseline in hip or spine BMD, noting nonetheless that such decreases 
did still occur in the 48 weeks after starting treatment with E/C/F/TAF. The FRAX analysis also 
suggested a benefit for E/C/F/TAF over STB as did various biomarkers for effects on bone. 
On switching from TDF to TAF it could be expected that AE rates could be higher compared to those 
who remained on regimens that were previously tolerated. The difference in rate of AEs considered to 
be drug-related by investigators after switching may have been affected by the open-label design. The 
difference seems to have been driven by gastro-intestinal AEs and there were few Grade 3 or 4 events. 
Fractures were reported in 1.5% E/C/F/TAF vs. 0.6% FTC/TDF+3rd Agent groups but at Week 48 there 
were increases from baseline in mean BMD at the hip or spine in the E/C/F/TAF group compared to no 
appreciable change in those who did not switch. The FRAX analysis also suggested some benefit from 
switching. 
Overall, the renal safety profile of TAF appears to be better than that of TDF, which may be ascribed to 
the lower plasma TFV levels.  
In the Phase 3 studies in previously ART-naïve patients E/C/F/TAF was associated with higher rates of 
abnormal fasting lipids, including Grade 3 and 4 abnormalities, than STB. Similarly, higher rates of 
abnormal fasting lipids were observed in those who switched to E/C/F/TAF vs. those who maintained a 
TDF-containing regimen. The difference between TAF and TDF-containing regimens likely reflects the 
known lipid lowering effect of TFV and the much lower plasma levels of TFV in those given E/C/F/TAF. 
Overall, the benefits in terms of renal and bone effects appear to outweigh any concerns there may be 
regarding the lipid profile. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Thus far there have not been any cases of PRT or Fanconi’s syndrome in patients treated with 
E/C/F/TAF. It remains to be seen whether very long term exposure to low plasma levels of TFV will be 
associated with tubulopathy. 
Hyperuricaemia has occurred at higher rates with E/C/F/TAF although no AEs were related to abnormal 
uric acid. This issue will be kept under monitoring. 
Current data do not suggest that the nonclinical findings translate into a concern regarding the ocular 
safety of TAF. However, this issue is to be monitored as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
The applicant proposes use of E/C/F/TAF in patients aged from 12 years and weighing at least 35 kg. 
The number of adolescents exposed is small but the PK analyses suggest similar exposure and the 
safety profile appears mostly comparable with that in adults in terms of the range of AEs reported. MD 
Z-scores did not change notably from baseline through Week 24, indicating that bone mineralisation 
occurred at rates consistent with those of the reference population. Use in adolescents is supported but 
it is recommended that special attention is paid to safety in this population in the post-authorisation 
phase.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
E/C/F/TAF has been shown to achieve high virologic suppression rates in the ART-naïve and to support 
maintenance of suppression after switching from successful regimens. The safety profile for the most 
part is similar or improved vs. that of STB, especially with evidence of lesser negative effects on renal 
function and bone mineralisation density. The fact that lipid abnormalities are more likely to occur with 
TAF then TDF does not impact on the overall conclusions on safety since the rates observed are in line 
with those that occur with other commonly used ART regimens. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The fixed dose combination EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF offers a new single tablet treatment option with a high 
efficacy. Single tablet regimens are known to support patient’s acceptance and compliance. The 
improved renal safety profile allows the administration in patients with estimated creatinine clearance 
> 30 ml/min and no dose adjustments are required. However the potential risk of nephrotoxicity from 
chronic exposure cannot be excluded and deserves to be monitored. Based on the evaluation of 
quality, efficacy and safety data the benefit-risk balance is favourable. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Genvoya in the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 
years and older with body weight at least 35 kg) infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 
1) without any known mutations associated with resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, 
emtricitabine or tenofovir is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the  marketing 
authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation

updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the non-clinical and clinical properties of the active substance, 
the CHMP considers that tenofovir alafenamide which is a derivative of tenofovir disoproxil (both 
prodrugs of tenofovir) is qualified as a new active substance as it differs significantly in properties with 
regard to safety and efficacy from the previously authorised substance. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0026/2014 and the results of  the only available study (GS US 292 
0106) is reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package 
Leaflet.

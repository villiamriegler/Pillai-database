2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are the most common subtypes of non-
melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), with BCC accounting for approximately 80% of NMSCs1. Exact 
incidence of BCC is unclear due to lack of a cancer registry for this condition. However, a systematic 
review on the worldwide incidence of BCC reported studies that showed that the rates of BCC have 
increased at a similar rate over the past four decades, on average increasing by 20 ⁄100 000 person- 
years every 15 years, a 5.5% increase per year, varying greatly between the different countries.1. 
There are at least 6 major histological variants of BCC, including nodular (classic), superficial, 
micronodular, morpheaform (sclerosing), infiltrating, and baso-squamous, with difference in behaviour 
(aggressive vs. less aggressive disease)2. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, ionizing radiation, or to 
certain chemicals are known risk factors for developing basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Other risk factors 
for developing BCC are non- or hypo-coloured skin, old age, male gender, prior cancer of the skin, 
long-term or severe skin inflammation or injury, xeroderma pigmentosum, psoriasis and reduced 
immunity. 
BCC is usually amenable to local therapy with recurrence rates varying from 5% to 14% after initial 
resection3. A small proportion of BCCs may progress to an advanced state with considerable morbidity 
from local tissue invasion and destruction particularly on the face, head, and neck, causing severe 
disfigurement4. The incidence of mBCC is extremely rare, with frequencies ranging from 0.0028% to 
0.55% of all BCC cases5, often involving regional lymph nodes (40-83%), lung (35-53%), bone (20-
28%), skin (10-17%), and liver6. Based on a recent review of 100 mBCC cases, median survival after 
mBCC diagnosis was 54 months, with shorter survival in patients with distant metastases versus those 
with regional metastases (24 vs 87 months)7.  
BCC can be present as a sporadic as well as part of a rare inherited autosomal dominant condition, so-
called Gorlin syndrome or nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), caused by inactivating 
mutations in the Patched 1 gene (PTCH1). Loss of function of PTCH1 results in uncontrolled Hedgehog 
(Hh) signal transduction, which is linked with the development of BCC. Most cases of sporadic BCCs 
are also considered to harbour activating mutations in either PTCH (90%) or Smoothened (10%, SMO)

genes. As a consequence most BCCs are expected to be dependent on this Hh signalling for growth 
and progression. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is one of the key regulators of development 
and morphogenesis in mammals. Hh signaling is strictly controlled during cellular proliferation, 
differentiation and embryonic pattern formation. Mutations that constitutively activate the pathway, 
such as Smoothened (Smo), are linked to tumour formation. During the G0-phase (resting phase) of 
the cell replication cycle, the activity of Smo is blocked by Patched (Ptch), the Hh-ligand specific cell 
surface receptor. Aberrant activation of Smo as a consequence of loss-of-function mutations of Ptch or 
gain-of-function mutations of Smo is associated with development of several tumour types, including 
non-melanoma skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC).  
Treatment options available for BCC include surgery (including Mohs micrographic surgery), 
photodynamic therapy, Imiquimod, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), radiotherapy. Treatment of metastatic 
disease has been mainly palliative since regimens using radiation, surgery, and chemotherapy have 
typically been ineffective. Vismodegib (Erivedge), an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the 
Hedgehog pathway, was recently approved for the treatment of “patients with symptomatic metastatic 
basal cell carcinoma or locally advanced basal cell carcinoma inappropriate for surgery or 
radiotherapy”.  
Sonidegib is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the Hh signalling pathway. It binds to Smoothened 
(Smo), a G protein coupled receptor like molecule that positively regulates the Hh pathway and 
eventually activates and releases glioma associated oncogene (GLI) transcription factors which induces 
the transcription of Hh target genes involved in proliferation, differentiation and survival. Aberrant Hh 
signalling has been linked to the pathogenesis of several types of cancer, including basal cell 
carcinoma (BCC). Sonidegib binding to Smo will inhibit Hh signalling and consequently block signal 
transduction. 
The applicant applied for a marketing authorisation for the following indication:   
Odomzo is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: 
• 
Locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) who are not amenable to curative surgery or 
radiation therapy. 
Metastatic BCC. 
• 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is: Odomzo is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) who are not amenable to curative 
surgery or radiation therapy. 
Odomzo should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of a specialist physician experienced in 
the management of the approved indication. 
The recommended dose is 200 mg sonidegib taken orally once daily at least two hours after a meal 
and at least one hour before the following meal, at the same time each day. 
Treatment should be continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity 
develops. 
Dose modifications for creatine phosphokinase (CK) elevations and muscle related adverse events are 
presented in section 4.2 of the SmPC 
Management of severe or intolerable adverse reactions may require temporary dose interruption (with 
or without a subsequent dose reduction) or discontinuation. 
When dose interruption is required, consider resuming Odomzo at the same dose after resolution of 
the adverse reaction to ≤ grade 1. 
Page 10/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If dose reduction is required, then the dose should be reduced to 200 mg every other day. If the same 
adverse drug reaction occurs following the switch to alternate daily dosing and does not improve, 
consider discontinuing treatment with Odomzo. 
Due to the long half-life of sonidegib the full effect of a dose interruption or dose adjustment of 
sonidegib on several adverse events is expected to generally occur after a few weeks (see section 5.2).

Formula: C26H26F3N3O3.2H3PO4; Molecular weight: 681.49 
The chemical structure of sonidegib diphosphate was inferred from the synthetic route and confirmed 
by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, UV spectroscopy, elemental 
analysis and XRPD. 
Sonidegib diphosphate is a white to slightly yellow crystalline, non-hygroscopic powder, practically 
insoluble in aqueous media from pH 1 to 7.5, slightly soluble in acetone, and sparingly soluble in 
alcohols. Control of particle size by milling is required for adequate dissolution due to the low aqueous 
solubility. 
The active substance is achiral. Multiple polymorphic forms have been identified. Crystallographic data 
indicate that the proposed commercial polymorph is a co-crystal of sonidegib monophosphate and 
phosphoric acid. It is the thermodynamically stable form, but does interconvert with a second form in 
which the co-crystallised phosphoric acid molecule is removed in the presence of water. This 
conversion occurs during the wet granulation step employed in finished product manufacture. 
However, since the solubility of both polymorphic forms in physiologically relevant media is equivalent, 
there is no impact on product performance. In addition, the applicant has demonstrated methods to 
characterise and distinguish between the two forms in the isolated active substance. 
Sonidegib diphosphate is considered to be a new active substance. It is neither an active metabolite, 
nor a pro-drug of any other active substance authorised within a medicinal product in the EU. 
Page 11/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Sonidegib diphosphate is synthesized convergently in four main steps by five manufacturers using 
well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. The starting materials were re-defined 
during the procedure in order to resolve a major objection. Several genotoxic compounds are produced 
during manufacture and these are limited below the threshold of toxicological concern in the 
intermediates, and shown to be purged by the process conditions. The crystallisation conditions ensure 
the correct polymorphic form of the co-crystal active substance is produced and subsequent 
micronisation affords sonidegib diphosphate with the required particle size distribution. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual examination), identity (IR, 
XRPD), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), heavy 
metals (ICP-MS), microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.), phosphoric acid assay (titration), particle size 
(laser diffraction), as well as clarity and colour of solution (both Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data on 25 batches of the active substance manufactured on pilot to commercial scale 
and used in clinical and stability studies is provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches of active substance from one of the proposed manufacturers 
stored in a range of packaging materials was provided. This included data on active substance stored 
in the intended commercial package (very tight packaging to exclude moisture – LDPE bag inside 
quadruple laminated foil pouch) for up to 18 months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines. In 
addition, active substance was stored in less tight (more permeable brown glass bottles) packaging 
under long term and accelerated conditions, as well as at 5 ºC. The following parameters were tested: 
appearance; identity, impurities, assay, loss on drying, clarity and colour of solution, and microbial 
limits (skip testing). Particle size was measured during the stability studies but since no changes were 
observed, this test is not listed in the re-test specifications. All parameters remained within 
specifications and no significant trends were observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch, but in a sealed 
container rather than a petri dish given the hygroscopicity of sonidegib diphosphate. Other than the 
observation that the colour of an aqueous solution intensified, there were no changes to any of the 
parameters. 
Page 12/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stress tests were carried out in the solid state at high temperatures at different humidities, and in the 
presence of oxygen. Studies were also carried out in hot aqueous solution without additive, with acid 
or with base and at ambient temperature with oxidant. Small amounts of degradation were observed 
at high temperature. Some degradation was observed in base and with oxidant, whilst significant 
degradation occurred under acidic conditions. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were shown to be stability indicating. 
The applicant provided a commitment to continue the stability studies up to the re-test date, and also, 
to carry out equivalent stability studies on batches of sonidegib diphosphate from the other 
manufacturer. Given that the manufacturing processes are the same, irrespective of the site of 
manufacture, this was considered acceptable.  
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of development was to produce an immediate release oral formulation of sonidegib 
diphosphate. The active substance has low density and poor flow properties and so a densification 
method was sought in order to produce a dosage form able to deliver the high doses required in early 
clinical studies. Direct compression and roller compaction methods were not suitable due to the poor 
flow properties and inherent low solubility of the active substance. Thus, a wet granulation process was 
investigated. The active substance converts to a different polymorphic form in the presence of water, 
losing the co-former phosphoric acid molecule from the crystal lattice in the process and thus being 
converted to sonidegib phosphate. This conversion was shown to occur during wet granulation, but 
does not impact on the dissolution of the active moiety. Sonidegib diphosphate also exhibits poor 
wettability and stuck to the vessel walls during granulation unless two surfactants (poloxamer and 
sodium lauryl sulfate) were added to the blend. Crospovidone was also incorporated to aid 
disintegration of the granules in vivo. Magnesium stearate (lubricant) and colloidal anhydrous silica 
(glidant) were added following granulation in order to improve the flow properties of the granules for 
encapsulation. Compatibility of the active substance and excipients was demonstrated by stability 
studies using binary mixtures at various temperatures. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used 
in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
During studies into the granulation process, amount of water, addition rate, and mixing time were 
found to impact the fines content and polymorphic form of the active substance. These parameters 
were optimised in order to maximise dissolution rate and improve the flow properties for 
encapsulation. The batch size for the encapsulation process was optimised in order to combat the 
stickiness of the bulk powder blend. 
Various formulations were used throughout the clinical programme including a powder for oral 
suspension, tablets, a solution for oral suspension and the final hard gelatin capsule formulation. 
Pivotal clinical studies were carried out using the same hard gelatin capsule formulation intended for 
marketing. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated by comparison of typical 
batches with those containing less disintegrant, manufactured using different granulation processes, or 
with active substance of a larger particle size. A two tier method is used for the dissolution test at 
Page 13/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shelf-life due to the impact of gelatin cross-linking, a well-known phenomenon which occurs on storage 
over time. 
The  primary  packaging  is  PCTFE/PVC/Alu  blisters.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  four  main  steps:  wet  granulation  of  the  active  substance  with 
intra-granular  excipients  and  drying;  milling  and  blending  with  extra-granular  excipients; 
encapsulation;  packaging.  Holding  times  for  final  blend  (up  to  6  weeks)  and  bulk  capsules  (up  to  12 
months)  have  been  justified  with  the  appropriate  stability  data.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a 
standard  manufacturing  process.  The  in-process  controls  are  considered  adequate  for  production  of 
hard gelatin capsules. 
The  manufacturing  process  will  be  validated  on  full  production  scale  before  commercialisation.  The 
validation protocol is considered adequate. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and 
comprise tests for appearance of capsule and contents (visual inspection), identification (UV, uHPLC), 
water content (KF), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), degradation products 
(uHPLC), polymorphic content (XRPD), assay (uHPLC) and microbiological contamination (Ph. Eur.).  
Batch analysis results are provided for nine commercial scale (and higher) batches used in clinical and 
stability studies, and for registration, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), for up to 24 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 
75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The stability batches were identical (including primary packaging) to those 
proposed for marketing proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for appearance of capsule and 
contents, water content, dissolution, degradation products, polymorphic content, assay and 
microbiological contamination. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. No significant changes to any of the tested parameters were 
observed indicating that the product is photostable. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 24 months stored below 30 oC as stated in the SmPC 
is acceptable.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical pharmacology studies were carried out in vitro and in vivo in compliance with GLP. 
Dose range finding studies do not all claim GLP compliance but were conducted in a GLP-compliant 
facility. The inhibition of signal transduction induced by Hh agonists was studied in several cell lines. 
The pharmacokinetic studies were performed in animal models of the rat, minipig, rabbit and dog using 
14C radiolabeled drug substance. The toxicokinetic measurements were performed as part of toxicity 
studies in rats, rabbits, and dogs. The plasma protein binding and blood distribution was investigated 
in the mouse, rat, dog, minipig and human. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In a competition binding assay, the IC50 in an agonist displacement assay was 11nM using human 
Smo and 7 nM in an antagonist displacement assay (RD-2007-50686). Using a cell-based reporter 
gene assay (RGA) in which mouse Leydig cells were transfected with luciferase cDNA under the control 
of Gli regulatory sequences, the IC50 was 4 nM and 37 nM compared to the reference antagonist 
compound NVP-BFQ150 (cyclopamine), used at the same concentrations, with an IC50 of 46 and 4757 
nM (RD-2007-50689).  
Page 15/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sonidegib was assessed for the ability to inhibit the proliferation of cells freshly isolated from mouse 
medulloblastoma as a biological effect model of Smo antagonism in cancers with a known relationship 
with Hh signalling. Allografts were generated in nude mice by injection of cells obtained from 
spontaneous tumours of transgenic mice with heterozygous deletion of Patched (Ptc) in combination 
with either homozygous deletion of p53 or heterozygous deletion of hypermethylated in cancer (Hic). 
Ex vivo cell proliferation was inhibited with an IC50 ranging from 6 to 9 nM (RD-2007-50807). 
Sonidegib also blocked Gli-1 expression in a human cell line from fetal mesenchymal origin with an 
IC50 of 12.7 nM (RD-2007-50858). 
The  effect  of  sonidegib  (batch  NVP-SONIDEGIB-NX3)  was  also  assessed  in  ex  vivo  cultures  of  skin 
punch  biopsies  taken  from  17.5  day  Ptc+/-  LacZ  mouse  embryos  or  newborn  mice,  exposed  to  the 
Smo  agonist  Hh-Ag-1.3  (1  µM),  which  give  rise  to  basaloid  nests  similar  to  human  basal  cell 
carcinoma.  Both  Hh  signal,  assessed  by  X-gal  staining,  and  basaloid  nest  formation  were  dose-
dependently inhibited by 0.15-1.5 µM sonidegib and by Curis Hh-Antag691, a known Smo antagonists. 
By  contrast,  cyclopamine  effect,  a  vegetable  alkaloid  able  to  inhibit  Hh  signal,  was  found  to  be  less 
active. Results are showed in the figure below.

cyclopamine in embryonic day 17.5 Ptch+/--LacZ mouse skin punches

Sonidegib  also  inhibited  Hh  signalling  and  induced  regression  of  basaloid  nests  when  skin  punch 
cultures  were  exposed  to  the  drug  7  days  after  induction  with  Hh-Ag-1.3.  Also  in  this  case  a  dose-
dependent activity similar to Curis Hh-Antag691 was observed, whereas cyclopamine showed very low 
potency (see figure below).

Hh signalling plays a pivotal role in the development and maturation of mouse hair follicle during 
embryogenesis and in anagen phase of hair follicles in the adult. For this reason the ability of sonidegib 
to interfere in vivo with Hh signaling was evaluated in a model of hair growth after depilation in 
C57BL/6 mice. One-hundred-fifty µL of 1 or 0.1 % solution of the drug, was topically administered in 
the depilated area, for up to 14 days. Results indicated that sonidegib effectively blocked anagen 
entrance only when given 3 days after the induction of the anagen phase by depilation (study 253-07). 
A later administration induced the recovery with a kinetic similar to that observed in the previous 
experiments after treatment with vehicle.  
Figure 3: 
Anagen development in C57BL7/6 mice treated from days 3, 5 or 8 on after 
depilation with 150 μl 1% sonidegib (Study # 253-07) 
Inhibition of hair re-growth and follicle associated Hh-target gene expression can thus serve as 
surrogate PD model for LDE225 (RD-2007-01671). Skin samples of mice treated with LDE225 had 
reduced cyclin D1 immunohistochemistry staining (RD-2007-50956).

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Study report RD-2007-50628  
The potential effects of sonidegib were tested in vitro on a panel of about 150 off-targets including G 
protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), ion channels, transporters and nuclear receptors. Different 
methods, such as ligand displacement or enzymatic assays, were used, depending on the target 
analysed. A panel of 68 potential off-targets was initially tested. None of them was inhibited for more 
than 50% with sonidegib concentration up to 10 µM. 
Sonidegib showed low activity in most off-targets in a panel of 150 G-protein-coupled receptors 
(GPCRs), transporters, ion channels, nuclear receptors and enzymes, linked to potential side effects. 
Activities of ≥50% inhibition at 10 µM were found in 4 assays: melatonin MT1 (Ki = 0.55 µM; EC50 = 
1.75 µM), CB2 (Ki = 6.5 µM), rat brain sodium channel type II (Ki = 0.75 μM) and rabbit monoamine 
transporter VMAT2 (IC50 = ~10 μM). These IC50’s and Ki’s are well above the free fraction Cmax of 
0.053 µM in humans.  
A further evaluation was performed on 82 additional off-targets. Only in four of them (Cannabinoid 
CB2, Melatonin MT1, Sodium channel Site 2, Monoamine transporter), sonidegib 10 µM induced a 
binding and/or activity inhibition higher than 50%. 
The effect of different sonidegib concentrations was assessed; for the monoamine transporter the IC50 
was around 10µM, for cannabinoid CB2 receptor the Ki was 6.5µM, for the melatonin MT1 receptor Ki 
was 0.55 µM and for the sodium channel Ki was 0.75 µM. Functional evaluation on MT1 showed a full 
agonist activity (EC50 1.75 µM) in inducing the binding of radiolabeled GTP whereas no effect was 
observed in the rat caudal artery ring contraction assay up to 30 µM.  
NVP-LGE899 (M48) was assessed for its off-target activity in a panel of 58 GPCRs, transporters, ion 
channels, nuclear receptors and enzymes. The compound did not show an activity of greater than 50% 
inhibition or activation at 10 μM on any of the targets. The compound was tested up to 30 μM on 35 
targets and activities of greater than 50% inhibition or activation were also not found at this 
concentration.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology in the central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular and respiratory systems 
has been investigated. Functional Observational Battery (FOB) was used to evaluate sonidegib effects 
on the central nervous system (CNS), in a study complying with GLP [Study Report 0770728]. No 
mortality was observed and no effect was reported regarding clinical signs, body weight variations and 
FOB. The effect of sonidegib on the cardiovascular system was evaluated in vitro [Study Reports 
0718501] in heart samples and in transfected HEK293 cells [Study report 0770726]. A concentration-
dependent reduction of the conduction velocity and of the coronary perfusion rate was observed. 
Sonidegib decreased hERG channel activity when used 0.5 μM (0.24 μg/ml) by 20.7 %. The total 
plasma steady-state Cmax in humans at 200 mg QD is 2.1 μM (Study sonidegib-A2201), and the free 
fraction in human plasma is 2.5%, so the free Cmax is 0.053 μM. Therefore, since the lowest potential 
exposure in the hERG assay of 0.5 μM is used to calculate multiple exposure, there is a 9-fold multiple 
exposure for hERG inhibition of 20% at a dose of 200 mg QD. The IC50 could not be assessed due to 
the solubility problems encountered. In vivo studies further evaluated the effect on the cardiac activity 
performed by telemetry recording of electrocardiogram (ECG) in two beagle dogs [Study report 
0670734 and 0770734]. RR interval was prolonged and heart rate was reduced; by contrast other 
parameters and morphology and rythm of the ECG were not modified.  Cardiovascular data from 
repeat dose toxicology studies showed no effects on cardiovascular parameters were seen in dogs in 
the 2-week oral dose range-finding study (0770601) at doses of 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg, in the 4-
Page 18/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
week study (0770733) at doses of 3, 12.5 and 50 mg/kg/day and in the 13-week study (0870705) 
at doses of 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg/day.  However, in the 26-week dog study at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 10 and 
50 mg/kg/day (1070055) minimal effects on cardiovascular parameters were seen at 50 mg/kg/day 
in both sexes.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted (see non-clinical discussion). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Non-clinical pharmacokinetics was investigated in the rat, dog, and minipig. Intravenous 
pharmacokinetics was examined in all three pre-clinical species; oral pharmacokinetics was examined 
in the rat and dog, and dermal pharmacokinetics was investigated in the mini-pig.  
The oral absorption and bioavailability of sonidegib were investigated in the rat [Studies R0700684-01 
and R1100109] and dog [Study R1100218].

plasma in rats and dogs 
Table 2: 
Mean pharmacokinetic parameters of sonidegib in plasma in rats and dogs 
afirst sampling time 
bmean of 2. 
In rats, comparison of blood levels of radioactivity and the AUCs following oral or intravenous dosing (2 
minute bolus) shows that absorption was 78%. In this study, after oral administration of 
[14C]sonidegib, the AUC for sonidegib was <1% of the total radioactivity exposure, with LGE899 
contributing >95% of the exposure. Clearance of sonidegib was moderate (1.08 L/h/kg) and the 
volume of distribution was large (4.8 L/kg). 
In dogs, after intravenous administration of [14C]sonidegib, radioactivity was measureable up to 504 h 
in plasma and up to 672 h (last sampling) in blood [Study R1100218]. The Cmax of total radiolabeled 
components occurred at 0.083 h (first time point) after dosing. The apparent terminal half-life was of 
76.4 ± 15.8 h in plasma and 189 ± 10.1 h in blood.  
Sonidegib was measurable up to 168 h post-dose in plasma. Cmax occurred at the first timepoint 
(0.083 h) post-dose and the apparent terminal half-life was 25.3 ± 8.70 h. Sonidegib had a large 
Page 19/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
volume of distribution (Vss) of 10.8 ± 4.5 L/kg. The plasma clearance was 0.476 ± 0.121 L/h/kg, and 
based on the in-vitro blood/plasma concentration ratio [Study R0700955-03], a blood clearance of 
0.865 ± 0.220 L/h/kg was estimated, ~50% of the liver blood flow.  
The ratio of the mean AUCs of sonidegib and its metabolite, LGE899, suggests that ~95% of total 
radioactivity in the systemic circulation is attributable to the carboxylic acid metabolite LGE899.  
Following oral administration of [14C]sonidegib, radioactivity was detectable in blood and plasma up to 
336-504 h post-dose. The Cmax for radioactivity was observed at 48 h post-dose. The terminal T½ was 
97.9 h in plasma and 124 h in blood, in the same range as after intravenous administration. Following 
oral administration of [14C]sonidegib, the parent compound was determined in plasma up to 336 h 
post-dose. The Cmax in plasma occurred at 48 h post-dose and the apparent terminal elimination half-
life of 30 h was similar to the value derived after intravenous administration (25.3 ± 8.70 h). The 
AUClast value was 21.6 h·μM.  
The tissue distribution of [14C] sonidegib-derived radioactivity was investigated in two studies using 
whole body autoradiography in pigmented male Long Evans Hooded (LEH) rats and in Hanover Wistar 
(HW) male rats.  
In the study R0700684, performed in rats, no information on LCS LOD is available, whereas in the 
study R1100218, performed in dogs, LOD was defined as 1.8 times the background value; the 
following values are provided: 14C-LOD (RA plasma): 10.9 nM (i.v.) and 154 nM (p.o.); 14C-LOD (RA 
blood): 12.9 nM (i.v.) and 145 nM (p.o.). 
Drug-derived radioactivity was associated with the melanin-containing tissues in the eye and 
pigmented skin. Affinity for melanin containing structures was shown by 8.9 fold higher concentration 
of total labelled components in the eye choroid of a LEH rat at 168 h post-dose when compared with 
an albino rat (R0700684-01). In the second study (R1100109), the concentrations of total radiolabeled 
components in the eye choroid, dropped from 29.7 μmol/kg at 168 h to 9.19 μmol/kg at 840 h, 
indicating that the uptake into melanin rich tissues is at least partially reversible. 
Measurable radioactivity concentrations in brain and spinal cord were observed through 7-days post-
dose with an approximate tissue/blood AUC value of 0.2, suggesting drug-derived radioactivity crossed 
the blood:brain barrier (Study R0700684-01). The radioactivity was also detected in testis of males 
through 168 hours post-dose with a tissue/blood AUC value of 0.34. 
The mean percent (%) of the plasma protein binding was high (97-99%) in the mouse, rat, dog, 
minipig and human, and there was no difference between the species tested. The binding was 
independent of concentration in all species tested. 
Following i.v. and oral administration, [14C]sonidegib was well absorbed and extensively metabolized 
such that only low levels of unchanged sonidegib were detected in excreta from rat, dog, and mini-pig 
(only i.v.). Thus, sonidegib was primarily eliminated via metabolism in nonclinical species and 
excretion of radioactivity occurred predominantly via feces (~75-90% of the dose in rat and dog; 
~49% of the dose in mini-pig). Only ≤  3% of dose was recovered in urine from rat and dog, and 
~29% of the dose in urine from mini-pig.  
The metabolic profiles in plasma, feces, bile (only rat), and urine from rat, dog, minipig and human are 
described below.

Figure 6: 
Proposed in vitro metabolic pathways of sonidegib 
Following i.v. and/or oral administration, the metabolites were primarily excreted in feces and/or bile 
from rat, dog and mini-pig (i.v. only).  
The urinary excretion of radioactivity was limited, accounting for < 2% of the dose in most species 
with the exception of mini-pig (~29% of the dose; i.v.). The major metabolites were M48 (LGE899) 
and M47e (acyl glucuronide) in urine from mini-pig, total accounting for ~13% of the i.v. dose.

In vitro assessment of covalent protein binding potential for sonidegib in rat and human 
liver microsomes and human hepatocytes  
The objective of this study was to determine if [14C]sonidegib has the potential to bind covalently to 
protein when incubated with rat and human liver microsomes or human hepatocytes. The results show 
that sonidegib is poor at binding proteins. 
Excretion of sonidegib was assessed using radiolabelled sonidegib in the rat, mini-pig, dog, and 
human. In all species most of the radioactivity was excreted as parent compound in the faeces.  
It is concluded that the signal for covalent binding of LDE225 observed in this study is weak and as 
liver has not been identified as a target organ, no further follow-up is requested. Metabolite NVP-
LGE899 (M48) does not show off-target activity in a panel of 58 GPCRs, transporters, ion channels, 
nuclear receptors and enzymes.

In the Ames test, treatment with sonidegib did not increase the revertant numbers of any of the 
bacterial tester strains used. In conclusion, sonidegib was not mutagenic. 
Sonidegib did not induce chromosome aberrations in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes, 
when tested to the maximum practicable concentration limited by precipitation in both the absence and 
presence of S-9. 
Sonidegib did not increase the number of cells containing micronuclei after 20-hour treatment ± S9, 
therefore sonidegib was not clastogenic or aneugenic. 
In the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus test by the oral route, sonidegib did not induce 
micronuclei in bone marrow cells of rats up to the maximum tested dose (2000 mg/kg/day). This 
indicates that the test item has no clastogenic and/or aneugenic potential in vivo under the test 
conditions used. 
Carcinogenicity 
The applicant did not submit carcinogenicity studies (see non-clinical discussion).

Fertility and early embryonic development 
In the fertility study in rats, LDE225 administered to female rats at 20 mg/kg resulted in a complete 
lack of fertility even though estrous cycling was within normal ranges and the precoital interval was 
comparable to concurrent controls. There was also a reduction of the number of pregnant females and 
a decrease in the number of viable fetuses at 2 mg/kg/day. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for 
female fertility was 0.2 mg/kg. For LDE225-treated males, the 20 mg/kg/day (high) dose did not 
impact the ability of the male rat to impregnate the untreated females and therefore, the 20 
mg/kg/day dose is considered the NOEL for fertility and reproduction in the male rat. 
Embryofoetal development 
In pregnant rabbits (gestation days 7-20) receiving daily oral doses of LDE225 10 mg/kg/day were not 
tolerated by pregnant rabbits as evidenced by abortion, moribundity and/or complete resorption of 
embryos/foetuses. The 5 mg/kg/day dose was not overtly toxic to the maternal animal, but resulted in 
resorptions and severely malformed foetuses. Teratogenic effects included severe craniofacial 
malformations (varying degrees of holoprosencephaly), vertebral, distal limb and digit malformations, 
anophthalmia and gastroschisis (open perineum). Embryofetal loss growth retardation and variations 
were also observed.  
In the pivotal study with lower doses, skeletal variations occurred at statistically increased fetal and/or 
litter incidences in all dose groups and included incomplete ossification of the frontal bone, 
metacarpals, cervical centrum, hyoid and interparietals. Unossified metacarpals and dumbbell 
ossification of the thoracic centrum also occurred at statistically increased fetal and/or litter incidences 
in the high dose group. Fetal drug concentration could be consistently measured in the high dose 
group, but not in the mid and low dose groups. However, the dose-dependent incidence of skeletal 
variations in the fetuses confirmed drug administration. 
The lowest dose of 5 mg/kg/day was without maternal toxicity and produced foetuses with numerous 
malformations, as well as reduced number of viable foetuses. Therefore, 5 mg/kg/day was chosen as 
the high dose in the pivotal study. The 5 mg/kg/day dose of LDE225 is considered the NOAEL for the 
maternal animal. LDE225 caused embryo-fetal toxicity (skeletal variations) at all doses, therefore a 
NOAEL for the foetus was not established in this study.

similar PK in adult and juvenile rats. 
NOAEL: 1 mg/kg/day 
In the juvenile toxicity study, similar findings have been seen as in adult rats, with the exception of the 
effect on the sciatic nerve and spinal cord. In juvenile rats these sciatic nerve and spinal cord findings 
may have been due to the early bone growth plate closure resulting in growth cessation causing 
compression on the still growing nerves and spinal cord. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic measurements were performed as part of toxicity studies in rats, rabbits, and dogs.  
Rat  
The toxicokinetics of sonidegib have been investigated in male rats (2 week studies) [Study 0670733] 
and [Study 0770715], and male and female rats (4, 13, and 26 week studies) [Study 0770732], 
[Study 0870704], and [Study 1070056]. In all studies, the exposure increased with dose, there was 
also evidence of sonidegib accumulation following repeated dosing. This increase showed a trend 
towards under-proportionality with increasing dose, but this was variable. In the 4 week rat study 
[Study 0770732] there was evidence of a sex difference, with females having higher exposure, but 
there was no evidence of a sex difference in either the 13 [Study 0870704] or 26 [Study 1070056] 
week studies.  
Dog  
The toxicokinetics in the dog (4, 13, and 26 week studies) [Study 0770733], [Study 0870705], and 
[Study 1070055] were similar to the rat. Increasing doses showed under-proportional increases in 
exposure in the 4 week toxicology study [Study 0770733], and over-proportional exposure in the 13 
[Study 0870705] and 26 week [Study 1070055] studies. There was no difference in exposure between 
male and female dogs, and there was evidence of accumulation (2- to 46-fold) following repeated 
dosing.  
Rabbit  
In the rabbit, toxicokinetic parameters were determined following oral dosing in pregnant female 
rabbits [Study 0970631]. Exposures in the maternal animal at the lowest dose could not be 
determined. Between the mid-dose (0.1 mg/kg) and the high dose (5 mg/kg) the exposure increased 
in an over proportional manner. Exposure of sonidegib in the fetus could only be demonstrated 
consistently from the high dose group, where the fetuses at 24h post dose were on average exposed 
twice more than the mean concentration found in plasma of the maternal animal. 
Local Tolerance and phototoxicity 
Local tolerance was assessed in several studies using topical application of sonidegib [study 0770162,  
0970682 and 0970680]. Two local lymph node assays, were performed in mice. No effect on lymph 
Page 30/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nodes was observed in either study, and no effect of UVA radiation was observed in the non-GLP study 
assessing photo-allergic potential. A slight increase in ear weight was seen in the non-GLP study at 
30% sonidegib, indicating a potential for skin irritation. However, no such effect was seen at up 62.5% 
sonidegib in the GLP assay. No clinical signs or local irritation were observed. 
Other toxicity studies 
The four genotoxic impurities 2-chloro-5-nitropyridine (C1), cis-2,6-dimethyl-4-(5-nitro-2-
pyridinyl)morpholine (C3), 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylboronic acid (Y4c), and 3,3’-(1,3-
diazenediyl)bis[2- methylbenzoic acid] (501-11) are below the threshold of toxicological concern of 1.5 
µg/day.  
The impurity triphenyl phosphine oxide has shown transient neural toxicity in dogs and limits were set 
based on a toxicological evaluation (TPPO limit 2012) at not more than 18 ppm in the final 
intermediate, sonidegib free base. 
Sonidegib exacerbated the severity of muscle toxicity induced by simvastatin in rats, but by itself had 
no effect on muscle. Sonidegib does not show synergistic toxic effects in cultures of human skeletal 
muscle cells after co-treatment combinations with simvastatin or pravastatin. 
Concurrent treatment with human parathyroid hormone (PTH) had some limited effects mitigating 
complete bone growth plate closure. These studies were for proof of concept only to suggest a possible 
intervention if pediatric patients were to receive sonidegib. This is not relevant for the adult BCC 
patient population.

The ERA submitted is considered incomplete.  The Applicant committed to revise the ERA and perform 
a number of environmental risk assessment studies (see non-clinical conclusions). 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacodynamic studies showed regression of tumour growth by inhibiting the Hh pathway in in 
vitro (mouse skin punches) and in vivo models (medulloblastoma tumour model).  Results from animal 
models suggest that for efficacy, sonidegib should achieve at least 80% Gli1 inhibition in the clinic.  
Sonidegib and main metabolite NVP-LGE899 (M48) do not show off-target activity in GPCRs, 
transporters, ion channels, nuclear receptors and enzymes at relevant concentrations in rat, dog and 
human. Sonidegib did not show important toxic effects on the central nervous-, respiratory- and 
cardiac systems of animals in safety pharmacology studies in rats and dogs. 
Non-clinical pharmacokinetics was investigated in the rat, dog, and minipig. Intravenous 
pharmacokinetics was examined in all three pre-clinical species; oral pharmacokinetics was examined 
in the rat and dog, and dermal pharmacokinetics was investigated in the mini-pig.   
In general, oral absorption appeared high in the rat (up to 78%) but was about half that in the dog 
(37.9%). The rate of absorption was moderate to low in the rat and dog with Tmax occurring at 4-48h 
following a single oral dose in ADME studies. Bioavailability in the dog was comparable to absorption, 
demonstrating little or no first pass metabolism.  
In the dog, plasma levels of sonidegib could be measured up to one week post dosing, and in the rat, 
elimination was more rapid with only very low concentrations measurable after 24 hours (T½ in rat 3.2 
h; in dog 25.3 h). The volume of distribution was large in both species: 10.8 L/kg (dog); 4.8 L/kg 
(rat). Following oral administration of radiolabeled sonidegib, drug related radioactivity was widely 
distributed to most tissues in rat. The highest tissue distribution was observed in the uveal tract, 
followed by the harderian gland, fat, liver, small intestine, adrenal cortex, and adrenal medulla. Drug-
derived radioactivity was associated with the melanin-containing tissues in the eye and pigmented 
skin. Uptake into melanin rich tissues was found to be at least partially reversible. Therefore, corneal 
disorders have been included as important potential risks. 
Measurable radioactivity concentrations in brain and spinal cord were observed through 7- days post-
dose, suggesting drug-derived radioactivity crossed the blood:brain barrier.  
The in vitro plasma protein binding of sonidegib ranged from ~97%-99% in all species tested and 
independent of the concentration. Sonidegib showed little or no affinity for blood cells.  
In all of the animals investigated, sonidegib was cleared primarily by metabolism with a preference for 
elimination in the faeces. Oxidations and oxidative cleavages (N/O dealkylation) in the morpholine ring 
appear to be the major metabolic pathways of sonidegib in all species. M48 (LGE899) was the 
prominent circulating metabolite with a long T½ in non-clinical species studied, and may account for 
the much longer T½ of radioactivity as compared to the T½ for the parent compound sonidegib. 
Especially in the rat almost all of the plasma radioactivity 24 hours after a single dose of radiolabeled 
sonidegib is traced as LGE899. This metabolite was not found to be pharmacologically active in vitro. 
In all species tested, the circulating levels of radioactivity were higher and measurable for longer than 
parent sonidegib. 
In rats and dogs most of [14C]-associated radioactivity was excreted in the faeces. Both after oral and 
after intravenous administration. After iv dosing very little of the radioactivity was recovered as parent 
drug. Very low percentage of radioactivity was recovered from urine. After 168 hour relatively high 
Page 33/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
percentage of radioactivity (10-15%) was still present in the carcass of rats, reflecting the long 
elimination time from tissues. 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted. This is acceptable as drug 
interaction studies were performed using biomaterials (see clinical pharmacology section). 
The majority of adverse effects of sonidegib can be attributed to its pharmacological mechanism of 
action on developmental pathways and effects in rats and dogs were similar. Most effects occurred 
close to the intended human exposures. These effects observed at clinically relevant exposures include 
closure of bone growth plates, effects on growing teeth, effects on the male and female reproductive 
tract, atrophy of the hair follicles with alopecia, gastrointestinal toxicity with body weight loss and 
effects on lymph nodes. At exposures well above the clinical exposure, an additional target organ was 
the kidney. The toxic effects occur at relatively low concentrations and are probably related to the 
pharmacological mechanism of sonidegib by Hh pathway inhibition. Effects on bone growth plates and 
teeth are not relevant for adult human patients, but the other target organs may be affected at the 
intended human exposure. However, only minimal decreases in platelet counts showed in a few 
animals, and there were no clinical or anatomic pathological findings attributable to this. The platelet 
decrease was attributed partially to bone marrow hypocellularity in two males, linked to poor body 
condition resulting e.g. from broken teeth.  
Sonidegib exacerbated the severity of muscle toxicity induced by simvastatin in rats, but by itself had 
no effect on muscle; however,  skeletal muscle effects was a main dose limiting toxicity in humans, 
(see also Clinical Safety). These findings were not observed in animals and the mechanism of this 
effect is not presently known.  
The applicant submitted genotoxicity studies which showed no mutagenic findings in the in vitro assays 
used (SmPC section 5.3).  
Another Smo inhibitor, compound vismodegib (Erivedge) induces pilomatricoma, hypothesized to be 
related to pharmacologically mediated disruption of hair follicle morphogenesis. Sonidegib induces 
irreversible hair follicle atrophy and this possibility should therefore to be taken into account. The 
applicant did not submit carcinogenicity studies, as per ICH S9 Guideline on nonclinical evaluation for 
anticancer pharmaceuticals. However, the proposed indication concerns patients which in most cases 
do not have a life-threatening disease, according to ICH S 9. Thus, carcinogenicity studies would be 
considered necessary and have been identified as missing information in the RMP. A meaningful 
exposure of sonidegib cannot be reached in rodents due to adverse effects on teeth, which reduced 
food consumption and hamper interpretation of any potential tumour findings. Therefore, the CHMP 
has imposed a post-authorisation measure to evaluate a subset of tissues from the 6 month rat study 
using KI-67 immunohistochemistry and to quantify cell proliferation. The results from the 
investigations on the 6 month rat study should be submitted by December 2016.  
In the 4-week dog study, in males effects in the testes and atrophy or delayed development of the 
prostate, and in females atresia or degeneration of ovarian follicles and immaturity of the uterus or 
delayed/arrested maturation were seen at doses of 50 mg/kg/day. These effects were not seen in the 
26-week dog study at the same dosage, while in the 4-week study the AUC0-24h were 26500-47900 
ng.h/ml and in the 26-week study were much higher, namely 350000-399000 ng.h/ml at day 22/23. 
Probably, this difference is caused by the younger age (6 months old) of the dogs in the 4-week study 
at the initiation of dosing than in the 26 week study (10-11 months old). In both  4- and 13-week 
studies including  recovery investigations, the  toxic effects were not reverted. Impaired fertility has 
been identified as an important potential risk. Small effects seen in animals on cardiovascular system, 
kidney and liver do not seem to be relevant for humans.  
Page 34/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prenatal and postnatal development studies have not been conducted with sonidegib as per the ICH S9 
Guidelines for the development of oncology drugs for use in advanced cancers. However, Hh inhibitors 
are known to have teratogenic potential and there is a risk of developmental toxicity. Exposure of 
sonidegib in the foetus could only be demonstrated consistently from the high dose group (and was 
twice that than what was found in the plasma of the maternal animal). Sonidegib was shown to be 
foetotoxic in rabbits, as evidenced by abortion and/or complete resorption of foetuses and teratogenic 
resulting in severe malformations at very low exposure. Teratogenic effects included vertebral, distal 
limb and digit malformations, severe craniofacial malformations and other severe midline defects. 
Foetotoxicity in rabbits was also seen at very low maternal exposure. There was reduced fertility at low 
exposure in female rats. For sonidegib treated male rats, exposure at approx. 2 fold the clinical 
exposure did not impact male fertility (SmPC Section 5.3).This is expected considering the 
fundamental role of Hh signalling pathway in embryonic development.   Post-natal development 
defects have been identified as important potential risks.  This has been properly stated in the SmPC 
sections 4.4 and 4.6.  
Local tolerance and photoxicity were evaluated in mice and rabbits, respectively. A treatment-related 
effect was not observed in either species. Tests in rabbits revealed that sonidegib is not a skin or eye 
irritant. Sonidegib has no phototoxic potential as tested in the 3T3 assay. It can be concluded that 
sonidegib is not considered to have contact (photo) allergenic potential and is not a lymph node.  
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the non-clinical studies (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology), submitted for 
the marketing authorisation application for sonidegib, were considered adequate and acceptable for the 
assessment of non-clinical aspects. However, considering that BCC is - in the great majority of cases - 
not life threatening, carcinogenicity studies should be performed.  
Non-clinical studies have confirmed that there is a risk of developmental toxicity and teratogenicity to 
the foetus following administration of sonidegib in animals. The risk of developmental toxicity and 
teratogenicity are adequately addressed in the SmPC and RMP. In addition, based on the results from 
the non-clinical toxicity studies, the CHMP has imposed the implementation of educational material in 
order to ensure that patients and HCPs are aware of the potential risks to the foetus and the 
requirement to use effective contraception while using sonidegib. 
The CHMP considers the following post-authorisation measures necessary to address the non-clinical 
issues: 
1.  A carcinogenicity study to perform an evaluation of a subset of tissues from the 6-month rat study 
using KI-67 immunohistochemistry and to quantify cell proliferation. 
The CHMP recommends the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues:

Summary of Phase I and Phase II clinical studies with PK and PK/PD 
components for sonidegib in patients 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology program for sonidegib consists of basic pharmacokinetic (PK) studies 
conducted in healthy subjects (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, drug-drug 
interaction, food effect and relative bioavailability, and PK in Japanese subjects). Single- and multiple-
dose properties of sonidegib have been evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumours or BCC. 
Further across study analyses have been performed: population PK analysis, exposure-efficacy and 
exposure-creatine phosphokinase (CK) relationships in patients, PK-QTc relationships in patients and 
healthy subjects.  
Additionally, in vitro studies with human biomaterials were performed in order to assess the potential 
of sonidegib to act either as a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug 
transporters. 
Descriptive statistics of pharmacokinetic parameters included mean, SD, %CV, geometric mean, %CV 
of geometric mean, minimum and maximum. When a geometric mean was presented it was stated as 
such. For Tmax, median values and ranges were given. 
Absorption 
Study A2110, was a single-dose study to determine the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion (ADME) of sonidegib in healthy subjects after an 800 mg oral dose containing a tracer 
amount of [14C]sonidegib (~74kBq). Figure 7 shows that sonidegib is rapidly absorbed showing a 
median Tmax of 2 hours (range 2 to 4 hours).  Cmax of sonidegib after an 800 mg dose was 154 ± 33 
ng/ml. After peak plasma concentration, sonidegib concentration declined rapidly by factor of ~5 till 24 
hours, followed by a slow terminal phase with a mean T1/2 of 319 hours (~13 days).

components (radioactivity; blood and plasma), sonidegib (LDE225 plasma) 
and metabolite LGE899 (plasma) after a single oral dose of 800 mg 
[14C]sonidegib in 6 male subjects (study A2110) 
•  Bioavailability 
Sonidegib is poorly water soluble at pH>2 solubility is <0.0002 mg/ml. In the absence of an 
intravenous formulation for human use due to the poor aqueous solubility, the absolute bioavailability 
of sonidegib could not be determined.   
An oral absorption of 5% was estimated by the percentage of metabolites recovered in urine and 
faeces in Study A2110.  
Based on low solubility and low absorption under fasted conditions and moderate permeability in vitro, 
sonidegib can be classified as a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class II compound. 
• 
Influence of food 
Study A2114 investigated the effect of a high fat meal on the PK of sonidegib 800 mg capsule in 
healthy subjects. Subjects in the fasted arm underwent overnight fasting for at least 10 hours before 
dosing and fasting for additional 4 hours post-dose. Subjects in the fed arm also underwent overnight 
fasting for at least 10 hours before receiving a high-fat breakfast (approximately 1000 calories, with 
50% of calories from fat). Within 30 minutes of the start of meal, the subjects in the fed arm received 
an 800 mg sonidegib dose and remained fasted for 4 hours post-dose.  
Absorption of sonidegib was delayed by 3 hours (median Tmax, fasted 2 hours vs Tmax, fed 5 hours) 
after a high-fat breakfast. Table 13 shows that the mean systemic availability of sonidegib is increased 
when given with a high fat meal (7.78-fold and 7.38-fold increase in Cmax and AUCinf). Elimination 
half-life was not affected by food intake. Administration of sonidegib after a high-fat meal also reduced 
Page 38/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the inter-individual variability of Cmax and AUClast, 23% vs 60% and 43% vs 65%, respectively. 
Table 13: 
Effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of sonidegib 800 mg (study A2114) 
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F) based on a population PK analysis was 
9170 L.  
The fraction of sonidegib bound to human plasma proteins in vitro is approximately 97.5% and is 
independent of concentration from 1 ng/mL to 2500 ng/mL. Sonidegib binds to serum albumin and α1-
acid glycoprotein. Binding of [14C]sonidegib to α1-acid glycoprotein was dependent on the protein 
concentration and resulted in the mean unbound fractions of 7.64%,3.58%, and 0.810% at the AGP 
concentrations of 0.5, 1 and 5 g/L, respectively. 
Sonidegib showed little affinity for blood cells. 
Sonidegib accumulated in skin tissue over time: skin/plasma ratio increased from 3 to 6-fold 
comparing day 29 to day 85 (study B2209).  
Elimination 
Apparent clearance (CL/F) in cancer patients was 10 L/h (90% prediction interval: 3.6, 27.5 L/h) as 
predicted by popPK. The geometric mean T1/2 in cancer patients was estimated 28.3 days (90% 
prediction interval: 7.0, 120 days). 
Following single dose administration in healthy volunteers, CL/F measured by non-compartmental 
methods was 45-76 L/h for the 200 mg dose (studies A1102 and A2114) and a terminal elimination 
half-life of 7-10 days. PopPK analysis estimated a  CL/F of 35 L/h and an elimination half-life of 8.7 
days. 
Excretion 
Study A2110 was a single-dose study to determine the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion (ADME) of sonidegib in healthy subjects after an 800 mg oral dose containing a tracer 
amount of [14C]sonidegib (~74kBq).   
Page 39/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On average less than 2% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine. Sonidegib was not 
detected in urine. Unchanged sonidegib in faeces 0-504 hours accounted for 88.7% of dose. Recovery 
of radioactivity across the 0-504 hour time interval amounted to 93.3% of dose (when excluding both 
urine and feces of Subject 00003). In the period of 0-504 hours, 3.3% and 1.2% of the administered 
dose was excreted in faeces and urine in the form of metabolites. 
Metabolism 
In vitro 
The metabolic profile of sonidegib was determined in human liver microsomes and contributions of the 
individual cytochrome P450 enzymes and flavin monooxygenase (FMO) enzymes to sonidegib 
metabolism were evaluated using recombinant human enzymes. Selective inhibitors of CYP enzymes 
were used to identify the major metabolic enzymes in human liver microsomes (study DMPK 
R0800034). 
The predominant metabolic pathways of sonidegib metabolism in human liver microsomes (HLM) were 
formation of the metabolites: M50, M51, M53, and M25 [DMPK R0800034]. No direct or secondary 
glucuronidation was observed in HLM in the presence of the co-factors for glucuronidation (UDPGA) 
and CYP enzyme mediated metabolism (NADPH). Evaluation of sonidegib metabolism by fifteen 
individual recombinant human CYP enzymes and three flavin monooxygenase (FMO) enzymes found 
only the CYP enzymes, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 capable of metabolizing sonidegib. Ketoconazole and 
azamulin (inhibitors of CYP3A) inhibited total sonidegib metabolism in HLM by a maximum of 89-96% 
with IC50 values in-line with the median reported Ki or IC50 values for inhibition of CYP3A by these 
compounds. Other CYP selective inhibitors did not inhibit sonidegib metabolism to the reported IC50 
values for that specific CYP inhibition. 
The proposed metabolic pathway of sonidegib is presented in Figure 8. 
Figure 8: 
Overview of identified metabolic pathways for sonidegib 
Page 40/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
In vivo 
In mass balance study A2110, Cmax of sonidegib amounted to 76.6±4.4% (mean±SD) of Cmax of 
total radioactivity in plasma and AUCinf of sonidegib accounted for 34.9±6.6% (mean±SD) of the 
AUCinf of total radioactivity in plasma.  
Metabolite profiles (14C-chromatograms) in plasma were determined in pools across all six subjects at 
four selected time points (4, 16, 120 and 504 hours). The recovery of radioactivity after sample 
preparation was essentially complete (estimated at 96.2-104%). Seventeen metabolites, amounting 
for 88.9% of the total radioactivity, were identified in plasma. Four metabolites of sonidegib were 
determined in more detail: the amide hydrolysis product LGE899 (metabolite M48), its acyl glucuronide 
CMN964 (M47e) and the oxidative morpholine cleavage products LMV128 (M23) and LNC119 (M16). All 
metabolites found in plasma were approximately 4- to 90-fold less potent than sonidegib and 
represented less than 40% of sonidegib exposure in plasma.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
After a single oral dose of the sonidegib capsule intended for commercial use in the range of 200 to 
1200 mg in healthy subjects in Study A1102 (Japanese), Study A2108, and Study A2114, the Tmax 
was approximately 2 hours (Table 14). Exposures as represented by maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) and various areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCs) generally increased less 
than dose proportionally in the tested dose range. 
Page 41/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 14: 
Summary of PK parameters after a single dose of 200 to 1200 mg sonidegib 
(capsule) in healthy subjects by study (CLDE225A1102, CLDE225A2108, 
CLDE225A2110, CLDE225A2114) 
In study X2101, after a single oral dose of 100 mg to 3000 mg in the PK run-in period, the median 
Tmax occurred at 2 to 4 hours. After repeated dosing for 2 weeks, the median Tmax occurred at 2 to 
13 hours. Mean plasma exposure to sonidegib appeared to increase approximately dose-proportionally 
up to 400 mg, but less than proportionally above 400 mg Twice-daily dosing with 400- and 750-mg bid 
dosing resulted in AUC was 18-30% higher than with the equivalent once-daily dose. Figure 9 shows 
that elimination half-life was independent of dose as illustrated by parallel decline in plasma 
concentration for all doses.

Time dependency 
The pharmacokinetics of sonidegib is not time-dependent in the popPK model.  
In Study A2201, the mean plasma concentrations of sonidegib and LGE899 continued to rise until 
Week 13 to Week 17 following daily administration of sonidegib 200 mg and 800 mg. An approximate 
steady state appeared to be reached by approximately three months of starting sonidegib for both 
dose levels, which can be expected for a drug with a terminal elimination half-life of 28 days.  
Pharmacokinetics in the target population  
A population PK model was developed to characterize the PK of sonidegib after multiple doses in cancer 
patients, also including the full PK profiles from healthy subjects. The popPK structural model for 
sonidegib was a two-compartment disposition model with first order absorption with a lag. Dose-
dependent bioavailability was included. PopPK model estimated a 3 fold larger apparent clearance 
among healthy subjects compared to cancer patients 35 L/h vs 10 L/h, respectively. The terminal 
elimination half-life was estimated 8.7 days days in healthy volunteers vs 28 days in cancer patients. 
The comparison between healthy volunteers and patients may be confounded as pharmacokinetics in 
healthy volunteers were conducted following single dose administration only while most information in 
patients was obtained following multiple dosing,  the conditions with regard to meals was different 
(fasted or high fat meal conditions in healthy subjects, rather than 2 hours after a light breakfast as 
was instructed in the pivotal study), and most covariate categories (age, hepatic and renal function, 
intake of anti-acid drugs) were not equally distributed in healthy subjects and patients.  
The PK parameters for cancer patients are summarized in Table 15. The mean steady-state Cmax for 
200 mg QD was predicted as 1030 ng/mL, in good agreement with the mean Cmax concentration of 
1031 ng/mL on Week 17 for 200 mg QD that occurred 2 hours post-dose.

Population PK model-based PK parameter estimates for sonidegib in cancer 
patients 
Special populations 
A population PK analysis was conducted to estimate the impact of covariates on the apparent oral 
clearance of sonidegib. Incorporation of covariates in the popPK model led to a reduction in the inter-
individual variability of CL/F from 106% to 64.5%. Figure 10 displays the confidence intervals of the 
ratio for the covariates on clearance and on absorption.

factor (F) (considering BCC patients with 100 mg F=1) 
Impaired renal function 
Among 351 cancer patients included in the population PK analysis, 161 patients had normal renal 
function (CrCL ≥ 90 mL/min), while 129 patients had mild impairment at baseline (CrCL 60 to <90 
mL/min), 60 patients had moderate impairment (CrCL 30 to <60 mL/min), and 1 patient had severe 
(CrCL 15 to <30 mL/min) impairment. Baseline CrCL with range of 27.3 to 290 mL/min had no 
statistically significant effect on CL/F of sonidegib. The ratio of the apparent clearance at 118 mL/min 
(75th percentile of CrCL) to the apparent clearance at 71 mL/min (25th percentile of CrCL) was 
estimated to be 0.98 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.1) when other covariates are held fixed at their typical values. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Based on the popPK analysis, the apparent oral clearance for sonidegib was estimated to decrease with 
increasing baseline albumin levels. The ratio of the apparent clearance at 46 g/L (75th percentile for 
baseline albumin) to the apparent clearance at 40 g/L (25th percentile of baseline albumin) was 
estimated to be 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.91) when other covariates were fixed at their typical values. 
Baseline ALT and baseline total bilirubin had no significant effect on the apparent clearance of 
sonidegib. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Drug interaction with ketoconazole and rifampicin 
Study A2108 was a single-dose, parallel group, drug-drug interaction study to assess the effects of 200 
mg twice daily (bid) oral dose of ketoconazole and the effect of 600 mg once daily (qd) oral dose of 
rifampicin on the PK of a single 800 mg oral dose of sonidegib in healthy subjects. Ketoconazole and 
rifampicin were dosed from day 1 through day 14. At day 5 a single dose sonidegib 800 mg was 
administered.

Drug interaction with contraceptives 
Steady-state exposure following 200 mg sonidegib based on popPK analysis is AUC0-τ 22 µg.h/ml, 
Cmax,ss 1.0 µg/ml, Ctrough 0.89 µg/ml, t1/2 28 days. Based on an embryo-fetal development toxicity 
study in rabbits, the safe plasma concentration was set to 3 pg/mL. As estimated by popPK analysis, 
more than 95% of female patients of childbearing age are expected to have sonidegib levels below the 
threshold of 3 pg/mL at 20 months after ending treatment and after six months of condom use post 
drug discontinuation by male patients, less than 5% of healthy female partners are exposed to 
sonidegib concentrations above the safety threshold of 3 pg/mL.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
In vitro studies with human biomaterials were performed in order to assess the potential of sonidegib 
to act either as a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters.  
Sonidegib as substrate of enzymes (study DMPK R0800034) 
Evaluation of sonidegib metabolism by fifteen individual recombinant human CYP enzymes and three 
flavin monooxygenase (FMO) enzymes found only the CYP enzymes, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 capable of 
metabolizing sonidegib. Ketoconazole and azamulin (inhibitors of CYP3A) inhibited total sonidegib 
metabolism in HLM by a maximum of 89-96% with IC50 values in-line with the median reported Ki or 
IC50 values for inhibition of CYP3A by these compounds. Other CYP selective inhibitors did not inhibit 
sonidegib metabolism to the reported IC50 values for that specific CYP inhibition. 
Sonidegib as inhibitor of enzymes (study DMPK R0700986) 
Page 45/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sonidegib showed potent inhibition of CYP2B6 (unbound Ki = 0.007 μM) and CYP2C9 (unbound Ki = 
0.237 μM). For other CYP activities (1A2, 2A6, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5), very little or no inhibition 
was observed up to 100 μM sonidegib. 
Sonidegib as inducer (study DMPK R1200636) 
The potential for sonidegib to act as an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and/or CYP3A4 enzymes 
was evaluated in primary human hepatocytes of three individual donors using both mRNA 
quantification and CYP activity measurements. Human hepatocytes were treated with sonidegib at a 
concentration range of 0.5- 25 μM (approximate therapeutic Cmax and a range of 2 orders of 
magnitude) for 48 h in addition to positive control inducers (rifampicin, phenobarbital and 
omeprazole). Sonidegib (0.5-25 μM) did not induce CYP2C9 or CYP3A mRNA and activities (levels were 
< 2-fold) in the three donor hepatocytes. In the induction study in hepatocytes from 1 liver a ~2-fold 
increase in mRNA was observed but increase in activity of CYP1A2 was <1.5-fold. These effects were < 
20% of the positive control inducer responses.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
In clinical studies, Smo inhibition by sonidegib was studied by inhibition of the downstream Gli-1 mRNA 
expression in skin/tumour tissue in dose finding study X2101, study B2209 in patients with Gorlin 
syndrome and in a subgroup of patients with BCC in the pivotal study A2201.  
The exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety relationships for sonidegib were evaluated to support the 
dose decision for advanced BCC. 
• 
• 
An exposure-efficacy analysis was performed for laBCC and mBCC from the pivotal Study 
A2201. 
An exposure-CK analysis was performed for four patient studies A2201, B2209, X1101, X2101. 
Page 47/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
The risk of QTc prolongation was evaluated in the PK/ECG subgroup in the pivotal study, in a 
PK-QTc analysis using a pool of healthy subjects in Studies A1102, A2108, A2110, and A2114 
and a separate pool of patients in studies A2201, B2209, X1101, and X2101. 
Mechanism of action 
The applicant did not submit studies on mechanism of action (see non-clinical pharmacology). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Study X2101, a Phase I dose-escalation study, change in Gli1 mRNA expression from baseline in 
normal skin was the primary pharmacodynamics marker of sonidegib activity measured during the 
study. Skin tissues were collected at baseline and at Cycle 1 Day 28. Skin Gli1 expression was 
decreased by sonidegib treatment, and the magnitude of decrease correlated with sonidegib exposure 
as represented by Ctrough at Cycle 2 Day 1 (Figure 11). At 800 mg qd, 200 mg qd and 100 mg qd, 
mean Gli1 inhibition was 74%, 68%, and 29%, respectively. Paired tumour and skin biopsies available 
from 11 patients demonstrate that Gli1 inhibition in the tumour is similar to or more pronounced than 
that in the skin.

concentration after 28 days treatment in patients with solid tumours (study

Exposure-CK relationship 
An analysis of exposure-CK relationship was performed on pooled data for four studies in cancer 
patients included in the current submission (Studies A2201, X2101, X1101, and B2209). Figure 12 
Page 48/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shows that patients with grade 3 or 4 CK elevations had significantly higher exposure to sonidegib. 
PKPD modeling showed that sonidegib exposure evaluated by AUC, Cmax or Ctrough at Cycle 1 Day 15 
were all significantly correlated with the risk of grade-3 or -4 CK elevation, with increasing exposure 
associated with an increased risk of grade-3 or -4 CK elevation. The estimated mean (90% CI) 
probability of grade 3 or 4 CK elevation at the median Cmax for 200 mg qd was 0.039 (0.015, 0.097) 
and at the median Cmax for 800 mg qd was 0.112 (0.063, 0.192). Similar results were observed for 
AUC and Cmin. 
Figure 12: 
Relationships between sonidegib exposure and grade 3 or 4 CK elevation 
(PK/CK set) 
Exposure-QTc prolongation  
Non-clinical cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies did not show an increase in QTc or an increase 
in cardiovascular toxicity at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. No dedicated QTc prolongation 
study was conducted because steady-state concentration of sonidegib are higher than can be achieved 
by single dose administration. The PK-QTc analysis included the patient studies [Study A2201], [Study 
X2101], [Study X1101], [Study B2209] and separately, the healthy subject studies [Study A1102], 
[Study A2108], [Study A2110], [Study A2114].  
The analyses indicated that sonidegib does not produce a prolongation of QTcF; the 90% two-sided 
(95% one-sided) upper confidence limit never exceeded 10 msec at any time point. There was no 
correlation between sonidegib plasma concentrations and QTcF increase. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Study X2101 was a Phase I dose-escalation study of sonidegib to determine the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) when administered QD (100mg -3000mg) and bid (250, 400 and 750 mg) in a 28-day 
cycle to adult patients with advanced solid tumours that had progressed despite standard therapy or 
for which no standard therapy existed.  The MTD was determined to be 800 mg for the once daily 
regimen and 250 mg for the twice daily regimen. The most common DLT was increased CK. Grade 3 
and 4 CK elevations were not observed at dose levels below 800 mg on the QD schedule or 250 mg on 
the bid schedule in study X2101. Twice-daily dosing with 400- and 750-mg bid dosing resulted in AUC 
Page 49/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was 18-30% higher than with the equivalent once-daily dose but an increased tendency to cause grade 
3 or 4 CK elevations.  
The 200-mg once-daily regimen was selected for evaluation on the basis that it represented the lowest 
dose level tested that demonstrated preliminary evidence of anti-tumour activity and Gli-1 inhibition.  
Following the administration of a single dose of Odomzo (100 mg to 3000 mg) without food in patients 
with cancer, the median time-to-peak concentration (Tmax) was 2 to 4 hours. Sonidegib exhibited 
dose-proportional increases in AUC and Cmax over the dose range from 100 mg to 400 mg, but less 
than dose-proportional increases above 400 mg. There was no evidence of clearance change with 
repeated dosing based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis and estimated accumulation at 
steady state was 19-fold irrespective of dose. Steady state was reached approximately 4 months after 
starting sonidegib. The average steady state Ctrough for 200 mg was 830 ng/ml (range 200 to 
2400 ng/ml) in cancer patients. Compared to the fasted state, the Cmax and AUC of Odomzo 800 mg 
was increased 7.8- and 7.4-fold, respectively when the dose was given with a high-fat meal. 
Sonidegib has a long half-life (2-4 weeks). A profound food effect was observed for sonidegib 
exposure, sonidegib Cmax and AUCinf were increased 7.78- and 7.38-fold, respectively, when a single 
800 mg dose of sonidegib capsule was administered with a high-fat meal compared to a fasted state 
indicating that this type of meal affected the absorption but not the elimination of sonidegib. Findings 
from the study also revealed that patients have a 3-fold higher exposure of sonidegib compared to 
healthy subjects (tested under fasting conditions). The current recommendation is that sonidegib 
capsules should be taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal to avoid 
overexposure to sonidegib (section 4.2 SmPC). The current dosing recommendations in the SmPC 
section 4.2 reflect the dosing conditions applied in the pivotal study. Food interactions have been 
identified as important identified risks in the RMP. Further, the CHMP has imposed a post-authorisation 
measure to perform a comparative bioavailability study to evaluate timing of meal relative to dose and 
fasting conditions and effect of light meal (low fat meal). 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 351 patients who received oral doses of Odomzo in 
the dose range of 100 mg to 3000 mg, the apparent steady-state volume of distribution (Vss/F) was 
9170 litres. Steady-state level of sonidegib in the skin was 6-fold higher than in plasma. 
Sonidegib was highly bound to human plasma proteins (human serum albumin and alpha-1 acid 
glycoprotein) in vitro (>97%), and binding was not concentration-dependent from 1 ng/ml to 
2500 ng/ml. 
Sonidegib and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the hepatic route with 93.4% of the 
administered dose recovered in the faeces and 1.95% recovered in urine. Unchanged sonidegib in 
faeces represented 88.7% of the administered dose and was not detectable in urine. The elimination 
half-life (t1/2) of sonidegib estimated from population pharmacokinetic modeling was approximately 
28 days. As sonidegib is mainly eliminated by metabolism, therefore, reduced hepatic function may 
affect the exposure of sonidegib (SmPC section 5.2). Results of the interim report of study A2113 
showed that there is no substantial increase in the sonidegib exposure in the mild and moderate 
hepatic impairment group compared to the normal group. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary 
in patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment. The 
recommendations in section 4.2 of the SmPC for hepatic impaired patients is acceptable. The results of 
a study in severe impaired patients are awaited and in the meantime patients with severe hepatic 
impairment has been identified as missing information in the RMP. Further, the CHMP has imposed a 
post-authorisation measure to the applicant to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and protein binding of 
sonidegib in healthy subjects with normal hepatic function and subjects with impaired hepatic function. 
Page 50/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that there are no clinically relevant effects of age (range 
tested from 20 to 93 years, mean 61 years), body weight (range tested 42 to 181 kg, mean 77 kg), 
gender, or creatinine clearance (range tested 27.3 to 290 ml/min 290 ml/min, mean 92.9 ml/min) on 
the systemic exposure of sonidegib. The covariate effects of age, gender, and albumin levels were 
statistically significant, but the effects were <20% and were not considered clinically relevant for dose 
adjustment. Body weight and creatinine clearance had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sonidegib.  
The effect of renal impairment on the systemic exposure of sonidegib has not been studied. Since 
sonidegib is not renally excreted, no change in systemic exposure is anticipated in patients with renal 
impairment. A population pharmacokinetic analysis did not find significant influence of renal function 
(creatinine clearance >27 ml/min) on the apparent clearance (CL/F) of sonidegib suggesting that dose 
adjustment is not necessary in patients with renal impairment. The absence of data in severe renal 
impairment has been identified as missing information and is adequately addressed in the SmPC 
sections 4.2 and 5.2.  
The Cmax and AUCinf of sonidegib in Japanese healthy subjects were 1.56 and 1.68-fold higher, 
respectively, than those seen in Western healthy subjects for a single dose of 200 mg. Therefore, a 
dose adjustment based on ethnicity is not required but races other than Caucasians has been identified 
as missing information in the RMP. 
Overall the investigation for the potential of pharmacokinetic drug interaction has been reasonably well 
conducted. In vitro findings have been adequately followed-up by in vivo studies. Based upon the in 
vitro data, metabolism of sonidegib is mediated primarily by CYP3A4. Unchanged sonidegib 
represented 36% of circulating radioactivity and the major circulating metabolite (45% of parent 
exposure) identified in plasma is the hydrolysis product of sonidegib and is pharmacologically inactive. 
All the metabolites were deemed 4 to 90 times less potent than sonidegib. A drug-drug interaction 
study with CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole increased sonidegib exposure by 2.3 fold (90% CI 1.8-2.9 
fold). A drug-drug interaction study with rifampicin reduced sonidegib exposure by 72% (90%CI 65%-
78%).  The magnitude of the effects of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers could not be fully estimated as 
the effect of ketoconazole and rifampicin was determined up to 14 days, which is only a half of the 
elimination half-life and was conducted in healthy volunteers. Further, the simulations estimated a 2-
fold increase in sonidegib exposure for short term concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, i.e. 2 
weeks. Co-medication with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers were excluded in the pivotal study as 
a drug-drug interaction study A2108 showed that these drugs affected the exposure of sonidegib to a 
potentially clinical significant effect. Therefore, interactions with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP3A4 
inducers have been identified as important identified risks. Dose recommendations for sonidegib when 
co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors have been introduced in the SmPC in section 4.5.  
Based upon the in vitro data, sonidegib is a potentially strong inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2B6. 
Therefore, co-medication of drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have narrow therapeutic 
index was excluded from study A2201. This potential interaction has been adequately described in the 
SmPC in section 4.5. However, in vivo drug interaction has not been submitted. Therefore, the CHMP 
has imposed a post-authorisation measure on the submission of the Study LDE225A2112. A Phase Ib, 
multicenter, two parallel group, open label, drug-drug interaction study to assess the effect of 
sonidegib on the PK of bupropion (CYP2B6) and warfarin (CYP2C9) in patients with advanced solid 
tumours. Sonidegib is an inhibitor of BCRP transporter. The potential interaction has been described 
adequately in the SmPC in section 4.5 and 5.2. Sonidegib was not a substrate for OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3. This information has been adequately described in the SmPC in section 5.2. Sonidegib has 
shown pH-dependent solubility and dose-dependent bioavailability and therefore, a potential exists for 
differential effect of proton pump inhibitors depending on sonidegib dose. In the popPK model, a 30% 
lower exposure was predicted for patients taking PPIs as co-medication while co-medication with H2 
Page 51/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
receptor antagonist was predicted not to affect the exposure of sonidegib.  Therefore, a warning has 
been included in section 4.5 on the potential to alter the solubility of sonidegib and potentially reduce 
its bioavailability. In addition, the CHMP has imposed a post-authorisation measure to investigate the 
potential interaction of esomeprazole on the PK of sonidegib.  Interactions with sensitive CYP2B6, 
CYP2C9, and BCRP substrates with low therapeutic index and interaction with proton-pump inhibitors 
have been identified as important potential risks in the RMP. 
Sonidegib treatment is associated with creatine kinase elevations. Temporary dose interruptions are 
proposed for CK elevations and muscle related AEs or an increase in sonidegib dose if CYP3A4 inducers 
are coadministered (SmPC section 4.2). In study A2201, co-medication of HMG-CoA reductase 
inhibitors (statins), clofibrate, and gemfibrozil, which are also associated with muscle-related 
toxicity/rhabdomyolysis was excluded from the study or if it was essential that the patient stayed on a 
statin to control hyperlipidemia, only pravastatin was allowed to be used. Therefore, limited safety 
data are available for co-medication with statins and the available data is restricted to pravastatin. This 
is reflected in the SmPC in section 4.4 and 4.5. Muscle –related events have been included as 
important identified risks in the RMP. 
The sonidegib plasma concentration-QTc analysis showed that the upper bound of one-sided 95% 
confidence interval for QTc increase was below 5 msec at steady-state Cmax for 800 mg daily doses, 
which provide 2.3-fold plasma exposure compared with the recommended 200 mg dose. Therefore, 
therapeutic doses of Odomzo are not expected to cause clinically significant QTc prolongation. Further, 
sonidegib plasma concentrations above those achieved with the therapeutic doses were not associated 
with life-threatening arrhythmias or torsades de pointes. Tumour response was independent of 
Odomzo dose or plasma concentration in the dose range of 200 mg to 800 mg. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive, foetal and developmental toxicity (see non-clinical 
discussion). A drug interaction study with contraceptives will be difficult to conduct as the use of 
effective contraception has been recommended in the SmPC in section 4.4 and 4.6. Female patients of 
childbearing potential taking concomitant oral contraceptives have been identified as missing 
information in the RMP. Based on the non-clinical studies, the safe plasma concentration was set to 3 
pg/mL. As estimated by popPK analysis, more than 95% of female patients of childbearing age are 
expected to have sonidegib levels below the threshold of 3 pg/mL at 20 months after ending treatment 
and after six months of condom use post drug discontinuation by male patients, less than 5% of 
healthy female partners are exposed to sonidegib concentrations above the safety threshold of 3 
pg/mL. This has been communicated in the SmPC as well as in the educational material. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of sonidegib has been adequately characterised. The dose has been justified 
based on PK data and correlative data with the PD biomarker Gli expression, which is considered 
acceptable. In addition, the current dosing recommendation of taking sonidegib without food has been 
justified as it reflects the dosing conditions in the pivotal trial. However, the unexplained 3-fold 
difference in apparent clearance between cancer patients and healthy subjects and the high 
unexplained variability in sonidegib pharmacokinetics in patients is still of concern. Further, there is an 
uncertainty regarding the timing to food intake of sonidegib exposure. It is uncertain if patients not 
following the dosing recommendations as applied in the pivotal study are at risk of overdosing when 
taking sonidegib with a meal or at risk of underdosing when taken under fasted.  Therefore, and to 
provide more guidance for the dosing recommendations in the SmPC, the CHMP has imposed further 
investigation of how the exposure of sonidegib following the dosing recommendations in study A2201 
relate to the exposure under fasting conditions and fed conditions. 
Page 52/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology 
(see also RMP): 
1.  A comparative bioavailability study to evaluate timing of meal relative to dose and fasting 
conditions and effect of light meal (low fat meal). 
2.  Study LDE225A2112 A Phase Ib, multicenter, two parallel group, open label, drug-drug interaction 
study to assess the effect of sonidegib on the PK of bupropion and warfarin in patients with 
advanced solid tumours. 
3.  Investigation the potential interaction of sonidegib with esomeprazole (Study LDE225A2118). 
4.  Study LDE225A2113 A phase I, open label, multi-center, single dose study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics and protein binding of sonidegib in healthy subjects with normal hepatic function 
and subjects with impaired hepatic function. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
In the phase I X2101 trial conducted in patients with advanced solid tumours (103 pts) (median 
treatment duration: 50 days), sonidegib doses ranging from 100 mg to 3000 mg QD (100, 200, 400, 
800, 1000, 1500, 3000 mg), and from 250 to 750 mg BID (250, 400, 750 mg) or tablets (120, 160, 
220 mg) were administered.  
The MTD was determined to be 800 mg for the once daily regimen and 250 mg for the twice daily 
regimen. The most common DLT was increased CK. Grade 3 and 4 CK elevations were not observed at 
dose levels below 800 mg on the qd schedule or 250 mg on the bid schedule in study X2101. 
Preliminary evidence of anti-tumour activity (CR or PR) was observed in 6/16 patients with advanced 
BCC or 2/9 patients with medulloblastoma. There was no clear correlation with dose and anti-tumour 
activity. 
At the once daily MTD of 800 mg, mean Gli-1 inhibition (the primary pharmacodynamic marker chosen 
to assess the activity of the substance) was 74%, and at the once daily dose of 200 mg mean Gli-1 
inhibition was 68%. 
Figure 13 shows the individual change from baseline in Gli1 levels versus best overall response by 
treatment arm and BCC stage, in study A2201. For the 200-mg arm, median inhibition ranged from 
81.9% to 92.8% for patients with laBCC. In  the 800-mg arm, the median inhibition across visits was 
>95%. The intersubject variability in change of Gli1 expression was very high.

Figure 13: 
Strip plot of change from baseline in Gli1 levels versus best overall response 
by treatment arm and BCC stage (FAS) study A2201 
The 800 mg QD dose corresponded to the MTD observed in the X2101 study. However, based on 
preliminary anti-tumour activity with reported exposures in the predicted efficacious range in the great 
majority of patients and on the basis also of Gli-1 inhibition data, no further anti-tumour activity was 
found compared to the 200 mg QD dose.  Therefore, the dose of 200 mg was chosen for the main 
study.

pregnant, UNLESS they were using two forms of highly effective contraception, throughout the 
study and for 6 months after the last treatment. 
•  Sexually-active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for 6 
months after stopping sonidegib treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom 
was required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via 
seminal fluid. 
Treatments 
Sonidegib was administered orally, on a continuous once-daily schedule, at a dose of either 200 mg or 
800 mg. Sonidegib was supplied as 200-mg hard-gelatin capsules. The 200- mg arm received 1 
sonidegib capsule+3 placebo capsules and the 800-mg arm received 4 capsules of sonidegib. Placebo 
(batch number: X338MG) was formulated to be indistinguishable from the sonidegib capsules. 
All eligible, enrolled patients were randomized in a 1:2 ratio to treatment with either sonidegib 200 mg 
or sonidegib 800 mg on a continuous once-daily dosing schedule. 
Duration of treatment: Patients are to continue study treatment until documented disease progression 
(as confirmed by central review), discontinuation attributable to intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent, death, at the discretion of the investigator, or upon early termination of the study. 
Dose adjustments were permitted for patients who were unable to tolerate the protocol specified 
dosing schedule to keep the patient on treatment. In addition, dosing modifications were allowed in the 
event of toxicities suspected to be related to the study drug. 
For patients randomized to the 800-mg dose, a maximum of two dose-reduction steps were allowed. 
Patients taking 200 mg QD who required a dose reduction received placebo only as first reduction and 
discontinued from treatment if a second reduction was necessary. The following table describes the 
dose reduction steps. 
Table 19: 
Dose reduction steps for sonidegib 
For patients who underwent dose interruptions (delays), if the same toxicity returned after reinitiation 
of treatment, irrespective of duration, the second re-initiation was resumed at a lower dose. If the 
Page 57/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patient required a dose interruption of >21 days from the previous dose, then the patient was 
discontinued from study treatment. 
Medications required to treat AEs and manage cancer symptoms, concurrent stable disease (e.g. 
controlled hypertension) and supportive care agents such as erythropoietin, granulocyte growth 
factors, or blood transfusion, and pain medications were allowed (although use of growth factors, 
erythropoietin, blood transfusion or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [GCSF] was not permitted, 
until the patients had developed dose-limiting anemia or neutropenia). 
Sonidegib (200 mg hard-gelatin capsule or matching placebo, either 1 sonidegib capsule + 3 placebo 
capsules or 4 capsules of sonidegib) was to be taken with a glass of water over as short time as 
possible (e.g. 1 capsule every 2 minutes) approximately 2 hours after a light breakfast (e.g. consisting 
of juice, toast, and jam). Food intake was to be avoided for at least 1 hour after study drug 
administration. Patients were requested to avoid grapefruit, pomegranate, star fruit, and Seville (sour) 
oranges or relative juices during the study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of sonidegib as measured by ORR assessed by 
central review (for mBCC) and Independent Review Committee (IRC) (for laBCC) according to: 
•  mRECIST in patients with laBCC  
•  RECIST 1.1 in patients with mBCC 
Key secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
To determine the DoR as assessed by central review according to mRECIST in patients with laBCC 
and to RECIST 1.1 in patients with mBCC 
To determine the rate of complete response (CR) as assessed by central review according to 
mRECIST in patients with laBCC and to RECIST 1.1 in patients with mBCC 
Other secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the effect of sonidegib therapy on progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by 
central review according to mRECIST in patients with laBCC and to RECIST 1.1 in patients with 
mBCC 
To evaluate the time to tumour response (TTR), i.e. complete response (CR) or partial response 
(PR) as assessed by central review according to mRECIST in patients with laBCC and to RECIST 1.1 
in patients with mBCC 
To evaluate the effect of sonidegib therapy on ORR, CRR, DoR, PFS, TTR as assessed by 
investigator according to mRECIST in patients with laBCC and to RECIST 1.1 in patients with mBCC 
To further characterize the safety of sonidegib therapy 
To further characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of sonidegib by measuring trough (Cmin) plasma 
concentrations of sonidegib

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR determined by the IRC according to mRECIST for patients with 
laBCC and by central review according to RECIST 1.1 for patients with mBCC. All patients with laBCC 
were assessed with MRI scans and clinical photography, as appropriate. Patients with certain disease 
features, such as laBCC in difficult anatomical locations (e.g. auditory canal), may not have been 
suited for color photography. Also, some laBCC lesions were not suitable for MRI evaluation (as 
confirmed by central review). Patients with mBCC were assessed with either CT or MRI scans (and 
color clinical photography for skin lesions, if any) at baseline and subsequent time points per the 
tumour assessment schedule (the same imaging modality should have been used within patients). 
Modified RECIST were developed to adequately assess response in patients with laBCC that were 
associated with features which were not adequately covered by RECIST 1.1, such as scarring/fibrosis 
and ulceration. 
The underlying principles of the composite overall response as per mRECIST criteria, are as follows: 
• 
Patients who achieve any shrinkage or morphological change in tumor (e.g. development of 
scars/fibrosis) that is potentially consistent with treatment effect will be biopsied to confirm the 
presence or absence of tumor. 
• 
• 
Patients with post-treatment scar/fibrosis formation will be considered to have 
achieved CR if biopsies of the residual lesion(s) confirm the absence of tumor. 
PR or SD with scar/fibrosis formation will be considered to be CR if histology confirms 
the absence of tumor.  
•  Missing biopsy data, e.g. if not taken (UNKNOWN), will be considered as POSITIVE histology for 
the purposes of composite overall response determination per m- RECIST with the following 
exception: Following determination of CR a biopsy sample is not required at any subsequent time-
point unless visual (photograph) or radiologic evidence indicates progression of disease. In such 
cases, a missing biopsy data will be considered as NEGATIVE histology and the composite overall 
response will continue to be assessed as complete response (CR). 
If the disease is not assessable by MRI scan at baseline (e.g. disease is not measurable or MRI is 
contraindicated for the patient due to metal implants), the composite overall response will be based on 
photograph(s) along with histology of the lesion(s). MRI scans at post-baseline time-points are not 
required and will not be used in response determination. Similarly, if the disease is not assessable by 
photo at baseline, MRI scan along with histology will be used to determine the composite overall 
response. Post-baseline photographs will not be used in response determination. 
If the disease is assessable by MRI scan at baseline but an MRI scan is missing at any postbaseline 
assessment, then the composite overall response at that assessment will be “UNKNOWN”. Similarly, if 
the disease is evaluable by photograph at baseline but a photograph is missing at any post-baseline 
assessment, then the composite overall response at that assessment will be “UNKNOWN”.

Composite overall response assessment per mRECIST in patients in laBCC

Imaging methodologies used for tumour assessments per central review and investigator assessment 
were: 
• Localized/soft tissue MRI scans and color clinical photography for patients with laBCC 
• Chest/abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI for patients with mBCC (color clinical photography for skin lesions, 
if any) 
In addition to localized/soft tissue MRI scans, for all patients with laBCC, all skin lesions (target and 
non-target) were required to be assessed by color photography per the tumour assessment schedule, 
except for lesions in difficult anatomical locations, e.g. auditory canal, that cannot be assessed by color 
photographs. 
Baseline tumour assessments were performed ≤  21 days prior to starting study treatment. After 
baseline (screening assessments), further tumour response evaluations were performed at Weeks 5, 9, 
and 17 (±3 days) and subsequently every 8 weeks (±3 days) during the first year and every 12 weeks 
(±3 days) thereafter until PD was confirmed, start of a new antineoplastic therapy, lost to follow-up, or 
78 weeks from the date of enrollment of the last patient, whichever came first. The tumour response 
assessment at Week 5 was required for patients with laBCC and was recommended (optional) for 
patients with mBCC. 
Page 60/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biopsies for confirmation of the presence or absence of tumour (i.e. at confirmation of CR or PR, or 
when tumour response was uncertain) were to be taken from target lesions (≥  10 mm in their longest 
dimension). 
Considerations for patients with laBCC 
Measurable lesions were those that could be accurately measured in at least one dimension as ≥  10 
mm with MRI scan or on color photographs. 
Any lesion that was previously treated with radiotherapy was considered as a non-target lesion, unless 
it was measurable and had shown clear progression since the radiotherapy, in which case, it may have 
been considered as a target lesion. 
Considerations for patients with mBCC 
Measurable lesions were non-nodal lesions that could be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
as no less than double the slice thickness or 10 mm, whichever was greater, with spiral CT or MRI 
scan, or nodal lesions (i.e. lymph node) ≥  15 mm in short axis with spiral CT or MRI scan (irrespective 
of slice thickness). Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue 
components that could be evaluated by CT/MRI could be considered as measurable lesions. 
As with the laBCC cohort, any lesion that was previously treated with radiotherapy was considered as a 
non-target lesion, unless it was measurable and had shown clear progression since the radiotherapy, in 
which case, it may have been considered as a target lesion. 
The key secondary endpoints included duration of response (DoR) and complete response rate (CRR), 
both determined per central review, according to mRECIST for patients with laBCC and RECIST 1.1 for 
patients with mBCC. Other secondary endpoints included the following: time to tumour response (TTR, 
i.e. complete response or partial response as assessed by central review and investigator according to 
mRECIST in patients with laBCC and to RECIST 1.1 in patients with mBCC); progression-free survival 
(PFS, as assessed by central review and investigator according to mRECIST in patients with laBCC and 
to RECIST 1.1 in patients with mBCC).PROs included evaluation of Health Related Quality of life 
(according to EORTC QLQ-C30 and its associated head and neck cancer-specific module [H&N35] and 
SF-36. However, no formal inferential statistical analysis was planned for PROs. Time to deterioration 
for PRO outcomes (defined as the first time from the date of randomization that the patient’s score hit 
a threshold of 10 points or more worsening from their baseline score with no later improvement above 
this threshold) was evaluated. 
Sample size 
Study A2201 (BOLT) was planned to include approximately 210 patients to obtain 150 patients in the 
primary efficacy analysis set (pEAS) if the study was continued beyond the interim analysis.  
The decision operating characteristics for the primary endpoint (ORR per mRECIST in laBCC patients 
and RECIST 1.1 in mBCC patients as determined by central review, in the pEAS) of the study design 
under different true ORR (note that this is not the same as the observed ORR) on each treatment arm 
is provided in the table below. The table is based on 150 patients eligible for the pEAS. 
Page 61/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 21: 
 Decision operating characteristics for the primary endpoint of A2201 study 
design 
The design provides control of type I (false-positive) error rate with only a 0.3% for 800 mg arm and 
2.4% for 200 mg arm if the true ORR on the respective arms is 20% or less. When 800 mg arm is 
terminated and 200 mg is continued to enroll 100 patients in the pEAS the type I error rate is only 
0.5% if the true ORR for 200 mg arm is 20% or less. 
For the purposes of calculating the probabilities, the pEAS and the set of patients used for the interim 
analysis are assumed to be mutually exclusive. Also it is assumed that a high degree of concordance 
between the primary endpoint for the interim analysis (ORR per RECIST 1.1 as determined by local 
investigators), and the primary endpoint of the study (ORR per mRECIST in laBCC patients and RECIST 
1.1 in mBCC patients as determined by central review, in the pEAS) so the same true ORR is used 
when calculating the probabilities at interim analysis and at primary analysis.

Decision operating characteristics for the secondary endpoint of A2201 study 
design 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:2 ratio to receive treatment with sonidegib 200 mg or 800 mg. 
Randomization was stratified across the two treatment arms according to the stage of disease (laBCC 
or mBCC), histological subtype (non-aggressive or aggressive for laBCC patients) and the regions 
(Australia, Europe, and North America). 
Page 62/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blinding (masking) 
Patients, investigator staff, persons performing any assessments, all Novartis personnel, and 
individuals at central laboratories (including central imaging) were to remain blinded to the identity of 
the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock for the primary analysis 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis of ORR was based on a central review according to mRECIST in patients with 
laBCC and RECIST 1.1 in patients with mBCC. The pEAS was used for the primary analysis. The FAS 
and Per Protocol Set (PPS) were used as supportive analyses. 
Treatment with the 800-mg dose of sonidegib was hypothesized to be more efficacious than the 200-
mg dose. No statistical testing comparing the two treatment arms was planned. 
Treatment with sonidegib was to be considered sufficiently efficacious if the observed ORR on any 
treatment arm at the primary analysis was 30% or higher. The point estimate of ORR for each arm and 
the corresponding 95% exact confidence interval (CI) was provided. Per the study design 
characteristics, if the lower bound of the 95% CI exceeded 20%, it was further considered to be 
clinically meaningful. 
The difference in ORR between the two treatment arms was also summarized along with the 95% 
exact CI. The proportion of patients who underwent surgical resection after PR was also summarized 
along with the 95% exact CI, using the pEAS. 
Interim analyses 
The primary analysis of study data was performed when all patients had been treated for 24 weeks or 
discontinued treatment. One interim analysis of safety and efficacy data was performed when the first 
48 patients randomized had completed 16 weeks of treatment or discontinued treatment; it was 
possible to terminate one or both treatment arms at the interim for lack of adequate efficacy, i.e. 
futility. The trial design was planned to be adaptively updated based on interim results. A final analysis 
of safety and efficacy was performed at 78 weeks following enrollment of the last patient.

Numbers analysed 
Analysis sets 
Analysis presented were based on data collected up to 28-Jun 2013 (cut-off date). 
The full analysis set (FAS) comprised all patients who were assigned study treatment irrespective of 
receiving it (all randomized patients). 
The primary efficacy analysis set (pEAS) was a subset of the FAS including patients with laBCC with 
tumours that were adequately assessed by MRI or photography or both, and including all patients with 
mBCC included in the FAS. For patients with laBCC, adequate assessment by photography was defined 
as those with annotated photographs or those without annotated photographs and documentation of 
the absence of palpable sub-dermal components outside the margins of the photographed lesion(s). 
The pEAS was used to analyze all efficacy endpoints that were based on the assessment of tumour 
response per mRECIST for laBCC and RECIST 1.1 for mBCC patients, namely ORR, rate of CR, DoR, 
PFS, and TTR. 
The safety analysis set included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.  
The per-protocol set (PPS) consisted of a subset of the patients in the pEAS who were compliant with 
the requirements of the protocol.  
The following protocol deviations led to exclusion from the PPS: 
• Type of indication differed from those required by the protocol (e.g. incorrect histology/cytology); • 
Prior therapy included systemic sonidegib or other hedgehog pathway inhibitors;• WHO performance 
status ≥ 3; • Another anti-neoplastic therapy was administered after start of study treatment and prior 
to first tumour assessment; • Measurable disease did not meet minimum requirements;  • Patients 
who have taken part in an experimental drug study within 4 weeks of initiating treatment with 
LDE225; • Patients who are receiving other anti-neoplastic therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, targeted 
therapy or radiotherapy) concurrently or within 4 weeks of starting treatment with sonidegib; • 
Patients who did not receive any study treatment; •Treatment started more than 14 days after 
randomization. 
Page 71/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All randomized patients were included in the FAS. Two-hundred-thirty patients with a diagnosis of 
laBCC (84.3%) or mBCC (15.7%) were randomized 1:2 to receive treatment with either sonidegib 200 
mg daily (n=79) or sonidegib 800 mg daily (n=151) in the FAS. Fifty-nine patients were excluded from 
the FAS to form the pEAS essentially due to incomplete availability of documents for proper anti-
tumour assessment (MRI and/or photography). 
Table 31: 
Analysis sets 
Outcomes and estimation 
As of the 28-Jun-2013 data cut-off, the median study follow-up was 13.1 months for the pEAS and 
13.9 months for the FAS. The Applicant also has provided 12-month (cut-off 31 December 2013) and 
18-month (cut-off 11 July 2014) updated efficacy analyses. 
Primary endpoint: Confirmed ORR per central review (pEAS population) - cut-off 28 June 
2013 
The ORR per central review for all patients combined was 36.4% (95% CI: 23.8, 50.4) and 33.6% 
(95% CI: 25.1, 43.0) for the 200-mg and 800-mg arms, respectively. Response rates met the 
predefined criteria for both treatment arms for point estimates to meet or exceed 30%. The lower 
bounds of the associated 95% CIs also exceeded 20%, the pre-specified threshold for clinical relevance 
as per the study design operating characteristics. Treatment at both dose levels resulted in minimal 
difference in ORR evident between the two treatment arms (Δ -2.7%; 95% CI: -18.73, 12.45). 
• ORR of 42.9% (95% CI: 27.7, 59.0) and 15.4% (95% CI: 1.9, 45.4) was reported for the sonidegib 
200-mg treatment arm for patients with laBCC and mBCC, respectively, in the pEAS.  
• At the 800-mg dose, ORRs were 37.6% (95% CI: 27.8, 48.3) and 17.4% (95% CI: 5.0, 38.8), 
respectively, for patients with laBCC and mBCC; all were PRs.

Results obtained in the pEAS population were similar to the results obtained in the FAS population 
according to IRC assessment (sensitivity analyses). 
When looking at waterfall plots: 
-laBCC: 96.9% and 94.6% of evaluable patients experienced a reduction in tumour size with sonidegib 
200 mg and 800 mg, respectively, based on photographic evaluation of the target lesions; 
-mBCC: 91.7% and 84.2% of evaluable patients experienced a reduction in tumour size with sonidegib 
200 mg and 800 mg, respectively, based on any imaging modality.

No patient with laBCC underwent surgical resection following confirmed PR per central review for the 
pEAS. 
Secondary endpoints: ORR according to investigator’s assessment – pEAS and FAS 
ORRs were higher per investigator assessment than per central review for the pEAS. Overall ORRs per 
investigator assessment were 56.4% (95% CI: 42.3, 69.7) and 53.4% (95% CI: 44.0, 62.8) for the 
200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively. 
-Confirmed ORRs of 66.7% (95% CI: 50.5, 80.4) and 23.1% (95% CI: 5.0, 53.8) were reported for 
patients receiving treatment with sonidegib 200 mg with laBCC and mBCC, respectively. 
-Corresponding ORRs for patients in the 800-mg treatment arm were 58.1% (95% CI: 47.4, 68.2) and 
34.8% (95% CI: 16.4, 57.3) for laBCC and mBCC, respectively

ORR applying similar methodology as to the vismodegib Erivance trial in laBCC 
Table 34: 
Best Overall response summary table according to IRC using update mRECIST 
for laBCC – pEAS 
When applying the methodology used for vismodegib in the Erivance study, an improvement in 
Complete Response Rate is observed compared with the primary analysis in laBCC patients, where CRR 
according to IRC in the pEAS was 16.7 % and 30.1% in the sonidegib 200 mg and 800 mg arm, 
respectively. Consistent results were observed when assessment was made according to the FAS 
population. 
A sensitivity analysis was conducted where only basic categories of responder vs non-responder 
yielded concordance rates between investigator and central review of 67 and 72%, respectively, for 
patients with laBCC and mBCC. 
Secondary endpoint: Time to Tumour Response (TTR) - cut-off 28 June 2013 
-TTR per IRC (pEAS and FAS): median TTRs in the pEAS in laBCC were 3.9 months (95% CI: 2.1, 4.0) 
and 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.0, 3.8) for the 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively. Median 
TTRs for patients with mBCC were 4.6 months (95% CI: 1.8, 7.4) and 1.0 months (95% CI: 1.0, 2.1) 
for the 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively. Similar results were observed in the FAS. 
-TTR per INV (pEAS and FAS): Median TTRs in the pEAS laBCC were 1.9 months (95% CI: 1.2, 3.7) 
and 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.1, 2.0) for the sonidegib 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, 
respectively. Median TTR in mBCC were 1.0 months (95% CI: 0.9, 3.7) and 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.0, 
5.6) for the 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively. Similar results were observed in the 
FAS.

Secondary endpoints: Duration of response (DoR), Progression Free survival (PFS), Overall 
Survival (OS) - cut-off 28 June 2013 
In general, data supporting durability of the primary endpoint (in terms of DoR, PFS, OS) were 
considered not conclusive due to the high rate of censoring. The results of the updated 18-month 
analysis have been provided by the Applicant within the Day 120 Response document and are 
presented at the end of the outcomes paragraph. 
- Duration of response (DoR)  
1) Duration of response (DoR) according to IRC – pEAS and FAS 
a) pEAS: 
-laBCC: only 4 of the 53 patients with laBCC per IRC who experienced an objective response reported 
PD at the cut-off date (28 June 2013), therefore median DoR was not estimable. Estimated 
progression-free rates at 9 months were 82.1% (95% CI: 44-95) and 92.3% (95%CI: 57-99) for the 
sonidegib 200 mg and 800 mg, respectively according to IRC er pEAS. 
-mBCC: median DoR was 8.3 months in the sonidegib 800 mg arm, whereas it was not estimable in 
the 200 mg arm due to high rate of censoring. 
b) FAS: DoR results in the FAS were very similar to the pEAS. 
2)For the DoR results according to INV in the pEAS and FAS reference is made to summary table 
reported at the end of efficacy paragraph. 
- Progression Free Survival (PFS) 
1) PFS – IRC assessment (pEAS): 
- laBCC: median PFS was non-estimable in both treatment arms, with 88.1% and 91.4% of patients 
censored in the respective analyses for the 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms. Estimated 12-month 
PFS rates were 83.6% (95% CI: 58.9, 94.1) and 82.8% (95% CI: 67.3, 91.4) for sonidegib 200 mg 
and 800 mg, respectively. Similar results were observed in the FAS. 
- mBCC: median PFS was 13.1 months (95% CI: 5.6, 13.1) and 7.6 months (95% CI: 6.2, 11.1) in the 
200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively. Estimated 12-month PFS rates were 64.9% (95% 
CI: 24.9, 87.4) and 15.7% (95% CI: 1.0, 47.7) for the 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, 
respectively. Similar results were observed in the FAS. 
2) PFS – INV assessment (pEAS):  
- laBCC: median PFS was 22 months (95% CI: 13.7, 22.0) in the 200 mg treatment arm and non-
estimable in the 800 mg arm. Similar results were observed in the FAS. 
- mBCC: median PFS was 13.1 months (95% CI: 9.2, 16.6) and 13.3 months (95% CI: NE) in the 200-
mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively. Similar results were observed in the FAS. 
- Overall Survival (OS) 
Median OS was non-estimable in both sonidegib 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, with 97.5% and 
94.0% of patients censored in the respective arms. 
As of the 28-Jun-2013 data cut-off date for the 200-mg arm, 1 death (1.5%) was reported among the 
66 patients with laBCC and 1 death (7.7%) was reported among the 13 patients with mBCC. Estimated 
12-month survival rates were 100% and 87.5% for patients with laBCC and mBCC, respectively. 
In the 800-mg treatment arm, 7 deaths (5.5%) were reported among patients with laBCC and 2 
deaths (8.7%) in patients with mBCC. Estimated 12-month survival rates were 92.4% and 91.3%, 
respectively. 
Ancillary analyses 
Secondary endpoint: Time to Tumour Response (TTR) 
-TTR per IRC (pEAS and FAS): median TTR in the pEAS in laBCC was 3.9 months (95% CI: 2.1, 4.0) 
Page 77/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.0, 3.8) for the 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively. Median 
TTR for patients with mBCC was 4.6 months (95% CI: 1.8, 7.4) and 1.0 months (95% CI: 1.0, 2.1) for 
the 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively. Similar results were observed in the FAS. 
-TTR per INV (pEAS and FAS): Median TTRs in the pEAS laBCC were 1.9 months (95% CI: 1.2, 3.7) 
and 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.1, 2.0) for the sonidegib 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, 
respectively. Median TTR in mBCC were 1.0 months (95% CI: 0.9, 3.7) and 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.0, 
5.6) for the 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively. Similar results were observed in the 
FAS. 
Secondary endpoint: ORR, CRR, DoR, PFS and TTR per IRC and INV using RECIST 1.1 
Analyses of primary and secondary endpoints according to RECIST 1.1. were provided for 
completeness as they were used as primary analysis before implementation of amendment 2. Results 
show significantly lower ORR compared with results analyzed with mRECIST, essentially because 
RECIST 1.1 does not allow appropriate assessment for locally advanced skin lesions. 
Exploratory endpoint:  subgroup analyses were provided evaluating treatment effect in terms of ORR 
by age, stage of disease, ECOG Performance Status, disease histology, sex, race, geographic region 
and use of gastric pH agents. 
Figure 16: 
 ORR per IRC in pEAS by subgroups 
Exploratory endpoint: PROs-EORTC QLQ-C30 and H&N35  
Compliance rates of patients completing the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&N35 questionnaires were 
high in both treatment arms at baseline (93% and 94%) and at week 33 (44% and 45%). The 
proportion of patients who completed the questionnaires at baseline and at least one post-baseline 
assessment was 88.7% and 90.0% for the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&N35, respectively. Pre-specified 
subscale scores for the C30 included: physical functioning, social functioning, pain, and fatigue. Pre-
specified scales from the H&N35 included: trouble with social contact, head and neck pain, and weight 
loss.

Biomarker analysis 
Evaluation of Gli-1 inhibition on archival and fresh tumour tissues shows, in the 200-mg arm, median 
percent inhibition that ranged from 81.9% to 92.3% overtime for patients with laBCC and 77.1% to 
99.1% overtime for patients with mBCC. In the 800-mg arm, the median percent inhibition was >95% 
across visits for patients with laBCC and mBCC.  
Evidence about the rate of inhibition of Gli1 under treatment with sonidegib was submitted but no clear 
correlation between the evolution of Gli1 levels and response to treatment was observed . In 11 
patients that remained progression-free for a long time after drug discontinuation, data from modelling 
seem to suggest that following an initial sustained inhibition, Gli1 levels progressively increase, 
approaching baseline values, at the time of radiological or clinical confirmation of progressive disease.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The applicant did not submit efficacy analyses performed across clinical trials. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The applicant did not submit specific clinical studies conducted in special population. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Odomzo in all subsets of the paediatric population in basal cell carcinoma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
Supportive study 
Study X2101 
Responses were observed in 8 patients in this phase 1 study, including 1 CR and 7 PR. All responses 
occurred in patients with BCC and medulloblastoma, consistent with the knowledge that Hedgehog 
pathway activation is an important driver for both of these diseases. Among patients with BCC the 
response rate was 6/16 (38%), including 1 CR, and among patients with medulloblastoma the 
response rate was 2/9 (22%).  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application is based on the results of one pivotal phase II A2201 (BOLT) study. Study A2201 was a 
non-comparative, randomized, double-blind study where BCC patients were randomized (1:2) to 
sonidegib 200 mg QD or 800 mg QD. The 800 mg QD dose regimen corresponds to the MTD observed 
in the phase I dose escalation X2101 study performed with sonidegib in advanced solid tumours and 
the 200 mg QD dose regimen was the lowest dose where  anti-tumour activity was observed 
corresponding to exposures where  Gli-1 inhibition was down regulated in preclinical models and also in 
early clinical studies. Thus, the dose selection and the regimens employed in the pivotal study are 
considered acceptable.  
The CHMP expressed concern over the design of the BOLT study, where there was no control arm. The 
use of placebo or best investigator’s choice as control arm would have been preferred. Nevertheless, 
the CHMP accepted that robust efficacy and safety data could still be derived from this study to support 
the applied indication as there were no critical issues raised with the conduct of study as such. 
From a clinical point of view, ORR should be considered an appropriate endpoint only when supported 
by other clinical parameters (e.g. duration of response, PFS, improvement in disease resectability, etc) 
able to reassure over durability of the treatment effect and supporting translation into clinical benefit 
for patients. Moreover, ORR results should be convincing, in terms of magnitude and robustness of the 
effect.  
The primary Efficacy Analysis Set (pEAS) was chosen by the Applicant as the target population to 
demonstrate the activity of sonidegib. There is a numerical difference of 59 pts (24 pts treated at the 
dose of 200 mg and 35 at 800 mg) between the FAS (ITT) and pEAS populations and this is the result 
Page 88/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the selection of patients based on completeness of their imaging and photography material, as 
specified in the amended study protocol. The implementation of modified RECIST for evaluation of 
response in patients with laBCC is also acceptable given that routine RECIST are not considered 
adequate to evaluate response in this kind of disease.  
The study population enrolled in the pivotal A2201 study appears to be comparable to the typical 
population of patients with BCC and no obvious imbalances between study arms were observed in the 
demographic and baseline characteristics evaluated. Progressive disease (clinical or radiological) was 
not requested at study entry and thus, there was uncertainty concerning the status of disease 
(progressive or stable) at study entry for a high number of patients (23%) enrolled in the pivotal 
study. However, sensitivity analyses showed similar effect of sonidegib in patients with unknown 
disease status at baseline and patients with progressive disease, suggesting that the effect observed in 
the overall population was not driven by the effect observed in patients not yet progressing at time of 
study start. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
According to the primary analysis submitted (cut-off date 28 June 2013) in the pivotal A2201 study 
ORR per central review for all patients (enrolled in the pEAS) was 36.4% (95% CI: 23.8, 50.4) and 
33.6% (95% CI: 25.1, 43.0) for the 200-mg and 800-mg arms, respectively. Response rates met the 
predefined criteria for both treatment arms for point estimates to meet or exceed 30%. Updated 
efficacy results (18-month analysis, cut-off 11 July 2014) were subsequently submitted. 
In the laBCC population, ORRs of 54.8% (95% CI: 38.7, 70.2) and 47.3% (95% CI: 36.9, 57.9) were 
reported for the sonidegib 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively, per central review in the 
pEAS, with consistent results observed in the FAS. ORRs appears higher in the analysis performed 
according to investigator assessment, with ORRs of 71.4% (95% CI: 55.4, 84.3) and 61.3% (95% CI: 
50.6, 71.2) reported for the sonidegib 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively.  
In the mBCC population, ORRs of 7.7% (95%CI: 0.2, 36.0) and 17.4% (95%CI: 5.0, 38.8) were 
reported for the sonidegib 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively, per central review. ORRs 
appear higher in the analysis performed according to investigator assessment, with ORRs of 23.1% 
(95%CI: 5.0, 53.8) and 34.8% (95%CI: 16.4, 57.3) reported for the sonidegib 200-mg and 800-mg 
treatment arms, respectively. Of note, a lower ORR was reported at the updated 18-month analysis 
(7.7%) in comparison with the original 6-month analysis (15.4%). There were concerns raised in 
relation to the low number of patients treated, the low rate of response observed (with no reported 
cases of CR) at the proposed 200 mg dose and the unlikely clinical relevance of an effect on 
asymptomatic lesions. Subsequently, based on the updated results submitted and the lower ORR 
observed at 18 months, the applicant withdrew the indication for the mBCC population. 
ORR according to investigator assessment was higher in both laBCC and mBCC populations. Low 
concordance rates between IRC and INV assessment were observed (for the 200 mg arm 50% and 
46% in the laBCC and mBCC population, respectively; for the 800 mg arm 49% and 61% in the laBCC 
and mBCC population, respectively). The reason for the low concordance could be attributed to the 
complexity of the response assessment implemented in the pivotal trial. The Applicant has provided a 
sensitivity analysis where only basic categories of responder vs non-responder yield concordance rates 
between investigator and central review of 67 and 72%, respectively, for patients with laBCC and 
mBCC providing further evidence on the robustness and reliability of the method used for the 
assessment. 
Although median duration of response per central review and median OS could not be accurately 
estimated in both laBCC and mBCC populations due to high rate of censoring, PFS results reassure 
Page 89/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
overall durability of response. Indeed, in the laBCC population median PFS was 22.1 months with 
sonidegib 200 mg and 19.4 months with sonidegib 800 mg. In the mBCC population median PFS was 
13.1 months with sonidegib 200 mg and 11.1 months with sonidegib 800mg.  These data suggest also 
no significant difference in durability of response between patients treated with 200 mg and 800 mg 
sonidegib dose.  
In the assessment of the narrative of several patients enrolled in the pivotal study an extremely long 
interval is observed between the discontinuation of the drug and observation of progression.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data indicate that patients continued to derive benefit from treatment long after 
discontinuation as a result of the long half-life of the drug. Moreover, modeling in 11 of such patients 
suggests that sustained Gli1 inhibition is associated with the systemic presence of the drug and, 
therefore, the ‘long-term’ beneficial effects observed could be attributed to treatment with sonidegib. It 
is possible that after an initial sustained inhibition by sonidegib, Gli1 levels progressively increase, 
approaching baseline values, at the time of radiological or clinical confirmation of progressive disease. 
The CHMP has requested the applicant to evaluate whether there is a correlation between Gli1 levels 
and disease progression as Gli1 levels could potentially act as a marker of sonidegib efficacy and that 
progressive disease could be identified by the return of Gli1 to baseline levels. Correlation between Gli1 
levels and disease progression would allow the exploration of optimal drug schedule and explore 
discontinuation schedules to allow for better tolerability of sonidegib. This is a condition in the Annex 
II. 
Evaluation of PROs showed that, with the limitations related to the large standard error, the majority 
of patients appear to experience a maintenance in their quality of life during treatment with sonidegib, 
with relatively more fatigue, pain and weight loss reported in patients treated with sonidegib 800 mg 
compared with the 200 mg arm. 
Finally, an indirect comparison of efficacy between sonidegib and vismodegib was provided (data not 
shown). With the limitations related to inter study comparison, sonidegib appears comparable with 
vismodegib in terms of anti-tumour activity in laBCC patients. 
Off-label use in patients with medulloblastoma, BCC appropriate for surgery or radiotherapy, and other 
cancers has been identified as missing information in the RMP. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In patients with laBCC, treatment with sonidegib met the pre-specified 30% criteria in terms of ORR, 
suggesting a clinically relevant benefit in this patient population. The updated 18-month analysis and 
several sensitivity analyses appear to support the robustness of such finding. The updated PFS analysis 
supports durability of response.  
Following the concerns raised by the CHMP on the relevance of the clinical benefit in patients with 
mBCC, the applicant withdrew the indication for the mBCC population. 
Tumour shrinkage in oncology has been used as a tool to define the efficacy of medicinal 
products in exploratory or confirmatory clinical studies. To substantiate the assessment based on 
this endpoint, it is necessary to generate further efficacy data in the post-authorisation phase to 
verify the impact of the intervention on clinical outcome or disease progression. It is also 
necessary to verify whether the overall survival data in the post-authorisation phase is discordant 
with or confirmative of the outcome of the surrogate endpoint.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to be addressed issues related to of the efficacy

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Evaluation of safety of Odomzo is based on data from 293 patients that were treated with sonidegib 
monotherapy. This  safety population consists of patients included in studies A2201 (full designation 
study CLDE225A2201) with mBCC and laBCC, in the dose escalation trial X2101 in patients with solid 
tumour (full designation study CLDE225X2101) and in Japanese patients with solid tumours in  study 
X1101 (CLDE225X1101).   
Additional  sources  of  data  consisted  of  a  worldwide  literature  search,  to  capture  any  investigator 
reports  on  safety  aspects  not  included  in  the  study  reports  (01-Dec-2012  to  31-Dec-2013)  and  a 
review of SAE reports from ongoing studies (including clinical pharmacology studies.

Table 41: 
Safety population on sonidegib (N=293) 
Overall exposure 
In Study A2201, the median duration of treatment with sonidegib 200 mg was 8.9 months compared 
to  6.5  months  for  the  sonidegib  800-mg  group  (Table  42).  The  shorter  exposure  in  the  800-mg 
treatment  group  was  attributed  to  early  discontinuation  of  patients  as  the  result  of  AEs  (and  not  to 
disease progression). As of the 28-Jun-2013 data cut-off, the median study follow-up was 13.1 months 
for the pEAS and 13.9 months for the FAS. 
Table 42: 
Duration of exposure to sonidegib by dose – Study A2201 (safety set) 
In  the  SCS  pool  the  median  duration  of  exposure  to  sonidegib  200  mg  and  800  mg  was  8.4  months 
compared to 6.1 months for the sonidegib 800-mg group (Table 43).

Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) were classified using v16.1 of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) and arranged by system organ class (SOC). Laboratory parameters were classified into 
grades using the NCI common toxicity criteria of AE Version 4.03. 
Safety and tolerability of sonidegib 200 mg and 800 mg QD are summarized in the table below. The 
contents of this table show that, regarding AEs, the 200 mg dose appeared more favourable than for 
the 800-mg dose. 
Table 44: 
 Overview of adverse event categories (Safety set study A2201) 
Page 93/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In A2201 AEs were experienced by 94.9% of patients receiving sonidegib 200 mg and by 100.0% of 
patients in the sonidegib 800-mg group. More important, a substantial number of patients treated with 
the proposed 200 mg daily dose encountered grade 3 or 4 AE (CTCAE v4).  
System organ class (SOC) defined AEs as reported ≥10% in the 200 mg sonidegib-arm encompassed 
primarily musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (e.g., muscle spasms 49.4%), skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (alopecia 43.0%), nervous system disorders (e.g., dysgeusia 38%), 
blood abnormalities (e.g., elevated CPK 29.1%), fatigue (29.1%) and metabolism and nutrition 
disorders (loss of appetite in 19%).  
The updated 18-month analysis of data from A2201 confirms observations from the initial analysis, i.e. 
that the rate of discontinuation due to AEs is relatively high, with 27.8% of patients treated at the 200 
mg and 37.3% treated at 800 mg that decided to stop the ongoing therapy.  
A refinement of the schedule in function of the molecular inhibition of Gli1 could be of help in 
warranting a higher adherence to treatment, with stop-and-go periods of treatment. 
Adverse events in study X2101 
Of the 103 patients studied in the dose escalation study X2101, 102 patients (99%) experienced an 
adverse event (AE) during the study, and the majority of patients (78 patients, 75.7%) had AEs 
suspected to be related to study drug. Approximately 60% of the patients experienced grade 3 - 4 AEs, 
and approximately one-half of patients experienced a SAE. The most common SAE was increased 
creatinine phosphokinase (CPK).

Adverse events (greater than or equal to 5 percent), suspected to be drug-
related, by preferred term, by treatment - Study X2101 Safety set 
Page 94/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 24 patients (23.3%) had grade 3 - 4 AEs suspected to be study drug related. The most 
common grade 3 - 4 related AEs were increased blood creatine phosphokinase (18 patients, 17.5%), 
increased AST (4 patients, 3.9%), asthenia, increased alanine aminotransferase, and increased 
myoglobin blood (3 patients each, 2.9%). All other grade 3 - 4 AEs suspected to be study drug related 
occurred in 2 patients or less. 
Table 46: 
 Adverse events (greater than 1 percent) with maximal severity grade 3 - 4 
by treatment, regardless of study drug relationship, by preferred term and 
treatment - Study X2101 Safety set 
Albeit that numbers of patients tested were small the lowest rate of grade 3-4 AEs was reported in the 
100 and 200 mg QD groups. 
14 patients included in this phase I trial died during the study. This course was mainly attributed to the 
patient’s highly advanced disease and grave prognosis ad vitam: twelve of the patient deaths were 
related to disease progression. The other 2 deaths on study were cardiac arrest and sudden death, 
both AE were considered to be unrelated to sonidegib by the investigators. Other than DLTs, in this 
study there were no clinically significant changes in laboratory values, vital signs, or ECG parameters.

Adverse events for main trial A2201 
Patients that were included in the A2201 study had an overall exposure of 155.3 patient-years, and are 
considered representative of the intended target population.  
Mean duration of treatment with sonidegib 200 mg was 9.5 months, and 7.4 months with the 800-mg 
group. The median duration of treatment was 8.9 months and 6.5 months, respectively. The shorter 
exposure in the 800-mg group was attributed to the early discontinuation of patients as a result of AEs 
and not to disease progression. Overall, 43 (54.4%) and 21 patients (26.6%), respectively, were 
exposed to sonidegib 200 mg for periods ≥ 8 and ≥ 12 months. In the sonidegib 800-mg group, 55 
patients (36.7%) and 28 patients (18.7%) respectively, were exposed to treatment for periods of ≥8 
and ≥ 12 months. The median relative dose intensities were 97.2% and 91.8% for the sonidegib 200-
mg and 800-mg treatment groups, respectively. 
Dose reductions in A2201 were >2-fold more frequent in the sonidegib 800-mg treatment group than 
the 200-mg group. These dose modifications were primarily attributable to AEs. Dose interruptions 
were observed in similar proportions in the two treatment groups. 
Table 47: 
Adverse events irrespective of causality occurring in at least 10% of patients 
treated with 200 mg or 800 mg sonidegib - Safety set A2201 
Muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia, and nausea were common AEs reported with sonidegib 200 mg 
QD: in fact each of these AE was reported in ≥30% of patients in A2201. 
Page 96/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, blood CK increased, musculoskeletal 
pain, weight decreased, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, myalgia, abdominal pain, headache, and pain 
were frequently reported (≥10%) in the 200 mg-arm. These events primarily regarded  CTC grade 1/2 
(mild/moderate) events. 
At the initial MAA Grade 3 - 4 events were reported in 24 patients (30.4%) treated with 200 mg OD. 
and regarded mostly blood CPK elevation (6.3%) and at lowering frequencies: muscle spasms (2,5%), 
arthralgia, nausea, constipation vomiting and/or weight loss. (In comparison: 56% of patients in the 
800 mg arm encountered CTC grade 3 /4 toxicity) (also refer to the section on laboratory findings). 
Not surprisingly AEs were more prominent and more frequent in the 800 mg QD-arm when compared 
with the 200 mg QD-arm.  
At the initial application dysgeusia was reported at lower frequency in the 200 mg sonidegib-arm than 
in the 800 mg-arm of A2201 (38% and 59.3% respectively). Also vomiting (6.3% and 26%), muscle 
spasms (49.4% and 66.7%), nausea (32.9% and 45.3%), alopecia (43% and 55.3%), decreased 
appetite (19% and 30.7%), and weight decrease (26.6% and 38%) were observed in higher 
frequencies in the 800 mg QD group op pivotal trial A2201. Nevertheless the frequencies as reported 
from the 200 mg arm-patients by itself must be considered substantial and the dose 
reduction/interruption or treatment discontinuation deemed necessary (more than 50% of cases) 
illustrate the severity of AEs. 
Manageability of AEs 
Most AEs were generally manageable with dose adjustments, concomitant medications, non-drug 
therapies, or dietary intervention. 
The documented AEs CTC grade 3 and 4 are enumerated in detail in the following table:
Page 97/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 48: 
Adverse drug reactions by grade 3 or 4 -  Study A2201  - Safety set 
The AEs as encountered in study A2201 show a similar pattern to vismodegib (Erivedge).  When 
vismodegib is used as indicated the most common adverse drug reactions (ADR) that occurred in ≥ 
30% of patients were muscle spasms (74.6 %), alopecia (65.2 %), dysgeusia (57.2 %), weight 
decreased (48.6 %), fatigue (44.9 %) and nausea (34.8 %). 
Page 98/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
CTC grade 4 AE from the A2201 study was only reported as elevation of blood CPK (2.5%). As stated 
grade 3 AEs were noted as raised serum lipase (5.1%), CPK (3.8%) and elevation of other laboratory 
parameters (liver enzymes, amylase, 1.3%), as well as fatigue, and muscle spasms (2.5%), and 
weight loss, gastro intestinal disorders and alopecia (each encountered at 1.3%). 
The most common SAEs overall in this registration study were rhabdomyolysis (1.3% of patients in the 
200-mg treatment group vs 3.3% in those that received 800 mg), blood CPK increased (1.3% vs 
2.0%), and vomiting (0% vs 2.7%). 
In the phase II pivotal study, 2 (14.3%) out of 14 women of either child-bearing potential or of 
child-bearing age sterilised by tubal ligation developed amenorrhoea while on treatment with Odomzo 
200 mg or 800 mg once daily. 
Secondary primary malignancies 
Seven patients in study A2201 (N=229) developed cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This 
regarded 3 (3.8%) from the 200-mg treatment group and 4 (2.7%) from the 800-mg group.  Other 
secondary malignancies reported with the use of sonidegib included malignant melanoma, prostate 
cancer and cases of B-cell lymphoma and vulva cancer.   
A higher incidence of SPM is associated with higher sonidegib dose, with 12.7% (10 patients) and 
15.3% (23 patients) in the 200 and 800 mg arm, respectively. No conclusive data about timing and 
type of second cancer types can be drawn at this stage.  
Electrocardiography 
No AEs with the preferred terms of ‘electrocardiogram QT prolonged’ or ‘Torsade de pointes’ were 
reported in patients included in study A2201, either in the sonidegib 200-mg group or in the sonidegib 
800-mg group. In the 200 mg sonidegib arm of study A2201 increases of the QTcF- interval from 
baseline of >30 msec were reported for 7.6% of patients. 
Fractures 
In Study A2201, the current data indicate that there are 10 patients with 11 events of ‘fracture’ 
through 11-Jul-2014 for a rate of 530.9 fractures per 10000 patient-years (95% CI: 265.0-949.9) (for 
a cumulative exposure of 207.2 patient-years, 95% CI based on Poisson distribution). 
Deaths 
In the pivotal trial, at the 28-Jun-2013 cut-off date, 11 deaths (11/229, 4.8%) were reported, 2 
(2.5%) in the sonidegib 200-mg group and 9 (6.0%) in the sonidegib 800-mg group. Of these fatalities 
four deaths occurred ‘on-treatment’ (defined as up to 30 days after the end of treatment)  with all 4 
deaths in the sonidegib 800-mg group. 2/11 of these deaths were attributed to the underlying 
malignancy. Of the remaining two, 1 was secondary to congestive cardiac failure and 1 was secondary 
to cardiac death. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematological abnormalities of any grade occurred in a higher proportion of patients with sonidegib 
800 mg relative to the 200-mg group. In both the sonidegib 200-mg and 800-mg groups, the most 
frequently reported haematological abnormalities in >20% of patients were decreased haemoglobin 
(25.3% and 34.7%, respectively) and decreased lymphocytes (24.1% and 34.0%, respectively).

Table 49: 
Selected haematology abnormalities (Safety set study A2201) 
The table displays the worst post-baseline values based on CTC grade for hemoglobin and lymphocytes, regardless 
of their baseline grade. 
Results on abnormalities in chemistry laboratory parameters in study A2201 showed that in study 
A2201 increases in creatinine, cholesterol, CPK, glucose, lipase, and magnesium levels occurred in ≥ 
30% of patients.  The most frequently reported grade 3 - 4 clinical chemistry abnormalities were 
increased lipase (11.4%), increased CPK (6.3%), increased glucose and increased potassium (each 
3.8%), and increased ALT and AST (each 2.5%). Incidence and severity of CK elevations appear to be 
related to the sonidegib dose administered.

ECG abnormalities 
No AEs with the preferred terms of ‘electrocardiogram QT prolonged’ or ‘Torsade des pointes’ were 
reported in patients included in study A2201, either in the sonidegib 200-mg group or in the sonidegib 
800-mg group. Nevertheless, increases from baseline of QTcF >30 msec were reported in 7.6% of 
patients in the sonidegib 200-mg group and 14.4% of patients in the 800-mg group. No increases from 
baseline in QTcF of >60 msec were observed in either treatment group. In the Day 120 Response 
document the Applicant has provided 18-month (cut-off 11 July 2014) updated safety analyses. Also 
here in overall no clinically relevant prolongation of QTc in patients’ electrocardiography was observed.    
Eye disorders 
The table below shows the AEs for eye disorders in 800 mg arm. Of note, cases of corneal perforation, 
keratitis and keratinopathy were reported in study A2201 in 800 mg only. 
Table 51: 
Adverse Events reported for eye disorders – study A2201 
Safety in special populations 
The median age of patients recruited to the registration phase II study A2201 was 66 years. There 
were no signs of an increased incidence of AEs reported in the elderly other than those that might be 
expected with increasing age.  
The safety of sonidegib in paediatric patients has not been evaluated in this program. Too few non-
Caucasians were included in the clinical development program to draw conclusions on safety in 
different racial groups. 
Specific studies in patients with hepatic or renal impairment were not conducted, although a PK study 
is ongoing in patients with hepatic impairment. As sonidegib is eliminated primarily via the hepatic 
route, wording is included in the proposed label to indicate that impaired hepatic function may affect 
the PK of sonidegib. 
The applicant did not submit data in pregnant women.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In vitro, sonidegib did not inhibit apical efflux transporters, PgP or MRP2, hepatic uptake transporters 
OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, renal organic anion uptake transporters OAT1 and OAT3, or the organic cation 
uptake transporters OCT1 and OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations. Drug-drug interactions 
resulting from sonidegib-mediated inhibition of substrates for these transporters were considered 
unlikely to occur. 
In study CLDE225A2108, a phase I, parallel group, open label, randomized, drug-drug interaction 
study the effect of rifampicin and ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 
sonidegib was assessed in healthy volunteers. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The most frequently reported AEs as the reason for discontinuation of study drug for the 200 mg QD 
group in the first assessment period of Study A2201 were muscle spasms (3.8% of patients versus 
8.7% in the 800 mg group), dysgeusia (2.5% vs 4.7%), weight loss (2.5% vs 4.7%) and nausea 
(2.5% vs 4.0%). 
Overall discontinuation as the result of AEs was related to the same and known AEs that were reported 
in lower grading (CTC grade 1-2) in the 200 mg arm of A2201.

The majority of patients in whom treatment was discontinued as the result of AEs experienced grade 1 
- 2 events. 
Dose adjustments (interruption or reduction) as a result of AEs appeared required for 31.6% of 
patients in the sonidegib 200-mg group and for 60.0% of patients in the sonidegib 800-mg group.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The hedgehog inhibitor sonidegib at the proposed dosage is, in general, well tolerated. At a median 
duration of exposure to sonidegib 200 mg of 8.9 months most AEs reported were musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, 
gastrointestinal disorders, laboratory abnormalities as well as ECG aberrations. The recommended 
dosage for patients in need for systemic treatment, 200 mg QD, showed AEs in almost all patients 
(94.9%) albeit that adverse events were primarily grade 1 or grade 2.  
The commonly reported ADRs for sonidegib 200 mg (reported in ≥  30% of patients) consisted of 
muscle spasms (49.4%), alopecia (43.0%), dysgeusia (38.0%), and nausea (32.9%). At the 
recommended dosage sonidegib (200 mg QD) grade 3 - 4 events were observed in 30.4% of patients 
(mostly increased blood CPK). 
The patient’s knowledge about the fact that their disease is not life-threatening may have contributed 
to consider stopping the drug, even for relatively low grade AEs. As expected, few patients had 
received further therapies following the discontinuation of sonidegib (60/230) and few of them 
received vismodegib (17% of the population as a whole and 4.5% of patients who stopped treatment 
in absence of disease progression).  
Incidence and severity of CK elevations appear to be related to the sonidegib dose administered. The 
incidence of rhabdomyolysis was rare and reported in 1 and 5 patients treated with 200 mg and 800 
mg QD, respectively.  Literature data suggest that the hedgehog pathway may be involved in 
myogenesis as well as in skeletal muscle and myocardial toxicity8. This provides a rationale for dose 
delay or dose reduction in cases of elevated CPK as recommended in SmPC section 4.2. Analysis of the 
safety database for patients that died with possible cardiac involvement did not show elevated levels of 
CK-MB.  No relation between CPK elevation and/or QT prolongation could be detected in patients with 
cardiac dysfunction or cardiac fatalities and thus, death due to cardiac toxicity has been, so far, ruled 
out. Therefore, muscle-related events have been identified as important identified risks. Interaction 
with drugs with a known risk of myopathy has been identified as important potential risks (please refer 
to comment on cardiac paragraph below. 
Not surprisingly, sonidegib 200 mg showed a more favourable safety and tolerability than that of 
sonidegib 800 mg. One of five patients stopped treatment due to CTC grade 1-2 AEs with reasons for 
stopping treatment altogether were muscle spasms (3.8% of patients for the 200 mg group vs 8.7% 
for the 800 mg group), dysgeusia (2.5% vs 4.7%), weight decreased (2.5% vs 4.7%), and nausea 
(2.5% vs 4.0%). 
Most AEs appeared reversible and non-cumulative. Dose adjustments (interruption or reduction) as a 
result of AEs were required in 31.6% of patients.  
Until the initial cut-off date 4.8% (11) of all patients in A2201 were reported to have died. Two (2.5%) 
in the sonidegib 200-mg group and 9 (6.0%) in the sonidegib 800-mg group. The patients that died in 
the 200 mg sonidegib arm initially had pre-existing confounding heart conditions at baseline. Cardiac 
events (myocardial ischemia, cardiac failure and cardiac death) as well as syncope have been identified 
as important potential risks. Patients with recent myocardial ischemia or cardiac failure have identified 
as missing information.

Page 106/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                
Aberrant laboratory parameters due to sonidegib were noted. The most frequently reported 
haematological aberrations were decreased haemoglobin and decreased lymphocytes. The most 
frequently reported grade 3 - 4 clinical chemistry abnormalities (with incidences of ≥ 2.0%) were 
increased lipase (11.4% and 12.7% for the 200-mg and 800-mg treatment groups, respectively), 
increased blood CPK (6.3% and 16.0%), increased glucose (3.8% and 2.7%), increased potassium 
(3.8% and 2.7%), increased AST (2.5% and 5.3%), increased ALT (2.5% and 4.0%), and increased 
amylase (1.3% and 2.0%). All other biochemistry abnormalities were single occurrences. Patients with 
anemia (haemoglobin of <9 g/dL) have been identified as missing information. 
Secondary primary skin tumours of different histology have been observed and could be another class-
related effect that requires special awareness and monitoring (SmPC section 4.4). Other secondary 
malignancies reported with the use of sonidegib included malignant melanoma, prostate cancer and 
cases of B-cell lymphoma and vulva cancer.  Moreover, secondary primary tumours (SPM) have been 
identified as an important potential risk and will be monitored in the Periodic Safety Update Report 
(PSUR)/Development Safety Update Report (DSUR). Patients with advanced BCC have an increased 
risk of developing cuSCC. Cases of cuSCC have been reported in advanced BCC patients treated with 
Odomzo. It has not been determined whether cuSCC is related to Odomzo treatment. Therefore, all 
patients should be monitored routinely while taking Odomzo, and cuSCC should be treated according 
to the standard of care (SmPC section 4.4). 
Ten patients and eleven AEs coded as “fracture” have been identified. The incidence of bone fractures 
appears to be slightly higher when compared with literature data and in 6 out of ten patients no other 
potentially concurring comorbidities were found. No clear causality and patterns (preferred sites, time 
to onset, et cet) can be established at this time. Therefore, bone fractures will be followed in PSURs 
and has been identified as an important potential risk. 
There were three cases related to corneal disorders (keratitis, keratopathy and corneal perforation) in 
study A2201, all in the 800 mg group. Cases of keratitis have also been observed with vismodegib, 
another Hh signalling pathway inhibitor. Furthermore, there is evidence in the literature that Hh 
signalling may play a role in maintaining the corneal epithelium. Hence, corneal disorder has been 
included in the RMP as potential important risks. 
The long term safety of sonidegib treatment in laBCC patients has been identified as missing 
information. 
Sonidegib has been shown to have teratogenic potential and foeto-development toxicity as presented 
in the reproductive toxicological non-clinical studies (see non-clinical discussion). The reproductive 
toxicity and teratogenicity has been identified as an important identified risk. Therefore, specific 
warnings have been introduced in the SmPC in section 4.4 and 4.6 on the risk of sonidegib treatment 
in pregnant women and to the foetus. A detailed pregnancy prevention progamme will be 
implemented, as well as the dissemination of educational material to the HCP and the patients to 
advise on the risks to the developing foetus. These additional risk minimization measures have been 
introduced in the RMP as well as conditions in the Annex II. 
In dose escalation studies, Odomzo was administered at doses up to 3000 mg orally once daily. 
Patients should be monitored closely for adverse events and given appropriate supportive measures in 
all cases of overdose. 
Although the safety database is small, the ADRs observed are consistent with those that have been 
observed with products that are the same class of products, i.e. inhibitors of the hedgehog pathway 
such as vismodeib. 
Page 107/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety of the sonidegib has been adequately investigated. In general, the ADRs observed are 
considered manageable and the management of ADRs has been appropriately addressed in the SmPC 
sections 4.4, 4.6 and 4.8 and appropriate dose modifications in section 4.2 for the management for 
symptomatic CK elevations and muscle-related adverse events.  
Considering that products such as sonidegib, that target the hedgehog pathway, are known to cause 
foetal loss, severe developmental abnormalities and teratogenicity, a pregnancy prevention 
programme has been implemented that women of childbearing age must comply with in order to be 
eligible to receive the treatment. The content and the key elements of this program include awareness 
in the product information, HCP and patient educational material and reminder card. 
The CHMP considers the following measures in the RMP necessary to address issues related to safety: 
1.  Analyses of adverse events of special interest in the ongoing studies without a final CSR, including 
the registration study A2201, C2301, X2114, X2116, X2203, and will be analysed in the final CSRs 
for these studies. In addition, longer term data using the 30-month and 42- month data will be 
analysed and reported in order to better characterize and understand the risks for cardiac events, 
second primary malignancies and fractures. 
2.  Analyses of adverse events of special interest in study CLDE225X2104 and CLDE225C2301 in order 
to better characterise and understand the risk post-natal developmental defects. 
3.  The Applicant is requested to submit within 3 months of EC decision, a full protocol for the 
proposed non-interventional PASS.  
4.  Measuring the effectiveness of the Odomzo Pregnancy Prevention Programs in agreement with 
National Competent Authority. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.1 could be acceptable if the applicant 
implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC advice.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice with the following changes:  three analyses from phase II study 
(LDE225A2201), which is currently ongoing, is a condition of the marketing authorization as a post-
authorisation efficacy study (see Section 2.5.4 and 4). 
The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC and CHMP. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 2.3 with the following content:

Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
According to the primary 6-month analysis submitted (cut-off date 28 June 2013), in the pivotal A2201 
study ORR per central review for all patients (enrolled in the pEAS) was 36.4% (95% CI: 23.8, 50.4) 
and 33.6% (95% CI: 25.1, 43.0) for the 200-mg and 800-mg arms, respectively. Response rates met 
the predefined criteria for both treatment arms for point estimates to meet or exceed 30%. In the 
updated efficacy results (18-month analysis, cut-off 11 July 2014), the efficacy in the laBCC population 
was ORRs of 54.8% (95% CI: 38.7, 70.2) and 47.3% (95% CI: 36.9, 57.9) were reported for the 
sonidegib 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively, per central review in the pEAS, with 
consistent results observed in the FAS.  
In the mBCC population, ORRs of 7.7% (95%CI: 0.2, 36.0) and 17.4% (95%CI: 5.0, 38.8) were 
reported for the sonidegib 200-mg and 800-mg treatment arms, respectively, per central review. 
Following concerns raised by the assessment of the CHMP on the low number of patients treated, the 
low rate of response observed (with no reported cases of CR) at the proposed 200 mg dose and the 
unlikely clinical relevance of an effect on asymptomatic lesions, the applicant withdrew the indication in 
mBCC patients.   
Regarding PFS, in the laBCC population median PFS was 22.1 months with sonidegib 200 mg and 19.4 
months with sonidegib 800 mg.  No significant difference in durability of response between patients 
treated with 200 mg and 800 mg sonidegib dose was observed. Evaluation of PRO’s shows that, with 
the limitations related to the large standard error, the majority of patients appear to experience 
maintenance of their QoL during treatment with sonidegib. The aggressive behaviour of LaBCC can 
lead to pain, fatigue and severe disfigurement, which in turn, could impact on the physical and social 
function of individuals. With the clinical benefit observed, it is highly likely that treatment with 
sonidegib in laBCC patients may lead to an improvement of chances to surgery with curative intent, 
long lasting tumour reduction with cosmetics and/or functional improvement, healing of tumour 
ulceration, improvement in survival, in symptoms and/or health related quality of life. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The median DoR, and OS were not evaluable due to the high rate of censoring at the updated analysis 
(cut-off date11 July 2014), therefore, there is uncertainty on the effect of sonidegib in the long term 
on DoR and OS. The Applicant has committed to provide interim update (30 months) and final (42 
months) analyses post-approval.  The CHMP has imposed post-authorisation measures to address the 
uncertainty, requesting the submission of updated efficacy analyses, including analyses of outcomes by 
aggressive versus non-aggressive histological subtype at 30 months (to be submitted by 30th October 
2016) and 42 months (to be submitted by 30th October 2017) post-treatment. 
Preliminary data in 11 patients treated and achieving persistent response also after stopping of study 
treatment for reasons other than progression seem to suggest that following an initial sustained 
inhibition, Gli1 levels progressively increase, approaching baseline values at the time of radiological or 
clinical confirmation of progressive disease. Therefore, the CHMP has imposed the submission of an 
analysis of response to treatment and Gli1 levels for the entire study population at different time 
points (as already done for the selected sample of 11 patients).

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the sonidegib ADRs include muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, elevated 
blood CPK, musculoskeletal pain, weight decreased, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, myalgia, abdominal 
pain, headache, pain, and constipation. The most comment ADRs of sonidegib treatment are muscle 
cramps (49.9%), muscle pain (19%), hair loss (43%), alteration or loss of taste (38.0%), nausea 
(32.9%) or diarrhoea (24.1%). 
In all patients that were studied in the pivotal study A2201 with sonidegib at the recommended dosage 
(200 mg OD) 94.9% of all (79) patients encountered an adverse event and 30.4% a CTC AE grade 3 or 
4. Treatment discontinuation was reported in 17 (21.5%) of patients treated with sonidegib 200 mg 
and in 54 (36%) patients treated with 800 mg. Reasons for study discontinuation were in line with the 
safety profile of sonidegib. Muscle spasms (3.8% of patients in the 200 mg group) formed the main 
reason. Dysgeusia was reported in 2.5%. Also loss of weight (2.5%) and nausea (2.5%) were reasons 
to study withdrawal.          
The results of the 18-month update safety analysis were in line with the original 6-month analysis. 
The pattern of ADRs observed appears to be similar to the recently approved vismodegib.  
The risk of teratogenicity and embryotoxicity to the foetus is a known adverse drug reaction for Hh 
inhbitors such as sonidegib. Therefore, specific warnings have been implemented in the SmPC on the 
risk to the foetus and the recommendations on using effective contraception. A pregnancy prevention 
programme has been implemented and key elements of this program include awareness in the product 
information, HCP and patient educational material and a reminder card. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The relatively small safety database of short follow-up of 18 months still represents one of the 
limitations in the evaluation of the safety related to sonidegib since long term safety effects (e.g. 
second primary malignancy induction, cardiac events) may still be underreported. The CHMP has 
imposed a post-authorisation measure to submit updated safety data. 
There is uncertainty on the effects of sonidegib on the heart and skeletal muscle. The increased 
myoglobin levels in patients were of concern although rhabdomyolysis did not seem to involve toxicity 
of the heart muscle. This risk has been included in the SmPC and in the RMP. The effect of sonidegib 
on cardiac function is uncertain.  The occurrence of sonidegib induced QTcF prolongation still suggests 
a potential arrhythmogenic effect, but no clinically relevant abnormalities have been observed. This 
risk has been highlighted in the SmPC as well as in the RMP. 
A class effect ADR known for Hh inhibitors is the risk for secondary malignancies. The risk will be 
monitored with the PSUR. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Sonidegib has shown long-lasting tumour shrinkage in a substantial subgroup of laBCC patients 
treated, a clinically relevant ORR that appears to have had cosmetic and functional improvement 
achieved in this patient population, as supported by the documented photographic evidence of lesions.  
Durability of response was also documented by the PFS results. The safety of sonidegib appears to be 
manageable (with SmPC recommendations and additional risk minimisation activities) and as expected 
Page 118/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in this therapeutic class. There is uncertainty on the risk of carcinogenicity with long term use of 
sonidegib. Therefore, the CHMP has imposed a non-clinical post-authorisation study to evaluate the 
potential of carcinogenicity in rats. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the totality of the data from the pivotal study, the benefits of sonidegib treatment in adult 
patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) who are not amenable to curative surgery or 
radiation therapy outweighed the risks. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance for 
sonidegib in the proposed indication is positive.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
In patients with laBCC, treatment with sonidegib met the pre-specified 30% criteria in terms of ORR, 
supporting the proposed indication at the proposed dose regimen of 200 mg OD. The PFS results, as 
well as several sensitivity analyses provided in the updated 18-month analysis provide further 
reassurance on the durability of the responses and the robustness of the primary analyses.  The ADRs 
for sonidegib treatment appear manageable at the 200 mg QD dose and have been adequately 
addressed in the SmPC and RMP with appropriate recommendations on the management of the 
important identified risks such as muscle related events. Women of childbearing age are advised to use 
effective contraception when being treated with sonidegib as there is a clear risk to the foetus given 
that Hh inhibitors have a teratogenic potential. Therefore, the implementation of a pregnancy 
prevention programme and dissemination of educational material for the HCP and patients is required 
in order to communicate the risks of sonidegib treatment to the foetus. These measures have been 
addressed in a satisfactory manner as part of the RMP (additional risk minimisation activities) and as 
Annex II conditions to the MA.

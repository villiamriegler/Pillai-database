CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Adults  
Wegovy is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight 
management, including weight loss and weight maintenance, in adults with an initial Body Mass Index 
(BMI) of  
• 
• 
≥30 kg/m2 (obesity), or  
≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbidity 
e.g. dysglycaemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus), hypertension, dyslipidaemia, 
obstructive sleep apnoea or cardiovascular disease. 
Adolescents (≥12 years) 
Wegovy is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight 
management in adolescents ages 12 years and above with  
• 
• 
obesity* and 
body weight above 60 kg. 
Treatment with Wegovy should be discontinued and re-evaluated if adolescent patients have not 
reduced their BMI by at least 5% after 12 weeks on the 2.4 mg or maximum tolerated dose. 
*Obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile) as defined on sex- and age-specific BMI growth charts (CDC.gov) (see Table 1).

4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Adults 
The maintenance dose of semaglutide 2.4 mg once-weekly is reached by starting with a dose of 
0.25 mg. To reduce the likelihood of gastrointestinal symptoms, the dose should be escalated over a 
16-week period to a maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly (see Table 2). In case of significant 
gastrointestinal symptoms, consider delaying dose escalation or lowering to the previous dose until 
symptoms have improved. Weekly doses higher than 2.4 mg are not recommended.

Maintenance dose   2.4 mg 
Adolescents 
For adolescents ages 12 years and above, the same dose escalation schedule as for adults should be 
applied (see Table 2). The dose should be increased until 2.4 mg (maintenance dose) or maximum 
tolerated dose has been reached. Weekly doses higher than 2.4 mg are not recommended. 
Patients with type 2 diabetes 
When initiating semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes, consider reducing the dose of 
concomitantly administered insulin or insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) to reduce the risk 
of hypoglycaemia, see section 4.4.  
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible and within 5 days after the missed 
dose. If more than 5 days have passed, the missed dose should be skipped, and the next dose should be 
administered on the regularly scheduled day. In each case, patients can then resume their regular once 
weekly dosing schedule. If more doses are missed, reducing the starting dose for re-initiation should 
be considered. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥65 years old) 
No dose adjustment is required based on age. Therapeutic experience in patients ≥75 years of age is 
limited, and greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be excluded. 
Patients with renal impairment  
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Experience with 
the use of semaglutide in patients with severe renal impairment is limited. Semaglutide is not 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2) including 
patients with end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2). 
Patients with hepatic impairment  
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Experience 
with the use of semaglutide in patients with severe hepatic impairment is limited. Semaglutide is not 
recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be used cautiously in 
patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
No dose adjustment is required for adolescents ages 12 years and above. 
The safety and efficacy of semaglutide in children below 12 years of age have not been established. 
Method of administration 
Subcutaneous use. 
Wegovy is administered once weekly at any time of the day, with or without meals.  
It is to be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, in the thigh or in the upper arm. The injection site 
can be changed. It should not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. 
The day of weekly administration can be changed if necessary, as long as the time between two doses 
is at least 3 days (>72 hours). After selecting a new dosing day, once-weekly dosing should be 
continued. 
When administering Wegovy pre-filled pen for single use, the pen should be pressed firmly against the 
skin until the yellow bar has stopped moving. The injection takes about 5–10 seconds.  
Patients should be advised to read the instruction for use included in the package leaflet carefully 
before administering the medicinal product. 
For further information before administration see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Dehydration 
Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions that can 
cause dehydration, which in rare cases can lead to a deterioration of renal function. 
Patients should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to gastrointestinal side effects 
and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. 
Acute pancreatitis 
Acute pancreatitis has been observed with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
suspected, semaglutide should be discontinued; if confirmed, semaglutide should not be restarted. 
Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis. 
In the absence of other signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic enzymes 
alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis. 
Patients with type 2 diabetes 
Semaglutide should not be used as a substitute for insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
Semaglutide should not be used in combination with other GLP-1 receptor agonist products. It has not 
been evaluated and an increased risk of adverse reactions related to overdose is considered likely. 
Hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes 
Insulin and sulfonylurea are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Patients treated with semaglutide in 
combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of 
hypoglycaemia can be lowered by reducing the dose of sulfonylurea or insulin when initiating 
treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The addition of Wegovy in patients treated with insulin has 
not been evaluated.  
Diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes 
In patients with diabetic retinopathy treated with semaglutide, an increased risk of developing diabetic 
retinopathy complications has been observed (see section 4.8). Rapid improvement in glucose control 
has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy, but other mechanisms cannot 
be excluded. Patients with diabetic retinopathy using semaglutide should be monitored closely and 
treated according to clinical guidelines. There is no experience with Wegovy in patients with type 2 
diabetes with uncontrolled or potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy. In these patients, treatment 
with Wegovy is not recommended.

Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Semaglutide delays gastric emptying and could potentially influence the absorption of concomitantly 
administered oral medicinal products. No clinically relevant effect on the rate of gastric emptying was 
observed with semaglutide 2.4 mg, probably due to a tolerance effect. Semaglutide should be used 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with caution in patients receiving oral medicinal products that require rapid gastrointestinal 
absorption. 
Paracetamol 
Semaglutide delays the rate of gastric emptying as assessed by paracetamol pharmacokinetics during a 
standardised meal test. Paracetamol AUC0-60min and Cmax were decreased by 27% and 23%, 
respectively, following concomitant use of semaglutide 1 mg. The total paracetamol exposure 
(AUC0-5h) was not affected. No clinically relevant effect on paracetamol was observed with 
semaglutide. No dose adjustment of paracetamol is necessary when administered with semaglutide. 
Oral contraceptives 
Semaglutide is not anticipated to decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. It did not change 
the overall exposure of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel to a clinically relevant degree, when an oral 
contraceptive combination medicinal product (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol/0.15 mg levonorgestrel) was 
co-administered with semaglutide. Exposure of ethinylestradiol was not affected; an increase of 20% 
was observed for levonorgestrel exposure at steady state. Cmax was not affected for any of the 
compounds. 
Atorvastatin 
Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure of atorvastatin following a single dose administration 
of atorvastatin (40 mg). Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38%. This was assessed not to be 
clinically relevant. 
Digoxin 
Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure or Cmax of digoxin following a single dose of digoxin 
(0.5 mg). 
Metformin 
Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure or Cmax of metformin following dosing of 500 mg 
twice daily over 3.5 days. 
Warfarin 
Semaglutide did not change overall exposure or Cmax of R- and S-warfarin following a single dose of 
warfarin (25 mg), and the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin as measured by the international 
normalised ratio were not affected in a clinically relevant manner. However, upon initiation of 
semaglutide treatment in patients on warfarin or other coumarin derivatives, frequent monitoring of 
international normalised ratio (INR) is recommended. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential are recommended to use contraception when treated with 
semaglutide (see section 4.5). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). There are limited data from the 
use of semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. 
If a patient wishes to become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, semaglutide should be discontinued. 
Semaglutide should be discontinued at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long half-
life (see section 5.2). 
Breast-feeding 
In lactating rats, semaglutide was excreted in milk. A risk to a breast-fed child cannot be excluded. 
Semaglutide should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
The effect of semaglutide on fertility in humans is unknown. Semaglutide did not affect male fertility 
in rats. In female rats, an increase in oestrous length and a small reduction in number of ovulations 
were observed at doses associated with maternal body weight loss. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Semaglutide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, dizziness 
can be experienced mainly during the dose escalation period. Driving or use of machines should be 
done cautiously if dizziness occurs. 
Patients with type 2 diabetes 
If semaglutide is used in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, patients should be advised to take 
precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines (see section 4.4). 
4.8  Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
Over the 68 weeks trial period, nausea occurred in 43.9% of patients when treated with semaglutide 
(16.1% for placebo), diarrhoea in 29.7% (15.9% for placebo) and vomiting in 24.5% (6.3% for 
placebo). Most events were mild to moderate in severity and of short duration. Constipation occurred 
in 24.2% of patients treated with semaglutide (11.1% for placebo) and was mild to moderate in 
severity and of longer duration. In patients treated with semaglutide, median duration of nausea was 8 
days, vomiting 2 days, diarrhoea 3 days, and constipation 47 days. 
Patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2) may experience more 
gastrointestinal effects when treated with semaglutide. 
The gastrointestinal events led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 4.3% of patients. 
Acute pancreatitis 
The frequency of adjudication-confirmed acute pancreatitis reported in phase 3a clinical trials was 
0.2% for semaglutide and <0.1% for placebo, respectively.  
Acute gallstone disease/Cholelithiasis 
Cholelithiasis was reported in 1.6% and led to cholecystitis in 0.6% of patients treated with 
semaglutide. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis was reported in 1.1% and 0.3%, respectively, of patients 
treated with placebo.

Hair loss 
Hair loss was reported in 2.5% of patients treated with semaglutide and in 1.0% of patients treated 
with placebo. The events were mainly of mild severity and most patients recovered while on continued 
treatment. Hair loss was reported more frequently in patients with a greater weight loss (≥20%). 
Increased heart rate  
In the phase 3a trials, a mean increase of 3 beats per minute (bpm) from a baseline mean of 72 bpm 
was observed in patients treated with semaglutide. The proportions of subjects with an increase in 
pulse from baseline ≥10 bpm at any timepoint during the on-treatment period were 67.0% in the 
semaglutide group vs. 50.1% in the placebo group. 
Immunogenicity 
Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing proteins or 
peptides, patients may develop antibodies following treatment with semaglutide. The proportion of 
patients testing positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies at any time post-baseline was low (2.9%) and 
no patients had anti-semaglutide neutralising antibodies or anti-semaglutide antibodies with 
endogenous GLP-1 neutralising effect at end-of-trial. During treatment, high semaglutide 
concentrations might have lowered the sensitivity of the assays, hence the risk of false negatives 
cannot be excluded. However, in subjects testing positive for antibodies during and after treatment, the 
presence of antibodies was transient and with no apparent impact on efficacy and safety. 
Hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes 
In STEP 2, clinically significant hypoglycaemia was observed in 6.2% (0.1 events/patient year) of 
subjects treated with semaglutide compared with 2.5% (0.03 events/patient year) of subjects treated 
with placebo. Hypoglycaemia with semaglutide was seen both with and without concomitant use of 
sulfonylurea. One episode (0.2% of subjects, 0.002 events/patient year) was reported as severe in a 
subject not concomitantly treated with a sulfonylurea. The risk of hypoglycaemia was increased when 
semaglutide was used with a sulfonylurea.  
Diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes 
A 2-year clinical trial investigated semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg vs. placebo in 3,297 patients with 
type 2 diabetes, with high cardiovascular risk, long duration of diabetes and poorly controlled blood 
glucose. In this trial, adjudicated events of diabetic retinopathy complications occurred in more 
patients treated with semaglutide (3.0%) compared to placebo (1.8%). This was observed in insulin-
treated patients with known diabetic retinopathy. The treatment difference appeared early and 
persisted throughout the trial. In STEP 2, retinal disorders were reported by 6.9% of patients treated 
with Wegovy, 6.2% of patients treated with semaglutide 1 mg, and 4.2% of patients treated with 
placebo. The majority of events were reported as diabetic retinopathy (4.0%, 2.7%, and 2.7%, 
respectively) and non-proliferative retinopathy (0.7%, 0%, and 0%, respectively). 
Paediatric population 
In a clinical trial conducted in adolescents of 12 years to below 18 years with obesity or overweight 
with at least one weight-related comorbidity, 133 patients were exposed to Wegovy. The trial duration 
was 68 weeks. 
Overall, the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in the adolescents were comparable to 
that observed in the adult population. Cholelithiasis was reported in 3.8% of patients treated with 
Wegovy and 0% of patients treated with placebo. 
No effects on growth or pubertal development were found after 68 weeks of treatment. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Overdose with semaglutide may be associated with gastrointestinal disorders which could lead to 
dehydration. In the event of overdose the patient should be observed for clinical signs and appropriate 
supportive treatment initiated.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, ATC 
code: A10BJ06 
Mechanism of action 
Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with 94% sequence homology to human GLP-1. Semaglutide acts as 
a GLP-1 receptor agonist that selectively binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, the target for 
native GLP-1. 
GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and calorie intake, and the GLP-1 receptor is present in 
several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation.  
Animal studies show that semaglutide works in the brain through the GLP-1 receptor. Semaglutide has 
direct effects on areas in the brain involved in homeostatic regulation of food intake in the 
hypothalamus and the brainstem. Semaglutide may affect the hedonic reward system through direct 
and indirect effects in brain areas including the septum, thalamus and amygdala. 
Clinical studies show that semaglutide reduces energy intake, increases feelings of satiety, fullness and 
control of eating, reduces feelings of hunger, and frequency and intensity of cravings. In addition, 
semaglutide reduces the preference for high fat foods. 
Semaglutide orchestrates the homeostatic and hedonic contributions with executive function to 
regulate caloric intake, appetite, reward and food choice. 
In addition, in clinical studies semaglutide have shown to reduce blood glucose in a glucose dependent 
manner by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion when blood glucose is high. 
The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying in the early 
postprandial phase. During hypoglycaemia, semaglutide diminishes insulin secretion and does not 
impair glucagon secretion.  
GLP-1 receptors are also expressed in the heart, vasculature, immune system and kidneys. 
Semaglutide has a beneficial effect on plasma lipids, lowered systolic blood pressure and reduced 
inflammation in clinical studies. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that semaglutide attenuated 
the development of atherosclerosis and had an anti-inflammatory action in the cardiovascular system. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Appetite, energy intake and food choice 
Semaglutide reduces appetite by increasing feelings of fullness and satiety, while lowering hunger and 
prospective food consumption. In a phase 1 trial, energy intake during an ad libitum meal was 35% 
lower with semaglutide compared to placebo after 20 weeks of dosing. This was supported by 
improved control of eating, less food cravings and a relative lower preference for high fat food. Food 
cravings were further assessed in STEP 5 by a Control of Eating Questionnaire (CoEQ). At week 104, 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the estimated treatment difference both for control of cravings and craving of savoury food 
significantly favoured semaglutide, whereas no clear effect was seen for craving of sweet food. 
Fasting and postprandial lipids  
Semaglutide 1 mg compared to placebo lowered fasting triglyceride and very low density lipoproteins 
(VLDL) concentrations by 12% and 21%, respectively. The postprandial triglyceride and VLDL 
response to a high fat meal was reduced with >40%. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of semaglutide for weight management in combination with a reduced calorie 
intake and increased physical activity were evaluated in four 68 weeks double-blinded randomised 
placebo-controlled phase 3a trials (STEP 1-4). A total of 4,684 adult patients (2,652 randomised to 
treatment with semaglutide) were included in these trials. Furthermore, the two-year efficacy and 
safety of semaglutide compared to placebo were evaluated in a double-blinded randomised placebo-
controlled phase 3b trial (STEP 5) including 304 patients (152 in treatment with semaglutide). 
Treatment with semaglutide demonstrated superior, clinically meaningful, and sustained weight loss 
compared with placebo in patients with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), or overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2 to 
<30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbidity. Furthermore, across the trials, a higher 
proportion of patients achieved ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15% and ≥20% weight loss with semaglutide compared 
with placebo. The reduction in body weight occurred irrespective of the presence of gastrointestinal 
symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. 
Treatment with semaglutide also showed statistically significant improvements in waist 
circumference, systolic blood pressure and physical functioning compared to placebo.  
Efficacy was demonstrated regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body weight, BMI, 
presence of type 2 diabetes and level of renal function. Variations in efficacy existed within all 
subgroups. Relatively greater weight loss was observed in women and in patients without type 2 
diabetes as well as in patients with a lower versus higher baseline body weight. 
STEP 1: Weight management 
In a 68-week double-blind trial, 1,961 patients with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), or with overweight 
(BMI ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbidity were randomised to 
semaglutide or placebo. All patients were on a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity 
throughout the trial. 
Weight loss occurred early and continued throughout the trial. At end of treatment (week 68), the 
weight loss was superior and clinically meaningful compared with placebo (see Table 4 and Figure 1). 
Furthermore, a higher proportion of patients achieved ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15% and ≥20% weight loss with 
semaglutide compared with placebo (see Table 4). Among patients with prediabetes at baseline, a 
higher proportion of patients had a normo-glycaemic status at end of treatment with semaglutide 
compared to placebo (84.1% vs. 47.8%).

Following the 68-week trial, a 52-week off-treatment extension was conducted including 327 patients 
who had completed the main trial period on the maintenance dose of semaglutide or placebo. In the 
off-treatment period from week 68 to week 120, mean body weight increased in both treatment 
groups. However, for patients that had been treated with semaglutide for the main trial period the 
weight remained 5.6% below baseline compared to 0.1% for the placebo group.

STEP 2: Weight management in patients with type 2 diabetes 
In a 68-week, double-blind trial, 1,210 patients with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) and 
type 2 diabetes were randomised to either semaglutide 2.4 mg, semaglutide 1 mg once-weekly or 
placebo. Patients included in the trial had insufficiently controlled diabetes (HbA1c 7–10%) and were 
treated with either: diet and exercise alone or 1–3 oral antidiabetic drugs. All patients were on a 
reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity throughout the trial. 
Treatment with semaglutide for 68 weeks resulted in superior and clinically meaningful reduction in 
body weight and in HbA1c compared to placebo (see Table 5 and Figure 2).

STEP 4: Sustained weight management 
In a 68-week double-blind trial, 902 patients with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), or with overweight (BMI 
≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbidity were included in the trial. All 
patients were on a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity throughout the trial. From week 
0 to week 20 (run-in), all patients received semaglutide. At week 20 (baseline), patients who had 
reached the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg were randomised to continue treatment or switch to placebo. 
At week 0 (start of run-in period) patients had a mean body weight of 107.2 kg and a mean BMI of 
38.4 kg/m2. 
Patients who had reached the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg at week 20 (baseline) and continued 
treatment with semaglutide for 48 weeks (week 20–68) continued losing weight and had a superior 
and clinically meaningful reduction in body weight compared to those switched to placebo (see Table 
7 and Figure 3). The body weight increased steadily from week 20 to week 68 in patients switching to 
placebo at week 20 (baseline). Nevertheless, the observed mean body weight was lower at week 68 
than at start of the run-in period (week 0) (see Figure 3). Patients treated with semaglutide from week 
0 (run-in) to week 68 (end of treatment) achieved a mean change in body weight of -17.4%, with 
weight loss ≥5% achieved by 87.8%, ≥10% achieved by 78.0%, ≥15% achieved by 62.2% and ≥20% 
achieved by 38.6% of these patients.

STEP 5: 2-year data 
In a 104-week double-blind trial, 304 patients with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), or with overweight 
(BMI ≥27 to <30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbidity, were randomised to semaglutide 
or placebo. All patients were on a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity throughout the 
trial. At baseline, patients had a mean BMI of 38.5 kg/m2, a mean body weight of 106.0 kg. 
Treatment with semaglutide for 104 weeks resulted in a superior and clinically meaningful reduction 
in body weight compared to placebo. Mean body weight decreased from baseline through to week 68  
with semaglutide after which a plateau was reached. With placebo, mean body weight decreased less, 
and a plateau was reached after approximately 20 weeks of treatment (see Table 8 and Figure 4). 
Patients treated with semaglutide achieved a mean change in body weight of -15.2%, with weight loss 
≥5% achieved by 74.7%, ≥10% achieved by 59.2% and ≥15% achieved by 49.7% of these patients. 
Among patients with prediabetes at baseline, 80% and 37% achieved a normo-glycaemic status at end 
of treatment with semaglutide and placebo, respectively.

STEP 8: Semaglutide vs liraglutide 
In a 68-week, randomised, open-label, pairwise placebo-controlled trial, 338 patients with obesity 
(BMI ≥30 kg/m2), or with overweight (BMI ≥27 to <30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related 
comorbidity, were randomised to semaglutide once weekly, liraglutide 3 mg once daily or placebo. 
Semaglutide once weekly and liraglutide 3 mg were open-label, but each active treatment group was 
double-blinded against placebo administered at the same dosing frequency. All patients were on a 
reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity throughout the trial. At baseline, patients had a 
mean BMI of 37.5 kg/m2, a mean body weight of 104.5 kg.  
Treatment with semaglutide once weekly for 68 weeks resulted in superior and clinically meaningful 
reduction in body weight compared to liraglutide. Mean body weight decreased from baseline through 
to week 68 with semaglutide. With liraglutide, mean body weight decreased less (see Table 9). 37.4% 
of the patients treated with semaglutide lost ≥20%, compared to 7.0% treated with liraglutide. Table 9 
shows the results of the confirmatory endpoints ≥10%, ≥15% and ≥20% weight loss.

Effect on body composition 
In a sub-study in STEP 1 (N = 140), body composition was measured using dual energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DEXA). The results of the DEXA assessment showed that treatment with semaglutide 
was accompanied by greater reduction in fat mass than in lean body mass leading to an improvement 
in body composition compared to placebo after 68 weeks. Furthermore, this reduction in total fat mass 
was accompanied by a reduction in visceral fat. These results suggest that most of the total weight loss 
was attributable to a reduction in fat tissue, including visceral fat. 
Improvement in physical functioning 
Semaglutide showed small improvements in physical functioning scores. Physical functioning was 
assessed using both the generic health-related quality of life questionnaire Short Form-36v2 Health 
Survey, Acute Version (SF-36) and the obesity-specific questionnaire Impact of Weight on Quality of 
Life Lite Clinical Trials Version (IWQOL-Lite-CT). 
Cardiovascular evaluation 
In the SUSTAIN 6 trial, 3,297 patients with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes and at high risk of 
cardiovascular events were randomised to semaglutide s.c. 0.5 mg or 1 mg once-weekly or placebo in 
addition to standard-of-care. The treatment duration was 104 weeks. The mean age was 65 years and 
the mean BMI was 33 kg/m2.  
The primary endpoint was the time from randomisation to first occurrence of a major adverse 
cardiovascular event (MACE): cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal 
stroke. The total number of the MACE was 254, including 108 (6.6%) with semaglutide and 146 
(8.9%) with placebo. 
The cardiovascular safety of treatment with semaglutide 0.5 or 1 mg was confirmed as the hazard ratio 
(HR) for semaglutide vs. placebo was 0.74, [0.58, 0.95] [95% CI], driven by a decrease in the rate of 
non-fatal stroke and non-fatal myocardial infarction with no difference in cardiovascular death (see 
Figure 5).

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Wegovy in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of weight management 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
STEP TEENS: Weight management in adolescent patients 
In a 68-week double-blind trial 201 pubertal adolescents, ages 12 to <18 years, with obesity or 
overweight and at least one weight-related comorbidity were randomised 2:1 to semaglutide or 
placebo. All patients were on a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity throughout the 
trial. 
At end of treatment (week 68), the improvement in BMI with semaglutide was superior and clinically 
meaningful compared with placebo (see Table 10 and Figure 6). Furthermore, a higher proportion of 
patients achieved ≥5%, 10% and ≥15% weight loss with semaglutide compared with placebo (see 
Table 10).

1 Estimated using an ANCOVA model using multiple imputation based on all data irrespective of discontinuation of 
randomised treatment or initiation of other anti-obesity medication or bariatric surgery.  
2 During the trial, randomised treatment was permanently discontinued by 10.4% and 10.4% of patients randomised to 
semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo, respectively. Assuming that all randomised patients stayed on treatment and did not receive 
additional anti-obesity therapies, the estimated changes from randomisation to week 68 for BMI based on a Mixed Model for 
Repeated Measures including all observations until first discontinuation were -17.9% and 0.6% for semaglutide 2.4 mg and 
placebo respectively

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Compared to native GLP-1, semaglutide has a prolonged half-life of around 1 week making it suitable 
for once weekly subcutaneous administration. The principal mechanism of protraction is albumin 
binding, which results in decreased renal clearance and protection from metabolic degradation. 
Furthermore, semaglutide is stabilised against degradation by the DPP-4 enzyme. 
Absorption 
The average semaglutide steady state concentration following s.c. administration of the semaglutide 
maintenance dose was approximately 75 nmol/L in patients with overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2 to 
<30 kg/m2) or obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) based on data from phase 3a trials, where 90% of patients had 
average concentrations between 51 nmol/L and 110 nmol/L. The steady state exposure of semaglutide 
increased proportionally with doses from 0.25 mg up to 2.4 mg once weekly. Steady state exposure 
was stable with time as assessed up to week 68. Similar exposure was achieved with s.c. 
administration of semaglutide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. The absolute bioavailability of 
semaglutide was 89%. 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution of semaglutide following s.c. administration in patients with 
overweight or obesity was approximately 12.4 L. Semaglutide is extensively bound to plasma albumin 
(>99%). 
Metabolism/biotransformation 
Prior to excretion, semaglutide is extensively metabolised through proteolytic cleavage of the peptide 
backbone and sequential beta-oxidation of the fatty acid side chain. The enzyme neutral endopeptidase 
(NEP) was identified as one of the active metabolic enzymes. 
Elimination 
The primary excretion routes of semaglutide-related material are via the urine and faeces. 
Approximately 3% of the absorbed dose was excreted in the urine as intact semaglutide. 
The clearance of semaglutide in patients with overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2) or obesity 
(BMI ≥30 kg/m2) was approximately 0.05 L/h. With an elimination half-life of approximately 1 week, 
semaglutide will be present in the circulation for approximately 7 weeks after the last dose of 2.4 mg.

Special populations 
Elderly 
Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide based on data from phase 3 trials including 
patients 18–86 years of age. 
Gender, race and ethnicity 
Gender, race (White, Black or African American, Asian) and ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, non-
Hispanic or -Latino) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide based on data from phase 
3a trials. 
Body weight 
Body weight had an effect on the exposure of semaglutide. Higher body weight was associated with 
lower exposure; a 20% difference in body weight between individuals will result in an approximate 
18% difference in exposure. The 2.4 mg weekly dose of semaglutide provided adequate systemic 
exposures over the body weight range of 54.4−245.6 kg evaluated for exposure response in the clinical 
trials. 
Renal impairment 
Renal impairment did not impact the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide in a clinically relevant manner. 
This was shown with a single dose of 0.5 mg semaglutide for patients with different degrees of renal 
impairment (mild, moderate, severe or patients in dialysis) compared with patients with normal renal 
function. This was also shown for patients with overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2) or obesity 
(BMI ≥30 kg/m2) and mild to moderate renal impairment based on data from phase 3a trials. 
Hepatic impairment 
Hepatic impairment did not have any impact on the exposure of semaglutide. The pharmacokinetics of 
semaglutide were evaluated in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, 
severe) and compared with patients with normal hepatic function in a study with a single dose of 
0.5 mg semaglutide. 
Prediabetes and diabetes 
Prediabetes and diabetes did not have any clinically relevant effect on the exposure of semaglutide 
based on data from phase 3 trials. 
Immunogenicity 
Development of anti-semaglutide antibodies when treated with semaglutide occurred infrequently (see 
section 4.8) and the response did not appear to influence semaglutide pharmacokinetics.  
Paediatrics 
Pharmacokinetic properties for semaglutide were assessed in a clinical trial for adolescent patients 
with obesity or overweight and at least one weight-related comorbidity ages 12 to <18 years 
(124 patients, body weight 61.6-211.9 kg). The semaglutide exposure in adolescents was similar to 
that in adults with obesity or overweight. 
Safety and efficacy of semaglutide in children below 12 years of age have not been studied.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity or genotoxicity. 
Non-lethal thyroid C-cell tumours observed in rodents are a class effect for GLP-1 receptor agonists. 
In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, semaglutide caused thyroid C-cell tumours at 
clinically relevant exposures. No other treatment-related tumours were observed. The rodent C-cell 
tumours are caused by a non-genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor mediated mechanism to which 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rodents are particularly sensitive. The relevance for humans is considered to be low, but cannot be 
completely excluded. 
In fertility studies in rats, semaglutide did not affect mating performance or male fertility. In female 
rats, an increase in oestrous cycle length and a small reduction in corpora lutea (ovulations) were 
observed at doses associated with maternal body weight loss. 
In embryo-foetal development studies in rats, semaglutide caused embryotoxicity below clinically 
relevant exposures. Semaglutide caused marked reductions in maternal body weight and reductions in 
embryonic survival and growth. In foetuses, major skeletal and visceral malformations were observed, 
including effects on long bones, ribs, vertebrae, tail, blood vessels and brain ventricles. Mechanistic 
evaluations indicated that the embryotoxicity involved a GLP-1 receptor mediated impairment of the 
nutrient supply to the embryo across the rat yolk sac. Due to species differences in yolk sac anatomy 
and function, and due to lack of GLP-1 receptor expression in the yolk sac of non-human primates, 
this mechanism is considered unlikely to be of relevance to humans. However, a direct effect of 
semaglutide on the foetus cannot be excluded. 
In developmental toxicity studies in rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys, increased pregnancy loss and 
slightly increased incidence of foetal abnormalities were observed at clinically relevant exposures. The 
findings coincided with marked maternal body weight loss of up to 16%. Whether these effects are 
related to the decreased maternal food consumption as a direct GLP-1 effect is unknown. 
Postnatal growth and development were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys. Infants were slightly 
smaller at delivery but recovered during the lactation period. 
In juvenile rats, semaglutide caused delayed sexual maturation in both males and females. These 
delays had no impact upon fertility and reproductive capacity of either sex, or on the ability of the 
females to maintain pregnancy.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Wegovy is and what it is used for 
What Wegovy is 
Wegovy is a medicine for weight loss and weight maintenance that contains the active substance 
semaglutide. It is similar to a natural hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that is released 
from the intestine after a meal. It works by acting on targets (receptors) in the brain that control your 
appetite, causing you to feel fuller and less hungry and experience less craving for food. This will help 
you eat less food and reduce your body weight. 
What Wegovy is used for 
Wegovy is used together with diet and physical activity for weight loss and to help keep the weight 
under control. It is used in adults, who have 
• 
• 
a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater (obesity) or 
a BMI of at least 27 kg/m² but less than 30 kg/m² (overweight) who have weight-related health 
problems (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of fats in the blood, breathing 
problems during sleep called ‘obstructive sleep apnoea’ or a history of heart attack, stroke or 
blood vessel problems). 
BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. 
Wegovy is used together with diet and physical activity for weight management in adolescents ages 
12 years and above, who have 
• 
• 
obesity and 
body weight >60 kg. 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As an adolescent patient, you should only continue using Wegovy if you have lost at least 5% of your 
BMI after 12 weeks on the 2.4 mg dose or maximum tolerated dose (see section 3). Consult your 
doctor before you continue. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Wegovy 
Do not use Wegovy 
• 
if you are allergic to semaglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Wegovy.  
The use of Wegovy is not recommended if you: 
use other products for weight loss, 
• 
have type 1 diabetes, 
• 
have severely reduced kidney function, 
• 
have severely reduced liver function, 
• 
have severe heart failure, 
• 
have diabetic eye disease (retinopathy). 
• 
There is little experience with Wegovy in patients: 
• 
• 
• 
of 75 years and older, 
with liver problems, 
with severe stomach or gut problem which results in delayed stomach emptying (called 
gastroparesis), or if you have an inflammatory bowel disease. 
Please consult your doctor if one of the above applies to you. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Dehydration 
During treatment with Wegovy, you may feel sick (nausea) or be sick (vomiting), or have 
diarrhoea. These side effects can cause dehydration (loss of fluids). It is important that you 
drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration. This is especially important if you have kidney 
problems. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns. 
Inflammation of the pancreas 
If you have severe and on-going pain in the stomach area (see section 4) – see a doctor straight 
away as this could be a sign of inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis). 
People with type 2 diabetes 
Wegovy cannot be used as a substitute for insulin. Do not use Wegovy in combination with 
other medicines that contain GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide 
or lixisenatide). 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) 
Taking a sulfonylurea or an insulin with Wegovy might increase the risk of getting low blood 
sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). Please see section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar 
levels. Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar levels. This will help your doctor 
decide if the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin needs to be changed to reduce the risk of low 
blood sugar. 
Diabetic eye disease (retinopathy) 
If you have diabetic eye disease and are using insulin, this medicine may lead to a worsening of 
your vision, and this may require treatment. Fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead 
to a temporary worsening of diabetic eye disease. If you have diabetic eye disease and 
experience eye problems while taking this medicine, talk to your doctor.

Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy of Wegovy in children below 12 years of age have not been studied and are 
not recommended for use in this population. 
Other medicines and Wegovy 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using medicines containing the following:  
• 
Warfarin or other similar medicines taken by mouth to reduce blood clotting (oral anti-
coagulants). When you start treatment with e.g. wafarin or similar medicines, frequent blood 
testing to determine the ability of your blood to clot may be required. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine should not be used during pregnancy, as it is not known if it may affect your unborn 
child. Therefore, it is recommended to use contraception while using this medicine. If you wish to 
become pregnant, you should stop using this medicine at least two months in advance. If you become 
or are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby when using this medicine, 
talk to your doctor straight away, as your treatment will need to be stopped. 
Do not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding, as it is unknown if it passes into breast milk. 
Driving and using machines 
Wegovy is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. Some patients may feel dizzy 
when taking Wegovy mainly during the first 4 months of treatment (see section 4). If you feel dizzy be 
extra careful while driving or using machines. If you need any further information, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. 
People with type 2 diabetes 
If you use this medicine in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar 
(hypoglycaemia) may occur which may reduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using 
machines if you get any signs of low blood sugar. See section 2, ‘Warnings and precautions’ for 
information on increased risk of low blood sugar and section 4 for the warning signs of low blood 
sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information.  
Wegovy contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.

1.  What Wegovy is and what it is used for 
What Wegovy is 
Wegovy is a medicine for weight loss and weight maintenance that contains the active substance 
semaglutide. It is similar to a natural hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that is released 
from the intestine after a meal. It works by acting on targets (receptors) in the brain that control your 
appetite, causing you to feel fuller and less hungry and experience less craving for food. This will help 
you eat less food and reduce your body weight. 
What Wegovy is used for 
Wegovy is used together with diet and physical activity for weight loss and to help keep the weight 
under control. It is used in adults, who have 
• 
• 
a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater (obesity) or 
a BMI of at least 27 kg/m² but less than 30 kg/m² (overweight) who have weight-related health 
problems (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of fats in the blood, breathing 
problems during sleep called ‘obstructive sleep apnoea’ or a history of heart attack, stroke or 
blood vessel problems). 
BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. 
Wegovy is used together with diet and physical activity for weight management in adolescents ages 
12 years and above, who have 
• 
• 
obesity and 
body weight >60 kg. 
80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As an adolescent patient, you should only continue using Wegovy if you have lost at least 5% of your 
BMI after 12 weeks on the 2.4 mg dose or maximum tolerated dose (see section 3). Consult your 
doctor before you continue. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Wegovy 
Do not use Wegovy 
• 
if you are allergic to semaglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Wegovy. 
The use of Wegovy is not recommended if you: 
use other products for weight loss, 
• 
have type 1 diabetes, 
• 
have severely reduced kidney function, 
• 
have severely reduced liver function, 
• 
have severe heart failure, 
• 
have diabetic eye disease (retinopathy). 
• 
There is little experience with Wegovy in patients: 
• 
• 
• 
of 75 years and older, 
with liver problems, 
with severe stomach or gut problem which results in delayed stomach emptying (called 
gastroparesis), or if you have an inflammatory bowel disease. 
Please consult your doctor if one of the above applies to you. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Dehydration 
During treatment with Wegovy, you may feel sick (nausea) or be sick (vomiting), or have 
diarrhoea. These side effects can cause dehydration (loss of fluids). It is important that you 
drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration. This is especially important if you have kidney 
problems. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns. 
Inflammation of the pancreas 
If you have severe and on-going pain in the stomach area (see section 4) – see a doctor straight 
away as this could be a sign of inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis). 
People with type 2 diabetes 
Wegovy cannot be used as a substitute for insulin. Do not use Wegovy in combination with 
other medicines that contain GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide 
or lixisenatide). 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) 
Taking a sulfonylurea or an insulin with Wegovy might increase the risk of getting low blood 
sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). Please see section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar 
levels. Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar levels. This will help your doctor 
decide if the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin needs to be changed to reduce the risk of low

Other medicines and Wegovy 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using medicines containing the following:  
• 
Warfarin or other similar medicines taken by mouth to reduce blood clotting (oral anti-
coagulants). When you start treatment with e.g. wafarin or similar medicines, frequent blood 
testing to determine the ability of your blood to clot may be required. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine should not be used during pregnancy, as it is not known if it may affect your unborn 
child. Therefore, it is recommended to use contraception while using this medicine. If you wish to 
become pregnant, you should stop using this medicine at least two months in advance. If you become 
or are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby when using this medicine, 
talk to your doctor straight away, as your treatment will need to be stopped. 
Do not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding, as it is unknown if it passes into breast milk. 
Driving and using machines 
Wegovy is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. Some patients may feel dizzy 
when taking Wegovy mainly during the first 4 months of treatment (see section 4). If you feel dizzy be 
extra careful while driving or using machines. If you need any further information, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. 
People with type 2 diabetes 
If you use this medicine in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar 
(hypoglycaemia) may occur which may reduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using 
machines if you get any signs of low blood sugar. See section 2, ‘Warnings and precautions’ for 
information on increased risk of low blood sugar and section 4 for the warning signs of low blood 
sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information.

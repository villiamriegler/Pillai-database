Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Veltassa 
patiromer  
On 18 May 2017 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, 
recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Veltassa, intended for 
the treatment of hyperkalaemia. The applicant for this medicinal product is Vifor Fresenius Medical Care 
Renal Pharma France. 
Veltassa will be available as a powder for oral suspension (8.4 g, 16.8 g and 25.2 g). The active 
substance of Veltassa is patiromer (as patiromer sorbitex calcium), a non-absorbed, cation exchange 
polymer that contains a calcium-sorbitol complex (ATC code: V03AE09). Veltassa increases faecal 
potassium excretion by binding potassium in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in a 
reduction of serum potassium levels.  
The benefit with Veltassa is its ability to lower serum potassium levels. The most common side effects are 
hypomagnesaemia, constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and flatulence. 
The full indication is: "treatment of hyperkalaemia in adult patients".  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

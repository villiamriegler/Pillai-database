1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The study did not reveal any safety concerns. Compared to 
historical data, the exposure obtained in this study is 
similar to earlier study results. The small increase in 
exposure in patients with severe renal impairment or 
patients undergoing haemodialysis does not require dose 
adjustment. The information from this study on patients 
with reduced renal function has been included in the SPC.

HIV-infected patients since the end of the 80's. Although 
the cause of this disease could be due to multi factors 
(including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, 
severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index) it has 
occurred specially in patients with HIV advanced disease 
and/or in patients with long term use of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART). Further to the review of all 
available data the CHMP agreed that this information 
should now be included in the SPC and PL of all 
antiretroviral medicinal products. Patients should be 
warned to seek medical advice in case they experience joint 
stiffness, aches and pain especially of the hip, knee and 
shoulder or if they experienced any difficulty in movement.

In patients treated with any type of combination 
Package Leaflet 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory response to 
indolent or residual opportunistic infections may occur, 
when the immune system responds to treatment. 
In most cases, the inflammatory reactions towards the 
opportunistic pathogens in question cannot be foreseen 
since the opportunistic infection has not yet been detected/ 
diagnosed. if diagnosed prior to institution of CART, the 
treatment against the opportunistic infection (OI) is usually 
given priority. In particular, this is true for the 
complications most feared in this context; CMV-retinitis, 
generalised mycobacterial infectionsand Pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia. An additional reason for treating the OI 
and the HIV-infection sequentially, is the great risk of 
adverse events (toxicity or lack of effect) due to drug 
interactions. in conclusion, in most cases, the clinical 
consequences of the awakening immune system in patients 
starting ART cannot be prevented. therefore, early 
recognition and diagnosis of  these inflammatory reactions 
are important in the clinical handling of the patient.

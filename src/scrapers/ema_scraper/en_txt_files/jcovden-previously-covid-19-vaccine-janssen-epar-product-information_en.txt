4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Individuals 18 years of age and older
Primary vaccination
JCOVDEN is administered as a single-dose of 0.5 mL by intramuscular injection only.
2
Booster dose
A booster dose (second dose) of 0.5 mL of JCOVDEN may be administered intramuscularly at least 
2 months after the primary vaccination in individuals 18 years of age and older (see also sections 4.4, 
4.8 and 5.1).
A booster dose of JCOVDEN (0.5 mL) may be administered in individuals 18 years of age and older 
as a heterologous booster dose following completion of primary vaccination with an mRNA COVID-
19 vaccine or an adenoviral vector-based COVID-19 vaccine. The dosing interval for the heterologous 
booster dose is the same as that authorised for a booster dose of the vaccine used for primary 
vaccination (see also sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of JCOVDEN in children and adolescents (less than 18 years of age) have not 
yet been established. No data are available.
Elderly
No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age. See also sections 4.8 and 5.1.
Method of administration
JCOVDEN is for intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.
Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally.
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.
For instructions on handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
A history of confirmed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following vaccination 
with any COVID-19 vaccine (see also section 4.4).
Individuals who have previously experienced episodes of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) (see also 
section 4.4).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis
Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should 
always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the 
vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination.
3
Anxiety-related reactions
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related 
reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection.
It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.
Concurrent illness
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or acute 
infection. However, the presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay 
vaccination.
Coagulation disorders



Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome: A combination of thrombosis and 
thrombocytopenia, in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely
following vaccination with JCOVDEN. This includes severe cases of venous thrombosis at 
unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), splanchnic vein thrombosis as 
well as arterial thrombosis concomitant with thrombocytopenia. Fatal outcome has been 
reported. These cases occurred within the first three weeks following vaccination, and mostly in 
individuals under 60 years of age.
Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia requires specialised clinical management. 
Healthcare professionals should consult applicable guidance and/or consult specialists (e.g.,
haematologists, specialists in coagulation) to diagnose and treat this condition.
Individuals who have experienced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome following 
vaccination with any COVID-19 vaccine should not receive JCOVDEN (See also section 4.3).
Venous thromboembolism: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been observed rarely 
following vaccination with JCOVDEN (see section 4.8). This should be considered for 
individuals at increased risk for VTE.
Immune thrombocytopenia: Cases of immune thrombocytopenia with very low platelet levels 
(<20000 per μL) have been reported very rarely after vaccination with JCOVDEN, usually 
within the first four weeks after receiving JCOVDEN. This included cases with bleeding and 
cases with fatal outcome. Some of these cases occurred in individuals with a history of immune 
thrombocytopenia (ITP). If an individual has a history of ITP, the risks of developing low 
platelet levels should be considered before vaccination, and platelet monitoring is recommended 
after vaccination.
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or 
thrombocytopenia. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they 
develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain, leg swelling, or persistent 
abdominal pain following vaccination. Additionally, anyone with neurological symptoms including
severe or persistent headaches, seizures, mental status changes or blurred vision after vaccination, or 
who experiences spontaneous bleeding, skin bruising (petechia) beyond the site of vaccination after a 
few days, should seek prompt medical attention.
Individuals diagnosed with thrombocytopenia within 3 weeks after vaccination with JCOVDEN
should be actively investigated for signs of thrombosis. Similarly, individuals who present with 
thrombosis within 3 weeks of vaccination should be evaluated for thrombocytopenia.
Risk of bleeding with intramuscular administration
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as 
haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in 
these individuals.
4
Capillary leak syndrome
Very rare cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) have been reported in the first days after vaccination 
with JCOVDEN, in some cases with a fatal outcome. A history of CLS has been reported. CLS is a 
rare disorder characterised by acute episodes of oedema mainly affecting the limbs, hypotension, 
haemoconcentration and hypoalbuminaemia. Patients with an acute episode of CLS following 
vaccination require prompt recognition and treatment. Intensive supportive therapy is usually 
warranted. Individuals with a known history of CLS should not be vaccinated with this vaccine. See 
also section 4.3.
Guillain-Barré syndrome and transverse myelitis
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and transverse myelitis (TM) have been reported very rarely 
following vaccination with JCOVDEN. Healthcare professionals should be alert to GBS and TM signs 
and symptoms to ensure correct diagnosis, in order to initiate adequate supportive care and treatment 
and to rule out other causes.
Myocarditis and pericarditis
There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with JCOVDEN 
(section 4.8). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily 
occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often in males younger than 40 years of age. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms 
indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, 
or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or 
specialists to diagnose and treat these conditions.
Risk of severe adverse events after a booster dose
The risk of severe adverse events (such as coagulation disorders including thrombosis with 
thrombocytopenia syndrome, CLS, GBS, myocarditis and pericarditis) after a booster dose of 
JCOVDEN has not yet been characterised.
Immunocompromised individuals
The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine have not been assessed in 
immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy.
The efficacy of JCOVDEN may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals.
Duration of protection
The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by 
ongoing clinical trials.
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness
Protection starts around 14 days after vaccination. As with all vaccines, vaccination with JCOVDEN
may not protect all vaccine recipients (see section 5.1).
Excipients
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’.
5
Ethanol
This medicinal product contains 2 mg of alcohol (ethanol) per 0.5 mL dose. The small amount of 
alcohol in this medicinal product will not have any noticeable effects.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of JCOVDEN with other 
vaccines has not been studied.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There is limited experience with the use of JCOVDEN in pregnant women. Animal studies with 
JCOVDEN do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal 
development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).
Administration of JCOVDEN in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits 
outweigh any potential risks to the mother and foetus.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether JCOVDEN is excreted in human milk.
Fertility
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity
(see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
JCOVDEN has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of 
the adverse reactions mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use 
machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of safety profile
Primary vaccination (primary pooled analysis)
The safety of JCOVDEN was evaluated in the primary pooled analysis from the double-blind phase of 
the randomised, placebo-controlled studies COV1001, COV1002, COV2001, COV3001 and 
COV3009. A total of 38,538 adults aged 18 years and older received at least a single-dose primary 
vaccination of JCOVDEN. The median age of individuals was 52 years (range 18-100 years). For the 
primary pooled analysis, the median follow-up for individuals who received JCOVDEN was 
approximately 4 months after completion of primary vaccination. Longer safety follow-up of 
≥ 6 months is available for 6,136 adults who received JCOVDEN.
In the primary pooled analysis, the most common local adverse reactions reported was injection site 
pain (54.3%). The most common systemic adverse reactions were fatigue (44.0%), headache (43.0%),
myalgia (38.1%) and nausea (16.9%). Pyrexia (defined as body temperature ≥ 38.0°C) was observed 
in 7.2% of participants. Most adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity. Across the studies, 
most adverse reactions occurred within 1–2 days following vaccination and were of short duration (1–
2 days).
Reactogenicity was generally milder and reported less frequently in older adults .
6
The safety profile was generally consistent across participants with or without prior evidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. A total of 10.6% of individuals that received JCOVDEN were 
SARS-CoV-2 positive at baseline (based on serology or RT-PCR assessment).
Booster dose (second dose) following primary vaccination with JCOVDEN
The safety of a booster dose (second dose) with JCOVDEN administered approximately 2 months 
after the primary vaccination was evaluated in an ongoing randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled Phase 3 Study (COV3009). In the FAS (full analysis set), from the 15708 adults aged 
18 years and older who received 1 dose of JCOVDEN, a total of 8646 individuals received a second 
dose during the double-blind phase.
The safety of a booster dose (second dose) with JCOVDEN administered at least 6 months after the 
primary vaccination was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind Phase 2 Study (COV2008 Cohort 1 
N=330). 
Overall, the solicited adverse reaction profile for the homologous booster dose was similar to that after 
the first dose. There were no new safety signals identified.
Booster dose following primary vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine
Overall, in 3 clinical studies (including 2 independent studies) approximately 500 adults have received 
primary vaccination with 2 doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and received a single booster dose 
of JCOVDEN, at least 3 months after primary vaccination (COV2008, COV-BOOST and DMID 21-
0012 studies). There were no new safety concerns identified. However, a trend towards an increase in 
frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic adverse events after the heterologous booster 
dose was observed when compared with the homologous booster dose of JCOVDEN.
Booster dose following primary vaccination with an adenoviral vector-based COVID-19 vaccine
The safety of a heterologous booster dose of JCOVDEN was evaluated in the COV-BOOST study
following primary vaccination with an adenoviral vector-based COVID-19 vaccine. Participants 
received 2 doses of Vaxzevria (N=108) followed by a booster dose of JCOVDEN 77 days post second 
dose (median; IQR: 72-83 days). There were no new safety concerns identified.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported. In Phase 1/2 studies where a higher dose (up to 2-fold) was 
administered JCOVDEN remained well-tolerated, however vaccinated individuals reported an increase 
in reactogenicity (increased vaccination site pain, fatigue, headache, myalgia, nausea and pyrexia).
In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is 
recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: COVID-19, viral vector, non-replicating, ATC code: J07BN02
Mechanism of action
JCOVDEN is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant, replication-incompetent human 
adenovirus type 26 vector that encodes a SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) glycoprotein in a 
stabilised conformation. Following administration, the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is transiently 
expressed, stimulating both neutralising and other functional S-specific antibodies, as well as cellular 
immune responses directed against the S antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-
19.
Clinical efficacy
Efficacy from a single-dose primary vaccination
Primary analysis
A primary analysis (cut-off date 22 January 2021) of a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (COV3001) was conducted in the United States, South Africa and 
Latin American countries to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a single-dose primary 
vaccination of JCOVDEN for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and older. The 
study excluded individuals with abnormal function of the immune system resulting from a clinical 
condition, individuals who are under immunosuppressive therapies within 6 months, as well as 
pregnant women. Participants with stable HIV infection under treatment were not excluded. Licensed 
vaccines, excluding live vaccines, could be administered more than 14 days before or more than 
14 days after the vaccination in the study. Licensed live attenuated vaccines could be administered 
more than 28 days before or more than 28 days after the vaccination in the study.
A total of 44325 individuals were randomised in parallel in a 1:1 ratio to receive an intramuscular
injection of JCOVDEN or placebo. A total of 21895 adults received JCOVDEN and 21888 adults
received placebo. Participants were followed for a median follow-up of approximately 2 months after 
vaccination.
The primary efficacy analysis population of 39321 individuals included 38059 SARS-CoV-2 
seronegative individuals at baseline and 1262 individuals with an unknown serostatus.
Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among individuals who received JCOVDEN
and those who received placebo. In the primary efficacy analysis population, among the individuals 
who received JCOVDEN, the median age was 52.0 years (range: 18 to 100 years); 79.7% (N=15646) 
of individuals were 18 to 64 years old [with 20.3% (N=3984) aged 65 or older and 3.8% (N=755)
aged 75 or older]; 44.3% of individuals were female; 46.8% were from Northern America (United 
States), 40.6% were from Latin America and 12.6% were from Southern Africa (South Africa). A total 
of 7830 (39.9%) individuals had at least one pre-existing comorbidity associated with increased risk of 
progression to severe COVID-19 at baseline. Comorbidities included: obesity defined as BMI 
≥ 30 kg/m2 (27.5%), hypertension (10.3%), type 2 diabetes (7.2%), stable/well-controlled HIV 
infection (2.5%), serious heart conditions (2.4%) and asthma (1.3%). Other comorbidities were present 
in ≤ 1% of the individuals.
COVID-19 cases were confirmed by a central laboratory based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA 
result using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test. Vaccine efficacy overall and by key age 
groups are presented in Table 2.

Per-protocol efficacy population
Beyond 14 days after vaccination, 18 vs. 74 cases of molecularly confirmed COVID-19 were 
hospitalised, respectively in the JCOVDEN vs. placebo group, resulting in 76.1% (adjusted 95% CI: 
56.9; 87.7) vaccine efficacy. A total of 5 cases in the JCOVDEN group vs. 17 cases in the placebo 
group required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and 4 vs. 8 cases in the JCOVDEN and placebo 
group respectively required mechanical ventilation.

Efficacy of two-doses of JCOVDEN administered 2 months apart
A final analysis (cut-off date 25 June 2021) of a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled Phase 3 study (COV3009) was conducted in North and Latin America, Africa, Europe and 
Asia to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of 2 doses of JCOVDEN administered with a 
56-day interval. The study excluded individuals with abnormal function of the immune system 
resulting from a clinical condition, individuals who were under immunosuppressive therapies within 
6 months, as well as pregnant women. Participants with stable HIV infection under treatment were not 
excluded. Licensed vaccines, excluding live vaccines, could be administered more than 14 days before 
or more than 14 days after the vaccination in the study. Licensed live attenuated vaccines could be 
administered more than 28 days before or more than 28 days after the vaccination in the study.
A total of 31300 individuals were randomised in the double-blind phase of the study. In total, 14492 
(46.3%) individuals were included in the per-protocol efficacy population (7484 individuals received 
JCOVDEN and 7008 individuals received placebo). Participants were followed for a median of 
36 days (range: 0-172 days) after vaccination.
Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among individuals who received at least two 
doses of JCOVDEN and those who received placebo. In the primary efficacy analysis population, 
among the individuals who received 2 doses of JCOVDEN, the median age was 50.0 years (range: 18 
to 99 years); 87.0% (N=6512) of individuals were 18 to 64 years old [with 13.0% (N=972) aged 65 or 
older and 1.9% (N=144) aged 75 or older]; 45.4% of individuals were female; 37.5% were from North 
America (United States), 51.0% were from Europe (including UK), 5.4% were from South Africa, 
1.9% from Philippines and 4.2% from Latin America. A total of 2747 (36.7%) individuals had at least 
one pre-existing comorbidity associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 at 
baseline. Comorbidities included: obesity defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 (24.6%), hypertension (8.9%), 
sleep apnea (6.7%), type 2 diabetes (5.2%), serious heart conditions (3.6%), asthma (1.7%) and 
stable/well-controlled HIV infection (1.3%). Other comorbidities were present in ≤ 1% of the 
individuals.

d Confidence intervals were adjusted to implement type I error control for multiple testing.
e Of the 8 participants with severe disease, 1 was admitted to an intensive care unit.
Final analysis results of variants with sufficient cases available for meaningful interpretations (Alpha 
[B.1.1.7] and Mu [B.1.621]) show that, after the first dose of JCOVDEN, efficacy 14 days post-dose 1 
(Day 15-Day 56) for these 2 variants was 73.2% [95% CI: 48.4; 87.1] and 38.6% [95% CI: -43.9; 
75.1], respectively. After the second dose (≥71 days), efficacy for Alpha and Mu was 83.7% [95% CI: 
43.8; 97.0] and 53.9% [95% CI: -48.0; 87.6], respectively. There were only 7 Delta cases (4 and 3 
Delta cases in the JCOVDEN group and placebo group, respectively). There were no reference strain 
13
cases in either the JCOVDEN or placebo group in the follow-up 14 days after the booster dose
(≥71 days).
Vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic infections at least 14 days after second vaccination was 34.2% 
(95% CI: -6.4; 59.8).
Immunogenicity of a booster dose (second dose) following primary vaccination with JCOVDEN
It should be noted that there is no established immune correlate of protection. In a Phase 2 Study 
(COV2001), individuals 18 through 55 years of age and 65 years and older received a booster dose of 
JCOVDEN approximately 2 months after the primary vaccination. Immunogenicity was assessed by 
measuring neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Victoria/1/2020 strain using a qualified wild-type 
virus neutralisation assay (wtVNA). Immunogenicity data are available from 39 individuals, of whom 
15 were 65 years of age and older, and are summarised in Table 7.

Neutralising antibody (wtVNA) and S-binding antibody (enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay) increases against the reference SARS-CoV-2 strain were also observed in studies COV1001,
COV1002 and COV2001 in a limited number of study participants after a boost given at 2, 3 and 
6 months, when compared to pre-boost values. Overall, the increases of geometric mean titres (GMTs)
pre-boost to 1 month post-boost ranged from 1.5 to 4.4 fold for neutralising antibodies, and from 2.5 
to 5.8 fold for binding antibodies. A 2-fold decrease in antibody levels was observed 4 months 
following 2-month booster dose, compared to 1 month following 2-month booster dose. Antibody
levels were still higher than antibody levels following a single-dose at a similar timepoint. These data 
support the administration of a booster dose when administered at an interval of 2 months or longer 
after primary vaccination.
Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine
COV-BOOST study is a multicentre, randomised Phase 2 investigator-initiated study (NCT73765130) 
conducted in the United Kingdom, to evaluate a booster vaccination against COVID-19. Participants 
were adults aged 30 years or older. A cohort of participants received two doses of Comirnaty (N=89), 
followed by a booster dose of JCOVDEN. The median interval (IQR) was 106 (91-144) days between 
the second and booster dose. JCOVDEN boosted binding (N=88), pseudovirus neutralising (N=77) 
and wild type neutralising antibody responses (N=21) against the reference strain, as observed at Day 
28. At Day 84 post-boost, GMTs were still higher than pre-boost values. Furthermore, JCOVDEN
boosted pseudovirus neutralising antibody responses against the Delta variant assessed at Day 28 
(N=89).
14
DMID 21-0012, an independent Phase 1/2 open-label clinical study (NCT04889209) conducted in the 
United States evaluated a heterologous booster dose of JCOVDEN. Due to the limited sample size, 
differences observed are only descriptive. A booster dose of JCOVDEN was administered to adults 
who had completed primary vaccination with a Spikevax 2-dose series or a Comirnaty 2-dose series at 
least 12 weeks prior to enrolment (mean interval [range] of 20 [13-26] and 21 [12-41] weeks for 
Spikevax and Comirnaty, respectively) and who reported no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
JCOVDEN boosted binding and pseudovirus neutralising antibody responses against the reference 
strain and the Delta variant in individuals primed with Spikevax 2-dose series (N=49) or Comirnaty 2-
dose series (N=50), as observed at Day 15 post-boost. JCOVDEN boosted pseudovirus neutralising 
antibody responses against the Omicron BA.1 variant in individuals primed with Comirnaty 2-dose 
series (N=50), as observed at Day 29.
Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with an adenoviral vector-based
COVID-19 vaccine
COV-BOOST study (see study design above) also evaluated a booster dose of JCOVDEN in 
participants who had received 2 doses of Vaxzevria (N=101). The median interval (IQR) was 77 (72-
83) days between the second and booster dose. JCOVDEN boosted binding (N=94), pseudovirus 
neutralising (N=94) and wild type neutralising antibody responses (N=21) against the reference strain. 
At Day 84 post-boost, GMTs were still higher than pre-boost values. Furthermore, JCOVDEN boosted 
pseudovirus neutralising antibody responses against the Delta variant assessed at Day 28 (N=90).
Descriptive data from the COV-BOOST study and DMID 21-0012 study indicate that boosting with 
JCOVDEN after primary vaccination with an adenoviral vector-based vaccine induces lower antibody 
responses compared to heterologous boosting with a licensed mRNA vaccine after primary 
vaccination with an adenoviral vector-based vaccine. The studies also indicate that neutralising 
antibody titres reached at 1 month post-boost with JCOVDEN after primary vaccination with an 
mRNA vaccine are comparable to after a homologous boost with an mRNA vaccine.
Elderly population
JCOVDEN was assessed in individuals 18 years of age and older. The efficacy of JCOVDEN was 
consistent between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger individuals (18-64 years).
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
JCOVDEN in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Not applicable.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of repeat-dose 
toxicity and local tolerance, and reproductive and developmental toxicity.
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity
JCOVDEN has not been evaluated for its genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. The components of the 
vaccine are not expected to have genotoxic or carcinogenic potential.
15
Reproductive toxicity and fertility
Female reproductive toxicity and fertility were assessed in a combined embryo-foetal and pre- and 
post-natal development study in the rabbit. In this study a first vaccination of JCOVDEN was 
administered intramuscularly to female rabbits 7 days prior to mating, at a dose equivalent to 2-fold 
above the recommended human dose, followed by two vaccinations at the same dose during the 
gestation period (i.e., at gestational days 6 and 20). There were no vaccine-related effects on female 
fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. The parental females as well as their 
foetuses and offspring exhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific antibody titres, indicating that 
maternal antibodies were transferred to the foetuses during gestation. No JCOVDEN data are available 
on vaccine excretion in milk.
In addition, a conventional (repeat-dose) toxicity study in rabbits with JCOVDEN did not reveal any 
effects on male sex organs that would impair male fertility.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What JCOVDEN is and what it is used for
JCOVDEN is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
JCOVDEN is given to adults aged 18 years and older.
The vaccine causes the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and 
specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.
None of the ingredients in this vaccine can cause COVID-19.
2. What you need to know before you are given JCOVDEN
Do not have the vaccine if

You are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in 
section 6).
You have had a blood clot occurring at the same time as having low levels of blood platelets 
(thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, TTS) after receiving any COVID-19 vaccine.
You have a previous diagnosis of capillary leak syndrome, (a condition causing fluid leakage 
from small blood vessels).


Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given JCOVDEN if:



you have ever had a severe allergic reaction after injection of any other vaccine,
you have ever fainted following any needle injection,
you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). However, you can have your 
vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold,
you have a problem with bleeding or bruising, or if you are taking an anticoagulant medicine (to 
prevent blood clots),

32


your immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you are taking medicines 
that weaken the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or 
cancer medicines),
you have risk factors for blood clots in your veins (venous thromboembolism (VTE)).
As with any vaccine, vaccination with JCOVDEN may not fully protect all those who receive it. It is 
not known how long you will be protected.



Blood disorders

Venous thromboembolism: Blood clots in veins (venous thromboembolism (VTE)) have been 
observed rarely following vaccination with JCOVDEN.
Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome: A combination of blood clots and low levels of 
‘platelets’ in the blood has been observed very rarely following vaccination with JCOVDEN. 
This includes severe cases with blood clots, including in unusual locations, such as the brain, 
liver, bowel and spleen in some cases in combination with bleeding. These cases mostly 
occurred within the first three weeks following vaccination and in individuals below 60 years of 
age. Fatal outcome has been reported.
Immune thrombocytopenia: Very low levels of blood platelets (immune thrombocytopenia), 
that can be associated with bleeding, have been reported very rarely, usually within the first four 
weeks following vaccination with JCOVDEN.
Seek immediate medical attention, if you experience symptoms that may be signs of blood disorders: 
severe or persistent headaches, seizures (fits), mental status changes or blurred vision, unexplained 
bleeding, unexplained skin bruising beyond the site of vaccination which appear a few days after 
vaccination, pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination, develop shortness of breath, chest 
pain, leg pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain. Inform your healthcare provider that you 
have recently received JCOVDEN.
Capillary leak syndrome
Very rare cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) have been reported following vaccination with 
JCOVDEN. At least one affected patient had a previous diagnosis of CLS. CLS is a serious, 
potentially fatal condition causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels (capillaries) resulting in 
rapid swelling of the arms and legs, sudden weight gain and feeling faint (low blood pressure). Seek 
immediate medical attention if you develop these symptoms in the days following vaccination.
Neurological disorders

Guillain-Barré syndrome
Seek immediate medical attention if you develop weakness and paralysis in the extremities that 
can progress to the chest and face (Guillain-Barré syndrome, GBS). This has been reported very 
rarely after vaccination with JCOVDEN.
Inflammation of the spinal cord (transverse myelitis)
Seek immediate medical attention if you develop weakness in the arms or legs, sensory 
symptoms (such as tingling, numbness, pain or loss of pain sensation) or problems with bladder 
or bowel function. This has been reported very rarely after vaccination with JCOVDEN.
Myocarditis and pericarditis
There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with JCOVDEN (see section 4). These 
conditions have occurred more often in males less than 40 years of age. In most of these people, 
symptoms began within 14 days following vaccination. You should seek medical attention right away 
if you have any of the following symptoms after receiving the vaccine: chest pain; shortness of breath; 
feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart.
Risk of severe adverse events after a booster dose
The risk of severe adverse events (such as blood disorders including thrombosis with 
thrombocytopenia syndrome, CLS, GBS, myocarditis and pericarditis) after a booster dose of 
JCOVDEN is unknown.
33
Children and adolescents
JCOVDEN is not recommended for children aged below 18 years. Currently there is not enough 
information available on the use of JCOVDEN in children and adolescents younger than 18 years of 
age.
Other medicines and JCOVDEN
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines 
or vaccines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine.
Driving and using machines
Some of the side effects of JCOVDEN listed in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect 
your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or use 
machines.
JCOVDEN contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of 0.5 mL, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
JCOVDEN contains ethanol
This medicine contains 2 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each dose of 0.5 mL. The amount of ethanol in
this medicine is equivalent to less than 1 mL beer or wine. The small amount of alcohol in this 
medicine will not have any noticeable effects.
3.
How JCOVDEN is given
Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will inject the vaccine into the muscle - usually in the upper arm.
How much vaccine will you receive
A single-dose primary vaccination (0.5 mL) of JCOVDEN is injected.
A booster dose (second dose) of JCOVDEN may be given at least 2 months after the primary 
vaccination in individuals 18 years of age and older.
JCOVDEN may be administered as a single booster dose to eligible individuals 18 years of age and 
older who have completed primary vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or an adenoviral 
vector-based COVID-19 vaccine. The dosing interval for the booster dose is the same as that 
authorised for a booster dose of the vaccine used for primary vaccination.
After the injection your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will watch over you for around 15 minutes to 
monitor for signs of an allergic reaction.
If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
4.
Possible side effects
Like all vaccines, JCOVDEN can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most of the 
side effects occur in the 1 or 2 days of getting the vaccination.
34
Get medical attention immediately if within 3 weeks of vaccination you get any of the following 
symptoms:

experience severe or persistent headaches, blurred vision, mental status changes or seizures 
(fits);
develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, leg pain or persistent abdominal pain;
notice unusual skin bruising or pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:




As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be 
readily available in the event of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of 
JCOVDEN. Individuals should be monitored by a healthcare professional after vaccination for 
at least 15 minutes.
JCOVDEN must not be mixed with other medicinal products or diluted in the same syringe.
JCOVDEN must not be administered by intravascular, intravenous, subcutaneous or intradermal
injection under any circumstances.
Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid 
muscle of the upper arm.
39

Syncope (fainting) may occur with any injection, including JCOVDEN. Procedures should be in 
place to prevent injury from falling and to manage syncopal reactions.
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Instructions for administration and handling
This vaccine should be handled by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique to ensure the 
sterility of each dose.
Store and transport frozen at -25°C to -15°C. The expiry date for storage at -25°C to -15°C is printed 
on the vial and outer carton after “EXP”.
The vaccine comes ready to use once thawed. The vaccine may be supplied frozen at -25°C to -15°C 
or thawed at 2°C to 8°C.
When stored frozen at -25°C to -15°C, the vaccine can be thawed either at 2°C to 8°C or at room 
temperature:

at 2°C to 8°C: a carton of 10 or 20 vials will take approximately 13 hours to thaw, and a single 
vial will take approximately 2 hours to thaw.
at room temperature (maximally 25°C): a carton of 10 or 20 vials will take approximately 
4 hours to thaw, and a single vial will take approximately 1 hour to thaw.

Do not re-freeze vaccine once thawed.
The vaccine can also be stored in a refrigerator or transported at 2°C to 8°C for a single period of up to 
11 months, not exceeding the original expiry date (EXP). Upon moving the product to 2°C to 8°C 
storage, the updated expiry date must be written on the outer carton and the vaccine should be used or 
discarded by the updated expiry date. The original expiry date should be crossed out. The vaccine can 
also be transported at 2°C to 8°C as long as the appropriate storage conditions (temperature, time) are 
applied.
Keep the vials in the original carton in order to protect from light and to record the expiry for the 
different storage conditions, if applicable.
JCOVDEN is a colorless to slightly yellow, clear to very opalescent suspension (pH 6-6.4). The 
vaccine should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
The vial should be inspected visually for cracks or any abnormalities, such as evidence of tampering 
prior to administration. If any of these should exist, do not administer the vaccine.
Before administering a dose of vaccine, swirl the vial gently in an upright position for 10 seconds. Do 
not shake. Use a sterile needle and sterile syringe to extract a single-dose of 0.5 mL from the 
multi-dose vial and administer by intramuscular injection only into the deltoid muscle of the upper 
arm.
A maximum of 5 doses can be withdrawn from the multi-dose vial. Discard any remaining vaccine in 
the vial after 5 doses have been extracted.
After the first puncture of the vial the vaccine (vial) can be held at 2°C to 8°C for up to 6 hours or at 
room temperature (maximum 25°C) for a single period of up to 3 hours. Discard if vaccine is not used 
within this time. After the first puncture of the vial, record the date and time the vial should be 
discarded on each vial label.
40
Disposal

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Myelosuppression 
Profound myelosuppression with pancytopenia is the desired therapeutic effect of treosulfan-based 
conditioning treatment, occurring in all patients. It is therefore recommended to monitor blood cell 
counts frequently until recovery of the haematopoietic system.  
During phases of severe neutropenia (median duration of neutropenic period is 14–17.5 days in adults 
and 20-22 days in paediatric patients) the risk of infection is increased. Prophylactic or empiric 
anti-infective treatment (bacterial, viral, fungal) should therefore be considered. Growth factors 
(G-CSF, GM-CSF), platelet and/or red blood cell support should be given as indicated. 
Secondary malignancies 
Secondary malignancies are well-established complications in long-term survivors after alloHSCT. 
How much treosulfan contributes to their occurrence is unknown. The possible risk of a second 
malignancy should be explained to the patient. On the basis of human data, treosulfan has been 
classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a human carcinogen. 
Mucositis 
Oral mucositis (including high-grade severity) is a very common undesirable effect of 
treosulfan-based conditioning followed by alloHSCT (see section 4.8). Use of mucositis prophylaxis 
(e.g. topical antimicrobials, barrier protectants, ice and adequate oral hygiene) is recommended. 
Vaccines 
Concomitant use of live attenuated vaccines is not recommended. 
Fertility 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treosulfan can impair fertility. Therefore, men treated with treosulfan are advised not to father a child 
during and up to 6 months after treatment and to seek advice on cryo-conservation of sperm prior to 
treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with treosulfan. 
Ovarian suppression and amenorrhoea with menopausal symptoms commonly occur in 
pre-menopausal patients (see section 4.6). 
Paediatric population 
Seizures 
There have been isolated reports of seizures in infants (≤ 4 months of age) with primary 
immunodeficiencies after conditioning treatment with treosulfan in combination with fludarabine or 
cyclophosphamide. Therefore, infants ≤ 4 months of age should be monitored for signs of neurological 
adverse reactions. Although it cannot be proved that treosulfan was the cause, the use of clonazepam 
prophylaxis for children younger than 1 year might be considered. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
There was a significant association between age and respiratory toxicity in paediatric patients treated 
with treosulfan-based conditioning. 
Children younger than one year (mainly non-malignant diseases, especially immunodeficiencies) 
experienced more respiratory grade III/IV toxicity, possibly due to pulmonary infections already 
existing before the start of conditioning treatment. 
Dermatitis diaper 
Dermatitis diaper may occur in small children because of excretion of treosulfan in the urine. 
Therefore, nappies should be changed frequently up to 6–8 hours after each infusion of treosulfan.  
Extravasation 
Treosulfan is considered an irritant. Intravenous application should be performed using a safe 
technique. If extravasation is suspected, general safety measures should be implemented. No specific 
measure has been proven to be recommendable. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction of treosulfan was observed in high-dose chemotherapy. 
Detailed in vitro studies did not completely exclude potential interactions between high plasma 
concentrations of treosulfan and CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates. 
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling predicted a weak (AUC ratio ≥ 1.25 and < 2) to 
moderate (AUC ratio ≥ 2 and < 5) interaction for CYP3A4, a weak interaction for CYP2C19, and a 
negligible (AUC ratio < 1.25) interaction for P-gp. Therefore, medicinal products with a narrow 
therapeutic index (e.g. digoxin) that are substrates for CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 should not be given 
during treatment with treosulfan. 
Considering overall timing of treatments and the respective pharmacokinetic properties of 
concomitantly used medicinal products (e.g. half-life), the interaction potential can be reduced to “no 
interaction” (AUC ratio < 1.25), if all concomitantly used medicinal products are dosed 2 hours before 
or 8 hours after the 2-hour intravenous infusion of treosulfan. 
The effect of treosulfan on the pharmacokinetics of fludarabine is not known. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Both sexually active men and women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception 
during and up to 6 months after treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of treosulfan in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with 
respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Treosulfan is contraindicated during pregnancy (see 
section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether treosulfan is excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding should be discontinued 
during treatment with treosulfan. 
Fertility 
Treosulfan might impair fertility in men and women (see section 4.4). Men should seek advice on 
cryo-conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility.  
As known for other alkylating conditioning agents, treosulfan can cause ovarian suppression and 
amenorrhoea with menopausal symptoms in pre-menopausal women. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Treosulfan has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. It is likely that certain 
adverse reactions of treosulfan like nausea, vomiting or dizziness could affect these functions.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Profound myelosuppression/pancytopenia is the desired therapeutic effect of conditioning therapy and 
occurs in all patients. Blood cell counts usually recover after HSCT. 
The most commonly observed adverse reactions (adults/paediatric patients) after treosulfan-based 
conditioning followed by alloHSCT include overall infections (10.1%/11.6%), gastrointestinal 
disorders (nausea [38.0%/26.4%], stomatitis [36.4%/66.1%], vomiting [22.5%/42.1%], diarrhoea 
[14.4%/33.1%], abdominal pain [9.6%/17.4%]), fatigue (14.4%/1.7%), hepatotoxicity (0.3%/26.4%), 
febrile neutropenia (10.1%/1.7%), decreased appetite (8.0%/0.8%), maculopapular rash (5.2%/7.4%), 
pruritus (2.8%/10.7%), alopecia (1.5%/9.9%), pyrexia (4.1%/13.2%), oedema (6.2%/0.8%), rash 
(0.7%/5.8%), and increases of alanine transaminase (ALT [4.9%/10.7%]), aspartate transaminase 
(AST [4.1%/6.6%]), and bilirubin (17.1%/6.6%). 
Adults

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Overall infections 
The overall incidence of infections was 10.1% (62/613). This includes the incidence for bacterial, viral 
and fungal infections (50/613; 8.1%) and for overall sepsis (12/613; 2%). The most frequent type of 
infection was lung infection (10/62 [16.1%]). Pathogens included bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus, 
Enterococcus, Corynebacterium), viruses (e.g. cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]) as 
well as fungi (e.g. candida). Overall sepsis includes sepsis (9/613; 1.5%), staphylococcal sepsis 
(2/613; 0.3%) and enterococcal sepsis (1/613; 0.2%). The infection rate was lowest in patients treated 
with the dose regimen of 10 g/m² of treosulfan per day, from day -4 to -2 (8.1%). 
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) 
One of 613 adult patients (0.2%) developed a second malignancy (breast cancer). A few further cases 
of second malignancies after treosulfan-based conditioning have been reported by other investigators. 
After long-term therapy with conventional doses of oral treosulfan in patients with solid tumours acute 
myeloid leukaemia was observed in 1.4% of 553 patients. 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Blood disorders were observed in 62 of 613 adult patients (10.1%). The most frequent adverse reaction 
was febrile neutropenia (10.1%). The lowest incidence was noted with the dose regimen of 
10 g/m²/day, day -4 to -2 (4.4%). 
The median (25%/75% percentiles) duration of neutropenia was 14 (12, 20) days with the 10 g/m² 
treosulfan dose and 17.5 (14, 21) days with the 14 g/m² treosulfan dose. 
Cardiac disorders 
Cardiac disorders were observed in 21 patients (3.4%). The most frequent adverse reactions were 
cardiac arrhythmias, e.g. atrial fibrillation (1.0%), sinus tachycardia (0.8%), supraventricular 
tachycardia (0.3%), and ventricular extrasystole (0.3%). Isolated cases of cardiac arrest, cardiac 
failure, and myocardial infarction occurred. The lowest frequency of cardiac disorders was seen with 
the dose regimen of 10 g/m²/day, day -4 to -2 (2.6%). 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Gastrointestinal disorders were observed in 379 patients (61.8%). The most frequent adverse reactions 
reported were nausea (38.0%), stomatitis (36.4%), vomiting (22.5%), diarrhoea (14.4%), and 
abdominal pain (9.6%). The lowest frequencies of these adverse reactions were seen with the dose 
regimen of 10 g/m² per day, day -4 to -2 (21.5%, 32.2%, 14.8%, 5.9%, and 6.7% respectively). 
Hepatobiliary disorders 
The overall incidence of veno-occlusive liver disease (VOD) was 0.8% (5/613). VOD occurred only 
with the dose regimen of 14 g/m²/day treosulfan. None of these cases were fatal or life-threatening.

Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions reported in the table below are derived from two clinical trials (including a total 
of 121 patients; median age 7 years [range 0–17 years]) where treosulfan combined with fludarabine 
(and mostly with additional thiotepa) was administered as conditioning treatment prior to alloHSCT in 
paediatric patients with malignant or non-malignant diseases. Treosulfan was administered in a dose 
range of 10-14 g/m² BSA on three consecutive days. 
Adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency: very common (≥ 1/10), 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very 
rare (< 1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
group, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
The overall incidence of infections in 121 paediatric patients was 11.6% (14/121) and thus comparable 
to that seen in adults. The frequency was higher in the paediatric age group 12–17 years (6/39 
[15.4%]) compared to younger children (7/59 [11.9%]). 
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) 
One case of a second malignancy (myelodysplastic syndrome) was reported in a child about 12 months 
after treosulfan-based conditioning for sickle cell disease. 
Six cases of a second malignancy were reported by other investigators after treosulfan-based 
conditioning. Five paediatric patients received alloHSCT for primary immunodeficiencies, i.e. 
diseases with an increased risk for neoplasias per se. They developed myelodysplastic syndrome, acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia, and Ewing’s sarcoma. One patient with haemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis developed secondary juvenile chronic myeloid leukaemia. 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
The median (25%/75% percentiles) duration of neutropenia was 22 (17, 26) days in paediatric patients 
with malignant diseases and 20 (15, 25) days in patients with non-malignant disorders. 
Nervous system disorders 
Seizure in the context of an encephalitis infection was reported in one of 121 paediatric patients. A 
report from an investigator-initiated trial performed in children with primary immunodeficiencies lists 
five cases of seizures occurring after other treosulfan-based conditioning regimens (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The principal toxic effect of treosulfan is profound myeloablation and pancytopenia. In addition, 
acidosis, skin toxicity, nausea, vomiting and gastritis may occur. In the absence of haematopoietic 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
stem cell transplantation, the recommended dose of treosulfan would constitute an overdose. No 
specific antidote of treosulfan overdose is known. The haematologic status should be closely 
monitored and vigorous supportive measures instituted as medically indicated.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, alkylating agents, ATC code: L01AB02 
Mechanism of action 
Treosulfan is a pro-drug of a bifunctional alkylating agent with cytotoxic activity to haematopoietic 
precursor cells. The activity of treosulfan is due to the spontaneous conversion into a mono-epoxide 
intermediate and L-diepoxybutan (see section 5.2). 
The epoxides formed alkylate nucleophilic centres of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and are able to 
induce DNA cross-links which are considered responsible for the stem cell depleting and 
antineoplastic effects.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Treosulfan has a broad antineoplastic and antileukaemic activity. This was demonstrated against 
transplanted mouse and rat lymphomas/leukaemias, sarcomas and hepatomas, human tumour 
xenografts, human tumour biopsies and cell lines. 
The immunosuppressive effects of treosulfan are attributed to its toxicity against primitive and 
committed progenitor cells, T and NK cells, reduction of cellularity of primary and secondary 
lymphatic organs and a preclusive effect on the ‘cytokine storm’ that precedes the development of 
Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) and is involved in the pathogenesis of veno-occlusive disease. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In the pivotal phase III trial, adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS) and increased risk for standard conditioning therapies because of higher age 
(≥ 50 years) or comorbidities (haematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index [HCT-CI] score 
> 2) were randomised to receive a conditioning regimen with 3 × 10 g/m² treosulfan combined with 
fludarabine (FT10; n = 268) or a regimen of intravenous busulfan (total dose 6.4 mg/kg) combined with 
fludarabine (FB2; n = 283), followed by alloHSCT. 64% of patients had AML and 36% MDS. The 
median age of patients was 60 years (range 31–70 years); 25% of patients were older than 65 years. 
The primary endpoint of this study was event-free survival (EFS) after 2 years. Events were defined as 
relapse of disease, graft failure or death (whatever occurred first). Non-inferiority of FT10 versus the 
reference FB2 was statistically proven. The p-value of 0.0005787 indicates superiority of treosulfan 
compared to busulfan (Figure 1).

Analyses of EFS at 2 years for various pre-defined subgroups (donor type, risk group, disease, age 
group, HCT-CI score, remission status at study entry, and various combinations of these parameters) 
were always in favour of the treosulfan regimen (hazard ratio [HR] of FT10 vs. FB2 < 1), with only one 
exception (risk group II of matched related donor [MRD] patients; HR 1.18 [95% CI 0.61, 2.26]).

There is limited information available on treosulfan-based conditioning (FT14 regimen ± thiotepa; see 
section 4.2) in adult patients with non-malignant disorders (NMD). The main indications for an 
alloHSCT with treosulfan conditioning in adult NMD patients are haemoglobinopathies (e.g. sickle 
cell disease, thalassaemia major [TM]), primary immune deficiency, haemophagocytic disorder, 
immune dysregulatory disorder and bone marrow failure). 
In one study, 31 NMD patients were treated with the FT14 regimen plus anti-thymocyte globulin. The 
age of the patients ranged from 0.4 to 30.5 years, and 29% had HCT-CI scores > 2. All patients 
engrafted, with a median time to neutrophil engraftment of 21 (range, 12–46) days. The two-year 
projected overall survival was 90%. Complete disease responses were observed in 28 patients (90%), 
as measured by clinical symptoms and laboratory assays (Burroughs LM et al., Biology of Blood and 
Marrow Transplantation 2014; 20(12):1996-2003). 
An Italian group treated 60 TM patients (age range 1-37 years; including 12 adults) with the FT14 plus 
thiotepa regimen. All patients engrafted except one, who died on day +11; the median time to 
neutrophil and platelet recovery was 20 days. With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 4–73), 
the 5-year overall survival probability was 93% (95% CI 83–97%). No difference in terms of outcome 
was observed between children and adults (Bernardo ME et al.; Blood 2012; 120(2):473-6). 
A retrospective comparison of treosulfan-based (n = 16) versus busulfan-based (n = 81) conditioning 
in adult patients revealed quite comparable survival rates (70.3 ± 15.1% vs. 69.3 ± 5.5%), while risk 
for acute GvHD was lower in the treosulfan group (odds ratio 0.28; 95% CI 0.12–0.67; P = 0.004) 
(Caocci G et al.; American Journal of Hematology 2017; 92(12):1303-1310). 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy and safety of treosulfan-based conditioning was evaluated in 70 patients with acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), AML, MDS, or juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) who 
received a conditioning regimen with treosulfan and fludarabine with (n = 65) or without (n = 5) 
thiotepa. Treosulfan dose was adapted to the patient’s BSA and 10, 12, or 14 g/m² body surface area 
per day was administered as a two-hour intravenous infusion on day -6, -5, and -4 prior to stem cell 
infusion (day 0). A total of 37 patients (52.9%) were younger than 12 years. 
No patient experienced a primary graft failure but one patient with ALL experienced a secondary graft 
failure. The incidence of complete donor-type chimerism was 94.2% (90% CI 87.2–98.0%) at day +28 
visit, 91.3% (90% CI 83.6–96.1%) at day +100 visit and 91.2% (90% CI 82.4–96.5%) at month 12 
visit.  
The overall survival at 24 months was 85.7% (90% CI 77.1–91.2%). Overall, 12 of the 70 patients 
(17.1%) died, 8 patients because of relapse/progression and 4 patients transplant-related. Freedom 
from transplant-related mortality until day +100 after HSCT (primary endpoint) was 98.6% (90% CI 
93.4–99.9%). One transplant-/treatment-related death was noted until day +100 after HSCT. 
Transplant-related mortality at 24 months was 4.6% (90% CI 1.8–11.4%). Sixteen patients suffered 
from relapse/progression. The cumulative incidence of relapse/progression was 23.0% (90% CI 14.7–
31.3%) at month +24. 
The efficacy and safety of treosulfan/fludarabine ± thiotepa-based conditioning was further evaluated 
in 51 patients with non-malignant diseases (primary immunodeficiency, haemoglobinopathy, inborn 
error of metabolism and bone marrow failure syndromes). Treosulfan dose was adapted to the patient’s 
BSA and 10, 12, or 14 g/m² body surface area per day was administered as a two-hour intravenous 
infusion on day -6, -5, and -4 prior to stem cell infusion (day 0). The dosing scheme was adapted 
during the trial in terms of the BSA categories applied for the different doses, as a consequence 
2 patients received a higher dose compared to the initial dosing scheme. Fifty evaluable patients 
treated with the reference conditioning regimen busulfan/fludarabine ± thiotepa served as 
active-control group. Busulfan dose was adapted to the patient’s body weight and 3.2 to 4.8 mg/kg/day 
were administered on days -7, -6, -5, and -4. Most trial subjects (84% in both arms) received the 
intensified regimen with thiotepa given in 2 single doses of 5 mg/kg/body weight on day -2. Most 
patients were 28 days to 11 years of age (88.2% in the treosulfan arm and 80% in the busulfan arm). 
Alpha was not controlled for multiple testing in this trial. The incidence of freedom from 
transplantation (treatment)-related mortality until day +100 (primary endpoint) was 100.0% (90% CI 
94.3%–100.0%) in the treosulfan arm and 90.0% (90% CI 80.1%–96.0%) in the busulfan arm. Overall 
survival at 1 year was 96.1% (90% CI 88.0%–98.8%) with treosulfan and 88.0% with busulfan 
(90% CI 77.9%–93.7%). In total, 2 patients (3.9%) in the treosulfan arm and 2 patients (4.0%) in the 
busulfan arm experienced primary graft failure, while secondary graft failures were reported for 
9 patients (18.4%) receiving treosulfan-based conditioning. The incidence of complete donor type 
chimerism was comparable between the groups. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Treosulfan is a pro-drug that is spontaneously converted under physiological conditions (pH 7.4; 
37 °C) into a monoepoxide intermediate and L-diepoxybutane with a half-life of 2.2 hours. 
Absorption 
After intravenous administration, peak plasma levels are reached at the end of the infusion time. 
Maximum plasma levels (mean ± SD) in adult patients after a 2-hour intravenous infusion of 10, 12, or 
14 g/m² treosulfan were 306 ± 94 µg/mL, 461 ± 102 µg/mL, and 494 ± 126 µg/mL, respectively. 
Distribution 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treosulfan is rapidly distributed in the body; however, its penetration through the blood-brain barrier 
is quite limited (see section 5.3). The volume of distribution in adult patients is about 20–30 litres. No 
dose accumulation with the recommended daily treatment on three consecutive days was observed. 
Treosulfan does not bind to plasma proteins. 
Biotransformation 
Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, temperature 37 °C), the pharmacologically inactive treosulfan 
is converted spontaneously (non-enzymatically) into the active monoepoxide intermediate 
(S,S-EBDM = (2S,3S)-1,2-epoxybutane-3,4-diol-4-methanesulfonate) and finally to L-diepoxibutane 
(S,S-DEB = (2S,3S)-1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane). 
Treosulfan does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 using testosterone as 
substrate. However, using midazolam as the substrate, treosulfan was a reversible inhibitor for 
CYP2C19 and 3A4. Treosulfan does not inhibit substrate transport via various transport proteins with 
the exception of P-gp and MATE2 at very high concentrations.  
Elimination 
Plasma concentrations of treosulfan decline exponentially and are best described by a first order 
elimination process fitted by a two-compartment model.  
The terminal half-life (T1/2ß) of intravenously administered treosulfan (up to 47 g/m²) is approximately 
2 hours. Approximately 25–40% of the treosulfan dose is excreted unchanged with the urine within 
24 hours, nearly 90% of which within the first 6 hours after administration. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Regression analysis of the area under the curve (AUC0-∞) versus treosulfan dose indicated a linear 
correlation. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No pharmacokinetic studies with treosulfan were done in patients with severe renal or hepatic 
impairment, because such patients are generally excluded from alloHSCT. About 25–40% of 
treosulfan is excreted in urine; however, an influence of renal function on renal clearance of treosulfan 
was not observed. 
Paediatric population 
Conventional dose calculation simply based on BSA results in a significantly higher exposure (AUC) 
of smaller children and infants with low BSA compared to adolescents or adults. Therefore, dosing of 
treosulfan in paediatric patients should be adapted to the BSA (see section 4.2), which results in a 
comparable treosulfan exposure in children of all age groups, corresponding to an exposure of a 
3 x 14 g/m² dose in adults. 
Mean apparent terminal half-life of treosulfan was comparable between the different age groups and 
ranged between 1.3 and 1.6 hours. 
PK/PD evaluation did not show a significant change of time to engraftment as function of AUC. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Four-week subchronic, intravenous treatment of rats resulted in haematological changes in form of 
decreased levels of leucocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes; decreased relative spleen and thymus 
weights in the context of a lymphoid atrophy, and bone marrow depression. Lymphohistiocytic 
infiltration in the skeletal musculature and histopathological changes in the urinary bladder were 
observed. Signs of haematuria were seen preferentially in male animals. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to its alkylating mechanism of action treosulfan is characterised as a genotoxic compound with 
carcinogenic potential. Specific reproductive and developmental toxicity studies on treosulfan in 
animals were not conducted. However, during chronic toxicity tests in rats spermatogenesis and 
ovarian function were significantly affected. Published literature data report on gonadotoxicity of 
treosulfan in pre-pubertal and pubertal male and female mice.  
Published data concerning treatment of mice and rats with L-diepoxibutane (the alkylating 
transformation product of treosulfan) revealed impairment of fertility, uterine-ovarian and sperm 
development. 
Juvenile animal studies 
In juvenile rat toxicity studies treosulfan induced slight retardation of physical development and a 
slightly delayed time-point of vaginal opening in females. A very low penetration of blood-brain 
barrier by treosulfan was observed in rats. The treosulfan concentrations in brain tissue were 95%–
98% lower than in plasma. However, an approximately 3-fold higher exposure in brain tissue of 
juvenile rats in comparison to young adults was found.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
As with all cytotoxic substances, appropriate precautions should be taken when handling treosulfan. 
Trained personnel should reconstitute the medicinal product. When handling treosulfan, inhalation, 
skin contact or contact with mucous membranes should be avoided (the use of adequate protective 
disposable gloves, goggles, gown and mask is recommended). Contaminated body parts should be 
carefully rinsed with water and soap, the eyes should be rinsed with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution. If possible it is recommended to work on a special safety workbench, equipped with laminar 
flow, with liquid-impermeable, absorbent disposable foil. Adequate care and precautions should be 
taken in the disposal of items (syringes, needles, etc.) used to reconstitute cytotoxic medicinal 
products. Use Luer-lock fittings on all syringes and sets. Large bore needles are recommended to 
minimise pressure and the possible formation of aerosols. The latter may also be reduced by the use of 
a venting needle.  
Pregnant personnel should be excluded from handling cytotoxics. 
Instructions for reconstitution of treosulfan: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Treosulfan is reconstituted in its original glass container. Reconstituted solutions of treosulfan 
may be combined into a larger glass vial, PVC bag or PE bag. 
To avoid solubility problems, warm the solvent, sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution, 
to 25 °C–30 °C (not higher), for example by using a water bath. 
Remove the treosulfan powder carefully from the inner surface of the vial by shaking. This 
procedure is very important, because moistening of powder that sticks to the surface results in 
caking. If this happens, vigorously shake the vial to redissolve the cake. 
Reconstitute each vial of Trecondi containing 1 g treosulfan in 20 mL of pre-warmed 
(maximum 30 °C) sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution by shaking. 
Reconstitute each vial of Trecondi containing 5 g treosulfan in 100 mL of pre-warmed 
(maximum 30 °C) sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution by shaking. 
For preparation of sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution equivalent volumes of sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution and water for injections can be mixed. 
The reconstituted solution contains 50 mg treosulfan per mL and appears as a clear colourless solution. 
Solutions showing any sign of precipitation should not be used. 
Treosulfan has mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. Remnants of the medicinal product, as well as 
all materials that have been used for reconstitution and administration must be destroyed according to 
standard procedures applicable to antineoplastic agents, with due regard to current laws related to the 
disposal of hazardous waste.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Trecondi is and what it is used for 
Trecondi contains the active substance treosulfan, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
alkylating agents. Treosulfan is used to prepare patients for bone marrow transplant (haematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation). Treosulfan destroys the bone marrow cells and enables the transplant of new 
bone marrow cells which leads to the production of healthy blood cells. 
Trecondi is used as a treatment before blood stem cell transplantation in adults and in adolescents 
and children older than one month with cancer and non-cancerous disorders.  
2.  What you need to know before you are given Trecondi  
Trecondi must not be given to you 
 
 
 
 
if you are allergic to treosulfan, 
if you suffer from an active uncontrolled infection, 
if you suffer from severe heart, lung, liver or kidney diseases, 
if you suffer from hereditary DNA repair disorder, a condition that reduces the ability to repair 
DNA (which carries your genetic information), 
if you are pregnant, or think you may be pregnant. 
 
Warnings and precautions  
Trecondi is a cell-killing (cytotoxic) medicine that is used to decrease the number of blood cells. At 
the recommended dose, this is the desired effect. You will have regular blood tests during treatment to 
check your blood cell counts do not fall too low. 
In order to prevent and treat infections, you will be given medicines, such as antibiotics, antifungals or 
antivirals. 
Trecondi may increase the risk of having another cancer in the future. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since inflammation of the oral mucosa is a common side effect of this medicine, you should pay 
attention to adequate oral hygiene. Preventive measures such as the use of mouthwashes (e.g. with 
barrier protectants, antimicrobials) or application of ice within the oral cavity (lessens blood flow to 
the oral mucosa and reduces the amount of treosulfan reaching the cell) is recommended.  
You must not receive live vaccines during treatment with treosulfan. 
Trecondi may cause symptoms of the menopause (absence of menstrual periods).  
Children and adolescents 
Fits (seizures) may occur very rarely in infants of less than 4 months of age. Children younger than 
1 year may have more severe side effects that affect breathing than older ones. Your child will be 
monitored for signs of side effects affecting nerves and breathing problems.  
Nappy rash with sores of the area around the anus (perianal) may occur in infants, toddlers and 
children wearing nappies because treosulfan passed out in the urine can damage the skin. Therefore, 
nappies should be changed frequently during 6–8 hours after each dose of this medicine.  
There is not sufficient information on the use of treosulfan in children aged less than 1 month. 
Other medicines and Trecondi 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You must not get pregnant during treatment with this medicine and up to 6 months after treatment. 
Use an effective method of contraception when either you or your partner is receiving this medicine. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you receive this medicine. 
You should stop breast-feeding before starting treatment with this medicine. 
If you are a man treated with this medicine, you should not father a child during and up to 6 months 
after treatment.  
This medicine may make you infertile and it may not be possible for you to get pregnant after 
treatment with it. If you are concerned about having children, you should discuss this with your doctor 
before treatment. Men should seek advice about the possibility of sperm preservation before starting 
therapy. 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine can cause nausea, vomiting and dizziness which may reduce your ability to drive or use 
machines. If you are affected, do not drive or use machines. 
3. 
How to use Trecondi

Other sources of information 
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu. There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
As with all cytotoxic substances, appropriate precautions should be taken when handling treosulfan. 
Trained personnel should reconstitute the medicinal product. When handling treosulfan, inhalation, 
skin contact or contact with mucous membranes should be avoided (the use of adequate protective 
disposable gloves, goggles, gown and mask is recommended). Contaminated body parts should be 
carefully rinsed with water and soap, the eyes should be rinsed with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution. If possible it is recommended to work on a special safety workbench, equipped with laminar 
flow, with liquid-impermeable, absorbent disposable foil. Adequate care and precautions should be 
taken in the disposal of items (syringes, needles, etc.) used to reconstitute cytotoxic medicinal 
products. Use Luer-lock fittings on all syringes and sets. Large bore needles are recommended to 
minimise pressure and the possible formation of aerosols. The latter may also be reduced by the use of 
a venting needle.  
Pregnant personnel should be excluded from handling cytotoxics.

Instructions for reconstitution of treosulfan: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Treosulfan is reconstituted in its original glass container. Reconstituted solutions of treosulfan 
may be combined into a larger glass vial, PVC bag or PE bag. 
To avoid solubility problems, warm the solvent, sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution, 
to 25 °C–30 °C (not higher), for example by using a water bath. 
Remove the treosulfan powder carefully from the inner surface of the vial by shaking. This 
procedure is very important, because moistening of powder that sticks to the surface results in 
caking. If this happens, vigorously shake the vial to redissolve the cake. 
Reconstitute each vial of Trecondi containing 1 g treosulfan in 20 mL of pre-warmed 
(maximum 30 °C) sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution by shaking. 
Reconstitute each vial of Trecondi containing 5 g treosulfan in 100 mL of pre-warmed 
(maximum 30 °C) sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution by shaking. 
For preparation of sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution equivalent volumes of sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution and water for injections can be mixed. 
Reconstituted solution for infusion 
The reconstituted solution contains 50 mg treosulfan per mL and appears as a clear colourless solution.  
Solutions showing any sign of precipitation should not be used. 
After reconstitution with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution, chemical and physical stability 
has been demonstrated for 3 days at 25 °C. 
From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstitution precludes the risk of 
microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use 
storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.  
Do not store the reconstituted solution in a refrigerator (2 °C–8 °C) as this might cause precipitation. 
Treosulfan has mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. Remnants of the medicinal product, as well as 
all materials that have been used for reconstitution and administration must be destroyed according to 
standard procedures applicable to antineoplastic agents, with due regard to current laws related to the 
disposal of hazardous waste.

In section 4.2, posology recommendations have been 
5.2 of the SmPC in order to change posology 
recommendations and update safety, efficacy and 
pharmacokinetic information in children and 
adolescents (2-17 years) following 
EMEA/H/C/0885/P46/025 and based on final results 
from study P089MK8616. This is a Phase 4 Double-
Blinded, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled 
Clinical Trial to Study the Efficacy, Safety and 
Pharmacokinetics of Sugammadex (MK-8616) for 
Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade in Pediatric 
Participants. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement some minor editorial 
changes throughout the Product Information (section 
4.4 of Annex I and Annex II). The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance and the MAH took the 
updated for routine reversal of reversal of rocuronium in 
children and adolescents (2 to 17 years of age). Section 4.8 
has been updated to inform that in studies of paediatric 
patients 2 to 17 years of age, the safety profile of 
sugammadex (up to 4 mg/kg) was generally similar to the 
profile observed in adults. Section 5.1 has been updated to 
provide new efficacy data from a trial investigating 
sugammadex versus neostigmine as a reversal agent for 
neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or 
vecuronium in in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years of 
age). In section 5.2, pharmacokinetic parameters stratified

Morbidly obese patients 
In one dedicated clinical trial in morbidly obese patients, 
the adverse reaction profile was generally similar to the 
profile in adult patients in pooled Phase 1 to 3 studies (see 
Table 2). 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC was updated as follows: 
Morbidly obese patients: 
A trial of 188 patients who were diagnosed as morbidly 
obese investigated the time to recovery from moderate or 
deep neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or 
vecuronium. Patients received 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg 
sugammadex, as appropriate for level of block, dosed 
according to either actual body weight or ideal body weight 
in random, double-blinded fashion. Pooled across depth of 
block and neuromuscular blocking agent, the median time 
to recover to a train-of-four (TOF) ratio ≥ 0.9 in patients 
dosed by actual body weight (1.8 minutes) was statistically 
significantly faster (p < 0.0001) compared to patients 
dosed by ideal body weight (3.3 minutes). 
Section 5.2 of the SmPC was updated as follows: 
Obesity: 
In one clinical study in morbidly obese patients, 
sugammadex 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg was dosed according to 
Page 5/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
actual body weight (n=76) or ideal body weight (n=74). 
Sugammadex exposure increased in a dose-dependent, 
linear manner following administration according to actual 
body weight or ideal body weight. No clinically relevant 
differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed 
between morbidly obese patients and the general 
population.

neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or 
vecuronium remains favourable and therefore 
recommended the renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
The product information was updated to include 
bronchospasm and pulmonary obstructive events as 
possible manifestations of hypersensitivity reactions, in line

time-points after administration of sugammadex to reverse 
the initial neuromuscular blockade. In addition, modelling 
analyses were included on re-administration of rocuronium 
to support the proposed waiting time in subjects with and 
without renal impairment. The CHMP considered that the 
data presented by the MAH were of clinical relevance to the 
anaesthetists and provided sufficient evidence to be

Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC in order to add information on severe renal 
impairment based on clinical trial data. Update of 
section 5.2 of the SmPC based on a fulfilled FUM 002 
in order to reflect PK-PD modelling, providing further 
relevant information on severe renal impairment.  
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add 
information on hypersensitivity based on clinical trial 
data. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.  
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC to add 
information on haemostasis based on a fulfilled FUM 
005. Furthermore, the Product Information is being 
brought in line with the QRD template version 7.3, 
integrating data on fertility assessed in the context of 
the initial MAA in section 4.6 of the SmPC.   
The MAH also took the opportunity to remove 
reference to the version of the DDPS from the Annex 
II, to update the RMP version identifier and to make 
minor typographical corrections throughout the 
Product Information.

renal impairment, including data on dialysability of 
sugammadex. The CHMP considered the increased 
exposure to sugammadex, modestly longer recovery from 
neuromuscular blockade relative to patients without severe 
renal impairment and the safety information available and 
concluded that benefit-risk balance in patients with severe 
renal impairment remains unfavourable. This position also 
applies to patients with severe renal impairment requiring 
dialysis and this was specifically reflected in the Product 
Information. Based on the dialysability data, the CHMP 
considered that removal of sugammadex by dialysis would 
be feasible, but highlighted the variability of the data. In 
general, high flux dialysis showed better results than low 
flux dialysis and the CHMP concluded that results with high 
flux dialysis are of relevance to the prescriber in the 
context of overdose. 
Hypersensitivity was already listed in the Product 
Information. Based on data from a new clinical trial in 
healthy volunteers, the CHMP agreed that a subparagraph 
on hypersensitivity in healthy volunteers should be added, 
including frequencies of hypersensitivity reactions reported 
and reflecting the dose-dependent trend observed.  
The MAH proposed that the text regarding aPTT and PT 
prolongation be adapted to more accurately reflect the 
supporting data, with conclusions based upon maximum

mean changes. The CHMP was of the view that the 
respective update of the Product Information was 
supported by the data available.  
Non-clinical data on fertility were evaluated as part of the 
initial MAA and the subheading “Fertility” was now included 
in the Product Information to follow the QRD template 
version 7.3. The following text was added into section 4.6 
of the SmPC: 
“The effects with sugammadex on human fertility have not 
been investigated. Animal studies to evaluate fertility do 
not reveal harmful effects.”

that were previously not listed.  
The MAH also updated the Risk Management Plan with the 
current post-marketing data on anaphylaxis and upgraded 
hypersensitivity from a potential to an identified risk; 
subsequently, Annex II was updated with respect to the 
new version identifier of the latest Risk Management Plan.

originated from a clinical trial requested by the CHMP at the 
time of granting the marketing authorisation, from further 
in vitro studies and experiments and from two analyses of 
bleeding complications in clinical studies with sugammadex. 
The CHMP concluded that the evidence currently available 
indicates an effect of sugammadex on hemostasis 
parameters. The MAH agreed with the CHMP on a more 
specific wording in the product information identifying 
situations of increased bleeding risks where caution should 
be exercised. Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC were updated 
to reflect these findings and the Package Leaflet was 
amended accordingly.  
Further to their assessment, the CHMP also requested that 
the overall effect on blood coagulation of sugammadex co-
administered with acetylsalicylic acid should be studied with 
up-to-date methods and the results should be provided for 
evaluation.

designed to investigate the potential of diclofenac and 
flucloxacillin to displace rocuronium or vecuronium from the 
complex with sugammadex. 
The data provided by the MAH revealed no re-occurrence of 
the neuromuscular blockade through displacement and, 
following CHMP assessment, the MAH was requested to 
update the product information accordingly.  
In addition to the interaction study results, the MAH also 
provided data pooled from several clinical trials looking at 
the re-occurrence of the neuro-muscular blockade after 
sugammadex reversal in the peri-operative setting with 
administration of various drugs. No interaction issues were 
identified, which was in line with the MAH interaction 
strategy (based on affinity constants determined) and no 
update to the product information was warranted. 
Additional information regarding fusidic acid use in the 
post-operative phase (i.e. that neuro-muscular blockade 
re-occurrence is not expected) was accepted by the CHMP 
as justified by the pharmacokinetic data available.

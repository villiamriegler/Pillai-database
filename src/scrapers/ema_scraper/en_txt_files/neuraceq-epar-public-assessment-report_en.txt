1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  Piramal  Imaging  GmbH  submitted  on  7  January  2013  an  application  for  Marketing 
Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  for  Neuraceq,  through  the  centralised 
procedure  under  Article  3  (2)  (a)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  eligibility  to  the  centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 14 April 2011.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
Neuraceq  is  indicated  for  the  detection  of  β-amyloid  in  the  brain,  thereby  assisting  in  the  differential 
diagnosis  in  adult  patients  who  are  being  evaluated  for  Alzheimer’s  disease  and  other  causes  of 
cognitive decline.” 
The  legal  basis  for  this  application  refers  to  Article  8.3  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  -  complete  and 
independent  application.  The  applicant  indicated  that  florbetaben (18F)  was  considered  to  be  a  new 
active substance. 
The  application  submitted  is  composed  of  administrative  information,  complete  quality  data,  non-
clinical  and  clinical  data  based  on  applicants’  own  tests  and  studies  and/or  bibliographic  literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision

2.2.2. Active  substance 
The 
chemical 
name 
of 
active 
substance 
florbetaben (18F) 
is: 
[18F]fluoroethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy}phenyl)vinyl]-N-methylaniline,  its  molecular  formula  is  C 21H26
NO3 and it has the following structure: 
4-[(E)-2-(4-{2-[2-(2-
18F 
The active substance is insoluble in water, practically insoluble in ethanol, slightly soluble in acetonitrile 
and  soluble  in  dimethylformamide.  Its  PKa-value  is  4.5±0.2  (using  acetonitrile  as  cosolvent), 
LogP(o/w)=3.3  (octanol:buffer  pH  7),  it  has  not  chiral  molecular  structure,  hygroscopicity  and 
polymorphism are not relevant for this active substance due to the fact that it is not isolated. 
Manufacture 
The  active  substance,  florbetaben (18F),  is  not  isolated  and  it  is  synthesized  in  situ  during  the 
manufacture  of  the  finished  product  using  a  non-radioactive  chemical  precursor  as  the  key  starting 
material. The manufacturing process is a continuous process without intermediates  
The  manufacturing  process  of  PET  radiopharmaceuticals  uses  characteristic  automated  and  remote 
controlled  apparatus  called  modules.  They  contain  the  necessary  ‘hardware’  components  to  perform 
the synthesis 
Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  characterisation  of  the  active 
substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on  chemistry  of  new  active 
substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well  discussed  with  regards  to  their  origin  and 
characterised.  
Adequate specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents 
have  been  presented.  Adequate  specification  of  the  IFP  (Integrated  Fluidic  Processor)  including 
inspection  of  absence  of  defects,  functional  testing,  bioburden  and  endotoxins  limits  has  been 
presented.  
Relevant  leachable  test  on  the  IFP  have  been  initiated.  Although  the  leachable  study  is  still  not 
completed,  the  control  of  the  whole  process  guarantees  the  quality  and  safety  of  the  product.  
However  based  on  the  available  data,  the  CHMP  recommends  the  Marketing  authorisation  holder 
(MAH) to provide results of the studies once they are available 
Specification 
The active substance florbetaben (18F) is not isolated during the manufacturing of Neuraceq. Details of 
the specified limits are described on the product specification sections. 
Appropriate specification for the main precursor, has been presented,  and it includes tests for colour, 
identity (IR and HPLC), water (KF), assay (HPLC) and impurities (GC and HPLC). 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch  results  are  given  for  three  commercial  scale  batches  of  precursor,  and  additional  batches  used 
for the clinical trials. All results comply with the specifications.

Stability 
Not applicable. The active substance cannot be stored. 
2.2.3. Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The  objective  of  the  development  was  to  get  a  parenteral  formulation  suitable  for  intravenous 
injection,  protected  against  the  radiolysis  and  convenient  for  patient  administration.Thefinal 
formulation  is  optimised  for  the  protection  against  radiolysis,  to  reduce  the  adsorption  on  sterilising 
filters, and also to enhance the solubility and water for injection. The formulations used at the different 
stages of the clinical development were described and the stage of the clinical trial in which they were 
used. 
The parenteral finished product is sterilized by sterile filtration. This sterilization method was selected 
instead of heat sterilization because of the susceptibility of the drug substance and of ascorbic acid to 
decompose  at  higher  temperatures.  The  microbiological  safety  of  the  manufacturing  process  is 
favoured by several process parameters and by use of harsh reaction conditions that limit the risk of 
microbial  growth.    Integrity  testing  of  the  sterile  filter  is  performed  post-filtration  as  process  control 
and  required  for  release  of  the  drug  product.  Batches  of  florbetaben (18F)  solution  for  injection  are 
subject to testing for sterility and endotoxins as part of the drug product specification. 
Detailed  information  related  to  the  container  closer  system  such  as  studies  on  the  closure  integrity 
(physical  and  microbiological  tests),  declaration  of  compliance  with  relevant  Ph.Eur,  studies  on 
compatibility of the vial and the stopper with the drug product, self-sealing test of the rubber closure 
and description of the pre-sterilisation of the vials and the stoppers was provided. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The primary packaging is Type I glass vial, sealed with a chlorobutyl stopper and aluminum seal. The 
material  complies  with  Ph  Eur  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
By  contrast  to  conventional  pharmaceutical  products,  the  manufacturing  of  PET  tracers  is  not  divided 
into separate manufacturing steps. The production of the active substance (chemical manufacturing) is 
directly  followed  by  the  manufacturing  of  the  finished  product  (pharmaceutical  manufacturing).  The 
manufacture  of  the  active  substance  takes  place  “in  situ”  during  the  manufacturing  process  of  the 
finished product which is a continuous highly automated process which does not allow the isolation of 
the active substance florbetaben (18F). 
The  manufacturing  process  can  be  described  in  five  steps.  The  first  three  steps  (production  of  the 
radionuclide  18F  in  a  cyclotron,  synthesis  and  purification)  describe  the  manufacturing  of  the  active 
Neuraceq 
EMA/5028/2014 
Page 10/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
substance,  while  the  last  two  steps  (sterilising  filtration  and  aseptic  dispensing  steps)  describe  the 
manufacturing of the drug product. 
The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard  manufacturing  process.  Major  steps  of  the 
manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a 
reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of 
pharmaceutical  form:  assay  (radioactive  concentration),  clarity  (visual  inspection),  radionuclidic 
identity  and  purity  (half-life  and  gamma  spectrometry) (Ph  Eur),  radiochemical identity(HPLC), 
chemical identity of florbetaben (HPLC), radiochemical purity (HPLC), chemical content of florbetaben  
and  chemical  impurities  (HPLC),  acetonitrile  (GC),  bacterial  endotoxin  (Ph  Eur),  sterile  filter  integrity 
and sterility (Ph Eur). 
Batch analysis results are provided for 18 production scale batches manufactured in 6 different sites (3 
each)  confirming  the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to  manufacture  to  the 
intended product specification.  
The  finished  product  is  released  on  the  market  based  on  the  above  release  specifications,  through 
traditional final product release testing, although sterility test and the radionuclidic purity test for long 
lasting radionuclides are conducted after batch release (as usual for these type of products). 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 commercial scale batches for florbetaben (18F) solution for injection at temperature 
storage conditions of 5 °C, 25 °C and 40 °C (according ICH) are presented covering a storage period of 
10 hours. 
In  addition  stability  data  of  15  (5  sites,  3  batches  each)  commercial  scale  batches  of  florbetaben 
solution  for  injection  at  storage  conditions  of  25  °C  are  presented  covering  a  storage  period  of  10 
hours.  All  batches  are  packaged  in  the  commercial  packaging  materials  (Glass  vial  15  mL  colorless 
glass type 1 sealed with a chlorobutyl stopper and aluminium seal). 
Stress  tests  at  higher  temperatures  were  not  performed  since  the  secondary  container  necessary  for 
radioprotection reasons also has a temperature shielding effect. 
Photo  stability  tests  were  not  performed  since  the  secondary  container  necessary  for  radioprotection 
reasons also protects the vial against light. 
The  results  demonstrate  that  the  finished  product  remains  stable  under  long-term  and  accelerated 
conditions for the tested period of 10 hours. 
All  stability 
indicating  parameters,:  clarity,  pH,  radiochemical  identity  radiochemical  purity, 
radiochemical  impurities  were  tested  according  to  the  release  test  procedures  and  evaluated  against 
Neuraceq 
EMA/5028/2014 
Page 11/114 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  specification.  In  addition,  sterility  test  and  radionuclidic  purity  test  for  long  lasting  radionuclides, 
performed after the end of shelf-life were also satisfactory. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The  quality  of  Neuraceq 
is  adequately  established.  In  general,  satisfactory  chemical  and 
pharmaceutical  documentation  has  been  submitted  for  marketing  authorisation.  Information  on 
development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  has  been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity 
of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
Nevertheless, based on the available data, the CHMP recommends the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) to complete the leachable test studies on the IFP (Integrated Fluidic Processor). In case of out 
of specification results occur, the MAH is reminded that such would need to be reported to the Agency 
and to the Rapporteurs 
2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
1.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
1.4.1.  Introduction 
1.4.2.  Pharmacology 
The  primary  pharmacodynamics  studies  submitted  by  the  Applicant  show  that  florbetaben  had 
nanomolar  affinity  to  synthetic  Aβ1-42  fibrils  and  AD  brain  homogenate.  High  levels  of  3H-florbetaben 
binding were found in cortical regions of AD patients showing the following rank order frontal cortex > 
parietal cortex > temporal cortex. No difference in binding between AD patients and control group was 
detected in the cerebellum, indicating that the cerebellum could be used as a reference region for PET 
image  analysis.  The  ApoE  ε4  status  of  the  AD  patients  did  not  impact  3H-florbetaben  binding  to  AD 
brain homogenates. 
Florbetaben binding to β-amyloid deposits correlated with β-amyloid specific IHC and Bielchowsky stain 
(silver staining). Florbetaben did not bind to tau NFT and α-synuclein positive lesions in cortical brain 
tissue sections of FTD and LBD patients, respectively. 
In  the  secondary  pharmacodynamics  studies,  florbetaben  did  not  show  significant  binding  to  any 
receptor or transporter assayed.  
Regarding  safety  pharmacology,  the  effects  of  florbetaben  hydrochloride  in  central  nervous  system, 
cardiovascular  and  respiratory  systems  and  renal  function  were  evaluated.  No  treatment-related 
effects were  found in any system, although some effects on the respiratory system were observed in 
the repeated-dose toxicity study in rats.

However,  the  cardiohemodynamics  study  was  conducted  in  anesthetized  dogs  (A45856).  Despite  the 
preference  for  unanesthetized  animals stated  in  the  guideline  CPMP/ICH/539/00  S7A, it is  considered 
that the use of anesthetized animals for assessing cardiovascular effects of drugs is a valid approach, 
due to the highest sensitivity for detecting possible drug-induced effects and the use of more invasive 
techniques.  In  addition,  the  Applicant  conducted  an  exploratory  study  in  conscious  dogs  but  without 
control  group  and  with  a  very  small  number  of  animals.  Therefore,  the  study  A45856  is  considered 
appropriate. 
The lack of pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies is acceptable considering the low mass dose of 
19F-florbetaben  hydrochloride  given,  its  specific  binding  to  beta-amyloid  deposits  and  the  lack  of 
binding  shown  in  the  radioligand-binding  assay  including  a  78-target  panel  of  animal  and  human 
receptors, ion channels and transporters. 
1.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies 
Pharmacokinetics  of  non-labeled  19F-florbetaben  were  studied  in  vivo  in  Wistar  rats  and  Beagle  dogs 
after  single  intravenous  administration.  Data  on  pharmacokinetics  after  repeated  administration  were 
obtained from the sub-acute toxicity studies in dogs. The biodistribution of 18F-florbetaben was studied 
in NMRI mice. In addition, in vitro studies were conducted to investigate plasma protein binding, blood 
cell/plasma  partitioning  and  drug  metabolism  in  several  species  including  man,  as  well  as  the  drug-
drug interaction potential. 
In  vitro  studies  showed  that  plasma  protein  binding  in  human  was  high.  Pharmacokinetic  studies  in 
rats after single intravenous administration were conducted. The compound was rapidly eliminated and 
the volume of distribution was high. No differences between male and female animals were observed. 
A  biodistribution  study  conducted  in  male  mice  showed  a  high  initial  brain  uptake  followed  by  a  fast 
initial elimination of radioactivity from the brain. A slow elimination of the radioactivity from the blood 
was detected. The extrapolation of mouse data to human indicated that an infusion of 300 MBq of 18F-
florbetaben to a 70 kg adult patient will result in an effective dose of 3.7 mSv.  
The  in  vivo  PET  study  conducted  in  rhesus  monkeys  showed  that  the  time  of  peak  uptake  of  18F-
florbetaben was between 1.8 and 2.6 minutes and that the radioactivity decreased rapidly in the brain. 
Florbetaben  is  subject  to  two  oxidative  pathways  resulting  mainly  in  N-demethylation  leading  to  the 
main  metabolite  M-1  and  several  minor  polar  metabolites.  No  significant  differences  were  observed 
regarding biotransformation in vitro. After administration of either 18F-florbetaben or 14C-florbetaben to 
mice,  the  parent  compound  represented  the  majority  of  the  radioactivity  in  plasma  and  brain  in  the 
initial  moments,  and  at  later  time  points,  a  polar  fraction  of  metabolites  with  fluoroacetate  as  the 
major component, accounted for most of the radioactivity present in brain and plasma. Metabolite M-1 
was found nearly at all time-points investigated. 
In  human,  several  CYP  isoforms  mediate  the  N-demethylation,  whereas  CYP3A4  contribute  to 
formation of polar metabolites. Clinically, plasma levels are not expected to be highly variable due to 
involvement  of  polymorphic  CYPs  or  to  be  significantly  altered  when  inhibitors  of  single  CYPs  are 
coadministered  to  patients.  Florbetaben  was  not  able  to  inhibit  any  CYP  isoform  except  CYP3A4. 
However, considering that the administered doses of 18F-florbetaben to patients will be< 100 μg, there 
is no risk of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions through inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6 or 
3A4 by 18F-florbetaben. 
1.4.4.  Toxicology 
The formulation used in the non-clinical toxicity studies was different from the clinical one. The clinical 
formulation  contained  florbetaben  as  a  free  base  and  not  florbetaben  hydrochloride.  Florbetaben

hydrochloride  was  used  for  technical  reasons  and  the  formulation  containing  20%  hydroxylpropyl-β-
cyclodextrin was used in order to achieve high exposures, and this was considered acceptable.

The Applicant conducted the recommended standard genotoxicity testing battery. No mutagenic effects 
have been detected for florbetaben hydrochloride in the in vitro or in vivo genotoxicity assays. 
Carcinogenicity 
Considering the absence of a genotoxic risk for florbetaben hydrochloride and the intended clinical use 
of  florbetaben,  and  according  to  the  Guideline  on  the  need  of  carcinogenicity  studies  of 
pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/140/95 S1A), no carcinogenicity studies are required for florbetaben.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Studies on reproductive and developmental toxicity were not performed. Due to the low mass dose, no 
relevant  effects  on  reproductive  function  related  to  chemical  toxicity  are  expected.  Developmental 
toxicity  data  were  not  collected,  since  the  target  population  consists  of  men  and  mainly 
postmenopausal women. If a woman of childbearing potential is intended to be treated, pregnancy has 
to be excluded prior to treatment because of the nature of the clinical drug product including exposure 
to circulating radioactive drug. 
Taking into account the intended clinical use of the drug in elder patients and that the drug is going to 
be administered on few occasions, no reproductive and developmental toxicity studies are considered 
necessary.  In  addition,  the  EMA  Paediatric  Committee  granted  a  product-specific  waiver  for  18F-
florbetaben (EMEA-00I090-PIP01-11).

morphological damage, that was reversible by day 6. After rinsing of the vein, only minimal irritation 
was found on the first two days after treatment with the undiluted drug product, whereas the diluted 
formulation  was  tolerated  without  effects.  The  paravenous  injection  caused  clear-cut  moderate  local 
irritation, with signs of recovery.

Other toxicity studies 
Studies on impurities 
The drug product Florbetaben solution for injection may contain various impurities, mainly reaction-by 
products.  Additional  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  on  the  decayed  clinical  drug  product  in  order  to 
evaluate  potential  degradation  products.  Several  impurities  were  tested  in  the  standard  in  vitro 
genotoxicity testing battery. 
1.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Florbetaben is administered to patients a maximum i.v. dose of 50 μg/person. Typically, only one 
diagnostic administration is required for a patient. 
Phase I assessment 
For florbetaben the following values are used: 
DOSEai = 50 μg (maximum daily dose of the active ingredient) 
Fpen = 1 (default) 
WASTEWinhab = 200 L·inh-1·d-1 (default) 
D = 10 (default, dilution factor). 
The PECsurfacewater for florbetaben is 0.00025 μg/L, which is below the trigger value of 0.01 μg/L, 
and therefore no Phase II assessment is required.  
• 
PBT assessment

Florbetaben PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance 
as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore florbetaben is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
1.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The primary pharmacodynamics studies submitted by the Applicant show that florbetaben binds to β-
amyloid deposits and this binding correlated with β-amyloid specific IHC and Bielschowsky stain (silver 
staining).  Florbetaben  did  not  bind  to tau  NFT  and  α-synuclein positive lesions  in  cortical  brain  tissue 
sections  of  FTD  and  LBD  patients,  respectively.  In  the  secondary  pharmacodynamics  studies, 
florbetaben did not show significant binding to any receptor or transporter assayed.  
Regarding  safety  pharmacology,  the  effects  of  florbetaben  hydrochloride  in  central  nervous  system, 
cardiovascular  and  respiratory  systems  and  renal  function  were  evaluated.  No  treatment-related 
effects were  found in any system, although some effects on the respiratory system were observed in 
the repeated-dose toxicity study in rats. 
The  Applicant  presented  an  extensive  pharmacokinetics  package.  The  Applicant  has  conducted 
pharmacokinetic  studies  in  rats  after  single  intravenous  administration.  The  compound  was  rapidly 
eliminated  and  the  volume  of  distribution  was  high.  A  biodistribution  study  conducted  in  male  mice 
showed a high initial brain uptake followed by a fast initial elimination of radioactivity from the brain. 
Florbetaben  is  subject  to  two  oxidative  pathways  resulting  mainly  in  N-demethylation  leading  to  the 
main  metabolite  M-1  and  several  minor  polar  metabolites.  No  significant  differences  were  observed 
regarding biotransformation in vitro.  
Florbetaben was not able to inhibit any CYP isoform in vitro except CYP3A4. However, considering that 
the  administered  doses  of  18F-florbetaben  to  patients  will  be  <  100  μg,  there  is  no  risk  of  clinically 
relevant drug-drug interactions through inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6 or 3A4 by 18F-florbetaben. 
The  formulation  used  in  the  non-clinical  toxicity  studies  was  different  from  the  clinical  one,  as  the 
clinical formulation contained florbetaben as a free base and not florbetaben hydrochloride. According 
to  the  Applicant,  florbetaben  hydrochloride  was  used  for  technical  reasons  and  the  formulation 
containing  20%  hydroxylpropyl-β-cyclodextrin  was  used  in  order  to  achieve  high  exposures,  and  this 
was accepted.

General  toxicity  studies  with  florbetaben  hydrochloride  were  conducted  in  rats  and  rabbits  (single 
dose)  and  in  rats  and  dogs  (repeated  dose)  by  intravenous  administration.  In  rats,  alterations  in 
respiration  rate  were  found  at  doses  ≥  175  μg/kg,  although  these  findings  were  not  associated  with 
any  other  clinical  finding  or  morphological  correlates.  No  adverse  effects  were  observed  in  dogs  at 
doses up to  200 μg/kg. The safety factors are considered to be  appropriate. The genotoxicity studies 
did not show mutagenic effects. 
The  absence  of  standard  parts  of  pharmacology 
interaction), 
pharmacokinetics (placental transfer, excretion and pharmacokinetic drug interactions) and toxicology 
(reproductive  toxicology  and  carcinogenicity)  was  acceptable  as  the  drug  product  is  intended  as  a 
single administration of a very low dose in elderly patients.

1.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical package presented by the Applicant was considered appropriate.  
Non-clinical  data  reveal  no  special  hazard  for  humans  based  on  conventional  studies  of  safety 
pharmacology,  single  and  repeated  dose  toxicity  and  genotoxicity.The  potential  toxicity  of  28 days  of 
repeated intravenous injections of florbetaben was tested in rats and dogs, and the NOAEL was found 
to be at least 20 times the maximum human dose. 
Chronic  studies  and  carcinogenicity  studies  have  not  been  carried  out,  since  the  medicinal  product  is 
not intended for regular or continuous administration.  
Studies on reproduction toxicity have not been performed.  
1.5.  Clinical aspects 
1.5.1.  Introduction 
Florbetaben  (18F)  is  a  novel  radiopharmaceutical  agent  which  has  been  developed  for  imaging  β-
amyloid  (Aβ)  in  the  human  brain  by  PET.    In  vitro,  Florbetaben  (18F)  binds  with  high  affinity  and 
specificity to Aβ aggregates in brain tissue homogenates from patients with AD. 
The following indication was proposed by the applicant: 
“This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
Neuraceq  is  indicated  for  the  detection  of  β-amyloid  in  the  brain,  thereby  assisting  in  the  differential 
diagnosis  in  adult  patients  who  are  being  evaluated  for  Alzheimer’s  disease  and  other  causes  of 
cognitive decline.” 
The  proposed  activity  to  be  administered  should  not  exceed  360 MBq  and  not  fall  below  240  MBq  of 
florbetaben (18F), administered intravenously as a slow bolus injection (6 sec/ml) without dilution.  The 
administered volume can be up to 10 mL in order to provide the target activity of 300 MBq.  A 15-20 
minute image should be acquired from 45 to 130 minutes post injection.

Findings  from  2  phase  III  studies  (studies  14595  and  16034)  were  presented  as  the  key  evidence 
that florbetaben (18F) allowed the visual detection of β-amyloid in the brain.   
Additional evidence of efficacy from independent sources was presented as supportive: 
• 
Two  proof-of-mechanism  Clinical  Phase  1  studies:  the  first-in-man  proof-of-mechanism 
investigator-sponsored  Melbourne  study  (A42404)  and  the  proof-of-mechanism  Leipzig  study  (Study

Four additional Clinical Phase 1 studies (Studies 91790, 311722, 312161, and 312043) 
Two supportive Clinical Phase 2 studies (Studies 14311 and 311741) 
A  pooled  analyses  of  the  studies  composing  the  florbetaben  (18F)  clinical  development 
Populations studied in the clinical development program included European, US and Japanese healthy 
volunteers  (HVs),  subjects  with  MCI,  pAD,  other  dementias,  and  non-demented  or  Down  syndrome 
(DS) individuals.   
Four  additional  phase  1  studies  evaluated  PK  of  florbetaben  (18F):  A35694,  A42404,  A40922  and 
A42441. 
For the purpose of diagnosis, a single administration of florbetaben (18F) is needed and therefore the 
development program has been designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single use.

a In this study 4/56 subjects received higher (> 5 µg) tracer mass dose. 
b For these 3 studies the protocols required a 5 µg (low) and 55 µg (high) tracer mass dose.  The actual higher mass dose range was applied by means of 
spiking” each dose with 50 µg before administration. 
c Based on respective mean μg ± SD values administered, the actual tracer mass doses received by AD patients and HVs were similar in Parts A and B and 
were, in fact, even slightly lower in Part B.  This is related to improved tracer synthesis during this phase of the study which resulted in increased yield and a 
drug product with more radioactivity per substance.  Thus, less volume was required to achieve the target radioactivity of 300 MBq and with that, less tracer 
mass was administered.

1.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Florbetaben (also referred to as BAY 94-9172, ZK 6013443) is labeled with a radioactive isotope [18F], 
which  has  a  half-life  of  110  minutes.  Florbetaben  is  used  for  diagnostic  purpose  only,  as  a  tracer  in 
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. 
The  dosing  of  florbetaben  is,  however,  based  on  the  radioactivity.  A  dose  of  300  MBq  has  been 
selected  for  the  use  of  florbetaben.  Each  patient  receives  the  same  radioactivity  dose,  whereas  the 
administered mass dose may vary depending on the volume and the concentration of  18F-florbetaben 
in the particular batch. As indicated above, florbetaben is produced at a high specific activity resulting 
in  a  mass  dose  (ie,  the  sum  of  18F  and  19F  florbetaben)  of  equal  or  less  than  3  μg/mL  of  solution. 
Depending  on  the  time  between  manufacturing  and  administration  to  the  patient,  the  volume  to  be 
injected in order to administer a radioactive dose of 300 MBq is between 0.5 and 10 mL, leading to a 
corresponding mass dose of less than 1 μg up to a maximum of 30 μg. 
The  Clinical  Pharmacology  program  contains  information  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  total  18F-
radioactivity in blood/plasma and urine and on pharmacokinetics of the unchanged tracer florbetaben 
in plasma. The pharmacokinetic investigations are considered as supportive data in the overall Clinical 
Pharmacology program as compared to safety and efficacy. 
Pharmacokinetic  data  were  obtained  from  four  Phase  1  studies  (A35694,  A40922,  A42404,  and 
A42441)  comprising  overall  53  healthy  volunteers  (HV),  21  Alzheimer  disease  patients  (AD)  and  5 
patients with frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD). Experimental radio-HPLC analyses of collected 
plasma  samples  for  pharmacokinetic  evaluation  were  always  performed  at  the  clinical  study  site. 
Pharmacokinetics was evaluated using non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and is part of the Summary 
of Clinical Pharmacology. 
Pharmacokinetics  of  florbetaben  has  not  been  investigated  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  and 
hepatic impairment. However, the effect of renal impairment on safety and efficacy was evaluated as 
part  of  a  pooled  analysis  of  Phase  II-III  data  and  as  florbetaben  is  applied  as  a  single  low  i.e. 
pharmacodynamically  inactive  dose,  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hepatic  impairment  do  therefore 
not require dose reduction. 
Ethnic  differences  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of  florbetaben  have  been  performed  between  Caucasian 
(study 311722, A40922) and Japanese population (study 91790, A42441). 
No  dedicated  study  on  the  effect  of  age  and  gender  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  florbetaben  were 
performed.  The  target  population  of  florbetaben  is  mainly  elderly  patients,  this  population  relevantly 
contributed  to  the  clinical  study  population  for  the  characterization  of  safety,  efficacy  and 
pharmacokinetics of florbetaben. 
Study Protocol number: A35694 (310863) 
This study was an open-label, non-randomized, single centre study to evaluate the safety and clinical

• 
SUV (standard uptake values) and SUVR (standard uptake values ratio) 
To assess the ability to distinguish between AD patients and healthy volunteers on the basis of regional 
tracer uptake, the regional radioactivity expressed as standard uptake values (SUVs) were determined. 
The  SUV  was  derived  from  the  activity  concentration  in  a  pre-specified  cerebral  region  of  interest 
(ROI), subject weight and dose injected. SUV values were normalized to SUVs of the cerebellar cortex, 
and presented as SUV ratios (SUVRs). SUVs and SUVRs for each ROI were calculated at several time 
points for image data sets acquired during four post injection (p.i.) intervals (0-90 min, 120-140 min, 
180-200 min and 240-260 min p.i.). 
Comparison  of  regional  tracer  uptake  between  AD  patients  and  healthy  volunteers  SUVs  and  SUVRs 
were  higher  in  AD  patients  in  all  neocortical  regions.  The  differences  in  SUVR  were  most  pronounced 
for  the  ROIs  of  the:  lobus  frontalis  cortex,  gyrus  cingulum  anterior,  gyrus  cingulum  posterior  and

Metabolism and Clearance 
In vitro 
Study  report  A56319:  Identification  of  human  CYP  isoforms  involved  in  the  in  vitro  metabolism  of 
14C-florbetaben. 
In  summary,  florbetaben  is  a  substrate  of  several  CYP  isoforms  in  human.  Clinically,  florbetaben 
plasma  levels  are  not  expected  to  be  highly  variable  due  to  involvement  of  polymorphic  CYPs  (2D6, 
2C19) or to be significantly altered when inhibitors of single CYPs are co-administered to patients. 
Study  report  A41537:  In  Vitro  metabolic  profiling  and  species  comparison  in  liver  microsomes  and 
hepatocytes. 
In summary, in this in vitro study, no major species differences in the metabolism of 19Fflorbetaben in 
liver microsomes were found in all species investigated. Following incubation with human hepatocytes, 
demethylation was the major pathway as well as glucuronidation as phase II reaction.

In vivo 
In  humans,  florbetaben  is  predominantly  metabolized  to  a  polar  metabolite  fraction  comprising 
presumably  several  components  based  on  radio-HPLC  analysis.  A  second,  less  hydrophilic  metabolite 
was detected amounting to less than 10% of total radioactivity in plasma. 
Preclinical  investigations  in  animals  suggest  that  18F-fluoroacetate  is  a  main  component  of  this  polar 
metabolite fraction.  18F-flouroacetate can enter the brain but it is assumed that F18-fluoroacetate will 
not bind to beta-amyloid and does not interfere with the specific detection of beta-amyloid deposits by 
florbetaben (A35694).  
The metabolism data show that florbetaben is intensively cleared by metabolic oxidative reactions. The 
18F-labeled metabolites are not considered to impair the diagnostic evaluation by florbetaben. 
Protocol number: 310863 (A35694) 
Florbetaben  was  rapidly  eliminated  from  plasma.  At  10  min  post  injection  only  about  30  to  40%  of 
non-metabolized florbetaben was detected in plasma on average and approx. 10 to 20% after 30 min 
post injection. No significant differences between patients and healthy volunteers were observed.

At  the  first  sampling  time  point  (2.5  min),  almost  all  radioactivity  can  be  attributed  to  the  parent 
compound  florbetaben.  Thereafter,  radioactivity  concentrations  of  florbetaben  rapidly  decrease  in

plasma.  At  30  min  post  injection,  the  relative  contribution  of  florbetaben  is  around  10%  of  all 
integrated radioactivity.

The polar metabolite fraction is the main 18F-labelled component in plasma samples which was rapidly 
formed  representing  almost  all  18F-radioactivity  in  plasma  from  30  min  post  injection  onwards.  In 
addition, low levels of the metabolite N-desmethyl florbetaben was detected amounting to about 10 % 
of total radioactivity at 30 min post injection.

Metabolism proposed pathway 
The  structure  of  18F-AV1/ZK  suggests  2  main  metabolic  pathways.  The  lack  of  accumulation  of  18F-
NH2-AV1/ZK  over  the  60  min  period  suggests  that  this  metabolite  might  present  an  metabolic 
intermediate that is further degraded by cleavage of the PEG site chain similarily as proposed for  18F-
AV1/ZK.

Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
To explore the potential impact of florbetaben and its metabolites on beta-amyloid binding parameters, 
a  model-based  quantification  of  binding  parameters  from  florbetaben  PET  was  performed  by  two 
experts  located  at  the  investigational  site  (G.  Becker,  Nuclear  Medicine  Department,  University  of 
Leipzig,  Germany)  as  well  as  by  a  further  independent  expert  (M.  Ichise,  Columbia  Kreitchman  PET 
Center New York, USA). 
The  clinical  PK  data  showed  that  the  radiolabeled  metabolites  contributed  significantly  to  the  total 
radioactivity and preclinical experiments suggested that these metabolites can distribute into the brain. 
Consistent  modeling  results  of  the  clinical  PK  could  be  obtained  with  the  assumption  that  the 
metabolites  enter  the  brain  and  contribute  to  the  measured  PET  signal  as well  as  with an  absence  of 
18F-labeled metabolites in the brain. 
The  binding  parameters  of  florbetaben  that  were  simulated  with  the  model  that  did  not  consider  the 
formation  of  radiolabeled  metabolites  correlated  very  well  with  those  that  accounted  for  it  and  all 
binding  parameters  discriminated  effectively  between  beta-amyloid  positive  and  negative  scans. 
Therefore,  the  modelling  data  suggest  that  the  metabolite  did  not  influence  the  image  results  in  any 
significant manner. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
N/A 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Pharmacokinetics of florbetaben has not been investigated in patients with renal impairment during a 
dedicated  clinical  pharmacology  study.  However,  influence  of  renal  impaired  function  on  safety  and 
efficacy was evaluated as part of a pooled analysis of Phase II clinical data (study 91708 (311741) Part 
A and Part B, A45264).  
CrCl did not show a relevant influence on the efficacy of florbetaben. The ANCOVA model for detection 
of  differences  in  CrCl  with  age  and  results  of  the  visual  assessment  could  not  detect  differences, 
neither  in  patients  nor  in  controls.  Thus  renal  function  did  not  influence  the  efficacy  of  florbetaben 
(A45264). 
Similar  results  were  found  in  study  Part  B  (including  28%  of  AD  patients  with  normal  renal  function 
and 47/ 21/ 3% of patients with mild/ moderate/ severe renal impairment, respectively) (A45264). 
The  pooled  analysis  of  all  Phase  I  –   III  data  included  406  AD  patients  and  291  non-demented 
volunteers (≥  55 years), and showed no relevant effect of renal function on the safety of florbetaben. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Pharmacokinetics of florbetaben have not been investigated in patients with hepatic impairment during 
a  dedicated  clinical  pharmacology  study.  Florbetaben  is  metabolized  by  several  CYP  enzymes  (see 
above) that are not exclusively expressed in the liver but also present in other organs.  
Neuraceq 
EMA/5028/2014 
Page 34/114 
 
 
 
 
 
Beside  the  liver,  CYP2J2  is  expressed  in  the  intestine,  lung  and  heart.  Thus,  in  the  case  of  hepatic 
impairment with reduced metabolic capacity, a compensatory extrahepatic metabolic capacity may be 
present.  Considering  furthermore,  that  florbetaben  is  applied  as  a  single  low  microdose  i.e. 
pharmacodynamically inactive dose, a clinically relevant effect with respect to safety and efficacy is not 
expected in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and do therefore not require a dose 
reduction. 
• 
Age and Gender 
No  dedicated  study  on  the  effect  of  age  and  gender  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  florbetaben  were 
performed. Because of the specific indication for florbetaben (i.e. Alzheimer’s disease), a population 
at the higher age range was inherent to the clinical development program. 
Accordingly,  pharmacokinetic  data  were  obtained  in  an  elderly  population.  In  the  PK  studies,  gender 
distribution was balanced (311722: 12 male, 12 female) or had a higher percentage of male subjects 
(310863:  75%  male;  91790:  70%  male).  Influence  of  age  and  gender  on  PK  parameters  was  not 
evaluated. 
The pooled analysis of Phase I –  III safety data included 872 subjects, with a mean age of 67.7±15.6 
years (range: 21 to 98 years). The population was almost equally divided between males and females 
(54% vs 46%). There was no difference in safety across subject group by age or gender. There was a 
trend  to  higher  SUVRs  with  increasing  age,  a  finding  which  reflects  the  development  of  the  disease 
over  time.  No  difference  in  SUVR  means  between  males  and  females  was  observed  in  either  non-
demented volunteers or AD subjects. 
Data suggest that dose adjustment based on age and gender is not necessary. 
• 
Race 
Two clinical studies with identical designs were performed in Caucasian (A40922, Study  311722)  and 
Japanese  (A42441,  Study  91790)  healthy  volunteers.  In  these  studies,  the  PK  of  a  single 
administration of 300 MBq florbetaben, with either a low (≤  5 μg) or high (50 to 55 μg) tracer mass 
dose was analysed. Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated based on the total 18F-radioactivity in 
plasma and urine followed by metabolite analysis using radio-HPLC. Both ethnic and tracer mass dose 
differences were evaluated. 
The total  18F-radioactivity concentration-time profiles and the area under the curve from time zero to 
the  last  data  point  (AUC0-tlast)  for  Caucasian  and  Japanese  populations  are  shown  in  Figure  13.  The 
calculated  dose  normalized  AUC 0-tlast  values  were  similar  between  the  low  and  high  dose  as  well  as 
between  Caucasian  and  Japanese  subjects  (see  figure  14).  Furthermore,  no  significant  differences  in 
the AUC 0-tlast could be detected between Japanese and Caucasian population.

Children 
The pharmacokinetics in children was not studied as Florbetaben is not indicated for use in the 
pediatric population. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been performed in humans. 
In  vitro  studies  using  human  liver  microsomes  did  not  show  inhibitory  effects  on  CYP1A2,  2C8,  2C9, 
and 2D6 (IC50: >2 μM). CYP3A4 activity was moderately inhibited with IC 50 values of 1.6 μM and 1.4 
μM,  respectively  when  midazolam  and  testosterone  were  applied  as  substrates.  Preincubation  (30 
min) of 19F-florbetaben with NADPH-supplemented human liver microsomes slightly decreased CYP3A4 
activities  compared  to  the  co-incubation  experiment  as  indicated  by  IC 50  values  of  1.0  μM  on 
midazolam  1’-hydroxylation  and  0.7  μM  on  testosterone  6β-hydroxylation,  respectively.  The 
observed  inhibition  of  enzymes  by  florbetaben  is  not  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant  and  no  drug 
interaction with co-medications is expected because florbetaben is administered as a single microdose 
(less than 100 μg) and the observed mean maximum total plasma concentrations in all studies did not 
exceed 0.01 μM at the high mass dose of 50-55 μg (study 311722 and study 91790). This threshold 
is about 100-fold below the observed inhibitory IC 50-concentration of 1 μM (A56318). 
A  clinically  relevant  drug-drug  interaction  affecting  the  pharmacokinetics  of  florbetaben  by  co-
administration  of  a  CYP-dependent  inhibitor  can  be  excluded,  because  florbetaben  is  metabolized  by 
several CYP enzymes and inhibition of one enzyme is unlikely to show any effect. 
The induction potential of cytochrome P450 e.g CYP3A4, CYP1A2 by florbetaben in in vitro assays e.g. 
human  hepatocytes  was  not  investigated  because  florbetaben  is  intended  for  single  use  and  relevant 
induction of CYP enzymes requires a continuous exposure with the inducer over several days. Thus, no 
clinically relevant induction will occur with florbetaben. 
Induction  of  CYP3A4  or  CYP1A2  by  an  inducer  given  as  co-medication,  will  not  result  in  clinically 
relevant changes in florbetaben concentrations because florbetaben is metabolized by several enzymes 
and the overall relative contribution of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 is lower compared to CYP2J2 and CYP4F2.

1.5.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Florbetaben  (18F)  is  a  molecular  imaging  agent  designed  for  PET  imaging  of  β-amyloid  in  the  human 
brain.   
Florbetaben  (18F)  is  administered  in  doses  no  higher  than  30  µg  and  does  not  have  any  detectable 
pharmacological activity.  
Six  phase  I  studies  were  performed  to  primarily  or  secondarily  analyse  the  brain  uptake  and 
distribution of florbetaben (18F) in probable AD (pAD) patients, HVs or other demented patients.  
Mechanism of action 
The company attempts florbetaben (18F) as an in vivo tracer of Aß deposition in the brain.  The fluor 
(18F)  isotope  produces  a  positron  signal  that  is  detected  by  a  PET  scanner.    The  correlation  of 
florbetaben  (18F)  binding  to  β-amyloid  deposition  was  investigated  in  vitro  studies  (for  further 
information, see the preclinical assessment report). 
The  binding  target(s)  of  florbetaben  (18F)  has  not  been  clearly  elucidated  in  vivo  either  in  normal 
subjects  or  in  targeted  patients.    In  the  pivotal  study  14595  in  end-of-life  patients,  whose  cognitive 
impairment  status  was  difficult  to  determine,  correlation  between  the  in  vivo  florbetaben  (18F) 
quantitative  uptake  in  cortical  grey  matter  and  the  β-amyloid  burden  averaged  from  six  particular 
cortical regions was not assessed quantitatively by using correlation analysis.   
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
At  the  low  chemical  concentrations  present  in  Neuraceq,  florbetaben  (18F)  does  not  have  any 
detectable pharmacological activity. 
Brain uptake and distribution of florbetaben (18F) was evaluated in five phase 1 studies mostly aimed 
to evaluate other clinical aspects (study A42404, 310863, 311722, 91790 and 312161).  Only relevant 
information about their pharmacodynamics analyses and results are displayed hereinafter. 
Study A42404 
This  first-in-man  investigator-sponsored  study  was  a  single  center,  open-label,  pilot  study  to  validate 
florbetaben (18F) as a marker of brain amyloid by comparison of the in-vivo binding characteristics in 
different neurodegenerative dementias and HVs.  The analysis set for efficacy included 15 old HVs, 15 
AD with mild-moderate dementia, 11 FTLD, 6 DLB, 5 PD, and 4 VaD subjects. 
PET  images  after  administration  of  300  MBq  ±  20%  florbetaben  (18F)  with  <  5  μg  tracer  mass  dose 
were visually evaluated in rainbow color scale, transverse orientation. The summed, dynamic frames of 
the florbetaben (18F) PET images were viewed from 45-120 minutes post injection (p.i.).  One blinded 
nuclear  Medicine  physician  provided  a  regional  cortical  tracer  binding  (RCTB)  score  in  8  pre-specific 
regions  and  a  BAPL  score  per  subject,  using  the  scoring  algorithm  A  of  study  311741.    Images  were 
also quantitatively analysed after corregistration with MRI, and SUVR values were calculated.  Selected 
regions  were  based  on  the  previous  experience  with  C11-PIB:  frontal,  parietal,  lateral  and  medial 
temporal  cortices,  occipital  cortex,  caudate,  posterior  cingulate  /precuneus  cortex,  and  anterior 
cingulate gyrus. 
The applicant states that the brain uptake kinetics of florbetaben (18F) tracer and the visual inspection 
of  images  from  various  time  points  post  injection  showed  that  the  optimal  imaging  time  window  for 
florbetaben  (18F)  lies  between  80  and  120  minutes  p.i.      The  results  showed  no  difference  in  the 
quality  score  between  the  20  and  30  minutes  duration  images,  while  the  10  minutes  images  were 
visually inferior.  However, the company currently acknowledges not having access to the raw data of 
study A42404 regarding image quality and diagnostic confidence of the compared alternatives in which 
optimal PET timing recommendations were based.

Results for the 20 minutes duration (90 - 110 minutes p.i.) are here summarised: 
•  All  AD  subjects  showed  extensive  cortical  florbetaben  (18F)  retention  that  was  greater  in  the 
frontal and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus cortex, and slightly less in the lateral temporal 
and  parietal  cortex.  In  the  blinded  reading,  images  from  AD  subjects  were  assessed  as 
“probable AD” in all cases. 
Twelve (80%) of the HVs presented no cortical grey matter β-amyloid florbetaben (18F) uptake 
and their scans were clearly distinguishable from subjects with AD. However, three (20%) HVs 
were  classified  as  having  mild  to  diffuse  cortical  β-amyloid  florbetaben  (18F)  uptake.  One 
blinded reader rated the scans on two of these three subjects as being positive. 
• 
•  All 5 PD, 3 of 4 VaD, 10 of 11 FTLD and 4 of 6 DLB subjects had low cortical florbetaben (18F) 
β-amyloid  uptake.  One  FTLD  subject  showed  mild  frontal  uptake  of  florbetaben  (18F)  β-
amyloid,  while  2  DLB  subjects  presented  with  cortical  uptake  similar  in  distribution  to  AD. 
However, when present, the degree of β-amyloid florbetaben (18F) uptake in the DLB subjects 
was generally lower to the degree observed in AD. One VaD subject presented with a PET scan 
indistinguishable from AD. 
The  sensitivity  of  florbetaben  (18F)  β-amyloid  PET  for  the  detection  of  AD  vs  HV  by  blinded  visual 
reading  of  the  images,  at  90  -  110  minutes  p.i.  of  florbetaben  (18F)  for  20  minutes,  and  with  the 
standard of reference based on clinical criteria was assessed as 97% with a specificity of 88%. 
The mean cortical SUVR for the 90 to 110 minutes period in AD subjects (2.02 ± 0.3) was significantly 
higher  (P  <  0.0001,  effect  size  d  =  3.2)  than  in  the  HVs  (1.29  ±  0.2)  (text  table  7).  Grey  matter 
regions  in  the  AD  group  were  significantly  higher  (P  <  0.05)  than  in  HV  group.    Specific  differences 
were observed between white and grey matter structures in HVs at 90-110 min p.i. florbetaben (18F) 
images. 
There was scalp and facial activity detected in scans acquired at 90-110 min and 135-155 min p.i.  The 
reason for this accumulation is unknown, but the applicant hypothesis that such activity may be due to 
accumulation of florbetaben (18F) or to any of its radioactive metabolites or to blood radioactivity.

Study 310863 
This  company-sponsored  proof  of  mechanism  study  was  a  single  center,  open-label,  non-randomized 
study mainly to validate florbetaben (18F) as a marker of brain amyloid by comparison of the in-vivo 
binding  characteristics  in  AD,  FTLD  and  HVs.    10  subjects  with  mild  to  moderate  AD  (≥  55  years  of 
age),  10  age-  and  sex  matched  HVs, and  3  subjects  with  FTLD  (≥  50  years  of  age)  were  included  in 
the efficacy assessment. 
Florbetaben (18F) PET images after administration of 300 MBq ± 20% florbetaben (18F) (with ≤ 5 μg 
tracer mass dose) were visually evaluated in rainbow color scale, transverse orientation. The summed, 
dynamic  frames  of  the  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images  were  viewed  from  70-90  minutes  post  injection 
(p.i.).    The  same  8  regions,  as  assessed  in  the  Melbourne  PoM  study  (A42404),  were  assessed  by  3 
blinded  neuro-PET  experts.    The  images  were  visually  scored  by  a  method  that  was  not  later 
implemented  in  phase  2  studies.    Images  were  also  quantitatively  analysed  after  corregistration  with 
MRI, and SUVR values were calculated. 
The results of the independent assessment of images from AD subjects and from HVs, carried out by 
all three readers showed that there was total agreement between all three readers for 8 out of 10 AD 
subjects.  The scans of 9 out of 10 HVs were classified by all three readers as normal.  Sensitivity of 
florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scan  for  differentiating  between  AD  and  HVs  on  the  basis  of  tracer  uptake 
pattern and with clinical criteria as the SoR was 0.87 (average of three readers; lower limit of the 95% 
CI = 0.67). The specificity for detection of a HV based on the lack of cortical tracer uptake was 0.90 
(lower limit of 95% CI = 0.70). (There was a high inter-reader agreement between the three readers 
with a resulting kappa value of 0.94 for Readers 1 and 3, and Readers 2 and 3 while the kappa value 
for Readers 1 and 2 was 0.88. Two of the three readers attained a sensitivity and specificity of 90%, 
respectively.) 
Calculated SUVRs were higher in AD subjects in all cortical regions and in the striatum.  
Study 311722 
This  was  a  single-blind,  randomized,  placebo  (vehicle)-controlled,  parallel-group,  single  center  study 
aimed secondarily at determining cerebral florbetaben (18F) uptake by visual and quantitative analysis 
comparing injection of 300 MBq ± 20% using high specific radioactivity (i.e. with < 5 μg tracer mass) 
and) and low specific radioactivity (i.e. with > 50 to ≤ 55 μg tracer mass) in HVs.   
A total of 24 HVs were randomized and received either florbetaben or placebo (vehicle) in two groups 
of  12  HVs  each.  Six  HVs  received  vehicle,  9  subjects  received  low  tracer  mass  dose,  and  9  subjects 
received  high  tracer  mass  dose.  Males  and  females  were  equally  enrolled  in  the  study.  The  overall 
mean age of the 24 HVs was 62.4 years and the average BMI was 26.1 kg/m2. The FAS included 18 
subjects  all  randomized  to  the  active  drug  (excluding  the  6  vehicle  subjects),  who  had  sufficient

information available, to analyze the pharmacodynamics and PK data. The PPS included 17 subjects (1 
subject  was  excluded  due  to  a  pelvic  neoplasm  which  was  diagnosed  within  this  study  and  was 
considered a major protocol deviation).  
The  analysis  of  the  visual  PET  image  assessment  was  based  on  scans  taken  at  100-120  minutes  p.i. 
read in color scale by 1 unblinded expert.  Selected regions were similar to those in study A42404.  All 
17 subjects were visually assessed as showing a typical healthy pattern in cerebral PET imaging. One 
HV in the florbetaben (18F) low dose tracer mass group had abnormal findings in several cortical areas 
similar to the patterns observed in the AD subjects. 
There  were  quantitative  analyses  of  PET  images  after  co-registration  with  MRI.    Standardized  uptake 
values (SUVs) and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) from predetermined ROIs were based on 
the FAS of 18 subjects and done by two methods; the investigator (manual) analysis method and the 
automated  analysis  method  applying  the  segmented  template  by  the  MNI.    The  cerebellar  cortex 
showed  the  lowest  tracer  uptake  in  both  groups.    Other  regions  were  found  with  low  tracer  binding 
(subcortical white matter, pons and cerebellar white matter).  Calculated SUVRs were used to describe 
tracer uptake in other brain regions based on cerebellar cortex as reference region.  The differences in 
SUVRs found between the tracer mass dose groups were without clinical relevance (see table 6).  For 
the cerebral cortex-8-ROI (a combination of 8 selected cortical brain ROIs), the geometric means were 
1.359 for florbetaben (18F) low and 1.369 for florbetaben (18F) high. The quotient florbetaben (18F) 
high / florbetaben (18F) low was 1.008 with a 95% CI from 0.896 to 1.133.

Study 91790 
This  study  was  conducted  in  Japanese  HVs  under  a  protocol  similar  in  design  to  the  European  Union 
(EU) Phase 1 Study 311722.   A total of 24 Japanese HVs aged ≥ 55 years received either florbetaben 
(18F) or placebo (vehicle) in two groups of 12 HVs (6 placebo volunteers, 9 HVs receiving low tracer 
mass and 9 HVs receiving high tracer mass).   
There was no difference in visual PET scan reading at 100-120 min p.i. between subjects who received 
the  low  mass  dose  and  the  subjects  who  received  the  high  mass  dose,  showing  all  them  a  typical 
healthy  pattern.  The  differences  in  SUVRs  found  between  the  tracer  mass  dose  groups  were  without 
clinical relevance.

Study 312161 
This was a randomized, cross over, single-blinded, single center aimed to compare the results obtained 
by  visual  evaluation  (primary  objective)  and  by  quantitative  analysis  (secondary  objective)  of  PET 
images of the brain made with a target radioactivity of 250 MBq/≤ 5 μg (low) tracer mass with those 
made with a target radioactivity of 250 MBq/50–55 μg (high) tracer mass. 
The study enrolled 16 subjects where 8 subjects with mild to moderate AD and 8 age-matched HCs 
were randomized to receive either treatment Sequence A (starting with 250 MBq florbetaben at the low 
tracer mass dose of ≤ 5 μg followed by 250 MBq florbetaben at the high tracer-mass dose of > 50 to ≤ 
55 μg) or Sequence B (starting with the high tracer mass dose of > 50 to ≤ 55 μg followed by the low 
tracer mass dose of ≤ 5 μg).  A wash-out period of at least 14 days with a time interval between the 
two injections of 14 to 42 days was utilized. 
Florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images  were  visually  evaluated  in  rainbow  color  scale,  transverse  orientation. 
The  summed,  dynamic  frames  of  the  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images  were  viewed  from  the  acquisition 
interval of 45 to 65 minutes and 90 to 115 minutes post injection (p.i.) Images were read by 3 blinded 
Nuclear Medicine physicians.  The same 8 regions, as assessed in study 42404, were assessed.  Each 
reader  scored  to  obtain  regional  cortical  tracer  binding  (RCTB)  score  in  8  pre-specific  regions  and  a 
BAPL score per subject, using the scoring algorithm A of study 311741.   
When  the  combined  data  from  all  three  raters  was  used  with  the  binominal  (normal/abnormal) 
categorization, a consistent rating for both tracer mass doses was observed in 88% of all image pairs 
for the image acquisition interval 45 to 65 minutes, and in 92% for the image acquisition interval from 
90 to 115 minutes. The CIs were 77% to 98%, and 82% to 100%, respectively. 
The alternative binominal categorization (merging of score 2 and 3) showed slightly lower values.  This 
latter categorization has since been adopted for the two Phase 2 clinical trials (Study 14311 and Study 
311741) and the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (Study 14595). 
The different treatments (florbetaben (18F) tracer high, low) did not result in significant differences in 
the SUVRs determined in some of the cortical regions studied, whereas the subgroups AD and HC show 
different  uptake  and  differences  in  quantitative  values  (see  Table  7).    The  geometric  means  of  the 
ratios of SUVRs of florbetaben (18F) low / florbetaben (18F) high were 1.014 (CI: 0.982-1.047) for the 
cortex-8.

In AD patients, cortical SUVR test–retest variability was 6.2% (range 0.6-12.2%, median 6.6%). In HC 
cortical SUVR test–retest variability was 2.9% (range 0.1-9.0%, median 2.8%). Tracer specific activity 
(high or low mass dose) had no effect on image quality or SUVR. The variability in the AD subjects was 
slightly higher than in the healthy controls. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
• 
In  vitro  studies  using  human  liver  microsomes  showed  only  a  moderate  inhibition  of  CYP  3A4  P450 
enzymes.  Because  florbetaben  is  administered  as  a  single  microdose  resulting  in  low  plasma 
concentrations, no clinically relevant drug interaction with comedications is expected. 
No  in  vivo  pharmacodynamics  drug-drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  with  a  number  of 
drugs belonging to classes that may be frequently used by elderly patients.   
1.5.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PHARMACOKINETICS 
In  all  studies,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  florbetaben  was  investigated  by  analysing  the  total  18F-
radioactivity concentrations in blood and plasma. Determination of the total 18F radioactivity provides 
information about the distribution and elimination from plasma of all 18F-labeled compounds including 
the  non-metabolized  florbetaben  and  its  18F-labeled  metabolites  as  well  renal  excretion  of  these 
components  from  the  body.  Selected  plasma  samples  were  analysed  by  radio-HPLC  to  determine  the 
fraction  of  non-metabolized  florbetaben  in  plasma  and  to  use  this  information  to  estimate  the  main 
pharmacokinetics of florbetaben. 
In  the  three  clinical  studies  focusing  on  pharmacokinetics,  similar  pharmacokinetics  of  total  18F-
radioactivity and florbetaben were observed with no major differences. 
Maximum  plasma  concentrations  of  total  18F-radioactivity  and  florbetaben  were  reached  within  the 
first  1-2  minutes  after  end  of  infusion  of  300  MBq  of  florbetaben  as  slow  intravenous  bolus  over  90 
seconds  (0.02%  ID/mL  [study  310863],  0.003%  ID/mL  and  0.006%  ID/mL  for  Low  dose  and  High 
dose, respectively [study 311722] in Caucasian population and 0.007% ID/mL and 0.009% ID/mL for 
LD  and  HD,  respectively  in  Japanese  population  [study  91790]).  Total  radioactivity  concentration 
declined  rapidly  in  plasma  due  to  rapid  distribution  into  tissues  and  metabolism.  At  10  min  p.i. 
radioactivity concentrations of 0.002% ID/mL [study 310863] 0.002% ID/mL (LD) and 0.003% ID/mL 
(HD)  [study  311722]  and  0.003%  ID/mL  (LD  and  HD  [study  91790]  were  determined  in  plasma 
samples  of  all  3  studies,  and  after  4  hours  post  injection,  no  radioactivity  could  be  quantified  in 
plasma.  There  were  no  significant  differences  in  the  plasma  concentration-time  profiles  of  total 
radioactivity between AD, FTLD, and HV. 
In vitro studies with 18F-florbetaben showed that florbetaben is highly bound to plasma proteins with a 
fraction unbound (fu) of 1.6%. A blood/plasma ratio (B/P) of 0.44 was determined in human blood in 
the concentration range of 0.3 –  3.0 μM suggesting that florbetaben is moderately bound to red cells 
or taken up into blood cells (study A38277). 
After intravenous bolus injection a  18F-radioactivity concentration of 2-3% ID/L is achieved in arterial 
plasma 10 min after injection. Florbetaben is highly bound to plasma proteins (>98.5%). 
Uptake  of  radioactivity  in  the  brain  is  rapid:  A  maximum  amount  of  approximately  6%  of  the 
administered  radioactivity  dose  of  florbetaben  can  be  measured  in  the  brain  at  10-13  min  after 
injection  studies  310863  and  study  311722  in  Caucasian  population  and  study  91790  in  Japanese 
population. The amount of radioactivity in brain afterwards steadily declined to about 3.4% at 40 min 
and  to  about  2%  at  2  h  p.i.  Florbetaben  is  eliminated  from  plasma  of  AD  patients  with  a  mean 
biological  half-life  of  about  1  h.  No  radioactivity  could  be  measured  in  blood  at  about  4  hours  post 
injection. 
The  liver  was  the  organ  with  highest  uptake  of  total  radioactivity.  Maximum  concentrations  of  about 
17%  of  the  radioactivity  dose  in  the  mean  were  measured  15  min  after  injection.  Thereafter,

radioactivity declined slowly amounting to about 5.5% of administered radioactivity dose at 6 hr post 
injection (study 311722). 
During  injection  and  during  the  first  few  minutes  post  injection,  total  radioactivity  concentration  in 
plasma was almost completely represented by florbetaben. At the end of injection, C max concentrations 
of  florbetaben  comprising  18F-  and  19F-florbetaben  correlated  with  the  administered  mass  dose 
reaching  mean  values  between  171  pmol/L  (FTLD)  to  514  pmol/L  (HV)  values  (study  310863,  dose 
range  0.28  -  2.84  μg),  of  about  50  pmol/L  (study  311722,  dose  range  0.2-1.1  μg)  and  365  pmol/L 
(study 91790, dose range 1.9-32 μg) at the low  mass dose or approx. 6500  pmol/L (study 311722) 
and  about  9600  pmol/L  (study  91790)  at  the  high  mass  dose  (50-55  μg).  No  major  differences  in 
maximum florbetaben concentrations were observed between AD patients, FTLD patients and HV when 
normalized to the mass dose. 
Plasma concentrations declined rapidly due to extensive distribution into tissues. A distribution volume 
at steady state (Vss) of about 50  L (study 310863), 196 L (LD) and  116 L (HD) (study 311722)  and 
about  32  L  (LD  and  HD)  in  study  91790  were  determined  with  no  relevant  differences  between  AD, 
FTLD and HV (study 310863). 
The  dose-normalized  systemic  exposure  up  to  the  last  measured  time  point  (AUC0-tlast/D)  was  similar 
between the treatment groups AD, FTLD, HV (study 310683) with values between 0.0087 h/L (AD) and 
0.01  h/L  (FTLD)  and  0.0094  (HV)  and  between  studies.  AUC0-tlast/D  values  of  0.0064  h/L  (low  mass 
dose,  HV)  and  0.0092  h/L  (high  mass  dose,  HV)  were  determined  in  study  311722  and  0.0059  h/L 
(low mass dose, HV) and 0.0075 h/L (high mass dose, HV) in the Japanese study 91790. 
Florbetaben was rapidly eliminated from plasma with a calculated mean terminal half-life of about 1 h 
(study 310863) with no significant differences between AD, FTLD and HV and with a half-life of about 1 
h  and  20  min.  in  study  311722  (similar  between  low  and  high  mass  dose).  The  plasma  clearance 
ranged between 86 L/h  and 115 L/h  with no significant differences between AD, FTLD and HV (study 
310863),  between  low  mass  dose  and  high  mass  dose  in  Caucasian  and  Japanese  population  (study 
311722 and study 91790). These values exceed the physiological liver plasma flow of 40 L/h indicating 
that Florbetaben can be considered to be a “High Clearance drug“(liver extraction ratio > 0.7). 
In  humans,  florbetaben  is  predominantly  metabolized  to  a  polar  metabolite  fraction  comprising 
presumably  several  components  based  on  radio-HPLC  analysis.  A  second,  less  hydrophilic  metabolite 
was detected amounting to less than 10% of total radioactivity in plasma. 
Preclinical  investigations  in  animals  suggest  that  18F-fluoroacetate  is  a  main  component  of  this  polar 
metabolite fraction.  18F-flouroacetate can enter the brain but it is assumed that F18-fluoroacetate will 
not bind to beta-amyloid and does not interfere with the specific detection of beta-amyloid deposits by 
florbetaben  (A35694,  section  16.1.12).  In  vitro  and  preclinical  in  vivo  metabolic  studies  using  radio-
HPLC  together  with  LC-MS/MS  analysis  indicate  that  the  less  hydrophilic  metabolite  represents  N-
desmethyl florbetaben. The contribution of N-desmethyl florbetaben to the specific signal is considered 
to be marginally due to the low occurrence in plasma. 
In  vitro  CYP-phenotyping  studies  showed  that  florbetaben  is  metabolized  by  several  CYP-dependent 
metabolic  pathways  with  CYP1A1,  CYP2J2,  CYP4F2,  CYP4F3b,  and  CYP4F12  as  the  main  enzymes 
mediating the N-demethylation whereas CYP2J2 and CYP3A4 contribute predominantly to the formation 
of polar metabolites. 
The metabolism data show that florbetaben is intensively cleared by metabolic oxidative reactions. The 
18F-labeled metabolites are not considered to impair the diagnostic evaluation by florbetaben. 
Pharmacokinetics of florbetaben has not been investigated in patients with renal impairment during a 
dedicated clinical pharmacology study. However, the effect of renal impairment on safety and efficacy 
was evaluated as part of a pooled analysis of Phase II-III data. 
Pharmacokinetics of florbetaben has not been investigated in patients with hepatic impairment during a 
dedicated  clinical  pharmacology  study.  However,  florbetaben  is  applied  as  a  single  low  i.e. 
pharmacodynamically  inactive  dose.  Patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hepatic  impairment  do  therefore 
not require dose reduction.

In  vitro  studies  using  human  liver  microsomes  showed  only  a  moderate  inhibition  of  CYP  3A4  P450 
enzymes.  Because  florbetaben  is  administered  as  a  single  microdose  resulting  in  low  plasma 
concentrations, no clinically relevant drug interaction with co-medications is expected. 
Because florbetaben is metabolized by several CYP-dependent pathways (study A56318), a drug-drug 
interaction  by  inhibition  of  the  florbetaben  metabolism  by  coadministration  of  an  inhibitor  was  not 
expected. Therefore, no drug-drug interaction studies had been performed in humans. 
The  induction  potential  of  cytochrome  P450  enzymes  e.g.  CYP3A4,  CYP1A2  by  florbetaben  in  vitro 
assays  e.g.  human  hepatocytes  was  not  investigated,  because  florbetaben  is  intended  for  single  use 
only  and  relevant  induction  of  CYP  enzymes  requires  a  continuous  exposure  with  the  inducer  over 
several days. Thus, no clinically relevant induction will be expected with florbetaben. 
No  ethnic  differences  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of  florbetaben  between  Caucasian  (study  311722)  and 
Japanese population (study 91790) were observed. 
No  dedicated  study  on  the  effect  of  age  and  gender  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  florbetaben  were 
performed.  However,  because  the  target  population  of  florbetaben  is  mainly  elderly  patients,  this 
population  relevantly  contributed  to  the  clinical  study  population  for  the  characterization  of  safety, 
efficacy and pharmacokinetics of florbetaben. 
PHARMACODYNAMICS 
The Applicant has provided limited data on pharmacodynamics in this submission. 
Florbetaben (18F) does not have any detectable pharmacological activity.  
Florbetaben  (18F)  is  a  molecular  imaging  agent  designed  for  PET  imaging  of  β-amyloid  in  the  human 
brain.    The  correlation  of  florbetaben  (18F)  binding  to  β-amyloid  deposition  was  investigated  in  vitro 
studies.  The binding target(s) of florbetaben (18F) to particular β-amyloid structures or to other brain 
structures or receptors has not been clearly elucidated in vivo either in normal subjects or in targeted 
patients.    In  the  pivotal  study  14595  in  end-of-life  patients,  whose  cognitive  impairment  status  was 
difficult to determine, quantitative correlation between the in vivo florbetaben (18F) quantitative uptake 
in cortical grey matter and the β-amyloid burden averaged from six particular cortical regions was not 
assessed.  Then, section 5.1. of the SmPC under subheading “Mechanism of action” has been modified 
as follows: 
“Florbetaben  (18F)  binds  to  β-amyloid  neuritic  plaques  in  the  brain.  In  vitro,  florbetaben  (18F)  shows 
nanomolar  binding  affinity  to  synthetic  β-amyloid  fibrils  and  to  AD  brain  homogenate.  In  addition, 
binding of florbetaben (18F) to β-amyloid  plaques in post-mortem AD brain sections was demonstrated 
by  autoradiography  and  supported  by  immunohistochemistry  and  Bielschowsky  stain,  respectively.  In 
vivo,  quantitative  correlation  was  not  assessed  in  end-of-life  patients  between  florbetaben  (18F) 
uptake  in  cortical  grey  matter  and  the  beta-amyloid  deposition  in  autopsied  samples.  The  in  vivo 
binding  of  florbetaben  (18F)  to  other  β-amyloid  structures  or  other  brain  structures  or  receptors 
remains unknown.” 
Florbetaben  (18F)  binds  non-specifically  to  white  matter,  which  is  attributed  to  unspecific  binding  to 
the  lipid-containing  myelin  sheath.    This  is  observed  both  in  normal  and  targeted  patients  (study 
A42404).To this regard, the following information has been included in section 5.2. of the SmPC: 
“The  biophysical  basis  of  the  white  matter  retention  of  florbetaben  (18F)  in  the  living  human  brain 
cannot be definitively explained.  It is hypothesized that unspecific binding of the radiopharmaceutical 
to the lipid-containing myelin sheath may contribute to white matter retention.”   
Moreover,  some  extracerebral  structures  in  the  head  (scalp  and  face)  showed  high  uptake 
(radioactivity  accumulation)  in vivo in  some  cases  unknowing  if  due  to  accumulation  of  florbetaben 
(18F)  or  to  any  of  its  radioactive  metabolites  or  to  blood  radioactivity.    A  wording  is  included  in  the 
SmPC.  The SmPC has also been modified to include that non-specific uptake of florbetaben (18F) may 
appears sometimes in the midsagittal sinus due to the presence of tracer in the blood pool.

In the original SmPC it was recommended a time window of 45-130 min p.i. for 300 MBq florbetaben 
(18F)  PET  image  acquisition  with  a  duration  of  20  minutes.    This  was  based  in  the  phase  1  study 
A42404 in which the florbetaben (18F) PET images were viewed from 45-120 minutes p.i.  Despite the 
company currently acknowledges not having access to the raw data of study A42404 regarding image 
quality and diagnostic confidence of the compared alternatives of different image acquisition times, it 
was  easy  to  differentiate  pAD  and  HVs  by  visual  PET  scan  reading  of  8  particular  brain  regions 
(sensitivity  of  97%  and  specificity  of  88%)  in  a  20-min  duration  scan  at  90  -  110  minutes  p.i.  of 
florbetaben (18F)).  AD subjects showed extensive cortical florbetaben (18F) retention, while most (12 
out of 15) HVs had only non-specific florbetaben (18F) uptake in the white matter without cortical grey 
matter  uptake  and  the  remaining  3  HVs  had  mild  to  diffuse  cortical  uptake.    It  was  also  easy  to 
differentiate  pAD  and  HVs  by  quantitative  mean  PET  values  in  all  regions  of  the  cortex  and  striatal 
regions  at  that  time  point.    Finally,  the  SmPC  recommends  acquisition  of  a 20-minute  PET  image 
starting at approximately 90 minutes after intravenous injection of florbetaben (18F).  
Discrimination by visual and quantitative PET values was not successful for the comparison of AD and 
other non-AD neurodegenerative dementia subgroups in study  A42404, with some overlapping in the 
quantitative uptake between AD and both DLB and VaD in a 20-min duration scan at 90 - 110 minutes 
p.i. of florbetaben (18F).  All PD, VaD, FTLD and DLB subjects had low cortical uptake and no-specific 
uptake  in  the  white  matter,  except  1  FTL  subject  who  showed  mild  frontal  uptake,  2  DLB  subjects 
presenting  with  cortical  uptake  similar  in  distribution  but  generally  lower  in  intensity  to  AD,  and  one 
VaD subject with a PET scan indistinguishable from AD.  Therefore, the SmPC includes in section 4.4. 
under  “Limitations”  that  other  non-AD  dementias  (such  as  PD  and  DLB)  might  show  cortical 
florbetaben (18F) retention. 
Binding of florbetaben (18F) in the cerebellum cortex in all subgroups has not been detailed. 
The  pattern  of  quantitative  PET  uptake  in  HVs  and  AD  subjects  has  been  detailed  in  the  SmPC  as 
follows  “Healthy  controls  show  relatively  low  levels  of  florbetaben  (18F)  retention  in  cortex.    The 
highest level of uptake is in pons and other white matter regions. In AD subjects, cortical regions and 
striatal regions show significantly greater uptake compared to controls. In AD subjects, as in controls, 
there is high retention in pons and other white matter areas.” 
The  company  currently  mentions  about  a  recent  retrospective  study  performed  with  images  obtained 
from study 311741, part A, and diagnostic confidence in discriminating between AD patients and HVs 
was  high  (95%)  for  all  the  20-min,  10-min  and  5-min  scans.    This  data  are  however  obtained  at  a 
particular time-point window of 90 min p.i. and not to the broad recommended window at the SmPC of 
45-130 min p.i. 
The typical normal pattern of PET images was also shown in most HVs at 110-120 min p.i. of 300 MBq 
of florbetaben (18F) in study 311722, independently if using < 5 μg or > 50 to ≤ 55 μg tracer mass 
dose.  The mean quantitative values of florbetaben (18F) PET uptake obtained for 8 particular cortical 
regions and any other brain region allow concluding that no statistical differences existed between both 
tracer mass doses.   
No  visual  differences  in  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scans  between  low  (≤  5  microg)  and  high  (50-55 
microg)  mass  doses,  for  both  pAD  and  age-matched  HVs,  were  displayed  at  8  particular  regions  in 
study  312161,  even  at  45  to  65  minutes  or  at  90  to  115  minutes  post  injection.    The  second  time 
window  showed  better  values.    .    For  some  8  particular  cortical  regions,  it  can  be  concluded  that  no 
statistical  differences  existed  in  the  different  mean  quantitative  florbetaben  (18F)  uptakes  between 
both tracer mass doses either in AD or in HVs, whereas differences existed between disease subgroups 
(pAD and HVs).  SUVRs were highly repeatable between test and retest image results for AD and HC 
subjects, in either mass group, indicating a high degree of test-retest reproducibility. 
In all these three studies above the interpretation criteria of PET images was somehow similar to that 
used in phase 2 and phase 3 trials and the one proposed in clinical practice.    Always the same brain 
regions were analyzed as well as the same visual and quantitative PET reading method was applied –

independent  of  disease  subgroups,  mass  dose  subgroups  or  time  window  subgroups-  within  each  of 
these  three  early  studies.  Selected  regions  were  based  on  the  previous  experience  with  11C-PIB  for 
the  visual  and  quantitative  PET  reading.    These  regions  were  frontal,  parietal,  lateral  and  medial 
temporal  cortices,  occipital  cortex,  caudate,  posterior  cingulate  /precuneus  cortex,  and  anterior 
cingulate gyrus. 
No in vivo pharmacodynamics drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. 
1.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PHARMACOKINETICS 
In the clinical studies focusing on pharmacokinetics, similar pharmacokinetics of total  18F-radioactivity 
and florbetaben were observed with no major differences. 
On  average,  6%  of  the  administered  radioactivity  dose  distributed  into  the  brain  10-13  min  after 
injection  (studies  310863  and  study  311722  in  Caucasian  population  and  study  91790  in  Japanese 
population).  The  amount  of  radioactivity  in  brain  steadily  declined  to  about  3.4%  at  40  min  and  to 
about  2%  at  2  h  p.i.  The  liver  was  the  organ  with  highest  uptake  of  total  radioactivity.  Maximum 
concentrations  of  about  17%  of  the  radioactivity  dose  in  the  mean  were  measured  15  min  after 
injection.  Thereafter,  radioactivity  declined  slowly  amounting  to  about  5.5%  of  administered 
radioactivity dose at 6 hr post injection. 
Florbetaben was rapidly eliminated from plasma with a calculated mean terminal half-life of about 1 h 
(study 310863) with no significant differences between AD, FTLD and HV and with a half-life of about 1 
h  and  20  min.  in  study  311722  (similar  between  low  and  high  mass  dose).  The  plasma  clearance 
ranged between 86 L/h  and 115 L/h  with no significant differences between AD, FTLD and HV (study 
310863),  between  low  mass  dose  and  high  mass  dose  in  Caucasian  and  Japanese  population  (study 
311722 and study 91790). These values exceed the physiological liver plasma flow of 40 L/h indicating 
that Florbetaben can be considered to be a “High Clearance drug“(liver extraction ratio > 0.7). 
In  the  mean  28.5%  of  the  administered  radioactivity  dose  was  renally  excreted  during  a  sampling 
period  between  5.0  h  and  12.3  h  post  injection.  Almost  all  radioactivity  recovered  in  urine  was 
presented by the polar metabolites. 
In  humans,  florbetaben  is  predominantly  metabolized  to  a  polar  metabolite  fraction  comprising 
presumably  several  components  based  on  radio-HPLC  analysis.  A  second,  less  hydrophilic  metabolite 
was detected amounting to less than 10% of total radioactivity in plasma. 
In  vitro  CYP-phenotyping  studies  showed  that  florbetaben  is  metabolized  by  several  CYPdependent 
metabolic  pathways  with  CYP1A1,  CYP2J2,  CYP4F2,  CYP4F3b,  and  CYP4F12  as  the  main  enzymes 
mediating the N-demethylation whereas CYP2J2 and CYP3A4 contribute predominantly to the formation 
of polar metabolites. 
PHARMACODYNAMICS 
It  was  confirmed  in  vitro  that  florbetaben  (18F)  binds  to  synthetic  β-amyloid  fibrils  and    β-amyloid 
plaques in human brain tissue.  The in vivo binding of florbetaben (18F) to other β-amyloid structures 
or other brain structures or receptors remains unknown. 
There  is  discrimination  between  pAD  and  HVs  by  visual  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scan  reading  and 
quantitative  uptake  values  in  some  brain  regions  in  phase  1  studies;  however,  values  might  be 
overlapping in some individual cases. Discrimination between pAD and other non-AD dementias could 
not be concluded. 
The  initially  recommended  time  window  and  duration  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scan  (i.e.  a  20-min 
duration  scan  at  45-130  minutes  p.i.  of  florbetaben  (18F))  cannot  be  justified  on  the  basis  of  visual 
PET  reading  of  study  A42404.    The  influence  of  the  tracer  mass  since  is  negligible  for  both,  AD  and 
HVs.

The quantitative correlation between the in vivo florbetaben (18F) quantitative uptake in cortical grey 
matter and the β-amyloid burden measured by histopathology was not assessed. 
1.6.  Clinical efficacy 
1.6.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The  optimal  dose  was  neither  determined  by  specific  studies  nor  adequately  justified.      Proof  of 
mechanism was based on the detection of specific regional binding (18F) of florbetaben to β-amyloid in 
the brain in vivo as determined in two Phase 1 studies: the Melbourne study (A42404) and the Leipzig 
study (310863). The aim of these studies was to provide initial evidence of the ability of florbetaben to 
differentiate  between  subjects  with  AD  and  HV  on  the  basis  of  visual  detection  of  ß-amyloid  and 
quantitative  PET  results.  Another  objective  was  to  select  the  most  appropriate  activity  of  florbetaben 
(18F)  to  be  used  in  the  clinical  study  program.  The  lowest  activity  of  150  MBq  provided  suboptimal 
image  quality  for  diagnostic  evaluation  while  a  simulated  450  MBq  dose  did  not  improve  these 
endpoints compared to 300 MBq. Therefore, the 300 MBq dose was chosen for the pivotal efficacy and 
safety studies 
The  recommended  activity  of  florbetaben  (18F)  is  a  single  intravenous  injection  of  300  MBq  ±  20% 
(i.e. a minimum of 240 MBq and a maximum of 360 MBq). Aside from the first 4 subjects included in 
study A42404, all subjects received 300 MBq ± 20%.  Due to the cross-over design in study 312161 
involving  two  study  periods  in  two  sequences,  250  MBq  was  used  in  order  to  meet  the  limits  of 
maximum  allowed  radioactive  dose  exposure.  The  tracer  mass  dose  was  modified  from  ≤  5 
microg/injection used in earlier studies to ≤ 50 microg/injection in later studies. 
The final formulation that is proposed for marketing is different from the one used in the single pivotal 
study.      The  company  stated  that  the  impact  of  such  formulation  change  on  efficacy  was  evaluated 
based on pre-clinical and supportive clinical data in addition to theoretical considerations without any 
detail.  To date, the commercial formulation has been administered more than 181 times since January 
2012 in the still ongoing autopsy study and other supportive trials.   
1.6.2.  Main study(ies) 
The  CHMP  considers  that,  from  the  data  provided  by  the  company  to  support  efficacy,  there is  a 
single  pivotal  study  to  base  this  application  (i.e.  14595).    Then,  CPMP/EMA/2330/99, 
CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev  and  EMEA/CHMP/EWP/321180/2008  also  apply.    This  was  a  multi-center, 
single-dose, open-label Phase III study. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Adult subjects willing to donate the brain and undergoing a MRI and PET scan were included.   
Subjects  were  excluded  if  having  severe  cerebral  macrovascular  disease  or  brain  tumor  previously 
verified by MRI.  Additionally, 10 young HVs were also recruited. 
Treatments 
Patients  underwent  screening  visit  before  the  administration  of  florbetaben  (18F),  including  anatomic 
brain  imaging  and  clinical  history.    MRI  had  to  be  performed  within  the  previous  6  months  before  or 
simultaneously to PET image. A yearly repeated MRI brain scan and florbetaben (18F) PET imaging up 
to a 3-year follow-up was offered but not mandatorily, except for HVs.

Each subject received a single i.v. dose of 300 MBq ± 20% of florbetaben. PET imaging for 20 minutes 
was to start approximately at 90 minutes after the injection based on results of study A42404.    
Florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images  were  read  by  3  blinded  independent  readers,  who  were  previously  in-
person trained and qualified, and were also blinded to the standard of truth (SoT) results and all other 
information  about  the  subject.    A  20-min  acquisition  PET  image  was  interpreted  using  a  grey  scale.  
Both visual and quantitative assessments were performed on the regional level data (for those brains 
for which there was histopathologic sampling) and on the subject level data (on all subjects regardless 
of  whether  there  is  histopathology).    For  exhaustive  information  about  the  PET  scan  reading  method 
and the PET reader’s training, see the day-80 and day-150 clinical assessment report.

of regions was performed to include those with high and low likelihood to have amyloid plaques in the 
brain,  and  which  could  be  directly  compared  versus  histopathology  through  corregistration.      The 
criteria to interpret images as normal or abnormal was “yes” or “no” in the regional one based on the 
cortical  uptake  versus  the  white  matter  uptake  in  a  specific  small  predefined  region.      A  composite 
“whole brain” regional visual assessment of those 6 regions was also performed. 
(middle 
regions 
A  subject  level  visual  PET  scan  assessment  was  performed.    Readers  had  to  determine  the  regional 
presence or absence of florbetaben (18F) tracer uptake in the non coregistered PET scan determining 
the  Regional  Cortical  Tracer  Binding  score  (RCTB  =  no,  moderate  or  pronounced  tracer  uptake)  in  4 
predefined regions (frontal, posterior cingulate, lateral temporal and parietal cortex).

Table 12 Definitions of regional cortical tracer binding score (RCTB) 
Regional cortical tracer 
uptake score 
Condition for assessment 
1 (No tracer uptake) 
Tracer uptake (i.e., signal intensity) in gray matter in the region is lower 
than in white matter. 
2 (Moderate tracer uptake) 
Smaller area(s) of tracer uptake equal to or higher than that present in 
white matter: extending beyond the white matter rim to the outer cortical 
margin involving the majority of the slices within the respective region. 
3 (Pronounced tracer 
uptake) 
A large confluent area of tracer uptake equal to or higher than that  present 
in white matter extending beyond the white matter rim to the outer cortical 
margin and involving the entire region including the majority of slices within 
the respective region. 
Note: For a score of tracer uptake in the cortex, the finding should have been present in the majority of 
the slices within the region in question 
The  readers  will  then  determine  the  overall  Brain  Amyloid  Beta  Plaque  Load  (BAPL)  score  which  was 
based  on  the  highest  RCTB  score  in  one  of  the  four  brain  regions.    The  BAPL  was  a  3-grade  scoring 
system (without/moderate/pronounced) assessing beta-amyloid burden of the brain globally (see table 
below).

For efficacy analyses of the subject-level PET scans, scans classified as BAPL 1 are considered normal 
(i.e. no beta-amyloid deposition) and those classified as BAPL 2 or BAPL 3 are considered abnormal (i.e. 
presence of pathological beta-amyloid deposition). 
PET  images  were  also  interpreted  quantitatively  as  SUVRs,  after  being  co-registered  with  MRI,  in  17 
regions of the regional assessment.  Cerebellar cortex was chosen as the optimal reference region for 
quantitation  of  PET  images  based  on  quantitative  uptake  values  in  study  311722.    The  17  different 
regions were selected to cover mainly cortical regions with known presence of beta-amyloid as well as 
some white matter regions.

be  directly  compared  versus  histology  through  co-registration.    Pathology    Consensus  panel  (CP) 
members are asked to answer the question “Is beta-amyloid present in this region - yes or no?”.  
This answer was the SOT.   In answering this question the CP members had to take into account the 
different  methods  (BSS  and  IHC  for  beta  amyloid),  the  different  forms  of  amyloid  deposits  (diffuse, 
neuritic,  vascular)  and  the  different  frequencies  and  their  relative  impact.    It  should  be  a  consensus 
opinion.

In  addition  to  this  categorical  answer,  the  frequency  score  for  post-mortem  estimates  of  neuritic 
plaques  of  the  CERAD  criteria  (Mirra  et  al.  1991)  were  used  for  interpretation  criteria  of  the  post-
mortem  estimates  of  both  neuritic  plaques  measured  by  BSS, diffuse  plaques  measured  by  BSS,  and 
beta-amyloid deposition (diffuse, neuritic, vascular) measured by IHC with anti-amyloid.  
A  “whole  brain”  histopathological  verification  was  also  obtained  from  collapsing  the  results  of  the 
regional histopathological findings from the Pathology CP.   
A final onsite neuropathological diagnosis was also established classifying a patient as “beta-amyloid 
present/not” by using the following age-related neuritic plaque density (Mirra, 1991): a subject with a 
CERAD score B or C older than 75 years was considered as amyloid positive, a subject with a CERAD 
score of C and  age  of  50-75 years was considered as amyloid positive while those aged 50-75 years 
with a CERAD score of 0,A or B were considered to be amyloid-negative.  Such density was established 
at  the  region  of  maximum  involvement  of  different  brain  regions:  those  three  of  the  CERAD  criteria 
(middle frontal gyrus, superior and middle temporal gyri and inferior parietal lobe), hippocampus and 
other brain regions. 
The  onsite  neuropathologist  also  histopathologically  examined  brains  to  establish  if  AD,  DLB,  PD  or 
FTD  were  present  according  to  international  accepted  criteria  (i.e.  NIA  criteria  for  AD,  CERAD

according to Mirra, Braak and Braak criteria for NFT, McKeith criteria for DLB, Gelb criteria for PD, FTD 
according  to  Cairns  criteria).    Therefore,  the  respective  site  was  responsible  to  use  the  regions  and 
methods/protocols they need for establishing the diagnosis according to these guidelines.  
Objectives 
Primary objective: to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the visual assessment 
of regional tracer uptake in the florbetaben (18F) PET images compared to histological verification of 
the presence or absence of cerebral beta-amyloid in the respective postmortem specimens. 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
To  determine  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the  composite  “whole  brain”  regional  visual 
assessment  (collapsed  from  the  regional  PET  visual  assessment  results)  in  detecting/excluding 
cerebral  β-amyloid  plaques  based  on  the  "whole  brain"  histopathological  verification  of  the 
presence/absence  of  β-amyloid  deposition  (collapsed  from  the  results  of  the  regional  histological 
findings  from  the  Pathology  Consensus  Panel).  To  determine  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the 
quantitative  assessment  of  regional  tracer  uptake  in  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images  compared  to 
histological  verification  of  the  presence  or  absence  of  cerebral  β-amyloid  in  the  respective 
postmortem specimens. 
To  determine  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the  visual  assessment  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET 
images  on  the  subject  level  in  detecting/excluding  cerebral  β-amyloid  compared  to  the  onsite 
neuropathological  diagnosis.  To  perform  an  exploratory  investigation  of  the  association  between 
the subject level visual assessment of florbetaben (18F) and fludeoxyglucose (18F) PET images for 
detecting  the  abnormalities  in  subjects  with  AD  compared  to  individuals  with  other  types  of 
dementia  and/or  without  cognitive  impairment.  The  on-site  clinical  diagnosis  (if  available)  served 
as the reference standard (in Japan only).

Outcomes/endpoints 
The  co-primary  efficacy  variables  were  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the  visual  assessment  of 
regional tracer uptake in the florbetaben (18F) PET images in correctly differentiating between brain 
regions  with  and  without  beta-amyloid  deposition.  The  90  to  110  minutes  imaging  window  and  the 
majority  read  of  the  visual  assessment  by  the  3  blinded  readers  were  used  to  determine  these 
variables over the 6 brain regions (of a particular subject). 
Secondary efficacy variables were related to the comparison with the SoT (individual reader sensitivity 
and  specificity  of  visual  regional  PET  scan  reading,  quantitative  PET  uptake  values  and  reader 
agreement) or with a SOR (various). 
Sample size 
Subjects would be followed until 30 histopathological specimens were to be recruited.  
Randomisation 
There was no randomized order to perform both recruitment and the imaging techniques.  PET images 
were randomized in the reading sessions. 
Blinding (masking) 
No blinding of florbetaben (18F) administration was performed. PET readers for visual reading, and the 
one  that  performed  quantitation,  were  blinded  to  post-mortem  histopathology  data  as  well  as  to  the 
clinical diagnosis of the patient.  The histopathology CP was blinded to both the clinical diagnosis and 
the PET scan result. 
Statistical methods 
This  analysis  was  based  on  the  first  available  32  histopathological  specimens.    However,  subjects 
recruited in the study and not deceased were to be followed up.

No  imputation  of  missing  data  was  planned  with  the  exception  of  the  rules  for  the  definition  of  the 
majority read results and other exceptions given in the SAP.   
Subjects  were  classified  as  NDV,  AD  subject,  DLB  subject,  other  dementia  subject,  HV,  or  unknown 
status,  based  on  the  onsite  clinical  diagnosis  at  study  entry.  This  classification  was  called  'subject 
group'. 
No interim analysis was planned. 
Analysis sets 
• 
Full  analysis  set  (FAS):  All  subjects  in  whom  any  PET  imaging  with  florbetaben  (18F)  was 
performed, with valid SoT for at least one brain region (within the particular subject), were included in 
the FAS. This analysis set also included the 10 HVs. 
• 
Per  protocol  set  (PPS):  All  subjects  belonging  to  the  FAS  were  evaluated  for  the  presence  of 
protocol  deviations  predefined  as  leading  to  non-evaluability  of  the  subject  for  the  primary  efficacy 
variable.  Such  predefined  protocol  deviations  could  include,  but  were  not  restricted  to  no  PET 
acquisition during the 90 to 110 minute imaging window. 
Primary efficacy analysis:  
The analysis of the primary efficacy variable was done for the PPS and FAS populations, with the PPS 
being considered the primary efficacy population. 
As  primary  analysis,  point  estimates  together  with  normal-approximated,  two  sided  95%  confidence 
intervals  (CIs)  were  given  for  sensitivity  and  specificity  in  beta-amyloid  detection  based  on  the 
majority read, derived from 3 individual assessments for regions (of a particular subject) where an SoT 
was available. 
Amendment 4 introduced the following hypotheses for testing sensitivity and specificity: 
H0,sens: sensitivity ≤ 0.6 vs. H1,sens: sensitivity > 0.6 
H0,spec: specificity ≤ 0.8 vs. H1,spec: specificity > 0.8 
H0,sens was to be rejected if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI is larger than 0.6. 
H0,spec was to be rejected if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI is larger than 0.8. 
Secondary efficacy analyses:  
Kappa coefficients were computed across all three readers and between each pair of readers. The same 
statistical methodology was used either when the subject (i.e. “whole brain”) was the observational 
unit but also when a brain region was the observational unit. 
For sensitivity and specificity of quantitative florbetaben (18F) PET assessments, ROC regions were 
used. 
Post-hoc analyses:  
After the originally planned analyses became available and the results were reviewed, the following 
additional post-hoc sensitivity analyses were conducted for the full analysis set.

A potential high variability in standardized uptake value (SUV) due to the use of different scanners was 
acknowledged.    In  the  pivotal  autopsy  study  several  standardization  measures  were  introduced  to 
attempt to control the most significant points causing such variability. 
The assessment of the autopsy samples for the CERAD score (which was used as SoT for the post-hoc 
analysis)  was  performed  according  to  the  CERAD  guidelines  (Mirra,  1991).  The  pathologists  were 
requested  to  look  for  amyloid  deposition  at  least  in  the  three  neocortical  regions  “Middle  frontal 
Gyrus“,”Superior  and  middle  temporal  gyrus”,  and  “inferior  parietal  lobule”.  In  addition,  also  the 
“Hippocampus” should be evaluated if needed.  As the onsite-pathologists were requested to perform a 
detailed  pathological  diagnosis,  additional  regions  of  the  brain  were  evaluated  as  part  of  their 
assessments for a final diagnosis. 
At the end of the procedure the company provided additionally the results of a re-reading study. 
This study included 82 autopsied patients from the pivotal autopsy study 14595 and 10 HVs considered 
amyloid-negative.    The  main  objective  was  to  assess  the  efficacy  (sensitivity  and  specificity)  of  the 
visual  assessment  method  proposed  for  clinical  practice  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scans,  by  five  new 
electronically trained readers (as it is intended to be used as part of the future training for users), in 
the detection of beta-amyloid neuritic plaques in the brain.    
Subject-level  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  of  those  82  autopsied  patients 
excluding  HVs,  using  as  SoT  the  presence  (moderate  or  frequent)  or  absence  (none  or  sparse)  of 
amyloid  neuritic  plaques  as  detected  by  BSS  and  scored  by  the  histopathology  consensus  panel 
according  to  the  CERAD  criteria  (except  for  the  total  regions  to  be  assessed),  was  a  secondary 
variable.   Assessed regions are displayed in the table below:  
If in any of the 6 regions neuritic beta-amyloid plaques were evaluated as being 'present' at a clinico-
pathologically  relevant  level  (either  moderate  or  frequent),  the  subject  was  determined  as  having 
clinico-pathologically  relevant  neuritic  beta-amyloid  deposition  in  the  brain.  If  in  none  of  the  regions 
the histopathological findings were assessed as being more than 'no' or 'sparse' neuritic beta-amyloid 
plaques, the subject was scored as 'no neuritic beta-amyloid present'. 
In  addition,  the  applicant  extended  the  post-hoc  analysis  from  n=74  brains  to  the  available  n=81 
brains.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Of  the  total  253  enrolled  subjects,  216  received  florbetaben  (18F).    The  brains  from  only  32  brains 
were  available  for  efficacy  analyses  at  the  original  protocol.  The  brain  from  1  of  the  remaining  32 
subjects  was  not  processed  properly  for  pathological  (SoT)  evaluation  (one  major  deviation).

Therefore,  31  subjects  who  died  were  included  in  the  efficacy  analyses  (with  clinical  diagnosis  of  AD 
(n=22), DLB (n=1), other dementia (n=2) and 6 non-demented patients) together with 10 young HVs. 
There  were  also  other  4  subject  with  major  and  174  subjects  with  minor  protocol  deviation.      All  10 
HVs included in the FAS seem to have systematically deviated from the protocol (minor deviation) and 
quantitative  measures  (i.e.  SUVs)  from  their  PET  images  on  the  regional-level  quantitative  analysis 
have not been obtained. 
The  company  has  performed  a  post-hoc  analysis  using  the  subject-level  visual  assessment  of  the  74 
PET images from subjects, for whom histopathology is available.  There were 57 subjects with probable 
AD, 9 subjects with other dementia (including 3 subjects with DLB) and 8 non-demented. There were no 
major protocol deviations. 
Recruitment 
No data provided. 
Recruitment was originally intended mainly by way of brain bank initiatives.  At amendment 2 (3-jun-
10), recruitment could be done from several sources, including brain bank initiatives, hospices, private 
practices, and dementia initiatives. 
Conduct of the study 
The study started at 25-nov-09 and ended at 15-sep-11. 
There were 5 amendments to the Original Protocol, dated 20 MAY 2009. 
The most significant changes to the protocol resulting from these amendments concerned recruitment, 
statistical analysis, objectives and treatments.   
The  analysis  was  based  on  the  first  available  32  histopathological  specimens.    However,  subjects 
recruited in the study and not deceased after these 32 histopathological specimens were available, are 
to  be  followed  up  for  a  maximum  of  3  years  (up  to  follow-up  visits)  after  entry  into  the  trial.  As  of 
August 1, 2013 the data base consisted of 74 brains.  
Baseline data 
Combining autopsied patients and HVs: 26 subjects (63.4%) were male. In addition, 26 subjects 
(63.4%) were white.  The mean age is 68.5 years.  
Numbers analysed 
All of 216 subjects receiving florbetaben (18F) were imaged at the time of enrollment. 212 evaluable 
PET  images  were  read  by  three  blinded-readers  in  December  2011.      32  died  and  underwent  brain 
autopsy at the original protocol; however, only 31 were considered evaluable for the standard-of-truth 
assessment.  This sample was further enriched with 10 HV for whom a florbetaben (18F) PET scan was 
available and whose SoT was considered β-amyloid negative by definition. 
The  company  has  performed  a  post-hoc  analysis  using  the  subject-level  visual  assessment  of  the  74 
PET images from subjects, for whom histopathology is available.  Baseline florbetaben (18F) PET scan 
which  resulted  to  be  performed  329  days  (+/- 272  days;  range  75-972  days)  before  death.        There 
were 15 subjects in whom florbetaben (18F) PET scan were repeated before death.   
Outcomes and estimation 
The final neuropathological diagnosis of all 31 subjects included in the FAS has been provided.  There 
were 16 AD patients, 2 with DLB patients, 1 PD patient, 10 with other dementias and 2 normal.   
In the post-hoc analysis, altogether 51 subjects had AD neurodegenerative pathology and 23 had non-
AD  neurodegenerative  pathology  as  final  diagnosis  confirmed  histopathologically  by  the  onsite- 
pathologists.  These non-AD subjects presented with Parkinson’s disease (n=1), hippocampal sclerosis 
dementia  (n=2),  frontotemporal  lobar  dementia  (n=2)  or  multi-system  neuronal  and  glial  tauopathy 
(n=1)  or  Pick’s  disease  (n=1),  cerebral  amyloid  angiopathy  (n=1),  mild  age-related  neurofibrillary 
degeneration  (n=1),  Lewy  body  disease  (n=3),  infarcts  (n=4),  motor  neuron  disease  (n=2),  senile 
dementia (n=2) and progressive supranuclear palsy (n=1).

PRIMARY EFFICACY ANALYSIS 
The sensitivity and specificity of the majority read of the visual assessment of regional tracer uptake in 
the  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images, in  correctly  differentiating  between  brain regions  with and  without 
β-amyloid deposition, was 77.4% (95% CI: 65.4% – 89.4%) and 94.2% (95% CI: 88.6% – 99.8%), 
respectively, for a total of 244 regions analysed.  The success criteria for the co-primary endpoints of 
the  study  were  to  show  that  sensitivity  was  higher  than  the  pre-specified  threshold  of  60%  and  that 
specificity  was  higher  than  the  pre-specified  threshold  of  80%.  As  both  thresholds  were  exceeded  by 
the  lower  bounds  of  the  respective  95%  CIs,  the  co-primary  endpoints  (eg,  goal)  of  the  study  were 
met. 
The results for each of the 6 brain regions of interest, as well as the total, and for each of the single 
blinded readers, as well as the majority read, can be found in Table 9-1.  There were 8 false-positive 
cases, and also 24 false-negative cases (13 out of the 24 resulted from regions 3 (hippocampus) and 6 
(cerebellum)).

SECONDARY EFFICACY ANALYSES 
1. Secondary efficacy variables related to the comparison with the SoT were: 
a)  Individual  reader  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  brain  uptake  of  florbetaben  (18F)  regarding  the 
visual  assessment  results  of  PET  images  over  the  6  brain  regions  based  on  each  single  blinded 
reader (table 9-1 above) 
b)  Quantitative parameters SUV and SUVR for each of the 6 brain regions defined 
The  SUVRs  provided  a  good  differentiation  between  positive  and  negative  brain  regions  for 
Regions  1  (frontal),  2  (occipital  cortex),  4  (anterior  cingulate),  and  5  (posterior 
cingulate/precuneus).  The  region  that  gave  the  best  differentiation  in  terms  of  highest  Youden 
Index (1.77) was Region 5 (posterior cingulate/precuneus). With an SUVR threshold of 1.171, this 
gave  a  sensitivity  of  77%  and  a  specificity  of  100%  (see  Table  9-2).    In  line  with  the  visual 
assessment  results,  with  an  SUVR  threshold  of  0.932  providing  a  sensitivity  of  67%  and  a 
specificity of only 60%, the region that provided little to no differentiation also in terms of lowest 
Youden Index (1.27) was Region 3 (hippocampus). 
c)  Agreement  of  blinded  readers:  Substantial  agreement  (kappa=0.658)  was  observed  across  all 
readers, with similar values for each reader pair. 
1.  The following secondary efficacy variables were related to a SoR: 
a)  Composite “whole brain” sensitivity and specificity (for the majority read and for each reader) of the 
regional visual assessment based on the composite “whole brain” regional histopathological findings 
(derived  from  SOT):  The  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the  whole  brain  regional  assessment 
compared to the SoR were 86.96% (95% CI: 73.19 – 100.00%) and 88.89% (95% CI: 74.37% – 
100.00%), respectively, for the majority read. 
b)  Subject  level  sensitivity  and  specificity  (for  the  majority  read  and  for  each  reader)  of  the  visual 
assessment  of  baseline  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images  (according  to  the  RCTU/BAPL  scoring)  as 
compared to the onsite neuropathological diagnosis of amyloid-present/amyloid-absent according to 
the CERAD criteria:  
a.  The sensitivity and specificity of the subject level visual assessments compared to the ‘on-
site’  SoR  were  100%  (95%  CI:  80.5  –  100%)  and  85.7%  (95%  CI:  67.4%  –  100%), 
respectively,  for  the  majority  read  of  the  first  31  patients  who  died  excluding  HVs.  
Considering  also  the  10  HVs,  17  patients  were  classified  as  beta-amyloid  while  there  was 
no  beta-amyloid  in  24  cases.    No  false-negative  and  2  false-positive  cases  existed  (in  a 
patient  with  focal  atrophy  and  a  patient  with  moderate  amounts  of  neuritic  plaques  and 
frequent diffuse amyloid plaques).   
b.  In the post-hoc analysis of 74 patients who died, excluding the 10 HVs, the sensitivity and 
specificity  was  as  shown  in  table  5.    47  patients  were  classified  as  beta-amyloid  present 
while there was no beta-amyloid in 27 cases.  For the majority read, 1 false-negative and 3 
false-positive cases existed (1 case of progressive supranuclear palsy, 1 with infarct and 1 
with Dementia with Lewy bodies).

c)  Agreement of blinded readers, both based on the composite “whole brain” visual assessment and on 
the  subject  level  (RCTU  /  BAPL)  assessment:  Across  all  3  readers,  substantial  agreement 
(kappa=0.764) was achieved for the “whole brain” visual assessment, with similar values for each 
reader pair.  Across all 3 readers, almost perfect agreement (kappa=0.870) was achieved for reads 
based on subject level, with similar values for each reader pair.

Design 
It was designed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the visual 
assessment of regional tracer uptake in the florbetaben (18F) PET images 
compared to histological verification of the presence or absence of cerebral β-
amyloid in the respective postmortem specimens as the standard of truth 
(SoT).

subjects, 31 other dementia 
subjects, 5 DLB subjects and 
32 NDVs.  Those who were 
willing to donate their brain 
after death and undergo both 
a PET and an MRI scan were 
eligible. The sample was 
enriched with 11 HVs. 
The co-primary endpoints of the study were the sensitivity and specificity of 
the visual assessment of regional tracer uptake in the florbetaben (18F) PET 
images in correctly differentiating between brain regions with and without β-
amyloid deposition. 
All  those  recruited  patients  until  at  least  30  histological  specimens  were 
available. 
Results and Analysis  
Primary Analysis 
From 216 subjects who were treated with florbetaben (18F), those 31 who provided 
an  evaluable  brain  specimen  (with  clinical  diagnosis  as  probable  22  AD  subjects,  1 
DLB subject, 2 other dementia subjects, and 6 NDVs) and 10 HVs, were included in 
the  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  and  the  per  protocol  set  (PPS)  that  were  identical  for 
efficacy analysis  
Statistical analysis: The co-primary efficacy variables of the study were evaluated 
using the majority results of the 3 independent blinded readers. The 95% confidence 
intervals were calculated taking within brain dependencies into account using normal 
approximation.

Participant flow:  
A total of 253 subjects were screened for the study. The study included 218 subjects 
that were assigned to receive treatment. The primary objective of this study required 
postmortem  brain  specimens.  A  total  of  34  subjects  died,  only  32  brains  were 
available for efficacy analyses, and the brain from 1 of the remaining 32 subjects was 
not  processed  properly  for  pathological  evaluation.  Therefore,  31  subjects  who  died 
were  included  in  the  analyses.  An  additional  sample  of  10  HV  were  included  in  the 
study. 
There were some protocol deviations. 
Co-primary Endpoint 
(Sensitivity and specificity) 
The sensitivity and specificity of the visual assessment 
of regional tracer uptake in the florbetaben (18F) PET 
images, in correctly differentiating between brain 
regions with and without β-amyloid deposition for the 6 
brain regions of interest, for the majority read was 
77.4% (95% CI: 65.4% – 89.4%) and 94.2% (95% 
CI: 88.6% – 99.8%), respectively.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
The  company  presents  pooled  analyses  of  efficacy  of  the  studies  composing  the  florbetaben  (18F) 
clinical development program.  No meta-analysis was presented. 
Data were generated on the basis of two originally planned subsets of studies, Pool 1 and Pool 2.  
Pool 1 included one Phase 1 study, Study 312161 (91794) and the two Phase 2 studies: Study 14311 
and  Study  311741  (91708)  Part  A  and  Part  B.    Pool  1  evaluated  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the 
visual assessment of florbetaben (18F) PET scan results from the various studies in which independent 
blinded reads were performed.  The studies included in Pool 1 utilized both a different blinded reader 
training  and  visual  assessment  methodology  than  is  currently  proposed  for  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  in 
clinical  practice.    Furthermore,  the  SoRs/SoT  differed  among  studies  in  Pool  1,  in  that  the 
determination  of  sensitivity  and  specificity  in  the  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  studies  were  based  on  the 
clinical  diagnosis  of  either  AD  vs  HV,  or  of  Down  syndrome  (DS)  vs  HV,  whereas  the  histopathology 
was  the  SoT  for  the  pivotal  Phase  3  study.  Thus,  pooling  such  data  is  not  justified  from  a  scientific 
point of view. 
Pool  2  includes  three  Phase  1  studies:  Study  311722  (91707),  Study  91790,  and  Study  312161 
(91794);  and  the  two  Phase  2  studies:  Study  14311  and  Study  311741  (91708)  Part  A,  and  Part  B.  
The  integrated  efficacy  analysis  Pool  2  provides  descriptive  statistics  related  to  regions  of  interest 
(ROI)-based  Standardized  Uptake  Value  Ratios  (SUVRs)  across  the  various  subject  groups  (using  the 
cerebellar cortex as reference region) and generated upon application of an MRI-segmented template.  
Of  the  total  560  subjects  in  the  Pool  2  integrated  analysis  FAS,  316  were  NDVs  (70  subjects  <  55 
years; 246 subjects ≥ 55 years) and 244 were AD subjects.  A good differentiation between subjects 
with AD and HVs could be verified on the basis of the results of the pooled analysis of regional SUVRs 
across studies.  The 5 key cortical regions provided excellent differentiation between NDVs and ADs.  
Standard uptake values (SUV) was determined for subpopulations and presented by age, geographical 
region, gender and race.  Data on subpopulations focused on the key cortical brain regions (the frontal 
cortex, the lateral temporal cortex, the parietal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex and the posterior  
cingulate  cortex)  which  showed  increasing  SUVR  arithmetic  means.    A  trend  to  higher  SUVR  with 
increasing age was observed.  No difference in SUVR means between males and females was observed 
in either NDVs or AD subjects.  There was no observed difference in SUVR means between Caucasian 
and  Black  NDVs    <  55  years  in  any  of  the  key  cortical  gray  matter  regions,  however  there  were  few

Black    NDVs  <  55  (n  =  11)restricting  the  reliability  and  predictability  for  this  subpopulation.    In 
general,  there  was  good  differentiation  between  NDVs  ≥  55  years  and  AD  subjects  across  Australia, 
Europe, Japan, and the USA. Across all geographic regions, subjects had higher SUVR values in the AD 
subjects than in the NDVs in cortical gray matter regions. NDVs ≥ 55 years in Japan had slightly lower 
SUVRs  than  the  NDVs  ≥  55  years  in  the  other  geographic  regions,  for  both  the  arithmetic  and 
geometric means.  
For  the  two  groups  (NDV  and  AD)  and  for  each  ROI,  separate  models  using  the  variables  study  and 
age have been used.  From the analysis of covariance, it could be concluded that the mean values for 
the different  ROIs are different  between the studies (separately  for NDVs and AD subjects), and that 
the influence of the factor age is similar in all studies included in this analysis.  
The  pooled  analysis  of  all  Phase  I  –  III  data  included  406  AD  patients  and  291  non-demented 
volunteers  (≥  55  years).  In  the  group  of  AD  patients,  8%  had  normal  renal  function;  35%  had  mild 
renal  impairment,  19%  moderate  renal  impairment  and  1%  had  severe  renal  impairment  (missing 
data:  38%).  The  respective  percentages  in  the  group  of  non-demented  volunteers  were  24%,  51%, 
14% and < 1%, respectively (missing data: 11%). The pooled analysis of subjects showed no relevant 
effect of renal function on the safety of florbetaben. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in special populations were conducted.  With respect to subpopulation factors such as age, 
geographical region, gender and race see section analysis performed across trials below.  The use of 
florbetaben (18F) in children cannot be recommended, and it is not expected. 
Influence of renal impaired function on safety and efficacy was evaluated as part of a pooled analysis 
of Phase II clinical data (study 311741 Part A and Part B). In summary, reductions in renal function 
were inherent in the target study population and did not influence the safety and efficacy of 
florbetaben. Dose adjustments in patients with renal impairment are not necessary. 
• 
In  study  311741  Part  A, 32%  of  AD  patients  (54%  of  healthy  control  volunteers)  had  normal 
renal function (CrCl ≥  90 mL/min) at baseline. 62% of AD patients (41% of HV) had mild renal 
impairment  (CrCl  60-89  mL/min),  6%  of  AD  patients  (6%  of  HV)  had  moderate  renal 
impairment (CrCl 30-59 mL/min). Subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-29 mL/min) 
were  not  included  in  that  study.  As  expected,  renal  function  decreased  with  age  both  in  AD 
patients and healthy control volunteers. In addition, baseline creatinine clearance was found to 
be lower in Alzheimer patients (n=81) compared to the healthy volunteer control group (n=69) 
(mean  ±  SD:  72.2  ±  15.8  mL/min  vs.  81.9  ±  22.2  mL/min,  p<0.01).  The  difference  was 
consistently seen across all age groups.  CrCl did not show a relevant influence on the efficacy 
of florbetaben.  
•  Similar results were found in study 311741 Part B (including 28% of AD patients with normal 
renal  function  and  47/  21/  3%  of  patients  with  mild/  moderate/  severe  renal  impairment, 
respectively). 
For the results in the pooled analysis see section above.

Supportive study(ies)  
Study 14311 
This was an open-label, non-randomised and non-controlled phase 2 study. 
During the florbetaben (18F) PET imaging day, 39 individuals with DS (≥40 years) and 70 young HVs 
(≥21 and 40 years) received a single IV injection of 300 MBq of florbetaben (18F) with mass dose ≤50 
micrograms.    The  mean  ages  of  the  DS  subjects  and  HVs  were  46.3  years  and  27.7  years, 
respectively. The majority of subjects in the study were Caucasian. A total of 21 (53.8%) males and 18 
(46.2%) females were in the DS group and 28 (40%) males and 42 (60.0%) females were in the HV 
group.  
PET  scanning  was  performed  from  100-120  minutes  post  injection.    Images  were  assessed  for  the 
regional  presence  or  absence  of  tracer  uptake  as  part  of  an  independent  blinded  read.    PET  imaging 
interpretation (colour, image orientation, regions to be assessed, criteria to interprete regions and the 
whole brain) was similar to that used in part B of study 311741. 
The results of PET imaging with florbetaben (18F) were compared to the clinical diagnosis as the SoR. 
The  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  florbetaben  in  the  detection  of  β-amyloid  in  the  brains  of  the  DS 
subjects  when  compared  to  HVs  was  based  on  the  visual  assessment  of  the  BAPL  score  by  three 
blinded  readers.  The  BAPL  score  was  based  on  the  compilation  of  the  RCTB  score  of  the  4  brain 
regions,  ie,  frontal  cortex,  posterior  cingulate  cortex,  lateral  temporal  cortex,  and  parietal  cortex.  An 
abnormal scan in a DS subject was a match for sensitivity and a normal scan in an HV subject was a 
match for specificity.   
Sensitivity  of  the  visual  assessment  of  the  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images  in  detecting/excluding 
cerebral  beta-amyloid  in  individuals  with  DS  compared  to  HVs,  based  on  the  majority  read  of  visual 
assessment of the BAPL score by three blinded readers, was lower than expected with 46.2% (95%CI: 
30.1-62.8%). The estimated reader sensitivity was lowest for reader 2 (23.1%; 95%CI: 11.1-39.3%) 
when compared to that of reader 2 (56.4%; 95%CI: 39.6-72.2%) and reader 3 (51.3%; 95%CI: 34.8-
67.6%).    Subsequent  subanalysis  revealed  a  trend  towards  higher  sensitivity  values  in  subjects  >46 
yrs (the median age): 72.2% with 38.9% for reader 1 and 88.9% and 77.8% for readers 2 and 3.  In a 
post-hoc  analysis,  the  sensitivity  for  the  10  subjects  ≥  50  yrs  of  age  was  90%  with  the  individual 
reader sensitivities of 60% (reader 1), 100% (reader 2) and 90% (reader 3). 
In the HVs, the majority read specificity was 100% and the individual reader specificity estimates were 
100%  (95%CI:  94.9-100%)  for  reader  1,  97.1%  (95%CI:  90.1-99.7%)  for  reader  2,  and  94.3% 
(95%CI: 86-98.4%) for reader 3. 
The inter-reader agreement was 80.7% (kappa of 0.55) in the DS and HV combined. 
For  DS  with  visually  abnormal  scans,  the  mean  SUVR  for  the  frontal  cortex  for  example,  was  1.396 
compared  to  1.146  in  the  HVs.    Upon  linear  regression  analysis,  in  subjects  with  DS,  a  significant 
(p<0.0001) correlation between SUVRs (for all regions) with age was verified.   
Study 311741 
This was a multi-center, open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 study.    
It  was  primarily  aimed  to  determine  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the  independent  visual 
assessment  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images  (from  the  90  to  110  min  imaging  window)  in 
detecting/excluding  cerebral  beta-amyloid  in  patients  with  probable  AD  compared  to  HVs.    Although 
the  primary  objective  of  Parts  A  and  B  were  identical,  the  method  by  which  the  diagnosis  was 
established differed.  It was clinical diagnosis by the onsite investigator (in part A) and an independent 
consensus panel (CP) of 3 experts in dementia (in part B).

Participants were age-matched HVs and patients diagnosed with pAD and mild-moderate dementia. 
Part A: 146 subjects (78 AD patients, 68 HVs) were included in the PPS 
Part B: 257 subjects (139 AD patients, 118 HVs) were included in PPS. 
During the florbetaben (18F) PET imaging day, all subjects received a single IV injection of 300 ± 20% 
MBq per injection with ≤5 μg/injection (part A) or ≤50 μg/injection (part B). Scanning was performed 
in  5-min  frames  at  45-60  min,  90-110  min,  and  110-130  min  p.i.        Quantitative  assessment  of  the 
images was also performed by an independent nuclear medicine expert. 
Blinded visual reading was performed on rainbow colour scale. They were 8 regions (frontal, posterior 
cingulate, lateral temporal, parietal, occipital, caudate nucleus, mesial temporal and anterior cingulate 
cortex) assessed in the transaxial orientation.  Only the last four regions were not included in the BAPL 
rule.  Each of the 3 blinded readers visually scored each region to obtain a RCTB as follows: 
The blinder reader had to classify brain BAPL on the basis of RCTL score. 
In  Part  A  of  this  study,  two  BAPL  algorithms  (algorithm  A  and  algorithm  B)  for  assessing  the 
normality/abnormality of beta-amyloid plaque load in the brain scans were used (figure 1-3). 
The initial analysis of the primary efficacy variable was performed using algorithm A and the sensitivity 
and  specificity  calculated  using  the  average  blinded  reader  approach;  the  post  hoc  analysis  of  the 
primary efficacy variable was performed using algorithm B with efficacy calculated using the majority 
read approach. 
In Part B, the same RCTB and BAPL scoring procedures were done but only using the algorithm B.

Using algorithm B and the majority reader approach a sensitivity of 79.5% (CI: 68.8% to 87.8%) and 
a specificity of 91.2% (CI: 81.8% to 96.7%) was obtained at 90-110 min p.i.  At 45-60 min p.i. values 
were 80.8% and 89.7%, respectively.  For the 110-130 min p.i.,78.2% and 89.7%, respectively. 
Part B 
The majority blinded reader sensitivity of 67.2% (95% CI: 57.9% to 75.7%) and a specificity of 96.6% 
(95%  CI:    91.6%  to  99.1%)  in  detecting/excluding  cerebral  beta-amyloid  plaque  load  in  the  brain  in 
patients  with  AD  (as  assessed  by  the  CP)  compared  to  HVs  based  on  the  independent  visual 
assessment of the florbetaben (18F) PET using BAPL algorithm B for imaging window 90-110 min p.i.. 
As  only  the  success  criterion  of  specificity  (i.e.  statistically  was  greater  than  75%)  was  met,  but  not 
that for sensitivity (i.e. sensitivity was statistically not significantly greater than 75%) the study could 
not  be  considered  successful.    At  45-60  min  p.i.,  sensitivity  and  specificity  for  the  majority  read  was 
71.6% and 94.1% respectively. They were 73% and 96.6%, respectively, for the 110-130 min p.i. 
The single blinded reader results for sensitivity were 71.55% for both BR 1 and BR 3 and 62.93% for 
BR 2. The results for specificity were 94.92% for BR1 and BR 3 and 97.46% for BR 2. 
The inter-reader agreement across all 5 readers was 0.864.

Although  no  direct  groupwise  significance  testing  was  performed,  several  methods  were  explored  to 
determine  the  discriminative  value  of  tracer  uptake  (as  reflected  by  the  SUVR)  in  the  various  brain 
VOIs. 
Regional brain SUVRs were considerably higher in patients with AD compared to HVs in all gray matter 
regions,  particularly  in  the  frontal,  temporal,  parietal,  occipital,  anterior  and  posterior  cingulate 
cortices.  
No  camera  effect  was  significant  for  SUV,  and  a  potential  relevant  effect  could  not  be  excluded  for 
SUVR.    In  part  B,  several  camera  effects  were  significant  for  SUV  data  and  no  camera  effect  was 
significant for SUVRs. 
For  analysis  of  the  effects  of  CrCl  on  quantitative  assessment  results,  a  significant  linear  relationship 
(ie, slope) between CrCl and posterior cingulate SUVR could not be identified in part A, neither in AD 
patients (p-value: 0.7372) nor in HVs (p-value: 0.2825).  In part B, data did not indicate that within 
patients with AD or with HV there was a difference in CrCl those with negative versus (vs) those with 
positive scans (assessed by majority read for the 90 to 110 min p.i. imaging window).  
Study 312043 
This  was  a  single-center,  open-label,  non-randomised,  phase  1  study  to  investigate  whether  BAY  94-
9172 PET has any ability to distinguish subjects with MCI progressing to AD from those with MCI not 
progressing to AD.  A total of 45 subjects with MCI ≥ 60 yrs were included. 
Baseline clinical, MRI and florbetaben (18F) PET scan were performed. Clinical assessment was 
repeated at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months and neuropsychology tests were repeated at 6, 12 and 24 
months. MRI and PET scan was repeated at 12 and 24 months.   The classification at two years was 
performed by a neurologist blind to the florbetaben PET scan results and hippocampal volumes but with 
access to MRI images and cognitive test scores. Clinical diagnosis of probable AD was made according to

the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann 1984). Diagnoses for non-AD dementia were consistent with 
published criteria (Hauw 1994, Neary 1998, McKeith 1996).  
All subjects received an i.v. dose of total activity amounting to 300 MBq (8.1 mCi) ± 20% (of no more 
than  5  μg).    Blinded  visual  assessment  of  PET  images  were  performed  in  rainbow  color  scale,  using 
RCTB  score  and  BAPL  score  were  to  those  in  part  B  of  study  311741.    BAPL  score  was  assessed  for 
each  of  the  two  imaging  time  windows  (45-60  and  90-110  min  p.i.).    Quantitative  assessment  was 
performed  for  the  images  acquired  from  90-110  min  p.i.  from  17  brain  regions,  similarly  as  in  the 
pivotal study.   
A total of 45 subjects (63.4%) were treated at least once and were part of the full analysis set (FAS).  
A total of 36 (50.7%) subjects completed the study. Majority of subjects were Caucasian (95.6%) and 
almost two-thirds were male (64.4%).  Mean baseline age was 72.7±6.5 yrs. 
The primary variable used to assess efficacy was the cortical SUVR.  At all time points the neocortical 
SUVR was higher in subjects who progressed to AD than in subjects who did not progress to AD.  In 
the FAS, the neocortical SUVR (as a measure of florbetaben (18F) binding) was higher in subjects who 
progressed to AD (baseline: 1.726 ±  0.227,  12 months: 1.738 ± 0.236, 24 months: 1.796 ±  0.296) 
than in subjects who did not progress to AD (baseline: 1.430 ± 0.252, 12 months: 1.442 ± 0.270, 24 
months: 1.439± 0.219) at all time points. Based on a Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test (baseline p-value: 
0.0001,  12  months  p-value:0.0011,  24  months  p-value:  0.0008)  and  on  a  t-test  (baseline  p-value: 
0.0002,  12  months  p-value:  0.0008,  24  months  p-value:  0.0002),  there  was  a  notable  difference 
between  the  neocortical  SUVR  in  subjects  who  progressed  to  AD  compared  to  those  who  did  not 
progress.  
Regarding visual assessment of PET image data, a BAPL score was assessed for each imaging window. 
The number and percentage of normal and abnormal scans based on the BAPL score by subject group, 
time point and imaging window is given Text Table 9-12 (FAS).

Study 16034 
This  non-interventional  “study  was  performed  primarily  to  assess  the  inter-reader  agreement  of  the 
visual assessment results of florbetaben (18F) PET scans pooled from various florbetaben (18F) clinical 
studies after training new readers via a computer (web)-based training tool. 
A total of 507 images, which include 461 subject images plus 46 (10%) repeat images for a re-read, 
were selected from the images provided in four Phase 1 studies, the Phase 2 Study 311741 Part B, and 
the  pivotal  Phase  3  Study  14595.  These  PET  scan  images  were  pooled,  and  randomly  assigned  for 
consecutive,  blinded  visual  assessment  by  5  independent  readers.  To  reflect  the  future  study 
population, the pooled images included cases with various forms of clinically diagnosed dementia such 
as  probable/possible  mild  to  moderate  AD,  FTLD,  VaD,  and  DLB  as  well  as  cases  from  clinically  non-
demented subjects, eg, MCI, young (< 40 years) and elderly (> 55 years) cognitively normal HVs, as 
well  as  from  subjects  from  the  Phase  3  histopathology  study.  The  latter  one  included  54  subjects 
(including  clinically  demented  and  non-demented  subjects)  who  died  and  were  autopsied  by  19  MAY 
2012,  and  had  an  evaluable  PET  scan.  The  data  were  enriched  with  scans  from  10  young  HVs  who 
served as negative controls (without autopsy).

The primary endpoint was inter-reader agreement, to be measured on a binomial scale on the subject 
level using kappa-values across all 5 blinded readers according to Fleiss.  The hypothesis that had to 
be tested is H 0, inter: κinter ≤ 0.6 vs. H 1, inter: κinter > 0.6.  Inter-individual kappa value for all 10 
reader  pairs and the determination of the intra-individual kappa values as coprimary endpoint, based 
on the re-reads separately for all 5 blinded readers, were assessed.  
The  applicant  also  assessed  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  in  detecting  the 
presence/absence of β-amyloid deposition in the following sub-populations: 
d)  The PET scans of subjects in the Phase 3 Study 14595 for whom a histopathological specimen was 
available were assessed using the respective histopathological findings as the SoT. This SOT used 
for establishing sensitivity and specificity of subject-level visual florbetaben (18) PET assessement 
in the autopsy subpopulation in study 16034 (54 subjects) importantly differs from the SOT  for 
similar assessment in the autopsy study 14595  (original data and post-hoc analysis).  The SOT 
does not match the CERAD criteria (Mirra et al. 1991).  It was constructed by using the consensus 
histopathology panel assessments of the six brain regions for every subject included in this analysis.  
A brain region was considered to have ‘relevant beta-amyloid present’, if the CP of neuropathology 
experts judged it as having a final rating of “moderate” or “frequent” for neuritic or diffuse beta- 
amyloid plaques based on the Bielschowsky silver staining. If in any of the 6 regions beta-amyloid 
plaques were evaluated as being 'present' at a clinico-pathologically relevant level (either moderate 
or frequent), the subject was determined as having clinicopathologically relevant beta-amyloid 
deposition in the brain on a subject-level. 
The company currently presents additional data comparing the results of PET scan reading in study 
16034 with the onsite pathology CERAD assessment collected for all subjects (same as used for the 
post-hoc analysis) instead that the original SOT.

• 
The  combined  hypotheses  to  be  tested  were  rejected  if  the  lower  limits  of  the  95%  confidence 
intervals for sensitivity and specificity are higher than the thresholds of 0.6 and 0.7 respectively for 
at least 3 out of the 5 blinded readers. 
•  Sensitivity  and  specificity  was  assessed  with  the  CP  clinical  diagnosis  as  the  SoR  in  images  from 
Part B of the 311741 study, for each of the 5 blinded readers. Here, subjects with a CP confirmed 
clinical diagnosis of AD served as β-amyloid-positive, and CP confirmed cognitively normal HVs as 
negative controls. 
5 naive readers trained by an electronic based training program performed were to visually assess the 
RCTU score on a subject-basis as it was detailed in the pivotal study after amendment 4 (and which is 
proposed for clinical use and described in the SmPC) at a controlled central reading facility.   
The  inter-reader  agreement  of  visual  PET  scan  readings  yielded  a  value  of  0.787  (95%  CI:  0.750  – 
0.824) across all five readers, which exceeded the pre-specified kappa value threshold of 0.6 (for the 
lower  bound  of  the  two  sided  95%  CI).  The  inter-reader  agreement  was  high  in  all  reader  pairs,  the 
highest  being  0.865  (95%  CI:  0.819  –  0.911)  between  readers  1  and  3  and  the  lowest  was  0.677 
(95%  CI:  0.609  –  0.744)  between  readers  2  and  5.    The  highest  intra-individual  kappa  value  was  of 
0.957 (95% CI: 0.872 – 1.041) for reader 4 and the lowest being 0.823 (95% CI: 0.657 – 0.989) for 
reader 1. 
Inter-reader  reproducibility  from  the  autopsy  population  in  study  16034  was  0.69.    Intra-reader 
agreement in the autopsied population in study 16034 cannot be provided since only 4 patients were 
assessed for such objective. 
The  sensitivity  and  specificity  data  to  detect  β-amyloid  on  a  subject  level  with  histopathology  as  the 
SoT  using  PET  scan  images,  from  the  55  (only  54  were  included  in  the  read  since  one  was  not 
evaluable)  autopsy  cases  enriched  with  the  images  of  10  healthy  volunteers  from  Study  14595,  are

The sensitivity and specificity data to detect β-amyloid on a subject level with histopathology 
as  the  SoT  using  PET  scan  images  from  the  54  autopsy  cases  (excluding  images  of  the  healthy

The sensitivity and specificity data of florbetaben (18F) PET scans with the Consensus Panel clinical 
diagnosis as the Standard of Reference using the images from 236 subjects from Phase 2 Study 
311741 (Part B) ranged from approximately 69%-81% for the sensitivity, while the specificity was 
between 82% and 95% (table 9-5). 
The inter-reader agreement across all 5 readers in the histopathology subgroup was good with a kappa 
coefficient of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.54 – 0.83). In the MCI subgroup, the inter-reader agreement across all 
5 readers was very high with a kappa coefficient of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73 – 0.91).  In the subgroup of 
probable Ads and HVs recruited in study 311741 part B,  it was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77-0.86). 
1.6.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The company contends that the clinical efficacy of PET with florbetaben (18F) has been demonstrated 
by  the  findings  in  2  key  studies  (14595  and  16034),  supported  by  6  phase  1  (A42404,  310863, 
311722,  91790,  312161  and  312043),  2  phase  2  studies  (311741  and  14311)  and  pooled  analyses.  
The  phase  III  study  16034  which  does  not  recruit  patients  itself  cannot  be  considered  pivotal.  
Neuraceq

Therefore, there is only one pivotal study (i.e. 14595) to base this application, and then the points to 
consider for submitting a single pivotal study in support of marketing authorization should be followed 
(CPMP/EMA/2330/99). 
“Guideline  on  Clinical  Evaluation  of  Diagnostic  Agents” 
(CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev 1) and Appendix 1 on Imaging Agents (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/321180/2008) also 
applies. 
  The 
The proposed indication is as follows: 
“This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
Neuraceq  is  indicated  for  the  detection  of  β-amyloid  in  the  brain,  thereby  assisting  in  the  differential 
diagnosis  in  adult  patients  who  are  being  evaluated  for  Alzheimer’s  disease  and  other  causes  of 
cognitive decline.” 
The SmPC recommends a dose of 300 MBq of florbetaben (18F), not exceeding 360 MBq and not falling 
below  240  MBq  of  florbetaben  (18F),  administered  intravenously  as  a  slow  bolus  injection  (6  sec/ml) 
without dilution.  The administered volume is up to of 10 mL in order to provide the target activity of 
300 MBq.  The company originally intended that image acquisition was a 15-20 minute images from 45 
to 130 minutes postinjection. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Florbetaben (18F) is intended for registration for a pathological indication (i.e. with PET imaging for the 
detection of beta-amyloid in the brain).   
The  company  is  also  focusing  the  use  of  florbetaben  (18F)  for  a  concrete  diagnostic  paradigm  (i.e. 
assisting in the differential diagnosis in adult patients who are being evaluated for AD and other causes 
of cognitive decline).   
For the validation of florbetaben (18F) as an imaging PET agent, two stages have to be considered: 
a)  An  initial  phase  in  which  it  is  established  how  well  (the  relevant  types  of)  brain  β–amyloid 
deposition can be visualized and quantified by florbetaben (18F) in the relevant areas 
b)  Further  phase(s)  where  the  efforts  are  aimed  at  demonstrating  which  particular  practical 
purpose(s)  the  imaging is  useful  for and  how  this  is  achieved,  i.e.  for  a  particular  use  in  clinical 
practice.   
 PIVOTAL STUDY 14595  
Both phases were attempted in the pivotal study 14595 in which the visual detection of beta-amyloid 
in  the  brain on  PET  images  was  assessed  versus  histopathology  of  autopsied  samples  as  a  SOT.  This 
approach  using  autopsy  data  as  standard  or  truth  is  justified  as  it  can  demonstrate  that  the  results 
obtained  with  the  investigational  diagnostic  agent  are  valid  for  estimation  of  plaque  detection  (even 
though not for diagnosis of a particular disease). 
The  clinical  use  of  PET  with  florbetaben  (18F)  will  rely  on  its  accurate  quantitative  and  topographic 
assessment  of  beta  amyloid  accumulation  in  the  brain.    Then,  relevant  quantitative  correlation  in 
quantity and topography of PET images with autopsy specimens should be first demonstrated.  Study 
14595 did not quantify such correlation.  
The  clinical  value  of  the  estimation  (quantity  and  topography)  of  beta  amyloid  deposition  in  brain  is 
still a matter of discussion at the scientific community.  If any (i.e. for designation of a patient as beta 
amyloid  positive/negative  or  for  a  definitive  diagnosis/exclusion  of  a  specific  beta  amyloid  pathology) 
any  in  vivo  reliable  method  of  estimation  of  beta  amyloid  deposition  has  to  demonstrate  its 
sensitivity/specificity  for  the  particular  clinical  setting  and  population  in  which  it  is  intended.    In  this 
sense,  the  pivotal  study  14595  primarily  aimed  at  demonstrating  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the 
amyloid  burden  in  6  predefined  cerebral  regions  on  a  region-basis  on  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images 
after particular co-registration with MRI (evaluated by three blinded readers on a binary visual scale as 
normal/abnormal) versus the quantitative measurement of amyloid deposition at pathology.

A  secondary  analysis  of  the  pivotal  study  referred  to  the  composite  “whole  brain”  assessment  of  PET 
images  –  a  composite  of  the  6  pre-defined  regions  assessed  as  primary  analysis-  vs  histopathology.  
This was an attempt to evaluate the “whole brain” and not individual regions.   
Additionally,  a  so-called  “subject  level”  analysis  of  PET  images  without  co-registration  with  MRI  for 
estimation of beta-amyloid deposition was also performed (this is the PET reading method to be used 
in  clinical  practice).    The  pivotal  study  secondarily  assessed  sensitivity  and specificity  of subject-level 
visual  PET  reading,  for  classifying  a  patient  as  “beta-amyloid  present”  or  “beta-amyloid  absent”  by 
using the age-related neuritic plaque density of the CERAD criteria but including more regions than those 
assessed in the CERAD criteria.  This is stated in section 5.1. of the SmPC.   
The  company  a  post-hoc  analysis  for  the  subject-based  visual  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  assessment 
including all those subjects autopsied up to August 1st, 2013 (n=74). 
The  impact  on  diagnostic  thinking  or  on  patient  management  of  PET  with  florbetaben  (18F)  in  the 
intended population and clinical context was not assessed.  
Participants  underwent  a  MRI  prior  or  simultaneous  to  PET  to  allow  appropriate  anatomic  location  of 
the  PET  signal,  which  is  of  paramount  importance  in  patients  with  cerebral  atrophy  that  makes  PET 
image interpretation difficult.   
Inter-reader  variability  was  also  calculated.    Intra-reader  variability  was  designed  to  be 
assessed  in  only  10%  of  patients  which,  in  this  study,  is  a  very  small  sample  size  for  any 
conclusion to be solid.   
Subjects  in  the  confirmatory  trial  are  not  representative  of  the  population  in  whom  this 
diagnostic  agent  is  intended  to  be  used  in  routine  clinical  practice  (i.e.  “adult  patients  who  are 
being evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive decline”).  They were mainly adults willing 
to  donate  the  brain  and  undergoing  a  MRI  and  PET  scan.    Neither  a  particular  cognitive  status 
nor a probability of beta-amyloid deposition was mentioned among the inclusion criteria.  
The  clinical  diagnosis  of  dementia  subtype  (if  any)  in  the  recruited  patients  is  likely  inaccurate  as 
settled  only  on  the  basis  of  previous  clinical  history  and  an  optional  very  brief  neurological 
examination, without mandatorily performing other routine laboratory tests to exclude the presence of 
either  significant  white  matter  disease  or  other  non-neurodegenerative  dementias.    Moreover,  such 
dementia  status  referred  to  the  time  of  baseline  PET  imaging  and  it  might  have  changed  within  the 
time  interval  between  PET  and  autopsy.    Indeed,  subjects  recruited  from  brain  bank  initiatives  might 
have higher probability of familiar AD forms. 
The  choice  of  the  recruited  population  for  the  primary  analysis  has  an  impact  on  the  external 
validity. Although the diagnostic utility in the intended clinical population has to be established, 
a different population may be justifiable to be recruited if allow assessing the correlation of PET 
versus  histopathology  within  a  reasonable  timeframe.  In  the  case  of  florbetaben  (18F),  the 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria  without  a  predefined  life  expectancy  do  not  allow  to  conclude  if  autopsies 
were  conducted  in  a  reasonable  timeframe  after  the  screening  and  PET  scan.  However,  the  pivotal 
study was designed to repeat PET scan annually (not mandatory) and therefore the timeframe between 
PET and autopsy would be 12 months as the maximum.  
There  were  5  major  protocol  deviations  in  the  autopsy  study,  but  patients  were  excluded  from  the 
analysis and none in the post-hoc analysis.  And, for the 74 autopsied patients included in the post-hoc 
analysis  of  the  subject-level  visual  PET  assessment,  all  the  protocol  deviations  are  considered  minor 
and not affecting efficacy. 
None of the 3 visual PET scan reading methods (on a region level, a “whole brain composite”, and on a 
subject level) was previously optimized for in-vivo detection of brain beta amyloid deposition.

However, they were decided by a step-by-step refinement of the visual assessment methodology 
during the florbetaben development process.    
The  visual  PET  scan  reading  method  on  a  region  basis,  and  the  derived  composite  “whole  brain” 
method,  outlined  with  a  polygon  (thanks  to  the  corregistration  with  MRI)  the  brain  region  to  be 
assessed.  This is not expected to occur in clinical practice unless PET is mandatorily co-registered with 
a MRI of the patient before reading. 
The visual PET scan reading method on a subject basis, introduced by amendment 5, is closed to the 
one  proposed  in  the  latest  proposed  SmPC  for  clinical  practice.    It  is  on  a  subject-level  basis  and  in 
non-co-registered PET images.   It condensed a cortical tracer uptake score in 4 predefined regions in 
florbetaben (18F) PET scan (without corregistration with MRI) into a single 3-grade scoring system (no, 
moderate or pronounced tracer uptake) to assess beta-amyloid burden of the brain globally.  A global 
interpretation of the brain was achieved by using the highest score in one of the four brain regions to 
qualify the scan as without/minor/significant beta amyloid plaque load (the so-called BAPL score).  It is 
transformed  into  a  binary  outcome  as  “beta-amyloid  positive”  (for  scores  2  or  3)  or  “beta-amyloid 
negative”  (for  score  1)  to  calculate  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scan.        The 
company  acknowledges  that  the  differentiation  of  the  amount  of  PET  tracer  uptake  (and  thereby 
amyloid  deposition)  as  moderate  or  pronounced  has  no  marked  clinical  consequences  and  was 
intended for further checking of the disease progression. 
PET images were visually interpreted by independent blinded readers, who were in-person trained in 
the interpretation of such images.  
Quantitation of PET images was also performed.   
The SOT was a consensus opinion of 3 readers who had to take into account different forms of amyloid 
deposits  (diffuse,  neuritic,  vascular)  measured  by  either  BSS  or  IHC,  with  their  different  frequencies 
and their relative impact. Both BSS and IHC techniques can be considered well-accepted for evaluating 
and measuring beta amyloid deposition in the brain post-mortem.  However, the frequency score used 
for  measuring  the  different  amyloid  deposits  was  neither  previously  standardized  nor  validated.  The 
SOT also suffered from changes by protocol’s amendment and from adaptations during the conduct of 
the  study.  SOT  was  therefore  not  standard  for  all  patients,  and  has  not  been  justified  as  of  clinical 
relevance.  Anyway, the SOT refers to the regional-based visual assessment of florbetaben (18F) PET 
scan and not to the subject-level basis analysis which is the crucial issue for clinical practice.  
The applicant assures that the onsite neuropathologist assessed the autopsy samples evaluating 
presence/absence of neuritic amyloid plaques according to the CERAD criteria for subject-level 
sensitivity and specificity calculation in study 14595 (with n=31 subjects, in the analysis of one of 
secondary endpoints), and that the same method was then extended for the 74 subjects included in the 
post-hoc analysis.  However, although the applicant states that “Neuritic plaque density was 
determined according to CERAD criteria (Mirra, 1991)”, no further confirmation of the assessed regions 
was initially provided.  To this regard, the CERAD criteria used the neuritic plaque density in the most 
heavily affected neocortical region (based on section with the maximum involvement among middle 
frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule and superior and middle temporal gyri).   The applicant has 
recently clarified that neuritic plaque density was established at the region of maximum involvement 
of different brain regions: those three of the CERAD criteria (middle frontal gyrus, superior and middle 
temporal gyri and inferior parietal lobe), hippocampus and other brain regions. This was included in 
the SmPC.    
The  original  protocol  has  been  amended  five  times.  Amendments  4  and  5  were  the  more  important 
ones as they introduced changes in critical aspects of the trial. The timing of the amendments was also 
critical  because  were  approved  after  recruitment  was  initiated.  Moreover,  last  amendment  was 
introduced once recruitment had finished and the SoT results were obtained for all 31 collected brains.

The  changes  introduced  to  the  protocol  were  as  important  as  the  formulation  of  the  main  statistical 
hypotheses  for  the  co-primary  endpoints  of  sensitivity  and  specificity  as  well  as  the  definition  of  the 
majority  read  of  PET  images  (amendment  4).  Last  amendment  modified  the  secondary  objectives 
adding  a  “whole  brain  composite”  endpoint  and  deleting  the  subject  level  comparison  with  the  onsite 
clinical  diagnosis.  The  training  and  visual  scoring  procedure  for  florbetaben  (18F)  subject  level 
assessment  was  also  modified  changing  the  focus  of  the  visual  assessment  from  a  “whole  scan” 
assessment to regional anatomical assessment. These changes could have had a crucial impact on the 
whole trial result. 
Statistical  methods  in  the  SAP  were  also  changed  to  reflect  the  amendments  that  were  introduced.  
Originally  the  protocol  was  designed  to  estimate  sensitivity  and  specificity  rather  than  to  test  any 
hypothesis  around  these  endpoints.  Amendment  4  moved  from  this  estimative  aim  to  a  hypothesis 
testing approach, formulating the null hypotheses for the co-primary endpoints to be lower or equal to 
0.6  and  0.8  for  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the  regional  majority  read  respectively.  The  hypotheses 
were  rejected  if  lower  limits  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  were  larger  than  the  values  at  the  null 
hypothesis. 
The success criterion (the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval for sensitivity and 
specificity being greater than a priori threshold of 60% and 80%, respectively) seems little demanding 
and has not been justified as of clinical relevance.  Furthermore, in previous national scientific advice 
meetings held in 2011  between the applicant and Health Authorities in the  United Kingdom (UK) and 
Spain  it  was  discussed  that  the  main  usage  of  the  tracer  was  seen  to  be  ruling  out  rather  than 
verifying  AD.  In  such  a  scenario,  maximisation  of  sensitivity  rather  than  specificity  should  have  been 
used in the formulation of statistical hypothesis. 
As the company stated that there was a 3-year follow-up of the recruited patients not deceased after 
the first 32 histopathological autopsies, the CHMP requested at day 120 data obtained from all 
recruited patients that had already been autopsied by means of a well-designed re-reading study.  
Instead, the company currently presents a post-hoc analysis of sensitivity and specificity of the visual 
PET reading vs histopathology in all autopsied patients from the pivotal study until August 1st, 2013 
(n=74).  Since PET images of all 212 recruited participants were altogether read in a single session by 
similar blinded readers and were already available for all patients before autopsies, the post-hoc 
analysis might be an appropriate alternative to the requested re-reading of the images.   
However, it might have happened that, while the data used for the post-hoc analysis was that from 
the PET scan at entry (resulted to be performed 329 days (+/- 272 days; range 75-972 days) before 
death), the patient might have a later PET scan before autopsy since a yearly repeated florbetaben 
(18F) PET imaging up to the 3-year follow-up was offered to the participants (but not mandatorily).  
In fact, there were 15 subjects in whom florbetaben (18F) PET scan were repeated before death.  The 
applicant has not provided with their subject-basis result of the subsequent (second or third) 
florbetaben (18F) PET scans performed before autopsy.  Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the 
baseline PET scan and subsequent PET scans had no different results. The most valuable PET scan 
data to be compared with autopsy results are those of the closer PET scan result to death (which may 
differ about 400 days from the previous one).  However, the post-hoc analysis took advantage that 
initial baseline PET scan had already been read, and therefore reading of subsequent PET scans are 
not available. 
Despite  previous  advice  received  by  the  company  that  highly  recommended  a  patient-based  rather 
than  a  region-based  analysis  for  the  primary  analysis,  the  primary  endpoint  in  the  pivotal  study  is 
based  on  regional  reading  rather  than  subject-level  readings  of  PET  images  particularly  co-registered 
with  MRI.  This  selection  is  problematic  because  it  is  expected  to  observe  highly  correlated  reading 
patterns  of  regions  within  the  same  subject.    By  using  randomization  with  images  of  single  brain 
regions one at a time regardless which subject, instead of assessing the images of all brain regions of 
a subject as batch, the within-brain correlation effect was minimized.

The sample size for the study was calculated to demonstrate simultaneously a minimum sensitivity and 
specificity  in  a  per-region  analysis,  assuming  very  optimistic  initial  values  for  both  co-primary 
endpoints  (e.g.  sensitivity  and  specificity  equal  to  90%)  and  without  taking  into  account  within  brain 
correlations.  Data  from  previous  studies  could  have  well  informed  the  design  of  the  pivotal  study  by 
providing  estimates  of  within  brain  intra-class  correlations  to  aid  in  these  calculations.  Although  the 
study  has  reached  the  success  criteria  in  the  per-region  analysis,  the  sample  size  is  deemed 
insufficient to draw firm conclusions in a per-subject basis.  
The  study  included  10  HVs  to  enrich  the  sample  used  to  estimate  specificity.  It  has  been  empirically 
demonstrated that using HV to assess the accuracy of a test significantly overestimates the diagnostic 
performance  of  the  test.  Furthermore,  including  HVs  in  the  analysis  set  makes  the  population  to  be 
very  different  for  the  intended  to  use  population.  In  the  same  line,  the  study  also  has  included  one 
region that is assumed with known low probability of demonstrating significant β-amyloid deposition in 
an  AD  patient  (region  6,  Cerebellar  hemisphere  directly  adjacent  to  the  cerebellar  nuclei).  Including 
this region in the primary efficacy analysis could surely have positively biased specificity estimation.  
The  company  has  received  previous  advices  from  EMA  and  FDA  regarding  the  questionable  value  of 
including  HVs  in  their  confirmatory  Phase  3  trial.  EMA  critiqued  the  inclusion  of  young  HVs  in  the 
pivotal  study,  as  a  means  to  assure  recruitment  of  at  least  some  regions  negative  for  β-amyloid 
deposition,  since  the  study  results  may  be  biased  towards  high  specificity  for  detection  of  β-amyloid 
deposition. The company was also advised to only include HV as a form of sensitivity analysis being the 
primary analysis performed without HV individuals. The company performed an analysis excluding the 
HV  in  from  the  sample  and  the  results  of  this  post-hoc  analysis  confirmed  the  high  sensitivity  and 
specificity of the product.   
The  quantitative  correlation  between  in  vivo  quantitative  values  of  brain  uptake  of  florbetaben  (18F) 
and quantitative levels of amyloid deposition at autopsy has been neither calculated nor demonstrated. 
The approach used to this quantitative analysis of SUV was based on selecting optimal cut-off points to 
dichotomize  SUV  as  normal  and  abnormal  using  ROC  curves  and  summarize  the  results  using 
sensitivity and specificity accuracy indices, instead of using more comprehensive quantitative statistical 
methods to assess the correlation (i.e. multi-level mixed effects models).  This quantitative correlation 
could  have  been  easily  obtained  for  both  neuritic  plaques  and  also  diffuse  plaques  since  both  plaque 
types  were  visualized  and  counted  by  researchers  using  BSS.    In  addition,  researchers  using 
immunohistochemistry  measured  total  β-amyloid  using  anti-amyloid  antibody  that  stained  beta-
amyloid found in both neuritic and diffuse plaques and in vascular amyloid. 
Secondary  efficacy  analysis  assessing  the  agreement  of  blinded  readers  was  performed  using  kappa-
statistics. This approach is deemed correct when the subject (i.e. “whole brain”) was the observational 
unit.  However,  when  a  brain  region  was  the  observational  unit,  i.e.  where  one  subject  contributed 
more than one observational unit, the correlation between regions should be taken into account in the 
analysis.   By using randomization with images of single brain regions one at a time regardless which 
subject,  instead  of  assessing  the  images  of  all  brain  regions  of  a  subject  as  batch,  the  within-brain 
correlation effect was minimized.   
POOLED ANALYSES 
The  company  presents  pooled  analyses  of  the  studies  composing  the  florbetaben  (18F)  clinical 
development  programme,  as  supportive.    However,  these  analyses  involved  a  mixture  of 
populations,  different  SOTs/SORs,  different  PET  reader  training  methods,  different  number  of 
readers  and  different  primary  objectives.    Therefore,  the  pooled  analyses  do  not  provide  any 
additional accurate information of efficacy of PET with florbetaben (18F) to the efficacy results of 
the individual studies. 
When  assessing  the  quantitative  uptake  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scan  (SUVR)  in  non-demented 
volunteers aged < 55 years and ≥ 55 years and AD subjects, the pooled analysis has arisen a marked 
age  effect.    This  effect  could  have  a  decisive  impact  in  the  quantitative  analysis  of  the  SUVR 
Neuraceq 
EMA/5028/2014

(secondary outcome in the pivotal study 14595).  Such analysis should consider age as a confounder. 
This is critical when specificity is analysed in the pivotal study. Around half of the participants providing 
information to compute specificity were HV younger than 40 years. Unfortunately, a protocol violation 
occurred  in  all  this  HV  (protocol  violation  listing)  which  makes  impossible  to  know  the  quantitative 
results of these PET images.  
STUDY 14311 
Enrolled  subjects  in  this  supportive  study  do  neither  encompass  the  overall  anticipated  population  in 
which florbetaben (18F) will be performed nor even in whom the product is requested to be indicated.  
Indeed,  the  type  and  frequency  of  beta-amyloid  deposition  in  DS  might  be  different  from  that  in  the 
intended population.  The company studied DS individuals as a surrogate for the intended population 
(i.e.  AD  patients).    However,  it  is  unclear  if  both-amyloid  deposition  and  the  radiopharmaceutical 
behavior is similar in both entities.   As a construct to show that in other "plaque producing" conditions 
the  tracer  under  investigation also  labels  beta  amyloid  in  patients  without doing  so  in  matched 
controls,  DS  can  be considered  as  useful  supportive  evidence.    Its  value  for  estimation  the  clinical 
diagnostic performance in patients with potential AD appears limited. 
In  the  DS  group  aged  at  least  40,  and  considering  that  virtually  all  DS  individuals  develop  amyloid 
pathology over at that age, the expected sensitivity higher than 70% is little demanding.  
Study 311741 
The Company intends the role of florbetaben (18F) to assist in the differential diagnosis in adults who 
are being evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive decline.  There is very limited clinical data to 
address the issue coming from the supportive study 311741.   
This  study  was  primarily  aimed  to  evaluate  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  a  visual  interpretation  of 
florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images  (from  the  90  to  110  min  imaging  window  after  administration  of  300 
MBq)  in  detecting/excluding  cerebral  beta-amyloid  in  patients  with  probable  AD  compared  to  HVs 
versus the clinical diagnosis.   
Enrolled subjects in this supportive study do not encompass the overall anticipated population in which 
florbetaben  (18F)  were  recruited.  Indeed,  not  all  tests  standardized  for  management  of  patients 
suspected  of  AD  (e.g.  blood  tests,  …)  were  followed  to  confirm  the  absence  of  systemic  disorders  or 
other brain diseases that in and of themselves could account for the progressive cognitive impairment.  
Moreover, the clinical diagnosis is not an appropriate SoT to support claims for AD diagnosis due to its 
well-known  lack  of  diagnostic  performance.    For  all  these  reasons,  results  from  study  331741  cannot 
reliably  be  extrapolated  to  the  proposed  indication  for  use.  Furthermore,  the  study  was  designed  to 
include  HV  to  estimate  specificity.  It  has  been  empirically  demonstrated  that  diagnostic  accuracy 
studies  designed  to  include  HV  tend  to  overestimate  the  diagnostic  performance  of  the  test  being 
evaluated.  Thus,  these  case-control  studies  cannot  proportionate  reliable  estimations  of  the  accuracy 
indices. 
STUDY 312043 
The  company  presents  this  supportive  study  recruiting  exclusively  patients  with  MCI  of  non-obvious 
cause  based  on  predefined  criteria.    Definitive  conclusions  regarding  the  relative  progression  to  AD 
over a 2-year period of normal PET and abnormal PET populations of MCI might attempt to support a 
prognosis indication, which is not the intended use requested for florbetaben (18F) at the moment.   
Sensitivity and specificity of visual PET reading for detection of AD and the conversion rate to AD or to 
normal  were  assessed.    Inter-reader  and  intra-reader  reproducibility  for  the  visual  interpretation  of 
florbetaben (18F) PET were not assessed.   
STUDY 16034 
The  Applicant  has  chosen  the  electronic  training  programme  to  be  available  to  physicians  post-
approval.    The  clinical  development  of  florbetaben  (18F)  includes  this  phase  3  trial  attempting  to 
Neuraceq 
EMA/5028/2014 
Page 82/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
evaluate efficacy of florbetaben (18F) PET images after electronic training of PET readers.  No patients 
were  recruited  and  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  image  sets  were  selected  from  6  previous  florbetaben 
(18F)  clinical  trials  in  subjects  with  histopathological  confirmation  of  their  brain  amyloid  status,  HVs, 
subjects with clinically AD or other dementias and subjects with aMCI.   
The visual PET scan reading method used in this study is a subject level method (yielding a result of 
normal  or  abnormal  for  each  subject  after  assessing  5  pre-defined  regions)  and  the  Applicant  states 
that in general is identical to the one that is intended for clinical practice.     
The methodology of the pivotal study was changed in this study.  Primary endpoint of the pivotal study 
was relegated to a secondary one due to the small sample size (which was contrarily higher than in the 
pivotal  study).    The  SOT  was  also  changed  without  any  justification.    The  success  criterion  was 
asymmetric as in the pivotal study but less demanding (i.e. success criterion for specificity was to be 
higher than 70% instead than 80% as in the pivotal study).   
Validation of the electronic programme in study 16034 was attempted in this study combining different 
populations, using different statistical analyses and different reference/truth standards.  For this study, 
only  sensitivity  and  specificity  from  the  population  subgroup  matching  that  of  the  autopsy  study 
population (including 10 HVs), the pAD/HVs in study 311741 part B and the MCI subgroup from study 
312043, compared to the corresponding values in the actual studies, were taken into account.  For the 
overall  sample,  evaluation  of  sensitivity  and  specificity  mixing  different  populations  diagnosed  by 
different  SoTs  raise  concerns  about  potential  biases  of  the  results.    Indeed,  the  prevalence  of  beta-
amyloid  deposition  will  differ  among  different  populations.    For  reproducibility,  analyses  were  of 
interest for the whole sample, and the three mentioned population subgroups. 
The intra-reader agreement the population subgroup matching that of the autopsy study in the present 
study cannot be provided since only 4 patients were included for such objective in study 16034.   
The SOT used for establishing sensitivity and specificity of subject-level visual florbetaben (18) PET 
assessment in the autopsy subpopulation in study 16034 (54 subjects) importantly differs from the 
SOT  for similar assessment in the autopsy study 14595  (original data and post-hoc analysis).  The 
SOT does not match the CERAD criteria (Mirra et al. 1991).  It was constructed by using the consensus 
histopathology panel assessments of the six brain regions for every subject included in this analysis.  A 
brain region was considered to have ‘relevant beta-amyloid present’, if the CP of neuropathology 
experts judged it as having a final rating of “moderate” or “frequent” for neuritic or diffuse beta- 
amyloid plaques based on the Bielschowsky silver staining. If in any of the 6 regions beta-amyloid 
plaques were evaluated as being 'present' at a clinico-pathologically relevant level (either moderate or 
frequent), the subject was determined as having clinicopathologically relevant beta-amyloid deposition 
in the brain on a subject-level. 
The company currently presents additional data comparing the results of PET scan reading in study 
16034 with the onsite pathology assessment collected for all subjects (same as used for the post-hoc 
analysis).    
Other issues related to the clinical development programme 
Concerning interpretation of PET images, two distinct methods have been used during the development 
programme:  binary  visual  (on  a  region  level,  a “whole  body”  composite,  or on  a  subject  level)  and  a 
quantitative one. However, the applicant has not justified why the particular visual method of PET scan 
reading has been chosen for recommendation on the SmPC, and was chosen for the pivotal and some 
supportive studies, instead of the quantitative one which was also performed in most trials if not all.   
The  visual  reading  criteria  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scans  as  positive  or  negative  has  inherent 
difficulties and is a real challenge.  First of all it has the difficulty of reading PET images of the brain, 
and  secondly  the  difficulty  derived  from  the  intrinsic  characteristics  of  a  PET  amyloid  tracer.      The 
criterion for positivity in the visual method is looking at loss of reduction of radioactive signal intensity 
Neuraceq

invariably  high  uptake)  and  grey  matter  (with  either  no 
between  white  matter  (with 
radiopharmaceutical uptake (if normal) or some level of uptake (if abnormal)).  Traditional scanners in 
use  today  often  lack  the  fine  volumetric  resolution  and  high-contrast  ratio  required  to  precisely 
differentiate between grey and white matter.  Because grey and white matters are interlaced in such a 
compact  way,  and  also  due  to  the  short  width  of  the  grey  matter  (about  5  mm),  distinguishing  both 
can  be  challenging.    So  can  accurate  interpretation  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scans  based  on  visual 
assessment in cases where the uptake in grey matter is insufficient (as for example in borderline cases 
with insufficient intensity of amyloid deposition, or in cases with reduction of grey matter width as in 
brain atrophy).   
Statistics improve the accuracy of diagnosis beyond that attainable by a human observer who relies on 
a familiarity with image appearances in both health and disease.  The strength of this approach is that, 
no  a  priori  hypothesis  is  required  about  which  locations  may  be  affected  and  the  whole  volume  is 
automatically  analysed.    Comprehensive  packages  are  available  for  statistical  comparison  of  brain 
perfusion  SPECT.    The  differences  between  the  normal  database  and  the  test  subjects  are  expressed 
and, to help to interpret the differences, functional images are displayed.  They may allow for a single 
subject diagnosis. 
A methodology to distinguish white matter and grey matter in PET scans and to quantify the intensity 
of  amyloid  uptake  in  grey  matter  is  important  and  is  potentially  achievable  nowadays  in  clinical 
practice.    The  company  already  used  a  quantitative  PET  reading  methodology  in  the  clinical 
programme.    For  all  this,  the  company  should  develop  and  validate  a  quantitative  reading  PET 
methodology based on their product. 
Technical problems in the scan itself (noise or oversmoothing) or in brain anatomy (levels of atrophy) 
can  affect  the  anatomical  location  of  the  gray  matter/white  matter  border  and  are  important  to  be 
considered  in  the  interpretation  of  a  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scan.  MRI  or  CT  scans  may  be  helpful  for 
discerning  anatomy  in  cases  in  which  atrophy  or  a  low  quality  scan  complicate  the  PET-only  image 
interpretation. The CHMP highly encourage the use of a co-registered recent MRI image or CT scan for 
the  visual  interpretation  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scans,  particularly  in  those  cases  in  whom  there  is 
uncertainty  about  the  location  of  grey  matter  and  grey/white  matter  border  in  the  PET  scan.    For  all 
this, the following paragraphs have been included in section 4.2. and 4.4. of the SmPC, respectively. 
“Neuraceq  images  should  only  be  interpreted  by  readers  trained  in  the  interpretation  of  PET  images 
with florbetaben (18F). A recent co-registered computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance 
(MR)  imaging  of  the  patient  to  get  a  fused  PET-CT  or  PET-MR  image  is  recommended  in  cases  of 
uncertainty about the location of grey matter and of the grey/white matter border in the PET scan (see 
section 4.4. Image interpretation).” 
“Some scans may be difficult to interpret due to image noise, atrophy with a thinned cortical ribbon, or 
image blur, which could lead to interpretation errors. For cases in which there is uncertainty about the 
location  of  grey  matter  and  of  the  grey/white  matter  border  on  the  PET  scan,  and  a  co-registered 
recent CT or MR image is available, the interpreter should examine the fused PET-CT or PET-MR image 
to clarify the relationship of the PET radioactivity and the grey matter anatomy.” 
Since false-positive cases have already been detected in the subject-level visual PET assessment of the 
31 autopsied patients in the FAS population (in a patient with focal atrophy and a patient with frequent 
diffuse  amyloid  plaques),  and  in  the  post-hoc  analysis  (1  case  of  progressive  supranuclear  palsy,  1 
subject  with  infarct  and  1  with  Dementia  with  Lewy  bodies),  section  4.4.  of  the  SmPC  mentions  that 
“image interpretation errors in the estimation of brain beta-amyoid deposition, including false positive 
{and false negative}, have been observed.” 
Florbetaben  (18F)  is  to  be  prescribed  by  physicians  skilled  in  the  clinical  management  of 
neurodegenerative disorders.  Another requirement is that PET scans be read blinded to clinical data as 
done in autopsy studies. It might acceptable since the clinical status of the patient might influence the 
Neuraceq 
EMA/5028/2014

image interpretation if atrophy is suspected. This is included in the SmPC although it will be hard to be 
fulfilled  considering  that  Nuclear  Medicine  physicians  usually  review  clinical  data  to  interpret  brain 
SPECT/PECT images. 
Due  to  the  difficulties  for  visual  qualitative  interpretation  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scans,  it  is 
mandatory  to  complete  an  appropriate  reader  training  prior  to  routine  clinical  image  interpretation. 
Two distinct methods have been used during the clinical development: an in-person training (in study 
14595) and the electronic training (in study 16034).   The company clarifies that in the pivotal study 
14595 and in study 16304, similar PET reader training was implemented except for the fact that it was 
in-person and electronic, respectively.  This implies that some differences may exist since, at least, in 
the in-person training the reader could ask the trainer any doubt which he/she may have while it is not 
possible for the electronic training. 
The electronic version is the methodology proposed in clinical practice.  The company clarifies that the 
electronic  training  programme  used  during  florbetaben  (18F)  clinical  development  matches  the  one 
that  will  be  available  to  physicians  post-approval.        The  Applicant  has  provided  with  the  electronic 
training version.  It was handicapped by lack of qualification of readers after reading and a low number 
of cases.  Moreover, some training cases presented with drawbacks which might falsely influence the 
image  interpretation:  images  very  noisy  or  very  smooth,  images  of  low  quality  and  others.    These 
drawbacks should be addressed in the training programme.   The electronic training programme should 
be improved as follows: 
• 
•  Relevant  information  on florbetaben  (18F),  including  the  approved  indication  according  to  the 
SmPC,  limitations  on  its  use,  interpretation  errors,  safety  information  and  the  results  of  the 
phase 3 autopsy should be at least included. 
The material should include florbetaben (18F) PET demonstration cases with correct PET  scan 
interpretation by an experienced reader, florbetaben (18F) PET scans for self-assessment, and 
a self-qualification procedure to be offered to each trainee.  Training should include a sufficient 
number  of  clearly  positive  and  negative  cases  as  well  as  intermediate  level  cases.    Cases 
should be histopathologically confirmed, if possible. 
•  Expertise and qualification of trainers in the electronic training should be ensured. 
• 
The following aspects should be incorporated: 
o 
that  the  visual  PET  scan  reading  should  be  made  in  a  grey  scale  but  not  also  in  an 
inverse grey scale. 
o  The pattern of tracer uptake in persons not suffering from AD should be eliminated 
o  Any  mention  to  11C-PIB  or  (18F)  fludesoxyglucose  should  be  deleted  as  they  are  not 
approved radiopharmaceuticals. 
•  Any slide referred to research applications should be deleted (i.e. slides 8/17, 12/17 and 16/17 
of  module  2.1)  to  avoid  confusing  users  in  clinical  practice.    Slide  8/17  includes  still  non-
validated criteria.   Slide 11/17 and 16/17 refer to potential applications which have not been 
demonstrated yet. 
•  Slide  12/17  of  clinical  applications  should  be  modified  to  include  the  approved  indication  but 
deleting any potential indication which is still neither approved nor concluded. 
•  Drawbacks  which  might  falsely  influence  the  image  interpretation  in  some  training  cases 
(images very noisy or very smooth, images of low quality and others) should be addressed in 
the training programme since they are not acceptable in clinical practice.    
Since  residual  tracer  in  the  superior  sagittal  sinus  is  sometimes  observed  as  incidental  finding,  as 
mentioned in the training, this has been included in the non-specific uptake of SmPC. 
The  company  is  advised  to  provide  high  quality  training  in  all  countries  where  florbetaben  (18F)  is 
available, and that the training materials will be available in electronic programmes in clinical practice, 
and that the different channels will deliver a similar electronic-based method, and that such method is 
similar to that provided in CD and the one in study 16034. 
The  final  visual  assessment  method  (which  is  currently  proposed  in  the  SmPC  and  the  one  in  the

However,  the  pivotal  study  14595  involved  PET  reading  only  on  grey  scale.    Therefore,  the  inverse 
grey scale has been removed from the electronic training programme.   
The optimal dose of florbetaben (18F) PET images was not determined by specific studies or 
adequately justified.  The company proposed the dose of 300 MBq ± 20% of florbetaben (18F).  The 
initially recommended optimal time window and duration scan at the SmPC (i.e. a 20-min duration 
scan at 45-130 minutes p.i. of florbetaben (18F)) cannot be justified on the basis of visual PET reading 
of study A42404.  In the pivotal autopsy study, PET imaging for 20 minutes was to start approximately 
at 90 minutes after the injection based on results of study A42404.   Therefore, the time window and 
duration scan at the SmPC has been modified in agreement with parameters used in the pivotal study. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results are discussed hereinafter on the basis of fulfillment of the “Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of 
Diagnostic Agents” (CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev 1) and Appendix 1 on Imaging Agents 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/321180/2008). 
DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE 
The  pivotal  study  14595  was  focused  on  evaluating  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  visual  PET  scan 
reading by 3 independent blinded readers, using the post-mortem histopathological estimates of beta 
amyloid deposition as SOT.  This approach using autopsy data as SOT is justified as it can demonstrate 
that  the  results  obtained  with  the  investigational  diagnostic  agent  are  valid  for  estimation  of  plaque 
detection. 
From  216  subjects  who  underwent  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  imaging,  both  10  HVs  and  the  first  31 
subjects  who  died  and  underwent  brain  autopsy  were  considered  evaluable  for  the  SOT  assessment 
(FAS).    Apart  from  the  HVs,  the  remaining  participants  do  not  represent  the  intended  population  for 
clinical  use  of  this  radiopharmaceutical  in  clinical  practice:  they  were  older  (more  than  80  years  of 
mean,  and  62-97  of  age  range),  and  they  already  presented  with  clinical  AD  at  study  entry  for  long 
time (mean of 69.6 months; range:17-300) or as much as 18.2% of them (n=4) had a family history 
of  AD.    Moreover,  the  cognitive  impairment  of  the  FAS  which  was  likely  set  up  inaccurately  as 
discussed  before,  may  be  different  from  that  of  the  intended  population  considering  that  10  HVs 
(24.4%),  22  AD  patients  (53.7%),  2  with  other  dementias  (5%),  1  patient  with  DLB  (2.5%)  and  6 
non-demented  volunteers  (15%)  were  included.    It  remains  unknown  how  many  recruited  subjects 
actually had MCI or no cognitive impairment at study entry.

important  methodological  drawbacks  and 
limitations  (see  comments 
When  the  study  was  stopped,  it  was  found  that  actual  values  (mean  and  95%CI)  of  sensitivity  and 
specificity of the majority read of the visual assessment of regional tracer uptake in the co-registered 
florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images,  in  correctly  differentiating  between  brain  regions  with  and  without  β-
amyloid  deposition,  was  77.4%  (95%  CI:  65.4%–89.4%)  and  94.2%  (95%  CI:  88.6%–99.8%), 
respectively,  for  a  total  of  244  regions  analysed.    Because  the  lower  bound  of  the  2-sided  95% 
confidence interval was >60% for sensitivity and >80% for specificity (the predefined criteria for study 
success), the primary objective of the study was met.   There were 8 false-positive cases, and also 24 
false-negative cases (13 out of the 24 resulted from regions 3 (hippocampus) and 6 (cerebellum)).   
Overall,  sensitivities  and  specificities  of  the  visual  assessment  of  regional  tracer  uptake  in  the 
florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images,  in  correctly  differentiating  between  brain  regions  with  and  without  β-
amyloid  deposition,  were  equal  than  those  for  the  majority  for  reader  1:  80%  (95%  CI:  67%-93%) 
and 91% (95% CI: 84%-98%), respectively.  So were for reader 2:  sensitivity of 81% (95% CI: 72%-
90%) and specificity of 91 (95% CI: 85%-98%).  However, reader 3 showed sensitivity as low as 59% 
(95%  CI:  47%-72%),  and  specificity  of  92%  (95%  CI:  85%-99%).  Sensitivities  of  the  majority  read 
also varies significantly between brain regions (0% region 6, 57.1% region 3, 81.8% region 5, 85.7% 
region 1, 88.9% region 2 and 90% region 4).

Using the composite “whole brain” for florbetaben (18F) PET and for autopsy, derived from combining 
results  of  the  6  particular  regions  used  for  the  primary  objective,  increased  sensitivity  but  decreased 
specificity  for  the  majority  read  were  obtained:  87%  (95%  CI:  73.2  –  100%)  and  88.9%  (95%  CI: 
74.4%  –  100%),  respectively.    For  this  analysis,  95%  CI  were  computed  using  a  normal 
approximation. When the more appropriate exact confidence interval limits are computed, lower limits 
of the 95% CI are 66.4% and 65.3% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. 
Using  the  subject  level  assessment  of  non-co-registered  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images  (which  is  the 
one recommended in clinical practice), determined secondarily in the pivotal study in the first available 
31  autopsied  patients  excluding  HVs  versus  the  onsite  neuropathological  diagnosis  (until  September 
2011), the sensitivity and specificity of the majority read were:  100% (95% CI: 80.5% – 100%) and 
85.7%  (95%  CI:  67.4%  –  100%),  respectively.    Therefore,  the  visual  subject-level  method  partially 
met the study hypotheses set up as the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of sensitivity had to 
be higher than 0.6 and for specificity higher than 0.8.  Considering also the 10 HVs, 17 patients were 
classified as beta-amyloid while there was no beta-amyloid in 24 cases.  No false-negative and 2 false-
positive cases existed (in a patient with focal atrophy and a patient with moderate amounts of neuritic 
plaques and frequent diffuse amyloid plaques). 
In the post-hoc analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of the majority read of the visual subject-level 
assessment of florbetaben (18F) PET versus histopathology in the 74 subjects of study 14595 who had 
already  died  and  be  autopsied  by  August  1st,  2013  was  97.9%  (95%CI:  93.8%-100%)  and  88.9% 
(95%CI:  77%-100%).    The  confidence  intervals  were  narrower  than  in  the  original  analysis.      The 
previously mentioned hypothesis in the original pivotal study was again met for sensitivity but not for 
specificity.  In this sense, the crucial factor for the beta-amyloid PET imaging is achieving a reasonable 
level of sensitivity on a subject-level basis to exclude the presence of relevant beta-amyloid deposition 
in order to be able to exclude AD. 47 patients were classified as beta-amyloid present while there was 
no beta-amyloid in 27 cases.  For the majority read, 1 false-negative and 3 false-positive cases existed 
(1 case of progressive supranuclear palsy, 1 with infarct and 1 with Dementia with Lewy bodies).   
Study  14311  has  limited  value  to  draw  firm  conclusions  on  the  diagnostic  performance  of  visual  PET 
scan reading in the intended population, as discussed previously.  Moreover, the expected sensitivity of 
the  visual  assessment  of  the  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images  in  detecting  cerebral  beta-amyloid  in 
individuals  with  DS  compared  to  HVs  was  far  to  be  reached  neither  by  the  majority  read  nor  by 
individual readers, expect in some subanalyses of DS aged at least 46 or 50.  Specificity in young HVs 
was higher than expected (at least 94.3%).   
Study 311741  represents a clinical scenario where amyloid imaging (both visual and quantitative PET 
scan reading) is tested to confirm the clinical diagnosis at baseline.  The algorithm B was chosen in the 
first  study  part  (part  A)  and  tried  to  be  validated  at  the  second  one  (part  B).    When  comparing  pAD 
and  HVs,  the  average  sensitivity  of  visual  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  (from  the  90  to  110  min  imaging 
window) images was low (74.8%) with a high specificity (96.1%) versus the  clinical diagnosis by the 
onsite investigator and considering positive PET scan if at least 1 out of 8 predefined regions presented 
with pronounced (not minor) beta amyloid deposition (part A of the study).   
If  using  the  majority  read  and  considering  a  PET  scan  as  positive  if  at  least  1  out  of  8  predefined 
regions  presented  with  minor  or  pronounced  beta  amyloid  deposition  instead,  sensitivity  slightly 
increased (79.5%) but specificity decreased (91.2%) in that population of study part A. In an attempt 
to  validate  this  approach  in  the  study  part  B  recruiting  another  sample  of  also  pAD  and  HV,  the 
majority  CP  reading  did  not  allow  meeting  the  success  criteria  (i.e.    sensitivity  higher  than  65%  and 
specificity higher than 75%).

As  shown,  as  much  as  32.8%  of  subjects  with  clinical  diagnosis  of  probable  AD  with  mild/moderate 
dementia (according to NINCS-ADRDA criteria) were considered negative after visual PET scan reading 
by  the  majority  of  3  independent  blinded  readers  in  a  CP.    It  is  slightly  higher  than  the  expected 
prevalence  of  amyloid-negative  individuals  in  a  clinically  diagnosed  AD  population  based  on  some 
literature  reports  of  the  false  positive  rate  of  clinically-diagnosed  AD  subjects  versus  autopsy  (about 
20%, Lim et al. 1999, Pearl et al. 1997). 
Only  3.3%  of  older  HVs  showed  a  positive  PET  scan.    This  observation  is  inconsistent  with  literature 
reports  that  13%  to  45%  of  apparently  cognitively  HVs  subjects  have  significant  beta  amyloid 
pathology  at  autopsy  (Hulette  et  al.  1998,  Davis  et  al.  1999,  Price  et  al.  1999,  Schimitt  et  al.  2000; 
knopman et al. 2003, Aizenstein et al. 2008). 
In  Study  312043  ,  on  visual  baseline  PET  reading  for  detection  of  MCI  versus  the  baseline  clinical 
diagnosis, based on the BAPL score on subject basis on the 90-110 min florbetaben (18F) PET image, 
there were 29 MCI patients with a positive PET scan while 16 MCI patients had a negative scan.  At the 
45-60 time window, values were worst.  The observation that 64.4% of MCI subjects were positive by 
florbetaben  (18F)-PET  scan  is  consistent  with  the  autopsy  literature  that  shows  33%  to  62%  of  MCI 
subjects are positive at post-mortem examination (Bennett, 2005; Petersen, 2006). 
At the 24-month follow-up (see table below), the assessment of progression from MCI to AD was done 
for all 45 subjects although only 36 were performed a third florbetaben (18F) scan at the follow-up: 
• 19  out  of  the  45  (42.2%)  converted  from  MCI  at  baseline  to  AD  24  months  later,  independently  if 
they had a positive or a negative florbetaben (18F) PET scan.  The remaining subjects, i.e. 26 (57.8%), 
kept stable or regressed to cognitively normal 
• Out of the total of 29 MCI subjects who had a positive PET scan, 19 (65.5%) were classified 
clinically as converted to clinical AD after 24 months. 
• Based  on  the  CHMP’s  calculations:  sensitivity  of  florbetaben  (18F)  scan  to  show  the  MCI  conversion 
rate to AD in 19 converters was 100%, specificity in 26 non-converters was 61.5% (95% CI: 42.8%-
80.2%),  positive  likelihood  ratio  was  2.60  (95%  CI:  1.60-4.23)  and  negative  likelihood  ratio  was  0 
(0.06-0.84). The design of this study does not allow estimating the risk of MCI progression to clinical 
AD.

The corresponding cut-off values (ROC curve defined) and resulting sensitivity, specificity, positive and

SUVR=1.4)  showed  a  good  ability  to  distinguish  subjects  that  progress  to  AD  from  those  who  do  not 
over a 2-year period. 
In  study  16034  the  diagnostic  performance  (sensitivity  and  specificity)  of  the  visual  interpretation  of 
PET images, on a subject basis and considering the CP majority read, versus histopathology in the 54 
subjects of study 14595 who had already died and be autopsied by 19 may 2012 was lower (sensitivity 
range:  77.5%  to  90%  and  specificity  range:  62.5%-85.5%  -excluding  HVs)  than  in  the  pivotal  study 
(sensitivity: 100% (95% CI: 80.5 – 100%) and specificity: 85.7% (95% CI: 67.4% – 100%) when the 
same subgroup population was assessed by different readers with different training methods.  On the 
analysis  on  a  subject  basis,  the  combined  hypothesis  that  sensitivity  is  smaller  or  equal  to  0.6  and 
specificity was smaller or equal to 0.7 could only be rejected for one out of the 5 readers, why the goal 
to reject this hypothesis for at least 3 out of the 5 readers was not met.     Two reasons why the goal 
to  reject  the  hypothesis  failed  have  been  provided.    The  small  number  of  beta-amyloid  negative 
subjects  (as  well  as  false  positives)  has  an  influence  on  the  calculated  specificity  with  a  larger 
confidence  interval  and  95%  LCI  lower  than  for  a  larger  sample  size.  The  brains  of  the  end-of-life 
patients  can  be  expected  to  include  more  frequently  structural  abnormalities  (thinner  cortex  layer, 
spill-over  effects  from  white  matter  with  false  positive  visual  read  assessments  as  a  result).  As  for 
another beta-amyloid PET tracer approved for the same indication, CT- or MRI-co-registrations may be 
applied to enhance accuracy of visual readings in defined cortical brain regions.  
There were 6 false-positive cases and 5 false-negative.  False-positive cases occurred in a young HV, 
cases  with  low  grey  matter/white  matter  contrast,  marked  atrophy,  intense  patient  motion  and 
heterogeneous  pattern  of  uptake  in  the  same  lobe.    False-negative  cases  occurred  in  cases  with 
moderate diffuse plaques. 
The company currently presents additional data comparing the results of PET scan reading in study 
16034 with the onsite pathology assessment collected for all subjects (same as used for the post-hoc 
analysis).   For the majority read, sensitivity and specificity are 100% (95%IC: 89.4-100%) and 71.4% 
(95%IC: 52.1-90.8%), respectively. 
The  values  in  the  population  from  study  311741  part  B  were  slightly  different  that  those  obtained  in 
the individual study: sensitivity (69%-81% versus 62.9%-71.6% in the original study) and specificity 
(82%-95% versus 94.9%-97.5% in the original study).  In the  MCI subjects from study  312043, the 
sensitivity  and  specificity  for  the  conversion  rate  to  AD  over  24  months  were  slightly  higher  to  those 
obtained  in  the  individual  study:  sensitivity  (89%-95%  versus  85.7%  in  the  original  study)  and 
specificity (65%-77% versus 63.6% in the original study).   
The  differences  between  this  study  and  the  individual  ones  might  be  a  consequence  of  the  formal 
training (electronic vs in person), of the selection process of candidates to participate as readers in the 
study and, in the autopsied population, of the section of a different SOT.   
TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE AND PRACTICABILITY 
Image quality 
Data  on  image  quality  from  the  phase  2  and  3  trials  have  not  been  provided.    The  company  should 
elucidate if image quality was an endpoint assessed in phase 2 or 3 trials.  Data was obtained in the 
phase 1 study A42404 (see section “Pharmacodynamics”). 
Reader confidence 
Data on reader confidence from the phase 2 and 3 trials have not been provided. The company should 
elucidate if reader confidence was an endpoint assessed in phase 2 or 3 trials.  Data was obtained in 
the phase 1 study A42404 (see section “Pharmacodynamics”). 
Inter and intra-reader concordance 
In the pivotal study, the agreement of blinded readers across the 6 brain regions measured by kappa 
coefficient  across  all  3  readers  was  substantial  (kappa=0.658).  However,  this  analysis  is  inadequate 
Neuraceq 
EMA/5028/2014 
Page 89/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
because it has not taken into account the within subject correlation observed among regions. Although 
agreement  across  regions  between  pairs  of  readers  is  similar  among  the  three  different  pairs  of 
readers, this agreement  varies greatly in some regions. For example, for region 6, kappa coefficients 
range from -0.025 for readers 1 and 3 to 1.00 for readers 1 and 2.  
Inter-reader  agreement  computed  in  the  study  14311  in  DS  and  HV  subjects  was  only  moderate 
(kappa=0.55)  and  remained  as  such  in  the  various  analyses  performed.  The  intra-reader  agreement 
was substantial (kappa=1.00) for 2 of the three readers and poor in the third reader. 
In  the  electronic  training  study,  inter-reader  agreement  for  the  whole  sample  combining  various 
diseases was higher than expected: 0.787 (CI: 0.750 – 0.824) across all five readers (the lowest one 
being  0.677  (95%  CI:  0.609  –  0.744)  between  readers  2  and  5).    The  intra-reader  agreement  was 
established in a low sample size of 0.957 (95% CI: 0.872 – 1.041) for reader 4 and the lowest being 
0.823 (95% CI: 0.657 – 0.989) for reader 1.  Inter-reader agreement of visual assessment on subject 
basis of the florbetaben (18F) PET scan for the autopsy population subgroup (kappa=0.69) were lower 
to those obtained in the autopsy study (kappa=0.87).  The company justifies the difference in part due 
to  the  different  sample  analysed  (n=64  in  study  16034  vs  41  in  14595)  and  partly  to  their  different 
training programme (electronic in 16034 vs in-person in 14595), which is somehow worrisome since it 
is  the  training  method  proposed  in  clinical  practice.  Inter-reader  agreement  of  visual  assessment  on 
subject  basis  of  the  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scan  for  the  population  subgroup  of  pAD/HVs  recruited  in 
study  311741  part  B  was  similar  to  the  values  obtained  in  the  original  study  (0.81  vs  0.86, 
respectively) .  
Test-retest reproducibility 
Data on test-retest reproducilibity from the phase 2 and 3 trials have not been provided.  The company 
should elucidate if test-retest was an endpoint assessed in phase 2 or 3 trials.  Only some data exist 
from phase 1 study 312161 (see section “Pharmacodynamics”). 
IMPACT ON DIAGNOSTIC THINKING AND/OR PATIENT MANAGEMENT 
The guideline on clinical evaluation of diagnostic agents (CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev. 1) establishes as a 
requirement on study data for new diagnostic agents, that “……relevant impact on diagnostic thinking 
and/or patient management in the appropriate clinical context should be demonstrated, if therapeutic 
consequences  of  the  diagnosis  obtained  with  a  new  agent  are  not  obvious  …..”.  This  applies  to 
florbetaben (18F), although this has not been demonstrated for this diagnostic agent. The company is 
recommended  to  perform  a  study  to  assess  the  impact  on  diagnostic  thinking  and  patient 
management. 
INDICATION 
The original wording of the indication refers to  
 “This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
Neuraceq  is  indicated  for  the  detection  of  β-amyloid  in  the  brain,  thereby  assisting  in  the  differential 
diagnosis  in  adult  patients  who  are  being  evaluated  for  Alzheimer’s  disease  and  other  causes  of 
cognitive decline.” 
The  first  statement  (i.e.  “is  indicated  for  the  detection  of  β-amyloid  in  the  brain”)  should  be 
approached  by  the  results  of  technical  and  diagnostic  performances  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  scan 
reading to estimate the beta amyloid deposition, as assessed in a pivotal study and various supportive 
studies,  which  were  previously  discussed  in  this  report.    What  an  abnormal  or  normal  represents  in 
terms of level of a particular beta amyloid structure should be detailed in the wording.  In this sense, 
CHMP  acknowledged  that  none  to  sparse  neuritic  plaque  density  in  the  area  with  maximal  neuritic 
plaque  density  measured  on  sections  of  frontal,  temporal  or  parietal  cortex,  is  incompatible  with  a 
definitive diagnosis of AD.   
On the other hand, it is already known that moderate to frequent amount of neuritic plaques is present 
in patients with AD, but also other types of neurologic conditions as well as in older people with normal 
Neuraceq 
EMA/5028/2014 
Page 90/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cognition.  Therefore, this amount per se (even in autopsy or in a positive beta-amyloid PET scan) does 
not  establish  a  diagnosis  of  AD.    To  this  regard,  the  amyloid  cascade  hypothesis  suggests  that 
accumulation of Aβ is the key pathological step in the pathogenesis of AD.  However, Aβ deposition is 
not the only factor of AD.  For that reason, pre-specified levels of age-related brain neuritic β-amyloid 
plaque at autopsy should be integrated with the presence of a clinical history of dementia to arrive at a 
diagnostic  level  of  certainty  with  regard  to  AD  (Mirra  et  al.  1991).    β-amyloid  plaques  may  also  be 
present in cognitively normal elderly, patients with MCI, with other dementias (dementia of Lewy Body, 
Parkinson disease dementia), Niemann-Pick disease type C and severe brain injury. 
The  wording  continues  that  this  radiopharmaceutical  is  for  “assisting  in  the  differential  diagnosis  in 
adult patients who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease and other causes of cognitive decline.”. 
This is worrisome since it might be interpreted as if the product is intended for many different subjects 
who  might  be  evaluated  for  AD  or  cognitive  impairment,  even  those  pre-symptomatic  familiar  AD 
cases.  Therefore,  the  intended  population  should  be  appropriately  defined  as  adult  patients  with 
cognitive  impairment  who  are  being  evaluated  for  Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD)  and  other  causes  of 
cognitive impairment.   
In  this  corrected  intended  population,  the  radiopharmaceutical  intends  to  assist  in  the  differential 
diagnosis.    That  implies  not  only  that  subjects  with  cognitive  impairment  might  be  differentiate  from 
those with dementia (there are no data on the value of florbetaben (18F) for such approach) but also 
to differentiate among different types of dementia (only few comparative data on brain uptake phase 1 
study  A42404)  or  to  differentiate  among  different  types  of  cognitive  impairment  (no  efficacy  data 
provided with florbetaben (18F)). 
Florbetaben (18F) PET scan should be used as an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations, and not as a 
stand-alone  test.    As  this  product  cannot  replace  to  clinical  assessment  of  patients,  the  indication 
should  be  reworded  from  the  very  beginning  to  state  that  florbetaben  (18F)  should  be  used  in 
conjunction with clinical assessment.   
The safety and efficacy of florbetaben (18F) have not been established for predicting the development 
of  dementia  or  other  neurological  conditions,  or  for  monitoring  response  to  therapies”.  This  is  crucial 
since it may trigger decisions that patients with clinical features of AD may not be treated on the basis 
of these findings. 
Since this radiopharmaceutical has not demonstrated efficacy for any particular diagnostic objective of 
a  real  validated  internationally-recognised  disease,  as  usually  a  radiopharmaceutical  is  granted, 
limitations  of  the  radiopharmaceutical  are  of  major  interest  and  have  been  included  in  the  indication 
wording as a cross-reference to the full information stated in section 4.4. of the SmPC.” 
Taking all this into account the following revised indication is accepted: 
“This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.  
Neuraceq  is  a  radiopharmaceutical  indicated  for  Positron  Emission  Tomography  (PET)  imaging  of  β-
amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being 
evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive impairment. Neuraceq should be 
used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation.  
A negative scan indicates sparse or no plaques, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of AD. For the 
limitations in the interpretation of a positive scan, see sections 4.4 and 5.1.” 
with the following additional wording in section 4.4. 
“Limitations of use  
A  positive  scan  does  not  independently  establish  a  diagnosis  of  AD  or  other  cognitive  disorder  since 
neuritic  plaque  deposition  in  grey  matter  may  be  present  in  asymptomatic  elderly  and  some 
neurodegenerative  dementias  (Alzheimer’s  disease,  Lewy  body  dementia,  Parkinson’s  disease 
dementia).  
For the limitations of use in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), see section 5.1.

The efficacy of Neuraceq for predicting development of AD or monitoring response to therapy has not 
been established (see section 5.1).” 
and including in section 5.1. the results of study 312043 recruiting subjects clinically diagnosed as MCI 
who underwent baseline florbetaben (18F) PET scans and were followed for 24 months to evaluate the 
relationship  between  florbetaben  (18F)  imaging  and  changes  in  diagnostic  status.    The  diagnostic 
performance values of florbetaben (18F) for detection of MCI versus clinical diagnosis at baseline, and 
for the conversion rate from MCI to clinical AD at follow-up should be included.   
EFFICACY IN SUBPOPULATIONS 
The  black  subpopulation  was  not  sufficiently  represented  in  the  clinical  studies  restricting  the 
conclusions on potential differences in the diagnostic performance results based on ethnicity.   Although 
differences  in  clinical  presentations  (frequency  or  survival,  of  AD  and  other  types  of  dementia)  has 
been  suggested  in  different  patient  populations  with  different  ethnic  backgrounds  in  the  literature, 
there  is  no  evidence  for  differences  in  the  presence  or  number  of  plaques,  tangles,  Lewy  bodies, 
infarcts, or amyloid angiopathy, amyloid plaques and NFTs in neuropathologically confirmed AD among 
African American and white subjects of similar clinical dementia severity.  
No  efficacy  subanalysis  has  been  presented  for  the  use  of  florbetaben  (18F)  in  patients  with  atypical 
presentations of AD (asymmetric, frontal variants, posterior cortical degeneration and a single positive 
abnormal region).   
The  paediatric  use  of  this  radiopharmaceutical  has  neither  been  assessed  nor  expected.    A  product-
specific waiver for paediatric studies was granted. 
The  company  provided  with  the  results  of  the  re-reading  study.  This  study  included  82  autopsied 
patients  from  the  pivotal  autopsy  study  14595  and  10  HVs  considered  amyloid-negative.    The  main 
objective  was  to  assess  the  efficacy  (sensitivity  and  specificity)  of  the  visual  assessment  method 
proposed for clinical practice of florbetaben (18F) PET scans, by five new electronically trained readers 
(as it is intended to be used as part of the future training for users), in the detection of beta-amyloid 
neuritic plaques in the brain.    
Subject-level  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  of  those  82  autopsied  patients 
excluding  HVs,  using  as  SoT  the  presence  (moderate  or  frequent)  or  absence  (none  or  sparse)  of 
amyloid  neuritic  plaques  as  detected  by  BSS  and  scored  by  the  histopathology  consensus  panel 
according  to  the  CERAD  criteria  (except  for  the  total  regions  to  be  assessed),  was  a  secondary 
variable.   Actual assessed regions are displayed in the table below:  
If in any of the 6 regions neuritic beta-amyloid plaques were evaluated as being 'present' at a clinico-
pathologically  relevant  level  (either  moderate  or  frequent),  the  subject  was  determined  as  having 
clinico-pathologically  relevant  neuritic  beta-amyloid  deposition  in  the  brain.  If  in  none  of  the  regions 
Neuraceq 
EMA/5028/2014 
Page 92/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the histopathological findings were assessed as being more than 'no' or 'sparse' neuritic beta-amyloid 
plaques, the subject was scored as 'no neuritic beta-amyloid present'. 
Sensitivity and specificity results were successfully met with the same 3/5 readers exceeding the pre-
specified threshold (i.e. the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for sensitivity and specificity 
were higher than the thresholds of 0.6 and 0.5 respectively for at least 3 out of the 5 blinded readers) 
(see table 9-4 below).  However, two readers had very low specificity. 
In addition, the applicant extended the post-hoc analysis presented in the response to the day120 list of 
questions from n=74 brains to the currently available n=81 brains (Table 2). The high sensitivity of 
Neuraceq was confirmed in this analysis. The majority sensitivity for the three readers in the new post-
hoc analysis was 96.3 % (ranging from 97.9%-100%) and the specificity was 88.9% (ranging from 85.2%-
88.9%). In addition, no difference to the analysis with n=74 brains was observed. The specificity is 
unchanged, as no new beta-amyloid negative brains were included in the additional 7 brains.

1.6.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of the visual reading of (18F) florbetaben PET images is sufficiently supported by 
the original results from study 14595, and the post-hoc analysis in which the pivotal study 14595 
expanded to include the additional patients.  A consistent high sensitivity (>80%), and an increased 
specificity (95%LCI: 67%; n=31) in a larger patient population group (95% LCI: 77%; n=74) was 
demonstrated in the results when analysed without the additional 10 HVs.  Sensitivity in the analyses 
exceeded 93% in the post-hoc (n=74 brains) analyses for all three readers.    
Sensitivity and specificity to estimate beta-amyloid deposition of florbetaben (18F) was further 
investigated in one additional study, in which a different set of 5 electronically-trained blinded readers 
interpreted images from 54 subjects followed to autopsy in the pivotal study. The histopathology 
criteria did not match the CERAD criteria. The results were lower than the results obtained in the 
pivotal trial: a sensitivity range between 77.5% to 90% and specificity range between 62.5-85.7%. 
Inter-rater agreement using Fleiss’ kappa values ranged from 0.68 to 0.87.  Comparing the results of 
PET scan reading with the histopathology assessment collected for all subjects (same as used for the 
original pivotal study and its post-hoc analysis), the majority read sensitivity and specificity were 
100% (95%CI: 89.4-100%) and 71.4% (95%CI: 52.1-90.8%), respectively. 
The analysis of the results from the “New Read Study” provided additional supportive data and made 
this subset comparable to the post-hoc analysis data of study 14595, using in-person trained readers.   
Correlation of PET versus histopathology was not quantitatively measured.  The impact of florbetaben 
(18F) PET on diagnostic thinking and/or patient management was not adequately assessed and that is 
why the company would be encouraged to perform a study addressing this issue. Additionally it would 
be  advisable  that  the  company  continue  to  develop  and  validate  a  quantitative  PET  reading 
methodology based on their product. 
Notwithstanding  the  limitations,  discussed  in  the  different  sections  of  this  report,  it  can  be  concluded 
that  a  consistent  high  sensitivity  and  specificity  in  the  target  patient  population  group  was 
demonstrated for florbetaben (18F).  
1.7.  Clinical safety 
The  primary  safety  analysis  is  based  on  the  comprehensive  integration  of  data  from  all  subjects 
exposed to any amount of florbetaben (18F) in all studies of the clinical development programme (see 
table  1  in  section  3.1.),  with  some  exceptions.    The  investigator-sponsored  phase  1  study  (Report 
A42404) is not included in the pooled safety analysis due to the study design. 
It is not stated if there are ongoing florbetaben (18F) studies with safety assessment beside the pivotal 
autopsy study. 
Patient exposure 
The pooled integrated analysis of safety is based on 8 studies: 5 Phase 1 studies, 2 Phase 2 studies (of 
which  one  study  comprises  two  consecutive  independent  parts),  and  a  single  pivotal  Phase  3  study 
(excluding the 24 subjects discussed in Addendum report PH-36927) (see table 1-19).   
Neuraceq 
EMA/5028/2014 
Page 94/114 
 
 
 
 
Of  the  884  subjects  included  in  the  integrated  analysis  pool,  872  subjects  received  978  florbetaben 
(18F) administrations and 12 subjects received vehicle.  Few subjects received vehicle (N = 12 doses) 
or florbetaben (18F) tracer mass dose > 10 microg/injection (N = 46 doses) when compared with the 
number of subjects receiving a tracer mass dose of ≤ 10 microg/injection (N = 932 doses).  
The actual mean radioactivity applied to all subjects treated with florbetaben (18F) was 297.34 ±24.74 
MBq (ranging from 169.49 to 374.29). The subjects who received the > 10 microg/injection received 
279.17 ± 25.51 MBq and subjects who received ≤ 10 microg/injection received 298.24 ± 24.37 MBq. 
The  mean  florbetaben  (18F)  dose  for  the  total  population  receiving  the  drug  was  3.30±  9.51 
microg/injection, with a mean of 43.54 ± 13.43 microg/injection for subjects receiving the tracer mass 
dose  >  10  microg/injection  and  a  mean  of  1.30  ±  1.36  microg/injection  for  subjects  receiving  the 
tracer mass dose ≤ 10 microg/injection.  
The final formulation that is proposed for marketing is different from the one used in the single pivotal 
study.  As of April 10, 2013, in the phase 3 study 14595 florbetaben was injected 256 times in 216 
patients using the development formulation. Until April 10, 2013, 65 florbetaben injections were done 
with the new commercial formulation in 60 patients.    
The majority of studies included subjects with AD, DS, DEM, or MCI, as well as HVs and NDVs. All HV 
and  NDV  subjects  from  the  studies  included  in  the  integrated  pool  are  combined  into  an  overall  NDV 
category for analysis as they are all non-demented volunteers.  
The mean age of the population was 67.7 ± 15.6 years (range: 21 to 98 years); 70.5% of the subjects 
(698/990) were ≥ 65 years old. Most study drug administrations were to Caucasian (83.4%, 826/990). 
More  study  drug  administrations  occurred  at  European  sites  (41.2%,  408/990),  followed  by  the  USA 
(24.7%,  245/990),  Australia  (20.3%,  201/990),  and  Japan  (13.7%,  136/990).  The  population  was 
almost equally divided between males and females (54.2% vs 45.8%, respectively). The mean weight 
was  71.4  ±  16.0  kg,  with  a  mean  body  mass  index  (BMI)  of  25.6  ±  4.76  kg/m2.  Most  study  drug 
administrations in the overall safety population were to subjects with eGFR values of > 60 mL/minute 
(60.7%, 601/990).

In  the  total  subject  pool,  87.9%  subjects  had  taken  at  least  one  prior  or  concomitant  medication  at 
study start. The most common drugs taken as prior medication were phsychoanaleptics (462 subjects, 
46.7%),  analgesics  (342  subjects,  34.5%),  lipid  modifying  agents  (320  subjects,  32.3%), 
stomatological  preparations  (315  subjects,  31.8%)  and  topical  products  for  joint  and  muscular  pain 
(314 subjects, 31.7%). 
Adverse events 
In total, 383 adverse events (AEs) were reported: 18 were reported by 10 of 12 subjects administered 
vehicle  (83.3%),  and  365  AEs  were  reported  for  the  249  (25.5%)  of  the  978  subjects  receiving 
florbetaben (18F) – 27 for the 46 subjects being administered mass dose < 10 micro/injection and 338 
reported for the 932 subjects administered mass dose ≤10 microg/injection.   
Most  subject  reports  of  AEs  following  florbetaben  (18F)  administration  were  considered  mild  (215  of 
249)  or  moderate  (31/249)  in  intensity,  with  only  3  subjects  reporting  (3/249)  severe  AEs  (Subject

subjects  administered  vehicle  experienced  drug-related  AEs.  Most  of  these  events  were  injection  site 
pain  (37  florbetaben  (18F)-administered  and  4  vehicle-administered  subjects),  injection  site  irritation 
(12 florbetaben (18F)-administered and 2 vehicle-administered subjects), and headache (7 florbetaben 
(18F)-administered  subjects).  Drug-related  AEs  occurred  most  often  (63)  during  the  first  30  minutes 
after injection of florbetaben (18F), and 8 of 18 AEs after injection of vehicle.  All drug-related AEs are 
displayed in table 2-5 by relationship to florbetaben (18F) use and primary SOC.

There  were  also  134  subjects  with  AEs  that  the  investigator  judged  to  be  study  conduct-related  not 
drug related.  Of these AES, 106 subjects reported injection site reactions (pain, hematoma, irritation 
and erythema), 9 headache and 16 reported hematoma. 
Section  4.8. of  the  SmPC  states  that  the  most  frequently  observed  adverse  drug  reaction  in  subjects 
receiving Neuraceq is injection site pain (3.9% of subjects).   
The  applicant  has  presented  in  a  table  the  different  types  of  local  reactions  reported  for  florbetaben 
with  the  Preferred  Terms  according  to  MedDRA.  The  most  common  Treatment  Emergent  AEs  were 
“injection  site  pain”,  “injection  site  haematoma”,  “injection  site  irritation”  and  “injection  site 
erythema”.    The  reported  AEs  and  ADRs  were  classified  as  mild  or  moderate  and  resolved  in  general 
without  sequelae  within  a  few  hours  after  administration  of  florbetaben.  To  reduce  the  risk  for  local 
Neuraceq 
EMA/5028/2014 
Page 97/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reactions, the draft SmPC section 4.2 states that Neuraceq should be administered by intravenous slow 
bolus  injection  followed  by  a  flush  of  10  ml  of  0.9  %  sodium  chloride.  In  addition,  it  is  stated  in  4.2 
that  the  injection  of  florbetaben  (18F)  must  be  intravenous  in  order  to  avoid  irritation  as  a  result  of 
local extravasation. ‘Injection site pain’ and ‘injection site irritation’ are included as important identified 
risks in the RMP.  
The respective adverse reaction profile for the new (commercial) formulation and the development 
formulation: only 2 ADRs (3.1%) were observed (post PET procedure hypertension / inflammatory 
papule) with the new formulation and 15 ADRs (5.9%) were observed with the development formulation.  
There was no hint suggesting that the local tolerability of Florbetaben suffered with the modifications 
which resulted in the new formulation. None of the ADRs in both groups was a serious ADR. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
A single death was reported with no causal relation to study drug or study conduct. 
Only 3 SAEs were reported. These SAEs included one DEM subject who experienced respiratory failure 
(Subject  14595/200040024,  tracer  mass  dose  ≤  10  microg/injection),  one  MCI  subject  who 
experienced  hemiparesis  (Subject  312043/000400130,  tracer  mass  dose  ≤  10  microg/injection),  and 
one subject in the NDV ≥ 55 years group who was diagnosed with a malignant neoplasm via the PET 
scan  on  the  day  of  injection  (Subject  311722/000000017,  tracer  mass  dose  >  10  microg/injection). 
These  were  all  considered  not  related  to  either  drug  treatment  or  study  procedures.  Two  of  the 
subjects  had  their  SAEs  considered  moderate  in  intensity  (the  neoplasm  malignant  and  the 
hemiparesis) and one subject had an SAE considered severe (the respiratory failure). 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical  laboratory  investigations  (electrolites,  coagulations,  hepatobiliary  and  renal  parameters)  and 
vital signs were evaluated.  The changes from baseline in those parameters were neither considered to 
be of clinical concern nor drug-related. 
Of  the  978  subjects  receiving  florbetaben,  619  subjects  had  ECG  data  available  for  evalution  and 
25.0%  (4/12)  had  ECGs  showing  changes  of  clinical  relevance  from  baseline.    No  major  differences 
were  observed  in  the  mean  change  in  HR  from  baseline  across  subject  groups.    No  trends  in  QRS 
interval and PQ interval were noted between the subject groups and their respective treatment doses.  
There  is  no  specific  effect  of  florbetaben  (18F)  on  QT/QTc  interval.    Changes  were  small  and  without 
clinical significance. 
Safety in special populations 
AEs  were  evaluated  by  the  study  subpopulations  of  gender,  age,  race,  region,  and  baseline  eGFR 
values.  
There was no difference in safety across subject group neither by gender, by age (in the range of 21-
98)  nor  by  race.    Neither  difference  in  safety  was  detected  by  geographic  region.    The  black 
subpopulation  was  not  sufficiently  represented  in  the  clinical  studies  restricting  the  conclusions  on 
potential differences in the safety results based on ethnicity. 
The PK in patients with renal impairment has not been evaluated. However, based on clinical Phase 2 
(Study 311741) data including patients with renal impairment, the safey of florbetaben (18F) was not 
different in this population compared to patients with normal renal function.  
No  analysis  of  subjects  with  altered  hepatic  function  (i.e.  elevated  serum  liver  enzymes)  has  been 
performed  to  check  any  discernible  differences  in  AEs  or  lab  values  versus  those  with  normal-range 
hepatic parameters.  However, no safety effects of florbetaben (18F) are expected in impaired hepatic 
function different than in normal hepatic function population.

In patients with either altered renal function or impaired hepatic function, the higher irradiation in the 
body  caused  by  slower  hepatic  and/or  renal  clearance  of  the  radiopharmaceutical  itself  or  their 
radioactive  metabolites  should  be  taken  into  account  and  will  be  reflected  in  the  SmPC  in  the  sense 
that careful consideration of the activity to be administered is required. 
Florbetaben (18F) is not expected to be used in women of child-bearing potential. 
Florbetaben (18F) is not indicated for use in the pediatric (age 18 years and below) population.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  clinical  studies  to  investigate  interactions  that  may  affect  safety  have  been  performed  for 
florbetaben  (18F).    As  explained  in  the  section  of  clinical  pharmacology,  because  florbetaben  is 
administered as a single microdose resulting in low plasma concentrations, no clinically relevant drug 
interaction with comedications is expected. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No  AE  occurred  during  study  dosing  that  could  lead  to  interruption  or  discontinuation  of  study 
medication. 
Dosimetry and radiation protection 
Dosimetry  analysis  was  performed  in  4  of  the  safety  studies,  the  investigator-sponsored  trial,  Study 
310863,  Study  311721,  and  Study  91790.  The  studyA42404  studied  the  safety  of  a  single  dose  of 
18Flabeled florbetaben (18F) with dosimetry evaluated in 3 HVs. The mean effective dose was found to 
be 14.70±1.40 microSv/MBq.  Study 310863 studied the safety of a single dose of florbetaben (18F) 
with dosimetry evaluated in 3 HVs. The mean effective dose was found to be 14.3±1.1 microSv/MBq.  
Study 91790 and study 311722 evaluated the biodistribution, radiation exposure, and effective dose of  
florbetaben  (18F)  in  18  healthy  Japanese  subjects    and  17  healthy  Caucasian  subjects,  respectively. 
The  mean  effective  dose  was  found  to  be  26.90±1.59  microSv/MBq  and  19.30±1.40  microSv/MBq, 
respectively. The mass dose difference (< 5 microg or > 50 to ≤ 55 microg for 300 MBq of florbetaben 
(18F))  did  not  affect  the  biodistribution  of  florbetaben  (18F)  and  the  resulting  exposure  to  radiation.  
No significant difference in radiation exposure or effective dose was found for the Caucasian subjects of 
Study 311722 when compared with both earlier studies. 
In the SmPC, detailed organ doses for all organs, as calculated using OLINDA software from Caucasian 
healthy  volunteers  (n=17),  are  listed  in  Table  7.  Dosimetry  calculations  were  adapted  to  the  adult 
model (with a body weight of 70 kg).

The  effective  dose  resulting  from  the  administration  of  a  maximal  recommended  activity  of  360 MBq 
dose for an adult weighing 70 kg is about 7.0 mSv. If a CT scan is simultaneously performed as part of 
the PET procedure, exposure to ionising radiation will increase in an amount dependent on the settings 
used  in  the  CT  acquisition.  For  an  administered  activity  of  380 MBq  the  typical  radiation  dose  to  the 
target organ (brain) is 4.5 mGy. 
For  an  administered  activity  of  360 MBq  the  typical  radiation  doses  delivered  to  the  critical  organs, 
gallbladder,  urinary  bladder,  upper  large  intestine  wall, lower large  intestine  wall,  small  intestine  and 
liver are 49.3 mGy, 25.0 mGy, 13.8 mGy, 12.6 mGy, 11.3 mGy and 13.9 mGy, respectively. 
Frequent bladder emptying should be encouraged after dosing to minimize radiation exposure. 
The SmPC does not include specifications related to radiation protection in the context of manipulation 
and elimination of the radiopharmaceutical by healthcare professionals, and radiation protection for the

1.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The overall number of patients exposed to florbetaben (18F) in the clinical trials sponsored by the 
company is small (n= 872), particularly considering the prevalence of AD in the general population. No 
post-marketing data is available since no marketing authorization had been issued in the world until 
the start date of this application procedure.    The company clarifies that safety data from all patients 
in the autopsy study who had already been performed a baseline florbetaben (18F) PET scan were 
included in the  assessment.   
The majority of subjects in the clinical development program received the dose recommended in 
clinical practice (i.e. 300 MBq ± 20%).  Most of patients received a mass dose of <10 microg/injection.  
The majority of studies included subjects with AD, DS, DEM, or MCI, as well as HVs and NDVs.  Most 
patients were under prior or concomitant medications.   
The final formulation that is proposed for marketing is different from the one used in the single pivotal 
study. Adverse reactions with both formulations are not serious, and are of somehow similar 
probability.  There was no hint suggesting that the local tolerability of Florbetaben suffered with the 
modifications which resulted in the new formulation.  
Florbetaben (18F) was generally well tolerated.  Related AEs were reported in 82 subjects (8.4%).  
Injection site pain was a common related AEs (n=37).  Other related AES occurring in less than 1% 
subjects were injection site irritation (n=12) and headache (n=7).  The company has fully listed all 
related AEs and their frequency in the safety database, and section 4.8. of the SmPC was modified 
accordingly.   
Only few serious adverse events have been reported (n=3), and none was drug-related.  No deaths 
were attributed to florbetaben (18F). 
The changes from baseline in clinical laboratory investigations and vital signs were not considered to 
be of clinical concern.    The company details 4 cases showing a clinical relevant ECG change from 
baseline following administration of placebo.  No clinically relevant increases in QT intervals post 
administration were observed in any of the four patients.  There were some cases in study 311722 and 
study 91790 of minor or borderline abnormalities in ECG parameters as well as cases of abnormal ECG 
diagnosis.  Most of them were already present at baseline or screening, and those new were observed 
only in single volunteers at isolated time points and represent minor abnormalities or borderline 
changes which gave no  indication of any possible pattern of treatment-emergent ECG abnormalities.  
No immunological events have occurred. 
The differences in safety in any subpopulation related to gender, age (in the range of 21-98), race and 
region are not considered to be of clinical significance.  The black subpopulation was not sufficiently 
represented in the clinical studies restricting the conclusions on potential differences in the safety 
results based on ethnicity.  No analyses were performed in subpopulations related to the concomitant 
use of AD medications; however, no clinically relevant drug interaction with comedications is expected. 
Safety of florbetaben (18F) was not different in patients with renal impairment compared to patients 
with normal renal function.   No analysis of subjects with altered hepatic function (i.e. elevated serum 
liver enzymes) has been performed.  In patients with either altered renal function or impaired hepatic 
function, the higher irradiation in the body caused by slower hepatic and/or renal clearance of the 
radiopharmaceutical itself or their radioactive metabolites should be taken into account and will be 
reflected in the SmPC in the sense that careful consideration of the activity to be administered is 
required.

Florbetaben (18F) is not expected to be used in women of child-bearing potential. 
Florbetaben (18F) is not indicated for use in the pediatric (age 18 years and below) population.  
No clinical studies to investigate interactions that may affect safety have been performed for 
florbetaben (18F).  No clinical studies to investigate interactions that may affect safety have been 
performed for florbetaben (18F).  Because florbetaben is administered as a single microdose resulting 
in low plasma concentrations, no clinically relevant drug interaction with comedications is expected. 
The human radiation dosimetry of florbetaben (18F) yields an effective dose of 0.0193 mSv/MBq. It is 
in the range of other approved radiopharmaceuticals. 
Specifications related to radiation protection in the context of manipulation and elimination of the 
radiopharmaceutical by healthcare professionals, and radiation protection for the family, are 
appropriate to be included in the SmPC and in accordance with those approved for other fluorine (18F) 
radiopharmaceuticals. 
As of April 10, 2013, in the pivotal autopsy study a total number of 216 patients underwent a first 
exposure, 82 of these patients had passed their second exposure and 23 patients had received a third 
PET-scan with Florbetaben injection. Therefore, a total of 321 florbetaben exposures are recorded in 
the phase 3 trial, which is still ongoing.  
Repeat doses of florbetaben were also administered in the study 312043.  Up to three doses were 
administered with an interval of one year between injections.  The estimated effective radiation dose of 
one injection of florbetaben 300 MBq in this study was 4.80 (3.8-5.8) mSv which was below the 
maximum yearly radiation exposure recommended by the local authorities in Australia where the study 
was conducted and in the range of other approved radiopharmaceuticals. The effective dose for 
florbetaben is 0.0193 mSv/MBq. The effective dose resulting from the administration of a maximal 
recommended activity of 360 MBq dose for an adult weighing 70 kg is about 7.0 mSv. Neuraceq is 
primarily intended for single use; however if indicated in selected patients a repeat investigation is 
considered possible provided that there is a sufficient time interval between investigations.   
The specifications of use of this radiopharmaceutical in pregnancy and lactation are to be drafted in 
line with the EMA core SmPC for radiopharmaceuticals. Florbetaben (18F) is not expected to be used in 
women of child-bearing potential. 
The paediatric use of florbetaben (18F) cannot be recommended, and is not expected. A full waiver to 
perform paediatric investigations was granted. 
1.7.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Florbetaben (18F) has been studied in a limited number of patients (safety population of completed 
clinical trials n=872). Overall, there were no significant safety signals identified with florbetaben (18F) 
PET imaging. 
The paediatric use of florbetaben (18F) is not recommended.  The use in patients with impaired renal 
function or impaired hepatic renal function should be prescribed after careful consideration of the 
higher irradiation to those patients.

2.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Florbetaben  (18F)  is  a  novel  radiopharmaceutical  which  has  been  developed  for  imaging  β-amyloid 
deposition by PET in the brain of adults who are being evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive 
decline.    The  definitive  diagnosis  of  AD  can  only  be  confirmed  post-mortem  by  detection  of  pre-
specified  levels  of  age-related  brain  β-amyloid  neuritic  plaque  density  at  autopsy  in  the  presence  of 
clinical history of dementia.  The antemortem initial diagnosis of AD in demented patients relies solely 
on  well-accepted  standardised  clinical  criteria  with  limited  sensitivity  and  specificity  that  allow  only 
diagnosing  patients  as  with  “probable  AD”.    This  clearly  shows  the  high  need  for  better  diagnostic 
procedures for AD in vivo. 
Until  recently,  no  method  for  detection  of  β-amyloid  deposition  in  the  brain  during  life  was  approved 
for  diagnostic  purposes.    In  the  case  where  a  PET  radiopharmaceutical is  used  for  in-vivo  imaging  β-
amyloid  neuritic  plaques  in  the  human  brain  in  patients  who  are  being  evaluated  for  AD  and  other 
causes  of  cognitive  impairment,    a  negative  scan  is  not  consistent  with  a  diagnosis  of  AD,  and  a 
positive PET scan does not independently establish a diagnosis of AD or other cognitive disorder, since 
neuritic  plaque  deposition  in  grey  matter  may  be  present  in  asymptomatic  elderly  and  some 
neurodegenerative dementias.   
For florbetaben (18F), the diagnostic performance was evaluated versus the histopathological diagnosis 
at autopsy of the β-amyloid deposition in the pivotal study 14595, and versus the clinical diagnosis in 
two supportive studies.   
Diagnostic  performance  was  the  primary  focus  of  the  pivotal  efficacy  study  14595  (n=216,  206 
autopsy cohort; 10 young healthy controls), which investigated the relationship between uptake on the 
PET image and the underlying true amyloid levels determined by post-mortem histopathology. Results 
from  the  co-primary  analyses  for  the  first  31  autopsied  patients  achieved  the  pre-specified  study 
Neuraceq 
EMA/5028/2014 
Page 109/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
objectives:  sensitivity  (77.4%;  95%CI:  65.4%–89.4%)  and  specificity  (94.2%;  95%CI:  88.6%–
99.8%).  The  ability  to  correctly  differentiate  between  brain  regions  with  and  without  β-amyloid 
deposition  by  using  visual  assessments  of  regional  florbetabene  (18F)  uptake  in  co-registered  PET 
based on autopsy data thus clearly exceeded the respective target value of 60% and 80%.  
Considering  the  visual  subject-level  assessment  of  non-co-registered  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images 
(which  is  the  one  recommended  in  clinical  practice),  sensitivity  (100%,  95%CI:  80.5  –  100%)  and 
specificity  (85.7%;  95%CI:  67.4%  –  100%)  of  the  majority  read  versus  the  neuropathological 
diagnosis clearly exceeded the target value for sensitivity in the first 31 autopsied patients.  So did in a 
post-hoc analysis of the first 74 autopsied patients from the pivotal study: sensitivity (97.9% (95%CI: 
93.8%-100%) and specificity (88.9% (95%CI: 77%-100%).  
Florbetaben  (18F)  likely  estimates  beta-amyloid  deposition,  and  therefore  contributes  additional 
information  that  is  not  yet  included  in  the  current  clinical  diagnostic  standard  of  AD.    In  the  current 
status  of  lack  of  reliable  and  validated  biomarkers  and  the  non-feasibility  of  biopsies,  this  kind  of 
accurate  information  on  amyloid  burden  is  not  available  by  any  other  approach  apart  from  PET 
radiopharmaceuticals for beta-amyloid imaging (which, if achieving a reasonable level of sensitivity on 
a  subject-level  basis,  can  exclude  a  diagnosis  of  AD).    Moreover,  information  on  amyloid  burden  is 
made  available  for  the  physician  at  a  time  when  this  information  may  still  be  useful  for  patients’ 
management decisions (i.e. prior to autopsy). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The dossier has not clearly elucidated in vivo how and which of the different types of beta-amyloid and 
other  relevant  structures  are  traced  or  not  traced  by  florbetaben  (18F)  in  the  brain,  to  assess  how 
useful/misleading  tracing  them  might  be  for  efficacy  of  the  radiopharmaceutical  in  the  proposed 
indication.  In  the  pivotal  autopsy  study,  correlation  between  in  vivo  florbetaben  (18F)  uptake  values 
and the quantitative levels of amyloid deposition at autopsy was not assessed quantitatively.   
Florbetaben  (18F)  is  not  a  stand-alone  diagnostic  tool,  and  needs  to  be  used  in  conjunction  with  a 
clinical evaluation. 
Florbetaben  (18F)  is  proposed  not  only  as  a  marker  of  β-amyloid  deposition  in  the  brain,  but  also  for 
diagnostic  purposes  of  AD.      This  objective  is  pursued  in  few  supportive  studies.    In  those  studies, 
sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the  visual  reading  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  uptake  in    probable  AD  and 
MCI subjects are handicapped by the limitations of the clinical diagnostic criteria used as standard.  In 
supportive  studies,  the  value  of  florbetaben  (18F)  was  not  specifically  assessed  for  the  differential 
diagnosis  of  either  probable  AD  versus  other  dementia  subtypes,  or  MCI  versus  other  causes  of 
cognitive impairment. 
In addition, the company does not present compelling evidence from longitudinal long-term phase III 
trials  in  the  intended  population  to  confirm  that  florbetaben  (18F)  allows  either  confirmation  of  AD 
pathology  (whatever  it  means)  or  exclusion  of  AD  in  combination  with  other  diagnostic  evaluations.  
This would include differential diagnosis between AD and the most common non-AD dementias likely to 
be  confused  with  AD  (including  Lewy  body  dementia,  vascular  dementia  and  some  cases  of 
frontotemporal dementia), and diagnosis of AD in those circumstances of particular uncertainty such as 
early  stages  of  the  disease  or  atypical  presentations  (asymmetric,  frontal  variants,  posterior  cortical 
degeneration, and a single positive abnormal region).  
Intensive research is currently ongoing to move the diagnosis of AD earlier in life. So recently, MCI was 
proposed  as  a  nosological  entity  in  elderly  patients  with  mild  cognitive  deficits  but  without  the 
complete picture of dementia.  It is not settled yet if MCI as an episodic memory impaired group is an 
intermediate  stage  that  a  patient  with  AD  will  pass  through  before  becoming  demented.  For 
florbetaben (18F), very limited data were submitted in MCI patients (only 45 MCI patients from study 
Neuraceq 
EMA/5028/2014

312043  assessed  for  their  conversion  rate  to  probable  AD  over  a  short  2-year  follow-up  period),  and 
no data for predicting development of AD or monitoring response to therapy have been provided. 
Actual  impact  of  florbetaben  (18F)  PET  on  diagnostic  thinking  and/or  patient  management  has  not 
been demonstrated.  Further to this, it remains unclear whether a tangible benefit for the patients can 
be expected from a change in patient management.  Nowadays, in the absence of treatments to stop 
or revert AD: 
• 
• 
The clinical benefit to the patient brought by early AD diagnosis is unclear 
In false negative cases, omitting/delaying treatment is not crucial, and florbetaben (18F) would 
not  avoid  other  diagnostic  tests  (e.g.  MRI,  CT,  blood  tests,  etc.)  since  they  are  generally 
performed  before  PET  to  exclude  non-neurodegenerative  dementias  when  suspicious  of  AD 
exists. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
As the exposure to florbetaben (18F) is limited, there were no significant safety signals identified with 
florbetaben (18F) PET imaging.  From clinical studies, the most frequently reported treatment related 
adverse events were all related to time for Neuraceq dose administration as a single iv bolus injection. 
Accordingly, injection site pain, injection site irritation and injection site erythema were all reported as 
common. In response to the D120 LoQ, the applicant has discussed the potential local irritating effect 
of  florbetaben  based  on  the  TEAEs  and  ADRs  reported.  Section  4.2  of  the  SmPC  has  been  amended 
with instructions aimed to reduce the risk for local reactions.  
Exposure  to  florbetaben  (18F)  implies  radiation  exposure  of  the  patient.    It  is  in  the  range  of  other 
approved radiopharmaceuticals. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
False positive findings in the detection of beta amyloid deposition, with the possible consequence of a 
wrong  diagnosis  of  MCI/AD  (and  its  consequences),  cannot  be  excluded.  The  impact  of  reader’s 
subjectivity on the subjective interpretation of florbetaben (18F) PET images was obvious even in the 
controlled  setting  of  the  clinical  trials,  and  could  not  be  completely  eliminated  by  training.    It  is 
unknown what extent of either inter-reader variability or of individual readers with a high rate of wrong 
readings must be expected in a “real world setting” regardless of any training provided.  Similarly, it is 
unclear  to  what  extent  any  reached  success  of  the  reader’s  training  in  the  clinical  trials  may  be 
representative  for  the  effect  of  a  training  of  users  post-marketing.  Whereas  the  radiation  exposure 
appears  acceptable,  a  further  minimization  might  be  possible.    However,  as  dose-finding  studies  of 
florbetaben  (18F)  were  not  performed,  it  is  not  clear  whether  a  lower  dose  might  be  used  with  the 
same imaging quality. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
As a non-invasive method for visualization and neuroanatomical localization of β-amyloid deposition in 
the  brain  antemortem,  the  potential  value  of  florbetaben  (18F)  in  the  diagnostic  approach  of  AD  (for 
differential  diagnosis,  early  diagnosis,  other  diagnostic  purposes)  is  of  paramount  importance.  
However, it is still unknown to which type of amyloid deposition florbetaben (18F) refers to.   
With no relevant adverse events, and since therapeutic consequences of the diagnosis of labelling brain 
beta-amyloid  are  not  obvious,  in  the  absence  of  both  disease  modifying  treatment  in  any  non-
degenerative  dementia  syndrome  and  treatments  for  early  intervention  to  prevent  widespread  and 
irreversible neuropathological changes, early misdiagnosis of MCI/AD due to false positive readings of 
florbetaben  (18F)  PET  images  could  easily  create  serious  personal/social  problems  worse  than 
moderately postponing the diagnosis.

Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Until recently, histopathological methods in autopsied samples were the only available tool to estimate 
neuritic  plaque  density  in  the  brain.  The  availability  of  a  radiopharmaceutical  which  could  provide 
estimation  on  that  when  the  patient  is  still  alive  is  considered  a  significant  improvement  in  the 
diagnostic procedures for adult patients who are being evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive 
impairment.    In  this  sense,  the  presence  of  none  to  scarce  β-amyloid  neuritic  plaque  density  in  the 
brain is not compatible with a diagnosis of AD; however, the opposite is not true since there might be 
β-amyloid  deposition  in  the  brain  in  asymptomatic  elderly  and  other  neurodegenerative  demented 
patients. 
The sensitivity and specificity of florbetaben (18F) in detecting the presence of β-amyloid deposition in 
the brain were convincingly demonstrated by the results from study 14595, the results from supportive 
study  16034,  and  the  post-hoc  analysis  in  which  the  pivotal  study  14595  expanded  to  include  the 
additional  patients,  even  though  initially  there  were  a  number  of  limitations  identified  in  the  primary 
analysis of the pivotal study 14595. The company performed a re-reading (“New Read Study”) of the 
pivotal  autopsy  study,  with  new  readers  trained  by  the  electronic  training.    The  PET  scan  reading 
results were compared to the onsite pathology assessment collected for the 81 subjects. This analysis 
provided additional supportive data and made this subset comparable to the post-hoc analysis data of 
study 14595, using in-person trained readers.   
Regardless  of  the  fact  that  it  was  not  shown  which  type  of  amyloid  deposition  was  being  visualised, 
and that the correlation between in vivo quantitative values of brain uptake of florbetaben (18F) and 
levels of amyloid deposition at autopsy were not assessed, the available data supported the claim that 
the  radiopharmaceutical  can  reliably  detect  the  presence  or  absence  of  β-amyloid  in  the  intended 
population (the latter being of paramount importance for the clinical practice). 
Unfortunately it was not shown how a change in the diagnosis after florbetaben (18F) PET scan result 
could lead to either an altered treatment strategy, or other measures translating in a tangible clinical 
benefit for the patients. For that reason it was recommended that the company assess the impact of 
florbetaben (18F) PET on diagnostic thinking and patient management. 
The  risk  of  false  positive  readings  still  remains  an  issue,  which  may  result  in  the  wrong  diagnosis  of 
AD.    It  should  be  highlighted  that  florbetaben  (18F)  is  to  be  used  under  “restricted”  conditions,  as 
described in the SmPC, and that the acquired PET scans are to be perceived as an additional diagnostic 
tool rather than the source of medical truth in the diagnostic process.  
The  safety  profile  of  florbetaben  (18F)  was  reassuring,  despite  of  the  relatively  low  numbers  of  the 
available  safety  database,  with  the  most  common  adverse  events  being  related  to  injection  site 
reactions.  
Taking into account all of the above, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance of  florbetaben 
(18F)  to  be  used  for  PET  imaging  of  β-amyloid  neuritic  plaque  density  in  the  brains  of  adult  patients 
with cognitive impairment, who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of 
cognitive impairment, is positive.

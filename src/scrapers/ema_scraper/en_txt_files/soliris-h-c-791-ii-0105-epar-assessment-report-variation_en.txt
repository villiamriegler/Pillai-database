version 19 has also been submitted. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Soliris was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/13/1185 on 05 August 2013 in the following 
indication: treatment of neuromyelitis optica (NMO). During the development of eculizumab, there has 
been a change in classification of the designated orphan condition. On 21 Dec 2018, Alexion Europe SAS 
submitted an ODD amendment to align the designated orphan indication to the current classification, i.e. 
"Treatment of Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder". 
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above-mentioned orphan 
designation. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0364/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0364/2018 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous 
system characterized by severe immune-mediated neuro-axonal injury predominantly targeting optic 
nerves and spinal cord (Stellmann JP, et al. JNNP 2017;0:1–9).  
 
 
 
The incidence of NMOSD ranges from 0.053 to 0.4 per 100,000 individuals with prevalence rates from 
0.52 to 4.4 per 100,000. NMOSD is more prevalent among non-Caucasians and 5 to 10 times more often 
in women than men int recurrent form of this condition (Stellmann JP, et al. JNNP 2017;0:1–9). 
In 2015, The International Panel for NMO Diagnosis revised diagnostic criteria based on autoantibodies 
against aquaporin-4 (AQP4-IgG) status (Wingerchuk DM et al. Neurology 2015;85(2):177-189). Approximately 80% 
of the patients with NMOSD have pathogenic serum autoantibodies AQP4-IgG (Jarius S, Clin Exp Immunol 2014 
176:149–64) and around 20–30% of NMOSD patients have a co-existing immune-mediated disease and 
autoantibodies other than anti-AQP4 can be detected in up to 40% (Kitley J et al. Brain 2012: 135; 1834-1849). In 
patients with positive AQP4-IgG status, a diagnosis of NMOSD can be made if at least one of the three 
core clinical characteristic of NMOSD is present and after excluding alternative diagnosis. The three-core 
characteristic includes the classical syndromes of optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse 
myelitis (LETM) and a more recently described area postrema syndrome core syndrome characterized by 
intractable episodes of hiccups or nausea and vomiting. When AQP4 antibodies are absent or where 
serologic testing is unavailable, the presence of two core characteristics and additional neuroimaging 
findings are required for diagnosis of NMOSD (Wingerchuk DM et al. Neurology 2015;85(2):177-189).  
AQP4 is a water channel that is predominantly expressed on the cell membrane of astrocytic end-feet, 
forming part of the blood–brain barrier. In NMOSD, antibodies binding AQP4 downregulates AQP4 and 
causes astrocytic injury through activation of the classical complement pathway. Antibody-complement 
complex formation results in chemotaxis of T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and 
eosinophils, principally through activation of NFκB. Demyelination and oligodendrocyte injury occur as a 
secondary effect of this immune response (Broadley S, et al L, ACNR 2017;17(1):11-14).  
Nearly 90% of the patients had a relapsing course of NMOSD with a clinical pattern characterized by 
recurrent attacks preferentially in the brainsteam, optic nerves and spinal cords. On average, relapses 
tend to occur within the first year following an initial event in 60% of patients and within three years in 
90%. In NMOSD, relapses are typically severe with incomplete recovery leading to rapid development of 
disability (Kitley J et al. Brain 2012: 135; 1834-1849).  
Initial or recurrent episodes are usually treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone. 
Therapeutic plasmapheresis is effective in patients with severe symptoms that fail to improve or progress 
despite treatment with corticosteroids (Sellner J et al. EJN 2010, 17: 1019–1032).  
In order to prevent subsequent relapses, patients with NMOSD require immunosuppression. In this light, 
there is evidence that immunomodulatory therapies used for MS appear to aggravate NMO (Mealy MA, et al. 
JAMA Neurol. 2014;71(3):324–330). The current standard of care in NMOSD includes the use of azathioprine, 
mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab for which there is evidence supporting effectivity coming from 
observational studies. However, no controlled randomized trials of immunosuppressive therapies have 
been conducted for NMOSD. Consequently, there is an unmet need for this orphan condition. 
Eculizumab (Soliris®) is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the human complement 
component 5 (C5), inhibiting C5 enzymatic cleavage and thereby preventing the generation of the 
proinflammatory/prothrombotic complement activation products C5a and the cytolytic and 
proinflammatory/prothrombotic membrane attack complex C5b-9 that are responsible for the 
inflammatory consequences of terminal complement activation (Rother RP et al Nat Biotechnol. 2007 
Nov;25(11):1256-64.). Eculizumab (Soliris®) is approved for use in 3 complement-mediated diseases, 
namely paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and 
generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in many regions including the European Union, the United States, 
Japan, and Canada.  
The following additional indication is proposed:  
Soliris® (eculizumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with neuromyelitis optica 
spectrum disorder (NMOSD) who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody-positive. 
The dosing regimen is identical for patients with NMOSD to that approved for the treatment of adult 
patients (≥  18 years of age) with aHUS and gMG. The dosing regimen consists of a 4-week initial phase 
followed by a maintenance phase: 
• Initial phase: 900 mg of Soliris® administered via a 25–45-minute intravenous (IV) infusion 
every week for the first 4 weeks. 
• Maintenance phase: 1,200 mg of Soliris® administered via a 25–45-minute IV infusion for the 
fifth week, followed by 1,200 mg of Soliris® administered via a 25 - 45-minute IV infusion every 
14 ± 2 days. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The scope and legal basis of the CHMP guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) with effective date of December 2006, states that 
vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted of 
environmental risk assessment because, due to their nature they are unlikely to result in significant risk 
to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. As Eculizumab is a protein, no Environmental Risk Assessment is needed for this type II variation. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP

and  LLOQ  adjusted  18.8  μg/mL  (all  BLQ  results  on  truncated  plates  were 
re-analysed). 
Storage Stability 
Samples  were  analysed  within  1240  days  of  collection.  Additional  stability 
testing is ongoing to cover the duration of sample storage. Stability testing is 
ongoing under MPI Research Study Number 1727-112 to cover the duration of 
sample storage. At the time of this report, 15 of 3,037 total samples require 
validation of storage duration. 
Samples 
A  total  of  3,037  study  samples  were  analysed  for  eculizumab.  Reportable 
results were not obtained for two samples due to insufficient sample quantity.  
ISR 
Reproducibility  of  incurred  samples  was  performed,  and  the  results  met 
acceptance criteria (≤ 30%) with a pass rate of 81.4%.  
A total of 3,037 study samples were analysed for eculizumab in 197 runs. Out of these, sixty-three (63) 
runs were rejected due to QCs and/or calibrations standards did not meet the acceptance criteria, due to 
exceeding incubation time or contamination or plating error. 
Calibration Curve Standards 
For eculizumab, with each calibration curve, samples were analysed in each batch with seven calibrators 
in duplicate (plus to anchor point 4.69 and 1200 µg/mL). 
In all valid runs, eighteen (18) calibration standards were rejected. No more than two was rejected at the 
same run, although for runs 91, 95, 105. 127, 158 and 160, both LLOQ replicates were rejected and the 
calibration curve was truncated and the LLOQ adjusted 18.8 μg/mL. 
Correlation coefficients (r2) were ≥ 0.9972.  
The between-run precision (%RSD) and accuracy (%RE) ranged from 2.6% to 8.7% and from -3.2% to 
3.3%, respectively. 
Quality Control Sample 
For eculizumab, with each calibration curve, samples were analysed in each batch with three QCs (i.e., 
25, 100 and 480 µg/mL) in quadruplicate. 
In all valid runs, there were one hundred and ten (110) QCs out of the acceptance range. No more than 
four was rejected at the same run and at least 50% at each concentration level met de acceptance 
criteria. 
The between-run precision (%RSD) and accuracy (%RE) ranged from 7.6% to 18.9% and from -8.8% to 
10.0%, respectively. 
 
 
A total of 512 samples were re-analysed due to the following reasons 
•  Above Limit of Quantitation ALQ (422 samples) 
•  Below truncated LLQ (26 samples) 
•  HCV, ALQ (3 samples) 
• 
PK/TK Request (24 samples). Out of these, 10 samples had a greater than 30% difference 
between the original and final reported values, and 3 samples had BLQ values. The reported 
values are presented in the Table 3.

Reproducibility of Incurred Samples 
No ISR was performed. 
3. Haemolytic Activity Analysis  
The method assesses the complement activity in human serum via activation of the classical pathway. 
This assay measures the haemoglobin release from sensitized chicken red blood cells (cRBCs) due to lysis 
by the human terminal complement complex (C5b-9) deposited on the surface of these cells. The 
haemolysis of QC and test samples were normalized to the positive control standard and reported as 
percent haemolysis using the following formula: ([ODsample-ODSample EDTA control] ÷ 
[ODPC-ODNC])*100). A summary of the bioanalytical results is displayed in Table 5.

Storage Stability 
Samples were analysed within 1,323 days of collection. 
At  the  time  of  this  report,  34  of  3,033  total  samples  required  validation  of 
storage  duration.  168  haemolysis  samples  were  reanalysed  “due  to  a  PK 
reason” and 74 samples had divergent results upon reanalysis.  
Samples 
A total of 3,033 human serum samples were collected in both eculizumab and 
placebo treated patients. In the eculizumab treatment group, the number of 
haemolytic samples analysed and included in the dataset was 2,114 (out of 
total 2,128). There were 14 samples analysed but not included in the dataset 
due to non-reportable results for analytical reasons (e.g. insufficient sample 
volume).   
 
 
These samples were analyzed for hemolytic activity in 229 runs. Out of these runs, 34 runs were rejected 
due to PC, NC, HHS, MHS, and/or LHS control did not meet the acceptance criteria.  Quality control 
samples performed within the acceptance criteria established in method validation (Table 6).

3. Free C5 in human serum 
The concentration of free (unbound) C5 in serum samples was measured using an ECL assay. Eculizumab 
was used as the capture reagent and the non-competitive anti-human C5 antibody N19/8, conjugated 
with MSD SULFO-TAG, was used for detection (please refer to the validation report 1727-114). The 
quantitation range for the assay was 0.00274 to 20.00 µg/mL of C5 in serum. A summary of the 
bioanalytical results is displayed in Table 7.

Storage Stability 
Samples were analysed within 1,189 days of collection. Stability testing 
is ongoing under MPI Research Study Number 1727-114(1) to cover the 
duration of sample storage. At the time of this report, 12 of 3,033 total 
samples required validation of storage duration.  
Samples 
A  total  of  3,033  samples  collected  in  both  eculizumab  and  placebo 
treated  patients.  In  the  eculizumab  treatment  group,  the  number  of 
free-C5 samples analysed and included in the dataset was 2126 (out of 
total  2128).  There  were  2  samples  analysed  but  not  included  in  the 
dataset  (<0.1%  of  total  samples  analysed)  due  to  non-reportable 
results for analytical reasons (e.g. insufficient sample volume).     
 
 
 
 
These samples were performed in 131 runs. Out of these runs, sixteen runs were rejected due to QCs 
and/or CS did not meet the acceptance criteria. 
Calibration Curve Standards 
For Free C5, with each calibration curve, samples were analysed in each batch with seven calibrators in 
duplicate (anchor point 0.00914 µg/mL). 
In all valid runs, both replicates of intermediate concentration (0.0823 µg/mL) were rejected in run 95. 
Correlation coefficients (r2) were ≥ 0.9969. 
The between-run precision (%RSD) and accuracy (%RE) ranged from 2.5% to 8.4% and from -1.1% to 
3.5%, respectively. 
Quality Control Sample 
For Free C5, with each calibration curve, samples were analysed in each batch with three QCs (i.e., 0.060, 
0.200 and 15.000 µg/mL) in quadruplicate. 
In all valid runs, there were sixty-three (63) QCs out of the acceptance range. No more than four were 
rejected at the same run, although in run 95 and run 98, there were five QCs out of the acceptance range 
and three of them correspond to the LQC. In addition, run 121 did not meet the acceptance criteria (at 
least 50% at each concentration level must have accuracy within ±20%) since only one LQC meet the 
acceptance criteria. 
The between-run precision (%RSD) and accuracy (%RE) ranged from 8.0% to 37.6% (including outlier) 
and from-6.0% to 10.0%, respectively. 
A total of 250 samples were re-analysed due to the following reasons: 
•  High within sample %RSD 
•  Diluted Sample, BLQ result 
•  Above Limit of Quantitation ALQ 
•  Quantity Not Sufficient QNS 
• 
Inadvertent Reanalysis 
•  Reconciliation Repeat 
• 
PK/TK Request.  Although, the re-analysis of samples for PK reasons is not acceptable, only one 
sample resulted in a change in categorization from complete terminal complement inhibition (ie, 
originally reported as BLQ) to partial or no terminal complement inhibition (ie, reported serum 
free C5 concentration of 80.8μg/mL) (Table 8).

4. Free C5 in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
The concentration of free (unbound) C5 in CSF was measured using an ECL assay derived from the serum 
assay. Eculizumab was used as the capture reagent and the non-competitive anti-human C5 antibody 
N19/8, conjugated with MSD SULFO-TAG, was used for detection (please refer to method validation 
report 1727-116). The quantitation range for the assay was 3.00 to 400 ng/mL of C5 in CSF. A summary 
of the bioanalytical results is displayed in Table 9.

5. Immunogenicity Assay Analysis Summary 
Antidrug antibodies (ADA) to eculizumab were measured using a solution phase bridging assay with ECL 
detection. This method was performed with 2 eculizumab-derived reagents, biotin conjugated eculizumab 
(Ec-Bio) for capture and SULFO-TAG-conjugated eculizumab (Ec-STAG) for detection. The method 
utilized a tiered approach, with a screening assay designed to produce a 5% false positive rate and a 
confirmatory step designed to produce a 1% false positive rate, to identify samples as positive or negative 
for the presence of ADA to eculizumab. The assay was validated by MPI Research (Mattawan MI, USA) as 
described in the validation report 1727-118. A summary of the bioanalytical results is displayed in Table

7. Deviations and investigation occurred during the study 
The following deviations occurred from the study plan. 
7.1 Sample Deviations 
Per the study plan, study samples should be stored in a freezer set to -70°C. Several days a freezer 
containing study samples rose above the study plan-specified maximum temperature with a peak 
between -39.9 °C and -58.2 °C. 
7.2 PK investigations and deviations 
The following PK investigation occurred during the study. 
• 
• 
Event-17-20065 and Event-18-04462: due to consecutive run failures in the serum assay, 
investigations were conducted under MPI Research Study Number 1727-112. While no root cause 
could be identified for the failures, automation was implemented for the preparation of standard 
curves to confer additional accuracy and reproducibility. 
Event-17-15418: plate maps should reflect the actual plating location of samples. In runs 113 of 
the serum assay, the plate map was not updated prior to the upload of data. The run was rejected 
and repeated. 
7.3 Haemolytic Activity Deviations: 
The following unplanned deviation occurred as the result of an unintended deviation from the study plan. 
Per the study plan, samples should have been analysed per their arrival demarcation. Samples labelled 
for PK or free C5 were analysed for haemolytic activity in run 45. All sample aliquots for a specific time 
point are generated from a single blood draw and processing, so there is no impact to the data produced. 
7.4 Free Complement Factor 5 investigation and deviations 
The following deviation occurred during the study. 
• 
Event-17-15507: a single result on run 40 of the free C5 in serum assay was anomalous. The 
sample was analysed in duplicate using a backup aliquot, and the result on run 40 was confirmed 
to be anomalous. 
 
 
• 
• 
Event-17-15510: multiple samples on run 46 of the free C5 in serum assay had results that were 
inconsistent with the subject profile. A plating error was suspected, and all results from run 46 
were rejected and the samples repeated. 
Event-17-1546: per the method for free C5 in serum, the assay plate should be incubated for 60 
minutes after the addition of the detection reagent. In run 50, the plate was incubated for 4 
minutes. Run 50 was aborted, and samples were analysed in a subsequent run. 
7.5 ADA Deviations 
The following deviation occurred during the study. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Event-17-14120: analytical runs 7 and 9 were built in Watson IRM without appropriate controls. 
The error was noted after upload of data. Due to limitations within Watson IRM, data for runs 7 
and 9 were uploaded as runs 41 and 42. 
Event-17-16967: for immunodepletion assessments, the unfortified sample typically has a higher 
signal than the fortified sample. In runs 44 and 45, most samples had signals opposite the 
standard pattern. Runs 44 and 45 were rejected, and all samples were repeated on later runs. 
Upon repeat, all samples showed the typical decrease in signal when test article was present. 
Event-18-11925: due to insufficient sample volume, a sample on run 78 was replaced after issue 
of the dataset. The change in sample container number was made on the paper dataset but not 
Watson. After data was uploaded, the error was noted. Run 78 was rejected and recreated as run 
79 in Watson, with the correct sample containers 
Event-17-1087: in run 31, confirmatory controls were documented as being prepared incorrectly. 
The run was rejected, and samples were repeated in a subsequent run. 
7.6 NAb Deviations 
An insignificant method deviation was acknowledged by the Bioanalytical Monitor and documented in the 
raw data. 
2.3.2.3.  Population-PK analysis 
A population-PK analysis was performed using all eculizumab-treated patients included in Study 
ECU-NMO-301 for which at least 1 quantifiable eculizumab concentration was available. 
Total serum (bound plus free) concentrations of eculizumab were quantified using a validated assay 
(IM-1727-112). Total CSF (bound plus free) concentrations of eculizumab were quantified using a 
validated assay (IM-1727-113). 
Model development was carried out using first-order, conditional estimation with interaction. The 
2-compartment model with first-order elimination, including time-variant body weight effects and 
plasmapheresis/plasma exchange effects, was defined as the base model and was the starting point for 
the covariate assessment. A full covariate search was performed on the base model to evaluate the 
impact of covariates on PK. Visual predictive check (VPC) and non-parametric bootstrap analyses were 
performed to evaluate model performance and robustness. 
A total of 96 patients treated with eculizumab from Study ECU-NMO-301 were available, with a total of 
2130 PK observations and 4660 dosing records. In addition, 15 plasmapheresis/plasma exchange events 
were recorded for 4 eculizumab-treated patients in Study ECU-NMO-301. One eculizumab-treated patient 
(0294-002) was excluded from the population-PK because no PK assessments were available. Another 
patient (all 6 PK samples) was excluded due to an unusual PK profile (0177-002). There was 1 pre-first 
dose sample with eculizumab concentration above LLOQ (for Patient 0370-003), which was excluded from 
the population-PK analysis. Furthermore, there were 101 samples below the limit of quantitation (BLQ), 
mostly from pre-first dose samples that were excluded.  The previously developed 2-compartment model 
with clearances and volumes of distribution allometrically scaled by body weight (gMG patient population, 
ECU-MG-Adult PK-PD Modelling Report Addendum ECU-MG-302) was fitted to the Study ECU-NMO-301 
data as a starting model. To account for the extended treatment duration in Study ECU-NMO-301 (up to 
204 weeks), body weight was included as a time-variant covariate. The model included a 
plasmapheresis/plasma exchange effect on eculizumab CL (additive effect) to account for changes in CL 
due to plasmapheresis/plasma exchange procedures.  The exploration of potential covariate effects 
showed no trends between covariates of interest and CL or central volume of distribution (V1), except for 
albumin and gender on V1 (Figure 1) that were the only 2 covariates showing a p-value close to 0.01. No 
other available covariates were found to influence eculizumab exposure.  
Figure 1 Inter-Individual variability Central volume of distribution versus Covariate Plots 
To determine the contribution of these covariates, a search was performed within NONMEM using 
stepwise forward addition (threshold p=0.01) followed by backward elimination (threshold p=0.001) for 
these 2 potential covariates. Neither of them met the criteria to be retained in the model. 
Other explored covariates included: age, race, Japanese origin, height, body mass index (BMI), estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine (SCr), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate 
transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, lymphocytes, anti-aquaporin-4 antibody 
(anti-AQP4 Ab) at baseline, historical ARR in the prior 24 months, EDSS at baseline, immunosuppressive 
therapy (IST) status at baseline, primary IST medication at baseline, region, anti-anaemic medication, 
systemic antibacterial medication, antihypertensive medication, and anti-infective medication. 
The Final population-PK model parameter estimates are presented in Table 12.

2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
2.3.3.1.  Methods 
A population pharmacokinetic modelling and exposure-response analysis for eculizumab in patients with 
NMOSD has been developed. The clinical data for analyses described in this report were from Phase 3 
Study ECU-NMO-301. 
The primary objective of this modelling analysis was to demonstrate that the dosing regimen used in 
Study ECU-NMO-301 (i.e., 900 mg intravenous [IV] once per week for the first 4 weeks followed by 1200 
mg IV 1 week later and then once every 2 weeks thereafter) achieves immediate, complete, and 
sustained terminal complement inhibition in the NMOSD patient population.  
Other objectives included:  
•  To explore the PK/PD relationships for the primary efficacy endpoint (time to first adjudicated On-trial 
Relapse) and sensitivity analysis (time to first On-trial Relapse as determined by the Treating 
Physician).  
•  To explore the PK/PD relationships for selected secondary efficacy endpoints (adjudicated On-trial 
ARR and the sensitivity analysis of On-trial ARR [as determined by the Treating Physician] as well as 
change from Baseline to EOS for EDSS, mRS, and HAI).  
•  To explore exposure-response relationships across the treatment population for safety endpoints 
(treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest (TEAESIs) defined as infections 
[meningococcal infections, Aspergillus infections, other serious infection, or sepsis], infusion 
reactions, serious cutaneous adverse reactions, cardiac disorders, and angioedema) as well as 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that occurred in ≥ 5% of the eculizumab-treated 
patients). This analysis was also aimed to investigate if any dose adjustments were required for 
special populations based on intrinsic and extrinsic factors identified to be influential with respect to 
PK, PK/PD, or exposure-response relationship. 
The analysis populations included the following datasets: 
•  Population-PK/PD analysis dataset for free C5 and hemolysis: All eculizumab-treated patients dosed 
in Study ECU-NMO-301 with at least 1 time-matched PK and free C5 assessment or hemolysis, 
respectively  
•  Population-PK-Efficacy analysis dataset: All eculizumab-treated patients from the FAS for whom 
posthoc PK parameters were available as well as all placebo-treated patients from the FAS. Here, FAS 
refers to all patients who were randomized to treatment and who have received at least 1 dose of 
study drug, as defined in protocol. 
•  Population-PK-Safety analysis dataset: This dataset contained all eculizumab-treated patients from 
the FAS for whom posthoc PK parameters were available as well as all placebo-treated patients from 
the FAS. Here, FAS refers to all patients who were randomized to treatment and who received at least 
1 dose of study drug, as defined in protocol. 
Serum free C5 concentration was quantified using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
Cerebrospinal fluid free C5 concentration was quantified using a validated assay. Measurement of 
haemolytic activity as % cRBC hemolysis was performed using a validated qualitative method. 
A.  PK/PD Analysis for Free C5 and Haemolytic Activity: Exploratory plots were generated and 
summary statistics were calculated for free C5 and haemolytic activity by visit. Because complete 
inhibition was achieved in almost all eculizumab-treated patients, the data are insufficient for 
development of PK/PD models for either free C5 or haemolytic activity. Therefore, PK/PD modelling 
for free C5 and haemolytic activity was not performed. The eculizumab threshold concentration to 
achieve complete terminal complement inhibition established previously using population-PK/PD data 
from the generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) Phase 3 registration trial was used as a benchmark to 
assess the relationship between eculizumab exposures and PD endpoints. 
B.  Exposure-Response Analysis for Efficacy Endpoints: For the primary endpoint, Kaplan-Meier 
relapse free survival plots were generated and the incidence was tabulated by exposure quartiles to 
explore exposure effects. In addition, exploratory exposure-response plots were generated for the 
secondary endpoints. Linear regression analysis was applied to explore exposure-response trends for 
efficacy endpoints. 
C.  Exposure-Response Analysis for Safety Endpoints: Occurrence of TEAEIS and TEAEs was 
tabulated by treatment and by exposure quartiles. 
D.  Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid Eculizumab Concentrations: In exploratory analysis, the 
eculizumab CSF concentration in the subset of patients who consented to CSF sampling was 
summarized. Line plots for individual patients were generated. Population analysis of CSF PK was not 
planned to be conducted because only a limited number of patients were expected to consent to 
collection of CSF samples through lumbar puncture.

values for these 2 ADA positive samples were low and transient in time; subsequent samples were 
negative for ADA screening and had no impact on population-PK or PK/PD analyses and on efficacy 
(Figure 5).

Free C5 Analysis:  
Figure 6 showing time-matched free C5 and eculizumab concentrations for eculizumab-treated patients 
confirmed that at the achieved exposure range in Study ECU-NMO-301, free C5 concentrations are 
reduced below the threshold of 0.5μg/mL. Complete, and sustained terminal complement inhibition was 
achieved in eculizumab-treated patients from Study ECU-NMO-301 as shown by Figure 7. A total of 13 
(0.6%) out of 2031 free C5 concentrations assessed post the first eculizumab dose in the 
eculizumab-treated patients were above the threshold of 0.5μg/mL. Eight out of the 13 free C5 samples 
came from same patient.

Haemolysis Analysis: 
Figure 8 showing time-matched haemolysis and eculizumab concentrations for eculizumab-treated 
patients confirmed that the distribution of the data did not allow further characterization of the 
exposure-response profile and would have had not enable estimation of an EC50 in case of fitting an Emax 
model. 
Figure 9 showed that at each visit the percentage of patients with haemolysis below the threshold of 20% 
at trough for eculizumab was≥ 97%, except for Weeks 72, 108, 120, and 132 at which the number 
(percentage) of patients with haemolysis below 20% was 55/57 (96.5%), 30/32 (93.8%), 26/29 
(89.7%), and 23/24 (95.8%), respectively.

CSF Free C5 Concentrations: 
 
 
The subset of patients for which CSF samples were available consisted of 8 eculizumab- (one patient did 
not have study day 1 CSF sample) and 2 placebo-treated patients. However, post first dose CSF samples 
at scheduled visits were only available for 4 eculizumab-treated patients (Table 13).

Data Exploration – Anti-Aquaporin 4 Antibody 
Eculizumab serum concentrations were similar across the 4 anti-AQP4 Ab titer levels (Figure 11)

B Exposure-Response Analysis  
1.- Primary Efficacy Endpoint (Time to First Adjudicated On-trial Relapse) and Sensitivity Analysis (Time 
to First On-trial Relapse as Determined by the Treating Physician). 
To explore primary efficacy endpoint, the eculizumab-treated patients were binned into 4 quartiles (Q1 
AUCss: 58714 – 143644 μg*h/mL; Q2 AUCss: 144679 –179692 μg*h/mL; Q3 AUCss: 181113 – 216888 
μg*h/mL; and Q4 AUCss: 218938 – 331373 μg*h/mL) of AUC at steady state exposure bins and 
compared with the placebo group overall. Figure 12 showed a clear separation between the placebo 
relapse free survival curve and those corresponding to the eculizumab quartiles for both analyses 
supporting efficacy of Eculizumab. Conversely, there was no clear separation between relapse-free 
survival curves across the exposure quartiles suggesting no evidence of increased efficacy with increased 
eculizumab exposure. The low number of adjudicated On-trial Relapses (n = 3) in eculizumab-treated 
patients prevented a  meaningful interpretation of treatment effects among exposure quartiles. The 
number of eculizumab-treated patients with On-trial Relapse as determined by the Treating Physician (n 
= 14) was equally distributed across the exposure quartiles.

2.- Selected secondary efficacy endpoints 
Adjudicated On-trial ARR and On-trial ARR (as determined by the Treating Physician) was lower in 
Eculizumab-treated group compared with placebo. A linear regression analysis did not show an exposure 
effect on ARR, indicating that the exposure-response profile was flat over the investigated exposure 
range (Figure 13). There were not significant differences between placebo- and eculizumab-treated 
patients for the change in EDSS, mRS and HAI from baseline to the EOS. A linear regression analysis did 
not show an exposure effect on any of these scores (Figure 14).

No relevant differences are observed between eculizumab- and placebo-treated patients, and no trends 
were observed at increasing eculizumab exposure. 
 
 
 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of eculizumab was studied in a total of 96 patients NMOSD treated with 900 mg 
intravenous once per week for the first 4 weeks followed by 1200 mg intravenous one week later and then 
once every two weeks thereafter. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using a two 
compartmental model with first order elimination and time-variant body weight effects as starting model. 
Plasmapheresis/plasma exchange effect was successfully incorporated into the model. Apart from 
albumin and gender no other studied covariates showed significant correlation with the individual 
estimated parameters. Neither albumin nor gender could be incorporated into the model.  
The model predicted the following parameters (relative standard error): CL, 0.0070 L (0.5%); V1, 2.37 L 
(6.4%); V2, 2.16 L (11.3%); Q, 0.243 L/h (26 %); weight effect on CL/Q, 0.908 (7.2%); body weight 
effect on V1/V2, 0.594 (14.9); PP/PE effect on CL, 1.79 L/h (16.6%).  Interindividual was estimated for 
Cl (24.5% (15.6%) and V1 (16.3 % (28.7%)). Goodness of fit plots are reasonable, as well as the 
prediction corrected VPC plots.  
CSF exposure was only evaluated in four patients, and 12 samples in total. All measured concentrations 
were below 5 μg/ml, although these values should be cautiously interpret due to the low number of 
observations. 
95.8% of patients presented free C5 concentrations below the threshold of 0.5 μg/mL by the end of the 
infusion and it was maintained throughout the entire treatment period. Similar results were obtained for 
cRBC haemolysis. Values<20% were observed in 92.6% of the patients at the end of the infusion and 
were maintained throughout the treatment period. The distribution of data for these two variables did not 
enable the development of a PKPD model. 
The relationship between the exposure and efficacy endpoints was graphically explored. The 
eculizumab-treated patients were binned into 4 quartiles of AUC at steady state exposure bins. 
Differences between placebo and treated patients were observed for the primary efficacy endpoints (time 
to first adjudicated On-trial Relapse and sensitivity analysis endpoint of On-trial Relapse), but no 
differences among the 4 bins of AUC were observed. There were no significant differences for any of the 
secondary efficacy endpoints (adjudicated On-trial ARR, the sensitivity analysis of On-trial ARR, and 
change from Baseline to EOS for EDSS, mRS, and HAI).  Therefore no PKPD model was developed, 
probably due to the fact that the majority of the patients presented an almost complete inhibition of 
terminal complement after the treatment start.  Safety endpoints included in the exposure-response 
analysis were treatment-emergent AESIs and TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of the eculizumab-treated 
patients. No differences were observed between patients treated with eculizumab or placebo. No trends 
are observed at increasing eculizumab exposure.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of eculizumab in patients suffering NMOSD was evaluated by means of a population 
approach. Parameter estimates were similar to those estimated for other indications. Eculizumab 
produced an almost complete inhibition of terminal complement from the first measurement after drug 
intake and this fact precluded the possibility of finding exposure-effect relationships for the studied 
efficacy primary or secondary variables. Neither was possible to correlate drug exposure with safety 
endpoints. 
At the time of this assessment report, there were samples requiring validation of storage duration 
according to the Applicant (Tables 3 5 6 8 10). At request, MAH committed to submit these long-term 
storage data and in case of failure, an impact analysis by the end of Dec 2020. Due to the limited number 
of samples not yet covered by validated storage stability, no impact to the study was anticipated in the 
event of failing to provide coverage. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
• 
The MAH commits to submit long-term storage data by the end of Dec 2020 as a PAM 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The eculizumab clinical development program in NMOSD includes 2 clinical studies:  
• A Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study (Study 
ECU-NMO-301; completed) 
• A Phase 3, open-label, multicenter extension study of Study ECU-NMO-301 (Study 
ECU-NMO-302; ongoing) 
2.4.1.  Main Study 
Study  ECU-NM0-301:  A  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  trial  to  evaluate  the 
safety and efficacy of Eculizumab in patients with relapsing Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) 
Figure 15 Study ECU-NMO-301 Design 
Patients completed the study if they experienced an On-trial Relapse per the Treating Physician or once 
the pre-specified number of patients had experienced a positively-adjudicated On-trial Relapse, 
whichever occurred first. Patients were provided the opportunity to participate in an extension study to 
receive eculizumab after completion of this study. 
2.4.1.1.  Methods 
Study participants 
Main Inclusion Criteria: 
1.  Male or female ≥  18 years of age 
2.  Diagnosis of NMO as defined by 2006 criteria (Wingerchuk, 2006), or NMOSD as defined by 2007

corticosteroid dose must be no more than prednisone 20 mg/day (or equivalent) prior to the 
Screening, and must remain on that dose for the duration of the study or until the patient experiences 
a relapse 
5.  Pregnant, breastfeeding, or intending to conceive during the course of the study

Investigator and had not been treated with appropriate antibiotics 
8.  Had previously been treated with eculizumab 
9.  Hypersensitivity to murine proteins or to 1 of the excipients of eculizumab 
10. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might have interfered with the patient’s 
participation in the study, posed any added risk for the patient, or confounded the assessment of the 
patient 
Treatments 
The proposed commercial formulation, dosage form, and route of administration are identical to that used 
in Studies ECU-NMO-301 and ECU-NMO-302 as well as that currently marketed (Soliris) for use in PNH, 
aHUS, and gMG. 
• 
Induction Period: Patients received either eculizumab 900 mg or matching placebo via intravenous 
(IV) infusion once a week (every 7 ± 2 days) for 4 weeks followed by eculizumab 1200 mg or 
matching placebo for the fifth dose. 
•  Maintenance Period: Patients received either eculizumab 1200 mg or matching placebo via IV infusion 
every 2 weeks (every 14 ± 2 days) from the sixth dose onwards. 
•  Supplemental Doses: If plasmapheresis or plasma exchange (PE) was administered for On-trial 
Relapse, supplemental study drug (600 mg of eculizumab or matching placebo) was administered 
within 1 to 2 hours after the end of each plasmapheresis/PE session.  
Patients could continue to receive a stable dose of the ISTs they were taking at the time of Screening 
(with the exception of protocol-specified disallowed medications), but no new ISTs and no change in IST 
dosage were permitted during the study except for a known toxicity or side effect associated with the 
given IST. After an On-trial Relapse, there were no restrictions on IST adjustments or changes. If a 
patient entered the study receiving corticosteroids either as monotherapy or in combination with another 
IST, the daily corticosteroid dose could not be more than prednisone 20 mg daily (or equivalent). The 
patient must have remained on that dose for the duration of the study unless the patient experienced a 
relapse. 
All patients must have been vaccinated against N. meningitidis if not already vaccinated within the time 
period of active coverage specified by the vaccine manufacturer.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of eculizumab treatment, as compared with placebo, in 
patients with NMOSD based on time to first relapse.  
The main secondary clinical efficacy objective was to evaluate the efficacy of eculizumab compared with 
placebo by additional efficacy measures including: 
•  Annualized relapse rate (ARR) 
•  Disease related disability 
•  Neurologic function 
•  Quality of life 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Outcomes 
•  On-trial Relapse: a relapse that occurs during the Study Period, defined as a new onset of neurologic 
symptoms or worsening of existing neurologic symptoms with an objective change (clinical sign) on 
neurologic examination that persists for more than 24 hours as confirmed by the Treating Physician.  
•  Adjudicated On-trial Relapse: an On-trial Relapse that was positively adjudicated by the Relapse 
Adjudication Committee (RAC).  
•  Historical relapse: a relapse that occurred prior to the ECU-NMO-301 Screening Visit, including the 
first NMO attack. For this study, historical relapse was defined as a new onset of neurologic symptoms 
or worsening of existing neurologic symptoms with an objective change on neurologic examination 
(clinical findings or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] findings or both) that persisted for more than 
24 hours and/or the new onset of neurologic symptoms or worsening of existing neurologic symptoms 
that required treatment. Treatment was defined as use of high-dose IV corticosteroids, PE, or IVIg. 
Events that occurred within a 30-day interval were considered as 1 relapse.  
• 
EDSS: an ordinal clinical rating scale that ranges from 0 (normal neurologic examination) to 10 
(death) in half-point increments. The Kurtzke functional systems (pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, 
sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, cerebral) and ambulation are rated in the context of a standard 
neurological examination, and then these ratings (KFS scores) are used in conjunction with 
observations and information concerning the patient’s mobility, gait, and use of assistive devices to 
assign an EDSS score. EDSS steps 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people who are fully ambulatory. EDSS steps 5.0 
to 9.5 are defined by impairment to ambulation. 
•  Modified Rankin Scale (mRS): a commonly administered scale by the Treating Physician for 
measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people suffering from a 
neurological disability. The scale ranges from 0 (no disability) to 6 (death).  
•  Hauser Ambulation Index (HAI): a sale to assess the time and effort used by the patient to walk 25 
feet (8 meters). The scale ranges from 0 to 9, with 0 being the best score (asymptomatic; fully 
ambulatory with no assistance) and 9 being the worst (restricted to wheel chair; unable to transfer 
self independently). 
• 
European Quality of Life Health 5-Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D): a generic, standardized patient 
self-administered instrument that provides a simple, descriptive profile and a index value for health 
status. The EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension consists of 3 levels (some, moderate, 
extreme problems), generating a total of 243 theoretically possible health states. The response 
period is the day of assessment only. Assessments were also made using the EQ-5D Visual Analogue 
Scale (EQ-5D VAS). 
•  Visual Assessment: Assessment of the optic disc, Visual Fields (VFs), the presence or absence of a 
scotoma, and visual acuity measured using the Snellen chart.  
•  Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36): a patient self-administered questionnaire designed to assess 
generic health-related quality of life in healthy and ill adult populations. The SF-36 consists of 36 
items organized into 8 scales. The SF-36 also yields 2 summary measures of physical health and 
mental health derived from scale aggregates. Higher global scores are associated with better quality 
of life. 
Endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: time to first adjudicated On-trial Relapse by the Relapse Adjudication Committee 
(RAC) 
Secondary Endpoints (hierarchical) 
1.  Adjudicated On-trial ARR 
2.  Change from Baseline in EDSS score at End Of Study (EOS) 
3.  Change from Baseline in Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at EOS 
4.  Change from Baseline in ambulatory function as measured by Hauser Ambulation Index (HAI) at EOS 
5.  Change from Baseline in European Quality of Life Health 5-dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D) at EOS. 
The EQ-5D has 2 endpoints, the index score and EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS). For the purposes 
of this closed testing procedure, the EQ-5D VAS score was analysed first and the EQ-5D Index score 
was analysed second for the EQ-5D analyses. 
Tertiary Endpoints 
1.  Change from Baseline in ambulatory function as measured by HAI at EOS in patients with abnormal 
baseline ambulatory function 
2.  Change from Baseline in visual function as measured by visual acuity at EOS in all patients and in 
patients with abnormal baseline visual function 
3.  Change from Baseline in the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form at EOS 
4.  Change from Baseline in the EDSS functional system scores at EOS 
Other Efficacy Endpoints 
1.  Severity of an individual relapse as assessed by Optic Spinal Impairment score (OSIS) and relapse 
recovery as assessed by changes in EDSS score. 
2.  Anti-AQP4 Ab titers in blood samples (from all patients) and cerebrospinal (CSF) samples (from 
patients who consented to CSF testing). 
 
 
Sample size 
The sample size and power calculation assumptions for this time to first event study were as follows: 
Power 90% 
Two-sided 5% level of significance 
Log-rank test for comparison of eculizumab to placebo 
• 
•  2:1 randomization (eculizumab : placebo) 
• 
• 
•  Drop-out rate 10% 
•  Accrual period of approximately 21 months 
•  Relapse-free rate of 80% for the eculizumab group at 12 months 
•  Hazard ratio of 0.24 (-log hazard ratio = 1.41), which corresponds to a relapse-free rate of 40% 
for the placebo group at 12 months 
The total number of relapses anticipated to be observed for this study was 24 relapses (adjudicated 
On-trial Relapses) in 24 distinct patients. With these assumptions, a sample size of approximately 132 
patients (88 eculizumab and 44 placebo) was expected to provide 90% power to detect a treatment 
difference in time to first relapse. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized on a 2:1 basis to the eculizumab group or the placebo group. Randomization 
was performed across sites and stratified according to the following two variables:  
1) Patients’ EDSS score at randomization (≤ 2.0; ≥ 2.5 and ≤ 7.0).  
2) Patients’ prior IST and IST status at randomization:  
a.  Treatment-naïve patients (ie, patients with no prior or current ISTs, except corticosteroids alone) 
b.  Patients continuing on the same IST(s) since the last relapse (ie, including patients with dose 
adjustments since the last relapse) 
c.  Patients with changes in IST(s) since the last relapse (ie, switched IST(s), added IST(s), or 
withdrew any IST). 
Blinding (masking) 
All study patients, investigational site personnel; Alexion staff, Alexion designees, and all staff directly 
associated with the conduct of the study were blinded to the patient treatment assignments.  
Statistical Analyses 
Analysis Populations 
• 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The population on which primary, secondary, tertiary, and other efficacy 
analyses was performed consisted of all patients who were randomized to treatment and who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug (modified Intention to Treat). Patients were compared for 
efficacy according to the treatment they were randomized to receive, irrespective of the 
treatment they received. 
•  Per Protocol (PP) Set: The PP Set is a subset of the FAS includes all patients who have no major 
protocol deviations or key inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations that might potentially affect 
efficacy and took at least 80% of the required treatment doses while they were in the 
 
double-blind Study Period (for patients who had relapses, any dosing after the relapse was not 
included in this calculation). 
•  Safety Set: all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Patients were compared for 
safety according to the treatment they received. 
•  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Set: PK/PD analyses were performed on the PK/PD Set. The 
PK/PD Set includes patients with at least one PK or PD observation. 
Efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS. The primary efficacy analysis of time to first adjudicated 
On-trial Relapse was also performed on the PP Set. Baseline was defined as the last available assessment 
prior to treatment for all patients regardless of treatment group. 
The trial was considered to have met its primary efficacy objective if a statistically significant difference 
was observed between the eculizumab and placebo groups for time to first adjudicated On-trial Relapse. 
The primary comparison of the treatment groups for time to first adjudicated On-trial Relapse and the 
sensitivity analysis of time to first On-trial Relapse as determined by the Treating Physician used a 
stratified log-rank test including strata for the randomization stratification variable. Confidence intervals 
(CIs) and p-values were presented. Hazard ratio and risk reduction from a stratified Cox proportional 
hazards model were summarized. Additional sensitivity analyses of the time to first adjudicated On-trial 
Relapse included an unstratified log-rank test and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. An 
additional sensitivity analysis was performed on the time to first adjudicated On-trial Relapse as 
determined by the Relapse Adjudication Committee. Summaries of subgroups are provided for 
adjudicated On-trial Relapses and On-trial Relapses as determined by the Treating Physician based on 
region, age, sex, race, and IST subgroups. 
Hypothesis testing comparing eculizumab and placebo for the secondary efficacy analyses was performed 
using a closed testing procedure with the rank order as pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan : (1) 
Adjudicated ARR; (2) Change from Baseline in EDSS score at EOS; (3) Change from Baseline in mRS 
score at EOS; (4) Change from Baseline in ambulatory function as measured by HAI at EOS; (5) Change 
from Baseline in EQ-5D at EOS.. The hypothesis testing proceeded from highest rank (#1)  to the lowest 
rank (#5).. If statistical significance was not achieved at an endpoint (p≤0.05), then endpoints of lower 
rank were considered not to be statistically significant. Confidence intervals and p-values were presented 
for all secondary efficacy endpoints for descriptive purposes, regardless of the outcome of the closed 
testing procedure.  
The adjudicated On-trial ARR and On-trial ARR (as determined by the Treating Physician) were analysed 
using a Poisson regression analysis, with treatment group, historical ARR, and randomization strata as 
covariates. The change from Baseline in EDSS score, mRS score, HAI score, EQ-5D VAS score, and EQ-5D 
Index score at EOS were analysed using a randomization-based nonparametric analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) adjusted for baseline score (on that particular scale) and stratified by randomization strata. 
Sensitivity analyses included: (1) change from Baseline at EOS using an ANCOVA adjusted for baseline 
score (on that particular scale) and randomization strata; (2) change from Baseline at all scheduled visits 
using a mixed model for repeated measures, with baseline score (on that particular scale), observed 
strata, treatment group, and study visit as covariates; and (3) change from Baseline at all scheduled 
visits over Year 1 using a mixed model for repeated measures with baseline score (on that particular 
scale), observed strata, treatment group, study visit, and study visit by treatment interaction as 
covariates.

Figure 16 Participant flow 
a Reasons for screen failure include AQP4-Ab seronegative (n = 42); not having ≥ 2 relapses in the last 12 months or 
3 relapses in the last 24 months with at least 1 in the 12 months prior (n = 11); EDSS score > 7 (n = 5); Investigator 
decision (n = 5); daily corticosteroid dose more than prednisone 20 mg/day (or equivalent) after Screening (n = 3); 
patient not willing or able to comply with the protocol requirements (n = 3); and patient did not give written informed 
consent (n = 2). If a patient was screened more than once, the last screen failure reason is presented. A patient may 
have more than one reason for screen failure. 
b This includes 1 patient who experienced a relapse that was outside of the analysis window defined for an “On-trial 
Relapse”; thus, this relapse is not considered an On-trial Relapse in the efficacy analyses

During the first request for supplementary information, the applicant provided further information about 
the differential withdrawal rates between patients from eculizumab arm (16/96; 16.7%) and placebo arm 
(3/47; 6.4%).  When adjusted for study duration, study discontinuation in the eculizumab group occurred 
at a rate of 9.3/100 patient years (PY) compared with 5.6/100 PY for the placebo group. This difference 
was primarily driven by a greater number of patients who elected to withdraw in the eculizumab group 
(12 [12.5%] patients) compared with the placebo group (1 [2.1%] patient). For the eculizumab patient 
withdrawals, time on study ranged from 106 to 835 days and the majority of withdrawals (8/12) were 
attributed to changes in life circumstances including change of employment and relocation. Since only 
three cases were due to unknown reasons, difference in the withdrawals could not be related with the 
treatment (non-informative censoring).  
Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 130 centres in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia, of 
which only 70 centres enrolled patients. 
•  Date first patient enrolled: 11 Apr 2014 
•  Date last patient completed: 17 Jul 2018 
•  Date locking database: 17 Sept 2018 
Conduct of the study 
The 24th adjudicated On-trial Relapse was planned to trigger end of study activities. In May 2018, Alexion 
ended the study at 23th adjudicated On-trial Relapses.

The protocol was globally amended 5 times during the study, with the first patient enrolled under 
Amendment 3 (ie, Protocol Version 4.0). The following significant changes from the original protocol were 
included:  
1.  Protocol Version 2.0 (Global), 15 Mar 2013 (No patients enrolled) 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Included the option to perform an interim analysis when a minimum of 70% of expected events 
had occurred in order to stop the trial for efficacy 
Increased the screening window from 1-2 weeks to 1-3 weeks 
•  Allowed the use of methotrexate and tacrolimus as supportive therapies 
•  Updated the EDSS randomization strata from 3 strata to 2 strata (≤ 2.0 vs. ≥ 2.5 to ≤ 7) 
•  Updated the IST status randomization strata from 2 strata to 3 strata  
•  Provided a Patient Education Card that details the signs and symptoms of a potential relapse, with 
instructions to contact the Investigator at the first sign or symptom of a potential relapse 
•  Provided clarification on the visit interval between this study and the extension study 
•  Added change from Baseline in mRS score at EOS as a secondary endpoint 
•  Deleted the secondary endpoint of change from Baseline visual function as measured by visual 
acuity at EOS 
•  Updated definition of treatment naïve 
•  Deleted the restriction that relapses occurring within the first 14 days of study drug 
administration would not count as events 
•  Added the C-SSRS as a safety outcome measure 
• 
Incorporated new sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint 
•  Added PK/PD sampling at Relapse Evaluation Visits 
2. 
 Protocol Version 3.0 (Global), 15 May 2013 (No patients enrolled) 
•  Updated the IST status randomization strata from patients who are treatment naïve vs. patients 
who have failed ISTs and are receiving IST at randomization vs. patients who have failed ISTs and 
are not receiving IST at randomization to treatment naïve patients vs. prior IST and are receiving 
IST at randomization patients vs. prior IST and are not receiving IST at randomization patients 
•  Deleted Inclusion Criteria #6 around prior ISTs: updated to reflect that the DMC will receive 
reports concerning patients who have dropped out and any patients who have missing primary 
and secondary efficacy data; the DMC will also review summaries of all patient-reported relapses 
to assure no bias has occurred in relapse assessments by the Treating Physician 
3. 
 Protocol Version 4.0 (Global), 16 Oct 2013 
•  Assumptions for sample size and event-driven power calculations were updated  
• 
Increased the number of study centers from 100 to 100-120 to enhance recruitment 
•  Updated the anticipated sample size based on power calculations requiring 24 relapses in 24 
distinct patients 
•  Updated the IST status randomization strata from treatment naïve patients vs. prior IST and are 
receiving IST at randomization patients vs. prior IST and are not receiving IST at randomization 
patients to treatment naïve patients vs. patients continuing on the same IST(s) since last relapse 
vs. patients with changes in IST(s) since last relapse 
•  Expanded on the clinical information to be collected for historical relapses  
•  Safety follow-up was extended from 4 weeks to 8 weeks  
•  Updated the inclusion criterion around historical relapses to be less restrictive 
•  Updated the inclusion criterion around concomitant IST use during the study to be less restrictive 
and better aligned with current clinical practice 
•  Added exclusion criterion #4, as high corticosteroid doses may decrease the relapse rate in some 
patients, confounding the interpretation of study results 
4. 
 Protocol Version 5.0 (Global), 25 Feb 2015 
•  Changed the inclusion criterion “NMO-IgG seropositive at screening visit” to “NMO-IgG 
seropositive” to allow historically seropositive patients 
•  Allowed qualified non-physician healthcare professionals (eg, nurses) to conduct the EDSS rating 
with the Sponsor’s approval 
•  Expanded the number of sites from 100-120 to 120-150 to meet recruitment challenges 
•  Removed an interim analysis, in alignment with recommendations from regulatory agencies 
•  Removed text emphasizing reporting the IST use “within 24 months prior to the Screening Visit” 
to encourage obtaining all available history on IST use for relapse prevention 
•  Clarified that supportive ISTs are for relapse prevention, so as not to be confused with ISTs 
administered for relapse treatment or other medical reasons 
•  Extended the Screening Period from 1-3 weeks to 1-6 weeks  
•  Provided some flexibility for the supplemental study drug dose administration time from “within 
60 minutes” to “preferably within 1-2 hours” after each PE cycle to address operational challenges 
•  Changed the definition of the PP Set from patients who have “no major protocol deviations or 
inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations” to “no major protocol deviations or key inclusion/exclusion 
criteria deviations that might potentially affect efficacy" to prevent the exclusion of patients from 
the PP Set with deviations not relevant for assessing the efficacy and safety of eculizumab 
5.  Protocol Version 6.0 (Global), 01 Jul 2016 
•  Established the RAC for adjudication of all On-trial Relapses 
•  Updated the primary endpoint of the study from “time to first Relapse” to “time to first 
adjudicated On-trial Relapse” 
•  Added a sensitivity analysis of time to first On-trial Relapse using a log-rank test including strata 
for the randomization stratification variables 
•  The secondary efficacy endpoint was changed from ARR to adjudicated ARR 
•  Added a sensitivity analysis for ARR using all On-trial Relapses in a Poisson regression analysis 
with treatment group, stratification variables, and baseline ARR as covariates in the model, and 
the log of time in the study was used as the offset variable 
Protocol Deviations 
There were a total of 138 major protocol deviations in 57 (39.9%) patients. Major deviations that 
occurred in more than 10% of patients overall included those related to informed consent, randomization 
strata errors, and visit schedule. Three patients had major protocol deviations related to inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and were excluded from the PP Set: 1 patient in each treatment group had a daily 
corticosteroid dose greater than prednisone 20 mg/day (or equivalent) after Screening and 1 patient in 
the eculizumab group used rituximab within 3 months prior to Screening. Eleven (7.7%) patients overall 
had an SAE that was not reported within 24 hours, which was considered a major protocol deviation 
(Table 15).  
Table 15 Major Protocol Deviations – Full Analysis Set 
 
 
 
Baseline data 
The majority of the patients were females with an average age of 45 years old. Nearly 50% of the 
participants were White-Caucasian and nearly a third came from a European Country (Table 16). On 
average, age at initial clinical presentation was 36 years and age at first dose was 45 years. The most 
commonly reported onset syndromes were optic neuritis and transverse myelitis (Table 17) On average, 
patients entering this study had a median EDSS of 4 steps (Table 18) and were experiencing 
approximately 2 relapses per year for the 2 years prior to study start and most of them were under IST 
or immunomodulation at the time of the historical relapses (Table 19). Indeed, the majority of patients 
had received prior supportive ISTs for NMOSD. Of the total patients, 98 (68.5%), 87 (60.8%), 46 
(32.2%), and 42 (29.4%) had received prior supportive corticosteroids, azathioprine, rituximab, and 
mycophenolate mofetil, respectively (Table 20). Thirty-four patients were not under any IST, the majority 
of them (24/34) had received supportive ISTs prior to study enrolment. In accordance with the study 
protocol, information was not collected at screening regarding reasons for IST discontinuation prior to 
study entry. In the position of the MAH, this situation would be consistent with inadequate disease control 
despite prior IST use since these patients met relapse entry criteria for the study. Of the 10 patients who 
had not received treatment with supportive ISTs prior to study entry, the majority (6 of 10 patients) were 
from a single country (Russia). The remaining 4 patients were from Germany, Italy, Turkey, and the USA. 
These 10 patients were also diagnosed more recently prior to study entry than patients who had received 
prior ISTs, with a median (minimum, maximum) time between diagnosis and first dose of study drug of 
0.73 (0.23, 3.76) years and 3.29 (0.15, 15.65) years, respectively.  
Overall, treatment compliance was high during the study in both treatment groups. The mean (SD) 
treatment compliance in the Safety Set was 96.8% (5.08%) in the eculizumab group and 97.7% (4.76%) 
in the placebo group. The majority of patients (86 [89.6%] patients in the eculizumab group and 43 
[91.5%] patients in the placebo group) had treatment compliance of ≥ 90%. Only 1 patient overall 
(eculizumab group) had compliance of ≥ 70% to < 80%, with all other patients having compliance of ≥ 
80%.

Numbers analysed 
All 143 patients who were randomized (96 in the eculizumab group and 47 in the placebo group) were 
treated and are included in both the FAS and the Safety Set. Of the patients included in the FAS and 
Safety Set, 90 (93.8%) patients in the eculizumab group and 44 (93.6%) patients in the placebo group 
are included in the PP Set. Reasons for exclusion from the PP Set were as follows: changes in IST(s), key 
eligibility criteria violations, emergency unblinding, and treatment compliance < 80%. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
In the FAS, 3 (3.1%) patients in the eculizumab group and 20 (42.6%) patients in the placebo group had 
an adjudicated On-trial Relapse, with a median follow-up time of 89.43 weeks and 36.00 weeks in the 
eculizumab group and the placebo group, respectively (Table 21). A significant effect on the time to first 
adjudicated On-trial Relapse was observed for eculizumab compared with placebo (p<0.0001), 
confirming that the primary endpoint of the study was met.  The hazard ratio (95% CI) for eculizumab 
compared with placebo was 0.058 (0.017, 0.197), representing a 94.2% reduction in the rate of relapse. 
The estimated proportion of patients (95% CI) relapse-free at 48 weeks was 0.979 (0.918, 0.995) in the 
eculizumab group and 0.632 (0.468, 0.758) in the placebo group. At 144 weeks, the estimated proportion 
 
 
of patients (95% CI) relapse-free was 0.964 (0.891, 0.988) in the eculizumab group and 0.454 (0.262, 
0.628) in the placebo group (Table 21 and Figure 17).

Sensitivity Analyses 
In the FAS, 14 (14.6%) patients in the eculizumab group and 29 (61.7%) patients in the placebo group 
had an On-trial Relapse as determined by the Treating Physician, with a median follow-up time of 89.43 
weeks and 36.00 weeks in the eculizumab group and the placebo group, respectively (Table 22).   
A significant effect on the time to first On-trial Relapse as determined by the Treating Physician was 
observed for eculizumab compared with placebo (p<0.0001). The hazard ratio (95% CI) for eculizumab 
compared with placebo was 0.180 (0.095, 0.343), representing an 82.0% reduction in the risk of relapse 
(Table 22 Figure 18).

During the first request for supplementary information, the MAH provided further information about: 
• 
The potential impact of the inclusion of the independent RAC once the recruitment had started in the 
primary endpoint.  
•  Clarification for difference between adjudicated On-trial Relapse On-trial relapse determined by the 
treating physician and the reasons for negative qualification.  
According to the positon of the applicant, all relapses were adjudicated on a retrospective basis, using all 
data as collected per protocol, and only after the Treating Physician had made a determination of whether 
a relapse had occurred and had treated the patient based on their presenting signs and symptoms.  
Of the 43 patients with an On-trial Relapse as determined by the Treating Physician and that were 
subsequently referred to the RAC for adjudication, 23 patients had a relapse that occurred prior to 14 Jul 
2016 (date of implementation of the RAC) and 20 patients had a relapse that occurred after the RAC was 
implemented. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of the relapses 
adjudicated by RAC before and after RAC implementation (Table 23).

with an On-trial Relapse 
Note: Fisher’s exact test was used to test the association between variables. 
a The relapse adjudication committee was implemented on 14 Jul 2016. 
Abbreviations: RAC = Relapse Adjudication Committee. 
During the study ECU-NMO-301, 14 patients on eculizumab and 29 patients on placebo had an On-trial 
Relapse determined by the treating physician. However, 2 of the placebo patients had 2 On-trial Relapses 
each. In one of those patients, both relapses were adjudicated positively by the RAC. When analysed by 
the total number of On-trial Relapses as opposed to the total number of patients with an On-trial Relapse, 
this results in 31 relapses referred to the RAC in the placebo group, with 21 of these 31 positively 
adjudicated (Table 24).  
In reviewing the reasons reported by the RAC for the negative adjudications in eculizumab-treated 
patients, for 8 relapses there was insufficient documented evidence for objective neurologic change on 
their examinations, for 1 relapse there was an alternative explanation for the new symptoms other than 
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and for 2 relapses both reasons were applicable (Table 
25) 
The RAC negatively adjudicated 10 On-trial Relapses reported for placebo-treated patients. In reviewing 
the reasons reported by the RAC for the negative adjudications, for 8 relapses there was insufficient 
documented evidence for objective neurologic change on their examinations, for 1 relapse there was an 
alternative explanation for the new symptoms other than NMOSD, and for 1 relapse the symptoms were 
not preceded by 30 days of stability (Table 25).

aA patient may have more than 1 relapse and a relapse may have had more than 1 reason for negative adjudication. 
Abbreviations: NMOSD = neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder 
The over-reporting of relapses by the treating physician was acknowledged considering the severity of the 
condition and the negative consequences of leaving a relapse untreated. Also, a lower rate of relapses 
(whether on-trial or adjudicated relapses) in eculizumab treated patients was expected. However, there 
was unbalanced rate of positive adjudications between placebo treated patients (21/31; 67.7%) and 
eculizumab treated patients (3/14; 21.4%). Whether it was the result of the small numbers or the 
modification of the course of the condition or the relapses; or whether it could be a question of bias was 
not totally clarified.  
Subgroup analyses 
•  A treatment effect of eculizumab was observed in patients across all randomization strata, age 
group, sex, and race subgroups on the time to first adjudicated On-trial Relapse and time to first 
On-trial Relapse as determined by the Treating Physician. 
•  A treatment effect of eculizumab was observed in patients across all regions on the time to first 
adjudicated On-trial Relapse. 
•  A treatment effect of eculizumab was observed in patients across all IST subgroups (baseline 
corticosteroids alone, baseline azathioprine, baseline mycophenolate mofetil, no IST use, and 
prior rituximab) including the subgroup with no ISTs at Baseline (p<0.0001), on the time to first 
adjudicated On-trial Relapse. 
During the first request for supplementary information, the MAH submitted further subgroup analyses in 
order to document the efficacy of eculizumab in some subpopulations less represented such as patients 
with early diagnosis, low inflammatory activity and baseline disability status as well as different levels of 
immunosuppression use (Figure 19). Overall, the efficacy is comparable between groups (eculizumab vs 
placebo) regardless the selected criteria (time since diagnosis, disability burden, relapse history, prior IST 
use, concomitant IST use). However, these analyses included a limited number of patients in some 
subgroups and some of them were no pre-specified in the statistical plan analysis.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Annualized Relapse Rate 
The total number of adjudicated On-trial Relapses in the eculizumab group and placebo group was 3 and 
21, respectively, and the adjusted adjudicated On-trial ARR (95% CI) in the eculizumab group and 
placebo group was 0.016 (0.005, 0.050) and 0.350 (0.199, 0.616), respectively. The adjudicated On-trial 
ARR ratio (95% CI) for eculizumab compared to placebo patients was 0.045 (0.013, 0.151; p<0.0001), 
representing a 95.5% reduction in adjudicated On-trial ARR for patients treated with eculizumab 
compared with placebo (Table 26).

The total number of On-trial Relapses in the eculizumab group and placebo group was 14 and 31, 
respectively, and the adjusted On-trial ARR (95% CI) in the eculizumab group and placebo group was 
0.066 (0.036, 0.120) and 0.446 (0.272, 0.732), respectively. The On-trial ARR ratio (95% CI) for 
eculizumab compared to placebo patients was 0.147 (0.078, 0.278; p<0.0001), representing an 85.3% 
reduction in On-trial ARR for patients treated with eculizumab compared with placebo. 
Change from Baseline in Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale Score at End of Study 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients reported at entry a baseline mean EDSS score of 4.18 (4.26 in placebo group and 4.15 in 
eculizumab group). At the end of the study, patients on eculizumab reported a mean improvement in the 
mean EDSS score of -0.18 and patients on placebo reported a mean deterioration in the mean EDSS score 
of 0.12. It is difficult to give value to these figures, when they are mainly driven by the number of relapses 
and the lack of progression out of relapses. 
The median (min, max) change from Baseline in EDSS score at End of Study was 0.00 (-3.5, 1.5) in the 
Eculizumab group and 0.00 (-2.0, 2.5) in the placebo group (p=0.0597), with a decrease in score 
representing improvement. A histogram of the overall distribution showing the change from Baseline in 
EDSS score to End of Study is provided by treatment group in (Figure 19).  The distribution for the change 
from Baseline to End of Study in EDSS score showed 51.0% of the eculizumab-treated patients and 
42.6% of the placebo-treated patients had no change, 29.2% of the eculizumab-treated patients and 
29.8% of the placebo-treated patients had a ≥ 0.5-point improvement in EDSS score, while 19.8% of the 
eculizumab-treated patients and 27.7% of the placebo-treated patients had a ≥ 0.5-point worsening in 
EDSS score.

Change From Baseline in Modified Rankin Scale Score at End of Study 
The median (min, max) change from Baseline in mRS at End of Study was 0.00 (-4, 2) in the eculizumab 
group and 0.00 (-2, 3) in the placebo group (nominal p=0.0154), with a decrease in score representing 
improvement. A histogram of the change from Baseline in mRS to End of Study is provided by treatment

Other Efficacy Endpoints 
Relapse Severity and Type of Relapse 
Most of the relapses in the placebo-group were classified as major while minor relapses were more 
frequent in the Eculizumab group (Table 27). A total of 6 (6.3%) patients in the eculizumab group and 15 
(31.9%) patients in the placebo group experienced an On-trial Relapse as determined by the Treating 
Physician that required hospitalization. 
Table 27 Summary of Severity of Relapse by Patient – Full Analysis Set with an On-trial Relapse 
Note: If a patient had more than 1 relapse, the relapse used for time to first relapse analysis is presented in the table. 
If the relapse includes more than 1 type of relapse, the worst severity is presented in the table. Severity of a relapse 
as measured by OSIS was only classified for optic neuritis and transverse myelitis relapses; patients with other types 
of relapses are reported as unknown. Abbreviations: OSIS = Optic Spinal Impairment Score. 
 
 
 
 
Biomarker 
Figure 24  displays 925 anti-AQP4 Ab titer observations with time-matched serum eculizumab 
concentrations from 94 eculizumab-treated patients. Anti-AQP4 Ab titers were binned in 4 groups 
(negative, ≤ 1000, 10000, and ≥  100000).  For 2 eculizumab-treated patients no post-first eculizumab 
dose anti-AQP4 Ab titer observations were obtained.  Eculizumab serum concentrations were similar 
across the 4 anti-AQP4 Ab titer level bins. Therefore, eculizumab exposure was not directly impacted by 
anti-AQP4 Ab titer.

Concentration in Study ECU-NMO-301 
Numbers of observations are shown on the right side of plot. The lower and upper hinges correspond to the first and 
third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles). The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no 
further than 1.5 × IQR from the hinge (where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third 
quartiles). The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 × IQR of the hinge. Outlying 
points are not shown. 
Abbreviation: IQR = interquartile range. 
In Study ECU-NMO-301, 3 eculizumab-treated patients had an adjudicated On-trial Relapse and 
anti-AQP4 Ab titer data were not available for one patient per local protocol requirement prohibiting the 
collection of samples). In addition, 20 placebo-treated patients had an adjudicated On-trial Relapse 
(Baseline and/or post-relapse anti-AQP4 Ab titer data were not available for 3 placebo-treated patients. 
Figure 25 presents the anti-AQP4 Ab titers at Baseline and post-relapse for all patients regardless of 
treatment group who had an adjudicated On-trial Relapse in Study ECU-NMO-301, and for whom 
antiAQP4 Ab titer data were available at Baseline and post relapse (eculizumab-treated patients, n=2; 
and placebo-treated- patients, n = 17). Anti-AQP4 Ab titers did not change from Baseline to post relapse 
for the 2 eculizumab-treated patients. In the placebo treatment group, 11 of the 17 patients did not have 
a change in anti-AQP4 Ab titer category, 5 of the patients had a decrease in category, and 1 had an 
increase in category. Therefore, there was no consistent trend between change in anti-AQP4 Ab titer and 
adjudicated On-trial Relapse.

2.4.2.  Supportive study 
2.4.2.1.  Methods 
Study ECU-NMO-302 
Study ECU-NMO-302 is an ongoing, Phase 3, open-label, extension study of Study ECU-NMO-301 to 
evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of eculizumab in the treatment of patients with NMOSD. All 
patients in Study ECU-NMO-302 were treated with open-label eculizumab after a 4-week blind induction 
Phase. 
Patients who completed Study ECU-NMO-301 were to have their first Study ECU-NMO-302 visit no later 
than 2 weeks (14 ± 2 days) after the last dose of study drug in Study ECU-NMO-301. Patients who 
prematurely discontinued or whose treatment assignment was unblinded in Study ECU-NMO-301 were 
not eligible to enrol in Study ECU-NMO-302. 
In the Day 90, only data for patients who completed Study ECU-NMO-301 due to an On-trial Relapse were 
included in the analyses (cut-off date 31 May 2018). At the day 120, the MAH provided updated results 
(cut-off date 31 October 2018).  
The SAP for Study ECU-NMO-302 was originally finalized in Dec 2015. The SAP was amended on 01 Jun 
2018 for this interim analysis, prior to locking and unblinding of the Study ECU-NMO-301 clinical 
database. As a consequence of this amendment, 2 separate SAP documents were created: 1 for this 
interim analysis of Study ECU-NMO-302, and 1 for the Combined Safety Set for presentation of safety 
from Studies ECU-NMO-301 and ECU-NMO-302. 
Efficacy endpoint analyses were performed on the Extension FAS, which consists of all patients who 
received at least 1 dose of eculizumab in Study ECU-NMO-302. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the ARR based on all On-trial Relapses as determined by the Treating 
Physician. The primary analysis is the analysis of the change from historical patient-level ARR (which is 
comprised of the 24 months prior to Study ECU-NMO-301) to Study ECU-NMO-302 patient-level On-trial 
ARR for all patients in Study ECU-NMO-302; the change in ARR was evaluated using the Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test. A sensitivity analysis of the change in ARR from historical patient-level ARR to 
adjudicated On-trial ARR was also presented. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were the change from Baseline in EDSS score, mRS score, EQ-5D VAS 
and Index scores, and HAI score and Visual KFS score in patients with abnormal Study ECU-NMO-301 
baseline ambulatory or visual function. Note: updated (31 October 2019) results from second interim 
analyses are included for the primary endpoints. No updated (19 May 2019) results were provided for 
secondary endpoints). 
2.4.2.2.  Results 
Baseline data 
By 31 October 2018, a total of 119 patients had enrolled and were treated in Study ECU-NMO-302 (41 
patients in the placebo/eculizumab group who received placebo in Study ECU-NMO-301 and 78 patients 
in the eculizumab/eculizumab group who received eculizumab in Study ECU-NMO-301).  
Demographic characteristics of participants were similar to the ones reported for Study ECU-NMO-301. 
Patients enrolled in Study ECU-NMO-302 experienced a median of 1.92 relapses per year in the 2 years 
prior to the start of Study ECU-NMO-301. Almost 80% of patients were receiving ISTs or 
immunomodulators at the time of the historical relapses. Approximately half (47.9%) of patients had 
received PE during the 2 years prior to entering the Study ECU-NMO-301. Almost all (111 [93.3%]) 
patients were reported to have received supportive ISTs prior to treatment in Study ECU-NMO-301, with 
the most frequently reported IST being corticosteroids (85 [71.4%] patients). The median (min, max) 
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at ECU-NMO-302 Baseline was 4.00 (0.0, 7.5).  
A total of 87 (73.1%) patients used supportive IST treatment during Study ECU-NMO-302. The most 
frequently used ISTs were corticosteroids (63 [52.9%] patients), azathioprine (34 [28.6%] patients), and 
mycophenolate mofetil (24 [20.2%] patients). Thirty-four (28.6%) patients had changes in concomitant 
supportive IST use during the study. The most frequent change was a decrease in IST dose or stopping an 
IST, which occurred in 30 (25.2%) patients overall. 
A total of 9 (7.6%) patients discontinued from the study (7 [17.1%] patients in the placebo/eculizumab 
group and 2 [2.6%] patients in the eculizumab/eculizumab group). Four patients withdrew consent, 2 
patients discontinued due to physician decision, and 2 patients discontinued due to “other.” One patient 
discontinued the study due to treatment-emergent adverse events  
Patients had been on treatment during Study ECU-NMO-302 for a median (min, max) of 20.00 (0.1, 
198.4) weeks. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: On-trial Annualized Relapse Rate (as Determined by the Treating Physician) 
The median (min, max) reduction in the On-trial ARR as determined by the Treating Physician in Study 
ECU-NMO-302 (-1.829 [-6.38, 1.63]) represents a significant treatment effect of eculizumab compared 
with the historical ARR (p<0.0001) (Table 29 and Figure 26).

Among the 119 patients reported in this interim analysis, only 3 patients have experienced a worsening 
of On-trial ARR from their historical ARR. One patient in the placebo/eculizumab group had experienced 
a worsening of ARR from 1.44 historically to 2.46, and 2 patients in the eculizumab/eculizumab group 
experienced a worsening of ARR from 0.96 to 2.59 and from 2.40 to 2.61, respectively, as of the clinical 
database cut-off date for the interim analysis. 
The majority of patients (109 [91.6%]) in the Extension FAS did not experience an On-trial Relapse 
during the study. Of the 10 patients who experienced an On-trial Relapse as determined by the Treating 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Physician, 7 patients had 1 relapse, 1 patient had 2 relapses, and 2 patients had 3 relapses (Table 30). 
The total number of PY in the Study Period was 105.76, for a study-level On-trial ARR of 0.142 (95% CI: 
0.086, 0.235).

Adjudicated On-trial Annualized Relapse Rate (Sensitivity Analysis) 
An adjudicated On-trial ARR was computed for a sensitivity analysis based on all adjudicated On-trial 
Relapses for each patient in the Extension FAS. The median (min, max) reduction in the adjudicated ARR 
(-1.829 [-6.38, 1.63]) in Study ECU-NMO-302 represents a significant treatment effect of eculizumab 
compared with the historical ARR (p<0.0001) (Table 31). When patients who received placebo in the 
Study ECU-NMO-301 were treated with eculizumab in Study ECU-MG-302 a median reduction 
(improvement) of -1.923 was reported. In patients previously treated with eculizumab the response was 
consistently maintained through Study ECU-NMO-302 with a median reduction -1.442.

There were a total of 6 adjudicated On-trial Relapses in 5 patients (2 patients in the placebo/ eculizumab 
group, 1 of whom experienced 2 adjudicated On-trial Relapses, and 3 patients in the 
eculizumab/eculizumab group who each experienced 1 adjudicated On-trial Relapse), with a study-level 
adjudicated On-trial ARR of 0.057 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.025, 0.126) (Table 32).

The estimated proportion (95% CI) of patients who were relapse-free in Study ECU-NMO-302 as 
determined by the Treating Physician was 0.918 (0.812, 0.965) at Week 48, with similar results observed 
in each treatment group (Table 33).

Relapse Concordance and Treatment 
Of the 15 total On-trial Relapses as determined by the Treating Physician, the majority (9 [60.0%]) were 
adjudicated negatively. A total of 8 cases of interest (a potential relapse event that was not determined 
to be an on-trial relapse by the treating physician) were identified, all of which were negatively 
adjudicated. 
Secondary endpoints (as of 31 May 2018) 
Overall, results for secondary endpoints (change from both the Baseline of Study ECU-NMO-301 and 
Baseline of Study ECU-NMO-302 in EDSS, mRS, HAI, EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale, EQ-5D Index, and 
visual KFS) showed no apparent changes in disability and QoL. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The evidence of the efficacy of Soliris (eculizumab) in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum 
disorder (NMOSD) patients with anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody-positive consisted of one Phase III 
clinical trial, i.e. Study ECU-NMO-301 and one open-label extension study currently ongoing, i.e. Study 
ECU-NMO-302.  
In general one pivotal study could be acceptable for the target population and pursued indication if its 
results are compelling. This approach as well the clinical design, selected endpoints and population were 
discussed in both the Scientific Advice given in 2013 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/3657/2013) and in the EMA 
Workshop on NMO held in 2014 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/712652/2014).  
 
 
 
 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Patient population 
Adult patients diagnosed as having NMO (based on the 2006 NMO criteria ) or NMOSD (based on the 2007 
diagnostic criteria ) and were positive for AQP4-Abs were eligible for the study.  
The NMOSD diagnostic criteria were updated in 2015, including the serum AQP4-IgG as one of the 
requisites. It could be that differences in diagnostic criteria may result in dissimilar selected populations, 
and could limit the assumption of the results. In this case, given  that Study 301 included only AQP4-IgG 
seropositive patients no differences were expected, as also suggested by literature.  
The Study ECU-NMO-301 enrolled relapsing patients with at least 2 documented relapses in the 12 
months preceding randomization (or 3 in the last 24 months) so that the study could be feasible in a 
reasonable timeframe and patients with more “benign” forms of the condition were excluded. 
Qualification of previous relapses was based on clinical (and MRI, if appropriate) criteria were judged by 
the Treating Physician.  
A total of 213 patients were screened for this study, of which 143 patients were randomized (96 patients 
randomized to the eculizumab group, and 47 patients randomized to the placebo group). Most of them 
(n= 124; 86.7%) completed the study: 44 patients due to the occurrence of a relapse and 80 patients due 
to the end of the study. The rate of withdrawal from the study were12.5% and 2.1% for eculizumab and 
placebo groups, respectively. 
Most of baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced over treatment arms. 
Females represented 91% of the population. Relapsing NMO is reported to be more prevalent in females 
whereas a more equal female/male distribution (48%) is reported in monophasic disease. Mean age of 
patients was approximately 44 years (ranging from 19 to 75 years). Only 9 patients were equal or older 
than 65 years of age. Half of subjects were White (49%) but African American subjects were more 
represented in the placebo group than in the eculizumab group (17.0% vs 9.4%). Ethnic differences have 
been reported in relation to age of onset (younger onset age in Asian and Afro-American/Afro-European 
patients than Caucasian patients), severity of the attacks (more severe attacks in Afro-descendent 
patients than Caucasian or Asian patients) and mortality (higher rates reported in Afro-descendent 
patients compared to Caucasian patients). This may impact the extrapolability of the results to European 
patients, who represent around one third (36%) of patients recruited even though White race is 50% of 
the ITT population.   
Patients reported a mean of 7.6 years (from 0.4 to 44.8 years) of course of the condition. Most of the 
included patients presented optic neuritis (40%) and transverse myelitis (40%), with mild to moderate 
optic-spinal impairment (according to OSIS scale), still ambulatory but mean EDSS was 4. Patients have 
had a mean of 2 annual relapses (between 1 and 6.4) in the past 2 years, most of them (76.9%) while 
they were being treated. About 31% of patients needed to change their treatment after the last relapse. 
Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and (or) corticosteroids were the most widely used treatments, 
which is in line with current recommendations. While the standard of care is the treatment of patients 
after the first episode in seropositive patients for prevention of further attacks, 34 subjects (23.8% of 
recruited patients) were not being treated with any supportive IST at baseline note, and 10 patients had 
not received any prior supportive IST for NMOSD. At request, the MAH has explained that this finding 
could be attributed to the lack of efficacy of previous treatments (in the group of 24 patients who had 
received prior IST treatment but stopped it before entering Study ECU-NMO-301), recent diagnosis of the 
disease or the fact that a number of them were enrolled in Russia (6 patients with no prior IST use). 
The trial was planned to end for a patient when the patient experienced an on-trial relapse or when 24 
adjudicated on-trial relapse events were reached in the study (whichever came first).   
Treatment regimen 
No specific dose-response studies have been conducted for this indication. The selected dose regimen 
(eculizumab 900 mg weekly for 4 weeks followed by 1200 mg for the 5th dose and then every two weeks) 
is the one that has been approved for the treatment of patients with aHUS and gMG. It is based on the 
inhibition of terminal complement activation achieved by >90% of patients.  
Both naïve and previously treated patients were allowed (except for rituximab), provided that 
immunosuppressive agents were administered at stable doses at entry.  
Endpoints 
The evaluation of efficacy mainly relies on the occurrence of relapses as the main source of disability. The 
selected endpoints were discussed with the SAWP in the Scientific Advice procedure 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/3657/2013) and also endorsed in the EMA workshop on clinical trials design in NMOSD 
held on October 2014 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/712652/2014) .   
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to first adjudicated On-trial relapse. The relapse was defined 
as a new onset of neurologic symptoms or worsening of existing neurologic symptoms with an objective 
change (clinical sign) on neurologic examination that persists for more than 24 hours. There is no a 
general agreement in the definition of relapse and MRI parameters have also been considered in some 
operative definitions.  The adjudication was made by an independent committee (Relapse Adjudication 
Committee) based on the relapses assessed and treated by the Investigator occurred during the 
treatment period. 
The inclusion of external committed of adjudication of events is welcome taking into account the potential 
variability in diagnostic procedures and management of patients related to the number of centres 
included (70 centres) and the wide geographical distribution.  However, this committee was implemented 
once the recruitment had started and only those events previously selected by investigators were 
submitted to the committee for revision.  At request, MAH explained that all the relapses were 
retrospectively adjudicated by the RAC during the trial once the decision on the episode was made by the 
treating physician. With respect to the potential impact on the previous episodes on the adjudication of 
the subsequent episodes, no differences were shown in the adjudication process between the episodes 
identified before the implementation of the RAC and those identified after that point. 
Secondary endpoints were based on the total number of relapses (ARR), clinical assessments (focusing on 
changes in EDSS score, Modified Rankin Scale score and Hauser Ambulatory Index) and quality of life 
variables (EQ-5D). 
AQP4-Abs (but not MRI) were included among the measured biomarkers. In case of relapse, additional 
tests (MRI, CT scan, laboratory tests) could be performed at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Randomization of subjects was stratified on the basis of EDSS scores and background therapy (IST). Four 
strata resulted from combination of two stratification factors: 1) low EDSS at randomization (≤  2.0); 2) 
high EDSS (≥  2.5 and ≤  7.0) and treatment naïve at randomization; 3) high EDSS and continuing on the 
same IST(s) since last relapse at randomization; and 4) high EDSS and changes in IST(s) since last 
relapse at randomization.  
Statistical analysis 
Efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS. The total number of relapses anticipated to be observed for 
this study was 24 relapses (adjudicated On-trial Relapses) in 24 distinct patients. A sample size of 
approximately 132 patients (88 eculizumab and 44 placebo) was expected to provide 90% power to 
detect a treatment difference in time to first relapse. 
The primary analysis was based on the time to first relapse occurred during the trial adjudicated by the 
RAC and among those determined by the Treating Physician using a stratified log-rank test including 
strata for the randomization stratification variable. Additional sensitivity analyses of the time to first 
adjudicated On-trial Relapse included an unstratified log-rank test and a multivariate Cox proportional 
hazards model.  
For the relevant secondary endpoints, baseline was defined as the last available assessment prior to 
treatment for all patients regardless of their treatment group. Hypothesis testing comparing eculizumab 
treatment with placebo treatment for the secondary efficacy analyses was performed using a closed 
testing procedure with the following rank order: 1) Adjudicated On-trial ARR; 2) Change from Baseline in 
EDSS score at the EOS; 3) Change from Baseline in mRS score at the EOS; 4) Change from Baseline in 
ambulatory function as measured by HAI at the EOS; 5) Change from Baseline in EQ-5D at the EOS. The 
adjudicated on-Trial ARR and On-trial ARR as determined by treating physician used a Poisson regression 
analysis with treatment group, historical ARR and randomization strata as covariates. Other secondary 
endpoints used a randomization-based ANCOVA adjusted by baseline score and stratified by 
randomization strata.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary endpoint 
During the study relapses were assessed by the treating physician and treated, if they were confirmed 
based on clinical criteria. The treatment for relapse was at the discretion of the treating physician. 
According to the study protocol, the recommended treatment included one gram IV methylprednisolone 
(IVMP) administered daily for 3-5 days followed by an oral prednisone tapering. Plasma exchange was 
recommended in case of insufficient response to methylprednisolone. During the relapse treatment the 
investigational product was administered as scheduled. If plasma exchange was performed additional 
doses of the investigational product was provided. Once the relapse was over the patient was withdrawn 
from the study and included in the Study ECU-302 (open label extension).  
A total of 23 relapses (20 in the placebo group [42.6%] and 3 in eculizumab group [3.1%]) were 
adjudicated by the RAC. The primary endpoint of the study was met. The analysis shows a significantly 
lower relapse rate after treatment with a hazard ratio of 0.058 95% CI (0.017- 0.197); p < 0.0001) for 
eculizumab versus placebo.  
Pre-specified sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint showed a statistically significant difference 
between eculizumab and placebo. A total of 14 (14.6%) patients [14 relapses] on eculizumab and 29 
(61.7%) [31 relapses] on placebo had an on-trial relapse (p < 0.0001). In both treatment groups, there 
were more On-trial Relapses as determined by the Treating Physician than adjudicated On-trial Relapses. 
The over-reporting of relapses by the treating physician was acknowledged given the severity of the 
condition and the negative consequences of leaving a relapse untreated.  It was also expected a lower 
rate of relapses (whether on-trial or adjudicated relapses) in eculizumab treated patients. The 
unbalanced rate of positive adjudications between placebo treated patients (21/31; 67.7%) and 
eculizumab treated patients (3/14; 21.4%) was not totally explained by the MAH. Whether it was the 
result of the small numbers or the modification of the course of the condition or the relapses; or whether 
it could be even a question of bias was not totally clarified. This is also relevant because the study ended 
for these patients and relapsing patients were not followed up in Study 301. Since the extension Study 
302 was not controlled (all patients were treated with eculizumab) the effect of Eculizumab versus 
Placebo on time to further relapses is unknown. Finally, when the 23 relapses were achieved and the 
study formally ended, a total of 81 patients (66 on eculizumab, 15 on placebo) were censored without 
having experienced a relapse and included in Study 302.  
As for the concomitant treatment, relapses occurred in 1/17 patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil 
and 2/37 patients on azathioprine in eculizumab group. Among patients on placebo those treated with 
steroids, azathioprine and mycophenolate showed a lower number of relapses compared to those with 
other IST or without IST. The small size of some subgroups, the low number of relapses and the lack of 
controlled follow-up of the patients after the first relapse prevents from reaching any solid conclusion on 
the benefit of one combination over the others (or even the effect of monotherapy vs combination 
therapy). At request, the MAH provided the results of a subgroup analysis in order to document the 
efficacy of eculizumab in some subpopulations less represented in the study and support a broad 
indication. Some of these results should be considered as exploratory because they were not 
pre-specified in the statistical plan and  results were based on a limited number of patients. Despite of 
these limitations, the efficacy was comparable between groups (eculizumab vs placebo) regardless the 
selected criteria (time since diagnosis, disability burden, relapse history, prior IST use, concomitant IST 
use).  
Secondary endpoints 
The adjusted (adjudicated) ARR (95% CI) was 0.016 (0.005, 0.050) in the eculizumab group versus 
0.350 (0.199, 0.616) in the placebo group, representing a 95% reduction over placebo (p <0.0001). 
When using the analysis based on relapses as determined by the treating physician, the reduction over 
placebo in the ARR was 85.3%, for eculizumab compared to placebo (p <0.0001). However, as relapsing 
patients finalised the study, there were differences in exposure between both arms (median treatment 
duration in eculizumab group 89.43 weeks vs 41.29 weeks in placebo group). In addition, most of the 
patients across the treatment groups experienced no relapse (eculizumab n= 93 [96.9%], placebo n=27 
[57.4%]) with a relatively high number of censored patients in eculizumab group.  
With respect to the level of disability  patients reported at entry a baseline mean EDSS score of 4.18 (4.26 
in placebo group and 4.15 in eculizumab group). At the end of the study, patients on eculizumab reported 
a mean improvement in the mean EDSS score of -0.18 and patients on placebo reported a mean 
deterioration in the mean EDSS score of 0.12 (p=0.0597). Considering the relatively low number of 
relapses and the lack of progression out of relapses, these results should be interpreted with caution.  
One of the relevant prognostic factors for disability is the severity of the relapses. Some clues point out 
a better outcome for eculizumab: more placebo patients than patients treated with eculizumab had major 
relapses and need of hospitalization due to relapses. However, the disability scales measured during the 
acute episodes (differences between baseline relapse evaluation and 6 weeks evaluation) did not show 
differences between arms. Globally, there results did not allow concluding on the effect of eculizumab on 
the severity of the relapses. 
Given the pathogenic role of AQP-4 Ab in NMOSD, examining the titers course during the study appears 
of interest. AQP4-ab has been identified as risk factor for attacks under therapy and it is not clear whether 
the antibodies by themselves are sufficient to cause pathology, or whether ongoing inflammation is 
required. Monitoring of Abs is not currently recommended in routine clinical practice.  
No relationship could be established between AQP-4 Ab titers and eculizumab concentrations or relapses 
so that a specific recommendations could be given for treatment or monitoring of the response. Further 
graphical comparisons provided by the MAH showed no evidence of increased efficacy with increased 
eculizumab exposure, compatible with the use of a therapeutic dose that achieves maximal benefit.  
The maintenance of the effect of eculizumab for the treatment of patients with NMOSD was assessed in 
the open label treatment Study ECU-NMO-302. The study is still ongoing. Results from an interim analysis 
from the subset of patients who relapsed in Study 301 were provided at the time of submission (cut-off 
date of 31 May 2018 n=39). At request, further updated with cut-off date of 31 October 2018 (n=119) 
was provided given the uncertainties of the sustainability of the effect in the first cut-off. A total of 119 
patients were treated (41 patients in the placebo/eculizumab group and 78 patients in 
eculizumab/eculizumab group). Eculizumab (or placebo) was added on top of patient background therapy 
and no changes were allowed during the Study ECU-NMO-301. In Study ECU-NMO-302, the majority of 
patients were receiving concomitant treatment at entry (87 patients [73%]). During this extension study 
the concomitant treatment could be adapted. A total of 30 patients reduced the dose or stopped 
immunosuppressive medication.  
In total 10 patients had experienced 15 on-trial relapses as determined by the treating physician (9 in 
placebo/eculizumab group and 6 in eculizumab/eculizumab group. A total of 6 of these episodes were 
adjudicated by the RAC in 5 patients (2 in placebo/eculizumab group and 3 in the eculizumab/eculizumab 
group). Results from the second interim analysis indicated a positive effect on the maintenance of the 
response to eculizumab. The On-trial ARR were 0.174 for the placebo/eculizumab group and 0.111 for the 
eculizumab/eculizumab group during study ECU-NMO-302.  Both groups experienced a reduction of 
On-trial ARR with respect to the historical ARR (median 1.923).  When patients who received placebo in 
the Study ECU-NMO-301 were treated with eculizumab in Study ECU-MG-302 a median reduction 
(improvement) of -1.923 was reported. In patients previously treated with eculizumab the response was 
consistently maintained through Study ECU-NMO-302 with a median reduction -1.442. 
Updated results from Study 302 gave support to the eculizumab effect seen during the placebo-controlled 
phase. The improvement observed in the prevention of relapses was maintained during the reported 
period. The long-term efficacy of eculizumab in this population still limited, needs to be further 
documented. Therefore the results from the currently ongoing Study ECU-NMO-302 will have to be 
submitted. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of eculizumab over placebo on disease activity (time to first relapse) can be considered 
reasonably demonstrated, even though it seems difficult to precisely quantify the exact benefit of adding 
eculizumab to immunosupressors.  
The heterogeneity of the patients by the condition itself, the concomitant ISTs, and the number of strata 
may prevent from providing any useful information when the results are analysed considering the rather 
limited size of the study. In any case, the labelling of the product should reflect the population included in 
the Study.  
With respect to the main drawback of the dossier related to the low number of patients and the follow-up 
period which is still limited for a global picture of the maintenance of the effect the final results from the 
currently ongoing Study ECU-NMO-302 will have to be submitted. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety of eculizumab (Soliris®) has been evaluated in two Phase 3 clinical studies in patients with 
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).  
• 
• 
Phase 3 Pivotal: Study ECU-NMO-301; a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter Phase 3 study in 143 patients with relapsing NMOSD. The study was completed on 17 
Jul 2018. 
Phase 3 Supportive: Study ECU-NMO-302; an open-label, multicenter Phase 3 extension study of 
Study ECU-NMO-301 with a 4-week Blind Induction Phase followed by an Open-label Maintenance 
Phase (ongoing, with 119 patients continued from Study ECU-NMO-301 as of the clinical database 
cut-off date for this analysis of 31 October 2018). 
Safety analyses were performed on the Combined Safety Set (ie, all patients who received at least 1 dose 
of study drug [either eculizumab or placebo] in Study ECU-NMO-301) with cut-off date of 31 October 
2018 using the 4 treatment group designations described as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
ECU-NMO-301 placebo (n = 47) 
ECU-NMO-301 eculizumab (n = 96) 
ECU-NMO-302 eculizumab: All patients treated with eculizumab in that study (n = 119) 
•  All Eculizumab: All patients ever treated with eculizumab in either Studies ECU-NMO-301 or 
ECU-NMO-302 based on their eculizumab exposure (n = 137) 
NOTE: In the first submission, the applicant provided data for the ECU-NMO-302 eculizumab for n=39 (31 
May 2018). This information was thereafter updated and estimates in this assessment report were 
updated accordingly to reflect this updated safety information.   
Patient exposure 
A total of 143 adult patients with relapsing NMOSD were randomized and treated in Study ECU-NMO-301 
(96 in the eculizumab group and 47 in the placebo group). As of the clinical database cut-off date of 31 
October 2018, 119 of these patients had continued into the extension study, Study ECU-NMO-302, of 
whom 41 were in the placebo/eculizumab group and 78 were in the eculizumab/eculizumab. 
In Study ECU-NMO-301, the median (min, max) treatment duration was twice as long for the eculizumab 
group (89.43 weeks [3.1, 211.1 weeks]) as compared with the placebo group (41.29 weeks [6.1, 208.1 
weeks]). Overall treatment exposure was 170.0 PY for eculizumab and 51.5 PY for placebo. 
In Study ECU-NMO-302, as of 31 October 2018, the median (min, max) treatment duration was 20.00 
weeks (0.1, 198.4 weeks). Overall eculizumab exposure was 103.8 PY. 
At the time of the clinical database cut-off, the total median (min, max) treatment duration for 
eculizumab across Studies ECU-NMO-301 and ECU-NMO-302 combined (All Eculizumab group) was 99.00 
weeks (0.1, 237.9 weeks). Overall eculizumab exposure was 276.6 PY.  
The total median eculizumab treatment compliance rate in both studies was high (99.0% in the 
eculizumab group of Study ECU-NMO-301 and 100% in Study ECU-NMO-302). 
In Study ECU-NMO-301, the demographics of patients were similar in the 2 treatment groups. The 
majority (130 [90.9%]) of patients overall were female, White (70 [49.0%]) or Asian (52 [36.4%]); 14 
(9.8%) patients were of Japanese descent. 
In Study ECU-NMO-302, the majority (110 [92.4%]) of these 119 patients were female, White (61/119 
[51.3%]) or Asian (45/39 [37.8%]); 12 (10.1%) patients were of Japanese descent.

Adverse events 
Of the 143 patients in the Safety Set of Study ECU-NMO-301, 133 patients (93.0%) experienced TEAEs. 
The incidence of TEAEs was similar between the eculizumab (91.7%) and placebo groups (95.7%); the 
rate of TEAEs was lower in the eculizumab group (749.3 per 100 PY) than in the placebo group (1160.9 
per 100 PY). The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity and unrelated to the study drug (as 
determined by the Investigator). 
Of the 119 patients in the Extension Safety Set of Study ECU-NMO-302, 92 patients (77.3%) experienced 
TEAEs. The rate of TEAEs was 793.5 per 100 PY. The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity 
and unrelated to the study drug (as determined by the Investigator). 
A total 125 patients (91.2 %) in the Combined Safety Set (All Eculizumab group) experienced TEAEs at a 
rate of 763.1 PY. An overview of TEAEs for the Combined Safety Set is provided in Table 36.

Common Adverse Events 
In Study ECU-NMO-301, the rate of TEAEs was lower in the eculizumab group (754.0 events per 100 PY) 
than in the placebo group (1162.8 events per 100 PY), although the incidence of TEAEs was generally 
similar between the placebo and eculizumab groups. 
•  The most frequently reported TEAEs in the eculizumab group were upper respiratory tract infection 
(29.2% of patients with a rate of 31.2 events per 100 PY), headache (22.9% of patients with a rate 
of 55.0 events per 100 PY), and nasopharyngitis (20.8% of patients with a rate of 28.9 events per 100 
PY). 
•  The most frequently reported TEAEs in the placebo group were NMOSD (34.0% of patients with a rate 
of 33.9 events per 100 PY), nausea (25.5% of patients with a rate of 35.7 events per 100 PY), 
headache (23.4% of patients with a rate of 37.6 events per 100 PY), urinary tract infection (21.3% of 
patients with a rate of 24.5 events per 100PY and pain in extremity (21.3% of patients with a rate of 
20.7 events per 100 PY). 
In Study ECU-NMO-302, the most frequently reported TEAEs were headache (16.0% of patients with a 
rate of 55.0 events per 100 PY), nasopharyngitis (12.6% of patients with a rate of 28.0 events per 100 
PY), urinary tract infection (8.4% of patients with a rate of 29.8 events per 100 PY) and upper respiratory 
tract infection (8.4% of patients with a rate of 17.7 events per 100 PY). 
In the All Eculizumab group, the most frequently reported TEAEs were headache (27.0% of patients with 
a rate of 54.9 events per 100 PY), upper respiratory tract infection (25.5% of patients, with a rate of 25.9 
events per 100 PY), and nasopharyngitis (22.6% of patients with a rate of 28.3 events per 100 PY). 
AE that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients are shown for the Combined Safety Set in Table 37. The most 
frequently experienced TEAEs (≥ 20% of patients) in the All Eculizumab group by PT were headache (37 
[27.0%], upper respiratory tract infection (35 [25.5%] patients), and nasopharyngitis (31 [22.2%] 
patients. These TEAEs are consistent with those of existing eculizumab indications.

Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity (Table 36). In Study ECU-NMO-301, TEAEs that were 
designated as severe occurred at a rate of 17.4 events per 100 PY in the eculizumab group and 30.8 
events per 100 PY in the placebo group. The most frequently reported severe TEAEs in the eculizumab 
group were back pain, pain in extremity, pneumonia, and NMOSD (experienced by 2 [2.1%] patients 
each). The most frequently reported severe TEAE in the placebo group was NMOSD (6 [12.8%] patients), 
which was the only severe TEAE experienced by more than 1 patient in this group. 
In Study ECU-NMO-302, the rate of severe TEAEs was 30.8 events per 100 PY. The most frequently 
reported severe TEAEs were NMOSD (4 [3.4%] patients), and optic neuritis (2 [1.7%] patients) (optic 
neuritis reposted separately due to a MAH decision). In the All Eculizumab group, severe events were 
experienced by 24.8% of patients with a rate of 21.9 events per 100 PY. In the All Eculizumab group, 
severe TEAEs were reported with a rate of 21.9 events per 100 PY. The most frequently reported severe 
TEAE was NMOSD, which was experienced by 6 (4.4%) patients. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
One patient who was treated with eculizumab as part of this clinical program died. This patient was 
enrolled in Study ECU-NMO-301 and was randomized to eculizumab treatment: a 30-year-old Black or 
African American male tobacco user with relevant medical history of tracheal stenosis, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, sleep apnoea, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, and 
 
 
 
 
asthma. The first dose of eculizumab was administered on 12 May 2015. On 08 Jun 2017 (Study Day 
759), he received his last infusion of study drug. On 23 Jun 2017 (Study Day 774), the patient went for 
his next infusion of study drug, but he had shortness of breath and could barely talk and, therefore, was 
not infused and instead was transported to the hospital. Upon admission, the patient was diagnosed with 
pneumonia and infectious pleural effusion. The patient then developed sepsis, respiratory failure, and 
congestive heart failure. He was intubated and was transferred to the intensive care unit. On 24 Jun 2017 
(Study Day 775), a left thoracotomy with total pulmonary decortication was performed and cultures were 
obtained. Cultures yielded Streptococcus intermedius and Peptostreptococcus. On 26 Jun 2017 (Study 
Day 777), while the patient was still intubated, he developed progressive hypotension requiring 
vasopressor support and subsequently died. The Investigator reported that the cause of death was 
infectious pleural effusion.  
The Investigator considered the TESAEs of congestive cardiac failure, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and 
sepsis to be unlikely related to the study drug, while the event of infectious pleural effusion was 
considered probably related to the study drug. The organisms identified in culture, however, were 
suggestive of aspiration pneumonia. This, together with the patient’s risk factors for aspiration 
pneumonia, history of trachea stenosis and bronchiectasis, and use of azathioprine, all suggest factors 
(i.e., an aspiration event with secondary pneumonia) other than therapeutic intervention may have 
contributed to his clinical presentation and evolution of this outcome.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Of the 143 patients in the Safety Set of Study ECU-NMO-301, 56 patients (39.2%) experienced TESAEs. 
The incidence and rate of TESAEs was lower in the eculizumab group (31.3%, with 30.7 events per 100 
PY) than that reported in the placebo group (55.3%, with 88.4 events per 100 PY). Of the 119 patients in 
the Extension Safety Set of Study ECU-NMO-302, 26 patients (21.8.%) experienced TESAEs, with a rate 
of 49.4 events per 100 PY. In the All Eculizumab group the incidence of TESAEs was 36.5%, with a rate 
of 37.6 events per 100 PY (Table 39).  
The most frequently reported TESAE overall was NMOSD. Other TESAEs that were experienced by > 1 
patient in any safety net are displayed in Table 39.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were defined according to the important risks in the Risk 
Management Plan (RMP) Version 12.2 and based on events monitored as part of the post marketing signal 
detection activities. Adverse events of special interest include the following: 
a) Important identified risks  
• Infections (meningococcal infections, Aspergillus infections, and other serious infections) 
• Sepsis 
• Infusion reactions 
b) Events monitored as part of post marketing signal detection activities 
• Serious cutaneous adverse reactions 
• Cardiac disorders 
• Angioedema 
In Study ECU-NMO-301, treatment-emergent AESIs were experienced by 21.9% of patients in the 
eculizumab group and 21.3% of patients in the placebo group, with rates of 16.8 and 24.5 events per 100 
PY, respectively. Other serious infections were experienced by 11.5% of patients in the eculizumab group 
and 12.8% of patients in the placebo group, with rates of 8.1 and 15.1 events per 100 PY, respectively 
(Table 40). 
In Study ECU-NMO-302, treatment-emergent AESIs were experienced by 16.0% of patients, with a rate 
of 23.3 events per 100 PY. Other serious infections were experienced by 8.4% of patients, with a rate of 
13.1 events per 100 PY (Table 40). 
Treatment-emergent AESIs were experienced by 29.2% of patients in the All Eculizumab group, with a 
rate of 19.1 events per 100 PY. Other serious infections were experienced by 15.3% of patients, with a 
rate of 9.9 events per 100 PY (Table 40). 
There were no meningococcal infections reported in the NMOSD program (Table 40). However, a case 
with Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection was reported in the updated safety reported submitted in the first 
request for supplementary information. The patient, a 29-year-old female randomized to placebo in 
Study ECU-NMO-301, received the first induction dose of eculizumab on Study ECU-NMO-302 on 22 Jun 
2018; 4 days later (26 Jun 2018), the patient was hospitalized with fever, headache, body aches and neck 
tightness. The patient was diagnosed with a N. gonorrhoeae infection, and treated with empiric IV 
antibiotics. Six days later (02 Jul 2018), she was discharged with a peripherally inserted central catheter 
(PICC) line to continue ceftriaxone IV at home. The Investigator considered the events related to 
eculizumab. The SAEs of gonorrhoea and bacterial sepsis were considered resolved on 27 Jul 2018. The 
patient decided to withdraw from the study.  
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AESIs were ‘other serious infections’ (Table 40).

Rates are reported as per 100 PY. The TEAEs in Study ECU-NMO-301 are AEs with a start date on or after the date of 
the first dose of study drug in Study ECU-NMO-301 up to the day prior to the first dose date in Study ECU-NMO-302 or 
 
 
 
for patients who withdrew, up to the day of last contact. The TEAEs in Study ECU-NMO-302 are AEs with a start date 
on or after the date of the first dose of study drug in Study ECU-NMO-302. The TEAEs in the All Eculizumab group are 
AEs with a start date on or after the date of the patient’s first dose of eculizumab. 
Percentages are based on the total number of patients in the Combined Safety Set in the particular treatment group. 
If a patient had multiple events for a particular System Organ Class or Preferred Term, he/she is counted only once for 
that System Organ Class or Preferred Term. System Organ Classes are presented in alphabetic order. Preferred Terms 
are in the order of descending frequency in the All Eculizumab group. 
Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; PY = patient-years; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful differences between the placebo group and the eculizumab 
group in the change from Baseline in any haematology or chemistry parameters in Study ECU-NMO-301. 
No difference between treatment groups was observed in vital signs, ECG parameters, or the C-SSRS. 
In Study ECU-NMO-301, there was no substantial difference between treatment groups in changes 
related to suicidal ideation/behaviour during the study based on the C-SSRS. No patients were reported 
with suicidal behaviour in Study ECU-NMO-302. There was 1 shift in C-SSRS categories in a patient in the 
placebo/eculizumab group from no suicidal ideation at Baseline of Study ECU-NMO-301 to suicidal 
ideation during Study ECU-NMO-302. 
No pooled analysis of immunogenicity data was performed, because immunogenicity was not analysed as 
part of the interim analysis for Study ECU-NMO-302. In Study ECU-NMO-301, 2 patients in the 
eculizumab group were positive for ADAs post baseline (one patient had an ADA titer of 11.5 at Week 132 
and another had an ADA titer of 7.46 at Week 120. Both patients were negative for neutralizing 
antibodies. According to the applicant, these low titer positive results may reflect the actual biological 
variability of the test matrix.  
These results were consistent with the low rate of positive ADAs and NAbs observed previously for Soliris.  
Safety in special populations 
Use during Pregnancy 
No pregnant patients were enrolled in Study ECU-NMO-301. Two pregnancies were reported during Study 
ECU-NMO-301: 1 pregnancy in a patient who opted for a therapeutic abortion and continued in the study, 
and 1 pregnancy in the partner of a male patient. The partner of the male patient delivered a female infant 
by caesarean section at 35 weeks gestation; Apgar scores of 8 (max Apgar is 10) were recorded at first 
and second check. There were no malformations or abnormalities noted at birth. The infant was admitted 
to the intensive care unit for jaundice, being premature, and being at risk for congenital hip dysplasia. No 
further information was available regarding the infant. As of the clinical database cut-off date, no 
pregnancies had been reported in Study ECU-NMO-302. 
Use during Lactation 
No breastfeeding patients were enrolled in Study ECU-NMO-301. No breastfeeding patients were enrolled 
in Study ECU-NMO-302 as of the clinical database cut-off date for the interim analysis. 
Geriatric Use 
No apparent age-related differences were observed in the NMOSD program. The number of patients aged 
65 and over (n = 9) was not sufficient to determine whether they responded differently from younger 
patients. 
Paediatric Use 
The safety and effectiveness of eculizumab therapy in paediatric patients with NMOSD below the age of 
18 have not been established. 
Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment 
The safety and efficacy of eculizumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Use in Patients with Renal Impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery 
There are no data to suggest that eculizumab affects the ability to drive or operate machinery or impairs 
mental ability. No studies have been conducted to assess these issues, as adverse event profiles 
suggested no cause for concern.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug interactions were not studied in Studies ECU-NMO-301 and ECU-NMO-302. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Study ECU-NMO-301, 16 (16.7%) patients in the eculizumab group and 3 (6.4%) patients in the 
placebo group discontinued the study. Two patients discontinued Study ECU-NMO-301 due to TEAEs; 
both of these patients were in the placebo group: 
− A 63-year-old White female patient. Her first dose of placebo was administered on 24 Sep 2014. In Mar 
2015 (exact date not provided), the patient experienced an event of pneumonia, which resulted in study 
drug being withdrawn. The Investigator considered the pneumonia to be probably related to study drug 
(placebo). The patient discontinued from the study on 12 May 2015 (Study Day 231) and was 
subsequently reported to have died on 29 May 2015. The final cause of death was pneumonia with a 
secondary diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. 
− A 53-year-old Asian female patient. Her first dose of placebo was administered on 20 Aug 2015. The 
patient experienced an AE of prerenal failure and an SAE of pancytopenia on 22 Aug 2016 (Study Day 
369). Both events resulted in study drug being withdrawn. The prerenal failure was considered resolved 
on 28 Aug 2016 (Study Day 375) and the pancytopenia on 13 Oct 2016 (Study Day 421). The patient was 
discontinued from the study due to the event of pancytopenia on 13 Oct 2016. The Investigator 
considered the event of prerenal failure to be unlikely related to study drug (placebo), and the event of 
pancytopenia to be possibly related to study drug (placebo). 
In Study ECU-NMO-302, 6/39 (15.4%) patients had discontinued as of the clinical database cut-off date 
for the interim analysis (31 October 2018). One patient in Study ECU-NMO-302 (placebo/eculizumab) 
discontinued treatment due to 2 events of worsening of systemic lupus erythematosus and to newly 
diagnosed autoimmune thyroiditis and Sjogren’s syndrome.  The patient received her last dose of study 
drug on 10 Apr 2018 and discontinued from the study on 04 Jun 2018. The events of Sjogren’s syndrome, 
autoimmune thyroiditis, and one event of worsening systemic lupus erythematous were ongoing at the 
time of study discontinuation. The Investigator considered all 4 events to be possibly related to study 
drug. 
 
Overdose, Drug Abuse, Withdrawal and Rebound  
There has been no known occurrence of a patient receiving an overdose of eculizumab during clinical 
studies in NMOSD. 
The potential for drug abuse was not investigated or reported in human clinical studies of eculizumab. 
However, based on the pharmacological profile of eculizumab and the available post marketing data, 
there is no evidence of abuse or dependency. 
Withdrawal or rebound effect was not specifically investigated in the clinical studies of eculizumab. 
Patients with NMOSD who discontinue treatment with eculizumab should be carefully monitored for signs 
and symptoms of disease worsening and relapse. 
Long-Term Safety in Complement-Mediated Diseases 
Clinical Studies of gMG and NMOSD 
Since NMOSD and generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) are autoimmune, complement-mediated 
inflammatory neurologic disorders in which patients are commonly treated with ISTs, NMOSD safety data 
from ECU-NMO-302 and All Eculizumab group were compared with the long-term safety data of gMG in 
Study ECU-MG-302. 
The total exposure to eculizumab was similar for the populations in the final analysis of Study 
ECU-MG-302 (274.8 PY) and the All Eculizumab group in the NMOSD program (282.3 PY).  
In study ECU-MG-302, the last patient completed the study on 15 Jan 2019. A total of 117 patients 
received eculizumab for a median duration of approximately 2.7 years (median [min, max] of 972 days 
[1, 1372]). The incidence of TEAEs and TESAEs was 97.4% and 51.3% respectively. Common TEAEs 
(reported in > 20% of patients) included: headache (40.2% of patients, 27.3 events per 100 PY), 
nasopharyngitis (35.9% of patients, 30.9 events per 100 PY), diarrhoea (24.8% of patients, 15.6 events 
per 100 PY), myasthenia gravis (24.8% of patients, 17.8 events per 100 PY), and upper respiratory tract 
infection (23.9% of patients, 23.3 events per 100 PY). The most frequently reported TESAEs were in the 
System Organ Class of Infections and infestations (26 patients [22.2%]) and Nervous system disorders 
(22 patients [18.8%]). The most common TESAEs reported within the Infections and infestations SOC 
were pneumonia (4 patients [3.4%]) and gastroenteritis and sepsis (3 patients each, 2.6%). MG 
deterioration was the most common event (16 [13.7%]) in the Nervous system disorders. Overall, the 
safety profile of eculizumab in gMG patients is consistent with that observed in the other approved 
indications.  
Post marketing experience 
At the time of this submission, eculizumab had been approved for the treatment of PNH in 50 countries, 
aHUS in 49 countries, and refractory gMG or gMG in 34 countries. From post-marketing experience, the 
estimated exposure to eculizumab since the international birthdate (16 Mar 2007) through 28 Feb 2019 
is 48,835.8 PY. After 10 years of post-marketing experience with eculizumab, the safety profile had 
remained stable, with the following important identified and important potential risks being closely 
monitored: 
• 
Important identified risks: meningococcal infections, serious infections (including sepsis), Aspergillus 
infection, severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications after discontinuation of eculizumab in 
aHUS patients, and infusion reactions. 
• 
Important potential risks: serious haemolysis after discontinuation of eculizumab in PNH patients, 
malignancies and haematological abnormalities in PNH patients, immunogenicity, and serious 
infection in neonates after maternal exposure to eculizumab. 
These important risks are managed by a comprehensive Risk Management Plan (RMP) with 
post-marketing reporting rates remaining stable over the last 10 years (Periodic Safety Update Report 16, 
dated 03 Dec 2018). 
From the important identified risks, the most significant risk is meningococcal infection. This is a 
well-characterized risk known to be associated with C5 inhibition (Lewis, 2014). While meningococcal 
disease is rare, the use of eculizumab is associated with > 1000-fold increase in the incidence of 
meningococcal disease (McNamara, 2017), similar to increased risk in patients with inherited or persistent 
complement deficiency diseases (Figueroa, 1991). To mitigate this risk, routine and additional risk 
mitigation measures are in place in all indications in which eculizumab has been approved or is being 
developed. The post-marketing reporting rate of meningococcal infection over the 10 years of 
post-marketing experience remained stable at approximately 0.3 per 100 PY. The reporting rate for fatal 
outcomes has also remained stable at 0.03 per 100 PY, representing 9.2% of patients who experienced 
meningococcal infections, which is similar to the reporting rate from the general population (10 to 15%) 
(Rosenstein, 1999; van Deuren, 2000). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The eculizumab clinical development programme for NMOSD consisted of one Phase 3 study (Study 
ECU-NMO-301) and its open label extension (Study ECU-NMO-302), involving a total of 143 patients.   
Overall, 137 patients were exposed to eculizumab as of the cut-off date of 31 October 2018 (276.6.8 
patient years of exposure). The extension Study ECU-NMO-302 is still ongoing and the final evaluation of 
efficacy is planned for a maximum duration for each patient of 5.5 years (or product registration in the 
country, whichever occurs first). Given the low prevalence of NMOSD, drug exposure can be considered 
acceptable for the short-term safety assessment of eculizumab. The available safety information of 
eculizumab in the already authorised indications can be taken as supportive taking into account that for 
several conditions (aHUS, gMG) patients have been treated with the same dosing regimen. The long-term 
safety profile was still based on a limited number of participants in Study ECU-NMO-302 including 119 
participants (78 patients in the eculizumab/eculizumab and 41 patients in the placebo/eculizumab group) 
with 104 patients exposed to eculizumab for ≥ 12 months and 67 patients exposed to eculizumab for > 
24 months.  
In the safety net, 90% of patients were women, the mean age was 45 years (ranging from 19 to 76 
years). European patients represent one third of the global population.  Overall, 19 patients discontinued 
in Study ECU-NMO-301 the majority while being treated with Eculizumab. Two of them (on placebo) 
discontinued due to adverse events.  Nine patients discontinued in Study ECU-NMO-302, one of them due 
to adverse events. 
Most patients included in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study reported AEs: in the eculizumab group 
(91.7%) and in the placebo group (95.7%). Of them, 51.0% of eculizumab-treated patients versus 
57.4% of patients receiving placebo reported AEs considered related. In the open label extension study, 
77.3% patients reported AEs and of them, 33.6% were related AEs.  
In the placebo-controlled study upper respiratory infection (29.2% vs 12.8% for eculizumab and placebo, 
respectively), headache (22.9% vs 23.4%), nasopharyngitis (20.8% vs 19.1%), nausea (16.7% vs 
25.5%), urinary tract infection  (13.5% vs 21.3%), back pain (14.6% vs 12.8%), diarrhea (15.6% vs 
14.9%), were the most frequently reported AEs in both eculizumab and placebo groups. During the 
open-label extension headache (16%), nasopharyngitis (12.8%), urinary tract infection (8.4%) and 
upper respiratory infection (8.4%) were also the most frequently reported AEs.  
The majority of the events were of mild or moderate severity. In ECU-NMO-301, severe events were 
reported by 18 of patients treated with eculizumab (18.8%) vs 12 (25.5%) of those on placebo. In 
ECU-NMO-302, 17 (14.3%) patients reported severe AE. Most severe AEs reported were NMOSD related. 
Except for those AEs related to the underlying NMOSD condition, no new adverse events have been 
reported for eculizumab in this new population. Overall, the AE profile is consistent with that known for 
eculizumab in other indications.  
There was one death in Study 301. One 30-year-old male with COPD was hospitalized due to pneumonia 
and pleural effusion. He had been receiving eculizumab for more than 2 years. He developed sepsis, 
respiratory failure and congestive heart failure. Streptococcus intermedius and Peptostreptococcus were 
isolated. It was considered probably related to treatment. 
Of the 143 patients in the Safety Set of Study ECU-NMO-301, 56 patients (39.2%) experienced TESAEs. 
Apart from SAEs related to the condition (NMOSD, optic neuritis) the most frequently reported SAEs were 
those related to infections. Similar profile was observed of ECU-NMO-302.  
Adverse events of special interest included infections (meningococcal infections, aspergillus infections, 
and any serious infection), sepsis, infusion-related reactions, serious cutaneous reactions, cardiac 
disorders, and angioedema.  
During the controlled study 21.3% patients on placebo and 21.9% patients on eculizumab reported an 
AESI. No relevant differences were observed in the incidence the events between eculizumab and placebo 
groups; however the number of events by group was small. No meningococcal or aspergillosis infections 
have been reported. In Study ECU-NMO-302, treatment-emergent AESIs were experienced by 16.0% of 
patients. There were no meningococcal infections reported in the NMOSD program but a case of Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae (sepsis) was reported.  
Since only 9 elderly patients (3 on placebo, 6 on eculizumab) were enrolled in NMOSD program it was not 
possible to obtain any reliable safety conclusion in this population. Regarding the safety of eculizumab in 
children/adolescents an open-label, uncontrolled trial to evaluate safety and activity of eculizumab as 
add-on to background immunosuppressive therapy in children from 2 to less than 18 years of age with 
relapsing NMOSD is planned to be completed by October 2021. 
The post marketing data do not seem to show any new safety concern.  Overall, the AE profile is 
consistent with that known for eculizumab in other indications. As a consequence of this new application 
RMP is to be updated accordingly.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In general treatment with eculizumab was well tolerated and the safety profile is considered acceptable 
for the intended target population.  Overall, the AE profile is consistent with that known for eculizumab in 
other indications, with no unexpected findings. From the data presented, it seems that the underlying 
condition is contributing to a high extent to the overall reporting of AEs in both treatment arms.  
The extension study is still ongoing, and there is a rather limited long-term safety database. The update 
provided shows that no relevant safety concerns have been raised with respect to the previous 
assessment and also to other indications.   
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
The final results from the current ongoing Study ECU-NMO-302 should be submitted to EMA within 6 
months after conclusion. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 19.3 is acceptable. In addition, minor 
revisions were recommended to be taken into account. The MAH is requested to send in a separate 
procedure a revised study protocol along with the relevant justifications on the changes in the sections: 
Section 5 ‘PNH registry objectives and purpose’, Section 6.1 on Data collection and Section 11 on Data 
Analysis. The PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
In addition, the address of the MAH has been updated in PI.   
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Soliris 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion. The 
bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Soliris is indicated in adults for the treatment of NMOSD in patients who are AQP4 antibody-positive. 
NMOSD is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by a relapsing course of 
optic neuritis, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, and less frequently, postrema area syndrome, 
acute brainstem syndrome, acute diencephalic clinical syndrome or symptomatic cerebral syndrome.  
10% of the patients have a monophasic course of the disease.  
On average, relapses tend to occur within the first year following an initial event in 60% of patients and 
within three years in 90%. In NMOSD, relapses are typically severe with incomplete recovery leading to 
rapid development of permanent disability 
The AQP4 serum autoantibody is a specific pathogenic marker for NMOSD, although 20% percent of 
patients with a clinical diagnosis of NMOSD are seronegative for AQP-4-IgG 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Disability is attack related and the early treatment of the relapses together with prevention of further 
episodes is essential for reducing progressive accumulation of neurologic disability. Acute episodes are 
generally treated with high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids and therapeutic plasma exchange in 
patients with severe symptoms, unresponsive to glucocorticoids.   
Regarding the prevention of relapses, immunosuppressive therapies are recommended at early stages in 
NMOSD patients. No medicinal product is approved for this indication. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The eculizumab clinical development program in NMOSD includes 2 clinical studies:  
• A Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of eculizumab in patients with NMOSD (Study ECU-NMO-301; completed).  
• A Phase 3, open-label, multicenter extension study of Study ECU-NMO-301 to evaluate the 
long-term safety and efficacy of eculizumab in the treatment of patients with NMOSD (Study 
ECU-NMO-302; ongoing). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
NMOSD patients treated with eculizumab have shown a significantly lower relapse rate than patients on 
placebo. The primary endpoint, time to first adjudicated on-trial relapse was met with a 94.2% reduction 
in the risk of (first on study) relapse. A total of 23 relapses (20 in the placebo group [42.6%] and 3 in 
eculizumab group [3.1%]) were adjudicated by the external committee (RAC). Pre-specified sensitivity 
analysis of the primary endpoint (time to first On-trial relapse determined by the treating physician) 
showed a statistically significant difference between eculizumab y placebo. A total of 14 (14.6%) patients 
on eculizumab and 29 (61.7%) on placebo had an on-trial relapse (p < 0.0001). 
The adjusted annualized (adjudicated) rate of relapses (95% CI) was 0.016 (0.005, 0.050) in the 
eculizumab group versus 0.350 (0.199, 0.616) in the placebo group, representing a 95% reduction over 
placebo (p <0.0001). When using the analysis based on relapses determined by the investigator, the 
reduction over placebo in the annualized rate of relapse was 85.3%, for eculizumab compared to placebo 
(p <0.0001).  
The updated results from Study 302 give support to the eculizumab effect seen during the 
placebo-controlled phase. The rate of On-trial ARR was 0.174 95%CI (0.091, 0.335) for the 
placebo/eculizumab group and 0.111 95%CI (0.050, 0.247) for the eculizumab/eculizumab group during 
study ECU-NMO-302. Both groups experienced a reduction of On-trial ARR with respect to the historical 
ARR (median 1.923). When patients who received placebo in the Study ECU-NMO-301 were treated with 
eculizumab in Study ECU-NMO-302 a median reduction (improvement) of -1.923 was reported. In 
patients previously treated with eculizumab the response was consistently maintained through Study 
ECU-NMO-302 with a median reduction -1.442. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Eculizumab (or placebo) was administered on top of the background therapy. This study approach is likely 
to be better accepted by patients and clinicians in a condition where the treatment for prevention of 
further attacks is recommended at early stages in seropositive patients. In this situation it would be 
expected that patients were receiving relapse prevention at recruitment. However, 34 patients (23.8% of 
recruited patients) were not being treated with any supportive IST at baseline note, and 10 patients had 
not received any prior supportive IST for NMOSD. The position of the applicant was that they may 
represent a group of patients with active disease (as they met inclusion criteria) with unsatisfactory 
response to previous treatments (24/34 were previously treated). An alternative explanation is that they 
may represent a subset with better evolution/prognosis (mild relapses that no requires treatment). At 
request, the MAH provided the results of a subgroup analysis in order to document the efficacy of 
eculizumab in some subpopulations less represented in the study and support a broad indication. Overall, 
the efficacy was comparable between groups (eculizumab vs placebo) regardless the selected criteria 
(time since diagnosis, disability burden, relapse history, prior IST use, concomitant IST use). The 
“time-to-event” design of the study and the fact that patients ended their participation when the first 
relapse occurred entailed a difference in study exposure (patients at risk) between arms and it does not 
allow evaluating the effect of eculizumab versus placebo on time to further relapses. Additionally, when 
the 23 relapses were achieved and the study formally ended a total of 81 patients (66 on eculizumab, 15 
on placebo) were censored without having experienced a relapse, so that the effect of eculizumab versus 
placebo in these participants was not determined in Study ECU-NMO-301.  
Results from Study ECU-NMO-301 did not confirm a robust effect on disability. One of the relevant 
prognostic factors for disability is the severity of the relapses. Whereas eculizumab group showed some 
benefit (less major relapses or need of hospitalization than placebo group) the low number of relapses in 
eculizumab patients did not allow concluding on the effect of eculizumab on the severity of the relapses. 
Additionally no significant effect in terms of EDSS score or HAI score was observed. 
Only patients with active, relapsing disease were recruited. It is under discussion whether patients with 
monophasic forms of NMOSD correspond to a different condition (it has been described that monophasic 
patients were younger, had equal sex ratios, more commonly presented with simultaneous ON and TM, 
and had better outcomes).  In this case, Study 301 results will unlikely to be extrapolated to this 
monophasic subset of patients.   
It is unknown whether the response observed in patients mainly suffering from classic NMO forms (optic 
neuritis, transverse myelitis) can be assumed by those with less represented, brain forms of NMOSD 
(brainstem forms, diencephalic syndrome, area postrema syndrome). 
Only seropositive patients were included in the clinical programme.  There are some differences apparent 
between seropositive and seronegative patients based on age onset, gender ratios, clinical course, which 
questions whether these patients represent a distinct clinical subgroup of NMO compared to patients with 
AQP4-mediated disease.  Therefore, the extrapolation of the results to these patients may be 
problematic.  
A number of uncertainties are referred to the effect of eculizumab on some populations: 
• 
The limited number of elderly patients (n=9; 3 on placebo, 6 on eculizumab) does not allow 
concluding on the effect of eculizumab in this population.  
•  No children/adolescents were included in Study 301. A dedicated study is conducted and results are 
expected by October 2021 as part of the pediatric investigational plan.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Upper respiratory infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea, urinary tract infection, back pain, 
diarrhoea were the most frequently reported AEs in patients treated with eculizumab. Overall, the AE 
profile is consistent with that known for eculizumab in other indications, with no unexpected findings. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Since only 9 elderly patients (3 on placebo, 6 on eculizumab) were enrolled in NMOSD program it is not 
possible to obtain any reliable safety conclusion in this population.  
No data on children/adolescents are available and results from the specific study agreed in the PIP will not 
be available until 2021. 
Given the low prevalence of NMOSD, drug exposure can be considered acceptable for the short-term 
safety assessment of eculizumab.  As for the long-term safety profile, the safety database is still limited 
(n=119) and followed over a relatively short period for drawing a conclusion. The long-term efficacy of 
eculizumab in this population needs to be further documented. Therefore the results from the currently 
ongoing Study ECU-NMO-302 will have to be submitted.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Relapses are the principal contributors to NMO-related disability. Thus, reducing the frequency and 
severity of relapses is a key therapeutic goal. Eculizumab significantly reduced the relapse rate in NMOSD 
patients compared to placebo. The difference was statistically significantly shown when both relapses 
were assessed by the treating physician and when they were confirmed by an independent adjudication 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
committee. This was also supported by the reduction of 95% over placebo in annualized relapse rate. 
There is a delay in the relapse rate in the active patients with NMOSD who received eculizumab mostly on 
top of the current immunosupressors. From a clinical perspective, this represents a clinically meaningful 
benefit. 
Overall, the AE profile is consistent with that known for eculizumab in other indications, with no 
unexpected findings. Given the low prevalence of NMOSD, drug exposure can be considered acceptable 
for the short-term safety assessment of eculizumab.  As for the long-term safety profile, the safety 
database is still limited regarding the number of patients and the length of follow-up. The available safety 
information of eculizumab in the already authorised indications can be taken as supportive taking into 
account that for several conditions (aHUS, gMG) patients have been treated with the same dosing 
regimen.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
No drug or treatment has been studied in NMOSD in randomized, controlled studies. Therapeutic 
recommendations are mainly based on results from retrospective cohort analyses and uncontrolled trials. 
Study ECU-NMO-301 was a prospective, randomized, study controlled with placebo, so that the evidence 
provided was higher than that available at present. 
Results from the study are positive, and the use of eculizumab in adults with relapsing NMOSD patients 
with anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody-in most of the cases on top of immnusopressor based therapy,  
postponed the following relapse. This benefit was observed with a known safety profile which seems 
tolerable enough in the current disease. 
Within the submitted study, two groups of patients were unrepresented or poorly reflected. The former is 
the a priori a population with better prognosis (either, de novo patients or those with fewer relapses than 
the included in the inclusion criteria) and the latter was the group of patients without 
immunosupressor-based therapy. With this in mind, the MAH provided the results of a subgroup analysis 
in order to document the efficacy of eculizumab in some subpopulations less represented in the study and 
support a broad indication. However, despite the positive results from these analyses, the limitations 
associated to these ones hinder to reach a clear conclusion. Nevertheless, based on the mechanism of 
action of the drug, the CHMP was of the opinion that the final wording of the indication should not be 
strictly reflected the inclusion criteria of the pivotal study. On the other hand, it was also agreed that 
some limitations should be included in the indication taking into consideration the original intention of the 
study eligibility criteria to exclude patients with monophasic disease.   
Therefore, and according to the available evidence, eculizumab could be indicated in adult patients for the 
treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 
(AQP4) antibody-positive with a relapsing course of the disease (see section 5.1).

Please refer to the assessment report: human coagulation 
Germany initiated a procedure on 6 July 2016 based 
on concerns resulting from the evaluation of data 
from pharmacovigilance activities. 
The PRAC was requested to assess the potential 
impact of the results of the SIPPET study (which 
concluded that recombinant factor VIII medicines 
had a higher incidence of inhibitor development than 
plasma-derived medicines), and to issue a 
recommendation as to whether the marketing 
authorisations of these products should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked.  The EMA 
concluded in September 2017 that there is no clear 
and consistent evidence of a difference in the 
incidence of inhibitor development between the two 
classes of factor VIII medicines: those derived from 
plasma and those made by recombinant DNA 
factor VIII - EMEA/H/A-31/1448

technology. Due to the different characteristics of 
individual products within the two classes, EMA 
concluded that the risk of inhibitor development 
should be evaluated individually for each medicine, 
regardless of class. The risk for each product will 
continue to be assessed as more evidence becomes 
available.

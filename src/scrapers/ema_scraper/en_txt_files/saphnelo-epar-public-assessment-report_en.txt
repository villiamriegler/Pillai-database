1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant AstraZeneca AB submitted on 8 October 2020 an application for marketing authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Saphnelo, through the centralised procedure falling within 
the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 25 January 2018.  
The applicant applied for the following indication “TRADENAME is indicated as an add-on therapy for 
the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), despite 
standard therapy (see section 5.1).” 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or studies. 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0239/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0239/2020 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.4.2.  New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance anifrolumab contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
1.5.  Scientific advice 
The applicant received the following Scientific advice on the development relevant for the indication

The Scientific advice pertained to the following quality, non-clinical, and clinical aspects: 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on the development of anifrolumab on 23 
October 2014 (EMEA/H/SA/2903/1/2014/III), 26 May 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/2903/2/2016/II), 14 
December 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/2903/1/FU/1/2017/II), 26 July 2018 (EMEA/H/SA/2903/3/2018/III) and 
20 September 2018 (EMEA/H/SA/2903/4/2018/II). The Scientific Advice pertained to the following 
quality, non-clinical, and clinical aspects: 
• 
• 
Acceptability of the manufacturing process. 
Acceptability of the non-clinical safety programme. 
Acceptability of the immunogenicity assessment 
• 
• 
Acceptability of not conducting drug-drug interaction studies 
Acceptability of the dose selection, target population, of the SLEDAI as the primary endpoint, 
statistical testing strategy, management of SOC based on fixed criteria, CLASI to measure skin 
disease, definition of flare, inclusion of PROs, placebo-controlled design of the Phase III studies. 
• 
•  Acceptability of the treatment concepts for low disease activity patients 
Introducing an endpoint of LLDAS (lupus low disease activity state) and its definition into a planned 
Phase III study with s.c. administered anifrolumab 
Sufficiency of the safety database 
As regards intravenous use, the advice has mostly been complied with. The following points are noted: 
• 
The CHMP noted that patients proposed to be enrolled could not necessarily be characterised as 
patients failing an optimised SOC background therapy regimen and recommended that the patient 
population should consist of patients with active disease despite optimised standard therapy (not just 
steroids or requiring only observation). However, in studies 04 and 05, the minimum requirements for 
background medication did in fact permit enrolment of patients who were only receiving steroids, and 
the protocols did not include any particular requirements regarding optimisation of background 
therapy; on the other hand, actual presence of active disease at baseline was captured with minimum 
thresholds for SLEDAI and BILAG. 
• 
Regarding OCS tapering, the CHMP recommended to start the tapering from Week 12 and that 
the OCS dose should be maintained at the Week 40 dose level between Weeks 41 and 52, i.e. not to 
permit increases or decreases as per the protocol. 
• 
Due to differences in disease characteristics between paediatric and adult-onset SLE, the CHMP 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 10/198 
 
 
 
recommended enrolling only adult-onset patients, unless the applicant can power the study sufficiently 
for both populations. This recommendation was not followed in studies 04 and 05, but the applicant 
has sufficiently justified the deviation. 
• 
The CHMP recommended that the applicant consider a treatment period longer than 12 months 
for at least one study. Within the application, data is provided in terms of a 52-week treatment period 
from all three key studies, and the extension study 09 in which efficacy will be assessed over a 3 year 
treatment period is still ongoing. 
• 
In the 2014 SA, the CHMP noted ADA positivity in >10% of subjects prior to exposure to the drug 
and almost two thirds of this ADA positivity could not be reproduced. The CHMP concluded that 
considerable matrix effects compared to the original validation data are obviously involved, and 
advised the applicant to evaluate the reason for this. This advice has been followed, although in the 
studies, the observed prevalence of ADA in drug-naïve scleroderma and SLE patients ranged from 
2.3% to 5.7% and the incidence of ADA during the trials was higher in the placebo groups than the 
active groups. As a conclusion, the reported numbers of subjects with ADA are obviously unreliable. 
This uncertainty is reflected in the final SmPC.

The applicant has sought marketing authorisation for anifrolumab for the following indication: 
Anifrolumab  is  indicated  as  an  add-on  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  moderate  to 
severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), despite standard therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The incidence and prevalence rates of SLE across the world are generally estimated at 0.3 to 23.7 cases 
per  100.000  person-years  and  6.5  to  178.0  cases  per  100.000  persons,  respectively,  although  these 
types of estimates can be considered conservative as they do not capture cases of mild, undiagnosed, 
or misdiagnosed disease. There are wide geographical variations in the incidence and prevalence of SLE 
based on sex, age, and ethnicity. Systemic lupus erythematosus disproportionally affects females over 
males (~9:1) and primarily affects women of childbearing potential. Incidence and prevalence rates in 
people of African or Asian descent are 2 to 3 times higher than in Caucasian populations. In addition, 
non-Caucasians  often  have  more  severe  clinical  manifestations,  such  as  increased  haematological, 
serosal, neurological, and renal manifestations, and accrue more damage over time and at a faster pace. 
In about 15%-20% of cases, disease onset occurs during childhood and tends to be more severe with 
faster and more severe damage accrual. 
Compared  to  the  general  population,  the  overall  mortality  in  SLE  is  elevated,  with  a  standardised 
mortality ratio (defined as the ratio of the number of deaths observed to deaths expected) of 2.4 reported 
in a large international cohort of 9.457 subjects followed for over 70.000 subject-years. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The  aetiology  of  SLE  is  considered  multifactorial,  with  genetic,  hormonal  and  environmental  factors 
playing  important  parts.  So  far,  no  single  abnormality  of  the  immune  system  is  viewed  as  solely 
responsible  for  the  development  of  the  disease.  Activation  of  autoreactive  B-cells,  production  of 
numerous autoantibodies and immune complex formation causing tissue injury and organ damage, are 
believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis. The interplay of a number of other factors including 
T-cells,  antigen-presenting  cells,  cytokines,  the  complement  system  and  apoptosis  has  also  been 
considered important. Moreover, the disease pathogenesis of SLE includes activation of innate immunity, 
with increased production of type I interferons, including IFNα. 
Type  I  interferons  include  14  IFNα  family  members,  IFNβ,  IFNτ,  IFNκ  and  IFNω.  This  cytokine  family 
regulates  immune  functions  of  cellular  components  of  both  innate  and  adaptive  immune  systems, 
including dendritic cells, T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. For example, type I interferons promote 
dendritic  cell  maturation,  memory  CD8+  T-cell  proliferation,  natural  killer-cell  activation,  and  B-cell 
differentiation. 
According to the applicant, multiple lines of evidence indicate a role of type I interferons (IFNs) in the 
pathogenesis of SLE as well as in other IFN-driven autoimmune diseases. Type I IFNs stimulate dendritic 
cell  maturation,  autoantibody  production,  immune  complex  formation,  organ  inflammation,  and  the 
further production of type I IFNs that drive autoimmunity. Whereas healthy individuals switch off type I

IFN signalling in the absence of viral infections, the majority of SLE patients have sustained IFN signalling 
that leads to an over-expression of type I IFN-regulated genes (a type I IFN gene signature). Most adult 
patients with SLE (approximately 60% to 80%) express elevated levels of type I IFN-inducible genes, 
which have been associated with increased disease activity and severity. Given the central role of the 
IFN  pathway  in  the  pathogenesis  of  SLE,  targeting  type  I  IFN  signalling  is  expected  to  provide  a 
therapeutic benefit for SLE patients. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
SLE is a chronic, multisystemic, disabling autoimmune rheumatic disease of unknown aetiology. Clinical 
manifestations of SLE can include constitutional symptoms, alopecia and rashes, serositis, inflammatory 
arthritis,  renal  disease,  systemic  vasculitis,  lymphadenopathy,  splenomegaly,  haemolytic  anaemia, 
cognitive dysfunction, and other central nervous system involvement. Arthritis and photosensitive skin 
rash  are  common  presenting  features.  Patients  may  present  with  a  single  or  a  variety  of  clinical 
manifestations and the most frequent serologic finding (an abnormal anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) test) 
is sensitive but not specific for the diagnosis. This can make diagnosis and management of the disease 
challenging. 
The  manifestations  and  progression  of  SLE  are  unpredictable  and  include  periods  of  chronic  activity, 
clinically  inactive  periods,  and  phases  with  heightened  disease  activity  (‘disease  flares’).  Due  to  the 
variable nature of the disease and its treatment, patients experience reduced physical function, loss of 
employment, and significantly worse health-related quality of life. According to a recent survey of over 
2000 SLE patients, severe fatigue was ranked as one of their most burdensome symptoms. Increased 
hospitalisations and side effects of medications add to the disease burden. 
Uncontrolled,  ongoing  disease  activity  over  time  has  been  associated  with  poorer  outcomes,  such  as 
organ damage and coronary artery disease in SLE. Higher doses of medications to control disease activity 
are associated with cumulative and irreversible organ damage (such as premature cataracts, retinopathy, 
osteoporotic  fractures,  cardiovascular  damage,  avascular  necrosis,  and  infections  and  early  mortality 
from causes such as infection and cardiovascular disease), shortening lifespan by about 10 years. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Most of the current therapies for SLE are non-specific and inhibit broad inflammatory pathways. For mild 
disease, first line treatments include anti-malarials (hydroxychloroquine) and oral corticosteroids (OCSs; 
e.g., prednisone). NSAIDs are used for temporary symptom control, but, in contrast to glucocorticoids 
and  immunosuppressants,  have  no  impact  on  disease  progression.  Steroids  remain  a  mainstay  of 
treatment for mild to severe disease. Additional treatment options for moderate to severe disease include 
immunosuppressants,  such  as  methotrexate,  azathioprine,  and  mycophenolate  mofetil.  Each  of  these 
classes of agents are however associated with potentially significant toxicity and are sometimes poorly 
tolerated. 
The  only  targeted  therapy  for  SLE  is  belimumab  (Benlysta),  a  monoclonal  antibody  targeting  soluble 
human B Lymphocyte Stimulator protein. Belimumab blocks the binding of soluble BLyS, a B cell survival 
factor,  to  its  receptors  on  B  cells  and  inhibits  B  cell  survival  and  differentiation  into  immunoglobulin-
producing plasma cells. Belimumab is authorised in the EU since July 2011 as add-on therapy in adult 
patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of 
disease activity (e.g., positive anti-dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy. Benlysta has 
recently been indicated in combination with background immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment 
of adult patients with active lupus nephritis.

2.2.  About the product 
Anifrolumab is a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody directed against subunit 1 of the type I interferon 
receptor (IFNAR1). Anifrolumab inhibits the binding of type I interferon to IFNAR1 blocking the biologic 
activity of type I IFNs. The constant domain of the IgG heavy chain on anifrolumab was intentionally 
modified  to  eliminate  FcγRI,  FcγRIIA  and  FcγRIIB,  FcγRIIIA  and  C1q  binding.  These  mutations  also 
eliminate  the  potential  for  antibody-dependent  cell  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  and  complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC). 
The  applicant  seeks  marketing  authorisation  for  the  use  of  anifrolumab  as  an  add  on  therapy  for  the 
treatment  of  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  systemic  lupus  erythematosus,  despite  standard 
therapy. 
The proposed posology for anifrolumab is 300 mg administered as an IV infusion at 4-week intervals 
(Q4W). 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  finished  product  (FP)  is  presented  as  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  containing  300  mg  of 
anifrolumab as active substance (AS).  
Other  ingredients  are  histidine/  histidine  hydrochloride  monohydrate,  lysine  hydrochloride,  trehalose 
dihydrate, polysorbate 80 (PS-80), and water for injections. The product is available in a clear type I 
glass  vial  with  an  elastomeric  stopper  and  a  grey  flip-off  aluminium  seal.  Each  vial  of  2.0 mL  of 
concentrate contains 300 mg of anifrolumab (150 mg/mL). 
2.3.2.  Active  substance 
2.3.2.1.  General information 
The AS, anifrolumab (INN), is a human immunoglobulin GI kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
directed against subunit 1 of the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR1).  
The molecular mass of anifrolumab is approximately 148 kDa, including oligosaccharides. The antibody 
is composed of two identical heavy chains of 49 kDa each, and two identical light chains of 23 kDa each.  
Anifrolumab inhibits the binding of type I interferon to IFNAR1 blocking the biologic activity of type I 
interferons (IFNs). The potency of anifrolumab is determined using a cell-based bioassay that measures 
the ability of anifrolumab to inhibit IFN-α induced signalling resulting from the binding of anifrolumab to 
IFNAR1. 
The constant domain of the IgG heavy chain was intentionally modified (three amino acid changes) to 
eliminate  Fc  gamma  receptor  I/IIA/IIB/IIIA  (FcγRI,  FcγRIIA  and  FcγRIIB,  FcγRIIIA)  and  C1q  binding. 
These  mutations  also  eliminate  the  potential  for  antibody-dependent  cell  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  and 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).

2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Anifrolumab AS is manufactured and released by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Frederick 
Manufacturing Center, USA. Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance has been documented for 
all sites involved.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The anifrolumab AS manufacturing process consists of thawing of a working cell bank (WCB) vial and 
ending  to  storage.  The  process  involves  a  serial  cell  culture  expansion  in  seed  bioreactors  and  a 
production  bioreactor,  harvest  of  the  cell  culture  fluid  followed  by  chromatographic  purification,  virus 
inactivation and reduction (by low pH and filtration), concentration and diafiltration, formulation, bulk 
filtration and controlled freeze. The AS is stored at -45°C to -35°C, and thawed (short term storage at 
2-8°C) before shipping to the FP manufacturing site. Each production bioreactor lot leads to one AS lot. 
There is no pooling of harvests or purification process intermediates from different production bioreactor 
lots. 
The manufacturing process has been clearly outlined in flow diagrams and a detailed summary of each 
processing  and  reprocessing  step,  including  the  process  parameters,  in-process  controls  (IPCs)  and 
performance  attributes  are  described  for  each  step.  The  AS  manufacturing  process  is  considered 
acceptable.  
Control of materials 
Raw materials used in the manufacturing process for master cell bank (MCB), working cell banks (WCBs), 
and AS including excipients are presented. Many of the raw materials used in the manufacture are of 
compendial quality. In-house specifications for non-compendial raw materials have been presented. No 
material of human origin was used in host cell culture, cell line development, banking of the MCB and 
WCBs, or in AS manufacturing. Materials of animal origin used in cell line development, and materials of 
animal and other (non-animal) biological origins used in cell banking and AS manufacturing process are 
thoroughly  described  (see  adventitious  agents  section).  Transmissible  spongiform  encephalopathies 
(TSE)/bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSE) risk assessment and available certificates for relevant 
animal-derived materials are discussed. 
The  steps  involved  in  the  isolation  of  anifrolumab  from  the  hybridoma  panel,  anifrolumab  expression 
plasmid (pMI393), host cell line, production cell line and preparation of the research cell bank have been 
adequately described.  
The host cell line is well-characterised with a long history of safe and successful use in the manufacture 
of medical products. 
A two-tiered cell bank system is used and the guidelines ICH Q5A for viral safety and ICH Q5B and ICH 
Q5D for expression construct in cell line and characterisation of cell substrates are followed. A MCB, two 
WCBs, two end of production cell bank (EOPCBs) and a limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) cell bank have 
been generated.  
The  cell  banks  were  tested  for  identity,  safety,  purity,  and  cell  substrate  stability.  Tests  for  identity, 
safety,  and  purity  include  sterility,  mycoplasma,  adventitious  and  endogenous  virus,  and  species 
identification. In addition, the MCB, EOPCB, and LIVCA banks are tested for infectious retroviruses. The 
tests,  specifications,  and  results  are  presented.  Appropriateness  of  cell  line  for  production  was 
established by studying the phenotypic stability in a qualified scale-down production bioreactor model

and analysing the genetic stability of the cell line. The cell banking system and its characterisation and 
testing are adequately presented. 
Future WCBs will be manufactured following the same process as the existing WCBs.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Comprehensive  control  strategy  for  anifrolumab  AS  manufacture  is  in  place.  A  systematic  risk 
assessment  is  presented  using  a  Failure  mode  and  effects  analysis  (FMEA)  approach  to  determine 
residual risk to the patients after accounting for all process and testing controls. Overall, the presented 
process  parameters  and  outputs  are  appropriate.  The  applicant  has  presented  acceptable  ranges  for 
critical  process  parameters  (CPPs)  and  IPCs  and  action  limits  for  microbial  controls  and  performance 
attributes.  
Hold times for anifrolumab process intermediates have been validated through a combination of a 
small-scale study of biochemical hold stability, and commercial scale studies demonstrating effective 
microbial control during the hold times.  
Process validation 
The  commercial  manufacturing  process  for  anifrolumab  AS  has  been  validated  at  the  commercial 
production scale. The validation covered all cell culture and purification steps. 
Process parameters (PP) selected for monitoring in the validation studies included CPPs and key process 
parameters  (KPPs)  and  process  outputs  (IPCs,  Microbial  Controls  (MCs)  and  Performance  attributes 
(PAs)). Validation was performed on consecutive process validation batches at the commercial scale.  
Process  validation  study  results  met  the  pre-approved  validation  criteria,  demonstrating  that  the  AS 
manufacturing process is robust, adequately controlled, and consistent with regard to product quality, 
yield and impurity clearance. 
In addition to the validation of the manufacturing process steps at the commercial scale, validation 
studies were conducted at small scale and commercial scale to address a number of other 
manufacturing considerations. Process intermediate hold times, resin sanitisation and storage, resin 
lifetime, filtration membrane lifetime, filter validation studies, AS shipping and reprocessing are 
appropriately validated.  
Manufacturing process development 
Different manufacturing processes have been described. Process 1 and Process 2 batches were used in 
non-clinical and clinical studies. The most relevant clinical studies are made using batches from Process 
2.  
The manufacturing site of anifrolumab AS was changed to Frederick Manufacturing Center for commercial 
manufacturing. Viral clearance in all process versions has been demonstrated to be acceptable. 
A comparability study was performed to demonstrate that the Process 3 material, manufactured during 
the process validation campaign, is comparable to the product administered in clinical trials Prior to the 
comparability assessment of Process 3 and Process 1/2, two comparability studies were performed, to 
demonstrate  that  Process  2  material  is  comparable  to  Process  1  material  and  Process  3  material  is 
comparable to Process 2 material.  
As  a  conclusion,  the  three  processes  can  be  considered  comparable  and  Process  3  data  support  an 
improvement of the manufacturing process as compared with Processes 1 and 2.

Characterisation 
The  characterisation  on  anifrolumab  involved  primary  structure,  higher  order  structure,  carbohydrate 
structure, charge and size heterogeneity, and biological properties.  
Impurities 
Product-related  impurities  have  been  well  characterised  and  studied.    Subset  of  the  impurities  are 
controlled using AS and FP specifications while other impurities are well controlled by the manufacturing 
process to levels that adequately address risk to patients without the need for control by routine testing.  
Process-related  impurities  include  biologically  derived  macromolecules,  hydrolysates,  small  molecules 
and  synthetic  macromolecules.  Impurities  that  are  considered  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs)are 
monitored  and  controlled  through  AS  release  specification.  Based  on  the  control  strategy  risk 
assessment, it was determined that routine testing of other impurities would not be required.  
2.3.2.3.  Specification 
The  specifications  for  anifrolumab  AS  include  general  tests,  identity,  quantity,  purity  and  impurities, 
biological  activity  and  safety  tests  are  controlled  only  at  AS  release.  Tests  for  visible  and  sub-visible 
particles, extractable volume, sterility and container closure identity are tested only for the FP. 
All test parameters proposed to be included in the anifrolumab AS specification have been discussed and 
justification has been provided for each parameter. Overall, the test parameters proposed to be included 
in the anifrolumab specification are considered appropriate and in line with relevant guidance. 
Upon request some specifications have been tightened or further justified by the clinically qualified 
range and the expected change over the shelf life. 
Analytical methods 
Anifrolumab  is  tested  using  a  combination  of  compendial  and  non-compendial  analytical  tests. 
Compendial methods Appearance-Clarity (Ph. Eur.  2.2.1), Appearance-Color (Ph. Eur. 2.2.2), pH (Ph. 
Eur. 2.2.3), and Osmolality (Ph. Eur. 2.2.35) were verified according to the corresponding compendial 
procedure. Compendial tests for endotoxin and bioburden are specific to anifrolumab and were verified 
to be suitable for microbial control of anifrolumab. 
The non-compendial analytical methods have been validated according to ICH Q2 (R1). Full validation 
reports and validation summaries have been provided for all methods.  
Batch analysis 
Batch data has been provided for Process 1 batches, Process 2 batches and commercial scale Process 3 
batches. The process, concentration and, manufacturing scale of the batches are presented. The results 
obtained from all the batches met their acceptance criteria. As a whole, the provided data confirms the 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  the  AS  across  the  manufacturing  processes  and  they  sufficiently 
demonstrate that the AS manufacturing process is under control.  
Reference materials 
Two-tiered  reference  standard  system  has  been  introduced  for  anifrolumab,  involving  primary  and 
working reference standards. 
The Primary Reference Standard (PRS), is used for routine AS and FP lot release and stability testing. 
The  historical  reference  standards  are  adequately  summarised  in  the  dossier.  The  stability  of  the 
reference  standard  is  also  evaluated,  in  order  to  monitor  every  shift  in  performance.  The  current 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 19/198 
 
 
 
reference standard is tested annually per protocol, trended quarterly, and the CoA is extended annually 
according to the stability/trending results. 
Set of tests and acceptance criteria used for qualification of future reference standards are adequately 
described. The applicant states that a working reference standard (WRS), prepared in the same manner 
as the PRS, will be introduced for use in routine testing and sufficient portion of the PRS will be reserved 
for use as a Reference Standard to qualify future WRS and PRS. This ensures a link between current and 
future standards, as they are qualified against the existing primary standard.  
Container closure 
Details of the primary container closure system for anifrolumab AS and acceptable fill volume range has 
been  provided.  Protection  from  microbial  ingress  and  evaluation  of  performance  have  been 
demonstrated.  Extractables  and  leachables  studies  have  been  performed.  Overall,  appropriate 
description of the AS container closure system and its suitability for intended use has been provided. 
2.3.2.4.  Stability 
The applicant has provided stability data at long term (-45°C to -35°C), short term (2-8°C: used post-
thaw), accelerated (23-27°C /55-65% RH) and stress (38-42°C /70-80% RH) conditions as well as from 
multiple freeze-thaw cycles (3X) on the AS. The accelerated and stress stability studies are considered 
complete  and  well  performed.  Overall,  the  stability  studies  presented  are  largely  compliant  with  the 
relevant guidelines. The number of batches under analysis is sufficient, the protocols are described, and 
the selected tests are adequate to monitor possible changes in the quality of the product.  
The proposed shelf life for the anifrolumab AS is 60 months at the long-term storage condition of 45°C 
to -35°C, and 11 months at the short-term storage condition of 2-8°C (post thaw). This shelf-life can be 
considered acceptable as  sufficient amount of real-time, real-condition stability data for the proposed 
shelf-life has been provided. Stability tests and testing intervals are mostly performed according to ICH 
Q5C and include adequate, stability indicating methods.  
The provided data support the claimed shelf life and the proposed AS shelf life is agreed.  
The  post-approval  stability  protocol  and  stability  commitment  to  continue  stability  studies  of  the  AS 
through their scheduled duration of 60 months has been provided and are considered acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.3.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The anifrolumab finished product is a sterile, preservative-free, concentrate for solution for infusion. It 
is supplied as a single-dose vial in one presentation: 300 mg of anifrolumab per vial with a 2.0 mL label-
claim volume.  
The FP contains 150 mg/mL anifrolumab in L-histidine/ L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, L-lysine 
hydrochloride, α,α-trehalose dihydrate, polysorbate 80, at pH 5.9. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.  
The FP is aseptically filled into type I glass vials and closed with an elastomeric stopper. The stoppered 
FP vial is then capped with an aluminum seal. The target filling volume provides an overfill which enables 
the labelled dose of 300 mg to be extracted from each vial. The primary packaging material complies 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 20/198 
 
 
 
with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Pharmaceutical development 
Formulation development 
Based on the route of administration and dosing requirements, the anifrolumab FP formulation has been 
developed to stabilise the FP and to maintain FP quality for at least 36 months at 2-8°C. The formulation 
development of anifrolumab FP has been adequately described. The robustness of the formulation has 
been  established  via  a  multivariate  formulation  study.  Rationale  for  the  selection  of  excipients  and 
concentrations  used  are  provided.  The  applicant  has  confirmed  the  stability  and  robustness  of  the 
selected formulation. 
Manufacturing process development 
Process  characterisation  studies  have  been  performed  to  investigate  process  parameter  impact  on 
product  quality,  to  understand  the  risk  and  criticality  of  process  parameters,  and  to  define  proven 
acceptable ranges. A process failure mode and effects analysis (pFMEA) was employed to facilitate overall 
process risk management for the FP manufacturing process. Detailed description of the development of 
the anifrolumab FP manufacturing process is provided. CPPs were identified based on results from the 
process characterisation studies.  
Processing  time  limits  have  been  characterised  for  AS  thaw,  temperature  equilibration,  mixing,  in-
process hold, and total wetted filter time.  
Several  changes  to  the  anifrolumab  FP  manufacturing  process  were  implemented  during  the 
manufacturing process development.  
Different manufacturing processes are described for anifrolumab FP. Process 1 material has been used 
in  non-clinical  studies  and  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  clinical  studies.  Process  2  material  has  been  used  in 
Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical studies. Process 3 material has been used for process validation 
and stability studies, and in a Phase 3 clinical extension study. Comparability of Process 3 and Processes 
1  and  2  was  addressed.  Based  on the provided  results,  the  manufacturing  process  changes have  not 
impacted the quality or biological activity of anifrolumab. The manufacturing processes are considered 
comparable. 
Container closure 
The suitability of the primary packaging components has been demonstrated in terms of protection of 
the  FP  from  environmental  exposure,  safety,  compatibility  with  the  FP,  and  performance.  Elemental 
impurities testing is ongoing and data presented so far support the conclusion that there is no risk of 
inclusion of elemental impurities approaching the control limits as described in ICH Q3D. 
Microbiological attributes 
The microbiological quality and sterility of anifrolumab FP is ensured by pre-filtration bioburden level, 
sterile filtration and aseptic fill-finish process, use of depyrogenated and sterilised vials and stoppers, 
use  of  a  validated  capping  and  crimping  process,  and  controlled  by  release  testing  for  sterility  and 
endotoxins, and container closure integrity testing during stability testing. The sterilising filter is tested 
for integrity as part of the manufacturing process. In addition, rabbit pyrogen testing was performed to 
demonstrate the FP is not pyrogenic.

Compatibility 
Compatibility  of  diluted  anifrolumab  with  polyvinyl  chloride  or  polyolefin  infusion  bags  and  polyvinyl 
chloride administration set with polyether sulfone in-line filter has been demonstrated under worst-case 
conditions  expected  during  infusions.  The  compatibility  studies  support  the  instructions  for  use  and 
handling described in the SmPC section 6.3. 
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Anifrolumab FP is released by AstraZeneca AB, Sweden. Adequate evidence of compliance with GMP 
has been provided.  
Manufacturing process 
The manufacturing process starts with the thawing of the AS at the AS manufacturing facility, followed 
by  shipping  of  the  thawed  AS  to  the  FP  fill  facility,  and  storage  at  2-8°C  prior  to  processing.  The 
processing  involves  temperature  equilibration,  pooling  and  mixing  of  the  AS,  bioburden  reduction 
filtration and in-process hold, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, stoppering and capping, visual inspection, 
bulk packing, shipping to secondary packaging and labelling or storage site, and ends with storage of FP 
vials  at  2-8ºC.  The  manufacturing  process  is  adequately  described.  Storage  of  the  filled  FP  and  the 
storage of the labelled and packed FP are overseen by the applicant’s Quality Unit at approved sites.   
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Control of critical FP manufacturing process steps is described through critical process parameters, in-
process controls and in-process hold time. Control criteria and outcomes have been presented for each 
process control type. Ranges of the process parameters have been established during the manufacturing 
process development. Summary of in-process controls and criteria is provided. Process validation results 
verify that the proposed limits ensure that the manufacturing process is capable of consistently producing 
a FP product meeting the proposed release acceptance criteria. Descriptions of the analytical procedures 
used for in-process testing are provided. 
Manufacturing process validation  
Process  validation  data  included  process  parameters,  in-process  controls  and  release  specification 
testing. All process validation results were within the specifications and acceptance limits demonstrating 
that the  manufacturing process  is  robust  and that  the  in-process  controls  are  suitable to  monitor  the

impurities has been conducted in line with ICH Q3D, and the levels of metal impurities have been found 
to be below 30% control threshold of the permitted daily exposure (PDE) limits.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control 
measures are deemed necessary. 
2.3.3.3.  Product specification  
As  the  formulations  of  anifrolumab  AS  and  FP  are  identical,  many  of  the  tests  and  most  of  their 
acceptance criteria are identical for anifrolumab AS and FP. FP-specific specifications were set for visible 
and  sub-visible  particles,  extractable  volume,  sterility,  identity  by  lateral  flow  assay,  and  container 
closure  integrity.  Overall,  the  specifications  are  in  line  with  ICH  Q6B  and  Ph.  Eur.  2031  monoclonal 
antibodies  for  human  use.  The  acceptance  criteria  have  been  established.  Upon  request  some 
specifications have been tightened or further justified by the clinically qualified range and the expected 
change over the shelf life. 
Analytical methods 
The methods used for FP testing are either compendial test methods (appearance - clarity, appearance 
- color, endotoxin, osmolality, pH, sub-visible particles, visible particles, extractable volume, sterility) or 
in-house test methods. The methods are sufficiently described or an appropriate normative reference is 
reported.  
Regarding  the  analytical methods  specific  for  FP,  all  compendial  methods  following  the  Ph.  Eur.  have 
been verified, and in-house methods have been appropriately validated. For analytical methods common 
for FP and AS, please refer to the AS specification section. 
Batch analysis 
Batch  analysis  data  are presented,  including  process  validation  batches,  and  batches  used  for  clinical 
trials and stability. All batches met the acceptance criteria in place at the time of release and data are 
comparable  between  batches.  The  batch  analysis  results  confirm  consistency  and  uniformity  of  the 
product and indicate that the process is under control. FP batches have not been used in non-clinical 
studies.

2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 36 months when stored at 2-8°C is claimed for the finished product. 
Overall,  the  stability  studies  for  the  anifrolumab  FP  are  performed  largely  in  accordance  with  ICH 
guidance. Data on stability studies performed at the long-term (2-8°C), accelerated (23-27°C), and at 
stressed  storage  conditions  (38-42°C),  as  well  as  data  for  photostability  and  elemental  impurities 
studies, are provided.  
The provided data show that FP retains the physical, chemical and biological attributes at the long-term 
storage condition up to the indicated time-points. The claimed 36 months shelf-life is supported by the 
provided data. Statistical analysis of the FP stability data has been provided. Cumulative storage of up 
to 48 months at 2-8 °C has been accounted for in the specification calculations. The applicant confirms 
that the containers used in the stability studies are the same as those proposed for routine storage. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf life of 36 months at the long-term storage condition of 2-8°C, 
is acceptable. 
In-use stability results, performed as part of the compatibility studies, support the maximum intended 
hold times of 4h at 25ºC and 24h at 2-8ºC. 
2.3.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Anifrolumab is produced in cells using animal protein free medium and nutrient feeds. Cell banks and 
unprocessed  bulk  samples  have  been  appropriately  tested.  The  testing  has  covered  sterility, 
mycoplasma,  bacteriostasis,  fungistasis,  bovine-  and  porcine  adventitious  agents,  mouse  antibody 
production,  minute virus of  mice  (MVM)  assay,  adventitious  viruses,  infectious  retroviruses  (co-
cultivation  and  plaque  assays)  and  transmission  electron  microscopy (TEM)  with  characterisation  of 
retrovirus-like particles (Type A and C particles detected). Both in vitro (indicator cell lines) and in vivo 
(suckling  and  adult  mice,  guinea  pigs,  and  embryonated  hen  egg)  testing  have  been  performed. 
Analytical reports of cell bank testing are provided in the dossier. 
Testing of adventitious and endogenous viruses showed no contamination.  
Viral clearance studies have been conducted in accordance with the guidance given in ICH Q5A. Sufficient 
numbers  of  manufacturing  process  steps  have  been  assessed  for  clearance  of  viruses  using  verified 
scale-down models operating under worst-case conditions. Dedicated virus removal steps include low pH 
incubation and virus filtration. Samples of the clearance steps were measured using quantitative PCR 
(qPCR) or plaque assays using indicator cell lines to determine the number of infectious particles in the 
samples. A log10 reduction values were determined for each step and virus.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The manufacturing process, elucidation of structure and specifications for anifrolumab AS and FP have 
been appropriately presented. In response to the major objection, the applicant has performed a risk 
evaluation  concerning  the  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  and  found  the  risk  of  nitrosation  or  the 
presence of nitrosating reagents during the anifrolumab AS or FP manufacturing to be low.

2.3.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  nonclinical  development  of  anifrolumab  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  Guidelines,  in 
particular ICH S6 (R1), and included the evaluation of its mechanism of action and its suppression of 
type  I  IFN  induced  signalling,  gene  expression  and  cellular  responses,  and  the  pharmacokinetics  and 
toxicological profiles. Eleven nonclinical pharmacology studies including 2 nonclinical in vivo studies with 
a surrogate anti-IFNAR1 MAb were conducted to characterize the biochemical and functional properties 
of  anifrolumab  and  to  support  the  proof  of  concept  of  inhibition  of  type  I  IFNs  in  SLE.  The  PK  of 
anifrolumab  was  characterised  in  all  6  nonclinical  toxicity  studies.  The  nonclinical  safety  profile  of 
anifrolumab was characterised in single IV dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, in repeat dose 
toxicity  studies  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  for  up  to  39-weeks  of  duration,    in  a  pre-  and  post-natal 
development study in cynomolgus monkeys, as well as in tissue cross-reactivity studies using healthy 
human  and  cynomolgus  monkey  tissues.  Parameters  for  local  tolerance,  safety  pharmacology, 
immunotoxicology, and indirect assessments of male and female fertility were included in the single and 
repeat dose toxicology studies and pre- and post-natal development study. 
The code name of anifrolumab used in this application is MEDI-546. 
The nonclinical development of anifrolumab can be considered to be in line with the recommendations 
given in the scientific advice. The potential secondary effects due to blockade of interferon signalling are 
being addressed by the available non-clinical and clinical data as well as carcinogenicity risk assessment. 
All pivotal nonclinical safety studies were conducted in an Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development  (OECD)  member  country  in  accordance  with  OECD  GLP  guidance.  Study  7140-123  and 
Study 7140-142 were non-pivotal toxicology studies that were not performed to GLP. 
The  deviations  and  amendments  were  adequately  described  together  with  an  impact  assessment.  In 
some studies, certain analyses were performed under non-GLP conditions but this is not considered to 
affect the integrity of the data.

2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A series of in vitro and in vivo primary pharmacodynamics studies were performed with anifrolumab to 
determine binding affinity to human and cynomolgus monkey IFNAR1, mechanism of action, inhibition 
of  type  I  IFN  induced  gene  signature,  suppression  of  downstream  effects  such  as  plasma  cell  and 
monocyte  differentiation,  and  production  of  proinflammatory  cytokines  and  chemokines,  as  well  as 
binding to FcγRs and FcRn and antibody-mediated cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity  (CDC)  activities.  In  addition,  a  murine  surrogate  anti-IFNAR  antibody  (5A3)  was  used  to 
investigate pharmacodynamic activities in a murine disease models of lupus. 
The  structure  of  anifrolumab  is  modified  by  introducing  mutations  in  three  amino-acid  residues,  234, 
235 and 331 in the Fc region to prevent FcγRI and FcγRIIIA binding and the Fc-related effector functions, 
ADCC  and  CDC.  Using  two  methods,  an  ELISA  and  surface  plasmon  resonance,  it  was  shown  that 
consistent with the anticipated effect of the modifications in the Fc region, anifrolumab binding to rFcγRI 
and rFcγRIIIA was either absent or significantly reduced. However, in an ADCC assay, anifrolumab had 
similar ADCC activity of 14-20% target cell lysis as the parental antibody 9D4-Wt. Thus, there remains 
an uncertainty if anifrolumab still has ADCC activity to the same level as the parental antibody 9D4. In 
another set of experiments, anifrolumab reduced the binding to FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa-158F 
by 80%, 90%, 64% and 84%, respectively as compared to the parental antibody 9D4 bearing the wild-
type  Fc  region.  Anifrolumab  did  not  exhibit  detectable  ADCC  activity  in  freshly  isolated  B  cells  from 
healthy donors as compared to the positive control rituximab. Also, anifrolumab did not exhibit detectable 
CDC activity in Daudi B-cell line compared to rituximab. Despite the minimal binding of anifrolumab to 
rFcγRI and rFcγRIIIA the likelihood of having clinically relevant effector functions such ADCC, CDC or 
phagocytosis, seems low but is not excluded. 
The  KD  of  human  FcRn  to  anifrolumab  and  the  parental  antibody  9D4  were  determined  by  surface 
plasmon resonance. The KD for FcRn were calculated as 2.37 μM for 9D4, and 2.63 μM for anifrolumab. 
These data indicate that the triple mutation in the Fc region has no impact on FcRn binding, and hence, 
the normal endosomal retention and long half-life of the immunoglobulin molecule are retained. 
Anifrolumab binding affinity to IFNAR1 was determined to be similar on human and cynomolgus monkey 
PBMCs. The average KD of anifrolumab on human PBMCs was 0.29 ± 0.29 nM, with 1448 ± 1183 IFNAR1 
sites  detected,  and  on  cynomolgus  monkey  PBMCs  0.65  ±  0.74  nM,  with  648  ±  353  IFNAR1  sites 
detected. 
The mode of action for anifrolumab was demonstrated, i.e. binding of anifrolumab to its target molecule 
IFNAR1 on Daudi B cell surfaces competitively inhibited binding of the natural IFNAR1 ligand IFN-α2a. 
Rapid internalisation and inactivation of IFNAR1 was shown in monocytes following anifrolumab binding. 
This results in reduction of IFNAR1 receptor on the cell surface and inhibition of downstream signalling. 
Binding of anifrolumab to IFNAR1 on human monocytes prevents downstream signalling by completely 
inhibiting  STAT1  pTY701  phosphorylation  in  cells  stimulated  with  up  to  1,000  U  of  IFN-α2  or  pDC 
supernatants. 
The capacity of anifrolumab to inhibit type I IFN induced activation of ISRE was evaluated using human 
ISRE-luciferase reporter bioassays. Anifrolumab dose-dependently inhibited the ISRE-luciferase activity 
induced  by  recombinant  human  IFN-α2,  and  type  I  IFN  induced  by  CpG-A  or  DNA-IC  stimulation  of 
human pDC. The anifrolumab IC50s for IFN-α2 for 100, 1,000, 10,000 and 100,000 U were 0.149, 0.528, 
3.048 and 9.748 nM, respectively. The anifrolumab IC50s for CpG-A stimulated pDC media at dilutions 
of 1/1000, 1/100 and 1/10 were 0.021, 0.075, and 0.721 nM, respectively. The anifrolumab IC50s for 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 26/198 
 
 
 
DNA-IC stimulated pDC media at dilutions of 1/1000, 1/100 and 1/10 were 0.060, 0.113 and 0.214 nM, 
respectively. 
The  capacity  of  anifrolumab  to  inhibit  the  different  type  I  IFNs  was  evaluated.  Anifrolumab  potently 
inhibited all fourteen type I IFNs tested (IFN-α1, -α2, -α4, -α5, -α6, -α7, -α8, -α10¸-α14, -α16, -α17, -
α21,  IFN-B1,  and  IFN-ώ)  with  IC50s  ranging  from  0.004  to  0.3  nM.  Anifrolumab  also  significantly 
inhibited ISRE signalling induced by endogenous type I IFNs in SLE patients’ serum by 96% (p < 0.0001). 
It  was  shown  that  the  likelihood  of  having  agonistic  activity  on  IFNAR1  target  molecule  is  low  as 
anifrolumab did not induce luciferase activity above the negative control level in 293H ISRE-luciferase 
transfected cells. 
The species-cross-reactivity was addressed in support of the selection of a relevant species for toxicity 
evaluation. Cynomolgus monkey type I IFNs exhibit high amino-acid sequence identity (81 to 95%) with 
the  corresponding  human  type  I  IFNs.  Unlike  the  mouse,  cynomolgus  monkey  IFNAR1  exhibits  high 
amino-acid  sequence  identity  (90.8%)  with  the  human  IFNAR1.  Similarly,  the  African  green  monkey 
IFNAR1 also exhibits high amino acid homology to both human and cynomolgus monkey IFNAR1. The 
critical  binding  epitope  for  anifrolumab  in  the  IFNAR1  target  sequence  was  identified  within  the 
subdomain  3.  The  amino  acid  sequences  of  the  binding  epitope  are  conserved  between  human, 
cynomolgus monkeys and African green monkeys whereas the murine and rabbit sequences exhibited 
low sequence homology in this region. 
The  capacity  of  anifrolumab  to  inhibit  recombinant  murine  and  cynomolgus  monkey  type  I  IFN  was 
assessed using ISRE-luciferase reporter assays. Anifrolumab failed to inhibit ISRE activation induced by 
murine  recombinant  IFN-α.  This  was  confirmed  with  the  epitope  mapping  data  demonstrating  that 
replacing the human IFNAR1 sub-domain 3 with that from mouse prevented anifrolumab binding. 
In contrast, it was shown that anifrolumab potently inhibited cynomolgus monkey recombinant IFN-α8, 
IFN-α16, IFN-α21, IFN-β and IFN-ω induced ISRE-luciferase activity in a non-human primate COS7 cell 
line transiently transfected with ISRE-luciferase. The capacity of anifrolumab to potently inhibit multiple 
cynomolgus type I IFNs induced ISRE activity was similar to that for recombinant human type I IFNs. 
Cynomolgus  monkey  was  selected  as  the  pharmacologically  relevant  toxicology  model  for  nonclinical 
safety assessment based on binding and neutralisation activity of anifrolumab in monkey cells. 
The ability of anifrolumab to suppress the expression of a validated type I IFN gene signature based on 
the expression of 21 genes was demonstrated in CpG-A stimulated human PBMCs. Anifrolumab dose-
dependently suppressed the CpG-A–induced interferon gene by an average of 86% compared with no 
antibody treatment. 
The impact of anifrolumab on type I IFN induced monocyte activation, was evaluated by examining the 
upregulation  of  differentiation  markers  CD38  and  CD123,  and  the  production  of  IL-6,  MCP-1  (CCL2), 
MCP-2 (CCL8) and IP10 (CXCL10). In stimulated CD14+ monocytes anifrolumab was able to inhibit the 
CD38 upregulation by 95.5% with an IC50 of 0.045 nM, and the CD123 upregulation by 73% with an 
IC50 of 0.06 nM relative to R3-47. Leukocyte IFN stimulation of monocytes increased the production of 
IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1 and MCP-2 by a mean of 3 to 19-fold, respectively, while the induction of cytokines 
and chemokines was 100% inhibited by anifrolumab. These results demonstrated that anifrolumab could 
inhibit the autocrine amplification of type I IFN production, and in turn suppress the costimulation and 
the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and plasma cell differentiation which could contribute to 
localised  inflammation  and  tissue  injury.  However,  in  literature  many  cytokines  implied  in  the 
pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases, including SLE, could have a dual role. 
According to Michael H. Lee, et al. 2019 murine lupus cDCs overproduce IL-10 and IL-27 as the result 
of an enhancement by the increased I-IFNs that are highly active in lupus. Importantly, they showed 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 27/198 
 
 
 
that IL-10 and IL-27 levels correlate with the IFN signature in SLE patients. Indeed, they found that both 
IL27 and IL10 levels were significantly higher only in the SLE patients with a high I-IFN signature, while 
no significant difference in IL-27 and IL 10 levels was found between SLE patients and healthy controls 
who  had  similar  levels  of  IFN-stimulated  genes  suggesting  that  in  human  SLE  the  I-IFN  signature  is 
associated with higher levels of IL-27 and IL-10. A causative link between I-IFNs, IL-27, and IL-10 has 
been previously proposed in normal immune cells (Iyer SS et al, 2010; McNab FW et al, 2014).  
As reported by Meka RR et al, 2015, the mechanistic basis of the dual role of IL-27 in inflammation and 
autoimmunity is still not fully defined: IL-27 inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, 
IL-6 and IL-17, but induces the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Additionally, IL-27 it’s 
involved  in  the  pathogenesis  of  autoimmunity,  and  with  some  exceptions,  mostly  anti-inflammatory 
effects have been described in different diseases while it is increasingly recognised that Interleukin-10, 
the  prototypic  anti-inflammatory  cytokine,  has  a  paradoxical  pathogenic  activity  in  the  systemic 
autoimmune  disease  SLE.  In  conclusion  Michael  H.  Lee,  et  al.  2019  suggest  that  I-IFN  blockade,  by 
suppressing IL-27 and IL-10, may have opposite effects on lupus disease; it may block the promotion of 
autoantibodies  but  also  suppress  anti-inflammatory  mechanisms.  Therefore,  in  order  to  better 
understand  the  crucial  role  of  cytokine-mediated  immunity  in  the  pathological  process  of  SLE  the 
applicant was asked to provide a discussion regarding these evidences. An in-depth discussion based on 
literature has highlighted the importance of IL-27 and IL-10 in SLE pathogenesis. In any case, the specific 
role of these cytokines is not yet fully characterised, therefore, further studies, particularly in humans 
are needed to better understand their implications in the disease.  
Anifrolumab  blocks  type  I  IFN  induced  monocyte  differentiation  and  the  induction  of  proinflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines as evidenced by dose-dependent inhibition of the upregulation of monocyte 
differentiation  markers  CD38  and  CD123  by  95%  and  73%  relative  to  the  isotype  control  antibody, 
respectively; and complete inhibition of induction of cytokines and chemokines IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1 and 
MCP-2 in monocytes. 
The  in  vivo  proof-of-concept  was  investigated  in  a  mouse  disease  model  of  lupus,  using  a  mouse 
surrogate anti-IFNAR1 mAb. The in vivo proof-of-concept was demonstrated in the spontaneous mouse 
model of SLE that develop disease that resembles several of the features of SLE in humans. The mouse 
surrogate anti-IFNAR1 mAb suppressed the expression of interferon-induced genes CXCL10/IP-10, IFIT1, 
IFI202b, and IFI44 to the normal level in this lupus model, and prevented induction of proteinuria, a 
hallmark of lupus. It should, however, be noted that the treatment with anti-IFNAR1 antibody was started 
prior to induction of proteinuria, and thus, the potential for reversing the existing proteinuria cannot be 
deduced from the data. Nevertheless, these results provide support the therapeutic rationale of blocking 
interferon signalling in SLE. 
2.4.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No formal secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with anifrolumab. Anifrolumab was 
engineered  to  reduce  binding  to  Fc  receptors  and  complement  and  it  did  not  exhibit  detectable  Fc-
mediated CDC and ADCC activity. Also, anifrolumab does not exhibit IFNAR1 specific agonistic properties. 
2.4.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were performed with anifrolumab. In accordance with the 
ICH S6(R1) and ICH S7A guidelines, safety pharmacology endpoints were incorporated into the single 
and  repeat-dose  SC  and  IV  toxicity  toxicology  studies  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  There  were  no 
anifrolumab-related findings in assessments of the central nervous (clinical observations of behaviour), 
respiratory  (rate),  renal  (urinalysis),  and  cardiovascular  systems  (heart  rate,  electrocardiogram,  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022

blood pressure). Additionally, microscopic pathology examinations did not show any anifrolumab-related 
adverse effects for key vital organs other than the arteritis observed in the 39-week study, probably a 
consequence of species-specific immunogenicity. Additionally, in the 39-week repeat dose toxicity study, 
at the end of dosing period, an anifrolumab-related trend for decreased blood pressures in animals given 
60 mg/kg SC was observed.  
2.4.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No nonclinical in vivo pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been conducted with anifrolumab. 
The  absence  of  these  studies  is  considered  acceptable  since  it  is  not  expected  that  blockade  of 
physiological levels of type I IFN with anifrolumab will impact the activity of cytochrome P450 and lead 
to  clinically  meaningful  drug-drug  interactions  that  would  warrant  dose  adjustment.  With  respect  to 
modulation of anifrolumab metabolism by concomitant medications, pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
are  not  anticipated  because  of  minimal  involvement  of  CYP  enzymes  in  anifrolumab’s  metabolism. 
Anifrolumab is an IgG1 mAb that is eliminated by target IFNAR-mediated elimination pathway and by 
the FcRn pathway. These elimination mechanisms are not dependent on CYP enzymes. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Stand-alone  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  not  conducted.  Pharmacokinetic  properties  of  anifrolumab 
were evaluated in the single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies as well as in the pre- and postnatal 
developmental toxicity study. 
The ELISA analytical methods for quantification of anifrolumab in cynomolgus monkey serum and milk 
were  adequately  validated  or  qualified.  The  ELISA  assay  for  detecting  anti-anifrolumab  antibodies  in 
cynomolgus monkey serum was formally validated and met the acceptance criteria. However, the assay 
seems to be sensitive to drug interference at anifrolumab concentrations present in the serum samples. 
Drug  interference  hampers  reliable  detection  of  anti-anifrolumab  antibodies.  Also,  anti-anifrolumab 
antibody levels only at and above 2 µg/ml were detected in the presence of 2 μg/ml anifrolumab which 
is close to the detection limit for quantification of anifrolumab. This indicates that the assay is capable 
of  measuring  only  high  levels  of  anti-anifrolumab  antibodies  even  in  the  presence  of  very  low  drug 
concentrations  in  the  serum  samples.  The  assay  for  measuring  receptor  occupancy  is  considered 
appropriately qualified for the purpose. 
Following  single  IV  administration  of  anifrolumab  to  cynomolgus  monkeys,  the  Cmax  increased 
proportionally with dose in the 5-100 mg/kg dose range while more than dose-proportional increase in 
AUC was observed. The mean CL was 5.41, 4.11 and 2.58 mL/kg/d for the 5, 30 and 100 mg/kg doses, 
respectively. The elimination half-life t1/2 of anifrolumab was significantly longer in the 100 mg/kg group 
animals than in the 5 and 30 mg/kg dose groups. No apparent gender differences in TK was observed in 
cynomolgus monkeys. No pre-existing anti-anifrolumab antibodies were detected. After single dose of 
anifrolumab, 11/15 animals had detectable ADA responses, with the frequency inversely proportional to 
the dose level administered and increasing at later time points. ADA titers ranged from 1:40 to 1:768,000 
by the end of the study. 
Following a single SC administration of 5 mg/kg anifrolumab to cynomolgus monkeys, the median Tmax 
was  2  days  post-dose.  The  mean  systemic  exposure  (Cmax  and  AUC)  was  higher  in  the  SC  group  as 
compared to IV group at the same dose level. The mean CL/F and terminal t1/2 were 2.55 mL/kg/d and 
13.2  d  for  the  SC  dose  compared  to  4.94  mL/kg/d and  8.42  d  for  the  IV  dose,  respectively.  No  pre-
existing ADA were detected in any of the animals. Post-treatment, all animals had detectable ADA at 
Day 29 regardless of dose with the titers being similar among the two dosing routes.

Following a single IV administration, Cmax increased in direct proportion to dose in the 0.03 to 1 mg/kg 
dose range in cynomolgus monkeys. A more than dose-proportional increase in AUC was observed. The 
mean CL was 140, 25.2 and 14.4 mL/kg/d for the 0.03, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg doses, respectively. No gender 
difference in TK was observed. Anti-anifrolumab antibodies were detected in 20/24 anifrolumab dosed 
animals.  Positive  titers  in  anifrolumab  dosed  animals  ranged  from  20  to  2  621  440.  On  Day  15,  all 
animals in the 0.3 and 1 mg/kg groups tested positive for anti-anifrolumab antibodies, while 3/6 and 4/6 
tested positive in the 0.003 and 0.03 mg/kg groups respectively. 
In the 4-week repeat-dose study, Cmax increased approximately in proportion with the dose in the 0.5 - 
30  mg/kg  dose  range  following  the  first  IV  administration  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  More  than  dose 
proportional increase in Cmax and AUC(0-7d) was observed in the 5 - 30 mg/kg dose range. In Group 3 
and 4 animals, more than dose proportional increase in Cmax and AUC(0-7d) was observed. In recovery 
animals, the mean terminal (t1/2) was 5.57 and 10.1 days for the 5 and 30 mg/kg groups, respectively. 
The shorter t1/2 in the 5 mg/kg group recovery animals is likely due to the higher incidence of positive 
immunogenicity response in this group. No appreciable gender difference in drug exposure was observed. 
Following treatment, the incidence of positive immunogenicity response decreased with increasing dose. 
All animals (100%) in the 0.5 mg/kg dose group, 9/12 animals (75%) in the 5 mg/kg dose group, and 
2/12  animals  (17%)  in  the  30  mg/kg  dose  group  had  at  least  one  positive  immunogenicity  response 
detected during the study period. The TK exposure in anifrolumab treated animals inversely correlated 
with the immunogenicity status and ADA titer. 
In  the  39-week  repeat-dose  study,  following  the  first  IV  infusion  administration  of  anifrolumab  both 
AUC(0-7d)  and  Cmax  increased  in  an  approximately  dose-proportional  manner  in  the  tested  range  of  5 
mg/kg to 50 mg/kg, consistent with linear pharmacokinetics. An approximate dose proportional increase 
was also observed following the first SC administration of anifrolumab in the tested range of 15 mg/kg 
to 60 mg/kg. The Tmax for SC treated animals ranged from 2 to 7 days. 
Following  the  dose  39  of  anifrolumab  via  IV  administration,  the  mean  CL  values  at  steady  state  of 
2.55±0.569 and 2.47±0.653 mL/d/kg were estimated for animals dosed with 5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, 
respectively. Following the Dose 39 of anifrolumab via SC administration, the median time to Tmax for SC 
treated animals was 2 and 2.5 days for animals in Groups 4 and 5, respectively. The average apparent 
clearance  (CL/F)  at  steady  state  for  animals  receiving  15  mg/kg  and  60  mg/kg  was  estimated  as 
2.98±0.615 and 3.08±1.05 mL/d/kg, respectively. 
TK parameters following the last IV and SC doses (Dose 40) of anifrolumab were only calculated for the 
seronegative recovery animals. Following the last IV administration of anifrolumab, mean t1/2 values 
were estimated at 16.3 and 20.7±3.72 days following dosing with 5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg anifrolumab, 
respectively.  Following  the  last  SC  administration  of  anifrolumab,  mean  t1/2  was  15.7±2.80  and 
19.4±2.84 days following dosing with 15 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg anifrolumab. The overall bioavailability 
was 78.7%. 
Anifrolumab accumulated after repeated dosing by a factor of 3.77, 4.49, 6.12, and 5.29 in the 5mg/kg 
IV, 50 mg/kg IV, 15 mg/kg SC and 60 mg/kg SC groups, respectively. This is a likely consequence of 
saturation of the target. 
Seven of twelve control animals (58%) in the control group showed positive titers during the treatment 
period.  The  ADA  titers  in  the  control  animals  ranged  from  borderline  positive  (1:10  and  1:20)  to 
1:655,000. Eight animals (67%, 4 males and 4 females) from Group 2 (5 mg/kg, IV) and three animals 
(25%,  1  male  and  2  females)  from  Group  4  (15  mg/kg,  SC)  tested  positive  for  anti-anifrolumab 
antibodies. 
In the pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study, following single IV infusion of anifrolumab, Cmax 
and AUC(0-14d) was approximately dose-proportional in the tested range of 30 to 60 mg/kg in pregnant

adult female cynomolgus monkeys. Mean CL values of 3.14±0.460 and 2.87±0.900 mL/d/kg and the 
mean terminal t1/2 values of 12.6±2.50 and 15.5±6.14 days were estimated for adult female cynomolgus 
monkeys dosed with 30 and 60 mg/kg, respectively. Following the fifth IV infusion of anifrolumab on 
GD76,  a  dose-proportional  increase  in  Cmax  and  AUC(0-14d)  was  observed  in  the  dose  range  30  to  60 
mg/kg.  Mean  CL  value  of  3.67±0.746  and  3.59±0.811  mL/d/kg  and  the  mean  terminal  t1/2 values  of 
11.3±1.74  and  12.2±3.91  days  were  estimated  following  dosing  with  30  and  60  mg/kg  anifrolumab, 
respectively. Following the ninth IV infusion of anifrolumab on GD132, a dose-proportional increase in 
Cmax and AUC(0-14d) was observed in the dose range 30 to 60 mg/kg. Mean CL value of 3.35±0.913 and 
3.26±0.469  mL/d/kg  and  the  mean  terminal  t1/2  values  of  11.4±2.07  and  13.4±2.96  days  were 
estimated following dosing with 30 and 60 mg/kg anifrolumab, respectively. Following the last IV infusion 
of anifrolumab in the lactation period, a dose proportional increase in Cmax and AUC(0-14d) was observed 
in the dose range 30 to 60 mg/kg. Mean CL value of 3.36±0.799 and 2.94±0.461 mL/d/kg and the mean 
terminal t1/2 values of 16.2±7.21 and 17.5±5.43 days were estimated following dosing with 30 and 60 
mg/kg  anifrolumab,  respectively.  Accumulation  ratio  ranged  from  1.6  to  1.8-fold  for  30  mg/kg  dose 
group, and 1.5 to 2.0-fold for 60 mg/kg dose group following the fifth (GD76), ninth (GD132) and last 
IV infusion of anifrolumab. Steady-state was reached by the ninth dose and that exposure to anifrolumab 
was maintained in adult females over the dosing period. 
Exposure of infants to anifrolumab was demonstrated by detecting anifrolumab in the serum. Majority 
of the infants in the 30 mg/kg group (n=9) and all infants in the 60 mg/kg group (n=8) had detectable 
levels of anifrolumab in serum 30 days after birth. Infant anifrolumab concentrations were greater than 
dose  proportional  in  the  tested  range  of  30  to  60  mg/kg.  The  infant  serum  anifrolumab  levels  were 
considerably  higher  than  corresponding  adult  female  milk  levels  at  time  points  after  birth  which 
demonstrate  that  anifrolumab  is  transferred  via  the  placenta  from  maternal  circulation  into  foetal 
circulation. 
No tissue distribution and protein binding studies were conducted with anifrolumab, which is acceptable 
as it is an IgG, the distribution of anifrolumab is likely restricted to the extracellular fluid. 
No metabolism studies were conducted which was considered acceptable to the CHMP as anifrolumab is 
a monoclonal antibody and therefore its expected metabolism is degradation to small peptides and amino 
acids. No active metabolite is expected for anifrolumab. 
No specific studies to determine anifrolumab excretion were conducted which was considered acceptable 
to the CHMP as anifrolumab is a monoclonal antibody. Due to its large molecular size, anifrolumab and 
human immunoglobulins in general are not expected to be subject to renal filtration. There are two major 
elimination  pathways  of  anifrolumab,  the  intrinsic  clearance  by  the  reticuloendothelial  system  in  the 
same way as that for an endogenous IgG, and the elimination by the target antigen receptor (IFNAR1-
mediated  clearance).  Excretion  of  anifrolumab  into  milk  was  evaluated  in  the  pre-  and  post-natal 
developmental toxicity study. It was demonstrated that anifrolumab is excreted into milk. 
Nonclinical in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted with anifrolumab. Based on its mode 
of  action  the  likelihood  of  anifrolumab  impacting  on  expression  levels  of  metabolic  enzymes,  such  as 
cytochrome P450s, is considered low. However, general considerations for anifrolumab pharmacokinetic 
drug interactions are discussed in the Clinical Section. 
2.4.4.  Toxicology 
The  toxicology  programme  consists  of  non-GLP  and  GLP-compliant  single  dose  toxicity  studies,  GLP-
compliant repeat-dose toxicity studies of 4- and 39-week duration, and a GLP-compliant pre- and post-
natal  developmental  toxicity  study.  The  clinical  route  of  administration,  i.e.  intravenous  as  well  as 
subcutaneous administration route were used in both single and repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 31/198 
 
 
 
Toxicokinetics, immunogenicity, as well as safety pharmacology and local tolerance were addressed in 
the  toxicity  studies.  In  addition,  tissue-cross-reactivity  studies  with  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey 
tissue  panels  were  conducted.  A  risk  assessment  based  on  the  weight  of  evidence  was  provided  to 
address carcinogenicity. 
All in vivo toxicity studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys which can be considered as a relevant 
species for evaluation of safety of anifrolumab. Anifrolumab was pharmacologically active in cynomolgus 
monkeys, and it binds to IFNAR1 of cynomolgus monkeys and human with a similar affinity. 
2.4.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Anifrolumab was well tolerated with no adverse findings observed following a single IV administration to 
male and female cynomolgus monkeys up to 100 mg/kg. The NOAEL was 100 mg/kg, the highest dose 
tested.  However,  an  unusual  unexpected  hypersensitivity  reaction  and  presence  of  IgG,  IgE  and  IgM 
anti-drug  antibodies  in  animals  that  received  an  additional  dose  of  anifrolumab  were  observed.  The 
clinical relevance and significance of this finding is not known. Nevertheless, a similar finding was not 
observed  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  up  to  39-weeks  of  duration.  In  another  non-GLP  and  a  GLP-
compliant single dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, anifrolumab was well tolerated with no 
adverse effects observed following a single IV or SC dose of 5 mg/kg, and a single IV dose of up to 1 
mg/kg. The receptor occupancy analysis and an in vitro genomic analysis of interferon gene signature 
confirmed pharmacological activity in this dose range. 
2.4.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity of anifrolumab was evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys in 4-weeks and 39-weeks 
GLP  toxicity  studies  with an  additional  recovery  period of  7  or  12  weeks,  respectively.  In  the  4-week 
repeat dose toxicity study, anifrolumab was well tolerated after weekly intravenous dosing for 4 weeks 
at dose levels up to 30 mg/kg. A non-adverse transient anifrolumab-related increase in the occurrence 
of dry faeces was noted in animals in the 5 and 30 mg/kg dose groups during the first 9 days. Similar 
findings  were  not  noted  in  other  repeat  dose  anifrolumab  studies.  The  NOAEL  in  this  study  was  30 
mg/kg/dose, the highest dose tested, which resulted in a mean AUC(0-7d) of 11,100 μg·d/mL and a mean 
Cmax of 2,640 μg/mL. 
Anifrolumab  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  the  chronic  39-week  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in 
cynomolgus following weekly administration at dose levels up to 50mg/kg intravenously and up to 60 
mg/kg subcutaneously. Pharmacology-related findings in the lymphoid organs such as minimal increase 
in lymphoid follicle size in spleen and in some lymph nodes of dosed males and females of the high dose 
group animals at the end of the dosing and/or recovery phase. The minimal decrease in lymphocytes in 
the cortex and medulla of the thymus of dosed males was observed at the end of the dosing period. 
Decreased cortical lymphocytes persisted until the end of the recovery phase. At the end of dosing phase, 
attributed to anifrolumab, but of limited physiological importance, trend for decreased blood pressures 
in animals given 60 mg/kg SC and reversible increases in concentrations of C3 in males given 50 mg/kg 
IV  were  observed.  One  60  mg/kg  SC  male  testis  had  marked  unilateral  diffuse  seminiferous  tubular 
epithelium degeneration correlating with abnormal sperm parameters which differed markedly from all 
other  terminal  sacrifice  animals.  A  recovery  50  mg/kg  IV  male  had  mild  depletion  of  pachytene 
spermatocytes  and  spermatids  correlating  with  normal  motility  and  sperm  numbers  and  indicating 
recovery  toward  normal  spermatogenesis  from  the  lack  of  sperm,  likely  correlating  with  seminiferous 
tubular degeneration in the motility samples taken mid-way through recovery. 
Grade 1 to 3 focal arteritis characterised as intramural and perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes and 
macrophages,  without  necrosis,  giant  cells,  eosinophils,  or  granulomas  in  small-  and  medium-sized

arteries  of  several  organs  was  noted  in  5/24  males  (21%),  that  received  anifrolumab,  but  it  was  not 
evident in control males or in females regardless of treatment group (0/24, 0%). At the end of the dosing 
phase, 2 males in the 50 mg/kg IV group had anifrolumab-related arteritis in multiple organs. At the end 
of the recovery phase, 3 males had anifrolumab-related arteritis: one each given 5 mg/kg IV, 50 mg/kg 
IV, and 60 mg/kg SC. At the end of the recovery phase, arteritis was evident in more animals but was 
less pronounced and generally less widespread than in the dosing phase.  
Anti-drug  antibodies  were  detected  in  11/48  (22.9%)  animals  treated  with  anifrolumab  with  higher 
incidence  observed  in  animals  receiving  lower  doses.  Seven  of  twelve  control  animals  (58%)  showed 
positive  titers  ranging  from  borderline  positive  (1:10  and  1:20)  to  1:655,000  during  the  treatment 
period.  
In the 39-week repeat dose toxicity study, the NOAEL for females is 50 mg/kg IV (which resulted in a 
mean Cmax of 4,510 ± 1,200 μg/mL and mean AUC(0-7d) 21,600 ± 5,780 μg·d/mL) and 60 mg/kg SC 
(which resulted in a mean Cmax of 3,230 ± 1,120 μg/mL and mean AUC(0-7d) 19,500 ± 5,620 μg·d/mL). 
Based on the arterial inflammation observed, the NOAEL for males is less than 5 mg/kg IV and 15 mg/kg 
SC. If the observed arteritis is not factored into the NOAEL determination, the NOAEL of anifrolumab for 
males is at least 50 mg/kg IV and 60 mg/kg SC, the highest doses tested. 
The comparison of animal to human systemic exposures (AUC and Cmax) to allow establishing safety 
margins were provided at the CHMP’s request. The requested safety margins were calculated based on 
the NOAEL levels with arteritis finding excluded and included.  In the 39-week repeat-dose toxicity 
study, at the 50 mg/kg IV NOAEL (not taking arteritis into account), observed exposure consisted of 
AUC(0-7d) of 21600 μg·d/mL and Cmax of 4510 mg/mL. This resulted in a margin of approximately 18 
times the MRHD on an AUC at steady state basis, and 36 times the MRHD on a Cmax at steady state 
basis for type I IFN gene signature test high subjects. For type I IFN gene signature test low subjects, 
this resulted in a margin of approximately 15 times the MRHD on an AUC at steady state basis, and 33 
times the MRHD on a Cmax at steady state basis. The safety margins calculated at NOAEL levels 
including arteritis resulted in lower exposure multiples, the Cmax being 3 fold for both type I IFN high 
and low, and the AUC being 1.7 and 1.4 for both type I IFN high and low, respectively.   
2.4.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
In line with the Guideline on the preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals 
(ICH  S6  R1),  the  range  and  type  of  standard  studies  evaluating  genotoxicity  routinely  conducted  for 
pharmaceuticals are not applicable for anifrolumab. Therefore, no studies evaluating the genotoxic or 
mutagenic  potential  of  anifrolumab  have  been  conducted.  Anifrolumab  is  a  monoclonal  antibody 
composed  entirely  of  naturally  occurring  amino  acids  and  contains  no  inorganic  or  synthetic  organic 
linkers  or  other  non-protein  portions.  Anifrolumab  is  a  large  protein  molecule  that  is  not  expected  to 
cross the nuclear or mitochondrial membrane and to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal 
material inside the nucleus. Thus, it is highly unlikely that anifrolumab would react directly with DNA or 
other chromosomal material.  
2.4.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity  studies  with  anifrolumab  were  not  conducted.  Anifrolumab  does  not  bind  to  murine 
IFNAR1  and  does  not  inhibit  the  biological  activity  of  murine  IFN-α.  Therefore,  a  direct  evaluation  of 
anifrolumab  carcinogenic  risk  in  a  2-year  rodent  bioassay  was  not  performed.  Instead,  a  weight  of 
evidence approach consisting of data from chronic toxicity studies with anifrolumab and literature data 
was presented to address the risk of carcinogenicity. Type I interferons have a role in the anti-tumour 
response. Thus, it is plausible that blockade of IFNAR1 responses would potentially increase the risk of 
Assessment report

carcinogenicity. The repeat IV or SC dose non-clinical studies with anifrolumab for up to 39 weeks of 
duration showed no evidence of proliferative or pre-neoplastic effects in cynomolgus monkeys. In line 
with the recommendations in the Guideline on the preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived 
pharmaceuticals  (ICH  S6  R1),  the  potential  risk  can  be  mitigated  by  the  risk  management  practices 
without performing additional in vivo studies in animal models. 
2.4.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
A  pre-  and  post-natal  developmental  toxicity  study  was  conducted  with  anifrolumab  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys. Fertility or embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies were not conducted. 
In accordance with the ICH S6(R1) guideline, for situations in which nonhuman primates are the only 
relevant species for nonclinical safety testing, potential effects on organ weights and histopathology of 
the reproductive tract were evaluated as a surrogate endpoint for male and female fertility in a repeat-
dose  toxicity  study  in  sexually  mature  primates.  Assessment  of  indirect  female  fertility  endpoints 
[menses  cycle,  organ  weights  (pituitary  gland,  ovaries  and  uterus),  macroscopic  and  histopathology 
(pituitary  gland,  ovaries,  uterus,  cervix,  vagina,  and  mammary  gland)]  were  conducted  in  sexually 
mature cynomolgus monkeys during the 39-week repeat-dose toxicity study with weekly IV infusion (0, 
5, or 50 mg/kg) or SC injection (0, 15, or 60 mg/kg). No anifrolumab related effect on menstruation was 
evident. There were no anifrolumab related changes in organ weights or macroscopic and microscopic 
pathology. 
In  the  39-week  repeat-dose  toxicity  study,  there  were  unilateral  testicular  seminiferous  tubule 
degeneration and sperm changes noted for two anifrolumab-treated males. The associated data for the 
two males argues against these testicular findings being attributable to anifrolumab. This is consistent 
with available type I IFN literature suggesting that over-expression and not neutralisation of type I IFN 
could impair spermatogenesis.  
A  GLP-compliant  pre-  and  post-natal  development  study  was  conducted  in  cynomolgus  monkeys 
following IV administration of anifrolumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys which received every other 
week  IV  infusions  of  0,  30,  or  60  mg/kg  anifrolumab  from  GD20  through  approximately  LD28,  with 
subsequent monitoring of mothers and infants after delivery until PPD or BD for infants 180 ± 2. There 
were no anifrolumab-related adverse maternal, foetal, or infant effects. Two maternal animals in the 60 
mg/kg group were euthanised on the day of emergency caesarean section due to dystocia they were but 
there  were  considered  incidental  and  unrelated  to  anifrolumab  as  macroscopic  changes  were  not 
observed. 
High incidence of foetal loss was observed. The overall foetal loss (in utero foetal death and abortion 
before/on GD135) was 1/16 (6.3%), 5/17 (29.4%), and 3/16 (18.8%) females in the control, 30 and 60 
mg/kg/week groups, respectively. The applicant considered this not significant, as the ratio of foetal loss 
was within the historical control range of 0 - 33.3% the average incidence being 14.2 ±10.2% (mean 
±SD). The total embryo-foetal and infant loss ratios were 5/16 (31.3%), 7/17 (41.2%, and 8/16 (50%) 
for the control, and for the 30 and 60 mg/kg anifrolumab groups, respectively. The applicant argued that 
this is not relevant as it falls within the historical foetal loss ratio in the testing facility. 
There were no anifrolumab-related changes in infants in clinical observations, body weights, survival, or 
in  parameters  of  functional  and  morphological  development  including  skeletal  findings,  behavioural 
assessment,  anti-KLH  antibody  assay,  haematology,  serum  chemistry,  or  flow  cytometry  analysis 
parameters. One infant in the control group was euthanised on DB16, and 2 infants in the 60 mg/kg 
group  died  on  DB1,  but  there  were  no  test  article-related  macroscopic  changes  observed  for  these 
infants. The applicant concluded the maternal and infant NOAEL to be 60 mg/kg, the highest dose tested.

2.4.4.6.  Local Tolerance  
Local  tolerance  of  anifrolumab  was  assessed  by  clinical  (dermal  Draize  scoring),  macroscopic,  and 
histopathology  examinations  of  anifrolumab  infusion/injection  sites  during  the  single  and  repeat-dose 
toxicity studies. No anifrolumab-related adverse changes were observed at the IV infusion or SC injection 
sites. 
2.4.4.7.  Other toxicity studies 
Tissue cross-reactivity 
The tissue cross-reactivity of anifrolumab in a panel of human tissues was as expected on the known 
IFNAR1  expression.  A  wide-spread  anifrolumab-specific  staining  was  detected  in  epithelium, 
endothelium, mesothelium, mononuclear cells, and spindloid/dendritic cells throughout the human tissue 
panel. In addition, anifrolumab staining of myenteric plexi in the gastrointestinal tract, glomerular tuft 
cells in the kidney, granulosa cells in the ovary, beta cells in the pancreas, chief cells of the parathyroid, 
endocrine cells and pituicytes in the pituitary, decidual cells in the placenta, and spermatogenic cells in 
the  testis  was  observed.  The  cross-reactivity  of  anifrolumab  was  essentially  similar  in  human  and 
cynomolgus  monkey  tissues  supporting  the  cynomolgus  monkey  as  a  relevant  species  for  safety 
evaluation. 
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Anifrolumab is non-hazardous, biodegradable product. As such, the environmental risk in terms of use 
and disposal is considered to be negligible and in accordance with the guideline (CHMP 2006) ERA studies 
were  not  submitted.  The  active  substance  is  a  natural  substance,  the  use  of  which  will  not  alter  the 
concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, anifrolumab is not expected 
to pose a risk to the environment. This was acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  pharmacological  data  were  appropriate  and  sufficiently  comprehensive.  The 
studies  with  anifrolumab  determined  binding  affinity  to  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey  IFNAR1, 
mechanism of action, inhibition of type I IFN induced gene signature, suppression of downstream effects 
such  as  plasma  cell  and  monocyte  differentiation,  and  production  of  proinflammatory  cytokines  and 
chemokines, as well as binding to FcγRs and FcRn and antibody-mediated cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and 
complement-dependent  cytotoxicity  (CDC)  activities.  In  addition,  a  murine  surrogate  anti-IFNAR 
antibody (5A3) was used to investigate pharmacodynamic activities in a murine disease model of lupus. 
The  structure  of  anifrolumab  is  modified  by  introducing  mutations  in  three  amino-acid  residues,  234, 
235 and 331 in the Fc region to prevent FcγRI and FcγRIIIA binding and the Fc-related effector functions, 
ADCC and CDC. Consistent with the anticipated effect of the modifications it was shown that in the Fc 
region anifrolumab binding to rFcγRI and rFcγRIIIA was either absent or significantly reduced. However, 
the results from two sets of ADCC experiments gave slightly contradicting results. In the first experiment, 
anifrolumab had similar ADCC activity of 14-20% target cell lysis as the parental antibody 9D4-Wt. Thus, 
it  remains  uncertain  if  anifrolumab  still  has  ADCC  activity  to  the  same  level  as  the  parental  antibody 
9D4.  In  the  second  set  of  experiments,  anifrolumab  reduced  the  binding  to  FcγRI,  FcγRIIa,  FcγRIIb, 
FcγRIIIa-158F by 80%, 90%, 64% and 84%, respectively as compared to the parental antibody 9D4 
bearing the wild-type Fc region. In this study, anifrolumab did not exhibit detectable ADCC activity in 
freshly  isolated  B  cells  from  healthy  donors  as  compared  to  the  positive  control  rituximab.  Also,

anifrolumab did not exhibit detectable CDC activity in Daudi B-cell line compared to rituximab. Due to 
the minimal binding of anifrolumab to rFcγRI and rFcγRIIIA the likelihood of having clinically relevant 
effector  functions  such  ADCC,  CDC  or  phagocytosis,  seems  low  but  cannot  be  fully  excluded.  These 
results may have implications in safety as findings such as arteritis might result from cytotoxicity related 
to the effector functions of anifrolumab bound to target molecule on cell surfaces. See all discussions in 
Section 2.5.9.  
The triple mutation in the Fc region has no impact on FcRn binding as the KD for FcRn binding affinities 
were 2.37 μM for 9D4, and 2.63 μM for anifrolumab. Hence, the normal endosomal retention and long 
half-life of the immunoglobulin molecule are retained. 
The species-cross-reactivity was addressed in support of the selection of a relevant species for toxicity 
evaluation. Cynomolgus monkey type I IFNs exhibit high amino-acid sequence identity (81 to 95%) with 
the  corresponding  human  type  I  IFNs.  Unlike  the  mouse,  cynomolgus  monkey  IFNAR1  exhibits  high 
amino-acid  sequence  identity  (90.8%)  with  the  human  IFNAR1.  Similarly,  the  African  green  monkey 
IFNAR1 also exhibits high amino acid homology to both human and cynomolgus monkey IFNAR1. The 
critical  binding  epitope  for  anifrolumab  in  the  IFNAR1  target  sequence  was  identified  within  the 
subdomain  3.  The  amino  acid  sequences  of  the  binding  epitope  are  conserved  between  human, 
cynomolgus monkeys and African green monkeys whereas the murine and rabbit sequences exhibited 
low  sequence  homology  in  this  region.  Species-selectivity  was  corroborated  with  binding  affinity  and 
functional  data  showing  that  anifrolumab  binding  affinity  to  IFNAR1  was  similar  on  human  and 
cynomolgus  monkey  PBMCs.  Also,  anifrolumab  failed  to  inhibit  ISRE  activation  induced  by  murine 
recombinant IFN-α, and this was confirmed with the epitope mapping data demonstrating that replacing 
the  human  IFNAR1  sub-domain  3  with  that  from  mouse  prevented  anifrolumab  binding.  In  contrast, 
anifrolumab potently inhibited cynomolgus monkey recombinant IFN-α8, IFN-α16, IFN-α21, IFN-β and 
IFN-ω  induced  ISRE-luciferase  activity  in  a  non-human  primate  COS7  cell  line  transiently  transfected 
with  ISRE-luciferase.  The  capacity  of  anifrolumab  to  inhibit  multiple  cynomolgus  type  I  IFNs  induced 
ISRE activity was similar to that for recombinant human type I IFNs. Collectively, these data support the 
selection of cynomolgus monkey as the pharmacologically relevant toxicology model for nonclinical safety 
assessment. 
The interferon gene signature of 21 interferon-induced genes was shown to be responsive to anifrolumab 
treatment using CpG-A stimulated human PBMCs. Anifrolumab dose-dependently suppressed the CpG-
A–induced interferon gene by an average of 86% compared with no antibody treatment. 
The  disease-relevant  functional  activities  such  as  inhibition  of  the  auto-amplification  of  type  I  IFN 
production, suppression of the CD80 and CD83 co-stimulation, production of proinflammatory cytokines 
TNFα, IL-6 and IL-8, and differentiation of pDCs into plasma cells,  as well as dose-dependent inhibition 
of  the  upregulation  of  monocyte  differentiation  markers  CD38  and  CD123  and  complete  inhibition  of 
induction of cytokines and chemokines IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1 and MCP-2 in monocytes, were demonstrated 
for  anifrolumab.  Experimental  evidence  demonstrated  that  anifrolumab  could  inhibit  the  autocrine 
amplification  of  type  I  IFN  production  and  in  turn  suppress  the  co-stimulation  and  the  production  of 
proinflammatory cytokines. Data from literature indicate that many cytokines implied in the pathogenesis 
of various autoimmune diseases, including SLE, could have a dual role. As reported by Meka RR et al, 
2015, the mechanistic basis of the dual role of IL-27 in inflammation and autoimmunity is still not fully 
defined: IL-27 inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and IL-17, but induces 
the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Additionally, Michael H. Lee, et al. 2019 suggest that 
I-IFN  blockade,  by  suppressing  IL-27  and  IL-10,  may  have  opposite  effects  on  lupus  disease;  it  may 
block the promotion of autoantibodies but also suppress anti-inflammatory mechanisms. At the CHMP’s 
request an  in-depth discussion based on literature has highlighted the importance of IL-27 and IL-10 in 
SLE  pathogenesis.  In  any  case,  the  specific  role  of  these  cytokines  is  not  yet  fully  characterised,

therefore, further studies, particularly in humans are needed to better understand their implications in 
the disease.  
The  data  generated  with  a  mouse  surrogate  anti-IFNAR1  mAb  in  the  in  vivo  proof-of-concept  lupus 
disease models, supported the therapeutic rationale for blockade of type I interferon signalling in the 
treatment of SLE. 
No formal secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with anifrolumab. Anifrolumab was 
engineered to reduce binding to Fc receptors and complement and did not exhibit detectable Fc-mediated 
CDC and ADCC activity. Also, anifrolumab does not exhibit IFNAR1 specific agonistic properties. It was 
recommended in the EMA CHMP scientific advice, that secondary effects, i.e. anti-proliferative, anti-viral 
and immune-modulatory effects, due to blocking of interferon stimulated effects by anifrolumab should 
be addressed. The CHMP considered that these aspects were sufficiently covered by the available non-
clinical and clinical data as well as carcinogenicity risk assessment. Based on the weight of evidence, 
treatment  with  anifrolumab  is  likely  associated  with  an  increased  carcinogenicity  risk  that  has  been 
followed throughout the clinical development programme and addressed in the RMP (see Section 2.7), 
and thus, no further animal studies are necessary (SmPC section 5.3). The potential risk of increased 
susceptibility to viral infections was not addressed in non-clinical studies. However, an increase of herpes 
zoster and influenza virus infections has been observed in patients treated with anifrolumab and thus, 
no further non-clinical studies are considered necessary by the CHMP. Effects to the immune functions 
were included in the repeat dose toxicity study studies. 
In the 39-week repeat dose toxicity study, at the end of dosing period, an anifrolumab-related trend for 
decreased blood pressures in animals given 60 mg/kg SC was observed. The applicant considered this 
observation to be of limited physiological relevance. The CHMP agreed as significant changes in blood 
pressure were not detected in patients who received anifrolumab. 
The pharmacokinetics of anifrolumab after single and repeated doses was evaluated as part of the single 
and repeat-dose toxicity studies. These data are considered appropriate and sufficient to characterize 
the  PK  profile  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Anifrolumab  appeared  to  be  immunogenic  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys. The accuracy and predictivity of the PK data was not hampered by the fact that frequent ADAs 
were detected on the animals of the control group.  
Anifrolumab was generally well tolerated in cynomolgus after single and repeated dosing for up to 39 
weeks  of  duration  at  dose  levels  up  to  50mg/kg  intravenously  and  up  to  60  mg/kg  subcutaneously. 
Pharmacology-related findings in the lymphoid organs such as minimal increase in lymphoid follicle size 
in spleen and in some lymph nodes of dosed males and females of the high dose group animals at the 
end of the dosing and/or recovery phase. The minimal decrease in lymphocytes in the cortex and medulla 
of  the  thymus  of  dosed  males  was  observed  at  the  end  of  the  dosing  period.  Decreased  cortical 
lymphocytes persisted until the end of the recovery phase. 
Grade 1 to 3 focal arteritis was observed in several organs in 5/24 males (21%) that received anifrolumab 
while none of the control males or females regardless of treatment group were affected (0/24, 0%). At 
the end of the dosing phase, 2 males given 50 mg/kg IV had anifrolumab-related arteritis in multiple 
organs. The applicant argues that the observed arteritis is a result of a species-specific, chronic immune-
mediated reaction due to immunogenicity and associated with immune-complex deposition. According 
to the applicant, vasculitis background incidence of 6% has been noted in the literature for this species 
(Chamanza  et  al,  2006),  and  the  Testing  Facility  had  a  historical  incidence  of  2/167  (1.2%)  for  a 
diagnosis of “inflammation, vascular” in studies of ≥ 26 weeks in duration. The applicant provided further 
consideration to various aspects, such as effector functions related to the Fc-region, antagonistic and 
agonistic effects, lack of arteritis in IFNAR-deficient mice or in long-term toxicity study with a related 
IFN-α antibody sifalimumab, and the level of aggregates in the drug product, that could contribute to 
arteritis. At the CHMP’s request, the applicant provided further information on the relationship between

incidence of ADAs and arteritis in cynomolgus monkeys and discussed the potential for clinically relevant 
effector functions. The CHMP concluded that the potential for drug-related arteritis cannot be completely 
excluded but is low (see also Section 2.5.9). 
There  was  a  finding  of  seminiferous  tubular  epithelium  degeneration  and  marked  changes  in  sperm 
parameters  in  males  which  received  60  mg/kg  subcutaneously.  These  findings  were  considered  as 
incidental by the CHMP and likely not clinically relevant, and the risk to male fertility seems unlikely. 
A justification for not performing embryo-foetal developmental toxicity evaluation with anifrolumab was 
not provided. Some parameters including crown-rump length, femur length and biparietal diameter, and 
foetal  heart  rate  measurements  via  ultrasound  for  addressing  the  embryo-foetal  development  were 
included in the pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study, and they appeared to be within the 
normal range. However, high incidence of embryo-foetal loss was observed in the pre- and post-natal 
developmental toxicity study. Anifrolumab treatment of mothers started on GD20, and thus, the effects 
on early embryonic events are not evaluable. Consequently, it is not known if anifrolumab treatment has 
a harmful effect on early embryonic development or maintenance of pregnancy. See discussions below 
on SmPC / RMP implications.  
In the pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study, there was a clear imbalance in embryo-fetal 
loss ratios between the control and the anifrolumab- treatment groups being 6.3%, 29.4% and 18.8% 
for the control, 30 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. High incidence of embryo-fetal loss 
was observed within 2-3 weeks after start of anifrolumab dosing of the mothers. The applicant argues 
that this is not relevant as it falls within the historical foetal loss ratio in the testing facility; hence, the 
observed increased embryo-fetal loss ratios in the anifrolumab-treated groups should be interpreted as 
a  chance  finding.  This  was  not  fully  agreed  by  the  CHMP  as  the  number  of  animals  are  sufficient  for 
hazard identification, and consequently the relationship to the anifrolumab cannot be excluded based on 
the available data (see Section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
The  nonclinical  Enhanced  Pre-  and  Postnatal  Developmental  (ePPND)  study,  although  in  line  with  the 
current guidance, is not considered sufficient to exclude the potential anifrolumab-related harmful effects 
on reproduction. The dosing started on GD20 and consequently, early events are missed. Moreover, data 
beyond GD20 from mothers that experienced an embryo-fetal loss or other that external observations 
from dead foetuses are not presented. The applicant referred to two literature reports published in 1994 
and  1995  related  to  IFNAR1-deficient  mice,  and  concluded  that  type  I  interferons  do  not  affect 
reproduction.  However,  a  role  for  type  I  interferons  has  since  then  been  implicated  in  pregnancy, 
maternal-fetal  tolerance  and  development.  Also,  due  to  target  expression  in  the  vasculature  and 
placenta, anifrolumab might have vascular effects that could impact the maintenance of pregnancy.  
Although  the  infants  that  survived  until  the  birth-day  180  appeared  to  develop  normally,  there  is  a 
concern  that  anifrolumab  may  harmfully  impact  reproduction.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  the  conducted 
studies, i.e. ePPND study and assessment of female fertility aspects in the 39-week repeat-dose toxicity 
study, are considered to be in line with the current guidelines [ICH S5(R3) and ICH S6(R1)]. However, 
a limited amount of data is available from the mothers that experienced pregnancy loss as well as from 
the dead fetuses or infants. A comprehensive literature review was also submitted on the role of type I 
interferons and IFNAR1 in pregnancy highlighting the harmful effects of increased interferon levels during 
pregnancy. This is also true for SLE, as the patients often suffer from pregnancy complications. However, 
much less is known on the effects of interferon signalling blockade during pregnancy. There seems to be 
species  variability  in  the  involved  interferons  and  not  much  is  known  about  the  species-specificity. 
Nevertheless, as the target molecule IFNAR1 is expressed in the human placenta and vasculature, as 
also demonstrated with the tissue-binding data with anifrolumab, and the known role and importance of 
balanced interferon signalling in establishment and maintenance of pregnancy, there is a theoretical risk 
to reproduction due to interference of balanced immune modulation. It should be noted that the available 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022

data do not inform about the effect of anifrolumab on early pregnancy i.e. recognition, implantation and 
induction of maternal-foetal immune tolerance. Once the immune tolerance has been induced, effects 
due to blockade of signalling through IFNAR1 later during pregnancy may not be detected in an ePPND 
study. Due to limitations of the NHP model, lack of other pharmacologically responsive species, possible 
species-differences,  and  the  underlying  confounding  disease  background  in  SLE  patients,  the  CHMP 
concluded that further animal studies are unlikely to provide clinically meaningful data to inform about 
the risk to reproduction in this patient population. However, at the CHMP’s request, the SmPC sections 
4.6.  and  5.3  were  update  to  more  accurately  reflect  the  nonclinical  reproductive  toxicity  data  and 
adequately  communicate  the  risk.  Saphnelo  is  not  recommended  during  pregnancy  and  in  women  of 
childbearing potential not using contraception, unless the possible benefit justifies the potential risk. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with anifrolumab. This is acceptable 
as anifrolumab is not expected to cause genotoxicity. The weight of evidence suggests that blockade of 
type I interferon response may increase the risk of malignancies. This risk is reflected in Section 5.3 of 
the SmPC and is followed by the routine risk management activities (see Section 2.7). 
The  active  substance  is  a  natural  substance,  the  use  of  which  will  not  alter  the  concentration  or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, anifrolumab is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment. 
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Anifrolumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to subunit 1 of the 
type  I  interferon  receptor  (IFNAR1)  with  high  specificity  and  affinity.  This  binding  inhibits  type  I  IFN 
signalling  thereby  blocking  the  biologic  activity  of  type  I  IFNs.  Anifrolumab  also  induces  the 
internalisation  of  IFNAR1,  thereby  reducing  the  levels  of  cell  surface  IFNAR1  available  for  receptor 
assembly. Blockade of receptor mediated type I IFN signalling inhibits IFN responsive gene expression 
as well as downstream inflammatory and immunological processes. Inhibition of type I IFN blocks plasma 
cell differentiation and normalises peripheral T cell subsets, restoring the balance between adaptive and 
innate  immunity  that  is  dysregulated  in  SLE.  Overall,  the  pharmacological  data  provided  adequate 
evidence that anifrolumab is capable of inhibiting type I interferon responses relevant for the interferon-
related pathology of SLE and support the therapeutic rationale.  
The  selection  of  cynomolgus  monkey  as  pharmacologically  relevant  species  for  safety  evaluation  was 
adequately demonstrated and confirmed by the binding and functional data. 
The  pharmacokinetics  data  are  considered  appropriate  to  characterise  the  PK  profile  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys.  The  toxicological  programme  is  considered  appropriate  and  sufficient  to  characterise  the 
toxicity  profile  of  anifrolumab.  Non-clinical  data  reveal  no  special  hazard  for  humans  based  on 
conventional studies of safety pharmacology or repeated dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Anifrolumab is a monoclonal antibody, as such genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been 
conducted. In rodent models of IFNAR1 blockade, increased carcinogenic potential has been observed. 
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. This risk is reflected in Section 5.3 of the SmPC and 
is followed by the routine risk management activities (see Section 2.7). 
Animal studies show no adverse effects of anifrolumab on indirect measures of fertility. However, the 
risk to reproduction cannot be excluded based on the available nonclinical data. Given that it is unlikely 
that  further  animal  studies  would  provide  clinically  meaningful  data  to  inform  about  the  risk  in  SLE 
patients, a revision of the SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC was requested by the CHMP to correctly 
describe the nonclinical reproductive toxicity data. Saphnelo is not recommended during pregnancy and

in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using  contraception,  unless  the  possible  benefit  justifies  the 
potential risk. 
In conclusion, the application for anifrolumab in the treatment of adult patients with SLE is considered 
approvable from the nonclinical point of view.

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK, PD, and immunogenicity of anifrolumab has been characterised from 8 clinical studies (2 phase 
I,  2  phase  II,  2  phase  III,  and  2  long-term  extension  studies)  that  evaluated  the  IV  route  of 
administration.    Single-dose  and  multiple-dose  pharmacokinetics  of  anifrolumab  after  IV  infusion  was 
studied in patients with scleroderma (study MI-CP180) and single dose pharmacokinetics was evaluated 
in  healthy  volunteers  (D3461C00006,  hereafter  referred  as  study  06).  Three  phase  II  clinical  studies 
(CD-IA-MEDI-546-1013, CD-IA-MEDI-546-1145, D3461C00002, hereafter referred as study 1013, 1145 
and 02, respectively) and two phase III clinical studies (D3461C00004, D3461C00005, hereafter referred 
as  study  04  and  05,  respectively)  were  conducted  in  patients  with  the  target  indication,  i.e.  an  adult 
population with moderate to severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, the applicant has 
provided a population PK modelling report, an exposure-response modelling report and a summary of 
pooled  immunogenicity  data  from  phase  III  studies  related  to  clinical  pharmacology  to  support  the 
marketing authorisation of anifrolumab. The phase III study D3461C00009 is ongoing and its interim 
results were included in the population PK analysis. 
There  were  no  subjects  over  65  years  of  age  in  study  06;  three  patients  above  65  years  of  age 
participated in the scleroderma study MI-CP180. The age group distribution of patients participating in 
Phase III SLE studies (studies 04 and 05) is summarised in Table 42. 
In the clinical studies 1013, 02, 04, 05 and 1145 (long-term extension to study 1013) the patients with 
SLE  were  tested  at  screening  for  their  4-gene  type  I  IFN  gene  signature  which  are  the  most  highly 
expressed type I IFN genes in the target SLE patient population. The 4 type I interferon-inducible (target) 
genes (IFI27, IFI44, IFI44L, and RSAD2) relative to 3 reference (housekeeping) genes (18S, ACTB, and 
GAPDH) were used to classify a patient as type I IFN gene signature test high or type I IFN gene signature 
test low at baseline. These 4-gene type I IFN gene signature test results (IFNGS high or low) were used 
to  stratify  SLE  patients  at  randomisation  in  order  to  ensure  balance  among  treatment  groups  and 
facilitate subgroup analyses. 
Bioanalytical methods 
The ECL based immunoassay for determination of anifrolumab concentrations in human serum is based 
on  capturing  anifrolumab  with  biotinylated  IFNAR1  (B-IFNAR1)  bound  to  a  streptavidin-coated  MSD 
plate.  The  captured  anifrolumab  is  detected  with  a  sulfo-TAG  labeled  monoclonal  antibody  directed 
against  the  triple  mutation  (TM).  In  general,  the  validations  followed  the  principles  laid  down  in 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2** Guideline on bioanalytical method validation.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
The applicant has used non-compartmental methods to calculate the PK parameters (Cmax, AUC, t1/2 and 
CL)  for  anifrolumab  after  single  dose  and  multiple  dose  administration  in  patients  with  scleroderma 
(study MI-CP180) and in a small Phase II study in Japanese patients with SLE (study 02). In addition, 
the  PK  parameters  (Cmax,  AUC,  Tmax,  CL)  after  single  dose  administration  of  300  mg  IV  in  healthy 
volunteers were determined in the study 06, where the number and frequency of samples were sufficient 
to characterise the concentration-time profile for anifrolumab. In the studies MI-CP180 and study 02, 
more frequent and later time points would have improved the determination of the terminal elimination 
phase.  Pharmacokinetics  of  anifrolumab  was  evaluated  following  sparse  sampling  for  PK  analyses  in 
patients  with  the  target  indication,  i.e.  an  adult  population  with  moderate  to  severe  systemic  lupus 
erythematosus (SLE), in the phase II (study 1013, 1145) and phase III clinical studies (study 04 and 
05). The reported PK parameters were Cmax and Ctrough.

The population PK modelling report  
The objectives of the analysis were: 
• 
• 
• 
To characterize the PK properties of anifrolumab in healthy volunteers and adult patients with 
moderate to severe SLE; 
To  evaluate  the  potential  impact  of  demographics,  baseline  laboratory  values,  SLE  disease 
characteristics,  and  commonly  used  SLE  medications  on  the  PK  of  anifrolumab  in  healthy 
volunteers and adult patients with moderate to severe SLE. 
To evaluate the difference in PK between Process 2 clinical and Process 3 commercial materials 
used in study 09. 
The population PK analysis included pooled PK data from both SLE patients and healthy volunteers. The 
PK data for SLE patients came from 2 phase II studies (studies 1013 and 02) and 2 phase III studies 
(studies  04  and  05).  The  PK  data  for  healthy  volunteers  were  from  the  IV  arm  of  the  phase  I 
bioavailability study (study 06). The model was developed with data from studies 06, 1013, 02, and 05, 
and then externally validated with study 04. All PK samples, except for PK samples collected in the 60-
day follow-up period in study 1013 and the Stage II treatment period in study 02, collected in the first 
year of treatment were used. 
A target mediated drug disposition PK model with parallel elimination pathways by the reticuloendothelial 
system  and  IFNAR-mediated  internalisation  and  intracellular  degradation  was  adopted  to  describe 
anifrolumab PK following IV infusion in SLE subjects. The model was simplified by setting internalisation 
rate constant of anifrolumab-IFNAR1 complex to the degradation rate constant of IFNAR1 and fixed to 
77.4 d-1, a value estimated in confocal imaging studies (Wang et al 2013, doi: 10.1038/clpt.2013.35). 
As  a  result,  the  total  receptor  concentration  remained  constant  over  time.  Free  anifrolumab  was 
measured, and the model was used to predict free anifrolumab concentrations. 
The  relationship  between  continuous  covariates  and  PK  parameters  was  modelled  using  the  power 
function, centred by the median of the covariate, and the categorical covariates were modelled using the 
fractional change function of the covariate factor. 
The following baseline covariates were considered for inclusion in the PK model: 
•  Demographic covariates: body weight, sex, age, race, region, and ethnicity 
• 
Liver function: ALT, AST, and total bilirubin 
•  Renal function: eGFR and UPCR 
• 
Immunogenicity: ADA by screening assay 
•  Disease  related  and  other  covariates:  type  I  IFN  gene  signature  test  status,  concomitant 
medication  usage  (OCS,  antimalarial,  azathioprine,  methotrexate,  mycophenolate  mofetil 
mycophenolic acid, and mizoribine) 
The covariates were selected based on scientific interest, mechanistic plausibility, and prior knowledge. 
The  covariate-PK  relationships  were  evaluated  for  CL,  Vc,  and  R0  parameters.  Covariates  that  were 
missing or not evaluable for more than 15% of the patients in the pooled analysis were excluded from 
further covariate analysis. 
Among the covariates tested, body weight status was identified to be the most statistically significant 
covariate on anifrolumab CL, followed by type I IFN gene signature test status on CL; IFN gene signature 
status was found to have a larger drop in objective functional value on linear CL than R0. After accounting 
for type I IFN gene signature test status in CL, the addition of IFN gene signature status on R0, was not

found to be significant. In addition to IFN gene signature status on CL, baseline body weight on CL was 
also  found  to  be  a  statistically  significant  covariate.  Body  weight  was  also  found  to  be  a  statistically 
significant covariate on Vc. Age, eGFR, total bilirubin, and albumin were not found to be significant on 
CL. Further, the final model was updated with a time-varying component in CL. An empirical sigmoidal 
time-dependent function was added to the linear CL. 
The estimation of PK parameters was prematurely terminated due to rounding errors. The applicant was 
subsequently  requested  to  provide  robust  confidence  intervals  for  the  parameters,  and  the  applicant 
proceeded to calculate robust confidence intervals using bootstrap. Briefly, 500 resampled datasets were 
generated, and models fitted to these datasets. From these, 81 models converged successfully, and 338 
model fittings were terminated due to rounding errors; these models were used for the calculation of 
bootstrap confidence intervals, while the remaining models were discarded. The reported typical values 
for  CL,  Vc,  and  Vp  were  0.189  L/day,  3.27  L,  and  3.77  L,  respectively.  The  IIV  of  anifrolumab  was 
moderate with population CV% estimate of 52.7%, 19.9%, 26.1%, and 38.2%, respectively, for CL, Vc, 
R0,  and  time  to  maximum  plasma  concentration.  The  PK  parameters  estimated  from  the  model,  and 
their bootstrap-based confidence intervals (Table 2) show the median model-predicted concentration-
time profiles following a single-dose administration of 100 to 1000 mg, where doses ≤ 150 mg exhibited 
a rapid decline in anifrolumab concentration within 28 days and hence provided sub-optimal PK exposure 
in every 4-week dosing regimen. The population PK model was validated via Visual Predictive Checks 
both against the model-building data, and against external data not included in model-building phase.

Absorption  
The  applications  concern  a  concentrate  for  solution  to  be  administered  as  intravenous  infusion,  thus, 
there is no absorption of the active substance. 
Absorption and bioavailability after subcutaneous administration of single dose has been evaluated in a 
Phase  I  study  in  healthy  volunteers  (6  subjects  per  dose  group).  After  subcutaneous  administration, 
exposure to anifrolumab increased approximately dose-proportionally when the dose was increased from 
300  mg  to  600  mg  (Cmax  =  36.22  and  63.86  μg/mL,  respectively,  and  AUCinf  =  784.6  and  1828 
day*μg/mL,  respectively).  After  a  single  dose  of  300  mg  anifrolumab  given  IV,  mean  Cmax  was 
82.44 μg/mL,  Tmax  median  0.03  days  (min.-max.  0.03-1.03  days)  and  mean  CL  0.3396  L/day  (SD 
0.05459). The total exposure of IV administration by AUCinf was approximately 16% greater compared 
to the SC administration (906.5 and 784.7 day*μg/mL after 300 mg dose as IV and SC, respectively). 
The serum concentration-time profiles are presented in the Figure 2.

Bioequivalence 
The proposed anifrolumab drug product is 150 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion intended for 
administration  of  300  mg  of  anifrolumab  as  an  intravenous  infusion  over  a  30-minute  period,  every 
4 weeks.  The  applicant  has  not  conducted  bioequivalence  studies.  The  comparability  of  the  product 
batches  manufactured  using  different  processes  has  been  performed  by  quality  testing.  Process  3 
commercial material was first introduced in the study 09 at the end of 2018. In the population PK analysis 
report, the applicant has conducted 2 exploratory analyses to compare the indented commercial drug 
product produced by process 3 with the clinical study batches produced by process 2. The final analysis 
dataset  consisted  of  4366  PK  samples:  3865  (91.5%)  from  clinical  material  and  373  (8.5%)  from 
commercial  material.  The  applicant  analysed  the  change  in  anifrolumab  concentrations  over  time  for 
subjects taken Process 2  clinical material and Process 3 commercial material. However, only 8.5% of 
patients taken the commercial formulation respect to 91.5% that taken the clinical formulation. Although 
considering  the  paucity  of  PK  data  for  process  3,  the  exploratory  analyses  performed  to  assess  the 
difference  between  Process  2  and  Process  3  commercial  materials  used  in  study  09,  no  significant 
differences are evident among exposures reached with the two manufacturing processes. The provided 
exploratory analyses as supportive analysis of comparability are sufficient to the CHMP. 
Distribution 
Anifrolumab pharmacokinetics was observed to follow target meditated disposition distribution (TMDD) 
characterised by non-linear more than dose proportional increase of exposure by increasing single doses 
from  0.1  mg/ml  to  10  mg/kg  in  the  study  MI-CP180  in  patients  with  scleroderma  (Table  3).  A  dose-
proportional increase in maximum concentration (Cmax) was observed, but an increase in area under the 
concentration-time  curve  (AUC)  was  more  than  dose  proportional  between  0.1  and  10.0  mg/kg. 
However,  AUC  increased  dose  proportionally  between  10.0  and  20.0  mg/kg.  Systemic  clearance  (CL) 
decreased from 40.8 to 4.67 mL/kg/day when the dose was increased from 0.1 to 20.0 mg/kg, due to 
the saturation of the subunit 1 of the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR1) mediated clearance pathway.

In  the  dose-escalation  study  02  in  Japanese  patients  with  SLE,  single  dose  and  multiple  dose 
pharmacokinetics of anifrolumab was investigated in Stage I after administration 100 mg, 300 mg or 
1000 mg  with  IV  infusion.  The  serum  concentration-time  profiles  on  semi-logarithmic  scale  indicated 
rapid  distribution  phase  followed  by  slow  linear  elimination  phase  and  thereafter,  rapid  non-linear 
elimination with steep decline at lower concentrations in the Japanese SLE patients (study 02). The PK 
parameters  after  single  dose  and  multiple  dose  administration  are  summarised  in  Table  4.  The  mean 
Cmax for anifrolumab increased less than proportion to dose while the AUClast increased more than dose 
proportionally after the first doses of 100 mg, 300 mg and 1000 mg IV, respectively. After last dose on 
Day 337, the mean Cmax ss and AUCτ for anifrolumab increased more than in proportion to dose being 
25.0, 95.7 and 414.3 μg/mL and 152.3 (39.2), 1035.5 (488.0) and 5814.6 (2164.1) day*µg/ml for doses 
100,  300  mg  and  1000  mg  at  steady  state,  respectively.  Mean  Ctrough  increased  more  than  dose-
proportionally from 14.8 to 99.4 μg/mL when the dose increased from 300 to 1000 mg. The concentration 
time profile after single dose administration of 300 mg IV suggest that elimination rate starts to increase 
before the next dose on Day 28. After the last dose on Day 337, the dosing interval of 28 days is on the 
linear part of the concentration-time profile. The dose groups were not stratified for the type I IFN gene 
signature  at  screening,  and  the  majority  of  the  patients  belonged  to  type  I  IFN  gene  signature  high. 
Moreover, the number of patients was low and the dose groups differed in terms of body weight.

Based on the population PK analyses, the estimated central and peripheral volumes of distribution for 
anifrolumab were 2.93 L with 26.9 % CV inter-individual variability and 3.3 L, respectively, which are 
typical for IgG. Body weight was observed to affect the central volume of distribution (Vc) with the power 
parameter  (exponent)  estimate  of  0.764,  i.e.  patients  with  higher  body  weight  were  found  to  have 
significantly higher Vc.  
Elimination 
As  a  monoclonal  antibody  anifrolumab  is  eliminated  through  non-specific  linear  pathway  with 
reticuloendothelial system (RES) as well as target-mediated non-linear pathway through binding to IFN-
receptor on cell surface followed by internalisation and subsequent intracellular degradation. Renal and 
hepatic elimination do not play significant role in elimination or excretion of monoclonal antibodies. No 
data on excretion or metabolism of anifrolumab have been provided and these data are not required. 
The estimated typical linear CL for anifrolumab was 0.193 l/day with 33.0% CV inter-individual variability 
based on the population PK modelling. The reported clearance is typical for this kind of molecule. The 
median CL decreases slowly over time, with 8.4% after one year of treatment. The population PK model 
identified body weight and type 1 IFN gene signature test status as significant covariates for anifrolumab 
CL,  i.e.  patients  with  higher  body  weight  and  type  I  IFNGS  test  high  patients  were  found  to  have 
significantly higher CL.  
In preclinical studies, anifrolumab has been observed to bind to Fc Gamma Neonatal Receptor (FcRn) 
which protects it from degradation in endosomes and should prolong elimination half-life. In the non-
compartmental  analysis  of  study  MI-CP180,  the  elimination  half-life  of  anifrolumab  increased  with 
increasing dose being approximately 12 days after IV administration of 20 mg/kg dose in patients with 
scleroderma. In the phase III clinical studies 1013, 04 and 05, the serum concentrations of anifrolumab 
were  followed up  to  12  weeks  after  the  last  dose  on  week  48.  The  majority of  the  patients  had  their 
remaining  concentrations  eliminated  to  concentrations  below  LLOQ  during  this  period.  Based  on 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 49/198 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
population PK analysis, serum concentrations were  below detection in the majority (95%) of patients 
approximately 16 weeks after the last dose of anifrolumab, when anifrolumab has been dosed for one 
year. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
The pharmacokinetics of anifrolumab in the patients with moderate to severe SLE has been investigated 
at three dose levels; 150 mg and 300 mg IV infusion in the phase III study 05 and 300 mg and 1000 
mg IV infusion in the phase II study 1013. The PK was characterised by Cmax and Ctrough values in these 
studies. The doses 100 mg, 300 mg and 1000 mg were administered in the Phase II study in Japanese 
patients with SLE and concentration time profiles were followed with more dense sampling and exposure 
calculation of AUC-values. 
The applicant has not provided evaluation of dose-proportionality in the dossier. Based on the provided 
PK data, the post-dose concentrations (Cmax) are almost dose-proportional but the Ctrough increase more 
than in proportion to the dose after administration of 150 mg, 300 mg or 1000 mg q4w in the clinical 
studies. More than dose-proportional increase in AUCinf was observed in the clinical study MI-CP180 in 
patients with scleroderma and in Japanese patients with SLE (study 02). The non-linear PK and more 
than dose proportional increase in exposure is typical for cell membrane receptor-binding monoclonal 
antibodies.  The  population  PK  model  was  characterised  by  TMDD,  which  implies  that  exposure  is  not 
dose-proportional.  
Time dependency 
In the study 1013, the mean (SD) Ctrough after first 300 mg dose on day 29 were 6.82 µg/ml (5.31) and 
11.5 µg/ml  (7.38)  for  type  I  IFN  gene  signature  test  high  and  low  patients,  respectively.  There  was 
minimal accumulation in Cmax after multiple dosing with an accumulation ratio of 1.36 at the 300-mg 
dose level and 1.43 at the 1000-mg dose level by D169 after administration every four weeks (6 doses). 
However, mean Ctrough doubled after six multiple doses with an accumulation ratio of 2.49 at the 300-
mg dose level and 2.29 at the 1000-mg dose level by D169 and triples with an accumulation ratio of 
3.06 at the 300-mg dose level and 3.02 at the 1000-mg dose level at Day 365. The patients with type I 
IFN gene signature high had mean Ctrough 17.0 µg/ml while the patients with type I IFN gene signature 
low had slightly higher Ctrough 23.3 µg/ml. 
The accumulation ratios based on median post-dose concentration (Day 1 vs  Week 48) after multiple 
dosing ranged from 1.14 to 1.28 and from 1.05 to 1.08 in type I IFN gene signature test high and low 
patients in studies 05 and 04, respectively. In both studies 04 and 05, lower serum Ctrough of anifrolumab 
were observed in patients with baseline type I IFN gene signature test high compared to patients with 
type I IFN gene signature test low across all visits. At 48 weeks after dosing of 300 mg IV, the geometric 
mean  (CV%)  Cthrough  were  6.99  mg/ml  (1847.3%)  and  21.69  µg/ml  (382.0%)  for  type  I  IFN  gene 
signature test high and low patients, respectively, in the study 05, and 9.95 µg/ml (1311.2 %) and 16.73 
µg/ml (160.0 %) for type I IFN gene signature test high and low patients, respectively, in the study 04. 
In the clinical study 05, a higher inter-individual variability in anifrolumab exposure was observed in the 
anifrolumab  150  mg  group  as  compared  to  the  patients  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group.  The 
anifrolumab  PK  exhibited  time-varying  CL  where  in  most  patients  the  CL  slowly  decreased  i.e.,  the 
concentrations slowly increased, over time. Based on the population PK analysis, the median decrease 
in CL was 8.4% at the end of the first year and the maximum predicted decrease was 16.4%. Minor to 
moderate differences between subgroups by type I IFN gene signature test status and between studies 
were observed as the median asymptotic decrease in CL was numerically higher in type I IFN test high 
patients  compared  with  type  I  IFN  test  low  patients/healthy  subjects  (~17%  vs  14%  to  15%, 
respectively),  and  were  higher  in  study  1013  versus  study  05  and  04  (~23%  vs  14%  to  16%, 
respectively).  In  applicant’s  opinion,  the  decrease  in  CL  over  time  could  be  an  indicator  of  disease 
improvement, as higher CL was observed in patients with higher level of inflammation or active disease. 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 50/198 
 
 
 
Additionally,  approximately  15%  of  patients  exhibited  increasing  CL  over  time,  with  a  dose-related 
increase  observed  in  the  proportion  of  patients  with  increasing  CL.  No  particular  reason  related  to  a 
patient characteristic could be identified for the increasing clearance. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) effect 
on anifrolumab PK could not be observed because of limited number of ADA positive patients detected 
in the clinical studies (see Section 2.6.8 Clinical Safety). 
Special populations 
Type I IFN gene signature status 
In the clinical studies, lower serum Ctrough of anifrolumab were observed in patients with baseline type I 
IFN  gene  signature  test  high  compared  to  patients with  type  I  IFN  gene  signature test  low  across  all 
visits. The population PK model identified type 1 IFN gene signature test status as a significant covariate 
for anifrolumab CL with an exponent of 0.793, i.e. patients with type I IFNGS test high patients were 
found to have higher CL. In the population PK model, patients who were type I IFN gene signature test 
low had ~21% lower CL as compared with type I IFN gene signature test high patients. The effect of 
IFNGS test status on CL did not warrant dose adjustment for IFNGS high or low patients based on the 
efficacy and safety in phase III studies. Majority of the SLE patients in studies 04 and 05 (82.6%) had 
type I IFNGS test high at baseline. 
Weight 
In a population PK analysis, body weight was found to predict CL with an exponent of 0.6 for CL, and 
0.76 for central volume of distribution. The population PK analysis showed that the median CL in patients 
< 50 kg  and  ≥  90  kg  were  ~22%  lower  and  ~19%  higher,  respectively,  than  the  typical  CL  of  0.193 
L/day with typical body weight of 69.1 kg. The applicant has justified, that despite the significant effect 
of body weight on CL, there was no relevant clinical impact of body weight on efficacy, as morbidly obese 
patients with BMI > 35 kg/m2 still demonstrated a positive BICLA rate difference at Week 52 with respect 
to placebo in both studies 04 and 05. Similarly, the safety profile of anifrolumab is generally similar in 
patients with BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2 compared with those < 28 kg/m2 for up to 52 weeks of treatment.  
Impaired renal function and impaired hepatic function 
Separate clinical studies in subjects with impaired renal function or impaired hepatic function have not 
been  conducted  and  these  are  not  necessary  because  hepatic  and  renal  elimination  of  monoclonal 
antibodies is negligible. 
Based on the population PK analysis, the CL of anifrolumab in patients with mild (60-89 mL/min/1.73 
m2) and moderate (30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2) decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were 
comparable to those with normal renal function (≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2). The clinical studies did not include 
patients with severe decrease in eGFR or with severe end stage renal disease (<30 mL/min/1.73 m2).  
Patients  with  high  urine  protein/creatinine  ratio  (UPCR)  appeared  to  have  higher  CL,  however  this 
covariate  relationship  was  deemed  as  clinically  insignificant.  The  exclusion  criteria  for  UPCR  was  >  2 
mg/mg  (or  > 226.30 mg/mmol).  The  pooled  dataset  included  664  patients  with  UPCR  median  6.56 
mg/mmol (min, max = 1.47, 380.98 mg/mmol). The number of SLE patients with high UPCR values was 
low, thus, significant effect of UPCR on CL may not be observed in this population and the effect of high 
UPCR on CL remain unclear. Based on the population PK analysis, baseline hepatic function tests (AST, 
ALT, and total bilirubin) have no clinically relevant impact on the CL of anifrolumab. No clinically relevant 
relationship between serum bilirubin and CL, and between serum albumin and CL,  were found during 
population PK analysis.

Gender was not identified as significant covariate on CL, when adjusted for body weight in the population 
PK analysis. The majority of the patients with SLE were female, i.e. 92.5% (620/670) of the patients 
included in the population PK analysis. Based on the population PK analysis, race lacked apparent impact 
on CL of anifrolumab. 
The provided population PK analyses indicated that age had no clinically relevant impact on the CL of 
anifrolumab. The population PK analyses included data on patients with median age of 41 years, range: 
18 to 69 years. There were 20 (3%) patients ≥ 65 years of age. There is no clinical data on patients aged 
<18 years old. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Patients were treated concomitantly with several medicinal products in the clinical studies, thus, their 
effect on anifrolumab PK has been evaluated by population PK analysis. The permitted standard of care 
medication for SLE included oral corticosteroids (OCS) (prednisone, prednisolone or equivalent), intra-
muscular  or 
intra-articular 
corticosteroids,  antimalarials, 
slow-acting 
immunosuppressants 
(methotrexate,  mycophenolate,  mofetil/mycophenolic  acid,  and  azathioprine),  prescription  NSAIDs, 
analgesics/non-prescription NSAIDs, and topical therapy. Based on the population PK analysis, standard 
of care therapy had no impact on the CL of anifrolumab. Pharmacodynamic interactions have not been 
studied. 
Drug-Drug Interactions 
The  applicant  has  not  conducted  specific  drug-drug  interaction  studies  with  anifrolumab  because 
anifrolumab elimination is not dependent on CYP enzymes.  Pro-inflammatory cytokines may suppress 
CYP 450 activity during chronic inflammation like SLE. Anifrolumab treatment in study 1013 reduced the 
median baseline levels of TNF-αand IL-10 by 15% to 20% in SLE patients. Thus, therapeutic monitoring 
is  recommended  for  patients  treated  with  narrow  therapeutic  index  medicines  that  are  CYP  substrate 
and the dose is individually adjusted (e.g. warfarin). 
2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Clinical Exposure-Response Modelling Report 
The objectives of the analysis were: 
• 
To  evaluate  the  relationship  of  drug  exposure  and  the  primary  and  key  secondary  study 
endpoints: 
o  The proportion of patients with a BICLA response at Week 52 in all patients and in the 
subgroup of patients with high type I IFN gene signature test at screening 
o  The proportion of patients with a SRI(4) response at Week 52 in all patients and in the 
subgroup of patients with high type I IFN gene signature test at screening 
o  CLASI responders at Week 12 for the subgroup of patients with baseline CLASI activity 
score of ≥ 10 (i.e., moderate to severe skin disease) 
o  The proportion of patients who achieved an OCS dose ≤ 7.5 mg/day at Week 40, which 
was  maintained  through  Week  52  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  baseline  OCS 
≥ 10 mg/day 
o  Annualised flare rate through Week 52 
• 
To  evaluate  the  relationship  of  drug  exposure  and  safety,  specifically,  the  incidence  of  the 
following treatment-emergent AEs: 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022

o  Herpes zoster 
o  Serious infections 
o  Hypersensitivity,  anaphylaxis,  and  investigator-reported  AEs  of  infusion-related 
reactions 
o  Malignancy 
• 
To evaluate the relationship of drug exposure and PD (neutralisation of the 21-gene type I IFN 
PD signature) 
Exposure-efficacy  analysis:  The  exposure-efficacy  analysis  evaluated  PK  exposure  and  the  key 
efficacy  outcome  measures.  The  PK  exposure  was  stratified  by  quartiles  or  other  cutoffs  (eg, 
tertiles/median)  as  appropriate  based  on  sample  size.  The  proportion  of  patients  achieving  BICLA  or 
SRI(4) in the PK exposure groups were compared with the placebo group using the AME approach by 
taking into account the stratification factors (SLEDAI-2K score at screening [< 10 points vs ≥ 10 points], 
Week 0 OCS dose [< 10 mg/day vs ≥ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent], and type I IFN gene signature 
test result at screening [high vs low]), wherever applicable. The same approach was used to evaluate 
the exposure-efficacy relationship between individual PK exposure and the proportion of patients with 
baseline OCS ≥ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent who achieved an OCS dose ≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone 
or equivalent at Week 40 and maintained to Week 52, and the exposure-efficacy for the proportion of 
CLASI responders at Week 12. 
In the pooled phase III (studies 04 and 05) population, an overall positive benefit in BICLA response at 
Week 52 was consistently observed for the anifrolumab 300 mg group compared with placebo across all 
quartiles  and  tertiles  (Figure  3).  Overall  benefits  were  also  observed  in  SRI(4)  and  key  secondary 
endpoints  of  sustained  OCS  reduction,  CLASI  response,  and  flare  rates.  Additional  logistic  regression 
analyses  of  the  BICLA  response  rate  and  SRI(4)  response  rate  were  performed  by  evaluating  the 
significance of a continuous Cave in type I IFN test high patients who completed treatment (150 mg and 
300 mg) and exhibited a slight positive exposure-response trend in the absence of discontinuation. The 
analysis found a significant positive correlation between Cave and BICLA response rate at Week 52. The 
150 mg group was in the suboptimal region of the exposure-response curve, whereas the 300 mg group 
was at the plateau of the exposure-response curve that would minimize the impact of PK variability on 
efficacy. Furthermore, the highest dose in study 1013 (1000 mg) was projected to provide incremental 
benefit.

response analyses of safety parameters. 
There was an increased incidence of herpes zoster in patients who received anifrolumab when compared 
with  placebo  in  the  pooled  phase  III  population;  however,  there  was  no  evidence  that  higher

concentrations would lead to higher incidence of herpes zoster within each anifrolumab dose group (150 
or 300 mg). 
The overall incidence rate of non-opportunistic serious infections in the anifrolumab 300 mg group was 
lower compared with placebo in the pooled phase III population (3.9% vs 4.9%). 
The incidence of infusion-related reactions in the anifrolumab group was numerically higher compared 
with the placebo group in the pooled phase III population; however, there was no evidence that higher 
Cmax was associated with higher incidence. 
A numerical increase in the incidence of hypersensitivity was observed in the anifrolumab 150 and 300 
mg groups. The incidence was comparable between the anifrolumab 150 mg and 300 mg groups in the 
pooled phase III population; there was no evidence of exposure-driven hypersensitivity. 
There was a low rate of malignancy, and there was no evidence of exposure-driven malignancy. 
PK-PD analysis: The PKPD model focused on the 21-gene type I IFN PD signature in patients who had 
high (4-gene) type I IFN gene signature test at screening. A dose-related neutralisation/suppression of 
the type I IFN PD signature was observed across studies where doses ≥ 300 mg exhibited rapid onset of 
PD neutralisation at Week 4 and a median PD neutralisation of > 80% in type I IFN gene signature test 
high  patients,  whereas  in  the  anifrolumab  150  mg  group,  there  was  a  slow  onset  of  PD  effect  and  a 
median PD neutralisation of < 60% reached at Week 52. 
The PD of anifrolumab (21-gene type I IFN PD signature) was described by an indirect response model 
in which the type I IFN-inducible gene production (kin) was inhibited by free anifrolumab. Since the PD 
endpoint was the percent neutralisation of the type I IFN PD signature compared with baseline, the PKPD 
analysis set was limited to patients with high type I IFN gene signature at screening. The observed data 
were adequately captured by the 95% prediction interval. 
The parameter estimates of the model are tabulated in Table 5. Based on the IC50 estimate of 6.56 nM, 
the IC80 was approximately 26.24 nM (3.88 μg/mL with anifrolumab molecular weight of 148 kDa), where 
the median of Week 24 Ctrough of 300 mg in patients with type I IFN gene signature test high was ~16 
μg/mL and ~83% of the patients had troughs exceeding the IC80. Conversely, there was only ~27% of 
the Week 24 troughs in type I IFN gene signature test high patients who received 150 mg that exceeded 
IC80 concentrations, further confirming that 150 mg is a suboptimal dose.

PD-efficacy analysis: In the assessment of the relationship between neutralisation of the type I IFN 
PD signature and efficacy in type I IFN test high patients, individual median of PD suppressions from 
baseline at steady-state levels were correlated with both BICLA and SRI(4) at Week 52. In the pooled 
phase III population, including the anifrolumab 150 mg group, higher efficacy was associated with higher 
percent PD neutralisation in a graphical analysis. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
An ECL based immunoassay is used for determination of anifrolumab concentrations in human serum. 
The  assay  is  based  on  capturing  anifrolumab  with  biotinylated  IFNAR1  (B-IFNAR1)  bound  to  a 
streptavidin-coated  MSD  plate.  The  captured  anifrolumab  is  detected  with  a  sulfo-TAG  labeled 
monoclonal antibody directed against the triple mutation (TM). In general, the validations followed the 
principles  laid  down  in  EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009  Rev.  1  Corr.  2**  Guideline  on  bioanalytical 
method validation.  
Pharmacokinetics of anifrolumab after single dose and multiple dose IV administration was evaluated by 
non-compartmental analysis in patients with scleroderma (study MI-CP180) and in a small Phase II study 
in  Japanese  patients  with  SLE  (study  02).  In  addition,  the  PK  parameters  (Cmax,  AUC,  Tmax,  CL)  after 
single dose administration of 300 mg IV in healthy volunteers were determined in study 06, where the 
number  and  frequency  of  samples  were  sufficient  to  characterise  the  concentration-time  profile  for 
anifrolumab. In the studies MI-CP180 and 02, more frequent and later time points would have improved 
the determination of the terminal elimination phase. Additionally, in study 02, the dose groups were not 
stratified for the type I IFNGS at screening, the number of patients was low and the dose groups differed 
in terms of body weight. Both type I IFNGS and body weight were identified as significant covariates for 
CL, body weight also for Vc in the population PK analyses. PK data included in the non-compartmental 
analyses is limited and subjected to variabilities, thus, reliable conclusions on exposure cannot be made 
solely  based  on  these  data.  Despite  these  deficiencies,  nonlinear  more  rapid  elimination  at  lower 
concentrations could be identified in the non-compartmental analyses. These data together with the Cmax 
and Ctrough values from the SLE patients in the phase II and phase III clinical studies were included in 
the population PK analyses to further characterise the PK and covariate effects on PK. 
A population PK model has been fitted to PK data from several, but not all, available clinical trials. The 
model has two compartments, a linear first-order clearance, and a target-mediated clearance pathway 
which describes anifrolumab elimination after it has bound to IFNAR and the drug-receptor complex has 
been internalised to the cell. This way, the model captures the nonlinearity of anifrolumab clearance. 
The peripheral distribution processes are mainly informed by an IV arm of a phase I study, which included 
six  healthy  volunteers.  The  other  available  clinical  data  consisted  mostly  of  Cmax  and  trough 
concentrations over several dosing cycles. The Cmax is informative of central volume of distribution, and 
trough  concentrations  are  informative  of  overall  clearance.  The  identification  of  linear  and  target-
mediated clearances is possible because data are available over a range of doses, and because of the 
densely sampled PK data from the IV arm of a phase I study. 
Standard  software  and  algorithms  have  been used to  fit  the  population  PK  model.  However,  the  final 
population PK model minimisation has ended prematurely due to rounding errors, which means that the 
parameter  estimates  are  not  the  true  maximum  likelihood  estimates.  While  a  population  PK  model  is 
always an approximation of reality, typically the reported PK parameter estimates are the ones that best 
describe the data, given the model. Within the current population PK model, there is no such guarantee. 
However,  the  model  was  able  to  reasonably  describe  the  observed  data,  as  was  shown  via  Visual 
Predictive Checks for both the model-building data (internal validation), and studies 1145 and 09 data, 
which  were  not  used  during  model  fitting  (external  validation).  Furthermore,  the  model  did  converge 
successfully  when  study  04  data  were  not  included  within  the  model;  this  suggests  that  the  model 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 56/198 
 
 
 
convergence issues are not a result of overparameterisation, and the data are adequate to identify the 
parameters. As such, information from the population PK model is accepted by the CHMP as part of this 
marketing  authorisation  application,  even  if  the  reported  parameter  estimates  are  not  a  result  of 
successful model convergence.  
Anifrolumab is administered by intravenous infusion. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the 
estimated central and peripheral volumes of distribution for anifrolumab were 2.93 L (with 26.9% CV 
inter-individual variability) and 3.3 L, respectively for a 69.1 kg patient (SmPC section 5.2). These values 
are typical for an IgG molecule. 
Anifrolumab is a protein, therefore specific metabolism studies have not been conducted. Anifrolumab is 
eliminated  by  target  IFNAR  mediated  elimination  pathway  and  reticuloendothelial  system  where 
anifrolumab is expected to be degraded, into small peptides and individual amino acids, by proteolytic 
enzymes that are widely distributed in the body (SmPC section 5.2). Renal and hepatic elimination do 
not play significant role in elimination or excretion of monoclonal antibodies. No data on excretion or 
metabolism of anifrolumab have been provided and these data are not required. 
Anifrolumab PK is characterised by target-mediated drug disposition and non-linear PK in the dose range 
of 100 mg to 1000 mg as observed by the non-compartmental analysis in study MI-CP180 and study 02. 
Increasing the dose will result in an exposure increase that is higher than the increase in dose. In addition 
to  dose-dependent  exposure,  anifrolumab  showed time-dependency  in  clearance  observed  as  gradual 
increase  of  Cthrough  during  the  first  years  of  treatment  in  the  phase  II  study  1013.  The  linear  CL  of 
anifrolumab decreases as a function of time, with a maximum clearance of approximately 16% and about 
8% decrease in clearance occurring one year after the start of treatment, in a typical patient. According 
to  the  population  PK  report,  although  a  typical  patient  showed  decreasing  CL  over  time,  a  portion  of 
patients (15%) showed increasing CL of anifrolumab over time. The median increase in clearance (4.8% 
with 10th and 90th percentiles 0% and 19%) in the portion of patients treated with 300 mg in the studies 
04 and 05 was not significant and apparent effect on PD suppression was not observed. No particular 
reason related to a patient characteristic could be identified for the increasing clearance.  
Specific  dose  finding  studies  have  not  been  conducted  but  the  dose  selection  was  based  on  model 
informed decisions. The doses 150 mg, 300 mg and 1000 mg IV were administered in the phase II and 
III studies. The 150 mg dose was included to investigate dose response. The data with 1000 mg dose 
supports the safety evaluation of anifrolumab in addition to saturation of the target mediated elimination 
pathway. The selected dose of 300 mg seemed to produce sustained mean Ctrough concentrations with 
the  q4w  dosing  regimen  compared  to  150  mg  q4w.  The  percent  neutralisation  of  the  type  I  IFN  PD 
signature was approximately 70% on day 29 after administration of first 300 mg dose IV in SLE patients 
with type I IFNGS high, the mean Ctrough being 6.82 µg/ml (SD 5.31) in the study 1013. The applicant 
has reported in the exposure-response-model, that anifrolumab concentration corresponding to 80% of 
the maximum inhibition of PD signature production (IC80) was 3.88 µg/ml. The IC80 parameter has high 
inter-individual variability, and it seems that 300mg q4w is not able to fully suppress the PD signature 
in all patients.  
The recommended dose is 300 mg, administered as an intravenous infusion over a 30-minute period, 
every 4 weeks (SmPC section 4.2). In case of missed dose, a minimum interval of 14 days should be 
maintained between doses. This interval is half the dosing interval and prevents unnecessary high serum 
concentrations  and  accumulation  of  anifrolumab  exposure.  Based  on  population  PK  analysis,  serum 
concentrations were below detection in the majority (95%) of patients approximately 16 weeks after the 
last dose of anifrolumab, when anifrolumab has been dosed for one year. 
Inter-individual  variability  was  estimated  in  the  population  PK  model  for  CL  (CV  =  52.72%),  central 
volume  of  distribution  (CV=  19.92%),  baseline  receptor  concentration  (CV  =  26.09%)  and  for  the 
magnitude of maximal time-dependent decrease in CL (CV = 38.21%).The inter-individual variability of 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 57/198 
 
 
 
the Ctrough and even Cmax concentrations was high and there are both concentrations below the limit of 
quantitation  (LOQ)  of  the  analytical  method  (LOQ=0.02  µg/ml)  when  looking  at  the  range  of  the 
concentrations.  The  applicant  has  not  identified  any  particular  reasons  for  these  unexpected 
concentrations related to demographic data or bioanalytical method. The bioanalytical method validation 
for specificity did not indicate non-specific binding of anifrolumab to matrix components in serum of SLE 
patients. Otherwise, non-specific binding to blood components has not been studied. 
Only  body  weight  and  IFN  gene  signature  were  identified  as  predictors  of  anifrolumab  PK  in  the 
population pharmacokinetic analyses. The SLE patients belonging to type I IFN gene signature high had 
lower serum trough concentrations (Ctrough) as patients with type I IFN gene signature low. The geometric 
mean  (CV%)  Cthrough  were  6.99  µg/ml  (1847.3%)  and  21.69  µg/ml  (382.0%)  for  type  I  IFN  gene 
signature test high and low patients, respectively, in the study 05, and 9.95 µg/ml (1311.2 %) and 16.73 
µg/ml (160.0 %) for type I IFN gene signature test high and low patients, respectively, in the study 04 
at 48 weeks after dosing of 300 mg. The type I IFNGS status was identified as significant covariate on 
CL in the population PK analysis, but no dose adjustment is needed for IFNGS high or low patients.  
The  applicant  does  not  consider  dose  modifications  based  on  body  weight  necessary.  The  PK-PD 
simulations indicate that a proportion of patients are expected to have trough concentrations below 1.00 
µg/mL, and this proportion increases as weight increases. Also, there seems to be a significant proportion 
of patients who are predicted to have practically no PD suppression and the proportion increases with 
increasing bodyweight. However, random variability has a large impact on PD suppression; also patients 
with low bodyweight are somewhat likely to gain negligible PD suppression due to random variability. In 
this light, the impact of bodyweight seems negligible when compared to overall PD variability, and no 
relevant benefit is anticipated from shortening the dose interval for the heaviest individuals. It is noted 
that  the  proposed  300mg  Q4W  dose  does  not  seem  to  produce  a  reliable  PD  suppression  in  all  the 
patients;  however,  the  bodyweight-independent  dosing  recommendation  is  supported  by  the  CHMP 
(SmPC section 5.2). 
No  specific  clinical  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the  effect  of  renal  impairment  on 
anifrolumab because anifrolumab is not cleared renally. Based on population PK analyses, anifrolumab 
clearance was comparable in SLE patients with mild (60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2) and moderate decrease in 
eGFR (30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2) values and patients with normal renal function (≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
SLE patients with a severe decrease in eGFR or end stage renal disease (<30 mL/min/1.73 m2) were 
excluded from the clinical trials. 
Patients with UPCR >2 mg/mg were excluded from the clinical trials. Based on population PK analyses, 
increased urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) did not significantly affect anifrolumab clearance (SmPC 
section 5.2). 
No  specific  clinical  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the  effect  of  hepatic  impairment  on 
anifrolumab. As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, anifrolumab is principally eliminated via catabolism and 
is not expected to undergo metabolism via hepatic enzymes, as such changes in hepatic function are 
unlikely  to  have  any  effect  on  the  elimination  of  anifrolumab.  Based  on  population  pharmacokinetic 
analyses, baseline hepatic function biomarkers (ALT and AST ≤2.0 × ULN, and total bilirubin) had no 
clinically relevant effect on anifrolumab clearance (SmPC section 5.2). 
The  applicant  has  not  conducted  specific  drug-drug  interaction  studies  with  anifrolumab  because 
anifrolumab elimination is not dependent on CYP enzymes. This was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
Pro-inflammatory  cytokines  may  suppress  CYP  450  activity  during  chronic  inflammation  like  SLE. 
Anifrolumab treatment in study 1013 reduced the median baseline levels of TNF-αand IL-10 by 15% to 
20%  in  SLE  patients.  Thus,  therapeutic  monitoring  is  recommended  for  patients  treated  with  narrow 
therapeutic index medicines that are CYP substrate and the dose is individually adjusted (e.g. warfarin). 
Due to uncertainties in timing of the use of concomitant medication in relation to the study medication 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 58/198 
 
 
 
and to sample collection during the studies, the result of the population PK modelling is considered as 
general observation for no significant major interactions. Based on population PK analyses, concomitant 
use  of  oral  corticosteroids,  antimalarials,  immunosuppressants  (including  azathioprine,  methotrexate, 
mycophenolate  and  mizoribine),  NSAIDS,  ACE  inhibitors,  HMG-CoA  reductase  inhibitors  did  not 
significantly influence the PK of anifrolumab. This is adequately reflected in Section 5.2 of the SmPC.  
The applicant has conducted exposure-response, exposure-safety, PK/PD and PD-response analyses. 
An apparent exposure-response relationship was noted for the 300mg dose (Figure 3). Higher exposure 
correlated with higher probability of response. However, this apparent relationship is largely caused by 
subjects who discontinued the study and were thus labelled as non-responders. Because these subjects 
discontinued  early,  their  average  anifrolumab  concentrations  were  lower  than  the  anifrolumab 
concentrations of subjects who completed the study, thus causing an apparent correlation between low 
anifrolumab concentrations and non-response.  
The  applicant  has  claimed  that  the  exposures  achieved  from  300mg  dose  are  in  the  flat  part  of  the 
exposure-response curve, based on a logistic regression curve of log(1+Cave) as a predictor of response 
probability, where Cave is the average anifrolumab concentration over treatment duration. This claim is 
met  with  reservations  by  the  CHMP,  because  with  log-transformation,  the  linearity  or  flatness  of  the 
exposure-response  curve  will  depend  on  the  parameterisation  and  units,  i.e.  if  log(1+Cave)  is  the 
predictor  of  response,  then  different  results  will  be obtained  if  Cave  is  for  example  in  mg/mL  units  as 
compared to µg/mL units. 
With  regard  to  exposure-safety,  the  occurrence  of  select  adverse  events  (herpes  zoster  occurrence; 
serious  infections;  hypersensitivity,  anaphylaxis,  and  investigator-reported  AEs  of  infusion-related 
reactions; malignancy) was numerically higher in anifrolumab-treated patients than in placebo-treated 
patients for some of the adverse effect categories. However, apart from the placebo versus treatment 
comparison,  increasing  anifrolumab  exposure  was  not  associated  with  an  increasing  risk  of  adverse 
events. 
The PK/PD model captures the relationship between free anifrolumab concentrations and PD response, 
defined  as  the  relative  activity  of  21  genes  that  are  inducible  by  type  I  IFN.  The  IC80  value  from  the 
model, which describes the concentration required to elicit 80% of maximum response, was 3.88µg/mL. 
The IC80 parameter had a high inter-individual variability, with a coefficient of variation of 392%. The 
PK/PD  model  only  included  data  from  IFNGS  high  patients  because  only  these  patients  had  an 
overexpression of type I IFN gene signature. For IFNGS low patients, only minimal PD suppression was 
seen because these patients had no overexpression of the PD signature. A modest graphical PD-efficacy 
trend was noted, and no further analyses were conducted. 
Overall, the above analyses were considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Despite the limited PK data of anifrolumab and some deficiencies, nonlinear more rapid elimination at 
lower concentrations could be identified in the non-compartmental analyses implying target-mediated 
drug disposition for anifrolumab.  
The dense PK data from phase I and phase II studies together with the Cmax and Ctrough values from the 
SLE patients in the phase II and phase III clinical studies were included in the population PK analyses to 
further characterise the PK and covariate effects on PK. The PK model has two compartments, a linear 
first-order clearance, and a target-mediated clearance pathway which describes anifrolumab elimination 
after it has bound to IFNAR and the drug-receptor complex has been internalised to the cell. This way, 
the model captures the nonlinearity of anifrolumab clearance. The PK of anifrolumab and covariate effects

on PK has been characterised by the population PK modelling. The population PK model is considered an 
acceptable source of PK information by the CHMP, even though the model has not successfully converged 
to maximum likelihood estimates.  
From  population  PK  modelling  the  estimated  typical  systemic  clearance  (CL)  was  0.193  L/day  with  a 
33.0% CV inter-individual variability. The median CL decreases slowly over time, with an 8.4% reduction 
after 1 year of treatment. Based on population PK analysis, serum concentrations were below detection 
in  the  majority  (95%)  of  patients  approximately  16  weeks  after  the  last  dose  of  anifrolumab,  when 
anifrolumab  has  been  dosed for  one  year.  Due  to  saturation  of  IFNAR1-mediated  clearance  at  higher 
doses, exposure increases are greater-than-dose-proportional (SmPC section 5.2). 
The type I IFNGS status and body weight were identified as significant covariate on CL in the population 
PK analysis, but no dose adjustment is needed for IFNGS high or low patients or based on body weight. 
There was no clinically meaningful difference in systemic clearance based on age, race, ethnicity, region, 
gender, IFN status or body weight that requires dose adjustment. 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 
In  adult  patients  with  SLE,  administration  of  anifrolumab  at  doses  ≥300  mg,  via  intravenous  infusion 
every  4  weeks,  demonstrated  consistent  neutralisation  ( ≥ 80%)  of  a  21  gene  type  I  interferon 
pharmacodynamic (PD) signature in blood. This suppression occurred as early as 4 weeks post-treatment 
and  was  either  maintained  or  further  suppressed  over  the  52-week  treatment  period.  Following 
withdrawal of anifrolumab at the end of the 52-week treatment period in the SLE clinical trials, the type 
I IFN PD signature in blood samples returned to baseline levels within 8 to 12 weeks. Anifrolumab 150 
mg IV, showed <20% suppression of the gene signature at early timepoints, that reached a maximum 
of <60% by the end of the treatment period. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  applicant  has  sufficiently  addressed  the  issues  on  PK,  PK/PD  or  PD-
response analyses of anifrolumab. 
The proposed dosing regimen of 300 mg, administered as an intravenous infusion over a 30-minute 
period, every 4 weeks was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy 
A tabular overview of clinical studies conducted to support the application is provided in Table 1. 
The key studies for assessment of safety and efficacy within the programme comprised: 
• 
Two  completed  52-week,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled,  Phase  III  studies: 
D3461C00004 or ‘Study 04’ (TULIP 2), and D3461C00005 or ‘Study 05’ (TULIP 1) 
•  An  ongoing  3-year,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  long-term  extension  study  containing 
patients rolled over from studies 04 and 05 (D3461C00009 or ‘Study 09’). Interim safety data 
from  study  09  are  reported  in  the  Summary  of  Clinical  Safety  while  exploratory  efficacy 
endpoints, including SLEDAI-2K scores over time, will be reported when the study is complete; 
anticipated in Q2 2022.  
•  One completed 52-week Phase II study: CD-IA-MEDI-546-1013 or ‘Study 1013’ (MUSE) 
•  A completed 3-year, open-label extension study containing patients rolled over from study 1013 
(study CD-IA-MEDI-546-1145 or ‘Study 1145’) 
Within the submission, the applicant has presented Study 04 as a pivotal study,  with Studies 05 and 
1013 providing supportive evidence of efficacy. Considering that the original aim was for both Study 04 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 60/198 
 
 
 
and Study 05 to serve as pivotal studies (but with Study 05 failing on its original primary endpoint), the 
efficacy section of the AR presents all key studies in an integrated manner without separate consideration 
of the applicant’s classification regarding the status of the studies. 
2.5.5.1.  Dose response study 
The Phase II study 1013, which could also be considered a dose response study, is discussed within the 
main studies below. Dose selection for Study 1013 was based on PK/PD modelling and simulation as well 
as a PK/PD analysis of a Phase I study in scleroderma patients. 
For the Phase III studies 04 and 05, selection of a dose of 300 mg Q4W was based on safety and efficacy 
results from the interim analysis of Study 1013. In the interim analysis, clinically meaningful benefit was 
observed with the 300 mg dose, with no incremental benefit at 1000 mg. In addition, a higher proportion 
of  patients  reporting  herpes  zoster  reactivations  was  observed  at  1000  mg  compared  to  300  mg.  In 
Study 05, a dose of 150 mg was also evaluated; according to the applicant, this dose was included to 
elucidate dose response and to provide additional justification for the 300 mg dose. However, due to the 
lack of a consistent pattern of efficacy, the applicant is not seeking marketing authorisation for a posology 
of 150 mg. 
2.5.5.2.  Main studies 
Demonstration of clinical efficacy is based on three large-scale randomised double-blind studies. As the 
methodology across the three studies was very similar, the Methods and Results sections present the 
studies together, with differences between the studies highlighted as relevant.

Regarding concomitant medications, an attempt to taper oral corticosteroids (OCS) was included in the 
protocol as follows: 
• 
In studies 04 and 05, for patients receiving baseline ≥ 10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent, 
tapering  attempts  were  mandated  between  Week  8  and  Week  40  until  achieving  a  dose 
≤ 7.5 mg/day. Tapering was also encouraged for patients receiving OCS < 10 mg/day at baseline. 
OCS  dosages  were  required  to  be  stable  for  the  last  12  weeks  before  the  primary  endpoint 
assessment at Week 52. 
• 
In  study  1013,  OCS  tapering  was  encouraged  based  on  disease  activity,  after  randomisation 
except  within  8  weeks  of  the  primary  (Week  24)  and  secondary  (Week  52)  endpoint 
assessments. A steroid tapering milestone to ≤ 10 mg/day was a component of the primary and 
secondary endpoints—combined with the SRI(4) measure of disease activity. Steroid tapering to 
≤ 7.5 mg/day was the target used to evaluate the secondary objective of reduced OCS use. 
Objectives 
The primary objective in all three studies was to evaluate the effects of anifrolumab on overall disease 
activity. Two primary endpoints, as outlined in more detail below, were used. Secondary objectives were 
chosen to further characterise the reduction in overall disease activity, in particular the ability to reduce 
OCS use, the effect on organ-specific endpoints (cutaneous SLE activity and joints), and flare rates. 
Statistical analyses were based on demonstrating superiority against a placebo control. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The efficacy endpoints used in the key studies and their hierarchy, as presented within the application, 
are outlined in Table 6.

Due to the heterogeneity and complexity of SLE, composite endpoints are often used to evaluate disease 
activity  across  multiple  organ  systems.  Two  composite  endpoints,  BICLA  and  SRI,  have  been  used  in 
clinical trials and both were used in the anifrolumab studies.  
The disease activity instruments used for assessment of BICLA and SRI(4) response are BILAG-2004, 
SLEDAI-2K and PGA. 
BILAG-2004  is  an  ordinal  scale  index  with  97  organ-specific  items  in  9  systems  (constitutional, 
mucocutaneous,  neuropsychiatric,  musculoskeletal,  cardiorespiratory,  gastrointestinal,  ophthalmic, 
renal,  and  haematology)  that  is  able  to  capture  changes  in  clinical  manifestations.  It  records  disease 
activity occurring over the immediate past 4 weeks, as compared with the previous 4 weeks, whereby 
organ manifestations are assessed as not present, improving, same, worse, or new. It is based on the 
principle of a physician’s intention to treat and categorises disease activity across the 9 systems as levels 
A  to  E,  (where  ‘A’  indicates  severe  disease,  ‘B’  is  moderate  activity,  ‘C’  is  mild  stable  disease,  ‘D’  is 
resolved activity, and ‘E’ indicates the organ was never involved). These levels can be translated into 
numeric  scores.  A  BILAG-2004  index  including  at  least  one  ‘A’  or  two  ‘B’s  is  considered  to  reflect 
moderate to severe disease requiring therapy. 
The BILAG-2004 gives equal weight to all affected body systems and is capable of measuring incremental 
improvements or worsening within a body system. For example, a 50% improvement, such as a clinically 
meaningful reduction from 30% to 15% of the skin surface involved with a skin eruption, the BILAG-
2004 level for that organ would change from A (severe activity) to B (moderate activity). The BILAG-
2004 requires improvement in all baseline manifestations within a system to result in a change in that 
system’s BILAG-2004 level. For example, a patient with skin eruption and severe mucosal ulceration at 
baseline must show improvement in both to result in a change in the BILAG-2004 mucocutaneous index 
level. 
The SLEDAI-2K consists of a list of 24 defined organ manifestations covering 9 organ systems (central 
nervous system, vascular, renal, musculoskeletal, serosal, mucocutaneous, immunologic, constitutional, 
and  haematologic).  These  manifestations  are  assessed  as  being  ‘present’  or  ‘absent’  in  the  previous 
28 days and attributable to SLE. Organ involvement scoring is weighted differently (eg, rash, alopecia, 
and low complement are each scored 2, musculoskeletal and renal activities are scored 4, and central 
nervous system activity is scored 8). The summation of the weighted organ manifestations into a final 
score ranges from 0 to 105. A SLEDAI-2K score of 6 or more has shown to be consistent with moderate 
to  severe  disease  requiring  therapy,  and  scores  greater  than  20  are  rare.  A  clinically  meaningful 
improvement is defined as a reduction in SLEDAI-2K of 4 units. With each domain scored in a binary 
fashion as present or absent, a SLEDAI-2K score reduction is only recorded on complete resolution of a 
disease manifestation. For example, a notional 50% improvement in multiple organ systems would not 
result in any change in SLEDAI-2K. 
The PGA is a physician-rated global assessment of disease activity utilising a modification of the classic 
VAS (0-3 scale), with 0 = no, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe disease; for example, “3” refers 
to the most severe possible disease and does not reflect the most severe seen in a given patient. This is 
a  global  assessment  factoring  in  all  aspects  of  the  patient’s  SLE  disease  activity  and  represents  the 
physician’s (trained and certified) overall assessment of average SLE disease severity. 
In  the  anifrolumab  programme,  the  applicant  included  two  intercurrent  events  (no  discontinuation  of 
investigational product, and no use of restricted medications beyond the protocol-allowed threshold) as 
components  of  the  composite  estimand.  Consequently,  a  BICLA  responder  was  defined  as  a  patient 
meeting all of the following criteria: 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 68/198 
 
 
 
•  Reduction  of  all  BILAG-2004  baseline  A  items  to  B/C/D  and  baseline  B  items  to  C/D,  plus  no 
worsening  in  other  organ systems;  worsening  is  defined  as  one  or  more  new A  items  or  2 or 
more new B items 
•  No worsening from baseline in SLEDAI-2K (defined as an increase from baseline of > 0 points in 
SLEDAI-2K) 
•  No worsening of the physician-rated global estimate of disease activity from baseline (defined 
by ≥ 0.30 points on a PGA VAS [0-3 scale]) 
•  No discontinuation of investigational product 
•  No use of restricted medications beyond the protocol-allowed threshold before assessment 
An SRI(4) responder was defined as a patient meeting all of the following criteria: 
•  4-point or greater improvement of SLEDAI-2K from baseline 
•  No new organ system affected as defined by one or more new BILAG-2004 level A or 2 or more 
new level B items compared with baseline (ie, no new level A and no more than one new level B 
score) 
•  No worsening of the physician-rated global estimate of disease activity from baseline (defined 
by ≥ 0.30 points on a PGA VAS [0-3 scale]) 
•  No discontinuation of investigational product 
•  No use of restricted medications beyond the protocol-allowed threshold before assessment 
Study withdrawal (i.e. a patient withdrawing completely from the study, leading to true absence of data 
from time of withdrawal onward) was also considered an intercurrent event leading to categorisation of 
the patient as a non-responder subsequent to withdrawal. 
When the Phase III studies 04 and 05 were initiated in 2015, SRI(4) response at 52 weeks was chosen 
as the primary endpoint to measure changes in overall disease activity. According to the applicant, the 
decision was based on the positive results achieved with SRI(4) in the phase II study 1013, as well as 
the fact that it had been previously accepted by the regulatory authorities as the basis of approval of 
belimumab for SLE. BICLA response at 52 weeks was a pre-specified secondary/exploratory endpoint in 
all 3 studies, although it was not included in the multiplicity control. 
The  first  Phase  III  study  (Study  05)  was  unblinded  in  August  2018,  and  the  full  set  of  pre-specified 
analyses became available in September 2018. Study 05 did not meet its primary endpoint, SRI(4) at 
52 weeks. However, improvements in overall disease activity were observed in terms of BICLA response 
and other secondary endpoints, and in consultation with an external Steering Committee for the TULIP 
programme, the applicant subsequently changed the primary endpoint of Study 04 to BICLA response. 
According to the applicant, the review was conducted and decisions made while study 04 was blinded 
and after all patients had completed the 52-week treatment period, and no data from the blinded study 
04 were reviewed for this purpose nor used to inform the decisions. 
The applicant has justified the appropriateness of the change based on the following premises: 
•  Reduction  in  disease  activity  in  BICLA  is  measured  by  the  BILAG-2004  index,  which  captures 
more disease-related elements than the SLEDAI index, which is used to measure disease activity 
in SRI(4). Thus BICLA captures more of the clinical diversity of SLE disease activity than SRI(4). 
• 
The BILAG-2004 is a more sensitive measure to changing severity of organ involvement as it 
captures  incremental  improvements  or  worsening  within  a  body  system,  whereas  SLEDAI-2K 
score reduction reflects only complete resolution of a disease manifestation.

• 
It is stringent, as it requires improvement in all organs affected at baseline, with no new flares 
in the remaining body systems. 
It weighs organ systems equally according to the physician’s intention to treat. Importantly, for 
the typical SLE trial population, skin and joints are given equal weighting to each other and to 
all other organs. 
A number of secondary endpoints were defined for further characterisation of changes in disease activity. 
Key secondary endpoints were multiplicity controlled, other secondary endpoints were tested outside of 
the confirmatory framework. 
•  BICLA (Study 04) and SRI(4) (Study 05) at Week 52 in the type I IFN gene signature test-high 
subgroup  was  used  as  a  key  secondary  endpoint  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  anifrolumab  in  this 
subgroup. 
• 
• 
To  assess  whether  anifrolumab  could  permit  a  tapering  of  oral  corticosteroids  (OCS),  the 
proportion  of  patients  with  baseline  OCS  ≥  10  mg/day  who  could  achieve  a  target  OCS  dose 
≤ 7.5 mg/day  prednisone  or  equivalent  by  Week  40  and  maintain  it  through  Week  52  was 
analysed as a key secondary endpoint in studies 04 and 05 and as a secondary endpoint in Study 
1013. 
It should be noted that in studies 04 and 05, OCS tapering was mandated per protocol, whereas 
in Study 1013, OCS tapering was only recommended. The primary endpoint in Study 1013 was 
SRI(4) combined with the ability to taper OCS. 
To evaluate the effect of anifrolumab on inflammatory cutaneous lupus lesions, the proportion 
of patients with ≥ 50% reduction in Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity 
Index (CLASI) score at Week 12 in patients with moderate to severe skin disease (CLASI ≥ 10) 
at baseline was analysed as a key secondary endpoint in studies 04 and 05 and as a secondary 
endpoint in Study 1013. 
•  A reduction in swollen and tender joint counts was analysed as an exploratory endpoint in Study 
1013, a secondary endpoint in Study 05 and escalated as a key secondary endpoint for Study 
04. The definition of response was slightly different from study to study. 
• 
In studies 04 and 05, a moderate to severe flare was defined as either 1 or more new BILAG-
2004  A  item  or  2  or  more  new  BILAG-2004  B  items  compared  to  the  previous  visit  (i.e.,  a 
worsening from an E, D, or C score to a B score in at least 2 organ systems or a worsening from 
an E, D, C, or B to an A score in any 1 organ system compared to the previous visit). The effect 
of anifrolumab on the annualised flare rate through Week 52 was a key secondary endpoint in 
studies 04 and 05. 
•  Higher  thresholds  of  disease  improvement  (SRI[5]  to  SRI[8])  were  evaluated  as  secondary 
endpoints. Intercurrent events were not considered for these endpoints. 
• 
Two  concepts  of  a  sustained  response  [“major  clinical  response”  (MCR)  and  “partial  clinical 
response”  (PCR)]  were  also  evaluated  as  secondary  endpoints.  MCR  was  defined  as  a  patient 
with BILAG-2004 C scores or better at Week 24 with no new A or B scores, and maintenance of 
response  with  no  new  BILAG-2004  A  or  B  scores  between  Week  24  and  Week  52.  PCR  was 
defined  as  a  patient  with  a  maximum  of  one  BILAG-2004  B  score  or  better  at  Week  24,  and 
maintenance  of  response  without  a  new  BILAG-2004  A  or  more  than  one  new  BILAG-2004  B 
item out to Week 52. Intercurrent events were not considered for these endpoints. 
•  A number of patient-reported outcomes were also evaluated among the secondary endpoints. 
These included:

As outlined above, the applicant’s definitions for BICLA and SRI(4) response were composite estimands 
that  included  an  intercurrent  event  of  “No  use  of  restricted  medications  beyond  the  protocol-allowed 
threshold”.  Following  a  review  of  the  study  05  data  (prior  to  unblinding  of  study  04),  the  applicant 
considered  that  some  of  these  rules  had  not  been  interpreted  correctly  and  made  corrections  and 
adjustments  to  the  restricted  medication  rules.  In  terms  of  the  number  of  patients  affected  by  the 
revision, the clearly most significant change was related to NSAID’s; with the original rules, 21 patients 
in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and 9 patients in the placebo group were considered non-responders, 
whereas no patients in either group were considered non-responders based on the revised rules.

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Block  randomisation  using  an  interactive  voice/web  response  system  (IXRS)  was  used  to  randomise 
patients in 1:1 ratio to receive a  fixed IV dose of 300 mg anifrolumab or placebo in Study 04 and in 
1:2:2 ratio to receive a fixed IV dose of 150 mg anifrolumab, 300 mg anifrolumab or placebo in Study 
05. 
The randomisation was stratified using the following factors: 
•  SLEDAI-2K score at screening (<10 points versus ≥10 points) 
•  Week  0  (Day  1)  OCS  dose  (<10  mg/day  versus  ≥10  mg/day  prednisone  or  equivalent)  as 
reported by the investigator 
•  Results of the type I IFN gene signature test (high versus low) 
The  random  allocation  sequence  was  generated  globally  (not  by  centre)  considering  8  strata.  Block 
randomisation  using  an  interactive  voice/web  response  system  was  used  to  randomise  patients  in 
permuted blocks: 
•  Study  1013:  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  (300  mg  anifrolumab,  1000  mg  anifrolumab,  or  placebo)  with  a 
block size of 3. 
•  Study 04: in a 1:1 ratio (300 mg anifrolumab or placebo) with a block size of 4. 
•  Study 05: in a 1:2:2 ratio (150 mg anifrolumab, 300 mg anifrolumab, or placebo) with a block 
size of 5. 
All key studies (studies 1013, 04 and 05) were double-blind. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
Full analysis set 
The  full  analysis  set  was  used  as  the  primary  population  for  reporting  efficacy  and  safety  data.  This 
comprises all subjects randomised into the study who receive at least 1 dose of investigational product 
and was analysed according to randomised treatment (modified Intention-To-Treat). 
Primary Efficacy Analyses 
The primary estimand in study 04 was the difference between anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo in the 
proportion of patients achieving BICLA response at Week 52. As outlined above, the primary estimand 
was  derived  using  a  composite  strategy  that  included  three  intercurrent  events  (use  of  restricted 
medication; investigational product discontinuation; withdrawal from study), and the occurrence of any 
of these led to the categorisation of the patient as a non-responder. The estimand was measured by the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint (difference  in  the  proportion  of  BICLA  responders  between  the  anifrolumab 
300 mg and placebo groups at Week 52). The primary objective of study 05 was constructed in the same 
way as study 04, however, evaluated using SRI(4). 
In  study  04,  the  null  hypothesis  that  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  a  BICLA  response  on 
anifrolumab 300 mg is equal to that on placebo was evaluated. The alternative hypothesis was that the 
proportion of patients achieving a BICLA response on anifrolumab 300 mg is not equal to that on placebo, 
ie, 
H0: difference in proportion achieving a BICLA response (anifrolumab vs placebo) = 0 
Ha: difference in proportion achieving a BICLA response (anifrolumab vs placebo) ≠ 0. 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 72/198 
 
 
 
The null and alternative hypotheses for study 05 were constructed similarly for SRI(4) response. 
A stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with the same stratification factors as for the randomisation, 
i.e.,  disease  activity  at  screening  (SLEDAI-2K  <  10  points  versus  ≥   10  points),  Day  1  OCS  dose 
(< 10 mg/day versus ≥ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), and results of the type I IFN gene signature 
test at screening (high versus low) were used for the assessment of the primary objective in both studies. 
To enable the comparison of studies 04 and 05, efficacy endpoints that included assignment of patients 
as non-responders based on use of restricted medications were re-derived for study 05 using the same 
restricted medication rules used in study 04. 
Several sensitivity analyses were planned in the SAP of Study 04 to assess the impact of intercurrent 
events and missing data. 
The  key  secondary  endpoints  in  Studies  04  and  05  were  not  the  same.  If  the  primary  endpoint  was 
statistically significant, then the key secondary endpoints were tested and the weighted Holm procedure 
with pre-defined weights used in order to strongly control the family-wise error rate at the 2-sided 5% 
level.  The  weights  were  chosen  based  on  a  combination  of  estimated  power  for  the  individual  key 
secondary endpoints and their relative clinical importance. The actual weights were not identical between 
the two studies. 
The key secondary endpoints were analysed similarly, with the exception of the effect on the annualised 
flare  rate,  which  was  analysed  using  a  negative  binomial  regression  model.  The  model  included  the 
covariates of treatment group and the stratification factors. The logarithm of the follow-up time was used 
as an offset variable in the model to adjust for patients having different exposure times. 
There were no interim analyses in either of the two studies. 
Results 
Participant flow 
In  Study  1013,  307  patients  were  randomised  and  305  patients  received  investigational  product  (99, 
104,  and  102  patients  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg,  anifrolumab  1000  mg,  and  placebo  groups, 
respectively); 84.0% patients in the anifrolumab 300 mg group, 81.7% patients in the anifrolumab 1000 
mg group, and 74.8% patients in the placebo group completed the study. 
In Study 04, 365 patients were randomised and 362 patients received investigational product (180 and 
182  patients  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  and  placebo  groups,  respectively);  85.0%  of  patients  in  the 
anifrolumab 300 mg group and 71.4% of patients in the placebo group completed study treatment. The 
most common reason for study withdrawal was “Withdrawal by Patient”. 
In  Study  05,  457  patients  were  randomised  and  received  investigational  product  (93,  180,  and 
184 patients in the anifrolumab 150 mg, anifrolumab 300 mg, and placebo groups, respectively); 80.6% 
of  patients  in  the  anifrolumab  150  mg  group,  80.0%  patients  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group,  and 
79.3% patients in the placebo group completed study treatment. 
In  studies  04  and  05,  the  percentage  of  screened  patients  who  were  not  randomised  were  44%  and 
46%, respectively. The most common reasons for not meeting the randomisation criteria were 1) not 
fulfilling  the  SLE  disease  activity  criteria,  2) prohibited  concomitant  medication  use,  and  3)  screening 
laboratory test results. 
Patient disposition in Study 1013 is displayed in Table 7, and patient disposition in studies 04 and 05 is

In Study 04, the overall number of study withdrawals before Week 52 was higher in the placebo group 
(n  =  37,  20.3%)  than  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  (n  =  18,  10.0%)  whereas  withdrawals  were 
balanced  between  treatment  arms  in  Study  05;  n  =  27,  14.7%  vs  n  =  27,  15.0%  for  placebo  vs 
anifrolumab 300 mg, respectively). The higher number of withdrawals in the placebo group as compared 
with anifrolumab 300 mg group in Study 04 was mainly driven by more patients in the placebo group 
withdrawing due to withdrawal by patient (17 vs 9 for placebo vs anifrolumab as compared to 10 vs 13 
in Study 05) as well as due to an adverse event (7 vs 3 patients on placebo vs anifrolumab 300 mg as 
compared to 5 vs 10 in the corresponding groups in Study 05) (Table 9).

Table 9 Patients Status at Week 52 and Reasons for Withdrawal from Study (Study 04 and Study 05, 
Full Analysis Sets) 
In both Study 04 and 05, more patients in placebo groups withdrew from study due to lack of therapeutic 
response, i.e., lack of efficacy or condition worsened, as compared with anifrolumab-treated patients. 
According to the applicant, the AE leading to withdrawal in placebo groups was an SLE flare in 3 of 7 
patients in Study 04 and 2 of 5 patients in Study 05, whereas no particular type of AE was found that 
could explain the higher number of study withdrawals in anifrolumab 300 mg group as compared with 
placebo group in Study 05 or as compared with anifrolumab 300 mg group in Study 04. 
A structured, blinded internal review of each individual patient who withdrew from Study 04 and 05 due 
to  “withdrawal  by  patient”  was  undertaken  by  the  applicant  and  showed  that the  majority  of  placebo 
patients in both Study 04 and 05 displayed signs of lack of therapeutic response at the time of study 
withdrawal. To investigate this further, and based on the assumption that patients who lack treatment 
response are more likely to use restricted medications and discontinue IP and subsequently withdraw 
from study, the proportion of patients with worsening in disease activity on SLEDAI-2K, BILAG and/or 
PGA at IP discontinuation was assessed in relation to reason for discontinuation. This analysis showed 
that the proportions of placebo patients who discontinued IP due to “withdrawal by patient” (Table 10) 
and had worsening on at least one of the disease activity scales were very similar in Study 04 (8 of 16, 
50%) and Study 05 (6 of 13, 46%). Thus, despite the number of study withdrawals in Study 04 being 
higher among placebo patients than in the anifrolumab 300 mg group, the proportion of placebo patients 
with worsening of disease at withdrawal was very similar to the proportion seen in placebo patients in 
Study 05.

Demographic characteristics across the three studies are displayed in Table 11. Mean age was 39 to 43 
years, and over 90% of patients in each study were female. The majority of patients in studies 04 and 
05 were white; both 04 and 05 also enrolled a substantial number of Black patients, and over 16% of 
patients in Study 04 were Asian. A large proportion of patients in Study 1013 were mestizos/mestizas 
enrolled  in  Latin  America (represented  in  the  “Other”  category  in  the  Table). While  ACR  classification 
criteria for SLE were used in the studies, over 98% of patients receiving anifrolumab 300 mg or placebo 
in the Phase III studies also met the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE.

and 12 patients on placebo, and adult-onset in 166 patients on anifrolumab and 170 patients on placebo. 
In Study 05, SLE was paediatric-onset in 12 patients on anifrolumab 300 mg and 12 patients on placebo,

The all patients analysis set was used for reporting patient disposition and screening failures and 
comprised all patients enrolled in the study. 
The full analysis set was used as the primary population for reporting efficacy data and comprised 
all patients randomised into the study who received at least one dose of investigational product. 
Patients were analysed according to randomised treatment. The full analysis sets comprised 362 patients 
in study 04 (180 anifrolumab 300 mg, 182 placebo), 457 patients in study 05 (180 anifrolumab 300 mg,

The analysis set used for the phase III pool was the combined study 04 and study 05 full analysis sets, 
excluding patients randomised to anifrolumab 150 mg (a total of 360 patients in the anifrolumab 300

BICLA Response 
As discussed above, BICLA response at Week 52 was initially designated a secondary endpoint for all 
key studies. When Study 05 failed on SRI(4) and favourable results were seen for BICLA, the applicant 
changed the endpoint hierarchy for Study 04 and designated BICLA response as its primary endpoint. 
BICLA response rates across the three studies are displayed in Table 17. In Study 04, BICLA response 
rate was 47.8% for anifrolumab 300 mg and 31.5% for placebo. In study 05, the response rates were 
47.1% for anifrolumab 300 mg and 30.2% for placebo. In the Phase II study 1013, BICLA response rates 
were  53.3%  for  anifrolumab  300  mg  and  25.1%  for  placebo.  Due  to  the  change  in  endpoints,  BICLA 
could only be formally tested in Study 04, and the difference in response rates of 16.3 percentage points 
(95% CI 6.3 to 26.3) was statistically significant with a p value of 0.001. In Study 05, the difference in 
response rates between anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo was 17.0 percentage points (95% CI 7.2 to 
26.8), and in Study 1013, the difference between anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo was 28.4 percentage 
points (95% CI 15.3 to 41.5); however, the statistical testing in Study 05 and Study 1013 was done 
outside of the confirmatory framework.

Sustained BICLA Response 
Since individual patients can transition between a responder and a non-responder status from one study 
visit to the next, the applicant was requested to provide analyses describing sustained responses over 
longer periods of time. A summary of the proportion of patients who achieved a sustained BICLA response 
through Week 52 is displayed in Figure 10 (the starting point for each treatment is the proportion of 
patients  with  a  Week  52  response,  and  e.g.  a  patient  who  responded  at  Week  4  and  maintained 
consecutive responses through Week 52 would be identified as having a sustained response for 13 visits). 
The proportion of BICLA responders at Week 52 with a sustained response duration of greater than or 
equal to 3, 6, 9, and 12 months is shown in Table 18.

SRI(4) Response 
The applicant initially selected SRI(4) response as the primary endpoint for all key studies. For Study 
1013, the primary analysis for SRI(4) response was at Week 24, and SRI(4) at Week 52 was a secondary 
endpoint. For studies 04 and 05, SRI(4) at Week 52 was the primary endpoint. When Study 05 failed on 
SRI(4), the endpoint hierarchy for Study 04 was changed, with SRI(4) being demoted to a secondary 
endpoint. 
SRI(4)  results  across  the  three  studies  are  displayed  in  Table  19.  Whereas  a  statistically  significant 
treatment effect had been seen in Study 1013, the difference between treatments was only marginal

and not statistically significant for Study 05; it should furthermore be noted that the results were even 
less favourable when using the original rules for restricted medications, with the difference in response 
rates favouring placebo (see Table 19). 
In stark contrast, a clear treatment effect favouring anifrolumab was seen in Study 04. The difference 
between the treatment groups was 18.2 percentage points (95% CI 8.1, 28.3) and associated with a 
nominal p value of <0.001; however, as SRI(4) had been demoted to a secondary endpoint in Study 04, 
it was tested outside of the confirmatory framework.

Additional sensitivity analyses 
Additional analyses were undertaken to evaluate the effect of intercurrent events on BICLA and SRI(4) 
response. As outlined above, there were 3 intercurrent events incorporated into endpoints in studies 04 
and 05: 
• 
IP discontinuation: a component of the primary estimand and refers to premature discontinuation 
of IP prior to the Week 48 visit. This event could be indicative of lack of efficacy or tolerability; 
therefore, the patient is deemed a non-responder from the time of this event onward. 
•  Restricted medication use: a component of the primary estimand and refers to use of restricted 
medications on or prior to the Week 52 visit. This event could be indicative of lack of efficacy; 
therefore, the patient is deemed a non-responder from the time of this event onward.

EMA/4079/2022

•  Study withdrawal: this event refers to situations for which no further data can be observed for a 
patient.  The  intercurrent  event  of  study  withdrawal  includes  (1)  premature  study  withdrawal 
(due to investigator or patient decision), (2) lost to follow-up, and (3) death prior to Week 52. 
This event marks the beginning of true missing data and therefore the patient is considered a 
non-responder from time of withdrawal onward. 
In studies 04 and 05, patients were encouraged to remain in the study even if they discontinued IP or 
restricted medication use occurred; therefore, data could continue to be observed after these events. 
Since the intercurrent event strategy only imputes non-response when an intercurrent event is observed, 
the impact of intercurrent events focused on reasons for non-response at Week 52. 
The impact assessment of non-responders followed a hierarchical flow: 
1.  Non-responders who prematurely withdrew from the study prior to Week 52 were deemed non-
responders due to study withdrawal since no clinical data are available to determine response 
status. 
2.  Non-responders  who  completed  through  Week  52  and  met  all  clinical  criteria  (responder  for 
BILAG-2004, SLEDAI-2000, and PGA) were deemed non-responders due to intercurrent events 
as follows: IP discontinuation only, restricted medication use only, or both IP discontinuation and 
restricted medication use. 
3.  Non-responders completing through Week 52 who did not meet all clinical criteria were deemed 
non-responders  due  to  the  clinical  criteria  not  met,  irrespective  of  intercurrent  events  of  IP 
discontinuation or restricted medication use, since failure to respond on all clinical criteria would 
result in non-response at Week 52 regardless of intercurrent event status. 
The  impact  of  intercurrent  events  was  assessed  based  on  imputation  of  non-response,  using  the 
treatment policy estimand which ignores the IP discontinuation and restricted medication use, and by 
performing a completers analysis in which the impact of IP discontinuation and premature withdrawal 
are removed by only assessing patients who completed the double-blind period on treatment. 
Since the impact assessment on non-responders and the non-response rate is different for BICLA and 
SRI(4), the impact for these endpoints was assessed separately. Study 1013 was not included in these 
impact assessments, as the study protocol did not continue to collect data for the double-blind treatment 
period once a patient used restricted medication or discontinued IP. 
Impact of Intercurrent Events on BICLA Response Status 
The impact of the intercurrent events on the BICLA response rates at Week 52 are presented for study 
04 and study 05 in Table 24.

Table 24 
Disposition of BICLA response at Week 52 (Study 04 and Study 05, full analysis sets) 
In studies 04 and 05, the key factors contributing to BICLA non-response across studies and treatment 
groups (listed in order of magnitude) were: 
•  No BILAG improvement 
•  Study withdrawal 
•  Restricted medication use 
In  study  04,  study  withdrawal  resulted  in  the  largest  difference  in  the  proportion  of  BICLA  non-
responders, with 20.3% of patients in the placebo group withdrawing from the study prior to Week 52 
compared with 10.0% of patients in the anifrolumab 300 mg group. Reasons for withdrawal in study 04 
occurring  in  a  higher  proportion  in  the  placebo  group  compared  with  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group 
included withdrawal by patient (9.2% vs 5.0%), adverse event (3.8% vs 1.7%), lack of efficacy (3.3% 
vs 0.6%), condition under investigation worsened (2.2% vs 0), lost to follow-up (1.1% vs 0.6%), and 
severe noncompliance to protocol (0.5% to 0). In the applicant’s opinion, this distribution of events is 
consistent  with  inadequate  treatment  effect  and/or  treatment-limiting  AEs.  The  only  reason  for 
withdrawal that affected a higher proportion of patients in the anifrolumab 300 mg group vs the placebo 
group was the category ‘other’, which occurred in 2.2% of anifrolumab-treated patients compared with 
0 placebo-treated patients. 
In study 05, the largest difference in the proportion of non-responders was due to clinical criteria not 
being met, with 46.2% of patients in the placebo group vs 29.4% in the anifrolumab 300 mg group. The 
Assessment report

proportions of non-responders due to study withdrawal or IP discontinuation/restricted medication use 
were similar between the treatment groups. 
Impact of Intercurrent Events on SRI(4) Response Status 
The impact of the intercurrent events on the SRI(4) response rates at Week 52 is presented for studies 
04 and 05 in Table 25. 
Table 25 
Disposition of SRI(4) response at Week 52 (Study 04 and Study 05, full analysis sets) 
Overall,  the  primary  factors  contributing  to  SRI(4)  non-response  across  both  studies  and  treatment 
groups (listed in order of magnitude) were: 
•  SLEDAI-2K reduction < 4 points 
•  Study withdrawal 
•  Restricted medication use 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022

In study 04, study withdrawal resulted in the largest difference in the proportion of non-responders, with 
20.3%  of  patients  in the placebo  group  withdrawing  from  the  study  prior  to Week  52  compared  with 
10.0% of patients in the anifrolumab 300 mg group. The reasons for study withdrawal are the same as 
that discussed above for the BICLA endpoint. 
In study 05, the largest difference in the proportion of non-responders was due to clinical criteria not 
being met, with 28.8% of patients in the placebo group vs 24.4% of patients in the anifrolumab 300 mg 
group. Proportions of non-responders due to study withdrawal or IP discontinuation/restricted medication 
use were similar between the treatment groups. 
Treatment Policy Estimand 
Sensitivity  analyses  excluding  the  use  of  restricted medication  and  discontinuation  of  IP  components, 
also  referred to  as  the  treatment  policy  estimand,  are  presented  for  key  endpoints  of  studies  04  and 
study 05. These modified endpoints used the 3 clinical disease activity components only, and patients 
with  missing  data  (e.g.,  due  to  study  withdrawal,  lost  to  follow-up,  or  death)  were  considered  non-
responders. 
The results of the treatment policy estimand for the key efficacy data are presented in Table 26.

Completers Analyses 
A sensitivity analysis for patients who completed Week 52 without prematurely discontinuing IP, referred 
to as a completers analysis, was performed for studies 04 and 05. This analysis removes the impact of 
IP discontinuation and premature study withdrawal while retaining the impact of restricted medication 
use (Table 27).

Tipping point analyses 
The  tipping  point  analyses  using  multiple  imputation  assuming  MNAR  are  presented  in  Figure  12  for 
BICLA response and Figure 13 for SRI(4) response. In the analyses, the probabilities of response within 
each treatment group are shifted by fixed amounts, where the “log odds shift” translate as adjustments 
to the chances that the outcome is imputed as a 1 (i.e., response). This is the factor by which the MAR 
predicted odds of a response is getting modified by the MNAR assumption – for example, if a patient had 
a  20%  probability  of  response  assuming  MAR,  a  shift  -0.6  in  the  log  odds  results  in  a  probability  of 
response  of  approximately  12%.  The estimand that most  closely  mirrors  the primary  estimand  is the 
one where the log odds shift is 0 for both anifrolumab and placebo. For BICLA, this corresponds to a 
treatment difference of 12.6% and 19.6%, for Studies 04 and 05, respectively. The tipping point analyses 
are largely consistent with the primary estimand tipping point analyses in that the BICLA response for 
both study 04 and 05 retain nominal significance for most combinations of favourable and unfavourable 
responses. Similarly, the analysis for SRI(4) is consistent with the primary estimands in both studies in 
that SRI(4) is nominally significant for nearly all combinations of responses in study 04 and does not 
achieve nominal significance for any combination of favourable and unfavourable responses in Study 05.

To  further  assess  the  impact  of  IP  discontinuation  on  treatment  response,  the  applicant  undertook  a 
detailed review of all patients discontinuing IP without prior restricted medication use. As seen in Table 
28, there were 41 placebo patients and 26 anifrolumab 300 mg patients prematurely discontinuing IP 
without  evidence  of  restricted  medication  use  prior  to  IP  discontinuation  in  Study  04,  and  31  such 
patients in each treatment arm in Study 05.

Table 28 
Patients who discontinued IP: Study 04 and Study 05 
The  applicant  then  analysed  the  reasons  for  discontinuing  IP  in  patients  without  prior  restricted 
medication  use  using  information  recorded  on  the  eCRF  as  the  reason  for  IP  discontinuation.  The 
worsening  components  of  the  BICLA  and  SRI  endpoints  at  the  last  assessment  on  or  before  IP 
discontinuation were also summarised to provide an objective measure of lack of efficacy in this subset 
of patients which show that 64.5% to 73.1% of patients had worsening of at least one clinical criterion 
when IP was discontinued (Table 29). In addition, a blinded review of patient profiles for all patients who 
discontinued  IP  for  reasons  other  than  reported  as  “lack  of  efficacy”  or  “worsening  of  disease”  was 
performed by an internal applicant physician using a structured approach with predefined criteria. The 
reason  for  IP  discontinuation  was  classified  as  “lack  of  efficacy  related”  only  if  objective  measures  of 
persistent or increased disease activity at time of IP discontinuation compared with baseline activity was 
evident upon review of SLEDAI-2K, BILAG-2004, and PGA scores. IP discontinuations were considered 
not to be efficacy related if a patient discontinued IP due to lost to follow-up, noncompliance with study 
procedures, pregnancy/wished to become pregnant or if the reason was reported as “other” without any 
further details reported in the eCRFs. Patients who discontinued due to an AE were only considered to 
have discontinued for efficacy reason if the reported AE term clearly indicated SLE worsening/flare. 
Based on the physician’s blinded review, patients treated with placebo were more likely to discontinue 
IP due to efficacy-related reasons than anifrolumab-treated patients (46.3% vs 15.4% for Study 04 and 
71.0% vs 25.8% in study 05) (Table 29). According to the applicant, these results indicate that among 
patients  who  prematurely  discontinued  IP  during  the  studies,  more  patients  in  the  placebo  group 
compared with the anifrolumab group used restricted medications prior to IP discontinuation and, among 
those  without  prior  use  of  restricted  medications,  more  placebo-treated  patients  discontinued  IP  with 
evidence  of  lack  of  efficacy  compared  with  anifrolumab,  suggesting  that  the  imbalance  in  IP 
discontinuations in study 04 was related to a treatment effect and not a random occurrence.

Reasons for IP discontinuation and relation to efficacy, for patients who discontinued IP 
Tipping  point  analyses  for  BICLA  and  SRI(4),  detailing  all  possible  combinations  of  imputed 
response/nonresponse for IP discontinuation by treatment arm, are illustrated in Figure 14. These tipping 
point  analyses  were  performed  for  the  composite  estimand  where  patients  with  prior  restricted 
medication  use  or  documented  evidence  that  IP  discontinuation  was  related  to  lack  of  efficacy  were 
imputed as non-responders, and patients who prematurely discontinued IP without documented evidence 
of lack of efficacy or prior restricted medication use were evaluated using all possible combinations of 
responders/non-responders.  As  outlined  above,  in  Study  04,  41  placebo  patients  and  26  anifrolumab 
300 mg patients prematurely discontinued IP without evidence of restricted medication use prior to IP 
discontinuation. For BICLA, the nominal p-values tipped from < 0.05 to ≥ 0.05 when a net gain of 12 or 
more  placebo-treated  patients  were  imputed  as  BICLA  responders  relative  to  anifrolumab-treated 
patients,  which  corresponds  to  a  treatment  difference  around  10%.  Specifically,  when  the  number  of 
responders  imputed  for  premature  IP  discontinuations  for  placebo  (y)  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  the 
number of responders imputed for anifrolumab (x) plus 12, then the nominal p-value is ≥ 0.05 (e.g., y ≥ 
x + 12). In Study 05, 31 patients in each treatment arm prematurely discontinued IP without evidence 
of restricted medication use prior to IP discontinuation; the tipping point occurs for BICLA when there is 
a  net  gain  of  13  more  responders  imputed  for  placebo  than  for  anifrolumab  (e.g.,  y  ≥  x  +  13)  and 
corresponds to a treatment difference around 10%. Additionally for Study 05, the treatment difference 
is always > 0 and once the imputation reaches ≥ 19 anifrolumab-treated patients imputed as responders, 
all values of responders imputed for placebo result in a nominal p-value < 0.05. 
For  SRI(4)  in  study  04,  the  tipping  point  is  reached  when  15  or  more  placebo-treated  patients  are 
imputed as SRI(4) responders relative to anifrolumab-treated patients. In Study 05 which did not achieve 
statistical significance with the SRI(4) primary estimand, the SRI(4) response tips to a nominal p-value

<  0.05  when  there  is  a  net  gain  of  8  anifrolumab-treated  patients  imputed  as  responders  relative  to 
placebo.  
In study 04, the baseline scenario (anifrolumab 0 additional responders, placebo 0 additional responders; 
i.e., no changes in assumed status) yields a delta of 16.5%, with an associated p value of 0.001. To 
illustrate  the  substantial  effect  of  various  assumptions  on  the  estimated  treatment  difference,  a  few 
alternative  scenarios  are provided  below.  The  numbers  refer  to patients  who  discontinued  IP  and  are 
assumed BICLA responders: 
•  Anifrolumab: 0 responders, placebo 10 responders -> delta 11.0%, p-value 0.035 
•  Anifrolumab: 0 responders, placebo 12 responders -> delta 9.9%, p-value 0.058 
•  Anifrolumab: 2 responders, placebo 12 responders -> delta 11.0%, p-value 0.035 
•  Anifrolumab: 2 responders, placebo 15 responders -> delta 9.3%, p-value 0.074

The applicant highlighted other specific scenarios that can be considered in the tipping point analyses. 
In Table 30, the first row shows the primary estimand which assumes that all IP discontinuations are 
non-responders. For the second and third rows, response rates were assigned to the subgroup of patients 
who were considered to discontinue IP for a reason that was not related to lack of efficacy (see bottom 
row of Table 29). Thus, the second row assumes all such IP discontinuations are responders, and the 
third  row  applies  the  BICLA  response  rate  by  treatment  group  from  the  completers  analysis.  The 
treatment differences for all 3 analyses range from 16.3 % to 17.6 % (nominal p-values ≤ 0.002) for 
Study 04 and range from 17.0 % to 25.2 % (nominal p-values < 0.001) for Study 05.

Individual BILAG-2004 and SLEDAI-2K domains 
BILAG-2004 or SLEDAI-2K improvement responses were pre-specified secondary endpoints in studies 
04, 05, and 1013. A BILAG-2004 improvement response is defined as the transitioning from BILAG-2004 
A or B at baseline to a lower score at Week 52. A SLEDAI-2K improvement response is defined as an 
organ system score at Week 52 that is less than the corresponding score at baseline. 
Patients  treated  with  restricted  medication  beyond  protocol-allowed  threshold,  and  those  who 
discontinued  investigational  product,  were  regarded  as  non-responders.  For  both  BILAG-2004  and 
SLEDAI-2K most patients had moderate or severe activity in the musculoskeletal and/or mucocutaneous 
organ  domains  at  baseline,  with  lesser  involvement  in  other  organ  domains  (for  SLEDAI-2K,  the 
immunology  domain  was  also  well  represented);  there  were  similar  distributions  of  baseline  organ 
involvement  across  the  3  studies.  Improvement  on  individual  BILAG-2004  domains  in  the  Phase  III 
studies is displayed in Figure 15, and improvement on SLEDAI-2K domains is displayed in Figure 16.

Patient responder status for SRI[4] and BICLA in Study 04, Study 05, and Study 1013 
The  degree  of  agreement  between  each  outcome  was  assessed  as  the  proportion  of  patients  with 
concordant results (calculated as the number of patients with agreement of response divided by the total 
number  of  patients).  Cohen’s  Kappa  coefficient  was  used  to  evaluate  the  degree  of  concordance  or 
reliability between the 2 endpoints. The majority of patients in all 3 studies (approximately 75% to 85%) 
had concordant outcomes on SRI(4) and BICLA (i.e., responders on both, or non-responders on both). 
The Cohen’s Kappa analysis suggested a moderate to substantial agreement (0.6 to 0.7) between the 
outcomes (nominal p-value: < 0.001). The proportion of patients who had both a BICLA response and a 
SRI[4] response at Week 52 was higher in the anifrolumab 300 mg group compared with the placebo 
group, with treatment differences ranging from 14.3% and 28.6% across the studies (Table 31).

According  to  the  applicant,  the  discordant  results  could  be  explained  by  a  subset  of  SRI[4] 
responder/BICLA  non-responder  patients  in  study  05  (n=28  vs.  n=12),  with  the  treatment  difference 
within this subset contributing a net of -8.5% percentage points to the overall SRI(4) treatment effect 
(6.7% - 15.2% = -8.5%; Figure 19; burgundy). In study 04, the number of patients in each treatment 
group  in  the  SRI(4)  responder/BICLA  nonresponder  subset  was  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  (22 
patients on anifrolumab vs. 20 patients on placebo), with the treatment difference contributing only a 
net +1.2 percentage points to the overall SRI(4) treatment difference in the study. 
A summary of reasons for being a SRI(4) responder/BICLA non-responder is presented in Table 32.  
In the SRI(4) responder/BICLA non-responder subset in study 05, a high proportion of patients in the 
placebo group achieved resolution of arthritis, which alone meets the 4-point reduction in SLEDAI-2K 
required for a SRI(4) response. In the anifrolumab 300 mg group in this subset, the reasons were more 
varied. In Study 04, a similar pattern was not seen. In both studies, the most frequent combination of a 
SRI(4)  response/BICLA  nonresponse  discordance  in  this  subgroup  was  SRI  response  due  to 
arthritis/BICLA nonresponse due to rash. It should furthermore be noted that in this subgroup overall, 
the  most  common  reason  for  BICLA  nonresponse  in  both  studies  and  both  treatment  groups  was 
nonresponse due to rash / skin eruption (ranging from 60% to 86%).

Overview of reasons for a SRI response and BICLA non-response at Week 52 (SRI[4] 
When comparing the baseline characteristics between the studies, some potential differences could be 
seen, with an overall slightly lesser joint involvement in study 04; the pattern of OCS use and tapering 
was also slightly different between the studies. However, no definitive underlying reason for the unique 
discordance pattern in study 05 could be identified. 
Maintained OCS tapering

equivalent by Week 40 and maintain it to Week 52 was analysed as a key secondary endpoint in studies

The CLASI score was used to evaluate the effect of anifrolumab on inflammatory cutaneous SLE lesions.  
A CLASI responder was defined as ≥ 50% reduction in CLASI activity score at Week 12 among patients 
with at least moderately active skin disease (CLASI ≥ 10) at baseline. The results are displayed in Table

Week 52.Whereas a 19% difference between anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo had been observed on a 
corresponding  joint  response  in  Study  05,  there  was  no  difference  between  anifrolumab  300  mg  and 
placebo in joint response in Study 04 (difference 4.7%, 95% CI -10.6, 20.0). 
Disease flares 
Numerical trends  favouring  anifrolumab  300  mg  over  placebo  were  seen on annual  flare  rates  (Table 
36).  However,  none  of  the  differences  were  statistically  significant,  with  Study  04  failing  due  to  the 
multiplicity-controlled testing strategy.

In addition to SRI(4), higher level reductions in SLEDAI-2K thresholds (SLEDAI-2K ≥ 5 through ≥ 8) were 
calculated for the SRI responder analysis at Week 52 and analysed as secondary endpoints. Results for 
SRI(6), SRI(7) and SRI(8) in studies 04 and 05 are displayed in Table 37.

Patient-reported outcomes 
FACIT-fatigue was used to evaluate the effect of anifrolumab on fatigue, which is often a very prominent 
and  disabling  manifestation  of  SLE.  On  average,  patients  had  severe  fatigue  at  baseline,  with  mean 
FACIT-F scores between 24.5 and 27.0 out of a maximum scale score of 52 points across the studies 
and treatment groups. As seen in Table 38, small numerical trends favouring anifrolumab were observed 
in studies 04 and 05.

Immunology/Serology (anti-dsDNA; C3; C4) 
Anti-dsDNA positivity was detected in 44.4% of patients in the phase III pool. At baseline, median levels 
of  anti-dsDNA  were  50.1  U/mL  and  53.0  U/mL,  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  and  placebo  groups, 
respectively. 
Among patients with positive anti-dsDNA at baseline in the phase III pool, median change from baseline 
to Week 52 in anti-dsDNA antibody levels was -14.82 U/mL in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and -5.37 
U/mL in the placebo group. In patients with anti-dsDNA antibodies at baseline, 7.8% of patients treated 
with anifrolumab 300 mg and 5.8% of patients receiving placebo had converted to anti-dsDNA negative 
by Week 52 in the phase III pool. 
In the phase III pool, 36.8% of patients had low/abnormal complement C3 levels at baseline. At baseline, 
mean levels of C3 were 0.691 g/L in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and 0.701 g/L. For patients with an 
abnormal C3 level at baseline, mean change from baseline to Week 52 in C3 levels was 0.13 g/L in the 
anifrolumab 300 mg group and 0.04 g/L in the placebo group in the phase III pool. Among patients with 
low/abnormal complement levels at baseline, normalisation of C3 was observed at Week 52 in 16.2% of 
patients receiving anifrolumab and in 9.5% of patients receiving placebo in the phase III pool. 
In addition, 23.3% of patients in the phase III pool had low/abnormal C4 levels at baseline. At baseline, 
mean levels of C4 were 0.073 g/L in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and 0.072 g/L in the placebo group. 
For patients with an abnormal C4 level at baseline, similar small increases were observed over the 52 
weeks in both treatment groups (mean change from baseline of 0.02 g/L for anifrolumab vs. 0.02 g/L 
for  placebo  at  Week  52  in  the  phase  III  pool).  In  patients  with  low/abnormal  complement  levels  at

baseline, normalisation of C4 was observed at Week 52 in 22.6% of patients receiving anifrolumab and 
in 7.1% of patients receiving placebo in the phase III pool. 
Ancillary analyses 
Analysis of BICLA response by IFN gene signature 
To evaluate the role of the IFN gene signature as a potential predictor of treatment response, the BICLA 
response at Week 52 was analysed in the respective subgroups on pooled Phase III data; response in 
the  IFN  gene  signature  -  high  subgroup  was  designated  a  key  secondary  endpoint  in  Study  04  and 
evaluated as an exploratory endpoint in studies 05 and 1013. The results are outlined in Figure 20. As 
the  responder  rates  for  anifrolumab  300  mg  were  similar  across  all  patients  (the  smaller  treatment 
difference in test-low patients being due to a higher placebo response rate), the applicant considers that 
the totality of data in the Phase III pool supports that type I IFN gene signature test-low patients may 
also benefit from anifrolumab treatment. Consequently, the test is not included as part of the applicant’s 
proposed indication in the SmPC.

Note that the primary endpoint in study 1013 was SRI(4) response with OCS tapering at Week 24. In order to 
assess the effect of anifrolumab on overall disease activity out to Week 52 in this application, and to align with 
the  endpoints  used  to  assess  this  in studies  04  and 05,  data  on  BICLA  and SRI(4) response  at  Week  52  are 
presented for study 1013. 
Analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel approach. 
Based  on  the  pre-specified  logistic  regression  model  for  comparison  of  anifrolumab  300  mg  versus  placebo,

2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant has sought a marketing authorisation for anifrolumab 300 mg Q4W IV as “add on therapy 
for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  systemic  lupus  erythematosus,  despite 
standard therapy”. 
The goal of SLE treatment is to achieve a clinically meaningful reduction of overall disease activity and 
the rate of disease flares, while at the same time reducing steroid use in order to avoid additional long-
term organ damage. 
The  key  studies  within  the  clinical  development  programme  for  anifrolumab  comprise  two  Phase  III 
studies  and  a  large  Phase  II  study.  All  three  studies  had  a  52-week  double-blind  placebo-controlled 
treatment period and were generally similar in design. The CHMP Guideline on clinical investigation of 
medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  and  lupus  nephritis 
(EMA/CHMP/51230/2013 corr) states that the duration of a trial aimed for the control of disease activity 
should be at least 12 months; within the application, 12 month efficacy data is provided for the three 
key studies. The ongoing Study 09 will assess efficacy over a 3 year double blind treatment period.  
The primary objective in all 3 studies was to evaluate the effect of anifrolumab compared to placebo on 
overall disease activity. Secondary objectives were chosen to further characterise the reduction in overall 
disease  activity,  in  particular  the  ability  to  reduce  OCS  use,  the  effect  on  organ-specific  endpoints 
(cutaneous SLE activity and joints), and flare rates. 
Contrary to CHMP advice, the applicant selected to enroll paediatric-onset SLE patients in studies 04 and 
05. In its response to the D120 LoQ, the applicant described the measures to mitigate risks from enrolling 
a significantly diverging subpopulation into the studies. The CHMP agreed that the small subgroup with 
paediatric-onset disease does not appear to strikingly differ from the adult-onset subgroup in terms of 
baseline  characteristics.  The  small  sample  size  limits  the  robustness  of  the  subgroup  analysis  for

treatment response, but whereas the absolute response rates for both anifrolumab and placebo are lower 
among paediatric-onset patients, the differences between treatment groups appear to be similar among 
paediatric-onset  and  adult-onset  patients.  Specific  restrictions  regarding  the  use  of  anifrolumab  in 
paediatric-onset SLE patients are not deemed necessary by the CHMP. 
Similar  eligibility  criteria  were  applied  across  the  three  studies.  The  minimum  SLEDAI-2K  and  BILAG 
criteria are overall appropriate to select a population with active disease of at least moderate severity. 
The 1997 ACR classification criteria for diagnosis of SLE were used in the studies. This is reflected in the 
Section  5.1  of  the  SmPC.  The  applicant  also  confirmed  that  patients  who  were  positive  for  anti-
phospholipid antibodies were included in the Phase III studies. In the pooled population, 18% (131/726) 
of  patients  were  positive  for  anti-phospholipid  antibodies  with  similar  proportions  observed  between 
treatment groups, ranging from 12.6% to 25.0% of patients. It was also confirmed that over 98% of 
patients participating in the studies also met the 2019 EULAR/ACR  classification criteria for SLE, with 
very high concordance demonstrated between the two classification systems. 
Exclusion criteria reflect the main potential safety concerns related to the mechanism of action of the 
drug and this is acceptable. Patients with severe neuropsychiatric or renal manifestations of SLE were 
excluded from the programme; this exclusion is adequately reflected in Section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Rules were established for restricted medications so that overall standard of care treatment remained 
stable throughout all 3 studies (04, 05, 1013), except for OCS that were tapered according to specific 
instructions (mandated in studies 04 and 05 as recommended in the CHMP Guideline and encouraged in 
study 1013) in view of the fact that an important clinical (efficacy and safety) achievement in SLE patients 
is obtaining and maintaining a lower disease activity and steroid tapering (low doses/without). The wash 
out period required for prohibited medications before study drug was started is acceptable. Concomitant 
use of other biological therapies for SLE (such as belimumab) was prohibited. A corresponding warning 
has been added in Section 4.4 of the SmPC at the CHMP’s request. 
The dose proposed for labelling, 300 mg Q4W, was included in all three studies and is the focus of the 
current assessment.  
The heterogeneity and complexity of SLE makes it difficult to evaluate the efficacy of experimental drugs 
for SLE treatment, and composite endpoints are often used to evaluate disease activity across multiple 
organ systems. The selected primary and secondary endpoints are in accordance with the “Guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus 
nephritis (EMA/CHMP/51230/2015)”. According to the Guideline, the selection of the primary endpoint 
in SLE trials depends on the objective of the clinical study and should be generally aimed at the control 
of  disease  activity  and/or  prevention  of  long-term  damage.  Given  the  heterogeneity  of  SLE 
manifestations,  supportive  evidence  derived  from  secondary  endpoints  is  of  particular  interest  in  this 
clinical setting to fully characterise the treatment effect. 
Both BICLA and SRI(4) are endorsed as potential primary endpoints in the CHMP Guideline for SLE. At 
face value, many elements within both BICLA and SRI(4) response refer to “no worsening” rather than 
definite “improvement”. BILAG classifies the severity of each organ system as A (severe), B (moderate), 
C (mild), or D (inactive) semi-quantitatively and detects changes in severity of clinical manifestations 
reflecting disease activity over the last 4 weeks. The BILAG system is comprehensive but complicated. 
The  weakness  of  BILAG  is  that  does  not  contain  serological  evaluation  (K.  Ohmura.  Modern 
Rheumatology, 2021). On the other hand, SRI(4) captures treatment benefit across SLEDAI-2K defined 
organ systems, where assessment of symptoms within a given system is dichotomous (present/absent) 
and differential weighting assigned to different organ systems. SLEDAI-2K assessment can be translated 
to a numeric score ranging from 0 to 105, with SRI(4) response requiring a 4 point improvement from 
baseline in total score. It is noteworthy that while the scale in principle ranges from 0 to 105, individual 
scores above 20 are rare. Of note, a clinically meaningful improvement i.e. reduction in SLEDAI-2K of 4

points (Gladman 2000) is only recorded on complete resolution of a disease manifestation and it cannot 
evaluate  improvement.  This  represents  a  weak  point  of  SLEDAI  score  (K.  Ohmura.  Modern 
Rheumatology, 2021). 
The addition of key secondary endpoints which are meant to assess organ specific disease activity on 
some common SLE features i.e. skin and joint are of importance for gaining information about clinical 
efficacy that is not otherwise properly captured by some composite/more general endpoint. Inclusion of 
flares is of importance since it correlates with long term damage, affecting in turn survival and health-
related QoL. 
While both BICLA and SRI(4) are considered acceptable endpoints according to the Guideline, no single 
measure  has  yet  been  validated  as  the  gold  standard.  The  limitations  of  currently  available  efficacy 
measures  are  also  recognised  in  current  scientific  literature  and  have  been  implicated  as  a  potential 
reason for the numerous failures in therapeutic trials in SLE (Arora et al, Arth Care Res 2020; 72 No. 
S10: 27–46). 
The applicant initially chose SRI(4) as the primary endpoint for the anifrolumab programme based on its 
previous use in the belimumab programme as well as favourable data in Study 1013. However, the first 
Phase  III  study  (Study  05)  did  not  meet  this  primary  endpoint.  Based  on  efficacy  being  observed  on 
BICLA in Study 05, the applicant subsequently changed the primary endpoint for Study 04 from SRI(4) 
to BICLA while that study was still blinded. 
Whereas  a  data-driven  change  in  primary  endpoint  during  a  clinical  programme  can  be  considered 
suboptimal from the perspective of GCP principles and statistical inference, the change process has been 
described  in  detail  within the  application.  The  measures  taken  by  the  applicant  during  the  process  to 
protect the integrity of data collected in Study 04 were generally considered procedurally adequate by 
the CHMP. As end-of-study notifications for Study 04 had already been submitted in the EU; hence, the 
applicant could not notify health authorities in the EU of the endpoint change. However, based on the 
submitted  documentation,  no  significant  concern  regarding  potential  breach  of  data  integrity  can  be 
identified. One study site was closed due to sustained protocol non-compliance. 
In principle, two consistent pivotal studies would be strongly preferred from a regulatory perspective to 
allow an adequate assessment of efficacy in an indication like SLE and this was also the original intention 
of  this  development  programme.  With  the  submission  being  formally  based  on  one  positive  Phase  II 
study, one negative Phase III study and one Phase III study in which the testing strategy, including the 
primary endpoint, was fully changed as a result of the failed study, the overall statistical approach cannot 
be considered to provide confirmatory evidence of efficacy based on conventional standards.  
Among  the  secondary  endpoints  assessed,  decrease  in  steroid  use  and  prevention  of  flares  are 
recognised concepts within the CHMP Guideline; furthermore, the assessment of effects on cutaneous 
symptoms was endorsed in the CHMP SA process. The OCS tapering target (to ≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone 
equivalent  for  any  patient  with  ≥  10  mg/day  at  baseline)  sets the  minimum threshold of  a  successful 
taper slightly lower than in the Guideline example, in which a taper from 15 mg/day to ≤ 7.5 mg/day is 
provided. However, the target dose of ≤ 7.5 mg/day is in itself consistent with EULAR recommendations. 
The  assessment  of  joint  symptoms  in  SLE  is  less  well  established,  and  it  is  noted  that  responder 
definitions were adjusted during the programme and joint assessments were escalated in the statistical 
analysis hierarchy for Study 04 after data from studies 1013 and 05 was available. As such, this endpoint 
can overall be only considered as exploratory in nature. 
The studies included 180 patients in the active arms. The applicant states that the number of patients 
in the study is based on adequate size of the safety database. For the primary endpoint, the study is 
considered to have >80% power. 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022

When the primary endpoint for Study 04 was changed, the applicant conducted a power calculation for 
the new primary endpoint and confirmed there was adequate powered based on the effect size seen in 
Study 05. The number of patients in the study was not changed. 
The plans to control Type 1 error are methodologically adequate as such. However, due to the changes 
implemented  when  Study  04  was  ongoing  and  differences  between  the  two  studies,  the  CHMP 
assessment has been focused on the totality of evidence rather than confirmatory testing. 
Study 1013 was conducted between January 2012 and April 2015. First patient for Study 05 was enrolled 
on 09 June 2015, and last subject last visit took place on 17 July 2018. First patient for Study 04 was 
enrolled on 09 July 2015, and last subject last visit took place on 06 December 2018. 
A total of 1124 patients received investigational product in the three key studies; 459 patients received 
anifrolumab at the 300 mg Q4W dosage. Some 80% of patients in all studies completed 52 weeks of 
treatment. 
In Study 05, the proportions of patients completing treatment with investigational product and placebo 
were  very  similar,  about  80%  across  the  three  treatment  groups.  The  most common  reasons  for  not 
completing treatment were patient decision (8.3% for anifrolumab 300 mg, 5.4% for anifrolumab 150 
mg, 7.1% for placebo), adverse events (7.2% for anifrolumab 300 mg, 6.5% for anifrolumab 150 mg, 
4.3% for placebo), and lack of efficacy (1.7% for anifrolumab 300 mg, 3.2% for anifrolumab 150 mg, 
4.9% for placebo). 
In contrast, in studies 04 and 1013, the proportion of patients completing treatment was higher with 
anifrolumab than placebo (Study 04: 85% for anifrolumab vs. 71% for placebo; Study 1013: 84% for 
anifrolumab 300 mg, 82% for anifrolumab 1000 mg, 75% for placebo). 
In  Study  04,  the  most  common  reasons  for  withdrawal  were  patient  decision  (3.9%  for  anifrolumab, 
8.8% for placebo), adverse events (2.8% for anifrolumab, 7.7% for placebo), and lack of efficacy (1.1% 
for  anifrolumab,  6.6%  for  placebo).  The  imbalance  between  treatment  groups  in  study  withdrawals 
carries particular relevance for the efficacy analysis, as all of the withdrawals are interpreted as non-
responders in the applicant’s primary analysis (see below). 
In  Study  1013,  the  reasons  for  non-completion  were  categorised  in  a  slightly  different  manner.  The 
reason  for non-completion  was  withdrawal  of  consent  in  7.2% of  patients  (3.0%  for  anifrolumab  300 
mg,  7.7%  for  anifrolumab  1000  mg,  10.7%  for  placebo);  other  reasons  were  reported  for  9.8%  of 
patients (11.0% for anifrolumab 300 mg, 7.7% for anifrolumab 1000 mg, 10.7% for placebo). According 
to the applicant, discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was not recorded separately. An adverse event 
was  reported  as  the  reason  for  discontinuation  in  1  patient  in  each  of  the  anifrolumab  groups  and  2 
patients on placebo. 
Within  each  of  the  three  studies,  demographic  characteristics  between  the  treatment  groups  were 
balanced. Across the studies, mean age was about 40 years and over 90% patients were female. When 
comparing  the  three  studies,  the  higher  proportion  of  European  patients  in  Study  05,  the  higher 
proportion of Asian patients in Study 04 (this was the only study including patients from Japan), as well 
as the substantial mestizo/mestiza population in Study 1013 were noted by the CHMP. 
About 70% of patients in studies 04 and 05, and 60% of patients in Study 1013 had a baseline SLEDAI-
2K score of 10 or above, consistent with high disease activity. Disease activity based on SLEDAI-2K was 
balanced between treatment arms. On the BILAG-2004 index, about 45-50% of patients across the three 
studies had at least one BILAG A, indicating severe disease in at least one organ system. In Study 04, a 
slight imbalance is noted (45% anifrolumab and 52% placebo) meaning higher activity in the placebo 
arm; in Study 05, at least one BILAG A was reported in 52% of patients on anifrolumab 300 mg and 
46% of patients on placebo. Median time from first diagnosis to randomisation ranged from 65 to 94 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 133/198 
 
 
 
months. About 93% of patients enrolled into the Phase III studies had adult-onset SLE. Baseline disease 
characteristics were generally well balanced between treatment groups.  
The 4-gene type I IFN gene signature high was detected in the great majority of enrolled patients across 
studies (more than 80% in studies 04 and 05), making it difficult to discriminate potential differences in 
the efficacy of anifrolumab between patients with high and low type I IFN gene signature. A comparison 
of baseline data between patients with high and low type I IFN gene signature pointed to generally higher 
disease  activity  (based  e.g.  on  serological  markers  and  skin  symptomatology)  among  patients  with  a 
high  gene  signature,  the  main  difference  being  greater  serological  abnormalities  in  type  I  IFN  gene 
signature  high  patients:  positive  anti-dsDNA  antibodies  (47.8%  versus  27.8%),  and  abnormal 
complement C3 (41.5% versus 14.3%) or C4 (27.0% versus 5.6%). The exception to this general finding 
was greater joint involvement among patients with low type I IFN gene signature. 
Based on the BILAG-2004 index, the most frequently affected organ systems were mucocutaneous and 
musculoskeletal; these were also the only organ systems with substantial numbers of BILAG A severity. 
These finding are consistent with the majority of patients having dermatological involvement, based on 
a  median  CLASI  score  of  5  to  6  and  20-30%  of  patients  having  a  CLASI  score  of  10  or  higher.  Most 
patients also had active joint involvement, with median active joint counts ranging from 4 to 6 in the 
phase  III  studies.  Neuropsychiatric,  gastrointestinal,  ophthalmic  and  haematological  symptomatology 
was infrequent. Autoantibody (ANA, Anti-dsDNA or anti-Sm) positivity, an eligibility requirement, was 
most commonly in relation to ANA. Therefore, a moderate to severe disease activity according to BILAG 
for organ specific involvement denotes a SLE population with moderate to severe disease activity that is 
rather restricted to a few clinical manifestations (musculoskeletal and mucocutaneous) only. The reason 
for not including patients with active nephritis or CNS involvement in the Phase III trials seems justified 
as these patients require a different treatment for the control of disease activity; however, restriction 
makes difficult to draw conclusions on the effect of anifrolumab on key target organs, although it can be 
agreed that a dominance of mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal organ domains is also present in the 
wider general  population of patients with moderate to severe SLE despite SOC. 
Some  80%  of  patients  across  the  three  studies  were  on  OCS  at  baseline.  Among  these  patients,  the 
proportion of patients with a daily dose ≥ 10 mg was 46 to 48% in Study 04, 55 to 57% in Study 05 and 
56 to 63% in Study 1013. Anti-malarials were used by 66 to 77% of patients, and in studies 04 and 05, 
57 
to  63%  were 
taking  anti-malarials 
together  with  OCS  and/or 
immunosuppressants. 
Immunosuppressants were used by 45 to 52% of patients across the three studies. In Study 04, the 
proportion of patients who were only receiving an OCS at baseline was slightly higher in the anifrolumab 
300 mg group than the placebo group (31 patients (17.2%) in the anifrolumab 300 mg group vs. 17 
patients (9.3%) in the placebo group). Regarding the claimed indication, the applicant has clarified its 
position and provided efficacy and safety data supporting the view that no detrimental effect seems to 
be seen in biologic experienced patients compared to biologic naive ones. However, since concomitant 
use of other biologicals was prohibited, a warning was included at the CHMP’s request in Section 4.4 of 
the SmPC to inform prescribers that anifrolumab has not been studied in combination with other biologic 
therapies,  including  B-cell-targeted  therapies.  Therefore,  treatment  with  anifrolumab  is  not 
recommended in combination with biologic therapies. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A difference in response rates based on the BICLA composite was consistently observed across the three 
key  studies.  Between  studies  04  and  05,  the  observed  response  rates  for  anifrolumab  300  mg  and 
placebo (Study 04: 47.8% vs. 31.5%; Study 05: 47.1% vs. 30.2%) as well as the differences in response 
rates between groups (Study 04, 16.3 percentage points; Study 05, 17.0 percentage points), using the 
applicant’s primary composite estimand, were very consistent. For Study 05, it should be noted that as 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 134/198 
 
 
 
the study failed on the primary endpoint of SRI(4) response, p values for key secondary endpoints cannot 
be  formally  interpreted  due  to  the  analysis  hierarchy.  A  larger  treatment  effect  (28.4%  difference  in 
response rates between treatment groups) was seen in the Phase II study 1013. 
In study 04, a numerical separation of the BICLA response rates in favour of anifrolumab was seen early 
(starting at week 8) and was sustained until week 52; this behavior is similar across studies. Moreover, 
a numerically higher percentage of anifrolumab-treated patients achieved a sustained BICLA response 
at week 52 (the visit of first BICLA response that is sustained up to, and including, Week 52: HR 1.55 
(95% CI 1.1-2.18)). Comparison across studies shows higher HRs of 1.94 (95% CI 1.38-2.73) and 2.51 
(95% CI 1.56-4.16) for 05 and 1013 study, respectively. From a clinical perspective, achievement of a 
sustained  BICLA  response  rate  is  of  value  and  a  numerical  trend  in  favour  of  anifrolumab  gives 
reassurance.  At  the  CHMP’s  request,  the  applicant  conducted  additional  analyses  regarding  sustained 
responses  which  demonstrated  a  higher  response  rate  with  anifrolumab  that  remained  stable  over 
different periods of time; as an example, among Week 52 responders, a response that was sustained for 
at least 6 months was achieved by 24.4% of patients on anifrolumab vs. 12.6% of patients on placebo 
in study 04, and by 30.0% of patients on anifrolumab vs. 17.4% of patients on placebo in study 05. 
The  lower  bound  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  was  only  6%  and  7%,  in  study  04  and  05 
respectively, and increases to almost 10% (CI 9.7-23.6) in the pooled analysis, indicating limited efficacy 
(with  <10%  being  considered  not  clinically  meaningful,  as  stated  by  the  applicant).  At  the  CHMP’s 
request,  the  applicant  also  provided  additional  analyses  on  study  04:  using  the  treatment  policy 
estimand, the difference is 10.9% (95% CI 0.7, 21.1), and in the completers analysis, the difference is 
11.4% (95% CI -0.1, 23.0). Lastly, the proportions of patients failing to improve on BILAG-2004 are 
32.2% on anifrolumab and 34.6% on placebo (i.e., a difference of 2.4 percentage points). 
The study 05 failed on the primary endpoint of SRI(4) response. Discordant numeric results between the 
Phase III studies are observed on this endpoint which was initially envisaged as the primary endpoint 
for  the  programme.  Indeed,  the  SRI(4)  response  at  Week  52,  anifrolumab  300  mg  vs.  placebo  was 
55.5% vs. 37.3%; difference 18.2% (95% CI 8.1, 28.3) in Study 04  (secondary endpoint), 49.0% vs. 
43.0%;  difference  6.0%  (95%  CI  -4.2,  16.2)  in  Study  05  (primary  endpoint)  and  62.8%  vs.  38.8%; 
difference 24.0% (95% CI 10.9, 37.2) in Study 1013 (secondary endpoint).   
For  a  better  understanding  of  the  relationship  of  the  two  endpoints,  the  applicant  was  requested  to 
provide a summary of how the BICLA and SRI(4) responses correlate on an individual patient level within 
each  key  study.  The  analysis  demonstrated  concordant  outcomes  on  BICLA  and  SRI(4)  in  the  large 
majority  (75-85%)  of  cases,  which  is  in  itself  reassuring  and  confirms  that  the  two  endpoints  do  not 
measure clearly different aspects of the same condition. The proportionally largest discordant category 
was  BICLA  non-response  /  SRI(4)  response,  and  whereas  BICLA  response  /  SRI(4)  non-response 
discordance was observed at relatively constant frequencies in both treatment groups across all studies, 
and the same is true for BICLA non-response / SRI(4) response discordance in studies 04 and 1013, an 
imbalance between treatment groups was seen for BICLA non-response / SRI(4) response in study 05, 
with fewer patients in the anifrolumab group than the placebo group in this subset. A definitive reason 
for failure of the pre-defined primary endpoint (SRI(4) response) in Study 05 could not be identified.  
The proportion of patients who could taper and maintain a reduced dose of OCS was consistently greater 
in the anifrolumab group than the placebo group across the three studies. In Study 04, the difference 
was  statistically  significant  based  on  a  multiplicity-corrected  analysis.  Overall  data  in  respect  of  OCS 
tapering at week 52 supports a steroid-sparing effect of anifrolumab across the 3 studies. Most, but not 
all patients who were BICLA responders were also responders on the OCS reduction endpoint; among 
BICLA non-responders, the correlation was less clear. The use of a “corticosteroid burst” was permitted 
during the first 12 weeks of treatment but was used by a very limited number of patients.

Numerical  trends  favouring  anifrolumab  were  seen  on  flare  rates,  but  none  of  the  differences  were 
statistically significant. According to the applicant, flares will be assessed as safety events throughout 
the LTE study (study 09). For this purpose, a modified SELENA flare index, using SLEDAI 2K instead of 
the SELENA SLEDAI, is used, and flare assessments are completed once every 3 months during the first 
year of the LTE study and once every 6 months during the second and third years. 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  a  CLASI  response  was  consistently  higher  in the  anifrolumab  300  mg 
group  than  the  placebo  group  across  the  three  studies.  In  Study  04,  the  difference  was  statistically 
significant based on a multiplicity-corrected analysis. However, it should be borne in mind that CLASI 
response was only assessed in a limited subgroup of patients with a CLASI score ≥ 10 points at baseline. 
Moreover,  excluding  subjects  who  had  a  burst  and  taper  of  steroids  in  the  first  12  weeks  as  per  an 
exploratory analysis, the results were weaker with a minor difference from placebo and a wide CI with a 
lower bound below/near to 0. A further weakness is that CLASI response by time point throughout the 
period (week 52) showed only for some time-periods a separation of CI i.e. week 12-16, and week 36-
52 and CI overlapping in the remaining period. Of reassurance on the anifrolumab effect on SLE skin 
manifestations is the numerical trend seen in anifrolumab-treated patients as compared to placebo when 
a higher threshold for response (CLASI≥ 75% or ≥ 90% reductions) is applied and when looking at the 
SLEDAI-2K  and  BILAG-2004  mucocutaneous  domains.  This  provides  overall  support  on  the  beneficial 
effect of anifrolumab on muco-cutaneous manifestations of SLE. 
There  are  no  widely  validated  musculoskeletal  endpoints  in  SLE  although  joint  disease  is  a  common 
feature  of  SLE  impairing  physical  function  and  reducing  QoL.  Moreover,  assessing  efficacy  in  joints  is 
difficult because of the clinical heterogeneity of these manifestations and the degree of inter-observer 
variability. The majority of patients had active joint manifestations at baseline, with 88.9% to 92.4% of 
patients having swollen joints (median joint counts of 5.0 to 7.0), and 93.3% to 100% of patients having 
tender  joints  (median  joint  counts  of  7.0  to  11.0),  across  the  studies.  30%  and  more  than  50%  of 
subjects had severe (BILAG A) or moderate (BILAG B) involvement. A joint endpoint was included as a 
secondary endpoint in Study 05 and escalated as a multiplicity-controlled key secondary endpoint into 
Study 04 based on encouraging findings in Study 05. Whereas a 19% difference between anifrolumab 
300  mg  and  placebo  was  observed  on  joint  response  in  Study  05,  there  was  no  difference  between 
anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo in joint response in Study 04. In light of the sequence of events, the 
effect of anifrolumab on joint symptoms cannot be considered to have been reliably demonstrated.  
Small numerical trends favouring anifrolumab were seen on patient-reported outcomes. 
Given the failure of one of the key studies on its original primary endpoint as well as the uncertainties 
regarding the clinical relevance of the observed treatment effect, the results were discussed within an 
Ad Hoc Expert Group (AHEG) comprising methodological and clinical experts on SLE. While the experts 
considered  the  failure  of  Study  05  on  its  original  primary  endpoint  a  notable  weakness,  they  still 
considered  that  the  total  weight  of  evidence  based  on  BICLA  and  SRI(4)  responses,  as  well  as  other 
effects  including  steroid  sparing,  is  supportive  of  beneficial  treatment  effects,  and  that  the  failure  of 
Study  05  on  SRI(4)  would  not  prevent  an  overall  conclusion  that  efficacy  was  demonstrated  in  the 
programme (see full report below). This position was followed by the CHMP. 
Results  on  OCS  tapering  and  flare  rate  (although  not  statistically  robust)  have  been  included  in  the 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC as they are reflecting important overarching treatment goals in SLE. However, 
the inclusion of other subdomain analyses (CLASI, joint activity) in this section has not been endorsed 
by the CHMP. 
Three  intercurrent  events  were  incorporated  into  the  composite  endpoints  in  studies  04  and  05:  IP 
discontinuation,  restricted  medication  use,  and  study  withdrawal.  Patients  who  experiences  an 
intercurrent  event  were  counted  as  non-responders.  Additional  sensitivity  analyses  conducted  by  the 
applicant  revealed  that  a  large  proportion  of  non-responders  stem  from  intercurrent  events,  which 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 136/198 
 
 
 
decreases the robustness of the results. Notably, in study 04, there was no difference in the proportion 
of true, clinical non-responders between the groups. The impact of intercurrent events was notably large 
in this study where there is a large, unexplained imbalance in study withdrawals between the arms. The 
most common reason was “withdrawal by patient”. At the CHMP’s request, the potential impact of these 
patients on the magnitude of the treatment effect was explored through the tipping point analyses. Based 
on those analyses, there are realistic scenarios where difference between the treatment arms could be 
in the range of 10-11%. This was also discussed with the AHEG. The Experts considered that, despite 
the notable effect of intercurrent events on the point estimate of treatment effect and differences in the 
behaviour of the placebo groups, even a treatment difference that based on some scenarios could be in 
the range of 10-11%, can be considered clinically meaningful (see full report below). This position was 
followed by the CHMP. 
With respect to specific organ involvement, it is of note that almost all subjects (more than 90%) belong 
to BILAG C, D or E for renal, neuropsychiatric or haematological manifestations therefore having a mild 
(C), inactive but previous affected (D) or inactive and not previous affected (E) disease activity; a severe 
(A) or moderate (B) disease activity was only represented by musculoskeletal involvement (as A in 30% 
and as B in 50%, of subjects, percentages balanced across arms) and mucocutaneous symptoms (A 17% 
B 68.9% C 13%, percentages slightly higher in anifrolumab arm as compared to placebo). Therefore, a 
moderate to severe disease activity according to BILAG for organ specific involvement denotes a SLE 
population with moderate to severe disease activity that is quite restricted to a few clinical manifestations 
(musculoskeletal and mucocutaneous). The reason for not including patients with active nephritis or CNS 
involvement in the Phase 3 trials is justified as these patients require a different treatment for the control 
of disease activity; however, this restriction makes difficult to draw conclusions on anifrolumab effect on 
key  target  organs  and  to  extrapolate  to  the  general  population  with  moderate  to  severe  SLE  despite 
SOC.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  the  patient  population  enrolled  into  the  anifrolumab  studies,  with 
predominantly mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal symptomatology, seems representative of the wider 
population  of  SLE  patients.  Moreover,  the  dynamic  nature  of  disease  manifestations  across  different 
organ systems and the fluctuating nature of the disease was also acknowledged.  
Serological markers, such as low serum complement levels and the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies, 
are  often  indicative  of  active  disease  in  SLE.  Therefore,  anti-dsDNA  antibodies  and  serum  levels  of 
complement  components  (C3  and  C4)  were  measured  as  potential  markers  of  inflammation/disease 
activity.  Subgroup  analyses  demonstrated  some  heterogeneity  in  treatment  response.  The  impact  of 
anifrolumab treatment on serological endpoints was overall minor: a greater numerical reduction in anti-
dsDNA antibody levels through 52 weeks was seen in the anifrolumab arm, but only a minority of patients 
with  anti-dsDNA  antibodies  at  baseline  were  negative  by  Week  52  in  the  phase  III  pool  (7.8% 
anifrolumab  vs.  5.8%  placebo,  difference  of  2%).  Negligible  effect  was  seen  on  complement  levels. 
Nevertheless,  a  larger  treatment  effect  was  observed  in  patients  with  high  disease  activity  based  on 
serological  markers.  In  Study  04,  the  difference  between  anifrolumab  300  mg  and  placebo  in  BICLA 
response at Week 52 was 9.2% (95% CI -7.5, 25.8) in patients with normal C3 and C4 and no anti-
dsDNA antibodies at baseline, compared with 21.3% (95% CI 8.8, 33.9) in patients with at least one of 
the following: low C3, low C4 or positive anti-dsDNA. In Study 05, the corresponding values were 7.9% 
(95% CI –7.2, 22.9) in patients with normal C3 and C4 levels and no anti-dsDNA antibodies at baseline, 
compared with 25.0% (95% CI 12.0, 37.9) in patients with at least one low/positive value.  
Initially, the selection of 21 type I IFN-inducible genes for development into a PD marker assay applicable 
in clinical studies was described in detail in Yao et al 2009. In the phase I scleroderma clinical trial MI-
CP180, a 5-gene type I IFN PD signature comprised of a subset of the 21 type I IFN-inducible genes 
(IFI27, IFI44, IFI44L, RSAD2, and IFI6) was shown to correlate with the 21-gene signature. A type I IFN 
gene signature test based on over-expression of 4 type I IFN inducible genes was used to divide the 
patient population in two subgroups as either “type I IFN gene signature test high” or “type I IFN gene 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 137/198 
 
 
 
signature  test  low”.  The  test  measures  the  expression  of  the  genes  IFI27,  IFI44,  IFI44L,  and  RSAD2 
relative  to  3  housekeeping  genes,  the  expression  of  which  are  not  modulated  (reference  genes  18S, 
ACTB,  and  GAPDH)  by  type  I  IFN.  Based  on  results  in  Study  1013,  it  was  considered  that  the 
subpopulation “type I IFN gene signature test high” of SLE patients would be more likely to benefit from 
treatment  with  anifrolumab.  The  21-gene  signature  test  was  used  throughout  the  clinical  studies.  In 
subgroup analyses based on pooled efficacy for the Phase III studies, a difference between treatment 
groups favouring anifrolumab was seen in BICLA response rates regardless of the IFN gene signature 
subtype;  however,  the  difference  in  the  low  subgroup  was  considerably  smaller  and  not  statistically 
significant in Study 04. Intriguingly, the smaller treatment effect seems to be due to a higher placebo 
response rate in the low subgroup, whereas response rates with anifrolumab are very similar between 
the high and low subgroups. 
A treatment effect of similar magnitude was observed between patients with high and moderate disease 
activity at baseline (SLEDAI-2K score of <10 vs. ≥10).  
A very small treatment effect was also seen among male patients; however, baseline imbalances or other 
factors that could potentially explain the apparent lack of a treatment effect among male patients were 
not identified, and the small sample size and wide confidence intervals are acknowledged. 
Based on the studies’ results and at the CHMP’s request, the applicant accepted to modify the wording 
of the indication as follows to include a proper characterisation of the target population and the level of 
disease activity. 
“Saphnelo is indicated as an add-on therapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe, 
active autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) despite standard therapy.” 
Considering that subgroup analyses demonstrated some heterogeneity in treatment response (i.e. larger 
treatment effect was observed in patients with high disease activity based on serological markers), the 
applicant is recommended to continue, through additional analyses or new studies, attempts to identify 
subpopulations that could be considered the best treatment candidates with anifrolumab.  
Additional expert consultation 
The CHMP consulted experts in SLE and statistics to provide input regarding the clinical relevance of 
the effects observed. Upon request from the CHMP, an ad hoc expert group meeting was convened on 
07 December 2021. 
1.  Given  the  study  results  of  the  04  and  the  05  study,  can  an  effect  be  considered  as 
established  in  the  studied  population?  Please  elaborate  with  reference  to  the  data.  In 
particular;    
a.  Can  both  the  BILAG-2004  and  the  SLEDAI-2K  indices  provide  a  clinically 
meaningful characterisation of change in disease activity? 
There was a consensus amongst the experts and the patient representatives that both BILAG-2004 and 
SLEDAI-2K provide a clinically meaningful characterisation of change in disease activity.  
The experts agreed that none of the endpoints were ideal and recognised the challenges related to their 
use in clinical trials. The SLEDAI-2K was more adequate to assess disease activity. It is frequently used 
in clinical practice; however, it is quite insensitive to change. The BILAG-2004 would better evaluate the 
organ involvement and is considered more granular by the experts; however, it very time consuming 
and therefore rarely used in clinical practice. 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 138/198 
 
 
 
The experts and the patient representatives agreed that, although the indices were mostly concordant, 
there could be discordant results. They considered that a demonstration of effect only on the BILAG-
2004 could still be considered clinically meaningful.  
b.  What is your view on the importance of the fact that one of the key studies (Study 
05) failed on its originally designated primary endpoint, demonstrating no benefit 
on SRI(4)? 
The clinical experts and the patients’ representatives agreed that Study 05 failed on its primary endpoint. 
In addition, changing the primary endpoint in Study 04 after having seen the study results from Study 
05 was considered suboptimal. However, they recognised that the effect demonstrated by anifrolumab 
on BICLA was clinically relevant. 
The  statistical  experts  considered  that  there  was  a  fundamental  statistical  issue  with  the  prospective 
change of the primary endpoint midway after having seen the results in Study 05. They were of the view 
that  the  efficacy  analysis  was  not  robust  and  there  were  concerns  that  it  would  lower  the  statistical 
thresholds for medicine registration. Study 04 was considered non-conclusive enough by one statistical 
expert  (in  particular,  with  regard  to  the  tipping  point  analyses).  However,  given  the  clinical 
considerations, the statistical experts could agree with a potentially beneficial effect of the treatment. 
Despite this recognised limitation, taking into account overall the results, the effect and the high 
unmet medical need the clinical experts recognised a beneficial effect. 
The experts also formulated the following recommendations:  
- They were of the view that anifrolumab, if registered, would not be equally effective in all patients. 
Hence,  they  recommended  further  subdomain  analyses  to  better  define  the  target  population.  Some 
experts  indicated  that  anifrolumab  could  be  more  effective  on  musculoskeletal  and  mucosal  (skin) 
manifestations. 
-  They  considered  that  the  high  placebo  effect  observed  in  the  studies  has  not  been  adequately 
characterised by the applicant and would recommend that the applicant further investigates this point 
including possible reasons for high placebo effect in Study 05. 
- In the view of the experts, there are not enough data on detail of corticosteroid tapering. For example, 
how  tapering  would  be  effective  in  patients  on  high  or  low  dose  corticosteroids  at  baseline.  Yet,  the 
possibility  of  corticosteroid  tapering  in  patients  on  anifrolumab  is  a  clinically  meaningful  strength  of 
administering anifrolumab.  
2.  Please  discuss  what  would  be  a  minimal  treatment  difference  that  could  be  considered 
clinically meaningful in light of the endpoints studied in this programme and considering 
also the variability in the magnitude of the treatment effect estimate for anifrolumab. If 
you  consider  that  an  effect  has  been  established  based  on  the  presented  development 
programme (question 1),  can it be concluded that this effect is of such magnitude that it 
would  translate  into  a  clinically  meaningful  effect  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe, 
active autoantibody-positive SLE? 
By  consensus,  the  experts  and  the  patients’  representatives  agreed  that  clinically  meaningful  effects 
were  demonstrated  and  comparable  in  magnitude  to  other  approved  treatment  in  SLE.  The  primary 
endpoint was met in Study 04. It was also mentioned that responders had received several treatments 
before and still had a positive response which was seen as advantageous. Some important secondary 
endpoints  were  also  met  and  were  considered  clinically  relevant  and  meaningful:  possibility  of 
corticosteroid tapering, reduction of flares, patients reported outcomes (quality of life improvements).  
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 139/198 
 
 
 
Considering  the  immense  unmet  need  in  this  disease,  the  experts  agreed  that  the  effect  observed 
translates into a clinically meaningful effect in patients with moderate to severe, active autoantibody-
positive SLE. 
As it is anticipated that not all SLE patients will respond to the treatment, the expert recommended that, 
if anifrolumab is registered, the applicant should better characterise the patients who would benefit from 
the treatment (e.g. need to identify biomarkers). 
2.5.7.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Within the three key studies, anifrolumab demonstrated signs of efficacy across a range of endpoints 
studied.  While  the  failure  of  Study  05  on  its  original  primary  endpoint  (SRI(4)  response)  remains  a 
notable weakness of the overall programme, the CHMP concluded following recommendations from the 
AHEG that the totality of evidence is supportive of beneficial treatment effects of anifrolumab. Based on 
the composite estimand, the treatment difference on BICLA response was 16% in Study 04 and 17% in 
Study 05, although the point estimate is associated with some uncertainty particularly in Study 04, where 
differential  treatment  attrition  complicates  interpretation  of  the  results  and  the  difference  in  some 
scenarios  is  closer  to  10-11%.  Nevertheless,  this  difference,  albeit  modest,  is  considered  clinically 
meaningful in the following indication: 
“Saphnelo is indicated as an add-on therapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe, 
active autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) despite standard therapy.”

Safety analysis population Safety data in the integrated safety analyses were summarised using the 
safety analysis set, including all randomised patients who received at least one dose of IP. 
Safety variables Safety assessments in the anifrolumab clinical development programme were based 
on AEs (including AEs, SAEs, DAEs, and AESIs), clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs 
measurements, 12-lead ECGs, physical examinations and, for the 52-week phase III studies, disease 
flares using a modified SELENA flare index, the C-SSRS, and PHQ-8.  
The primary safety pool (study 04 and study 05) was used to evaluate AEs, SAEs, DAEs, AESIs, 
clinical laboratory data, vital signs, ECGs, and the C-SSRS results over 52 weeks of treatment and to 
perform subgroup analyses. 
The supportive safety pool was also used to evaluate the AE profile for anifrolumab IV 300 mg over 
52 weeks (AEs, SAEs, DAEs, and AESIs). Only data from the anifrolumab 300 mg treatment groups 
and the placebo treatment groups in studies 04, 05, and 1013 were included in the supportive safety 
pool. 
The phase III long-term safety data were used to evaluate AEs, SAEs, DAEs, AESIs, and clinical 
laboratory data up to 4 years of treatment. 
The all anifrolumab safety pool (studies 04, 05, 09, 1013, and 1145) included multiple anifrolumab 
IV treatment groups (150, 300, and 1000 mg) across 5 studies (studies 05, 04, 09, 1013, and 1145). 
This pool was designed to capture all AEs and SAEs in patients who received any anifrolumab dose in 
those studies. 
Treatments In Study 04, patients received anifrolumab at a dose of 300 mg or matching placebo. In 
Study 05, patients received anifrolumab at doses of 150 mg or 300 mg, or matching placebo. In Study 
1013, patients received anifrolumab at doses of 300 mg or 1000 mg, or matching placebo. In all 
studies, dosing was at 4-week intervals, with the last dose administered at Week 48. 
2.5.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The design of the studies, including demographic and patient characteristics, treatments and patient 
disposition can be found in the Efficacy section. 
Size of the safety database 
In total, 1029 subjects have been exposed to any dose of anifrolumab (IV or SC) for periods of up to 
4 years in the clinical development programme. Of those 1029 subjects, at least 837 patients with SLE 
were exposed to IV anifrolumab (doses ≥ 150 mg), including 688 patients for ≥ 52 weeks, 497 patients 
for ≥ 104 weeks, 263 patients for ≥156 weeks, and 108 patients for ≥ 208 weeks. 
Although the total subject number (1029 subjects) is less than the ICH target (1500), the total patient-
years of exposure to IV anifrolumab 150, 300, or 1000 mg in SLE patients (1888.2 PY) was, according 
to the applicant, adequate to evaluate the safety profile of anifrolumab in patients with SLE, a chronic 
disease with an estimated global prevalence of 6.5 to 178.0 cases per 100000 persons (Pons-Estel et al 
2017). Importantly, the number of patients treated with anifrolumab in the programme exceeds the ICH 
E1  recommendations  for  >  6  months  of  exposure  (300  to  600  patients)  and  >  1  year  of  exposure 
(100 patients). Duration of exposure is shown in Table 44.

Overall extent of exposure: Other treatment comparisons 
In the all anifrolumab pool, 837 patients received at least one dose of anifrolumab (150, 300 or 1000 
mg). Total exposure was 1888.2 PY in the all anifrolumab group. A total of 766 (91.5%) patients were

weeks, 497 (59.4%) were exposed for ≥ 104 weeks, and 263 (31.4%) were exposed for ≥ 156 weeks. 
As of 01 August 2019, 108 patients (12.9%) had completed 208 weeks (~ 4 years) of treatment. The 
mean duration of exposure was 824.0 days in the all anifrolumab group and 499.0 days in the placebo 
group. 
Anifrolumab 150 mg vs placebo 
In study 05, 93 patients were randomised to receive anifrolumab IV 150 mg Q4W and received at least 
one dose of IP. There were 184 patients in the placebo group in study 05. The mean (SD) duration of IP 
exposure  was  326.3  days  (87.00)  in  the  anifrolumab  150  mg  group  and  326.9  days  (87.67)  in  the 
placebo  group.  Most  patients  had  a  cumulative  exposure  of  ≥  48  weeks:  81.7%  and  80.4%  in  the 
anifrolumab 150 mg group and placebo group, respectively.

Anifrolumab 1000 mg vs placebo 
In  study  1013,  105  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  anifrolumab  IV  1000  mg.  There  were 
101 patients in the placebo group. The mean (SD) duration of IP exposure was 321.4 days (91.45) in 
the  anifrolumab  1000  mg  group  and  304.3  days  (106.61)  in  the  placebo  group.  Most  patients  had  a 
cumulative exposure of ≥ 48 weeks: 74.3% and 70.3% in the anifrolumab 1000 mg group and placebo 
group, respectively. 
2.5.8.2.  Adverse events 
Overview of adverse events 
Primary and supportive safety pools 
In  the  primary  safety  pool,  the  incidence  of  any  AE  during  treatment  was,  according  to  the  applicant 
greater in the anifrolumab 300 mg group (88.3%) than in the placebo group (80.8%) (Table 45). Most 
AEs  experienced  by  patients  treated  with  anifrolumab  300  mg  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity. 
Patients in the anifrolumab 300 mg group had a lower incidence of any SAE during treatment than the 
placebo group (11.1% vs 16.4%). The proportion of patients with any Discontinuations due to AEs was 
low and similar between the treatment groups. 
Two deaths occurred during treatment in the primary safety pool. Both deaths were in the anifrolumab 
300 mg group (EAIR: 0.6/100 PY). 
In the primary safety pool, the proportion of patients with AEs of herpes zoster and the corresponding 
event  rates  were  higher  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  through 
52 weeks. For all other AESIs, the incidence rates were similar between anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo 
groups through 52 weeks. There was no case of active TB in either treatment group. 
Overall, most patients had AEs considered by the investigator to be unrelated to IP. A higher proportion 
of patients in the anifrolumab group had AEs considered by the investigator to be related to IP compared 
with placebo (36.9% vs 26.0%). 
The overall AE profile in the supportive safety pool was similar to the overall AE profile in the primary 
safety pool (see Table 46).

AESI categories are counted once in each category. The definition of each pool and details of treatment groups within each pool are described in 
SAP Section 2.2.1.If not stated otherwise, percentages are based upon all patients in the safety analysis set within the respective pool and treatment 
group. An AE during treatment is defined as an AE with a date of onset ≥ day of first ever dose of IP and ≤ minimum ((last dosing date + 28 days), 
end of study date, death date). Adverse events are coded using MedDRA version 22.1. Patients with multiple events in the same category are counted 
only once in that category. Patients with events in more than one category are counted once in each of those categories. Any AE by intensity was 
counted once by maximum reported intensity. The patient’s duration of exposure by intensity is the time from first dose of IP up to the start of the 
event with maximum reported intensity, and this duration of exposure is applied across all of the intensity categories. The EAIR per 100 PY is 
defined as the number of patients with the specific event divided by the total exposure time in years and then multiplied by 100. The exposure time 
is defined as from the date of first administration of IP to the date of first event, death, end of treatment + 28 days, or end of study, whichever comes

Phase III long-term safety data 
Based on an evaluation of AEs by category in the phase III long-term data, long-term treatment with 
anifrolumab  300  mg  (>  1  year)  resulted  in  a  safety  profile  consistent  with  what  was  observed  in  the 
primary safety pool (Table 47). 
In the phase III long-term data, the EAIR of any SAE (including deaths) was lower in the anifrolumab 
300 mg group than in the placebo group. 
The EAIRs of individual AESIs in the phase III long-term data were generally similar to the primary safety 
pool.

In  the  primary  safety  pool,  the  most  common  AEs  (reported  in  >  2%  of  patients  in  either  treatment 
group)  are  listed  by  decreasing  frequency  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  in  Table  48.  In  the

nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  urinary  tract  infection,  infusion-related  reaction, 
bronchitis, headache, herpes zoster, back pain, cough, arthralgia, sinusitis, and vomiting. 
Adverse events that were more common (≥ 5% difference or at least 5% incidence and twice the 
frequency) in the anifrolumab 300 mg group than the placebo group were: nasopharyngitis (17.8% vs 
11.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (16.9% vs 9.9%), bronchitis (10.6% vs 4.7%), herpes zoster 
(6.4% vs 1.4%), and arthralgia (5.6% vs 2.2%). Those 5 AEs are summarised by intensity in Table 49. 
The  SOC  with  the  greatest  frequency  of  AEs  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  during  the  treatment 
period was Infections and infestations (71.7% vs 57.8% in the placebo group).

The definition of the pool and details of treatment groups within the pool are described in SAP Section 2.2.1. If not stated otherwise, percentages 
are based upon all patients in the safety analysis set within the respective pool and treatment group. An AE during treatment is defined as an AE 
with a date of onset ≥ day of first ever dose of IP and ≤ minimum ((last dosing date + 28 days), end of study date, death date). Adverse events are 
coded using MedDRA version 22.1. Patients with multiple events in the same category are counted only once in that category. Patients with events 
in more than one category are counted once in each of those categories. AEs are sorted by descending frequency of PT in the anifrolumab 300 mg 
group. The EAIR per 100 PY is defined as the number of patients with the specific event divided by the total exposure time in years and then 
multiplied by 100. The exposure time is defined as from the date of first administration of IP to the date of first event, death, end of treatment + 28 
days, or end of study, whichever comes first. AEs that are present in > 2% of patients in any treatment group are reported. AE Adverse event; EAIR

The definition of each pool and details of treatment groups within each pool are described in SAP Section 2.2.1. If not stated otherwise, percentages 
are based upon all patients in the safety analysis set within the respective pool and treatment group. An AE during treatment is defined as an AE 
with a date of onset ≥ day of first ever dose of IP and ≤ minimum ((last dosing date + 28 days), end of study date, death date). Adverse events are 
coded using MedDRA version 22.1. Patients with multiple events in the same category are counted only once in that category. Patients with events 
in more than one category are counted once in each of those categories. Patients with multiple events are counted only once as related if at least one 
AE is related, and as not related if all occurrences are not related. Any AE by intensity was counted once at the highest intensity level. AEs are 
sorted by descending frequency of PT in the anifrolumab 300 mg group. AE Adverse event; IP Investigational product; n Number of patients with 
an event; N Number of patients in treatment group and subgroup; SAP Statistical analysis plan. 
Supportive safety pool 
The most common AE data in the supportive safety pool were similar to the data in the primary safety 
pool.  In  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  (N  =  459),  the  highest  frequency  AEs  (reported  in  ≥  5%  of 
patients) by PT were nasopharyngitis (16.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (15.5%), urinary tract 
infection (12.0%), bronchitis (9.8%), infusion-related reaction (9.4%), headache (8.1%), herpes zoster 
(6.1%), back pain (5.2%), sinusitis (5.2%), and cough (5.0%). 
In the supportive safety pool, AEs that were more common (≥ 5% difference or at least 5% incidence in 
the anifrolumab group and twice the frequency as the placebo group) in the anifrolumab 300 mg group 
Assessment report

(N = 459) than the placebo group (N = 466) were nasopharyngitis (16.3% vs 9.4%), upper respiratory 
tract infection (15.5% vs 9.7%), bronchitis (9.8% vs 4.3%), and herpes zoster (6.1% vs 1.3%). 
Phase III long-term safety data 
In the phase III long-term safety data, the most common AEs by PT were similar to those observed in 
the primary safety pool. During up to 4 years of treatment, in the anifrolumab 300 mg group (N = 360), 
the highest frequency AEs (reported in ≥ 5% of patients) by PT were nasopharyngitis (25.0%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (24.4%), urinary tract infection (18.6%), bronchitis (17.2%), infusion-related 
reaction (13.9%), headache (11.4%), herpes zoster (10.3%), arthralgia (9.2%), cough (8.6%), back 
pain (8.6%), sinusitis (8.6%), vomiting (6.9%), nausea (6.7%), oral herpes (6.7%), diarrhea (6.4%), 
pharyngitis (6.1%), and pneumonia (5.0%). 
On request, the applicant provided tables of AEs by relatedness to IP, intensity, and seriousness, for the 
primary and supportive safety pools and for the Phase III long-term safety data. The majority of AEs in 
each pool were unrelated to IP in both anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo group. Related AEs were more 
common in the anifrolumab 300 mg groups than in placebo groups, as expected, and the majority were 
mild or moderate in intensity. A lower rate of related SAEs was observed in anifrolumab 300 mg groups 
compared to placebo groups (EAIR per 100 PY: Primary safety group: 2.8 vs 5.5; Supportive safety pool: 
2.9 vs 5.3; Long-term safety data: 2 vs 3.8). In addition, the applicant provided information on most 
common AEs by relatedness.

Serious Adverse Events 
Primary safety pool 
In the primary safety pool, fewer patients in the anifrolumab 300 mg group had any SAE during treatment 
than patients in the placebo group (11.1% vs 16.4%); the EAIR risk difference was -7.3 (95% CI: -13.3, 
-1.4)  (Table  50).  Among  patients  with  SAEs  during  treatment,  in  both  treatment  groups,  the  most 
common SAEs by PT were pneumonia and systemic lupus erythematosus. There were no other trends 
by PT; no other SAEs were reported in > 2 patients in either treatment group. 
There were 6 patients (1.7%) in the anifrolumab group and 8 patients (2.2%) in the placebo group who 
had a SAE of pneumonia. Among the 6 SAEs of pneumonia in the anifrolumab 300 mg group, 2 were 
fatal.  
As a safety variable, the PT of systemic lupus erythematosus included SLE flares and increases in disease 
activity involving new or worsening clinical signs and symptoms. There were 4 patients (1.1%) in the 
anifrolumab  group  and  9  patients  (2.5%)  in  the  placebo  group  who  had  a  SAE  of  systemic  lupus 
erythematosus. During the 52-week treatment period, there was no trend in the timing of these events 
in either treatment group. For an analysis of disease flares as an efficacy variable, refer to the Clinical 
Efficacy Section 2.5.5.

Risk difference is the difference between the EAIRs per 100 PY (anifrolumab 300 mg group– placebo group). 
The definition of each pool and details of treatment groups within each pool are described in SAP Section 2.2.1. 
If not stated otherwise, percentages are based upon all patients in the safety analysis set within the respective pool and treatment 
group. 
An AE during treatment is defined as an AE with a date of onset ≥ day of first ever dose of IP and ≤ minimum ((last dosing date + 
28 days), end of study date, death date). 
Adverse events are coded using MedDRA version 22.1. 
Patients with multiple events in the same category are counted only once in that category. Patients with events in more than one 
category are counted once in each of those categories. 
AEs are sorted by descending frequency of PT in the anifrolumab 300 mg group. 
The EAIR per 100 PY is defined as the number of patients with the specific event divided by the total exposure time in years and 
then multiplied by 100. The exposure time is defined as from the date of first administration of IP to the date of first event, death, 
end of treatment + 28 days, or end of study, whichever comes first. 
AE Adverse event; CI Confidence interval; EAIR Exposure-adjusted incidence rate; IP Investigational product; n Number of

SAP Statistical analysis plan. 
Supportive safety pool 
The  SAEs  in  the  supportive  safety  pool  were  similar  to  the  SAEs  in  the  primary  safety  pool.  In  the 
supportive safety pool, the proportions of patients with one or more SAEs were 11.8% and 16.7% in the 
anifrolumab  300  mg  and  placebo  groups,  respectively;  the  EAIR  risk  difference  was  -7.2  per  100 PY 
(95% CI: -12.5, -1.9). 
Phase III long-term safety data 
As  observed  during the  52-week  treatment  period,  SAE  EAIRs  in  the  phase  III  long-term  safety  data 
were lower in the anifrolumab 300 mg group than the placebo group: 10.8/100 PY vs 18.2/100 PY; risk 
difference of -7.4 (95% CI: -11.8, -3.2). Also consistent with the primary safety pool, the most common 
SAEs  in  both  treatment  groups  in  the  phase  III  long-term  safety  data  were  pneumonia  and  systemic 
lupus  erythematosus  (Table  51).  During  up  to  4  years  of  treatment,  the  EAIR  of  systemic  lupus 
erythematosus SAEs was lower in the anifrolumab 300 mg group than the placebo group. 
The evaluation of SAEs by yearly intervals did not suggest any change in overall SAE incidence over the 
course of long-term treatment (Table 52). Evaluation of the most common SAEs in the anifrolumab 300 
mg group by yearly intervals showed similar event rates over time (Table 52).

a Risk difference is the difference between the EAIRs per 100 PY (anifrolumab 300 mg group– placebo group). The definition of each pool and 
details of treatment groups within each pool are described in SAP Section 2.2.1. If not stated otherwise, percentages are based upon all patients in 
the safety analysis set within the respective pool and treatment group. An AE during treatment is defined as an AE with a date of onset ≥ day of first 
ever dose of IP and ≤ minimum ((last dosing date + 28 days), end of study date, death date). Adverse events are coded using MedDRA version 22.1. 
Patients with multiple events in the same category are counted only once in that category. Patients with events in more than one category are counted 
once in each of those categories. AEs are sorted by descending frequency of PT in the anifrolumab 300 mg group. The EAIR per 100 PY is defined 
as the number of patients with the specific event divided by the total exposure time in years and then multiplied by 100. The exposure time is defined 
as from the date of first administration of IP to the date of first event, death, end of treatment + 28 days, or end of study, whichever comes first. AE

other one. Both have been considered as unrelated to IP by the investigator. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Infections 
Infections  were  identified  as  a  topic  of  interest  in  the  anifrolumab  programme  due  to  the 
immunomodulatory  mechanism  of  action  of  anifrolumab.  Serious  non-opportunistic  infections, 
opportunistic  infections,  herpes  zoster,  TB  (including  latent  TB),  and  influenza  were  analyzed  as 
individual AESI categories. Overall infections were not a category of AESI, but are discussed here as an 
additional supportive analysis.

Primary and supportive safety pools 
In the primary safety pool, infections overall during treatment, as assessed by the SOC Infections and 
infestations, were reported in a greater proportion of patients in the anifrolumab 300 mg group than the 
placebo  group  (71.7%  vs  57.8%)  (Table  54).  Most  infections  in  both  treatment  groups  were  mild  or 
moderate in intensity, were not considered serious, and did not result in discontinuation from treatment. 
The difference between the overall rates of infection in the 300 mg anifrolumab group versus placebo 
group  was  driven  by  differences  in  the  incidence  rates  of  mild  and  moderate  infections  involving  the 
respiratory tract, excluding pneumonia (comparable in both treatment groups), and separately, herpes 
zoster. 
The incidence of serious infections was similar between the treatment groups: 16 patients (4.4%) in the 
anifrolumab 300 mg group and 22 patients (6.0%) in the placebo group had one or more SAE in the 
SOC Infections and infestations. Rates of non-opportunistic serious infections and opportunistic infections 
were also both similar between the treatment groups.

The definition of the pool and details of treatment groups within the pool are described in SAP Section 2.2.1. If not stated otherwise, percentages 
are based upon all patients in the safety analysis set within the respective pool and treatment group. An AE during treatment is defined as an AE 
with a date of onset ≥ day of first ever dose of IP and ≤ minimum ((last dosing date + 28 days), end of study date, death date). Adverse events 
are coded using MedDRA version 22.1. Patients with multiple events in the same category are counted only once in the category. Patients with 
events in more than one category are counted once in each of those categories. The EAIR per 100 PY is defined as the number of patients with 
the specific event divided by the total exposure time in years and then multiplied by 100. The exposure time is defined as from the date of first 
administration of IP to the date of first event, death, end of treatment + 28 days, or end of study, whichever comes first. IP  Investigational 
product; n Number of patients with an event; Number of patients in treatment group and subgroup; PY Patient-years; SAP Statistical analysis

In the supportive safety pool, the incidence of infections during treatment (any AE in the SOC Infections 
and infestations) was greater in the anifrolumab 300 mg group (69.7%; EAIR: 141.8/100 PY) than the 
placebo group (55.4%; EAIR: 99.9/100 PY). Similar to the primary safety pool, this difference was driven 
by  differences  in  the  incidence  rates  of  mild  and  moderate  infections  involving  the  respiratory  tract, 
excluding pneumonia (comparable in both treatment groups), and, separately, herpes zoster. 
Phase III long-term safety data 
In the phase III long-term safety study, the EAIRs of overall infections (AEs in the SOC Infections and 
infestations) were similar to the 52-week primary safety pool data. In the primary safety pool, the EAIRs 
were 151.8/100 PY and 105.4/100 PY in the anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo groups, respectively, and 
both decreased in the long-term safety data to 112.9/100 PY and 93.2/100 PY, respectively. 
Serious infections  
Primary and supportive safety pools 
In  the  primary  safety  pool,  patients  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  had  a  similar  rate  of  non-
opportunistic  serious  infections  compared  with  patients  in  the  placebo  group  (Table  55).  The  most 
Assessment report

common non-opportunistic serious infection by PT  was pneumonia and similar proportions of patients 
experienced a serious pneumonia event in the anifrolumab 300 group (1.7%) and in the placebo group 
(2.2%). No other non-opportunistic infection SAE, by PT, was reported in > 2 patients in either treatment 
group. 
There were few non-opportunistic serious infections during treatment that resulted in discontinuation of 
IP (2 DAEs in each treatment group). One patient in the anifrolumab 300 mg group had diverticulitis 
leading to discontinuation of IP, and the other 3 patients (1 in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and 2 in 
the placebo group) had pneumonia events leading to discontinuation of IP. 
In the supportive safety pool, the proportions of patients with a non-opportunistic serious infection were 
similar to the primary safety pool: 4.8% (22/459) in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and 5.6% (26/466) 
in  the  placebo  group.  In  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group,  events  reported  in  >  2  patients  by  PT  were 
pneumonia (1.7%, 8/459) and appendicitis (0.7%, 3/459). In the placebo group, events reported in > 
2 patients by PT were pneumonia (1.9%, 9/466) and gastroenteritis (0.6%, 3/466).

a Risk difference is the difference between the EAIRs per 100 PY (anifrolumab 300 mg group– placebo group). The definition of each pool and 
details of treatment groups within each pool are described in SAP Section 2.2.1. If not stated otherwise, percentages are based upon all patients in 
the safety analysis set within the respective pool and treatment group. An AE during treatment is defined as an AE with a date of onset ≥ day of 
first ever dose of IP and ≤ minimum ((last dosing date + 28 days), end of study date, death date). Adverse events are coded using MedDRA version 
22.1. Patients with multiple events in the same category are counted only once in that category. Patients with events in more than one category are 
counted once in each of those categories. The patient’s duration of exposure by intensity is the time from first dose of IP up to the start of the event 
with maximum reported intensity, and this duration of exposure is applied across all of the intensity categories. The EAIR per 100 PY is defined 
as the number of patients with the specific event divided by the total exposure time in years and then multiplied by 100. The exposure time is 
defined as from the date of first administration of IP to the date of first event, death, end of treatment + 28 days, or end of study, whichever comes 
first. AE Adverse event; AESI Adverse event of special interest; CI Confidence interval; DAE Adverse event leading to discontinuation of IP;

Phase III long-term safety data 
Consistent with the 52-week data, the phase III long-term safety data demonstrated that patients in the 
anifrolumab  300  mg  group  had  a  similar  risk  for  non-opportunistic  serious  infections  compared  with 
patients  in  the  placebo  group.  In  the  phase  III  long-term  safety  data,  the  most  common  non-
opportunistic serious infection by PT was pneumonia and similar proportions of patients experienced a 
serious pneumonia event in the anifrolumab 300 group (2.2%) and the placebo group (2.5%). In the 
anifrolumab  300  mg  group,  other  non-opportunistic  serious  infections  reported  in  >  2  patients  were:

herpes zoster (1.4%, 5 patients) and pyelonephritis (0.8%, 3 patients). No other non-opportunistic SAE, 
by  PT,  was  reported  in  >  2  patients  in  either  treatment  group.  In  the  long-term  safety  data,  non-
opportunistic  serious  infections  were  reported  at  rates  of  4.4/100  PY  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  and 
6.2/100 PY in the placebo group, with no trend in either treatment group by yearly intervals (Table 56).

Opportunistic infections 
There was 1 opportunistic infection reported in the primary safety pool during the 52-week treatment 
period: 1 patient in the anifrolumab 300 mg group had a non-serious AE with PT mycobacterium avium 
complex infection that led to discontinuation of IP. 
In the supportive safety pool, 2 additional opportunistic infections were reported; both in the placebo 
group. One patient had a non-serious AE during treatment (PT oropharyngeal candidiasis). One patient 
had a SAE (PT meningitis cryptococcal) with an onset date 32 days after the prior dose of IP. 
In the phase III long-term safety data, in addition to the mycobacterium avium complex infection in the 
52-week treatment period, there were opportunistic infections reported in 1 patient in the anifrolumab 
300 mg group (ophthalmic herpes simplex; non-serious) and 1 patient in the placebo group (respiratory 
moniliasis; non-serious). 
Herpes zoster 
Primary and supportive safety pools 
During treatment in the primary safety pool, patients in the anifrolumab 300 mg group had an increased 
risk  for  cutaneous  herpes  zoster  through  52  weeks  compared  with  patients  in  the  placebo  group:  23 
patients (6.4%) had a herpes zoster event in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and 5 patients (1.4%) had 
a herpes zoster event in the placebo group (Table 57). 
Assessment report

Of  the  23  patients  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  with  a  herpes  zoster  event  during  treatment, 
22 patients had cases that were mild or moderate in intensity. In the anifrolumab 300 mg group, one 
patient  had  a  SAE  of  herpes  zoster  and  2  patients  discontinued  IP  due to  a  herpes  zoster  AE.  In  the 
placebo group, none of the 5 herpes zoster events were serious or resulted in discontinuation of IP. All 
herpes  zoster  cases  in  both  treatment  groups  resolved;  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  9  cases 
resolved with sequelae and in the placebo group 1 case resolved with sequelae. Most patients received 
antiviral treatment: all patients in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and 3 of the 5 patients in the placebo 
group. 
In the anifrolumab 300 mg group, approximately half (12/23) events had an onset during the first 
12 weeks of treatment (Table 58). There was no pattern in the duration of events during the 52-week 
treatment period and no differences between the anifrolumab 300 mg group and placebo group in 
event duration. 
Subgroup  analyses  did  not  demonstrate  any  clear  trends  in  herpes  zoster  cases  by  demographics, 
baseline disease characteristics, or SLE-related medication use in the primary safety pool.

In  the  supportive  safety  pool,  incidence  of  herpes  zoster  was  similar  to  the  primary  safety  pool: 
28 patients (6.1%) and 6 patients (1.3%) had any AE of herpes zoster in the anifrolumab 300 mg and 
placebo groups, respectively. In study 1013, there was 1 patient in the anifrolumab 300 mg group with 
reported SAEs of herpes zoster as well as myelitis transverse. 
Phase III long-term safety data 
The increased risk for herpes zoster infections in anifrolumab-treated patients was also observed in the 
phase III long-term safety data. Over up to 4 years of treatment, AEs of herpes zoster were reported in 
39 patients (10.8%; EAIR: 5.5/100 PY) in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and 8 patients (2.2%; EAIR: 
1.7/100 PY) in the placebo group. The EAIR of herpes zoster AEs in the anifrolumab 300 mg group was 
highest in the first 52 weeks of treatment (7.3/100 PY) and decreased slightly during Year 2 and Year 3 
(4.1 and 4.7/100 PY), with no events observed during Year 4. Similar to the primary safety pool, there 
was no difference noted between the treatment groups in the length of events (onset to resolution) in 
the phase III long-term safety data. 
Most herpes zoster events in the phase III long-term safety data were mild or moderate in intensity (34 
of 39 events). Over up to 4 years of treatment, there were 7 patients (1.9%; EAIR: 0.9/100 PY) in the 
anifrolumab 300 mg group with an SAE of herpes zoster. Two of the patients with herpes zoster SAEs 
additionally experienced SAEs of post-herpetic neuralgia, leading to discontinuation of IP. 
Tuberculosis (including latent TB) 
To be eligible for the controlled phase II and III studies (studies 1013, 04, and 05), patients were to 
have  no  evidence  of  active  TB  or  latent  TB,  unless  the  latent  TB  was  documented  to  have  been 
appropriately treated or active treatment had been initiated. All patients in the controlled phase II and 
III studies underwent TB testing at screening and at Week 52. 
In the anifrolumab clinical programme, there were no cases of active TB reported during any study. 
Primary and supportive safety pools 
In  the  primary  safety  pool,  there  were  6  patients  with  AEs  with  the  PT  latent tuberculosis  during  the 
study:  4  patients  (1.1%;  EAIR  1.1/100  PY)  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  and  2  patients  (0.5%; 
EAIR: 0.6/100 PY) in the placebo group. 
In the supportive safety pool, the numbers of AEs reported as latent TB during study were similar to the 
primary  safety  pool.  There  were  6  patients  (1.3%;  EAIR:  1.3/100  PY)  and  3  patients  (0.6%;  EAIR: 
0.7/100 PY) with an AE recorded as latent TB in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and the placebo group, 
respectively.

Phase III long-term safety data 
Over up to 4 years of treatment with anifrolumab 300 mg, there were no active TB cases. In the phase 
III long-term data, patients in the anifrolumab 300 mg group were more likely to have an AE reported 
as latent TB. The exposure-adjusted incidence of latent TB was 2.2/100 PY in the anifrolumab 300 mg 
group and 0.8/100 PY in the placebo group, a risk difference of 1.6 (95% CI: 0.2, 3.0). 
In  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group,  the  exposure-adjusted  incidence  of  latent  TB  AEs  reported  during 
treatment trended upward, as measured by yearly intervals. 
Influenza 
Primary and supportive safety pools 
In the primary safety pool, the incidence of influenza during treatment was similar in both treatment 
groups: 6 patients (1.7%; EAIR: 1.9/100 PY) in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and 8 patients (2.2%; 
EAIR: 2.5/100 PY) in the placebo group had AEs with the PT influenza. 
The event rates for influenza in the supportive pool were generally similar to the primary safety pool: 12 
patients  (2.6%;  EAIR:  2.9/100  PY)  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  and  9  patients  (1.9%;  EAIR: 
2.3/100 PY) in the placebo group had AEs with the PT influenza. 
Phase III long-term safety data 
Consistent with the 52-week data, in the phase III long-term safety data, patients in the anifrolumab 
300  mg  group  and  placebo  group  had  similar  EAIRs  of  influenza:  2.0/100  PY  and  1.9/100  PY, 
respectively. 
Anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity, and infusion-related reactions 
Anaphylaxis was considered an AESI. As anifrolumab is a protein-based infusion therapy, hypersensitivity 
and infusion-related reactions were also topics of interest. 
In the placebo-controlled phase II and III studies (studies 1013, 04, and 05), patients did not receive 
premedication unless they had a prior infusion-related reaction to anifrolumab. If a prior infusion-related 
reaction was documented, the investigator could elect to administer prophylactically an antihistamine 
and/or  acetaminophen/paracetamol  for  the  comfort  and  safety  of  the  patient  prior  to  subsequent 
infusions. Prophylactic use of glucocorticosteroids prior to subsequent infusions was not permitted. 
Anaphylaxis 
In study 05, one patient in the anifrolumab 150 mg group had an anaphylactic reaction. There were no 
other anaphylaxis events reported in the anifrolumab development programme. 
Hypersensitivity  
Primary and supportive safety pools 
In the primary safety pool, there were numerically more AEs categorised as hypersensitivity reactions in 
the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  than  the  placebo  group:  12  patients  (3.3%)  and  3  patients  (0.8%), 
respectively. In the primary safety pool, all hypersensitivity AEs were mild or moderate in intensity, and 
all  events  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  resolved  spontaneously  or  with  symptomatic  treatment 
(Table 59). One patient in the anifrolumab 300 mg group had a hypersensitivity SAE, was treated, and 
continued with the IP dosing schedule with prophylaxis given for subsequent infusions. One patient in 
the  placebo  group  had  a  hypersensitivity  AE  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  IP.  During  the  52-week 
treatment period, all hypersensitivity AEs occurred the first 24 weeks of treatment.

The incidence of hypersensitivity events in the supportive safety pool were similar to the incidence in the 
primary safety pool.

aHypersensitivity excludes those events meeting anaphylaxis criteria. b Risk difference is the difference between the EAIRs per 100 PY (anifrolumab 
300 mg group– placebo group). The definition of each pool and details of treatment groups within each pool are described in SAP Section 2.2.1. If 
not stated otherwise, percentages are based upon all patients in the safety analysis set within the respective pool and treatment group. An AE during 
treatment is defined as an AE with a date of onset ≥ day of first ever dose of IP and ≤ minimum ((last dosing date + 28 days), end of study date, 
death date). Adverse events are coded using MedDRA version 22.1. Patients with multiple events in the same category are counted only once in that 
category. Patients with events in more than one category are counted once in each of those categories. Any AE by intensity was counted once by 
maximum reported intensity. The patient’s duration of exposure by intensity is the time from first dose of investigational product up to the start of 
the event with maximum reported intensity, and this duration of exposure is applied across all of the intensity categories. The EAIR per 100 PY is 
defined as the number of patients with the specific event divided by the total exposure time in years and then multiplied by 100. The exposure time 
is defined as from the date of first administration of IP to the date of first event, death, end of treatment + 28 days, or end of study, whichever comes 
first. AE Adverse event; CI Confidence interval; DAE Adverse event leading to discontinuation of IP; EAIR Exposure-adjusted n event; N Number

Infusion-related reactions 
In the primary safety pool, patients in the anifrolumab 300 mg group had a numerically greater incidence 
of infusion-related reactions through 52 weeks compared with patients in the placebo group (11.4% vs 
7.4%;  Table 60).  All  infusion-related  reactions  were  mild or  moderate in intensity  and  there  were no 
serious infusion-related reactions. One patient in the placebo group had an infusion-related reaction that 
led  to  discontinuation  of  IP;  no  patient  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  discontinued  IP  due  to  an 
infusion-related reaction. During the 52-week treatment period, most AEs with the PT infusion-related 
reaction occurred in the first 24 weeks of treatment (Table 61) 
In the primary safety pool, in the anifrolumab 300 mg group, there were 79 infusion-related reaction 
events in 39 patients. Among the events, the most common symptoms (reported in ≥ 5% of events) in 
the anifrolumab 300 mg group were headache (45.6% of events), nausea (22.8% of events), vomiting 
(7.6% of events), and fatigue (5.1% of events). 
In the supportive safety pool, at least one infusion-related reaction was reported for 43 patients (9.4%) 
in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and 33 patients (7.1%) in the placebo group. All of the infusion-related 
reactions in the supportive safety pool were mild or moderate in intensity and, similar to the primary 
safety pool, most events occurred in the first 24 weeks of treatment.

a Risk difference is the difference between the EAIRs per 100 PY (anifrolumab 300 mg group– placebo group). Infusion-related reactions are as 
reported by the investigators. The definition of each pool and details of treatment groups within each pool are described in SAP Section 2.2.1. 
If not stated otherwise, percentages are based upon all patients in the safety analysis set within the respective pool and treatment group. An AE 
during treatment is defined as an AE with a date of onset ≥ day of first ever dose of IP and ≤ minimum ((last dosing date + 28 days), end of study 
date, death date). Adverse events are coded using MedDRA version 22.1. Patients with multiple events in the same category are counted only once

Malignancies 
Across the phase II and III SLE controlled and uncontrolled studies of IV anifrolumab (studies 02, 04, 
05,  09,  1013,  and  1145),  there  were  14  malignancies  reported  in  patients  who  received  any  dose  of 
anifrolumab. Only non-melanoma skin cancers (n = 7) and breast cancers (n = 3) were reported in more 
than 1 patient. 
Among 6 total malignancies reported in anifrolumab-treated patients in the 52-week phase III studies 
(study  04  and  05),  there  were  4  malignancies  reported  within  180  days  of  the  first  exposure  to 
anifrolumab, which were likely pre-existing: 2 cases of squamous cell carcinoma in the anifrolumab 300 
mg group (31 days and 51 days after the patient’s first dose, respectively), an invasive breast carcinoma 
in  the  anifrolumab  150  mg  group  (113  days  after  the  first  dose),  and  a  B-cell  lymphoma  in  the 
anifrolumab 300 mg group (12 days after the first dose).

In the supportive safety pool, in addition to the events in the primary pool, there was one additional 
case of invasive ductal breast carcinoma in a patient in the anifrolumab 300 mg group in study 1013. In 
total, in the supportive pool, there were 6 patients (1.3%) and 3 patients (0.6%) with any malignancy 
in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and placebo group, respectively. Similar to the primary safety pool, in 
the supportive pool, the risk difference in EAIRs between the anifrolumab 300 mg group (EAIR: 1.3/100

Phase III long-term safety data  
Overall,  in  the  phase  III  long-term  safety  data,  6  patients  (1.7%)  and  4  patients  (1.1%)  had  a 
malignancy in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and placebo group, respectively. In addition to the events 
reported in the primary safety pool, there was one patient in the anifrolumab 300 mg group with a basal 
cell carcinoma and one patient in the placebo group with a squamous cell carcinoma.

In the primary safety pool, there were no trends in the patients’ histories of cardiovascular risk factors. 
Only one MACE event was reported in the primary safety pool: one patient (0.3%) in the anifrolumab 
300 mg group had an AE of acute coronary syndrome; the EAIR was 0.3/100 PY. In the supportive safety 
pool, in addition to the acute coronary syndrome event, there were 3 patients with MACE events, all in 
the  placebo  group  in  study  1013.  Two  of  the  patients  had  an  ischemic  stroke  and  one  patient  had  a 
cerebral infarction. 
Vasculitis (non-SLE) 
Vasculitis has been evaluated because of the findings of focal arteritis in a non-clinical study. However, 
non-SLE  vasculitis  was  not  observed  in  any  anifrolumab-treated  patient  in  the  primary  safety  pool, 
supportive safety pool, or the phase III long-term data. 
Analysis  of  adverse  events:  Other  treatment  comparisons  and  other  phase  I  and  II  studies 
not included in the ISS analyses 
As  the  proposed  dosage  of  anifrolumab  is  IV  300  mg  Q4W, the  analyses  focused  on  a  comparison  of 
patients who received anifrolumab IV 300 mg versus patients who received placebo in the SLE phase II 
and  III  controlled  clinical  studies.  As  supportive  analyses,  other  treatment  comparisons  were  also 
performed: all anifrolumab (150, 300, and 1000 mg) vs placebo, anifrolumab 150 mg vs placebo, and 
anifrolumab 1000 mg vs placebo. 
All anifrolumab (150, 300, and 1000 mg) pool 
The  overall  safety  profile  of  the  all  anifrolumab  pool  was  consistent  with  the  primary  safety  pool, 
supportive safety pool, and phase III long-term safety data (Table 64). Similar to the anifrolumab 300 
mg  vs  placebo  analyses,  in  the  all  anifrolumab  pool  most  AEs  in  both  treatment groups  were  mild or 
moderate  in  intensity  and  the  exposure-adjusted  incidence  of  SAEs  was  lower  in  the  all  anifrolumab 
group than the placebo group (EAIR/100 PY: 10.9 vs 21.4). In contrast to the primary safety pool, the 
exposure-adjusted  event  rate  of  patients  with  any  AE  was  lower  in  the  all  anifrolumab  group  (EAIR: 
178.2/100 PY) than in the placebo group (EAIR: 212.2/100 PY). The most common AEs among patients 
who received any dose of anifrolumab in the all anifrolumab pool were similar to the most common AEs 
identified in the anifrolumab 300 mg vs placebo. 
In the all anifrolumab pool, 4 patients in the all anifrolumab group had a fatal AE during treatment.

The overall profile of AESIs in the all anifrolumab pool was also consistent with the anifrolumab 300 mg 
vs placebo analyses: there were more AEs of herpes zoster and latent TB in the all anifrolumab group 
than the placebo group but the EAIRs of other AESIs was similar between the all anifrolumab and placebo 
groups. There were no cases of active TB. 
Also, of note were uncommon events that were not reported in the primary, supportive, or long-term 
data, but were reported in the all anifrolumab group: 1 patient with an anaphylaxis AE (anifrolumab 150 
mg  group  in  study  05)  and  3  patients  with  vasculitis  AEs.  The  3  vasculitis  AEs  in  the  all  anifrolumab 
group were all non-serious, resolved prior to the next scheduled dose of IP, and were not considered by 
investigators to be related to IP. For 2 of the vasculitis AEs, causes were identified by the investigator: 
infection and SLE, respectively.

Adverse events and EAIR during treatment in any category – All anifrolumab pool 
Anifrolumab 150 mg vs placebo 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  one  or  more  AE  during  treatment  was  higher  in  the 
anifrolumab 150 mg group (84.9%, 79/93) than the placebo group (77.7%, 143/184). The majority of 
Assessment report

AEs were non-serious, mild or moderate in intensity, and did not lead to discontinuation of IP. In the 
anifrolumab 150 mg group, the most common AEs by PT (≥ 5% of patients) were upper respiratory tract 
infection  (17.2%),  nasopharyngitis  (15.1%),  urinary  tract  infection  (9.7%),  bronchitis  (7.5%), 
pharyngitis (6.5%), gastroenteritis, herpes zoster, pneumonia, and sinusitis (5.4% each). 
In the anifrolumab 150 mg group, 10.8% of patients experienced at least one SAE during treatment, 
compared with 16.3% of patients in the placebo group; the risk difference was -6.8 (95% CI:  -16.0, 
3.7).  Among  the  SAEs  reported  during  treatment,  the  most  common  by  SOC  was  Infections  and 
infestations (3 patients [3.2%] in the anifrolumab 150 mg group and 10 patients [5.4%] in the placebo 
group) and the most common SAE by PT (≥ 2%) was systemic lupus erythematosus (2 patients [2.2%] 
in the anifrolumab 150 mg group and 3 patients [1.6%] in the placebo group). The proportions of patients 
with a DAE were 6.5% in the anifrolumab 150 mg group and 2.7% in the placebo group. 
During treatment in study 05, there were no deaths in the anifrolumab 150 mg group or the placebo 
group. There was one death (placebo group, PT encephalitis) during follow-up. 
The proportion of patients with AEs of herpes zoster were numerically higher in the anifrolumab 150 mg 
group compared with the placebo group: 5 patients (5.4%) vs 3 patients (1.6%), respectively. For all 
other AEs of special interest, the incidence rate was similar between the anifrolumab 150 mg group and 
placebo group. 
In study 05, there was one case of anaphylaxis observed in a patient in the anifrolumab 150 mg group. 
In this patient, AEs of rash and pruritus were associated with the first dose of IP, and the second dose 
was associated with AEs of wheezing, flushing, dyspnea, and recurrence of dermatological symptoms. 
The patient received treatment for the event and was considered recovered one day later. The patient 
withdrew  from  the  study  due  to  this  SAE  of  anaphylactic  reaction.  There  was  one  malignancy  in  the 
anifrolumab 150 mg group (PT invasive breast carcinoma) and one malignancy in the placebo group (PT 
squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix). 
Anifrolumab 1000 mg vs placebo 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  one  or  more  AEs  during  treatment  was  higher  in  the 
anifrolumab 1000 mg group (87/105, 82.9%) than the placebo group (75/101, 74.3%). The majority of 
AEs were non-serious, mild or moderate in intensity, and did not lead to discontinuation of IP. In the 
anifrolumab  1000  mg  group,  the  most  common  AEs  by  PT  (≥  5%  of  patients)  were  nasopharyngitis 
(11.4%), headache (11.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (9.5%), herpes zoster (8.6%), influenza 
(7.6%), cough (7.6%), diarrhea (6.7%), and bronchitis (6.7%). 
In the anifrolumab 1000 mg group, 14.3% of patients experienced at least one SAE during treatment, 
compared with 17.8% of patients in the placebo group; the EAIR risk difference was -5.9 (95% CI: -18.4, 
6.3). 
Among the SAEs reported during treatment, the most common by PT (≥ 2% in the anifrolumab 1000 mg 
group) was systemic lupus erythematosus (3 patients [2.9%] in the anifrolumab 1000 mg group and 5 
patients [5.0%] in the placebo group) and the most common by SOC was Infections and infestations (5 
patients [4.8%] in the anifrolumab 1000 mg group and 4 patients [4.0%] in the placebo group). The 
proportion of patients with a DAE was numerically greater in the anifrolumab 1000 mg treatment group 
(8.6%) than in the placebo group (5.9%). During treatment in study 1013, there was one death in the 
anifrolumab 1000 mg group (PT: colitis) and no deaths in the placebo group. 
For most of the AESIs, the incidence rate was similar between the anifrolumab 1000 mg and placebo 
groups. However, the proportions of patients with AEs  with the PTs herpes zoster and influenza were 
higher  in  the  anifrolumab  1000  mg  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  There  were  9  patients 
(8.6%) in the anifrolumab 1000 mg group with a herpes zoster AE, compared with 1 patient (1.0%) in 
Assessment report

the  placebo  group.  There  were  8  patients  (7.6%)  in  the  anifrolumab  1000  mg  group  who  had  an  AE 
reported  by  the  investigator  as  influenza  during  treatment,  compared  with  1  patient  (1.0%)  in  the 
placebo group. 
2.5.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
Primary safety pool 
The  mean  hematology  values  were  generally  similar  between  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  and  placebo 
groups at baseline and at Week 52. There were no clinically meaningful differences noted between the 
treatment groups in categorical shifts and no other differences in the frequency or pattern of potentially 
clinically significant treatment-emergent changes from baseline in hematology variables at 52 weeks. 
Phase III long-term safety data  
The  mean  changes  in  hematology  variables  in  the  phase  III  long-term  treatment  pool  did  not 
demonstrate  any  clinically  meaningful  trends  with  long-term  treatment  of  anifrolumab  300  mg  Q4W. 
There  were  few  clinically  important  treatment-emergent  changes  in  individual  patients  treated  with 
anifrolumab 300 mg in the phase III long-term safety data. 
Clinical chemistry 
There were no Hy’s Law cases (AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN) reported during the 
52-week phase III studies. 
Primary safety pool 
In  the  primary  safety  pool,  no  differences  in  mean  clinical  chemistry  values  were  noted  between 
anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo and no clinically meaningful trends in change from baseline values over 
time were detected. Renal function as assessed by serum creatinine remained stable from baseline to 
Week 52. 
There  was  also  no  difference  noted  between  the  treatment  groups  in  the  frequency  and  pattern  of 
potentially clinically significant changes or categorical shifts from baseline in clinical chemistry variables 
at 52 weeks. 
Phase III long-term safety data 
The  mean  changes  in  clinical  chemistry  variables  in  the  phase  III  long-term  treatment  pool  did  not 
demonstrate any clinically meaningful trends with long-term treatment of anifrolumab 300 mg Q4W (up 
to 4 years). Renal function also remained stable in the phase III long-term safety data as assessed by 
serum creatinine. 
There  were  also  generally  no  differences  noted  between  the  treatment  groups  in  the  frequency  and 
pattern of potentially clinically significant changes in clinical chemistry variables over up to 4 years of 
treatment.  However,  in  comparison  to  the  52-week  treatment  period,  there  were  numerically  more 
patients in the anifrolumab 300 group in the phase III long-term data with glucose values ≥ 7.0 mmol/L 
(4.9% in the primary pool vs 7.4% in the phase III long-term data). This trend was not observed in the 
placebo group and few patients in either treatment group had glucose values ≥ 11.1 mmol/L in the phase 
III long-term data.

In the primary safety pool, the change from baseline to Week 52 in mean specific gravity was similar in 
the anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo groups. Urine protein/creatinine ratio values remained stable from 
baseline to Week 52. 
There  was  also  no  difference  noted  between  the  treatment  groups  in  the  frequency  and  pattern  of 
potentially clinically significant changes in UPCR over 52 weeks of treatment. 
Phase III long-term safety data 
In the phase III long-term safety data, the change from baseline to the end of treatment in mean specific 
gravity was similar in the anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo groups. From baseline to end of treatment, 
the change in median UPCR values was -0.23 and 0.64 mg/mmol in the anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo 
groups, respectively. In the phase III long-term safety data, 2.2% and 2.5% of patients had a UPCR 
value  categorised  as  a  potentially  meaningful  change  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  and  placebo 
group, respectively.  
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
In  the  primary  safety  pool,  no  clinically  significant  differences  were  reported  in  mean  blood  pressure 
values, heart rate or shifts in ECG parameters from normal to abnormal. 
In studies 04 and 05, there were no clinically important differences among treatment groups in mean 
changes from baseline in body weight to Week 52. 
In both studies, the proportions of patients with Cushingoid features at baseline were similar among the 
treatment groups. In general, fewer patients had Cushingoid features at Week 52 compared with baseline 
across all treatment groups. 
Renal-related effects 
Patients  with  serum  creatinine  >  2.0  mg/dL  (or  >  181  μmol/L)  or  UPCR  >  2.0  mg/mg  (or  >  226.30 
mg/mmol) were excluded from the phase II and III SLE studies. Patients with active lupus nephritis were 
excluded from these studies. The efficacy and safety of anifrolumab in lupus nephritis is being evaluated 
in a separate study. 
Renal-related laboratory assessments (SAEs and DAEs) 
In  the  primary  safety  pool,  frequency  of  renal-related  SAEs  was  low  and  balanced  between  the 
anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo groups. There were 2 patients (0.6%) in the anifrolumab 300 mg group 
and 5 patients (1.4%) in the placebo group with SAEs in the SOC Renal and urinary disorders. Similarly, 
the proportion of patients with renal-related DAEs was low and balanced between the anifrolumab 300 
mg group (1 patient, PT nephritis) and placebo group (1 patient, PT lupus nephritis). 
Suicidality and depression 
There was no evidence in the primary safety pool of an increased risk in suicidal ideation or behavior in 
patients receiving anifrolumab compared with placebo, as assessed by the C-SSRS. Similarly, no patients 
in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  and  2  patients  in  the  placebo  group  had  related  AEs  (PTs:  suicide 
attempt and suicidal ideation). PHQ-8 scores were also similar across all treatment groups at baseline 
and no clinically meaningful changes from baseline to Week 52 were observed for any treatment group 
and as assessed by the MedDRA SMQ depression (excluding suicide and self-injury), there were few AEs 
related  to  depression  and  the  proportion  of  patients  with  those  events  was  balanced  between  the 
treatment groups.

Intrinsic factors  
Effect of sex, age, race and body mass index 
As the vast majority of patients with SLE are female, approximately 92.8% of patients in the primary 
safety pool were females. Although based on a relatively small sample size of males, the safety profile 
of anifrolumab is generally similar between men and women for up to 52 weeks of treatment. 
The proportion of patients in the programme ≥ 65 years of age was small (3.2%). Based on the limited 
data, the safety profile of anifrolumab appears to be similar in patients ≥ 65 years compared with those 
< 65 years of age for up to 52 weeks of treatment. 
Anifrolumab has not been studied in pediatric patients < 18 years of age. 
Although the primary safety pool study population was predominantly white (65.9% of patients), the AE 
profile of anifrolumab was generally similar across racial groups for up to 52 weeks of treatment. 
The safety profile of anifrolumab is generally similar in patients with BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2 compared with 
those < 28 kg/m2 for up to 52 weeks of treatment. 
Effect of renal function and hepatic function 
The 52-week phase III studies enrolled patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, but did not 
include patients with severe impairment.  
As measured by eGFR at baseline, most patients in the primary safety pool had normal kidney function 
(≥ 90 mL/min/1.73  m2):  65.8%  and  67.9%  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  and  placebo  group, 
respectively. About a third of patients (29.7% in the anifrolumab 300 group and 28.2% in the placebo 
group) had eGRF values categorised as mild disease (60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2). Few patients (4.4% 
and 3.8%) had eGRF values categorised as moderate disease (30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2) and none as 
severe disease (≤ 29 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Subgroups based on disease-related factors at baseline 
In the primary safety pool, 71.6% of patients had baseline SLEDAI-2K ≥ 10 points. The safety profile of 
anifrolumab is generally similar in patients with SLEDAI-2K ≥ 10 points compared with those < 10 points 
for up to 52 weeks of treatment. 
HZ events were more common (only for anifrolumab 300 mg arm) in the SLEDAI-2K ≥ 10 group (8%) 
than in the < 10 group (2.8%). 
Approximately 82.6% of patients in the primary safety pool were IFN gene signature high at screening. 
The safety profile of anifrolumab was generally similar in patients with IFN gene signature high compared 
with low for up to 52 weeks of treatment.

The  safety  profile  of  anifrolumab  is  generally  similar  in  patients  across  geographic  regions  for  up  to 
52 weeks of treatment. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the frequency or pattern 
of AEs. 
Subgroups based on concomitant medication use at baseline 
In  the  primary  safety  pool,  51.7%  of  patients  were taking  ≥  10  mg/day  OCS  at  baseline.  The  safety 
profile of anifrolumab was generally similar in patients across baseline OCS dose baseline (< 10 mg/day 
versus ≥ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) up to 52 weeks of treatment. 
In  the  primary  safety  pool,  48.1%  of  patients  were  on  immunosuppressant  therapy  at  baseline.  The 
safety  profile  of  anifrolumab  is  generally  similar  in  patients  taking  or  not  taking  immunosuppressant 
therapy for up to 52 weeks of treatment. 
In patients taking immunosuppressant therapy (for up to 52 weeks of treatment) compared to patients 
not taking immunosuppressant was observed a higher incidence of non-opportunistic serious infections 
(5.2% vs 3.7%) and of HZ (9.8% vs 3.2%). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There have been no formal drug-drug interaction studies conducted with anifrolumab.  
Immunisations 
No vaccine studies in anifrolumab have been performed. 
Pregnancy 
Women with SLE have greater risks during pregnancy and delivery than women without SLE (Mehta et 
al 2019). Although outcomes have improved in recent years, pregnant SLE patients experience higher 
rates of preeclampsia or eclampsia during delivery (Mehta et al 2019). 
In  the  anifrolumab  clinical  programme,  females  of  childbearing  potential  were  counseled  to  use  2 
effective methods of avoiding pregnancy during study participation, and had a negative serum pregnancy 
test during screening and negative urine pregnancy test during the study prior to receiving any IP. 
Pregnancy: non-clinical and clinical experience 
In animal studies of anifrolumab increased amount of embryo-foetal losses and dead fetuses were seen 
(see non-clinical section). 
No clinical study has been conducted in pregnant or lactating women and there is a limited amount of 
data from the use of anifrolumab in pregnant women. The data on pregnancy exposure from the clinical 
studies are insufficient to inform on drug-associated risk. 
Overall, in the anifrolumab SLE clinical programme there were 31 patients with one or more pregnancy 
as of 01 August 2019. Of those 31 patients, 20 patients were randomised to receive anifrolumab. Among 
the patients who received anifrolumab and reported a pregnancy, no congenital anomalies associated 
with IP or no drug-associated AEs were observed. 
However, among these 31 pregnancies, there were 18 live births1 (14 in an anifrolumab group, 4 in a 
placebo  group),  9 elective  abortions  (7 in  an  anifrolumab  group,  2  in  a  placebo  group),  and  4 
1 The count of “live births” includes outcomes of live birth, premature birth, full term, and “not available” or “not reported” where additional source 
documents indicate a live baby was born.

spontaneous abortions (4 in an anifrolumab group and 0 in a placebo group). One spontaneous abortion 
was assessed by the investigator as related to methotrexate. The applicant further clarified and discussed 
the  possible  reasons  for  the  spontaneous  abortions  seen  in  the  anifrolumab  SLE  clinical  programme. 
Narratives were also provided for the four reported cases.  
2.5.8.6.  Immunological events 
Description of bioanalytical methods 
An  MSD  electrochemiluminescent,  solution-phase,  bridging  immunoassay  is  used  for  the  detection, 
confirmation,  and  titration  of  anti-anifrolumab  antibodies  in  human  serum.  Diluted  samples  were 
incubated overnight in solution with a mixture of biotinylated anifrolumab and ruthenium (sulfo-TAG)-
labelled anifrolumab. Bridged biotin drug:ADA:sulfo-TAG drug complexes were subsequently captured 
onto streptavidin-coated plates (MSD) and measured on the MSD Sector Imager. 
Method  validations  followed  the  guidelines  in  FDA's  May  2001  Guidance  for  Industry  on  Bioanalytical 
Method Validation and/or FDA’s December 2009 Draft Guidance for Industry on Assay Development for 
Immunogenicity Testing of Therapeutic Proteins. 
A  plate-specific  cut  points  were  determined  as  recommended  by  Shankar  et  al.,  2008.  No  significant 
differences were observed between NHS, scleroderma and SLE matrixes. During the validation several 
samples  were  confirmed  positive  without  exposure  to  the  drug.  The applicant explains  this  with  false 
positive results by possible matrix interference and potential aggregation of the ruthenylated reagents.  
Anti-drug antibody incidence and prevalence 
Immunogenicity was investigated both in the primary safety pool from the two phase III studies (in total 
359 patients in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and 365 patients in the placebo group) and in the phase 
III long-term pool (N=372, of which 259 in the anifrolumab arm).  
In  the  primary  safety  pool,  ADA  positivity  at  any  visit  was  seen  in  7.0%  [25/359  patients]  in  the 
anifrolumab and 9.6% [35/365 patients] in the placebo group. Unexpectedly, ADA were already present 
at baseline in 3.7 % of subjects in the anifrolumab group and 1.1 % in the placebo group. The incidence 
of ADA, defined as ADA positive post baseline or boosted pre-existing baseline titres, was low in both 
treatment groups but unexpectedly higher in the placebo group: 1.7% [6/352] and 4.8% [17/357] for 
anifrolumab and placebo groups, respectively. Oddly, the incidence of nAb was also higher in the placebo 
group even though overall very low: 1/359 patients in the anifrolumab group and 6/365 in the placebo 
group. 
The  phase  III  long-term  ADA  data  (N=372,  of  which  259  in  the  anifrolumab  arm)  were  the  primary 
source  of  long-term  immunogenicity  assessment.  In  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group,  18/259  (6.9%) 
patients were ADA positive compared with 11/113 (9.7%) patients in the placebo group. One subject in 
the placebo group developed transient nAb and none in the anifrolumab group developed nAb. 
Similar to the primary safety pool, the observed incidence of ADA was overall smaller in the anifrolumab 
arm vs. placebo arm in the long-term ADA pool (Figure 24).

Figure 24 
long-term ADA pool (full analysis set) 
Cumulative percentage of patients with positive ADA results by timepoint - phase III 
The  applicant  was  requested  to  discuss  the  reasons  for  presence  of  ADA  in  subjects  not  exposed  to 
anifrolumab and higher incidence of ADA in the placebo group than active group. During scientific advice 
in 2018, the CHMP recommended measures to quantify the contribution of potential matrix effect caused 
by rheumatoid factor on ADA results. The applicant clarified that, after the scientific advice, appropriate 
changes were made to the assay to mitigate the observed high false-positive rate. A possible reason for 
false  positive  results  was  identified  to  be  potential  aggregation  in  the  ruthenylated  reagent.  With  the 
improved ADA assay, incidence of false positive results is lower, although false positive results are still 
obtained. The applicant informed that one patient had a reduction in the inhibitory effect of anifrolumab 
on type I IFN PD signature proportional to the ADA titre.  
ADA and PK 
No  comparison  of  PK  for  ADA-positive  and  ADA-negative  subjects  was  prespecified  in  the  statistical 
analysis plans for the Phase 3 trials due to the expected low number of ADA-positive subjects. However, 
the potential impact of ADA on PK was reviewed in individual phase 1, 2 and 3 studies and in the primary 
safety pool (of phase 3 studies) and long-term ADA pool. The PK profiles were similar in ADA positive 
and  negative  subject  both  in  the  primary  safety  pool  with  25/332  ADA-positive  among  subjects  who 
received  anifrolumab  and  in  the  long-term  ADA  pool  with  18/241  ADA-positive  subjects  in  the 
anifrolumab  group  (data  not  shown  for  brevity).  The  estimated  CL  in  ADA  positive  and  ADA  negative 
patients was found to be similar regardless of ADA status also in population PK analyses (data not shown 
for brevity). 
ADA and PD 
Expression of the type I IFN PD signature was measured during the clinical development programme and 
analysed  to  determine  if  ADAs  cause  any  inhibition  on  binding  of  anifrolumab  to  IFNAR1  and  hence 
neutralization of its activity. 
In the primary safety pool, of the 25 ADA-positive patients in the anifrolumab group, 19 ADA-positive 
patients were positive already at baseline and 6/25 had treatment-emergent ADA. Persistent ADA were 
ween  in  4  subjects  in  the  anifrolumab  group  and  5  in  the  placebo  group.  In  the  4  persistently  ADA-
positive patients given anifrolumab, the median PD effect (as measured by percent neutralization of the 
type I IFN PD signature compared with baseline) was less than that observed in ADA negative patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 172/198 
 
 
 
 
However,  this  was  interpreted  to  be  due  to  early  discontinuation  in  2  patients  and  lack  of  elevated 
expression in type I IFN PD signature at baseline in the remaining 2 patients, and not related to ADA. 
In  the  long-term  ADA  pool,  the  median  PD  effect  was  comparable  in  ADA-positive  and  ADA-negative 
subjects in the anifrolumab 300 mg group. 
ADA and efficacy 
In the primary safety pool, the proportion of patients with a BICLA response at Week 52 in ADA-positive 
patients compared with ADA-negative patients was 36.2% (9/25) vs 48.4% (162/334) in the anifrolumab 
group and 17.9% (6/35) vs 32.6% (106/330) in the placebo group. The proportion of patients with an 
SRI(4) response at Week 52 in ADA-positive patients compared with ADA-negative patients was 48.3% 
(12/25) vs 52.6% (176/334) in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and 27.8% (9/35) vs 41.9% (138/330) 
in  the  placebo  group.  Consequently,  the  proportion of  subjects  achieving  BICLA  and  SRI(4)  response 
was slightly higher in ADA negative subjects than ADA positive subjects in both anifrolumab and placebo 
groups.  Due  to  the  small  number  of  ADA  positive  subjects,  no  firm  conclusions  on  any  potential 
association between presence of ADA and treatment response can be drawn.  
ADA and safety 
In the primary safety pool, the incidence of any adverse event (AE) during treatment was greater in the 
anifrolumab 300 mg group (88.3%) than in the placebo group (80.8%). The incidence of AE was similar 
in  ADA-positive  and  ADA-negative  subjects:  88.0%  vs  89.2%  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  and 
82.9% vs 81.8% in the placebo group. In the anifrolumab group, 4.0 % of ADA-positive vs. 12.6 % of 
ADA-negative subjects reported SAE. The corresponding proportions of subjects reporting SAE were 37.1 
%  and  17.0 %  of  ADA-positive  and  ADA-negative  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  All  deaths  (2  in  the 
anifrolumab 300 mg group and 1 in the placebo group) occurred in ADA-negative subjects. 
In  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group,  12.0%  (3/25)  ADA-positive  patients  versus  4.5%  (15/334)  ADA-
negative patients had at least one AE leading to discontinuation of drug (DAE), whereas in the placebo 
group, 14.3% (5/35) versus 5.2% (17/330), respectively, had at least one DAE. No pattern was seen 
between ADA status and incidence of AESI. 
There was no apparent trend or pattern suggesting a correlation between the presence of anifrolumab 
ADA and occurrence of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis events in the Phase III studies (data not shown 
for brevity). 
In  the  phase  III  long-term  ADA  pool,  the  proportion  of  ADA-positive  patients  with  any  AE  was  lower 
compared  with  ADA-negative  patients  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  (83.3%  vs  95.0%)  but  was 
comparable between ADA categories in the placebo group (90.9% vs 93.1% for ADA-positive and ADA-
negative  patients,  respectively).  The  incidence  of  SAEs  in  ADA-positive  patients  compared  with  ADA-
negative patients was 33.3% (6/18 patients) versus 19.9% (48/241) in the anifrolumab 300 mg group 
and 36.4% (4/11) versus 28.4% (29/102) in the placebo group. In the anifrolumab 300 mg group, no 
ADA-positive  patients  versus  3.7%  (9/241)  ADA-negative  patients  had  at  least  one  DAE,  and  9.1% 
(1/11) versus 3.9% [4/102], respectively, in the placebo group had at least one DAE. 
The incidence of hypersensitivity and infusion reactions overall were consistently more numerous in the 
anifrolumab 300 mg treatment group than in the placebo group, although no severe cases were seen 
and with a low incidence of SAEs (0.3%). One patient with an anaphylactic reaction in the anifrolumab 
150 mg group (study 5) was reported in the anifrolumab development programme. Upon request, the 
applicant  provided  further  data  on  the  timing  of  hypersensitivity  events,  including  infusion-related 
reactions. In the supportive safety pool, all hypersensitivity reactions in the anifrolumab 300 mg group 
did indeed occur only during the first 6 treatment courses that is between infusion 1 and infusion 6, and 
majority of these during the first 2 infusions. The mean time to the onset of the first hypersensitivity 
Assessment report

reaction was shorter in the anifrolumab 300 mg group, 46.4 days (SD: 50.64) in comparison to that in 
the placebo group, 93.0 days (SD: 60.53). 
In  both  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  and  the  placebo  group,  more  patients  experienced  infusion-
related  reactions  with  the  initial  infusions  (Infusions  1  and  2)  and  the  incidence  of  infusion-related 
reactions decreased with subsequent infusions, acknowledging the overall small number of events in the 
placebo treatment group. 
Any possible association of ADAs and safety issues cannot be assessed reliably as the ADA results are 
compromised  by  unspecific  binding  to  matrix  proteins  and  potential  aggregation  of  the  ruthenylated 
reagents.  
2.5.8.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Primary and supportive safety pools  
The  proportion  of  patients  with  DAEs  was  low  and  balanced  between  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group 
(4.7%) and placebo group (4.9%) in the primary safety pool with no PT or SOC predominating (Table 
66). 
In  the  primary  safety  pool,  the  most  commonly  reported  DAEs  by  SOC  were  in  the  Infections  and 
infestations category with no PT predominating. The incidence of DAEs in the supportive safety pool was 
similar to the primary safety pool.

a Risk difference is the difference between the EAIRs per 100 PY   (anifrolumab 300 mg group– placebo group). The definition of each pool and 
details of treatment groups within each pool are described in SAP Section 2.2.1. If not stated otherwise, percentages are based upon all patients in 
the safety analysis set within the respective pool and treatment group. An AE during treatment is defined as an AE with a date of onset ≥ day of first 
ever dose of IP and ≤ minimum ((last dosing date + 28 days), end of study date, death date). Adverse events are coded using MedDRA version 22.1. 
Patients with multiple events in the same category are counted only once in that category. Patients with events in more than one category are counted 
once in each of those categories. AEs are sorted by descending frequency of SOC and PT in the anifrolumab group. The EAIR per 100 PY is defined 
as the number of patients with the specific event divided by the total exposure time in years and then multiplied by 100. The exposure time is defined 
as from the date of first administration of IP to the date of first event, death, end of treatment + 28 days, or end of study, whichever comes first. AE

Phase III long-term safety data 
There was no evidence for an increase in rate of discontinuations over time in the phase III long-term 
safety data. As observed during the 52-week treatment period, rates of DAEs in the phase III long-term 
safety data were low and similar between the anifrolumab 300 mg group (3.1/100 PY) and placebo group 
(4.3/100 PY).

2.5.8.8.  Post marketing experience 
As  of  the  date  of  submission  of  the  application,  anifrolumab  has  not  been  marketed  anywhere in  the 
world; therefore, no post marketing data are available for anifrolumab. 
2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The primary safety pool includes the two phase 3 studies, and the supportive safety pool in addition the 
phase 2 study. 
The safety evaluation of anifrolumab IV 300 mg Q4W over 52 weeks was based on a primary safety pool 
and a supportive safety pool. The primary safety pool included two phase III studies (study 04 and study 
05). The supportive safety pool included study 04, study 05, and a phase II placebo-controlled study 
(study 1013). 
The  evaluation  of  the  long-term  safety  profile  of  anifrolumab  IV  300  mg  Q4W  over  up  to  4  years  of 
treatment  was  based  on  the  phase  III  long-term  safety  data.  The  phase  III  long-term  safety  data 
included studies 04 and 05 plus interim data from study D3461C00009 (study 09). Study 09 was a phase 
III extension study that enrolled patients who completed study 04 or study 05. Study IA-MEDI-546-1145 
(study 1145) was an open-label extension study for patients who completed study 1013.  
Study 09 is ongoing and the applicant provided, upon CHMP’s request, updated safety data (data cut-off 
date of 19 March 2020) from this study 9. In addition, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) includes the 
most recent patient exposure data from this study with a data-lock date in March 2020. For this study 
09, a clinical study report (CSR) has not yet been prepared since this is interim data only. The submission 
of the final study report for the long-term extension study 09 is Q2 2022 (see RMP Section 2.6).   
Overall, the exposure to anifrolumab can be considered acceptable, as the numbers exceed the ICH E1 
recommendations  for  >  6  months  of  exposure  (300  to  600  patients)  and  >  1  year  of  exposure  (100 
patients). This exposure would appear adequate to evaluate the safety profile of anifrolumab in patients 
with  SLE,  a  chronic  disease  with  an  estimated  global  prevalence  of  6.5  to  178.0  cases  per  100000 
persons).  
Overall, demographic characteristics and baseline disease characteristics are generally balanced between 
the  primary  and  supportive  safety  pool  and  also  between  the  two  treatment  arms.  The  majority  of 
patients were white female with a mean age of about 41 years old, which is in line with the mean age of 
onset  of  SLE  disease  and  subjects  ≥  65  years  are  underrepresented.  Most  patients  had  more  severe 
disease (SLEDAI 2K score of ≥ 10) and were classified as type I IFN gene signature test high at screening 
(82.6%). Ninety point one per cent (90.1%) were anti-nuclear antibody positive, but less than half of 
patients at baseline (44.4% and 40.2%) were anti-dsDNA positive and had abnormal C3 levels (36.8% 
and 23.3%) in primary and supportive safety pool, respectively, suggesting a prevalence of patients with 
less active disease at baseline. Regarding SLE treatment at baseline, in the primary safety pool, 81.9% 
of patients were treated with OCS at a mean dose of 11.54 mg/day and approximately 69.0% were in 
combination  with  immunosuppressants  and/or  anti-malarials,  which  is  not  unexpected  in  a 
moderate/severe disease. 
Potential  safety  concerns  related  to  the  mechanism  of  action  of  anifrolumab  include  those  associated 
with  immunomodulation,  for  example  serious/opportunistic  infection,  viral  infection  (including 
reactivation),  and  malignancy.  Potential  concerns  associated  with  protein-based  infusion  therapies 
include anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactions, and infusion-related reactions. 
In the primary safety pool, the overall incidence of any AE during treatment was somewhat higher in the 
anifrolumab 300 mg group (88.3%) than in the placebo group (80.8%). Most AEs were mild, 141 AEs

(in  39.2%  of  patients)  vs  140  (38.4%)  or  moderate  150  (41.7%)  vs  128  (35.1%)  in  intensity,  with 
similar incidences also of severe cases, 27 (7.5%) vs 27 (7.4%), in the anifrolumab vs placebo groups, 
respectively. 
The SOC with the greatest frequency of AEs in the anifrolumab group was Infections and infestations, 
71.7% vs 57.8% in the anifrolumab and placebo groups, respectively. 
The most common AEs by PT (≥ 5% difference or at least 5% incidence and twice the frequency) in the 
anifrolumab  300  mg  group  vs.  the  placebo  group  were:  nasopharyngitis  (17.8%  vs  11.2%),  upper 
respiratory tract infection (16.9% vs 9.9%), bronchitis (10.6% vs 4.7%), herpes zoster (6.4% vs 1.4%), 
and  arthralgia  (5.6%  vs  2.2%).    The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  during  anifrolumab 
treatment (studies 4, 5 and 1013 pooled) were upper respiratory tract infection (34%), bronchitis (11%), 
infusion-related reaction (9.4%) and herpes zoster (6.1%).  The AEs reported and assessed as related 
more commonly than unrelated to IP by investigators in anifrolumab 300 mg group for each safety pool 
were, in terms of EAIR: infusion related reactions (in the phase III long term safety pool: EAIR related 
5.7/100 PY vs unrelated 1/100 PY), herpes zoster (in the phase III long term safety pool: EAIR related 
3/100 PY vs unrelated 1.8/100 PY) and hypersensitivity (in the phase III long term safety pool: EAIR 
related 1.5/100 PY vs unrelated 0.4/100 PY). Other AEs most commonly reported as related to IP by 
investigators  were:  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  nasopharyngitis  and  bronchitis.  These  AEs  are 
adequately reported in the SmPC. 
In the supportive safety pool and consistently also in long-term safety data (up to 4 years of treatment), 
the overall anifrolumab safety profile was comparable to that of the primary safety pool. In the by study 
comparisons (studies 04, 05, and 1013), the most common AEs by PT in the anifrolumab and placebo 
treatment  groups  were  generally  similar.  If  discrepancies  were  seen,  no  plausible  reason  was  clearly 
evident. 
Overall,  there  were  9  deaths  during  the  anifrolumab  clinical  studies  in  the  anifrolumab  development 
programme. Four deaths in the anifrolumab (three pneumonia and one colitis) and three (MI, pulmonary 
hypertension and encephalitis) in the control group, were reported with the initial MAA. Two (2) additional 
deaths occurred in study 09 from 02 August 2019 to 19 March 2020, both in the anifrolumab 300 mg 
group. The fatal outcome event was pneumonia in one case and myocarditis in the other one. Both have 
been considered as unrelated to IP by the investigator. Only two of the deaths from pneumonia were 
considered related to the study drug. One death from macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), colitis 
and portal vein thrombosis was reported in a patient, who received a single dose of 1000mg anifrolumab 
(study 1013). The death was judged to not be related to the study treatment. MAS has been reported in 
most rheumatic diseases, including SLE and rather than being a consequence of a specific mechanism in 
these  conditions,  concomitant  immunosuppression  and  infections  are  thought  to  be  likely  triggering 
factors.  The  applicant  discussed  the  biology/pathophysiology  behind  this  syndrome  with  reference  to 
anifrolumab  and  re-evaluated  the  possible  causes  of  this  death  from  MAS  and  colitis,  with  special 
reference to immunosuppression and possible infections. On the basis of the currently available data, it 
appears unlikely that anifrolumab treatment would increase the existing risk of MAS in patients with SLE 
and, thus, the CHMP considered that MAS appears not to be a current safety concern for anifrolumab.  
Deaths  in  anifrolumab  groups  are  often  associated  with  infections,  mainly  pneumonia.  Hence,  at  the 
CHMP’s request, the Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to specify that serious and sometimes 
fatal infections have occurred in patients receiving anifrolumab.  
Overall, in the primary and supportive safety pools and the phase 3 long-term data, fewer SAEs were 
reported  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  than  the  placebo groups  quite  consistently.  Most  common 
SAEs in the anifrolumab group were infections and in the control placebo group SLE. Pneumonia was 
most common, but the rate was lower than in placebo. HZ was the most common with a rate higher than 
in the placebo group. The SAE pattern appeared to be similar in short and long-term safety data. Analysis

of  long-term phase 3  data  by  PT  and  time  interval  (from  year  1  to  4)  did  not appear  to  indicate  any 
change in the overall SAE incidence over time up to 4 years. In the long-term pneumonia and SLE are 
confirmed to be the most frequent SAEs, followed by herpes zoster. Even if with a slightly lower rate 
compared to placebo, pneumonia were the most frequent SAEs by PT in anifrolumab group and were 
also  fatal  in  three  patients  (of  which  two  were  considered  related  to  IP),  suggesting  a  possible  more 
severe  course  in  anifrolumab  treated  patients.  The  applicant  provided  a  list  of  all  patients  in  the 
supportive  pool  who  had  a  pneumonia  SAE  during  treatment,  along  with  patient  characteristics  and 
potential  risk  factors  for  pneumonia.  Overall,  no important  differences  in  patient’s  characteristics  and 
risk  factors  were  noted  between  patients  with  pneumonia  SAEs  in  the  anifrolumab  group  and  in  the 
placebo group.  
In the primary safety pool, the incidence of discontinuations from anifrolumab due to AEs (DAE) was low 
for  this  type  of  studies,  and  similar  across  treatment  groups,  17  (4.7%)  and  18  (4.9%),  in  the 
anifrolumab  and  placebo  treatment  groups,  respectively.  The  most  commonly  reported  DAEs  by  SOC 
were in the Infections and infestations category: 7 (1.9%) vs. 3 (0.8%) in the anifrolumab and placebo 
treatment  groups,  respectively.  At  PT  level,  two  discontinuations  were  ascribed  to  herpes  zoster 
infections, while the remaining discontinuations were single occurrences. There was no evidence for an 
increase in rate of discontinuations over time in the phase III long-term safety data. The incidence of 
DAEs in the supportive safety pool was similar to that of the primary safety pool. 
Based on the mode of action of anifrolumab and the provided safety data, infections are a safety concern 
for  anifrolumab  treatment,  also  in  long-term.  More  than  half  of  patients  in  the  primary  safety  pool 
experienced infections, with a higher frequency in the anifrolumab 300 mg (71.7%) compared to placebo 
(57.8%) group. The majority of infections were mild or moderate in intensity. The EAIRs of infections 
seems to decrease in the long-term. In the primary safety pool, serious infections (non-opportunistic) 
were less frequent in anifrolumab 300 mg (4.4%) than in placebo (6%) group and this was confirmed in 
the long-term safety pool where it remained constant by yearly intervals. Discontinuations due to SAE 
were rare, with only single occurrences in each treatment group. Opportunistic infections were also rare. 
In the anifrolumab 300 mg group pneumonia was the most frequent event followed by herpes zoster 
and pyelonephritis (0.8%, 3 patients). The events of serious pyelonephritis was further characterised by 
the  applicant,  but  due  to  the  presence  of  concomitant  confounding  factors,  a  clear  association  of 
anifrolumab with the events of pyelonephritis cannot be drawn. This issue was not further pursued by 
the CHMP. 
Although  no  cases  of  active  TB  were  reported  during  any  of  the  clinical  studies,  exposure-adjusted 
incidence of latent TB AEs reported during anifrolumab treatment showed an increasing trend with time, 
measured at yearly intervals. According to exclusion criteria of the phase III studies, a warning on TB 
was  added  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  with  appropriate  precautions  to  be  taken  before  starting 
anifrolumab treatment.  
In the primary safety pool, there was an increased incidence of herpes zoster infections in patients in 
the anifrolumab treatment arm: 23 (6.4%), compared to 5 (1.4%) the placebo arm. Most occurrences 
were cutaneous, mild or moderate in severity, not serious and did not lead to discontinuation. This finding 
was quite consistent throughout the safety data. In addition, two cases of cutaneous disseminated herpes 
zoster  were  also  reported.  All  responded  to  treatment  and  generally  resolved  without  sequelae. 
Approximately half (12/23) events had an early onset, during the first 12 weeks of treatment; however, 
herpes zoster events were reported up to 52 weeks. This finding was quite consistent throughout the 
anifrolumab safety database.  
In the supportive safety pool two patients were PCR positive for HZV in the cerebrospinal fluid although 
in  the  absence  of  cutaneous  lesions  suggestive  of  herpes  zoster.  In  the  first  case,  the  investigator 
assessed the event of herpes zoster SAE and the myelitis transverse SAE as unrelated to anifrolumab, 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 178/198 
 
 
 
while the second case of HZ meningitis was judged as moderate in intensity and related to IP by the 
investigator. Even if the applicant does not consider that there is a certain causal relationship between 
anifrolumab  and  the  event  of  myelitis  transverse,  it  is  considered  to  be  very  likely  by  the  CHMP  and 
cannot be ruled out.  
In the long term EAIR of herpes zoster AEs was highest in the first 52 weeks of treatment (7.3/100 PY) 
and decreased slightly during Year 2 and Year 3 (4.1 and 4.7/100 PY), with no events observed during 
Year 4. The majority were mild or moderate, but 7 patients experienced a SAE of herpes zoster.  
Overall, increase in herpes zoster-infections could be seen as an indicator of potential for reactivation of 
pre-existing chronic viral infections by anifrolumab. Whether anifrolumab treatment could activate other 
types of chronic viral infections, such as chronic hepatitis or the John Cunningham (JC)-virus, remains 
currently unknown. During the AHEG, the experts indicated that the long-term safety profile would need 
to be carefully monitored and recommended to further look into recommendations for vaccination against 
herpes zoster. In addition, considering the mechanism of action of anifrolumab (interferon I blocker), 
the  experts  recommended  to  follow-up  in  the  long  term  on  the  possible  increase  of,  mainly  atypical, 
mycobacterial  infections.  The  risk  of  herpes  zoster  in  anifrolumab  treated  patients  (including 
disseminated herpes zoster events) is adequately described in the SmPC. Indeed, it was considered of 
importance that physicians are aware of the possible occurrence of a herpes zoster infection showing 
neurological symptoms also in absence of cutaneous lesions. 
There was some uncertainty on the possible effect of concomitant treatment, namely corticosteroids, on 
the incidence of infections. A protocol based secondary endpoint of the controlled phase 2 and 3 studies 
was the ability of anifrolumab to reduce corticosteroid use, thus tapering was integral to the study design. 
The safety data on infections was re-analysed and appeared not to be confounded by corticosteroid use. 
In conclusion, the risk of infections is adequately described in the Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Serious infection is included as an important potential risk in the RMP and adequate post authorisation 
studies are planned to better assess this risk (see Section 2.6). 
The  incidence  of  AEs  of  influenza  were  similar  between  anifrolumab  300  mg  and  placebo  group  and 
among different safety pools. Two (2) patients in anifrolumab 300 mg compared to 1 in placebo group 
had a SAE of influenza both. The event rates for influenza in the supportive safety pool were similar in 
the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  [12  patients  (2.6%;  EAIR:  2.9/100  PY)]  and  in  the  placebo  group  [9 
patients  (1.9%;  EAIR:  2.3/100  PY)].  Moreover,  2  patients  in  anifrolumab  300  mg  compared  to  1  in 
placebo group had a SAE of influenza. Apparently, these data suggest a similar risk of influenza in the 
two  groups.  However,  data  reported  by  the  applicant  show  that  a  higher  rate  of  patients  in  the 
anifrolumab 300 mg group [37 patients (8.1%)] than in the placebo group [23 patients (4.9%)] received 
seasonal influenza vaccines during the study, maybe preventing from further events of influenza and/or 
reducing the seriousness of the events. However, considering that a general warning on immunisations 
is included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC, this was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
Concerning  other  AEs  of  special  interest,  the  applicant  performed  analyses  of  hypersensitivity, 
anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions. In the primary safety pool, there were more AEs categorised 
as  hypersensitivity  reactions  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  than  the  placebo  group:  12  patients 
(3.3%) and 3 patients (0.8%), respectively. All hypersensitivity AEs were mild or moderate in intensity, 
and resolved spontaneously or with symptomatic treatment. One patient in the anifrolumab group had 
a hypersensitivity SAE, which was treated. The patient continued the study treatment, with prophylaxis 
given for subsequent infusions. One patient in the placebo group had a hypersensitivity AE that led to 
discontinuation of treatment. During the 52-week treatment period, all hypersensitivity AEs occurred in 
the first 24 weeks of treatment. The incidence of hypersensitivity events in the supportive safety pool 
were similar to that of the primary safety pool. As hypersensitivity reactions are usually more common 
early on in treatment, usually within few days or weeks of treatment, the applicant was requested to 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 179/198 
 
 
 
present  hypersensitivity  reactions  also  by  treatment  course  and  provide  the  mean  times  to  onset  of 
symptoms. In the supportive safety pool, all hypersensitivity reactions in the anifrolumab 300 mg group 
did indeed occur only during the first 6 treatment courses, that is between infusion 1 and infusion 6. The 
mean  time  to  the  onset  of  the  first  hypersensitivity  reaction  was  shorter  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg 
group, 46.4 days (SD: 50.64) in comparison to that in the placebo group, 93.0 days (SD: 60.53).  
In  the  primary  safety  pool,  incidence  of  infusion-related  reactions  through  52  weeks  was  higher  in 
patients on anifrolumab 300 mg compared to those treated with placebo group (11.4% vs 7.4%), all 
being  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity,  with  no  serious  reactions.  One  patient  in  the  placebo  group  and 
none  in  the  anifrolumab  group  discontinued.  During  the  52-week  treatment  period,  most  reactions 
occurred  in  the  first  24  weeks  of  treatment.  The  most  common  symptoms  related  to  infusion-related 
reactions (reported in ≥ 5% of events) in the anifrolumab 300 mg group were headache (45.6%), nausea 
(22.8%),  vomiting  (7.6%),  and  fatigue  (5.1%).  In  the  supportive  safety  pool,  at  least  one  infusion-
related reaction was reported for 43 patients (9.4%) in the anifrolumab 300 mg group and for 33 patients 
(7.1%)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  majority  of  infusion-related  reactions  occurred  during  the  first  2 
infusions with the incidence of these reactions decreasing with subsequent infusions in both the active 
and the placebo groups. All of the infusion-related reactions in the supportive safety pool were also mild 
or moderate in intensity. 
Overall, the data indicate quite consistently that the incidence of hypersensitivity and infusion-reactions 
was higher in the anifrolumab treatment group than in the placebo group. Although with no severe cases 
seen and SAEs were reported with a low incidence of 0.3%. one anaphylactic reaction was reported in 
study 05 in a patient on anifrolumab 150 mg treatment. The reactions occurred mainly in the first 24-
weeks, with a decline in incidence over time. On this background, the applicant has included adequate 
warning on hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions in the Section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Malignancies  are  reported  with  a  higher  incidence in  patients  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  arm than  in 
placebo arm both in primary (1.4% vs 0.8%) and supportive safety pool (1.3% vs 0.6%), which is of 
concern,  even  if  4  malignancies  reported  within  180  days  of  the  first  exposure  to  anifrolumab,  were 
considered by the applicant as likely pre-existing. The rate of malignancies seems to not increase over 
time in the long term (1.7% vs 1.1%). Malignancies are included in the RMP as important potential risk 
(see Section 2.6) and a warning has been included in the 4.4 section of the SmPC. Due to the higher 
incidence of malignancies observed in the 52-week studies and the plausibility of anifrolumab mechanism 
of action in the loss of IFN tumour surveillance, a careful post-marketing surveillance is of importance 
and a post authorisation safety study will be conducted.  
Concerning  laboratory  findings,  the  mean  haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  and  urine  analysis  results 
were generally similar or lower between the anifrolumab 300 mg and placebo groups at baseline and at 
Week 52. There were no clinically meaningful differences or trends between the treatment arms. In long 
term, the findings were similar, except that in the 52-week time period hyperglycaemia was seen more 
often  in  the  anifrolumab  patients,  even  though  at  present  firm  conclusion  on  an  association  with 
anifrolumab treatment could not be drawn. Vital signs, physical examination and ECG results showed 
not no clinically significant changes. 
In subgroup analyses (primary safety pool), the overall safety profile was consistent across all predefined 
subgroups. No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the frequency or pattern of AEs. The 
safety  profile  of  anifrolumab  was  generally  similar  also  in  patients  with  IFN  gene  signature  high, 
compared  with  low,  for  up  to  52  weeks  of  treatment.  Also,  consistently  higher,  at  least  numerically, 
incidences  for  herpes  zoster  infections  were  seen  in  both  of  these  subpopulations  on  the  anifrolumab 
treatment.  
The applicant provided at CHMP’s request the most common AEs and SAEs by BMI subgroups. Overall, 
the frequency of AEs and SAEs in anifrolumab 300 mg group was similar in patients with BMI ≤ or > 28 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 180/198 
 
 
 
kg/m2 (74.1% vs 79.4% and 9.8% vs 12.9%, respectively). Some numerical differences were noted; 
however,  there  was  not  a  clear  trend  in  the  AEs  and  SAEs  between  the  BMI  subgroups,  either  for 
anifrolumab or placebo. A higher rate of pneumonia was noted in anifrolumab 300 mg treated patients 
with BMI > 28 kg/m2 compared to the lower BMI group, both as AE and SAE. However, this difference 
is reported also for placebo arm suggesting an increased susceptibility of this subgroup of patients rather 
than a correlation with study drug. Hypersensitivity was more common in patients with BMI > 28 kg/m2 
compared to patients BMI ≤ 28 kg/m2 (6.4% vs 1.5%, respectively). However, it was reported as a SAE 
in only one patient. Hence, this issue was not further pursued by the CHMP. 
Furthermore,  at  the  CHMP’s  request  the  applicant  provided  AEs  and  SAEs  by  SLEDAI-2K  subgroups 
(SLEDAI-2K  scores  <  10  and  ≥  10  points),  both  in  the  anifrolumab  group  and  in  the  placebo  group. 
Overall,  AEs  were  similar  in  frequency  in  both  subgroups  and  no  clinically  important  differences  or 
particular trends were noted for different AEs, except HZ was more common in subgroup of patients with 
SLEDAI-2K ≥ 10 than in those with SLEDAI-2K scores < 10 in anifrolumab 300 mg group. SAEs were 
more frequent in patients with SLEDAI-2K scores≥ 10 at baseline compared to patients with SLEDAI-2K 
score  <  10,  in  anifrolumab  300  mg  treatment  group  as  well  in  placebo  group,  suggesting  that  SLE 
patients with a greater disease activity may be at higher risk of SAEs. At the moment, firm conclusions 
on  a  possible  association  of  disease  activity  and  risk  of  HZ,  cannot  be  drawn.  Immunosuppressant 
treatment is a confounding factor for the risk of HZ and the number of patients with SLEDAI-2K <10 and 
HZ is too limited for a clear comparison. It is stated in Section 4.4 of the SmPC that SLE patients also 
taking  immunosuppressants  may  be  at  higher  risk  of  herpes  zoster  infections.  This  is  considered 
acceptable to the CHMP.  
In the anifrolumab SLE clinical programme there were 31 patients with one or more pregnancy as of 01 
August  2019.  Of  those  31  patients,  20  patients  were  randomised  to  receive  anifrolumab.  Among  the 
patients who received anifrolumab and reported a pregnancy, no congenital anomalies associated with 
IP or no drug-associated AEs were observed. However, among these 31 pregnancies, there were 18 live 
births    (14  in  an  anifrolumab  group,  4  in  a  placebo  group),  9  elective  abortions  (7  in  an  anifrolumab 
group, 2 in a placebo group), and 4 spontaneous abortions (4 in an anifrolumab group and 0 in a placebo 
group).  One  spontaneous  abortion  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  related  to  methotrexate. 
Investigator  assessment  is  not  reported  in  two  cases.  The  causes  of  miscarriage  are  in  general 
multifactorial and the exact cause of most miscarriages remains often unknown. Furthermore, multiple 
confounders  are  at  play.  No  firm  conclusion  could  be  drawn  considering  the  lack  of  known  biological 
plausibility,  the  higher  risk  in  SLE  population,  the  presence  additional  risk  factors  of  advancing  age, 
hypothyroidism, endometriosis, and the concomitant use methotrexate which is contraindicated during 
pregnancy.  Hence,  the  evidence  to  suggest  causal  association  to  anifrolumab  treatment  for  the  four 
cases  of  spontaneous  abortions  seen  is  scarce.  However,  use  in  pregnancy  is  included  as  a  missing 
information in the RMP and this issue will be further followed-up post approval in a dedicated study (see 
Section 2.6). In addition, at the CHMP’s request, the sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC were revised to 
adequately communicate the risk (see also Non-clinical section 2.4).  
SLE patients have been reported to be at high risk of neuropsychiatric disorders. The mechanism is so 
far unclear, but chronic inflammation and immunomodulation have been put forward as possible causes. 
Thus, it has been suggested that anifrolumab, as an anti-IFNAR, could have protective effects on the 
neuropsychiatric  symptoms  of  SLE.  In  the  present  clinical  data,  overall,  there  appeared  to  be  no 
indication  of  an  increased  or  decreased  risk  of  depression  or  suicidality  in  the  anifrolumab  treated 
patients,  as  measured  by AEs  related  to  depression and  by  the  chosen  validated  instruments  (PHQ-8 
and C-SSRS), as no relevant differences between the study treatment groups were seen in the indices 
currently measured.  These results were not confounded by antidepressive medication. Hence, this issue 
was not pursued further by the CHMP.

No dedicated studies have been performed related to drug-drug interactions. No clinically relevant 
findings, for example interactions with concomitant medications, were evident from the available 
clinical trial data. Hence, this issue was not pursued further by the CHMP. 
No information on MACE events are available from study 09. No AEs of stroke or myocardial infarction 
was reported in study 1145 (N = 218). In this study MACE was not an AESI and was not adjudicated by 
an independent committee. This issue was not pursued further by the CHMP. 
Patients  with  SLE  are  at  risk  of  infections  and  additional  risk  may  be  posed  by  the  use  of 
immunosuppressive agents and corticosteroids required to treat the disease. Therefore, these patients 
are  potential  candidates  for  vaccinations.  No  vaccine  studies  in  anifrolumab  have  been  previously 
performed. Thus, it is not known whether subjects receiving anifrolumab are able to mount a sufficient, 
clinically significant positive immune response.  This risk is adequately reflected in Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC. Effects on responses to inactivated vaccines is listed as missing information in the RMP (section 
2.6)  and  the  applicant  will  conduct  a  post  authorisation  study  to  better  understand  the  impact  of 
anifrolumab  on  vaccination  responses,  including  measuring  antibody  concentrations.  The  applicant  is 
reminded that CHMP scientific advice may also be  sought on these issues (preferably at the planning 
stage of any study).  
As supportive analyses, the applicant also compared All anifrolumab (150, 300, and 1000 mg) vs placebo. 
The  safety  profile  in  the  All  anifrolumab  pool  was  overall  consistent  with  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  vs 
placebo analyses. There were more AEs of herpes zoster and latent TB in the all database. Uncommon 
events that were not reported in the primary, supportive, or long-term data, but were reported in the all 
anifrolumab group were 1 patient with an anaphylaxis AE (anifrolumab 150 mg group) and 3 patients 
with vasculitis AEs. Possible dose dependent trends were seen for herpes zoster infections and influenza, 
consistent with the mode of action of anifrolumab. 
In the pre-clinical programme, focal arteritis has been identified as a risk beyond the findings related to 
the pharmacological action of anifrolumab itself. In the current clinical phase 2 and phase 3 studies no 
vasculitis were seen in either of the treatment groups. Of note, however, is that of the uncommon events 
that were not reported in the primary, supportive, or long-term data, 3 cases of vasculitis were reported 
in the all anifrolumab pool. They were all non-serious, resolved prior to the next scheduled dose of IP, 
were  less  frequent  in  the  anifrolumab  group  (0.4%)  compared  to  placebo  group  (1%)  and  were 
considered not related to IP by the investigator.  The causes identified were infection, SLE and for one 
case it could not be specified. Moreover, 3 patients in the placebo group had AEs of vasculitis and one 
of these was serious. Therefore, based on the information provided, a clear association of vasculitis with 
anifrolumab cannot be drawn. Vasculitis (non-SLE) AE will be followed in the long-term study 9.  
The proportion of ADA positive subjects did not differ in the IFNGS(+) subgroup (type I interferon gene 
signature test high) compared with the total study population either in the primary safety pool or the 
long-term immunogenicity pool. The applicant was requested to discuss the reasons for presence of ADA 
in subjects not exposed to anifrolumab and higher incidence of ADA in the placebo group than active 
group. During scientific advice in 2018, the CHMP recommended measures to quantify the contribution 
of potential matrix effect caused by rheumatoid factor on ADA results. The applicant clarified that after 
the scientific advice, appropriate changes were made to the assay to mitigate the observed high false-
positive rate. A possible reason for false positive results was identified to be potential aggregation in the 
ruthenylated reagent. With the improved ADA assay, incidence of false positive results is lower, although 
false positive results are still obtained. The applicant informed that one patient had a reduction in the 
inhibitory effect of anifrolumab on efficacy proportional to the ADA titre, i.e. the ADAs were neutralising 
based  on  loss  of  type  I  IFN  PD  signature  suppression,  which  was  proportional  to  the  ADA  titre.  Any 
possible  association  of  ADAs  and  safety  issues  cannot  be  assessed  reliably  as  the  ADA  results  are 
compromised  by  unspecific  binding  to  matrix  proteins  and  potential  aggregation  of  the  ruthenylated

reagents. Therefore, at the CHMP’s request, the applicant’s original claim in the Section 4.8 of the SmPC 
of no relation of immunogenicity on efficacy was amended to a statement that the clinical relevance of 
the presence of anti-anifrolumab antibodies is not known.  
Considering the novel mechanism of action of anifrolumab and that there is no approved treatment with 
this pharmacological mechanism of action, the identification of long-term risks is important and will be 
made  via  the  Study  09.  The  provisions  for  long  term  safety  monitoring,  to  further  characterise  risks 
discussed in safety specification are made in the RMP.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Additional expert consultations 
The  CHMP  consulted  experts  in  SLE  and  statistics  to  provide  input  regarding  the  safety  profile.  Upon 
request from the CHMP, an ad hoc expert group meeting was convened on 07 December 2021. 
3. 
Please  discuss  whether  the  observed  safety  profile  of  anifrolumab  in  the  population 
studied  can  be  considered  acceptable,  and  whether  any  particular  measures  should  be 
considered for mitigation of risks. 
The experts agreed by consensus that the safety profile observed in the clinical trials was acceptable. 
The long-term safety profile would need to be carefully monitored.  
Considering the safety data, the experts suggested to look into recommendations for vaccination against 
herpes zoster. In addition, considering the mechanism of action of anifrolumab (interferon I blocker), 
the  experts  recommended  to  follow-up  in  the  long  term  on  the  possible  increase  of,  mainly  atypical, 
mycobacterial infections. They also mentioned to potentially recommend or consider screening for latent 
TB at treatment initiation; although it was recognised that no issue was identified in the current results.   
2.5.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The key studies within the clinical development programme for anifrolumab comprise two Phase 3 studies 
and a large Phase 2 study. All three studies had a 52-week double-blind placebo-controlled treatment 
period and were generally similar in design. Within the application, 12-month safety data is provided for 
these three key studies. The primary safety pool included two phase III studies (study 04 and study 05). 
The  supportive  safety  pool  included  study  04  and  study  05,  and  a  phase  II  placebo-controlled  study 
(study  1013).  Long-term  data  was  from  the  ongoing  long-term  extension  study  09  of  the  phase  III 
studies. 
Of the overall 1029 SLE subjects exposed to anifrolumab in the applicant development programme, at 
least 837 patients with SLE were exposed to IV anifrolumab, including 688 patients for ≥ 52 weeks with 
a total exposure to anifrolumab IV 150, 300, or 1000 mg in SLE patients (1888.2 PY). Of these 459 were 
exposed  to  the  proposed  dose  of  300  mg  for  at  least  the  52  weeks.  Up  to  19  March  2020,  the  total 
exposure to anifrolumab IV 150, 300, or 1000 mg in SLE patients increased from 1888.2 PY to 2091.9 
PY, including 548 patients exposed to anifrolumab for ≥ 104 weeks.  
The overall exposure of anifrolumab appears adequate for the assessment of safety. The overall safety 
profile of anifrolumab seems to include an increased risk for infections (including herpes zoster), as well 
as for hypersensitivity and infusion-related events. Otherwise, anifrolumab seems to be well tolerated, 
with relatively similar number of AEs, SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs when compared to placebo.

Adequate warnings are included in the SmPC and those risks will be followed-up in the post-authorisation 
setting (See RMP section 2.6). 
The long-term safety profile would need to be carefully monitored and adequate measures have been 
put in place (see RMP section 2.6). 
This was agreed by the AHEG as the experts agreed by consensus that the safety profile observed in the 
clinical trials was acceptable. 
In conclusion, the overall safety of anifrolumab in treatment of SLE is acceptable.

2.6.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 1.4 is acceptable. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 30.07.2021. The new EURD list entry will therefore 
use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Saphnelo  (anifrolumab)  is  included  in  the 
additional  monitoring  list  as  it  contains  a  new  active  substance  which,  on  1  January  2011,  was  not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant has sought marketing authorisation for anifrolumab for the following indication: 
Anifrolumab  is  indicated  as  an  add-on  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  moderate  to 
severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), despite standard therapy. 
Assessment report

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
SLE is a chronic, multisystem, disabling autoimmune rheumatic disease of unknown aetiology. Clinical 
manifestations of SLE can include constitutional symptoms, alopecia and rashes, serositis, inflammatory 
arthritis,  renal  disease,  systemic  vasculitis,  lymphadenopathy,  splenomegaly,  haemolytic  anaemia, 
cognitive dysfunction, and other central nervous system involvement. Arthritis and photosensitive skin 
rash  are  common  presenting  features.  Patients  may  present  with  a  single  or  a  variety  of  clinical 
manifestations.  The  manifestations  and  progression  of  SLE  are  unpredictable  and  include  periods  of 
chronic activity, clinically inactive periods, and phases with heightened disease activity (‘disease flares’). 
Due  to  the  variable  nature  of  the  disease  and  its  treatment,  patients  experience  reduced  physical 
function, loss of employment, and significantly worse health-related quality of life. According to a recent 
patient survey, severe fatigue was ranked as one of their most burdensome symptoms. 
Most of the current therapies for SLE are non-specific and inhibit broad inflammatory pathways. For mild 
disease, first line treatments include anti-malarials (hydroxychloroquine) and oral corticosteroids (OCSs; 
e.g., prednisone). NSAIDs are used for temporary symptom control, but, in contrast to glucocorticoids 
and  immunosuppressants,  have  no  impact  on  disease  progression.  Steroids  remain  a  mainstay  of 
treatment for mild to severe disease. Additional treatment options for moderate to severe disease include 
immunosuppressants,  such  as  methotrexate,  azathioprine,  and  mycophenolate  mofetil.  Each  of  these 
classes of agents are however associated with potentially significant toxicity and are sometimes poorly 
tolerated. 
The  only  targeted  therapy  for  SLE  is  belimumab  (Benlysta),  a  monoclonal  antibody  targeting  soluble 
human B Lymphocyte Stimulator protein. Belimumab blocks the binding of soluble BLyS, a B cell survival 
factor,  to  its  receptors  on  B  cells  and  inhibits  B  cell  survival  and  differentiation  into  immunoglobulin-
producing plasma cells. Belimumab is authorised in the EU since July 2011 as an add-on therapy in adult 
patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of 
disease activity (e.g., positive anti-dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy. Benlysta has 
recently been indicated in combination with background immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment 
of adult patients with active lupus nephritis. 
Given the substantial disease burden, the nonspecific nature of the older therapeutics, their potential for 
poor tolerability and substantial toxicity as well as the paucity of medicinal products specifically targeting 
SLE, there exists a significant unmet need in terms of new therapeutic agents for SLE. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The key studies for assessment of safety and efficacy within the programme comprised: 
• 
Two  completed  52-week,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled,  Phase  III  studies: 
D3461C00004 or ‘Study 04’ (TULIP 2; total N randomised=365), and D3461C00005 or ‘Study 
05’ (TULIP 1; total N randomised=457) 
•  An  ongoing  3-year,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  long-term  extension  study  containing 
patients rolled over from studies 04 and 05 (D3461C00009 or ‘Study 09’) 
•  One completed 52-week Phase II study: CD-IA-MEDI-546-1013 or ‘Study 1013’ (MUSE; total N 
randomised=307) 
•  A completed 3-year, open-label extension study containing patients rolled over from study 1013 
(study CD-IA-MEDI-546-1145 or ‘Study 1145’) 
An anifrolumab dose of 300 mg Q4W was included in all key studies and is the only proposed dose.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The  efficacy  of  anifrolumab  has  been  evaluated  across  a  range  of  endpoints.  Primary  efficacy  was 
evaluated using composite endpoints designed to assess global disease activity; a systematic attempt to 
reduce use of oral corticosteroids was included in the protocols; the effect on disease flares was studied; 
and  scales  were  included  to  assess  effects  on  the  most  frequently  affected  individual  body  systems. 
Below are the most relevant results with regards to the favourable effects.  
BICLA  response  at  Week  52,  anifrolumab  300  mg  vs.  placebo  (primary  analysis  using  applicant’s 
composite estimand): 
•  47.8%  vs.  31.5%;  difference  16.3%  (95%  CI  6.3,  26.3);  p=0.0013  (primary  endpoint  in 
Study 04) 
•  47.1% vs. 30.2%; difference 17.0% (95% CI 7.2, 26.8) (secondary endpoint in Study 05) 
•  53.5% vs. 25.1%; difference 28.4% (95% CI 15.3, 41.5) (secondary endpoint in Study 1013) 
Maintained OCS tapering at Week 52, anifrolumab 300 mg vs. placebo: 
•  51.5%  vs.  30.2%;  difference  21.2%  (95%  CI  6.8,  35.7);  adjusted  p=0.014  (key  secondary 
endpoint in Study 04) 
•  49.7% vs. 33.1%; difference 16.6% (95% CI 3.4, 29.8) (key secondary endpoint in Study 05) 
•  56.4% vs. 27.3%; difference 29.1% (95% CI 12.0, 46.2) (secondary endpoint in Study 1013) 
CLASI response at Week 12, anifrolumab 300 mg vs placebo: 
•  49.0%  vs.  25.0%;  difference  24.0%  (95%  CI  4.3,  43.6);  adjusted  p=0.039  (key  secondary 
endpoint in Study 04) 
•  43.6% vs. 24.9%; difference 18.7% (95% CI 1.4, 36.0) (key secondary endpoint in Study 05) 
•  48.1% vs. 15.4%; difference 32.8% (95% CI 8.4, 57.1) (secondary endpoint in Study 1013) 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
For Study 05, it should be noted that as the study failed on the primary endpoint of SRI(4) response, p 
values for key secondary endpoints (BICLA response at Week 52, Maintained OCS tapering at Week 52, 
CLASI response at Week 12) cannot be formally interpreted due to the analysis hierarchy. 
Discordant numeric results between the Phase III studies are observed on several endpoints (notably 
SRI(4),  initially  envisaged  as  the  primary  endpoint  for  the  programme)  as  well  as  among  distinct 
subgroups; some of the inconsistencies are due to varying response rates on placebo. There are thus 
limitations in terms of the overall robustness of the observed results, but the limitations do not preclude 
overall consideration of a clinically relevant effect as discussed with the AHEG experts. 
SRI(4) response at Week 52, anifrolumab 300 mg vs. placebo 
•  55.5% vs. 37.3%; difference 18.2% (95% CI 8.1, 28.3); (secondary endpoint in Study 04) 
•  49.0% vs. 43.0%; difference 6.0% (95% CI -4.2, 16.2) (primary endpoint in Study 05; result 
presented according to Study 04 rules for restricted medications) 
•  62.8% vs. 38.8%; difference 24.0% (95% CI 10.9, 37.2) (secondary endpoint in Study 1013)

There are some uncertainties in respect of the magnitude of the ”true” treatment effect. According to 
additional sensitivity analyses conducted by the applicant, a large proportion of non-responders stemmed 
from intercurrent events, and in study 04, there was no difference in the proportion of true, clinical non-
responders between the groups. The impact of intercurrent events was notably large in study 04 where 
there was a large imbalance in study withdrawals between the arms. This is considered a weakness, as 
Study 04 was stronger in demonstrating benefit according to the original analysis. Nevertheless, despite 
the notable effect of intercurrent events on the point estimate of treatment effect and differences in the 
behaviour of the placebo groups, even a treatment difference that based on some scenarios which can 
be considered realistic is in the range of 10-11% (as opposed to 16-17% based on the applicant’s primary 
analyses) is considered clinically meaningful following recommendations from the AHEG. 
Regarding  secondary  endpoints only  results  on  OCS  tapering  and  flare  rate  (although  not  statistically 
robust) have been included in the Section 5.1 of the SmPC as they are reflecting important overarching 
treatment goals in SLE.  
Subgroup  analyses  demonstrated  some  heterogeneity  in  treatment  response.  Of  potential  clinical 
relevance,  a  larger  treatment  effect  was  observed  in  patients  with  high  disease  activity  based  on 
serological  markers.  In  Study  04,  the  difference  between  anifrolumab  300  mg  and  placebo  in  BICLA 
response at Week 52 was 9.2% (95% CI -7.5, 25.8) in patients with normal C3 and C4 and no anti-
dsDNA antibodies at baseline, compared with 21.3% (95% CI 8.8, 33.9) in patients with at least one of 
the following: low C3, low C4 or positive anti-dsDNA. In Study 05, the corresponding values were 7.9% 
(95% CI –7.2, 22.9) in patients with normal C3 and C4 levels and no anti-dsDNA antibodies at baseline, 
compared with 25.0% (95% CI 12.0, 37.9) in patients with at least one low/positive value. Considering 
those subgroup analyses and the modest effect size observed in the overall population, there may be 
clinically  relevant  heterogeneity  with  respect  to  treatment  response  in  biologically  and/or  clinically 
distinct subpopulations; one such example is the larger treatment effect observed in patients with high 
disease activity based on serological markers. While not considered restrictive from the perspective of 
the therapeutic indication, the applicant is recommended to continue, through additional analyses or new

studies, attempts to identify subpopulations that could be considered the best treatment candidates with 
anifrolumab. Moreover, as the most appropriate time frame for evaluating treatment responsiveness has 
not  yet  been  established,  the  applicant  is  recommended  to  investigate  criteria  that  could  be  used  in 
evaluating  whether  anifrolumab  treatment  should  be  continued  or  discontinued  and  considered 
successful or not successful in clinical practice. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Of the overall 1029 SLE subjects exposed to anifrolumab in the company development programme, at 
least 837 patients with SLE were exposed to IV anifrolumab, including 688 patients for ≥ 52 weeks with 
a total exposure to anifrolumab IV 150, 300, or 1000 mg in SLE patients (1888.2 PY). Of these, 459 
patients were exposed to the proposed dose of 300 mg for at least the 52 weeks. Some long-term safety 
data beyond the 52 weeks are available. Up to 19 March 2020, the total exposure to anifrolumab IV 150, 
300, or 1000 mg in SLE patients increased from 1888.2 PY to 2091.9 PY, including 548 patients exposed 
to anifrolumab for ≥ 104 weeks. 
Overall,  there  were  9  deaths  during  the  anifrolumab  clinical  studies  in  the  anifrolumab  development 
programme of which four occurred in the anifrolumab arm (3 pneumonia and one colitis/MAS) and 3 in 
the placebo arm (encephalitis, pulmonary hypertension, and MI). Four deaths occurred during treatment 
in the primary safety pool, one in the 1000 mg and 3 in the in the anifrolumab 300 mg treatment group 
(EAIR:  0.6/100  PY).  Two  2  additional deaths  occurred  in  study  09  from  02  August  2019  to  19  March 
2020, both in the anifrolumab 300 mg group. Deaths in anifrolumab groups are often associated with 
infections, mainly pneumonia. Hence, at the CHMP’s request, the Section 4.4 of the SmPC to specify that 
serious and sometimes fatal infections have occurred in patients receiving anifrolumab.  
The current safety data show an increased overall incidence of infections in SLE patients on anifrolumab 
treatment,  compared  to  patients  on  placebo  treatment,  also  in  the  long-term  data.  Especially,  an 
increased  number  of  herpes  zoster  infections  were  reported:  23  (6.4%)  compared  to  5  (1.4%)  the 
placebo arm. Most occurrences were cutaneous, mild or moderate in severity, not serious and did not 
lead to discontinuation. All responded to treatment and generally resolved without sequelae. Although 
no cases of active TB reported during any of the clinical studies, exposure-adjusted incidence of latent 
TB AEs reported during anifrolumab treatment showed an increasing trend with time, as measured by 
yearly  intervals.  Serious  infection  is  included  as  an  important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP  and  adequate 
post authorisation studies are planned to better assess this risk (see Section 2.6). 
In the primary safety pool, there were numerically more AEs categorised as hypersensitivity reactions in 
the  anifrolumab  300  mg  group  than  the  placebo  group:  12  patients  (3.3%)  and  3 patients  (0.8%), 
respectively.  Although  all  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity,  and  resolved  spontaneously  or  with 
symptomatic treatment, also one anaphylactic reaction was reported in the anifrolumab 150mg study 
group (in study 5). The incidence of hypersensitivity events in the supportive safety pool were similar to 
that observed in the primary safety pool. 
In  the  primary  safety  pool,  incidence  of  infusion-related  reactions  was  also  higher  in  patients  on 
anifrolumab 300 mg compared to those treated with placebo group (11.4% vs 7.4%, respectively), all 
being mild or moderate in intensity, with no serious reactions. Most reactions occurred in the first 24 
weeks of treatment. The most common symptoms of infusion-related reactions in the anifrolumab 300 
mg group were headache (45.6%), nausea (22.8%), vomiting (7.6%), and fatigue (5.1%). 
Adequate warning on hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions are included in the Section 4.4 of 
the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 192/198 
 
 
 
Malignancies  are  reported  with  a  higher  incidence in  patients  in  the  anifrolumab  300  mg  arm than  in 
placebo arm both in primary (1.4% vs 0.8%) and supportive safety pool (1.3% vs 0.6%). This higher 
rate could be expected in view of the mechanism of the action of the drug interfering with IFN tumour 
surveillance. The rate of malignancies seems to not increase over time in the long term (1.7% vs 1.1%). 
Since  careful  post-marketing  surveillance  is  of  importance,  malignancies  are  included  in  the  RMP  as 
important potential risk and a warning has been included in the 4.4 section of the SmPC. 
In the primary safety pool, the incidence of discontinuations in anifrolumab group due to AEs (DAE) was 
low, and similar across treatment groups: 17 (4.7%) and 18 (4.9%), in anifrolumab and placebo groups, 
respectively. The most commonly reported DAEs by SOC were in the Infections and infestations category: 
7  (1.9%)  vs.  3  (0.8%)  in  the  anifrolumab  and  placebo  groups,  respectively.  At  PT  level,  two 
discontinuations  were  ascribed  to  herpes  zoster  infections,  while  the  remaining  discontinuations  were 
single occurrences. The incidence of DAEs in the supportive safety pool was similar to that in the primary 
safety pool in the anifrolumab and placebo arms respectively. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Animal studies show no adverse effects of anifrolumab on indirect measures of fertility. However, the 
risk to reproduction cannot be excluded based on the available nonclinical data. Given that it is unlikely 
that  further  animal  studies  would  provide  clinically  meaningful  data  to  inform  about  the  risk  in  SLE 
patients, a revision of the SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC was requested by the CHMP to correctly 
describe the nonclinical reproductive toxicity data. Saphnelo is not recommended during pregnancy and 
in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using  contraception,  unless  the  possible  benefit  justifies  the 
potential risk.  
In the anifrolumab SLE clinical programme there were 31 patients with one or more pregnancy as of 01 
August  2019.  Four  spontaneous  abortions  were  reported  in  an  anifrolumab  group  and  0  in  a  placebo 
group.  The  evidence  to  suggest  causal  association  to  anifrolumab  treatment  for  the  four  cases  of 
spontaneous abortions is scarce. However, use in pregnancy is included as a missing information in the 
RMP and this issue will be further followed-up post approval in a dedicated study (see Section 2.6).  
The ADA results are compromised by unspecific binding to matrix proteins and potential aggregation of 
the ruthenylated reagent. Therefore, the observed numbers and proportion of subjects with treatment-
emergent ADA are unreliable. This is adequately reflected in the Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Patients  with  SLE  are  at  risk  of  infections  and  additional  risk  may  be  posed  by  the  use  of 
immunosuppressive agents and corticosteroids required to treat the disease. Therefore, these patients 
are potential candidates for vaccinations. No vaccine studies in anifrolumab-treated subjects have been 
previously performed. Thus, it is not known whether subjects receiving anifrolumab have the ability to 
mount  a  sufficient,  clinically  significant  positive  immune  response.  This  risk  is  adequately  reflected  in 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC. Effects on responses to inactivated vaccines is reflected as missing information 
in  the  RMP.  In  addition,  a  post  approval  safety  study  to  assess  the  antibody  response  to  vaccines  in 
individuals receiving anifrolumab is in place.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  efficacy  of  anifrolumab  has  been  evaluated  across  a  range  of  endpoints  within  the  clinical 
development programme. Primary efficacy was evaluated using composite endpoints designed to assess 
global disease activity; a systematic attempt to reduce use of oral corticosteroids was included in the 
protocols; the effect on disease flares was studied; and scales were included to assess effects on the 
most frequently affected individual body systems. The overall approach is in line with the CHMP Guideline 
on SLE (EMA/CHMP/51230/2013 corr). 
Compared to placebo, an increase in BICLA response rates with anifrolumab was seen in all three key 
studies. In addition, a higher proportion of patients were able to reduce their use of oral corticosteroids; 
and a skin response was detected with the CLASI score. Numerical trends favouring anifrolumab were 
seen on flare rates, but none of the differences were statistically significant. Whereas promising effects 
had been observed on the SRI(4) composite in the Phase II study 1013, Study 05 failed on SRI(4), its 
designated primary endpoint. Although Study 04 would have been positive on its original endpoint of 
SRI(4)  response,  that  endpoint  had  already  been  demoted  as  a  secondary  endpoint  outside  of  the 
confirmatory testing framework.  
Considering the uncertainties, the CHMP sought an expert consultation on this application. The experts 
agreed that Study 05 failed on its primary endpoint. In addition, changing the primary endpoint in Study 
04 after having seen the study results from Study 05 was considered suboptimal. However, the experts 
agreed  that  clinically  meaningful  effects  were  demonstrated  on  BICLA.  Some  important  secondary 
endpoints were considered clinically relevant and meaningful though not statistically robust: possibility 
of corticosteroid tapering, reduction of flares, patients reported outcomes (quality of life improvements). 
Considering  the  high  unmet  need  in  this  disease,  the  experts  agreed  that  the  effect  observed  with 
anifrolumab  translates  into  a  clinically  meaningful  effect  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe,  active, 
autoantibody-positive SLE. The CHMP followed the experts’ recommendations. 
Within treatment guidelines, corticosteroids, antimalarials and immunosuppressants have an established 
position in the treatment of SLE. However, they have a broad spectrum of effects and carry risks in terms 
of organ damage and poor tolerability. In principle, mAb-based therapies have the potential of reduced 
off-target  effects,  but  the  specific  pharmacological  profile  of  anifrolumab,  targeting  an  important 
component  of  the  immunological  system,  carries  a  risk  of  unfavourable  effects  directly  linked  to  its 
primary pharmacology. This is reflected in the safety profile, in which an increased risk of infections has 
been noted.  
Hypersensitivity and infusion-related events, common phenomena with protein-based therapies, have 
also been reported. The available clinical information on the use of anifrolumab during pregnancy will be 
followed-up  post  approval.  Otherwise,  anifrolumab  seems  to  be  well  tolerated,  with  relatively  similar 
number of AEs, SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs when compared to placebo. Adequate warnings 
are included in the SmPC and those risks will be followed-up in the post-authorisation setting (See RMP 
section 2.6). 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 196/198 
 
 
 
 
The long-term safety profile will be carefully monitored and adequate measures have been put in place 
(see RMP section 2.6). 
This was agreed by the AHEG as the experts agreed by consensus that the safety profile observed in the 
clinical trials was acceptable. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  challenges  related  to  the  disease  itself  as  well  as  the  available  efficacy  instruments  in  SLE  were 
acknowledged by the CHMP. Despite the recognised limitations of the results, taking into account overall 
the  results,  the  effect  and  the  high  unmet  medical  need  for  new  therapies  in  SLE  and  following 
recommendation  from  the  AHEG,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  totality  of  evidence  is  supportive  of  a 
beneficial  treatment  effect  of  anifrolumab.  The  effect  size  on  BICLA  response,  albeit  modest,  is 
considered clinically meaningful.  
The safety profile observed in the clinical trials was acceptable. An increased risk of infections has been 
observed in line with the mechanism of action. The long-term safety profile would need to be carefully 
monitored and adequate measures have been put in place (see RMP section 2.6). 
Based on the totality of evidence, the CHMP concluded that the benefit/risk balance of anifrolumab in 
the revised indication “add-on therapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe, active 
autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), despite standard therapy” is positive. The 
revised indication was accepted by the applicant. 
3.8.  Conclusion 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Saphnelo is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Saphnelo is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Saphnelo is indicated as an add-on therapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe, 
active autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), despite standard therapy.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal  product  subject  to  restricted  medical  prescription  (see  Annex  I:  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/4079/2022  
Page 197/198 
 
 
 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that anifrolumab is to be qualified 
as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised 
within the European Union.

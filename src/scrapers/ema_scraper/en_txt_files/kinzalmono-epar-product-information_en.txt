CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Hypertension
Treatment of essential hypertension in adults.


manifest atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or 
peripheral arterial disease) or
type 2 diabetes mellitus with documented target organ damage


4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Treatment of essential hypertension
The usually effective dose is 40 mg once daily. Some patients may already benefit at a daily dose of 
20 mg. In cases where the target blood pressure is not achieved, the dose of telmisartan can be 
increased to a maximum of 80 mg once daily. Alternatively, telmisartan may be used in combination 
with thiazide-type diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, which has been shown to have an additive 
blood pressure lowering effect with telmisartan. When considering raising the dose, it must be borne 
in mind that the maximum antihypertensive effect is generally attained four to eight weeks after the 
start of treatment (see section 5.1).
Cardiovascular prevention
The recommended dose is 80 mg once daily. It is not known whether doses lower than 80 mg of 
telmisartan are effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity.
When initiating telmisartan therapy for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity, close monitoring of 
blood pressure is recommended, and if appropriate adjustment of medications that lower blood 
pressure may be necessary.
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients.
Renal impairment
Limited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. A lower 
starting dose of 20 mg is recommended in these patients (see section 4.4). No posology adjustment is 
required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment
Kinzalmono is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment the posology should not exceed 40 mg once 
daily (see section 4.4).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Kinzalmono in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been 
established.
Currently available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology 
can be made.
Method of administration
Telmisartan tablets are for once-daily oral administration and should be taken with liquid with or 
without food.
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product.
Telmisartan should be kept in the sealed blister due to the hygroscopic property of the tablets. Tablets 
should be taken out of the blister shortly before administration (see section 6.6).

4.3 Contraindications




Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) 
Biliary obstructive disorders
Severe hepatic impairment
The concomitant use of Kinzalmono with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients 
with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5, and 5.1).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Pregnancy
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued 
angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should 
be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use 
in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should 
be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 
4.6).
Hepatic impairment
Kinzalmono is not to be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe 
hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile. These 
patients can be expected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan. Kinzalmono should be 
used only with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
Renovascular hypertension
There is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral 
renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal 
products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. 
Renal impairment and kidney transplantation
When Kinzalmono is used in patients with impaired renal function, periodic monitoring of potassium 
and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of 
Kinzalmono in patients with recent kidney transplantation. 
Intravascular hypovolaemia
Symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose of Kinzalmono, may occur in patients who 
are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea, or 
vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Kinzalmono. Volume 
and/or sodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Kinzalmono.
4
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)
There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or 
aliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including 
acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, 
angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).
If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist 
supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood 
pressure.
ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with 
diabetic nephropathy.
Other conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal 
disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system
such as telmisartan has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely 
acute renal failure (see section 4.8).
Primary aldosteronism
Patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products 
acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not 
recommended.
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
As with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral 
stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Diabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics 
In these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients 
an appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or 
antidiabetics may be required, when indicated.
Hyperkalaemia
The use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause 
hyperkalaemia.
In the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients, in patients concomitantly 
treated with other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels, and/or in patients with 
intercurrent events, hyperkalaemia may be fatal.
Before considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated.
The main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are:
-
-
Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years)
Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of 
medicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, 
potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal 
anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), 
heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim.
5
-
Intercurrent events, in particular dehydratation, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic 
acidosis, worsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious 
diseases), cellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extend trauma).
Close monitoring of serum potassium in at risk patients is recommended (see section 4.5).
Ethnic differences
As observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, telmisartan and the other angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in 
non-blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive 
population.
Other
As with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic 
cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.
Sorbitol
Kinzalmono 20 mg tablets
Kinzalmono 20 mg tablets contains 84.32 mg sorbitol in each tablet.
Kinzalmono 40 mg tablets
Kinzalmono 40 mg tablets contains 168.64 mg sorbitol in each tablet.
Kinzalmono 80 mg tablets
Kinzalmono 80 mg tablets contain 337.28 mg sorbitol in each tablet. Patients with hereditary fructose 
intolerance (HFI) should not take this medicinal product.
Sodium
Each tablet contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Digoxin
When telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma 
concentration (49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, 
and discontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the 
therapeutic range.
As with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, telmisartan may 
provoke hyperkalaemia (see section 4.4). The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with 
other medicinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia (salt substitutes containing potassium, 
potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, 
immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim).
The occurrence of hyperkalaemia depends on associated risk factors. The risk is increased in case of 
the above-mentioned treatment combinations. The risk is particularly high in combination with 
potassium sparing-diuretics, and when combined with salt substitutes containing potassium. A
combination with ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs, for example, presents a lesser risk provided that 
precautions for use are strictly followed.
6
Concomitant use not recommended.
Potassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. 
Potassium sparing diuretics e.g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium 
supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum 
potassium. If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia they should be used 
with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.
Lithium
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during 
concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with 
angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, 
careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. 
Concomitant use requiring caution.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products
NSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-
selective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
In some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with 
compromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents 
that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible 
acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, the combination should be administered 
with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration 
should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and 
periodically thereafter.
In one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in 
the AUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not 
known.
Diuretics (thiazide or loop diuretics)
Prior treatment with high dose diuretics such as furosemide (loop diuretic) and hydrochlorothiazide 
(thiazide diuretic) may result in volume depletion and in a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy 
with telmisartan.
To be taken into account with concomitant use.
Other antihypertensive agents
The blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan can be increased by concomitant use of other 
antihypertensive medicinal products.
Clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) 
through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is 
associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and 
decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting 
agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).
7
Based on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products 
may potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan: Baclofen, 
amifostine. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, 
narcotics or antidepressants.
Corticosteroïds (systemic route)
Reduction of the antihypertensive effect.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of 
pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during 
the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
There are no adequate data from the use of Kinzalmono in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors 
during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk 
cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued angiotensin II 
receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to 
alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. 
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped 
immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.
Exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known 
to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification 
retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3).
Should exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of 
pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.
Infants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for 
hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Breast-feeding
Because no information is available regarding the use of Kinzalmono during breast-feeding, 
Kinzalmono is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles 
during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.
Fertility
In preclinical studies, no effects of Kinzalmono on male and female fertility were observed.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
When driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or 
drowsiness may occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy such as Kinzalmono.

4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Serious adverse drug reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which may occur rarely 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), and acute renal failure.
The overall incidence of adverse reactions reported with telmisartan (was usually comparable to 
placebo (41.4 % vs 43.9 %) in controlled trials in patients treated for hypertension. The incidence of 
adverse reactions was not dose related and showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the 
patients. The safety profile of telmisartan in patients treated for the reduction of cardiovascular 
morbidity was consistent with that obtained in hypertensive patients.
The adverse reactions listed below have been accumulated from controlled clinical trials in patients 
treated for hypertension and from post-marketing reports. The listing also takes into account serious 
adverse reactions and adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported in three clinical long-term 
studies including 21642 patients treated with telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity 
for up to six years.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Sepsis
In the PRoFESS trial, an increased incidence of sepsis was observed with telmisartan compared with 
placebo. The event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known (see also 
section 5.1).
Hypotension
This adverse reaction was reported as common in patients with controlled blood pressure who were 
treated with telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity on top of standard care.
10
Hepatic function abnormal / liver disorder
Most cases of hepatic function abnormal / liver disorder from post-marketing experience occurred in 
Japanese patients. Japanese patients are more likely to experience these adverse reactions.
Interstitial lung disease
Cases of interstitial lung disease have been reported from post-marketing experience in temporal 
association with the intake of telmisartan. However, a causal relationship has not been established.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is limited information available with regard to overdose in humans.
Symptoms
The most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and tachycardia; 
bradycardia, dizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been reported.
Management
Telmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The patient should be closely monitored, and the 
treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion 
and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and / or gastric 
lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Serum electrolytes and 
creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a 
supine position, with salt and volume replacement given quickly.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II Antagonists, plain, ATC Code: C09CA07.
Mechanism of action
Telmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan 
displaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, 
which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial 
agonist activity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is 
long-lasting. Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less 
characterised AT receptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of 
their possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma 
aldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or 
block ion channels. Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the 
enzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin-
mediated adverse effects.
11
In human, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood 
pressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 
48 hours.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Treatment of essential hypertension
After the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within 
3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of 
treatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.
The antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours 
before the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by 
trough to peak ratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in 
placebo controlled clinical studies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to 
recovery of baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP). In this respect data concerning diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP) are inconsistent. 
In patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without 
affecting pulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its 
hypotensive activity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable 
to that of agents representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated 
in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and 
lisinopril).
Upon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment 
values over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension. 
The incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those 
given angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two 
antihypertensive treatments.
Cardiovascular prevention
ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint 
Trial) compared the effects of telmisartan, ramipril and the combination of telmisartan and ramipril 
on cardiovascular outcomes in 25620 patients aged 55 years or older with a history of coronary artery 
disease, stroke, TIA, peripheral arterial disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence 
of end-organ damage (e.g. retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, macro- or microalbuminuria), 
which is a population at risk for cardiovascular events.
Patients were randomized to one of the three following treatment groups: telmisartan 80 mg (n = 
8542), ramipril 10 mg (n = 8576), or the combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus ramipril 10 mg (n = 
8502), and followed for a mean observation time of 4.5 years.
Telmisartan showed a similar effect to ramipril in reducing the primary composite endpoint of 
cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for 
congestive heart failure. The incidence of the primary endpoint was similar in the telmisartan 
(16.7 %) and ramipril (16.5 %) groups. The hazard ratio for telmisartan vs. ramipril was 1.01 (97.5 % 
CI 0.93 - 1.10, p (non-inferiority) = 0.0019 at a margin of 1.13). The all-cause mortality rate was 
11.6 % and 11.8 % among telmisartan and ramipril treated patients, respectively.
Telmisartan was found to be similarly effective to ramipril in the pre-specified secondary endpoint of 
cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.99 (97.5 % CI 0.90 -
12
1.08), p (non-inferiority) = 0.0004], the primary endpoint in the reference study HOPE (The Heart 
Outcomes Prevention Evaluation Study), which had investigated the effect of ramipril vs. placebo. 
TRANSCEND randomized ACE-I intolerant patients with otherwise similar inclusion criteria as 
ONTARGET to telmisartan 80 mg (n=2954) or placebo (n=2972), both given on top of standard care. 
The mean duration of follow up was 4 years and 8 months. No statistically significant difference in 
the incidence of the primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial 
infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure) was found [15.7 % in the 
telmisartan and 17.0 % in the placebo groups with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95 % CI 0.81 - 1.05, p = 
0.22)]. There was evidence for a benefit of telmisartan compared to placebo in the pre-specified 
secondary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal 
stroke [0.87 (95 % CI 0.76 - 1.00, p = 0.048)]. There was no evidence for benefit on cardiovascular 
mortality (hazard ratio 1.03, 95 % CI 0.85 - 1.24).
Cough and angioedema were less frequently reported in patients treated with telmisartan than in 
patients treated with ramipril, whereas hypotension was more frequently reported with telmisartan. 
Combining telmisartan with ramipril did not add further benefit over ramipril or telmisartan alone. 
CV mortality and all cause mortality were numerically higher with the combination. In addition, there 
was a significantly higher incidence of hyperkalaemia, renal failure, hypotension and syncope in the 
combination arm. Therefore the use of a combination of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended 
in this population.
In the "Prevention Regimen For Effectively avoiding Second Strokes" (PRoFESS) trial in patients 50 
years and older, who recently experienced stroke, an increased incidence of sepsis was noted for 
telmisartan compared with placebo, 0.70 % vs. 0.49 % [RR 1.43 (95 % confidence interval 1.00 -
2.06)]; the incidence of fatal sepsis cases was increased for patients taking telmisartan (0.33 %) vs. 
patients taking placebo (0.16 %) [RR 2.07 (95 % confidence interval 1.14 - 3.76)]. The observed 
increased occurrence rate of sepsis associated with the use of telmisartan may be either a chance 
finding or related to a mechanism not currently known.
Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in 
combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs 
Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an 
angiotensin II receptor blocker.
ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. For more detailed 
information see above under the heading “Cardiovascular prevention”.
VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy.
These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes 
and mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as 
compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these 
results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.
ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in 
patients with diabetic nephropathy.
ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) 
was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor 
or an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney 
disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk 
of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the 
aliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest 
(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren 
group than in the placebo group.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Kinzalmono in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been 
established.
The blood pressure lowering effects of two doses of telmisartan were assessed in 76 hypertensive, 
largely overweight patients aged 6 to < 18 years (body weight ≥ 20 kg and ≤ 120 kg, mean 74.6 kg), 
after taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg (n = 29 treated) or 2 mg/kg (n = 31 treated) over a four-week 
treatment period. By inclusion the presence of secondary hypertension was not investigated. In some 
of the investigated patients the doses used were higher than those recommended in the treatment of 
hypertension in the adult population, reaching a daily dose comparable to160 mg, which was tested in 
adults. After adjustment for age group effects mean SBP changes from baseline (primary objective) 
were -14.5 (1.7) mm Hg in the telmisartan 2 mg/kg group, -9.7 (1.7) mm Hg in the telmisartan 
1 mg/kg group, and -6.0 (2.4) in the placebo group. The adjusted DBP changes from baseline 
were -8.4 (1.5) mm Hg, -4.5 (1.6) mm Hg and -3.5 (2.1) mm Hg respectively. The change was dose 
dependent. The safety data from this study in patients aged 6 to < 18 years appeared generally similar 
to that observed in adults. The safety of long term treatment of telmisartan in children and adolescents 
was not evaluated.
An increase in eosinophils reported in this patient population has not been recorded in adults. Its 
clinical significance and relevance is unknown.
These clinical data do not allow to make conclusions on the efficacy and safety of telmisartan in 
hypertensive paediatric population.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Absorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute 
bioavailability for telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately 
6 % (40 mg dose) to approximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma 
concentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food. 
Linearity/non-linearity
The small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy. There is 
no linear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent AUC increase 
disproportionately at doses above 40 mg.
Distribution
Telmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid 
glycoprotein. The mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l.
Biotransformation
Telmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No 
pharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate. 
14
Elimination
Telmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination 
half-life of >20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area 
under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no 
evidence of clinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma 
concentrations were higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy.
After oral (and intravenous) administration telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, 
mainly as unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma 
clearance (Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about 
1,500 ml/min).
Paediatric population
The pharmacokinetics of two doses of telmisartan were assessed as a secondary objective in 
hypertensive patients (n = 57) aged 6 to < 18 years after taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg over a 
four-week treatment period. Pharmacokinetic objectives included the determination of the steady-state 
of telmisartan in children and adolescents, and investigation of age-related differences. Although the 
study was too small for a meaningful assessment of the pharmacokinetics of children under 12 years 
of age, the results are generally consistent with the findings in adults and confirm the non-linearity of
telmisartan, particularly for Cmax.
Gender
Differences in plasma concentrations were observed, with Cmax and AUC being approximately 3- and 
2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males.
Elderly
The pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 
years.
Renal impairment
In patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations was 
observed. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal insufficiency 
undergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient patients and 
cannot be removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with renal 
impairment.
Hepatic impairment
Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute 
bioavailability up to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic 
impairment.
15
5.3
Preclinical safety data
In preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic 
range caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal 
haemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium 
in normotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal 
injury (erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-
mediated undesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting 
enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline 
supplementation.
In both species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal 
juxtaglomerular cells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting 
enzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical 
significance.
No clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an 
effect on the postnatal development of the offsprings such as lower body weight and delayed eye 
opening was observed.
There was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no 
evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Kinzalmono is and what it is used for
Kinzalmono belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin II receptor antagonists. 
Angiotensin II is a substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus 
increasing your blood pressure. Kinzalmono blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the blood 
vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered.
Kinzalmono is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. ‘Essential’ means 
that the high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition. 
High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead 
sometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually no symptoms 
of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure 
to verify if it is within the normal range.
Kinzalmono is also used to reduce cardiovascular events (i.e. heart attack or stroke) in adults who 
are at risk because they have a reduced or blocked blood supply to the heart or legs, or have had a 
stroke or have high risk diabetes. Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk for such events.
2. What you need to know before you take Kinzalmono
Do not take Kinzalmono

if you are allergic to telmisartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Kinzalmono in early 
pregnancy – see pregnancy section.)
if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with 
drainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren.



If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Kinzalmono.
35
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Kinzalmono if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of 
the following conditions or illnesses:








Kidney disease or kidney transplant.
Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys).
Liver disease.
Heart trouble.
Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various 
blood minerals).
Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body 
water) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy ('water tablets'), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, 
or vomiting.
Elevated potassium levels in your blood.
Diabetes.
Talk to your doctor before taking Kinzalmono:

if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:
- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems.
- aliskiren.
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes
(e.g. potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. See also information under the heading “Do 
not take Kinzalmono”.
if you are taking digoxin.

You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Kinzalmono is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).
In case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Kinzalmono.
Kinzalmono may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients.
Children and adolescents
The use of Kinzalmono in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended. 
Other medicines and Kinzalmono
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medications or take other 
precautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially 
to the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Kinzalmono:





Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression.
Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing 
potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics (certain 'water tablets'), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists, NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. aspirin or 
ibuprofen), heparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic 
trimethoprim. 
Diuretics ('water tablets'), especially if taken in high doses together with Kinzalmono, may lead 
to excessive loss of body water and low blood pressure (hypotension).
If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do 
not take Kinzalmono” and “Warnings and precautions”).
Digoxin.
36
The effect of Kinzalmono may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids.
Kinzalmono may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high 
blood pressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine). 
Furthermore, low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or 
antidepressants. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up. You should consult with your 
doctor if you need to adjust the dose of your other medicine while taking Kinzalmono.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Pregnancy
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally
advise you to stop taking Kinzalmono before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Kinzalmono. Kinzalmono is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may 
cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Kinzalmono is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for 
you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.
Driving and using machines
Some people feel dizzy or tired when taking Kinzalmono. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or 
operate machinery.
Kinzalmono contains sorbitol.
This medicine contains 84.32 mg sorbitol in each tablet.
Kinzalmono contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
3.
How to take Kinzalmono
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day.
You can take Kinzalmono with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or 
other non-alcoholic drink. It is important that you take Kinzalmono every day until your doctor tells 
you otherwise. If you have the impression that the effect of Kinzalmono is too strong or too weak, talk 
to your doctor or pharmacist. 
For treatment of high blood pressure, the usual dose of Kinzalmono for most patients is one 40 mg 
tablet once a day to control blood pressure over the 24-hour period. Your doctor has recommended a 
lower dose of one 20 mg tablet daily. Kinzalmono may also be used in combination with diuretics
('water tablets') such as hydrochlorothiazide which has been shown to have an additive blood pressure 
lowering effect with Kinzalmono.
For reduction of cardiovascular events, the usual dose of Kinzalmono is one 80 mg tablet once a day. 
At the beginning of the preventive therapy with Kinzalmono 80 mg, blood pressure should be 
frequently monitored. 
37
If your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg once daily.
If you take more Kinzalmono than you should
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital 
emergency department immediately.
If you forget to take Kinzalmono
If you forget to take a dose, do not worry. Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before. If 
you do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double 
dose to make up for forgotten individual doses.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.

Possible side effects
How to store Kinzalmono
Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Kinzalmono is and what it is used for
Kinzalmono belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin II receptor antagonists. 
Angiotensin II is a substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus 
increasing your blood pressure. Kinzalmono blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the blood 
vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered.
Kinzalmono is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. ‘Essential’ means 
that the high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition. 
High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead 
sometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually no symptoms 
of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure 
to verify if it is within the normal range.
Kinzalmono is also used to reduce cardiovascular events (i.e. heart attack or stroke) in adults who 
are at risk because they have a reduced or blocked blood supply to the heart or legs, or have had a 
stroke or have high risk diabetes. Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk for such events.
2. What you need to know before you take Kinzalmono
Do not take Kinzalmono

if you are allergic to telmisartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Kinzalmono in early 
pregnancy – see pregnancy section.)
if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with 
drainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren.



If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Kinzalmono.
42
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Kinzalmono if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of 
the following conditions or illnesses:








Kidney disease or kidney transplant.
Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys).
Liver disease. 
Heart trouble.
Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various 
blood minerals).
Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body 
water) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy ('water tablets'), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, 
or vomiting.
Elevated potassium levels in your blood.
Diabetes.
Talk to your doctor before taking Kinzalmono:

if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:
- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems.
- aliskiren.
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes
(e.g. potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. See also information under the heading “Do 
not take Kinzalmono”.
if you are taking digoxin.

You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Kinzalmono is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).
In case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Kinzalmono.
Kinzalmono may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients.
Children and adolescents
The use of Kinzalmono in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended. 
43
Other medicines and Kinzalmono
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medications or take other 
precautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially 
to the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Kinzalmono:





Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression.
Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing 
potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics (certain 'water tablets'), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists, NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. aspirin or 
ibuprofen), heparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic 
trimethoprim. 
Diuretics ('water tablets'), especially if taken in high doses together with Kinzalmono, may lead 
to excessive loss of body water and low blood pressure (hypotension).
If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do 
not take Kinzalmono” and “Warnings and precautions”).
Digoxin.
The effect of Kinzalmono may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids.
Kinzalmono may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high 
blood pressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine). 
Furthermore, low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or 
antidepressants. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up. You should consult with your 
doctor if you need to adjust the dose of your other medicine while taking Kinzalmono.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Pregnancy
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking Kinzalmono before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Kinzalmono. Kinzalmono is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may 
cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Kinzalmono is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for 
you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.
Driving and using machines
Some people feel dizzy or tired when taking Kinzalmono. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or 
operate machinery.
Kinzalmono contains sorbitol.
This medicine contains 168.64 mg sorbitol in each tablet.
Kinzalmono contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
44
3. 
How to take Kinzalmono
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day.
You can take Kinzalmono with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or 
other non-alcoholic drink. It is important that you take Kinzalmono every day until your doctor tells 
you otherwise. If you have the impression that the effect of Kinzalmono is too strong or too weak, talk 
to your doctor or pharmacist. 
For treatment of high blood pressure, the usual dose of Kinzalmono for most patients is one 40 mg 
tablet once a day to control blood pressure over the 24 hour period. However, sometimes your doctor 
may recommend a lower dose of 20 mg or a higher dose of 80 mg. Alternatively, Kinzalmono may be 
used in combination with diuretics ('water tablets') such as hydrochlorothiazide which has been shown 
to have an additive blood pressure lowering effect with Kinzalmono.
For reduction of cardiovascular events, the usual dose of Kinzalmono is one 80 mg tablet once a day. 
At the beginning of the preventive therapy with Kinzalmono 80 mg, blood pressure should be 
frequently monitored. 
If your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg once daily.
If you take more Kinzalmono than you should
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital 
emergency department immediately.
If you forget to take Kinzalmono
If you forget to take a dose, do not worry. Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before. If 
you do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double 
dose to make up for forgotten individual doses.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may 
cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Kinzalmono is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for 
you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.

How to take Kinzalmono
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day.
You can take Kinzalmono with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or 
other non-alcoholic drink. It is important that you take Kinzalmono every day until your doctor tells 
you otherwise. If you have the impression that the effect of Kinzalmono is too strong or too weak, talk 
to your doctor or pharmacist. 
For treatment of high blood pressure, the usual dose of Kinzalmono for most patients is one 40 mg 
tablet once a day to control blood pressure over the 24 hour period. However, sometimes your doctor 
may recommend a lower dose of 20 mg or a higher dose of 80 mg. Alternatively, Kinzalmono may be 
used in combination with diuretics ('water tablets') such as hydrochlorothiazide which has been shown 
to have an additive blood pressure lowering effect with Kinzalmono.
For reduction of cardiovascular events, the usual dose of Kinzalmono is one 80 mg tablet once a day. 
At the beginning of the preventive therapy with Kinzalmono 80 mg, blood pressure should be 
frequently monitored.
If your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg once daily.
If you take more Kinzalmono than you should
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital 
emergency department immediately.
If you forget to take Kinzalmono
If you forget to take a dose, do not worry. Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before. If 
you do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double 
dose to make up for forgotten individual doses.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

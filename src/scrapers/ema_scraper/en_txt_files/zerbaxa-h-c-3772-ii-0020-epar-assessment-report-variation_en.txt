2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application summarises the results from three Phase 1 studies (PN018, PN028, PN007) and one 
pivotal Phase 3 study (PN008) supporting the use of ceftolozane/tazobactam (i.e. TOL/TAZ; also known 
as ZERBAXATM, MK-7625A, CXA-201) for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia (NP), including both 
Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP, also known as HAP) and Ventilator-associated bacterial 
pneumonia (VABP, also known as VAP), in patients 18 years or older. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Introduction 
ZERBAXA is a fixed dose combination product of ceftolozane (a cephalosporin antibiotic) and tazobactam 
(a well-established β-lactamase inhibitor); ZERBAXA is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of 
complicated genitourinary tract infections (cUTI) and intra-abdominal infections (cIAI). This application 
concerns  an  extension  of  indication  to  include  treatment  of  nosocomial  pneumonia  (NP)  infections  in 
adults. 
The  currently  marketed  formulation  of  ZERBAXA  will  be  used,  which  contains  a  dose  of  1.5  g  (1  g 
ceftolozane/0.5 g tazobactam). The proposed 3 g dose (2 g TOL/1 g TAZ) to be used for the NP indication 
will be produced by using two vials. This injection will be required three times per day for a total daily dose 
of 6 g ceftolozane and 3 g tazobactam for a maximum duration of treatment of 14 days. 
Phase I analysis 
The log of the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log Dow) of ceftolozane was determined to be -0.21 
at pH 7.4, and for tazobactam -0.63 at pH 7.4.  As these values are well below 4.5, an evaluation for 
persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity was not conducted. 
PEC calculations  
For the calculation of the PECsw values, the default Fpen was used to account for all indications. The 
DOSEai (maximum daily dose of active substance consumed) is 6000 mg/day for ceftolozane and 3000 
mg/day for tazobactam. 
- 
- 
The PECsw for ceftolozane was calculated to be 30.0 µg/L, which is above the threshold of 0.01 
µg/L and therefore a phase II risk assessment is provided.  
The PECsw for tazobactam was calculated to be 15.0 µg/L, which is above the threshold of 0.01 
µg/L and therefore a phase II risk assessment is provided. 
Phase II 
Phase II studies were conducted and assessed in the previous application in 2014. 
PEC and RQ values have now been updated for surface water, groundwater and wastewater treatment 
facilities, based on a maximum daily dose of 6 g ceftolozane and 3 g tazobactam (see table). All RQs for 
Tazobactam are under the threshold of 1, indicating no risk to the environment. For Ceftolozane a risk for 
surface water is indicated, which is investigated further in Tier B.

Both  ceftolozane  and  tazobactam  are  not  readily  biodegradable,  however,  tazobactam  did  not 
significantly shift to the sediment, and a Tier B assessment was not necessary. For ceftolozane a Tier B for 
sediment was conducted, by means of an OECD 218 study (sediment-water chrironomid toxicity using 
spiked  sediment)  which  did  not  indicate  a  risk  when  the  updated  PEC  values  were  used  in  the  risk 
calculation.

indication and higher maximum dose:  
Extrapolated DDD (old indication) 3* 1 g/day = 7,077,012 g 
Extrapolated DDD (new indication) 3* 2 g/day = 14,154,024 g 
Projected consumption: 21,231,036 g/yr = 21,231,036,000 mg/yr

indicates a potential risk to the environment. 
Based on the currently available information, the SmPC for ZERBAXA includes the following statement: 
One  of  the  active  ingredients,  ceftolozane,  may  have  harmful  effects  if  it  reaches  the  aquatic 
environment. Do not throw away any unused medicinal product or waste material via wastewater. Any 
unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed in accordance with local requirements. 
These measures will help protect the environment. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure 
further to the use of ceftolozane and tazobactam. 
Considering the above data, ceftolozane and tazobactam should be used according to the precautions 
stated in the SmPC in order to minimize any potential risks to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A  comprehensive  clinical  pharmacology  program  was  conducted  to  support  the  original  application  of 
TOL/TAZ for cUTI and cIAI indications at the TOL/TAZ 1.5 g q8h dose. Nine phase 1 studies evaluated the 
safety, PK, effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, tissue distribution (ELF PK), and effect on QTc interval 
of TOL/TAZ. The studies cover a dose range that included the proposed 3 g dose for the NP indication. 
Additional  studies  (PN018,  PN007,  PN008)  have  been  completed  since  the  original  cIAI/cUTI 
application to provide data to support the new adult NP indication and dose regimen (3g q8h). Also, four 
popPK modelling and ER analysis reports have been submitted in the current application:

reconstituted into clear solution and infused intravenously, similar in vivo performance was anticipated 
for each component regardless of formulation. This  enabled pooling of PK data across studies to fully 
characterise the PK profile and assess factors affecting TOL and TAZ PK using a population PK (popPK) 
modeling approach. 
CHMP’s comment 
A  paediatric  indication  for  Zerbaxa  is  not  pursued  at  this  stage.  Hence,  the  popPK  model  report 
concerning selection of paediatric dose in cUTI and cIAI has not been assessed.  
Methods 
Analytical methods 
Validated analytical methods 
LC-MS/MS  methods  validated  in  accordance  with  applicable  regulatory  guidance  were  used  for  the 
determination of TOL, TAZ, and TAZ  M1 metabolite in biological matrices. Colorimetric methods were 
used to determine urea in plasma and ELF. Methods are listed in Table 1. The methods MN10131 (TOL) 
and MN14014 (TOL+TAZ, TAZM1) were developed and validated to support the studies in the original 
submission. New analytical LC methods were developed and validated for the determination of:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
TOL (MN09055) and TAZ/ TAZ M1 metabolite (MN08036) in urine (study PN018), 
TOL (MN10120) and TAZ (MN14114) in epithelial lining fluid, ELF (study PN007), 
urea (MN14016) in plasma (study PN007), and 
urea (MN14017) in ELF (study PN007). 
Primarily,  isotopically  labelled  internal  standards  (TOL,  TAZ  M1)  were  used.  Sulbactam  was  internal 
standard for TAZ in ELF and plasma. Satisfactory between- and within-run accuracy and precision were 
shown for LLOQ, low, medium and high QC sample concentrations. Dilution integrity was demonstrated. 
Stability in matrixes at room temperature, -20°C and -70°C, and over a number of freeze-thaw cycles 
have been determined.

Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
In general, the PK data analyses were performed using non-compartmental analysis (Phoenix WinNonlin 
software  version  6.3  or  later).  Standard  statistical  methods  were  used,  including  ANOVA  analysis  for 
comparisons to assess potential ethnicity differences in PK in study 018. 
050ZC7: All exploratory data analyses and presentations of data were performed using SAS Version 9.4 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC), KIWI Version 2 (Cognigen Corporation, Buffalo, NY), and PsN Version 4.4.0 
(Uppsala  University,  Uppsala,  Sweden).  PopPK  modeling  was  performed  using  the  computer  program 
NONMEM, Version 7, Level 3.0 (ICON Development Solutions, Hanover, MD). NONMEM analyses were 
performed  on  an  Intel  cluster  with  the  Linux  operating  system.  The  first-order  conditional  estimation 
method with interaction (FOCE-I) was used for the model development. 
Evaluation and qualification of models 
popPK model 050zc7 
Methodology 
To evaluate the PK of TOL and TAZ in NP patients, the previously developed popPK models were refined 
by including PK data from studies PN008 (ventilated NP patients), PN013 (MK-7625A-013, Japanese 
cIAI patients) and PN014 (MK-7625A-014, Japanese cUTI patients), whereas PK data from the paediatric 
study CXA-PEDS-13-08 were excluded.

Objectives (050zc7) 
-  Refine the popPK models for TOL and TAZ using data from PN008, PN013 and PN014, 
- 
evaluate the effect of pneumonia/other infections on the plasma PK parameters of TOL&TAZ, 
-  perform stochastic simulations to estimate individual plasma and ELF exposures and calculate the 
probability of target attainment (PTA) for TOL&TAZ in patients with NP, and 
- 
support TOL/TAZ dose regimen justification in adult patients with NP. 
Model development process 
2-compartment model with zero-order input and first-order elimination was selected as a starting point 
for  the  base  model  development.  Forward  selection,  backward  elimination  was  used  in  the  covariate 
analysis. An exponential variance model was used for IIV and a proportional variance model was used for 
RV. The IIV error model was further refined by estimating an additive plus constant coefficient of variation 
form. During model refinement, the TOL and TAZ models were evaluated for the effect of ESRD on CL and 
Vc, model sensitivity to identified outliers, and the effect of sparse data on the estimation of IIV in Vp (for 
TOL only).

Dataset 
Two single agent (TOL) phase 1 studies (CXA-101-01, -101-02), nine Phase 1 trials (CXA-201-01, 
-201-  02,  -MD-1107,  -QT-10-02,  -ELF-10-03,  -REN-11-01  (incl.  six  patients  receiving  HD), 
-DDI-12- 10, -EB-13-05, and PN007), two Phase 2 studies (CXA-IAI-10-01, -101-03, the latter TOL 
single agent), and three Phase 3 trials (PN013, PN014 and PN008). 
TOL: Presumably a total of 8680 plasma concentrations from 987 subjects. Following data cleaning, 8330 
(96%) observations from 968 (98%) subjects remained, including 1481 sparse observations from 305 NP 
patients (PN008). The final dataset also consisted of 47 ELF concentrations from 47 subjects. 
TAZ: Presumably a total of 6144 plasma concentrations from 854 subjects. Following data cleaning 5679 
(92.4%) observations and 835 (97.8%) subjects remained, including 1455 sparse PK samples from 305 
NP patients (PN008). The final dataset also consisted of 42 ELF concentrations from 42 subjects. 
In the overall pooled final dataset for TOL, median (range) for age, weight, and baseline CrCL was 56 
years (18-98), 73.35 kg (33.5-173) and 102.9 mL/min (6.30 to 531.3). In study PN008, the median 
(range) for age, weight, and baseline CrCL was 62.0 years (18 to 98), 80 kg (42 to 150.1), and 110.4 
mL/min (14.9 to 531.3), respectively, and the majority (84.6%) were whites. Demographics for the TAZ 
population were similar. 
TOL/TAZ was administered as a 60 minute infusion in all studies. TOL (0.25-3 g) and TAZ (0.25-1.5g) 
were given either alone or as a TOL/TAZ combination. Single or combined agents were given as a single 
dose or as multiple doses (q6h, q8h, q12h, or QD). In PN008 TOL/TAZ was administered according to 
renal function (≥30 mL/min) using the dose regimen proposed in the SmPC. A combination of rich (eleven 
phase 1 studies) and sparse (all phase 2 and 3 studies) PK sampling were performed. In study PN008 
sampling was performed at four time points on Day 4: end of infusion, 0.5-1.5, 2.5-3.5 and 5.0-6.0 hours 
post infusion. 
Data  missingness:  BLQ  data  were  excluded:  5.21%  and  23.25%  of  TOL  and  TAZ  observations, 
respectively, were BLQ. The majority of BLQs were 15 hours (5.09%, TOL) or 5 hours (22.93%, TAZ) 
post-dose. 
Outliers: Outliers were defined as [TOL] plasma > 450 µg/mL, [TAZ]plasma >130 µg/mL, |CWRESI|≥6 for 
both TOL and TAZ, and were retained in the datasets but excluded during the model development process 
in the NONMEM control streams  (i.e. N=23, N=23, N=33, N=12 observations excluded, respectively). 
Outliers were considered included in the final model dataset. 
Assumptions 
Baseline covariates were assumed to be constant. Other assumptions were not explicitly stated. 
Co-variate considerations 
Covariates evaluated were body weight (BW, kg), race (white, Japanese, and other), infection type (cIAI, 
cUTI, pneumonia, other infection and healthy), CrCL (Cockcroft and Gault formula, mL/min). Critically ill 
adult patients in Group 2 from study PN007 were included in the other infection category. Covariate 
correlation (|r|>0.6) was examined prior to covariate analysis. 
Diagnostics/GoF evaluation 
Objective function value (forward inclusion ΔOFV ≥ 6.64 [α=0.01, df1], backward elimination ΔOFV ≥ 
10.83 [α=0.01, df1]), convergence, adequate precision (%RSE), DV vs. PRED/IPRED, CWRES vs. PRED,

Simulations to support dose recommendations in special populations and for PTA analysis 
Individual model-based empiric Bayesian parameter estimates (EBE) were used to simulate individual PK 
profiles  for  subjects  included  in  the  analysis  datasets  (PN008).  The  relevant  parameters  from  the 
previously  developed  PK  models  for  lung  penetration  of  TOL/TAZ  (050w2j)  were  combined  with  the 
simulated  plasma  concentrations 
(using  model  050cz7) 
to  stochastically  simulate  ELF 
concentration-time  profiles  in  patients  with  NP.  Lung  penetration  of  TOL/TAZ  was  described  using  a 
hypothetical  linked  compartment  model,  where  drug  disposition  between  the  central  and  ELF 
compartments was described using K1E and KE0 (Figure 1). The linked model assumes that the amount of 
drug transferred to the ELF compartment is negligible and does not affect plasma disposition. 
Using  a  virtual  demographic  dataset,  stochastic  simulations  of  plasma  and  ELF  concentrations  were 
performed to support dose justification for patients with NP and varying degrees of renal function, based 
on CrCL (N=1000 for each subgroup): accelerated renal clearance (ARC) (≥ 210 mL/min, 180 mL/min to 
< 210 mL/min and 150 mL/min to < 180 mL/min), normal renal function (80 mL/min to <150 mL/min), 
mild, moderate and severe renal impairment (50 mL/min to < 80 mL/min, 30 mL/min to ≤ 50 mL/min and 
15 mL/min to ≤ 29 mL/min, respectively), and ESRD (<15 mL/min or on HD). Correlation between CrCL 
and body weight in the pooled demographic dataset was graphically compared with that in study PN008, 
and was found generally comparable. Unexplained IIV and residual error components of the final model 
were retained in the simulations performed. 
A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of varying magnitudes of IIV in K1E on ELF PTA 
by: 1) assuming the estimated value, 2) restricting the distribution of eta in K1E to the estimated range 
and 3) fixing IIV in K1E to zero. 
The effect of haemodialysis (HD) on CL, Vc, IIV in CL, and IIV in Vc, determined in a separate analysis 
(CXA-POPPK-002, 04DDG4) was included in the current simulations by applying these effects during a 
4-hour HD treatment (performed on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12). Three 14 days dosing schedules were 
investigated in ESRD (dose given immediately after HD): 
-  Scenario 1. single loading dose of 1.0/0.5 g, maintenance dose of 0.2/0.1 g q8h, 
-  Scenario 2. single loading dose of 1.5/0.75 g, maintenance dose of 0.3/0.15 g q8h, and 
-  Scenario 3. single loading dose of 2.0/1.0 g, maintenance dose of 0.4/0.2 g.  
Results 
Final model 
A 2-compartment model with first-order elimination best described the plasma concentration time profile 
of TOL. The plasma PPK model was parameterised in terms of Vc, Vp, CL, and Q. The significant covariates 
relevant to the NP population included: body weight on Vc, and Vp; CrCL on CL; and pneumonia on Vc. 
The  popPK  model of  TAZ  had  the  same  structure  and  parameterisation  as  that  for  TOL,  but  with one 
additional covariate i.e. pneumonia on Vp.  PK parameter estimates are given in Table 3 and Table 4. 
Considering  the  substantial  effect  of  outliers on  many  of  the  final  fixed  and  random  effect  parameter 
estimates, outliers were not included in the final TOL and TAZ models.

Simulations 
Simulation results are described in sections 5.3.2 (Target population and Special populations) and 5.3.3 
(Pharmacodynamics). 
In the sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of the magnitude of IIV in K1E on TOL and TAZ PTA 
(ELF model), TAZ PTA in ELF decreased when the magnitude of IIV in K1E increased. Ceftolozane PTA in 
ELF at an MIC = 4 μg/mL was > 90% for all K1E scenarios. 
Distribution 
Lung penetration - study PN007 
Intrapulmonary penetration of TOL/TAZ was assessed in a phase 1, prospective, multi-centre, open-label 
lung penetration PK and safety trial of TOL/TAZ in two groups of patients: (1) mechanically ventilated 
patients with proven or suspected pneumonia and (2) critically ill patients with CrCL ≥180 mL/min (ARC). 
Twenty-six  (26)  mechanically  ventilated  (≥24  hours  prior  to  enrolment)  patients  with  proven  or 
suspected pneumonia receiving concurrent standard antibiotic therapy, of whom eight patients had CrCL 
≥150  mL/min  (Cockcroft-Gault  equation),  were  included  in  group  1.  At  least  one  clinical  symptom 
(documented  fever,  hypothermia,  elevated  WBC  count,  radiological  finding  suggestive  of  bacterial 
pneumonia) were required. 
Patients received 4-6 IV doses of TOL/TAZ q8h according to renal function using the proposed posology. 
Plasma PK sampling occurred at pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the start of the first and last 
infusions. A BAL procedure was performed at either 1, 2, 4, 6 or 8 hours post-dose, with only one BAL 
sampling per patient. 
The composite ELF profile showed delayed TOL and TAZ Tmax, at 6 and 2 h, respectively, compared to 
1 hour in plasma (Table 5). TOL ELF concentration was >8 μg/mL and TAZ ELF concentration was >1 
μg/mL 100% of the dosing interval. The ELF penetration ratios (ELF AUC / unbound plasma AUC) were 
~50% and 62% for TOL and TAZ, respectively. The  tmax and elimination were slower in  ELF than in 
plasma for both TOL and TAZ whereas the PK profiles for ELF and plasma were parallel in healthy subjects 
(not shown). The exposure profiles of TOL/TAZ in plasma and ELF from patients appear to be similar to 
those in healthy subjects (study CXA-ELF-10-03, Table 6).

Dose proportionality 
The dose proportionality of TOL/TAZ for single doses up to 4.5 g and multiple doses up to 3 g daily was 
assessed in the original application (studies CXA-101-01, CXA-QT-10-02). Exposures (Cmax and AUC) 
were found to be approximately dose proportional. 
• 
Time dependency 
Following  multiple-dose  administration  in  mechanically  ventilated  patients  with  proven  or  suspected 
pneumonia (PN007), plasma accumulation of ~1.6- and 1.2-fold was observed in AUC0-8h for TOL and

subjects  submitted  in  the  original  application  (CXA-101-01,  CXA-201-01,  CXA-MD-11-02),  with 
dosing up to 4 g q8h for 10 days.

Augmented renal clearance (ARC) 
PK parameters after a single IV dose of 3 g TOL/TAZ were assessed in plasma in ten critically ill patients 
with ARC (CrCL ≥ 180 mL/min; study PN007). Compared with patients without ARC, these patients had 
reduced exposures (AUC 223/34 vs. 394/61 h*µg/min) and shorter plasma half-lives (4.86/2.33 hours 
vs. 2.59/1.47 hours) of ceftolozane and tazobactam (Table 10). Free TOL plasma concentration was over 
the PK/PD target of 8 µg for approximately 70% of the dosing interval, and above the threshold of 1 µg/ml 
for approximately 60% of the dosing interval (not shown). 
Model-based exposures in patients with different renal function, including ARC, from PN008 are shown in 
Table 9 above.

Race 
A single-dose, open-label, parallel-group study was conducted to evaluate the effects of ethnicity on the 
PK of TOL/TAZ administered in Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian healthy subjects (study PN018). Ten 
Japanese, nine Chinese and ten Caucasian healthy subjects were administered IV single doses of 1.5 g 
and 3 g TOL/TAZ as 60 minute infusions. Blood and urine were sampled at predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 
and 36 hours postdose (i.e. start of infusion) and at 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24 and 24-36 hours postdose, 
respectively. The mean values for most of the PK parameters are similar across ethnic groups for all the 
analytes (Table 11). Dose normalisation resulted in comparable PK parameters between doses for each 
ethnic  group,  suggesting  dose  proportional  PK.  Weight  normalisation  yielded  comparable  parameters 
between groups at both doses. A trend towards higher exposure (Cmax and AUC) levels for TAZ M1 in 
Caucasians compared to Japanese and Chinese subjects.

Weight 
In  the  NP  popPK  analyses  (050zc7),  body  weight  was  a  statistically  significant  covariate  on  volume 
parameters for both TOL and TAZ. TOL and TAZ AUC in NP subjects in the lowest weight tertiles (43 to 
<75 kg) with normal renal function (CrCL ≥80 mL/min) receiving the same 3-g TOL/TAZ dose throughout 
the treatment duration was estimated to be ~ 20% higher than those in the middle body weight tertile (75 
to <88 kg). There was no significant difference in TOL and TAZ PK in the highest body weight tertile (88 
to ~ 150 kg) compared to those in the middle body weight tertile. The small increases in the lowest body 
weight tertile were not considered clinically meaningful, and no dose adjustment based on body weight is 
recommended.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based on the predominant renal elimination as unchanged parent drug and minimal CYP450 mediated 
metabolism of TOL and TAZ, plasma levels are not expected to be altered in a clinically relevant manner 
by other CYP450 inhibitors or inducers. Co-administration of TOL/TAZ with drugs that inhibit OAT1 and/or 
OAT3 may increase TAZ plasma concentrations. 
Co-administration of TAZ with probenecid has been shown to prolong the TAZ t1/2 by 71% (prescribing 
information for the FDA approved Zosyn [piperacillin/tazobactam]). In a clinical study (CXA-DDI-12-10) 
evaluating  the  potential  of  TOL/TAZ  1.5-g  dose  to  alter  the  PK  of  substrates of  CYP1A2,  CYP3A4  and 
OAT1/3,  the  results  showed  minimal  potential  for  a  clinically  relevant  inhibition  of  CYP3A4,  CYP1A2 
enzymes  or  OAT1/OAT3  transporters  by  TOL/TAZ,  as  evidenced  by  no  increase  in  exposure  of  the 
respective  probe  substrates.  Similar  results  are  expected  after  the  3  g  TOL/TAZ  dose  given  that  the 
exposures observed are well below concentrations tested in vitro, which did not show any potential to 
alter activity of any major enzyme or transporter to a clinically meaningful extent.

Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Findings  from  in  vitro  metabolism  and  transporter  studies  conducted  in  support  of  the  original  1.5-g 
TOL/TAZ dose regimen can be extended to the 3-g TOL/TAZ dose regimen proposed in this application, 
based on the concentrations tested. Therefore, no new in vitro human biomaterial studies were conducted 
specifically to support the NP indication. Key in vitro data for TOL/TAZ from the original submission are 
summarised below; and the applicability of the data to the 3-g dose for NP is indicated where relevant. 
Metabolism 
TOL undergoes minimal metabolism and is not a substrate for hepatic CYP450 enzymes. TAZ, like TOL, 
appears not to be a substrate for hepatic CYP450 enzymes. The M1 metabolite of TAZ is formed by the 
hydrolysis of the tazobactam β-lactam ring and lacks pharmacological activity. 
Transporters 
TOL is not a substrate for the P-gp or BCRP human transporters at concentrations up to 1000 μg/mL. TOL 
produced no clinically relevant inhibition of any transporter at concentrations up to 1000 μg/mL (MRP2) 
to 2500 μg/mL (OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MATE1, MATE2). 
The highest concentrations tested, 1000 and 2500 μg/mL, are approximately 10- and 26-fold greater, 
respectively, than the geom. mean Cmax,ss after 3 g TOL/TAZ dosing (96.1 μg/mL, PN008). 
TAZ is not a substrate for the P-gp, BCRP, or OCT2 human transporters at 5-500 µg/mL, but is a substrate 
for  the  human  OAT1  and  OAT3  transporters.  TAZ  produced  no  clinically  relevant  inhibition  of  human 
OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, Pgp, BCRP, and BSEP transporters at concentrations ≤900 µg/mL, i.e. 
37-fold greater than geom. mean Cmax,ss after 3 g TOL/TAZ dosing (24.2 μg/mL, PN008). TAZ inhibited 
the human OAT1 and OAT3 transporters (IC50 ~118 and 147 μg/mL, respectively). These concentrations 
are ~ 5- to 6-fold greater than the geom. mean Cmax,ss after 3 g TOL/TAZ dosing (24.2 μg/mL, PN008). 
TAZ  M1  metabolite  did  not  produce  clinically  relevant  inhibition  at  concentrations  ≤  75  μg/mL,  i.e. 
~26-fold greater than the geom. mean TAZ M1 Cmax at a 3-g dose (2.84 μg/mL, PN007). 
Induction/inhibition potential: 
TOL showed no clinically relevant reversible or time-dependent inhibition of any major CYP450 isoform 
(1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A) at concentrations up to 6000 μg/mL or induction of isoforms 
(1A2, 3A4, and 2B6) up to 1000 μg/mL, i.e. 62- and 10-fold, respectively, greater than the geom.mean 
Cmax,ss at the 3 g TOL/TAZ dose (96.1 μg/mL, PN008). 
TAZ did not produce clinically relevant inhibition of any major CYP450 enzymes (1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 
2C19, and 2D6) at concentrations up to 2000 μg/mL or induction of enzymes (1A2, 2B6 and 3A4) up to 
1250 μg/mL, i.e. 83- and 52-fold, respectively, greater than the geom.mean Cmax,ss at the 3 g TOL/TAZ 
dose (24.2 μg/mL, PN008). TAZ inhibited CYP3A4 with an estimated IC50 >500 µg/mL (estimated Ki 
> 250 µg/mL). 
TAZ M1 metabolite did not produce clinically relevant inhibition of any major CYP450 enzyme (1A2, 2B6, 
2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4) at concentrations up to 150 μg/mL or induction of enzymes (1A2, 2B6 and 
3A4)  up  to  75  μg/mL  (53-  and  26-fold,  respectively,  greater  than  the  geom.  mean  Cmax  at  the  3  g 
TOL/TAZ dose (2.84 μg/mL, PN007).

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology 
Susceptibility (In vitro spectrum activity) - Methodology 
TOL/TAZ is a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination with activity against P. aeruginosa, including 
drug-resistant strains, and other common gram-negative pathogens. TOL belongs to the cephalosporin 
class  of  antibacterial  drugs,  but  is  less  susceptible  to  hydrolysis  by  AmpC  β-lactamases  than  other 
antibiotics in this class. The combination of TOL with β-lactamase inhibitor TAZ, which is a potent inhibitor 
of most class A and some class C β-lactamases, improves the coverage of TOL to include ESBL-producing 
Enterobacteriaceae.  
The  spectrum  of  activity  for  ceftolozane  includes  many  clinically  relevant  gram-negative  respiratory 
pathogens, including Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae as well as 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae.  
Surveillance studies 
In vitro activity of TOL/TAZ has been tested against respiratory tract isolates from hospitalized patients in 
a combined surveillance study for the US and Europe during 2015-2017. Results for the European isolates 
are summarised below. 
TOL/TAZ (MIC50, 0.25 mg/L and MIC90, 2 mg/L) inhibited 88.6% of 11,390 European Enterobacteriaceae 
from all infection types at the EUCAST susceptible breakpoint of ≤1 mg/L. Of the 2,456 isolates with an 
ESBL-phenotype,  TOL/TAZ  inhibited  64.0%  (MIC50/90  0.5/>32  mg/L).  When  excluding  CRE,  2,080 
Enterobacteriaceae  isolates  were  ESBL,  non-CRE;  75.3%  were  inhibited  by  TOL/TAZ  (MIC50/90  0.5/8 
mg/L); and 99.9% of non-ESBL isolates were susceptible. 
For 2,679 P. aeruginosa isolates from all infection types in European hospitals, 89.1% were susceptible 
(EUCAST, 2018) to TOL/TAZ (MIC50/90, 0.5/16 mg/L). For 1,257 P. aeruginosa isolates from European 
PIHP, 87.6% were susceptible (EUCAST) with MIC50/90 values of 0.5/32 mg/L. 
For 852 Acinetobacter spp. isolates from all infection types in European hospitals, the MIC50/90 values 
were 32/>32 mg/L. 
For 171 H. influenzae isolates from all infection types in European hospitals, the TOL/TAZ MIC50/90 values 
were 0.12/0.25 mg/L. 
Susceptibility testing 
MICs of TOL were determined using broth microdilution and agar dilution at a fixed 4 μg/mL concentration 
of  TAZ,  using  CLSI  methodology.  Disk  diffusion  susceptibility  testing  was  performed  with  a  disk 
containing 30 μg TOL and 10 μg TAZ.  
In vitro studies 
Hollow-fiber experiment 
Twenty-one clinical isolates (8 P. aeruginosa, 9 K. pneumoniae, and 4 E. coli) were tested for efficacy in 
the HF model using a concentration-time profile simulating the steady-state exposures of TOL and TAZ in 
the lung ELF of pneumonia patients receiving the 3 g dosing regimen evaluated in the Phase 3 NP study 
(PN008). Clinical isolates were selected based on their resistance mechanisms and TOL/TAZ MICs ranged 
from 2 to 256 μg/mL for the Enterobacteriaceae isolates, and 4 to 8 μg/mL for the P. aeruginosa isolates. 
Efficacy was defined as a ~ 3-log drop in CFU/mL from the starting inoculum, with no re-growth within 
69 hours. Efficacy was observed in 4 of 4 P. aeruginosa isolates with a TOL/TAZ MIC of 4 μg/mL, as well 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019 
Page 35/35 
 
  
as  in  3  of  4  isolates  with  a  TOL/TAZ  MIC  of  8  μg/mL.  Of  the  9 K.  pneumoniae   isolates,  efficacy  was 
observed only in 3 of 4 isolates with a TOL/TAZ MIC of 4 μg/mL. Of the 4 E. coli isolates, efficacy was 
observed in 1 of 1 isolate with a TOL/TAZ MIC of 16 μg/ml. 
Overall,  these  data  demonstrate  bactericidal  activity  of  3-g  TOL/TAZ  at  simulated  PK  exposures 
corresponding  to  human  SS-ELF  in  patients  with  confirmed  or  suspected  pneumonia,  supporting  the 
current  breakpoints  of  4/4  μg/mL  for  P.  aeruginosa  isolates  and  a  breakpoint  of  2/4  μg/mL  for 
Enterobacteriaceae  (i.e.  combined  with  PN008  clinical  data  hollow  fiber  results  suggest  a  1  dilution 
increase in the EUCAST breakpoint from 1 mg/L to 2 mg/L for the latter). 
Animal model studies 
Neutropenic Mouse Lung Infection Model 
The in vivo efficacy of TOL/TAZ was evaluated in a delayed treatment neutropenic mouse lung infection 
model at doses that approximate the human TOL and TAZ concentrations in SS-ELF in ventilated patients 
with suspected or confirmed pneumonia receiving the 3 g TOL/TAZ dose evaluated in the Phase 1 NP 
study (PN007). Isolates (n=5) were chosen based on their various resistance mechanisms (with MIC up 
to 4 μg/mL) to represent isolates in patients with disease.  
Efficacy in these studies was defined as a ≥1 log CFU/g decrease in lung bacterial burden 26 hours post 
infectious challenge relative to pre-treatment. Treatment with the humanized TOL/TAZ dose of 125/62.5 
mg/kg was efficacious in all K. pneumoniae isolates (including one with a TOL/TAZ MIC of 256 μg/mL), 
except one isolate with a TOL/TAZ MIC of 2 μg/mL. A 2-fold lower TOL/TAZ dose did not show comparable 
efficacy,  indicating  that  the  humanized  TOL/TAZ  dose  of  125/62.5  mg/kg  was  required  to  provide 
significant efficacy in this model. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect  
The currently approved dose regimen for TOL/TAZ in treatment of cUTI and cIAI in adults is 1.5 g q8h 
administered as a 1-hour IV infusion. The proposed TOL/TAZ dose regimen for the indication NP, including 
VAP is 2 g/1 g every 8 hours (i.e. 3 g q8h) administered in 1-hour IV infusion for a duration of 8-14 days. 
This dose regimen was selected based on probability of target attainment (PTA) analyses and Monte Carlo 
simulations (MCS), using the nonclinical PD targets,  
Non-clinical PD targets 
The non-clinical PD targets for ceftolozane and tazobactam were determined based on neutropenic mouse 
thigh infection models and are the same as those employed in MCS/PTA analyses in the initial Dossier. 
For  ceftolozane,  the  antimicrobial  effect  is  correlated  best  with  %fT>MIC  (the  time  that  free-drug 
concentrations are above the MIC). In neutropenic mouse thigh infection model using 4 P. aeruginosa and 
4 Enterobacteriaceae strains, the mean (median) %T>MIC based on total drug concentration associated 
with bacteriostasis and 1-log kill were 31.5 (32.2), respectively (Craig and Andes 2013). As TOL plasma 
protein binding in mice is  <10% and as no  notable impact of serum on MIC was observed in in  vitro 
studies, only total drug TOL was applied to these PD targets. Based on these results, the %fT>MIC of 30% 
was selected as the TOL PD target for PTA analysis. 
For tazobactam, %fT>threshold concentration (CT), which is the time above the threshold free-drug 
concentration needed to effectively neutralize the beta-lactamase enzymes produced by bacteria, was 
previously  identified  as  the  PD  parameter  of  importance  based  on  hollow-fiber  and  animal  model 
experiments.  In  neutropenic  mouse  thigh  infection  model  (04D9N8),  using  8  bacterial  strains  (4  K. 
pneumoniae and 4 E. coli), infected mice were treated with TOL doses that achieved 30% fT>MIC, in 
conjunction with different TAZ q2h or q8h dosing regimens in order to determine the PD target of TAZ. 
The applicant stated that the average TAZ %fT>1 μg/mL across bacterial strains was ~20% (for a static

effect, i.e. to obtain static effects of ceftolozane). Therefore, 20% fT>CT was selected as the TAZ PD 
target  for  PTA  analysis.  However,  in  the  submitted  study  report  (04D9N8)  it  is  stated  that  “Full 
exposure-response  relationships  (n=8,  R2  0.51-0.90)  for  TOL/TAZ  indicate  that  TAZ  q2h  was  more 
efficacious than q8h, reducing the TAZ daily dose by a factor 4.1 to 117 to obtain a static effect of the 
TOL/TAZ combination, the reduction dependent on strain and resistance mechanism. This corresponds to 
a mean %fT>CT 1 mg/L of 32% (range 14.5-51.9)”.

Selection of Phase 3 dose based on PTA analysis  
Population PK modeling and MCS were conducted to determine PTA based on the nonclinical PD targets 
for TOL and TAZ (Xiao et al. 2015). The objective was to achieve PTA >90% for the selected PD targets 
for TOL and TAZ both in plasma and ELF against pathogens with an MIC of ≤ 8 µg/mL. 
On the basis of the 2012 US/European Union PACTS surveillance data selected from hospitalized patients 
with pneumonia, the most commonly isolated pathogens of interest were Enterobacteriaceae (n=1530; 
51.5%) and P. aeruginosa (n=1019; 34.3%). The MIC distributions for these pathogens are illustrated in 
Figure 9 and Figure 10. The ceftolozane/tazobactam MIC50 and MIC90 against Enterobacteriaceae were 
0.25 and 4 mg/L, respectively, and against P. aeruginosa were 0.5 and 4 mg/L, respectively. 
The popPK model used for MCS included 2 parts, one for plasma PK and the other for plasma-to-ELF PK. 
The plasma PK model was developed with the plasma data from 8 Phase 1 studies and 2 Phase 2 studies 
in cUTI and cIAI patients. Thus, the PK model used for simulation was a mixed PK model, combining the 
plasma  PK  for  cIAI  patients  and  the  plasma-to-ELF  PK  data  from  healthy  subjects  (04D3Y0).  The 
individual TOL and TAZ concentration–time profiles in both plasma and ELF were simulated for different 
dosing regimens, including the 1.5 and 3 g TOL/TAZ doses through a 1 hr IV infusion every 8 hours for 
patients  with  normal  renal  function.  The  goal  was  to  determine  the  dosing  regimen  that  achieved  a 
PTA >90% for the 1-log kill target. An unbound fraction of 0.79 was used for ceftolozane to calculate 
the  %fT>MIC.  In  the  simulation  for  tazobactam,  an  unbound  fraction  of  0.70  was  used  to 
calculate %fT>CT. 
The generated PK profiles were then used to assess TOL and TAZ PTA for both ELF and plasma, using 
nonclinical PD targets as follows: 
- 
For TOL, targets of 24.8% and 32.2% fT>MIC to achieve bacteriostasis and 1-log kill, respectively, 
and  targets  of  40%  and  50%  fT>MIC  associated  with  greater  killing  (i.e.  2-log  kill  for 
Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa) effect were examined.  
- 
For TAZ, 20% and 30% fT>CT to achieve bacteriostasis and 1-log kill, respectively, and targets of 
40% and 50% fT>CT were examined. 
As shown in Figure 9 and 10, the PTA for TOL was consistently higher for all the % fT>MIC targets with the 
3 g dose relative to the 1.5-g dose at the targeted MIC of 8 mg/L in ELF for NP. Of note, the PTA for TOL 
was 98% against pathogens with an MIC up to 8 mg/L in ELF and 97.1% against pathogens with an MIC 
up to 16 mg/L in plasma for the 1-log kill target with the 3 g TOL/TAZ dose (Figure 5). The PTA was 95% 
for the 40% fT>MIC target up to 8 mg/L in ELF. Comparatively, at the 1.5 g dose, the PTA for 1-log kill 
was ~ 85% and 74% for pathogens with an MIC up to 8 mg/L in ELF or 16 mg/L in plasma, respectively 
(Figure 6), whereas the PTA was approximately 75% for the 40% fT>MIC target up to 8 mg/L in ELF. 
When  using  the  target  of  50%fT>MIC  for  the  3-g  TOL/TAZ  dose,  the  PTA  reached  87.7%  against 
pathogens with an MIC up to 8 mg/L in ELF. The 1.5 g dose of TOL/TAZ, however, achieved only 59% PTA 
for pathogens with an MIC up to 8 mg/L in ELF for NP.

At the dose level of 3 g TOL/TAZ, the PTA for TAZ was comparable for all targets in plasma and ELF (Figure 
11) and was higher than the PTA achieved in plasma at the 1.5-g dose. According to Xiao et al (2015), it 
was  aimed  that  the  target  attainment  in  ELF  of  the  3-g  dose  of  TOL/TAZ  in  nosocomial  pneumonia 
patients with normal renal function would not be lower than that of the 1.5-g dose in plasma for cUTI/cIAI 
patients. The authors stated further that “the MEC coverage achieved in plasma with the current dose of 
1.5 g for treatment of cUTIs and cIAIs was confirmed to be sufficient against ESBL-producing pathogens 
in the ceftolozane/tazobactam clinical trial programs”.  
Therefore,  the  applicant  considered  the  3-g  dose  of  ceftolozane/  tazobactam  as  appropriate  to  be 
evaluated in patients with nosocomial pneumonia and normal renal function, which is double the dose 
that is approved for use in patients with cUTIs and cIAIs.

Simulation of exposure and PTA analyses following Phase 3 study 
The MCSs that employed the updated NP popPK models (050ZC7) for both TOL and TAZ following the 
Phase 3 study were used to justify the dose selection for the treatment of ventilated patients with NP, and 
to support the proposed susceptibility testing interpretive criteria by assessing the PTA. 
The previously developed two separate popPK models for TOL and TAZ were refined by including PK data 
collected from 3 Phase 3 trials (PN013, PN014 and PN008) in the analysis datasets. The TOL ELF data 
in healthy and critically ill ventilated patients with proven or suspected pneumonia were incorporated in 
previous TOL popPK models (04D3Y0 and 050w2j, respectively). The structure of the ELF compartment 
from  the  previous  popPK  model  was  directly  transferred  to  the  NP  popPK  model  050ZC7  with  fixed 
parameter estimates. For TOL, a total of 8330 (including 1481 sparse PK samples from NP patients in 
PN008) plasma concentrations from 968 subjects (305 NP patients in PN008) and 47 ELF concentrations 
from  47  subjects  were  used  for  the  popPK  analysis.  For  TAZ,  a  total  of  5679  plasma  concentrations 
(including 1455 sparse PK samples from NP patients in PN008) from 835 subjects (305 NP subjects in 
PN008) and 42 ELF concentrations from 42 subjects were used. A 2-compartment model with first-order 
elimination best described the plasma concentration-time profile of both TOL and TAZ. The significant 
covariates relevant to the NP population in the model included: body weight on Vc, and Vp; CrCL on CL; 
and pneumonia on Vc. The updated popPK models were then used for stochastic simulations to generate 
plasma and ELF exposures and PTAs to justify the dose selection for the treatment of ventilated patients 
with NP. 
MCSs were performed in NONMEM (version 7.3.0) using the final popPK models to generate individual ELF 
and plasma concentration-time profiles. These analyses were based on virtual subjects randomly selected 
from a virtual population dataset containing a distribution of demographic covariates (weight) and CrCL 
that  is  representative  of  the  intended  patient  population.  A  total  of  1000  virtual  individuals  were 
generated in each of the renal function categories. TOL/TAZ doses of 3 g (i.e. 2/1 g), 1.5 g (i.e. 1/0.5 g), 
and 0.750 g (i.e. 0.5/0.25 g) administered as 1-hour IV infusion were used to generate PK profiles in 
subjects with normal and mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. The 3 g dose was 
also evaluated in subjects with augmented renal clearance (ARC).

The generated PK profiles were then used to assess TOL and TAZ PTA for both ELF and plasma, using 
non-clinical PD targets as follows: 
- 
- 
For TOL: 30% fT>MIC to achieve 1-log kill. 
For TAZ: 20%fT>Ct of 1 μg/mL to achieve 1-log kill. 
PTA was defined as the percent of patients who achieved PD targets of %fT>MIC ≥ 30% for ceftolozane at 
MIC of 8 µg/ml and/or %fT>CT ≥ 20% for tazobactam at the CT of 1 µg/ml. 
Further,  the  steady-state  exposures  in  the  patients  with  NP  from  PN008  receiving  adjusted  dosing 
regimens based on CrCL were estimated using the Bayesian parameter estimates from the final models 
for  ceftolozane  and  tazobactam.  Results  of  steady-state  exposures  between  different  renal  function 
groups are presented in the boxplots (Figure 7).

A summary of target attainment parameters in plasma and ELF is provided in Table 12 and Table 13 for 
ceftolozane and tazobactam by CrCL groups, respectively.  These PTA analyses were performed only at a 
TOL/TAZ MIC of 8 μg/mL.

For virtual NP  patients  with  normal  renal  function  (80 mL/min≤CrCL <150 mL/min) receiving 3-g 
TOL/TAZ, the TOL ELF PTA was 98% at a TOL/TAZ MIC of 8 μg/mL (Table 14), and the TOL plasma PTA 
was >90% at a TOL/TAZ MIC of 16 μg/mL. The TAZ ELF PTA was 98% at a TAZ CT of 1 μg/mL for the PD 
target 20% of fT>CT (Table 15), and the TAZ plasma PTA was >90% at a TAZ CT of 2 μg/mL.

For patients with mild renal impairment (50 mL/min≤CrCL <80 mL/min), similar exposure levels and 
PTA were attained as the patients with normal renal function. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required.  
For  virtual  NP  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment  (30  mL/min  ≤  CrCL≤50  mL/min)  receiving 
CrCL-adjusted  TOL/TAZ  doses  of  1.5  g  which  is  2-fold  the  recommended  CrCL-adjusted  doses  for 
cIAI/cUTI patients with moderate renal impairment, the TOL ELF PTA was >90% at a TOL/TAZ MIC of up 
to 8 μg/mL (Table14), and the TOL plasma PTA was >90% at a TOL/TAZ MICs of up to 16 μg/mL. The TAZ 
ELF PTA was >90% at a TAZ CT of 1 μg/mL (Table 15), and the TAZ plasma PTA was >90% at a CT of 
2 μg/mL.  
For  virtual  NP  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  (15  mL/min  ≤  CrCL  ≤29  mL/min)  receiving 
CrCL-adjusted  doses  of  0.75  g,  which  is  2-fold  the  recommended  CrCL-adjusted  doses  for  cIAI/cUTI 
patients, the TOL ELF PTA was >90% at a TOL/TAZ MIC of up to 8 μg/mL (Table 14), and the TOL plasma 
PTA was >90% at a TOL/TAZ MIC of up to 16 μg/mL. The TAZ ELF PTA was 87.2% at a TAZ CT of 1 μg/mL 
(Table 15), and the TAZ plasma PTA was >90% at a CT of 2 μg/mL.  
For virtual NP patients with ARC (CrCL ≥150 mL/min) at the 3 g dose, the TOL ELF PTA was >90% at a 
TOL/TAZ MICs of up to 4 μg/mL (Table 14), and the TOL plasma PTA was >90% at a TOL/TAZ MIC up to 
16 μg/mL. The TAZ ELF PTA was >90% at a CT of 1 μg/mL (Table 15), and the TAZ plasma PTA was >90% 
at a TAZ CT of 2 μg/ml.

Clinical exposure-response relationship 
Exposure-response (E/R) analysis was conducted to assess the potential relationship between TOL and 
TAZ  plasma  PK  and  the  two  primary  efficacy  endpoints  evaluated  in  study  PN008:  Day  28  all-cause 
mortality  and  clinical  response  at  TOC  visit.  However,  no  interpretable  trend  between  either  efficacy 
endpoint and TAZ %fT> CT (1 μg/mL) was identified.  
Of  the  231  subjects  in  the  E/R  analysis  dataset,  the  highest  baseline  TOL/TAZ  MIC  from  relevant 
pathogens for the 177 subjects was ≤4 μg/mL. The TOL plasma %fT>MIC was >30% for all 177 subjects. 
Notably, TOL plasma %fT>MIC was 99% for 173 of the 177 subjects, and the lowest %fT>MIC in the 
remaining 4 subjects was 73.7%. The all-cause mortality rate and clinical cure rate in these 177 subjects 
were 13.3% and 70%, respectively.  
Assessment report

Page 45/45 
 
  
 
 
 
 
A  total  of  65.4%  patients  (151  out  of  231)  were  considered  a  clinical  cure  at  the  TOC  visit  in  the 
E-R-efficacy  population  (Table  16).  The  occurrence  of  clinical  cure  at  the  TOC  visit  was  70.6%  (125 
patients out of 177) in patients with an MIC ≤ 4 μg/mL as compared to 48% (26 patients out of 54) in 
patients with MIC > 4 μg/mL. Of the 177 with an MIC ≤ 4 μg/mL, the clinical cure rate for the 173 patients 
with %fT>MIC of 99% was 70% versus 100% in the remaining 4 patients, suggesting a lack of an E-R 
relationship with ceftolozane exposures. 
In  the  final  E/R  report,  it  was  stated  that:  “In  patients  with  an  MIC  below  the  breakpoint,  the 
mean %fT>MIC was higher in patients (98.6%) as compared to patients above the breakpoint (47.7%); 
the all-cause mortality rate on Day 28 was 13% in the 177 patients with an MIC below the breakpoint as 
compared to 24% in the 54 patients with an MIC above the breakpoint, respectively”. 
As  no  AEs  met  the  pre-defined  criteria  for  in  the  E-R  safety  analysis,  no  safety  E-R  modeling  was 
conducted.  
The applicant concluded that there was no E-R relationship trend with both TOL and TAZ in patients with 
an MIC ≤ 4 µg/mL as all patients achieving exposures above the PD targets.

Clinical trials 
In the pivotal study PN008, microbiological cure rates at TOC were in general comparable between the 
study arms, slightly favoring TOL/TAZ in ME population. No correlation was observed between MIC and 
outcome in either treatment group.  
In  patients  with  P.  aeruginosa  isolates,  higher  microbiological  eradication  rates  were  observed  in  the 
TOL/TAZ arm compared to the meropenem arm in the mITT population [i.e. 74% (47/63) vs 63% (41/55), 
respectively]. Microbiological response rate against AmpC overexpressing P. aeruginosa isolates was (6/9) 
66% vs. (1/6) 16% in the TOL/TAZ arm vs. the meropenem arm, respectively.  
Assessment report

For  ESBL-Enterobacteriaceae  isolates,  slightly  lower  microbiological  cure  rates  were  observed  for  the 
TOL/TAZ arm compared to the meropenem arm (mITT); 66% (56/84) vs. 71% (52/73), respectively. 
Regarding the ESBL-K. pneumoniae, lower microbiological cure rates were observed in the TOL/TAZ arm 
compared to the meropenem arm (mITT); 62% (33/53) vs. 73% (38/52), respectively. 
For  H.  influenzae,  microbiological  eradication  rates  were  higher  in  the  TOL/TAZ  arm  than  in  the 
meropenem arm [90% (20/22) vs. 73% (11/16) in mITT population, respectively]. 
The number of isolates with MIC ≥8 μg/mL encountered in the study PN008 were in general limited, 
especially with P.  aeruginosa isolates (n=5). For Enterobacteriaceae and K. pneumoniae, a total of 41 
and 34 isolates had higher MIC values of ≥ 8 μg /mL. For these isolates, no correlation was observed 
between MIC and outcome, and compared isolates with MIC < 8 μg /mL. 
Resistance development 
Incidences of emergence of non-susceptibility (i.e. >1 dilution change in MIC) were comparable between 
the  study  arms  in  PN008;  29  (12.7%)  subjects  in  the  TOL/TAZ  arm  vs.  28  (12.0%)  subjects  in  the 
meropenem  arm  by  the  TOC  visit.  In  the  TOL/TAZ  treatment  arm,  the  most  common  pathogens  to 
develop non-susceptibility were 11 K. pneumoniae and 8 A. baumannii isolates; among P. aeruginosa 
isolates, 3 developed non-susceptibility. A lower percentage of subjects with P. aeruginosa isolates in the 
TOL/TAZ  treatment  arm  (3/63,  4.8%)  developed  non-susceptibility  compared  to  the  meropenem 
treatment arm (17/65, 26.2%). Among 29 subjects in whom non-susceptibility emerged in the TOL/TAZ 
treatment arm, 17 (59%) and 17 (59%) subjects had clinical and microbiological cure at the TOC visit, 
respectively. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The current application concerns the extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with 
nosocomial pneumonia (NP) at a 3g q8h dose. Single dose and multiple dose PK data have been obtained 
for TOL/TAZ at doses up to 4.5 g and 3 g daily up to ten days, respectively (original MAA). Additional 
studies (PN018, PN007, PN008) as well as popPK and ER modelling have been performed since the 
original cIAI/cUTI application to provide data to support the present application. 
Validated  LC/MS/MS  bioanalytical  methods  (in  accordance  with  the  EMA  bioanalytical  guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009  Rev.  1)  were  used  for  analysis  of  TOL,  TAZ  and  TAZ  M1  in  plasma, 
urine, dialysate and epithelial lining fluid samples from the clinical studies.  
Several popPK models have been developed throughout Zerbaxa product development, with separate 
models for each active substance. The preceding models are overall similar to the most recent ones with 
respect to base structure and co-variates. The main model (050zc7) includes phase I ELF PK data from 
healthy subjects and pneumonia patients, and sparse phase 3 plasma PK data from ventilated NP patients 
(PN008). The model is used to estimate probability of target attainment to further justify the proposed 
dosing regimen in NP patients with normal, augmented or impaired renal function, and is considered to be 
of low to moderate regulatory impact. 
Overall,  the  methodology  is  considered  appropriate.  The  final  models  for  TOL  and  TAZ  were 
2-compartment models with first-order elimination. For TOL and TAZ (pneumonia population), significant 
covariates  were  BW  on  Vc  and  Vp,  CrCL  on  CL  and  pneumonia  on  Vc.  In  addition,  pneumonia  was  a 
covariate on Vp in the TOL model. Diagnostic plots are overall adequate for the TOL  and  TAZ model, 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019 
Page 47/47 
 
  
 
although they indicate that the TAZ model does not fully capture the observed. The VPC plots for the 
overall  and  NP  populations  look  acceptable.  The  popPK  models  need  to  be  sufficiently  robust  for 
simulations and subsequent PK/PD analyses to evaluate PTA. Additional VPC plots provided in the RSI 
response demonstrated that the model adequately captures the observed PK concentrations in patients 
from study PN008 and in patients within the different renal function categories. 
Results from study PN007 indicate that TOL and TAZ distributes into the lung of ventilated patients with 
suspected pneumonia. Total ELF to free plasma AUC ratios for TOL and TAZ in ventilated patients with 
suspected  pneumonia  were  50%  and  62%,  respectively,  overall  similar  to  penetration  ratios  seen  in 
healthy  subjects  (61%  and  63%,  respectively).  The  observed  penetration  ratio  supports  the  use  of 
TOL/TAZ in pneumonia. 
The proposed dose is within the established linearity range. The slight accumulation noted for both TOL 
and TAZ following multiple doses of 3 g q8h in patients with suspected or proven pneumonia (PN007) 
was likely attributed to the high variability in CrCL of included patients. In the popPK analysis, IIV for TOL 
and TAZ were found to be moderate. 
Based on model-predictions, TOL and TAZ AUC0-8h in pneumonia patients is comparable to that of healthy 
subjects, while Cmax is lower (25-30%), attributed to the larger volume of distribution in NP patients 
(~2-fold  higher).  Variability  is  markedly  higher  in  patients  compared  to  healthy  subjects.  Estimated 
exposures (AUC) appear to be ~2-fold of those estimated for the cUTI and cIAI populations receiving 1.5 
g q8h. 
Only sparse PK data in plasma were collected in study PN008 and the applicant relies on plasma from 
PN007 to characterise PK in NP patients. It is not clear in what extent these patients had a similar degree 
of infection-associated systemic disturbances as patients with confirmed nosocomial pneumonia in the 
pivotal study. Reassuringly, observed concentrations in PN008 were adequately captured by the popPK 
models. 
TOL  and  TAZ  are  eliminated  by  the  kidney,  and  dosage  adjustments  according  to  renal  function  are 
warranted.  The  same  percent  reduction  in  dose  as  recommended  for  cUTI  and  cIAI  patients  with 
moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment  are  proposed  (i.e.  a  50%  and  25%  reduction  in  TOL/TAZ, 
respectively). TOL and TAZ model-predicted exposures in NP patients with renal impairment using the 
proposed posology are overall comparable to those of NP patients with normal renal function. Updated 
PTA analysis, taking variability into account, support the proposed doses of TOL and TAZ in patients with 
mild and moderate renal impairment.  
All subjects with moderate/severe renal impairment at baseline received the per-protocol reduced dose 
within the treatment period. 52 (14,4%) patients with moderate/severe renal impairment were treated 
with  TOL/TAZ,  47  (12.9%)  were  treated  with  meropenem.  In  32  (61.5%)  and  26  (55.3%)  patients 
treated with TOL/TAZ and meropenem, respectively, the treatment failed. Analysis of underlying cause of 
the  disease  revealed  that  in  patients  suffering  from  VABP,  treatment  failure  rates  reached  65.2% 
(15 patients) and 58.3% (14 patients) in patients treated with TOL/TAZ and meropenem respectively. In 
patients with ventilated HABP, the failure rates were 58.6% (17 patients) and 52.2% (12) in patients 
treated with TOL/TAZ and meropenem respectively. 
In ESRD patients requiring HD a loading dose of 2.25 g followed by maintenance dose of 450 mg q8h (i.e. 
reduction by 75% and 15% compared to the dose in NP patients with normal renal function), is proposed. 
The  maintenance  dose  is  suggested  to  be  given  at  the  earliest  possible  time  following  end  of 
haemodialysis.  Simulated TOL  and  TAZ  exposures  (AUC0-8h,  Cmax)  were  overall  within  the  range  of 
model-predicted  exposures  in  NP  patients  from  study  PN008.  The  proposed  dose  adjustments  for 
patients  with  ESRD  is  considered  appropriate  based  on  the  updated  PTA  analysis  provided  in  the  RSI 
response. 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019 
Page 48/48 
 
  
No dose adjustment is currently proposed for NP patients with augmented renal clearance (ARC; ≥150 
mL/min).  Model-predicted  AUC0-8h,ss  (PN008)  decline  with  increasing  CrCL  within  the  three  ARC 
categories compared to NP patients with normal renal function. The lack of dose recommendations in 
patients with ARC was adequately justified in the response to the 2nd RSI. 
Based on the popPK analysis, race or body weight had no significant impact on TOL or TAZ PK. 
Findings  from  in  vitro  metabolism  and  transporter  studies  conducted  in  support  of  the  original  1.5  g 
TOL/TAZ dose regimen can be extended to the proposed 3 g TOL/TAZ dose regimen. The potential for 
DDIs to occur is considered to be relatively low. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The currently approved dose regimen for TOL/TAZ in treatment of cUTI and cIAI in adults is 1.5 g q8h 
administered as a 1-hour IV infusion. The proposed TOL/TAZ dose regimen for the indication NP, including 
VAP is 2 g/1 g every 8 hours (i.e. 3 g q8h) administered in 1-hour IV infusion for a duration of 8-14 days.  
Although the dose is increased to 3 g for patients with NP/VAP, the TOL/TAZ exposure at the infection site 
(i.e. in ELF) will likely be comparable to plasma exposures achieved in patients with cIAI and cUTI as only 
50% and 60% of these drugs penetrates to ELF, respectively. 
Non-clinical PD targets 
The non-clinical PD targets for ceftolozane and tazobactam were determined based on neutropenic mouse 
thigh infection models (i.e. plasma-derived) and are the same as those employed in MCS/PTA analyses in 
the initial Dossier. 
For ceftolozane, the antimicrobial effect is correlated best with %fT>MIC. Based on neutropenic mouse 
thigh infection model using P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae strains, 30% fT>MIC (for 1 log kill), 
was selected as the TOL PD target for PTA analysis. In addition, 40% fT>MIC and 50% fT>MIC targets 
were employed to obtain 2 log-kill for Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, respectively.  
For tazobactam, %fT>threshold concentration needed to protect ceftolozane from the beta-lactamase 
enzymes produced by bacteria is the important factor for efficacy. Based on the neutropenic mouse thigh 
infection model, 20% fT>CT (stasis) and 35% fT>CT (1-log-kill) were selected as the TAZ PD target for 
PTA analysis. This would provide sufficient tazobactam exposures to protect ceftolozane from hydrolysis 
(i.e.  as  long  as  ceftolozane  is  required  for  activity  to  obtain  at  least  1  log-kill).  This  protection  is 
particularly important against ESBL- producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates.  
Selection of dose  
For the selection of Phase 3 dose regimen, popPK modelling (including Phase 1 and 2 data, and ELF data 
from healthy subjects) and MCS were conducted using the non-clinical PD targets. For both TOL and TAZ, 
both the targets of 20% and ~30% fT>MIC/T>CT to achieve bacteriostasis and 1-log kill, respectively, 
were examined, in addition to 40% and 50% fT>MIC/fT>CT targets for greater killing effect against key 
respiratory  pathogens  (i.e.  P.  aeruginosa  and  Enterobacteriaceae,  respectively). The  objective  was  to 
achieve PTA >90% for the selected PD targets for TOL and TAZ both in plasma and ELF against pathogens 
with an MIC of ≤ 8 µg/mL.  
PTA simulations suggested a high target achievement of >95% in ELF for ceftolozane with 3-g dose for 
the 1-log kill and 40% targets against pathogens with an MIC up to 8 mg/L while PTA was ~87% for the 
target  of  50%fT>MIC.  For  tazobactam,  the  PTA  was  comparable  for  all  targets  in  plasma  and  ELF 
following the 3-g dose. While >90% PTA was achieved for 20% and 30% fT>CT both in plasma and ELF 
at CT of 1 µg/ml, much lower PTAs of 85% and 65% were achieved in ELF for 40% and 50% fT>CT targets, 
respectively.

Of note, no simulations have been conducted to investigate prolongation of the infusion time, which might 
have led to higher target attainments (i.e. better coverage with pathogens with high MIC values) for both 
ceftolozane and tazobactam. 
Simulations following Phase 3 study 
Once the Phase 3 data from patients with NP/VAP were available, the popPK model was updated to justify 
the  selected  dose  regimen,  including  also  data  from  cIAI  and  cUTI  studies  as  well  as  ELF  data  from 
critically-ill patients. 
In general, target attainments were much higher in plasma than ELF for TOL, as expected. At a TOL/TAZ 
MIC of 8 μg/mL, 98% PTA was achieved in ELF based on the PD target of 30%T>MIC for TOL, according 
to the MCSs in virtual patients with normal renal function. Additional PTA data using more conservative 
targets of 40% and 50% T>MIC for TOL showed that >99% target attainments are achieved in ELF for 
MIC  up  to  4  µg/ml  in  all  renal  function  categories  (including  patients  with  ESRD  with  a  PTA  >97%). 
Further, >95% target attainments achieved in ELF for MIC up to 8 µg/ml in all renal categories except for 
ARC categories of 180 mL/min≤CrCL>210 mL/min and CrCL≥210 mL/min (for these PTAs were ~92% and 
87%, respectively). For plasma, even better results were obtained. These results are reassuring  with 
regards to adequacy of TOL dose for treatment of patients with NP/VAP. 
For tazobactam, PTA data using the PD target of 35% fT>CT=1 μg/mL revealed that patients with renal 
function categories between 30 to 150 ml/min achieved >95% target attainment in the ELF while 84% of 
patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  and  86-90%  of  patients  with  ARC  with  a  CrCL  ≥150  ml/min 
achieved  target  attainment.  For  both  subgroups  of  ARC  patients  and  patients  with  severe  renal 
impairment, available clinical data from PN008 showed that clinical success rate and mortality rates were 
comparable  to  patients  with  normal  renal  function  as  well  as  to  patients  in  the  meropenem  arm.  In 
addition,  very  high  PTA  achieved  in  plasma  is  reassuring  regarding  the  patients  with  severe  renal 
impairment. Although extrapolation of clinical outcome data to a larger population is hampered by the 
TAZ PTA <90% for patient with ARC and uncertainties about the magnitude of the PTA estimate due to 
sparse  PK  data  from  this  subpopulation,  available  clinical  data  support  that  efficacy  was  comparable 
between patients with and without ARC. Overall, the TAZ dose can be considered sufficient for restoring 
antibacterial TOL activity in all renal categories, including patients with extremes of ARC as well as severe 
renal impairment.  
Additional joint PTA data in ELF and plasma using the PD target of 40% and 50%T>MIC for TOL and the 
PD target of 35% fT>CT=1 μg/mL for TAZ were provided. These data revealed that patients with renal 
function categories between 30 to 150 ml/min achieved >94% target attainment in the ELF while 84% of 
patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  and  85-90%  of  patients  with  ARC  with  a  CrCL  ≥150  ml/min 
achieved target attainment at MIC ≤4 mg/L. These results revealed that TAZ dose is the limiting factor for 
achieving higher target attainments.  
Separate simulations for patients with ESRD using the above mentioned TAZ target showed that daily ELF 
PTA  is  >90%  on  non-dialysis  days  and  >88%  on  dialysis  days  of  the  14-day  treatment  period  at 
CT=1 μg/mL while daily plasma PTA is 99% for the entire treatment period. These target attainments 
hold true in the joint PTA analyses at MIC=4 μg/mL for both ELF and plasma. Although there is drop in 
concentration in dialysis days, generally higher PTAs achieved in ELF. Further, it is reassuring that plasma 
PTA was constantly >99% during the entire treatment period. The proposed dose adjustment for patients 
with  ESRD  is  considered  appropriate  although  a  PTA  of  >95%  on  non-dialysis  days  could  have  been 
preferable. 
Although no E-R relationship trend could be found with TOL or TAZ in patients with an MIC ≤4 µg/mL as 
all  patients  achieved  exposures  above  the  PD  targets,  Efficacy  Response  comparisons  by  MIC  Group 
reveal that a higher proportion of subjects with an MIC ≤ 4 µg/mL achieved clinical cure at the TOC visit 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019

compared to patients with MIC > 4 µg/mL (i.e. 70% vs. 48%). In addition, all-cause mortality on Day 28 
was higher in patients with MIC > 8 µg/mL compared to those with MIC ≤4 µg/mL [i.e. 24.1% (13/54) vs. 
13% (23/177)]. It is noted that patients with MIC ≤ 4 µg/mL achieved more than twice the ceftolozane 
exposures using the 30% T>MIC target (i.e. 98% vs. 47%) while TAZ exposures were similar. These 
results indicate a trend of better clinical outcomes and lower mortality in patients with an MIC ≤ 4 µg/mL. 
Whereas, these findings do not provide reassurance that the proposed dose will sufficiently cover bacteria 
with MIC > 4 μg/mL (i.e. up to 8 µg/mL or higher). 
Clinical and microbiological success rates in the TOL/TAZ arm seem to be comparable to those in the 
meropenem arm for P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae isolates with baseline MIC values of ≤4 µg/mL 
and ≤2 µg /mL, respectively. Overall, MIC-based clinical outcomes data do not provide sufficient evidence 
in support of the adequacy of the dose regimen (especially the tazobactam dose) to cover bacteria with 
MIC up to 8 µg/mL and higher, as vast majority of the treated isolated had MIC ≤4 μg/mL in PN008.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
All  issues  regarding  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  have  been  satisfactorily  addressed.  In 
general, proposed ceftolozane-tazobactam dose of 3 g q8h and the proposed dose adjustments for some 
renal function categories, including ESRD, is considered appropriate. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The indication applied for are: 
“Nosocomial pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia.” 
The clinical support for this indication mainly include one pivotal Phase 3 study. In addition, supportive 
data for administration of ceftolozane/tazobactam (TOL/TAZ) at a dose of 3 g q8h were obtained from 
three Phase 1 studies (PN007, PN018, PN028). Study PN007 provided PK data in a population intended to 
be comparable to the study population for the NP indication. Study PN018 studied impact of race in PK. 
PN028 were assessed in the original marketing application and provided PK data in healthy subjects.  
An overview of the pivotal clinical study supporting the variation application of ceftolozane/tazobactam in 
NP, including ventilator-associated pneumonia is provided in the table below.

2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
A higher dose of 3 g ceftolozane/tazobactam (comprising 2 g ceftolozane and 1 g tazobactam), compared 
with the currently approved dose of 1.5 g for patients with cUTI and cIAI, was selected based on popPK 
modelling and Monte Carlo simulations. The modelling approach and adequacy of the proposed dose are 
discussed in sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study PN008 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of ceftolozane/tazobactam in 
the treatment of adult subjects with ventilated nosocomial pneumonia (including VAP and ventilated HAP 
subjects), compared with meropenem. Approximately 726 subjects were planned to be randomized 1:1 
to receive either ceftolozane/tazobactam or meropenem. The number of subjects enrolled with VAP was 
planned to be at least 50% of the randomized population. The overall study design is shown in the table 
below.

Table 18. Study design PN008 
Methods 
Study  assessments  at  baseline,  during  study  drug  therapy  and  at  scheduled  study  visits  included 
components of the APACHE II score as an inclusion criterion (until 15 Mar 2016, protocol amendment 
5.0),  Clinical  Pulmonary  Infection  Scores  (CPIS),  Sepsis  Organ  Failure  Assessment  (SOFA)  scores, 
procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements and safety labs. Quantitative LRT cultures were 
required in intubated patients at specified time points during study therapy. 
Local  (i.e.  site  laboratory)  or  regional  laboratory  results  were  used  to  determine  patient  eligibility  for 
study enrolment as well as for the ongoing management of the patient during the treatment period. 
The lower respiratory tract culture specimen could be obtained by any one of the techniques mentioned 
in  inclusion  criteria  number  4  (refer  to  the  table  below).  However,  at  sites  where  bronchoscopic  or 
mini-BAL or PBS were available, these modalities were strongly recommended, instead of an ETA, for 
obtaining the baseline LRT specimen. Whenever possible, it was recommended that the same method 
used  to  obtain  the  baseline  LRT  specimen  be  used  consistently  throughout  the  study  for  obtaining 
post-baseline LRT specimens. 
All patients had to have a chest radiograph for inclusion into the study. The Investigator’s interpretation 
(or that of a qualified designee at the site) of the chest x-ray was used to make the enrolment decision. 
However, in addition to the local reading of chest-x-rays, a centralized independent second evaluation of 
the baseline and day 8 chest x-ray was conducted on all patients enrolled in the study. 
Patients  were  hospitalized  throughout  the  treatment  period  and  completed  all  study  treatment 
intravenously. No oral switch was permitted in this study.  
The LFU visit could be conducted in person or via a telephone call. A telephonic LFU assessment was only 
permitted  to  assess  the  patient’s  wellbeing  if  the  patient  had  no  known  adverse  events  or  laboratory 
abnormalities that required an in-person follow-up assessment. 
Analysis  of  susceptibility  was  based  on  data  from  the  central  microbiology  lab  when  available.  For 
subjects without central lab susceptibility data at baseline local lab data was used.

Dose adjustment criteria for the study drugs 
Dose adjustment for TOL/TAZ and meropenem was  made for subjects with moderate or severe renal 
insufficiency. Please refer to the tables below. 
Dose  adjustments  for  renal  insufficiency  were  performed  by  the  un-blinded  pharmacist  following 
notification from the PI, including the subject’s CrCL value. 
Table 21. Recommended intravenous dose regimens for ceftolozane/tazobactam according to 
renal function 
Table 22. Recommended intravenous dose regimens for meropenem according to renal 
function 
The total number of infusions may increase if a dose adjustment is required based on renal function due 
to the addition of dummy infusions. 
In cases where dosing every 8 hours is used for both ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem, the use of 
a dummy infusion is not required. 
Conversely, to maintain blinding of the dosing regimens when meropenem is required to be dosed every 
12 hours, the subjects’ treatment schedule must be adjusted to 4 infusions per day. These 4 infusions are 
to  accommodate  the  3  every  8  hours  infusions  for  ceftolozane/tazobactam  and  the  2  every  12  hours 
infusions for meropenem (the first infusion for active drug and dummy infusions should be administered 
simultaneously at time zero, therefore, leading to a total of 4 total infusions per day). 
Subjects  who  develop  a  CrCL  <15  mL/minute  or  who  were  placed  on  dialysis  or  hemofiltration  were 
withdrawn from study drug because dose recommendations of ceftolozane/tazobactam for such subjects 
have not yet been determined. 
Non-study antibiotic use 
In the 72 hours preceding the first dose of study drug for treatment of the current VNP, subjects may not 
receive more than 24 hours (i.e. >1 dose of a once daily antibiotic, >2 doses of a twice daily antibiotic, 
etc.) of antibiotic therapy active against gram-negative pathogens known to cause VNP. Exceptions to 
this prior antibiotic rule are noted under Exclusion criteria #3.

After  randomization,  non-study  antibiotics  for  the  treatment  of  VNP  are  not  permitted  except  in  the 
following circumstances: 
-  Allowed  empiric  adjunctive  therapy  (as  described  below)  administered  at  baseline  for 
potential resistant pathogens, OR 
- 
For treatment of documented clinical and/or microbiologic failure. 
If non-study antibiotics for the treatment of VNP are required after randomization, the subject must be 
discontinued from study treatment. 
Empiric therapy at baseline 
Empiric gram-positive adjunctive therapy 
Subjects  were  required  to  receive  empiric  gram-positive  adjunctive  therapy  (linezolid)  at  baseline. 
Alternatives to linezolid could be permitted (if these were standard of care or the patient did not tolerate 
linezolid)  but  only  after  discussion  and  prior  approval  from  the  Medical  Monitor.  At  sites  with  a  low 
incidence of MRSA pneumonia (e.g., MRSA prevalence <5% as determined by the local antibiogram), the 
investigator  could  request,  from  the  Medical  Monitor,  substitution  of  linezolid  with  a  semisynthetic 
penicillin. If S. aureus (MRSA or MSSA) was not isolated from baseline LRT culture, the investigator was 
recommended to discontinue linezolid and complete treatment with assigned study drug alone. Patients 
whose baseline LRT culture grew both a gram-negative pathogen and S. aureus (MRSA or MSSA) should 
complete treatment with study drug and with linezolid. 
Empiric gram-negative adjunctive therapy 
Subjects were permitted to receive adjunctive gram-negative (aminoglycoside-amikacin) therapy for ≤72 
hours  started  at  baseline  (at  sites  with  >15%  carbapenem  resistant  P.  aeruginosa)  pending  baseline 
culture results. Aminoglycosides other than amikacin may be permitted if standard of care at the site, but 
only  after  discussion  and  prior  approval  from  the  Medical  Monitor.  Upon  receipt  of  the  baseline  LRT 
microbiology results (including study drug susceptibility), if the isolate(s) were susceptible to both study 
drugs,  empiric  amikacin  had  to  be  discontinued  immediately  and  study  drug  alone  continued  for  the 
remainder  of  the  treatment  duration.  Concomitant  therapy  with  study  drug  and  amikacin  (or  other 
approved gram-negative adjunctive therapy) was not permitted after day 3. 
From the protocol: 
Upon availability of the baseline LRT culture and pathogen susceptibility results: 
Management of study drug and empiric gram-negative adjunctive therapy: 
• 
• 
• 
If all gram-negative isolates are resistant to both study drugs: study drug must be discontinued, 
appropriate non-study antibiotics started, and the subject followed for safety through the LFU 
visit. 
If gram-negative isolate(s) with varying susceptibility results is/are present: the Investigator is 
strongly encouraged to base decisions regarding continuation or discontinuation of study therapy 
on the clinical presentation of the patient and the totality of the available clinical and laboratory 
data,  including  the  baseline  LRT  culture  susceptibility  testing  results.  Empiric  gram-negative 
adjunctive therapy, if started at baseline, must be discontinued after 72 hours. 
If  no  growth  of  any  gram-negative  organism:  study  drug  should  be  continued  based  on  the 
discretion  of  the  Investigator  and  guided  by  the  subject’s  clinical  response.  Empiric 
gram-negative adjunctive therapy, if started at baseline, must be discontinued after 72 hours. 
Management of empiric gram-positive adjunctive therapy:

• 
• 
If S. aureus (MSSA or MRSA) is present [with or without a gram-negative pathogen]: linezolid 
should be continued for a minimum of 8 days. If MSSA is the only LRT pathogen isolated, the 
Investigator  may  switch  the  gram-positive  adjunctive  therapy  to  an  anti-staphylococcal 
semisynthetic  penicillin  (with  gram-positive  coverage  only)  and  complete  treatment  with  the 
semisynthetic penicillin. 
If  S.  aureus  (MRSA  or  MSSA)  does  not  grow:  empiric  gram-positive  coverage  should  be 
discontinued, unless in the opinion of the Investigator, continuation provides expected benefit for 
the  patient.  If  gram-positive  adjunctive  therapy  is  discontinued  and  then  a  subsequent, 
post-baseline LRT culture shows presence of S. aureus, the appropriate gram-positive adjunctive 
therapy may be reinitiated (i.e., linezolid if MRSA or anti-staphylococcal semisynthetic penicillin 
for MSSA).

Per-pathogen microbiological response at EOT in the ME population 
Per-pathogen clinical response at TOC by baseline MIC in the mITT and ME populations 
Definition of clinical outcomes at TOC, EOT and LFU visit 
Clinical response at the TOC visit will be classified as cure, failure, or indeterminate. A favourable clinical 
response is “clinical cure.” 
Table 23. Clinical Response Categories at the TOC and EOT visit 
Clinical response at the LFU visit will be classified as sustained cure, relapse, or indeterminate only in 
patients deemed a clinical cure at the TOC visit. A favourable clinical response is “sustained clinical cure.”

Definition of emergent infections 
Qualifying pathogens other than the causative baseline pathogen isolated after baseline assessment will 
be  assessed  as  a  superinfection  or  new  infection.  A  qualifying  emergent  pathogen  is  defined  as  one 
meeting  the  threshold  of  ≥105  CFU/mL  (for  an  ETA  specimen),  ≥104  CFU/mL  (for  a  BAL  or  mini-BAL 
specimen), or ≥103 CFU/mL (for a specimen obtained by PBS).

Analysis populations 
ITT Population 
The ITT population consisted of all randomized subjects with documented informed consent, regardless of 
whether or not they received study drug. Subjects in the ITT population were categorized based on the 
treatment arm to which they were randomized. No subjects were excluded from the ITT population due to 
important deviations or premature un-blinding of study treatment. 
mITT Population 
The  mITT  population  was  a  subset  of  the  ITT  population  that  included  any  subject  who  received  any 
amount of study drug and had at least 1 bacterial respiratory pathogen isolated from the baseline LRT 
culture  that  was  susceptible  to  at  least  1  of  the  study  drugs.  Subjects  with  a  non-streptococcal 
gram-positive pathogen as their only baseline LRT pathogen were excluded from the mITT population. No 
subjects were excluded from the mITT population due to important deviations or premature un-blinding 
of study treatment. 
CE Population 
The CE population was a subset of the ITT population that included any subject who received study drug, 
adhered to the study protocol through the TOC visit, and had an evaluable clinical outcome (either Cure 
or Failure) at the TOC visit (or were classified as a clinical failure prior to the TOC visit). 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019 
Page 61/61 
 
  
 
 
 
 
ME Population 
The ME population was a subset of the mITT population that included any subject who adhered to the 
study protocol through the TOC visit, had an evaluable clinical outcome (Cure or Failure) at the TOC visit 
(or  were  classified  as  clinical  failure  prior  to  the  TOC  visit),  and  had  at  least  1  bacterial  respiratory 
pathogen (at the appropriate CFU/mL threshold) isolated from the baseline LRT culture. To be eligible for 
the ME population, the following quantitative bacterial counts were required: ≥105 CFU/mL for ETA, ≥104 
CFU/mL for BAL/mini-BAL, and ≥103 CFU/mL for PBS. 
Safety Analysis Population 
All safety analyses were based on a subset of the ITT population (the Safety Population), who received 
any  amount  (i.e.,  full  or  partial  dose)  of  study  drug.  All  subjects  received  their  randomly  assigned 
treatments, and no subjects with important deviations were excluded from the safety population. 
Sample size 
This population comprised totally 726 subjects (i.e., 362 in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. 364 in the 
meropenem arm). The study was designed to have at least 85.3% power to meet non-inferiority for the 
primary endpoint, assuming a cure rate of 58.4% in both arms. It was initially powered at 88%, but power 
decreased  due  to  the  planned  futility  look  by  DSMB  when  approximately  30%  of  patients  had  been 
enrolled. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was stratified by diagnosis (HABP or VABP) and by age (≥65 or <65 years) to balance 
distribution of 726 subjects between the 2 double-blind treatment arms. Three pre-specified sensitivity 
analyses for the primary efficacy endpoints were conducted to confirm the overall robustness of the study 
results: 1) unadjusted for the stratification factors, 2) based on randomized stratification from IRT to 
evaluate the impact from mis-stratifications, and 3) stratified and un-stratified approaches based on a 
subset of subjects that were not forced randomized. Additional analyses were conducted in the mITT, CE, 
and ME populations across applicable time points, including Day 14, EOT, TOC (7 to 14 days after EOT), 
and  LFU  (28  to  35  days  after  EOT)  for  each  primary  efficacy  endpoint.  Subgroup  analyses  based  on 
various demographic and baseline disease characteristics were also conducted for the primary efficacy 
endpoints. 
Blinding (masking) 
This  is  a  double-blinded  study.  The  subject,  site  personnel  (with  the  exception  of  the  un-blinded 
pharmacist), Sponsor personnel (with the exception of the un-blinded drug supply and quality assurance 
teams, as appropriate) and Sponsor designees (with the exception of the un-blinded monitoring team) 
will  have  no  knowledge  of  treatment  assignment.  A  treatment  assignment  was  only  un-blinded  in  a 
situation of urgent medical necessity when the identity of the study medication needed to be known in 
order to select appropriate continuing therapy for the disease under study or to manage an AE.  
To maintain blinding of the study staff, an independent statistical reporting group will provide data to the 
DSMB. 
The recommended dose of meropenem in this indication is 1000 mg q8h administered over 30 minutes. 
To facilitate blinding of the study, meropenem was administered as a one-hour infusion in this study to 
match the duration of infusion of ceftolozane/tazobactam. The efficacy of meropenem was not affected by 
administration  in  this  way,  as  it  is  a  β-lactam  antibiotic  whose  efficacy  depends  on  time  the  drug

concentration  is  greater  than  minimum-inhibitory  concentration  (MIC),  see  also  Assessor’s  comment 
under “Treatments”. 
In  the  protocol,  it  is  stated  that  if  gram-negative  isolate(s)  with  varying  susceptibility  results  were 
present,  the  Investigator  was  strongly  encouraged  to  base  decisions  regarding  continuation  or 
discontinuation of study therapy on the clinical presentation of the patient and the totality of the available 
clinical and laboratory data, including the baseline LRT culture susceptibility testing results.  
The handling of patients with resistant pathogens was therefore guided by clinical outcome in order to 
decide whether to continue or discontinue study therapy.

Statistical methods 
Primary and key secondary objectives 
The primary and key secondary efficacy analyses were conducted in the ITT population, defined as all 
randomized  subjects,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  they  received  study  drug.  Subjects  in  the  ITT 
population were categorized based on the treatment arm to which they were randomized. 
The  primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  ceftolozane/tazobactam  versus 
meropenem  in  adult  subjects  with  VNP  based  on  the  difference  in  clinical  response  rates  in  the  ITT 
population at the TOC visit (7 to 14 days after the EOT visit), using a non-inferiority margin of 12.5%. 
The  secondary  key  objective  was  to  compare  the  Day  28  all-cause  mortality  rates  of  subjects  in  the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam versus meropenem arms in the ITT population using a non-inferiority margin of 
12.5%. 
For both primary and key secondary objectives, a 2-sided 97.5% CI was constructed instead of 95% CIs. 
A sequential testing approach was used in order to maintain a 1-sided 0.0125 overall type I error rate 
across the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints in the ITT population. 
For categorical data, descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) were provided for each category; 
95% CIs were constructed around the percentage, when appropriate. 
Changes to the planned analysis 
There were five versions of the statistical analysis plan (SAP). All revisions to the final SAP (version 2.0) 
occurred before database lock and un-blinding. 
The  following  additional  changes  to  the  planned  analyses  were  performed  post-hoc  after  study 
un-blinding: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the impact of miss-stratification within each stratum for primary efficacy endpoints, 
the following sensitivity analyses were performed: 
-  Clinical response at TOC visit by randomized stratum per EMA analysis (ITT Population) 
To  evaluate  the  magnitude  of  treatment  difference  in  TEAE  rates  in  the  safety  population, 
treatment  differences  and  associated  95%  CIs  for  the  key  TEAE  summary  categories  were 
provided. The magnitude of treatment differences in serious TEAE rates and associated 95% CIs 
for various serious TEAEs (≥1% of subjects in either treatment group) were also provided. 
To  evaluate  the  proportions  of  subjects  who  received  concomitant  non-study  antibiotic 
medications in the ITT population during the study treatment period, the non-study concomitant 
antibiotic medications between first and last dose of study drug by ATC class and preferred term 
were summarized. 
To evaluate the enrollment status of ICU patients on study, the number of subjects randomized 
while in the ICU was summarized. 
To  evaluate  the  magnitude  of  treatment  difference  in  clinical  response  on  a  pathogen  level, 
per-pathogen clinical cure rates with associated unstratified 95% CIs were summarized for the 
mITT and ME populations.

Handling of missing data 
For all-cause mortality at Day 14 and Day 28, subjects with missing or unknown mortality outcomes were 
categorized as deceased. For time to all-cause mortality from randomization through LFU visit, subjects 
with a missing or unknown all-cause mortality status were analyzed using the following two approaches: 
1) assumed missingness as death at the time of last study contact, and 2) assumed missingness as alive 
and censored at the time of last study contact.  
For clinical response, missing data were handled using a TFA for the ITT and mITT populations and with 
a  DAO  approach  for  the  CE  and  ME  populations.  In  the  TFA,  subjects  with  a  missing  (including 
indeterminate)  efficacy  endpoint  were  categorized  as  treatment  failures.  In  the  DAO  approach,  all 
subjects with missing outcomes including indeterminate were excluded from the analysis.

Recruitment 
A total of 263 sites were opened for enrollment, of which 119 randomized at least 1 subject (whereof 
around 40 sites appear to have included only 1 patient). The majority of subjects was recruited from sites 
in Europe (in total 36.3% whereof 21.8% from the eastern part and 14.5% from the western part), Russia 
(in total 24.2%), Ukraine (in total 9.6%) and Georgia (in total 8.0%). Contributions from other continents 
were distributed as follows: Latin America (5.8%), North America (4.3%), Asia/Pacific (7.9%) and Rest of 
the World (3.9%).

A total of 726 subjects were randomized: 362 subjects to ceftolozane/tazobactam and 364 subjects to 
meropenem. 
The first subject’s first visit was 16 January 2015. The last subject’s last visit was 06 June 2018. The date 
of the study report was 17 October 2018. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 10 protocol amendments to the original protocol dated 11 May 2012 (6 global amendments 
and 4 country-specific amendments, resulting in 7 versions of the protocol). The last global protocol was 
dated 27 Aug 2017.

Approximately 40% of important protocol deviations led to exclusion of subject data from the CE and ME 
analysis populations. These important deviations included: subjects who did not meet inclusion criterion 
#3, #4, or #5; subjects who met exclusion criterion #1 or #3; subjects who were un-blinded; receipt of 
>72 hours of gram-negative adjunctive therapy; receipt of non-study gram-negative antibiotics for the 
treatment of VNP; and subjects with a missing or out of window TOC visit.

Baseline blood pathogens 
Overall, the proportion of subjects with bacteremia at baseline (16.3% versus 10.5%, respectively) and 
the distribution of baseline blood pathogens were comparable between the ceftolozane/tazobactam and 
meropenem groups in the mITT population, and similar results were observed in the ME population. The 
most common blood pathogen in the mITT population was Staphylococcus epidermidis 17/511 (3.3%), 
and the most common gram-negative blood pathogen was K. pneumoniae 13/511 (2.5%). 
The  MIC50  and  MIC90  values  for  gram-negative  baseline  blood  pathogens  were  2  and  ≥256  μg/mL, 
respectively, for ceftolozane/tazobactam and 0.25 and 64 μg/mL, respectively, for meropenem in the 
mITT population with high MICs for both Staphylococcus epidermidis and K. pneumoniae. Similar results 
were observed in the ME population.

Superinfection and new infection rates in the mITT population 
Superinfections in the mITT population were generally comparable between treatment groups with the 
number of subjects having a superinfection being 54/264 (20.5%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group 
vs. 51/247 (20.6%) in the meropenem group. The most common superinfecting pathogen, isolated in 
>5% of the subjects, was A. baumannii found in 24/264, 9.1% and 28/247, 11.3% of subjects in the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam  and  meropenem  groups,  respectively.  Overall,  the  total  number  of  new 
pathogens classified as superinfections was higher for the ceftolozane/tazobactam group compared to the 
meropenem group (74 vs. 58, respectively). 
The most common new infecting pathogen was P. aeruginosa found in 8/264, 3.0% and 5/247, 2.0% of 
subjects  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  and  meropenem  groups,  respectively,  closely  followed  by  K.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
One  pivotal  phase  3  trial  (PN008)  and  three  phase  1  trials  (PN018,  PN028,  PN007)  have  been 
submitted in order to support the variation application for Zerbaxa (ceftolozane/tazobactam). The applied 
extension  of  indication  for  ceftolozane/tazobactam  is  as  follows:  “Nosocomial  pneumonia,  including 
ventilator-associated pneumonia.” 
Study  design.  The  pivotal  trial  PN008  is  a  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  active-controlled 
phase  3  study,  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  ceftolozane/tazobactam  to  meropenem  in  adult 
patients  with  nosocomial  pneumonia  (NP)  (including  ventilator-associated  pneumonia  [VAP]  and 
ventilated  hospital-acquired  pneumonia  [HAP]).  Patients  were  randomised  1:1  to  receive  either

ceftolozane/tazobactam or meropenem. The treatment duration was 8-14 days. Of note, according to 
IDSA  treatment  guideline  2016,  the  usual  treatment  duration  for  nosocomial  pneumonia  is  7  days. 
However,  there  exist  situations  in  which  a  shorter  or  longer  duration  of  antibiotics  may  be  indicated, 
depending upon the rate of improvement of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory parameters. Originally, in 
the first approved protocol, a fixed treatment duration of 8 days was set, with an exception for when 
Pseudomonas was isolated from baseline culture; in such cases, it was allowed to extend the treatment to 
14 days. However, when 433 subjects were enrolled, the protocol was amended to a treatment duration 
range of 8 to 14 days for all patients. The length of treatment for the patients was at each investigator’s 
discretion.  It  is  acknowledged  that  patients  with  these  very  serious  and  potentially  life-threatening 
infections  have  to  receive  treatment  as  long  as  it  is  considered  necessary,  however,  a  set  of  clinical 
criteria, common for all participating study centres, guiding the investigators for when the patients should 
be given treatment beyond 8 days would have led to a more standardized approach across the study 
centres instead of completely leaving this decision to the individual investigator. 
Study population. Patients diagnosed with either ventilated HAP or VAP were eligible to participate in 
the study provided that: for ventilated HAP: the patient had been either hospitalised for ≥ 48 hours or 
been  discharged  from  a  hospital  within  the  prior  7  days,  for  VAP:  mechanical  ventilation  had  to  be 
received ≥ 48 hours. For both conditions specified clinical signs or/and symptoms had to be fulfilled, in 
addition to chest radiograph/CT scan and a lower respiratory tract specimen at baseline. Several scoring 
systems were employed at baseline in order to assist the selection of a severely ill patient population 
(CPIS, SOFA and APACHE II score). Originally, the APACHE II score were part of the inclusion criteria 
(required  a  score  of  between  12-35  [inclusive]),  but,  this  criterion  was  later  removed  after  over  400 
patients had been included into the study. Nevertheless, the score was still registered from all patients at 
baseline,  but  seemingly  the  change  in  score  was  not  recorded  post-baseline.  Changes  in  the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria after a significant number of patients have been enrolled can introduce bias. 
Although the subgroup analysis of patients with APACHE score > 20 or < 20 was inconclusive, a sensitivity 
analysis conducted on the subset of the 433 patients recruited prior to the change has been provided. This 
analysis reported the following: the observed treatment differences (TOL/TAZ – meropenem) and their 
95% CIs were 4.4 (-9.55, 18.31) for Day 28 All-cause Mortality Rate by stratum and 1.9 (-13.46, 17.08) 
in the clinical response at Test of Cure (TOC) visit by stratum – EMA analysis. Hence, subjects enrolled 
under different protocol versions (ITT population) were both similar to overall results, although with more 
variability and wider confidence intervals, likely due to smaller sample sizes. 
Overall, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, including diagnoses, were in line with the CHMP guidance and 
considered to ensure an enrolment of patients who are representative for the sought indication. It is, 
however, noted that patients with various comorbidities, such as e.g., NYHA Stage IV congestive heart 
failure, were excluded from the study, thereby excluding the most severely ill patients.  
Concomitant/adjunctive  treatments.  As  ceftolozane/tazobactam  only  covers  infections  caused  by 
gram-negative  pathogens,  the  patients  were  required  to  receive  empiric  gram-positive  adjunctive 
treatment (i.e., linezolid or an alternative if viewed necessary) at baseline. Only patients whose culture 
grew  S.  aureus  (MRSA  or  MSSA)  were  to  continue  with  linezolid  (or  alternative).  This  is  acceptable. 
Subjects were also allowed to receive empiric adjunctive gram-negative (i.e., aminoglycoside-amikacin) 
therapy  for  ≤  72  hours  started  at  baseline  at  sites  with  >  15%  carbapenem  resistant  P.  aeruginosa 
pending baseline results. This cut-off of 15% was questioned by the SAWP/CHMP. It would require that all 
study  sites  had  very  high  quality  centre-specific  data  on  recent  rates  of  carbapenem  resistance.  The 
applicant  refers  to  the  2016  IDSA/ATS  and  2017  International  ERS/ESICM/ESCMID/ALAT  guidelines 
which  consider  a  range  varying  between  >10-25%  local  prevalence  of  resistant  pathogens  as 
representing high-risk. This is acknowledged. Even if it is still unclear why the applicant chose a specific 
cut-off  instead  of  a  range,  the  study  has  been  finalised  and  it  is  not  considered  that  this  choice  has 
affected the study results. This issue will therefore not be further pursued.

The  handling  of  patients  with  resistant  pathogens  was  guided  by  clinical  outcome  in  order  to  decide 
whether to continue or discontinue study therapy.  However, there was a potential concern that this may 
compromise the blinding of the study as ceftolozane/tazobactam has shown good in vitro activity against 
P.  aeruginosa  strains,  including  meropenem-resistant  strains.  If  laboratory  culture  data  indicated 
resistance to one of the study drugs, while clinical improvement was observed in a patient, this may have 
led  the  investigator  to  conclude  which  study  drug  the  patient  was  receiving.  SAWP/CHMP  therefore 
requested that the applicant should provide a justifiable strategy to manage this risk. It was originally 
proposed  that  if  the  patient  was  responding  to  therapy  (i.e.,  improving  clinical  signs  compared  to 
baseline) the investigator may either continue study therapy alone (with close monitoring), or continue 
study drug and add a new non-study antibiotic (e.g. amikacin for P. aeruginosa). However, in the protocol 
version  7,  it  seems  that  the  latter  option  no  longer  was  allowed.  Based  on  the  patient’s  response on 
therapy, the study drug was to be either continued alone or discontinued. However, as the resistance 
pattern is partly different between ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem it could still be possible to 
reveal which treatment group the patient belonged to. However, as it seems that there were rather few 
isolates of e.g. resistant P. aeruginosa strains in the study, this probably have concerned only a very small 
number of patients and therefore neither influenced the clinical outcome nor compromised the blinding. 
Dose. The chosen dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam was 3000 mg (i.e., 2000 mg ceftolozane and 1000 mg 
tazobactam)  administered  every  8  hours  as  an  IV  infusion  over  1  hour.  This  dose  is  higher  than  the 
currently  approved  dose  of  1500  mg  (i.e.,  1000  mg  ceftolozane  and  500  mg  tazobactam)  for  the 
indications cIAI and cUTI. The adequacy of TAZ exposure in patients with ARC (hyper clearance) is of 
concern  considering  critical  importance  of  the  adequate  initial  antibiotic  treatment  in  patients  with 
NP/VAP and as most patients may likely experience ARC/be ventilated during the treatment period. The 
applicant is asked to justify acceptability of a PTA <90% for TAZ in patients with ARC considering the 
severity  of  infection,  difficult-to-treat/less  susceptible  pathogens  and  potentially  heavy  bacterial  load, 
and  discuss  whether  there  is  a  need  for  dose  adjustment  to  optimize  TAZ  exposures  in  patients  with 
different ARC-categories. The applicant is asked to provide additional simulations of alternative dosing 
regimens for TOL/TAZ with dose increment and/or prolonged infusion that may increase the chance of 
achieving pre-defined PD targets. For patients with severe renal impairment, the applicant has already 
proposed  a  dose  adjustment  for  TOL/TAZ,  which  however  resulted  in  slightly  insufficient/borderline 
exposures of TAZ (i.e. with a PTA 84%). During the procedure the applicant has justified the acceptability 
of a PTA <90% for TAZ in patients with severe renal impairment. It is reassuring that very high PTA for 
TAZ was achieved in plasma (i.e.>98%) in addition to very high TOL PTAs both in ELF and plasma.  
Comparator. Meropenem is considered to be a relevant comparator for patients with NP and is approved 
for use in patients with HAP and/or VAP. The choice of comparator was also discussed with the SAWP and 
found to be, overall, acceptable.  
Meropenem was given in a dose of 1000 mg every 8 hours. In order to facilitate the blinding in the study, 
an IV infusion over 1 hour was chosen. The dose of meropenem is acceptable and already approved for 
these  severe  pneumonias,  however,  the  infusion  time  is  usually  recommended  to  be  15-30  minutes. 
Taking into consideration that the activity of meropenem is dependent on the proportion of the dosing 
interval that the drug concentration is greater than the MIC, and that meropenem prepared for infusion is 
stable for up to 4 hours at room temperature, the 1-hour infusion time is not considered to adversely 
affect its efficacy. In line with the approved SmPC for meropenem, the dose was adjusted for renally 
impaired patients.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The protocol has been amended 10 times (6 global amendments and 4 country-specific amendments, 
resulting  in  7  versions  of  the  protocol),  also  after  the  study  was  initiated  and  patients  enrolled.  The 
protocol changed gradually during the study period including, among other things, removal of inclusion 
criterion  (APACHE  II  score),  change  of  the  analysis  population  for  the  primary  EMA  endpoint, 
non-inferiority margin (changed in SAP version 5.0) and key secondary endpoint. The MAH has confirmed 
that all protocol amendments were performed before database lock. Furthermore, the MAH stated that 
the integrity of the study was not compromised by any changes made to the primary and key secondary 
endpoints, as these were only changes in the structure of the final statistical analysis and not changes in 
study conduct or design.  
Protocol deviations 
In  total,  there  were  over  30%  of  the  subjects  in  the  ITT  population  who  had  at  least  one  important 
protocol deviation documented during the study. These deviations included mainly issues such as  not 
meeting  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  (in  total  8.8%),  lack  in  safety  reporting  (in  total  2.5%)  and  not 
following  trial  procedures/study  interventions  (in  total  26.2%).  The  number  of  patients  with  protocol 
deviations was, in general, similar between the two arms. The single protocol deviation that concerned 
most  patients  in  both  study  arms  was  “Patients  who  were  mis-stratified  in  Bracket  (IXRS  system)” 
(26/362,  7.2%  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  arm  vs.  32/364,  8.8%  in  the  meropenem  arm).  The 
applicant conducted a sensitivity analysis (seemingly post-hoc) in order to evaluate the impact of this 
miss-stratification. This analysis concluded that the miss-stratification only had a minor impact on the 
result within each stratum of primary diagnosis factor. The high percentage of protocol deviations in the 
ITT population, led to a rather high percentage of subject data being excluded from the CE population (in 
total approximately 40%) which might have compromised the robustness of the estimates. In this study, 
clinical response in the CE population was a secondary endpoint. The results showed that the clinical cure 
rates were similar between the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm and the meropenem arm for this endpoint 
and as such supported the results achieved for the primary and key secondary endpoint. 
Endpoints. The primary objective for the analysis to be presented to the EMA was to demonstrate the 
non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam versus meropenem in adult subjects with ventilator-associated 
nosocomial  pneumonia  based  on  the  difference  in  clinical  response  rates  in  the  Intent-to-treat  (ITT) 
population at the TOC visit (7 to 14 days after the EOT visit), using a non-inferiority margin of - 12.5%. 
Aiming  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  towards  an  appropriate  reference  regimen  is  an  acceptable 
strategy  for  the  sought  indication  and  in  line  with  the  recommendation  of  the  CHMP  guideline.  Key 
secondary  objective  was  comparison  of  the  Day  28  all-cause  mortality  rates  of  subjects  in  the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam vs. meropenem arms in the ITT population. 
There were a lot of secondary endpoints in this study, and all of these were in line with what is commonly 
evaluated  in  studies  for  antimicrobial  medicinal  products  (i.e.,  per-subject  and  per  pathogen 
microbiological responses in the microbiological populations ME in addition to clinical responses in the 
same populations as well as in the CE population at the EOT, TOC and LFU visits). The per-subject and per 
pathogen  microbiological  responses  in  the  mITT  population  was  chosen  as  exploratory  endpoints, 
however, the results were still provided together with the corresponding results in the ME population. 
However, the CHMP guideline and the SAWP/CHMP scientific advice, recommended to view the ITT and 
the  CE  population  as  co-primary.  The  advice  was  not  followed  by  the  applicant.  This  is  considered 
unfortunate,  as  it  would  have  been  preferable  that  the  evaluation  of  the  clinical  cure  rates  had  been 
performed  in  both  the  ITT  and  CE  populations  using  the  same  level  of  statistical  power.  It  is 
acknowledged,  though,  that  in  the  new  draft  CHMP  guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019 
Page 99/99 
 
  
indicated for treatment of bacterial infections from 14 January 2019, it is suggested that the primary 
analysis should be clinical outcome in only the ITT population at the TOC visit. However, this draft is out 
for consultation until 31 July 2019 and is therefore not yet put into force. 
Sample size. The population comprised totally 726 patients; 362 patients in the ceftolozane/tazobactam 
group vs. 364 patients in the meropenem group. The study was designed to have at least 85.3% power 
to meet the non-inferiority for the primary endpoint, assuming a cure rate of 58.4% in both arms. It was 
initially  powered  at  88%,  but  power  decreased  due  to  the  planned  futility  look  by  DSMB  when 
approximately 30% of patients had been enrolled. Overall, the sample size used is considered adequate 
and the power of the study is deemed acceptable. 
Statistical  methods.  The proposed primary analyses as well as the planned supportive analyses are 
endorsed. A Treatment Failure Approach was applied to handle missing data for mITT and ITT population. 
This  seems  conservative  and  hence  is  acceptable.  Data-as-observed  approach  was  applied  to  handle 
missing  data  for  clinical  responses  in  ME  and  CE  populations.  This  approach  is  generally  not 
recommended in confirmatory studies due to risk of population selection bias and reduction of power and 
underestimation of variability (EMA/CPMP/EWP/1776/99 Rev. 1). A sensitivity analysis whereby another 
imputation  approach  is  applied  was  provided  by  the  applicant  during  the  procedure.  This  analysis 
demonstrated that the observed treatment differences (TOL/TAZ – meropenem) and their 95% CIs were 
3.4 (-3.60, 10.32) in the CE at TOC population and 4.0 (-2.61, 10.58) in the ME at TOC population, both 
meeting the non-inferiority criterion of TOL/TAZ compared to meropenem. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline  characteristics.  Since patients with NP, in particular those receiving mechanically assisted 
ventilation, are usually very ill and have multiple co-morbidity factors, it is crucial for a clinical study on 
this condition to ensure that the included population is as representative as possible. In the current study, 
an adequate number of patients with different risk factors were included; APACHE II scores over 15 in > 
70% (and mean value of 17), the majority of patients had CPIS score > 8, relatively high percentage of 
high age (44% ≥ 65 years old whereof > 20% ≥ 75 years of age) and > 70% were diagnosed with VAP. 
This is reassuring and contributes to the external validity of the study. Subjects were hospitalized for a 
mean  duration  of  10.4  days  prior  to  randomization,  and  49.3%  were  ventilated  for  ≥5  days  prior  to 
randomization.  The  fact  that  patients  had  been  hospitalised  as  long  as  10  days  (on  average)  before 
randomisation would ensure that most patients have acquired infection from pathogens located in the 
hospital  environment.  Only  14.5%  of  patients  had  bacteraemia  at  baseline  (in  the  pooled 
ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem group). There was a relatively low total number of subjects with 
moderate (8.4%) or severe renal failure (5.2%) and co-morbidities like COPD (12%), diabetes (22%) and 
congestive heart failure (16%), however, this is a consequence of the exclusion criteria which prevent the 
most severely ill patients from being included into the study. 
Baseline  microbiology.  Endotracheal  aspirate  (ETA)  was  the  dominant  method  for  the  specimen 
collection (ca. 50% in both arms). This is considered acceptable as ETA is now suggested as superior to 
invasive  or  non-invasive  sampling  with  quantitative  cultures  (BMJ  2016).  The  pathogens  isolated  at 
baseline  reflect  the  pattern  of  pathogens  most  commonly  detected  for  NP.  The  most  common 
gram-negative pathogens isolated at baseline in both treatment groups were K. pneumoniae (approx. 
35%), P. aeruginosa (25%) and E. coli (18%). In total, approximately 63% of the randomised patients in 
the two study groups had a mono-microbial infection and at least one valid pathogen at baseline. Nearly 
all of the patients (98%) in the mITT population had a gram-negative LRT pathogen isolated at baseline.  
Both ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem showed significant activity against most LRT pathogens. 
Overall,  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  and  meropenem  MIC  distributions  for  the  most  common  LRT 
pathogens  at  baseline  were  similar  across  the  mITT  and  ME  populations.  The  favourable 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019 
Page 100/100 
 
  
ceftolozane/tazobactam susceptibility data for P. aeruginosa is encouraging, and may pose an advantage 
for the study drug compared to alternative regimens. However, the number of isolates with MIC ≥8 µg/mL 
encountered in the study PN008 were in general limited, especially with P. aeruginosa isolates (n=5). 
The  susceptibility  interpretation  at  baseline  was  performed  using  provisional  breakpoints  for 
ceftolozane/tazobactam. 
In  general, 
the 
susceptibility  data  were 
comparable  between 
ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem. It is noted, though, that 54/175 (30.9%) K. pneumoniae LRT 
isolates  were  resistant  to  ceftolozane/tazobactam  compared  to  1/176  (0.6%)  isolates  resistant  to 
meropenem. 
Primary  and  key  secondary  endpoint.  Non-inferiority  of  ceftolozane/tazobactam  compared  to 
meropenem  was  demonstrated  for  both  the  primary  endpoint  “clinical  response  at  TOC  in  the  ITT 
population” (197/362, 54.4% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. 194/364, 53.3% in the meropenem 
arm) and for the key secondary endpoint, “Day 28 all-cause mortality in the ITT population” (87/362, 
24.0% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. 92/364, 25.3% in the meropenem arm). The lower limits 
of the stratified 97.5% CIs were within -12.5% for the primary endpoint (1.1 [-7.20, 9.31]) and for the 
key secondary endpoint (1.1 [-6.03, 8.28]). 
The results from the sensitivity analysis were consistent with the results achieved in the primary analysis 
and key secondary analysis for the ITT population, indicating that the stratification factors diagnosis (HAP 
or VAP) and age (≥ 65 or < 65 years) did not impact on the primary results, thereby demonstrating the 
robustness of the primary analyses. 
Concerning  the  diagnosis  VAP,  the  clinical  response  rate  was  similar  for  patients  in  the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam group and patients in the meropenem group (i.e., 147/263, 55.9% vs. 146/256, 
57.0%,  respectively).  A  tendency  towards  a  numerically  higher  Day  28  all-cause  mortality  rate  was 
observed  for  the  diagnosis  VAP  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  (63/263,  24.0%)  vs.  the 
meropenem group (52/256, 20.3%). For the diagnosis ventilated HAP, a tendency towards numerically 
higher  cure  rate  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  vs.  the  meropenem  group  (50/99,  50.5%  vs. 
48/108, 44.4%) and lower mortality rate (24/99, 24.2% vs. 40/108, 37.0%) was seen.   
Other secondary endpoints.  
Clinical  response  rates.  The  clinical  cure  rates  in  the  CE  population  were  similar  between  the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem arms (139/218, 63.8% vs. 143/221, 64.7%, respectively). For 
both groups, the rate was higher compared to the cure rate reported for the ITT population (primary 
analysis). However, as already previously mentioned, due to the high percentage of exclusion of patients 
from this population (ca. 40%), the robustness of the estimates might have been compromised. 
In  the  mITT  and  ME  populations  the  clinical  cure  rates  were  similar  to  the  results  seen  in  the  CE 
population. They were also comparable between the two treatment arms. It is noted that the clinical cure 
rate at TOC showed a numerical trend in favour of ceftolozane/tazobactam in the ME population (87/115, 
75.7% vs. 78/118, 66.1% in the meropenem arm).  
Microbiological response rates.  
Per-subject  microbiological  response:  The  majority  of  subjects  in  the  mITT  population  in  both  the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  (193/264  [73.1%]  subjects)  and  the  meropenem  group  (168/247 
[68.0%] subjects) had a favourable microbiological response. The results were consistent between the 
mITT and ME populations in both study groups for the TOC visit.  
Per-pathogen  microbiological  response:  In  general,  the  microbiological  response  rates  by  pathogen 
showed similar response rates for ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem. It is unclear how 
many  of  the  isolates  that  were  eradicated  and  how  many  were  only  presumed  eradicated.  In  the 
Assessment report

Page 101/101 
 
  
applicant’s response, it was clarified that for nearly half of the baseline pathogens, the highest percentage 
was  presumed  eradicated  and  this  was  the  case  for  both  arms.  Overall,  the  differences  between  the 
eradicated rate and the presumed eradicated rate for the two arms were rather small and consistent with 
the observations made for the eradication and presumed eradication rate taken together as previously 
presented by the applicant. 
The microbiological eradication rates were higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group compared with the 
meropenem group for P. aeruginosa (47/63, 74.6% vs. 41/65, 63.1%), Enterobacteriaceae (145/195, 
74.4% vs. 129/185, 69.7%) and H. influenzae (20/22, 90.9% vs. 11/16, 68.8%). The response rates 
were  lower  for  ceftolozane/tazobactam  vs.  meropenem  for  ESBL+  K.  pneumoniae  (33/53,  62.3%  vs. 
38/52, 73.1%).  Although there was approximately 11% difference in the microbiological response rates 
in the mITT population, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions regarding the efficacy toward these 
isolates considering the overall outcomes. As already noted, 49.5% (52/105) of ESBL + K. pneumoniae 
isolates  treated  in  the  study  were  resistant  to  ceftolozane/tazobactam  while  none  were  resistant  to 
meropenem (0/105). The distribution of these isolates between the study arms is, however, unknown. 
The applicant was asked to specify the distribution of resistant isolates to the study arms, and discuss 
whether this might explain the lower microbiological response rates for ESBL + K. pneumoniae in the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam arm compared to the meropenem arm (i.e. 62.3% [33/53] vs. 73.1% [38/52], 
respectively). The applicant presented the microbiological outcome in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm 
for subjects with ESBL positive K. pneumoniae that were resistant to ceftolozane/tazobactam. stating 
that  28  ESBL  +  K.  pneumoniae  resistant  isolates  were  present  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  arm. 
Comparisons were made between the patients with ESBL + K. pneumoniae resistant isolates as baseline 
LRT pathogen and the overall patient population receiving ceftolozane/tazobactam with regards to clinical 
response rate and the Day 28 all-cause mortality rate. Furthermore, the results for the per-pathogen 
microbiological  response  rate  for  the  total  ESBL  +  K.  pneumoniae  (susceptible  +  intermediate  + 
resistant)  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  arm  were  compared  to  the  per-pathogen  microbiological 
response rate for the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm with only ESBL + K. pneumoniae resistant isolates. 
The results showed that all the rates were comparable between the two groups, and therefore it seems 
like the observed difference noted between the treatment arms for the species was not entirely driven by 
resistance against ceftolozane/tazobactam. However, as the number of ESBL + K. pneumoniae resistant 
isolates was very limited, the results could also be random. It is therefore not possible to draw any firm 
conclusions and the issue will not be further pursued. 
The applicant was asked to discuss the risks associated with using ceftolozane/tazobactam empirically in 
clinical  settings  in  case  of  infections  caused  by  ESBL+  K.  pneumoniae  and  propose  risk  mitigation 
measures to avoid that risk. In their response, the MAH referred to that in the setting of empiric use, local 
epidemiology and susceptibility patterns will inform whether ceftolozane/tazobactam is likely to provide 
benefit to the patient. The answer from the MAH is noted. In addition, the information in Section 5.1 in the 
SmPC  now  adequately  reflects  the  pathogens  that  are  susceptible  and  resistant  respectively  towards 
ceftolozane/tazobactam  in  order  to  guide  prescribers  in  choosing  the  most  potentially  effective 
antibacterial agent in an empirical setting. The MAH states in the RMP that they will continue to monitor 
the emergence of bacterial resistance to ceftolozane/tazobactam through routine PV. 
Concerning P. aeruginosa overexpressing AmpC (9 isolates in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group vs. 6 in 
the  meropenem  group),  the  number  of  samples  was  unfortunately  too  low  to  make  any  valid 
assumptions. 
Overall, the results in the ME analysis population were consistent with those in the mITT population for 
both study groups. It is noted that in this population the response rates for ESBL+ K. pneumoniae were 
similar for the ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem group, respectively (20/30, 66.7% vs. 18/27, 
66.7%).

No trend for outcome by MIC could be discerned. 
Non-study  concomitant  antibiotic  medication.  Twenty-one  percent  (77/362)  of  patients  in  the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam arm received carbapenems as non-study concomitant antibiotic medication. Of 
these patients, 17.4% (63/362) received meropenem. The concomitant antibiotics could be administered 
at any time during the treatment period. It is therefore uncertain at which time point patients might have 
received  carbapenems  and  for  which  duration.  This  concomitant  administration  of  carbapenems 
(including  meropenem)  as  “any  non-study  concomitant  antibiotic  medication”  to  the  patients  in  the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam arm might have impacted the clinical and microbiological response rates. This 
hampers  the  interpretation  of  the  efficacy  outcomes  due  to  the  assumed  bias,  and  raises  a  question 
whether the efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam might have been overestimated. During the procedure 
the MAH clarified that 58/362 (16%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 39/364 (10.7%) in the 
meropenem group received carbapenems as non-study concomitant medication before TOC. According to 
the MAH, given that, only 2 subjects received ≥1 dose of a non-study carbapenem concomitantly with 
study drug treatment (i.e., until EOT), there is no expected impact on the results of the primary endpoints 
or microbiological response rates. While this is agreed, considering that clinical cure at TOC is the primary 
endpoint, it is the number of patients receiving a non-study carbapenem from study start to TOC visit that 
is  of  interest  and  could  have  an  impact  on  the  primary  endpoint  results.  As  requested,  the  MAH  has 
performed a sensitivity analysis where the 10/58 patients in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm receiving 
non-study carbapenems up until TOC vs. the corresponding 7/39 patients in the meropenem arm, were 
calculated as clinical failures. This analysis demonstrated that this re-calculation did not impact the final 
study  results  (clinical  response  at  TOC:  187/362,  51.7%  [failures:  175/362,  48.3%]  for  the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. 187/364, 51.4% [failures: 177/364, 48.6%] for the meropenem group). 
Most of the patients receiving concomitant carbapenems were clinical failures at EOT and needed further 
treatment for the pneumonia. Since the results from the sensitivity analysis in which patients receiving 
concomitant carbapenems were regarded as clinical failures were comparable to the results in the overall 
study population, it is agreed that the use of concomitant carbapenems before TOC probably have not 
affected the clinical outcome of the study. 
Subgroups. In general, for the majority of the subgroups the cure rates or mortality rates showed no or 
only  minor  difference  between  the  two  study  groups  or  were  numerically  in  favour  of  the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam group. However, imbalances were observed between the following subgroups: 
The  Day  28  All-cause  mortality  rate  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  P.  aeruginosa  as  baseline  LRT 
pathogen, tended to be higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group vs. the meropenem group (16/63, 
25.4%  vs.  12/65,  18.5%,  respectively).  The  same  tendencies  were  also  seen  for  the  subgroups 
bacteremic at baseline (all respiratory pathogens, 14/29, 48.3% vs. 7/21, 33.3%) and bacteremic at 
baseline (all gram-negative respiratory pathogens, 13/25, 52.0% vs. 7/19, 36.8%). The MAH clarified 
that there are differences in the demographics of TOL/TAZ versus meropenem: a higher percentage of 
subjects ≥75 years old in the TOL/TAZ group (23.8%) compared to the meropenem group (16.9%), a 
higher rate of subjects that had failed prior antibiotic therapy (17.5% vs. 6.2%) and of subjects that were 
bacteremic at baseline (27.0% vs. 10.8%). In addition, there was a higher proportion of subjects with 
different  co-morbidities  (i.e.  diabetes,  congestive  heart  failure)  in  the  TOL/TAZ  group  than  in  the 
meropenem  group.  It  is  agreed  that these  differences  in  demographic  factors  between  the  treatment 
groups might have affected the study results.  
Clinical cure rates for ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem tended to be lower in those ≥75 
years of age (35/83, 42.2% vs. 42/76, 55.3%), having had no prior antibiotic therapy (19/44, 43.2% vs. 
23/41, 56.1%) and having had baseline gram-negative adjunctive therapy (47/103, 45.6% vs. 64/112, 
57.1%). During the procedure the MAH clarified that increased failure rate in patients >75 years of age as 
well as patients who did not receive any antibiotic therapy prior to study entry may be attributed to the 
differences  in  demographics  of  ceftolozane/tazobactam  versus  meropenem-treated  subjects  in  this 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019 
Page 103/103 
 
  
subgroup as ceftolozane/tazobactam subjects displayed more high-risk characteristics at baseline. This is 
considered reasonable. It is also agreed that rates of susceptibility to study therapy which were lower in 
the subjects with Enterobacteriaceae in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group compared to the meropenem 
group (84.4% vs. 100%) could contribute to a lower clinical response rate in the ceftolozane/tazobactam 
group. 
Furthermore, the applicant was asked to state how many of the patients with impaired renal function did 
receive the per-protocol (CE) defined reduced dose regimen and specify the outcome. The MAH clarified 
that all subjects with moderate/severe renal impairment at baseline received the per-protocol reduced 
dose  within  the  treatment  period.  Fifty-two  (14.4%)  patients  with  moderate/severe  renal  impairment 
were  treated  with  TOL/TAZ,  while  47  (12.9%)  were  treated  with  meropenem.  In  32  (61.5%)  and 
26 (55.3%) patients treated with TOL/TAZ and meropenem, respectively, the treatment failed.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In general, the included patient population is considered to be representative for the applied indication. 
Non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam to meropenem has been clearly demonstrated in these patients 
for  the  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoint.  The  issues  related  to  efficacy  has  been  adequately 
addressed. No outstanding concerns remains. Conclusion on the efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam in the 
indication of NP including VAP is considered demonstrated. Hence, Zerbaxa may be granted an extension 
of the current indication from the efficacy point of view. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction

The majority (63%) of subjects received between 8 and 14 days of study therapy as specified in the 
protocol,  with  comparable  mean  duration  of  exposure  in  both  treatment  groups;  20.7%  of  subjects 
received less than the specified minimum treatment course of 8 days. 
Adverse events 
A  high  proportion  of  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  experienced  TEAEs  (84.6%),  including  a 
substantial proportion of subjects who experienced serious TEAEs (39%) and fatal TEAEs (28.6%). In 
general,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  and  deaths  were  reported  in  a  similar  proportion  of  subjects  in  each

Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events 
In  general,  the  incidence  of  subjects  with  TEAEs  and  the  types  of  TEAEs  seen  were  generally  similar 
between  the  2  treatment  groups,  distributed  across  multiple  body  systems,  and  typical  of  ventilated 
subjects with NP receiving antibiotic therapy, many of whom had significant underlying comorbidities and 
multiple concomitant therapies which contributed to the reported events. 
Anemia, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, and decubitus ulcer were the most frequently reported TEAEs 
(>5%  of  subjects  overall)  during  the  study  and  occurred  in  a  similar  proportion  of  subjects  in  each 
treatment group. TEAEs that occurred in ≥5% of subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group included 
anemia, decubitus ulcer, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, and increased ALT and AST. The majority of the 
TEAEs of increased ALT and AST in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group were mild or moderate in severity 
and not related to study drug therapy. In the meropenem group, anemia, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, 
hydrothorax, and hypotension occurred in ≥5% of subjects. Note that for each preferred term, subjects 
were counted only once even if they experienced multiple events of the preferred term. No TEAE was 
reported  in  more  than  10%  of  subjects  overall;  the  only  TEAE  preferred  term  reported  in  >10%  of 
subjects in either treatment group was anemia reported in the meropenem group. 
The SOCs with the highest percentage of subjects with TEAEs were infections and infestation (35.3% of 
subjects  overall)  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  (24.6%  of  subjects  overall)  and  occurred  in  a  similar 
proportion of subjects in each treatment group. 
Severity 
Overall, 45.8% of subjects had TEAEs that were mild to moderate in severity, whereas 38.8% had severe 
TEAEs.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  mild,  moderate,  or  severe  TEAEs  was  similar  between  the 
treatment groups. The high percentage of severe TEAEs was not unexpected in this critically ill population 
with underlying comorbid conditions. 
Related to Study Treatment 
The incidence of investigator-assessed, drug-related TEAEs was low and comparable in the 2 treatment 
groups  (38  [10.5%]  subjects  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  and  27  [7.5%]  subjects  in  the 
meropenem  group.  Diarrhea,  increased  ALT  and  AST,  and  increased  hepatic  enzyme  were  the  most 
common drug-related TEAEs (≥0.8% of subjects overall) and occurred in a similar proportion of subjects 
in each treatment group. 
A  total  of  8  (1.1%)  subjects  (5  [1.4%]  subjects  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  and  3  [0.8%] 
subjects  in  the  meropenem  group)  had  drug-related  TEAEs  that  were  considered  severe.  In  the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam group, the events were bradycardia, diarrhea, hepatic failure, systemic candida, 
increased ALT, increased AST, and increased gamma glutamyl transferase. The events of increased ALT, 
AST,  and  gamma  glutamyl  transferase,  which  were  considered  serious  TEAEs  and  resulted  in 
discontinuation of study therapy, all occurred in a single subject. These increases did not meet laboratory 
criteria  for  potential  drug-induced  liver  injury.  The  TEAE  of  hepatic  failure,  which  resulted  in 
discontinuation of study therapy, represented a worsening of a baseline medical history of hepatic failure 
in this subject admitted following cardiac arrest. The event was not considered serious and did not meet 
laboratory  criteria  for  potential  drug-induced  liver  injury.  In  the  meropenem  group,  the  drug-related 
TEAEs that were considered severe were diarrhea, cholestatic hepatitis, and C. difficile infection.

A substantial proportion of subjects experienced serious TEAEs (281 [39%]) in both treatment groups, 
consistent with the critically ill population under study. The proportion of subjects with serious TEAEs was 
higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group (42.1%) compared to the meropenem group (35.9%). No 
single SOC or preferred term was responsible for this imbalance. 
A post-hoc safety analysis was conducted to evaluate the magnitude of treatment differences in serious 
TEAE rates and associated 95% CIs for various serious TEAEs. Results of these analyses confirm that the 
95% CI for the overall treatment difference in the serious TEAE rate included 0. The serious TEAEs that 
occurred more frequently in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group were widely distributed among a variety 
of SOCs and preferred terms.

Figure 18.  Analysis of Subjects with Serious Adverse Events (Incidence >=1% Subjects in One or More 
Treatment Groups) (Safety Population) Ceftolozane/Tazobactam (N=361) vs. Meropenem (N=359) 
The 12 serious TEAE preferred terms that occurred in >1% of subjects and were more frequent in the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  were  distributed  across  7  different  SOCs.  Among  these,  cerebral 
hemorrhage, which occurred in 5 subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and no subjects in the 
meropenem group, was the only serious TEAE preferred term with a 95% CI for risk difference that did 
not include 0. In 4 of these 5 subjects, the cerebral hemorrhage represented a worsening of underlying 
intracranial hemorrhage that was present as an admission diagnosis on medical history. The remaining 
subject  was  admitted  with  an  ischemic  stroke  and  the  cerebral  hemorrhage  occurred  1  day  after  the 
subject received thrombolytic therapy for a pulmonary embolism. In 3 of the 5 subjects, the cerebral 
hemorrhage occurred after completion of study drug therapy. None of the 5 events were considered by 
the investigator to be related to study drug therapy. There was no change in mean prothrombin time or 
decrease in mean platelet count from baseline through the EOT visit in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group 
to  suggest  an  induced  hypocoagulable  state.  There  was  no  imbalance  in  serious  TEAEs  related  to 
hemorrhage at other anatomical sites.  
No serious TEAE was reported in >4% of subjects in either treatment group. The SOCs with the highest 
percentage  of  subjects  with  serious  TEAEs  were  cardiac  disorders  (10.0%  of  subjects  overall)  and 
infections and infestations (9.0% of subjects overall), each occurring in a similar proportion of subjects in 
the 2 treatment groups. Septic shock and multi-organ failure were the most commonly reported serious 
TEAE preferred terms (>3% of subjects overall) and occurred in a similar proportion of subjects in each 
treatment group.

Serious TEAEs related to the study drug 
Among subjects that had serious TEAEs, only 10 subjects (8 in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group versus 
2 in the meropenem group) experienced serious TEAEs that were considered related to study drug by the 
investigator. Only C. difficile colitis was reported by more than 1 subject as a treatment-related serious 
TEAE  (C.  difficile  colitis  was  reported  by  2  subjects  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group).  All 
treatment-related serious TEAEs had resolved or were resolving at the end of the study.

Adverse events are coded using MedDRA version 17.0. For each system organ class and preferred term, subjects are counted 
only once, even if they experienced multiple events in the system organ class or preferred term. 
Deaths 
A total of 206 (28.6%) deaths were reported during the study and occurred in a similar proportion of 
subjects in the 2 treatment groups. Fatal serious TEAEs were distributed across multiple SOCs. The SOCs 
with the highest percentage of subjects with fatal TEAEs were cardiac disorders (6.7% of subjects overall) 
and  nervous  system  disorders  (6.0%  of  subjects  overall),  each  occurring  in  a  similar  proportion  of 
subjects in the 2 treatment groups. Multi-organ failure, septic shock, brain edema, and cardiac failure 
acute were the most commonly reported TEAE preferred terms leading to death (>2% of subjects overall) 
and occurred in a similar proportion of subjects in each treatment group. 
All TEAEs leading to death were considered unrelated to study drug therapy by the investigator and in 
general were related to underlying comorbidities or complications that developed while the subject was 
enrolled in the study. 
Laboratory findings 
A comparable number of subjects in each treatment group experienced a shift from baseline in laboratory 
values. The incidence and magnitude of the shifts were consistent between the 2 treatment groups.

Hematology 
The baseline hematology parameters were similar between the 2 treatment groups. For all scheduled 
visits (Day 3, Day 8, EOT, TOC, and LFU), no apparent differences were seen in mean values and mean 
changes from baseline between the 2 treatment groups in any particular parameter. 
The  overall  incidence  of  Grade  3  and  Grade  4  toxicity  was  low  and  similar  between  the  2  treatment 
groups. For hemoglobin, the majority of subjects that had Grade 3 or 4 toxicity at EOT had abnormal 
values  of  Grade  2  to  4  at  baseline.  Considering  the  severity  of  illness  in  this  study  population,  the 
incidence of worsening grade shifts during treatment was low and comparable for both treatment groups. 
Seroconversion  of  direct  Coombs  test  from  negative  to  positive  is  a  known  side  effect  of  β-lactam 
exposure.  A  higher  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  compared  to  the 
meropenem group seroconverted from a negative result at baseline to a positive direct Coombs test result 
at  EOT,  36%  versus  3.6%.  The  seroconversion  rates  observed  were  similar  to  those  seen  in  other 
cephalosporin clinical trials. There were no TEAEs or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of hemolytic 
anemia in these subjects, and rates of TEAEs of anemia were similar between the ceftolozane/tazobactam 
and meropenem groups. 
Clinical Chemistry 
The baseline chemistry parameters were similar between the 2 treatment groups. For all scheduled visits 
(Day 3, Day 8, EOT, TOC, and LFU), no apparent differences were seen in mean values and mean changes 
from baseline between the 2 treatment groups in any particular parameter. 
The overall incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 toxicity was low. Considering the severity of illness in this 
study population, the incidence of worsening grade shifts during treatment was low and comparable for 
both treatment groups. 
Mild,  transient  transaminase  elevations  are  a  known  side  effect  of  β-lactam  therapy.  The  number  of 
subjects who demonstrated shifts from baseline in ALT or AST values and the magnitude of the shifts were 
similar  in  both  treatment  groups  at  each  time  point  assessed.  Mean  serum  transaminases  increased 
slightly during therapy in both treatment groups, peaking mostly at the EOT visit. 
Six subjects met predefined laboratory criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury (Hy’s law) (an AST 
or  ALT  value  ≥3  times  the  ULN  and  a  total  bilirubin  level  ≥2  times  the  ULN  with  concurrent  alkaline 
phosphatase value <2 times the upper limit of normal): 2 subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group 
and 4 in the meropenem group. Both subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group had medical histories 
of liver disease prior to study enrollment. One of these subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group had 
a medical history of cirrhosis and met the laboratory criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury at 
baseline  prior  to  initiation  of  study  drug  therapy,  precluding  drug-induced  hepatotoxicity  related  to 
ceftolozane/tazobactam as a cause for the LFT abnormalities. The other subject had a nonserious TEAE of 
“elevated  LFT”  considered  unrelated  to  study  drug  therapy  that  was  reported  on  study  Day  4  after 
hospital admission for cardiac arrest. This subject completed a 10-day course of ceftolozane/tazobactam. 
There were no clinical, hepatic-related TEAEs reported in this subject. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety in elderly subjects 
In  PN008,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs,  SAEs  and  fatal  TEAEs  were  higher  in  subjects  ≥65  years  of  age 
compared to those <65 years of age. The higher incidence of TEAEs among elderly subjects was observed 
in  both  treatment  groups,  and  was  not  associated  with  higher  rates  of  drug-related  TEAEs  or 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019 
Page 113/113 
 
  
discontinuations due to TEAEs, suggesting that this difference was related to the subjects’ underlying 
condition and not the study medication. 
Safety in subjects with renal impairment or hyperclearance 
In PN008, increased incidence of TEAEs and serious TEAEs was observed in subjects with moderate and 
severe renal impairment at baseline in both treatment groups compared with subjects with mild renal 
impairment, normal renal function, or hyperclearance (defined as CrCL >150 mL/min). There were no 
drug-related serious TEAEs in  subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment in either treatment 
group.  TEAEs  with  higher  incidence  in  subjects  with  moderate  and  severe  baseline  renal  impairment 
compared to subjects with normal renal function were distributed across multiple body systems. TEAE 
rates in subjects with hyperclearance were comparable to rates in subjects with normal renal function. 
TOL and TAZ plasma.  The number of drug-related TEAEs in subjects with hyperclearance was low in both 
treatment groups. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The  potential  for  DDIs  has  been  extensively  evaluated  in  non-clinical  in  vitro  studies,  showing  that 
TOL/TAZ  has  minimal  potential  for  cytochrome  P450-  and  transporter  mediated  DDIs  in  humans  at 
clinically relevant concentrations. A clinical study to evaluate the potential of TOL/TAZ to influence the PK 
of substrates metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 or transported by OAT1/OAT3 showed minimal impact 
on the PK profiles of these substrates. Inhibition of OAT has been shown to increase the half-life of TAZ by 
71%. Overall, based on these evaluations, the potential for clinically-relevant DDIs with TOL/TAZ and any 
consequent impact on safety is low. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 79 (11.0%) subjects discontinued study drug due to a TEAE. The proportion of discontinuations 
was similar between the 2 treatment groups. The majority of TEAEs that led to discontinuation of study 
drug were AEs that resulted in death. 
The SOCs with the highest percentage of TEAEs that lead to discontinuation from study drug therapy were 
infections and infestations (2.2% of subjects overall) and nervous system disorders (2.2% of subjects 
overall),  each  with  a  similar  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  2  treatment  groups.  TEAEs  that  lead  to 
discontinuation from study drug therapy reported in >1% of subject in either treatment group were septic 
shock and brain edema, which occurred in a similar proportion of subjects in each treatment group, and 
renal failure acute, which occurred in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group.  
Among  the  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  drug-related  treatment  discontinuations  were  low  in 
incidence and similar between the 2 treatment groups. 
Post marketing experience 
Current  post-marketing  experience  with  TOL/TAZ  (ceftolozane/  tazobactam)  relates  to  the  approved 
dose of 1.5 g administered every 8 hours in populations with cIAI and cUTI. While there are differences in 
the  dose  and  patient  population  between  these  currently  approved  indications  and  the  proposed  NP 
indication, available post-marketing data are summarized below to provide overall context for the current 
known safety profile of TOL/TAZ. 
TOL/TAZ was first approved for use for cIAI and cUTI in the U.S. on 19-DEC-2014 and is registered in 66 
countries as of 01-AUG-2018. There have been no records of any registration being revoked or withdrawn 
for safety reasons. 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019 
Page 114/114 
 
  
A cumulative review of post-marketing adverse events was conducted through 30-JUN-2018 and did not 
identify new safety issues.  
Post marketing Exposure 
The number of vials of TOL/TAZ (1 vial=1 g TOL and 0.5 g TAZ) distributed worldwide cumulatively since 
market introduction (19-DEC-2014 to 30-JUN-2018) was approximately 1,535,761. The usual dose of 
TOL/TAZ is 1 vial administered every 8 hours. The number of patient treatment-days for the cumulative 
period is 511,920 [1,535,761 vials ÷ 3 vials/day]. The usual duration of therapy is from 4 to 14 days, 
depending on the type of infection. This would imply that the estimated number of treatment courses 
would theoretically range  between 36,566 (511,920 patient treatment days ÷ 14 days) and 127,980 
(511,920  patient  treatment  days  ÷  4  days).  These  treatment  courses  represent  an  estimate  of  the 
number of patients receiving TOL/TAZ in the post-marketing environment. 
Post marketing Adverse Events 
A total of 951 reports (159, 17% serious) containing 1,517 events (263, 17% serious) were identified. 
The  SOCs  in  which  AEs  were  most  commonly  reported  were  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural 
complications (925 events), General disorders and administration site conditions SOC (277 events), and 
Infections and infestations SOC (80 events). 
The most commonly reported preferred terms in the Injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC 
were off label use (n=407) and product use in unapproved indication (n=279). Off label/unapproved use 
involved treatment of pneumonia or respiratory tract infections in the majority of the reports. 
Because of extensive “off-label” use the MAH has been instructed to provide a cumulative review of all 
cases including unapproved indication, prescribing error and incorrect drug administration duration. The 
worry  is  that  “off-label”  use  may  increase  the  risk  of  resistance  development.  Approval  of  the  new 
indication of nosocomial pneumonia has a potential to lower the widespread “off-label” use. 
The  most  commonly  reported  preferred  term  in  the  Infections  and  infestations  SOC  was  pathogen 
resistance  (n=25).  The  other  preferred  terms  reported  in  this  SOC  reflect  the  critically-ill  nature  of 
patients receiving TOL/TAZ or infections TOL/TAZ was being utilized to treat. For the resistance events, 
limited  clinical  and  microbiologic  data  precluded  thorough  assessment  of  reports.  Risk  factors  for 
development  of  resistance  were  often  present  including  use  of  multiple  antimicrobial  agents  to  treat 
infections  caused  by  multidrug  resistant  organisms  and  failure  to  properly  remove  infected  foci.  In 
addition, the dosing regimen for off label use of TOL/TAZ for NP was often not provided. In some of the 
reports where dose was included, 1.5 g was administered instead of the 3 g dose used in the clinical trial 
for NP (PN008). Insufficient antimicrobial levels are also a risk factor for development of antimicrobial 
resistance. 
In addition to the most commonly reported events described above, events known to be associated with 
TOL/TAZ,  including  hypersensitivity  reactions  and  CDAD,  were  reviewed.  One  report  coded  to  the 
preferred term anaphylaxis was retrieved. Available data in the case was limited and the event described 
redness  and  skin  eruption  with  no  other  signs  or  symptoms.  For  CDAD,  6  reports,  all  serious,  were 
retrieved. These reports described patients who had been administered other broad spectrum antibiotics 
and had significant comorbid conditions. Of the 5 CDAD reports containing outcome information, outcome 
was recovered in 2, recovering in 1, and not recovered in 2. 
Other events which have been reported following exposure to the cephalosporin class, including severe 
cutaneous reactions and renal impairment, were also reviewed. No reports of severe cutaneous adverse 
reactions were identified. Cumulatively, a total of 21 events, including 18 SAEs, have been reported in the 
Renal  and  urinary  disorders  SOC.  These  reports  either  contained  limited  information  or  the  events 
occurred in patients with underlying high morbidity due to medical history and/or concurrent conditions 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019

which precluded a meaningful drug-event causality assessment. No new safety signals were identified 
based upon review of these data. 
The applicant has an established process for continuous monitoring of medication errors for its products. 
Evaluation of the data on medication errors received for TOL/TAZ identified a potential for dosing errors 
following approval of TOL/TAZ in the U.S. The presentation of the strength statement on the vial label was 
cited as a cause of confusion which could lead to administration of more drug than was prescribed. The 
vial label was subsequently updated and a Dear Health Care Provider letter was distributed in the U.S. in 
JUN-2015. No further reports of this type of potential for medication error have been received. Review of 
AEs reported cumulatively through 30-JUN-2018 for preferred terms related to medication use issues do 
not indicate a new safety concern, and associated AEs were generally consistent with the known safety 
profile of TOL/TAZ. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The dose of 3 g (every 8 hours) was used in three phase 1 studies and a single phase 3 study. Only 71 
subjects were exposed in the three phase 1 studies, 35 healthy subjects and 36 critically ill. Because of 
low numbers and variable disease status of subjects in the phase 1 studies, safety is only reported for the 
phase 3 study in this report and no pooling of data was performed, which is considered adequate. 
Number of subjects randomized/treated/ongoing/discontinued in study PN008: 
• 
• 
In the ceftolozane/tazobactam group, 362 subjects were randomized, 361 (99.7%) were treated, 
263  (72.7%)  completed  and  98  (27.1%)  discontinued  trial  treatment,  and  245  (67.7%) 
completed and 117 (32.3%) withdrew from the study. 
In  the  meropenem  group,  364  subjects  were  randomized,  359  (98.6%)  were  treated,  271 
(74.5%) completed and 88 (24.2%) discontinued trial treatment, and 250 (68.7%) completed 
and 114 (31.3%) withdrew from the study. 
The population consisted of seriously ill subjects. Subjects were hospitalized for a mean duration of 10 
days prior to randomization and 49% were ventilated for ≥5 days prior to randomization. A total of 35.6% 
had renal impairment at baseline, 21.9% were ≥75 years of age, and 12.8% had failed prior therapy for 
the  current  episode  of  ventilated  nosocomial  pneumonia.  Ventilator-associated  bacterial  pneumonia 
accounted  for  71.5%  of  ventilated  nosocomial  pneumonia  diagnoses,  and  14.5%  of  subjects  were 
bacteremic  at  baseline.  Mortality  was  as  high  as  28-29%  and  88%  of  subjects  received  non-study 
antibiotic treatment within 14 days prior to study drug treatment. 
Only adults 18 years or older were included in the study for this indication.  No data on paediatric patients 
have been submitted for the 3 g dose used for this indication.  The median age was 62 years, minimum 
and  maximum  18  years  and  98  years,  with  160  (44%)  being  65  years  or  older  in  the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam group. The number of patients exposed to ceftolozane/tazobactam at the 3 g 
dose recommended for nosocomial pneumonia is considered acceptable for safety evaluation. 
A complicating factor in evaluating the relation between study drug and adverse reactions is the high use 
of  concomitant  non-study  antibiotics  (58%  of  ITT  population).  The  majority  of  those  on  non-study 
antibiotics  received  concomitant  antibiotics  after  discontinuing  study  drug,  while  21.3%  received 
non-study antibiotics while on study drug therapy. In addition, 94% received gram-positive adjunctive 
therapy  (according  to  protocol).    Gram-negative  adjunctive  therapy  was  allowed  at  baseline  for  a 
maximum of 72 hours according to protocol at sites with meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa. A total of 
29% of patients received gram-negative adjunctive therapy. 
A total number of 84% of patients reported any TEAE, of which 17% were mild, 28% moderate and 38% 
severe. TEAEs that occurred in ≥5% of subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group included anemia, 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019 
Page 116/116 
 
  
decubitus ulcer, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, and increased ALT and AST. Drug-related TEAEs were 
reported in 10% of the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 7% of the meropenem group. Drug-related 
TEAEs that were considered severe in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group included bradycardia, diarrhoea, 
hepatic failure, systemic candida, increased ALT, AST, and γ-glutamyl transferase.  
The SOCs with the highest percentage of subjects with serious TEAEs were cardiac disorders (10.0% of 
subjects overall) and infections and infestations (9.0% of subjects overall). Septic shock and multi-organ 
failure were the most commonly reported serious TEAE preferred terms (>3% of subjects overall), and all 
occurred  in  a  similar  proportion  in  each  treatment  group.  Cerebral  hemorrhage,  which  occurred  in  5 
subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and no subjects in the meropenem group, was the only 
serious TEAE preferred term with a 95% CI for risk  difference that did not include 0.  In 4 of these 5 
subjects, the cerebral hemorrhage represented a worsening of underlying intracranial hemorrhage that 
was present as a diagnosis on medical history 
More  subjects  experienced  serious  TEAEs  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  (8)  compared  to  the 
meropenem group (2). Only C. difficile colitis was reported by more than 1 subject as a treatment-related 
serious  TEAE  (C.  difficile  colitis  was  reported  by  2  subjects  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group).  All 
treatment-related serious TEAEs had resolved or were resolving at the end of the study. Two patients in 
the ceftolozane/tazobactam group reported serious drug-related TEAE of C. difficile colitis, while none of 
these  were  reported  as  severe  drug-related  TEAEs.  Also  hepatic  cholestatic  is  reported  as  serious 
drug-related TEAE in one patient, while hepatic failure but not hepatic cholestatic is reported as severe 
TEAE from the same group. During the procedure the applicant has described the use of classification of 
severity and seriousness for some of the TEAEs related to C. difficile colitis and hepatic events. A large 
proportion of patients discontinued the study, 32% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 31% in the 
meropenem  group.  The  majority  discontinued  study  because  of  adverse  event  (86-91%).    Also,  the 
proportion of patients that discontinued study drug was high, 27% for the ceftolozane/tazobactam group 
and 24% for the meropenem group. The most common reason for discontinuation of study drug was 
adverse event (36% ceftolozane/tazobactam and 47% meropenem) and insufficient therapeutic effect 
(23%  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  and  17%  meropenem).  The  majority  of  TEAEs  that  led  to 
discontinuation of study drug were AEs that resulted in death. The high proportion of discontinuation from 
the drug and study mirrors the severity of disease in this population with high mortality. 
Among  the  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  drug-related  treatment  discontinuations  were  low  in 
incidence and similar between the 2 treatment groups (1.1 and 1.4%). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No  new  safety  signals  have  been  detected  from  the  study  supporting  the  nosocomial  pneumonia 
indication. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.1 is acceptable.  
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019 
Page 117/117 
 
  
Annex  I  of  the  RMP  template,  reflecting  the  final  RMP  agreed  at  the  time  of  the  Opinion  should  be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 2.1. 
No new safety concerns according to GVP module 5 were identified, thus neither risk minimisation nor 
Pharmacovigilance activities are necessary.  
2.7.  Update of the Product Information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC 
have  been  updated.  The  Package  Leaflet  has  been  updated  accordingly.  The  applicant  also  took  the 
opportunity to implement editorial changes in sections 5.2 of the SmPC and to bring Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC and section 2 of the PL in line with the latest Annex to the EC guideline on 'Excipients in the labelling 
and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use'. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No  justification  for  not  performing  a  full  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applied extension of indication for ceftolozane/tazobactam is: 
“Treatment  of  adults  with  nosocomial  pneumonia  (NP),  including  ventilator-associated  pneumonia 
(VAP)”.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Nosocomial  pneumonia,  including  ventilator-associated  pneumonia  is  a  severe  disease,  and  can  be  a 
life-threatening condition. The mortality risk increases when the NP infection is caused by MDR bacteria 
and in patients with concurrent bacteraemia. The mortality rate attributable to NP ranges from 33% to 
50%. 
Due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, few antibiotic agents are broadly active 
against the gram-negative organisms frequently isolated from NP infections. The WHO (2017) identified 
carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa as a critical threat with an urgent need of new antibiotics. Recent 
data show an increase in the prevalence of NP caused by MDR pathogens, most commonly P. aeruginosa, 
with  documented  resistance  to  β-lactams,  carbapenems,  aminoglycosides,  and  fluoroquinolones. 
Although increasing drug resistance has diminished the utility of established antipseudomonal β-lactam 
antibiotics, there are still some antibacterial agents that are effective in treatment of NP/VAP patients. 
However,  considering  the  high  prevalence  and  severity  of  these  infections,  as  well  as  increasing 
prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, effective treatment options are still needed. Particularly, there 
is an unmet medical need for treatment of patients infected with certain pathogens such as MDR-resistant 
P. aeruginosa.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical program for ceftolozane/tazobactam comprises one pivotal phase 3 clinical study (PN008). 
The pivotal study PN008 is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled phase 3 study, 
comparing the efficacy and safety of ceftolozane/tazobactam to meropenem in adult patients with NP 
(including  VAP  and  ventilated  hospital-acquired  pneumonia  [HAP]).  Patients  were  randomised  1:1  to 
receive either ceftolozane/tazobactam or meropenem. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem was demonstrated for the primary 
endpoint clinical response in the ITT population at the Test-of Cure (TOC) visit (54.4%, 197/362 in the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam  arm  vs.  194/364,  53.3%  in  the  meropenem  arm).  Non-inferiority  of 
ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem was also demonstrated for the key secondary endpoint 
Day 28 all-cause mortality in the ITT population (87/362, 24.0% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. 
92/364,  25.3%  in  the  meropenem  group).  For  both  the  primary  endpoint  and  the  key  secondary 
endpoint, the lower limits of the stratified 97.5% CIs were within the non-inferiority margin of -12.5% 
(i.e. 1.1% [-7.20, 9.31] and 1.1% [-6.03, 8.28], respectively). 
The above-mentioned results were supported by the sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy outcomes 
and of the findings in the secondary endpoint of clinical response at TOC for the clinically evaluable (CE) 
population. 
In the microbiologically Intent-to-Treat (mITT) population, at the TOC visit, 193/264 (73.1%) patients in 
the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm and 168/247 (68.0%) subjects in the meropenem arm had a favourable 
microbiological  response.  The  corresponding  results  achieved  for  the  Microbiologically  Evaluable  (ME) 
population were in support of the findings in the mITT population. 
For  the  most  commonly  isolated  pathogens  (i.e.  Enterobacteriaceae,  K.  pneumoniae,  E.  coli,  P. 
aeruginosa) the per-pathogen clinical and microbiological response rates in the mITT population were, in 
general, comparable between the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm and the meropenem arm. However, for P. 
aeruginosa the microbiological response rates were higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm compared 
to the meropenem arm (47/63, 74.6% vs. 41/65, 63.1%, respectively). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Approximately 30% of the patients in the ITT population had at least one important protocol deviation 
during the study. These deviations included mainly issues such as not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria 
(in  total  64/229,  8.8%),  lack  of  safety  reporting  (in  total  18/229,  2.5%)  and  not  following  trial 
procedure/study interventions (in total, 190/229, 26.2%). Approximately 40% of the important protocol 
deviations led to exclusion of patient data from the CE population.  
The  Day  28  All-cause  mortality  rate  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  P.  aeruginosa  as  baseline  LRT 
pathogen, was higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. the meropenem arm (16/63, 25.4% vs. 
12/65,  18.5%,  respectively).  The  same  tendency  of  higher  mortality  rates  was  also  observed  for  the 
subgroups of patients that were bacteremic at baseline “all respiratory pathogens” (14/29, 48.3% vs. 
7/21, 33.3%) and bacteremic at baseline “all gram-negative respiratory pathogens” (13/25, 52.0% vs. 
7/19, 36.8%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. the meropenem arm, respectively. 
Clinical cure rates for ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem were lower in patients ≥ 75 years 
of age (35/83, 42.2% vs. 42/76, 55.3%), patients who had no prior antibiotic therapy (19/44, 43.2% vs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019 
Page 119/119 
 
  
23/41,  56.1%)  and  patients  who  had  baseline  gram-negative  adjunctive therapy  (47/103,  45.6%  vs. 
64/112, 57.1%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. the meropenem arm, respectively.  
The  microbiological  response  rates  for  ESBL+  K.  pneumoniae  were  33/53,  62.3%  in  the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam arm compared to 38/52, 73.1% in the meropenem arm. Although the results in 
the  ME  population  was  overall  consistent  with  the  results  in  the  mITT  population,  the  microbiological 
response rates for ESBL+ K. pneumoniae were similar between ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem 
in this population (20/30, 66.7% vs. 18/27, 66.7%, respectively). 
Although  higher  microbiological  response  rates  were  observed  in  the  mITT  population  for  Amp  C  – 
producing P. aeruginosa in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group vs. the meropenem group, the number of 
isolates was limited to 15 in total. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The dose of 3 g (every 8 hours) was used in three phase 1 studies and a single phase 3 study. Because 
of low numbers and variable disease status of subjects in the phase 1 studies, safety is reported only for 
the phase 3 study in this report. 
The population consisted of seriously ill subjects. Subjects were hospitalised for a mean duration of 10 
days prior to randomization and 49% were ventilated for ≥5 days prior to randomization. A total of 35.6% 
had renal impairment at baseline, 21.9% were ≥75 years of age, and 12.8% had failed prior therapy for 
the  current  episode  of  ventilated  nosocomial  pneumonia.  Ventilator-associated  bacterial  pneumonia 
accounted  for  71.5%  of  ventilated  nosocomial  pneumonia  diagnoses,  and  14.5%  of  subjects  were 
bacteremic  at  baseline.  Mortality  was  as  high  as  28-29%  and  88%  of  subjects  received  non-study 
antibiotic  treatment  within  14  days  prior  to  study  drug  treatment.    A  large  number  of  patients 
discontinued study treatment or did not complete the study: 
• 
• 
In the ceftolozane/tazobactam group, 362 subjects were randomized, 361 (99.7%) were treated, 
263  (72.7%)  completed  and  98  (27.1%)  discontinued  trial  treatment,  and  245  (67.7%) 
completed the study. 
In  the  meropenem  group,  364  subjects  were  randomized,  359  (98.6%)  were  treated,  271 
(74.5%) completed and 88 (24.2%) discontinued trial treatment, and 250 (68.7%) completed 
the study. 
A total number of 84% of patients reported any TEAE, of which 17% were mild, 28% moderate and 38% 
severe. TEAEs that occurred in ≥5% of subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group included anemia, 
decubitus ulcer, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, and increased ALT and AST. Drug-related TEAEs were 
reported in 10% of the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 7% of the meropenem group. Drug-related 
TEAEs that were considered severe in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group included bradycardia, diarrhoea, 
hepatic failure, systemic candida, increased ALT, AST, and γ-glutamyl transferase. 
The SOCs with the highest percentage of subjects with serious TEAEs were cardiac disorders (10.0% of 
subjects overall) and infections and infestations (9.0% of subjects overall). Septic shock and multi-organ 
failure were the most commonly reported serious TEAE preferred terms (>3% of subjects overall), and all 
occurred in a similar proportion in each treatment group.  
More  subjects  experienced  serious  TEAEs  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  (8)  compared  to  the 
meropenem group (2). Only C. difficile colitis was reported by more than 1 subject as a treatment-related 
serious  TEAE  (C.  difficile  colitis  was  reported  by  2  subjects  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group).  All 
treatment-related serious TEAEs had resolved or were resolving at the end of the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/463294/2019 
Page 120/120 
 
  
A large proportion of patients discontinued the study, 32% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 31% 
in  the  meropenem  group,  the  majority  because  of  adverse  event  (86-91%).    Also,  the  proportion  of 
patients that discontinued study drug was high, 27% for the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 24% for 
the meropenem group and the most common reason was adverse event (36% ceftolozane/tazobactam 
and 47% meropenem) and insufficient therapeutic effect (23% ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 17% 
meropenem). The majority of TEAEs that led to discontinuation of study drug were AEs that resulted in 
death.  Drug-related  treatment  discontinuations  were  low  in  incidence  and  similar  between  the  2 
treatment groups (1.1 and 1.4%). 
No  new  safety  signals  have  been  detected  from  the  study  supporting  the  nosocomial  pneumonia 
indication. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A complicating factor in evaluating the relation between study drug and adverse reactions is the high use 
of concomitant non-study antibiotics (58% of ITT population), defined as non-study antibiotics received 
from  the  first  dose  of  study  therapy  to  the  Late  follow-up.  The  majority  of  these  subjects  received 
non-study antibiotics after discontinuing study drug, while 21.3% received non-study antibiotics while on 
study drug therapy. In addition, 94% received gram-positive adjunctive therapy (required per protocol). 
Gram-negative adjunctive therapy was allowed at baseline for a maximum of 72 hours according to the 
protocol at sites with meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa. 
Based on the current guidelines, the removal of the important identified and potential risks as well as 
missing information is supported. 
Tazobactam  crosses  the  placenta,  while  this  is  not  known  for  ceftolozane.  As  described  in  the  SmPC 
reproductive toxicity has been shown in an animal study (rat) with tazobactam. Also, with ceftolozane 
there was a finding of decreased auditory startle response in rat pups.  The clinical significance of these 
animal data is not known as there are no data in pregnant or lactating woman. Pregnant women might be 
exposed  if  the  prescriber  considers  “benefit  outweighs  the  possible  risks  to  the  pregnant  woman  and 
foetus” and the new indication for Zerbaxa combined with a doubling of the dose will increase exposure in 
pregnant and lactating woman. It is considered important to focus on obtaining experience from pregnant 
and lactating women, which could be through routine PV and reporting in PSURs. There is a critical gap in 
knowledge for use in pregnant and lactating women; such use should be reported in the PSUR.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Non–inferiority  of  ceftolozane/tazobactam  to  meropenem  has  been  clearly  demonstrated  for  both  the 
primary  and  the  key  secondary  endpoints  in  the  patients  with  NP/VAP  that  is  considered  to  be 
representative  of  the  target  population.  The  similar  rates  of  clinical  cure  achieved  for  the  primary 
endpoint at TOC for ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem indicate that ceftolozane/tazobactam has 
the potential to be an alternative to meropenem in the treatment of NP/ VAP.  
The  Day  28  All-cause  mortality  rate  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  P.  aeruginosa  as  baseline  LRT 
pathogen, was higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. the meropenem arm (16/63, 25.4% vs. 
12/65,  18.5%,  respectively).  The  same  tendency  of  higher  mortality  rates  was  also  observed  for  the 
subgroups of patients that were bacteremic at baseline “all respiratory pathogens” (14/29, 48.3% vs. 
7/21, 33.3%) and bacteremic at baseline “all gram-negative respiratory pathogens” (13/25, 52.0% vs. 
7/19, 36.8%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. the meropenem arm, respectively.  
There  were  differences  in  the  demographics  of  ceftolozane/tazobactam  versus  meropenem:  a  higher 
percentage  of  subjects  ≥75  years  old  in  the  ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  (23.8%)  compared  to  the 
meropenem group (16.9%), a higher rate of subjects that had failed prior antibiotic therapy (17.5% vs. 
6.2%) and of subjects that were bacteremic at baseline (27.0% vs. 10.8%). In addition, there was a 
higher proportion of subjects with different co-morbidities (i.e. diabetes, congestive heart failure) in the

ceftolozane/tazobactam  group  than  in  the  meropenem  group.  It  is  agreed  that  these  differences  in 
demographic factors between the treatment groups might have affected the study results.  
Clinical cure rates for ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem were lower in patients ≥ 75 years 
of age (35/83, 42.2% vs. 42/76, 55.3%), patients who had no prior antibiotic therapy (19/44, 43.2% vs. 
23/41,  56.1%)  and  patients  who  had  baseline  gram-negative  adjunctive therapy  (47/103,  45.6%  vs. 
64/112, 57.1%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm vs. the meropenem arm, respectively. 
Increased failure rate in patients >75 years of age as well as patients who did not receive any antibiotic 
therapy  prior  to  study  entry  may  be  attributed  to  the  differences 
in  demographics  of 
ceftolozane/tazobactam versus meropenem-treated subjects in this subgroup as ceftolozane/tazobactam 
subjects displayed more high-risk characteristics at baseline. The rates of susceptibility to study therapy 
were lower in the subjects with Enterobacteriaceae in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group compared to the 
meropenem group (84.4% vs. 100%) and this might also have contributed to a lower clinical response 
rate in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group. 
It  is  acknowledged  that  given  the  small  number  of  patients  studied  overall  and  in  the  individual 
subgroups, definite conclusions are difficult to draw both in terms of efficacy and safety. 
Despite not being allowed according to the study protocol, concomitant administration of carbapenems 
(including meropenem) as “any non-study concomitant antibiotic medication” was given to the patients in 
the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm. This might have impacted the clinical and microbiological success rates. 
However, the results from a sensitivity analysis in which patients receiving concomitant carbapenems 
were regarded as clinical failures were comparable to the results in the overall study population. It is 
therefore agreed that the use of concomitant carbapenems before TOC probably have not affected the 
clinical outcome of the study. 
No new safety signals have been detected from the study supporting the NP indication. 
It  should  be  emphasized  that  ceftolozane/tazobactam  does  not  address  an  unmet  medical  need  for 
treatment of all resistant pathogens against meropenem such as ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and 
MDR  P.  aeruginosa.  Nevertheless,  it  might  likely  be  efficacious  in  some  patients  infected  with  P. 
aeruginosa  that 
is  resistant  to  several  other  antibacterial  drugs, 
including  carbapenems. 
Ceftolozane/tazobactam  with  comparable  efficacy  and  safety  to  meropenem,  including  efficacy  in 
patients with infections caused by beta-lactam-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, would be 
a clinically relevant and useful addition to the available treatment options.

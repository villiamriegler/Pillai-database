Prescriber Guide 
The Prescriber Guide provides recommendations for the use of ‘Xarelto’ 
in order to minimise the risk of bleeding during treatment with ‘Xarelto’. 
The Prescriber Guide does not substitute the ‘Xarelto’ 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).* 
[*optional: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/xarelto]  
Patient Alert Card 
A patient alert card must be provided to each patient who is prescribed  
Xarelto® 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg or 20 mg and is provided with the product 
package. The implications of anticoagulant treatment should be explained.  
Specifically, the need for compliance, signs of bleeding and when to seek 
medical attention should be discussed with the patient. 
The patient alert card will inform physicians and dentists about the patient‘s 
anticoagulation treatment and will contain emergency contact information. The 
patient should be instructed to carry the patient alert card at all times and 
present it to every healthcare provider.

Dosing Recommendations 
Stroke prevention in adult patients with non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation 
The recommended dose for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in 
patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (SPAF) is 20 mg once daily. 
Patients with renal impairment 
In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance [CrCl] 30–49 ml/min) or severe 
(CrCl 15–29 ml/min) renal impairment the recommended dose is 15 mg once 
daily. ‘Xarelto’ is to be used with caution in patients with severe renal 
impairment (CrCl 15–29 ml/min) and is not recommended in patients with CrCl 
<15 ml/min. 
‘Xarelto’ should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment 
concomitantly receiving other medicinal products that increase rivaroxaban 
plasma concentrations. 
Duration of therapy 
Xarelto® should be continued long term provided the benefit of stroke 
prevention therapy outweighs the potential risk of bleeding. 
Missed dose   
If a dose is missed, the patient should take ‘Xarelto’ immediately and continue 
on the following day with the once-daily intake as recommended. The dose 
should not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose. 
5 
 
 
Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI 
with stent placement 
There is limited experience of a reduced dose of 15 mg ‘Xarelto’ once daily (or 
10 mg ‘Xarelto’ once daily for patients with moderate renal impairment 
[creatinine clearance 30–49 ml/min]) in addition to a P2Y12 inhibitor for a 
maximum of 12 months in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who 
require oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI with stent placement. 
Patients undergoing cardioversion 
‘Xarelto’ can be initiated or continued in patients who may require cardioversion. 
For transoesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guided cardioversion in patients 
not previously treated with anticoagulants, ‘Xarelto’ treatment should be started 
at least 4 hours before cardioversion to ensure adequate anticoagulation. For all 
patients, confirmation should be sought prior to cardioversion that the patient 
has taken ‘Xarelto’ as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and duration of 
treatment should take established guideline recommendations for anticoagulant 
treatment in patients undergoing cardioversion into account. 
6 
 
 
 
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in 
adult patients and in children 
Adults 
Adult patients are initially treated with Xarelto® 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 
weeks. This initial treatment is followed by ‘Xarelto’ 20 mg once daily for the 
continued treatment period. When extended prevention of recurrent DVT and 
PE is indicated (following completion of at least 6 months’ therapy for DVT or 
PE), the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. In patients in whom the risk 
of recurrent DVT or PE is considered high, such as those with complicated 
comorbidities, or who have developed recurrent DVT or PE on extended 
prevention with ‘Xarelto’ 10 mg once daily, a dose of ‘Xarelto’ 20 mg once 
daily should be considered. 
‘Xarelto’ 10 mg is not recommended for the initial 6 months’ treatment of  
DVT or PE. 
Children 
In pediatric patients 6 months to <18 years of age ‘Xarelto’ treatment using the 
most appropriate formulation should be initiated following ≥5 days of initial 
anticoagulation treatment with parenteral heparins. Dosing is based on body 
weight.   
In pediatric patients from term neonates to <6 months of age, who at birth had 
≥37 weeks of gestation, weigh ≥2.6 kg, and have had ≥10 days of oral feeding, 
‘Xarelto’ treatment using the oral suspension formulation should be initiated 
7 
 
 
 
following ≥5 days of initial anticoagulation treatment with parenteral heparins. 
Dosing is based on body weight.   
For children and adolescents weighing ≥30 kg ‘Xarelto’ tablet or oral suspension 
once daily can be administered. The dose is determined based on body weight. 
For children and adolescents with body weight of 2.6 kg to <30.0 kg only the 
oral suspension should be used. The dose and frequency of administration is 
determined based on body weight.

The weight of a child should be monitored and the dose reviewed regularly, 
especially for children <12 kg. This is to ensure a therapeutic dose is 
maintained. 
Use is not recommended in children <6 months of age who: 
♦  at birth had <37 weeks of gestation, or  
♦  have a body weight of <2.6 kg, or 
♦  had <10 days of oral feeding 
as dosing of ‘Xarelto’ cannot be reliably determined in these patient populations 
and was not studied. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Adults 
Patients with moderate (CrCl 30–49 ml/min) or severe (CrCl 15–29 ml/min) 
renal impairment treated for acute DVT, acute PE and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE should be treated with Xarelto® 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 
weeks. 
♦ Thereafter, the recommended dose is ‘Xarelto’ 20 mg once daily. A reduction 
of the dose from 20 mg once daily to 15 mg once daily should be considered 
if the patient’s assessed risk of bleeding outweighs the risk of recurrent DVT 
and PE. The recommendation for the use of 15 mg is based on 
pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling and has not been studied in this clinical 
setting. ‘Xarelto’ is to be used with caution in patients with severe renal 
impairment (CrCl 15–29 ml/min) and is not recommended in patients with 
CrCl <15 ml/min. When the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, (after ≥6 
months of therapy) no dose adjustment from the recommended dose is 
necessary. 
‘Xarelto’ should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment* 
concomitantly receiving other medicinal products that increase rivaroxaban 
plasma concentrations. 
Children 
No dose adjustment is required for children ≥1 year with mild renal impairment 
(glomerular filtration rate: 50 mL - ≤80 mL/min/1.73 m2), based on data in adults 
and limited data in pediatric patients. 
‘Xarelto’ is not recommended in children ≥1 year with moderate or severe renal 
impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/ min / 1.73 m2), as no clinical data 
is available. 
In children <1 year estimation of serum creatinine instead of GFR is applied. 
‘Xarelto’ is not recommended in children <1 year with serum creatinine results 
97.5th percentile, as no clinical data is available (see SmPC Granules for oral 
suspension for reference values).  
*With moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-49 ml/min) for 'Xarelto' 10 mg 
9 
 
 
Duration of therapy 
Adults 
Short duration of therapy (≥3 months) should be considered in patients with 
DVT/PE provoked by major transient risk factors (i.e. recent major surgery or 
trauma). Longer duration of therapy should be considered in patients with 
provoked DVT/PE not related to major transient risk factors, unprovoked 
DVT/PE, or a history of recurrent DVT/PE. 
Children 
All children, except those aged <2 years with catheter-related thrombosis 
Therapy with ‘Xarelto’ can be continued for ≥3 months. Treatment can be 
extended up to 12 months when clinically necessary. The benefit-risk of 
continued therapy after 3 months should be assessed on an individual basis 
taking into account the risk for recurrent thrombosis versus the potential 
bleeding risk. 
Children aged <2 years with catheter-related thrombosis 
Therapy with ‘Xarelto’ can be continued for ≥1 months. Treatment can be 
extended up to 3 months when clinically necessary. The benefit-risk of 
continued therapy after 1 month should be assessed on an individual basis 
taking into account the risk for recurrent thrombosis versus the potential 
bleeding risk. 
Missed dose 
Adults 
♦ Twice-daily treatment period (15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks):  
If a dose is missed, the patient should take ‘Xarelto’ immediately to ensure 
intake of 30 mg ‘Xarelto’ per day. In this case, two 15 mg tablets may be  
taken at once. Continue with the regular 15 mg twice-daily intake on the 
following day 
♦ Once-daily treatment period (beyond 3 weeks): If a dose is missed, the 
patient should take ‘Xarelto’ immediately and continue on the following  
day with the once-daily intake as recommended. The dose should not be 
doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose 
Children 
Once daily regimen: 
A missed dose should be taken as soon as possible after it is noticed, but only 
on the same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and 
continue with the next dose as prescribed. The patient should not take two 
doses to make up for a missed dose. 
Two times daily regimen 
10 
 
 
A missed morning dose should be taken immediately when it is noticed, and it 
may be taken together with the evening dose. A missed evening dose can only 
be taken in the same evening. 
Three times daily regimen 
The three times daily administration schedule with approximately 8-hour 
intervals should be resumed at the next scheduled dose without compensating 
for the missed dose. 
On the following day, the child should continue with the regular once, twice, or 
three times daily regimen. 
11 
 
 
 
 
Prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with 
coronary artery disease (CAD) or symptomatic peripheral 
artery disease (PAD) at high risk of ischaemic events 
Patients taking Xarelto® 2.5 mg twice daily should also take a daily dose of  
75-100 mg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). 
Safety and efficacy of ‘Xarelto’ 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with ASA plus 
clopidogrel/ticlopidine has only been studied in patients with recent  
ACS (see below). 
Dual antiplatelet therapy has not been studied in combination with  
‘Xarelto’ 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with CAD and/or PAD. 
Patients with renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with moderate renal impairment  
(CrCl 30–49 ml/min). ‘Xarelto’ is to be used with caution in patients with severe 
renal impairment (CrCl 15–29 ml/min) and is not recommended in patients with 
CrCl <15 ml/min. 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30–49 ml/min) concomitantly 
receiving other medicinal products that increase rivaroxaban plasma 
concentrations, ‘Xarelto’ is to be used with caution. 
Duration of therapy 
Duration of treatment should be determined for each individual patient based on 
regular evaluations and should consider the risk for thrombotic events versus 
the bleeding risks. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other warnings and precautions in CAD/PAD patients 
In patients with an acute thrombotic event or vascular procedure and a need for 
dual antiplatelet therapy, the continuation of Xarelto® 2.5 mg twice daily should 
be evaluated depending on the type of event or procedure and antiplatelet 
regimen. 
Concomitant treatment of CAD/PAD with ‘Xarelto’ 2.5 mg twice daily and ASA is 
contraindicated in patients with previous haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke, or any 
stroke within a month 
‘Xarelto’ co-administered with ASA should be used with caution in CAD/PAD 
patients: 
♦  ≥ 75 years of age. The benefit-risk of the treatment should be individually 
assessed on a regular basis  
♦  With a lower weight (<60 kg)  
 In CAD patients with severe symptomatic heart failure. Study data indicate that     
       such patients may benefit less from treatment with ‘Xarelto’. (See section 5.1 of  
the SmPC for further clarification)

If a dose is missed, the patient should continue with the regular 2.5 mg ‘Xarelto’ 
dose as recommended at the next scheduled time. The dose should not be 
doubled to make up for a missed dose. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients after 
an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with elevated cardiac 
biomarkers 
The recommended dose of Xarelto® is 2.5 mg twice daily, starting as soon as 
possible after stabilisation of the index ACS event but at the earliest 24 hours 
after hospital admission and at the time when parenteral anticoagulation 
therapy would normally be discontinued. 
In addition to ‘Xarelto’ 2.5 mg, patients should also take a daily dose of  
75–100 mg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or a daily dose of 75-100 mg ASA in 
addition to either a daily dose of 75 mg clopidogrel or a standard daily 
dose of ticlopidine. 
Treatment in combination with other antiplatelet agents, e.g. prasugrel or 
ticagrelor, has not been studied and is not recommended. 
Patients with renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with moderate renal impairment  
(CrCl 30–49 ml/min). ‘Xarelto’ is to be used with caution in patients with severe 
renal impairment (CrCl 15–29 ml/min) and is not recommended in patients with 
CrCl <15 ml/min. 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30–49 ml/min) concomitantly 
receiving other medicinal products that increase rivaroxaban plasma 
concentrations, ‘Xarelto’ is to be used with caution. 
Duration of therapy 
Treatment should be regularly evaluated in the individual patient weighing the 
risk of ischaemic events against the bleeding risks. Extension of treatment 
beyond 12 months should be done on an individual patient basis as experience 
up to 24 months is limited. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other warnings and precautions in ACS patients 
Xarelto®, co-administered with ASA or with ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine, 
should be used with caution in ACS patients: 
♦  ≥75 years of age. The benefit risk of the treatment should be individually 
assessed on a regular basis 
♦  With a lower weight (<60 kg) 
Concomitant treatment of ACS with ‘Xarelto’ and antiplatelet therapy is 
contraindicated in patients with a prior stroke or a transient ischaemic attack 
(TIA). 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, the patient should continue with the regular 2.5 mg ‘Xarelto’ 
dose as recommended at the next scheduled time. The dose should not be 
doubled to make up for a missed dose. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip 
or knee replacement surgery 
The recommended dose is 10 mg Xarelto® taken orally once daily. The initial 
dose should be taken 6 to 10 hours after surgery, provided that haemostasis  
has been established. 
Duration of treatment 
The duration of treatment depends on the individual risk of the patient for 
venous thromboembolism which is determined by the type of orthopaedic 
surgery. 
♦  For patients undergoing major hip surgery, a treatment duration of 5 
weeks is recommended 
♦  For patients undergoing major knee surgery, a treatment duration of 2 
weeks is recommended 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, the patient should take ‘Xarelto’ immediately and then 
continue the following day with once-daily intake as before. 
16 
 
 
 
 
Oral Intake 
Xarelto® 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets can be taken with or without food.  
‘Xarelto’ 1 mg/mL granules for oral suspension and ‘Xarelto’ 15 mg and 20 
mg tablets must be taken with food. The intake of these doses with food at 
the same time supports the required absorption of the drug, thus ensuring a 
high oral bioavailability. 
Adults 
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, a ‘Xarelto’ tablet may be 
crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately prior to use and then 
administered orally. After the administration of crushed ‘Xarelto’ 15 mg or 20 mg 
film-coated tablets, the dose should be immediately followed by food. 
The crushed ‘Xarelto’ tablet may also be given through gastric tubes after 
confirmation of the correct gastric placement of the tube. The crushed tablet 
should be administered in a small amount of water via a gastric tube after which 
it should be flushed with water. After the administration of crushed  
‘Xarelto’ 15 mg or 20 mg film-coated tablets, the dose should then be 
immediately followed by enteral feeding. 
Children 
For children who are unable to swallow whole tablets, ‘Xarelto’ granules for oral 
suspension should be used. If the oral suspension is not immediately available, 
when doses of ‘Xarelto’ 15 mg or 20 mg are prescribed, these could be 
provided by crushing the 15 mg or 20 mg tablet and mixing it with water or soft 
foods such as applesauce immediately prior to use and administered orally. 
The oral suspension and the crushed ‘Xarelto’ tablet may be given through 
nasogastric or gastric feeding tube. Gastric placement of the tube should be 
confirmed before administering ‘Xarelto’. Avoid administration of ‘Xarelto’ distal 
to the stomach. 
Perioperative Management 
If an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required: 
♦ 
♦ 
‘Xarelto’ 10/15/20 mg should be stopped at least 24 hours before the 
intervention 
‘Xarelto’ 2.5 mg should be stopped at least 12 hours before the intervention 
if possible and based on the clinical judgement of the physician. If the 
procedure cannot be delayed, the increased risk of bleeding should be 
assessed against the urgency of the intervention. 
17 
 
 
‘Xarelto’ should be restarted after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention 
as soon as possible provided the clinical situation allows, and adequate 
haemostasis has been established. 
Spinal/Epidural Anaesthesia or 
Puncture 
When neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal/epidural anaesthesia) or spinal/epidural 
puncture is employed, patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention 
of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal 
haematoma, which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of 
these events may be increased by the post-operative use of indwelling epidural 
catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis. 
The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal 
puncture. Patients are to be frequently monitored for signs and symptoms of 
neurological impairment (e.g. numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel or 
bladder dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and 
treatment is necessary. Prior to neuraxial intervention the physician should 
consider the potential benefit versus the risk in anticoagulated patients or in 
patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. 
For indication-specific recommendations, please refer to the  
sections below: 
♦  Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF  
♦  Treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adult 
patients 
♦  Treatment of VTE and prevention of VTE recurrence in children 
There is no clinical experience with the use of 15 mg and 20 mg Xarelto® in 
adults in these situations. To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated 
with the concurrent use of ‘Xarelto’ and neuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia 
or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban. 
Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best 
performed when the anticoagulant effect of ‘Xarelto’ is estimated to be low. 
However, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each 
patient is not known. 
For the removal of an epidural catheter and based on the general 
pharmacokinetic characteristics at least 2x half-life, i.e. at least 18 hours in 
young adult patients and 26 hours in elderly patients should elapse after the last 
administration of ‘Xarelto’ (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). Following removal of 
the catheter, at least 6 hours should elapse before the next ‘Xarelto’ dose is 
administered. If traumatic puncture occurs, the administration of ‘Xarelto’ is to 
be delayed for 24 hours. 
18 
 
No data is available on the placement or removal of a neuraxial catheter in 
children while on ‘Xarelto’. Discontinue ‘Xarelto’ and consider a short acting 
parenteral anticoagulant. 
♦  Prevention of VTE in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee 
replacement surgery 
To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of 
‘Xarelto’ and neuraxial (epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, 
consider the pharmacokinetic profile of ‘Xarelto’.  
Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best 
performed when the anticoagulant effect of ‘Xarelto’ is estimated to be low (see 
section 5.2 of the SmPC).  
At least 18 hours should elapse after the last administration of ‘Xarelto’ before 
removal of an epidural catheter. Following removal of the catheter, at least 
6 hours should elapse before the next ‘Xarelto’ dose is administered. If 
traumatic puncture occurs the administration of ‘Xarelto’ is to be delayed for 
24 hours. 
♦  Prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with coronary artery 
disease (CAD) or symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) at high risk 
of ischaemic events 
♦  Prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients after an ACS with 
elevated cardiac biomarkers 
There is no clinical experience with the use of 2.5 mg with ASA alone or with 
ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine in these situations. To reduce the potential 
risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of ‘Xarelto’ and neuraxial 
(epidural/spinal) anaesthesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic 
profile of ‘Xarelto’.  
Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best 
performed when the anticoagulant effect of ‘Xarelto’ is estimated to be low (see 
section 5.2 of the SmPC). However, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low 
anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. Platelet aggregation inhibitors 
should be discontinued as suggested by the manufacturer’s prescribing 
information. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
Converting from VKA to Xarelto® 
For patients treated for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, 
treatment with VKA should be stopped and ‘Xarelto’ therapy should be initiated 
when the INR ≤3.0. 
For patients treated for DVT, PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE, 
treatment with VKA should be stopped and ‘Xarelto’ therapy should be initiated 
when the INR ≤2.5. 
INR measurement is not appropriate to measure the anticoagulant activity 
of ‘Xarelto’, and therefore should not be used for this purpose. Treatment with 
‘Xarelto’ only does not require routine coagulation monitoring. 
20 
 
 
 
 
Converting from Xarelto® to VKA 
It is important to ensure adequate anticoagulation while minimising the risk of 
bleeding during conversion of therapy. 
Adults and children 
When converting to VKA, ‘Xarelto’ and VKA should be given overlapping until 
the INR ≥2.0. For the first 2 days of the conversion period, standard initial 
dosing of VKA should be used followed by VKA dosing guided by INR testing. 
INR measurement is not appropriate to measure the anticoagulant activity 
of ‘Xarelto’. While patients are on both ‘Xarelto’ and VKA the INR should not 
be tested earlier than 24 hours after the previous dose but prior to the 
next dose of ‘Xarelto’. Once ‘Xarelto’ is discontinued, INR values obtained at 
least 24 hours after the last dose reliably reflect the VKA dosing. 
Children  
Children who convert from ‘Xarelto’ to VKA need to continue ‘Xarelto’ for 48 
hours after the first dose of VKA. After 2 days of co-administration an INR 
should be obtained prior to the next scheduled dose of ‘Xarelto’. Co-
administration of ‘Xarelto’ and VKA is advised to continue until the INR is ≥ 2.0 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Converting from Parenteral 
Anticoagulants to Xarelto® 
♦  Patients with a parenteral drug on a fixed dosing scheme such as low-
molecular-weight heparin (LMWH): Discontinue parenteral drug and start 
‘Xarelto’ 0 to 2 hours before the time of the next scheduled administration 
of the parenteral drug 
♦  Patients with a continuously administered parenteral drug such as 
intravenous unfractionated heparin: Start ‘Xarelto’ at the time of 
discontinuation 
Converting from ‘Xarelto’ to  
Parenteral Anticoagulants 
Give the first dose of the parenteral anticoagulant at the time the next ‘Xarelto’ 
dose would be taken. 
Populations Potentially at Higher Risk 
of Bleeding 
Like all anticoagulants, ‘Xarelto’ may increase the risk of bleeding. 
Therefore, ‘Xarelto’ is contraindicated in patients: 
♦  With active clinically significant bleeding 
♦ 
In adults (for children see ‘Other haemorrhagic risk factors): With a lesion 
or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This 
may include current or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of 
malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, 
recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, 
known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, 
vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular 
abnormalities 
♦  Receiving concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants e.g. 
unfractionated heparin (UFH), LMWHs (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), 
heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral anticoagulants (warfarin, 
dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, etc.) except under the circumstances of 
switching anticoagulant therapy or when UFH is given at doses necessary 
to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter 
22 
 
♦  With hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant 
bleeding risk including Child-Pugh class B and C cirrhotic patients. 
o 
In children‘Xarelto’ is contraindicated based on the data 
obtained in adults as no clinical data is available in children 
with hepatic impairment.  
The risk of bleeding increases with increasing age. 
Several subgroups of patients are at increased risk and should be carefully 
monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications. 
Treatment decision in these patients should be carried out after assessment of 
treatment benefit against the risk for bleeding. 
Patients with renal impairment 
For adults see dosing recommendations for patients with moderate (CrCl 30–49 
ml/min) or severe (CrCl 15–29 ml/min) renal impairment. Xarelto® is to be used 
with caution in patients with CrCl 15–29 ml/min and in patients with renal 
impairment* concomitantly receiving other medicinal products, which increase 
rivaroxaban plasma concentrations. Use of ‘Xarelto’ is not recommended in 
patients with CrCl <15 ml/min. 
In children ≥1 year no dose adjustment is required with mild renal impairment 
(glomerular filtration rate: 50 - ≤80 mL/min/1.73 m2. ‘Xarelto’ is not 
recommended in children ≥1 year with moderate or severe renal impairment 
(glomerular filtration rate <50 mL/ min / 1.73 m2). 
‘Xarelto’ is not recommended in children <1 year with serum creatinine results 
above 97.5th percentile, as no clinical data is available (see SmPC Granules for 
oral suspension for reference values). 
Patients concomitantly receiving other medicinal products 
♦  Systemic azole-antimycotics (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
voriconazole and posaconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir):  
use of ‘Xarelto’ is not recommended 
♦  Care is to be taken in patients concomitantly receiving drugs affecting 
haemostasis such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 
ASA, platelet aggregation inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  
♦  ACS patients and CAD/PAD patients: Patients on treatment with ‘Xarelto’ 
and ASA or with ‘Xarelto’ and ASA plus clopidogrel/ticlopidine should only 
receive concomitant treatment with NSAIDs if the benefit outweighs the 
bleeding risk 
♦  The interaction with erythromycin, clarithromycin or fluconazole is likely not 
clinically relevant in most patients but can be potentially significant in high-
risk patients (For patients with renal impairment see further above) 
23 
 
Children  
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The extent of 
interactions in the pediatric population is not known. The warnings above should 
be taken into account for the pediatric population.                                                                                                                                                                  
Patients with other haemorrhagic risk factors 
As with other antithrombotics, Xarelto® is not recommended in patients with an 
increased bleeding risk such as: 
In adults: 
♦  Congenital or acquired bleeding disorders 
♦  Uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension 
♦  Other gastrointestinal disease without active ulceration that can potentially 
lead to bleeding complications (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, 
oesophagitis, gastritis and gastroesophageal reflux disease) 
♦  Vascular retinopathy 
♦  Bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding 
In children: 
♦  Congenital or acquired bleeding disorders 
♦  Uncontrolled arterial hypertension  
♦  Recent gastrointestinal ulcerations 
♦  Active ulcerative gastrointestinal disease 
♦  Recent gastrointestinal ulcerations 
♦  Vascular retinopathy 
♦  Recent intracranial or intracerebral hemorrhage 
♦ 
Intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities 
♦  Recent brain, spinal or ophthalmological surgery 
♦  Bronchiectasis or history of pulmonary bleeding 
Other Contraindications 
‘Xarelto’ is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Women of  
child-bearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with 
24 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                           
‘Xarelto’. ‘Xarelto’ is also contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity to the active 
substance or to any of the excipients. 
Overdose 
Due to limited absorption, a ceiling effect with no further increase in average 
plasma exposure is expected at supratherapeutic doses of 50 mg ‘Xarelto’ and 
above in adults, however, no data is available at supratherapeutic doses in 
children. A decrease in the relative bioavailability for increasing doses (in mg/kg 
bodyweight) was found, suggesting absorption limitations for higher doses, 
even when taken together with food in children. A specific reversal agent 
antagonizing the pharmacodynamic effect of rivaroxaban is available (refer to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics of andexanet alfa), however, it is not 
established in children. The use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in 
case of overdose may be considered. 
Should a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving ‘Xarelto’, the next 
‘Xarelto’ administration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued 
as appropriate. Individualised bleeding management may include: 
♦  Symptomatic treatment, such as mechanical compression, surgical 
intervention, fluid replacement 
♦  Haemodynamic support, blood product or component transfusion 
♦ 
If bleeding cannot be controlled with the above measures, either the 
administration of a specific factor Xa inhibitor reversal agent (andexanet 
alfa) or a specific procoagulant reversal agent, such as prothrombin 
complex concentrate (PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate 
(APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa) should be considered. 
However, there is currently very limited clinical experience with the use of 
these medicinal products in adults and in children receiving ‘Xarelto’ 
Due to the high plasma protein binding, ‘Xarelto’ is not expected to be 
dialysable. 
Coagulation Testing 
Xarelto® does not require routine coagulation monitoring. However, measuring 
‘Xarelto’ levels may be useful in exceptional situations where knowledge of 
‘Xarelto’ exposure may help to take clinical decisions, e.g. overdose and 
emergency surgery. 
Anti-FXa assays with ‘Xarelto’ specific calibrators to measure rivaroxaban levels 
are commercially available. If clinically indicated haemostatic status can also be 
assessed by Prothrombin Time (PT) using Neoplastin as described in the 
SmPC. 
25 
 
 
The following coagulation tests are increased: PT, activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT) and calculated PT INR. Since the INR was 
developed to assess the effects of VKAs on the PT, it is therefore not 
appropriate to use the INR to measure activity of ‘Xarelto’. 
Dosing or treatment decisions should not be based on results of INR except 
when converting from ‘Xarelto’ to VKA as described above. 
 This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will 
allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See 
section 4.8 of the SmPC for how to report adverse events.

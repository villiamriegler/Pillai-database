1.  Background information on the annual renewal 
The European Commission issued on 6 January 2021, a conditional marketing authorisation (cMA) for 
Spikevax (also known as mRNA-1273). This implied that, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 and Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) has to complete ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, as listed in Annex II.E of the marketing 
authorisation, the so-called Specific Obligations (SOBs). These data form the basis of the renewal of the cMA. 
A cMA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH). Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the MAH Moderna Biotech Spain, S.L., submitted to the Agency on 1 July 2021 
an application for renewal of the cMA for Spikevax. The expiry date of the cMA is 6 January 2022. 
The period covered by this annual renewal is 6 January 2021 to 5 June 2021.

Description 
SOB 001 
SOB 002 
SOB 003 
In order to complete the characterisation of the active substance and 
finished product manufacturing processes, the MAH should provide 
additional data. 
In order to confirm the consistency of the active substance and 
finished product manufacturing process (Initial and final scales), the 
MAH should provide additional comparability and validation data. 
In order to ensure consistent product quality, the MAH should 
provide additional information on stability of the active 
substance and finished product and review the active substance and 
finished product specifications following further manufacturing 
experience.  
Due date 
January 2021 
April 2021 
Interim reports will 
be provided monthly 
prior to this date. 
June 2021 
SOB 010 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 Vaccine 
Moderna, the MAH should submit the final Clinical Study Report for 
the randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study mRNA-
1273-P301. 
December 2022 
Since the granting of the cMA, several aspects of all three quality SOBs were covered, however all SOBs are 
only partially fulfilled at the time point of the present assessment report. The clinical SOB pertaining to study 
1273-P301 remains outstanding as per the official due date. The following report provides a detailed update 
on the status of the fulfilment of specific obligations and a discussion on any other data received during the 
reporting period with a potential impact on the benefit risk balance.

2.2.  Outstanding Specific Obligations – Status report for period covered 
During the reporting period, the quality specific obligations were modified, as some aspects were fulfilled, 
whilst variations introducing new supply chains led to the addition of additional requirements. The existing 
clinical obligation, to provide the final clinical study report (CSR) from the pivotal study mRNA-1273-P301 
remains unchanged. A new clinical specific obligation was introduced during the reporting period in the 
context of the extension of indication in adolescents aged 12 or older, namely providing the final CSR for the 
clinical trial mRNA-1273-P203, which initial results supported this extension. The following table provides a 
full overview of the status of fulfilment for all specific obligations.

003 are partially fulfilled. The due dates of some SOBs were extended upon the MAH’s request or because 
additional data was requested by the CHMP as part of some quality variation applications. The update of the 
due dates for some of the SOBs is being implemented in Annex II as part of this renewal procedure. 
The due dates for SOB 001 and SOB 003 are 31 July and 15 July 2021, respectively. The applicant submitted 
a variation and several post-authorisation measures to provide the additional data requested. The evaluation 
of these submissions is still ongoing.  
With regard to SOB 010, the MAH has locked the database of the mRNA-1273-P301 study and is preparing a 
clinical study report containing data from the blinded (Part A) and unblinded (Part B) of the study with 
anticipated submission to EMA by 30 October 2021. The study is ongoing with all participants now in the 
unblinded cross over phase of the study. 
The final clinical study report, as required in the cMA’s list of SOBs, including the unblinded safety and long-
term efficacy analysis through two years of follow up remains on track for submission by the due date of 31 
December 2022. 
Following approval of the paediatric extension of indication procedure II/021, SOB 040 was added, requesting 
the MAH to submit the final clinical study report of the paediatric study mRNA-1273-P203 including the full 
bioanalytical report, by September 2022.  
3.  Additional scientific data provided relevant for the assessment 
of the benefit/risk balance 
3.1.  Quality 
For several of the remaining Quality SOBs the due date was July 2021 and multiple variation applications are 
currently under assessment. Fulfilment of the remaining SOBs is expected. 
3.2.  Clinical efficacy 
The MAH has submitted data to support an extension of the age indication for vaccination with mRNA-1273 in 
children 12 to <18 years of age based on a primary analysis of results obtained in study P203. The analysis 
was based on a data snapshot of 8 May 2021. The respective variation (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021) was submitted on 5 June 2021 and approved in the EU on 23 July 2021. The 
SOB 040 to submit the final CSR of the paediatric trial was agreed in the context of this procedure: 
• 
The final clinical study report for study mRNA-1273-P203 including the full bioanalytical report will be 
submitted no later than September 2022 and is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the 
marketing authorisation. This will provide long-term data.

3.3.  Clinical safety 
Within the current application for cMA renewal, the MAH has not provided any new safety data. 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new safety data have emerged and have been assessed in 
procedures summarised below. Also, additional safety assessments based on the data emerged since the DLP 
have been conducted or are still ongoing as summarised below: 
Since the initial marketing authorisation on 6 January 2021 in the EU, the first PSUR was submitted on 26 
August 2021; its assessment is currently ongoing. 
Since the initial marketing authorisation, a total of seven monthly safety summary reports (MSSR) have been 
submitted and assessed. The below list summarises a review period and procedure number for each MSSR:  
1st MSSR: EMEA/H/C/005791/MEA/011 (reporting period 18 December 2020 - 17 January 2021) 
2nd MSSR: EMEA/H/C/005791/MEA/011.1 (reporting period 18 January - 17 February 2021) 
3rd MSSR: EMEA/H/C/005791/MEA/011.2 (reporting period 18 February - 31 March 2021) 
4th MSSR: EMEA/H/C/005791/MEA/011.3 (reporting period 01-30 April 2021) 
5th MSSR: EMEA/H/C/005791/MEA/011.4 (reporting period 01-31 May 2021) 
6th MSSR: EMEA/H/C/005791/MEA/011.5 (reporting period 01-30 June 2021) 
7th MSSR: EMEA/H/C/005791/MEA/011.6 (reporting period 01-31 July 2021) 
The next MSSR (8th MSSR) is due on 15th September 2021 (reporting period 01-31 August 2021). Safety 
topics evaluated in the MSSRs as well as a resulting variation are detailed below.  
Since the initial marketing authorisation, the following additional post-authorisation measure has been 
submitted: 
EMEA/H/C/005791/LEG/002: 
• 
Following the cluster of 7 cases reporting allergic reactions in California US 12-13 January 2021 
associated with lot 041L20A, the MAH was requested to provide information on the investigation of a 
possible lot-related issue. Based on the information provided by the MAH, no further safety action 
was taken, as quality of Lot # 041L20A was considered consistent with previous mRNA-1273 vaccine 
lots, and no significant new safety information was identified from the cases. 
Since the initial marketing authorisation, the following safety variations have been submitted: 
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0015/G (ongoing): 
•  Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to provide additional safety information regarding hypersensitivity 
and anaphylaxis, as requested by the PRAC in the 2nd MSSR and update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to 
include ‘Delayed injection site reaction’ as an adverse reaction, as requested by the PRAC in the 3rd 
MSSR 
Since the initial marketing authorisation, the PRAC has initiated the following signal assessments: 
Immune thrombocytopenia EPITT no:19679:  
CHMP assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/395728/2021 
Page 15/23 
 
 
 
• 
The PRAC concluded that the evidence assessed to date is not considered strong enough to establish 
a causal association between immune thrombocytopenia and the administration of COVID-19 vaccine 
Spikevax. Immune thrombocytopenia will be continuously monitored in future PSURs. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis EPITT no: 19713 (ongoing): 
•  A causal association between COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside-modified) Spikevax and 
myocarditis/pericarditis is considered of at least a reasonable possibility. Myocarditis and pericarditis 
have been included in the EU product information 4.4 and 4.8 including PL. The PRAC considered also 
that myocarditis and pericarditis are important identified risks in the RMP. RMP update is ongoing in a 
separate procedure (EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0028). Direct healthcare professional communication 
(DHPC) has been distributed 19 July 2021. 
Erythema multiforme EPITT no: 19720 (ongoing): 
• 
The PRAC has agreed that the MAH for Spikevax (Moderna) should provide a cumulative review of 
erythema multiforme by 27 August 2021. 
Glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome EPITT no: 19724 (ongoing): 
• 
The PRAC has agreed that the MAH for Spikevax (Moderna) should provide a cumulative review of 
glomerulonephritis/nephrotic syndrome by 27 August 2021. 
In addition, the following adverse reactions have been added in the EU product information following the 
extension of the indication to individuals 12 years and older (EMEA/H/C/005791/II/021): 
•  Delayed injection site reactions (frequency ‘common’) 
•  Hypoaesthesia (frequency ‘rare’) 
•  Dizziness (frequency ‘uncommon’) 
Evaluations of the following safety topics are currently ongoing and MAH’s analyses are expected in the next 
MSSR and/or in the first PSUR: 
•  Serious hypertension/hypertensive crisis (PSUR) 
• 
• 
Thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (MSSR/PSUR) 
Exacerbation of disease in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders/ autoimmune 
conditions aggravated (PSUR) 
•  Blindness (MSSR/PSUR) 
•  Reactogenicity in subjects previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (PSUR) 
• 
Extensive swelling of vaccinated limb (PSUR) 
•  Hypoaesthesia/Paraesthesia (PSUR) 
• 
Immune thrombocytopenia (PSUR)  
•  Cardiac deaths including sudden deaths with focus on younger adults (MSSR)  
•  Capillary leak syndrome (MSSR) 
•  Rhabdomyolysis (MSSR)

3.4.  Pharmacovigilance inspections 
A joint EMA/Heath Canada PV inspection (INS/PHV/2021/004) was conducted from 21 June to 2 July 2021. 
The final outcome of the inspection is not yet available at the time of this report. 
4.  Risk management plan 
The RMP v2.0 has been submitted within procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0022 to include clinical safety 
data from study mRNA-1273-P203 (NCT04649151) in relevant sections of the RMP and is currently under 
assessment.  
In addition, since the DLP of this annual renewal, the RMP v2.1 has been submitted within procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0028 to include the important identified risks myocarditis and pericarditis in the RMP 
and is also currently under assessment. 
5.  Changes to the Product Information 
The Annex II, specifically the due dates of specific obligations, was updated as a consequence of this annual 
renewal (see Attachment 1). 
Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Spikevax (COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-
modified)) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 
January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU and it is approved under a 
conditional marketing authorisation. 
The summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet therefore includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

6.  Overall conclusions and benefit-risk balance 
6.1.  Specific Obligations (SOBs) 
Compliance of SOB data submitted 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, data on Quality SOBs 001, 002 and 003 have been 
submitted. All three Quality SOBs are only partially fulfilled so far, however several variations impacting the 
final due date of some SOBs are on-going or extensions to the due date have been requested by the MAH 
and granted. 
The clinical SOBs imposed at the time of the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation as well as at 
the time of the granting of the extension of indication to include adolescents aged 12 years of age or older 
remain outstanding with their due date in the future. 
During  the  period  covered  by  this  annual  renewal  data  on  the  SOBs  have  been  submitted  that  overall  are 
compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines and are compliant in terms of acceptability of data submitted. 
Updated list of specific obligations (SOBs) 
In the framework of a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures:

6.2.  Benefit-risk Balance 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data have emerged. However, these data do not have 
an impact on the established benefit-risk balance of Spikevax in the approved indication. 
The data collected as part of the specific obligations for Spikevax during the period covered by this annual 
renewal support its positive benefit-risk balance in the approved indication.

Favourable effects 
The favourable effects were demonstrated in the initial marketing authorisation for persons 18 years of age 
and older and updated in a type II variation to also include adolescents 12-17 years of age. No additional 
efficacy analyses have been conducted and no additional efficacy data have been submitted during this 
renewal procedure. Interim follow-up safety and immunogenicity persistence data through Day 119 for the 
licensed 100 µg dose from phase 1 trial mRNA-1273-P201 were submitted to cover the initial REC 010 
(assesses as MEA 007). The submitted immunogenicity data indicate that 100 µg of mRNA-1273 
administered with 2 doses separated by 28 days induced robust immune responses with moderate decrease 
of antibodies. No safety concerns were raised after review of submitted data in any of the dosing groups. 
The most important favourable effects are briefly summarised below. 
Efficacy in adults 
Clinical efficacy has been investigated in a placebo-controlled study conducted with about 30,000 participants 
of which about 14,000 received two doses the vaccine 1 month apart. Participants were monitored for a 
median of 92 days for the development of COVID-19 disease. Results are summarised in the table below for 
vaccine efficacy in terms of protection from COVID-19 of any severity starting 14 days post 2nd dose: 
In participants in the primary efficacy analysis population, no cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the 
vaccine group compared with 30 cases reported in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-
19 was thus 100%. 
Efficacy in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
An ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, clinical trial to evaluate the safety, 
reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years was/is conducted in the United 
States. 3,732 participants were randomised 2:1 to receive 2 doses of Spikevax or saline placebo 1 month 
apart. Participants will be followed for efficacy and safety until 1 year after the second dose. The study 
showed that Spikevax produced a comparable antibody response in 12- to 17-year-olds to that seen in young 
adults (aged 18 to 25 years), as measured by the level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, none 
of 2,163 children receiving the vaccine developed COVID-19, compared with four of 1,073 children given a 
dummy injection. These results allowed to conclude that the efficacy of Spikevax in children 12 to 17 years 
old is similar to that in adults.

Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The uncertainties and limitations of favourable effects are the same as for the initial assessment. The 
principal uncertainties relate to the duration of protection and efficacy in risk groups, e.g. pregnant women 
and immunocompromised subjects. Another uncertainty relates to vaccine efficacy against upcoming virus 
variants of concern. In order to comply with the planned additional Pharmacovigilance activity milestone 
included in the Risk Management Plan for Spikevax, the MAH submitted on 25 February 2021 the Protocol for 
a real-world study to evaluate mRNA-127 effectiveness and long-term effectiveness in the US (MEA 009). The 
protocol is currently under review. 
During the renewal procedure, the paediatric extension of indication procedure II/021 was finalised and SOB 
040 to submit the final CSR of the paediatric trial was agreed in the context of this procedure. 
Results from some of the defined endpoints were not provided as the study is still ongoing. While this was 
acceptable at time of approval, as the relevant results supporting the immunobridging were provided, final 
study results should be submitted as soon as available. 
The CHMP considered the following measure necessary to address the missing safety data:  
• 
The final clinical study report for study mRNA-1273-P203 including the full bioanalytical report will be 
submitted no later than September 2022 and is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the 
marketing authorisation. This will provide long-term data. 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile for Spikevax is based on data generated in a placebo-controlled clinical study on 30,351 
participants ≥ 18 years of age, a placebo-controlled clinical study on 3,732adolescents aged 12 to 17 years 
and from post-marketing data. 
Data from clinical study in adults 
Solicited adverse reactions are reported more frequently among vaccine than placebo recipients. The most 
frequently reported adverse reactions after any dose in the vaccine group were pain at the injection site 
(92.0% any grade; 6.1% grade ≥ 3), fatigue (70% any grade; 10.1% grade ≥ 3), headache (64.7% any 
grade; 5.7% grade ≥ 3), myalgia (61.5% any grade; 9.1% grade ≥ 3) and chills (45.4% any grade; 1.4% 
grade ≥ 3). The majority of local and systemic adverse reactions had a median duration of 1 to 3 days. 
Overall, there was a higher reported rate of some adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence of 
axillary swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting, and fever was 
higher in adults aged 18 to < 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above. 
Grade 3 solicited local adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. In 
the participants who received the vaccine, solicited systemic adverse reactions were reported numerically 
more frequently by vaccine participants after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. Grade 3 systemic adverse reactions 
(fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and headache) were reported more frequently after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. 
Unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 28 days following each vaccination were reported by 23.9% 
of participants who received mRNA-1273 and 21.6% of participants who received placebo. Unsolicited AE that 
occurred in ≥ 1% of study participants who received mRNA-1273 and at a rate at least 1.5-fold higher rate 
than placebo, were lymphadenopathy related events (1.1% versus 0.6%) and delayed injection site reactions 
reported >7 days after vaccination (1.2% versus 0.4%). All of the lymphadenopathy events are similar to the 
CHMP assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/395728/2021 
Page 20/23 
 
 
 
axillary swelling/tenderness in the injected arm reported as solicited adverse reactions. Delayed injection site 
reactions included one or more of the following: erythema, pain and swelling, and are likely related to 
vaccination. 
Serious adverse events were reported at the same rates in participants who received mRNA-1273 (0.6%) and 
placebo (0.6%) from the first dose until 28 days following the last vaccination. Serious adverse events were 
reported at the same rates in participants who received mRNA-1273 (1.0%) and placebo (1.0%) from the 
first dose until the last observation. 
Data from clinical study in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age 
In a clinical study, the most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 through 17 years of age were pain 
at the injection site (97.2%), headache (78.4%), fatigue (75.2%), myalgia (54.3%), chills (49.1%), 
arthralgia (34.6%), axillary swelling/tenderness (34.6%), nausea/vomiting (29.3%), swelling at the injection 
site (27.7%), erythema at the injection site (25.8%), and fever (13.7%). 
Post-marketing data 
The product information has been updated since approval as new data has emerged. Since the initial 
approval of the vaccine in EU, the following safety variations have been submitted to EMA: 
•  Safety variation to update the EU SmPC in line with CCDS version 4.0 (from 5 May 2021) to include 
delayed reactions at the site of injection, as well as 30 minutes waiting time postvaccination for people 
considered at increased risk of anaphylaxis. A type II variation was submitted to EMA on 17 May 2021. 
The respective statement has meanwhile been included in the SmPC. 
•  PRAC has initiated a Signal Assessment on immune thrombocytopenia on 8 March 2021 with preliminary 
assessment report from 23 June 2021 A respective warning statement has been included in the SmPC. 
•  Most recently, the PRAC initiated a Signal Assessment on myocarditis and pericarditis on 9 June 2021 
(SDA 033). A respective warning statement has been included in the SmPC. 
Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The principal uncertainties are related to long-term effects, and effects in specific risk groups, e.g. pregnant 
or breast-feeding women, immunocompromised subjects and frail subjects with unstable health conditions, 
co-morbidities or with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. 
Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
The benefits of Spikevax in terms of protection against COVID-19 clearly outweigh the identified risks, and no 
new information has emerged during this renewal period that would necessitate a re-consideration of the 
initially concluded positive risk-benefit-balance. The quality related SOBs are ongoing according to plan. The 
fulfilment of the clinical SOBs is due by 31 December 2022.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Alexion Europe SAS submitted 
to the European Medicines Agency on 17 December 2019 an application for a group of variations. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variations requested

elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of 
studies to the competent authority 
Grouping consisting of the following variations: 
- Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) in 
order to update the clinical information based on the pooled safety and efficacy analysis of already 
submitted studies (Studies LAL-CL04, LAL-CL03, LAL-CL06, LAL-CL08 and LAL-CL02) and updated 
population pharmacokinetic analyses in children and adults. The Package Leaflet has been amended 
accordingly. The RMP version 4 has also been submitted. Annex II is also updated to remove the 
specific obligation related to the provision of study LAL-CL08. 
- Submission of the final report from study LAL-EA01 An open-label study with sebelipase alfa (1 
mg/kg every other week for up to 78 weeks or until drug commercialization) in United States (US) 
patients who did not otherwise qualify for an active sebelipase alfa trial (expanded access protocol) 
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Annex II and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0173/2015 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0173/2015. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The  current  variation  provided  an  integrated  analysis  of  the  clinical  data  from  6  post-authorisation 
studies  as  well  as  the  final  data  from  an  expanded  access  programme  in  the  United  States  (US)  for 
patients not eligible for clinical trial participation. 
Overall  the  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  outcomes  from  both  analyses  did  not  diverge  from  the 
observations  and  conclusion  on  efficacy  and  safety  made  during  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation 
assessment or the analyses of the individual studies that made up the data aggregate of the integrated 
analysis. 
Based on observations in the integrated analysis the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) proposed to 
alter the approved posology to allow dose escalation from 1 mg/kg qow (once every other week) to 3 
mg/kg qow (once weekly) in children and adults in function of clinical response. This proposal was based 
on the fact that in the aggregated data there was a patient year exposure at the dose level of 3 mg/kg 
qow that was equal to about 25% of the total exposure of patients on the standard dose of 1 mg/kg 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 6/200 
 
 
 
  
 
qow. This represents a relatively fairly large exposure to the former dose that was mostly due to non-
optimal responses to the basic dose. Analysis of safety per dose level also did not reveal any difference 
in risk profile, within the confirmative caveats of the limited patient numbers, and as such this change 
to the posology is supported. 
Likewise, the MAH proposed a change to the posology in infants as to allow dose escalation from 1 to 5 
mg/kg qw depending on clinical response. This change is based on observations in the Pooled Safety Set 
2 (studies of infants who developed growth failure or other evidence of a rapidly progressive course of 
LAL-D, ie studies LAL-CL03 and LAL-CL08) where 7 of 19 patients needed escalation to 5 mg/kg qw to 
maintain adequate response (1 patient needed even further escalation to 7.5 mg/kg qw), and for which 
no negative safety impact was noted. This change of posology is difficult to accept based on available 
data solely though, given the very low number of involved patients (7 of 19 total) and the fact that 3 of 
these  were  dual  WGD  (whole  gene  deletion)  patients  which  do  not  fit  the  ‘normal’  phenotype  of  the 
majority of patients in the study and likely have a far worse disease severity. Thus the body of data to 
allow such a posology change is too thin for evidence-based confirmative acceptance. However, it is also 
known that the clinical reality of infants with early-onset lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is such 
that  they  are  generally  more  seriously  burdened  with  more  severe  consequences  and  a  far  higher 
mortality rate. Thus based on the clinical reality it could be acceptable to allow dose escalation in severely 
stricken infants.  
In  response  to  this  concern  the  Applicant  proposed  a  reworded  dosing  guidance  for  LAL-D  infant 
treatment, which establishes clearly when an up titration to 5 mg/kg could take place, but leaves further 
up- or down-titration more open to the threating expert’s insight and the patient’s needs and response 
to  treatment.  Given  the  clinical  reality  that  responses  to  replacement-therapies  are  often  very 
individually bound and that treatment will be initiated by experts in metabolic diseases this more open 
approach to guidance can be accepted. 
Finally, and as already discussed in both the LAL-CL08 assessment and the renewal procedures, three 
patients were uncovered to have a dual WGD in the form of a homozygous deletion affecting both alleles 
of  the  genes  LIPA  and  Cholesterol  25-Hydroxylase.  These  patients  were  characterised  by  a  high 
neutralzing 
immunogenic  response 
that  affected  efficacy,  requiring  dose  escalations  and 
immunomodulatory  treatment/bone  marrow  transplant  (BMT)/hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplant 
(HSCT) to control their disease. Given that a retrospective analysis to discover more potential cases is 
not necessary due to lack of genetic typing data in the other trials, data on this specific type of the LAL-
D syndrome is of such scarcity that any impact, if at all, on the benefit/risk is impossible to determine 
at the moment. A new safety signal was however included in the latest PSUR (Data Lock Point: 28 August 
2019), and thus more data may potentially be forthcoming in the future. 
Regarding  pharmacokinetics  (PK),  a  substantial  number  of  PK  samples  were  disqualified  due  to  data 
integrity issues. The corrective and prevention action plan taken to address this issue has been described. 
In general, this is deemed acceptable in terms of GCP and is expected to prevent a similar problem in 
the future. Furthermore, all issues raised during Health Authority inspections carried out during the same 
periods as Kanuma studies were addressed by the CRO. 
The  population  pharmacokinetic  (POPPK)  model  submitted  in  the  original  marketing  authorisation 
application (MAA) has been updated and incorporated 25% more PK data than in the original regulatory 
application model. A Pop-PK/PD model to provide further information on the relation between plasma 
levels  of  sebelipase  alfa  and  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  outcomes  has  been  developed.  The  population 
pharmacokinetic  and  PK/PD  analyses  have  been  conducted  to  support  the  proposed  posology  and 
pharmacokinetic characteristics of sebelipase alpha in sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC. The data from 
the patients in the lower age subgroups are not considered very informative given the limited number 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 7/200 
 
 
 
  
of patients in the different age subgroups (5 versus 2 versuss 6 in the 3 age subgroups for patients <2, 
2  to  6  and  4  to  <6  years  old,  respectively).  In  addition,  in  the  absence  of  PK  exposure  comparison 
between  the  adults  and  the  different  age  groups,  it  cannot  be  concluded  that  the  POPPK  data  are 
supportive  of  the  recommended  starting  dose.  Regarding  the  PK/PD  modelling  exercise,  it  has  been 
clarified that there has been no attempt to quantitatively characterize the link between the 2 biomarkers 
selected  (ALT  and  LDL-C)  and  the  actual  meaningful  clinical  response.  This  drastically  decreased  the 
value of the PK/PD exercise, which does not have any interest to inform the dose in this context. Given 
the fact that the dose is intended to be adjusted based on clinical benefit-risk assessment, this issue is 
not pursued. 
Overall, the results of the integrated analysis of the studies and the US Extended Access programme 
data did not raise any new issues in regards to safety nor efficacy. All the relevant paediatric data have 
been reflected in the Product Information of Kanuma. 
The benefit-risk balance of Kanuma remains positive.

Annex: Rapporteur’s assessment comments on the type II 
variation 
1.  Introduction 
Sebelipase alfa is a recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase (rhLAL) enzyme, purified from egg white 
of transgenic chicken (Gallus gallus), with the same amino acid sequence as the native human enzyme. 
Purified sebelipase alfa is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 55 kD with 6 N-linked 
glycosylation  sites.  Structural  and  compositional  analyses  demonstrate  that  sebelipase  alfa  glycans 
consist of predominately N-acetylglucosamine and mannose terminated N-linked structures, which target 
proteins  to  the  macrophage  mannose  receptors  (MMR;  also  known  as  N-acetylglucosamine/mannose 
receptors), as well as mannose 6 phosphate (M6P) moieties, which target proteins to the M6P receptors. 
These glycans target uptake via receptors expressed on a number of cell types, including Kupffer cells 
and hepatocytes, in which substrate accumulation leads to disease pathogenesis. The described N-glycan 
structures  are  common  to  those  found  in  human  proteins  and  have  been  shown  to  facilitate  protein 
uptake into cells via the macrophage MMR or M6P receptors. 
Sebelipase alfa has been developed for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients of all 
ages with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D). LAL-D is an ultra-rare and life-threatening autosomal 
recessive monogenic disorder caused by a marked decrease in LAL activity. Lysosomal acid lipase plays 
a key role in the metabolism and degradation of lipids, predominantly cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, 
and  the  marked  reduction  or  absence  of  its  activity  in  patients  with  LAL-D  leads  to  lysosomal 
accumulation of these lipids in various tissues and cell types throughout the body. As with the native 
enzyme, sebelipase alfa catalyzes the lysosomal hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides to free 
cholesterol, glycerol, and free fatty acids in the lysosomes of target cells. Sebelipase alfa is intended to 
directly address the root cause of disease by replacing the missing or deficient enzyme, thereby resulting 
in reduction of the accumulated substrates and restoration of normal lipid metabolism. 
Although LAL-D is a single disease, patients present and progress along a phenotypic continuum similar 
to other lysosomal storage disorders and inborn errors of metabolism. For LAL-D, this disease spectrum 
ranges from a presentation in infants that is rapidly progressive (historically called Wolman disease) to 
a  presentation  that  manifests  clinically  in  childhood,  adolescence,  or,  less  frequently,  in  adulthood  in 
which the rate of disease progression is more variable (historically referred to as cholesterol ester storage 
disease). Irrespective of where a patient is on the disease spectrum, LAL-D is associated with significant 
burden of disease and a shortened life expectancy. 
Sebelipase alfa drug product is supplied as a sterile concentrate for intravenous (IV) infusion (single-use 
vial)  and  should  be  diluted in  0.9%  sodium  chloride  injection  before  administration.  According  to  the 
MAH, the sebelipase alfa formulation used in clinical studies is the formulation that was initially proposed 
and  was  subsequently  approved  for  marketing;  therefore,  no  biopharmaceutic  bridging  studies  were 
conducted. Some changes were made to the drug substance manufacturing process during development. 
No  significant  changes  have  been  made  to  the  overall  process  since  initiation  of  pivotal  clinical 
development,  although  some  additional  controls  and  process  optimization  were  implemented  for  the 
current commercial process. These process changes were developed and implemented to ensure batch-
to-batch consistency of the quality, safety, and potency of the drug substance, as well as to augment 
viral reduction capacity of the purification process.

Sebelipase alfa was approved in the European Union (EU) on 28 Aug 2015 for long-term ERT in patients 
of  all  ages  with  LAL-D.  At  MAA,  it  was  recommended  that  the  Sponsor  provide  final  sample  analysis 
reports upon completion of the Studies LAL-CL02, LAL-CL03, LAL-CL04, LAL-CL06 and LAL-CL08, provide 
an  update  of  the  population  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  model,  and  develop  a  PK/pharmacodynamic  (PD) 
model  to  explore  the  impact  of  weight
based  dosing  on  PD  biomarkers.  Additionally,  during  the 
assessment of the sebelipase alfa periodic safety update report #3 (covering the reporting period from 
29 Aug 2016 to 28 Feb 2017), the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) recommended 
‑
inclusion of quantitative data in the sebelipase alfa product information (including the actual number of 
patients experiencing anti-drug antibodies [ADAs] and IARs) at time of finalization of ongoing/planned 
studies (EMA/PRAC/625005/2017). 
The MAH proposes to change the sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the EU SmPC 
in  order  to  update  clinical  information  based  on  the  pooled  safety  and  efficacy  analysis  of  completed 
studies LAL-CL04, LAL-CL03, LAL-CL06, LAL-CL08 and LAL-CL02 (results from 19 infants, 69 children < 
2 to >18 years of age and 37 adults) and updated population pharmacokinetic analyses in children and 
adults. The Package Leaflet has been amended accordingly. These changes are proposed in alignment 
with the Company Core Data Sheet (CCDS) version 3.0 dated 26 Nov 2019. The RMP version 4.0 has 
also been submitted. 
Of note, due to data integrity and long-term stability issues identified following approval, some of the 
data  from  the  original  regulatory  application  were  excluded  from  the  new  Pop-PK  analyses.  Despite 
exclusion  of  these  data,  the  new  (final)  Pop-PK  model  incorporated  25%  more  PK  data  than  did  the 
original model. 
The  Pop-PK/pharmacodynamic  (PD)  models  developed  for  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  and  LDL-C 
per EMA request was also submitted. 
Additionally, 6 patients with LAL-D received sebelipase alfa in completed Study LAL-EA01, an expanded 
access protocol implemented in the US. Patients who were enrolled under this protocol did not meet the 
entry criteria for any of the other studies in the sebelipase alfa clinical program. The pooled analyses did 
not include data from Study LAL-EA01, and as such, the results of this study are not included in the label 
update  proposal.  A  narrative  for  this  study  is  provided  and the  Final  CSR  is  submitted  in  the  present 
application. 
2.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
2.1.1.  Study design 
The  clinical  studies  supporting  the  clinical pharmacology  of  sebelipase  alfa  in  patients  with LAL-D  are 
summarized in the table below. The primary clinical pharmacology data in support of sebelipase alfa for 
the  long-term  treatment  of  patients  with  LAL-D  are  derived  from  the  6  completed  clinical  studies, 
including 2 studies conducted in infants (Study LAL-CL03 and Study LAL-CL08), 2 studies conducted in 
children and adults (Study LAL-CL02 and Study LAL-CL06), and Study LAL-CL01 and its extension, Study 
LAL-CL04, conducted in adults.

A POPPK analysis using data from 75 patients included in studies LAL-CL06, LAL-CL04, LAL-CL02 and 
LAL-CL03 was carried out. Some PK data from the original submission were excluded from the Pop-PK 
analyses due to a data integrity issue (DII) and some samples having been analyzed beyond the long-
term stability of the assay. This impacted all PK samples from Study LAL-CL01. In addition, PK and PD 
data from study LAL-CL08 were not included due to errors in dosing records.  
Furthermore, a Pop-PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) model to link plasma levels of sebelipase alfa with PD 
outcomes, ie, changes from baseline in ALT concentrations and in LDL-C concentrations was developed. 
Use the Pop-PK/PD model to explore the impact of body weight-based dosing on PD parameters.

The objectives of the Population PK Analysis and the PK-PD analysis using data from studies LAL-CL06, LAL-CL04, LAL-CL02 and LAL-CL03 were: 
1. Following addition of new clinical data, develop a new Pop-PK model and assess the impact of the following: 
a. Body size on PK parameters. 
b. Age and enzyme maturation on PK parameters. 
c. BLQ data on the Pop-PK model to potentially under predict low concentrations, using multiple imputation methods. 
d. Infusion rate and duration on PK parameters, using a sensitivity analysis. 
e. Under-exposing infants and younger children when using body weight-based dosing on PK parameters. 
2. Develop a Pop-PK/PD model to provide further information on the relation between plasma levels of sebelipase alfa and PD outcomes, i.e., changes from 
baseline in ALT concentrations and in LDL-C concentrations. Use the Pop-PK/PD model to explore the impact of body weight-based dosing on PD parameters.

2.1.2.  Bioanalytical method 
Sebelipase alfa serum concentration data were analyzed by CRO using a validated bioanalytical method. 
The same method ELISA-0558, an enzyme activity-based assay, has been used in the analysis of samples 
from all studies during the clinical development of sebelipase alfa. The range of quantification for the 
method  is  3.125  to  100  ng/mL.  However,  a  data  integrity  issue  (DII)  occurred,  which  led  to  the 
disqualification of some results. In brief, the DII involved the overwriting of original raw instrument data 
for  multiple  analytical  runs.  Investigation  into  the  data  overwrites  revealed  the  collection  of  raw 
instrument data multiple times per individual analytical run. Original raw instrument data were erased 
in this process and, therefore, were unavailable for evaluation or study reconstruction. No documentation 
was generated to describe these actions, and no cause for the actions could be determined. For these 
reasons, the data generated in these analytical runs were invalidated by Alexion. At the time of data 
disqualification these samples were beyond the validated long-term storage stability and could not be 
reanalyzed and were, therefore, unreportable. In addition, there was insufficient long-term stability to 
cover storage periods of some samples. 
The scope of impacted samples across the clinical studies of sebelipase alfa for the treatment of LAL-D 
due to the DII or long-term stability issue is presented in the table below.

Issues 
Assessment  of  the  responses  to  the  1st  request  for  supplementary  information  in  procedure 
EMA/H/C/4004/P46 08 and related to the bioanalytical method used to quantify sebelipase alpha:  
Question 1 
As recommended by the CHMP at time of the MA grant, the final report of the parallelism study should 
be submitted to complete the current validation report of the method for the determination of sebelipase 
in human serum using enzymatic activity assay (Method No. ELISA-0558) and the Applicant is asked to 
discuss this aspect in particular for the infant population included in the study LAL-CL08. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Parallelism evaluations performed at the time of the original Marketing Authorization were carried out 
using samples from Studies LAL-CL02, LAL-CL03 and LAL-CL04 (LAL-CL01). Samples were grouped by 
patient age categories as follows: Group 1 (1-12 years old), Group 2 (> 12-18 years old) and Group 3 
(>  18  years  old).  Corresponding  parallelism  results (8285-709  Final  Validation  Report  Addendum  1 – 
see below) demonstrate the absence of a significant matrix effect in the general patient population with

lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D), suggesting that the bioanalytical assay would also be tolerant 
to matrix from patients < 1 year of age. Patients < 1 year of age do exhibit the most severe forms of 
LAL-D, defined by significant heterogeneity in disease manifestation which leads to a large variability of 
patient  blood  chemistry  (Jones,  et  al.  Orphanet  Journal  of  Rare  Diseases,  2017,  12:25).  Due  to  this 
variability,  it  is  difficult  to  generally  speculate  if  the  assessment  of  parallelism  would  be  different  for 
patients < 1 year of age. Ten patients < 1 year old have been included in Study LAL-CL08. No samples 
from patients aged < 1 year old who were enrolled in Study LAL-CL08 remain within validated storage 
stability. No other samples from patients < 1 year old who were enrolled in sebelipase alfa clinical studies 
are available within validated stability. Therefore, the assessment is not feasible at this time.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
As requested, the final results of the parallelism study for the method for the determination of 
sebelipase in human serum using enzymatic activity assay (Method No. ELISA-0558) were provided by 
the MAH. According to the addendum 1 of the validation report 8285-709, parallelism for this study 
was tested in both pediatric and adult populations using study samples from LAL-CL02, LAL-CL03 and 
LAL-CL01/LAL-CL04. Clinical samples were identified from three age groups (1-12, >12-18, and >18 
years) and confirmed as ADA negative. Of note, an additional age group (<1 years) was initially 
identified for the parallelism study however due to there being no patient samples (due to blood 
volume limitations and sparse sampling in the clinical studies) in this age group it was removed from 
the study analysis. A total of 3 study samples of similar PK concentration were mixed together to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 19/200 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
create a pool in each age group. A total of 3 separate pools will be created for testing each age group 
resulting in a total of 9 pools. Each pool was diluted using 2 fold dilutions in 33.3% human serum 
diluent, after minimum required dilution (MRD) at 1/3 dilution in Assay Buffer, imitating study sample 
dilutions. At least 1 dilution will be >ULOQ dilution will be <LLOQ, and at least 3 dilutions will fall 
within the range of the assay. The Guideline on bioanalytical methods (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 
Rev. 1 Corr. 2**) recommends the use of study sample instead of pooled samples. Since 3 
independently pooled samples using 3 individual patient samples per pool and the %CV results were 
found to be ≤ 12.4 %, the parallelism of the method is deemed sufficiently demonstrated.  
Regarding the patients aged < 1 years old, uncertainties on the impact of the patient matrix on the PK 
assay remain based on the current data. But no samples within validated sample stability remain 
available. Therefore, the MAH cannot conduct further assessment of the parallelism of the bioanalytical 
method. But taking into account the acceptable ISR results from studies LAL-CL03 and LAL-CL08 
including infants analysis with a pass rate of 78% for reportable PK samples (11/14; i.e. 29.8% 
(14/47) of the total number of samples with reportable results for both studies - see before) and the 
orphan status of the disease and the unmet medical need of the disease, this issue is not pursued.

Not pursued 
Question 2 
The validation data supporting the long-term stability range of 507 days for sebelipase alpha should be 
provided. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The  long-term  storage  stability  of  Kanuma  in  serum  up  to  507  days  has  been  documented  in  an 
addendum to the validation report (8285-709 Final Validation Report Addendum 1). In 2 independent 
analyses  2/3  of  long-term  stability  quality  control  samples  at  each  level  met  acceptance  criteria  as 
presented in Table 1.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided the requested validation results to support the long-term stability of the collected 
samples (the addendum 1 of the 8285-709 Final Validation Report). The following acceptance criteria 
were described in the method validation protocol provided at MAA submission (study number 8285-709): 
stability is acceptable if the measured concentrations of the analyte in ≥ 67% of all stability samples, 
with ≥ 50% at each level, meet the following criteria: accuracy (expressed as % Bias): ± 25% ; precision 
(expressed as %CV): CV≤20%. The Applicant has reported that the stability was proven acceptable for 
up  to  507  days  at  -60ºC  to  -80ºC  temperature  (Study  Number  8285-709,  Method  Validation  Report 
Addendum No. 1). The acceptance criteria selected by the Applicant were not in line with the current 
principles of the EMA Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 
1 Corr. 2**) expecting that the mean concentration of QC samples at each level should be within up to 
±20%  of  the  nominal  concentration.  However,  as  the  wider  acceptance  criteria  were  prospectively 
defined and were met, this issue is not pursued.

Overall Rapporteur’s comments on bioanalytical method and study sample analysis 
All the samples were analysed with the same bioanalytical method and by the same central laboratory 
as in the original dossier at MAA submission. 
A  number  of  issues  were  raised  regarding  the  bioanalytical  method  used  for  the  determination  of 
sebelipase  alpha  in  serum  for  PK  analysis  at  MAA  submission  regarding  the  specificity,  selectivity  in 
lipaemic serum samples and higher variability than usually accepted. Further data were provided on the

parallelism  of 
the  method 
in 
the  post-approval  procedures  EMEA/H/C/004004/II/0019, 
EMA/H/C/4004/P46  05  and  EMA/H/C/4004/P46  06.  It  was  deemed  sufficiently  demonstrated  for  all 
groups of age except for the patients aged < 1 year old for whose uncertainties remain since no sample 
within validated storage stability remained for further analysis. Further validation data supporting the 
long-term stability range of 18 months for sebelipase alpha were also provided post-approval. Acceptable 
demonstration for longer periods of storage has failed (3 years and 2 months at -70°C, validation report 
8285-709-AM2). However, the final  ISR analysis across all six studies (CL01, CL02, CL03, CL04, CL06, 
and CL08) passed with an average pass rate of 85.7% (total 167 samples; data reported in procedure 
EMA/H/C/4004/P46 05, bioanalytical report 8308-665) based on predefined acceptance criteria (results 
within  +/-  30%  differences  to  their  respective  primary  results).  The  updated  overall  ISR  pass  rate  is 
4+16+62+28+7/4+22+76+30+10 (CL03, CL06, CL02, CL04, CL08 – all PK study samples from study 
CL01  are  non-reportable)  =  117/142  =  82.4%,  which  is  acceptable.  The  number  of  samples  with 
reportable  results  tested  in  ISR  represents  12.4%  (142/1143)  of  the  total  number  of  samples  with 
reportable results across the 6 clinical studies. If the studies including infants are taken separately (LAL-
CL03 and LAL-CL08), a pass rate of 78% (11/14) was observed for ISR (taking only in account the PK 
samples with reportable results). This represents 29.8% (14/47) of the total number of PK samples with 
reportable results.  
Overall,  it  is  concluded  that  the  pending  bioanalytical  issues  regarding  the  specificity,  selectivity  in 
lipeamic serum, the higher variability than commonly accepted and missing parallelism data for patients 
aged < 1 year old would not have an impact on the positive benefit/risk balance for children of > 4 years 
old (see Rapporteur’s comment section 6.2.6 for children of lowest age groups) taking into account the 
following points: 
- the overall ISR analysis for reportable PK samples and additional parallelism data showed acceptable 
results; 
- the orphan status of the disease and the unmet medical need of the disease. 
Regarding  the  study  sample  analysis,  it  is  observed  that  at  least  287  samples  from  4  clinical  studies 
(studies LAL-CL02, LAL-CL03, LAL-CL06 and LAL-CL08) were impacted by data integrity issues, i.e. 19% 
of the total number of samples for these 4 studies (287/1510) or 14% out of all PK samples collected in 
the six clinical studies with PK sampling (287/2122). The sponsor proposes to report these results as 
‘non  reportable’.  The  disqualification  of  this  substantial  number  of  results  raises  concerns  about  the 
validity  of  the  entire  set  of  PK  data  reported  and  may  warrant  an  inspection. The  MAH  is  required to 
justify that the conclusions drawn on the pharmacokinetics of sebelipase can be considered reliable. 
In total 979 study samples have presented a non-reportable result for a total of 2122 PK samples (49%). 
This represents a substantial number of samples. But the MAH has emphasized that the final population 
PK model incorporated 25% more PK data than in the original regulatory application model, i.e. the final 
POPPK  model  was  conducted  on  714  samples  (on  880  considered  PK  samples)  compared  with  570 
samples in the original regulatory application. The reasons for not including 116 reportable samples in 
the  POPPK  analysis  were:  pre-  or  post-dose  blank,  a  measurable  concentration  before  the  first  dose, 
TAD>10 and not BLQ, missing sampling time and amount of previous dose imputed (table 4 and table 
10.1.4.  PK/PD  modelling  and  simulation  report).  The  MAH  is  requested  to  clarify  why  a  total  of  1122 
study samples with reportable results (as calculated based on Table 5 Module 2.7.1 and excluding the 
samples excluded from LAL-CL01 due to data integrity issues and from study LAL-CL08 due to errors in 
dosing records) has not been considered for inclusion in the POPPK analysis. In addition, the exclusion 
criteria ‘TAD>10’ should be clarified.

Only the valid data should be included in the POPPK model, but it essential that all available and valid 
data be included in the analysis dataset unless adequately justified. 
2.1.3.  PK parameters 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  sebelipase  alfa  in  serum  were  assessed  using  non-compartmental 
analysis for some individual studies : LAL-CL04 and LAL-CL06. Serum sebelipase alfa concentrations for 
samples with reportable values were determined for all studies.  
A  Pop-PK  model-based  analysis  of  pooled  data  was  conducted.  The  final  analyses  were  conducted  on 
pooled PK and ADA data from the 6 studies described above. All PK and PD observations with missing 
dose records were removed as justified. Missing values for a baseline covariate were amended using a 
single imputation approach whereby the missing value was substituted by an imputed value as follows: 
- 
- 
For continuous covariates, the median study-specific value from all patients was used. 
For categorical covariates, the mode of the observed values, possibly after stratifying on other 
observed covariates (eg, sex and study), was used. 
The imputed values were used only for fitting the model and are not presented in tables or summaries. 
Where  the  proportion  of  missing  values  was  high  (ie,  >  15%),  the  covariate  was  dropped  from  the 
analysis altogether. 
A  Pop-PK  analysis  was  previously  performed  for  the  original  regulatory  application  using  a  1-
compartment model-based on data collected from 49 patients in 4 ongoing clinical studies. The input 
was originally described by a complex dual-input model to allow for variability in infusion rate during the 
recorded  infusion  time  due  to  the  flush.  The  model  in  the  original  regulatory  application  (hereafter 
referred  to  as  the  original  Pop-PK  model)  included  the  effect  of  body  surface  area  (BSA)  on  CL  and 
volume of distribution in the central compartment (Vc). In addition, the model included the effect of dose 
(≥ 3 mg/kg) on CL and Vc as well as inter-occasion variability (IOV) on CL. This original Pop-PK model 
was  associated  with  biased  predictions  of  low  concentrations  (Sebelipase  Alfa  PK/PD  Report  Section 
10.2.1), which was mainly observed during the terminal phase (Sebelipase Alfa PK/PD Report Section 
10.2.2). 
Following incorporation of all new PK and ADA data,   a 2-compartment model with linear elimination 
was used as a starting point for assessing the concentration-time profiles of sebelipase alfa based on the 
Pop-PK Analysis Dataset (75 patients). This base Pop-PK model included the effect of body weight as 
opposed to BSA because dosing of sebelipase alfa was body weight-based (mg/kg) in the contributing 
studies  and  because  of  the  high  correlation  between  BSA  and  body  weight  (Spearman  correlation  = 
0.995,  Sebelipase  Alfa  PK/PD  Report  Section  10.2.3).  Exponents  for  the  effect  of  body  weight  were 
estimated  using  an  allometric  model.  The  IV  flush  component  was  removed  and  a  single  zero-order 
infusion component was implemented. The effect of dose (3 mg/kg) on CL was estimated using a power 
model. A shared ETA between CL and intercompartmental clearance (Q) was included in the model. 
The  Pop-PK  model development  for  sebelipase  alfa consisted of  testing  the  following  (Sebelipase  Alfa 
PK/PD Report Section 5.3.2): 
•  Two-compartment  model  to  describe  the  relationship  between  serum  concentration  and  time 
following IV administration of sebelipase alfa. 
•  An empirical allometric model accounting for body weight impact (used to determine each dose) 
on CL and Vc parameters was used. Exponents for the effect of time-varying body weight on CL 
and Vc were estimated.

•  A variance component characterizing inter-individual variability (IIV) in model parameters. 
•  Modeling  of  unexplained  residual  variability  using  additive,  proportional,  or  additive  and 
proportional models. 
•  Any covariates identified in the model building process. 
Pop-PK models tested were in the following form: 
The IIV was modeled using exponential random-effect models with the following form: 
The final decision to retain a potential covariate in the model was based on scientific or clinical interest, 
mechanistic  plausibility,  a  priori  knowledge  about  covariate  effects,  correlation  with  other  potential 
covariates considered for evaluation in the model, adequate sample size for a categorical subgroup, and 
the greatest correlation with random effects of PK parameters. 
Details  on  model  evaluation,  estimation  shrinkage,  performance,  and  robustness  are  provided  in 
Sebelipase  Alfa  PK/PD  Report  Sections  5.3.4  through  5.3.6.  Individual  Bayesian  estimates  of  PK 
parameters were used to predict rich concentration-time profiles of sebelipase alfa from which the PK 
parameters were derived as described in Sebelipase Alfa PK/PD Report Section 5.3.7. 
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effects of dose on CL, with and without the data from 
3 patients who received the higher dose of 3 mg/kg (Sebelipase Alfa PK/PD Report Section 6.2.3). Given 
the large parameter uncertainty likely due to the data from only 3 individuals, and the little difference 
observed in the sensitivity analysis, the final model was estimated without including the data from these 
3 patients. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
The methods described by the applicant for the new model building and evaluation are overall considered 
state of the art. However, in view of the identified issues with data integrity and related data exclusion, 
the applicant is asked to provide the distribution of the data used for POPPK modelling by age group and 
to discuss whether there were enough data in the different age subgroups (<2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-12, and 12-
18 y.o) to allow adequate PK characterization in the different age groups. 
Moreover, the applicant should justify why they did not use fixed allometric scaling exponents for CL and 
volume of distribution parameters and compare the predictive performances with estimated parameters.

This  would  be  of  utmost  importance  in  case  the  data  in  the  younger  age  children  are  not  sufficiently 
represented in the dataset. 
2.1.4.  Immunogenicity 
To examine the potential for immunogenicity, the incidence of anti-sebelipase alfa antidrug antibodies 
(ADA)  was  monitored  with  the  validated  method  ELISA-0556  containing  three  tiers  of  testing:  (1) 
Screening  assay,  which  identifies  initial  positive  or  negative  samples,  (2)  Confirmatory  assay,  which 
assesses specificity of the positive screen samples, and (3) Titration assay which estimates the level of 
antibody for the confirmed positive samples. Any samples confirmed as ADA-positive were then further 
subject  to  testing  for  neutralizing  antidrug  antibody  (NAb)  activity  by  inhibition  of  enzyme  activity 
(ELISA-0566)  and  inhibition  of  cellular  uptake  (CELL-0042).  Immunogenicity  samples  were  collected 
before the administration of sebelipase alpha. The numbers of patients who were had positive ADA titers 
and the duration of exposure before first appearance of a positive ADA titer are presented. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
All the samples were analysed with the same immunogenicity assays as in the original dossier at MAA 
submission. 
Concerning the immunogenicity assays, the Applicant is requested to determine the cut-points of the 
target populations using the pre-treatment samples from the completed studies LAL-CL02, LAL-CL03, 
LAL-CL04, LAL-CL06 and LAL-CL08 to confirm the assay cut points determined with samples from healthy 
drug-naïve subjects. A statistical comparison is expected.

that represented 34% of maximum observed concentration (Cmax). This predose concentration was not 
used for PK parameter calculation as it was considered an outlier. There was no evidence of accumulation 
following  qow  administration.  Serum  exposure  to  sebelipase  alfa  increased  in  a  more  than  dose-
proportional manner (up to 15-fold) over the 3-fold increase in dose from 1 to 3 mg/kg.

2.2.4.  PD results from individual studies 
2.2.4.1.  Serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations 
Study  LAL-CL01 :  Following  initiation  of  treatment  with  sebelipase  alfa,  serum  ALT  concentrations 
decreased rapidly in 7 of the 9 patients (Figure 2). This reduction in ALT level was apparent within 2 
weeks of initiation of treatment, and the ALT level continued to decrease in most patients through Day 
28, approximately 1 week after the last infusion. For all 9 patients, the mean (SD) decrease in serum 
ALT concentration from Baseline to Day 28 was 38.7 (25.6) U/L, representing a 43.1% decrease (LAL-
CL01  Final  CSR  Table  14.2.2.1).  By  Day  52,  ALT  levels  were  at  or  approaching  baseline  levels  in  all 
patients  (Figure  2).  There  was  no  evidence  of  a  dose-related  effect  in  the  time  to  onset  of  in  the 
magnitude  of  the  reduction  of  serum  ALT  concentration,  or  in  the  reversal  of  the  effect  after 
discontinuation of treatment (Figure 2, LAL-CL01 Final CSR Table 14.2.5.1). 
Study LAL-CL04 : Following initiation of sebelipase alfa treatment on a qw dosing regimen, serum ALT 
concentrations  decreased  rapidly  and  these  initial  improvements  were  maintained  after  the  patients 
changed  to  a  qow  dosing  regimen  at  Week  6  (Figure  7).  At  Week  4  (the  last  assessment  on  a  qw 
regimen), mean (SD) serum ALT concentration was 46.1 (13.62) U/L, representing a mean (SD) change 
from  baseline  of  -28.4  (21.9)  U/L  (LAL-CL04  Final  CSR  Table  14.4.2.1.1.2).  At  Week  8  (the  first 
assessment on a qow regimen), mean (SD) serum ALT concentration was 36.8 (15.17) U/L, representing 
a mean (SD) change from baseline of -37.8 (21.27) U/L. After Week 8, mean ALT levels were generally 
stable through the end of the study. At the End-of-Study Visit (which occurred between Week 224 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 33/200 
 
 
  
  
 
Week 260), mean (SD) ALT was 50.0 (18.08) U/L, representing a mean (SD) change from baseline of -
26.6  (31.10)  U/L.  The  effect  of  sebelipase  alfa  on  serum  ALT  levels  was  similar  in  both  dose  cohorts 
(LAL-CL04 Final CSR Figure 14.3.4.13.1.2). 
Study LAL-CL02 : Figure 9 presents mean (SE) serum ALT concentration over time from the start of 
treatment with sebelipase alfa; ie, prior to the Double-blind Period for the SA/SA Group and prior to the 
first dose of sebelipase alfa in the Open-label Period for the PBO/SA Group. 
For the SA/SA Group, the reduction in serum ALT levels achieved during the Double-blind Period was 
sustained  throughout  the  Open-label  Period,  demonstrating  durability  of  clinical  response.  The  mean 
change from baseline at Week 22, the start of the Open-label Period, was -55.5 U/L (n = 32) and the 
mean change from baseline to the last Open-label Period assessment was -60.7 U/L (n = 36) (LAL-CL02 
Final CSR Table 14.2.4.2.3).  
For the PBO/SA Group, a marked reduction in serum ALT concentration was observed following initiation 
of treatment with sebelipase alfa in the Open-label Period, with a time course similar to that previously 
observed for the SA/SA Group in the Double-blind Period. A reduction in ALT level was apparent by the 
first postbaseline assessment at Week 24; ie, after 2 weeks of sebelipase alfa treatment (mean change 
from  baseline:  -19.6  U/L,  n  =  29)  with  further  decreases  through  Week  42;  ie,  after  20  weeks  of 
sebelipase  alfa  treatment  (mean  change  from  baseline:  -49.3  U/L,  n  =  30)  and  continued  decreases 
through  Week  88  (mean  change  from  baseline:  -53.9  U/L,  n  =  25).  Thereafter,  mean  serum  ALT 
concentrations were fairly stable over time. After Week 208, data were available for only 5 to 6 patients, 
and mean levels were less informative. The mean change from baseline to the last assessment in the 
Open-label Period was -39.1 U/L (n = 30) (LAL-CL02 Final CSR Table 14.2.4.2.3). 
Study  LAL-CL06  :  Following  initiation  of  treatment  with  sebelipase  alfa,  serum  ALT  concentration 
decreased rapidly (Figure 14). By the first postdose assessment at Week 4 (n = 30), mean serum ALT 
concentration was 50.4 U/L, representing a mean change from baseline of -25.8 U/L and a mean percent 
change  from  baseline  of  -25.9%  (LAL-CL06  Week  144  CSR  Table  14.2.1.1.1.2).  Mean  ALT  levels 
continued to decrease through approximately Week 36, and thereafter were essentially stable with the 
exception of a transient spike at Week 72, which was primarily driven by increases in 2 patients (LAL-
CL06 Week 144 CSR Section 11.4.1.1). At Week 96, mean serum ALT concentration was 38.8 U/L (n = 
27), representing a mean change from baseline of -32.4 U/L and a mean percent change of -29.1%. At 
Week 144 (n = 19), mean serum ALT concentration was 38.2 U/L, representing a mean change from 
baseline of -40.3 and percent change of -32.0% (LAL-CL06 Week 144 CSR Table 14.2.1.1.1.2). 
Study  LAL-CL03:  Following  initiation  of  treatment  with  sebelipase  alfa,  serum  ALT  concentrations 
decreased rapidly (Figure 16). Reductions in serum ALT levels were already evident at Week 1, when all 
patients were receiving sebelipase alfa at a dose of ≤ 0.35 mg/kg, with a median reduction from baseline 
of  -23.0  U/L  (n  =  7)  (LAL-CL03  Final  CSR  Table  14.2.8.4).  By  Week  4,  2  weeks  after  most  patients 
escalated to 1 mg/kg qw, the median reduction in ALT levels was -33.0 U/L (n = 5). Median percentage 
changes  from  baseline  at  Week  1  and  Week  4  were  -31.3%,  and  -66.00%,  respectively.  Median  ALT 
levels  were  fairly  stable  from  Week  4  through  Week  240,  the  last  assessment  for  which  data  were 
available for more than 2 patients, although a few patients had fluctuations in serum ALT levels over 
time. 
Study LAL-CL08: A consistent treatment effect on serum ALT concentration was not observed in this 
study, with both median (and mean) increases and decreases in ALT levels observed over time (Figure 
18).

2.2.4.2.  Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Concentrations 
Study LAL-CL01 : Serum LDL-C concentration increased for the majority of the patients across all dose 
cohorts by Day 28, which was approximately 1 week after the last infusion of sebelipase alfa (Figure 3). 
The increase in LDL-C level was more pronounced for the highest dose group (Cohort 3; 3 mg/kg) than 
for the lower 2 dose groups. By Day 52 serum LDL-C concentrations were within the normal range, and 
below baseline level for all patients with data available. 
Study LAL-CL04 : Following initiation of sebelipase alfa treatment on a qw dosing regimen, a transient 
increase  in  serum  LDL-C  concentration  (Figure  8)  was  observed  at  Week  4  (the  first  postdose 
assessment), at which time mean (SD) serum LDL-C level was 287.6 (143.88) mg/dL, representing a 
mean (SD) change from baseline of 138.1 (123.57) mg/dL. Serum LDL-C concentration decreased with 
continued  sebelipase  alfa  treatment,  which  was  administered  on  a  qow  dosing  regimen  beginning  at 
Week 6. By the next assessment at Week 8, mean (SD) serum LDL-C concentration was below baseline 
levels, with a mean (SD) observed LDL-C concentration of 122.6 (97.47) mg/dL, representing a mean 
(SD) change from baseline of -26.8 (43.31) mg/dL. Thereafter, mean LDL-C levels were generally stable 
over  time.  At  the  End-of-Study  Visit,  which  occurred  between  Week  224  and  Week  260,  mean  (SD) 
serum LDL-C concentration was 93.3 (48.53) mg/dL, representing a mean (SD) change from baseline of 
-35.0 (42.27) mg/dL. The effect of sebelipase alfa on mean LDL-C levels was similar in both dose cohorts. 
Study  LAL-CL02  :  Figure  10  presents  mean  (SE)  percent  change  from  baseline  in  serum  LDL-C 
concentrations over time from the start of treatment with sebelipase alfa; ie, prior to the Double-blind 
Period for the SA/SA Group and prior to the first dose of sebelipase alfa in the Open-label Period for the 
PBO/SA Group. For the SA/SA Group, the mean percent reduction in LDL-C levels achieved during the 
Double-blind  Period  was  sustained  throughout  the  Open-label  Period.  The  mean  change  and  mean 
percent change from baseline at Week 22, the start of the Open-label Period, were -58.8 mg/dL and -
33.0%, respectively (n = 33) and the mean change and mean percent change from baseline to the last 
assessment in the Open-label Period were -45.4 mg/dL and -19.7%, respectively (n = 36). 
For the PBO/SA Group, initiation of sebelipase alfa treatment in the Open-label Period was associated 
with a transient increase in serum LDL-C concentration at Week 24, ie, after 2 weeks of treatment, at 
which  time  the  mean  change  and  mean  percent  change  from  baseline  were  26.7  mg/dL  and  13.7%, 
respectively (n = 29). This transient increase in LDL-C level was similar to that observed for the SA/SA 
Group following initiation of treatment in the Double-blind Period. Levels of LDL-C were decreasing again 
by the next assessment at Week 26, ie, after 4 weeks of treatment with sebelipase alfa (mean change 
and  mean  percent  change  from  baseline  of  2.2  mg/dL  and  1.0%,  respectively,  n  =  30).  A  reduction 
relative to baseline was apparent by Week 28, ie, after 6 weeks of treatment with sebelipase alfa (mean 
change and mean percent change from baseline of -14.3 mg/dL and -7.7%, respectively, n = 27). Further 
reductions in LDL-C were apparent through approximately Week 50; ie, after 28 weeks of treatment with 
sebelipase  alfa,  at  which  time  the  mean  change  and  mean  percent  change  from  baseline  were  -56.3 
mg/dL and -27.9%, respectively (n = 28). These improvements in LDL-C were sustained during long-
term  treatment  with  sebelipase  alfa.  At  the  last  open-label  assessment,  the  mean  change  and  mean 
percent change from baseline were -42.7 mg/dL and -18.1%, respectively (n = 30). 
Study LAL-CL06 : Following initiation of treatment with sebelipase alfa, a transient increase in serum 
LDL-C  concentration  was  observed  at  the  first  postdose  assessment  at  Week  4  (Figure  15),  at  which 
time  mean  serum  LDL-C  concentration  was  168.1  mg/dL  (n  =  28)  (LAL-CL06  Week  144  CSR  Table 
14.2.2.1.1.2). The mean serum LDL-C concentration decreased with continued sebelipase alfa treatment 
and was 151.0 mg/dL at Week 8 (n = 27) (mean change from baseline -6.0 mg/dL, mean percent change 
-4.7%).  Mean  serum  LDL-C  concentration  continued  to  decrease  through  Week  36,  and  thereafter 
remained essentially stable through Week 144. Mean serum LDL-C concentration was 131.7 mg/dL at 
Assessment report

Week 96 (n = 25) (mean change from baseline -40.2 mg/dL, mean percent change -20.5%) and 116.5 
mg/dL at Week 144 (n = 19) (mean change from baseline -54.2 mg/dL, mean percent change -31.2%). 
Study LAL-CL03: Figure 17 presents individual serum LDL-C concentrations over time. Four patients 
had both baseline and post-baseline LDL-C data. Each of these 4 patients (01-002, 02-001, 02-003, 05-
001) had an increase in serum LDL-C concentration at Week 1 of treatment, with the magnitude of this 
increase ranging from 5.8 to 76.1 mg/dL. Three of these 4 patients (02-001, 02-003, 05-001) also had 
LDL-C data at Week 2, at which time serum LDL-C levels were decreasing and continued to decrease at 
subsequent timepoints. The other patient (01-002) had a further increase in serum LDL-C concentration 
at the next available assessment at Week 32 after which serum LDL-C concentration began to decrease. 
After  resolution  of  the  transient  increase  in  LDL-C,  all  4  patients  had  serum  LDL-C  levels  that  were 
generally normal or below normal throughout treatment, with the exception of an isolated high value in 
Patient 02-003 at Week 120 and in Patient 01-002 at 2 unscheduled assessments (peak = 133.0 mg/dL 
at Day 631 [~Week 90]). Two patients had post-baseline LDL-C data only. The 1 patient (01-003) who 
had  a  high  serum  LDL-C  concentration  at  the  first  available  assessment  at  Week  1  (154.7  mg/dL) 
achieved  a  normal  LDL-C  level  on  further  treatment.  The  other  patient  (02-002)  had  serum  LDL-C 
concentrations  that  were  normal  at  the  first  assessment  at  Week  3  and  normal  or  below  normal 
throughout treatment. 
Study LAL-CL08: Baseline LDL-C data were available for only 3 patients. All 3 patients had an initial 
transient increase in serum LDL-C concentration following initiation of treatment with sebelipase alfa, 
with peak levels observed at Week 1, Week 2, or Week 4 and ranging from 140.00 to 212.69 mg/dL. 
Thereafter, serum LDL-C levels decreased with continued treatment. 
2.2.5.  Immunogenicity 
Study LAL-CL01 : All 9 patients tested negative for ADAs at each of the 4 scheduled timepoints when 
this testing was performed. 
Study LAL-CL04 : One patient (Patient 02-001) tested positive for ADA at a single timepoint (Week 4), 
with  a  titer  of  80.  This  single  result  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  true  seroconversion  given  that  all 
subsequent  ADA  results  for  this  patient  were  negative.  The  patient  tested  negative  for  NAbs  in  both 
enzyme activity and cell uptake assays.  
Study LAL-CL02 : Six patients had at least 1 confirmed positive titer for ADA during treatment with 
sebelipase alfa in Study LAL-CL02: 5 patients who received sebelipase alfa during the Double-blind Period 
and 1 patient who received sebelipase alfa only during the Open-label Period. In general, ADA titers were 
low  and not  sustained.  Two  patients  had  a  positive ADA  titer  at  only  a  single timepoint  (Week  8  and 
Week 88). The other 4 patients were intermittently ADA positive. Two of the 4 patients were ADA positive 
by  Week  4,  the  first  postbaseline  timepoint  assessed,  with  titers  of  448  and  816.  Thereafter,  titers 
decreased over time in these patients, with 1 patient testing ADA negative at all assessments after Week 
12  and  the  other  patient  continuing  to  intermittently  test  ADA  positive  with  lower  titers  than  those 
observed at Week 4. Two other patients initially tested ADA positive at Week 12 or Week 42 (after 14 
weeks  of  sebelipase  alfa  as  the  latter  patient  received  placebo  during  the  double-blind  period);  peak 
titers were observed at the initial ADA positive visit (titer: 35 or 310) and the patients were ADA negative 
at the majority of the assessments thereafter. Of the 6 patients who had ADA-positive findings, 2 patients 
developed NAbs: 1 patient who received sebelipase alfa during the Double-blind Period tested positive 
for antibodies that inhibited cellular uptake (titer: < 5 to 5) and/or enzyme activity on several occasions, 
and the patient who received placebo during the Double-blind Period tested positive for antibodies that 
inhibited cellular uptake on 1 occasion during treatment with sebelipase alfa in the Open-label Period

(titer: 5). All patients with any ADA-positive result continued to receive treatment with sebelipase alfa. 
At the last open-label assessment, 5 of the 6 patients tested ADA negative.  
Study LAL-CL06 : Two (6.5%) of 31 patients developed ADAs to sebelipase alfa at a single post-dose 
timepoint  (Week  4  or  Week  12).  The  findings  were  transient,  had  low  titers  (<  20),  and  were  not 
associated with the formation of NAbs. There was no apparent impact of ADA on sebelipase alfa PK.  
Study LAL-CL03: Post-treatment immunogenicity data were available for 7 of the 9 patients; 4 of the 
7 patients with post-treatment immunogenicity data had positive ADA titers on at least 1 occasion (initial 
ADA-positive result at Week 5 (1 patient). Week 8 (2 patients), and Week 59 (1 patient), with persistence 
of ADA positivity (ie, more than 1 ADA-positive result) observed for all 4 patients. Three of the 4 patients 
with  ADA-positive  titers  tested  positive  for  NAbs  that  inhibited  LAL  enzyme  activity,  which  were 
concurrent with the first positive ADA titer, and/or that inhibited cellular uptake of LAL, 2 of which were 
concurrent with the first positive ADA titer. 
Study LAL-CL08: Six (60%) of the 10 patients in the study developed ADAs to sebelipase alfa, with the 
initial ADA-positive result as early as Week 5. Four patients who developed ADAs on or prior to Week 
12, all had high titers, with peak titers ranging from 46,774 to 302,963. One patient who first developed 
ADAs at Week 20 had a moderate titer that peaked at 2,958 at the Week 84 Visit. One patient who had 
a more delayed onset of ADAs at Week 60 continued to have low titers throughout treatment, with a 
peak titer of 292 at the follow-up visit. All 6 patients developed NAbs. Further details on the time course 
for development of ADAs/NAbs, and relationship to dose, are provided in LAL-CL08 CSR.  
Integrated analysis:  
Across all 6 clinical studies, 19 of 125 (15%) patients had at least 1 postbaseline ADA positive result: 9 
children or adults and 10 infants. For children and adult patients with LAL-D, ADA positivity was transient 
with  generally  low  titers  of  ADAs  reported.  On  the  other  hand,  persistence  of  ADA  positivity  (ie, 
observation of more than 1 ADA-positive result) was observed for all 10 infants and persistence of high 
titer ADAs was observed for 3 of the 10 infants. 
Eleven of the 19 patients who developed ADAs also developed NAbs during treatment with sebelipase 
alfa: 2 children or adults and 9 infants. 
A  quantitative  assessment  of  effect  of  immunogenicity  on  exposure  was  performed  using  a  covariate 
analysis  methodology  on  the  Pop
PK  model  (N  =  75).  The  effect  of  time-varying  ADA  on  CL  was  not 
significant and the covariate was not retained in the model. The effect of NAb was not formally tested in 
the Pop-PK model due to the low number of samples with both a measurable concentration and a positive 
‑
NAb (ie, a total of 1 positive NAb in 1 patient). 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Concerning immunogenicity, the MAH has investigated the overall impact of ADA on exposure using a 
covariate analysis methodology on the final Pop-PK model. But the total number of patients with samples 
with measurable concentrations of sebelipase alfa and an ADA status used in this analysis is limited in 
comparison to the totality of data provided (3 ADA+ on 19 ADA+ in total; 72 ADA- on 106 ADA- in total). 
The effect of NAb was not formally tested in the population PK model due to the low number of samples 
with both a measurable concentration and a positive NAb (ie, a total of 1 positive NAb in 1 patient). Thus 
no conclusion can be currently drawn in relation to PK due to the limited information available. The SmPC 
should be updated in that sense, unless otherwise justified.

Rapporteur’s comments 
The reliability of the model to support the claimed conclusion by the applicant is questioned in particular 
for children of lowest age groups (<2 years old and from 2-4 y.o). 
The assessment of bodyweight effect on clearance and volume of distribution with an estimated exponent 
is not supported in view of the limited data in the lower age subgroup: data from only 9 patients of < 4 
years old were available. Bodyweight should be inputed in the model using allometric scaling with fix 
exponents  of  0.75  and  1  for  CL  and  V  parameters,  respectively.  Additional  effect  of  age/maturation 
should be tested on this model already including body weight effects. 
Nonlinear clearance should also be tested using individual predicted concentrations as exposure marker. 
It  is  noted  that  Vp  parameters  was  poorly  estimated  with  RSE  of  66%,  this  should  be  discussed, 
particularly in light of data exclusion. 
Model misspecifications are observed on the IPRED vs OBS and in the pcVPC  graphics: this should be 
further discussed. 
Model fitting performances (GOF nad pcVPC) should also be provided by age subgroups. 
NPDEs distribution should also be provided as well as NPDE vs PRED and vs time plots. 
The  applicant  is  asked  to  perform  additional  simulations  using  the  final  updated  model  and  identify 
alternative dosing weight bands leading to comparable PK exposure in adults and in different subgroups 
of children.

2.2.7.  Population PK/PD Modeling results 
PK/PD Analysis of ALT 
The PK/PD analysis of ALT was performed based on data collected in LAL-CL02 (patients ≥ 4 years) and 
LAL-CL03 (patient less than 8 weeks) up to 52 weeks. PK/PD modeling of ALT was performed based on 
data collected up to 52 weeks in study LAL-CL02 and LAL-CL03. Median (5th to 95th percentile) profiles 
of ALT following repeated administration of sebelipase alfa are presented in Figure 6. A rapid decline in 
ALT  was  observed  after  initiation  of  sebelipase  alfa  treatment  in  study  LALCL02  and  LAL-CL03.  The 
suppression  of  ALT  concentrations  was  sustained  following  prolonged  administration.  An  indirect  PD 
response model with a zero-order production of ALT response and an inhibitory effect of sebelipase alfa 
on  the  zero-order  production  of  ALT  was  used.  Parameter  derived  with  the  PK/PD  model  for  ALT  are 
presented in Appendix 3 (Sections 11.1). Due to the very rapid decrease in ALT, the IC50 could not be 
robustly estimated (i.e., values close to zero). As a result, the IC50 in the effect compartment was fixed 
to 1 ng/mL. The population estimates of baseline (E0), Imax and Kout were 97.3 U/L, 0.601, and 0.00398 
h-1, respectively. These above E0, Imax and Kout values were robustly estimated with RSE values less 
than 20%. A study effect (LAL-CL03) on baseline (E0) was observed suggesting that infants presented 
a baseline ALT approximately 14% lower than that observed in study LAL-CL03. Based on the estimated 
Imax, the rate of production of ALT (Kin) in study LAL-CL02 and LALCL03 were similar (i.e., a maximum 
of  59.9%  and  64.8%,  respectively).  The  goodness-of-fit  derived  with  the  PK/PD  model  of  ALT  and 
individual observed and predicted concentration-time profiles of ALT are presented below.

Rapporteur’s comments 
The choice of the 2 PD markers for the modelling exercise need to be better substantiated, as well as 
acceptance criteria and target levels to be reached for the selected dosing regimens. 
Following issues were identified in the 2 PK/PD models: 
The exclusion of placebo arm data from the PK/PD analysis is not acceptable given that these data could 
be informative for adequate description of the time course of the 2 biomarkers. 
The selection of the structural model in particular absence of testing alternative structural model with 
drug clearance from the central compartment and outside the effect compartment need to be justified 
for both ALT and LDL-cholesterol. 
Key parameters (e.g. IC50 and  EC50) were fixed without justifications of the source and the plausibility 
of the values used. 
PcVPC should be provided and were not. 
Model fitting performances (GOF nad pcVPC) should also be provided by age subgroups. 
NPDEs distribution should also be provided as well as NPDE vs PRED and vs time plots. 
Based on all the above, it is not acceptable that the PK/PD models are used to justify the adequacy of 
the proposed dosing regimens and the proposed changes in the SmpC. 
2.3.  Discussion 
As a result of updated clinical pharmacology data mainly related to the final POPPK model results and 
PK/PD model results presented in this variation, sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 44/200 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
“4.2  Posology and method of administration 
KANUMA treatment should be supervised by a healthcare professional experienced in the management 
of patients with LAL deficiency, other metabolic disorders, or chronic liver diseases. KANUMA should be 
administered by a trained healthcare professional who can manage medical emergencies.  
Posology 
It is important to initiate treatment as early as possible after diagnosis of LAL deficiency. 
For  instructions  on  the  preventive  measures  and  monitoring  of  hypersensitivity  reactions,  see 
section 4.4. Following the occurrence of a hypersensitivity reaction, appropriate pre-treatment should 
be considered according to the standard of care (see section 4.4). 
Infants (< 6 months of age)  
The recommended starting dose in infants (< 6 months of age) presenting with rapidly progressive LAL 
deficiency  is  1 mg/kg  administered  as  an  intravenous  infusion  once  weekly.  Dose  escalation  up  to 
5 mg/kg once weekly should be considered based on clinical response. 
Children and adults  
The recommended dose in children and adults who do not present with rapidly progressive LAL deficiency 
prior  to  6 months  of  age is  1 mg/kg  administered  as  an  intravenous  infusion once  every  other  week. 
Dose escalation to 3 mg/kg once every other week should be considered based on clinical response.  
Special populations 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
No dosing adjustment is recommended in patients with renal or hepatic impairment based on current 
knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sebelipase alfa. See section 5.2. 
Paediatric population 
Administration of KANUMA to infants with confirmed multiple-organ failure should be at the discretion of 
the treating physician. 
Overweight patients  
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  KANUMA  in  overweight  patients  have  not  been  thoroughly  evaluated  and 
therefore no alternative dose regimens can be recommended for these patients at this time. 
Elderly population (≥ 65 years old)  
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  KANUMA  in  patients  older  than  65 years  have  not  been  evaluated  and  no 
alternative dose regimens can be recommended for these patients. See section 5.1.  
5.2 Pharmaco-kinetic properties 
Children and adults 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  sebelipase  alfa  in  children  and  adults  were  determined  using  a  population 
pharmacokinetic  analysis  of  75 patients  with  LAL  deficiency  who  received  intravenous  infusions  of 
KANUMA across 4 clinical studies LAL-CL02, LAL-CL03, LAL-CL04 and LAL-CL06 (Table 4). Based on a 
non-compartmental analysis of data, the pharmacokinetics of sebelipase alfa are nonlinear with a greater 
than  dose-proportional  increase  in  exposure  observed  between  the  1  and  3 mg/kg  dosages.  No 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020

accumulation is seen at 1 mg/kg (once weekly or once every other week) or 3 mg/kg once weekly. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Based on these data, the pharmacokinetics of sebelipase alfa appeared to be nonlinear with a greater 
than dose-proportional increase in exposure observed at doses greater than 1 mg/kg dose. 
Special populations 
During the covariate analysis of the population pharmacokinetics model for sebelipase alfa, age, sex and 
enzyme maturation were found to not have a significant influence on CL (drug clearance) and Vc (central 
volume of distribution) of sebelipase alfa. Body weight and body surface area are significant covariates 
on CL. Sebelipase alfa has not been investigated in patients aged 65 years or older.  
There is limited information on sebelipase alfa pharmacokinetics in non-Caucasian ethnic groups.  
Sebelipase alfa is a protein and is expected to be metabolically degraded through peptide hydrolysis. 
Consequently, impaired liver function is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sebelipase alfa. 
There is a lack of data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Renal elimination of sebelipase alfa is considered a minor pathway for clearance. There is a lack of data 
in patients with renal impairment. 
Immunogenicity  
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for the development of immunogenicity. Nineteen 
of 125 (15%) patients with LAL Deficiency had at least 1◦postbaseline antidrug antibody (ADA) positive 
result, 9 of which were children and adult patients. For children and adult patients with LAL Deficiency, 
ADA  positivity  was  transient  with  generally  low  titers  of  ADAs  reported.  No  apparent  correlation  of 
antibody development to altered sebelipase alfa pharmacokinetics was observed. 
However, concerns are raised about the validity of the entire set of PK data reported as a result of the 
disqualification of a substantial number of PK study sample results due to data integrity issues during 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 46/200 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
study sample analysis. Overall, the conclusions drawn on the pharmacokinetics of sebelipase alpha are 
questioned and an inspection may be warranted depending on the guarantee provided by the MAH at 
the next round .  
In  addition  to  non-reportable  samples  due  to  data  integrity  issue,  a  number  of  samples  were  also 
considered  as  non-reportable  because  they  were  analysed  beyond  the  validated  long-term  stability 
range.  Therefore,  the  summarized  non-compartmental  PK  parameters  observed  in  individual  studies 
LAL-CL04  and  LAL-CL06    were  based  on  a  limited  number  of  patients  for  several  subgroups.  As  a 
consequence, the comparison of the non-compartmental PK parameters between the different categories 
of age and different doses is compromised. According to the MAH, all the new reportable PK data would 
be included in the updated population PK analysis. But before the information provided in the SmPC can 
be considered acceptable, clarifications should be given on the PK samples considered for inclusion in 
the POPPK analysis (n = 880) in comparison to the PK samples considered as having reportable results 
from a bioanalytical point of view (n = 1122). The studies with data integrity issues and errors in dosing 
records should be excluded (i.e. studies LAL-CL01 and LAL-CL08).   
Moreover, due to the limited data in the lower age subgroup (only 9 patients of < 4 years old), a major 
objection  has  been  raised  regarding  the  strategy  used  to  investigate  the  effect  of  bodyweight  on  the 
clearance and volume of distribution in the POPPK model. Moreover, additional effect of age/maturation 
should be tested on this model. In view of the identified issues with data integrity/out-of-stability and 
related data exclusion, the applicant is also asked to provide the distribution of the data used for POPPK 
modelling by age group and to discuss whether there were enough data in the different age subgroups 
(<2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-12, and 12-18 y.o) to allow adequate PK characterization in the different age groups. 
Additional limitations and uncertainties have been identified in the population PK modelling that need to 
be satisfactorily addressed before conclusions from PK modelling can be used to update the section 5.2 
of the SmPC. 
Furthermore, a number issues have been identified preventing the use of POPPK and PK/PD models to 
justify the adequacy of the proposed dosing regimens and the proposed changes in the SmpC. 
Regarding  the  bioanalytical  method  used  for  the  determination  of  sebelipase  alpha,  a  number  of 
bioanalytical issues are still pending regarding the specificity, selectivity in lipeamic serum, the higher 
variability  than  commonly  accepted  and  missing  parallelism  data  for  patients  aged  <  1  year  old.  But 
given (i) the acceptable results for the overall ISR analysis for reportable PK samples and the acceptable 
results for the additional parallelism experiments provided in addition to the original MAA dossier; and 
(ii) the orphan status of the disease and the unmet medical need of the disease, it is considered that 
they would not have an impact on the positive benefit/risk balance for children of > 4 years old.  
Concerning immunogenicity, the MAH has investigated the impact of ADA on exposure using a covariate 
analysis  methodology  on the  final  Pop-PK  model.  But  the total  number  of  patients  with  samples  with 
measurable  concentrations  of  sebelipase  alfa  and  an  ADA  status  used  in  this  analysis  is  limited  in 
comparison to the totality of data provided (3 ADA+ on 19 ADA+ in total; 72 ADA- on 106 ADA- in total). 
The effect of NAb was not formally tested in the population PK model due to the low number of samples 
with both a measurable concentration and a positive NAb (ie, a total of 1 positive NAb in 1 patient). Thus 
no conclusion can be currently drawn in relation to PK due to the limited information available. The SmPC 
should be updated in that sense, unless otherwise justified. In addition, the adequacy of the pre-study 
cut points for the target population should be discussed. 
Regarding the modifications in the section 5.2, some updates are already proposed :  
- 
it should be clarified in the title of the table 5 that the parameters were simulated after multiple 
dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 47/200 
 
 
  
  
- 
- 
the table 5 is not in line with the table 8 of the PK/PD simulation report. As an example, the total 
number N for overall subjects is discrepant (N=72 vs N=4). This should be addressed. 
The conclusions on the linearity of sebelipase alpha PK and accumulation over time are drawn 
based on the non-compartmental analysis in study LAL-CL04 and in study LAL-CL04 and LAL-
CL06, respectively. But the number of patients in each category of age was limited and should 
be reflected in the SmPC. In study LAL-CL04, no accumulation was seen at 1 mg/kg once every 
other  week  (qow)  or  3  mg/kg  qow  based  on  the  absence  of  any  increase  in  pre-infusion 
concentrations  of  sebelipase  alfa  in  Study  LAL-CL04  (pre-dose  <  9.375  ng/ml  =  LLOQ  in  all 
subjects apart from the 1 instance, but considered as biologically implausible and excluded from 
PK analysis) and the overall lack of increase in the median values for AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and Cmax 
over time. In study LAL-CL06, there was no evidence of accumulation following 1 mg/kg dose 
administration qow. These results are in line with the information reported in the SmPC based 
on non-compartmental results. But the lack of sign of accumulation for the 3 mg/kg qow dosing 
is not reported in the SmPC. Instead, lack of accumulation at 3 mg/kg once weekly is mentioned. 
It  should  be  clarified  if  the  source  of  this  information  is  the  study  LAL-CL01  while  all  the  PK 
samples from this study were disqualified because they were outside the validated stability range. 
These issues should be addressed and the SmPC updated accordingly. 
3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
3.1.  Efficacy analysis of the completed study LAL-EA01 
LAL-EA01  was  and  open-label  expanded  access  study  which  meant  to  allow  access  to  treatment  for 
patients, not eligible for participation in any of the clinical trails, in the US until commercialization of the 
drug. 
After a baseline assessment patients started treatment with sebelipase alfa for up to 78 weeks or until 
commercial  product  became  available,  and  all  started  with  an  initial  dosing  od  1mg/kg  qow,  with 
permitted dose increases up to 3mg/kg qw based on responses to treatment. 
Assessments were done throughout, and a AE-focused follow-up call was done at most 30 days after the 
last dosing, and those transitioning to commercial product also had to come in for a clinic visit. Figure 1 
provides an overview of the study flow and Table 1 an overview of the scheduled assesments:

2.  Patients  who  received  an  investigational  product  within  30  days  (for  a  small  molecule)  or  60 
days (for a biologic) of commencing treatment, and which in the opinion of the investigator or 
Sponsor, may negatively impact patient safety. 
3.  Patients who have received sebelipase alfa as part of a clinical trial that is currently active. 
4.  Patients with known hypersensitivity to eggs 
3.1.3.  Disposition, demographics and baseline characteristics 
A total of six patients were enrolled, and all (100%) received treatment until completion. At the time of 
reporting all subjects transitioned to commercial product. The FAS was compromised of all 6 subjects. 
All subjects where white males, with one adult in his forties and 5 paediatric subjects (between 10.3 and 
17.4 years of age) of which 4 were siblings at time of study entry. 
The  most  frequently  reported  LAL  deficiency  clinical  manifestations  on  medical  history  included 
dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. The 1 adult subject in the study was 
also noted to have portal hypertension and esophageal varices, both of which had an onset approximately 
39 years after the subject was diagnosed with LAL deficiency and approximately 1 year prior the subject’s 
initiation of treatment with sebelipase alfa under this protocol. 
Baseline  growth  impairment  was  noted  in  4  of  the 5  pediatric  subjects,  having  weight-for-age  (WFA) 
percentiles ranging from 7.8% to 48.57% and length-for-age (LFA) percentiles ranging from 0.45% to 
30.52%  at  baseline.  The  one  other  pediatric  subject  in  the  study  had  a  WFA  of  84.04%  and  LFA  of 
49.47% at baseline. The adult subjects was obese and of normal height. 
Anthropometric data for the 5 pediatric subjects in the study indicated maintenance of growth status 
during treatment with sebelipase alfa. While modest increases in WFA percentile were observed following 
initiation of sebelipase alfa therapy in the 4 pediatric subjects with baseline WFA percentiles below the 
50th centile at baseline, this improvement in WFA was sustained through EOT in only 2 of the 4 subjects. 
No subject had a WFA percentile that crossed (either improving or worsening) a major centile line during 
the study. 
3.1.4.  Efficacy analysis 
All  6  subjects  showed  decreases  in  ALT  and  AST  (figures  and  respectively),  with  5  and  subjects 
respectively achieving normalisation at EOT. Similarly, GGT and ALP levels also improved. All 6 patients 
had decreases in total cholesterol and LDL-c, with 5 of 6 patients continuing to improve through EOT. 
The other patient initially improved but was diagnosed with an increase in LDL-c levels at EOT.

Table 15: Serum Lipids Shift Table for Change From Baseline by Visit (FAS) 
Serum ferritin and hs-CRP levels were essentially unchanged during treatment with sebelipase alfa, with 
levels remaining within normal range (5 subjects) or above normal (1 subject) at baseline and throughout 
the study. 
A  total  of  4  subjects  presented  with  evidence  of  coagulopathy  at  baseline,  of  which  2  subjects  had 
improvements by the EOT visit. 
3.1.5.  Conclusion and discussion 
Efficacy  analysis  was  not  an  objective  of  the  EA  study.  However,  clinical  laboratory  and  physical 
examination assessments done as part of the safety analysis also provided information regarding clinical 
benefit of treatment.

Sebelipase  alfa  treatment  resulted  in  rapid  and  marked  improvements  in  LAL  deficiency-related  liver 
dysfunction and dyslipidemia in all 6 subjects in this study. Serum transaminases, which were elevated 
at baseline in all 6 subjects, decreased markedly by the first post-baseline assessment at Week 12, and 
AST  and  ALT  normalized  by  EOT  in  5  subjects  and  2  subjects,  respectively.  Improvements  in  other 
markers  of  potential  liver  cell  injury  were  also  observed  and  physical  examination  findings  provide 
additional supportive data for improvement in liver dysfunction, with a reduction in liver size observed 
for both subjects who had a palpable liver at baseline. One subject however did develop a palpable liver 
when he had none at baseline. 
Reductions in total cholesterol and LDL-c were typically apparent by the first post-baseline assessment 
at  Week  12,  and  continued  to  improve  through  EOT  in  5  of  the  6  subjects.  These  improvements  in 
dyslipidemia occurred in the absence of initiation of treatment with a lipid-lowering medication in 5 of 
these subjects. 
3.2.  Integrated efficacy analysis of studies LAL-CL01, LAL-CL04, LAL-CL02, 
LAL-CL06, LAL-CL03 and LAL-CL08 
Assessor’s note: 
The stand alone report for LAL-CL02 and the responses to LAL-C08 assessment by the Committee were 
submitted to the EMA separately of this grouped variation and are assessed within this procedure as part 
of the dataset. Specific reference to these analyses is only made if particular issues would be noted. 
Methods & Results – analysis of data submitted 
3.2.1.  Patient dispositions in the individual studies 
3.2.1.1.  Overall Background 
Sebelipase alfa is currently indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients of all 
ages with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D). The current type II procedure seeks to provide an 
overview of the cumulative efficacy data from all clinical studies in the sebelipase alfa clinical program 
and includes data from 125 patients, including 106 children and adults and 19 infants. It serves as an 
update  to  the  sebelipase  alfa  Summary  of  Clinical  Efficacy  submitted  with  the  original  regulatory 
application, following completion of clinical registration studies.  
LAL-D is a serious and life-threatening multisystem storage disorder caused by a marked decrease in or 
absence  of  lysosomal  acid  lipase  (LAL)  enzyme  activity  caused  by  mutations  affecting  the  Lipase  A, 
lysosomal acid type (LIPA) gene located on chromosome 10q23.2-q23.3.  
LAL-D presenting in infants is very rare, with an estimated prevalence of less than 2 lives per million, 
and growth failure is a key clinical feature and contributor to the early mortality of LAL-D presenting in 
infants. LAL-D presenting in children and adults is the most common presentation of the disease, yet it 
is  still  very  rare.  While  the  age  of  clinical  symptom  onset  is  variable,  with  some  patients  going 
undiagnosed  until  complications  manifest  in  adulthood,  the  majority  of  cases  described  to  date  were 
diagnosed before the age of 20. 
Overall LAL-D is associated with significant burden of disease and a shortened life expectancy.

Sebelipase alfa is a recombinant human LAL enzyme, which, once bound to the receptors, is internalized 
and localized to the lysosomal compartment, where it hydrolyzes accumulated substrate in LAL-deficient 
cells, thus reducing the pathological effects in affected tissues. 
Figure 3 and Table 16 presents a summarized overview of the clinical development program and the 
included studies respectively for Kanuma:

As can be seen. the dosing regimens varied among the protocols, and individual dose adjustments were 
allowed in each protocol. The first clinical study (Study LAL-CL01) was designed primarily to evaluate 
the safety and tolerability of sebelipase alfa, following administration as once weekly (qw) intravenous 
infusions in adult patients. Given the requirement for chronic administration in patients with LAL-D, a 
once  every  other  week  (qow)  dosing  regimen  was  considered  preferable  to  a  qw  dosing  regimen  for 
patients whose clinical condition permitted (in infants with rapidly progressing disease, a qw regimen 
was still considered necessary). 
In  the  qow  dose  regimen,  sebelipase  alfa  was  administered  at  an  initial  dose  of  1  mg/kg,  with  the 
potential for dose escalation to 3 mg/kg qow and 3 mg/kg qw based on evidence of disease progression. 
The starting dose of 1 mg/kg qow was the sole dose evaluated in the pivotal study in children and adults 
(Study LAL-CL02). When sebelipase alfa received marketing approval,  
1 mg/kg qow was the recommended dose for children and adults presenting with LAL-D.  
Sebelipase alfa was initiated at 0.35 mg/kg qw in the pivotal first study in infants (Study LAL-CL03) and 
at 1 mg/kg qw in the second study in infants (Study LAL-CL08). Patients had dose escalations as required 
by the protocols and by their individual clinical responses. The maximum dose in an infant study was 
7.5  mg/kg  qw  (in  1  patient).  When  sebelipase  alfa  received  marketing  approval,  the  recommended 
starting dose for infants was 1 mg/kg qw, with an escalation to 3 mg/kg qw for patients who did not 
achieve an optimal clinical response.  
Endpoints  were  chosen  based  on  the  fact  that  elevation  of  serum  transaminases,  elevated  LDL-C, 
elevated  non-high  density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (non-HDL-C),  decreased  HDL-C,  and  elevated 
triglycerides  are  important  markers  of  the  diseases  and  thus  a  successful  therapy  for  LAL-D  should 
produce clinically meaningful corrections of these abnormalities.  
Therapeutic  efficacy  was  further  evaluated  by  improvement  in  survival  and  improvement  in  growth 
parameters  in  infants,  children,  and  adults.  Reductions  in  liver  fat  content  and  liver  volume  and 
improvement in liver histology are also considered evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment. 
Patient reported health outcomes (ie, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy [FACIT]-Fatigue, 
Pediatric  Quality  of  Life  Inventory  [PedsQL],  and  Chronic  Liver  Disease  Questionnaire  [CLDQ])  and

development assessments (ie, Denver II development scale) were additionally used to provide additional 
insights into the potential impact of therapy in patients with LAL-D.  
Not that not all studies in the development programme studied the same efficacy variables and thus the 
comparison of results across studies will be done on those that were shared between trials (ie, survival, 
liver  and  spleen  assessments  [organ  volumes,  organ  fat  content,  and  liver  histopathology],  serum 
transaminases, other liver biochemical markers, serum lipids, and patient health outcomes). 
Rapporteur’s comments 
As  noted  by  the  Applicant,  due  to  various  degrees  of  non-congruency  between  individual 
trails, the integrated analysis will inherently suffer from certain paucities in possible analyses. 
Note however that the individual studies making up the body of data for this integral analysis 
have  been  analysed  separately  prior  in  individual  procedures  and  generally  no  egregious 
efficacy or safety analysis were noticed during these individual assessments. 
3.2.1.2.  Individual study disposition: LAL-CL-01 
The study had nine patients enrolled (3 patients per treatment group), all of which completed the study. 
All patients were white and 6 were male. Mean (SD) age at the time of enrollment was 32 (11) years. 
The 3 treatment groups were similar with respect to the numbers of male and female patients and patient 
age. All patients except one were non-obese. 
On screening physical examination, hepatomegaly was present in 8 patients and 6 patients had ALT > 
upper limit of normal (ULN), 6 patients had AST > ULN, and 2 patients had AST or ALT ≥ 1.5 × ULN (but 
< 3 × ULN). Eight of the 9 patients had lipid abnormalities and 7 patients were receiving lipid-modifying 
medications. The activity of LAL (acid esterase) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ranged 
from 10.4 to 57 μmol/g/h at Screening (normal range 350 to 2000 μmol/g/h). Beta-galactosidase was 
assayed concurrently as a control lysosomal enzyme, and its levels were  between 109 to 233 μmol/g/h 
(normal range 100 to 400 μmol/g/h). 
3.2.1.3.  Individual study disposition: LAL-CL-02 
Of the 66 enrolled patients, 36 were randomized to sebelipase alfa and 30 to placebo, and all received 
at least 1 infusion of the study drug. Sixty-five patients completed the double-blind period, while one 
patient withdrew after experiencing a serious atypical infusion-associated reaction; this patient was later 
successfully rechallenged in the Open-label Period and then continued to receive sebelipase alfa. 
In the Open-label Extension Period, all 66 patients received sebelipase alfa. Seven patients discontinued 
open-label  treatment  (during  either  the  Open-label  Extension  Period  or  Expanded  Treatment  Period), 
including 2 patients who were lost to follow-up, 2 patients who withdrew consent, and 3 patients who 
received  between  200  and  208  weeks  of  treatment  in  the  study  prior  to  being  discontinued  by  the 
Sponsor when the study was terminated following approval of sebelipase alfa in all study regions.

Mean age at randomization was 16.62 years and median age was 13.35 years (range: 4.7 to 58.8 years). 
Of the 66 patients, 24 (36%) were < 12 years of age, 23 (35%) were between 12 and < 18 years of 
age, and 19 (29%) were ≥ 18 years of age at randomization. Most patients (83%) were white. Thirty-
three  patients  (50%)  were  male.  At  baseline,  24  patients  (36%)  were  receiving  a  lipid-lowering 
medication (LLM).  
All  66  patients  had  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  LAL-D.  Genetic  testing  showed  that  56  (85%)  of  the  66 
patients  had  at  least  one  copy  of  the  c.849G>A  common  exon  8  splice  junction  mutation  (21 
homozygotes, 35 compound heterozygotes); the remaining 10 patients had other mutations.  
The most frequently presenting abnormality at symptom onset was elevated serum transaminases (31 
patients, 47%), followed by hypercholesterolemia (8 patients, 12%).  
As required by the entrance criteria, all patients had an ALT > 1.5 × ULN at baseline; 17 patients (26%) 
had ALT ≥ 3 × ULN. Mean (SD) ALT was 100.47 (44.058) U/L and median ALT was 87.00 U/L (range: 
(35.7 to 212.3 U/L. All but 1 patient had elevated AST at baseline. Baseline gamma glutamyltransferase 
(GGT) was elevated in 27 patients (41%).  
Baseline assessments of lipids demonstrated marked dyslipidemia. Overall, 35 patients (53%) had LDL-
C  values  in  the  very  high  range  ≥  190  mg/dL).  Triglyceride  levels  were  ≥  200  mg/dL  in  13  patients

(20%).  Low  baseline  HDL-C  levels  were  noted  for  38  patients  (58%).  High  baseline  total  cholesterol 
levels were noted for 49 patients (74%).  
Mean (SD) baseline liver fat content, as assessed by MRI, was 8.48% (3.667%) for the 60 patients with 
available data. Mean (SD) liver volume for the 63 patients with available data was 1.44 (0.366) MN. 
3.2.1.4.  Individual study disposition: LAL-CL-03 
Nine patients were enrolled and treated, of which five (56%) patients completed the study and 4 (44%) 
patients were considered early terminated due to death. One other patient in France initially received 
emergency  therapy  with  sebelipase  alfa  under  a  Temporary  Use  Authorization,  ATU,  and  later 
transitioned onto Study LAL-CL05 at Week 40 before eventually enrolling in Study LAL-CL03 at Week 85.  
The study population included 5 male patients and 4 female patients, of which 4 patients were white, 1 
was black, and 1 patient was Asian. The median (range) age of patients at the time of initiation of dosing 
was 3.0 (1.1 to 5.8) months.  
Eight patients had confirmed growth failure within the first 6 months of life, with 7 having a decrease in 
weight percentile across at least 2 major centiles since birth. One other patient had other evidence of 
rapidly  progressive  disease  requiring  urgent  medical  intervention,  including  marked  abdominal 
distension  since  8  weeks  of  age;  a  medical  history  of  ascites,  vomiting,  and  diarrhea;  and  massive 
hepatosplenomegaly,  anemia,  hypoalbuminemia,  and  elevated  AST  and  lactate  dehydrogenase  at 
Screening. Median WFA percentile decreased from 81.33% at birth to 3.08% at the baseline assessment 
approximately 1 to 6 months later in the 8 patients with available data.  
All patients had marked abnormalities in liver biochemical parameters at baseline. Hepatomegaly and/or 
splenomegaly were evident on baseline physical examination in all 8 patients with available data. 
3.2.1.5.  Individual study disposition: LAL-CL-04 
This study enrolled 8 the 9 patients who completed Study LAL-CL01 were treated in Study LAL-CL04, 7 
of which continued to receive treatment in Study LAL-CL04 until they transitioned to commercial therapy; 
these 7 patients received between 224 and 260 weeks of sebelipase alfa in Study LAL-CL04 and were 
considered to have completed treatment in the study. One other patient was lost to follow-up. 
All patients were white and 6 patients (67%) were male. The mean age of the patients at the time of 
enrollment  in  Study  LAL-CL01  was  30.3  years.  Patients  initiated  treatment  in  Study  LAL-CL04 
approximately 9 to 28 weeks after completing their last dose in Study LAL-CL01.  
All  patients  had  previously  received  4  doses  of  sebelipase  alfa  in  Study  LAL-CL01.  The  time  between 
diagnosis of LAL-D and enrollment in Study LAL-CL04 ranged from 3.0 to 36.6 years.  
During the 9 to 28 weeks between the last infusion in Study LAL-CL01 and the baseline clinical laboratory 
assessments in Study LAL-CL04, the improvements in serum transaminases and serum lipids that had 
occurred in Study LAL-CL01 were reversed for all patients. At baseline, median ALT was 81.5 U/L, above 
normal range (ULN = 67 U/L), and median AST was 50.0 U/L, at upper end of the normal range (ULN = 
50 U/L). Six of the 8 patients had baseline ALT or AST levels > ULN, although most of these abnormalities 
were mild. No patient had a baseline AST > 1.5 × ULN and only 1 (13%) patient had a baseline ALT > 
1.5 × ULN.

3.2.1.6.  Individual study disposition: LAL-CL-06 
Thirty-one patients started sebelipase alfa, all at 1 mg/kg qow. Twenty-eight patients completed the 96-
week  treatment  period.  Of  the  3  patients  who  did  not  complete  the  treatment  period,  one  patient 
transitioned to commercial product and was considered to have completed the study. 
Twenty-five  of  the  28  patients  who  completed  the  96-week  treatment  period  continued  to  receive 
sebelipase alfa during the extended treatment period and 19 patients completed the 144-week extended 
treatment period. 
2The study population was 61% male and predominantly white (87%). There were no Japanese or other 
Asian patients. The FAS included 9 adults and 22 children, of whom 6 were in the 2 to < 4 year age 
group and 16 were in the 4 to 18 year age group. 
Baseline hepatic dysfunction was evidenced by elevated serum transaminases, increased liver and spleen 
volumes and fat content by MRI, and abnormal liver histopathology. Baseline ALT and AST levels were 
> 1.5 × ULN for 18 (58%) and 15 (48%) patients, respectively. Mean baseline ALT was 74.6 U/L and 
mean baseline AST was 77.5 U/L. Serum transaminases were higher in children than in adults. Mean 
baseline ALT levels were 121.8 U/L in the 2 to < 4 year age group, 72.1 U/L in the 4 to 18 year age 
group, and 47.5 U/L in the > 18 year age group. Individual ALT levels were > 1.5 × ULN for all 6 (100%) 
patients in the 2 to < 4 year age group (all of whom had levels > 2 × ULN), for 9 (56%) of 16 patients 
in the 4 to 18 year age group, and for 3 (33%) of 9 patients in the > 18 year age group. Mean baseline 
AST  levels  were  120.8  U/L,  79.7  U/L,  and  44.9  U/L,  respectively,  and  were >  1.5  ×  ULN  in 3  (50%) 
patients, 10 (63%) patients, and 2 (22%) patients in the respective age groups. 
Other biochemical markers of potential liver injury measured at baseline included GGT, total bilirubin, 
and alkaline phosphatase. While some patients were noted to have baseline levels of GGT, total bilirubin, 
and/or alkaline phosphatase that were above the age- and gender- appropriate ULN (as defined by the 
central laboratory), these biochemical markers were not routinely elevated at baseline. 
Mean  triglycerides  were  176.3  mg/dL  at  baseline,  and  18  (58%)  of  31  patients  had  a  baseline 
triglycerides level above the ULN. Mean LDL-C was 159.7 mg/dL at baseline, and 19 (63%) of 30 patients 
had a baseline LDL-C above the ULN. Mean HDL-C was 30.7 mg/dL at baseline, and levels were below 
the lower limit of normal (LLN) in 22 (71%) of 31 patients. 
Stunting at baseline was noted in 1 of 6 patients (17%) aged 2 to < 4 years and in 5 of 16 patients 
(31%) aged 4 to 18 years. Median weight-for-age (WFA) and stature-for-age (SFA) percentile scores 
were lower in patients 4 to 18 years (18.4% and 18.5%, respectively) than in patients 2 to < 4 years 
(27.8% and 27.9%, respectively). At baseline, the mean BMI in adult patients was 23.67 kg/m2 (median 
23.53 kg/m2). 
3.2.1.7.  Individual study disposition: LAL-CL-08 
A total of 10 patients enrolled and were treated. Six patients completed the study, all of whom continued 
to receive sebelipase alfa after study completion. Two patients were considered early terminated due to 
death. The other 2 patients remained in the study until it was terminated following approval of sebelipase 
alfa in all study regions; they then transitioned to commercial therapy. 
The study population included 5 male and 5 female patients, with 6 Asian patients (all non-Japanese; 4 
male and 2 female) and 1 patient each who reported as the following: white, American Indian or Alaskan 
native, Egyptian, and Turkish/Kurdish. The median (range) birth weight of patients was 3.330 (2.90 to 
5.04) kg. The median (range) age of the patients on the date of their first infusion of sebelipase alfa was 
2.83 (0.5 to 4.1) months. 
Assessment report

The mean (range) duration between a patient’s diagnosis with LAL-D and their first infusion of sebelipase 
alfa in Study LAL-CL08 was 13.6 (4 to 37) days. All 10 patients had LAL activity in dried blood spots 
and/or  PBMCs  that  was  below  the  normal  range  (or  classified  as  “affected”  or  “carrier”  for  results 
presented in nmol/punch/h). 
LIPA genetic mutation analysis was performed by the central laboratory for 5 of the 10 patients. Four of 
the 5 patients had documented causative mutations of the LIPA gene that were classified as pathogenic 
(including 1 patient with the c.894G> A mutation). One of the 5 patients with genotyping data did not 
have a documented causative mutation. Three patients, who were from a homogenous population in the 
UK, had a homozygous deletion affecting both alleles of the genes LIPA and Cholesterol 25-Hydroxylase 
(hereafter referred to as dual WGD) (data on file at Alexion). 
Median (range) AST was 99.5 (56 to 441) U/L in the 8 patients with available data and was elevated in 
6 of these patients. Median (range) ALT was 37 (28 to 248) U/L in the 9 patients with available data and 
was elevated in 3 of these patients. Elevations in GGT, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were 
reported in 6 patients, 3 patients, and 2 patients, respectively, of the 9 patients who had baseline data 
for  each  of  these  parameters.  On  baseline  physical  examination,  all  8  patients  had  a  palpable  liver. 
Among the 7 patients with baseline ultrasound data, the median (range) liver volume was 3.16 (0.1 to 
4.4) MN. 
Among patients with available data, baseline lipid abnormalities included elevated triglycerides (3 of 5 
patients), elevated LDL-C (2 of 3 patients), elevated total cholesterol (1 of 6 patients), and low HDL-C 
(1 of 4 patients). 
Coagulation parameter data were available for 6 patients at baseline and included a prolonged activated 
partial  thromboplastin  time  (aPTT)  (3  patients),  a  shortened  aPTT  (2  patients),  or  a  shortened 
prothrombin time (1 patient). Hematology data were available for 7 patients at baseline. Hemoglobin 
levels were low in 6 of the 7 patients, and platelet counts were low in 4 of the 7 patients. 
Baseline  assessments  showed  evidence  of  impaired  growth,  liver  dysfunction,  coagulopathy  and 
hematological abnormalities, and dyslipidemia. Baseline WFA percentile was low in most patients, with 
a median of 1.059 and a mean of 12.513. A pronounced deceleration in weight between birth and the 
baseline assessment was observed for all patients. Percentile scores for other anthropometric parameters 
(ACFA, HCFA, BMIFA, WFL/WFH, and LFA/HFA) were also low at baseline. 
3.2.2.  Cross-Study Result Analysis 
For the cross-study analysis the various patient groups for the individual studies were separated in two 
broad analysis pools (used for both cross-study efficacy and safety analyses), with Pool 1 representing 
studies in children and adults diagnosed with LAL-D, whereas Pool 2 representing studies of infants who 
developed growth failure or other evidence of a rapidly progressive course of LAL-D. 
A summary of the included studies and associated dosing regimens represented in each pool is presented 
in Table 2 below.

Table 18: Pooled Groups for Efficacy Analysis 
The Pooled FAS for each pooled group includes all patients included in the individual study full FAS as 
described in each individual protocol and SAP, and thus encompasses patients who were enrolled in a 
study and received at least 1 dose of sebelipase alfa. Therefore three different FAS groups were defined: 
• 
• 
• 
Pooled FAS 1: for Pooled Group 1. 
Pooled FAS 2: for Pooled Group 2. 
FAS 3: includes both Pooled FAS 1 and Pooled FAS 2. 
The  Pooled  Safety  Set  included  all  patients  who  received  at  least  1  dose  (partial  or  complete)  of 
sebelipase alfa, and the following stratifications were taken into account: 
• 
• 
Pooled Safety Set 1 includes data from subjects in Pooled Group 1. 
Pooled Safety Set 2 includes data from in Pooled Group 2. 
In addition select subgroup analyses were performed on the pooled safety set, as shown in Table 3.

Note  that  for  all  intents  and  purposes  the  Pooled  FAS  1  &  2  and  the  Pooled  SS  1  &  2  are 
identical. 
3.2.2.1.  Cross-Study Efficacy analysis 
A schematic overview of patient disposition for the total of 125 patients compromising the two analysis 
pools is presented in Figure 4. 
In Pooled FAS 1 the median age at first dose of sebelipase alfa was 13.49 years with the majority of 
patients in the age category < 18 years (69 patients; 65%). There were 58 male patients (55%) and 48 
female patients (45%). The majority of patients were white (91 patients; 86%) and 16 patients (15%) 
were Hispanic or Latino. Forty-six patients (43%) were using LLMs at baseline. 
In Pooled FAS 2 the median age at first dose was 3.02 months. There were 10 male patients (53%) and 
9 female patients (47%). Most of the patients enrolled were Asian in origin (7 patients; 44%), followed 
by white (5 patients; 31%) and no patients were Hispanic or Latino. Four patients (21%) were using 
LLMs at baseline.

Figure 4:Schematic Patient Disposition 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Overall, and taking into account the limitations inherent in the pooled cross-study nature of 
the data, the Pooled groups are internally more or less balanced in key demographics, save 
for group 1 where a majority of patients were of Caucasian descent. However, during the prior 
clinical evaluation, both pre- and post-approval, race was never found to be a differentiating 
factor in neither efficacy nor safety parameters. Therefore this imbalance is not regarded as 
a problematic issue. 
Survival analysis 
Survival analyses was done on the Pooled FAS 2 based on up to 5 year yearly data. It was based on the 
proportion of patients surviving to a certain age, with 12 months being a timepoint considered a clinically 
meaningful treatment response given the natural pathologic mortality of 6 months. 
The percentages of patients surviving to 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months of age were 79%, 68%, 65%, 
56%, and 43%, respectively. More patients survived in up to 36 months in the LAL-CL08 study versus 
the CL03 one, though follow-up in the former did not allow for analysis up to 60 months. 
Table 20 gives an overall overview of the proportions of patients surviving through the defined survival 
analysis points.

Rapporteur’s comments 
Survival  analysis  being  done  only  on  Pooled  FAS  2  is  a  logical  and  acceptable  approach. 
Infants with LAL-D usually present with the most aggressive and lethal form of the syndrome, 
whereas  those  that  present  with  the  pathology  during  later  stages  of  life  have  a  markedly 
lower mortality risk.

Overall the integrated analysis confirm what the data from the individual studies showed, and 
integrated analysis does not change this perception for the worse. 
Growth analysis –  Adults and Children 
In the Pooled FAS 1, mean (SD) changes from baseline in weight, height, and BMI of patients at the EOS 
were  11.974  (12.0149)  kg,  15.837  (9.8465)  cm,  and  2.20  (2.864)  kg/m2,  respectively  (analyses  of 
height include patients under 18 years of age only).  
Note that Studies LAL-CL02 and LAL-CL06 also included children and therefore increases in weight and 
BMI were smallest in Studies LAL-CL01/LAL-CL04, and postbaseline changes in height were not assessed 
in those latter studies. 
Mean changes from baseline for patients < 18 years of age and patients ≥ 18 years of age are shown in 
Table 21, showing that younger patients had an expected higher increase in weight and BMI parameters. 
Table 21: Summary of Subgroup Analysis by Age Category – Pooled FAS 1 - Growth 
Analyses  for  weight,  height,  and  body  mass  index-for-age  percentile  (WFA,  HFA,  BMIFA)  were  not 
undertaken for adult patients and thus only data of studies LAL-CL02 and CL06 were considered. 
In general, proportions of patients in the lowest percentile categories tended to decrease and proportions 
in  the  highest  categories  tended  to  increase,  suggesting  improvement,  as  shown  in  tables  Table  22, 
Table  23  &  Table  24.  Changes  from  baseline  in  normalized  anthropometric  data  percentiles  were 
generally consistent with observations for other anthropometric parameters

Table 23: HFA Percentile by Visit: Pooled FAS 1 
Table 24: BMIFA Percentile by Visit: Pooled FAS 1 
At baseline in Pooled FAS 1, 8 of 69 patients (12%) met the definition of underweight, defined as a WFA 
at least 2 SDs below the median WFA of a reference population, and 12 of 69 patients (17%) met the 
definition of stunting, defined as a HFA at least 2 SDs below the median HFA of a reference population. 
None of the patients met the definition of wasting, defined as a WFH at least 2 SDs below the median 
WFH of a reference population. At Month 24, there was no notable change in the proportion of patients 
who were underweight or had stunting. One patient (Patient 0101-035) in Study LAL-CL06 was observed 
with wasting and this condition continued until the last assessment. Another patient in Study LAL-CL06 
experienced transient wasting at Month 6. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Overall,  the integrated  analysis shows  a similar  picture  as  seen  in  the  individual  studies  in 
the past, confirming that a positive effect on growth can be achieved in children. 
Growth analysis – Infants 
Mean (SD) changes from baseline in weight, height and BMI of patients in Pooled FAS 2 at Week 144 
were 9.984 (1.4817) kg, 36.410 (4.9449) cm, and 2.94 (2.726) kg/m2, respectively. Height and weight 
increased gradually. Body mass index was higher at postbaseline visits than at baseline. Increases in 
height, weight, and BMI were generally greater in Study LAL-CL08 than in Study LAL-CL03.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 68/200 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Weight-for-age percentile was a key measure of growth in the LAL-CL03 and CL08 studies. In Pooled 
FAS 2 at baseline, 14 patients (78%) were in the age-normalized weight percentile category of 0% to 
10% and none were in the categories of 80% to 90% or 90% to 100%. Treatment with sebelipase alfa 
was associated with an improvement in WFA percentile with some patients reaching the 80th percentile 
or higher. Results were similar for HFA and BMIFA percentiles, see tables Table 25, Table 26 & Table 
27. 
Table 25: WFA Percentile by Visit: Pooled FAS 2 
Table 26: HFA Percentile by Visit: Pooled FAS 2 
Table 27: BMIFA Percentile by Visit: Pooled FAS 2 
Baseline percentile scores for normalized anthropometric data percentiles WFH (weight for height), ACFA 
(upper  arm  circumference  for  age),  and  HCFA  (head  circumference  for  age)  were  generally  low  on 
baseline and improved to various degrees on post-baseline and final assessments. 
At  Week  48,  about  50%  of  patients  showed  improvement  in  the  WFH  percentile  category,  4  patients 
remained in the same percentile category, and 2 patients had a decrease in percentile category. At Week

144, except for 1 patient who was in the percentile category of > 80% to 100% at baseline, all patients 
(9 patients) either remained in the same WFH percentile category or had a shift to a higher percentile 
category.  
Likewise,  median  changes  from  baseline  in  Z-scores  for  WFH,  ACFA  and  HCFA  showed  improvement 
under treatment. 
The results on stunting wasting and underweight are presented in Table 28. 
Table 28: Patients Underweight or With Stunting or Wasting: Pooled FAS 2 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Overall,  the  integrated  analysis  mirrors  the  experience  in  the  individual  past  studies  , 
confirming that a positive effect on growth and weight can be achieved in infants, though one 
should be cognisant of the fact that there is a strong paucity in the number of infant subject, 
which makes the results seen hopeful though lacking a measure of statistically confirmative 
rigour. 
Liver and Spleen Assessment & Biopsy – Children and Adults 
At baseline, mean (SD) liver volume in Pooled FAS 1 was 1.41 (0.384), mainly due to the influence os 
studies LAL-CL02 and CL06, as baseline parameters were near normal in LAL-CL01/CL04. Regardlessly, 
liver  volumes  decreased  as  early  as  Month  3  (in  the  8  patients  who  had  a  Month  3  assessment)  and 
continued through EOS with a mean change of -0.39 (0.267). 
Spleens were markedly enlarged at baseline, with a mean (SD) volume of 3.62 (3.047) MN and spleen 
volumes generally decreased during treatment with sebelipase alfa, with a mean change of -1.04 (1.295) 
at EOS. Spleen volumes showed more consistent and marked decreases in Studies LAL-CL02 and LAL-
CL06, where baseline spleen volumes were higher, than in Studies LAL-CL01/LAL-CL04. 
Liver fat content averaged approximately 8% at baseline and decreased during sebelipase alfa treatment, 
while spleen fat content averaged approximately 1% to 2% at baseline and fluctuated over time with no 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020

clear treatment effect. Patients whose liver fat content was at least 5% at baseline showed decreases in 
liver  fat  content  and  saw  decreases  that  were  almost  double  at  EOS  compared  to  those  observed  in 
Pooled FAS 1 as a whole. Changes in spleen fat content for patients with high fat content could not be 
analysed due to the low number of patients. 
Liver biopsy data was gleamed from studies LAL-CL02 and CL06, whereas LAL-CL08 had biopsy data but 
lacked  baseline  data.  Measured  values  were  Ishak  Stage,  portal  inflammation,  lobular  inflammation, 
macrovesicular  steatosis,  and  microvesicular  steatosis,  as  well  as  computer-assisted  morphometric 
quantified steatosis, collagen, fibrogenic cell, and macrophage percentages.  
In study LAL-CL02 biopsies were taken at baseline and at the end of the double-blind period. Optional 
biopsies were possible in the open label and open label extension phases. Biopsies were to be taken in 
adults, but could be optionally performed in children. If no baseline biopsy data was available a historical 
biopsy no older than 26 Weeks could be used instead if adequate for histological examination. A total of 
29 subjects had baseline data available and 26 of them had at least one post-baseline liver biopsy.  
The protocol for Study LAL-CL06 foresaw liver biopsies to be obtained at Screening and Week 48 ± 2 
weeks (or earlier for patients who had at least 20 weeks of treatment but discontinued the study prior 
to Week 48). A historical biopsy obtained within 26 weeks prior to Screening and adequate for histological 
examination could be used in lieu of a Screening biopsy. Optional liver biopsies could be done at Week 
96.  
Baseline liver biopsies were obtained for all 31 patients enrolled and treated with sebelipase alfa, and 
postbaseline liver biopsies were obtained for 30 of these patients  
Ishtak  stage  scoring  was determined  based  on  histopathological  assessment of  the liver  biopsies  and 
ranged between a value of 0-6, whereby each successive score reflects more scarring than the preceding 
stage. 
At  baseline,  3  of  59  patients  (5%)  had  Ishak  scores  of  0  (no  fibrosis);  15  patients  (25%)  had  Ishak 
scores of 6 (probable or definite cirrhosis). Ishak scores improved by Month 12, when 9 patients (24%) 
had Ishak scores of 0 and 7 patients (18%) had Ishak scores of 6. A total of 47% of subjects had a ≥ 1 
point reduction (improvement) in Ishak scores from baseline to Month 12, 39% had no change, and 14% 
had  a  ≥  1  point  increase (worsening).  As  shown  in Table  29,  shift  analysis  indicated  that there  was 
relatively more improvement than worsening in the pooled FAS 1. 
Table 29: Shifts in Ishak Scores: Pooled FAS 1 
Measurements  of  lobular  inflammation,  macrovesicular  steatosis,  microvaesicular  steatosis  and  portal 
inflammation are shown in tables 30-33.

Table 33:Liver Biopsy Assessments: Portal Inflammation: Pooled FAS 1 
CD68 immunostaining revealed a tendency for the macrophages ratio to improve with a mean change 
of  -3.386  (SD:  5.3915)  from  baseline  to  month  12,  whereas  histological  steatosis  assessment  also 
indicated a mean decrease of -5.714 (SD: 13.2958). 
In general, the overall trend, as seen in both studies LAL-CL02  and CL06, is supportive of improvement 
of  progression  of  liver  damage  in  patients  treated  with  sebelipase  alfa  for  12  months  compared  to 
baseline. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Overall, integrated analysis of liver and spleen parameters showed a fairly nebulous picture 
with no immediate picture of a clear improvement. Shift tables did however show that there 
was generally more improvement, but in actual clinical practice these improvements seem to 
be limited. Given that no clear line can be seen in either the individual study results, nor in 
the  integrated  pooled  analysis,  it  is  difficult  to  attach  any  meaningful  clinical  benefit 
assessments these findings. 
Liver and Spleen Assessment – Infants 
Measurements of change of liver and spleen volume using MRI imaging were only scantly available for 
infants  and  of  insufficient  quantity  to  allow  statistical  inference.  Ultrasound  volume  estimations  were 
more readily available, with mean baseline liver and spleen volumes being 3 and 6 MN respectively. Liver 
volumes  had  a  mean  change  of  -1.24  (.888)  MN  versus  baseline  at  EOS,  while  spleen  volumes  were 
reduced by a mean of -3.30 (3.756) MN. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Liver and spleen parameters were more limited and more crude in infants, though the overall 
results do seem to indicate a trend towards improvement for both.

Biological parameters – Children and Adults 
Generally treatment induced a progressive decrease in ALT and AST in the Pooled FAS 1 group, with a 
proportion  of  patients  seeing  a  normalization  of  the  transaminase  levels  (Table  34).  Shifts  from 
abnormal levels to worse abnormal levels were quite rare. 
Table 34: Normalization of Serum Transaminase Levels: Pooled FAS 1 
GGT levels decreased from an overall mean of 50.15 (48.6) U/L with a mean amount of 18.49 U/L, which 
was maintained throughout the assessment period, and overall level normalizations increased. 
Table 35: Normalization of Serum GGT Levels: Pooled FAS 1 
The results for total bilirubin were more variable and decreases tended to vary according to study. The 
majority of patients did however not experience much improvement in bilirubin levels with treatment. 
Likewise, alkaline phosphatase level results were also quite heterogeneous between individual studies, 
though an overall normalization trend was observed. 
No significant changes in albumin levels were apparent, given that most patients had normal levels at 
baseline and maintained those during the assessment period.

Rapporteur’s comments 
The  integrated  analysis  results  mostly  echoed  the  results  already  seen  in  the  individual 
studies  with  clear  improvements  in  ALT,  AST  and  GGT;  and  less  clear  results  in  other 
parameters. 
Biological parameters – Infants 
Similar to the changes in Pooled FAS 1, an initial decrease in serum transaminase levels and subsequent 
maintenance of decreased levels was seen in Pooled FAS 2. There was a general increase of proportions 
of infants with normalized levels and improvement shifts generally occurred more than worsening. 
In infants there was a general trend towards improvements in GGT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and 
albumin  levels.  Proportional  shifts  to  normalization  could  generally  not  be  interpreted  due  to  the  too 
small sample sizes. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
Results in infants mostly echoed those in adults, though with a trend of somewhat positive 
improvements in non-ALT, -AST and -GGT parameters. 
Serum Lipids – Children and Adults 
High density lipoprotein cholesterol showed evident increases were evident at Month 3 which continued 
through  EOS,  with  a  mean  overall  increase  of  9.63  mg/dL  (SD:  8.846).  Low  density  lipoprotein 
cholesterol  tended  to  increase  at  the  Month  1  timepoint  but  then  decreased  from  Month  3  until  EOS 
onward. Non-HDL-C and LDL-C mirrored these patterns. 
At baseline less than half of the overall patients had normal ranges of tryglicerides, HDL-C and LDL-C; 
generally these proportions increased during treatment.

Rapporteur’s comments 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 75/200 
 
 
  
  
 
The integrated cross-study analysis did generally echo the same observations already made 
in  the  individual  studies,  namely  that  HDL-C  and  LDL-C  levels  generally  improved  under 
treatment, with a sizeable number of patients achieving normalisation. 
Serum Lipids – Infants 
Levels  of  HDL-C  generally  increased  with  sebelipase  alfa  treatment,  and  triglycerides  generally 
decreased. Levels of LDL-C generally appeared to decrease, but sample sizes were too small to allow 
conclusions to be drawn. Conclusions on overall normalization were uncertain because of small sample 
sizes. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
The trend in Pooled FAS 2 echoes the observations in the Pooled FAS 1, but as noted by the 
Applicant already, the numbers were too few to make any conclusive deduction. 
QOL assessments - All 
Overall, there was too little data to have any meaningful analysis of QOL responses on the FACIT, CLDQ, 
PedsQL and Denver II questionnaires. 
Dietary change assessments - All 
Overall, interpretation of data was not possible to due high variability and small sample sizes. 
Dose and Dose Changes – Children and Adults 
Across  the  sebelipase  alfa  clinical  program,  patients  could  be  considered  for  dose  escalation  if  they 
exhibited a suboptimal clinical response to treatment based on specific protocol-defined criteria.  
In  regards  to  the  current  cross-study  comparison  exercise,  the  MAH  conducted  a  medical  review  of 
efficacy data to identify the key clinical findings that were most often observed in patients who received 
a dose increase from the protocol-defined starting dose to evaluate whether this dose escalation was 
associated with a change in the clinical course for these patients. The efficacy parameters included in 
this review represent the primary disease manifestations contributing to the significant burden of disease 
and reduced life expectancy across the disease spectrum. 
Dose changes were rarely used in the LAL-CL01/04 study, and as such analysis was only done on changes 
in studies LAL-CL02 and CL06, both of which had a starting dose of 1 mg/kg qow. In LAL-CL02 dose 
escalation  to  3  mg/kg  qow  was  permitted  for  patients  who  met  protocol-defined  criteria,  and  dose 
reduction to 0.35 mg/kg qow was permitted in the event of poor tolerability. These dose adaptations 
were  only  permitted  in  the  open-label  period.  In  LAL-CL06  dose  escalation  to  3  mg/kg  qow,  and 
subsequent  escalation to 3  mg/kg  qw,  were  permitted  for  patients  who  met  protocol-defined  criteria. 
Dose reduction, to a minimum dose of 0.35 mg/kg qow, was permitted in the event of poor tolerability. 
Overall,  the  starting  dose  of  1  mg/kg  qow  demonstrated  a  positive  effect  on  clinically  relevant 
parameters: serum transaminases, lipids, and in some children, WFA. Most dose escalations to 3 mg/kg 
qow  were  implemented  after  1.5  years  of  treatment  or  longer  and  were  initiated  in  response  to  an 
increase in serum transaminase levels, an increase in serum lipids, or a decrease in WFA in children. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 76/200 
 
 
  
  
 
Following the dose escalation, most patients had improvement in serum transaminases and lipids that 
were  sustained  until  the  end  of  the  study.  However,  most  children  remained  below  the  age-related 
median  WFA  despite  showing  improvements  in  other  clinical  parameters.  Four  patients  underwent 
subsequent dose escalations to 3 mg/kg qw in an effort to optimize disease management. 
Table 37 provides an overview on the doses administered and the number of patients that received said 
doses: 
Table 37: Sebelipase Alfa Doses: Pooled Safety Set 1 
Subgroup analyses did not did not reveal any impact of liver cirrhosis status at baseline, race, or race 
group on dose modifications. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
The  findings  in  the  integrated  analysis support  the  notion  already  noticed  in  the  individual 
trails  that  the  majority  of  patients  is  adequately  managed  with  a  1  mg/kg  qow  dose. 
Upregulation of doses up to 3mg/kg qow have been relatively frequently used and show that 
there is a certain dose proportionality in reponse. Even higher doses have been administer in 
the clinical programme, but these events were relatively rare and the vast majority of patients 
could be adequately managed with either 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg qow. 
Based on these findings, in combination with the safety findings, the MAH proposes to adapt 
the posology to allow up-regulation to 3 mg/kg qow based on clinical response. From a clinical 
efficacy point of view this could be acceptable given the improved response in patients that 
failed to be adequately managed under a lower dose. 
Dose and Dose Changes – Infants 
Across  the  sebelipase  alfa  clinical  program,  patients  could  be  considered  for  dose  escalation  if  they 
exhibited a suboptimal clinical response to treatment based on specific protocol-defined criteria.

a dose increase from the protocol-defined starting dose to evaluate whether this dose escalation was 
associated with a change in the clinical course for these patients. The efficacy parameters included in

and reduced life expectancy across the disease spectrum.

In LAL-CL03 initial dose escalation was undertaken until the baseline dose of 1mg/kg w was reached 
(these initial escalations are not included in the cross-study analysis) after which a dose escalation to 3 
mg/kg qw, and subsequent escalation to 5 mg/kg qw, were permitted for patients who met protocol-
defined  criteria.  Reduction  in  dosing  frequency  from  qw  to  qow  were permitted  for  patients  who  met 
protocol-defined criteria. In a similar vein, patients in study LAL-CL08 patients initiated treatment at a 
dose of 1 mg/kg qw and dose linear escalations to 3 mg/kg qw, 5 mg/kg qw and 7.5 mg/kg qw were 
permitted for patients who met protocol-defined criteria. Furthermore, reductions in dosing frequency 
from qw to qow were permitted for patients who met protocol-defined criteria. 
Table 38 shows the number of patients that received individual dose levels at least once during their 
study participation. 
Table 38: Sebelipase Alfa Doses: Pooled Safety Set 2 
A medical review was undertaken to key contributors to morbidity and mortality in infants with rapidly 
progressive LAL-D, such as there are:  
•  Growth parameters: WFA, LFA, and mid-upper arm circumference  
• 
Liver parameters: ALT, AST  
•  Serum lipid parameters: Total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL-C.  
Suboptimal  clinical  response  in  predefined  parameters  for  weight  gain,  based  on  WFA  growth  charts, 
was  the  most  frequently  observed  clinical  finding  among  the  patients  who went  on  to  receive  a  dose 
escalation  to  5  mg/kg  qw,  the  latter  which  was  associated  with  clear  improvement  in  growth,  as 
evidenced by increases in WFA percentile. While other factors such as dietary changes or acute illness 
may  have  had  some  impact  on  growth,  these  cannot  account  for  the  consistent  and  sustained 
improvement observed in most infants receiving a dose escalation to 5 mg/kg qw. Serum transaminases 
and serum lipids also generally improved after dose escalation to 5 mg/kg qw.  
There were 3 patients in LAL-CL08 whom presented with dual WGD (whole-gene deletion), characterized

had  clinical  courses  that  were  complicated  by  persistent  high  antidrug  antibody  (ADA)/neutralizing 
antibody  titers,  and  all  3 patients  required  a  dose  escalation  to  5  mg/kg  qw.  Two  patients  had  some 
changes in clinical parameters consistent with improvement in the underlying disease at the dose of 5 
mg/kg qw, while 1 patient failed to improve consistently and received a further dose escalation to 7.5 
mg/kg  qw.  Two  of  the  patients  with  dual  WGD  received  BMT  or  HSCT.  Following  the  transplant,  the

Investigator was able to reduce the dose of sebelipase alfa to 1 or 3 mg/kg qw to maintain an optimal 
clinical response. 
Finally, subgroup analyses did not reveal any impact of race or race group on the dose modifications. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
The  findings  in  the  infant  population  in  a  way  echoed  the  findings  in  the  Pooled  FAS  1 
population,  with  dose  increases  up  to  7.5  mg/kg  qw  having  been  deployed.  Overall  dose 
escalations  were  associated  with  clear  improvements  in  those  infants  that  failed  to 
adequately respond to the standard 1 mg/kg qw dosing. 
Proportionally  more  infants  seem  to  need  dose  upregulation,  which  can  be  considered  a 
logical consequence that early-onset LAL-D is generally a more aggressive and severe form 
of the syndrome compared to the late-onset form. 
Based on these findings, in combination with the safety findings, the MAH proposes to adapt 
the posology to allow up-regulation to 5 mg/kg qw based on clinical response in infants. 
From a clinical efficacy point of view it is difficult to either support or decline this suggestion. 
Overall the total population of LAL-D infants was very limited, making rigorous analysis and 
decision making all but impossible. It is agreed that some patients needed dose upregulation 
past the currently approved 3 mg/kg qw upper limit, and that these dose increases seem to 
aid said patients in maintaining a satisfactory response. 
On the other hand, 3 out of 9 subjects whom received 5+ mg/kg qw doses were the dual WGD 
subjects whom have shown to have a far worse clinical reponse than single deletion patients. 
One of these patients even needed to further escalate, whereas two patients required HSCT 
or BMT despite being on high dose sebelipase alfa. Thus in total only 6 ‘regular’ subjects were 
subjected to the 5 mg/kg qw dose ans it is not clear how many PY in exposure these 6subjects 
represent. 
ADA findings – All 
Overall infants showed a greater proportional development of ADAs compared to adults/children. 
The number of ADA positive patients in Pooled FAS 1 and 2 were too small to allow impact analysis on 
the efficacy endpoints. 
As noted, 3 patients in Study LAL-CL08 presented with dual WGD and development of high ADA titers 
which was associated with decreased WFA and other parameters suggesting failure to thrive. These 
3 patients required dose escalations of sebelipase alfa to achieve maximum clinical benefit. They also 
received treatments including immunomodulatory therapy with rituximab or bortezomib; one of these 
patients then had an HSCT and one had a BMT. After the HSCT/BMT, ADA titers decreased and sebelipase 
alfa was resumed at a lower dosage regimen. The third patient continued to receive sebelipase alfa 5 
mg/kg  qw  and  continued  to  have  high  titers  of  ADAs.  This  patient  has  improved  clinically  with 
bortezomib, but is being prepared for an eventual BMT (data on file at Alexion). 
Given the observations made and the worry that this particular genetic combination of dual deletion may 
represent a subpopulation that is at increased risk of immunogenic responses with cnsequences reduced 
efficacy, the applicant was asked to do a retrospective integrated analysis of immunology, with specific 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 79/200 
 
 
  
  
focus  on  the  disease-underlying  genetic  mutations,  in  paediatric  patients  enrolled  in  the  trails  of  the 
clinical development programme. 
However, as reported by the Applicant, most studies do lack genetic data and this in combination with 
the very limited numbers of infant patients make it impossible to do such analysis, and that the relative 
contribution  of  either  genetic  defect  to  the  observed  phenotype  and  the  response  to  sebelipase  alfa 
enzyme replacement therapy, the LIPA gene deletion or the deletion of the neighboring Cholesterol 25-
Hydroxylase gene, is unknown at this stage. 
Subgroup analyses 
In the Pooled FAS 1 analyses it appeared that mostly age and liver cirrhosis status had an influence on 
efficacy parameters (mainly on chemistry laboratory findings). Neither dose, race or race group showed 
any clear influence. 
In infants generally the numbers were too small to allow any inference for the planned analyses. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Overall the findings in the subgroup analyses were difficult to interpret given the generally 
low  numbers  and  often  heterogeneous  findings.  Though  age  and  liver  cirrhosis  parameters 
appeared to show a trend of influence in adults it is impossible to adhere any clear clinical 
inference to these findings. 
Dosing and long-term effect 
In  the  overall  clinical  development  and  post-approval  investigation  of  sebelipase  alfa  19  non-infant 
patients received a dose escalation to a maximum dose of 3 mg/kg qow and 4 patients received a dose 
escalation  to  a  maximum  dose  of  3  mg/kg  qw.  The  dosing  regimens  used  by  the  largest  numbers  of 
patients in Pooled FAS 1 were 1 mg/kg qow and 3 mg/kg qow, and the maximum dosage used in any 
study on children and adults was  3 mg/kg qw. 
The  general  reason  given  for  these  dose  escalations  was  suboptimal  clinical  response  where  by  dose 
escalation  usually  led  to  improvement  in  one  or  more  of  the  key  clinical  parameters.  In  children  and 
adults, the overall exposure to dosages of 3 mg/kg qow or higher was 53 PYs compared to 293 PYs of 
exposure to 1 mg/kg qow. 
In view of the number of patients with dose escalation above 1 mg/kg qow in the study most closely 
resembling the general population in LAL-D, the significant overall exposure to dosages above 1 mg/kg 
qow, and the clinical improvements observed in most of the patients with dose escalation to 3 mg/kg 
qow, the MAH proposes to adjust the recommended dose for children and adults from 1 mg/kg qow to 
1 to 3 mg/kg qow, given the absence of any safety signals. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
The overall exposure to 3 mg/kg qow in children and adults was about 5.5 times smaller than 
to  the  previously  approved  1  mg/kg  qow  dosing.  However,  given  the  fact  that  patient-
numbers for an ultra-rare disease will always be low it seems not entirely avoidable that a 
large  discrepancy  like  this  will  be  noted  when  the  majority  of  patients  can  be  adequately 
controlled on one dose. Given the fact that there are indeed patients that  continue to have 
progressive  worsening  of  their  condition  on  the  ‘normal’  dose  level,  for  which  the  vast 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 80/200 
 
 
  
  
majority achieved control at the 3 mg/kg qow level, and in light of the acceptable safety at 
this dosage it is considered acceptable to increase the upper limit of treatment in adults and 
children to 3 mg/kg qow if circumstances do so require. 
In infants, investigators were allowed to escalate the dose of sebelipase alfa beyond the 1 mg/kg qw 
initial dose. As infants represent the most critically ill patients they received higher doses of sebelipase 
alfa than children and adults, and underwent more frequent protocol-allowed dose modifications. The 
dosing  regimen  used  by  the  largest  numbers  of  patients  in  Pooled  FAS  2  was  1  mg/kg  qw,  followed 
closely by 3 mg/kg qw, and the maximum dosage used in any study on infants was 7.5 mg/kg qw. The 
general  reason  given  for  dose  escalations  was  suboptimal  clinical  response  whereby  dose  escalations 
were mostky followed by improvement in one or more of the key clinical parameters. 
In infants, the overall exposure to dosages of 5 mg/kg qw or higher was 14 PYs compared to 26 PYs of 
exposure to 3 mg/kg qw, without clear safety signals in the patient groups treated with higher dosages. 
In  view  of  the  frequent  dose  escalations  above  3  mg/kg  qw  based  upon  maintaining  optimal  clinical 
response,  and  the  significant  overall  exposure  to  dosages  above  3  mg/kg  qw,  and  the  clinical 
improvements observed in most of the patients with dose escalation to 5 mg/kg qw, the MAH suggests 
adjusting the recommended dose for infants with rapidly progressive LAL-D from 1 to 3 mg/kg qw to 1 
to 5 mg/kg qw based upon clinical response. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
As noted before, a third of the patients exposed to 5+ mg/kg qw sebelipase alfa in the Pooled 
FAS 2 were of the ‘non-regular’ dual WGD phenotype, which seems to be characterised by a 
worse clinical profile and worse response to treatment. Thus only 6 ‘regular’ patients have 
had need of exposure to higher dosings and it is not clear how many PY of exposure these six 
patients represent. 
Therefore an increase of the maximal posology in infant patients is not supported based on 
the raw data available. 
On  the  other  hand,  given  the  aggressive  nature  of  early-onset  LAL-D  and  the  fact  that  in 
general  the  safety  of  the  higher  sebelipase  alfa  dosing  seems  to  be  fine  (though  with  the 
caveat that the numbers of patients and thus data are very limited), it may still be prudent to 
allow admission of a higher dose of product in those patients that do not achieve control on 
the current maximal dose of 3 mg/kg qw. 
In this case the Applicant should also provide a dosing guideline that clearly explains how to 
escalate and de-escalate the dose as necessary, and also provides guidance on how to proceed 
with patients that are not well controlled even on the significantly higher dose of 5 kg/mg 
qow.  
Among children and adults in the LAL-D clinical programme, 85% of patients received sebelipase alfa for 
at least 130 weeks for a total of 348.09 PYs of exposure, with a maximum duration of exposure of 60.48 
months. Among infants, 68% of patients received sebelipase alfa for at least 52 weeks and 47% for at 
least 156 weeks. Infants received a total of 47.73 PYs of exposure, with a maximum duration of exposure 
of  60.19 months. 
In these long-running studies, sustained improvements were observed in multiple efficacy endpoints and 
here  was  no  evidence  of  tolerance  or  of  loss  of  efficacy  over  time,  with  the  possible  exception  of  3 
patients in Study LAL-CL08 who had dual WGD and required high doses of sebelipase alfa in order to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020

achieve maximum clinical benefit. Overall, the data support the long-term efficacy of sebelipase alfa for 
the treatment of LAL-D in infants, children and adults. 
4.  Clinical Safety aspects 
4.1.  Safety analysis of the completed study LAL-EA01 
Methods & Results– analysis of data submitted 
The 6 patients of the FAS had a combined total of 67 sebelipase alfa infusions, with a median of 11 per 
patient  [min,max:  8,15).  All  infusions  were  of  a  dose  level  of  1mg/kg  qow  and  no  rate  changes  of 
interruptions  occurred.  One  incomplete  infusion  was  also  registered,  where  infusion  interruption 
happened due to an infusion-associated reaction. 
Table 39 provides an overview of the TEAE landscape as noted in this study: 
Table 39: Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
As noted no deaths, TESEAs or discontinuations occurred and treatment-related TEAEs were reported 
for  4  subjects,  including  1  subject  who  experienced  treatment-related  IARs  during  2  study  infusions. 
These  IARs  either  resolved  spontaneously  or  were  managed  by  interruption  of  the  infusion  and 
administration of antihistamines, and the subject continued to receive treatment in the study. 
A summary of TEAEs by SOC is provided in table below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 82/200 
 
 
  
  
 
Table 40: Summary of the Number (Percentage) Subjects Reporting Treatment 
As  noted,  four  subjects  experienced  treatment-related  events.  Of  these,  one  subject  experienced  3 
treatment-related TEAEs of infusion-related reaction, one of which was further characterized as an IAR. 
All other treatment-related TEAEs reported in this study were not considered IARs. Treatment-related 
TEAEs reported by more than 1 subject included fatigue (2 subjects) and ALT increased (2 subjects). 
No severe TEAEs were reported, though 2 of 6 subjects experienced events of mild severity. All other 
subjects had at most moderate TEAEs. 
One subject reported an IAR of rash and an infusion-related reaction, the former which resolved naturally 
and  the  latter  which  was  managed  by  a  temporary  interruption  of  infusion  and  anti-histamine 
administration. The subject was also found to be ADA-negative at these times. 
No subjects did at any time test positive for ADAs during treatment. 
There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  mean  changes  in  any  laboratory  parameter  over  time that  would 
suggest a safety concern for treatment with sebelipase alfa, and no haematological abnormalities were 
reported in the study. 
Serum ferritin was essentially unchanged on treatment, with 5 subjects having a serum ferritin level that 
was within normal range at baseline and remained normal through EOT, and 1 subject having a serum 
ferritin level that was elevated at baseline and throughout the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 83/200 
 
 
  
  
 
Four  subjects,  all  enrolled  at  one  clinical  site,  had  abnormalities  in  liver  and/or  lipid  parameters  that 
were reported by the investigator as TEAEs. These laboratory TEAEs included ALT increased (4 subjects), 
AST increased (2 subjects), blood cholesterol increased (3 subjects), LDL-c increased (3 subjects) and/or 
GGT increased (1 subject). A majority of these laboratory abnormalities were assessed as unrelated to 
treatment.  Treatment-related  TEAEs  were  reported  for  2  pediatric  subjects,  both  of  whom  had  a 
treatment-related TEAE of ALT increased. 
Two  subjects  had  a  palpable  liver  at  baseline,  and  both  subjects  had  a  reduction  in  liver  size  during 
treatment with sebelipase alfa, with the palpable area decreasing from a baseline up to 50%. One other 
subject in the study had a liver and spleen that were non-palpable at baseline, but were reported as 
palpable at Day 87 and continued to be palpable to the same extent at the EOT visit. 
Finally, There were no trends in vital sign data that would suggest a safety concern for sebelipase alfa. 
Discussion 
No deaths or serious TEAEs were reported, and no subject discontinued from the study due to a TEAE. 
All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, and most events were considered unrelated to treatment. 
Treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 4 subjects in the study. One subject experienced events that 
were characterized as IARs. This subject experienced IARs at 2 study infusions, including a mild infusion 
site  rash  at  Day  29  and  a  moderate  infusion-related  reaction  at  Day  80.  The  rash  resolved  without 
medical intervention, and the infusion-related reaction was managed by interruption of the infusion and 
administration of antihistamine. The subject continued to receive treatment in the study. 
None  of  the  5  subjects  with  post-baseline  immunogenicity  data  tested  positive  for  ADAs  following 
initiation of treatment with sebelipase alfa. 
Clinical laboratory, vital sign, and physical examination results did not indicate any clinically meaningful 
trends that would present a safety concern for sebelipase alfa.

LAL-CL06, LAL-CL03 and LAL-CL08 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
4.2.1.  Overall Background 
This integrated safety analysis provides the complete characterization of the safety profile of sebelipase 
alfa  in  the  treatment  of  lysosomal  acid  lipase  deficiency  (LAL-D),  a  serious  and  life-threatening 
multisystem storage disorder caused by a marked decrease or absence in lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) 
activity,  and  discusses  the  cross-study  safety  observations  as  made  in  the  completed  clinical  study 
programme (Table 26). 
This integrated analysis includes the safety data gleamed from a total of 125 patients (19 infants, 69 
children and 37 adults), which were separate in two pooled safety groups for this exercise: Pooled SS1 
(including all children and adults) and Pooled SS 2 (including all infants). Note that patients form the 
US-based expanded access protocol LAL-EA01 were not included for safety analysis.

4.2.2.  Exposure 
4.2.2.1.  Overall Exposure – Children & Adults 
The median duration of exposure for children and adults was 35.515 months cumulating in a total of 
348.09 patient years (PY) of exposure. A similar proportion of patients were exposed to sebelipase alfa 
during  discrete  time  periods  through  approximately  3  years  (156  weeks)  after  initial  exposure. 
Thereafter, the cumulative exposure decreased as only Studies LAL-CL04 and LAL-CL02 were ongoing 
after that timepoint. 
A  summary  of  exposure  by  dose,  study  and  overall  is  provided  in  Table  45.  Note  that  due  to  dose

4.2.2.2.  Overall Exposure – Infants 
The median duration of exposure for infants was 35.61 months with 47.73 PYs of exposure. All patients 
were exposed to sebelipase alfa up to the first 4 weeks of treatment. Subsequently, a similar proportion 
of patients were exposed to sebelipase alfa during discrete time periods through approximately 3 years 
(156  weeks)  after  initial  exposure.  Thereafter,  the  cumulative  exposure  decreased  primarily  due  to 
patients completing Study LAL-CL08.

Rapporteur’s comments 
Overall, the safety analysis by dose does indeed seem to indicate that higher dosings do not 
have a markedly worse safety profile than the currently approved posologies. 
4.2.4.2.  TEAEs – Children & Adults 
The  majority  of  patients  (95/106;  90%)  experienced  at  least  1  TEAE  in  the  SOC  Infections  and 
infestations.  The  most  frequently  reported  (>  40%  of  patients)  TEAEs  by  Preferred  Term  were 
nasopharyngitis  (52/106  patients;  49%),  headache  (47/106  patients;  44%),  and  pyrexia  (45/106 
patients; 42%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 99/200 
 
 
  
  
 
About 54% of patients experienced a TEAE during or within the 4 hours after infusion, with the TEAEs 
that were reported by Preferred Term in 5 or more patients being urticaria (6%); pyrexia, abdominal 
pain, nausea, and vitamin D deficiency (5% each). 
A total of 70% of patients experienced at least 1 TEAE between 4 and 24 hours after the infusion, with 
those events occurring in at least 5 patients being headache (12%); nasopharyngitis (11%); diarrhea 
(10%); pyrexia (8%); epistaxis, abdominal pain, (8%); upper abdominal pain, vomiting (7%); cough, 
nausea, oropharyngeal pain (6%); dizziness, and Vitamin D deficiency (5%). 
Severe TEAEs were experienced by 13% of subjects, with none being individually reported in 5 or more 
patients. 
A  total  of  9  patients  were  found  to  be  ADA  positive  at  one  or  more  timepoints  during  the  respective 
studies,  having  a  total  of  33  events  (12.48  PYs  of  exposure):  5  patients  who had  low  ADA  titers  (11 
events; 13.09 PYs of exposure) and the 4 patients who had high ADA titers (22 events; 12.19 PYs of 
exposure).  This  is  in  comparison  with  the  other  105  patients  with  ADA  negativity,  whom  reported  a 
combined total of 2517 events (7.29 PYs of exposure). 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Overall, the integrated safety analysis did not expose untoward findings that deviate from the 
observations made during the analysis of the individual trails. 
4.2.4.3.  TEAEs – Infants 
Most  patients  experienced  a  TEAE  in  the  SOCs  Gastrointestinal  disorders  and  Investigations  (18/19 
patients;  95%).  The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  (>  50%  of  patients)  by  Preferred  Term  were 
diarrhea, vomiting, pyrexia (79% each), gastroenteritis, cough (58% each), rhinitis, diaper dermatitis, 
and  tachycardia  (53%  each).  A  greater  proportion  of  patients  in  Study  LAL-CL08  were  reported  with 
most of these events due to the number of events reported for the 3 patients with dual WGD. However, 
generally there were marginal differences in the incidence of these events when patients without dual 
WGD (n = 16) were compared to the overall population (n = 19). 
About 79% of infant patients experienced a TEAE during infusion and within 4 hours after the EOI. The 
TEAEs  that  were  reported  by  Preferred  Term  in  2  or  more  patients  were  pyrexia  (63%);  vomiting, 
tachycardia (47% each); urticaria (32% each); agitation, irritability (26% each); diarrhea, rash (21% 
each);  respiratory  distress,  tachypnea,  pruritus,  device-related  sepsis  (16%  each);  teething,  body 
temperature increased, device-related infection, rash pruritic, anemia, and pallor (11% each). 
In total 95% of subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE between 4 and 24 hours after the infusion. No clear 
pattern existed in the types of TEAEs that were reported in 2 or more patients. 
Severe TEAEs were experienced by 84% of subjects, with those reported in 2 or more patients being 
tachycardia (21%); anemia, respiratory distress (16% each); dehydration, device-related infection, and 
sepsis (11% each). 
A  total  of  10  patients  presented  with  ADA  positivity,  cumulating  a  total  of  883  events  (37.19  PYs  of 
exposure). A higher rate of exposure was also reported for the 5 patients who had high ADA titers (601 
events; 42.87 PYs of exposure) compared to the 5 patients who had low ADA titers (282 events; 29.01 
PYs of exposure). For the remaining 18 patients with ADA negativity, 937 events (39.07 PYs of exposure) 
were reported.

Note that the rate of exposure for the 3 patients with dual WGD was slightly higher than that of the 7 
patients without dual WGD during an ADA positive period; 305 events (39.67 PYs of exposure) compared 
with 578 events (36.01 PYs of exposure), respectively. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Overall, the integrated safety analysis did not expose untoward findings that deviate from the 
observations made during the analysis of the individual trails. 
Note  that  based  on  the  3  cases  of  dual  WGD  patients  and  associated  more  complicated 
immune responses a new safety signal was opened in the latest PSUR (DLP 28 Aug 2019). 
4.2.4.4.  Treatment-related TEAEs –Children & Adults 
Across studies, 35% of patients experienced a treatment-related TEAE. Those that were reported in 5 or 
more patients were urticaria (7%), abdominal pain (6%), and fatigue (5%). 
About 18 % of patients experienced at least 1 treatment-related TEAE during or 4 hours after infusion. 
The only such TEAE that was reported by 5 or more patients was urticaria (6%). 
Around  12%  of  Pooled  SS  1  patients  experienced  a  treatment-related  TEAE  between  4  and  24  hours 
after infusion but no treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 5 or more patients. 
Of the ADA-positive subjects 11% (n =1) had a TR TEAE at Week 12, a timepoint when the subject had 
his/her lowest ADA titre measured. At later measurement timepoints the subject had transited to ADA-
negativity. 
4.2.4.5.  Treatment-related TEAEs – Infants 
Across studies, 74% of patients experienced a treatment-related TEAE. Those that were reported in 2 or 
more  patients  were  pyrexia  (58%);  tachycardia  (47%);  urticaria  (37%);  vomiting  (32%);  agitation, 
irritability (26%); diarrhea (21%); respiratory distress, tachypnea, pruritus (16%); lip swelling, rash, 
rash pruritic, body temperature increased, drug-specific antibody present, and pallor (11%). 
A total of 63% of patients experienced at least 1 treatment-related TEAE during or within 4 hours after 
infusion. The TEAEs so reported by 2 or more patients were pyrexia, tachycardia (47% each); urticaria 
(32%);  vomiting,  irritability  (26%  each);  agitation  (21%  each);  diarrhea,  respiratory  distress, 
tachypnea, pruritus (16% each); rash, rash pruritic, and pallor (11% each). 
Around 47% patients experienced a treatment-related TEAE between 4 and 24 hours after infusion with 
TEAEs reported by  2 or more patients being pyrexia (21%) and drug-specific antibody present (11%). 
A total of 80% of patients (n = 8) had an TR TEAE event during ADA-positivity. Those reported by 2 or 
more patients were pyrexia (70%); tachycardia (60%); urticaria, agitation (40%); diarrhea, lip swelling, 
rash, rash pruritic, tachypnea, body temperature increased, and drug specific antibody present (20% 
each). 
4.2.4.6.  Deaths –Children & Adults 
No deaths were reported in the studies that made up the Pooled SS 1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020

4.2.4.7.  Deaths – Infants 
A total of 6 patients, 4 in LAL-CL03 and 2 in LAL-CL08, died in the pooled SS 2. None of the dual WGD 
patients were part of the fatalities. All deaths were judged not or unlikely related to study IP. 
Table 55: Deaths Occurring While On Study - Pooled Safety Set 2 
4.2.4.8.  Serious TEAEs –Children & Adults 
In  the  Pooled  SS  1  23%  of  patients  experienced  a  TESAE,  but  no  single  event  affected  more  than  5 
individual patients and no patient experienced an event during an ADA-positive period. 
4.2.4.9.  Serious TEAEs – Infants 
All subjects in the Polled SS 2 expereinced at least 1 TESAE, with 74% of patients experiencing a serious 
event in the SOC infections and infestations. TESEAs reported in more than 25% of patients were pyrexia 
(47%),  gastroenteritis,  vomiting  (42%  each),  diarrhea  (37%),  tachycardia  (32%),  device-related 
infection, device-related sepsis, and URTI (26% each). 
Ten  (56%)  of  the  ADA-positive  patients  had  at  least  a  single  TESEA,  though  no  hypersensitivity  and 
anaphylactic reactions were reported. There was no difference in the proportion of patients experiencing 
TESEAs prior or post ADA-positive periods. 
4.2.4.10.  Treatment-related Serious TEAEs –Children & Adults 
A total of 3 (3%) fo the Pooled SS 1 subjects were considered to have experienced a treatment-related 
TESEA, one of which was  an anaphylactoid reaction a two different timepoints in study LAL-CL06.  All 
three  subjects  had  drug  interruptions  and  sometimes  concomitant  medication  administered,  and  all 
TESEAs resolved without sequalae. No events occurred during any ADA-positive periods for any of the 
Pooled SS 1 subjects.

EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 102/200 
 
 
  
  
 
4.2.4.11.  Treatment-related Serious TEAEs – Infants 
A total of 32% of Pooled SS 2 subjects experienced a TESAE that was judged as related to treatment by 
the investigator, and this included the three dual WGD subjects in LAL-CL08. Events reported by 2 or 
more  subjects  were  tachycardia  (26%);  pyrexia,  respiratory  distress,  urticaria  (16%);  and  vomiting 
(11%). 
Of the infants that presented with at least one period of ADA positivity during treatment (n=10), 40% 
also experienced at least 1 TESAE judges as related to treatment. Those events experienced by at least 
2 patents include tachycardia (30%) and pyrexia (20%), and 3 of the 4 patients were dual WGD subjects 
whom presented with persistent, high titres of ADA throughout their participation in the study. Only one 
subject, non-dual WGD, had a treatment interruption at a dose of 3 mg/kg for the events of tachypnea, 
tachycardia,  irritability,  and  angioedema  in  order  to  allow  for  appropriate  management  of  signs  and 
symptoms associated with the events. Upon resumption of dosing, the patient continued to receive 3 
mg/kg qw, which remained unchanged for the remainder of the study. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
The integrated analysis of all and treatment-related TEAEs and TESAEs, in both Pooled SS 1 
and 2, did not indicate any new or unknown signals in the aggregated data. 
4.2.4.12.  AESIs –Children & Adults 
Infusion associated reactions 
ARs were defined as any TEAE that occurred during or within 4 hours after EOI that were considered by 
the Investigator to be related to study drug. 
In the pooled SS 1 18% of subjects experienced at least 1 IAR, with only urticaria occurring in more 
than 5 patients total (7%). No events of IAR occurred during any periods of ADA positivity. 
Hypersensitivity and Anaphylactic Reactions 
Sixty-three  percent  of  the  Pooled  SS  1  subjects  reported  at  least  one  event,  and  4%  had  an  event 
classified as being in the SOC immune system disorders: 2 subjects with hypersensitivity and one subject 
each with anaphylactic reaction and anaphylactic shock. No events occurred during any subject’s ADA 
positive period. 
4.2.4.13.  AESIs – Infants 
Infusion associated reactions 
ARs were defined as any TEAE that occurred during or within 4 hours after EOI that were considered by 
the Investigator to be related to study drug. 
In the pooled SS 2 68% of patients had at least one IAR, with those events reported in 2 or more subjects 
being  pyrexia,  tachycardia  (47%  each);  urticaria  (37);  vomiting  (32%);  agitation,  irritability  (26% 
each); diarrhea, pruritus, respiratory distress, tachypnea (16% each) and lip swelling, rash, rash pruritic, 
and pallor (11% each). Of the infants experiencing ADA positivity, 80% also had at least one IAR during 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 103/200 
 
 
  
  
such  period  though  none  were  of  the  SOC  Immune  system  disorder  type.  Due  to  the  low  numbers 
involved it was not possible to find possible association between ADA status and IAR events. 
Hypersensitivity and Anaphylactic Reactions 
In the Pooled SS 2 subject pool 89% had at least one event. A total of 16% of subjects had an event 
classified under the SOC immune system disorders, 2 cases of hypersensitivity, one case of anaphylactic 
reaction and one case of drug hypersensitivity. About 89% of all patients with ADA positive results also 
had events during such a positive period. Hypersensitivity was reported in 20% of patients with ADA 
positivity, and anaphylactic reaction and drug hypersensitivity were each reported in 10% of patients 
with ADA positivity.  
Rapporteur’s comments 
The  integrated  AESI  analysis  generally  confirmed  the  previously  knowledge,  with  infants 
having generally more adverse events that are of the special interest type. 
4.2.4.14.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Liver function – Children & adults 
Platelet counts were reported for 96.2% of the Pooled SS 1 population at baseline for which the median 
value was 227.75 × 10^9/L. Median changes from baseline remained consistent through Month 24 and 
decreased slightly through Month 36. The median platelet count at the last assessment on study was 
226 × 10^9/L. 
The  median  leukocyte  count  at  baseline  was  6  ×  10^9/L.  Median  changes  from  baseline  remained 
consistent  (with  slight  fluctuations)  through  Month  36.  The  median  leukocyte  count  at  the  last 
assessment on study was 5.66 × 10^9/L.  
There were no clinically meaningful changes observed in platelet and leukocyte counts over time.  
Liver function – Infants 
Platelet counts were reported for 16/19 (84.2%) infants at baseline for which the median was 159.5 × 
10^9/L.  Median  values  markedly  increased  at  Week  2  and  at  Week  48  where  it  was  309  ×  10^9/L. 
Following  this  timepoint, median  changes  from  baseline  remained  consistent (with  small  fluctuations) 
through Week 144. The median platelet count at the last assessment on study was 310.5 × 10^9/L.

Week 144, but values generally increased over time. The median leukocyte count at the last assessment 
on study was 8.25 × 10^9/L. 
The  observed  changes  in  platelet  and  leukocyte  counts  were  consistent  with  an  improvement  in  the 
underlying disease of LAL-D in infants.

The observed changes in GGT were consistent with an improvement in the underlying disease of LAL-D 
in  children  and  adults.  There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  observed  in  serum  albumin  and 
bilirubin over time.  
Activated partial thromboplastin time was reported for 91.5% of children and adults at baseline for which 
the median time was 30.6 sec. Median changes from baseline remained consistent through Month 36. 
The median aPTT time for the last assessment on study was 30 sec. 
The INR was reported for 96.2% of children and adults at baseline for which the median ratio was 1.1.

assessment on study was 1.06. 
Prothrombin time was reported for 78.3% of children and adults at baseline for which the time was 12.7 
sec.  Median  changes  from  baseline  remained  consistent  through  Month  30  (after  this  time  data  were 
only available for 1 or 2 patients. The median prothrombin time for the last assessment on study was 
12.255 sec. 
For children and adults, the coagulation parameters (PT, INR, and aPTT) for the last assessment on study 
were similar to that of the values reported at Baseline. 
Liver injury – Infants 
Alanine aminotransferase results were reported for 94.7% of infants at baseline for which the median 
value was 62.5 U/L. Median changes from baseline fluctuated but generally decreased through Week 48 
and further, generally decreased through Week 144. The median ALT value for the last assessment on 
study was 38 U/L.

value  was  101  U/L.  Median  changes  from  baseline  markedly  decreased  at  Week  2  and  continued  to 
fluctuate,  yet  generally  decreased  through  Week  48.  Following  this  timepoint,  median  changes  from 
baseline slightly fluctuated through Week 144. The median AST value for the last assessment on study 
was 53 U/L.  
The observed changes in serum transaminases were consistent with an improvement in the underlying 
disease of LAL-D in infants.  
Assessment report

Gamma glutamyl transferase results were reported for 89.5% of infants at baseline for which the median 
value was 95 U/L. Median changes from baseline markedly increased at Week 2. Following this timepoint, 
median  changes  from  baseline  fluctuated,  yet  generally  decreased  though  Week  48.  After  this  time, 
median changes from baseline gradually decreased through Week 144. The median GGT value for the 
last assessment on study was 22 U/L.  
Serum albumin results were reported for 94.7% of infants at baseline for which the median value was 
23.5 g/L. Median changes from baseline fluctuated, yet generally increased through Week 48. Thereafter 
median  changes  were  maintained  through  Week  144.  The  median  serum  albumin  value  for  the  last 
assessment on study was 33.3 g/L.  
Serum bilirubin results were reported for 89.5% of infants at baseline for which the median value was 
12  μmol/L.  Median  changes  from  baseline  fluctuated,  yet  generally  decreased  through  Week  48. 
Following this timepoint, there were incremental increases through Week 144 (although values did not 
reach  the  levels  reported  at  Baseline;  3  μmol/L).  The  median  serum  bilirubin  value  for  the  last 
assessment on study was 5.13 μmol/L.  
The  observed  changes  in  the  discussed  parameters  were  consistent  with  an  improvement  in  the 
underlying disease of LAL-D in infants.  
Activated partial thromboplastin time was reported for 78.9% of infants at baseline for which the median 
time was 28 sec. Median changes from baseline fluctuated slightly through Week 120. The median aPTT 
time for the last assessment on study was 28.1 sec. 
The  INR  was  reported  for  8  of  the  19  infants  at  baseline  for  which  the  median  ratio  was  1.1.  No 
conclusions  can  be  made  due  to  limited  number  of  patients  with  available  data  at  the  postbaseline 
timepoints.  
Prothrombin time was reported for 78.9% of infants at baseline for which the median (min, max) time 
was 12.1 sec. Median changes from baseline were consistent through Week 120. No data were available 
for the Week 144 timepoint. The median prothrombin time for the last assessment on study was 14.2 
sec. 
For  infants,  the  coagulation  parameters  (PT,  INR,  and  aPTT)  for  the  last  assessment  on  study  were 
similar to that of the values reported at Baseline. 
Acute Phase Reaction – Children & adults 
Serum ferritin results were reported for 99% of children and adults at baseline for which the median 
value was 44.70 μg/L. Median changes from baseline fluctuated, but generally decreased through Week 
48. The median serum ferritin value for the last assessment on study was 40.7 μg/L.  
For children and adults, no clinically meaningful changes were observed in serum ferritin values over 
time.  
Acute Phase Reaction – Infants 
Serum ferritin results were reported for 47.4% of infants at baseline for which the median was 586.3 
μg/L.  Median  values  markedly  decreased  at  the  first  postbaseline  timepoint  (Week  2)  and  further 
decreased to 
57.7 μg/L  by Week 48. Following this timepoint, median changes from baseline fluctuated but generally 
decreased until Week 144 when the median serum ferritin value was 43 μg/L. The median serum ferritin 
value for the last assessment on study was 83.85 μg/L. 
Assessment report

The observed changes in serum ferritin were consistent with an improvement in the underlying disease 
of LAL-D in infants.  
Rapporteur’s comments 
Overall  no  specific  new  issues  regarding  clinical  laboratory  events  could  be  seen  in  the 
integrated data analysis. 
4.2.4.15.  Immunogenicity 
ADA positivity – Children & Adults 
In  the  Pooled  SS  1  patient  group  98%  of  subjects  had  baseline  ADA  testing  done,  and  8%  became 
positive  during  the  respective  studies  with  a  median  duration  until  first  titre  peak  (median  37)  of  57 
days. Of the latter 9% of patients 3 were heterozygous for the common mutation, 1 was homozygous 
for the common mutation, and 4 were documented with “other” mutations. 
Generally  ADA  positivity  was  transient  in  the  Pooled  SS  1  group  and  overall  low  titres  of  ADAs  were 
reported.  Two  of  the  9  ADA+  patients  went  on  to  develop  Nabs  that  had  an  impact  on  efficacy,  but 
neither was forced to discontinue due to this evolution. 
ADA positivity – Infants 
In the Pooled SS 2 group, 68% of subjects had baseline ADA testing results, and 10 (>50%) patients 
became ADA positive during the respective studies with a median duration until first positivity of 57 days 
and until median peak titre (median 3839) of 792 days. Of these 10 patients, 1 was heterozygous for 
the common mutation and 6 were documented with “other” mutations. 
Persistence of ADA positivity was observed for all 10 patients. Further, 9 patients were positive for NAbs 
that inhibited LAL activity and/or cellular uptake. Nonetheless, the development of ADAs and/or NAbs 
was  not  correlated  with  either  an  increased  incidence  of  TEAEs  or  suboptimal  clinical  response, 
respectively. For the overall population, IARs were  reported for patients with both ADA positivity and 
ADA negativity and were similar in type and severity.  
Three LAL-CL08 patients whom reported with the high titers of ADAs and NAbs were discovered to have 
a  homozygous  deletion  affecting  both  alleles  of  genes  LIPA  and  the  neighboring  Cholesterol,  25-
Hydroxylase gene, and these 3 patients required more medical attention, including infusions of higher 
dosage regimens of sebelipase alfa. Two of the 3 patients received immunomodulatory therapy, 1 patient 
later underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT), and 1 patient received a HSCT. Both latter patients 
required a lower dosage regimen of sebelipase alfa once dosing was resume and their ADA titers and 
NAbs decreased thereafter.  
The third patient is currently receiving sebelipase alfa 5 mg/kg qw and continues to have high titers of 
ADAs. This patient exhibits progressive liver fibrosis (Ishak fibrosis score = 3) but has improved clinically 
with  bortezomib  treatment  and  is  scheduled  for  an  eventual  BMT  or  HSCT.  The  patient’s  laboratory 
workup  indicated  very  high  levels  of  anti-drug  Immunoglobulin  G,  which  significantly  inhibit  cellular 
uptake of LAL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 107/200 
 
 
  
  
 
Mean time to the first ADA positive result was shorter for the patients with dual WGD than in patients 
without dual WGD, median peak titre was considerably higher (260,476 versus 578) and time to peak 
was shorter 728 days versus 927 days. 
While patients with dual WGD had the highest levels of ADAs and NAbs, this is most likely related to the 
lack  of  enzyme  and  immune  intolerance.  The  role  that  the  additional  deletion  of  the  Cholesterol,  25-
Hydroxylase gene plays is unknown. For the 2 patients with dual WGD who underwent successful BMT 
and HSCT, the presence of enzyme resulted in a decrease in ADAs and NAbs which in turn lowered the 
need for higher doses of sebelipase alfa.  
A review of data for these patients with high titer ADAs did not show a clear relationship between ADA 
titer and the risk of IARs and more likely represented the underlying disease. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
The  aggregated  observations  confirm  earlier  findings,  with  infants  having  a  proportionally 
higher ADA development. 
Development  of  anti-sebelipase  antibodies  is  associated  with  a  reasonable  chance  to  also 
develop Nabs, as was known before, but generally the Nab-positive status was not associated 
with complete response failure or increased safety issues, neither in children/adults nor in 
infants. 
One  new  observation  made  in  LAL-CL08  regarded  three  infant  patients  whom  developed  a 
strong  immunogenic  response  and  required  extensive  and  persistent  dose  escalation  to 
maintain effectiveness. These three patients turned out to have a dual WGD phenotype, and 
this led to the opening of a new safety signal in the latest PSUR (DLP 28 Aug 2019). 
4.2.4.16.  Vital Signs 
Vital signs – Children & Adults 
Any vital sign TEAEs that were reported, the majority of which were drops in blood pressure, in Pooled 
SS 1 were generally mild and unrelated to treatement. Due to the small number of patients experiencing 
changes in vital signs no conclusions could be made thereupon. 
Vital signs – Infants 
Across clinical studies conducted in infants, over 50% of patients had an increase or decrease in blood 
pressure and around 47% had transient increases in heart rate while on study. The abnormalities in vital 
sign results that were reported as TEAEs in infants were mainly characterized as mild and not related to 
sebelipase alfa. Due to the small number of patients experiencing changes in vital signs no conclusions 
could be made thereupon.

4.2.4.17.  Subanalyses 
Subanalyses– Children & Adults 
Overall no significant differences of interest in either age or gender stratified analyses could be discerned. 
Likewise, no meaningful differences in safety could be discerned along a LLM usage stratification axis.  
Subanalyses – Infants 
No subanalyses based on age was undertaken, and gender did not seem to induce any difference in the 
safety outcomes of treatment. Likewise, no meaningful differences in safety could be discerned along a 
LLM usage stratification axis.  
4.2.4.18.  Incidence Summary 
ADR  tables  were  generated  for  both  Pooled  SS  1  and  2  sets  using  standard  methodologies,  with  the 
following caveats: 
Three ADR terms represent a grouping of multiple Preferred Terms:  
• 
• 
• 
The incidence of ADRs of “infusion site reaction” was calculated based on the following group of 
Preferred  Terms:  infusion  site  extravasation,  infusion  site  pain,  infusion  site  reaction,  and 
infusion site urticaria.  
The incidence of ADRs of “hypersensitivity” was calculated based on the number of patients with 
Preferred  Term(s)  that  met  the  SMQ  for  hypersensitivity  (narrow),  see  Table  38.  Of  the  281 
Preferred Terms in this SMQ, the Preferred Terms included in ADRs of hypersensitivity reported 
for patients in the sebelipase alfa clinical program are presented by pooled safety set in Table 1. 
Similarly, t 
The incidence of ADRs of “anaphylactic reaction” was calculated based on the number of patients 
with Preferred Term(s) that met the SMQ for anaphylactic reaction (broad and narrow), see Table 
38. Of the 92 Preferred Terms in this SMQ, the Preferred Terms included in ADRs of anaphylactic 
reaction  reported  for  patients  in  the  sebelipase  alfa  clinical  program  are  presented  by  pooled 
safety set in Table 1.  
The  incidence  of  ADRs  of  hypersensitivity  and  anaphylactic  reaction  encompass  all  cases 
identified by the respective SMQs, regardless of causality or seriousness. 
For Pooled Safety Set 1, events that had an onset during treatment with placebo in the Double-blind 
Period of  Study  LAL-CL02,  including those that  continued  after  the transition  to  open-label treatment 
with sebelipase alfa, were not included in the calculation of the incidence of ADRs.  
Rapporteur’s comments 
Given that the ADR tables should only include AEs that are clearly related to the treatment 
this is acceptable.

Rapporteur’s comments 
The  proposed  ADR  tables  are  incomplete.  And  and  all  adverse  event  that  has  at  least  a 
suspicion of causal origin should be included by preferred term. Based on the sources quoted, 
namely  ISS  Tables  14.3.1.23.1.1.1  and  14.3.1.23.2.1.2,  not  all  treatment-related  preferred 
term event shave been quoted in the new ADR tables.

4.3.  Discussion 
4.3.1.  Integrated Efficacy Discussion 
In  this  grouped  variation  the  MAH  provided  both  the  final  study  results  of  the  expanded  access 
programme EA01 that ran in the US and which allowed patients that weren’t eligible for trial participation 
to be treated until commercial product would become available. Additionally, this variation also provided 
an integrated analysis of the efficacy and safety results of all post-approval studies that were set up and 
have now finished. Each of these studies was assessed separately prior, but the current exercise does 
provide a cross-study analysis of outcomes, with all benefits and drawbacks that this entails. 
For what concerns the expanded access study, efficacy follow-up was not an objective in this programme, 
but nonetheless certain safety parameters that were gathered also allow a certain measure of clinical 
benefit follow-up. 
In  the  6  patients,  5  children  and  1  adult,  that  participated  in  this  programme  there  was  a  clear 
improvement in parameters such as liver function and dyslipidaemia, the latter which occurred without 
any concomitant LLMs, alongside improvements in serum transaminases. Five out of six patients had a 
baseline palpable liver which became smaller over the course of treatment. 
Thus in general the improvements in clinical status of these subjects generally mirrors the effects seen 
during the clinical development programme as well as in the post-approval study settings. 
The Integrated analysis of post-approval studies aggregated the results of six studies:  LAL-CL01, CL04, 
CL02, CL06, CL03 and CL08. The latter two studies, CL03 and CL08, were studies in infant subjects with 
rapid  onset  LA-D,  whereas  the  other  studies  were  done  in  a  mixed  children,  adolescents  and  adults 
setting for CL02 and CL06 and a strictly adult setting for CL01 and CL04. 
For the integrated analysis the aggregation of data was done in two large pools, based on the fact that 
the disease severity and lethality is different in infants; Pooled FAS 1 which contained all children and 
adults that participated the trails and Pooled FAS 2 which included all infant subjects. 
Given the fact that the integrated analysis is a cross-study heterogenic data aggregation it should come 
as no surpise that for different efficacy endpoints different degrees of data paucity may exist, as well as 
a difference in dosing regimens, but overall the majority of endpoints were sufficiently congruent as to 
allow meaningful analysis. 
Another issue to take into account specifically for Pooled FAS 2 is the fact that even in this aggregated 
form only very few subjects were included (n = 19), which immediately makes it exceedingly difficult to 
consider the clinical significance of or draw any firm conclusions from any new findings that would emerge 
from this integrated analysis. 
Overall the efficacy results in both Pooled FAS groups are congruent with the observations made in both 
the  clinical development  leading  up  to  market  authorization,  as  well  as  the observations  made  in  the 
individual studies that lake up the aggregated data body for this analysis. No new worrying signs of lack 
of efficacy or inadequacy of dosing were discovered, though the Applicant set forth three new points to 
consider: 
- 
It is suggested based on the fact that a sizable exposure of 3 mg/kg qow was observed to be 
used in the aggregated data of children and adults  that had a less-than-optimal response on 
the standard dose, and that this did not result in any new safety issues, to allow the option of 
said dose in the SmPC approved posology in case warranted by clinical response. Generally this 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 113/200 
 
 
  
  
suggestion  is  supported  based  on  the  data  as  seen  in  the  integrated  analysis  and  the  clinical 
reality which some of these patients find themselves in. 
- 
Likewise,  according  to  the  Applicant  there  was  a  sizeable  use  of  the  5  mg/kg  qw  dose  in  the 
infant population, for much the same reasons as above. Thus the applicant proposes to also alter 
the max dose escalation in the SmPC approved posology accordingly. However, in contrast to 
the previous point there are a few issues to consider here. First is the fact that the aggregated 
data only cover a total of 19 patients (13 of which made it to their respective studies’ end) and 
of those only 7 were administered a doses of 5 mg/kg qw or higher. Moreover, of these 7 patients 
3 were the dual WGD patients whose situation is slightly outside the norm, thus leaving only 4 
‘non-exceptional’ patients with high dose use. This is considered far too few to normally allow a 
substantive alteration to the posology as proposed. However, one should also take into account 
the  clinical  reality  of  early-onset  LAL-D  which  is  characterised  by  a  rapid  onset  and  higher 
severity  of  pathophysiologic  processes  and  characteristics,  as  well  as  a  markedly  higher 
mortality. Thus based on the observations made, the fact that no major safety issues were noted 
related by the higher dosing (with the caveat that the actual number of patients is exceedingly 
low) and the clinical reality of early-onset LAL-D the proposed change to the approved posology 
could be accepted if the MAH also provides a guidance in the SmPC that clearly outlines when 
and  how  dose-escalation  and  –de-escalation  should  be  undertaken  and  in  addition  provide 
information  on  how  to  proceed  if  even  the  highest  allowed  dose  does  not  alleviate  disease 
burden. 
- 
Three  infant  subjects  in  study  LAL-CL08  showed  continuous  high  ADA  titres  with  efficacy-
impacting  NAb  development  with  required  high  dosing  treatment  for  limited  effect,  with  one 
patient even escalating to 7.5 mg/kg qw. Eventually the patients’ situation could be alleviated 
using  BMT  and  HSCT.  Genetic  analysis  showed  that  these  three  patients  had  a  dual  WGD  (a 
homozygous deletion affecting both alleles of the genes LIPA and Cholesterol 25-Hydroxylase). 
In  the  process  of  study  LAL-CL08  assessment  the  MAH  was  asked  to  potentially  provide  a 
retrospective  integrated  analysis  of  immunology  with  specific  focus  on  the  disease-underlying 
genetic  mutations,  but  unfortunately  most  trails  did  not  collect  genetic  data thus  making  this 
type of exercise impossible. Dual WGD and associated risks have however been flagged as a new 
safety signal in the updated RMP following the last renewal procedure for Kanuma®. 
4.3.2.  Integrated Safety Discussion 
In  the  results  of  the  US  expanded  access  Programme  LAL-AE01  no  deaths  or  serious  adverse  events 
were noted, nor were there any discontinuations. Of the 6 patients 5 had post-baseline immunogenicity 
data  available  and  none  showed  ADA  development,  and  in  general  no  worrisome  or  untoward  safety 
issues were noted in these patients. 
The  integrated  analysis  of  the  6  PA  studies  was  done  on  the  so-called  Pooled  SS  1  and  2  groups, 
aggregating data from respectively children/adults and infants, which for all intents and purposes were 
functionally identical to the Pooled FAS 1 & 2 groups used for the efficacy assessment and which carries 
the same limitations in regards to potential data heterogeneity and paucity. 
Overall  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  findings  of  this  integrated  analysis  did  not  find  any  new  or 
untoward safety parameters and outcomes were congruent with findings during the clinical development 
for MA and the individual PA studies. 
No impact of dose escalation on the safety profile was apparent either, though caution should be taken 
given that, especially in infants, the data was very limited given the lower numbers of subjects on higher 
dose treatments. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 114/200 
 
 
  
  
One important combined efficacy-safety finding, as already discussed in the previous section, was the 
clue that dual whole genome deletion in the form of a homozygous deletion affecting both alleles of the 
genes LIPA and Cholesterol 25-Hydroxylase may impact the underlying disease in in such a way that 
patients are at elevated risk of having efficacy-impacting immunogenic responses to treatment. Based 
on this data a new safety signal has been incorporated in the RMP. 
After further clarification on the method of ADR inclusion eligibility and a restructuring of the ADR table, 
said table is now considered acceptable. 
4.3.3.  Conclusions 
Overall, the integrated analysis as provided here, in combination with the final results of the LAL-EA01 
expanded access programme, confirm the clinical safety and efficacy of sebelipase alfa as determined in 
the clinical development program for MA as well as the individual post-authorisation studies that make 
up the aggregated data body of this analysis. 
Based on the results  the MAH proposed to update the approved posology to allow escalation of dosing 
in children and adults up to 3 mg/kg qow and in infants up to 5 mg/kg qw in function of clinical response. 
Sufficient data is available to agree with the change of adult and children’s posology, but the change in 
infant  posology  cannot  be  accepted  based  solely  on  the  very  limited  clinical  data  available.  However, 
based on the clinical knowledge on the graveness of infant LAL-D the proposed dose escalation could be 
acceptable if the MAH also provides a cleat guidance on how and when to escalate and de-escalate doses 
in infants, as well as providing guidance on what should be done if a patient’s situation can still not be 
controlled even at the new upper treatment limit. 
As  already  discussed  during  the  evaluation  of  the  LAL-CL08  individual  study  results  and  during  the 
renewal  procedure  for  Kanuma®,  three  infant  patients  identified  whom  suffered  efficacy-impacting 
immunogenic responses and for whom the disease was difficult to control even at sebelipase doses of 5 
mg/kg  qw  and  higher.  Genetic  typing  of  these  three  subjects  revealed  that  they  had  a  homozygous 
deletion  affecting  both  alleles  of  the  genes  LIPA  and  Cholesterol  25-Hydroxylase,  which  may  have 
contributed to a more severe disease characteristic. Based on these findings a new safety signal was put 
into the update RMP following the latest renewal procedure. 
Finally, as a result of this procedure the MAH wishes to delete one of the PAMs in the Annex II to the 
SmpC: 
Study LAL-CL08: an open-label, Phase 2 study in infants with rapidly progressive LAL Deficiency to 
explore long-term safety and efficacy data. The efficacy objectives are assessment of hepatic function 
overtime  up  to  3  years  and  survival  at  12  months.  The  safety  objectives  should  focus  on 
hypersensitivity reactions, particularly anti-drug antibodies development impacting response to drug. 
Based on the fact that the final LAL-CL08 report has been submitted and providedand the fact that all 
questions raised thereupon have been adequately addressed by the MAH,the deletion of this Annex II 
PAM can be accepted.

8.  Request for supplementary information 
8.1.  Major objections 
Clinical aspects 
1.  It is observed that at least 287 samples from 4 clinical studies (studies LAL-CL02, LAL-CL03, LAL-
CL06 and LAL-CL08) were impacted by data integrity issues, i.e. 19% of the total number of samples 
for these 4 studies (287/1510) or 14% out of all PK samples collected in the six clinical studies with 
PK  sampling  (287/2122).  The  sponsor  proposes  to  report  these  results  as  ‘non  reportable’.  The 
disqualification of this substantial number of results raises concerns about the validity of the entire 
set  of  PK  data  reported  and  may  warrant  an  inspection.  The  MAH  is  required  to  justify  that  the 
conclusions drawn on the pharmacokinetics of sebelipase can be considered reliable. 
2.  The population pharmacokinetic analyses has been conducted to support the proposed posology and 
pharmacokinetic characteristics of sebelipase alpha in sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC. There are, 
however, issues with the current population pharmacokinetic analyses. 
Therefore,  
a. The applicant is requested to confirm the proposed posology and pharmacokinetic statements of 
the SmPC. The applicant is asked to perform additional simulations using an updated final PK model 
to identify alternative dosing weight ranges leading to comparable exposure as observed in adults. 
Further, exposure comparison between paediatrics and adults should also be conducted in different 
age ranges of paediatrics to evaluate the current posology, 
b. The assessment of bodyweight effect on clearance and volume of distribution with an estimated 
exponent is not supported in view of the limited data in the lower age subgroup; data from only 9 
patients  of  <  4  years  old  were  available.  Bodyweight  should  be  implemented  in  the  model  using 
allometric  scaling  with  fixed  exponents  of  0.75  and  1  for  all  CL  and  V  parameters,  respectively. 
Additional  effect  of  age/maturation  should  be  tested  on  this  model,  including  body  weight.  It  is 
noticed  that  the  current  methodology  of  allometric  scaling  with  estimated  model  parameters  is 
incorrect. All clearance and volume of distribution parameters need to be scaled if allometric scaling 
is  applied  (irrespective  of  estimated  or  fixed  allometric  scaling  exponents),  which  is  most  likely 
resulting  in  the  high  RSE  observed  for  Vp  and  the  high  amount  of  unexplained  between-subject 
variability in the model. As a result, the influence of body weight and age cannot be assessed.

3.  Concerning  the  immunogenicity  assays,  the  Applicant  is  requested  to  determine  the  cut-points  of 
the target populations using the pre-treatment samples from the completed studies LAL-CL02, LAL-
CL03, LAL-CL04, LAL-CL06 and LAL-CL08 to confirm the assay cut points determined with samples 
from healthy drug-naïve subjects. A statistical comparison is expected. 
4.  Concerning  immunogenicity,  the  MAH  has  investigated  the  impact  of  ADA  on  exposure  using  a 
covariate  analysis  methodology  on  the  final  Pop-PK  model.  But  the  total  number  of  patients  with 
samples with measurable concentrations of sebelipase alfa and an ADA status used in this analysis 
is limited in comparison to the totality of data provided (3 ADA+ on 19 ADA+ in total; 72 ADA- on 
106 ADA- in total). The effect of NAb was not formally tested in the population PK model due to the 
low number of samples with both a measurable concentration and a positive NAb (ie, a total of 1 
positive NAb in 1 patient). Thus no conclusion can be currently drawn due to the limited information 
available. The SmPC should be updated in that sense, unless otherwise justified. 
POPPK modelling 
5.  The final POPPK model was conducted on 714 samples on 880 considered PK samples. The reasons 
for  not  including  116  reportable  samples  in  the  POPPK  analysis  were:  pre-  or  post-dose  blank,  a 
measurable concentration before the first dose, TAD>10 and not BLQ, missing sampling time and 
amount of previous dose imputed. The MAH is requested to clarify why a total of 1122 study samples 
with  reportable  results  (as  calculated  based  on  Table  5  Module  2.7.1  and  excluding  the  samples 
excluded from LAL-CL01 due to data integrity issues and from study LAL-CL08 due to errors in dosing 
records)  has  not  been  considered  for  inclusion  in  the  POPPK  analysis.  In  addition,  the  exclusion 
criteria ‘TAD>10’ should be clarified. 
6.  In view of the identified issues with data integrity and related data exclusion, the applicant is asked 
to provide  the distribution of the data used for POPPK modelling by age group and to discuss whether 
there  were  enough  data  in  the  different  age  subgroups  (2-4,  4-6,  6-12,  and  12-18  y.o)  to  allow 
adequate PK characterization in the different age groups. 
7.  Nonlinear  clearance  should  also  be  tested  in  the  POPPK  model  using  individual  predicted 
concentrations as exposure marker. 
8.  It is noted that Vp parameters was poorly estimated using the updated POPPK model with RSE of 
66%, this should be discuss in particular in light of data exclusion. 
9.  Model misspecifications are observed on the IPRED vs OBS and the pcVPC  graphic: this should be 
further discussed. Moreover, model fitting performances (GOF nad pcVPC) should also be provided 
by age subgroups. 
10. For adequate graphical evaluation, some missing plots should be provided. NPDEs distribution should 
also be provided as well as NPDE vs PRED and vs time plots. In addition, the applicant could present 
ETA plots versus bodyweight and age for: 
- model without bodyweight or age as covariates, 
 - model with bodyweight as covariate,  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 124/200 
 
 
  
  
- model with age as covariate.  
PK/PD modelling 
11. The choice of the 2 PD markers for the modelling exercise need to be better substantiated, as well 
as acceptance criteria and target levels to be reached for the selected dosing regimens. 
12. The exclusion of placebo arm data from the PK/PD analysis is not acceptable given that these data 
could be informative for adequate description of the time course of the 2 biomarkers. The MAH is 
asked to address this issue. 
13. The  selection  of  the  structural  model  in  particular  absence  of  testing  alternative  structural  model 
with drug clearance from the central compartment and outside the effect compartment need to be 
justified for both ALT and LDL-cholesterol. 
14. Key  parameters  (e.g.  IC50  and    EC50)  were  fixed  without  justifications  of  the  source  and  the 
plausibility of the values used. 
15. Pc VPC should be provided. 
16. Model fitting performances (GOF nad pcVPC) should also be provided by age subgroups. 
17. NPDEs distribution should also be provided as well as NPDE vs PRED and vs time plots. 
Clinical Efficacy 
18. The Applicant’s proposed increase of the maximum dosage in infants to 5mg/kg qw does not have 
sufficient data to unequivocally support this change. However, given the clinical knowledge on the 
aggressiveness of early-onset LAL-D and the overall trend that seems to emerge from the limited 
data that there are indeed patients that benefit from higher doses, a higher maximal dose in case of 
insufficient  response  could  be  accepted  if  the  MAH  provides  a  guidance  in  the  SmPC  on  how  and 
when  to  escalate  or  de-escalate  the  dose,  and  what  to  do  in  case  an  infant’s  situation  does  not 
become  controlled  even  at  the  higher  maximal  dose.  Details  on  the  format  and  content  of  this 
guidance is left to the MAH to devise and propose. 
SmPC 
19.  The Applicant should update the ADR tables in section 4.8 of the SmPC as to provide frequency 
information for each preferred term instead of for the MeDRa SOC as a whole. Additionally, all 
causally related or reasonably considered as potentially causally related events should be listed by 
preferred term. 
20.  Regarding the modifications in the section 5.2, some updates are already proposed :  
a. 
It should be clarified in the title of the table 5 that the parameters were simulated after 
multiple dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 125/200 
 
 
  
  
b.  The table 5 is not in line with the table 8 of the PK/PD simulation report. As an example, 
the total number N for overall subjects is discrepant (N=72 vs N=4). 
c.  The conclusions on the linearity of sebelipase alpha PK and accumulation over time are 
drawn based on the non-compartmental analysis in study LAL-CL04 and in study LAL-
CL04 and LAL-CL06, respectively. But the number of patients in each category of age 
was  limited  and  should  be  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  In  addition,  the  lack  of  sign  of 
accumulation for the 3 mg/kg qow dosing is not reported in the SmPC. Instead, lack of 
accumulation at 3 mg/kg once weekly is mentioned. It should be clarified if the source 
of this information is the study LAL-CL01 while all the PK samples from this study were 
disqualified. The SmPC should be updated accordingly. 
21.  The MAH should consider providing revised Product Information based on all the comments included 
in attachment to this Request for Supplementary Information. 
RMP aspects 
22. The elements for a public summary of the RMP should be slightly revised to include an 
explanation to the term “patients with dual WGD”, e.g. “patients who lack the enzyme 
completely”. 
9.  Assessment of the responses to the request for 
supplementary information 
9.1.  Major objections 
Clinical aspects 
Question 1 
It is observed that at least 287 samples from 4 clinical studies (studies LAL-CL02, LAL-CL03, LAL-CL06 
and LAL-CL08) were impacted by data integrity issues, i.e. 19% of the total number of samples for these 
4 studies (287/1510) or 14% out of all PK samples collected in the six clinical studies with PK sampling 
(287/2122). The sponsor proposes to report these results as ‘non reportable’. The disqualification of this 
substantial number of results raises concerns about the validity of the entire set of PK data reported and 
may  warrant  an  inspection.  The  MAH  is  required  to  justify  that  the  conclusions  drawn  on  the 
pharmacokinetics of sebelipase can be considered reliable. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Alexion is committed to assuring the quality and integrity of our study data, and for that reason we have 
disqualified data that did not meet applicable standards. An investigation was conducted, and actions 
were  taken  to  ensure  the  accuracy  and  reliability  of  the  results  we  have  reported  and  ability  to 
reconstruct the studies. A summary of those events, decisions and justification for the validity of the 
reported data is discussed herein. 
Assessment report

In 2013, the CRO was contracted to validate an “Enzymatic Method to Determine the Activity of SBC-
102 in Human Serum” (ELISA-0558-007) and perform sample analysis for the Studies LAL-CL01, LAL-
CL02, LAL-CL03, LAL-CL04, LAL-CL06, and LAL-CL08. In early 2017, Alexion was notified by CRO that a 
Health  Authority  had  performed  a  directed  inspection  of  the  in  December  2016  that  did  not  involve 
Alexion  studies,  but  did  result  in  the  issuance  of  observations  related  to  data  integrity.  It  was  also 
communicated that similar issues impacted some of the Alexion study data. Alexion immediately initiated 
an  investigation  into  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  issues,  resulting  in  both  corrective  and  preventive 
actions as well as the disqualification of impacted study data. 
Summary of investigation 
Investigation and review of audit trails found that in the course of analyzing PK samples, single analytical 
plates had been read multiple times. In some instances, plates were read up to 5 times. When a re-read 
of  a  plate  occurred,  the  original  data  were  overwritten  and  only  data  from  the  final  plate  read  were 
captured and subsequently reported. This activity was not documented anywhere in the associated study 
data.  Original  and  intermediate  plate  reads  were  not  captured  by  backup  systems  connected  to  the 
instrument; however, the audit trails for Softmax Pro did record the activity. This overwriting of original 
data was limited to a single analyst working on Alexion studies. 
Investigation highlights: 
• Alexion bioanalytical scientists and quality group personnel performed an onsite data review and onsite 
audit, respectively. 
• Policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs) associated with data integrity were reviewed. 
• Electronic system configuration, access, and permissions were assessed. 
• All audit trails for Alexion studies were 100% reviewed (including supporting validations) identifying 
all impacted analytical runs. 
• Analytical run performance and acceptance were reviewed. 
• Study incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) data were reviewed and specifically ISR data where at least 1 
value was from a run associated with data overwriting. 
Root cause assessment: 
• System access rights allowed replacement and overwriting of data for analysts who were also method 
developers. 
• A single analyst failed to follow policies and SOPs designed to address data integrity. 
• Review of data by supervising staff, Quality Control and Quality Assurance did not consistently involve 
review of system audit trails. 
Highlights of actions: 
• All data from runs involving overwriting of original results were disqualified. 
• Any samples within established stability were reanalyzed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 127/200 
 
 
  
  
• The analyst responsible for the overwriting practice was removed from global system access. 
• The ability to overwrite/delete data in SoftMax Pro was removed from all users (except administrators). 
• SoftMax Pro SOP’s were updated. 
• Increased review of user access to regulated systems was implemented. 
• Data integrity training was conducted for staff. 
• Specific requirements for review of system audit trails as part of any QA review was put in place. 
Conclusion of the investigation: 
All samples impacted by these events were identified and reanalyzed when possible or the data were 
disqualified. Without the disqualified results, the rest of the reported results (86% of total number of 
samples) met the criteria recommended by EMA (2/3 [66.67%] of samples are within 30% Diff) in the 
incurred sample reanalysis (ISR), thus demonstrating the reproducibility of the data. Therefore, from 
our investigation, the actions taken by both CRO and Alexion, and the performance of method, we have 
concluded that the reported Kanuma PK data are free of data integrity issues and reliable for use. 
The  actions that  lead to the  subsequent  data disqualification  in this  program were  limited  to  a  single 
analyst who is no longer employed by the CRO. The laboratory has taken appropriate steps to prevent 
these actions from reoccurring in the future through procedural and technical controls. 
Assessment of data reliability 
Despite  exclusion  of  these  data,  the  final  Pop-PK  model  incorporated  25%  more  PK  data  than  in  the 
original  regulatory  application  model,  ie,  the  final  Pop-PK  modeling  was  conducted  on  714  samples 
compared with 570 samples in the original Marketing Authorization application (Original Sebelipase Alfa 
Pop-PK Report Section 8.2.1). 
For  the  PK/PD  modeling,  exploratory  graphical  analysis  and  a  model-based  sensitivity  analysis 
(Sebelipase Alfa PK/PD Report Appendix 4) suggested that the PD data from Studies LAL-CL04 and LAL-
CL06 were uninformative to improve the PK/PD model. Therefore, the Pop-PK analysis was conducted 
on the reportable data from Studies LAL-CL02, LAL-CL03, LAL-CL04, and LAL-CL06 only, and the PK/PD 
modeling was conducted on the reportable data from Studies LAL-CL02 and LAL-CL03 only. 
The analytical methods used to generate the reported PK dataset are fully validated. The ISR analysis, 
a mandated measure of a bioanalytical methods accuracy and reliability in the table below, meet the 
acceptance  criteria  as  recommended  by  EMA  (2/3  [66.67%]  of  the  samples  are  within  30%), 
demonstrating the reliability of the reported bioanalytical results. 
Table 59 – Summary of ISR across Kanuma studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 128/200 
 
 
  
  
 
As such, Alexion has confidence in the data that were included in the PAM PK analyses, and that these 
data are sufficiently reliable to support the conclusions drawn on the PK of sebelipase alfa. The results 
from the final PK/PD model, which includes 25% more PK data than in the original MAA confirms the 
initial conclusions drawn on the PK of sebelipase alfa. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
In answer to the major objection raised at the first round of assessment of this variation questioning the 
validity of the PK data, the MAH has described the corrective and preventive action plan taken to address 
the data integrity issues detected as part of a Health Authority inspection carried out in 2016. In general, 
this is deemed acceptable in terms of GCP and are expected to prevent a similar problem in the future :  
o  An investigation was conducted, and actions were taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of 
the reported results and ability to reconstruct the studies. The ability to overwrite/delete data in 
SoftMax Pro was removed from all users (except administrators). This is considered as a crucial 
correction  in  their  systems  and  quality  control  management  to  prevent  similar  data  issues  for 
future analysis.  
o  The laboratory has taken appropriate steps to prevent these actions from reoccurring in the future 
through procedural and technical controls. 
o  All  audit  trails  for  Alexion  studies  were  100%  reviewed  (including  supporting  validations) 
identifying all impacted analytical runs. 
o  All samples impacted by these events were identified and reanalyzed when possible or the data 
were  disqualified.  Based  on  the  information  provided  in  the  original  dossier  submitted  for  this 
variation, it was understood that at the time of data disqualification these samples were beyond 
the  validated  long-term  storage  stability  for  the  study  results  for  KANUMA  and  could  not  be 
reanalysed.  These  samples  were,  therefore,  unreportable.  The  Applicant  should  clarify  if  PK 
samples collected in the KANUMA studies were included in the 86% of total number of samples 
reanalysed  and  reported  as  meeting  the  criteria  recommended  by  EMA  in  the  incurred  sample 
reanalysis.(OC) 
Regarding the inspection report, it has not been provided by the MAH. It should be provided in order to 
see  the  initial  findings  and  issues.  In  addition  the  MAH  should  give  a  list  of  GCP/GCLP  inspections 
performed by European or other authorities outside EU during the same periods as the KANUMA studies 
periods at the CRO. The inspection results and the corresponding outcome should be discussed.(OC)  
Conclusion 
Partly resolved 
Question 2 
The  population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  has  been  conducted  to  support  the  proposed  posology  and 
pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  sebelipase  alpha  in  sections  4.2  and  5.2  of  the  SmPC.  There  are, 
however, issues with the current population pharmacokinetic analyses. 
Therefore,

a. The applicant is requested to confirm the proposed posology and pharmacokinetic statements of 
the SmPC. The applicant is asked to perform additional simulations using an updated final PK model 
to identify alternative dosing weight ranges leading to comparable exposure as observed in adults. 
Further, exposure comparison between paediatrics and adults should also be conducted in different 
age ranges of paediatrics to evaluate the current posology, 
b. The assessment of bodyweight effect on clearance and volume of distribution with an estimated 
exponent is not supported in view of the limited data in the lower age subgroup; data from only 9 
patients  of  <  4  years  old  were  available.  Bodyweight  should  be  implemented  in  the  model  using 
allometric  scaling  with  fixed  exponents  of  0.75  and  1  for  all  CL  and  V  parameters,  respectively. 
Additional  effect  of  age/maturation  should  be  tested  on  this  model,  including  body  weight.  It  is 
noticed  that  the  current  methodology  of  allometric  scaling  with  estimated  model  parameters  is 
incorrect. All clearance and volume of distribution parameters need to be scaled if allometric scaling 
is  applied  (irrespective  of  estimated  or  fixed  allometric  scaling  exponents),  which  is  most  likely 
resulting  in  the  high  RSE  observed  for  Vp  and  the  high  amount  of  unexplained  between-subject 
variability in the model. As a result, the influence of body weight and age cannot be assessed.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Part a: 
Exploration of an improved Pop-PK model was performed as requested in Questions 2b and 7. This Pop-
PK model is referred to as the “current best model” (CBM) in these responses, and includes the PAM 
Pop-PK model plus addition of data from patients who received placebo and then switched to sebelipase 
alfa. None of the evaluated model changes (see the table below) resulted in a better model compared 
to the existing PAM Pop-PK model. 
It should be noted that the previously submitted PAM PK/PD report (2019 Sebelipase Alfa PK/PD Report) 
highlighted that exposure does not inform the PD response (eg, ALT and LDL-C) levels, given the short 
half-life and long dosing interval for sebelipase alfa. Thus, acceptance criteria and target levels of these 
endpoints were not prespecified for selecting the dosing regimens. Across the Alexion clinical studies in 
LAL-D, dose modifications were based on clinical response and not systemic drug concentrations or drug 
exposure (PK) parameters. Per the assorted clinical protocols, dose increases were permitted for patients 
who  exhibited  a  suboptimal  clinical  response,  as  determined  based  on  protocol-specified  criteria 
reflecting  the  key  disease  manifestations.  Dose  reductions  were  also  permitted  in  the  event  of  poor 
tolerability. 
Sebelipase alfa is a recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase (rhLAL) that binds to cell surface receptors 
via glycans expressed on the protein (Sands, 2001; Sly, 2006), which facilitate its uptake into lysosomes, 
the drug’s site of action. These glycans target uptake via receptors expressed on a number of cell types, 
including Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, in which substrate accumulation leads to disease pathogenesis. 
The described N-glycan structures are common to those found in human proteins and have been shown 
to facilitate protein uptake into cells via the macrophage mannose or mannose-6-phosphate receptors 
(Stahl, 1978; Coutinho, 2012). 
Sebelipase alfa is an ERT that exhibits a nonsystemic site of drug action; the previously submitted PAM 
PK/PD  report  confirms  that  exposure  does  not  inform  the  PD  response,  indicating  that  systemic  drug 
exposure does not inform dosing or dosing recommendations for sebelipase alfa. This is supported by 
Kanuma dosing once every 2 weeks for a compound with mean predicted terminal elimination half-life 
of approximately 3 hours and is consistent with dosing recommendations for other ERTs for lysosomal 
Assessment report

storage  disorders  (eg,  Cerezyme®,  Fabrazyme®,  Replagal™,  and  VPRIV®  SmPCs).  The  reason  for 
characterizing the PK of sebelipase alfa is mainly to assess systemic availability following dosing. 
Considering the above, ALT and LDL-C simulations comparing exposure and response between pediatric 
and adult patients in the PAM PK/PD report (2019 Sebelipase Alfa PK/PD Report Figures 7 and 9), and 
completing the requested modeling work in these responses, Alexion believes that the 2019 adult versus 
pediatric simulations are sufficient to support the proposed PK statements and proposed posology in the 
EU SmPC. 
Part b: 
To  address  this  request,  it  is  necessary  to  consider the  following: 1)  if  the  data  are  sufficient  for the 
lower  age  patients,  and  2)  if  the  model  building  approach  was  correct.  Based  on  previous  Alexion 
submissions and goodness-of-fit (GOF) plots from Pop-PK modelling of sebelipase alfa (see response to 
Question 6), sufficient PK data are available for younger patients. 
To test the different Pop-PK models requested (M1, M2, and M3), each model was compared with the 
CBM (see the table below) to assess if a requested model was better and should be used as the final 
Pop-PK model. 
Table 60 - Requested Model Evaluations – Current Best Model 
The M1 model applied body weight based allometric scaling to all clearance and volume parameters (CL, 
Q, Vc, and Vp). The M2 model applied body weight based allometric scaling to CL/Vc fixing the allometric 
exponents to 0.75 and 1.0 for CL and Vc, respectively. The M3 model added a maturation covariate to 
M2. The CBM was found to be a better model than M1, M2 and M3 models. For sebelipase alfa Pop-PK 
model development, M1 and M2 were tested previously, but were not included in the PK/PD report (2019 
Sebelipase Alfa PK/PD Report) as the focus of the report was to answer the specific PAM questions. The 
M3 model structure was tested during model development as well; however, the allometric exponents 
were estimated and not fixed. 
Comparison of the parameter estimates for the CBM versus M1, M2, and M3 is provided in the tables 
below. In these tables, it should be noted, for the CBM, relative standard error (RSE)% for Vp improved 
from 66% (see response to Question 8) to 29.7%. This is likely due to including the PK data from the 
patients  who  received  placebo  and  then  switched  to  active  treatment,  and  not  because  of  incorrect 
modelling of body weight-based allometry. Additional Pop-PK models were requested to be tested (see 
response  to  Question  10),  and  these  models  were  not  found  better  compared  with  the  CBM  either, 
especially for Vp, the RSE was 34.2% when allometry was fixed to 1 for V and to 0.75 for CL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 131/200 
 
 
  
  
 
In conclusion, the model submitted as part of the post authorization measure (ie, the 2019 PAM model) 
is  still  the  best  Pop-PK  model  structure,  and  it  was  technically  improved  by  including  PK  data  from 
patients who received placebo and then switched to active treatment (ie, the CBM).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The applicant has provided model with fixed allometric components. Even if statistically less performing 
than  the  CBM  model,  this  model  is  considered  more  reliable  given  the  limited  amount  of  data  in  the 
paediatric  population.  Given  the  very  close  values  of  all  the  remaining  parameters  of  the  model,  no 
important impact is expected on the predicted exposure levels and the starting dose recommendation. 
In the absence of PK exposure comparison between the adults and the different age groups, it cannot 
be concluded that the POPPK data are supportive of the recommended starting dose.

Question 3 
Concerning the immunogenicity assays, the Applicant is requested to determine the cut-points of the 
target populations using the pre-treatment samples from the completed studies LAL-CL02, LAL-CL03, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 133/200 
 
 
  
  
 
 
LAL-CL04, LAL-CL06 and LAL-CL08 to confirm the assay cut points determined with samples from healthy 
drug-naïve subjects. A statistical comparison is expected. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
At this stage, Alexion is unable to calculate population or disease specific cut-points for the neutralizing 
antibody (NAb) assays due to a lack of pretreatment sample data from the study, and the samples now 
being  outside  long  term  stability  limits.  Samples  were  only  tested  for  NAb  status  when  they  were 
determined  to  be  antidrug  antibody  (ADA)  positive,  and  no  patients  were  at  baseline.  Pretreatment 
samples are all 4 to 9 years old currently, and no longer valid for analysis. 
For the ADA assay, Alexion will use the combined pretreatment data from Studies LAL-CL02, LAL-CL03, 
LAL-CL04, LAL-CL06, and LAL-CL08 to evaluate specific cut-points for children (< 18 years old) and adult 
(≥ 18 years old) populations. Due to the small number of infants included in the sebelipase alfa clinical 
development program, infants will be included with the population of children. A statistical comparison 
based  upon  the  95%  confidence  intervals  of  the  validation  and  newly  established  cut-points  will  be 
conducted  to  identify  any  significant  differences.  This  analysis  is  ongoing  and  Alexion  commits  to 
providing the results to the EMA by July 2020. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
For the NAb assay, the MAH is reporting that no pre-treatment samples are available anymore (out-of-
stability) and the samples were only tested in case of ADA positive results. This is acknowledged.  Since 
the investigation of the impact of the immune response to sebelipase on PK, efficacy and safety has been 
investigated at NAb level and ADA level as well, this issue is not pursued. 
For the ADA assay, the MAH has committed to provide the statistical comparison of the validation cut-
point  (healthy  subjects)  and  the  newly  established  cut  points  (target  population)  by  July  2020.  The 
observed false positive error rate of the clinical study baseline samples, after excluding the samples with 
pre-existing ADA, using the validation cut point should also be taken into account in the discussion on 
the reliability of the validation cut point in the study population.(OC) 
Conclusion 
Unresolved issue 
Question 4 
Concerning immunogenicity, the MAH has investigated the impact of ADA on exposure using a covariate 
analysis  methodology  on the  final  Pop-PK  model.  But  the total  number  of  patients  with  samples  with 
measurable  concentrations  of  sebelipase  alfa  and  an  ADA  status  used  in  this  analysis  is  limited  in 
comparison to the totality of data provided (3 ADA+ on 19 ADA+ in total; 72 ADA- on 106 ADA- in total). 
The effect of NAb was not formally tested in the population PK model due to the low number of samples 
with both a measurable concentration and a positive NAb (ie, a total of 1 positive NAb in 1 patient). Thus 
no  conclusion  can  be  currently  drawn  due  to  the  limited  information  available.  The  SmPC  should  be 
updated in that sense, unless otherwise justified.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
Alexion acknowledges EMA’s feedback and agrees to update the EU SmPC to reflect this position. As 
such, the EU SmPC text has been updated (below in bold underlined). 
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Immunogenicity 
As  with  all  therapeutic  proteins,  there  is  potential  for  immunogenicity.  In  the  sebelipase  alfa  clinical 
program, patients were routinely tested for anti-sebelipase alfa antidrug antibodies (ADAs) to determine 
the immunogenicity potential of sebelipase alfa. Patients who tested positive for ADAs were also tested 
for  inhibitory  antibody  activity.  The  presence  of  inhibitory  activity  has  been  detected  at  some 
postbaseline  timepoints  in  clinical  studies  (see  section  4.8).  Overall,  there  is  no  clear  relationship 
between  either  development  of  ADAs/inhibitory  antibody  activity  and  associated 
hypersensitivity reactions or suboptimal clinical response no conclusion on the relationship 
between development of ADAs/NAbs and associated hypersensitivity reactions or suboptimal 
clinical response can be made. 
During  clinical  studies,  a  decrease  in  clinical  response  associated  with  the  development  of  inhibitory 
antibody activity was only observed in 3 patients with a homozygous deletion affecting both alleles of 
genes Lipase A, lysosomal acid (LIPA) and Cholesterol, 25-Hydroxylase (see section 4.8). 
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
Immunogenicity 
There is potential for immunogenicity (see section 4.4). Patients have developed anti-drug antibodies 
(ADA) to sebelipase alfa.  Compared to children and adults, an increased occurrence of ADA positivity 
was observed within the infant population (10/19 patients). 
Among 125 patients with LAL Deficiency enrolled in the clinical studies, 19/125 (15.0%) patients tested 
positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) at some timepoint after starting treatment with KANUMA. Among 
those 19 patients, 11 (58%) also showed the presence of inhibitory antibody activity (NAbs) at some 
postbaseline timepoint. 
Overall,  there  is  no  clear  relationship  between  development  of  ADAs/NAbs  and  associated 
hypersensitivity reactions or suboptimal clinical response no conclusion on the relationship 
between development of ADAs/NAbs and associated hypersensitivity reactions or suboptimal 
clinical response can be made. In clinical studies, 3 patients homozygous for a deletion affecting both 
alleles  of  genes  Lipase  A,  lysosomal  acid  [LIPA]  and  Cholesterol  25-Hydroxylase  developed  inhibitory 
antibody  activity  associated  with  a  suboptimal  clinical  response  (see  section  4.4).  These  patients 
underwent  either  immunomodulatory  therapy  alone  or  in  combination  with  hematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplant (HSCT) or bone marrow transplant (BMT), resulting in improved clinical response to KANUMA. 
Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for the development of immunogenicity. Nineteen 
of 125 (15%) patients with LAL Deficiency had at least 1◦postbaseline antidrug antibody (ADA) positive 
result, 9 of which were children and adult patients. For children and adult patients with LAL Deficiency,

ADA positivity was transient with generally low titers of ADAs reported. No apparent correlation of 
antibody development to altered sebelipase alfa pharmacokinetics was observed conclusion 
on the impact of immunogenicity on sebelipase alfa exposure can be made. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The  limited  information  available  hampers  the  assessment  of  the  impact  of  ADA/NAb  on  sebelipase 
exposure. The MAH has adequately updated the section 5.2 as requested to reflect that no conclusion 
can  be  currently  drawn  regarding  the  impact  of  ADAs/NAbs  on  sebelipase  exposure.  The  proposed 
changes  in  the  sections  4.4  and  4.8  are  also  accepted.  However,  to  avoid  redundant  statement,  the 
detailed  information  on  the  ADA  incidence  should  only  be  provided  in  the  section  4.8  with  a  cross-
reference to the section 4.8 in the section 5.2 : “As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential 
for the development of immunogenicity. Nineteen of 125 (15%) patients with LAL Deficiency had at least 
1◦postbaseline antidrug antibody (ADA) positive result, 9 of which were children and adult patients. For 
children and adult patients with LAL Deficiency, ADA positivity was transient with generally low titers of 
ADAs  reported”.(OC)  In  addition,  to  give  a  full  overview  of  all  patient  populations  to  the  healthcare 
provider, the following statement on the ADA incidence in infants provided in the document 2.7.2 should 
be reported in the section 4.8: “On the other hand, persistence of ADA positivity was observed for all 10 
infants and persistence of high titer ADAs was observed for 3 of the 10 infants.” (OC) 
Conclusion 
Partly resolved 
POPPK modelling 
Question 5 
The final POPPK model was conducted on 714 samples on 880 considered PK samples. The reasons for 
not including 116 reportable samples in the POPPK analysis were: pre- or post-dose blank, a measurable 
concentration before the first dose, TAD>10 and not BLQ, missing sampling time and amount of previous 
dose imputed. The MAH is requested to clarify why a total of 1122 study samples with reportable results 
(as calculated based on Table 5 Module 2.7.1 and excluding the samples excluded from LAL-CL01 due 
to data integrity issues and from study LAL-CL08 due to errors in dosing records) has not been considered 
for inclusion in the POPPK analysis. In addition, the exclusion criteria ‘TAD>10’ should be clarified. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
For clarification, Module 2.7.1 Table 5 contains accounting of unreportable samples for the reasons of 
the  data  integrity  issue  and  of  exceeding  long-term  stability,  but  not  for  analytical  reasons  such  as 
insufficient sample volume. Additionally, this Module 2.7.1 Table 5 contained typographical errors, which 
are now corrected and updated below to include samples unreportable for analytical reasons to complete 
the  accounting of  samples  (see  the  table  below).  Most  of  the  discrepancy  noted  in the  number of  PK 
samples comes from Study LAL-CL02, where, as discussed above, Module 2.7.1 Table 5 had indicated 
that  291  of  973  PK  samples  were  non-reportable  for  this  study,  which  was  incorrect  due  to  a 
typographical error (actual number of non-reportable samples 203/973; bioanalytical study report 8291-
767; Table 6), while the Pop-PK analyses indicated that there were 444 reportable PK samples (Module

2.7.2 Table 18). This has no impact on the total number of PK samples considered in the PAM pop-PK 
analysis (714 samples, Module 2.7.2 Table 5). 
Table 64 - Summary of Non-Reportable Sample Results (correcting Module 2.7.1 Table 5) 
aSebelipase alfa concentrations for study LAL-CL01 and for a portion of Study LAL-CL04 were analysed using ELISA-
0558 but were determined to be unreportable due to lack of long term stability. 
For the submitted PAM Pop-PK analysis (2019 Sebelipase Alfa PK/PD Report), extension data from all 
studies  were  excluded  due  to  a  higher  variability  in  PK  data  typically  resulting  from  fewer  visits  and 
reduced sample collection. This resulted in exclusion of PK data from 30 patients in Study LAL-CL02 who 
received  placebo  (no  treatment)  during  the  treatment  period  and  then  switched  to  active  treatment 
during  the  extension  period  (2019  Sebelipase  Alfa  PK/PD  Report).  The  table  below  shows  the  counts 
when these 30 patients are included in the PK dataset. With inclusion of these 30 patients, the PK data 
used in the Pop-PK analysis increase from 714 to 850 PK samples.

Also,  high  PK  levels  late  in  the  dosing  interval  (time  after  dose  [TAD]  >  10  hours)  were  considered

biologically implausible based on the mean predicted terminal elimination half-life of sebelipase alfa of 
approximately 3 hours and a once every 1 or 2 week dosing frequency and, thus, were removed from 
the dataset both in the PAM analyses and in the current analyses. All patients who met the criteria for 
TAD  >  10  hours  had  biologically  implausible  drug  concentrations  >  335  hours  (ie,  approximately  2 
weeks) after the last dose (see the table below).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The applicant has provided the requested clarification for data exclusion. 
Conclusion 
Issue not pursued. 
Question 6 
In view of the identified issues with data integrity and related data exclusion, the applicant is asked to 
provide  the distribution of the data used for POPPK modelling by age group and to discuss whether there 
were enough data in the different age subgroups (2-4, 4-6, 6-12, and 12-18 y.o) to allow adequate PK 
characterization in the different age groups. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Limited PK data in pediatric patients with an ultra-rare disease is not unusual. Alexion has previously 
submitted Pop-PK models for eculizumab (aHUS 10-003 PK/PD Report Table 8) and ravulizumab (aHUS 
Pop-PK-PD Report Section 14.2) for the treatment of pediatric patients with atypical hemolytic uremic 
syndrome (aHUS); N = 10 < 5 years of age and N = 6 < 4 years of age, respectively. The distribution 
of sebelipase alfa concentrations by age group are presented in the table below. The adequacy of PK 
characterization can be assessed using goodness-of-fit (GOF) plots (see the figures below). For patients 
6 years of age and older, the Pop-PK model characterizes the data well. For patients less than 6 years 
of age, the GOF plots indicate that the Pop-PK model still characterizes the sparse PK data well. Overall, 
age stratified GOF plots concluded that there were enough data in the different age subgroups (2-4, 4-

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
No bias was graphically detectable across the different age groups. However the data are not considered 
very informative given the limited number of patients in the different age subgroups (5 vs 2 vs 6 in the 
3 age subgroups). 
Use of fixed allometric exponents for the effect of weight on clearance and volume component would be 
more appropriate for children (see MSWG Q&A on paediatric PK).  However, given the values of estimated 
exponents and the values of other parameters in models CBM and M2, and given the fact that the dose 
is intended to be adjusted based on clinical benefit-risk assessment, this issue is not pursued (also see 
our answer to question 2). 
However,  there  are  discrepancies  between  the  numbers  of  patients  reported  in  the  different  age 
subgroups in the table provided in AtQ6 and numbers of patients reported in the table 4 provided in the 
SmPC. They should be clarified.(OC; see also question 20)

Question 7 
Nonlinear clearance should also be tested in the POPPK model using individual predicted concentrations 
as exposure marker. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As requested by the Agency, nonlinear elimination was tested in the Pop-PK model (Appendix Section 
7.1).  A  model  including  parallel  linear  and  nonlinear  clearance  mechanism  was  used  for  assessing 
potential target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD). The Michaelis–Menten approximation of the TMDD 
model assumes quasi steady-state and rapid binding/dissociation between the target and sebelipase alfa 
(Gabrielsson, 2016; Gibiansky, 2008). These models have traditionally been used to describe nonlinear 
elimination of large molecules at low concentrations (eg, monoclonal antibodies). The above model was 
used to assess the concentration-time profiles of sebelipase alfa. The model did not successfully converge 
and was most likely over-parameterized considering the small number of samples collected during the 
elimination  phase.  As  part  of  an  exploratory  analysis,  a  model  including  only  a  nonlinear  (Michaelis-
Menten) clearance was used to assess the concentration-time profiles of sebelipase alfa. These models, 
including  only  a  nonlinear  clearance,  have  traditionally  been  used  to  assess  nonlinearity  at  high 
concentrations  for  small  molecules  (eg,  ethanol,  phenytoin)  (Gabrielsson,  2016).  While  this  model 
successfully converged, and achieved a minimum objective function value of ~50 units better compared 
with the linear model (see table below), there were problems with the minimization indicating instability 
in  the  model  and,  thus,  the  parameter  estimates  should  be  interpreted  cautiously.  Typically,  initial 
estimates, over parameterization, the number of PK samples collected, and the distribution of sample 
times  over  the  PK  profile  are  sources  that  may  cause  a  model  to  become  unstable.  While  the  model 
including only a nonlinear clearance was associated with a lower objective function value, it is important 
to underscore that the concentrations of sebelipase alfa declined in a linear manner on a semi-log scale, 
suggesting  that  the  elimination  of  sebelipase  alfa  was  linear  (ie,  first  order)  and  not  concentration 
dependent.

EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 143/200 
 
 
  
  
 
Additionally,  comparison  of  GOF  plots  (see  figure  below)  for  the  linear  and  nonlinear  Pop-PK  models 
demonstrate the results are almost identical, further supporting that the linear model is the right choice. 
Figure 8 - Comparison of Goodness-of-Fit Between Linear and Nonlinear Pop-PK Models 
Overall, based on the Pop-PK models tested, a GOF comparison between linear and nonlinear models, 
and the observed terminal elimination phase of sebelipase alfa, first-order elimination (linear) adequately 
characterized the clearance in the range of concentrations considered in the PAM Pop-PK analysis.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
It is understood that a the data available did not support adequate characterization of the nonlinearity 
of the clearance that could be a more appropriate model for sebelipase (as also shown by lower OFV). 
Conclusion 
Issue not pursued. 
Question 8 
It is noted that Vp parameters was poorly estimated using the updated POPPK model with RSE of 66%, 
this should be discuss in particular in light of data exclusion. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Sparse samples were collected over a limited timeframe because of the nature of the population (ie, an 
ultra-rare disease in pediatric patients) and the short elimination half-life of sebelipase alfa. The data 
included a significant number of samples with concentrations below the limit of quantitation (BLQ); thus, 
a limited number of samples were available to robustly characterize the terminal elimination phase. 
Based on the above limitations associated with the nature of the population and the short half-life of 
sebelipase alfa, the estimated Vp was associated with a higher level of uncertainty. 
Based  on  the  analysis  including  patients  who  received  placebo  (no  treatment)  and  then  switched  to 
active treatment (see response to Question 2b), the Vp of sebelipase alfa was more robustly estimated, 
with  a  percent  relative  standard  error  (RSE%)  of  29.7%  (Appendix  Section  4.2;  Table  3). 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  with  RSE%  values  <  30%  are  typically  recognized  as  being  robustly 
estimated (Bonate, 2006). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
It is understood that a the data available did not support adequate characterization of Vp. It is agreed 
that this has limited value on dosing recommendation for children. 
Conclusion 
Issue closed. 
Question 9 
Model misspecifications are observed on the IPRED vs OBS and the pcVPC  graphic: this should be further 
discussed.  Moreover,  model  fitting  performances  (GOF  nad  pcVPC)  should  also  be  provided  by  age 
subgroups.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
Individual predicted versus observed concentrations are presented in the figure below. Please note that 
the  GOF  plot  presented  was  from  an  analysis  where  the  dataset  included  patients  who  had  received 
placebo and then switched to active treatment (see response to Question 2b). 
Alexion  agrees  some  individual  concentrations  were  underpredicted  with  the  PAM  Pop-PK  model. 
However, the locally weighted scatter-plot smoothing (LOESS) line (red line) was superimposed on the 
unity line (dashed black line) and suggests that overall the model was associated with a good prediction 
of the observed data. 
Figure 9 - Goodness-of-Fit – Individual Predicted Concentrations – Current Best Model 
The GOF plot of individual predictions versus observed concentrations as well as other GOF plots can be 
found  in  the  response  to  Question  6.  The  figure  below  reproduces  the  individual  prediction  versus 
observed concentration plot by age, from the response to Question 6. As seen in the figure below the 
LOESS still aligns well with the line of unity, for each age group panel, indicating a good prediction match 
with the observed data even when the GOF plots are stratified by age.

tendency for sebelipase alfa concentrations. In the second figure below, the observed versus predicted 
profiles were similar to that seen in the first figure below indicating that even when stratified by age 
group, the model captured the central tendency of the sebelipase alfa concentrations. 
Overall, the CBM resulted in adequate GOF and pcVPC assessments indicating the PAM Pop-PK model 
characterizes the observed sebelipase alfa concentrations well.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The pc VPC results show the average concentration values are overall well predicted by the model but 
not the variability. In particular, the lower limit of the prediction interval is very poorly estimated by the 
model  and  therefore  unreliable  (with  very  wide  CI  including  zero  across  the  all  concentration  range). 
This could be explained by the lack of informative data to adequate estimation of the variability in the 
data. This is also reflected by the very high value of the proportional component of the residual error. 
Conclusion 
Issue not pursued. 
Question 10 
For  adequate  graphical  evaluation,  some  missing  plots  should be  provided.  NPDEs  distribution  should 
also be provided as well as NPDE vs PRED and vs time plots. In addition, the applicant could present ETA 
plots versus bodyweight and age for: 
- model without bodyweight or age as covariates, 
 - model with bodyweight as covariate,  
- model with age as covariate.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
This  response  addresses  3  requests.  First,  provide  GOF  plots  for  the  CBM  (Part  a).  Second,  provide 
normalized prediction distribution error (NPDE) plots for the CBM (Part b). Lastly, using the CBM, test 
the inclusion/exclusion of body weight and age covariates and show the ETA plots to support the choice 
of covariate used in the CBM (Part c).

The Figure below shows the GOF plots for the CBM. Some points do deviate from the line of unity (dashed 
line),  but  overall,  the  LOESS  fit  (red  solid  line)  to  the  data  suggests  little  to  no  bias  for  the  overall 
characterization of the sebelipase alfa predicted concentrations. These GOF plots are also shown broken

Summary of the MAH’s response 
Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is a lipid metabolism disorder with a strong impact on liver function and 
LDL-C level. The liver injury parameter ALT was chosen as the more specific liver injury PD parameter 
because elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) can also be a consequence of other physiological 
factors (eg, strenuous exercise) and are less specific. Both ALT and LDL-C improved following sebelipase 
alfa ERT in the patient populations investigated. Other parameters, eg, liver fat content and high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), took longer to respond; however, these responses supported the initial 
effect observed in ALT and LDL-C. 
It  is  important  to  highlight  that  acceptance  criteria  and  target  levels  of  these  endpoints  were  not 
prespecified for selecting the dosing regimens. There is a knowledge gap in the relationship between the 
2 biomarkers and clinical efficacy. In addition, there are large between subject variabilities for the key 
model parameter estimates (E0, Imax, and Kout) in the developed PK/PD models (see both tables in the 
response to Question 14). These 2 issues render our ability in setting the acceptance criteria and target 
levels for ALT and LDL-C in a clinical meaningful manner. Across the sebelipase alfa clinical studies, dose 
modifications  were  based  on  clinical  response  (a  balance  between  benefit  and  risk)  and  not  systemic 
drug concentrations or drug exposure (ie, PK) parameter. Per protocol, dose increases were permitted 
for  patients  who  exhibited  a  suboptimal  clinical  response,  as  determined  based  on  protocol-specified 
criteria reflecting the key disease manifestations. Dose reductions were also permitted in the event of 
poor tolerability. 
Sebelipase alfa is a recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase and is approved for the treatment of LAL-
D.  Sebelipase  alfa  binds  to  cell  surface  receptors  via  glycans  expressed  on  the  protein  and  is 
subsequently internalized into lysosomes, the drug’s site of action. The initial lipid metabolism is a local 
phenomenon within the lysosomes of cells, and local drug exposure at cellular level rather than systemic 
exposure drives the efficacy response to therapy. This ERT, as with other ERTs for lysosomal storage 
disorders indicated in particular in Gaucher disease, Hunter syndrome and Fabry disease, exhibits a non-
systemic  site  of  drug  action  so  systemic  drug  exposures  do  not  inform  dosing  or  dosing 
recommendations. This is further supported by dosing of once every 2 weeks for a compound with mean 
predicted terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
It is understood that the 2 biomarkers were chosen based on their sensitivity to the disease status and 
to the drug effects. 
It is also understood that there has been no attempt to quantitatively characterize the link between the 
2 biomarkers and the actual meaningful clinical response. The clinical relevance of these biomarkers is 
therefore not quantitatively characterize. This drastically decrease the value of the PK/PD exercise, which 
does not have any interest to inform the dose in this context.

Question 12 
The exclusion of placebo arm data from the PK/PD analysis is not acceptable given that these data could 
be informative for adequate description of the time course of the 2 biomarkers. The MAH is asked to 
address this issue. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Alexion believes that in the setting of treating LAL-D, in patients with aberrantly high PD levels due to 
enzyme deficiency (ie, ALT and LDL-C), inclusion of PD data for patients not receiving treatment was not 
expected to be particularly informative. However, in response to review feedback from EMA, the data 
from the placebo (no-treatment) group were added to the PK/PD models to assess if PD data, when no 
treatment  was  given,  added  meaningful  information  to  the  characterization  of  the  PD  response  or 
perhaps insight into disease progression for the short time (22 weeks) during which the PD data were 
collected. 
To include the PD data when no treatment was given, the PK/PD models for ALT and LDL-C were further 
developed to add a no-treatment effect submodel. Because this submodel leveraged PD data collected 
over time, when treatment was not given, the submodel could also be thought of as a disease progression 
submodel to the PK/PD models. 
Overall, inclusion of PD data, when no treatment was given, and addition of a no-treatment submodel 
provided  a  slightly  better  ALT  model  (some  parameters  had  lower  RSE%  and  less  variability),  and  a 
slightly  worse  LDL-C  model,  but  did  not  further  inform  dosing,  safety,  or  efficacy  (see  examples  in 
response to Question 14). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The requested action was taken by the applicant. 
Conclusion 
Issue closed. 
Question 13 
The selection of the structural model in particular absence of testing alternative structural model with 
drug clearance from the central compartment and outside the effect compartment need to be justified 
for both ALT and LDL-cholesterol. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As noted in the response to Question 11, ERTs often have nonsystemic sites of drug action resulting in 
systemic drug exposures, which do not inform selection of dose or dose regimen. For sebelipase alfa, 
the  Pop-PK  model  supported  that  exposure-response  was  not  directly  linked  to  sebelipase  alfa 
concentration, ie, drug with short half-life (~3 hours) supporting once every week (qw) (or once every 
Assessment report

other week [qow]) dosing. Rather than test new features in the Pop-PK model, focus was on modelling 
the PD data. 
For the PK/PD model, an effect compartment overcomes the dose-concentration-response disconnect. 
Biologically,  using  a  turnover  model,  sebelipase  alfa  concentrations  in  the  effect  compartment  are 
expected to inhibit the rate of production of ALT (Kin) and stimulate the rate of degradation of LDL-C 
(Kout). The observed ALT and LDL-C data suggested a delayed response; therefore, an indirect response 
model  was  used.  Given  the  original  submission  work  supporting  the  initial  Marketing  Authorization 
Application for Kanuma was not able to develop a PK/PD model, the PK/PD model currently proposed, 
while limited due to the amount of available data, is a step forward in quantifying our understanding of 
the dose-response relationship driving efficacy. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
This is endorsed. 
Conclusion 
Issue closed. 
Question 14 
Key parameters (e.g. IC50 and  EC50) were fixed without justifications of the source and the plausibility 
of the values used. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Fixed  parameters,  in  the  models,  are  not  identifiable  for  reasons  related  to  the  disconnect  between 
systemic exposure and response (see response to Question 11), ie, short half-life and dosing once every 
1 or 2 weeks. Thus, the model is insensitive to some parameters that need to be fixed to a value for the 
model analysis to complete successfully. The rationale for the fixed values includes: 1) the first-order 
rate  of  elimination  from  the  effect  compartment  (Ke0)  needs  to  be  small  enough  that  there  is  some 
accumulation in the effect compartment, and 2) the half maximal concentration (IC50, EC50) needs to 
be small to ensure that the model reflects the clinical response observed in the subjects, ie, response at 
or near the top of the maximum effect (Emax) curve. The final parameter estimates for the ALT PK/ PD 
model and for the LDL-C PK/PD model are presented in the tables below, respectively. Goodness-of-fit 
plots can be found in the responses to Questions 15, 16, and 17. 
The first table shows the parameter estimates for the ALT PK/PD model with a no-treatment submodel. 
The typical value for the no-treatment effect (no-treatment effect [fraction]), while significantly different 
from  0,  is  small  (-0.0113).  This  fractional  effect  is  the  equivalent  of  a  typical  patient  at  baseline 
experiencing a 1% increase in the zero-order rate of synthesis, resulting in a small increase from baseline 
in ALT. The between-subject variability (BSV) adds some flexibility in the model to account for the fact 
that some subjects do tend to have either a positive or negative change from baseline while on placebo 
(ie,  no  treatment).  The  covariates  suggest  younger  subjects  tend  to  have  lower  baseline  ALT  levels 
followed by larger increases in ALT as compared to older patients (negative placebo effect means ALT 
goes up instead of down); however, the youngest patient in the no-treatment group was 4 years of age.

The  second  table  shows  the  parameter  estimates  for  the  LDL-C  PK/PD  model  with  a  no-treatment 
submodel.  The  typical  value  for  the  no-treatment  effect  (no-treatment  slope),  is  not  statistically 
significantly  different  from  0.  The  point  estimate  of  0.0823  is  the  equivalent  of  a  typical  subject 
experiencing a linear increase in the first-order degradation rate of LDL-C of 8.23% over the course of 
1 year (52 weeks), resulting in a small decrease from baseline in LDL-C. The between-subject variability 
(BSV) adds some flexibility in the model to account for the fact that some subjects do tend to have either 
a  positive  or  negative  change  from  baseline  while  on  no  treatment.  The  covariates  suggest  younger 
subjects tended to have lower baseline LDL-C levels followed by a smaller no-treatment (time) effect, 
leading  to  slightly  larger  decreases  in  LDL-C  over  time  as  compared  to  older  subjects;  however,  the 
youngest patient in the no-treatment group was 4 years of age. 
Overall, inclusion of PD data, when no treatment was given, did not further inform dosing, safety, or 
efficacy; however, including the data did result in more comprehensive models perhaps capturing disease 
progression, over a short duration of treatment (22 weeks).

explained  the  rationale  for  imputation  of  fixed  parameter  values.  This  is  considered  to  still  partly 
arbitrary. However, given the limited use of the PK/PD model to inform the dose selection, this issue is 
not pursued.

Question 16 
Model fitting performances (GOF nad pcVPC) should also be provided by age subgroups. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Goodness-of-fit plots are shown in the first, second and third figures or the ALT PK/ PD model and in the 
fourth,  fifth  and  sixth  figures  for  the  LDL-C  PK/PD  model.  The  dataset  used  for  the  PK/PD  modeling 
included PD measurements for patients who did not receive treatment (the CBM, ie, PAM + no-treatment 
submodel).  The  plots  are  organized  into  “all  data”  or  “stratified  by  age  group,”  and  show  that  model 
predictions  and  residuals  characterize  the  observed  ALT  and  LDL-C  data  well  even  when  stratified  by 
age. 
Taken together (with results in Questions 14, 15, and 17), the GOF plots characterize the PD data well. 
The pcVPC plots for the ALT and LDL-C PK/PD CBMs are shown in the response to Question 15.

Clinical Efficacy 
Question 18 
The  Applicant’s  proposed  increase  of  the  maximum  dosage  in  infants  to  5mg/kg  qw  does  not  have 
sufficient  data  to  unequivocally  support  this  change.  However,  given  the  clinical  knowledge  on  the 
aggressiveness of early-onset LAL-D and the overall trend that seems to emerge from the limited data 
that  there  are  indeed  patients  that  benefit  from  higher  doses,  a  higher  maximal  dose  in  case  of 
insufficient response could be accepted if the MAH provides a guidance in the SmPC on how and when 
to  escalate  or  de-escalate  the  dose,  and  what  to  do  in  case  an  infant’s  situation  does  not  become 
controlled even at the higher maximal dose. Details on the format and content of this guidance is left to 
the MAH to devise and propose. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Across the sebelipase alfa clinical studies, dose modifications were based on clinical response assessment 
by the Investigators. Per protocol, dose increases were permitted for patients who exhibited a suboptimal 
clinical  response,  as  determined  based  on  protocol-specified  criteria  reflecting  the  key  disease 
manifestations. Dose reductions were also permitted in the event of poor tolerability.  
Clinically,  infants  with  rapidly  progressive  LAL-D  frequently  present  with  elevated  transaminases,  low 
platelet  count,  hypoalbuminemia,  hyperbilirubinemia,  elevated  serum  ferritin,  and  coagulopathy 
(Grabowski, 2012; Jones, 2016). Due to the severity of the disease, infants in the clinical studies received 
more frequent doses (qw) and underwent more frequent protocol-allowed dose escalations in order to 
achieve maximum clinical benefit. Fifteen of the 19 patients received a dose escalation to a dose of 3 
mg/kg qw and 9 patients received a dose escalation to 5 mg/kg qw. Long-term data are available at 
both doses, with a median duration of exposure of 15.409 months (and maximum exposure of 54.540 
months) at a dose of 3 mg/kg qw and a median duration of exposure of 15.901 months (and maximum 
exposure of 39.330 months) at a dose of 5 mg/kg qw.  
Dose escalation to 5 mg/kg qw was generally associated with stabilization of the clinical course in those 
infants who had previously had a suboptimal response at a dose of 3 mg/kg qw (Module 2.7.3.3.2.6.2.2). 
In most patients, dose escalation to 5 mg/kg qw was associated with a clear improvement in growth, as 
evidenced by increases in weight-for-age (WFA) percentile. Serum transaminases and serum lipids also 
generally improved after dose escalation to 5 mg/kg qw. All 3 patients with dual whole gene deletion 
(WGD) had clinical courses that were complicated by high ADA/NAb titers, and all 3 patients required a 
dose escalation to 5 mg/kg qw. Two of the 3 patients had changes consistent with improvement in their 
clinical  course  following  dose  escalation;  1  patient  required  a  further  dose  escalation  to  the  protocol-
defined maximum of 7.5 mg/kg qw.  
No new safety concerns were identified among infants receiving the higher dose of 5 mg/kg qw, and no 
patient receiving this higher dose had a dose reduction due to poor tolerability. An overview of treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by dosage regimen is presented in Module 2.7.4 Table 18. Overall, 
the safety profile was similar in patients treated in the different dosage regimens. At least 1 TEAE was 
reported for all (100%) patients receiving the following doses: 3 mg/kg qow, 3 mg/kg qw, 5 mg/kg qw, 
and  7.5  mg/kg  qw.  A  similar  proportion  of  patients  who  received  3  mg/kg  qw  and  5  mg/kg  qw 
experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent serious adverse event (TESAE) (14/15 patients [93%] and 
9/9 patients [100%], respectively) and at least 1 treatment-related TESAE (4/15 patients [27%] and 
2/9 patients [22%], respectively).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 184/200 
 
 
  
  
In addition, use of a 5 mg/kg qw dose in infants with rapidly progressive LAL-D has support within the 
medical community. A consortium of physicians with experience treating infants with rapidly progressive 
LAL-D,  including  those  associated  with  clinical  sites  involved  in  sebelipase  alfa  clinical  studies,  has 
recently  developed  guidelines  for  the  management  of  patients  with  rapidly  progressive  LAL-D.  These 
guidelines  include  a  recommendation  for  dose  escalation  to  5  mg/kg  qw  based  on  clinical  response 
(Jones, 2018).  
Taking into account EMA’s feedback, Alexion proposes the following updates to the EU SmPC to provide 
further guidance on the dosing recommendations for infant patients (presented in bold underlined):  
Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration  
Infants (< 6 months of age)  
The recommended starting dose in infants (< 6 months of age) presenting with rapidly progressive LAL 
deficiency is 1 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly. Dose escalations to 3 mg/kg 
once  weekly  should  be  considered  based  on  clinical  response  to  clinical  and  biochemical  criteria; 
e.g., poor growth (especially mid-upper arm circumference, MUAC), deteriorating biochemical 
markers (e.g., liver transaminases, ferritin, C-reactive Protein, and coagulation parameters), 
persistent  or  worsening  organomegaly,  increased  frequency  of  intercurrent  infections,  and 
persistent worsening of other symptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal symptoms):  
- a dose escalation to 3 mg/kg should be considered in case of suboptimal clinical response 
after a minimum of 4 infusions;  
- a further dose escalation up to 5 mg/kg should be considered in case of suboptimal clinical 
response after a minimum of additional 4 infusions.  
Further dose adjustments, as a reduction of the dose or an extension of the dose interval, can 
be made on an individual basis based on achievement and maintenance of therapeutic goals. 
Clinical  studies  evaluated  doses  ranging  from  1  to  5  mg/kg  once  weekly,  with  one  patient 
receiving a higher dose of 7.5 mg/kg once weekly (see Section 5.1). Doses higher than 7.5 
mg/kg have not been studied. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
As noted in the initial assessment, it is acknowledged that the dose escalations past the 3 mg/kg limit 
in infants during the clinical programme did not result in worrisome observations in regards to safety 
or immunogenicity responses. Nonetheless, the number of case with escalations to such levels were 
few, which is entirely reasonable given that the condition of LAL-D is ultra-rare in itself, which calls for 
caution and proper addressment in the SmPC. 
As requested the MAH updated the dosing guidance, though a firm guidance for dose de-escalation is 
not provided and a more general statement that dosing adaptation should be considered based on an 
patient’s response. Given that treatment responses in replacement therapies are usually very 
individually bound to a particular patient’s physical and medical parameters, and that treatment with 
Kanuma is done by qualified experts in metabolic diseases, this approach is acceptable. 
The updates to the dosing guidance have not been reprised in the PIL, but given that this document is 
aimed at the patient and not at the healthcare professional who will administrate the treatment this 
can be accepted.

Issue resolved.

 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
SmPC 
Question 19 
The Applicant should update the ADR tables in section 4.8 of the SmPC as to provide frequency 
information for each preferred term instead of for the MeDRa SOC as a whole. Additionally, all causally 
related or reasonably considered as potentially causally related events should be listed by preferred 
term. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Alexion confirms that the adverse drug reaction (ADR) tables in section 4.8 of the SmPC currently display 
frequency information by Preferred Term. All Preferred Terms within each system organ class (SOC) that 
correspond to a given frequency are listed together (ISS Table 14.3.1.23.2.1.2, Table 14.3.1.23.1.1.1). 
For  instance,  in  EU  SmPC  Table  2  (adverse  reactions  reported  in  children  and  adults),  within  the 
gastrointestinal SOC, the Preferred Terms of abdominal pain and diarrhoea each occur very commonly, 
while the Preferred Term of abdominal distension occurs commonly. Nevertheless, to provide additional 
clarity, the format of the ADR tables in section 4.8 of the SmPC (Table 1 for ADR reported in infants and 
Table 2 for ADR reported in children and adults) have been updated to list the Preferred Terms vertically 
(see updated EU SmPC).  
Alexion also confirms that all reported adverse events, regardless of Investigator causality assessment 
at  time  of  report  of  each  individual  event,  were  medically  assessed  by  the  Sponsor  in  aggregate.  As 
such,  all  Preferred  Terms  that  were  considered  causally  related  or  potentially  causally  related  to 
sebelipase alfa treatment were included in the ADR tables. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Though  the  additional  explanation  of  the  MAH  has  clarified  how  the  table  should  be  read,  with  the 
frequency terms relating of the aggregated preferred terms on the right, this is not the usual way of 
presenting such information. For clarity’s sake each individual preferred term should be matched with a 
singular frequency term, in a respective left to right reading; eg. Anaphylactic reaction: common, eyelid 
oedema: common. 
In itself an aggregated display could be acceptable if the column with frequencies is moved to the right 
side of the column listing the preferred terms. This will prevent the issue that the current presentation 
may be misinterpreted as being SOC | overall frequency of adverse events in SOC | preferred terms (of 
adverse events noted in SOC). 
Additionally, the Applicant claims that all preferred terms considered, in aggregate, causally related or 
potentially  causally  related  to  sebelipase  alfa  treatment  have  been  included  in  the  table.  However, 
between the SmPC as presented in the latest renewal procedure and the version presented in this type-
II application certain preferred terms have disappeared from the table (for example menorrhagia). In 
itself  this  could  be  perhaps  be  due  to  the  aggregate  analysis  finding  certain  AEs  no  longer  fulfil  the 
requirements for being labelled (potentially) related to IMP. However, the decision-process in that case 
is not clear.

As an example, in the SmPC as presented in the renewal dossier the preferred term ‘menorrhagia’ was 
seen as a (potentially) related AE in non-infants with a a frequency classification of ‘common’. However, 
in the SmPC as currently proposed for the type II variation under consideration, this preferred term has 
been removed from the frequency listing. In the provided ISS listings this event is indeed not listed in 
the Table 14.3.1.22.1.2.1 (Related Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) by Onset >4 and <=24 
Hours After End of Infusion, Study and Pooled Safety Set 1), but the listing of patient 2112-063 from 
the LAL-CL02 study does however show the event of menorrhagia as being assessed with a ‘possibly 
related’  relationship  to  the  IMP.It  is  thus  not  clear  how  these  reclassifications  were  decided  upon, 
especially  for  events  that  were  previously  part  of  the  SmPC  AE  frequency  table  and  have  now  been 
dropped. The Applicant is asked to further clarify how this decision process was undertaken. 
Conclusion 
The proposed changes to the AE frequency table are a step in the right direction regarding legibility, but 
it is strongly advised to move the column with frequency terms to the utmost right side of the table (SOC 
| Preferred Term | Frequency) as to exclude any chance of misinterpretation. 
Secondly,  though  the  Applicant  notes  that  the  table  does  contain  all  (potentially)  treatment  related 
adverse  events  noted  during  the  clinical  development  and  post-approval  studies,  it  is  not  clear  why 
between the SmPC version as presented at the last renewal and the currently proposed version certain 
events have been removed from the table, especially given that these events, such as menorrhagia in a 
LAL-CL02  subject,  are  still  present  in  the  ISS  data  listings  with  a  causality  assessment  of  ‘possibly 
related’.  Presumably  this  is  because  Preferred  Terms  that  were  reported  in  1  patient  only  in  the 
aggregated data set were not included for further review during ADR identification. The MAH is asked to 
clarify whether this interpretation is indeed correct. 
Finally, as requested in Q4, the following line should be added to the‘immunogenicity’ part 
of the selected adverse events: 
Among 125 patients with LAL Deficiency enrolled in the clinical studies, 19/125 (15.0%) patients 
tested positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) at some timepoint after starting treatment with 
sebelipase alfa (9 children and adult patients and 10 infants). For children and adult patients with LAL 
Deficiency, ADA positivity was transient with generally low titers of ADAs reported. Persistence of ADA 
positivity was observed for all 10 infants and persistence of high titer ADAs was observed for 3 of the 
10 infants. Among those 19 patients, 11 (58%) also showed the presence of inhibitory antibody 
activity (NAbs) at some postbaseline timepoint. 
Overall,  no  conclusion  on  the  relationship  between  development  of  ADA/NAbs  and  associated 
hypersensitivity  reactions  or  suboptimal  clinical  response  can  be  made.  In  clinical  studies,  3 patients 
homozygous for a deletion affecting both alleles of genes Lipase A, lysosomal acid [LIPA] and Cholesterol 
25-Hydroxylase  developed  inhibitory  antibody  activity  associated  with  a  suboptimal  clinical  response 
(see section 4.4).  These patients underwent either immunomodulatory therapy alone or in combination 
with hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or bone marrow transplant (BMT), resulting in improved 
clinical response to sebelipase alfa.

Question 20 
Regarding the modifications in the section 5.2, some updates are already proposed :  
a)  It should be clarified in the title of the table 5 that the parameters were simulated after 
multiple dose. 
b)  The table 5 is not in line with the table 8 of the PK/PD simulation report. As an example, 
the total number N for overall subjects is discrepant (N=72 vs N=4). 
c)  The conclusions on the linearity of sebelipase alpha PK and accumulation over time are 
drawn based on the non-compartmental analysis in study LAL-CL04 and in study LAL-
CL04 and LAL-CL06, respectively. But the number of patients in each category of age 
was  limited  and  should  be  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  In  addition,  the  lack  of  sign  of 
accumulation for the 3 mg/kg qow dosing is not reported in the SmPC. Instead, lack of 
accumulation at 3 mg/kg once weekly is mentioned. It should be clarified if the source 
of this information is the study LAL-CL01 while all the PK samples from this study were 
disqualified. The SmPC should be updated accordingly. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
a) EU SmPC Tables 4 and 5 that were proposed in the EU SmPC submitted in Dec 2019 (eCTD sequence 
0066) have been merged in the proposed EU SmPC, and numbers were updated with the current data 
as  presented  in  the  response  to  Question  20  b).  As  such,  the  title  of  now  Table  4  has  been  updated 
accordingly. However, Alexion has acknowledged EMA’s request and the title of the EU SmPC Table 4 
now  reads  “Mean  (SD)  Predicted  Pharmacokinetic  and  Exposure  Parameters  Following  Repeated 
Administrations of 1 mg/kg Sebelipase Alfa in Patients With LAL Deficiency by Age Group”. 
b) Alexion confirms that Table 5 in the EU SmPC submitted in Dec 2019 (eCTD sequence 0066) contained 
a typo, and that the correct number (N) of overall subjects was N = 72, as presented in Table 8 of the 
PK/PD simulation report. However, EU SmPC Table 4 was updated with the current data as presented 
below (source: Appendix Section 14.1), and therefore the correction of the number of overall subjects 
from N = 4 to N = 72 is no longer applicable: 
EU SmPC Table 4: Mean (SD) Predicted Pharmacokinetic and Exposure Parameters Following 
Repeated Administrations of 1 mg/kg Sebelipase Alfa in Patients With LAL Deficiency by Age 
Group 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 188/200 
 
 
  
  
 
c) The nonlinearity of sebelipase alfa is based on noncompartmental analysis (NCA) results in a limited 
number of adult patients with LAL-D (Module 2.7.2 Table 6). With only 3 patients receiving the 3 mg/kg 
dosing for this evaluation, the amount of data supporting this finding is limited. The conclusion of no 
accumulation following multiple dosing is based on both the NCA results from Study LAL-CL04 and the 
results from the Pop-PK modeling effort, where a mean terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 
hours  is  predicted.  No  accumulation  is  expected  considering  the  maintenance  dosing  is  administered 
once  every  1  to  2  weeks.  The  disqualification  of  the  Study  LAL-CL01  PK  data  does  not  impact  these 
conclusions. Therefore, Alexion proposes the following updates to the EU SmPC (presented in strikeout 
and bold underlined): 
Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Based on these data, the pharmacokinetics of sebelipase alfa appeared to be nonlinear with a greater 
than dose-proportional increase in exposure observed between the 1 and 3 mg/kg dose. No conclusion 
on the linearity of sebelipase alfa pharmacokinetics can be made due to limited data at higher 
exposures.  However,  no  accumulation  is  observed  at  1  mg/kg  (once  weekly  or  once  every 
other week) or 3 mg/kg once weekly, nor is it expected following less frequent dosing. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
a. Accepted. 
b.  The  updated  table  4  is  accepted.  However,  it  is  not  clear  why  only  75  patients  are  reported  to  be 
included in the POPPPK analysis in the section 5.2 while the mean predicted PK and exposure parameters 
for  102  patients  are  reported  in  table  4.(OC)  In  addition,  the  subsection  “children  and  adult”  and 
“infants” are now merged. These subtitles should be deleted from the section 5.2.(OC) Finally, there are 
discrepancies  between  the  numbers  of  patients  reported  in  the  different  age  subgroups  in  the  table 
provided in AtQ6 and numbers of patients reported in the table 4 provided in the SmPC. They should be 
clarified.(OC; see also question 20) 
c. The PK data supporting the statement on the lack of accumulation at 1mg/kg once weekly and 3mg/kg 
once weekly should be provided.(OC)  
Regarding  the  3mg/kg  qow  dosing,  overall  the  number  of  patients  were  limited  and  this  should  be 
reflected in the SmPC. In addition, it appears that the observations done for the drug accumulation at 
3mg/kg qow are based on a limited number of patients. This should be reflected in the SmPC.(OC) 
The other updates are accepted.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
In agreement with the scope of the recommendation, the elements for a public summary of the RMP 
will be updated with the explanation that “patients with dual WGD” indicate “patients who completely 
lack the ability to produce both enzymes” to reflect that not only one enzyme is affected by this 
extensive deletion. Updated EU-RMP version 4.1 is submitted in the present sequence.

PK 
1.  As part of the corrective actions taken to address data integrity issues detected in a Health Authority 
inspection carried out in 2016 at the CRO, the Applicant has explained that all samples impacted by 
these events were identified and reanalyzed when possible or the data were disqualified. Based on the 
information provided in the original dossier submitted for this variation, it was understood that at the 
time of data disqualification these samples were beyond the validated long-term storage stability for 
the  study  results  for  KANUMA  and  could  not  be  reanalysed.  These  samples  were,  therefore, 
unreportable. The Applicant should clarify if  PK samples collected in the KANUMA studies were included 
in the 86% of total number of samples reanalysed and reported as meeting the criteria recommended 
by EMA in the incurred sample reanalysis. 
2.  The MAH is requested to provide the  inspection report issued after the  inspection carried out in 2016 
at the CRO . It should be provided in order to see the initial findings and issues. In addition the MAH 
should  give  a  list  of  GCP/GCLP  inspections  performed  by  European  or  other  authorities  outside  EU 
during the same periods as the KANUMA studies periods in this CRO. The inspection results and the 
corresponding outcome should be discussed. 
3.  The Applicant is requested to provide the statistical comparison of the validation cut-point (healthy 
subjects) and the newly established cut points in the target population. The observed false positive 
error rate of the clinical study baseline samples, after excluding the samples with pre-existing ADA, 
using the validation cut point should also be taken into account in the discussion on the reliability of 
the validation cut point in the study population. 
4.  To avoid redundant statement, the detailed information on the ADA incidence should only be provided 
in the section 4.8 with a cross-reference to the section 4.8 in the section 5.2 : “As with all therapeutic 
proteins, there is the potential for the development of immunogenicity. Nineteen of 125 (15%) patients 
with  LAL  Deficiency  had  at  least  1◦postbaseline  antidrug  antibody  (ADA)  positive  result,  9  of  which 
were children and adult patients. For children and adult patients with LAL Deficiency, ADA positivity 
was transient with generally low titers of ADAs reported”. In addition, to give a full overview of all 
patient populations to the healthcare provider, the following statement on the ADA incidence in infants 
provided in the document 2.7.2 should be reported in the section 4.8: “On the other hand, persistence 
of ADA positivity was observed for all 10 infants and persistence of high titer ADAs was observed for 
3 of the 10 infants.” 
5.  The following issues should be addressed for the section 5.2 of the SmPC: 
a. 
it is not clear why only 75 patients are reported to be included in the POPPPK analysis 
while the mean predicted PK and exposure parameters for 102 patients are reported in 
the table 4.  
b.  The subsection “children and adult” and “infants” are now merged. These subtitles should 
be deleted from the section 5.2. 
c.  There are discrepancies between the numbers of patients reported in the different age 
subgroups  provided  in  AtQ6  (table  entitled  ‘distribution  of  PK  samples  by  age  group’) 
and the numbers of patients reported in the table 4 provided in the SmPC. They should 
be clarified. 
d.  The  PK  data  supporting  the  statement  on  the  lack  of  accumulation  at  1mg/kg  once 
weekly  and  3mg/kg  once  weekly  should  be  provided.  In  addition,  it  appears  that  the 
observations  done  for  the  drug  accumulation  at  3mg/kg  qow  are  based  on  a  limited 
number of patients. This should be reflected in the SmPC.

6.  The  term  ‘anaphylactic  reactions’  as  used  in  the  Hypersensitivity  reactions  including  anaphylactic 
reactions or anaphylaxis in section 4.4 is redundant in combination with the term ‘anaphylaxis’. Please 
update the start of the section as follows: 
Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions or anaphylaxis  
Hypersensitivity  reactions,  including  anaphylactic  reactions  or  anaphylaxis,  have  been 
reported in patients treated with sebelipase alfa; see section 4.8. 
7.  The readability of treatment durations/exposure times in sections 4.8 and 5.1 should be enhanced 
for better understanding without conversion effort, e.g. avoid the use of decimals other than ‘.5’  and 
provide a (rounded) more easily readable years – months – days representation of the durations. 
8.  The  MAH  is  requested  to  move  the  column  with  frequency  terms  to  the  utmost  right  side  of  the 
adverse event frequency table (SOC | Preferred Term | Frequency) in section 4.8 as to exclude any 
chance of misinterpretation whether the frequency refers to the SOC or the preferred terms. 
9.  ISS tables 14.3.1.23.2.1.2 and 14.3.1.23.1.1.1 are the basis for the SmPC’s ADR frequency tables, 
but certain individual data listings make reference of events that were considered possibly related to 
treatment but which were not included in the aforementioned tables (and in some cases have been 
actively  removed  from  the  SmPC  frequency  table  in  the  timeframe  between  the  last  renewal 
procedure and the current type II dossier). The Applicant is asked to confirm whether this is due to 
the fact that during the ADR identification in the aggregated safety data Preferred Terms were not 
included for further review if they were reported in 1 patient only.

supplementary information 
PK 
1.  As part of the corrective actions taken to address data integrity issues detected in a Health Authority 
inspection carried out in 2016 at the CRO, the Applicant has explained that all samples impacted by 
these events were identified and reanalyzed when possible or the data were disqualified. Based on 
the information provided in the original dossier submitted for this variation, it was understood that 
at  the  time  of  data  disqualification  these  samples  were  beyond  the  validated  long-term  storage 
stability  for  the  study  results  for  KANUMA  and  could  not  be  reanalysed.  These  samples  were, 
therefore, unreportable. The Applicant should clarify if  PK samples collected in the KANUMA studies 
were  included  in  the  86%  of  total  number  of  samples  reanalysed  and  reported  as  meeting  the 
criteria recommended by EMA in the incurred sample reanalysis. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
All  pharmacokinetic  data  reported  for  the  KANUMA  studies  were  from  analytical  runs  that  met  the 
acceptance criteria for the method, and that were free from the data integrity issue. This is also true for 
all  samples  included  in  the  evaluation  of  incurred  sample  reanalysis  (ISR).  In  the  instance  of  an  ISR 
result having originated from an analytical run disqualified due to the data integrity issue the sample 
was analyzed again, or if the sample was beyond long-term stability another sample was chosen for the

Summary of the MAH’s response 
As requested, the inspection report and CRO responses are provided .  
No  other  Health  Authority  inspections  were  conducted  during  the  same  time  periods  as  the  KANUMA 
studies. None of these studies inspected were sponsored by Alexion.

3.  The Applicant is requested to provide the statistical comparison of the validation cut-point (healthy 
subjects) and the newly established cut points in the target population. The observed false positive 
error rate of the clinical study baseline samples, after excluding the samples with pre-existing ADA, 
using the validation cut point should also be taken into account in the discussion on the reliability of 
the validation cut point in the study population. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Specific  population  based  cut-points  for  children  (<  18  years)  and  adults  (18  years+)  have  been 
determined using data from studies LAL-CL02, LAL-CL03, LAL-CL04, LAL-CL06, and LAL-CL08 and then 
compared to the validation cut-point as described in Study MEMO 8285711 (Annex 2). 
Each population was individually analyzed for outliers following which an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/637875/2020 
Page 193/200 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
was performed to test for a difference in mean response between the populations. This gave no evidence 
of a difference in mean response between the populations (p > 0.05). In addition, t-tests were performed 
to test for pairwise differences in mean response between the populations, with 95% confidence intervals 
constructed for each difference. These comparisons gave no evidence of a difference in mean response 
between any pair of populations (p > 0.05, with zero, ie, no difference, contained within each confidence 
interval). Data is presented in Figure 1 and Table 2. 
Figure 42 - Observed Population Responses for Validation, Adult and Pediatric Populations 
Table 72 - ANOVA Results of Validation, Adult and Pediatric Populations 
The  validation  cut-point  was  calculated  to  result  in  a  5%  false  positive  rate  for  treatment  naïve 
individuals. Table 3 presents the actual false positive rate for the baseline pretreatment samples from 
each study. Although multiple studies do not have enough baseline samples to accurately compute the 
false positive rate within the study, overall the false positive rate for all the studies is 4.2%, in agreement 
with the cut-point design.

Table 73 - Baseline Sample False Positive Rate 
Therefore, based on the absence of statistically significant differences between the patient populations 
and the validation cut-point data, along with in-study false positive rates performing as designed, the 
cut-point used in the KANUMA program for antidrug antibody (ADA) analysis is considered reliable and 
fit for its intended use. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MHA has provided a statistical comparison of the cut points calculated for the different populations 
and  the  actual  false  positive  rate  for  the  baseline  pre-treatment  samples.  The  cut  point  used  in  the 
KANUMA program for ADA analysis seems reasonable.  
Conclusion

(9  children  and  adult  patients  and  10  infants).  For  children  and  adult  patients  with  LAL 
Deficiency,  ADA  positivity  was  transient  with  generally  low  titers  of  ADAs  reported. 
Persistence  of  ADA  positivity  was  observed  for  all  10  infants  and  persistence  of  high  titer 
ADAs was observed for 3 of the 10 infants. Among those 19 patients, 11 (58%) also showed the 
presence of inhibitory antibody activity (NAbs) at some postbaseline timepoint.  
Overall,  no  conclusion  on  the  relationship  between  development  of  ADA/NAbs  and  associated 
hypersensitivity  reactions  or  suboptimal  clinical  response  can  be  made.  In  clinical  studies,  3  patients 
homozygous for a deletion affecting both alleles of genes Lipase A, lysosomal acid [LIPA] and Cholesterol 
25-Hydroxylase  developed  inhibitory  antibody  activity  associated  with  a  suboptimal  clinical  response 
(see section 4.4). These patients underwent either immunomodulatory therapy alone or in combination 
with haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or bone marrow transplant (BMT), resulting in improved 
clinical response to sebelipase alfa. 
Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Immunogenicity 
As  with  all  therapeutic  proteins,  there  is  the  potential  for  the  development  of  immunogenicity  (see 
section 4.8). Nineteen of 125 (15%) patients with LAL Deficiency had at least 1◦postbaseline antidrug 
antibody  (ADA)  positive  result,  9  of  which  were  children  and  adult  patients.  For  children  and  adult 
patients with LAL Deficiency, ADA positivity was transient with generally low titers of ADAs reported. No 
conclusion on the impact of immunogenicity on sebelipase alfa exposure can be made. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has updated the SmPC as requested. 
Conclusion 
Resolved  
5.  The following issues should be addressed for the section 5.2 of the SmPC: 
a. 
it is not clear why only 75 patients are reported to be included in the POPPPK analysis 
while the mean predicted PK and exposure parameters for 102 patients are reported in 
the table 4.  
b.  The subsection “children and adult” and “infants” are now merged. These subtitles should 
be deleted from the section 5.2. 
c.  There are discrepancies between the numbers of patients reported in the different age 
subgroups  provided  in  AtQ6  (table  entitled  ‘distribution  of  PK  samples  by  age  group’) 
and the numbers of patients reported in the table 4 provided in the SmPC. They should 
be clarified. 
d.  The  PK  data  supporting  the  statement  on  the  lack  of  accumulation  at  1mg/kg  once 
weekly  and  3mg/kg  once  weekly  should  be  provided.  In  addition,  it  appears  that  the 
observations  done  for  the  drug  accumulation  at  3mg/kg  qow  are  based  on  a  limited 
number of patients. This should be reflected in the SmPC.

a.) The original population pharmacokinetic (Pop-PK) analysis that was completed in support of the post-
marketing commitment included data from 75 patients from Studies LAL-CL02, LALCL03, LAL-CL04, and 
LAL-CL06. The subsequent model, per suggestion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human 
Use (CHMP) received in the list of Requests for Supplementary Information (RSI) adopted by the CHMP 
on 26 Mar 2020 (EMA/7910/2020), included 30 additional patients who were originally randomized to 
placebo but then subsequently received sebelipase alfa, leading to a total of 105 patients treated with 
sebelipase alfa overall. Following a Pop-PK sensitivity analysis exploring the effect of dose on clearance 
(CL) (2019 PK/PD Modeling and Simulation report, Section 6.2.3), it was determined that 3 adult patients 
weighing > 50 kg and receiving the high dose of 3 mg/kg sebelipase alfa (in Study LAL-CL04) should be 
removed from the Pop-PK final analysis to reduce the uncertainty in the estimated CL and central volume 
of distribution (Vc) parameters. Given this exclusion, the total patient count was reduced from 105 to 
102 in the SmPC Table 4. 
For clarification purpose, the EU SmPC has been updated as presented below. For ease of review, the 
added text is captured as bold underline, whereas the deleted text is captured as strikethrough. 
Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  sebelipase  alfa  in  children  and  adults  were  determined  using  a  population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of 75102 patients with LAL deficiency who received intravenous infusions of 
sebelipase alfa across 4 clinical studies LAL-CL02, LAL-CL03, LAL-CL04 and LAL-CL06 (Table 4). 
Predicted pharmacokinetic and exposure parameters of sebelipase alfa from clinical trials are presented 
by age group in Table 4. […] 
b.)  Alexion  acknowledges  the  Agency’s  comment  and  confirms  the  subtitle  “Children  and  adults”  has 
been deleted from Section 5.2. 
c.)  There  are  differences  in  both  the  total  and  subgroup  number  of  patients  between  the  2  tables 
(response to 26 Mar 2020 Request for Supplementary Information, Question [Q]6 and Table 4 of the 
SmPC). The difference in total number of patients (N) between the 2 tables (N = 102 in the SmPC vs N 
=  105  in  Q6)  results  from  exclusion  of  data  for  3  adult  patients  who  received  high  dose  of  3  mg/kg 
sebelipase alfa (see response to Q5a), while the data for these 3 patients were included in the summary 
of all available pharmacokinetic (PK) samples (response to Q6). The differences in number of patients 
between the assorted age subgroups are the result of different rules being applied. The age categories 
in the table presented in the response to Q6 were based on patient age at baseline, while values in the 
SmPC  Table  4  were  based  on  the  age  at  the  time  of  the  last  dose  (because  steady-state  exposure 
parameters are presented). This resulted in small differences in number of patients per age subgroup 
between the 2 tables.  
d.)  Limited  sebelipase  alfa  PK  data  following  once  weekly  dosing  is  available,  with  PK  sampling  not 
collected  following  consecutive  doses  to  provide  empiric  confirmation  of  no  accumulation.  However, 
based on the relatively fast clearance of sebelipase alfa (mean terminal elimination half-life ~ 3 hours), 
drug accumulation is not expected following once weekly dosing of sebelipase alfa. 
The EU SmPC Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties has been updated as presented below. For 
ease of review, the added text is captured as bold underline, whereas the deleted text is captured as 
strikethrough.

No conclusion on the linearity of sebelipase alfa pharmacokinetics can be made due to limited data at 
higher exposures. However, no accumulation is observed at 1 mg/kg (once weekly or once every other 
week) or 3 mg/kg once weekly, nor is it expected following less frequent dosing. No drug accumulation 
is  observed  following  1  mg/kg  or  3  mg/kg  once  every  other  week  dosing,  although 
observations for the drug accumulation at 3mg/kg every other week are based on a limited 
number  of  patients.  Accumulation  following  once  weekly  dosing  is  not  expected  based  on 
relatively rapid drug clearance. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
a) The MAH has clarified and updated the SmPC text with the total number of patients used to determine 
the PK parameters from the POPPK analysis.  
b) The MAH has deleted the subsection title requested.  
c) The MAH has clarified the discrepancies observed between the different data reported. This is related 
to the patient age considered (at baseline vs at the time of the last dose).  
d) The current knowledge is deemed better reflected in the SmPC with the proposed wording. 
Conclusion 
Resolved

6.  The  term  ‘anaphylactic  reactions’  as  used  in  the  Hypersensitivity  reactions  including  anaphylactic 
reactions or anaphylaxis in section 4.4 is redundant in combination with the term ‘anaphylaxis’. Please 
update the start of the section as follows: 
Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions or anaphylaxis  
Hypersensitivity  reactions,  including  anaphylactic  reactions  or  anaphylaxis,  have  been 
reported in patients treated with sebelipase alfa; see section 4.8. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Alexion agrees to the requested update and has edited the outlined text in Section 4.4 Special  
warnings and precautions for use accordingly.  
Conclusion 
Issue resolved.

7.  The readability of treatment durations/exposure times in sections 4.8 and 5.1 should be enhanced 
for better understanding without conversion effort, e.g. avoid the use of decimals other than ‘.5’  and 
provide a (rounded) more easily readable years – months – days representation of the durations. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Alexion acknowledges the Agency’s feedback and has updated Sections 4.8 Undesirable effects and 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties of the EU SmPC as recommended by the EMA.  
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Overall the MAH has now provided more rounded numbers as requested. 
Conclusion 
Issue Resolved. 
8.  The  MAH  is  requested  to  move  the  column  with  frequency  terms  to  the  utmost  right  side  of  the 
adverse event frequency table (SOC | Preferred Term | Frequency) in section 4.8 as to exclude any 
chance of misinterpretation whether the frequency refers to the SOC or the preferred terms. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Alexion agrees to the requested format change and has updated the adverse drug reaction (ADR) tables 
in Section 4.8 Undesirable effects accordingly.  
Conclusion 
Issue resolved 
9.  ISS tables 14.3.1.23.2.1.2 and 14.3.1.23.1.1.1 are the basis for the SmPC’s ADR frequency tables, 
but certain individual data listings make reference of events that were considered possibly related to 
treatment but which were not included in the aforementioned tables (and in some cases have been 
actively  removed  from  the  SmPC  frequency  table  in  the  timeframe  between  the  last  renewal 
procedure and the current type II dossier). The Applicant is asked to confirm whether this is due to 
the fact that during the ADR identification in the aggregated safety data Preferred Terms were not 
included for further review if they were reported in 1 patient only. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
A  review  of  all  the  aggregated  safety  data  was  conducted  for identification of  adverse  drug  reactions 
(ADRs) and the Applicant confirms that Preferred Terms that were only reported in 1 patient were not 
included in the ADR tables.  
During the identification of ADRs, the Applicant assessed relatedness at the Applicant-level based on the 
aggregate review of data, taking into account the population treated and underlying disease, rather than 
Assessment report

relying  solely  on  the  individual  patient  investigator  assessment  at  the  time  of  each  adverse  event. 
Following medical assessment, some terms were considered as not related to KANUMA and most likely 
related  to  underlying  disease,  comorbid  conditions  or  expected  within  the  treated  population 
demographic. The Investigator’s causality assessment, as included in the integrated summary of safety 
(ISS)  listings  displaying  related  (or  possibly  related)  terms,  was  considered  as  one  aspect  of  the 
Applicant’s  assessment  for  ADR  identification.  Therefore,  Preferred  Terms  reported  in  more  than  1 
patient  that  did  not  meet  the  definition  of  an  ADR  based  on  Sponsor’s  medical  judgement  were  not 
included or removed from the ADR tables.  
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The Applicant confirmed the underlying reasoning for the 1-patient cut-off rule.

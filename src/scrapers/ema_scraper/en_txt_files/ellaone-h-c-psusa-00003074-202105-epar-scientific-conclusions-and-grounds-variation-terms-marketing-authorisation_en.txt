Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ulipristal (female emergency 
contraceptive), the  scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, 
and in view of ulipristal  acetate 5 mg with  indication uterine fibroids having drug hypersensitivity listed 
with  frequency uncommon, the  PRAC considers a causal relationship between ulipristal acetate 30 mg at 
least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing 
ulipristal acetate 30 mg with  indication emergency contraceptives should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the marketing  authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the  scientific conclusions for ulipristal (female emergency contraceptive) the CHMP  is of 
the opinion that  the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s)  containing ulipristal (female 
emergency contraceptive) is unchanged subject to the  proposed changes to the product  information 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

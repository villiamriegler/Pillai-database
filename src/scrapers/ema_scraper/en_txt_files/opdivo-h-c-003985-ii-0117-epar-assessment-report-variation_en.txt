Extension of indication to include OPDIVO in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for 
neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with resectable Stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), based on results from study CA209816; a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial of nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab or nivolumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy versus platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy in early-stage NSCLC. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 27.0 of the RMP has also 
been submitted. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions 
P/0432/2020, P/0237/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0432/2020 was completed and the 
P/0237/2021 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The Applicant received Scientific Advice on the development of nivolumab for neoadjuvant treatment of 
patients with resectable stage IB-IIIA NSCLC from the CHMP on 30 January 2020 
(EMEA/H/SA/2253/11/2019/II). The Scientific Advice pertained to the following clinical aspects: 
•  Regarding a randomised, open-label phase 3 study: The characterisation of the patient 
population; the choice of comparator; the choice of PCR and EFS as dual primary endpoints; 
the statistical analysis plan. 
Questions were related to the suitability of study CA209816 to support a B/R assessment for

nivolumab in the currently claimed indication. CHMP noted that the study enrolment had finalized 
before the SA final letter was issued so the included recommendations could not be implemented on 
the clinical development. Multiple limitations of the study design were highlighted, such as the 
repeated protocol amendments resulting in a heterogeneous patient population, the fact that histology 
or backbone treatment were not included as stratification factors, the multiple chemotherapy options 
which were to be selected after randomization or the possibility to receive adjuvant treatment up to 
the investigator’s decision, as reflected in the protocol. CHMP supported the choice of EFS as primary 
endpoint, which should be associated with a non-detrimental effect on OS, but not the use of pCR as 
primary endpoint as no correlation with OS/EFS has been established. Also, the timing and excessive 
number of interim analyses (IA) were questioned.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The MAH initially applied for the following indication: 
OPDIVO in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the neoadjuvant treatment 
of resectable Stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer in adults (see section 5.1). 
During the procedure the indication was amended. The agreed indication is as follows: 
OPDIVO in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the neoadjuvant treatment 
of resectable non-small cell lung cancer at high risk of recurrence in adult patients whose tumours 
have PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% (see section 5.1 for selection criteria). 
Proposed Dosage and Administration 
The recommended dose is 360 mg nivolumab administered intravenously over 30 minutes in 
combination with platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide (1.8 million, or 18% of all cancer 
deaths in 2020), with 2.2 million newly diagnosed cases, or 11.4% of all cancers diagnosed, in 2020. 
In Europe, 477,534 new lung cancer cases and 384,176 deaths due to lung cancer were estimated to 
occur in the same year (Globocan 2020). 
About 87% of lung cancer cases are NSCLC. At initial diagnosis, 26% of patients present with stage I 
disease, 8.3% with stage II, 27.6% with stage III, and 38.1% with stage IV disease. Enhanced 
screening techniques and improved diagnosing methods based on imaging have led to more subjects 
identified with early-stage disease and the number of patients diagnosed during the non-metastatic 
stages is expected to increase over time. Long-term outcomes for patients with non-metastatic NSCLC 
remain poor with 5-year survival rates ranging from 82% for patients with clinical stage IA to 19% for 
patients with clinical stage IIIB. 
The primary risk factor for lung cancer is smoking tobacco, which accounts for most lung cancer-
related deaths. The risk for lung cancer increases with the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per 
day and with the number of years spent smoking. Exposed non-smokers also have an increased 
relative risk of developing lung cancer (NCCN Guidelines v. 3.2022). Other possible risk factors for lung 
cancer include disease history (i.e., COPD), cancer history, family history of lung cancer, and exposure 
to other carcinogens. Asbestos is a known carcinogen that increases the risk for lung cancer in people 
exposed, especially in individuals who smoke.

Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Whenever feasible, patients with early-stage NSCLC are treated surgically with curative intent. 
Approximately 20–25% of the patients are candidates for surgical resection (Datta et al. 2003). 
However, many patients are at risk of lung cancer recurrence even after complete resection. The 5-
year survival rate in resected NSCLC patients has been reported to be over 70% in stage I patients to 
only 25% in stage IIIA patients (Goldstraw et al. 2016). A high proportion of patients with resected 
NSCLC die of recurrent NSCLC, suggesting that a good proportion of these patients have 
micrometastatic disease at the time of surgical resection (Uramoto et al. 2014). 
Management 
Treatment options for patients with newly-diagnosed non-metastatic NSCLC depend on tumour 
resectability and patient operability. Key considerations include tumour characteristics and location, 
extent of nodal involvement, lung function, patient age and comorbidities. Curative resection is 
intended for 20% to 25% of patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC. Thoracotomy is the open approach 
used for lung resection while minimally invasive approaches such as video-assisted thoracoscopy or 
robotic-assisted thoracoscopy are increasingly considered in order to limit post-operative pain and 
complications (Lim et al. 2021). A complete resection without residual disease (R0) is desired in order 
to maximize survival. Rates of complete resection range from 70% to 90% in most historical trials 
(Pisters et al. 2010). 
NCCN guidelines recommend that patients with stage IB (T2a, N0) to IIIA (T1-2, N2; T3, N1) disease 
(per the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control 
[AJCC/UICC] staging criteria) who had complete resection should receive adjuvant chemotherapy. In 
the case of N2 disease confirmed by mediastinal biopsy, a preferred treatment would be definitive 
concurrent chemoradiation followed by consolidation with durvalumab, but patients may also receive 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiation followed by surgery in some cases. ESMO 
guidelines also support adjuvant chemotherapy to be offered for patients with resectable stage III 
disease. If single-station N2 disease can be demonstrated by preoperative pathological nodal analysis, 
induction chemo followed by surgery or induction chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery are also 
options. Preferred treatment for multi-station N2 includes definitive chemoradiation. A two-drug 
combination regimen with cisplatin is preferable in the adjuvant setting following these guidelines. 
Local treatment recommendations usually include neoadjuvant chemotherapy for stage IIIA N2 disease 
potentially resectable as a treatment option according to a multidisciplinary committee (ESMO 2015, 
NCCN 2023). 
There is enough clinical evidence to support the use of platinum doublets for stage IB-III completely 
resected tumours. A meta-analysis of surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy versus surgery 
alone in resected NSCLC based on 34 trial comparisons demonstrated a hazard ratio for overall 
survival (OS) of 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81, 0.92, p < 0.0001), with an absolute 
increase in survival of 4% at 5 years, from 60% to 64%. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) data were 
available for 18 trial comparisons and also favoured adjuvant chemotherapy with a HR of 0.83 (95% 
CI: 0.77, 0.90, p<0.0001) (Arriaga et al. 2010). Recent trials have shown a postsurgery disease-free 
survival benefit with adjuvant targeted therapy and immunotherapy, e.g. IMpower 010 study with 
atezolizumab. 
For the neoadjuvant strategy, evidence is less clear, especially for stage IB-II and stage IIIA tumours 
considered resectable at diagnosis. Analyses of 15 randomized controlled trials showed a significant 
benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on OS with an HR of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.96, p = 0.007), 
showing an absolute survival improvement of 5% at 5 years vs surgery alone, from 40% to 45%. RFS 
Assessment report

Page 11/149 
 
 
 
results also significantly favoured neoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.94, p = 
0.002) (Lim et al. 2009). Unfortunately, there is little evidence comparing both strategies in cases 
where both could be an option. An indirect-comparison meta-analysis of 32 randomized trials showed 
that the relative HRs for OS and disease-free survival (DFS) with adjuvant chemotherapy compared 
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy were 0.99 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.21; p = 0.91) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.77, 
1.20; p = 0.70), respectively (Arriaga et al. 2010). Furthermore, the Spanish Lung Cancer group 
conducted a trial comparing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy to surgery alone and 5-year DFS 
and OS were similar between the three arms (Felip et al. 2010). Currently, there are several phase 3 
studies where immune checkpoint inhibitors are being administered as neoadjuvant therapy (± 
adjuvant). 
Regarding the chemotherapy combination, there is no clear evidence of a difference in the effect on OS 
by chemotherapy regimen or scheduling, number of drugs, or platinum agent used (NSCLC Meta-
analysis collaborator group, 2014). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
OPDIVO (nivolumab) is a programmed death receptor-1 blocking antibody which binds to the 
programmed death 1 (PD 1) receptor and blocks its interaction with PD L1 and PD L2. The PD 1 
receptor is a negative regulator of T cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T 
cell immune responses. Engagement of PD 1 with the ligands PD L1 and PD L2, which are expressed in 
antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment, results in inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Nivolumab 
potentiates T cell responses, including anti tumour responses, through blockade of PD 1 binding to PD 
L1 and PD L2 ligands.. Nivolumab as a single agent has been approved in the European Union (EU), 
United States (US), and several other countries for the treatment of patients with melanoma, NSCLC, 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC), classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck (SCCHN), urothelial carcinoma (UC), and oesophageal cancers.  
Nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy has been approved in the EU, US, and several other 
countries for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma, intermediate/poor-
risk advanced RCC, unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma, and microsatellite instability-high 
(MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). 
Nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy has been 
approved for first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC. 
Nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib has been approved for the treatment of advanced RCC. 
Nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy has been approved for gastric cancer, gastroesophageal 
junction cancer, and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The nivolumab non-metastatic NSCLC development program includes four phase 3 studies, which 
investigate the potential role of nivolumab (± ipilimumab, chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy) as 
neoadjuvant, adjuvant, peri-operative, or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) add-on treatment 
options for patients with unmet medical needs across several clinical settings and as part of various 
multi-modality based regimens (see table below).

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
BMS-936558 (nivolumab) is a protein composed of natural amino acids. Proteins are expected to 
biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant risk. As a protein, nivolumab is exempt from 
preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment under the 1 June 2006 “Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/S/4447/00). 
Nivolumab and the product excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Of note, the MAH during a routine inspection readiness activity for the CA209816 study conducted in 
June 2022, observed deficiencies in their monitoring process at one investigative site in China (Tianjin 
Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Site 0163, 27 randomized patients). Multiple potential 
adverse events (AEs, all non-serious) and concomitant medications documented in medical notes 
across all study arms were not entered into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. Following 
complete source data review, sites entered the missing data into the EDC and preliminary assessment 
of the newly entered safety information was performed in July 2022. Due to this GCP finding, the MAH 
expanded the investigation to all 15 sites in China participating in the study and performed full on-site 
review of all available source records. Upon complete source review, a second site (Beijing Cancer 
Hospital, Site 0161, 13 randomized patients) had similar findings with potentially missed AEs (all non-
serious AEs). The potential root cause of the issues at Sites 0163 and 0161 appeared to be related to 
deficiency in the MAH monitoring at those two trial sites (see section 2.5.1).

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
A previously developed population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model of nivolumab was updated by 
retaining the Phase 1 dose-ranging studies, and select studies in NSCLC tumour type, and by adding 
data from the first-line (1L) NSCLC study containing nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab + 
chemotherapy arms (Study CA209227). Additionally, data from nivolumab monotherapy studies 
conducted with Chinese or Japanese subjects in NSCLC or other solid tumours, and data in early-stage 
NSCLC subjects (Study CA209816) were included.

The nivolumab PPK analysis includes all subjects from the studies listed in Table 1 who were treated 
with nivolumab monotherapy and/or in combination with chemotherapy for whom nivolumab serum 
concentration data were available. Subjects for whom no serum concentrations were available or those 
who had PK samples that could not be associated with clinical data were excluded from the analysis. 
A summary of the subjects included in the nivolumab PPK analysis dataset is provided in Table 2.

Model Development 
This analysis was primarily to re-estimate the parameters and variability using full models, and to assess 
the PPK of nivolumab when coadministered with chemotherapy in early-stage NSCLC subjects. 
Base model 
Base  model  development  consisted  of  re-estimating  parameters  of  a  previously  developed  full  model 
(tumour  type,  ipilimumab  dosing  regimens,  ipilimumab  coadministration,  and  ipilimumab  + 
chemotherapy coadministration were removed) with the current analysis dataset. 
The base model was a 2-compartment, zero-order IV infusion PK model, with time-varying CL (sigmoidal-
Emax  function);  and  a  proportional  residual  error  model,  with  random  effects  on  CL,  Q,  VC,  VP,  and 
EMAX; and correlation of random effect between CL and VC. The variance of random effect was estimated 
jointly for the two CL parameters (CL, Q) and for the two volume parameters (VC, VP). The base model 
contained BBWT, sex, race, GFR, PS, and chemotherapy coadministration on CL; BBWT and sex on VC; 
BBWT on Q; BBWT on VP; and PS on EMAX.

Table 5: Parameter Estimates of the Base Nivolumab Population Pharmacokinetic Model 
Full model 
The full model was developed from the base model by incorporating additional covariates representing 
the effect of tumour type + line of therapy (NADJ NSCLC, 1L NSCLC, and Others [OTHER] versus 2L+ 
NSCLC) and baseline albumin on nivolumab CL, and chemotherapy combination effect on EMAX. 
The full model was as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 23/149 
 
 
 
 
 
where CL0REF is the typical value of CL at time 0 (CL0) at the reference values of BBWT, PS, and eGFR, 
SEX is referenced to male, and race is referenced to white. VCREF, QREF, and VPREF are typical values 
of VC, Q, and VP at the reference values of BBWT, respectively. CLBBWT, CLeGFR, CLFEMALE, CLPS, 
CL1L NSCLC, CLNADJ NSCLC, CLOTHER, CLBALB, CLCHEMO, CLRAAA, CLRAAS, EMAXPS, EMAXCHEMO, 
VCBBWT,  and  VCFEMALE  are  model  parameters.  CHEMO  indicates  nivolumab  combined  with 
chemotherapy,  RAAA  indicates  race  (African  American),  and  RAAS  indicates  race  (Asian).  EMAXREF 
represents the reference value of the maximal change in CL. The T50 parameter represent the time at 
which the change in CLt,i is 50% of EMAX and HILL represents the sigmoidicity of the relationship with 
time. 
ηCLi,  ηQi,  ηVCi,  ηVPi,  and  ηEMAXi  are  normally  distributed  random  variables.  IFEMALE,  IPS,  IRAAA, 
IRAAS and ICHEMO are the categorical covariate indicator 
Parameter  estimates  for  this  model  are  presented  in  Table  6,  and  the  covariate  effects  are  shown  in

Model Evaluation 
The  predictive  performance  of  the  full  PPK  model  was  determined  using  pcVPC  with  stratification  by 
tumor type and line of therapy (NADJ NSCLC, 1L NSCLC, 2L+ NSCLC, and Others).

Dose selection 
A flat dose of nivolumab 360 mg in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy was selected for 
evaluation  in  the  pivotal  Phase  3  study,  CA209816.  Previously  conducted  PPK  analysis  predicted 
nivolumab exposures following the originally approved dose of 3mg/kg Q2W and flat doses of 240 mg 
Q2W and 480 mg Q4W in subjects with different tumour types that included NSCLC, and the resultant 
exposures  were  similar.  The  Sponsor  also  conducted  simulations  of  360  mg  Q3W  and  3  mg/kg  Q2W 
using the same nivolumab monotherapy PPK model (Table 12). 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 35/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 12: Summary of Simulated Exposure Measures Following Nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and 360 mg 
Q3W 
The  analyses  indicated  that  the  Cavgss  following  nivolumab  360  mg  Q3W  would  be  similar  to  that 
following 3 mg/kg Q2W, while Cminss is predicted to be approximately 6% lower. Following nivolumab 
360 mg Q3W, Cmaxss is predicted to be approximately23% higher relative to that following nivolumab 
3 mg/kg Q2W. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was not evaluated in pivotal Study CA209816 because the nivolumab anti-drug antibody 
(ADA) incidence rate with nivo+chemo is expected to be low and similar to nivolumab monotherapy with 
up  to  2  years  of  treatment  in  1L  NSCLC  (i.e.  overall  ADA  positive  subjects  < 20%  and  subjects  with 
neutralizing antibodies < 5%). 
In addition, due to the limited nivolumab dosing (up to 3 cycles of 360 mg nivolumab administered Q3W) 
for  neoadjuvant  treatment  of  resectable  NSCLC  in  Study  CA209816,  the  duration  of  any  treatment-
emergent ADA positivity would likely be transient.

3 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy versus 3 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy for early-
stage NSCLC. 
Exposure-Response Efficacy: pCR 
The following variables were included in the E-R of pCR analysis dataset: 
-Exposure variable: nivolumab Cavg1, obtained from PPK analyses 
-Response variable: pCR based on BIPR assessment 
-Baseline demographic variables: age, body weight, sex 
-Baseline disease characteristics: PS, tumor size, disease stage (IB, and II vs IIIA, or IB, IIA, and IIB vs 
IIIA) at initial diagnosis, histology (SQ vs NSQ), smoking status, PD-L1 expression (≥ 1% vs <1%) 
-Baseline laboratory values: LDH and serum albumin 
-Other: nivolumab (nivo+chemo vs chemo) 
The  relationship  between  nivolumab  exposure  (Cavg1)  and  the  probability  of  subject  i  achieving  pCR 
was described by a logistic regression model and included assessments of the modulatory effect of 
covariates on the E-R relationship.

The following variables were included in the E-R of EFS analysis dataset: 
•  Exposure variable: nivolumab Cavg1, obtained from PPK analyses 
•  Response  variable:  EFS  based  on  BICR  assessment;  EFS  was  defined  as  the  length  of  time  from 
randomization to any one of the following events: a) any progression of disease precluding surgery, 
b) progression or recurrence of disease (based on BICR assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria 
In Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) after surgery, or c) death due to any cause. 
•  Baseline demographic variables: age, body weight, sex 
•  Baseline disease characteristics: PS, tumour size, disease stage (IB, and II vs IIIA, or IB, IIA, and 
IIB, vs IIIA) at initial diagnosis, histology (SQ vs. NSQ), smoking status, PD-L1 expression (≥ 1% 
vs. < 1%) 
•  Baseline laboratory values: LDH and serum albumin 
•  Other: nivolumab (nivo+chemo vs chemo) 
The relationship between nivolumab exposure (Cavg1) and EFS was described by a Cox Proportional 
Hazards (CPH) model and included assessments of the potential modulatory effect of covariates on

The predictor variables with a significant effect on EFS were nivolumab Cavg1, disease stage, smoking 
status, PD-L1 status, sex, and baseline albumin (95% CI of effect did not include the null value). 
Exposure-safety relationship 
The E-R safety analysis was performed with data from 2145 early-stage (stage IIIA or better) and late 
stage  (stage  IV)  NSCLC  subjects  from  studies  CA209816  and  CA209227,  respectively,  who  received 
nivolumab  240  mg  Q2W  monotherapy  in  CA209227,  or  nivolumab  360  mg  Q3W  +  3  cycles  of 
chemotherapy in CA209816, or nivolumab 360 mg Q3W + 4 cycles of chemotherapy in CA209227, or 
chemotherapy alone (3 cycles in CA209816 and 4 cycles in CA209227). 
The following variables were included in the E-R safety analysis data set: 
-Exposure variable: nivolumab Cavg1, obtained from PPK analyses 
-Response variable: Gr2+ IMAEs 
-Baseline demographic variables: age, body weight, sex 
-Baseline  disease characteristics: PS, tumour size, disease stage at initial diagnosis, histology (SQ vs 
NSQ), smoking status, PD-L1 expression (≥ 1% vs < 1%) 
-Baseline laboratory values: LDH and serum albumin 
-Others: treatment (nivo+chemo, nivo vs. chemo) 
The relationship between nivolumab exposure (Cavg1) and time to first occurrence of Gr2+ IMAEs was 
described  by  a  semi-parametric  CPH  model  and  included  assessments  of  the  modulatory  effect  of 
covariates on the E-R relationship.

Overall, it shows an increased hazard in nivolumab + chemotherapy combination regimen compared to 
chemotherapy, as a result of the nivolumab treatment effect. The estimated HR ranged between 10 and 
11.7 at the 5th and 95th percentiles of nivolumab Cavg1 from nivolumab + chemotherapy combination 
regimen compared with chemotherapy, which indicates that while the risk of Gr2+ IMAEs is higher for 
subjects who receive nivo+chemo relative to chemo alone, the E-R relationship is relatively flat over the 
range of exposures produced by nivolumab 360 mg Q3W.

2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The population PK analysis was based on a pooled dataset from 8 Studies, which includes data of 
nivolumab as monotherapy from Phase 1 dose-ranging studies (AA209003 and CA209005 studies) in 
NSCLC and other cancers, from a Phase 1 /2 study (CA209077) in Chinese subjects with multiple solid 
tumour types and from Phase 3 trials (CA209017, CA209057 and CA209078 studies) in squamous 
NSCLC, non squamous NSCLC and advanced or metastatic NSCLC respectively, and data of nivolumab 
as monotherapy and/or in combination with chemotherapy from Phase 3 trials (CA209227 and 
CA209816 studies) in chemotherapy-naïve stage IV or recurrent NSCLC and resectable NSCLC. 
PK samples of nivolumab below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) were low (1,3%) and were 
excluded from the analysis. M1 method for handling BLQ-data is considered acceptable. 
The population PK model development of nivolumab includes the re-use of the full nivolumab PPK 
model previously established as the new base model, with all the significant covariates previously 
identified excluding the effect of tumour type, ipilimumab dosing regimens and coadministration of 
ipilimumab and coadministration of ipilimumab+chemotherapy. Subsequently, a full model was 
developed by incorporating covariates to assess the impact of tumour type and line of therapy and 
baseline albumin on nivolumab CL, and chemotherapy combination effect on EMAX. Moderate 
(CV<35%) inter-individual variability has been characterized on several PK parameters (CL, VC and 
Emax). The updated full popPK model includes only the 12 covariate effects that were statistically 
significant. According to the pcVPC provided related to the NADJ NSCLC indication, first days after the 
previous dose are not properly characterised and there is a slight over-prediction of concentrations for 
the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles. However, the overall model performance seems adequate to describe 
most of the experimental evidence.  
Immunogenicity was not evaluated in the current study (CA209816), but no clinically relevant 
immunogenicity effect of nivolumab has been found in previous studies despite the fact that according 
to the current dosing regimen, higher PK levels (>20%) of nivolumab are predicted in NADJ patients 
compared to 1L and 2L+ NSCLC patients. 
A forest plot has been provided to assess the clinical relevance of the covariates selected based on the 
change on the main PK parameters (CL, VC and Emax) rather than PK exposure metrics (i.e. AUC, 
Cmax, Cmin), showing that baseline ALB levels equal or lower than 3.1 lead to changes on CL >20%. 
Although it is not fully clear how changes greater than 20% on CL may be translated into the PK 
exposure metrics, this change is considered of minor relevance based on the flat and non-significant 
exposure-response relationship identified so far in patients receiving the combination therapy.  
In order to compare the use of the flat dose of 360 mg of nivolumab Q3W with the weight base dosage 
(3 mg/kg Q2W), the Sponsor conducted simulations of both dosages using the nivolumab monotherapy 
PPK model. The analyses indicated that Cmaxss1, Cmaxss and Cavg 1 for the flat dose are predicted to 
be 57%, 23% and 35% higher relative to the weight base dose. Switching from bodyweight-based 
dosing to flat dosing results in significant differences in exposure parameters, leading to Cavg1 and 
Cmax1 following 360 mg Q3W 51,4% and 72.3% higher, respectively. Based on the updated 
exposure-safety analysis, the impact of Cavg or Cmax levels of nivolumab to explain the probability of 
Gr2+ IMAE is of minor relevance, and additional covariates may have stronger statistical relationship 
(disease status or PD-L1 expression). The exposure-efficacy analysis was based on patients from study 
CA209816 with early-stage NSCLC treated with 3 cycles of the combination treatment versus 3 cycles 
of chemotherapy. Nivolumab Cavg1 derived from the PPK analysis was used as the measure of 
exposure. 
An exposure-efficacy relationship has been established to characterize the probability of pCR by a 
logistic regression model. The forest plot analysis of the Odds Ratio among the different covariates 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 44/149 
 
 
 
suggests that the probability of response was significantly higher in subjects receiving the combination 
therapy compared to patients who received only the chemotherapy. A proportional hazard model to 
account for the exposure–efficacy of nivolumab on EFS was also performed. EFS was longer in subjects 
receiving the combination therapy relative to chemotherapy alone. 
The exposure-response safety analysis was performed with data from 2145 early-stage (stage IIIA or 
better) and late stage (stage IV) NSCLC subjects from studies CA209816 and CA209227. Nivolumab 
Cavg1 derived from the PPK analysis was used as the measure of exposure. The exposure-safety 
analysis characterized the probability of Gr2+ imAE in patients who received nivolumab 240 mg Q2W 
monotherapy or nivolumab 360 mg Q3W + chemotherapy. Nivolumab exposure was associated with 
Grade2+ imAE. The HR for nivolumab Cavg1 compared to chemotherapy was relatively high. The HR 
for the combination was similar to the monotherapy treatment. 
2.3.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology properties of nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy for neoadjuvant 
treatment of resectable NSCLC has been characterized using information from the pivotal Phase 3 
study CA209816. The characterization of the data is adequate and the rationale for the dose schedule 
appropriate.

on 01-Jan-2018, and sites were instructed to continue using the 7th edition when entering data for the 
trial. There are some differences between the 7th and 8th editions, mainly related to the T (primary 
tumor) categories. In CA209816, subjects enrolled with stage IB (≥4cm)–IIIA NSCLC using TNM 7th 
edition would cover stages IB-IIIB using TNM 8th edition.

Treatments 
The treatments administered to subjects concurrently randomized to the nivo+chemo (Arm C) and 
chemo (Arm B) arms (the primary efficacy analysis population discussed in this report) are 
summarized below. Selection of a chemotherapy regimen was based on histology and investigator’s 
choice, and was performed after each subject had been randomized. 
Nivo+Chemo Arm (Arm C) 
•  Nivolumab 360 mg IV Q3W for up to 3 cycles 
•  Chemotherapy: investigator choice of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy IV 
o  Cisplatin (75 mg/m2 on Day 1 of a 3 week cycle for up to 3 cycles) and one of the 
following: 
  Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 or 1250 mg/m2 [per local prescribing information] 
on Days 1 and 8 of a 3 week cycle for up to 3 cycles) (squamous histology) 
 
Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of a 3-week cycle for up to 3 cycles) (non-
squamous histology) 
o  Carboplatin (AUC 5-6 on Day 1 of a 3-week cycle for up to 3 cycles) and the following: 
 
Paclitaxel (175 or 200 mg/m2 on Day 1 of a 3 week cycle for up to 3 cycles) 
(any histology) 
Chemo Arm (Arm B) 
Investigator choice of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy IV: 
•  Cisplatin (75 mg/m2 on Day 1 of a 3 week cycle for up to 3 cycles) and one of the following: 
o  Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 or 1250 mg/m2 [per local prescribing information] on Days 
1 and 8 of a 3-week cycle for up to 3 cycles) (squamous histology) 
o  Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of a 3-week cycle for up to 3 cycles) (non-
squamous histology) 
o  Vinorelbine (25 mg/m2 or 30 mg/m2 [per local prescribing information] on Days 1 and 
8 of a 3-week cycle for up to 3 cycles) 
o  Docetaxel (60 mg/m2 or 75 mg/m2 [per local prescribing information] on Day 1 of a 3 
week cycle for up to 3 cycles) 
•  Carboplatin (AUC 5-6 on Day 1 of a 3-week cycle for up to 3 cycles) and the following: 
o  Paclitaxel (175 or 200 mg/m2 on Day 1 of a 3 week cycle for up to 3 cycles) 
For subjects unable to tolerate cisplatin, the reasons were documented. If the investigator desired to 
use a carboplatin containing regimen, the investigator was to obtain approval from the Medical Monitor 
prior to utilization, except for opting for carboplatin plus paclitaxel. 
Two of the chemotherapy options, which were allowed for Arm B (cisplatin+docetaxel and 
cisplatin+vinorelbine) were not allowed for Arm C. This was because, at the time Arm C was added to 
the protocol, safety data were not available for nivolumab in combination with those chemotherapy 
backbones. The remaining chemotherapy options were the same for Arms B and C. 
Where multiple doses are noted for docetaxel, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine, the investigator was to 
use the locally approved/recommended dose, due to regional differences, mostly in Asia.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints 
•  EFS (by BICR): for the primary analyses, EFS was defined as the length of time from 
randomization to any of the following events: a) any progression of disease precluding surgery, 
b) progression or recurrence of disease (based on BICR assessment per RECIST 1.1) after 
surgery, or c) death due to any cause. Subjects who did not undergo surgery for reasons other 
than progression were considered to have an event at RECIST 1.1 (based on BICR) progression 
or death. The primary definition accounts for subsequent therapy by censoring at the last 
evaluable tumour assessment on or prior to the date of subsequent therapy (outside of the 
protocol specified adjuvant therapy). The secondary definition (EFS2) does not incorporate 
censoring due to subsequent therapy. 
•  pCR (by BIPR): in the primary analysis, the pCR rate was defined as the number of 
randomized subjects with an absence of residual tumor in lung resected tissue and lymph 
nodes as evaluated by BIPR, divided by the number of randomized subjects for each treatment 
arm. Randomized subjects who were no longer eligible for surgery, who received alternative 
anticancer therapy before surgery, who discontinued the study (eg, withdraw consent) before 
surgery, or who otherwise did not have an evaluable BIPR result available were all counted as 
non-responders. 
Secondary endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 49/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  OS: was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death due to 
any cause. OS was censored on the last date a subject was known to be alive. 
•  Time to Death or Distant Metastasis (TDDM): was defined as the time between the date of 
randomization and the first date of distant metastasis or the date of death in the absence of 
distant metastasis. A distant metastasis was defined as any new lesion outside of the thorax 
using BICR and RECIST 1.1 criteria. Subjects who had not developed distant metastasis or died 
at the time of the analysis were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumour 
assessment. 
•  Major Pathologic Response (MPR) (by BIPR): was defined as the number of randomized 
subjects with ≤10% residual tumour in lung and lymph nodes (per BIPR), divided by the 
number of randomized subjects for each treatment arm. Viable tumours in situ carcinoma were 
not included in the MPR calculation. 
Exploratory endpoint 
•  EFS on next line therapy (EFS2): was defined as the time from randomization to objectively 
documented progression, per investigator assessment, after the next line of therapy or to 
death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Subjects without documented progression on 
the next line who started a second next line of subsequent therapy were considered to have an 
event at the start of second next line of therapy. Subjects who were alive and without 
progression after the next line of therapy were censored at last known alive date. 
Tumour assessments were performed at baseline, within 14 days of surgery, every 12 weeks after 
surgery for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, and every year for 5 years until disease 
recurrence or progression. 
Sample size 
The original study design (before Revised protocol 02) had two arms, with participants randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to either neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab or platinum doublet chemotherapy arm. 
Revised protocol 02 added a new, neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum doublet chemotherapy arm. 
When the third arm opens and as each site receives IRB/EC approval of revised protocol 02, the IRT 
will switch to a 1:1:1 randomization at the respective site. Starting from that point on, the site will 
only enrol under revised protocol 02. 
Revised protocol 03 withholds randomization into the arm of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab 
but continues randomizing eligible participants into either neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum 
doublet chemotherapy arm or platinum doublet chemotherapy arm in a 1:1 ratio. 
Approximately 350 participants (175 participants per arm) will be randomized between 2 arms 
neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum doublet chemotherapy or platinum doublet chemotherapy from 
1:1:1 randomization in revised protocol 02 and 1:1 randomization in revised protocol 03. 
Participants already randomized in the original 2-arm part (neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy) and in the arm of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab in 3-arm part 
defined by revised protocol 02 will remain in trial and continue scheduled trial procedures. It is 
expected to have around 70 participants randomized in the original 2-arm part and approximately 
other 75 participants randomized in the arm of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the 3-arm 
part. It is estimated that there will be a total of approximately 500 participants on the study. 
The sample size of the study is calculated based on the primary endpoint of EFS and accounts for the 
multiple primary endpoints comparisons: pCR (per BIPR) and EFS (per BICR) with an initial alpha 
Assessment report

allocation of 0.01 and 0.04 respectively. Formal analyses of pCR and EFS may be conducted at 
different timepoints. The fallback method will be used, i.e. if the pCR comparison between Arm C and 
Arm B is statistically significant, then 0.01 alpha allocated to pCR will be passed to the EFS comparison 
for Arm C vs Arm B and the EFS comparison will be conducted at the alpha = 0.05 level. If the pCR 
comparison between Arm C and Arm B is not statistically significant, then the EFS comparison for Arm 
C vs Arm B will be conducted at the alpha = 0.04 level. If EFS is significant, the secondary endpoint 
OS will be tested hierarchically, at the same overall alpha level as EFS, using a separate O’Brien 
Fleming alpha spending function for OS. 
Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) 
Assuming an accrual rate of 10 participants (all comers) a month between Arms B and C during 1:1:1 
randomization (about 10 months), and 15 participants per month during 1:1 randomization, it is 
anticipated that the 350 participants will be randomized in approximately 27 months. The pCR 
endpoint is expected to be analyzed after about 30 months from start of 1:1:1 randomization. 
Assuming pCR rate of 10% on Arm B chemotherapy and 30% on Arm C nivolumab plus chemotherapy, 
respectively, the 350 participants will provide more than 90% power to detect an odds ratio of 3.857 
with a 2-sided type I error of 1%. 
It is estimated that there will be about 110 subjects randomized to Arm A neoadjuvant nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab before revised protocol 03 is implemented. Assuming true pCR rate is 15% on this arm, 
there is 95% probability that the lower bound of 95% exact confidence interval of pCR is above 5%. 
Event Free Survival (EFS) 
A total of 185 events ensure that an overall 2-sided 5% significance level sequential test procedure 
with two interim analyses after 148 events (80% of events required for final analysis) and 167 events 
(90% of events required for final analysis) in 358 randomized participants will have 82% power 
assuming an HR of 0.65 between the 2 Arms. Considering a piecewise exponential distribution with 
control hazard rates of 0.028 before 20 months, 0.017 between 20 months and 40 months, 0.014 
between 40 and 60 months and 0.008 after 60 months, and a dropout rate of approximately 20%, it is 
anticipated that the EFS analyses will take place at about 48, 58, and 73 months from start of 1:1:1 
randomization. The trigger of the first interim analysis is event driven. The second interim analysis will 
take place when 167 events are observed or one year after the first interim analysis, whichever occurs 
first. The final analysis will take place when approximately 185 events are observed or four years after 
the last subject’s randomization (i.e. December 2023). The stopping boundaries at the interim and 
final EFS analyses will be derived based on the exact number of events using Lan-DeMets alpha 
spending function with O’Brien- Fleming boundaries. If the interim analyses of EFS are performed at 
exactly 148 and 167 events, the nominal significance level for EFS superiority will be 0.024 and 0.030, 
respectively. The nominal significance level for the final look of EFS after 185 events would then be 
0.038. 
Power Considerations for Overall Survival 
A total of 185 events ensure that an overall 2-sided 5% significance level sequential test procedure 
with 3 interim analyses after approximately 101, 128 and 161 events (55%, 69% and 87% of events 
required for final analysis) in 358 randomized participants will have 82% power assuming an 
exponential distribution with the median OS time in the control (Arm B) is 54 months and of 83 
months in the nivolumab and platinum doublet chemotherapy (Arm C) (corresponding to a target 
hazard ratio of 0.65). It is anticipated that the analyses will take place at about 48 (EFS IA1), 58 (EFS 
IA2), 73 (EFS FA), and 86 months from start of 1:1:1 randomization. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 51/149 
 
 
 
The trigger for these interim analyses timing is based on the EFS number of events. However, in case 
EFS hits significance earlier than OS, the OS analyses will be triggered by the number of OS events 
(approximately 128 OS events or 1 year after Interim Analysis 1, whichever occurs first for Interim 2 
and 161 OS events or 4 years after last subject’s randomization, whichever occurs first for Interim 3). 
The stopping boundaries at the interim and final OS analyses will be derived based on the exact 
number of events using Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. This 
spending function is specific to OS and accounts for potential interim OS analyses even if they did not 
actually take place because of EFS nonsignificance. 
If the interim analyses of OS is performed at exactly 101, 128 and 161 events, respectively, the 
nominal significance level for OS superiority are 0.005, 0.013 and 0.028, respectively. The nominal 
significance level for the final analysis of OS after 185 events would then be 0.039. 
Randomisation 
Per the initial protocol, subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were centrally randomized (1:1 to Arms 
A [nivo+ipi] and B [chemo]) by the investigator or designee using an IRT system.  
Per revised Protocol 02, subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were centrally randomized (1:1:1 to 
Arms A [nivo+ipi], B [chemo] and C [nivo+chemo]) by the investigator or designee using an IRT 
system. 
Per revised Protocol 03, all subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were centrally randomized (1:1 to 
Arms B [chemo] and C [nivo+chemo]) by the investigator or designee using an IRT system.  
The randomization was based on randomization lists generated using permutated blocks and stratified 
according to: 
• 
• 
• 
PD-L1 status (≥1% and <1% or not evaluable/indeterminate) 
disease stage (IB/II vs. IIIA) 
gender  
For each randomization period (A:B, A:B:C, B:C) a separate randomization list was generated. As each 
site received IRB/IEC approval of the revised protocol, the IRT switched to the new randomization list 
at each respective site. From that point on, the site only enrolled under the revised protocol. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study so blinding procedures between participants and investigators are not 
applicable. The BIPR and BICR were blinded. 
Statistical methods 
Type I error control 
The sample size of the study is calculated based on the primary endpoint of EFS and accounts for the 
multiple primary endpoints comparisons: pCR (per BIPR) and EFS (per BICR) with an initial alpha 
allocation of 0.01 and 0.04 respectively. Formal analyses of pCR and EFS may be conducted at 
different timepoints. The fallback method will be used, i.e., if the pCR comparison between Arm C and 
Arm B is statistically significant, then 0.01 alpha allocated to pCR will be passed to the EFS comparison 
for Arm C vs. Arm B and the EFS comparison will be conducted at the alpha = 0.05 level. If the pCR 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 52/149 
 
 
 
comparison between Arm C and Arm B is not statistically significant, then the EFS comparison for Arm 
C vs. Arm B will be conducted at the alpha = 0.04 level. If EFS is significant, the secondary endpoint 
OS will be tested hierarchically, at the same overall alpha level as EFS, using a separate O’Brien 
Fleming alpha spending function for OS. 
The overall alpha was to be controlled using the following procedure:  
1)  The primary endpoint pCR rate was to be tested at 1% alpha. 
a. 
if pCR rate was not significant, the primary endpoint EFS was to be tested at 4% 
b. 
if pCR rate was significant, the 1% alpha was to be re-allocated to the EFS primary 
endpoint which was to be tested at 5% alpha level 
2) 
if EFS is significant, OS will be tested hierarchically at the same level as EFS. 
EFS and OS will be tested at planned interim and final analyses. Stopping boundaries are calculated for 
each endpoint according to the observed number of events by Lan-DeMets alpha spending function 
with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries corresponding to an overall alpha of 4% or 5%. Given EFS and OS 
endpoints are tested using group sequential approach, overall hierarchical testing approach will be 
used where each endpoint will have its own specific Lan DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien-
Fleming boundaries. 
Additionally, with this sample size, assuming a pCR rate of 10% in the chemo arm (Arm B) 
chemotherapy and 30% in the nivo+chemo arm (Arm C), 350 subjects would provide more than 90% 
power to detect an odds ratio of 3.857 with a 2 sided type I error of 1%. 
A total of 185 EFS events ensured that an overall 2-sided 5% significance level sequential test 
procedure with 2 interim analyses after 148 events (80% of events required for final analysis) and 167 
events (90% of events required for final analysis) in 358 randomized subjects would have 82% power, 
assuming an HR of 0.65 between the 2 arms. The trigger of the IA1 of EFS (presented in this CSR) was 
event driven (at least 148 events; 20 Oct 2021 database lock). The stopping boundaries at the interim 
and final EFS analyses were to be derived based on the exact number of events using Lan DeMets 
alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries.  
A total of 185 OS events ensures that an overall 2-sided 5% significance level sequential test 
procedure with 3 interim analyses after approximately 101, 128 and 161 events (55%, 69% and 87% 
of events required for final analysis) in 358 randomized subjects would have 82% power, assuming an 
exponential distribution with the median OS time in the chemo arm being 54 months and in the 
nivo+chemo arm being 83 months (corresponding to a target HR of 0.65). It was anticipated that the 
analyses would take place at about 48 (EFS IA1), 58 (EFS IA2), 73 (EFS final analysis [FA]), and 86 
months (OS FA) from start of 1:1:1 randomization. The trigger for these interim analyses timing is 
based on the EFS number of events. However, in case EFS hits significance earlier than OS, the formal 
remaining OS analyses will be triggered by the number of OS events (approximately 128 OS events 
[69% information fraction] or 1 year after EFS IA1, whichever occurs first for IA2 and 161 OS events 
or 4 years after last subject’s randomization, whichever occurs first for OS IA3).  
Given the potential slowdown in event rate that may be observed in the longer term in this setting and 
that could prevent the analysis being performed in a reasonable time window, if the 185th event has 
not occurred 5 years after randomization of the last participant, then the final OS analysis will take 
place at that time. In such case the FA boundary will be re-calculated based on the actual updated final 
number of events.

Efficacy analyses 
Primary Endpoints (EFS and pCR) 
The primary analysis of pCR was performed after all randomized subjects in the concurrently 
randomized (ie, from the start of 1:1:1 randomization) nivo+chemo (Arm C) and chemo (Arm B) arms 
had an opportunity for surgery. The pCR rate was computed for each treatment arm along with the 
exact 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method.  The numerator was based on randomized subjects 
achieving pCR in both the tumor and lymph nodes, as assessed by BIPR. The denominator was based 
on all subjects concurrently randomized to the nivo+chemo (Arm C) and chemo (Arm B) arms. 
Subjects who were no longer eligible for surgery, or who were on alternative anti-cancer therapy 
before surgery, or who discontinued before surgery, or for whom pCR results were not available, were

EMA/287093/2023

all counted as non responders. pCR was compared for concurrently randomized nivo+chemo vs. chemo 
using the stratified Cochran Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with a 2 sided, 1% alpha level. An estimate of 
the difference and odds ratio and corresponding 99% CI were calculated using CMH methodology 
adjusting for stratification factors. 
The primary analysis of EFS compared the concurrently randomized Arm C (nivo+chemo) and Arm B 
(chemo) using a stratified log-rank test, with stratification factors per IRT (PD-L1 expression [≥1% or 
<1%/not evaluable/indeterminate], disease stage [IB/II vs IIIA], and gender/sex) and a 2 sided p-
value. A Lan DeMets α-spending function with O’Brien and Fleming type of boundary was used to 
determine the nominal significance levels for the interim and final analyses. The HR and the 
corresponding (1 adjusted alpha) CI were estimated for Arm C vs. Arm B using a stratified Cox 
proportional hazards model with the randomized arm as a single covariate. The EFS curves for each 
randomized arm were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) product limit method. The median and 
2-sided 95% CI for median EFS in each treatment group was computed using the log-log 
transformation method. In addition, EFS rates at different timepoints were estimated using KM 
estimates on the EFS curve for each randomized arm. Associated 2 sided 95% CIs were calculated 
using the Greenwood formula (using log-log transformation). 
Secondary endpoint (TTDM) 
The secondary endpoint of TTDM was analyzed descriptively without hypothesis testing. TTDM, based 
on BICR assessments, was compared between the treatment groups (concurrent Arms C [nivo+chemo] 
and B [chemo]), using the same methods as those described above for EFS. 
Secondary endpoint (OS) 
If EFS was significant, the OS secondary endpoint was to be tested hierarchically at the same overall 
level as EFS. 
Exploratory endpoints (EFS2, EFS by pCR/MPR, Biomarker Analyses) 
Event-free survival on the next line of therapy (EFS2) was assessed in concurrent Arms B 
(nivo+chemo) and C (chemo), using the same methods as those described above for EFS, with no 
hypothesis testing. This analysis was descriptive. 
EFS (based on BICR assessments, primary definition) KM curves were generated by pCR status and by 
MPR status from randomization for all concurrently randomized subjects in Arms C (nivo+chemo) and 
B (chemo). Median and 95% CI were provided. HR and 95% CIs for concurrently randomized subjects 
in Arms C (nivo+chemo) and B (chemo) were provided by pCR and by MPR status, as well as HR of 
pCR/MPR vs. no pCR/MPR by treatment arm.  
In addition, these analyses were repeated, landmarked at the time of surgery (ie, time from surgery to 
progression or death) and limited to subjects with pCR or MPR status available who underwent 
surgery. Median and 95% CIs were provided. HR and 95% CIs for concurrently randomized subjects in 
Arms C (nivo+chemo) and B (chemo) were provided by pCR and by MPR status, as well as HR of 
pCR/MPR vs. no pCR/MPR by treatment arm. 
Note that if a subset category had less than 10 subjects per treatment arm, the HR was not 
computed/displayed. 
Regarding biomarker analyses, descriptive analyses were conducted to report the distribution of 
tumour cell PD-L1 and TMB using continuous values or categories. Association of PD-L1 and TMB with 
efficacy endpoints (EFS) was explored by running separate analyses for each category of the 
biomarker.  
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 56/149 
 
 
 
The categories used for PD-L1 were PD-L1 <1%, PD-L1 ≥1%, PD-L1 1-49%, PD-L1 ≥50%, PD-L1 
indeterminate/not evaluable. The categories for tumour TMB were < 12.3 mut/Mb, ≥12.3 mut/Mb, and 
not evaluable/not reported. 
In the subjects concurrently randomized to Arms C (nivo+chemo) and B (chemo), a Cox proportional 
hazards regression model was fitted for EFS with PD-L1 (or TMB), treatment arm and PD-L1 (or TMB) 
by treatment arm interaction, among all biomarker evaluable subjects and reported a plot of estimated 
log HR with 95% CI vs. PD-L1 expression (or TMB). 
Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 17: Participant Flow Chart – Study CA209816 
* Screen failure.  
†  Includes 113 enrolled patients randomized to an exploratory neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm for which enrollment was 
closed early and the arm discontinued, and 34 patients randomized to chemotherapy in the initial protocol (ie, prior to the addition 
of the nivo+chemo arm) who were not included in the primary analysis population. 
At the time of the database lock for the CSR (20-Oct-2021), all treated subjects were off neoadjuvant 
study treatment for >18 months. Most subjects had completed the course of neoadjuvant therapy 
(93.8% and 84.7% of treated subjects in the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, respectively). The 
proportion of subjects not completing the neoadjuvant treatment period due to study drug toxicity was 
similar in the 2 arms: nivo+chemo (5.7%) and chemo (6.8%). 
The reasons for not completing the neoadjuvant treatment period are summarized in Table 21.

Recruitment 
The enrolment period for the study was from Mar-2017 to Nov-2019. A total of 773 subjects were 
enrolled at 111 sites in 14 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, 
South Korea, Romania, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United States), and 505 subjects were 
randomized: 358 concurrently randomized to Arms C (nivo+chemo: 179) and B (chemo: 179). A total 
of 113 subjects were randomized to Arm A (nivo+ipi).  
An addendum to the CSR was provided including exploratory analyses for the key endpoints, with 
longer follow-up, at the time when the OS IA2 was performed. The key dates and follow-up are 
included in Table 22 below. Updated results for efficacy endpoints and OS IA2 are included in each

Summary of Key Changes 
Incorporated changes from Amendment 02 and Administrative Letters 01 and 02. 
Clarified the use of TNM 7th edition on the study, adjusted dosing details of the 
chemotherapy regimens to include the dose approved by the local prescribing 
information and the standard of care infusion time for each country, expanded 
and split the biomarker objective into 3 more detailed objectives, clarified lymph 
node samples at screening and definitive surgery, clarified the tissue sample 
process for calculation of primary endpoint, clarified requirements for PET/CT 
scans and broadened the window for scans prior to surgery, adjusted hepatitis B 
virus criteria, added live vaccines and strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) 
inhibitors to the prohibited treatments, added caution for concomitant 
administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with 
pemetrexed, and added unacceptable methods of contraception. 
Added the third arm of nivo+chemo (Arm C), increased the sample size to 642 to 
accommodate the new treatment arm, changed the primary objective to dual 
primary objectives of pCR and EFS and a secondary objective was changed to 
MPR based on health authority feedback, increased the pre-screening tissue 
requirement to 15 slides, updated contrast requirements for brain MRI scans, 
expanded the window for pulmonary function tests to within 6 weeks of 
randomization, and included updates to synopsis, rationale/background 
information, and study personnel. 
Stopped enrolment in Arm A (nivo+ipi) and made the primary population 
concurrently randomized subjects on Arms B and C based on external clinical 
data with PD-1 + chemo, clarified the definition of EFS, excluded subjects with 
large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma tumour histology, added an additional 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy regimen (paclitaxel/carboplatin), updated dose 
modification for docetaxel, added time to death or distant metastases as a 
secondary endpoint, clarified tumour assessments for subjects who did not 
proceed to definitive surgery, updated the SAP, rationale, background 
information, and trial schematic, clarified pulmonary function parameters, 
clarified the time relationship between adjuvant radiotherapy and tumour imaging 
assessments, and clarified the time window of Cycle 1 Day 1 end-of-infusion PK 
sampling. 
Updated the collection of serum/plasma-soluble factors post-surgery, added the 
concomitant administration of substances that were also tuburlarly secreted (e.g., 
probenecid) and could potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed, 
added hypothesis testing for OS, clarified the analysis population for pCR, added 
an exploratory endpoint of EFS on the next line of therapy, added instructions for 
BICR, and updated AE appendix.

A total of 3 subjects (1 in the nivo+chemo arm and 2 in the concurrent chemo arm) received concurrent 
cancer therapy. The subject in the nivo+chemo arm received 2 doses of albumin-based paclitaxel instead 
of Cremophor-based paclitaxel during the optional adjuvant phase. In the chemo arm, 1 subject received 
cantharidinate sodium/vitamin B6 injection (dicanth/pyrdx) and the other subject received thymopentin. 
Note  that  1  subject  randomized  to  Arm  A  (nivo+ipi)  prior  to  Revised  Protocol  02  received  the  wrong 
treatment of chemotherapy. This subject is counted in Arm A (nivo+ipi) for baseline and efficacy analyses 
(analyses based on the randomized population) and is counted in Arm B (chemo) for exposure and safety 
analyses  (based  on  the  treated  population).  However,  since  this  subject  was  randomized  before 
implementation of Revised Protocol 02, the subject is not included in the All Treated Subjects from the 
Concurrently Randomized Arms C (nivo+chemo) and B (chemo) population. 
Relevant protocol deviations were defined in the SAP.

Outcomes and estimation 
For the analysis of EFS and pCR, the minimum follow-up (time between last subject randomized 
[11-Dec-2019] and last subject last visit [08-Sep-2021]) was 21.0 months and median follow-up was 
29.5 months in the concurrently randomized nivo+chemo and chemo arms. 
Updated exploratory analyses for some of the key endpoints were performed at the time of the OS IA2 
(DBL 14-Oct-2022). As of 14-Oct-2022, in the concurrently randomized nivo+chemo and chemo arms, 
the minimum follow-up was 32.9 months and the median follow-up was 41.4 months. These analyses 
results are included in the corresponding endpoint sections. 
A summary of the main efficacy results in the ITT population and in the subset of patients 
corresponding to the finally agreed indication (subjects with baseline disease stage II-IIIA and PD-L1 
expression ≥ 1%) is included below in Table 37.

review (primarily because surgery did not occur), and 5 (2.8%) primary tumour samples were 
deemed not evaluable.  
•  A sensitivity analysis of pCR per BIPR in all response evaluable subjects was consistent with 
the primary analysis and favoured nivo+chemo: 30.5% (43/141; 95% CI: 23.0, 38.8) with 
nivo+chemo vs 4/126 (3.2%, 95% CI: 0.9, 7.9) with chemo; odds ratio: 13.81 (99% CI: 3.34, 
57.04); strata-adjusted difference based on CMH method: 27.1% (99% CI: 16.5, 37.7). 
• 
pCR rates were generally consistent for subjects randomized under Revised Protocol 02 
(27.0% [20/74] with nivo+chemo and 4.1% [3/74] with chemo) and after Revised Protocol 02 
(21.9% [23/105] with nivo+chemo and 1.0% [1/105] with chemo). 
•  A lower median percentage of viable tumour was observed with nivo+chemo (10.0%) 
compared with chemo (74%) in concurrently randomized subjects who underwent surgery. 
The pCR by BIPR results in subjects with baseline disease stage II-IIIA and PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% 
(exploratory subgroup analysis) are included in Table 37 above.

OS IA2 (DBL 14-Oct-2022) 
In an OS analysis of concurrently randomized subjects at the planned IA2 (1 year after IA1, 60.0% 
information fraction), nivo+chemo continued to demonstrate an favourable trend in OS compared with 
chemo: HR = 0.62 (99.34% CI: 0.36, 1.05; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.90); stratified log-rank test p-value = 
0.0124 (p < 0.0066 needed for statistical significance. Median OS was not reached in either arm. 
There were only 17 additional OS events since IA1, which were distributed relatively equally across the 
arms (9 nivo+chemo and 8 chemo). 75.4% and 62.6% of subjects in the nivo+chemo and chemo 
arms, respectively, were censored for OS (70.4% and 54.2% were in follow-up).

Time to Death or Distant Metastases (TTDM) 
In concurrently randomized subjects, median TTDM per BICR was longer with nivo+chemo compared 
with chemo (median: not reached vs. 26.71 months; HR = 0.53 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.77]). TTDM rates 
were higher with nivo+chemo compared with chemo: 85.7% vs. 76.0% at 12 months and 75.8% vs. 
57.1% at 24 months, respectively (Table 17, figure 16). 
Investigators were not required to continue trial imaging for TTDM if a subject experienced a BICR-
verified locoregional recurrence without any distant metastases; these subjects were censored at their 
last available tumour assessment or counted as an event if they died.

Analysis of EFS per BICR using the secondary EFS definition, which does not apply censoring at 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy usage: HR=0.63; (97.38% CI: 0.44, 0.89); this analysis was 
consistent with the analysis using the primary EFS definition.

The updated analysis of EFS per BICR using the secondary EFS definition had a similar HR to the EFS 
analysis using the primary definition: HR=0.66 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.89). 
EFS by Investigator  
EFS per investigator assessment (primary definition) showed a result consistent with the BICR primary 
analysis (median EFS 41.56 vs 20.67 months; HR=0.53 [95% CI: 0.38, 0.74]). In concurrently 
randomized subjects, concordance between BICR and investigator-assessed EFS was high (95.7%). 
EFS by Randomization Period 
EFS results for nivo+chemo vs chemo were consistent by randomization period including under 
Revised Protocol 02 (HR=0.67; 95% CI: 0.40, 1.10) and after Revised Protocol 02 (HR=0.61; 95% CI: 
0.39, 0.94). KM curves have been provided and are included below (Figure 34[under Revised Protocol

Other sensitivity analyses for EFS 
Results for the following sensitivity analyses of EFS per BICR were consistent with the primary 
analysis:

•  Analysis using baseline stratification factors per CRF (rather than IRT): HR=0.64 (95% CI: 
0.46, 0.89)  
•  Analysis accounting for missing tumour assessments prior to the EFS event; for subjects with 2 
or more missed visits prior to the EFS event, EFS was censored at the last tumour assessment 
prior to the EFS event: HR=0.66 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.92).  
•  Analysis using an unstratified Cox model: HR =0.63 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.87). 
• 
• 
• 
The analysis of EFS accounting for BICR progression prior to surgery was consistent with the 
primary analysis (HR=0.62 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.86]). 
Two chemo regimens were allowed in the chemo arm, but not in the nivo+chemo arm. As a 
sensitivity analysis, EFS was evaluated comparing the nivo+chemo arm (n = 179) to subjects 
in the chemo arm (n=134) who received the chemo regimens available to both arms. The 
results were consistent with the primary analysis (adjusted HR=0.57; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.81). 
Per-protocol adjuvant systemic chemo was optional and was received by 26 (14.8%) subjects 
in the nivo+chemo arm and 44 (25.0%) subjects in the chemo arm. Results for the EFS per 
BICR (primary definition) analysis adjusted by receiving systemic adjuvant chemo (as a time 
dependent covariate), favored nivo+chemo over chemo (adjusted HR=0.65; 95% CI: 0.47, 
0.90). 
OS by subgroups 
The first interim analysis of OS between concurrently randomized subjects in the nivo+chemo and 
chemo arms was performed with a relatively small number of death events (94 of the 185 events for 
the final analysis of OS; 50.8% information fraction).

Given the delayed separation of the curves leading to non-proportional hazards, an ad hoc sensitivity 
restricted mean survival time (RMST) analysis was performed. The difference (95% CI) at 12 months 
between the nivo+chemo arm (RMST [95% CI]: 11.48 [11.19, 11.76]) and chemo arm (RMST [95% 
CI]: 11.54 [11.27, 11.80]) was -0.06 (-0.45, 0.33). At 24 months, the difference (95% CI) between 
the nivo+chemo arm (RMST [95% CI]: 21.71 [20.87, 22.54]) and chemo arm (RMST [95% CI]: 21.09 
[20.26, 21.91]) was 0.62 (-0.56, 1.80), and at the maximum timepoint (45.3 months), the difference 
(95% CI) between the nivo+chemo arm (RMST [95% CI]: 38.41 [36.29, 40.53]) and chemo arm 
(RMST [95% CI]: 34.73 [32.48, 36.98]) was 3.68 (0.59, 6.77), showing an increase in the difference 
between the 2 arms over time. RMST analyses by disease stage, PD-L1, and histology subgroups have 
been provided. 
As expected, the second interim analysis of OS (DBL 14-Oct-2022) between concurrently randomized 
subjects in the nivo+chemo and chemo arms was performed with a relatively small number of death 
events (111 of the 185 events for the final analysis of OS; 60.0% information fraction). Analyses of 
subgroups were then further limited by even smaller numbers of events. Nevertheless, key subgroups 
were summarized for OS (Figure 39).

indeterminate/NE (n = 25) for which the confidence interval crosses 0 but the point estimate favours 
nivo+chemo (Figure 41).

EFS by pCR and MPR Status 
pCR and MPR results were unchanged at the current 20 Oct 2021 database lock compared with the 
earlier database lock (16-Sep-2020). In both the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, subjects with a pCR 
and MPR had longer EFS than subjects without a pCR/MPR. 
EFS by pCR 
• 
In the nivo+chemo arm, the EFS HR for pCR vs. no pCR was 0.13 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.37). In the 
chemo arm, no HR was computed due to the small number of subjects achieving a pCR (n=4). 
•  A highly significant improvement in pCR rate was observed with nivo+chemo vs. chemo alone 
(24.0% [43/179] vs. 2.2% [4/179]; strata-adjusted difference based on CMH method: 21.6% 
[99% CI: 13.0, 30.3]). 
•  Among subjects without a pCR, the median EFS was 26.55 (nivo+chemo) vs .18.40 months 
(chemo) (HR=0.84 [95% CI: 0.61, 1.17]). In subjects with a pCR, median EFS was not 
reached in both the nivo+chemo and chemo arms (Figure 19). 
EFS by MPR 
• 
• 
In the nivo+chemo arm, the EFS HR for MPR vs. no MPR was 0.21 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.41). In 
the chemo arm, the EFS HR for MPR vs. no MPR was 0.29 (0.11, 0.79). 
The MPR rate per BIPR for nivo+chemo vs. chemo was 36.9% (95% CI: 29.8, 44.4) vs 8.9% 
(95% CI: 5.2, 14.1); odds ratio = 5.70 (95% CI: 3.16, 10.26). 
•  Among subjects with a MPR, the HR for nivo+chemo vs. chemo was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.23, 2.24) 
and among subjects without a MPR, the HR for nivo+chemo vs. chemo was 0.91 (95% CI: 
0.64, 1.28). In subjects with a MPR, median EFS was not reached in both the nivo+chemo and 
chemo arms (Figure 42).

Design 
CA209816 is an open-label, randomized Phase 3 study of nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 
weeks [Q2W]; up to 3 cycles) and a single 1 mg/kg dose of ipilimumab (nivo+ipi), 
nivolumab 360 mg flat dose plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy (every 3 weeks 
[Q3W] up to 3 cycles; nivo+chemo), or platinum-doublet chemotherapy (Q3W up to 3 
cycles; chemo) as neoadjuvant treatment in subjects with resectable (Stage IB [≥4 
cm], Stage II, and resectable Stage IIIA) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  
The 2 primary endpoints are to compare pathologic complete response (pCR) by 
blinded independent pathological review (BIPR) and event-free survival (EFS) by 
blinded independent central review (BICR) in subjects in subjects concurrently

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
With the current application the MAH applied for an extension of the indication for OPDIVO, in 
combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, to be used as a neoadjuvant treatment of resectable 
non-small cell lung cancer. To support this application, results from study CA209816 (CheckMate 816) 
were submitted. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
CA209816 is an open-label, randomized, phase 3 study of nivolumab combined with different 
platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of stage IB-IIIA NSCLC in the neoadjuvant 
setting. The study was originally designed to assess the efficacy and safety of nivolumab+ipilimumab 
compared to chemotherapy but an additional nivolumab+chemotherapy treatment arm was later 
included. The latter was chosen as the experimental treatment for the main analysis, based on 
emerging external data that suggested that the combination of nivolumab+ipilimumab was not 
appropriate for this neoadjuvant setting and positive results of nivolumab+chemotherapy from 
different studies such as phase 2 study NADIM. Enrolment in the nivolumab+ipilimumab arm was later 
closed but subjects previously randomized continued in the study and received treatment as planned. 
Although blinding would have been preferred, the multiple chemotherapy regimens allowed added 
difficulties to a possible blinded design. The primary endpoints assessments were done by independent 
committees (BIPR and BICR), which is reassuring in the context of the open-label design. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are generally endorsed and are in line with other chemo-
immunotherapy studies. Patients could be enrolled having a histologically confirmed Stage IB (≥4 cm), 
II, IIIA (N2) NSCLC (per the 7th AJCC TNM edition) with disease that was considered resectable. 
During the conduct of this study, TNM staging system transitioned to the 8th edition which carries 
some differences that apply to the enrolled population, and which is the one currently used for patients

staging in clinical practice. This could be confusing as, based on the updated TNM (8th), only tumours 
of 4 cm remain as stage IB and T3-T4N2 are now stage IIIB, both of them being part of the enrolled 
population in this study. Details of staging criteria / characteristics of the included patients are included 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Further details about patients staging at study entry were provided, 
including specific recommendations for suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes. Brain MRI or head CT was 
required during screening for all subjects with stage II-III disease or any subject with suspicion of 
brain metastasis. However, a small risk of staging discrepancies always remains and could be a source 
of heterogeneity among the enrolled population.  
Patients were included in the study regardless of PD-L1 expression. However, tumour tissue was 
required for PD-L1 expression determination by a central lab during screening period. Participants with 
‘known’ EGFR mutations or ALK translocation were excluded from the study per protocol.   
Stratification factors were disease stage (IB-II vs. III based on 7th TNM edition), PD-L1 status (<1% 
vs. ≥1%) and gender. Histology could have also been an adequate stratification factor because of the 
different prognosis squamous and non-squamous NSCLC presents. Although both histologies were 
balanced in the overall population, some differences were identified across arms, adding some 
heterogeneity to the comparison. 
The chemotherapy schemes allowed both in the experimental and comparator arm seem adequate as 
they are the regimens commonly used in either the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. The decision was 
up to the investigator, based on histology (squamous or non-squamous), preference and other factors 
like tolerance to cisplatin. The fact that the choice of chemotherapy regimen, for both treatment arms, 
was performed after randomization represents a limitation of the study design, as it could have led to 
biased decisions. Another important limitation of this study was the different chemotherapy regimens 
available in the experimental arm in comparison with the chemotherapy arm which adds certain grade 
of heterogeneity to the analyses. The MAH has justified that no safety information was available for the 
combination of nivolumab plus vinorelbine or docetaxel at the time when the nivo+chemo arm was 
added. This is somehow unfortunate as the combinations used in this study do not completely reflect 
the usual clinical practice, where, for example, cisplatin + vinorelbine would be the preferred choice for 
non-squamous histology in this setting, and not cisplatin + pemetrexed. The currently available 
information about these schemes that were not allowed in the experimental arm is still limited, 
especially for the use of nivolumab in combination with cisplatin and vinorelbine. Chemotherapy 
components dosing could be decided following local recommendations within a protocol-guided dose 
range, being the highest allowed doses the most commonly used in our practice. The use of 3 cycles is 
in line with guidelines recommendations. 
The MAH conducted a number of relevant changes with regards to the study design and consequently, 
the sample size estimation was affected considerably. Initially, the sample size was calculated based 
on two arms (A and B) with MPR in PD-L1≥1% as primary endpoint. Afterwards, at the time of the 
revised protocol 02 and based on emerging external data, an additional arm was incorporated (Arm C) 
and the primary endpoint was changed into pCR and EFS. Consequently, the sample size was updated 
with these relevant changes by considering at this point 642 subjects. At the time of the Revised 
protocol 03, the arm A was dropped and the sample size was updated accordingly by considering only 
a total of 358 patients.   
The sample size of the study was calculated based on the multiple primary endpoint comparisons: pCR 
and EFS with an initial alpha allocation of 0.01 and 0.04 respectively. To obtain a power of 90% in 
pCR, 350 patients were considered needed with an expected pCR rate of 10% on Arm B and 30% on 
Arm C with an alpha of 1%. On the other hand, to achieve 82% power in EFS assuming an HR of 0.65 
between the two Arms, 185 events were considered needed with an overall alpha of 5%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 100/149 
 
 
 
Additionally, the MAH performed a number of changes with regards to the interim analyses planned for 
EFS. The current results are presented based on the pre-planned first interim analysis conducted when 
151 EFS events were accrued (i.e. 82% of the 185 events calculated for the final EFS analysis).  
Overall, the final assumptions and the calculations performed for the sample size are followed and they 
can be considered agreeable. Also, the strategy of recycling the value of alpha through different 
endpoints when certain endpoints are statistically significant can be also endorsed from a 
methodological perspective. 
As outlined above, the study protocol was subject to multiple amendments and the design, objectives, 
endpoints, population of analysis and statistical methods were completely changed during the conduct 
of the study.  The sponsor used an independent DMC and multiple external vendors to ensure correct 
data management. Further, several additional sensitivity analyses, including according to different 
protocol versions, have been performed showing consistent results (see further details below). Overall, 
it seems that integrity of the data was maintained during study conduct and data can be considered 
reliable to support the proposed extension of the indication.  
The original primary endpoint, MPR, was later substituted by dual primary endpoints of pCR and EFS, 
by BIPR and BICR, respectively. This change seems appropriate. EFS is an adequate endpoint in this 
setting since it includes events pre- and post-surgery, but it needs to be supported at least by a non-
detrimental effect in OS, as the proposed neoadjuvant treatment is given in a potential curative 
setting. Subjects who did not undergo surgery for reasons other than progression were considered to 
have an event. The main analyses of EFS use the primary definition, censoring for subsequent therapy. 
A sensitivity analysis of EFS (secondary definition) not incorporating censoring due to subsequent 
therapy (EMA preferred) has also been performed. pCR has not been validated as a surrogate endpoint 
of survival but results on this endpoint provides information about treatment’s antitumour activity and 
are considered supportive. Secondary endpoints are OS, TTDM and MPR. The exploratory endpoint of 
EFS on next line therapy (EFS2) has also been analysed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 773 patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 505 were randomized to receive either 
nivo+ipi (n=113), chemo (n=213) or nivo+chemo (n=179). The primary population for the efficacy 
analyses (n=358) is comprised by all subjects concurrently randomized to the nivo+chemo and chemo 
arm (n=179 each). From the 268 not randomized subjects, 227 (29.4%) no longer met study criteria, 
26 (3.4%) withdrew consent, one (0.1%) subject reported an adverse event and 14 (1.8) were not 
randomized due to “other” reasons. One hundred seventy-six subjects were treated in both 
nivo+chemo and chemo arms, 165 (93%) subjects in the nivo+chemo arm and 149 (84.7%) in the 
chemo arm completed the three cycles of neoadjuvant treatment. Apart from the subjects who did not 
complete neoadjuvant treatment due to disease progression (one and two in the nivo+chemo and 
chemo arm, respectively) and the ones that discontinued treatment due to study drug toxicity (5.7% 
vs. 6.8%), 13 subjects discontinued treatment due to other reasons (AE unrelated, subject request, 
withdrew consent and no longer meeting study criteria) and all of them were from the chemo arm. 
These discontinuations were further analysed and a possible relation to the open-label design cannot 
be discarded. Overall, having all discontinuations due to other reasons in the control arm and 
considering that the combination is an “add-on” treatment, these data should not affect the benefit-
risk assessment. At the time of the DBL, all treated subjects were off neoadjuvant treatment for >18 
months.  
A low number of deviations were reported and are not expected to have impacted the study results.  
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 101/149 
 
 
 
Baseline patient characteristics were balanced between treatment arms. For baseline disease 
characteristics, squamous and non-squamous histologies were equally balanced in the overall 
population but there were some imbalances between arms. The reported imbalances are limited and 
are not expected to have any clinically relevant impact on the outcomes.  
Disease stage at study entrance (IRT) was a stratification factor (IB-II vs. IIIA) and therefore balanced 
between arms, but also a similar number of subjects from each stage was included in both treatment 
arms. The overall number of stage III patients included (62.6%) was higher than initially predicted but 
this is somehow expected, as neoadjuvant treatment for NSCLC is only recommended in the majority 
of guidelines and local protocols for stage III patients that present a resectable tumour considered not 
operable, at first, by a multidisciplinary team. Even though most patients randomized were stage III 
(by TNM 7th edition), 36.6% of subjects were stage IB and II, with a considerably better prognosis 
and many of them being cured after resection, that could lead to better overall results than the ones 
observed with only stage III patients. Of note the number of stage IB patients is very limited in the 
study (n=18). Predefined subgroups analyses by stratification factors and requested efficacy analyses 
by individual stages have been provided and are discussed below.  Discrepancies between IRT and CRF 
recorded stages (stratification subgroups) have been identified. Although they did not reach the pre-
established 10% threshold, a sensitivity analysis of EFS by disease stage (CRF) was submitted. For PD-
L1 tumour cell expression, 155 (43.3%) subjects presented <1% expression and 178 (49.7%) 
subjects presented tumour cell expression ≥1%. Demographic and baseline disease characteristics 
have also been provided for the subset of patients corresponding to the finally agreed indication, i.e. 
subjects with baseline disease stage II-IIIA and tumour PD-L1 expression ≥1%. No relevant 
differences have been identified between them and those of the ITT population. 
After neoadjuvant treatment, 83.2% subjects from the nivo+chemo arm and 75.4% from the 
concurrently randomized patients to the chemo arm underwent definitive surgery. From the subjects 
whose surgeries were not performed, a 42.9% of subjects in the nivo+chemo arm and 45.9% in the 
chemo arm did not undergo surgery due to confirmed disease progression. Around 50% subjects from 
each arm had their surgery cancelled due to “other” reasons such as being unsuitable for surgery, 
refusing surgery, etc. The post-surgical disease status is considered to be a key risk factor for 
recurrence. There were not relevant differences between patients who did not have surgery due to 
disease progression in both arms but there were more R0 resections in the nivo+chemo arm (83.2% 
vs. 77.8%) for the overall population.  
Adjuvant therapy was allowed per protocol. From the treated population (n=176 in each arm), 14.8% 
subjects from the nivo+chemo arm and 25% from the chemo arm received adjuvant systemic therapy. 
This is considered another source of heterogeneity in this study as this treatment could have an impact 
on the “time to event” endpoints, although it should reflect the current clinical practice in this setting. 
When comparing demographics and disease characteristics at study entry between patients who 
received adjuvant therapy and the overall randomized population, some slight imbalances were 
identified but they are not considered clinically relevant, even more when this is a small subgroup of 
patients. It is acknowledged that there are several studies and treatment developments in the 
neoadjuvant setting that include further adjuvant therapy. 
Up to the DCO, 38 (21.2%) subjects in the nivo+chemo arm and 78 (43.6%) in the chemo arm 
received subsequent systemic therapy. The most commonly received therapy was chemotherapy 
(15.1% in the nivo+chemo arm and 22.3% of subjects in the chemo arm). A certain number of 
patients received subsequent immunotherapy (5.6% vs. 23.5%), and, as expected, higher number 
was observed in the chemo arm. It is noted that some patients received subsequent ALK/EGFR TKIs (4 
and 9 subjects in the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, respectively), while known presence of these 
genetic alterations was an exclusion criterion, but testing was not mandatory at diagnosis or

enrolment. Further information about these patients was requested to confirm if a biopsy performed 
upon progression resulted in a positive EGFR or ALK tumour result. A region-specific amendment was 
implemented (Oct 2018) to include EGFR testing for non-squamous tumours at enrolment in China, 
Taiwan and Korea due to the higher prevalence of EGFR mutations in that area. However, some 
patients presenting mutations could have been randomized before this amendment or in other regions, 
as testing for these mutations it is not yet widely implemented in early-stage NSCLC. Also, some 
patients in the chemo arm received other subsequent targeted therapy such as capmatinib, entrectinib 
and regorafenib. In order to provide additional data on patients who received targeted therapy after 
the study treatment, the MAH performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding patients receiving anti-
EGFR, anti-ALK TKIs and other TKIs indicated in oncogene-driven tumours. The result of this analysis, 
excluding 15 subjects, was consistent with the primary analysis of EFS. With longer follow-up, it is 
expected to have more information about the sequence of posterior therapies for NSCLC in these 
patients. 
Within this procedure, for the primary endpoints, the final pCR per BIPR (DBL: 16-Sep-2020) 
analysis and the first IA of EFS per BICR (DBL: 20 Oct 2021) have been submitted, with a minimum 
follow-up of 21 months and median follow-up of 29.5 months.  
Nivo+chemo demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pCR rate per BIPR compared 
with chemo in concurrently randomized subjects who provided primary tumour samples: 24.0% 
(43/179; 95% CI: 18.0, 31.0) vs. 2.2% (4/179; 95% CI: 0.6, 5.6), which was not changed up to the 
later DBL. A sensitivity analysis of pCR per BIPR in all response evaluable subjects was consistent with 
the primary analysis. The subgroup analyses of pCR were also consistent with the primary. 
In the first IA of EFS by BICR, nivo+chemo also showed a statistically significant improvement 
compared with chemo in concurrently randomized subjects: median EFS was 31.57 vs. 20.80 months; 
HR=0.63 (97.38% CI: 0.43, 0.91); stratified log-rank test p value=0.0052. There were 115/179 
(64.2%) subjects in the nivo+chemo arm and 92/179 (51.4%) subjects in the chemo arm censored in 
this analysis. This IA, although performed at 82% (151 events) needed for the final EFS analysis 
(planned at 185 events), is considered to be a bit premature, with a high percentage of censored 
subjects. The sensitivity analysis of EFS by BICR not censoring at subsequent therapy (secondary 
definition, EMA preferred) showed consistent results with the primary analysis: HR=0.63; (97.38% CI: 
0.44, 0.89), median EFS 31.57 (27.79, NA) months and 18.99 (14, 25.17) months for the nivo+chemo 
and chemo arm, respectively. Results from the subgroup analyses were generally consistent with the 
main analysis. An exploratory EFS analysis was performed based on a 14-Oct-2022 DBL (32.9 months 
minimum follow-up). It must be noted that only a few of new events were reported since IA1 (6 EFS 
events and 17 OS events) making the possibility of observing a different treatment effect very unlikely. 
Based on this later DBL, nivo+chemo continued to show an increased efficacy, in comparison with 
chemotherapy, in terms of EFS, with a median EFS not reached (95% CI: 31.57, NA) vs 21.06 months 
(95% CI: 14.75, 42.09) and a HR = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.93). 
For disease stage (by stratification subgroups), a clear benefit of nivo+chemo was shown for stage IIIA 
(7th edition) subjects: HR=0.54 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.80) while for stage IB/II the HR was 0.87 (95% CI: 
0.48, 1.56), although this was a smaller subgroup. Indeed, concerns were raised about the low 
representation of patients with stage IB tumours (per the 7th AJCC TNM ed) as only 18 patients (10 
and 8 subjects in the nivo+chemo and chemo treatment arm, respectively) were randomized. Whether 
homogeneity of response could be assumed for stage IB tumours, in whom based on the low numbers 
treatment efficacy could not be directly inferred, was discussed. According to current clinical 
guidelines, these patients are generally not candidates to neoadjuvant treatment, since a complete 
resection would be achieved for most of them if they proceeded directly to surgery. Treatment 
guidelines usually recommend to make the decision of treating these patients on an individual basis 
Assessment report

and this is one of the reasons why the inclusion of these patients in trials in the NSCLC (neo)adjuvant 
setting has been controversial and may explain the low number of subjects with these early stage 
tumours enrolled in study CA209816. Exposing these patients to the added toxicity of nivolumab and 
potentially risking the success of a surgery which may prove curative for most of them, does not seem 
reasonable in the absence of confirmed benefit of the combination, so the inclusion of patients with 
stage IB tumours (7th edition TNM staging system) in the therapeutic indication was not considered 
justified. 
In relation to tumour PD-L1 expression, the benefit of the combination of nivo+chemo for NSCLC 
neoadjuvant treatment is greater for subjects with a PD-L1 tumour expression ≥1%, in comparison 
with tumours presenting a PD-L1 expression <1%. When comparing main efficacy endpoints results 
between the subgroup of patients with a tumour PD-L1 expression ≥1% and <1%, all show better 
results for the PD-L1 ≥1% population, where differences between arms are bigger. The reported pCR 
rate for the nivo+chemo arm was 16.7% (95% CI: 9.2, 26.8) in the PD-L1 <1% subgroup and 32.6% 
(95% CI: 23.0, 43.3) in the PD-L1 ≥1% patients, while for the chemo arm, the pCR rate was of 2.6% 
and 2.2%, respectively. For EFS by BICR, a HR point estimate of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.32) was 
obtained for the PD-L1 <1% population while the HR was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.70) for the PD-L1 
≥1% subjects. Updated EFS subgroup analyses (DBL 14-Oct-2022) confirmed this trend: HR point 
estimate was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.35) for the PD-L1 <1% subgroup and 0.46 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.77) 
for the PD-L1 ≥1% patients. 
Regarding other EFS subgroup analyses, some differences were found but results were not conclusive. 
As pointed out before, although the multiple protocol amendments and changes over study design 
seemed to be driven by external data, performing such changes during the conduct of the study could 
entail putting the study integrity at risk. A sensitivity analysis of EFS by randomization period was 
provided and results appeared consistent between all randomization periods.  
Another source of heterogeneity, as mentioned, is the fact that different chemotherapy regimens were 
allowed, partly based on histology, in both arms. As an additional sensitivity analysis, EFS was 
evaluated comparing the nivo+chemo arm (n = 179) to subjects in the chemo arm (n=134) who 
received the chemo regimens available to both arms. The results were consistent with the primary 
analysis (adjusted HR=0.57; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.81), but this analysis, adjusted only by removing 
randomized patients, is of very limited value. Further, as adjuvant treatment was allowed per protocol, 
a sensitivity analysis of EFS adjusted by receiving systemic adjuvant chemo (as a time dependent 
covariate) was provided (adjusted HR=0.65; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.90). 
In addition, both arms display early censorings and the reasons may differ between arms, also as a 
result of the open-label design. Some sensitivity analyses were performed, in line with a treatment-
policy estimand (EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1; Appendix 1 to the Guideline on the evaluation of 
anticancer medicinal products in man) and results were consistent with the main analyses.  
Regarding secondary endpoints, TTDM per BICR was longer with nivo+chemo than chemo both for 
the primary analysis (median not reached vs. 26.71 months; HR=0.53; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.77) and the 
updated one (HR = 0.55 (95% CI 0.39, 0.78). Also, as reported in the interim CSR (DBL Sep-2020), 
MPR rate per BIPR was higher with nivo+chemo compared with chemo: 36.9% (95% CI: 29.8, 44.4) 
vs. 8.9% (95% CI: 5.2, 14.1). EFS2 was reported, as an exploratory endpoint, and the results also 
favoured the nivo+chemo arm although data were still immature at the time of the primary analysis. 
For the later DBL of 14-Oct-2022, a HR point estimate of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.91) was observed and 
median EFS2 was not reached in either arm. 
A first IA of OS (secondary endpoint) was planned at approximately 101 events but it was performed 
with 94 events (50.8% information fraction). A positive trend in OS was observed: HR=0.57 (99.67% 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 104/149 
 
 
 
CI: 0.30, 1.07); stratified log-rank test p-value = 0.0079 (p <0.0033 needed for statistical 
significance) and median OS not reached in either arm. Although a high number of subjects were 
censored: 80.4% and 67.0% in the nivo+chemo and chemo arm, respectively, and data are indeed 
immature, the reported results appear promising. Some imbalances in the reported benefit are 
observed in the submitted subgroup analyses, for example for race or region but the low number of 
events in each subgroup prevents any conclusion. By PD-L1 tumour expression, the OS HR was 0.71 
(95% CI; 0.40, 1.27) in the PD-L1 <1% and 0.39 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.77) in the PD-L1 ≥1% subgroup. 
According to disease stage, results appear consistent, with a HR of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.29, 1.23) and of 
0.56 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.93) for stage IB/II and for stage IIIA, respectively, but, as said, immature with 
few events, high degree of censoring and wide CIs. Results from OS IA2 (performed at 60.0% 
information fraction) also showed a positive trend although they did not reach statistical significance (p 
<0.0066 needed). HR point estimate was 0.62 (99.34% CI: 0.36, 1.05; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.90); stratified 
log-rank test p-value = 0.0124. Subgroup analyses were provided and they were consistent with the 
previous ones. 
The Final OS analysis from study CA209816 should be provided by June 2025 (see an Annex II 
condition) as a post authorisation efficacy study (PAES) imposed in accordance with the Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) No 357/2014 to provide further data on the impact of nivolumab on OS in 
the intended indication. 
Based on the available data, it is confirmed that the benefit of the nivo+chemo combination for NSCLC 
neoadjuvant treatment is greater for subjects with a PD-L1 tumour expression ≥1%, in comparison 
with tumours presenting a PD-L1 expression <1%. It is acknowledged that study CA209816 was only 
powered to show statistical significance of EFS and pCR between nivo+chemo and chemo in the overall 
population, with the study not adequately sized to draw definitive conclusions on specific subgroups. 
NSCLC neoadjuvant setting is an unexplored setting regarding the correlation between PD-L1 
expression and the (long-term) efficacy of an anti-PD(L)1 product but there is no reason to believe it 
might be different from the adjuvant and advanced/metastatic settings. Even though decisions based 
on subgroup analyses can be controversial, the efficacy of the proposed combination in the ITT 
population is driven by the efficacy in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1% and uncertainty remains 
regarding treatment benefit in patients with PD-L1 expression <1% that prevents granting an 
indication in a PD-L1 unselected patient population in this setting. 
Wording of the indication 
An indication wording referring to (high) risk of recurrence of patients with resectable NSCLC is 
considered more appropriate to guide prescribers in the proposed neoadjuvant NSCLC setting, in view 
of the complexity of issuing an indication statement based on staging considering the revisions of the 
AJJCC/UICC TNM system (i.e. change from 7th to 8th edition), and also in line with previous decisions 
made by CHMP for similar (combination) treatments in the (neo)-adjuvant NSCLC setting. A cross-
reference to section 5.1 is included where specific selection criteria corresponding to the patient 
population included in the clinical trial and deriving benefit from the proposed neoadjuvant treatment 
are detailed. As homogeneity of response cannot be assumed across disease stages and very limited 
evidence is available in subjects with disease stage IB, hampering any sound decision with regards to 
benefit of the proposed combination, these patients were excluded from the indication. In addition, as 
discussed, a broad indication regardless of PD-L1 expression is not justified. For these reasons, the 
finally granted indication for the proposed combination is restricted to subjects with disease stage II-
IIIA and PD-L1 tumour cell expression ≥1%. 
Participants with ‘known’ EGFR mutations or ALK translocation were excluded from the study per 
protocol. However, information on EGFR or ALK testing was not centrally collected and, therefore, the 
actual number of patients with a negative result for tested EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements and 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 105/149 
 
 
 
the number of subjects who were never tested is unknown. Overall data on the response of oncogene-
addicted tumours to PD1/PD-L1 targeting agents are limited, and the extent to which drivers like EGFR 
or ALK impact response is not well characterised. Although testing for certain oncogene biomarkers is 
considered standard-of-care in the advanced NSCLC setting, it is presently not routine clinical practice 
to test patients with early-stage operable disease for these biomarkers (e.g. 2021 ESMO early-stage 
NSCLC guidelines eUpdate; Lovely et al. N Engl J Med. 2022). Consequently, there has not been a 
consensus regarding mandatory testing for these and other oncogene drivers before recruitment in 
trials in this early-stage setting, and, in many cases, patients have been included regardless their 
tumour’s mutational status. 
In study CA209816 the treatment effect cannot be explored/isolated in patients harbouring these 
mutations, as the number of subjects with oncogene-addicted tumours enrolled is not known. 
Considering all the above, and despite uncertainty regarding the treatment effect in patients with these 
actionable mutations (as well as others for which no specific exclusion criteria were part of the 
protocol), it is considered a reasonable approach not to exclude them from the therapeutic indication 
(section 4.1 of the SmPC), but rather to reflect the relevant inclusion/exclusion criteria in section 5.1, 
in the absence of dedicated studies.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from a pre-planned interim analysis of study CA209816 showed a statistically significant 
improvement in both pCR and EFS primary endpoints for nivo+chemo compared to chemotherapy as 
neoadjuvant treatment of NSCLC. Updated efficacy results, with longer follow-up, confirmed the 
previously obtained results. A positive trend in OS has also been observed, in the two interim analyses 
conducted, which is considered encouraging albeit results are still immature. Updated OS data are 
expected post approval (Annex II). A highly heterogeneous population was enrolled in this (small) 
study, including patients with stage IB/II tumours with a better disease prognosis and who according 
to current clinical guidelines are generally not candidates to neoadjuvant treatment. This is a limitation 
of the trial. The reported benefit appears higher in patients with stage IIIA disease, while the stage IB 
population is so poorly represented that efficacy cannot be inferred from the results of this study. In 
addition, an EFS benefit is not established in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 expression <1%, 
since the positive results for EFS, OS and the other relevant endpoints reported with the combination 
appear to be mainly driven by the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 tumour expression ≥1%, 
questioning whether the proposed neoadjuvant treatment with nivolumab will lead to long term benefit 
in the PD-L1 <1% population.  
Based on all these observations, the finally granted indication for the proposed combination is 
restricted to subjects with disease stage II-IIIA and PD-L1 tumour cell expression ≥1%. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Post authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further characterize the efficacy of nivolumab as 
neoadjuvant treatment of adults with non-small cell lung cancer, the MAH should submit the OS data 
from the final OS analysis of the Phase 3 study CA209816.

Dose Delay, Dose Reductions, Infusion Interruptions, and Infusion Rate Reductions of Study 
Therapy 
Dose delays (all agents) and dose reductions (chemo-agents only) were observed across treatment arms 
for  treated  subjects  concurrently  randomized  to  the  nivo+chemo  and  chemo  arms.  Infusions 
interruptions  or  infusion  rate  reductions  were  infrequent.  There  was  a  higher  proportion  of  dose 
omissions with gemcitabine and vinorelbine, which are administered twice per cycle. 
Dose delays of study drug (proportion of subjects with at least 1 dose delay) were reported as follows: 
•  Nivo+chemo:  25.0%  for  nivolumab,  13.7%  for  carboplatin,  22.8%  for  cisplatin,  42.4%  for 
gemcitabine, 17.9% for paclitaxel, and 18.1% for pemetrexed 
•  Chemo: 16.7% for carboplatin, 30.8% for cisplatin, 20.7% for docetaxel, 44.9% for gemcitabine, 
9.1% for paclitaxel, 30.2% for pemetrexed, and 71.4% for vinorelbine  
In both the concurrently randomized nivo+chemo and chemo arms, the most common cause of dose 
delay for nivolumab and chemotherapy was AE, and the most frequent AEs leading to dose delay tended 
to be known toxicities of chemotherapy. 
Dose  reductions  were  not  permitted  with  nivolumab  treatment,  but  they  were  permitted  with 
chemotherapy. Dose reductions of chemotherapy (proportion of subjects with at least 1 dose reduction) 
were reported as follows: 
•  Nivo+chemo:  21.6%  for  carboplatin,  10.3%  for  cisplatin,  18.2%  for  gemcitabine,  14.3%  for

paclitaxel, and 1.2% for pemetrexed  
•  Chemo: 31.0% for carboplatin, 11.9% for cisplatin, 17.2% for docetaxel, 16.3% for gemcitabine, 
31.8% for paclitaxel, 4.8% for pemetrexed, and 7.1% for vinorelbine 
Among  all  treated  subjects  in  concurrently  randomized  nivo+chemo  and  chemo  arms,  the  most 
frequently reported drug-related AEs of any grade leading to dose delay or reduction were as follows: 
•  Nivo+chemo: neutrophil count decreased (9.1%), neutropenia (6.8%), anemia (4.5%) 
•  Chemo: neutrophil count decreased (12.5%), neutropenia (8.5%), anemia (4.5%) 
Infusion interruptions: 
•  Nivo+chemo:  2.8%  for  nivolumab,  0%  for  carboplatin,  0.7%  for  cisplatin,  1.5%  for  gemcitabine, 
14.3% for paclitaxel, and 0% for pemetrexed  
•  Chemo: 2.4% for carboplatin, 0.7% for cisplatin, 3.4% for docetaxel, 2.0% for gemcitabine, 18.2% 
for paclitaxel, 0% for pemetrexed, and 0% for vinorelbine 
Infusion rate reductions were reported as follows: 
•  Nivo+chemo: 1.7% for nivolumab, 3.0% for gemcitabine, 1.5% for cisplatin, and 0% for carboplatin, 
paclitaxel, and pemetrexed 
•  Chemo:  1.4%  for  cisplatin,  4.1%  for  gemcitabine,  7.1%  for  vinorelbine,  and  0%  for  carboplatin, 
docetaxel, paclitaxel, and pemetrexed 
Dose omissions of study drug (proportion of subjects with at least 1 dose omission): 
•  Nivo+chemo: 2.8% for nivolumab, 2.0% for carboplatin, 3.7% for cisplatin, 27.3% for gemcitabine, 
3.6% for paclitaxel, and 2.4% for pemetrexed  
•  Chemo: 2.4% for carboplatin, 4.2% for cisplatin, 0% for docetaxel, 16.3% for gemcitabine, 0% for 
paclitaxel, 4.8% for pemetrexed, and 50.0% for vinorelbine

fatigue and neutropenia (16.5% each) 
•  Chemo: nausea (44.9%), constipation (32.4%), anemia (26.7%), decreased appetite (23.3%), and 
neutrophil count decreased (21.0%) 
Grade 3-4 AEs (all-causality) were reported in 72 (40.9%) and 77 (43.8%) subjects in the concurrently 
randomized nivo+chemo and chemo arms, respectively. 
The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 AEs (all-causality) were as follows: 
•  Nivo+chemo:  neutropenia  (9.1%),  neutrophil  count  decreased  (7.4%),  anemia  (4.0%),  platelet 
count decreased (2.3%), and white blood cell count decreased (1.7%) 
•  Chemo: neutropenia (11.9%), neutrophil count decreased (10.8%), anemia (5.1%), white blood cell 
count decreased (3.4%), decreased appetite and diarrhea (2.3% each)

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events  
Among treated subjects concurrently randomized to the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, the types and 
frequencies  of  all-causality  and  drug-related  SAEs  were  similar  between  the  nivo+chemo  and  chemo 
arms. 
Any-grade SAEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 30 (17.0%) and 24 (13.6%) subjects in 
the concurrently randomized nivo+chemo and chemo arms, respectively. Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported 
in 19 (10.8%) subjects in the nivo+chemo arm and 17 (9.7%) subjects in the chemo arm. The most 
commonly reported any-grade SAEs (all-causality) were: 
•  Nivo+chemo: vomiting and pneumonia (2.3% each), embolism and febrile neutropenia (1.1% each) 
•  Chemo: febrile neutropenia (2.8%), pneumonia (1.7%), neutropenia and diarrhea (1.1% each) 
Any-grade  drug-related  SAEs  were  reported  in  21  (11.9%)  and  18  (10.2%)  subjects  in  the 
concurrently randomized nivo+chemo and chemo arms, respectively. Grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs were 
reported in 15 (8.5%) subjects in the nivo+chemo arm and 14 (8.0%) subjects in the chemo arm. The 
most commonly reported any-grade drug-related SAEs were: 
•  Nivo+chemo: vomiting (2.3%) and febrile neutropenia (1.1%) 
•  Chemo: febrile neutropenia (2.8%), and pneumonia, neutropenia, and diarrhea (1.1% each)

Among all treated subjects in the concurrently randomized nivo+chemo and chemo arms, the majority 
of select AEs were Grade 1 - 2 and most were considered drug-related by the investigator. 
• 
The most frequently reported drug-related select AE categories (any-grade) were as follows: 
-  Nivo+chemo: skin (22.2%), and hepatic and renal (7.4% each) 
-  Chemo: gastrointestinal (11.9%), hepatic (10.8%), and renal (10.2%) 
with nivo+chemo, there were only 2 subjects (1.1%) experiencing select pulmonary events; these AEs 
were both Grade 1-2 and resolved. 
• 
The most frequently reported drug-related select AEs by PT (any-grade) were as follows: 
-  Nivo+chemo: rash (13.1%), blood creatinine increased (6.8%), and diarrhea (5.7%) 
-  Chemo: diarrhea (11.4%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (8.0%), and blood creatinine 
increased (6.3%) 
•  Drug-related serious select AEs in the concurrently randomized nivo+chemo and chemo arms were 
infrequent, with all PTs reported in single subjects except for diarrhea (2 subjects; 1.1%) in the 
chemo arm. 
•  Across the select AE categories, the majority of drug-related select AEs in the nivo+chemo arm 
were manageable using the established algorithms, with resolution occurring when immune-
modulating medications (systemic or topical corticosteroids) were administered. 
•  Across the select AE categories, the majority of drug-related select AEs resolved (ranging from 
70% to 100% across categories) at the time of DBL. In the nivo+chemo arm, only 9 subjects with 
drug-related select AEs in the endocrine, renal, and skin categories (3 subjects each) were not 
considered to be resolved at time of DBL.

Immune-mediated AEs 
Among all treated subjects in the concurrently randomized nivo+chemo and chemo arms: 
• 
The majority of IMAEs were Grade 1-2, and the most frequently reported IMAEs (any-grade, by 
category) were as follows: 
-  Nivo+chemo: rash (8.5%), hyperthyroidism (4.0%), and hypothyroidism/ thyroiditis (2.3%) 
-  Chemo: pneumonitis and rash (0.6% each) 
•  Across IMAE categories, the majority of events were manageable using the established 
management algorithms, with resolution occurring when IMMs (mostly systemic corticosteroids) 
were administered. Some endocrine IMAEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing 
need for hormone replacement therapy. Across all IMAE categories, only 4 subjects had IMAEs that 
were not known to be resolved at time of DBL.  
Other Events of Special Interest 
Among all treated subjects concurrently randomized to the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, no OESIs

Table 63: All causality Adverse Events Leading to Cancellation of Surgery by Worst CTC Grade (Any 
Grade, Grade 3-4, Grade 5) - All Treated Subjects in Concurrently Randomized Arms C (Nivo+Chemo) 
and B (Chemo) - Study CA209816 
Adverse drug reactions 
Pooled safety data from CA209816, CA209648 and CA209649 were used to summarize the safety 
profile of nivo+chemo for Section 4.8 of SmPC, ie, the tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
(nivo+chemo column) as well as the description of select irARs.  
Adverse Reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC 
Based on the EU guidance document “A guideline on summary of product characteristics (SmPC) 
September 2009” and EMA guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man 
(EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5), the following methodology was used to generate the adverse reactions 
with nivolumab + chemotherapy for section 4.8 of the SmPC: 
1.  Pool all-causality AE data from CA209816 (neoadjuvant resectable NSCLC), CA209649 
(GC/GEJC/OAC), and CA209648 (OSCC) for the nivo+chemo regimen. 
2.  Programmatically remap MedDRA PTs representing the same or similar clinical conditions and 
generate summary tables using the MedDRA version for the most recent study.  
3.  Identify clinically relevant events based on BMS medical review of the all-causality re-mapped 
AE summary table. 
4.  Present resulting clinically relevant re-mapped events by SOC and all-causality frequency in 
the final adverse drug reaction (ADR) table. 
5.  To calculate the frequencies of laboratory ADR, BMS used the laboratory abnormality change 
from baseline tables for CA209816 pooled with CA209649 and CA209648.  
For the proposed Opdivo SmPC, selection of specific adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC was 
based on clinical relevance as determined by the BMS medical reviewer.

The frequencies of selected irARs are based on all drug-related selected irARs (ie, drug-related select 
AEs, as reported by investigators) in the pooled nivo+chemo dataset (CA209816 [updated data] + 
CA209649 + CA209648) as irARs are characterized by their immune-mediated nature and relationship 
to the immuno-modulatory mechanism of action of nivolumab.

Grade 2, Grade 3 and Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.6% (8/1268), 0.2% (2/1268) and 
<0.1% (1/1268) of patients, respectively. Diabetes mellitus including Type 1 diabetes mellitus and 
fulminant Type 1 diabetes mellitus (2 Grade 2, 2 Grade 3 and 1 Grade 4), and diabetic ketoacidosis 
(1 Grade 4) were reported. Median time to onset of these endocrinopathies was 13.0 weeks (range: 
2.0-124.3). Resolution occurred in 63 patients (40.9%). Time to resolution ranged from 0.4 to 
221.6+ weeks. 
The incidence of rash was 24.1% (306/1268). Grade 2 and Grade 3 cases were reported in 6.4% 
(81/1268), and 2.4% (31/1268) of patients, respectively. Median time to onset was 6.6 weeks (range:

a  In 1 subject in the nivo+chemo arm, the type of platinum chemotherapy administered was not reported, as the 
subject never received platinum chemotherapy and the subject had a hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel leading 
to study drug discontinuation at Cycle 1 (refer to Appendix 4.1 [dosing listing] and Appendix 6.1.2.1 [AEs leading 
to DC listing] of the CA209816 Primary CSR). 
b  Per  protocol,  any  cisplatin-related  decrease  in  creatinine  clearance  to  <  50  mL/min  (using  the  Cockroft  Gault 
formula)  requires  discontinuation  of  cisplatin.  The  other  chemotherapeutic  agent  could  be  continued,  and  the 
platinum agent could be switched to carboplatin 
MedDRA v24.0; CTC v4.0. All events are within 30 days of the last dose of neoadjuvant study therapy.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new data has been provided by the MAH regarding drug-drug interactions or other interactions. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity has not been evaluated in Study CA209816. A descriptive summary of nivo ADA 
assessment has been presented side-by-side for subjects with 1L NSCLC who were treated with 
nivolumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg Q2W or 240mg Q2W, CA209026, and CA209227 Part 1 Arm A), and 
nivo+chemo (nivo 360 mg Q3W+chemo, CA209227 Part 1 Arm G and CA209227 Part 2 Arm H). 
Of 552 subjects with NSCLC who were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg or 240 mg Q2W and evaluable 
for the presence of ADA, 98 subjects (17.8%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA. Of those 
who were ADA positive, 3 subjects (0.5%) were persistent positive and neutralizing antibodies were 
detected in 5 subjects (0.9%). 
Of 449 subjects with NSCLC who were treated with first line nivolumab 360 mg Q3W in combination 
with 4 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy and evaluable for the presence of ADA, 60 subjects 
(13.4%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA. Of those who were ADA positive, 2 subjects 
(0.4%) were persistent positive and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 15 subjects (3.3%). The 
frequency of nivolumab ADA with nivo+chemo was consistent with that observed with nivolumab 
monotherapy (13.4% vs 17.8%, respectively).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to discontinuation included events where 1 or more drugs of a multi-drug regimen were 
discontinued, even if the subject remained on treatment. Among treated subjects concurrently 
randomized to the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, the types and frequencies of all-causality and drug-
related AEs leading to discontinuation of at least 1 study drug were similar between the arms. 
Any-grade AEs leading to discontinuation (regardless of causality) were reported in 18 (10.2%) 
and 20 (11.4%) subjects in the concurrently randomized nivo+chemo and chemo arms, respectively. 
Grade 3-4 AEs leading to discontinuation of at least 1 study drug were reported in 10 (5.7%) subjects 
in the nivo+chemo arm and 7 (4.0%) subjects in the chemo arm.  
The most frequently reported any-grade AEs leading to discontinuation (all-causality) were: 
•  Nivo+chemo: anaphylactic reaction (1.7%) and neutrophil count decreased and fatigue (1.1% 
each) 
•  Chemo: neutropenia (2.3%), and neutrophil count decreased, blood creatinine increased, and 
pneumonia (1.1% each) 
Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 18 (10.2%) and 17 (9.7%) subjects 
in the concurrently randomized nivo+chemo and chemo arms. Grade 3-4 AEs leading to 
discontinuation were reported in 10 (5.7%) subjects in the nivo+chemo arm and 6 (3.4%) subjects in 
the chemo arm. 
The most frequently reported any-grade drug-related AE leading to discontinuation were: 
•  Nivo+chemo: anaphylactic reaction (1.7%), fatigue and neutrophil count decreased (1.1% each) 
•  Chemo: neutropenia (2.3%), neutrophil count decreased, and blood creatinine increased (1.1% 
each)

Post marketing experience 
Postmarketing data for nivolumab are subject to continued active pharmacovigilance monitoring and 
are reported as per applicable post-marketing safety reporting requirements, as well as periodically to 
global health authorities. The review of the latest Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report  (PBRER) 
Number 11 (04-Jul-2020 to 03-Jul-2021) concluded on 24 February 2022.  
As of 03-Jul-2021, the global, cumulative patient exposure to nivolumab as monotherapy or 
combination therapy is estimated to be 767,256 subjects/patients. This is composed of patients in 
BMS- and ONO-sponsored clinical trials (42,580 subjects), early patient access programs (21,925 
patients), and post-marketing experience (702,751 patients). The cumulative nivolumab treatment 
duration to nivolumab is estimated to be 3,966,714 patient-months. Further to the review of the latest 
PBRER, the benefit-risk balance remains unchanged. No new safety concerns or change in benefits 
have been identified. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety assessment for the indication of neoadjuvant treatment of patients with Stage IB-IIIA 
resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is based on safety data from all 352 treated subjects 
receiving at least one dose of study drug who were concurrently randomized to nivo+chemo (N=176; 
Arm C) and chemo (N=176; Arm B) in the pivotal study, CA209816. These data are from the 20-Oct-
2021 database lock (DBL) of the CA209816 Primary CSR. 
Patient exposure - Minimum follow-up was 21.0 months and median follow-up was 29.5 months. 
Considering that nivolumab is intended for neoadjuvant treatment and that patients were to receive 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 135/149 
 
 
 
 
only 3 doses of treatment, these minimum and median follow-up are considered acceptable for an 
initial safety assessment. At the time of the DBL all treated subjects had discontinued neoadjuvant 
treatment for >18 months. This duration is also considered to be sufficient to characterize the safety 
profile of nivolumab in this setting. Most subjects had completed the course of neoadjuvant therapy 
(93.8% in the nivo+chemo arm, and 84.7% in the chemo arm). Reasons for not continuing 
neoadjuvant treatment were similar between both arms.  
The number of doses of nivolumab received in the nivo+chemo arm was 3 in 93.2% of patients, 
whereas for carboplatin and cisplatin was 3 in 70.6% and 84.6% of patients, respectively. This 
suggests that the addition of nivolumab did not have a negative impact on the number of doses 
received by patients and most patients could complete the neoadjuvant treatment course. 
Definitive surgery was conducted in a higher percentage of patients in the nivo+chemo arm than in the 
chemo arm (83.2% vs. 75.4%), and definitive cancellations were also reported in a lower percentage 
of patients in the nivo+chemo arm (15.6% vs. 20.7%). This suggests that the addition of nivolumab 
does not adversely affect the feasibility of the surgery and this is an important and reassuring point to 
take into account in the neoadjuvant setting. The reasons for cancellation were similar among arms, 
most of them due to disease progression or to “other” reasons, and only 2 patients (7.1%) in the 
nivo+chemo arm and 1 patient (2.7%) in the chemo arm cancelled due to adverse events. In both 
arms the most commonly reported “other” causes for surgery cancellation were subject’s refusal and 
tumour deemed unresectable by medical team. Regarding delayed surgeries, the percentage of 
patients in the nivo+chemo arm was slightly higher than in the chemo arm (20.8% vs. 17.8%), 
although most of the delays were due to administrative reasons or “other” reasons. The percentage of 
patients who underwent a surgery delay due to AEs was significantly lower in the nivo+chemo arm 
than in the chemo arm (19.4% vs. 37.5%).    
Per protocol, following definitive surgery, subjects could receive up to 4 cycles of adjuvant 
chemotherapy and/or radiation at the discretion of the investigator, following local recommendations. 
Considering only adjuvant systemic therapy, 14.8% of  subjects from the nivo+chemo arm and 25% 
from the chemo arm received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most patients received between 1 and 4 cycles 
of platinum doublet chemotherapy. Since patients with adjuvant therapy received more doses of 
chemotherapy, some imbalance on the long-term safety (in detriment of patients having received 
neoadjuvant + adjuvant therapy) cannot be discarded, although this may reflect current clinical 
practice. It should be noted that with the currently available evidence, it does not seem that patients 
who received adjuvant therapy had an unacceptable worse toxicity than patients who did not receive 
it. Regarding the percentage of subjects who received PORT/adjuvant radiotherapy, it does not seem 
either that the evidence so far available suggests an unacceptable toxicity of PORT/adjuvant 
radiotherapy on patients who have previously received nivolumab as neoadjuvant therapy. 
Regarding dose delays, dose reductions, dose infusion interruptions, infusion rate reductions and dose 
omissions, no relevant differences have been identified between both treatment arms or between the 
subgroups of patients who received different allowed chemotherapy schemes.  
No apparent differences were observed between arms regarding the length of delay, duration of 
surgery or length of hospital stay.    
Adverse events – Almost all patients reported an AE during study treatment: 92.6% of subjects in 
the nivo+chemo arm and 97.2% of subjects in the chemo arm. These percentages are similar, and 
even slightly lower in the nivo+chemo arm, which suggests that the addition of nivolumab does not 
significantly worsen the toxicity profile. Overall, the incidence of AEs in the nivo+chemo arm was 
similar or slightly lower in the nivo+chemo arm in comparison with the chemo arm, except for 
“fatigue”, which was reported in 16.5% of patients in the nivo+chemo arm vs. 12.5% in the chemo 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 136/149 
 
 
 
arm; and “rash”, which was reported in 13.6% in the nivo+chemo arm vs. 2.8% in the chemo arm. No 
significant differences were observed between the incidences or nature of AEs (regardless of causality) 
and drug-related AEs.    
SAE – Any-grade SAEs were reported in a higher percentage of patients in the nivo+chemo arm than 
in the chemo arm (17.0% vs. 13.6%), although G3-4 SAEs were reported with a similar frequency 
(10.8% vs. 9.7%). Overall the nature of the SAEs most frequently reported was similar in both arms, 
except for the frequency of SAEs belonging to “vascular disorders”, which was higher in the 
nivo+chemo arm than in the chemo arm (3.4% vs. 1.1%). Additionally, 2 patients (1.1%) from the 
nivo+chemo arm reported an embolism, whereas in the chemo arm there were no cases of embolism. 
In terms of drug-related SAEs, the incidences of both any-grade AEs and G3-4 SAEs were similar in 
both arms (11.9% vs. 10.2% for any-grade SAEs, and 8.5% vs. 8.0% for G3-4 SAEs). Although the 
incidence of all-causality any-grade SAEs was higher in the nivo+chemo arm than in the chemo arm, 
this increase is considered acceptable, taking into account that adding nivolumab to the backbone 
chemotherapy inevitably adds toxicity. Besides, G3-4 SAEs were reported with a similar frequency; 
and when the causality is established, the differences between arms are less marked than in the all-
causality any-grade SAEs.      
Deaths – Overall, fewer patients died in the nivo+chemo arm than in the chemo arm: 19.9% vs. 
33.5%. Of note, the number of patients who died within 100 days of last neoadjuvant dose was higher 
in the nivo+chemo arm than in the chemo arm: 5.1% vs. 2.3%.   
In line with the number of subjects who died in each arm, the incidence of subjects who died after 
surgery was lower in the nivo+chemo arm than in the chemo arm (15.4% vs. 26.7%). However, both 
the rate of deaths within 30 days of surgery and within 90 days of surgery was higher in the 
nivo+chemo arm than in the chemo arm: 2.7% (4 deaths, all attributed to “other”) vs. 0.7% (1 death, 
due to study drug toxicity) for deaths within 30 days; and 3.4% (5 deaths, all attributed to “other”) vs. 
1.5% (2 deaths, 1 due to study drug toxicity and 1 attributed to “other”) for deaths within 90 days. 
These rates are also in line with the number of subjects who died within 100 days of last neoadjuvant 
dose.  
As mentioned, the cause of death of 9 subjects in the nivo+chemo arm was attributed to “other”. The 
verbatim terms for those deaths were provided and could be considered as expected taking into 
account the population under study and the complications associated with major thoracic surgery. 
The cause of death of 2 subjects in the nivo+chemo arm was considered as “unknown”. These deaths 
occurred 379 and 193 days since last neoadjuvant dose, respectively, and therefore the implication of 
nivolumab on those deaths can be considered unlikely.  
More patients died in the chemo arm than in the nivo+chemo arm (35 (19.9%) patients in the 
nivo+chemo arm vs. 59 (33.5%) in the chemo arm). However, both the number of patients who died 
within 30 and within 100 days of last neoadjuvant dose was higher in the nivo+chemo arm than in the 
chemo arm. It was confirmed that the higher rate of deaths reported in the chemo arm was mainly due 
to the contribution of deaths in the chemo arm after these 100 days after the last neoadjuvant dose, 
and due to disease progression.      
Other significant events – The most frequently reported drug-related select AE categories in the 
nivo+chemo arm was “skin” (22.2%; “rash” accounting for 13.1%), followed by “hepatic” and “renal” 
(7.4% each). It should be noted that “rash” and other skin disorders are well-known AEs of nivolumab. 
In the chemo arm “gastrointestinal” was reported in 11.9% (“diarrhoea” accounting for 11.4%), 
followed by “hepatic” (10.8%) and “renal” (10.2%). The majority of drug-related select AEs had 
resolved at time of DBL. However, some drug-related select AEs in the “endocrine”, “renal” and “skin” 
categories were still considered as unresolved at the time of DBL. It is well-known that patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 137/149 
 
 
 
endocrine AEs take long time to recover (median time to resolution: 10.50 weeks, according to the 
data submitted by the MAH) or even need supplementary treatment in the long-term, therefore it is 
not surprising that patients suffering from AEs of this category had not recovered by DBL.  
Regarding immune-mediated AEs, in the nivo+chemo arm “rash” was the most frequently reported 
IMAE (8.5%), followed by “hyperthyroidism” (4.0%) and “hypothyroidism/thyroiditis” (2.3%). As 
expected, IMAEs were reported with a significantly lower frequency in the chemo arm than in the 
nivo+chemo arm. It should be noted that all “rash” cases were considered as resolved by time of DBL. 
On the contrary, only 50% of patients reporting “hypothyroidism/thyroiditis” and “diabetes mellitus” 
were considered as recovered by time of DBL, and the MAH states that 4 patients across all categories 
had IMAEs that were not resolved by DBL. With the information available so far, which includes an 
update from the MAH (DBL 14-Oct-2022), there is no evidence suggesting a worse trend regarding the 
recovery from these events in this indication than in the approved ones. Besides, the percentage of 
patients not yet recovered is considered as acceptable in this therapeutic context. Considering the 
nature of the events that were not considered as recovered at the moment of this update (notably 
endocrine events), it is expected that most of these patients will not recover soon.  
Concerning surgical complications, 41.6% of patients in the nivo+chemo arm reported an event of any 
grade identified as a surgical complication vs. 46.7% in the chemo arm; and 11.4% reported a G3-4 
event in the nivo+chemo arm vs. 14.8% in the chemo arm. Overall these percentages are similar, and 
even slightly lower in the nivo+chemo arm. Of note, in the nivo+chemo arm there were 2 G5 events 
(“pulmonary embolism” and “aortic rupture”) but they were not considered as related to the treatment 
by the investigator. AEs belonging to “Injury, poisoning and procedural complications” SOC were 
reported with a higher frequency in the nivo+chemo arm (18.1% for any-grade AEs; 2.7% for G3-4 
AEs) than in the chemo arm (14.8% for any-grade AEs; 0.7% for G3-4 AEs). On the other hand, any-
grade AEs belonging to “General disorders and administration site conditions” were reported with a 
significant lower frequency in the nivo+chemo arm than in the chemo arm: 10.1% vs. 21.5%.  
Overall, fewer patients had an AE leading to delay of surgery in the nivo+chemo arm than in the 
chemo arm: 3.4% vs. 5.1% for the any-grade AEs, and 1.1% vs. 2.3% for the G3-4 AEs. No G5 AEs 
were reported in any arm, and no particular trend is observed across the nature of AEs which led to 
delay of surgery. 2 patients (1.1%) in the nivo+chemo arm reported an AE leading to cancellation of 
surgery vs. 1 patient (0.6%) in the chemo arm. The PTs for these AEs were “tuberculosis” and 
“ischaemic stroke” in the nivo+chemo arm, and “blood creatinine increased” in the chemo arm. Both 
the percentages of AEs leading to delay of surgery and AEs leading to cancellation of surgery are 
considered low and somehow expected due to the nature of the underlying disease.        
Discontinuation due to adverse events – Any-grade AEs leading to discontinuation were reported 
with a similar frequency in both arms: 10.2% in the nivo+chemo arm vs. 11.4% in the chemo arm. 
G3-4 AEs leading to discontinuation were also reported with a similar frequency, although it was 
slightly higher in the nivo+chemo arm: 5.7% vs. 4.0%. The most common AE leading to 
discontinuation in the nivo+chemo arm was anaphylactic reaction (1.7%) and in the chemo arm it was 
neutropenia (2.3%). These rates remained similar after establishing the causality, although also 
slightly higher in the nivo+chemo arm: drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 
10.2% in the nivo+chemo arm vs. 9.7% in the chemo arm. Drug-related G3-4 AEs leading to 
discontinuation were reported in 5.7% of patients in the nivo+chemo arm, vs. in 3.4% in the chemo 
arm. The nature of the drug-related AEs did not differ from the nature of AEs regardless of causality. 
Although these rates are slightly higher in the nivo+chemo arm they are considered acceptable, taking 
into account that the addition of nivolumab to the chemotherapy backbone inevitably adds toxicity, 
and the observed increase remains within acceptable limits.

Laboratory findings – Laboratory abnormalities were mainly G1-2 in severity in both arms, with 
“haemoglobin” the parameter for which most alterations were reported followed by “absolute 
neutrophil count” and by “leukocytes”. The incidences in both arms were overall similar and no 
particular differences were observed in terms of frequencies. G3-4 events were overall reported with a 
low frequency, except for “absolute neutrophil count”, which was reported in 21.8% of subjects in the 
nivo+chemo arm vs. 26.6% in the chemo arm. In the nivo+chemo arm, no patients had concurrent 
ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with total bilirubin 2 x ULN within 1 day and within 30 days of last dose of study 
therapy, whereas in the chemo arm this was reported in 1 patient. As expected, considering the 
already known safety profile of nivolumab, thyroid function alterations were most frequently reported 
in the nivo+chemo arm than in the chemo arm: 3.0% patients reported TSH increases (> ULN) from 
baseline (≤ ULN) in the nivo+chemo arm, vs. no patients in the chemo arm. Decreases (< lower limit 
of normal [LLN]) from baseline (≥ LLN) were reported in 19 (11.4%) subjects in the nivo+chemo arm 
and 1 (2.9%) subject in the chemo arm. Regarding pancreas alterations, G3-4 events of increased 
lipase and increased amylase were reported with a higher incidence in the nivo+chemo arm (6.5% and 
3.6%) vs. the chemo arm (3.6% and 1.8%). Lipase and amylase increases were also reported in the 
phase 2 study NADIM, where increased lipase was among the most common treatment-related Grade 
3 events (7%) and both are included in section 4.8 of Opdivo SmPC. However, no cases of pancreatitis 
were observed. G3-4 increases in glucose were also higher in the nivo+chemo arm than in the chemo 
arm: 5.5% vs. 2.9%.    
Vital signs observations performed prior to each treatment dose were not recorded in the clinical 
database. Vital signs observed as part of the physical examination within 72 hours prior to each dose 
were reported in the CRF and any clinically relevant safety event related to those observations was 
reported as an AE. AEs that could be related to vital signs alterations have been reviewed: all included 
AEs were mild and only some cases of Grade 3 febrile neutropenia, hypertension and dyspnea were 
reported. The most common AE was pyrexia in both arms. 
Safety in special populations - The MAH presented data by age, sex, race and region, but overall, 
no significant findings were identified in these analyses. 
Regarding safety by type of platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin), in both arms the 
incidence of G3-4 AEs was higher with carboplatin than with cisplatin. It does not seem that the 
addition of nivolumab impacts on the incidence of all-causality or drug-related AEs.  In addition, the 
MAH has provided safety data by randomization period and no apparent differences have been 
identified. 
The MAH has provided subgroup analysis by PD-L1 expression and by disease stage. Overall, it does 
not seem that there are relevant safety differences among subgroups. Nevertheless, it is difficult to 
draw any firm conclusion due to the small size of the database.  
Immunogenicity has not been evaluated in Study CA209816. According to the MAH, the nivolumab 
ADA incidence rate is expected to be low in this setting and similar to monotherapy in 1L metastatic 
NSCLC. In addition, the fact that patients will only receive 3 treatment cycles reduces the risk. 
However, the Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of therapeutic proteins 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1) states that testing of immunogenicity should be included in all 
pivotal clinical pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy trials of a biological medicinal 
product targeting patient populations that have not been exposed to the product previously. Since IMG 
samples were not collected in study CA209816, an immunogenicity assessment is not possible. The 
MAH is recommended to perform an immunogenicity evaluation based on IMG samples from studies 
CA20977T and CA20973L, two ongoing trials that include patients with early-stage NSCLC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 139/149 
 
 
 
Regarding the safety information included in section 4.8 of the SmPC, the MAH has pooled the results 
from study CA209816 with the already included results from studies CA209648 and CA209649. 
Although it is acknowledged that populations differ and some incidences have been decreased as a 
result of the pooling strategy, this approach is considered acceptable. The nivolumab in combination 
with chemotherapy for NSCLC neoadjuvant treatment safety profile is considered to be adequately 
represented by the proposed pool and the identified differences are not enough relevant to grant a 
separated subsection in 4.8 of the SmPC. 
As noted in section 2.3.1 above, a GCP deviation in two China sites was identified by the MAH. 
Multiple potential adverse events (AEs, all non-serious) and concomitant medications documented in 
medical notes across all study arms were not entered into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. 
Following complete source data review, sites entered the missing data into the EDC and preliminary 
assessment of the newly entered safety information was performed in July 2022. Overall, the newly 
entered AEs were consistent with the known safety profiles observed with nivo+chemo and chemo in 
the study, and are distributed evenly across those arms. There were no new serious adverse events 
(SAEs) or AEs leading to dose modification. A CSR addendum containing updated safety data, which 
includes also these additional AEs from China subjects, was submitted as part of the responses to the 
second RSI. 
Updated safety data – Addendum 01 to the Primary CSR (14-Oct-2022 Database Lock) 
Updated safety data provided by the MAH in Addendum 01 to the Primary CSR (DCO 14-Oct-2022) 
was consistent with the safety data provided in the DCO-1 (20-Oct-2021) (data not shown). Of note, 
all subjects had completed treatment at least 2 years before the IA2 database lock.   
There continued to be no deaths due to study drug toxicity in the nivo+chemo arm. Some additional 
deaths were reported in both arms, but most of them were due to the disease and were reported with 
a similar frequency in both arms.  
There were not any new SAEs reported, nor any new AE leading to discontinuation. No new AEs 
leading to delay or cancellation of surgery were reported either.  
Regarding AEs, there were slight differences between both DCOs: any grade AEs were reported in the 
nivo+chemo arm in 92.6% of patients in the DCO-1, vs. in 93.8% of patients in the DCO-2. Regarding 
G3-4 AEs in the nivo+chemo arm, 40.9% of patients reported any G3-4 events in the DCO-1, vs. 
43.2% in the DCO-2. The differences between both DCOs in terms of PTs were only 1 new AE in most 
cases, except for “neutropenia”, for which the difference was 2 new AEs in the nivo+chemo arm for the 
any-grade AEs (15.9% in the DCO-1 vs. 17.0% in the DCO-2) and 4 new AEs in the nivo+chemo arm 
for the G3-4 events (8.5% in the DCO-1 vs. 10.8% in the DCO-2).  
All-causality select AEs were reported with a very similar frequency in both DCOs. There was only a 
slight increase (1 additional select AE) in the hepatic select AEs and the renal select AEs. Regarding 
drug-related select AEs there was only a slight increase (1 additional select AE) in the hepatic category 
and in the hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category.  
All-causality IMAEs within 100 days of last dose remained also pretty similar between both DCOs. 
Indeed, the IMAEs belonging to the “hypersensitivity/infusion reactions” reported in DCO-2 were lower 
than in DCO-1: 2 IMAEs (1.1%) in DCO-1 vs. 1 IMAE (0.6%) in DCO-2. Regarding all-causality 
endocrine IMAEs within 100 days of last dose, the percentages between both DCOs remained the same 
except for the case of “hypothyroidism/thyroiditis”, for which 1 additional IMAE was reported (4 
(2.3%) in DCO-1 vs. 5 (2.8%) in DCO-2).   
The MAH review of post-marketing safety data is consistent with, and confirms the clinical trial safety 
data for nivolumab. The safety profile of nivolumab in the post-marketing setting supports the 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 140/149 
 
 
 
favourable benefit-risk profile of nivolumab established during clinical trials.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The addition of nivolumab to the chemotherapy in the context of this neoadjuvant setting does not 
seem to translate into a significantly worse toxicity profile. Indeed, the number of AEs, SAEs and AEs 
leading to discontinuation remain overall similar between treatment arms and no major differences 
have been identified. Importantly, the addition of nivolumab did not lead to an increase in the number 
of surgery delays, surgery cancellations or surgical complications.  
The nature of AEs is reflective of the known safety profile of nivolumab and chemotherapy and no new 
safety issues were identified. As expected, slight increases in the immune-mediated AEs in the

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
OPDIVO in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the neoadjuvant treatment 
of resectable non-small cell lung cancer at high risk of recurrence in adult patients whose tumours 
have PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% (see section 5.1 for selection criteria). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment options for patients with newly-diagnosed non-metastatic NSCLC depend on tumour 
resectability and patient operability. Key considerations include tumour characteristics and location, 
extent of nodal involvement, lung function, patient age and comorbidities. 
Treatment guidelines (ESMO, NCCN, ASCO) state that patients with resected stage II-IIIA tumours 
should receive adjuvant chemotherapy. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage IB tumours is not 
clear and should be decided on individual basis and depending on the size of the tumour among other 
factors. For stage III tumours that are considered resectable but not operable at first, neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy is recommended. Between 2 and 4 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy are the 
standard course of treatment in those cases. Cisplatin combined with vinorelbine (non-squamous) or 
gemcitabine (squamous histology) are the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens in this 
setting. There are no other agents approved for NSCLC neoadjuvant treatment. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current application is based on the results from the first interim analysis of Study CA209816. This 
is a phase 3, randomized, open-label study of nivolumab combined with different platinum-based 
chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of stage IB-IIIA NSCLC in the neoadjuvant setting. A total of 
773 patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 505 were randomized to receive either nivo+ipi 
(n=113), chemo (n=213) or nivo+chemo (n=179). The primary population for the efficacy analyses 
(n=358) is comprised by all subjects concurrently randomized to the nivo+chemo and chemo arm 
(n=179 each) who received three cycles of either nivolumab + platinum-based chemotherapy or 
platinum-based chemotherapy before definitive surgery. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The combination therapy of nivolumab+chemotherapy for the neoadjuvant treatment of stage IB-IIIA 
(AJCC 7th edition) NSCLC showed an improvement in event free survival (EFS) by BICR compared to 
chemotherapy [HR=0.63 (97.38% CI: 0.43, 0.91), p=0.0052, median EFS 31.57 vs. 20.80 months] in 
a prespecified first interim analysis. Nivo+chemo also demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in pCR rate per BIPR compared with chemo: 24.0% (43/179; 95% CI: 18.0, 31.0) vs. 
2.2% (4/179; 95% CI: 0.6, 5.6). Results from the EFS subgroup analyses by stratification factors were 
generally consistent with the main analysis and also favoured the nivo+chemo arm. In patients with 
stage II-IIIA disease and PD-L1 expression ≥1%, reported EFS per BICR (DBL 14-Oct-2022) showed a 
HR point estimate of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.76), with a median EFS not reached (95% CI: 44.42, NA) 
Assessment report  
EMA/287093/2023  
Page 144/149 
 
 
 
in the nivo+chemo group and 26.71 (95% CI: 13.40, NA) months in the chemo treatment group. 
Several sensitivity analyses for EFS also confirmed the reported main results. 
Regarding secondary endpoints, TTDM and MPR also favoured the nivo+chemo arm. EFS2 was also 
analysed as an exploratory endpoint and the results favoured the combination. 
Updated exploratory efficacy analyses were provided for the main endpoints which confirmed the 
previous findings. 
A first interim analysis of OS was performed (50.8% information fraction). A positive trend in OS has 
been observed: HR=0.57 (99.67% CI: 0.30, 1.07); stratified log-rank test p-value = 0.0079 (p 
<0.0033 needed for statistical significance). A second pre-planned OS IA was performed (60.0% 
information fraction) which also showed a positive trend but, again, it did not cross the prespecified 
boundary for statistical significance (p <0-0066). An OS HR point estimate of 0.62 (99.34% CI: 0.36, 
1.05; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.90); stratified log-rank test p-value = 0.0124, was reported. In patients with 
stage II-IIIA disease and PD-L1 expression ≥1%, an OS HR of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.83) (DBL 14-Oct-
2022) was reported.   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study CA209816 was originally designed to compare the combination of nivolumab+ipilimumab vs. 
chemotherapy and was subject to multiple amendments where a third arm of 
nivolumab+chemotherapy was added, randomization to the nivo+ipi arm was later closed and the 
efficacy analyses in terms of endpoints, population of analysis and statistical plan were also changed.  
Available OS results come from two pre-planned interim analyses. Even if data do not show evidence 
of a detriment, the reported results are considered still immature, and the MAH is requested to submit 
the final OS analysis of study CA209816 (see Annex II). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In Study CA209816, with a minimum follow-up of 21 months and a median follow-up of 29.5 months, 
92.6% of subjects in the nivo+chemo arm and 97.2% of subjects in the chemo arm reported any AEs 
during the study. The most frequently reported AEs, by SOC, belonged to “GI disorders” in both arms: 
58.0% vs. 70.5%. By PT, the most frequently reported events were the same in both arms: “nausea” 
(38.1% vs. 44.9%), “constipation” (33.5% vs. 32.4%) and “anaemia” (29.0% vs. 26.7%). 
Regarding G3-4 AEs, 40.9% of patients reported a G3-4 AE in the nivo+chemo arm vs. 43.8% in the 
chemo arm, being “neutropenia” the most commonly reported. 
Any-grade SAEs were reported in a higher percentage of patients in the nivo+chemo arm than in the 
chemo arm (17.0% vs. 13.6%). Overall the nature of the SAEs most frequently reported was similar in 
both arms, except for the frequency of SAEs belonging to “vascular disorders”, which was higher in the 
nivo+chemo arm than in the chemo arm (3.4% vs. 1.1%). 
For immune-mediated AEs, in the nivo+chemo arm “rash” was the most frequently reported IMAE 
(8.5%), followed by “hyperthyroidism” (4.0%) and “hypothyroidism/thyroiditis” (2.3%). 
Updated safety results with longer follow up confirmed the above findings (data not show).

Page 145/149 
 
 
 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Although the safety profile of nivo+chemo in the neoadjuvant setting does not seem too worrying, this 
could be related to the fact that subjects only received 3 treatment cycles.  
Immunogenicity has not been evaluated in Study CA209816 and the MAH will perform additional 
investigations to address this uncertainty (REC).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In study CA209816, administration of 3 cycles of nivolumab in combination with platinum-based 
chemotherapy for neoadjuvant treatment of NSCLC showed a statistically significant improvement in 
both pCR and EFS compared to chemotherapy in all concomitantly randomized patients. Secondary 
endpoints also favoured the combination arm. OS data are still immature but a positive trend has been 
observed for nivolumab + chemotherapy. Subjects with stage IB to IIIA tumours (by AJCC TNM 
staging 7th edition) irrespective of PD-L1 tumour expression were included in the study. According to 
the provided results, patients with stage IIIA tumours seem to derive more benefit from the proposed 
treatment intervention. Further, with regards to PD-L1 expression the reported positive results in the 
overall patient population are mainly driven by the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 tumour expression 
≥1% questioning whether the proposed neoadjuvant treatment with nivolumab would lead to long term 
benefit in the PD-L1 <1% population. 
With regards to safety, the addition of nivolumab to platinum-based chemotherapy resulted in an 
increased toxicity although the limited number of treatment cycles administered in this setting 
decreases the toxicity burden of the addition of nivolumab.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The MAH is applying for a broad indication (i.e. regardless of tumour cell PD-L1 expression) of 
nivolumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the neoadjuvant treatment of 
patients with resectable NSCLC at risk of recurrence (stage IB-IIIA; AJCC 7th edition) but the role of 
neoadjuvant treatment in stage IB and II is not fully established. Stage IB and II tumours have better 
prognosis than stage IIIA so there is a high heterogeneity in the population included in this study. A 
greater benefit seems apparent in patients with stage IIIA tumours while the stage IB population 
included in the study is so limited (n=18) that treatment efficacy cannot be inferred from the obtained 
results. This fact, combined with the added toxicity that nivolumab treatment may expose patients to, 
justify the exclusion of stage IB (per the AJCC-TNM 7th edition) tumours from the therapeutic 
indication. Further, the positive results reported with the combination are mainly driven by the 
subgroup of patients with PD-L1 tumour expression ≥1%, questioning whether the proposed 
neoadjuvant treatment with nivolumab would lead to long term benefit in the PD-L1 <1% population. 
Considering this, an unrestricted indication is not justified and the benefit-risk is considered positive 
for patients with disease stage II-IIIA (7th TNM edition) and PD-L1 tumour expression ≥1%.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Opdivo in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy is considered positive for 
the neoadjuvant treatment of resectable non-small cell lung cancer at high risk of recurrence in adult 
patients whose tumours have PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%.

Scientific advice 
The Applicant received Scientific Advice on the development of cefiderocol  to treat infections due to 
aerobic Gram-negative pathogens in patients with limited treatment options from the CHMP on 15 
December 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/3435/1/2016/PED/III) and 18 May 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/3435/2/2017/I and 
EMEA/H/SA/3435/1/FU/1/2017/II). 
The Scientific Advice pertained to the following quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects: 
• Rationale for the designation of the proposed starting materials for the commercial 
manufacture of the Drug Substance 
• The design of the juvenile rat studies to support administration in a paediatric population 
from premature infants  
• The Modelling & simulation approach used to provide age- and weight-based dosing 
recommendations for cefiderocol in children from birth and above 
• The design of the single dose PK, safety and tolerability studies in children from birth and 
above 
• The extrapolation of efficacy from adults to children based on modelling and simulation to 
demonstrate similar probability of target attainment (PTA) in paediatric subjects compared to 
adults 
• Acceptability of the limited clinical data package (consisting of interim report from the 
CREDIBLE-CR study, the final APEKs-cUTI trial results, data from six Phase 1 studies and 
PK/PD) to support a conditional MAA in adults

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Fetcroja is proposed by the Applicant to be indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic 
Gram-negative bacteria in adult patients with limited treatment options. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
The number of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria continues to increase and limits 
the utility of existing antibacterial agents. Data from the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) report more than 2 million cases of infection with resistant bacteria and at least 23,000 
associated deaths in the United States every year (CDC 2013). The European Centre for Disease 
Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimate that nearly 700,000 infections and 33,000 deaths in the EU 
and European Economic Area (EEA) in 2015 are a consequence of MDR bacterial infection (Cassini et 
al. 2019). The burden had increased since 2007, was highest among infants and the elderly and was 
highest in Italy and Greece. Carbapenem-resistance (CR) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella 
pneumoniae and Acinetobacter spp. contributed significantly to the number of estimated deaths (in 
total approximately 9,000 deaths) whereas the numbers of deaths estimated to be caused by 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 10/154 
 
 
 
 
infections caused by CR Escherichia coli was lower (~100) reflecting the lower incidence of CR in this 
species. In 2013 to 2014, the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and oxacillinase-48 (OXA-
48) was the most widely disseminated carbapenemases across Europe (Grundmann et al. 2017). 
Metallo-beta-lactamases such as New-Delhi metallo-betalactamase (NDM) and Verona integron-
encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) were detected to a lesser extent. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Multi drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative organisms such as CR P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and 
Enterobacteriaceae are important pathogens in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including 
pyelonephritis, complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) and hospital-acquired including ventilator-
associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) i.e. infections that are commonplace but can also be the cause of 
other types of infections such as wound and surgical site infections. Complicated UTIs are UTIs 
complicated by involvement of the upper urinary tract (pyelonephritis) or by underlying functional or 
anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract. Common uropathogens causing cUTI are E. coli, other 
Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. Complicated IAI is defined as the extension of an IAI beyond 
the organ of origin, causing peritonitis or abscess formation. Complicated IAIs are usually polymicrobial 
in nature and the major pathogens involved are usual residents of the gastrointestinal tract, including 
Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, and certain anaerobes (particularly Bacteroides fragilis) but P. 
aeruginosa is also commonly encountered. HAP and VAP are by definition infections in hospitalised (or 
recently hospitalised) patients. Colonisation of the respiratory tract with a variety of Gram-positive and 
Gram-negative bacteria may lead to infection. Among the most commonly encountered pathogens in 
HAP/VAP are Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Infections typically caused by Gram-negative organisms (cUTI, cIAI and HAP/VAP) are diagnosed 
based on clinical presentations and radiologic imaging in addition to microbiological investigations to 
characterise the pathogens causing the infections. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Beta-lactam antibacterial agents are commonly used to manage infections when they involve Gram-
negative pathogens. Increasing resistance to beta-lactams, including the carbapenems, has led to 
some organisms being effectively untreatable or treatable only with resource to colistin with or without 
other agents to which they remain at least partly susceptible. Treatment emergent nephrotoxicity is of 
concern for colistin. Fosfomycin is active against beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. However, 
clinical data on the treatment of MDR bacterial infections with fosfomycin are limited. Tigecycline is 
another option for the treatment of beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative infections. However, 
tigecycline is not active against Pseudomonas spp. Moreover, safety concerns of an increased risk of 
death with tigecycline have limited its use. Newer beta-lactam/beta-lactamase (BL/BLI) combinations 
such as ceftolozane/tazobactam (TOL/TAZ), ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI) and 
meropenem/vaborbactam (MEM/VAB) are possible options for the treatment of some carbapenem 
resistant Gram-negative organisms but none of them are universal or active against class B (metallo-
beta-lactamase) producers. Overall, there is still a high unmet medical need for additional antibacterial 
agents addressing carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative organisms.

About the product 
Fetcroja (cefiderocol) is a novel cephalosporin that like other β-lactam antibacterial agents inhibits 
bacterial cell-wall synthesis by targeting penicillin-binding proteins. Cefiderocol uptake differs from 
other β-lactams in that cefiderocol binds to ferric iron via its catechol moiety forming a chelating 
complex which allows cefiderocol to be actively transported into the periplasmic space through 
siderophore uptake systems. 
Fetcroja is proposed by the Applicant to be indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic 
Gram-negative bacteria  in adult patients with limited treatment options. 
The proposed posology in patients with normal renal function is 2 g q8h administered intravenously 
over 3 hours. Dosage adjustments are recommended in patients with renal impairment and in patients 
having augmented renal clearance. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the potential of cefiderocol to 
address an unmet medical need, as available data at that time point seemed to support activity of the 
product against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa expressing Ambler Class B and/or D enzymes. 
However, during assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, as it was clear at D90 that the number of outstanding issues could not have 
been reasonably addressed within an accelerated procedure.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product Fetcroja is presented as powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
containing 1 g of cefiderocol. The product contains the salt cefiderocol sulfate tosylate. 
Other ingredients are: sucrose, sodium chloride, and sodium hydroxide. 
The product is available in a 14 mL vial (Type I clear glass vial) with chlorobutyl elastomeric stopper 
and aluminum seal with a plastic flip-off cap, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance

Figure Q.1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of cefiderocol sulfate tosylate, comprising 3 molecules of cefiderocol, 4 
molecules of p- toluenesulfonic acid, and 1 molecule of sulfuric acid, has been confirmed by elemental 
analysis, mass spectrometry, IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectra and UV spectroscopy and X-ray powder 
diffraction (XRPD).  
A crystalline form, a pseudo-polymorph and an amorphous form have been identified. The solid-state 
properties of the active substance were measured by DSC and XRPD and confirm that the crystalline 
form has been manufactured throughout clinical development and commercial scale batches.  
Cefiderocol is a crystalline, light-sensitive, hygroscopic powder which is sensitive towards hydrolysis 
and slightly soluble in water.  
Cefiderocol has two chiral centres and is isolated as a single enantiomer (R,R).  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Cefiderocol tosilate sulfate is synthesized using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. The proposed starting materials were defined following the recommendations provided 
during a scientific advice 
For each stage, process schematic (structures, formulae, molecular weights and internal material 
codes), general process description and simple process narrative and lists of all materials and their 
stoichiometry, where relevant, are provided. Process parameters (PP), critical process parameters 
(CPPs,) in-process controls IPCs and their limits and overall yields are clearly defined in the narrative. 
During the assessment, the applicant provided a comprehensive approach to defining CPPs, including 
an assessment of the impact on all active substance critical quality attributes (CQAs) Adequate IPCs 
have been identified for each step. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, 
starting materials and reagents have been presented. In the initial application, numerous proven 
acceptable ranges (PARs) were proposed for the manufacturing process. A major objection was raised 
due to the lack of supporting data. As a result, the PARs were replaced with normal operating ranges 
(NORs) in all synthetic steps. The NORs are based on operational variability seen in historical batches. 
The NORs proposed are accepted.  
The risk for mutagenic impurities in the active substance has been assessed. The control strategy 
ensures that impurities identified as potential mutagenic are kept below the TTCwhich is acceptable. 
The summary of control strategies for each solvent used in the process is presented and accepted.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. All batches of cefiderocol tosilate sulfate have been manufactured by the 
same route, however, some process improvements were made throughout development. These have 
been adequately presented and justified. In the development phase, regulatory starting material was 
re-designated to intermediate and two new staring materials were designated. Due to this, the GMP 
synthesis was extended further back.

The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  double  low-density  polyethylene  (LDPE)  bags  sealed  with  plastic 
band ties. The bags are placed into stainless steel drums sealed with a steel lid.  The LDPE bags comply 
with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, identification (UV and IR), assay of 
free base (HPLC), sulfuric acid and p-toluene sulfonic acid (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual 
solvent (GC), water (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and microbial 
examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The acceptance limit for the assay has been set based on the theoretical content of  Cefiderocolfree 
base inCefiderocol tosilate sulfate and an evaluation of the representative batch data, stability results 
and analytical variation This has been justified by confirming that the mass balance is consistently 
almost 100% for representative batches ofCefiderocol tosilate sulfate. Stability data at long-term 
storage condition showed no significant change in assay. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set.  
There are several potential mutagenic compounds identified related to the manufacture ofCefiderocol 
tosilate sulfate. Some of these are controlled by specifications in starting materials or intermediates 
(option 3, ICH M7); they have all be shown to be at levels less than 30% of the TTC in an intermediate 
orCefiderocol tosilate sulfate. Additionally, purging studies have been performed supporting the 
proposed specification levels 
One solvent is controlled by the specificationBased on batch analysis data, supporting the absence of 
other potential residual solvents manufacturing the proposed control of residual solvents is accepted. 
Batch data confirms that the only crystalline form identified for cefiderocol tosilate sulfate is 
synthesised by the proposed route. Additionally, the active substance is dissolved before it is 
lyophilised; hence, the absence of a test for the identity of the crystalline form and for particle size is 
justified. 
A specification for optical rotation in the active substance is deemed not required since the only 
stereoisomer likely to form, is detected by the related substances method and controlled in the active 
substance specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data () of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications 
and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from ommercial scale batches of active substance stored in the intended commercial 
packaging for up to 24 months under long term conditions (−20ºC ± 5ºC) and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (5ºC ± 3ºC) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Due to the 
redefinition of the starting materials late during development, the batches were not manufactured fully

at the proposed commercial manufacturing site; however, they were manufactured at commercial 
scale using essentially the proposed manufacturing process. The post approval stability protocol states 
that the long term and accelerated stability study will be repeated with the first three production 
batches manufactured by the commercial GMP manufacturing process at the commercial scale and site. 
This is considered as acceptable. The available provided data are considered representative. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed. Results on stress conditions, for 
up to 4 weeks, and forced degradation studies for up to 4 weeks in the dry state and in the solution 
phase were also provided. A temperature cycling study to assure the quality of the active substance in 
repeated freeze-thaw cycles, to simulate storage between use for manufacture of separate batches of 
the finished product, was performed. 
The following parameters were tested: description, related substances, water, assay, sulfuric acid, p-
toluenesulfonic acid, identification (IR), bacterial endotoxins, crystalline form (primary stability batches 
only), microbiological examination. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and 
were stability indicating. XRPD was used to determine the crystalline form. At long term conditions, a 
slight increase in the amounts of related substances were observed for the three primary stability 
batches. However, all tested parameters were within the specifications.  
Under accelerated conditions, degradation products increased one specified impurity was out of 
specification at 3 months and unspecified impurities were out of specification at 6 months. The total 
related substances content for all batches increased at 6 months. Assay values were slightly lower at 6 
months for the primary stability batches; however, in supporting data from process validation batches, 
they remained unchanged. No significant changes were observed forseveral parameters. The observed 
out of specification results indicate that the active substance is not stable under accelerated conditions. 
Under stress conditions, there was an increase of the same related substances observed following 
storage at the accelerated stability study condition. A slight decrease in assay was also observed under 
stress conditions. The levels of one specified impurity and ‘any unspecified impurity’ increased at 4 
weeks, respectively. Total related substances increased at 4 weeks. The assay decreased (as 
cefiderocol on an anhydrous basis) at 4 weeks. No significant changes were observed several 
parameters.  
Under photostability testing, related substances increased and the assay decreased from an initial 
value (as free base on an anhydrous basis). Two specified impurities impurities increased as well. A 
slight colour change was observed. No significant changes were observed for the other test items). 
Based on the photostability studies, although the active substance is sensitive to light, no special 
handling instructions are needed during the manufacture of the active substance or the subsequent 
use in the finished product manufacture.  
Under solid state stress conditions, a slight colour change was observed with time at all storage 
conditions. A large increase in related substances, especiallyone specified impurity, was observed due 
to hydrolysis ofcefiderocol tosilate sulfate. Under solution phase forced degradation storage conditions, 
no significant changes were observed for clarity, colour of solution and pH. As for related substances, 
an increase of one specified impurity was observed at all storage conditions due to hydrolysis of 
cefiderocol tosilate sulfate. Other related substances which increased significantly under each storage 
condition have been described. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable under long term conditions. The stability results justify the proposed retest period at 
the following conditions: “Keep the sealed LDPE bags in the stainless steel drum and store in a freezer 
below −15°C”.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Fetcroja (cefiderocol) 1 g powder for concentrate for solution for infusionl, is a sterile, white to off-
white, lyophilised cake or powder containing 1 g of Cefiderocol packaged in a single-use, 14 mL Type I 
clear glass vial. The qualitative composition of cefiderocol powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion has been provided. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Sterile filtration (aseptic processing) has been selected as the sterilisation method. This is in 
accordance with the decision tree for sterilisation choices for non-aqueous liquid, semi-solid or dry 
powder products in CPMP/QWP/054/98 and is considered acceptable.  
The manufacturing process for cefiderocol finished product consists of the following unit operations: 
bulk solution preparation, sterile filtration, aseptic vial filling, lyophilisation and sealing. The operating 
units remained unchanged during the pharmaceutical development of the product. 
The formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of risk 
assessment, The risk identification was based on the prior knowledge of products with similar 
formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the experience from formulation development 
and scale up studies. The potential critical material attributes (CMAs) and CPPs and the impact of their 
variability on finished product quality were further studied via experiments designed to understand the 
process and control the risks to acceptable levels. A second risk assessment was conducted, after the 
experimental studies, to confirm the CMAs and CPPs and to determine the operating ranges of material 
attributes of input materials. The process parameters were also investigated for each of the following 
process steps: bulk solution preparation, vial filling and lyophilisation. As a result, effective control 
strategies were developed to minimize the risks to acceptable levels.  
Cefiderocol 1 g powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, is supplied as a sterile, lyophilised cake 
or powder, which must be reconstituted and subsequently diluted, under aseptic conditions, prior to 
intravenous infusion. To achieve the recommended dosage of 2 g cefiderocol per dose, two vials 
containing 1 g of cefiderocol are each reconstituted with 10 mL of commercially available 0.9% sodium 
chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection, taken from an infusion bag containing 100 mL. The final 
volume of each reconstituted solution in the vial will be approximately 11.2 mL. The resulting solution 
from each vial is transferred back into the same infusion bag within 60 minutes to achieve a final 
volume of at least 100 mL and dosing concentration of 20 mg/mL.  
A study performed to determine extractable content using a 10 mL syringe with a 21 gauge needle 
confirmed that the extractable content is adequate. Parenteral finished product solutions should 
preferably have a pH in the physiological range. However, the tolerated pH range is broader for larger 
volumes given intravenously. Hence, in view of the solubility of the active substance, the pH range of 
5.2 to 5.8 for the reconstituted solution is considered acceptable. The osmotic value of the infusion 
solution (572 mOsm) is in the physiological range, to avoid irritation at the site of injection. The 
compatibility of the finished product with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection was 
demonstrated in the infusion bag, in the reconstituted vial, and in a representative infusion set; this is 
considered acceptable. 
The primary packaging is Type I clear glass vial chlorobutyl elastomeric stopper, and aluminum seal with 
a plastic flip-off cap. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The vials are packaged in 
Assessment report

an outer (secondary) cardboard carton to protect from light. The choice of the container closure system 
has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  5  main  steps:  bulk  solution  preparation  by  compounding  the 
excipients and active substance; sterile filtrationaseptic vial filling, lyophilisation and sealing. The process 
is  considered  a  non-standard  manufacturing  process  as  it  involves  sterile  filtration  and  aseptic.  Major 
steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. The specification results 
complied with the release specification criteria. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process 
is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description  (visual  assessment),  identification  (HPLC/PDA),  assay  (HPLC),  clarity  and  colour  of  the 
solution  (visual  assessment),  degradation  products  (HPLC),    uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.), 
particulate  contamination  (Ph.  Eur.),  bacterial  endotoxins  (Ph.  Eur.),  sterility  (Ph.  Eur.),  pH 
(potentiometry), water (Ph. Eur.) and reconstitution time (visual assessment). 
During the review of the application it was confirmed that none of the identified degradation products 
are mutagenic. Additionally, the proposed limits for degradation above the ICH qualification threshold 
have been supported by batch and toxicological data. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 
batches manufactured at pilot scale (representative of the commercial process) were provided, 
demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective 
PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not 
necessary to include any elemental impurity controls.  
The potential risk of nitrosamines was assessed. The risk of the presence of nitrosamine in the finished 
product is considered negligible.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented, as described in the active substance section. 
Batch analysis results are provided for full scale process validation batches confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from primary pilot scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long 
term conditions (5 ºC) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of finished product are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for the same tests as the release specification, with the exclusion of identity and 
uniformity of dosage units; this is acceptable as they are not affected by stability 
No  significant  changes  were  observed  in  any  of  the  monitored  parameters  in  the  stability  program. 
However, increasing trends in the content of degradation products were observed. In addition, a slight 
Assessment report

decrease  in  assay,  when  stored  under  the  accelerated  storage  condition  for  6  months  was  observed. 
However, all the results were within the proposed specification limits. 
Primary stability studies at accelerated and long-term storage conditions were conducted with vials in 
an  inverted  orientation  and  confirm  absence  of  leachables  from  the  rubber  stoppers  in  the  finished 
product impurity profiles. 
In addition, one batch of the finished product was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products and onebatch was exposed to temperature 
cycling. The content of degradation products increased. No significant change was observed in any other 
test attributes. In the control samples covered with aluminium foil, no significant change was observed 
in  any  test  attributes.  The  results  of  the  photostability  testing  indicate  that  the  finished  product  is 
susceptible  to  decomposition  when  exposed  to  light;  therefore,  light-protective  packaging  and  a 
precautionary labelling statement are required, as reflected in the SmPC. The data provided show that 
temperature cycling and repeated freeze-thaw does not have an adverse impact on the finished product. 
When the finished product was stored under the solid state forced degradation storage conditions of high 
temperature  and  humiditythe  major  degradation  product  was  a  specified  impurity.  In  solution,  the 
finished product was labile to all forced degradation storage conditions (acidic, alkaline and oxidative). 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years and the proposed storage conditions 
“Store in a refrigerator (2 to 8°C). Store in the original carton in order to protect from light” as stated in 
the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
In-use solution stability study, samples taken from the primary stability batches, which are stored in the 
long-term stability study were used to assess the impact of aged samples on in-use stability. The in-use 
solution  stability  studies  of  the  reconstituted  product  in  the  vial  and  in  the  infusion  polyolefin  bags 
containing  0.9%  sodium  chloride  injection  or  5%  dextrose  injection  stored  at  25°C/60%RH  under 
fluorescent light for 6 hours (simulating administration conditions), or at 5°C protected from light for 24 
hours followed by subsequent storage at 25°C /60% RH for 6 hours under fluorescent light, did not meet 
the  shelf  life  acceptance  criterion  and  the  unspecified  degradation  product  increased  above  the 
qualification  threshold.  However,  the  levels  of  degradation  products  observed  in  the  in-use  stability 
studies (considering both infusion bag and reconstituted vial) have been qualified based on toxicology 
data.  No  significant  changes  were  observed  in  any  of  the  other  parameters  studied.  Additionally,  the 
results  of  microbial  challenge  testing  for  reconstituted  solutions,  stored  under  the  same  conditions 
described above, support the recommended in-use shelf-life and storage conditions for the reconstituted 
solutions of the finished product stored in infusion bags. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The choice of the pharmaceutical form and sterilization 
method has been adequately justified based on the instability of the active substance in solution and 
its susceptibility to light and heat. The applicant resolved a major objection by replacing the proposed 
PARs with NORs, the control strategy was also further substantiated during the review. The results of 
tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and 
these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform 
performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary and secondary pharmacodynamic studies  
The Applicant has conducted in vitro and in vivo studies to address the primary pharmacodynamics of 
cefiderocol, which have been presented and assessed in conjunction with the clinical data (see clinical 
aspects). A standard secondary pharmacology screen for the ability of cefiderocol to bind a panel of 
receptors, ion channels, transporters and enzymes was performed using a single concentration 100 µM. 
The concentration tested is relatively low and is only 1.3-fold the unbound Cmax level seen with the 
proposed clinical dose. No significant effects were seen at the measured levels, with the highest level 
of inhibition seen with cathepsin G at 24%. The applicant has indicated, based on these findings, that 
cefiderocol would not cause adverse effects through the receptors, channels, transports or enzymes 
evaluated in this study. However, this statement was not fully supported by CHMP, considering the low 
concentration tested and the applicant was asked to justify the concentration of cefiderocol used for 
the secondary pharmacology screen, also in the context of the convulsions seen in the repeat dose 
toxicity studies in rats. In its response, the Applicant maintained the position that 100 µM was a 
sufficiently high concentration for the secondary pharmacology screen as this was 1.3-fold of the 
maximum unbound concentration in human plasma. However, the reported clinical Cmax is a 
geometric mean and some patients will have Cmax levels greater than the 100 μmol/L which was used 
in the secondary pharmacology screen. CHMP was therefore unable to conclude whether the 
concentration was adequate to evaluate the secondary effects.  
The Applicant further suggested that while the cefiderocol sodium drug product did not show inhibitory 
effect against GABA receptor at 100 μmol/L, the mechanism of proconvulsive effects of cefiderocol is 
still likely to be related to the inhibition of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor binding, which is 
generally assumed as a mechanism of the convulsion induced by the known β-lactam antibiotics. 
Indeed, as evidenced from the estimated brain exposure in the rats in the repeat dose studies in which 
convulsions were observed, it appears unlikely that an inhibitory effect on the GABA receptor is the 
mechanism behind the observed convulsions. However, CHMP acknowledged that the screen did not 
show any significant signal for inhibition of specific binding to the measured targeted molecules. Whilst 
using a higher concentration of the drug in the secondary pharmacology screen would seem to have 
been more appropriate, taking into account the absence of secondary pharmacology targets identified 
in the already conducted screen and the clinical safety profile to date, CHMP agreed that the issue did 
not need to be further pursued.

Safety pharmacology programme 
In a functional GLP compliant observational study in rats, prone positions were observed in single 
animals at 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg, indicative of sedative effects. In the 1000 mg/kg group, one 
animal showed decreased motor activity and decreased mean rectal temperature (-1° C). These minor 
findings suggest that cefiderocol may exhibit some inhibitory effects on CNS at high exposures, since 
all these findings were normalized within 0.5 hours in parallel with a decrease in plasma concentration 
of cefiderocol. No TK analysis was performed and hence not possible to estimate any exposure 
margins. However, no related findings such as sedation or hypothermia were noted in the repeat 
toxicity rat studies (with same doses - see toxicology 3.2.3). Moreover, these CNS adverse effects 
were not reported in the clinical studies (CTD 2.7.4.2), and hence is not considered as a potential risk 
in humans.   
Effects of cefiderocol on respiratory function were investigated in a GLP compliant study in male SD 
rats (250 – 1000 mg/kg) and it was concluded that cefiderocol did not induce any effects on 
respiratory parameters. 
Cardiovascular effects of cefiderocol were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro it was concluded that 
cefiderocol exert minor effects on the myocardial potential in papillary muscles isolated from guinea 
pigs at 1.5 mg/mL. Increases (< + 10%) in action potential duration at 90 and 30% of repolarization 
(APD90 and APD30) were observed. The study conducted in HEK293 cells stably expressing hERG 
channels, indicate a dose related suppression of hERG, being 12 % at the highest dose (1.5 mg/mL) 
and hence an IC50 > 1.5 mg/mL. From the in vitro studies it can be concluded that cefiderocol has 
minor effects on the myocardial action potential and hERG at 1.5 mg/mL, which is 27-fold the free 
Cmax value in humans (56 ug/mL). 
In monkeys administered with 100 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg no effects on any CV parameters were 
observed, whereas after administration of 1000 mg/kg the blood pressure increased in all treated 
monkeys. An increase in both systolic (+32 mmHg) and diastolic (+21 mmHg) pressures was noted 
and both returned to baseline values after 4 hours. Moreover, at 1000 mg/kg prolongations of QT 
intervals and QTc were identified. The QTc increase reached a max 0.5 h directly after administration 
(+34%) which returned to vehicle levels 2 hours post dosing. The serum cefiderocol concentrations 
(Cmax) at 1000 mg/kg give an exposure margins of 24-fold, whereas 300 mg where no QTs 
prolongations were observed corresponds to an exposure margin of 8-fold. The prolongation of QTc 
have also been observed in repeat toxicity studies of monkeys (see toxicology assessment). A 
thorough QT/QTc study conducted in humans (a sub-population in study R2116), no clinically changes 
in cardiovascular functions (including QT-prolongation) were seen when supra-therapeutic dosing (4g), 
corresponding to Cmax of 183 ug/mL was administered, and conclusively QT prolongation is 
considered not to be of any clinical concern. 
Other clinically observations throughout the monkey telemetry study include vomiting, stretching and 
chromaturia. The latter was found in all four monkeys at all doses. 
Follow up studies (CNS) 
Convulsions were observed in the 3 months repeat toxicity study in rats (S-649266-TF-224-L), and two 
animals died due to the convulsions. Considering these adverse findings, the Applicant conducted two 
follow up safety in vivo studies in mice and rats, respectively. In mice, the proconvulsive effects of 
cefiderocol was compared to four reference substances i.e. cefazolin (CEZ), cefepime (CFPM), 
ceftazidime (CAZ) and imipenem (IMP), all B-lactam antibiotics. The results showed that the potency of 
the proconvulsive effect was weaker for cefiderocol than that of IPM, and similar to those of CEZ and 
CFPM and stronger than CAZ. In the rat study EEG analysis and behaviour observations were done to 
assess the convulsive effect of cefiderocol and the combination of IPM and cilastatin (CS). Single 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 20/154 
 
 
 
dosing of 500 mg/kg and 750 mg/kg caused no EEG signs and no convulsions whereas in the IPM/CS 
treated rats (dose of 400/400 mg/kg) spike and slow wave complexes were found, together with 
convulsions in 3 of 6 animals.  
According to TK determination in the 3 months toxicity study, the NOAEL (no convulsions) corresponds 
to an exposure margin of 11-fold (based on C0 of 1280 ug/mL in males).  It is known that B-lactam 
antibiotics cause convulsions in experimental animals and also occasionally reported as an adverse 
reaction in clinical use. The convulsive potential of B-lactam antibiotics is believed to be related to an 
inhibitory effect against GABA receptors at high doses. But no binding to GABA receptors were 
detected in the secondary pharmacodynamic in vitro study using doses up to 100 umol/L (75.2 ug/mL) 
which is in same concentration range as in humans (Cmax of unbound cefiderocol 55 ug/mL), 
indicating that supra-therapeutic exposure is needed. In SmPC 4.4 a warning for convulsion is present 
(in line with all classes of cephalosporins). CHMP agreed that from a non-clinical point of new no 
further action is considered necessary. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
Cefiderocol was quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in plasma 
of rat, monkey and mouse. From a regulatory perspective, the validation of the analytical methods 
used in the pivotal toxicity studies should be of GLP-standard, which appears not to be the case for 
cefiderocol (a signed GLP-statement in the bioanalytical validation reports are missing). The only TK 
study of cefiderocol conducted with a GLP compliant analysis is the juvenile toxicity study. The 
Applicant was asked by CHMP to justify the reliability of these bioanalytical assays with respect to 
deviation from the GLP requirements and to discuss the potential impact on the resulting TK/PK 
analysis. In its response, the Applicant clarified that while the bioanalytical studies were not performed 
according to GLP standards, they were still performed with procedures used in GLP facilities with 
enclosed statements. Even though the Guideline on bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009) states that all the bioassays should be conducted with GLP validated 
methods, CHMP agreed that the high-quality standards of the bioanalytical methods used here can be 
considered adequate for the non-clinical analyses. The issue was therefore not further pursued. 
Absorption 
After single intravenous dose of cefiderocol a dose-linearity was found in both rats and monkeys at the 
doses tested i.e. 10 to 100 mg/kg. The same PK was also seen in humans at doses 100 mg to 4000 
mg. The total clearance following single intravenous dose of cefiderocol was higher in rats (522 
ml/hr/kg) than in monkeys (153 mL/hr/kg). The half-life of cefiderocol in rats, monkeys and humans 
are 0.4, 1.2 and 2-3 hours, respectively.  
Distribution  
Binding to plasma proteins were studied in vitro and the protein binding ratio was higher in humans 
(60 %) than in rodents (mice 39%, and rats 52 %), monkey being the species with most similar 
protein binding grade as humans (62 %). In humans, Cefiderocol binds predominantly to HAS. 
Notably, at the highest concentration tested (1000 ug/mL) the albumins may be saturated since the 
bound fraction constitute 40 % of cefiderocol in humans. The same trend is observed in rats, mice and 
monkeys, i.e. lower percentage of bound cefiderocol at higher doses. 
Tissue distribution of 14C-cefiderocol derived radioactivity was investigated using QWBA in both albino 
and pigmented rats administered i.v with a single dose. Two different radio-labelled preparations of 
cefiderocol were used for the single dose studies, either labelled at the thiazole ring or at the catechol 
Assessment report

Page 21/154 
 
 
 
moiety. This strategy was used in order to monitor both cefiderocol degradation products ATAA and 
PCBA.  Both the thiazine and catechol radio-labelled variants were rapidly and widely distributed in the 
whole body with similar distribution patterns. Regardless of radiolabelled position, the radioactivity was 
higher in kidneys than in plasma being highest in the kidney cortex and medulla. After 120 h both 
thiazine- and catechol derived radioactivity remained detectable in the kidneys, whereas thiazole 
derived radioactivity remained detectible also at 336 h post-dose.  
Because the elimination of radioactivity from thiazole-14C cefiderocol was slower than catechol-14C-
cefiderocol, the former was used in the 14 days repeat-dose distribution study. Radioactivity was 
observed in all tissues and reached a steady state within 14 days in many of the tissues. But a few 
tissues including kidneys cortex, adrenals, blood, and thyroid, a steady state was not reached after 14 
days daily administration. In the study report a half-life in kidney cortex of 168-840 hours was 
estimated. The concentrations of radioactivity associated with the kidney and urinary bladder 
suggested renal excretion as a main route. Radioactivity in the bile ducts, and GI tract suggested some 
elimination via biliary secretion. 
Radioactivity after single dose administration of both catechol-14C- and thiazole-14C cefiderocol were 
observed in the brain but at very low concentrations and BLQ after 6 and 24 h, respectively. After two 
weeks administration of thiazole-14C cefiderocol, radioactivity was detected at low levels in the brain.  
These data indicate low brain penetration in the rat. 
Pigmented and albino rats showed similar tissue distributions including similar distribution to melatonin 
rich tissues and with a similar elimination rate – suggesting that binding to melanin is negligible.  
In pregnant rats, a minor placenta crossing of cefiderocol was observed which is accordingly stated in 
SmPC 4.6. In the foetus’s low concentrations were detected in kidneys, blood, brain that was not 
detected 24 h post dose. It is not known to what extent the foetuses are exposed to the degradation 
product PCBA and its conjugated metabolites (since only thiazol-14C-cefiderocol was used in the 
distribution study of pregnant rats). But considering that these are minor metabolites, and the absence 
of foetal toxicity such study is not warranted. 
Metabolism 
The in vitro metabolism profiling study was conducted with catechol-14C cefiderocol in liver 
hepatocytes from human, rats, monkeys, mouse and rabbits. All degradation and metabolic products 
identified were minor and all metabolites identified in humans were also abundant in any of the other 
species tested. The in vivo metabolism studies in rats and monkeys unchanged cefiderocol was mainly 
found (34-39% of the administered radioactivity). Also PCBA was detected in plasma and urine (1.3-
2.6% of the administered radioactivity). In both rats and monkeys, around 15-19% of administered 
radioactivity was detected as unknown metabolites/degradation products (for example ATAA) whereas 
in humans, the presence of radioactivity from unknown metabolites were negligible. Since all of the 
metabolites were found at < 10% based on the total radioactivity AUC in plasma in humans (see 
clinical pharmacokinetic AR) the Applicant judged that no further safety assessment for the metabolites 
are needed, which was agreed upon by CHMP. It was noted that all the minor metabolites/degradation 
products formed in rats and monkeys are covered for in the toxicity studies. 
Elimination 
Urinary excretion appears to be the main elimination pathway in rat and monkeys (as well has 
humans), i.e. more than 90% of radioactive catechol-14C cefiderocol are detected in urine. Most of the 
radioactive excreted in urine were unchanged cefiderocol. In addition, metabolites were found in low 
levels in the urine. In faces, a minor elimination route for cefiderocol, PCBA was the main metabolite 
detected.

Cefiderocol was excreted in the milk of rats administered with a single dose of [thizole-14C-]-
cefiderocol, and the radioactivity in milk decreased slowly post-dose. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
A comprehensive set of non-clinical studies to evaluate the toxicity of cefiderocol sodium has been 
completed in accordance with the ICH M3 (R2) guideline. All pivotal studies have been performed in 
accordance with the GLP regulations. In these studies, and unless otherwise stated, the dose levels are 
expressed as cefiderocol.  
The substance has been evaluated with the active substance administered by the intravenous route in 
Sprague-Dawley rats and Cynomolgus monkeys. There is no justification for the use of these species in 
the studies; the Applicant only states that these species are “standard species for evaluation of toxicity 
in animals”. While this is true, the use of Cynomolgus monkey should be reserved to situations where 
this species is the only relevant species. Given that this is an antibiotic, it is possible that other species 
would have been equally useful, despite the fact that intravenously administered antibiotics have 
traditionally been evaluated in cynomolgus monkey. 
New Zealand White rabbit was the species of choice for the EFD study. However, due to excessive 
toxicity (body weight loss and GI-intolerability) and moribundity/euthanasia in the DRF-study, it was 
concluded that this species was unsuitable. GI intolerability is considered well-known in rabbits 
exposed to high doses of antibiotics, as the antibiotic sensitive enterobacterial microflora is critical to 
rabbit digestion. The Applicant decided to use an additional rodent model (CD-1 mouse) and 
subcutaneous administration instead of intravenously administered rabbits, because repeated-dosing 
with intravenous administration in mice is not feasible. Advantages and disadvantages of the selected 
species were considered in relation to the specific substance with regards to study designs, 
administration routes, interpretability of the results etc. The Applicant was asked to justify the use of 
cynomolgus monkey in the general toxicology program and explain the rational for using the CD-1 
mouse in the EFD study. In the response, the Applicant explained that in exploratory single-dose 
studies in dog, vomiting was observed several times from during dosing to 1 hour after the end of 
dosing at 1000 mg/kg, reason for which the Applicant considered that dogs would not tolerate repeat-
dosing at the 1000 mg/kg dose level. While this consideration is supported, it is not clear why 
cynomolgus monkey was considered as the only alternative. CHMP agreed however that since the 
studies had already been completed in the monkey, this would not be further pursued. 
Regarding the animal model use in the EFD studies it was clear that the rabbit was not suitable and, as 
pointed out by the Applicant, GI intolerability is considered well-known in rabbits exposed to high 
doses of antibiotics. The antibiotic sensitive enterobacterial microflora is critical to rabbit digestion why 
excessive toxicity (including weight-loss and GI intolerability) and moribundity/euthanasia was evident 
in the DRF-study. The mouse model is well-characterized and a relevant species for EFD-studies, and 
often serves as a substitute for the rat as a rodent model. In addition, the mouse model could be 
dosed such that sufficient exposure level was reached. Overall the justifications for the species use in 
the general toxicology and EFD studies is considered acceptable. 
Single dose toxicity 
One single-dose study in rats at receiving cefiderocol sodium at doses of 2000 mg/kg q.d or 
1000mg/kg b.i.d was performed in mice. 5/8 animals in the q.d. group died from convulsions and 
abnormal respiration with no acute symptoms noted in the b.i.d.-group. The Cmax in the q.d. group 
was about twice as high as in the b.i.d. group, why it was suspected that the effect may be Cmax-
driven. In any case, 2000mg/kg was clearly above MTD.

Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated-dose toxicity has been evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rat and Cynomolgus monkey in studies 
of up to three months duration in both species. The study findings were similar across studies from 2-
weeks up to three months, with no new adverse toxicity emerging in the longer studies. This was 
considered reassuring by CHMP. While the toxicity profile of the product is likely manageable for the 
intended indication, there are toxicity findings in the studies that are of particular focus. Important 
such findings include convulsions noted in rats for which no likely mechanism has been presented by 
the Applicant and QTc-prolongation. Additional findings that have been recurring in the studies include 
injection site toxicity, low RBCs, hyaline droplets in the kidneys and dilatation of the cecum. Further 
analyses of the findings including a discussion on their potential clinical relevance are included below. 
Mortalities 
Mortalities were noted in the rat, both in the DRF-studies (2000mg/kg/day) and also in the 3-month 
study (10 main study animals and 10 TK animals administered doses at and above 1000mg/kg/day). 
Based on the data presented, it appears that all deaths were related to convulsions and abnormal 
respiration. The convulsion findings are further discussed below. In the 3-month GLP-study in monkey, 
one female at 1000mg/kg/day was terminated due to excoriation on one of the tail injections sites 
which was supported by necropsy findings. The death is considered attributed to the infusion of 
cefiderocol sodium. 
Convulsions 
Convulsions related to dosing were noted in the rat at doses from 1000mg/kg/day and above. In the 
3-month study, they started during dosing or within 16 minutes of completion of dosing between SD 2-
91. The relation to the actual dosing indicates that there may be a relation of the convulsion to the 
Cmax of cefiderocol. Convulsions were also evident in the single-dose studies at 2000mg/kg and in the 
in vivo micronucleus test where 3 animals died from convulsions at 2000mg/kg/day. In that study, a 
decrease in locomotor activity and convulsion were observed in animals early after each 
administration. However, while similar doses (at or above 1000mg/kg/day) were used in the shorter 
general toxicology studies, no such findings were reported from the 2-week and 1-month studies. The 
reason for this variability in results between studies is unclear, and as no TK-data are available from 
the shorter studies (or the micronucleus study) we cannot find support in plasma concentration data.  
The Applicant was asked to further discuss these issues. In the response, the applicant suggested that 
the differences seen are likely due to the systemic exposure achieved at 1000 and 1500 mg/kg being 
close to the threshold for which convulsions can occur. Due to the variability between animals, some of 
the animals at the 1000 or 1500 mg/kg may have passed this threshold and experienced convulsions. 
Furthermore, it is argued that the incidence of convulsions was low in the 3-month study and 
considering it had greater animals per group, overall there is not significant differences in the 
proconvulsive liability between the 1- and 3-month repeat-dose toxicity studies. Based on the totality 
of the data, CHMP agreed that these arguments can be deemed reasonable. It is accepted that the risk 
of convulsions for patients at the clinical dose is low. 
Based on the convulsions noted in at 1000mg/kg/day, the NOAEL for the 3-month rat study was set at 
300mg/kg/day. To evaluate more in depth the dose-response relationship of convulsions between 300 
and 1000 mg/kg/day, a follow-up study was undertaken by the Applicant where the intermediate dose 
levels 500 and 750 mg/kg/day were used. In that study, no convulsions were noted up to 
750mg/kg/day which was then the NOAEL in the study. According to the Applicants summary-
document, the NOAEL was set to 750 “in terms of assessment of electroencephalogram and 
behaviour”. However, the study report does not mention either behaviour (except cage-side 
observation) or electroencephalograms why the basis for this justification is unclear or even erroneous. 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 24/154 
 
 
 
Given the intra-study differences in convulsions, it would have been useful with animals at a pro-
convulsive dose-level (as a study positive control and for TK-level reasons) as no convulsions were 
noted at either dose-level in this study. On the other hand, CHMP agreed that the decision to not 
include animals in such a dose-group is acceptable from the 3R perspective.  
Comparing TK-data from the 3-month study and the supplemental 3-month study show that the serum 
levels of cefiderocol show a dose-proportional pattern in both studies, and that the 500 and 
750mg/kg/day dose groups in the supplemental study were exposed to the expected cefiderocol levels. 
The Cmax-levels at the NOAEL (750mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma cefiderocol levels of 1500 or 
1610 μg/ml) correspond to an exposure margin of 13 to clinical exposure at the intended dosing 
regimen. No convulsions were evident in the monkey studies, despite cefiderocol serum concentrations 
in the 3-month study up to 22-fold the human clinical Cmax-value. 
It was noted that, despite the lack of convulsions in the monkey studies at doses up to 22-fold the 
human clinical concentration, the findings noted in the rat studies were not fully reassuring, as no 
mechanism for the effect has been suggested, and margin to human exposure for this potentially lethal 
effect is modest. 
Injection-site effects 
Injection-site effects were common in the studies as cefiderocol sodium was administered by the 
intravenous route. In rats, blackening, loss, trauma, crust, and/or scar of injection site supported by 
histopathologic gross lesion findings up to serious grade was a relatively common finding throughout 
the repeated-dose studies in rats. In monkey, red foci in the subcutaneous tissue at the injection sites 
were observed across all groups including controls in studies from 2 weeks duration and longer. In the 
3-month study, one 1000mg/kg/day female was terminated early due to excoriation on one of the tail 
injections sites why dosing could not be continued due to loss of vessel patency at all injection sites. 
Other HD animals did also display injection site thrombus with thickening vascular intima sometimes 
accompanied by very slight or slight chronic inflammation. It is thus clear that the substance causes 
irritation effects during administration, even if the irritation effect at 300 is considered slight with only 
one affected animal. It should however, be noted that in monkeys, irritation to the vein was observed 
mainly at 1000 mg/kg/day (the concentration of cefiderocol in dosing formulation: 50 mg/mL), slight 
irritation was observed at 300 mg/kg/day (15 mg/mL) at a low incidence, and no irritation was 
detected at 100 mg/kg/day (5 mg/mL) after 3-month dosing. Thus, it seems that the actual 
concentration of the solution is important and comparing the concentration of dosing formulation 
planned for clinical use (20 mg/mL or less) and the concentration of 15 mg/mL which caused only 
slight irritation in monkey, it is not considered likely that this will represent an important clinical 
toxicity. Also, only mild-moderate injection site effects have been reported from the clinical studies, 
further supporting this position. 
QTc Prolongation 
QTc prolongation was observed in all studies in monkey at doses of 600 and/or 1000mg/kg/day. This 
effect apparently increased in magnitude with dosing time, as the effect was most pronounced (up to 
27% on SD 85 compared to pre-dosing values) in the 3-month study, whereas increases of 10-15% 
were noted in the 1-month and 2-week studies. However, there was no or only marginal increase from 
SD 49 to SD 85 in the 3-month study, suggesting that the effect would not increase further with even 
longer dosing. QTc-prolongation was also noted in the safety-pharmacology evaluation of cefiderocol 
sodium at 1000mg/kg using the same dosing-regime (1h infusion at 20ml/kg). There, the QTc values 
reached the maximum levels 0.25 hours post dose compared to the mean value in the vehicle control 
group (19% increase compared to control and 34% increase compared to predosing values). The QTc 
values returned to control levels up to 2 hours post dose (except for one animal, which recovered by 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 25/154 
 
 
 
24 hours post dose). The exposure margin for the NOAEL for QTc-prolongation in the 3-month study 
(300mg/kg/day) compared to clinical exposure is around 7. It should however be noted that no cardiac 
arrythmias were observed throughout the study. Further, a clinical thorough QT study (at supra 
therapeutic dosing) did not find evidence for QTc prolongation. 
Hyaline droplets in the kidney 
Hyaline droplets were evident in the proximal tubules of the kidney in all the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rats and monkeys at all dose levels between 100 and 1500 mg/kg/day. The Applicant 
describes that it has been reported that hyaline droplets in the proximal tubules are observed in 
animals administered cephalosporin antibiotics and the change is associated with absorption and 
secretion of these compounds in lysosome. Thus, the finding should then reflect reabsorption or 
excretion of cefiderocol in the proximal tubules. However, no data have been provided to support that 
the droplets are indicative of cefiderocol absorption/excretion. Further kidney findings in the 1-month 
study in monkey include increased kidney weights from 600mg/kg/day and increased protein urine 
concentration at 1000mg/kg/day. In the 3-month study in monkey, the hyaline droplet effect was still 
graded very slight-slight, but increases were seen in kidney weights and serum creatinine from 
300mg/kg/day. Increased urine protein is reported in animals exposed to cefiderocol sodium at 
1000mg/kg/day. CHMP agreed that it was evident from the data that cefiderocol sodium exposure at 
clinically relevant doses have effects on kidney weights, physiological function (evidenced from serum 
and urine biomarkers) and deposition of hyaline droplets. Because of the minimal grade also at the HD 
in the longest studies and the lack of degeneration/necrosis and regeneration of tubule epithelial cells 
this has not been considered an adverse effect in any study. 
Dilatation of the cecum 
Cecal dilatation was observed in all repeated-dose toxicity studies in the rat and at all dose levels from 
300 to 1500 mg/kg/day. The findings were often associated with atrophy of the mucosa or hypertrophy 
of the mucosal epithelium. The effect was time- and dose-related but was not graded as more than 
slight and with no evidence of necrosis of the mucosal epithelium in any study. This effect of antibiotics 
is considered well-known and is related to the antibacterial effect of the antibiotic on the 
enterobacterial flora. Similar (but dramatically increased) effects were evident in rabbits treated with 
cefiderocol in the preliminary EFD-study. No cecum dilatation effects were noted in the studies in 
monkey, and in the clinical studies performed with cefiderocol to date there have been no clear reports 
on abdominal/intestinal adversities. Thus, there is no data to support that this effect is relevant for 
humans exposed to clinical doses of cefiderocol. 
Effects on blood parameters 
Effects on erythrocytes, haematocrit, and haemoglobin were evident in the cynomolgus studies from 
300mg/kg/day in the 3-month study and 1000mg/kg/day in the 1-month study. Increases in 
reticulocyte count and/or hyperplasia in the femoral or sternal bone marrow were also observed. The 
Latter changes were considered to be a hematopoietic response to the decreased erythrocyte 
parameters. Similar effects on red blood cell parameters, but to a lesser extent was found in rats. No 
haemorrhagic lesions (except for the injured injection site due to local irritation in rats) have been 
identified in the studies and no evidence of haemolysis either. In a separate haemolysis assay, there 
were no data supporting haemolytic effects of cefiderocol sodium presented. Thus, the mechanism(s) 
underlying the decrease in red blood-cell parameters is (are) not clear. 
Interestingly, throughout the study program, abnormal urine colour was observed in both sexes in all 
test article groups throughout the dosing period. The coloured urine showed positive occult blood 
reaction by urinary test paper and the frequency of the positive occult blood reaction was mostly dose 
related. However, erythrocytes were not observed in coloured urine and no haemorrhage was observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 26/154 
 
 
 
in the urinary tract in histopathology. In addition, no data suggestive of severe haemolysis leading to 
such urine colour was observed, or no corresponding changes related to myolysis were observed in 
blood chemistry or histopathology.  
To further evaluate the coloured urine, two separate studies were performed where effects of inorganic 
ions (Fe, Mg, Ca, Zn) on the coloration of cefiderocol sodium solutions were analysed, and also to test 
different cefiderocol solutions in an assay with urinary test paper. The conclusions of these analyses 
were that cefiderocol solutions form a complex with ferric ions which under basic conditions which 
results in a reddish solution colour. In addition, cefiderocol sodium affected the urinary test paper 
analysis and therefore urine which contains cefiderocol might cause false positive results depending on 
its concentration or urinary ph. Thus, while coloured urine and erythrocyte loss seems possible 
correlated, it seems that the coloured urine is artefactual and not related. 
It should however be noted that the margins to clinical exposure from NOAEL (100mg/kg/day in the 3-
month monkey study) is only 3-fold and 0.3-fold of the Cmax and AUC-values in humans respectively. 
Given no clear mechanism or reasonable explanation to the findings and that we have no reason to 
believe that this effect would not be present in human, anaemia is a potential adversity that may be 
become present in humans. However, so far no clinical study data have identified this effect in 
humans. 
Genotoxicity 
Based on a bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames test) using five tester strains (Salmonella 
typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537, and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA) it was concluded that 
cefiderocol has no potential to induce gene mutations. 
However, in a chromosomal aberration test that was performed in a human lymphoblast cell line 
(TK6), significant increases in the incidence of cells with structural chromosomal aberrations were 
found in the 24-hour assay, suggesting that cefiderocol has the potential to induce structural 
chromosomal aberrations.  
In addition, a positive response was noted In the Mouse lymphoma assay (MLA). The MLA can be used 
to evaluate potential of the cefiderocol sodium drug product to induce both gene mutation and 
chromosomal aberration as a wide variety of mutagenic events can lead to TFT resistance, including 
small mutations within the tk1 gene (genetic mutations), larger clastogenic chromosomal events within 
and beyond the tk1 gene. Mutant clones can have slow or more wild-type growth rates. The difference 
in mutant clone growth has been attributed to different mechanisms of DNA damage where 
chromosomal mutations extending beyond the TK gene produce small slow-growing mutant clones, 
and intragenic mutations produce large wild-type growing clones. The increase in MF at 400 μg/mL in 
the 24-hour continuous treatment was considered by the Applicant to be chromosomal aberration-
related under highly cytotoxic condition rather than due to point mutations since the percentage of 
small colonies, at 400 μg/mL (55.3%) was higher than that of the concurrent negative control values 
(38.8%), and the relative total growth rate at this dose level (22.0%) was close to the limit of 
evaluation due to cytotoxicity (20% of growth rate).  
However, because it has also been shown that small mutants can result from other mechanisms, 
mutant colony size should be used only as an indicator and not as a definitive measure of a chemical’s 
mode of mutagenic action. Given the negative (bacterial) Ames and a negative HPRT Gene Mutation 
Test in Chinese hamster lung cells, CHMP agreed that it was reasonable to assume no mutagenic 
potential of cefiderocol and that the modest positive response in the MLA assay was a false positive. 
Further follow-up studies included a negative in vivo micronucleus test and a negative comet assay. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 27/154 
 
 
 
the studies, the cefiderocol sodium drug product showed negative results at the highest dose level of 
2000 which was estimated to provide a 31-fold margin to clinical exposure. 
Collectively, positive results in the MLA and the chromosomal aberration test that was performed in a 
human lymphoblast cell line (TK6) are suggestive of possible chromosomal-aberration effects of 
cefiderocol sodium. However, given that other approved cephalosporins have shown a similar 
genotoxicity profile (i.e. non-mutagenic in Ames test, increased chromosomal aberrations in vitro but 
not considered clastogenic in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay and did not induce DNA damage in the 
Comet assay in rat hepatocytes) is it concluded by CHMP that the administration of cefiderocol for up 
to 14 days is unlikely to pose a genotoxic risk in humans. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted. CHMP agreed that carcinogenicity studies were not needed 
as the SmPC states that the duration of dosing will be generally 14 days or less (not exceeding 21 
days). In addition, intermittent dosing is not considered likely. 
Reproduction and developmental toxicity 
A full program of reproductive and developmental studies has been performed, which also included a 
3-week juvenile toxicity study in rats. Pale urine, infusion-site findings and dilatation of cecum were 
present throughout the studies in rats and mice with similar incidence and severity as in the repeated-
dose toxicity studies in rat. 
In the fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, no effects were noted on the 
reproductive or developmental parameters evaluated up to 1000mg/kg/day which was the highest 
dose tested. 
In the rat EFD-study, low food consumption and suppression of body weight gain (up to 40% 
suppression) was evident in dams exposed to 1000mg/kg/day on days 7-10 day 11-20 of gestation 
respectively. These are considered adverse. In addition, food-consumption was lower also in the 100 
and 300mg/kg/day dose-group on GD 7-8. However, these effects were of lower magnitude and 
without effects on bodyweight (or weight gain) and were not considered adverse. 
No malformations and few and scattered foetal variation findings were noted. Substantial reductions in 
maternal weight gain (or absolute weight loss) are frequently linked with other manifestations of 
developmental toxicity, such as decreased foetal weight, and skeletal anomalies (e.g., wavy ribs). In 
this study, the pup-weights were significantly reduced at the highest dose in females and a weight 
reduction trend was evident in male pups. Although statistically significant the weights measured are 
less than 5% different from the controls. When examined in the context of the historical control data, 
the mean of the 1000 mg/kg (3.63g) is actually higher than the historical control data mean (3.53 g). 
Thus, this effect is not considered biologically meaningful and the foetal NOAEL is 1000 mg/kg. 
Because of the effects on maternal bodyweight and weight-gain at 1000mg/kg, the maternal NOAEL is 
set to 300mg/kg/day.  
In the mouse EFD-study, suppression of body weight gain and low body weight were noted in all 
treated groups during the latter half of the gestation period, but this did apparently not translate into 
foetal toxicity. Low numbers of corpora lutea, implantations and live foetuses were observed in all test 
substance groups. However, according to the Applicant, these changes are unrelated to treatment, as 
the numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were determined before initiation of dosing of the test 
substance. This reduction in implantations and corpora lutea is also claimed by the Applicant to explain 
the reduced body-weight increase seen in the dams during the latter half of gestation. Considering the 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 28/154 
 
 
 
body-weight effects noted in the rat EFD dams during gestation, this explanation is not fully agreed 
upon by CHMP. However, it was noted that in mouse, no effects were noted on foetal weights. 
While it is unfortunate that the control animals (prior to treatment) had more implantations and 
corpora lutea than all the other groups prior to treatment just by chance, no malformations were noted 
and overall the findings noted are similar to the EFD study in rats. Considering the infusion-related 
findings at 2000 and 1000 mg/kg/day and the lack of embryo-foetal effects, the maternal and 
developmental NOAELs are 500mg/kg/day and 2000 mg/kg/day respectively. 
No toxicokinetic data were collected in the pre- and postnatal development study, which is surprising. 
While no adversities have been identified, there are no data to support appropriate exposure of the 
dams or to make an evaluation of the concentration levels of the substance transferred to the 
embryos/foetuses and pups.  
Maternal toxicities were noted which included injection site findings, effects on food consumption and 
bodyweight during the gestation period and dilatation of the cecum. All these effects have been noted 
previously in the toxicology program, including the findings of pale urine in all treated animals. The 
effects on food consumption in the 1000mg/kg/day group also translated to reductions in body weight 
and suppression of body-weight gain and is considered adverse. While significant effects on food-
consumption was noted also in the 100- and 300 mg/kg/day groups, no effects were noted on body 
weights, why these findings were not considered adverse. No F1-generation effects were identified 
neither prior to weaning nor after weaning, why the reproductive NOAEL is set to the highest dose. 
Juvenile toxicity 
Juvenile toxicity studies (DRF and pivotal) were performed in the rat using to cohorts (PND 7-13 and 
PND 28-34 for cohorts 1 and 2 respectively). The kidney is a target organ for toxicity (as is the case in 
adult rats), and the effects were more pronounced in cohort 1, where organ-weight increases (in both 
sexes with dose-relation from the lowest dose of 100mg/kg/day) correlated with microscopic findings 
in males and females of dose-relatedly altered proximal tubules consisting of small, cortical segments 
lined by tubular cells with expanded, pale, foamy to vacuolated cytoplasm. In addition, hyperplastic 
tubules were observed in 0, 1, 1, and 2 males administered 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/day of the 
test article. These tubules exhibited a minimal to marked proliferation of tubular epithelial cells, often 
in association with tubular cysts. While these findings mostly recovered (kidney- weight changes 
remained), and the Applicant argues that the findings are of spontaneous nature, they are considered 
adverse at the highest dose. In cohort 2 (with older animals), the kidney effects were overall milder 
(but the HD was limited to 600mg/kg/day) and histopathologically only correlated with increased 
hyaline droplets without any evidence of cell damage. 
FOB-assessments revealed some effects on behaviour in cohort 1 including significantly shorter mean 
time to the first step in the open-field analysis. In cohort 2, the Biel maze showed longer overall mean 
escape time for females in the 600 mg/kg/day group. However, CHMP agreed that the absence of a 
corresponding increase in the overall mean number of errors during this evaluation makes the finding 
of unclear significance and since all behavioural findings recovered, it was decided that these findings 
should not be further pursued. 
The mean age of attainment of vaginal patency was increased in the 1000 mg/kg/day group in cohort 
1 with 33.8 days compared to 32.0 days in controls. Mean body weight at the age of attainment was 
128.2 g in the same group compared to 120.8 g in the control group. According to the Applicant, the 
delay was slight, and the value was within the range of values (31.3 to 37.0 days). It is agreed that all 
data were within historical control data, suggesting that the control group was not markedly below 
historical controls. Thus, the effect is considered treatment-related why the NOAEL in cohort 1 is set to 
300mg/kg/day.

Toxicokinetic data 
The toxicokinetics of cefiderocol was almost linear in rats from 100 to 1500 mg/kg and in monkeys 
from 100 to 1000mg/kg after repeated intravenous cefiderocol sodium administration. In mice, the 
AUC of cefiderocol was almost linear from 500 to 2000 mg/kg/day (250 to 1000 mg/kg bid) after 
repeated subcutaneous administration in pregnant mice. Across all repeat-dose toxicology studies, 
cefiderocol sodium exposure was similar in male and female animals and no clear accumulation of 
cefiderocol sodium was observed with repeated administration. Since no human metabolites at or 
above 10% were identified, no specific safety assessment for metabolites has been performed. 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
A phototoxicity study was performed and submitted with this Application. However, there is no 
background to the decision to perform the study, neither in the non-clinical overview, nor in the 
toxicology summaries. The initial consideration for assessment of photoreactive potential is whether a 
compound absorbs light at a wavelength between 290 and 700nm. A compound with a MEC not 
greater than 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 is not considered photoreactive enough to result in phototoxicity. It is 
currently unclear if such an evaluation has been performed. Further, the 3T3 Neutral red Uptake 
phototoxicity test in vitro is considered the most appropriate assay to screen for phototoxicity, because 
it is animal sparing, it is a sensitive assay and a negative 3T3-assay would obviate the need for further 
phototoxicity studies. Performing an in vivo phototoxicity study in rats without prior absorption 
evaluation is considered a violation of the 3Rs principle. 
CHMP agreed that the in vivo study as such was appropriately conducted and the negative result 
indicates no phototoxicity potential of cefiderocol sodium. 
Antigenicity 
In an antigenicity study in Guinea pigs, anaphylactic reactions including the production of specific 
antibodies against cefiderocol were noted when adjuvated cefiderocol was used for immunization, but 
no such reactions were noted when immunization had been performed with cefiderocol sodium alone. 
Thus, while weak, antigenicity was noted for cefiderocol sodium under the conditions of this study. The 
relevance of this finding for clinical use of the product is unclear. No anaphylactic reactions have been 
reported in the clinical studies. Given the and a positive result only after adjuvant-stimulated 
immunization and the lack of clinical findings to date, the clinical relevance of this finding is considered 
low. 
Metabolites and Impurities 
No specific studies on metabolites were warranted, and none have been performed. However, several 
actual and potential impurities have been tested for mutagenic potential (Ames test). No comments 
have been provided in the non-clinical overview or toxicology summaries regarding how the MAH will 
handle the positive results for a number of impurities in table 21. It is anticipated that the levels of the 
impurities are limited in accordance with ICH M7 and that a full disposition is available in the quality 
section of the dossier. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, 01 December 2006) was submitted. Overall the submitted 
Assessment report

studies were appropriate. However, a few questions emerged during the assessment, which received 
further attention. Regarding the Water/sediment study (OECD 308), the Applicant was asked to 
normalise the reported DT50 values for parent compound and transformation products to 12°C. In 
accordance with ECHA, R 7b (2017) p.220: Simulation testing on soil, sediment and water: If 
information on degradation half-life is already available from existing simulation degradation tests 
performed at a higher temperature, they should be normalised to a half-life corresponding to 12°C by 
using the Arrhenius equation. In the response, the Applicant provided with DT50 values for unchanged 
cefiderocol and Met A and Met B which had been extrapolated to 12°C using the Arrhenius equation. 
However, the provided normalization to 12°C had been done using an outdated conversion factor (Q10 
= 2.2) which was considered not acceptable. For the normalization to 12°C, the Arrhenius equation 
with a specific activation energy Ea of 65.4 kJ/mol (current Q10 factor of 2.58) has to be used (see 
REACH R.7b, p. 222). The applicant was asked to provide the normalization of all DT50 values to 12 °C 
for Cefiderocol sulfate tosilate and the transformation product “Met A” according to the ECHA REACH 
guidance R.11 [version 3.0, June 2017], using the Arrhenius equation and the current conversion 
factor. The applicant updated the normalization values accordingly. The Transformation product “Met 
A” is mainly found in water and exceeds the persistence criterion > 40 d for water. Therefore, 
cefiderocol sulfate tosilate is persistent in water.  
The Applicant was asked to submit an updated ERA report which included the data provided in the 
answers to the final questions and any conclusions drawn. Further, regarding the Sediment-Water 
Chironomid Toxicity Test (OECD 218), taking into account that the substance concentrations are below 
80% of the nominal concentrations on day 0 and degradation of the test item occurs during the test 
period, mean measured concentrations should be used for the derivation of NOEC/LOEC. The Applicant 
was thus asked to derive LOEC/NOEC derivations based on mean concentrations. In the response, the 
geometric mean of the measured concentrations on days 0, 7 and 28 were used to update the RQ of 
sediment toxicity. The calculated RQ was 0.022 why it is agreed that cefiderocol is unlikely to 
represent a risk to sediment dwelling organisms. Further, all remaining data and conclusions were 
included in the revised ERA report.

2.3.5.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The PK of cefiderocol showed dose-linearity in rats, monkeys and humans. Cefiderocol is widely 
distributed in the body and is mainly excreted unchanged in urine in rats, monkeys and humans. 
Moreover, all the cefiderocol metabolites/degradation products identified are found below 10 % in 
serum in rats, monkeys and humans. Conclusively, in regards of PK, rats and monkeys are relevant 
species for toxicity studies. Safety concerns include convulsions (observed in rodents) and QT-
prolongation (observed in monkeys). 
The toxicity profile of cefiderocol has been characterized in a program appropriate for the intended 
patient population and proposed use of the product. Toxicities have been identified in the general 
toxicology program that may be of clinical relevance and which may require dose-adjustments for 
certain patient populations.  
Convulsions (at a margin of exposure to clinical exposure around 13x) were noted in rats, but not in 
monkeys. No mechanisms have been identified for this effect. While no findings were evident in 
monkey (up to 22x clinical exposure) and no clinical findings of convulsions have been identified to 
date, this is a serious toxicity. Interestingly, the timing of the convulsions in the 13-week rat study 
occurred at a time period covered in the previous 1-month study in which no similar notable effects 
were seen and at similar exposure levels. Thus, these intra-study inconsistencies do not support a 
clear relation to exposure (Cmax) or timing in the study. Therefore, during the assessment the 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 32/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Applicant was asked by CHMP to further elaborate on these issues. In the response, the applicant 
suggested that the differences seen are likely due to the systemic exposure achieved at 1000 and 1500 
mg/kg being close to the threshold for which convulsions can occur. Due to the variability between 
animals, some of the animals at the 1000 or 1500 mg/kg may have passed this threshold and 
experienced convulsions. Furthermore, it was argued that the incidence of convulsions was low in the 
3-month study and considering it had greater animals per group, overall there is not significant 
differences in the proconvulsive liability between the 1- and 3-month repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Based on the totality of the data, CHMP considered these arguments to be reasonable and accepted 
that the risk of convulsions for patients at the clinical dose is low. 
QTc-prolongations was observed in all studies in monkey and in the cardiac safety-pharmacology 
study. The exposure margin for the NOAEL for QTc-prolongation in the 3-month study (300mg/kg/day) 
compared to clinical exposure is around 7x. No cardiac arrythmias were observed throughout the 
study. Further, a clinical thorough QT study (at supra therapeutic dosing) did not find evidence for QTc 
prolongation.  
Effects on erythrocytes, haematocrit, and haemoglobin were evident in the cynomolgus studies from 
300mg/kg/day in the 3-month study and 1000mg/kg/day in the 1-month study. Increases in 
reticulocyte count and/or hyperplasia in the femoral or sternal bone marrow were also observed 
suggestive of a compensatory response. The margins to clinical exposure from NOAEL (100mg/kg/day 
in the 3-month monkey study) is only 3-fold and 0.3-fold of the Cmax and AUC-values in humans 
respectively No evidence for haemorrhagic lesions or haemolysis have been found, and no likely 
mechanism for the effect has been identified. Given no clear mechanism or reasonable explanation to 
the findings and that we have no reason to believe that this effect would not be present in human, 
anaemia is a potential adversity that may become present in humans. 
A complete package of genotoxicity studies was completed by the Applicant, including follow-up studies 
to further evaluate positive in-vitro clastogenicity findings. Collectively, positive results in the MLA and 
the chromosomal aberration test was performed in a human lymphoblast cell line (TK6) are suggestive 
of possible chromosomal-aberration effects of cefiderocol sodium. But given that other approved 
cephalosporins have shown a similar genotoxicity profile (i.e. non-mutagenic in Ames test, increased 
chromosomal aberrations in vitro but not considered clastogenic in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay 
and did not induce DNA damage in the Comet assay in rat hepatocytes) is it concluded that 
administration of cefiderocol for up to 14 days is unlikely to pose a genotoxic risk in humans.  
In conclusion, CHMP considered the nonclinical program provided for cefiderocol as adequate for this 
marketing authorisation application.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of cefiderocol was evaluated in 6 clinical pharmacology studies and 8 in vitro studies. A 
population PK analysis using data from two Clinical Pharmacology studies (Studies R2111 and R2113), 
the Phase 2 study in subjects with cUTIs (cUTI Study), and the phase III CREDIBLE-CR and APEKS-NP 
studies was performed. 
Methods 
Bioanalysis 
An LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of cefiderocol upon treatment with ammonium acetate pH 
5 buffer was validated for human plasma, urine, ultrafiltrate, haemodialysis dialysate, epithelial lining 
fluid (ELF) and alveolar macrophages. Of note, the method is validated for 1% but not 2% haemolytic 
plasma. Where available, ISR criteria were met.

Evaluation and qualification of models 
The initial models were based on two Phase 1 studies (2111 and 2113) and the data obtained from 
APEKS-UTI (2121). A subsequent model (CPK-002-B) incorporated data from CREDIBLE-CR. The final 
pop PK model (CPK-004-B) incorporated data of all studies (including APEKS-NP) with a total of 3427 
valid observations from 516 subjects. 9.6% of data were BQL and were previously excluded. 
Non-linear mixed effects modelling was used to build a population PK model using NONMEM. The data 
was best described with a 3-compartment model with CrCL (Cockcroft-Gault) as renal function marker. 
An exponential error model was used for interindividual variability, and proportional error model was 
used for intraindividual variability. During model development, renal function, body weight, age, sex, 
ALB, AST, ALT, BIL, race, infection, and ventilation were tested as a covariate on CL, and body weight, 
age, sex, ALB, race, infection, and ventilation were tested as a covariate on V1. Body weight data were 
tested as a covariate on other PK parameters (Q2 and V2). The parameter estimates for the base and 
final model are shown in the table below: 
Table 1: Population PK parameter estimates for the final model 
As depicted in Figure 1, CrCL was the most significant covariate on CL, and time-varying CrCL was a 
better predictor than baseline CrCL. The other significant covariates were: body weight on V1 and V2, 
and infection on CL and V1, and albumin on V1.

Monte-Carlo simulations with 1000 virtual patients per subgroup were performed for PTA analyses. 
75% fT>MIC was identified as the PD driver for efficacy (1 log kill) in preclinical studies and 90% PTA 
at MIC is the selected cut-off. Regarding the relevant MIC, please refer to the pending EUCAST 
decision. 
Absorption 
Not applicable as cefiderocol is administered by i.v. infusion. 
Distribution 
After administration of a single 2-g dose of cefiderocol infused over 3 hours, the geometric mean 
volume of distribution during the terminal elimination phase (Vz) (CV%) was 18.0 L (18.1%) (Study 
R2116). 
The plasma protein binding ratios for cefiderocol over concentrations of 1 to 1000 µg/mL ranged from 
40.8% to 60.4% (study R-649266-PF-037-L). 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 38/154 
 
 
 
 
In the mass balance study (R2114), the total radioactivity concentration in whole blood was half of that 
in plasma (approximating the physiologic ratio of plasma to whole blood), indicating that total 
radioactivity was predominantly associated with plasma, with little partitioning into red blood cells. The 
whole blood/plasma partitioning ratio was approximately 0.54. 
Study 1214R2112 evaluated the concentrations of cefiderocol in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and 
alveolar macrophages (AM) using bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage following a single 2g 
intravenous administration (1h) of cefiderocol in 20 healthy Japanese adult male subjects. The 
geometric mean concentration ratios of ELF to plasma over 6 hours ranged from 0.0927 to 0.116 
indicating a low distribution (ca 10 %) to ELF relative to plasma concentrations. 
Elimination 
Figure 4: Percent of dose identified in urine and faeces following administration of 14C-
cefiderocol (Study R2114) 
The terminal half-life of cefiderocol is approximately 2 to 3 hours in healthy volunteers (study R2111 
and R2116).  
Based on data from the mass balance study, the main route of elimination for cefiderocol is renal 
excretion of unchanged drug. Following a single infusion of [14C]-cefiderocol over 1 hour, the majority 
of total radioactivity was excreted unchanged in urine (98.6% as total radioactivity; 90.6% as 
unchanged) with a negligible amount excreted in faeces (2.8% as total radioactivity). Urine data from 
study R2111 and R2113 also support renal excretion of unchanged drug as main elimination pathway 
for cefiderocol. In faeces, the M2 component (PCBA, a degradation product) was the predominant 
radioactive component and accounted for 1.69% of the administered dose. (Study R2114).  
The renal clearance was 3.24 L/h in healthy volunteers in study R2113. In study R2111 the renal 
clearance was reported to be 3.03-4.06 L/h in the single dose part and 3.73-4.36 L/h in the multiple 
dose part. Filtration (fu*GFR) is expected to be around 3-4 L/h. Thus, there is no indication of active 
renal secretion of cefiderocol. 
No major metabolites were detected in plasma. Unchanged drug was the main compound found in 
plasma and accounted for 92% of the total radioactivity (0-16 hours). The M2 component (PCBA, a 
degradation product) accounted for 4.70%, and other minor metabolites each accounted for < 2% of 
Assessment report

the plasma AUC0-16 for total radioactivity. Similar metabolite profiles were detected in the in vitro 
studies (albeit with an inconsistent designation) and there were no human specific metabolites. 
Cefiderocol has two chiral centres at its β lactam moiety. Interconversion in vivo to the possible S-
649266-7-epi and S-649266-anti structures has been demonstrated to be negligible. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The results of study R2111 and study R2116 indicate dose-proportionality of cefiderocol in the dose 
range of 100 mg to 4000 mg.  
In the single dose part of study R2111, single doses in the dose range of 100 mg to 2000 mg given via 
60 minutes infusion were studied and the slope estimates of AUC and Cmax were close to 1 and there 
was no indication of dose-dependent changes in t1/2, CL or CLr. In the multiple dose part of study 
R2111, doses of 1000 and 2000 mg were studied. Ratios of Cmax and AUC0-τ between dose groups on 
Day 10 were close to the ratio of dose (ie, 2), suggesting dose-proportional increase in Cmax and 
AUC0-τ following multiple dose. Dose-proportionality was also investigated in study R2116, where 
cefiderocol was given as 3-hour infusions, which is the recommended dosage time. The Cmax and AUC 
of cefiderocol increased in a dose-proportional manner after administration of single 3- and 4-g doses 
(Part 1) and 2- and 4-g doses (Part 2) of cefiderocol, infused over 3 hours. Half-life and clearance 
estimates remained fairly consistent across the doses. The results are summarised in Table 2. 
Table 2: Summary of Cefiderocol PK Parameters in study R2116 
There was no significant accumulation of cefiderocol at steady state, since the geometric mean 
accumulation ratio for Cmax and AUC in the multiple-dose part of study R2111 were from 1.069 to 
1.084 and 1.053 to 1.164, respectively. There are no indications of time-dependent pharmacokinetics 
since CL did not change between day 1 and day 10 and since AUCinf following first dose was similar to 
AUC0-τ at steady state. 
Interindividual variability on Cmax and AUC ranged from 13-21 %CV and 14-17% in healthy 
individuals, and 41-53% and 45-60% in patients, respectively. Interindividual variability on CL, V1 and 
V2 is presented in Table 1. Intra-individual variability estimated were not provided, because estimation 
of multiple Cmax or AUC values per subject were not performed for each subject population and each 
dose regimen.

Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Infections are significant covariates on cefiderocol PK, but the PK in patients is described with the same 
model as healthy volunteers PK. 
The final model suggested CL in patients with cUTI/AUP in the phase 2 study was 27% higher than that 
in subjects without infection. The CL in patients with cUTI (CREDIBLE-CR study), BSI/sepsis, or 
HAP/VAP/HCAP were suggested to be comparable to that in subjects without infection.  
The final model also suggested V1 in patients with infection was 39% higher than that in subjects 
without infection. Although the effect of infection site was a covariate on CL and V1, individual Cmax 
and daily AUC overlapped among infection sites (see Figure 1).  
The effect of ventilation was not a covariate on cefiderocol PK and the post-hoc estimates of Cmax and 
daily AUC were similar between HAP/VAP/HCAP patients with and without ventilation. 
The geometric mean values of estimates of Cmax and daily AUC in all patients with infection are 
presented in Table 3. The Cmax values in patients were similar to those in healthy subjects, but the 
daily AUC in patients was higher than in healthy subjects (Cmax of 89.7 µg/mL and daily AUC of 1158 
[ = AUC0-inf 386.1 × 3] µg·hr/mL, Study R2116). The Cmax and daily AUC values overlapped among 
survival cases and death cases in the phase 3 studies, and survival cases in the phase 2 study. The 
daily AUC value in one death case in the CREDIBLE-CR study (patient with cUTI and moderate renal 
impairment) was higher than the maximum AUC in survival cases.

Impaired renal function 
The effect of impaired renal function was studied in a dedicated phase I study in subjects with varying 
degree of renal impairment (study R2113) who received a fixed dose of 1 g of cefiderocol infused over 
1 hour. A summary of the pharmacokinetic parameters of cefiderocol in the different groups is given in 
Table 4 with statistical analysis in Table 5.  
Not reflected in Table 4 and Table 5 is that HD removed 62.3% of cefiderocol.

Renal function was also investigated as a covariate in the population PK analyses and dose 
recommendations for different renal functions (including augmented clearance) have been proposed 
based on 90% PTA analysis for 75% fT>MIC.  
Impaired hepatic function 
Because results of the Mass Balance Study (Study R2114) showed that cefiderocol is primarily (more 
than 90%) excreted unchanged in the urine, a study to assess the potential effect of hepatic 
impairment on the PK of cefiderocol was not considered to be necessary and was therefore not 
conducted.

Albumin was a significant covariate on V1 of cefiderocol but estimated steady-state Cmax and daily 
AUC were similar between patients with and without hypoalbuminaemia (albumin concentration < 2.8 
or ≥ 2.8 g/dL) suggesting the effect of albumin was not clinically significant.  
Weight 
No dedicated study to assess the effect of body weight on cefiderocol PK was performed. The 
population PK analyses of cefiderocol showed that body weight was a significant covariate on V1 and 
V2. The geometric mean CL values for the categorised body weight range (< 55, 55 to < 70, 70 to < 
90, and ≥ 90 kg) in patients were 3.20, 3.75, 4.54, and 4.61 L/hr, respectively. The geometric mean 
values of Bayesian estimated V1 for categorised body weight range (< 55, 55 to < 70, 70 to < 90, and 
≥ 90 kg) in patients were 10.0, 9.94, 11.6, and 13.6 L, respectively. The V1 was higher in patients 
with a body weight ≥ 90 kg than in patients with a body weight < 90 kg. However, the Monte-Carlo 
simulations demonstrated a high PTA was also achieved in patients with a body weight ≥ 90 kg of body 
weight and therefore no cefiderocol dose adjustment based on body weight is required.   
Gender, race and age 
No dedicated study to assess the effect of gender, race or age on cefiderocol PK was performed. The 
population PK analyses showed that they were not significant covariates on cefiderocol PK. Differences 
in CL among age groups was attributed to the difference in renal function for the different age groups, 
as age negatively correlates with renal function. 
No studies were performed in paediatric patients.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effect of other medicines on cefiderocol 
Due to very low metabolic turnover, cefiderocol has a low potential for victim drug drug interactions.  
In the in vitro studies using human transporter expressing cells, cefiderocol is not a substrate for 
OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, P-gp, or BCRP. Therefore, coadministration of inhibitors or 
inducers of these transporters is expected to have no impact on the PK of cefiderocol. 
Iron does not influence the cefiderocol PK.  
Effect of cefiderocol on other medicines 
Cefiderocol does not show concentration- or time-dependent inhibition to CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 by cefiderocol at concentrations 1330 μmol/L (1000 µg/mL as cefiderocol) and up 
to 5320 μmol/L (4000 µg/mL as cefiderocol) for CYP2C8. 
No significant induction of CYP1A2, and 2B6 by cefiderocol was shown in human hepatocytes. 
Induction of CYP 3A4 was however observed in vitro. 
Cefiderocol was not an inhibitor of PgP, OATP1B1, MATE1, P-gp, BCRP, and BSEP at clinically relevant 
concentrations (50x Cmax,u 2500 µM). Cefiderocol is thus not expected to affect the PK of 
coadministered drugs that are substrates of these transporters.

As cefiderocol showed the potential for a DDI with substrates of the OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, 
OATP1B3, and MATE2-K transporters, a clinical DDI study was conducted to investigate the potential 
inhibitory effects of cefiderocol on the PK of substrates for these various transporters.  
The in vivo studies with furosemide (substrate of OAT1 and OAT3) and metformin (substrate of OCT1, 
OCT2, and MATE2K) showed no increase in AUC upon coadministration with cefiderocol. In the study 
with rosuvastatin (substrate of OATP1B3), AUCR was slightly elevated (Figure 4), which was not 
clinically significant.

Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
After administration of a single 2-g dose of cefiderocol infused over 3 hours, the geometric mean 
(percent coefficient of variation [CV%] Geometric Mean) Cmax and AUC0-inf values were 89.7 µg/mL 
(20.5%) and 386.1 µg·hr/mL (17.2%), respectively (Study R2116). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Introduction 
This section highlights the studies that describe the in vitro activity of cefiderocol and the most 
important studies and analyses for dose selection. It should be noted that because of the limited 
clinical development programme performed for this product in keeping with what is described in the 
Addendum to the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial 
infections (EMA/CHMP/351889/2013) for products that are candidates to address an unmet medical 
need, the PK/PD analyses incorporating non-clinical PK/PD data and patient PK data are considered 
pivotal for dose justification for the proposed indication. 
Mechanism of action 
Cefiderocol is a catechol substituted siderophore cephalosporin β-lactam antibacterial agent that 
inhibits bacterial cell-wall synthesis by targeting penicillin-binding proteins (mainly PBP3). The bacterial 
entry of cefiderocol differs from authorised β-lactams. Cefiderocol binds to ferric iron via its catechol 
moiety forming a chelating complex. This allows cefiderocol to be actively transported into the 
periplasmic space through siderophore uptake systems in addition to passive diffusion through outer 
membrane porin channels. The catechol group is also assumed to be the cause of enhanced stability of 
cefiderocol to both serine- and metallo-type β-lactamases. 
The stability of cefiderocol against class A to D β-lactamases including carbapenemases seems to be a 
result of relatively high Km and/or lower kcat. In addition, cefiderocol had low ability of chromosomal 
AmpC induction. Moreover, cefiderocol has been found to be able to circumvent innate bacterial 
permeability barriers such as the overproduction of multidrug efflux pumps and the loss of outer 
membrane porins which are known methods for antibacterial penetration, according to studies using 
genetically modified P. aeruginosa strains. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology

In vitro activity studies 
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing 
Methodology for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of cefiderocol in iron-depleted cation-adjusted 
Mueller-Hinton broth (ID-CAMHB) approved by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 
was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefiderocol. Iron concentration 
in excess of 0.03 mg/L resulted in an upward shift of the MIC of cefiderocol. The sensitivity of the 
cefiderocol MIC methodology to changes in the iron concentration of growth medium is considered to 
be due to differences in the level of induction of iron transporters in the outer membrane of bacteria 
under iron-depleted conditions compared to iron-replete conditions. According to the Applicant the low 
concentration of free iron available for bacterial growth in ID-CAMHB, better reflects the physiological 
environment found at the site of bacterial infections. PK/PD analysis of the in vivo efficacy of 
Assessment report

cefiderocol in neutropenic murine thigh/lung infection models caused by strains which have different 
MICs between CAMHB and ID-CAMHB indicated that the MIC determined in ID-CAMHB had a better 
correlation with in vivo efficacy than the MIC determined in CAMHB. 
Antibacterial spectrum 
The antibacterial spectrum of cefiderocol includes mainly Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting 
bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia and 
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Cefiderocol lacks clinically relevant activity against Gram-positive 
bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. 
The table below summarises susceptibility data for key pathogens from randomly collected clinical 
isolates from three multi-national surveillance studies and one multi-national surveillance study 
including Proteeae isolates only. Cefiderocol had MIC90 values up to 2 mg/L against various Gram-
negative bacteria other than B. multivorans (belonging to B. cepacia complex with an MIC90 of 32 
mg/L).

g  Burkholderia spp. was excluded. 
The activity of cefiderocol against various carbapenemase-producers collected in the SIDERO-CR-
2014/2016 study was evaluated using molecularly characterised meropenem-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae (n=1021) and meropenem non-susceptible P. aeruginosa (n=262) and A. 
baumannii (n=368). In summary, cefiderocol had a MIC90 of ≤ 4 mg/L against Enterobacteriaceae 
producing KPC, VIM and OXA-48-like carbapenemase, P. aeruginosa producing VIM and A. baumannii 
producing OXA-23 type carbapenemase. The cefiderocol MIC90 was 8 mg/L for NDM-producing 
Enterobacteriaceae and OXA-24/40-like carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii. In addition, 
cefiderocol MICs were ≤ 4 mg/L against P. aeruginosa producing IMP, GES, and NDM and A. baumannii 
producing OXA-58.

Resistance to cefiderocol 
Resistance in surveillance studies 
From the 9205 isolates tested in the SIDERO-WT 2014 study, 38 isolates with elevated MIC values for 
cefiderocol (≥ 8 mg/L) were further characterised. The activity of cefiderocol against 33/38 isolates 
was significantly enhanced by the addition of avibactam (AVI), a serine-type β-lactamase inhibitor 
which suggests that elevated MICs were in part due to the presence of an unknown β-lactamase 
enzyme. The remaining 5 isolates contained NDM-1, a metallo-β-lactamase that is not inhibited by 
avibactam. Among these 33 isolates, 24 were A. baumannii isolates from Russia or Turkey and 
contained the PER-1 β-lactamase. However, cefiderocol demonstrated good activity against other PER-
1 producing isolates with a MIC90 of 4 mg/L. Against the remaining 5 NDM-producers (also from 
Turkey), addition of both AVI and the metallo-type β-lactamase inhibitor, dipicolinic acid (DPA), 
enhanced the activity of cefiderocol. These results further suggest that presence of NDM-1 and some 
serine-type β-lactamases such as PER-1 may contribute to elevated cefiderocol MICs in clinical isolates. 
Similar characteristics were also observed when assessing 26 isolates with cefiderocol MIC ≥ 8 mg/L 
from the multi-national surveillance study SIDERO-CR-2014/2016. 
Frequency of spontaneous resistance 
The frequency of spontaneous resistance of E. coli, E. cloacae, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa (8 
strains in total) in the presence of 10 × MIC of cefiderocol was determined. If resistant mutants were 
isolated, the in vitro activity of cefiderocol against the mutant strains was determined and compared to 
the susceptibility of the parent strains. The magnitude of the order of frequency of the resistance for 
cefiderocol was 10−7 to 10−8 except for P. aeruginosa for which the frequency ranged from 10−6 to 
10−8. Cefiderocol MIC increase was shown to be associated with the mutation in the upstream region of 
pvdS (pyoverdine synthesis gene) and fadD3 (fatty acyl-CoA synthetase) in P. aeruginosa, and baeS, 
envZ, ompR (all are 2-component signal transduction gene), and exbD (biopolymer transport gene) in 
K. pneumoniae. 
Resistance acquisition assay by serial passage 
Resistance acquisition was evaluated for K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa (5 strains in total) by a 10 
times serial passage in two different media. The MIC of cefiderocol increased in general 1 to 4-fold but 
for one strain up to 8-fold. 
Resistant acquisition by using an in vitro pharmacodynamic model 
To estimate the risk of emergence of cefiderocol-resistant mutants during the treatment of patients, in 
vitro PD models simulating the free concentration-time curves in human plasma was used. The 
simulated concentration-time curves were determined for a 2-g cefiderocol q8h administration with 3-
hour infusion, 2-g/0.5 g CAZ/AVI q8h administration with 2-hour infusion, and 1-g MEPM q8h 
administration with 1-hour infusion. Against all 3 strains, cefiderocol showed rapid bacterial reduction 
within 4 hours. Regrowth was observed for one strain, but no growth was observed with a MIC of ≥ 10 
mg/L and no resistant colonies to cefiderocol were detected at the 24- and 72-hour time points. 
Emergence of resistance in the clinical studies 
In the cUTI study there were 7 subjects in the Micro-ITT population with an increase in cefiderocol MIC 
of at least 4-fold from baseline in the cefiderocol group. For all but one subject infected with P. 
aeruginosa that had a MIC of 8 mg/L at follow-up all isolates´ post-baseline MICs were at least two 
dilutions below the proposed susceptibility breakpoint of 4 mg/L (E. coli in 3 subjects and E. cloacae, E. 
aerogenes and P. mirabilis in one subject each). 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 49/154 
 
 
 
In the CREDIBLE-CR study there were also seven subjects in the Micro-ITT population with an increase 
in MIC to cefiderocol of at least 4-fold from baseline in the cefiderocol group. The pathogens that 
showed the increases in MIC from baseline values at either EOT or TOC were: A. baumannii in 2 
subjects, K. pneumoniae in 1 subject, P. aeruginosa in 2 subjects, and S. maltophilia in 2 subjects. All 
except 1 had an MIC value of ≤ 2 mg/L at EOT or TOC. One subject with an isolate of A. baumannii 
had an MIC of >64 mg/L at TOC. 
Effects of human body fluids and other factors on in vitro activity of cefiderocol 
The effect of various factors on the in vitro activity of cefiderocol was examined against 4 Gram-
negative bacteria. The MIC of cefiderocol was increased by high inoculum size for all four strains tested 
and by acidic pH and high iron content for three out of four strains. For one strain of P. aeruginosa MIC 
testing in 10% pulmonary surfactant and in 50% human serum resulted in a 4-fold and 10-fold 
increase in MIC, respectively, whereas minimal effects were seen for the other strains tested. For one 
strain of A. baumannii MIC testing in 80% urine resulted in a nearly 10-fold increase in MIC. 
In vivo 
Cefiderocol evaluated in animal models of infection 
The therapeutic efficacy of cefiderocol has been assessed using various animal infection models. Type 
of infection model, test organisms, dosages and cefiderocol MICs. 
Throughout these animal studies, cefiderocol showed dose-dependent bacterial reductions in each 
infection site. In the murine thigh model simulated human PK resulted in >2 log10 kill for all but one 
strain for which the colony count however was reduced by >1 log10. 
In in vivo efficacy studies conducted with other siderophore β-lactams such as MB-1 and SMC-3176 
adaptive resistance phenotypes have been observed. No adaptive resistance phenotypes were 
observed with cefiderocol in similar studies. 
In the rat model of pneumonia, an enhanced efficacy of cefiderocol was observed with a prolonged 
infusion (from 1-hour to 3-hour infusion) at the same dosage of 2 g, human dose regimen suggesting 
that cefiderocol efficacy could be correlated with the %fT>MIC values. 
Control antibacterial agents were included in all the in vivo studies. A disparity was noted in the lung 
infection model between the in vitro and in vivo activities of meropenem and CAZ/AVI against metallo-
type β-lactamase producing strains with significant CFU reductions despite high MICs. It has previously 
been hypothesised that the in vivo expression of MBLs may not be enough in murine lung infection 
models (Zmartlicka et al, 2015). 
Support for dose selection 
The principal support for dose selection was based on nonclinical PK/PD studies to determine the PK/PD 
index best correlated with cefiderocol efficacy, the magnitude of that PK/PD index (or PK/PD target) 
required for 1-log10 CFU reductions in murine thigh or lung infections, and Monte-Carlo simulations 
using human population PK model to determine the probability of target attainment in plasma and 
epithelial lining fluid (ELF) at different MICs for subjects with various degree of renal function. 
Dose fractionation studies for cefiderocol in a neutropenic murine thigh infection model confirmed that 
consistent with other β-lactam antibacterials T>MIC was the PK/PD index best correlated with in vivo 
efficacy with the highest coefficient of determination (R2) and lowest value of residual sum of squares 
(RSS).

Figure PD1.  Determination of PK/PD index best correlated with in vivo efficacy from a

The magnitude of the %fT>MIC required for bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects was determined in 
murine thigh or lung infection models caused by a total of 23 strains of Gram-negative bacilli with 
divergent MICs including 18 carbapenem-resistant strains. 
The %fT>MIC values required for efficacy in the lung infection model was slightly smaller than that of 
the neutropenic murine thigh infection model. There was a fairly wide range of both static and cidal 
values within and between bacterial species.

The %fT>MIC value of 75% which was the mean PK/PD target required to achieve 1-log10 reduction 
determined in the neutropenic thigh model was initially used in the PTA estimations (table below). 
Cefiderocol concentrations in ELF were estimated based on the ELF:plasma (free) ratio of 0.239 
derived from the intrapulmonary PK study conducted in healthy subjects who received a 2-g dose with 
1-hour infusion. In the PTA estimations depicted below all available PK data was used.

Other issues 
Susceptibility testing breakpoints 
Susceptibility interpretive criteria were set for Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa (2/2 mg/L, 
respectively). The EUCAST believed there was insufficient evidence to set breakpoints for A. baumannii 
and S. maltophilia due to the low number of clinical cases and the low response rate despite the high 
degree of in vitro activity against these species. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
The in vitro combination activities of cefiderocol with other commercially available antibacterial agents 
have been evaluated. No antagonism was observed in the checkerboard or fixed concentration studies 
between cefiderocol and other antibiotics such as vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, clindamycin, 
metronidazole, tigecycline, CAZ/AVI, CEF/TAZ, and colistin, or in the time-kill studies using a 
combination of cefiderocol with meropenem, amikacin, or ciprofloxacin against KPC-producing K. 
pneumoniae, MDR P. aeruginosa, and MDR A. baumannii. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect in the clinical studies 
The relationship between the %fT>MIC and efficacy was evaluated for patients in the APEKS-cUTI, the 
CREDIBLE-CR and the APEKS-NP studies. No PK/PD relationships were identified for any of efficacy 
responses (composite, clinical or microbiological response).

The applicant has performed a clinical pharmacology program to describe the pharmacokinetics and 
elimination of cefiderocol, and to identify special populations and drug interactions with risks for 
altered drug exposure. 
Methods 
Iron chelation is prevented by acid treatment during sample preparation, which gives access to robust 
bioanalytics in all tested matrices except 2% haemolytic plasma. All provided bioanalysis methods 
were adequately validated for the intended purpose.  
Given the small number of patients in the phase III CREDIBLE study, pop PK based probability of 
target attainment (PTA) analyses and simulations are pivotal. The first pop PK model is also the base 
for all dose recommendations for RI and different dialysis types. The models were considered adequate 
for PTA simulations. 
The final POPPK model was a 3-compartment linear model with the effects of CrCL and infection on CL; 
the effects of body weight, albumin and infection on V1; and the effect of body weight on V2. PK 
parameters were estimated with good precision (%RSE<20%). The inter-individual variability for 
parameters reduced from the base model to the final model and there was an improvement in the 
diagnostic plots for the final model compared to the base model, with no major trends. By inspection of 
the pcVPCs, the predictive performance of the model appears reasonable.  
The estimated exponents on BW are acceptable for an adult population. For future paediatric 
application, it should be considered to use theoretical allometric scaling.  
Overall, the updated popPK model is considered adequate to use for PTA simulations. The parameter 
estimates and PTA simulations were generally consistent with earlier models. The previous conclusions 
regarding the posology based on renal function are valid. 
Distribution 
Regarding distribution to lungs, the ELF study seems adequately performed. Single dose data is 
considered acceptable as no accumulation is seen following repeated dosing and the ELF concentration 
profile appeared to be parallel to the plasma concentration. The geometric mean concentration ratios 
of ELF to plasma over 6 hours ranged from 0.0927 to 0.116 indicating a low distribution to ELF relative 
to plasma concentrations. An additional Phase 1b study, (ELF study, Study 1713R2117) in hospitalised 
subjects with bacterial pneumonia on treatment with standard of care antibiotics and requiring 
mechanical ventilation has been initiated and may further elucidate lung penetration.  
The applicant has re-estimated the ELF to plasma ratio to be 24% based on free drug in plasma. The 
applicant reports that this adjusted penetration ratio of cefiderocol into ELF is comparable to that of 
ceftazidime (0.229 based on free drug in plasma using protein unbound fraction of 0.9), which is 
approved for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia. This estimate is based on data reported in the 
literature dating back >15 years. Furthermore, it is not just the ELF to plasma ratio that determines 
efficacy but the PDT in ELF (which is unknown for either drug) and any effects there may be of ambient 
conditions, such as pH. Therefore, just because the derived ratios are comparable does not necessarily 
mean that these agents will be similarly efficacious. Thus, even if the applicant’s derived ratio of 24% 
is taken at face value, it raises some concern for use of cefiderocol to treat infections in the lungs when 
Assessment report

there are no clinical data available to support this. During the assessment, the applicant provided data 
from the APEKS-NP study, see clinical efficacy assessment. 
Regarding the protein binding in ELF: based on literature, the applicant considers the protein binding in 
ELF to be low. This may be true, but no consideration is taken for the iron chelating properties of 
cefiderocol and their possible impact on protein binding in patients ELF. No new data could be 
provided, therefore the use of total concentration is still to be viewed as the best case scenario in the 
PTA analyses. 
Elimination 
The main elimination pathway of cefiderocol is renal excretion of unchanged drug. No major 
metabolites were detected in plasma, and there are no metabolites that need to be screened for 
enzyme inhibitory potential.  
Based on the low concentrations/amounts of metabolites in plasma, there is no need for a detailed 
presentation of metabolite PK. 
Dose-proportionality, time dependence & inter-individual variability 
The results of study R2111 and study R2116 indicate dose-proportionality of cefiderocol in the dose 
range of 100 mg to 4000 mg.  
There was no significant accumulation of cefiderocol at steady state. There are no indications of time-
dependent pharmacokinetics. 
Inter individual variability on Cmax and AUC was < 30% in healthy volunteers and 41-60% in patients. 
The lack of intra-individual variability data is acceptable. 
Target population 
The PK in the target population could be described using the same population PK model as for the 
healthy individuals, using renal function as a covariate. The infection status was however significant 
covariates as well.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment and augmented renal clearance 
The results of the dedicated renal impairment study showed a significant effect of renal function on the 
pharmacokinetics of cefiderocol, which is expected for a substance that is predominantly renally 
excreted.  
The proposed dosage adjustment for renally impaired patients is not based directly on the results of 
the RI study but on population-PK models and Monte Carlo simulations of PTA. During model 
development, different renal function markers were tested (CrCL, adjusted eGFR and absolute eGFR) 
and were found to simulate similar PTA. The proposed posology in section 4.2. of the SPC is based on 
Cockcroft-Gault CrCL which is supported. 
Regarding safety in renally impaired patients, the prosed doses lead to similar AUC across the different 
renal impairment groups which is adequate from a PK perspective. Regarding efficacy in renally 
impaired patients, the reader is referred to the PD section where the PTA analyses are presented and 
assessed. 
A dosage adjustment in patients with augmented renal clearance is also suggested from 120 ml/min. 
The upper limit of 200 ml/min used for PTA simulations reflects the target patient population. Only 8 
patients had CrCL > 200 ml/min in CREDIBLE-CR, and their cefiderocol clearance did not necessarily 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 57/154 
 
 
 
correlate with their renal function. Therefore, the unique dosing regimen for augmented clearance 
without upper cut-off is acceptable.  
Hepatic impairment, gender, race & age 
No hepatic impairment study is necessary, since hepatic impairment is not considered likely to 
significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of cefiderocol based on the results from the mass balance 
study. No cefiderocol dose adjustment is necessary for subjects with hepatic impairment. 
No dedicated study to assess the effect of gender, race or age on cefiderocol PK was performed. It is 
agreed that no dose adjustment other than based on the renal function is required in these 
populations, as shown by the population PK models.  
The POPPK model evaluated effects on cefiderocol CL and V1 by age. The CL was lower in older 
subjects with infection (≥ 85 years) and the V1 was similar in all age groups. The applicant concluded 
that the difference in CL reflected age-related change in CrCL. Hence it was considered to adjust dose 
by CrCL and not by age per se, which is further supported by safety data. 
Body weight 
It is agreed that despite of BW being a significant covariate, PTA is similar in patients ≥ 90kg to normal 
weight patients. Thus, no dose adjustment based on body weight is required, provided a cut-off of 4 
µg/mL MIC.  
Interactions 
Effect of other medicines on cefiderocol 
In the in vitro studies using human transporter expressing cells, cefiderocol is not a substrate for 
OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, P-gp, or BCRP. Therefore, coadministration of inhibitors of these 
transporters is expected to have no impact on the PK of cefiderocol, in particular since it is eliminated 
by renal filtration. 
Effect of cefiderocol on other medicines 
CYP inhibition experiments were performed with cefiderocol concentrations up to 1330 µM, except for 
CYP2C8 (5320 µM). 1330 µM is lower than 50 times Cmax,u (2500 µM) and the study is thus formally 
not compliant with the guideline. AUCR calculations using the mechanistic static model however 
suggest that no in vivo studies are required, which is acceptable. 
The CYP induction study design was appropriate with adequate model substrates and inducers. The 
applicant did not investigate protein binding in the induction experiment, which is acceptable since it 
was run under serum-free conditions.  
The applicant´s conclusion that no significant induction of CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 by cefiderocol was 
shown are agreed to for CYP 1A2 and 2B6. For CYP 3A4 however, it is considered that cefiderocol 
shows an induction potential in vitro that requires an in vivo study with a sensitive CYP 3A4 substrate 
unless justified using the in vitro RIS correlation approach (GL on the investigation of drug interactions 
section 5.3.3.2, A2). These data will be provided post approval (recommendation). 
Furthermore, since a signal for PXR mediated induction of CYP3A4 has been seen, the caution wording 
in section 4.5  was expanded to substrates of other relevant PXR inducible proteins, for example the 
CYP2C family and PgP. The applicant will be able to remove this wording if the PXR mediated induction 
of CYP3A4 is deemed nonsignificant in vivo.

The choice of substrates and inhibitors and their concentrations in the transporters studies is 
considered adequate. The concentration of cefiderocol in the transport inhibition studies was adequate 
for each type of transporter. 
In the in vitro studies using human transporter expressing cells, Caco-2 cells, or BSEP expressing 
vesicle, the IC50 values of cefiderocol for OATP1B1, MATE1, P-gp, BCRP, and BSEP transporters were 
all 4700 µmol/L (3540 µg/mL as cefiderocol) or more. These findings demonstrate that cefiderocol is 
not expected to affect the PK of coadministered drugs that are substrates of these transporters. 
As cefiderocol showed the potential for a drug-drug interaction (DDI) with substrates of the OAT1, 
OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B3, and MATE2-K transporters, a clinical DDI study was conducted to 
investigate the potential inhibitory effects of cefiderocol on the PK of substrates for these various 
transporters.  
All 3 in vivo DDI studies were performed in accordance with the guideline regarding perpetrator and 
victim doses, including coverage of 90% of the c/t of the victim. 
The studies with furosemide (substrate of OAT1 and OAT3) and metformin (substrate of OCT1, OCT2, 
and MATE2K) showed no increase in AUC upon coadministration with cefiderocol and it is agreed that 
no interaction with substrates of OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, COT2, and MATE2K is expected in vivo.  
For the study with rosuvastatin, AUCR was slightly elevated (1.24, 1.1 to 1.4 for 90% CI). Concerns 
were raised regarding the timing of the administration (not reaching tmax simultaneously). No 
increased AUCR was observed in the two subject that had a rosuvastatin tmax close to the tmax of 
cefiderocol (ie end of infusion, 3h), suggesting that the worst case scenario of concomitant tmax did 
not lead to a clinically relevant drug drug interaction between cefiderocol and rosuvastatin, as a probe 
substrate for OATP1B3. While the number of patients this conclusion is based on is very small, this is 
considered sufficient for an assessment of the worst-case interaction in this case. The SmPC section 
5.2 mentions this interaction as a 21% increase in AUCR, and not clinically relevant; which is 
appropriate.   
Cefiderocol contains an iron chelating moiety, and limited data was provided on interactions with iron 
containing products. An interaction with cefiderocol as the victim has been excluded, and iron 
homeostasis was shown not to be significantly affected by cefiderocol. Ionophore toxicosis was also 
addressed and is considered unlikely. 
Cefiderocol contains a catechol moiety and is metabolized by COMT (catechol o-methyl transferase), as 
detected in M9 and further downstream metabolites. The risk of interaction with substrates of COMT is 
considered low.  
Based on the current data, the risk for clinically relevant PK interactions for cefiderocol as a victim is 
low. The risk for interactions as a perpetrator is low, though there remain uncertainties regarding CYP 
3A4 and PXR mediated induction, and further post-approval action is required (REC1). 
PK/PD 
The analyses are adequately performed. Regarding assessment of PTA data, please see 
“pharmacodynamics” below. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Cefiderocol is a novel cephalosporin that like other β-lactam antibacterial agents inhibits bacterial cell-
wall synthesis by targeting penicillin-binding proteins. Cefiderocol uptake differs from other β-lactams 
in that cefiderocol binds to ferric iron via its catechol moiety forming a chelating complex which allows 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 59/154 
 
 
 
cefiderocol to be actively transported into the periplasmic space through siderophore uptake systems. 
The catechol group is also assumed to be the cause of enhanced stability of cefiderocol to both serine- 
and metallo-type β-lactamases. Likely because of its ability to utilise active transportation through the 
outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria cefiderocol seems less adversely affected by efflux pumps 
and loss of outer membrane porins. 
Susceptibility testing 
The methodology for antimicrobial susceptibility testing has been agreed between the Applicant and 
the EUCAST. 
In vitro activity 
The antibacterial spectrum of cefiderocol includes mainly Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting 
bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia and 
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. 
In multi-national surveillance studies cefiderocol had MIC90 values up to 2 mg/L against various Gram-
negative bacteria other than B. multivorans (belonging to B. cepacia complex with an MIC90 of 32 
mg/L).  
For carbapenem nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii the MIC90s were 
≤4 mg/L in the surveillance studies. In a study where carbapenemase-producers were investigated 
somewhat higher MIC90s (8 mg/L) were noted against NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae and OXA-
24/40-like carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii. 
The MBC/MIC ratios of cefiderocol ranged from 1 to 2 against Enterobacteriaceae except for S. 
marcescens for which the MBC/MIC ratio were higher which was also the case for the majority of non-
fermenters isolates tested. This indicates that a true bactericidal activity (>1×103 log10 colony count 
reduction) may be more difficult to achieve in patients against non-fermenters than against 
Enterobacteriaceae. 
As described above, cefiderocol resistant strains (defined as a MIC ≥ 8 mg/L) appeared at low 
frequencies in multi-national surveillance studies. However, despite the relative stability of cefiderocol 
to both serine- and metallo-type β-lactamases results from surveillance studies indicate that presence 
of NDM-1 and some serine-type β-lactamases such as PER-1 may contribute to elevated cefiderocol 
MICs (≥ 8 mg/L). 
The frequency of spontaneous resistance was similar to, or lower than that of ceftazidime used for 
comparison. Cefiderocol resistance was shown to be associated with mutations of various genes. 
Considering the mode of action of cefiderocol, the mutation on the iron uptake systems could be a risk 
factor for causing resistance to cefiderocol. In the frequency of resistance studies, the mutation of the 
upstream region of pvdS resulting in the overproduction of pyoverdine increased the cefiderocol MIC. 
Although the iron transporter mutants did not appear in the resistance acquisition studies a mutation in 
1 or 2 iron transporters has been shown in other experiments to increase the cefiderocol MIC. 
No resistant mutants were detected when human PK profiles of cefiderocol were simulated against two 
strains of K. pneumoniae and one strain of P. aeruginosa in an in vitro infection model. However, the 
reason for the regrowth noted in the model for one of the K. pneumoniae isolates with a MIC of 4 mg/L 
was not further investigated. This finding may indicate that the clinical dose of cefiderocol is not 
sufficient to suppress regrowth (which may be a result of resistance development) for strains with 
borderline MICs. The Applicant has explained that the strains tested in the in vitro experiments were 
selected based on the perceived high risk to acquire resistance based on high cefiderocol MICs or 
based on the worst-case results in frequency of resistance (FoR) assays. The incubation time were 
longer in these experiments compared with the incubation time in the FoR studies. Because no 
Assessment report

resistant colonies appeared during the 72-hour incubation against these high-risk strains in the in vitro 
pharmacodynamic studies, the risks for the appearance of the resistant colonies were considered by 
the Applicant to be low. In the clinical studies there were a few subjects treated with cefiderocol that 
had post-baseline isolates with at least a 4-fold increase in cefiderocol MIC. The Applicant has clarified 
that for the isolates which showed an increase in MIC during the treatment periods of clinical studies, 
an additional analysis was conducted for isolates which had a MIC of ≥ 8 μg/mL. For the cUTI study, 
no isolates with a MIC of ≥ 8 μg/mL were observed. Whole genome sequencing analysis for the 
isolates which showed a MIC increase in the CREDIBLE-CR study is ongoing. This analysis should be 
provided as a post-authorisation measure once available. 
Although the overall results of the effects of in vitro activity in human body fluids indicates that the in 
vitro activity of cefiderocol is unaffected by the presence of pulmonary surfactant, serum and urine it 
should be noted that only four strains were tested and there were significant increases in MICs for 
single strains tested in these media compared with in standard media. The Applicant suggests that the 
up to 8-fold increase in cefiderocol MIC in the presence of relevant biological fluids may be attributable 
to iron content in the respective media. This explanation is reasonable. Moreover, the increase in 
cefiderocol MIC in the presence of biological fluids is several folds lower than the increase in 
daptomycin MIC noted in the presence of pulmonary surfactant, an increase that is clinically significant 
and likely the cause of clinical failure of daptomycin in the treatment of pulmonary infections. The in 
vitro increase in cefiderocol MICs in different media is likely non-significant taking also the clinical 
efficacy results from the APEKS-cUTI, the CREDIBLE-CR and APEKS-NP studies into account. 
In vivo activity 
The therapeutic efficacy of cefiderocol has been assessed using various animal infection models 
including systemic infection model in neutropenic or immunocompetent mice, lung infection model in 
neutropenic mice, urinary tract infection model in immunocompetent mice, thigh infection model in 
neutropenic mice and lung infection model in immunocompetent rat. Different doses of cefiderocol 
including dose regimens equivalent to human dosing have been investigated against a number of 
relevant bacterial test organisms with varying MICs. Relevant comparators were included although it is 
unclear whether the effect of the same amount of cefiderocol and comparator drugs in mg/kg is an 
adequate comparison. Nevertheless, cefiderocol overall showed dose-dependent bacterial reductions in 
each infection site. Moreover, prolonged infusion (from 1-hour to 3-hour infusion) which can be 
expected to increase the %fT>MIC improved the bacterial killing in the rat model of pneumonia. 
A disparity was noted in the lung infection model between the in vitro and in vivo activities of 
meropenem and CAZ/AVI against metallo-type β-lactamase producing strains with significant CFU 
reductions despite high MICs. It has previously been hypothesised that the in vivo expression of MBLs 
may not be enough in murine lung infection models (Zmartlicka et al, 2015). The Applicant has 
however provided support that cefiderocol at the clinical dose regimen caused significant reductions in 
bacterial counts against two MBL-producers also in an in vitro model of infection. 
Support for dose selection 
Because of the limited clinical development programme performed for cefiderocol, in keeping with what 
is described in the Addendum to the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for 
treatment of bacterial infections (EMA/CHMP/351889/2013) for products that are candidates to 
address an unmet medical need, the PK/PD analyses incorporating non-clinical PK/PD data and patient 
PK data is considered pivotal for dose selection for the proposed indication. 
The principal support for dose selection was based on nonclinical PK/PD studies to determine the PK/PD 
index best correlated with cefiderocol efficacy, the magnitude of that PK/PD index (or PK/PD target) 
required for 1-log10 CFU reductions in murine thigh or lung infections, and Monte-Carlo simulations 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 61/154 
 
 
 
using human population PK model to determine the probability of target attainment in plasma and 
epithelial lining fluid (ELF) at different MICs for subjects with various degree of renal function. 
In the dose fractionation study to determine the PK/PD index best correlated with in vivo efficacy the 
total drug concentration has been used. Although the fraction unbound to plasma proteins normally is 
applied in these determinations for drugs for which the protein binding not is negligible, it is unlikely 
that considering the free fraction would change which index is best correlated with efficacy. 
The Applicant has chosen to focus their PK/PD target studies on animal models. Because of the in 
vitro/in vivo activity discordance noted against MBL-producing strains for the comparator agents used 
in other animal model studies the activity of cefiderocol could possibly be overestimated also in the 
determination of PK/PD targets when MBL-producing strains were tested. Although PDTs were not 
calculated based on in vitro model data, the Applicant has provided support that cefiderocol at the 
clinical dose regimen caused significant reductions in bacterial counts against two MBL-producers also 
in an in vitro model of infection. 
The %fT>MIC value of 75% which was the mean PK/PD target required to achieve 1-log10 reduction 
determined in the neutropenic thigh model was initially chosen for the PTA estimations. Due to the 
wide range of values noted for non-fermenters in thigh and lung models, there is concern that 
estimating PTA against this mean value PDT may over-estimate the anticipated efficacy of cefiderocol. 
There is additional concern that, with low ELF penetration, inadequate PTA may be achieved in this 
compartment to cover the MIC90 values for certain Gram-negative pathogens. Therefore, the Applicant 
was requested to use all available PK data to re-estimate the PTA in plasma and ELF by renal function 
category using the fT>MIC 75% PDT and also using alternative PDTs of 80%, 90% and 100%. 
The PTA values in plasma are satisfactory (>90%) up to an MIC of 2 mg/L even at the highest PDT 
simulated (>100% fT>MIC) for all infection types and all renal function categories except for those 
with normal renal function and cUTI/pyelonephritis for which the PTA value was slightly below 90% 
(88.0). This supports the adequacy of the dose up to an MIC of 2 mg/L. 
At the PDT of 75%, the PTA values in ELF are >90% at MIC 2 mg/L except for those with normal renal 
function and cUTI/pyelonephritis for which the PTA value was 85.4%. At the highest PDT simulated, 
the PTA values in ELF are >90% at MIC 1 mg/L and range from 62.8 to 99.2% for different renal 
function categories at MIC 2 mg/L. 
The majority of species within the spectrum of cefiderocol have MIC90 values up to 2 mg/L. As noted 
above, in the pooled dataset from multi-national surveillance studies, the cefiderocol MIC90 values for 
Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters varied between strains and were highest (2 mg/L) for A. 
baumannii. However, when only carbapenemase-producing pathogens are taken into account, which 
are the main targets for cefiderocol, the MIC90 values are in general 4 mg/L and are highest (8 mg/L) 
for the subsets of NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae and OXA-24/40-like carbapenemase-producing 
A. baumannii. Overall, based on PTA simulations in plasma, and even with a PDT of 75% fT>MIC, the 
dose of cefiderocol may not be sufficient for the treatment of infections caused by a minority of 
pathogens for which there at present is an unmet need. 
Susceptibility testing breakpoints 
Susceptibility breakpoints are established by the EUCAST. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect in the clinical studies 
No clear relationship between cefiderocol %fT>MIC and efficacy was noted for patients enrolled in the 
Phase 2 study in the APEKS-cUTI, the CREDIBLE-CR and the APEKS-NP studies.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
All issues are resolved, provided the proposed SmPC text and REC1 on CYP3A4 induction are agreed 
to. 
Pharmacodynamics 
It should be noted that because of the limited clinical development programme performed for this 
product the PK/PD analyses incorporating non-clinical PK/PD data and patient PK data are considered 
pivotal for dose justification for the proposed indication. 
Based on plasma PTA simulations using relevant PDTs, the doses of cefiderocol in different renal 
function categories are predicted to be sufficient for the treatment of infections caused by pathogens 
having MICs up to 2 mg/L. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
In line with CHMP guidance for agents that are expected to address an unmet medical need the 
Applicant has conducted an abbreviated clinical programme to support the proposed indication 
treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative bacteria in adult patients with limited treatment 
options. The programme includes a phase 2 study in cUTI/pyelonephritis (APEKS-cUTI) and a small 
descriptive phase 3 study in infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens 
(CREDIBLE-CR). Additionally, data from a phase 3 study in HAP/VAP (APEKS-NP) was provided in the 
responses to the Day 90 LoQ. This study is presented below in the section for supportive studies.

Treatments 
Subjects were randomised to cefiderocol 2 g q8h administered over 1 h or IMP/CS 1 g q8h 
administered over 1 h. 
The dose of cefiderocol and IMP/CS had to be reduced in subjects with renal impairment and in the 
case of IMP/CS also in subjects weighing <70 kg. The recommended duration of treatment (IV only) 
was 7 to 14 days but could be shortened to 5 days at the discretion of the investigator. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the composite outcome (microbiological and clinical response) 
of cefiderocol with that of IMP/CS in a subject population at risk for MDR Gram-negative pathogens 
originating from cUTIs with or without pyelonephritis or acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis at test of 
cure (TOC) approximately 7 days after end of treatment (EOT), defined as the last day of study 
treatment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of microbiological eradication and clinical response 
outcomes at the TOC in the Micro-ITT population. 
Clinical cure at TOC was defined as resolution or improvement of the symptoms of cUTI that were 
present at study entry and no new symptoms; microbiological eradication was defined as the 
demonstration that the bacterial pathogen found at study entry was reduced to fewer than 104 CFU/mL 
on urine culture at TOC. In addition, a post hoc analysis was performed using the more stringent CHMP 
criterion for microbial eradication of demonstration that the bacterial pathogen found at study entry 
was reduced to fewer than 103 CFU/mL on urine culture at the TOC (EMA/CHMP/351889/2013). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the composite of microbiological eradication and clinical 
response at early assessment (EA), EOT, and follow-up (FU); and microbiological and clinical outcome 
per pathogen and per subject at EA, EOT, TOC, and FU. 
Sample size 
The study was planned to randomise 450 subjects in a 2:1 ratio to cefiderocol and IMP/CS. The sample 
size planned for the study were driven by statistical considerations (see below) but were eventually 
increased to meet FDA requirements (i.e. at least 300 subjects exposed to cefiderocol) for a safety 
database large enough for registration in the US. 
NI margins of 20% and 15% (the latter was the FDA requirement) were prespecified. Based on the 
15% non-inferiority margin, 330 evaluable subjects for Micro-ITT population were required to provide 
80% power with a one-sided significance level of 2.5% assuming a 70% composite response rate for 
both the cefiderocol arm and the IPM/CS arm. If 80% of randomised subjects were evaluable a sample 
size of 413 would be enough. 
The justification of the non-inferiority margin 20% was based on analyses of treatment benefit of 
antimicrobial therapy in this patient population. Recent reviews indicate that the treatment benefit is 
large, 30-40%. Preserving nearly half the treatment benefit provides ample evidence of treatment 
effect of the investigational compound.

The proportion of the Micro-ITT Population was monitored in a blinded fashion during the conduct of 
the study to ensure the adequacy of the design assumptions. 
Randomisation 
Interactive response technology was used for randomisation. Each subject was randomised to either 
the cefiderocol group or the IPM/CS group in a 2:1 ratio. The randomisation was stratified according to 
the subject´s clinical diagnosis (cUTI with or without pyelonephritis and acute uncomplicated 
pyelonephritis) and region (North America, European Union, Russia and Japan plus rest of world). 
The proportion of subjects randomised with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis was to be limited to 
approximately 30%. 
Blinding (masking) 
The investigator, site personnel, the sponsor, and the sponsor’s designees involved in blinded 
monitoring, data management, or other aspects of the study were blinded to treatment assignment. 
The site pharmacist or qualified designee who prepared the intravenous infusion solution was 
unblinded 
Statistical methods 
The study hypothesis was that the composite efficacy response, microbiological eradication and clinical 
response at the TOC, with cefiderocol would be non-inferior to IPM/CS. The non-inferiority margin was 
20% and non-inferiority was to be concluded if the lower bound of a 2-sided 95% CI for the difference 
in response rates between the 2 treatment groups was greater than -20%. 
Detailed statistical analysis methods were specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) including a PK 
analysis plan. The final SAP (Version 3.0) was dated 10 Nov 2016. 
Analysis populations 
The Micro-ITT Population was the primary population for efficacy analyses. The ME Population and ITT 
Population were used for sensitivity analyses. 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population included all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose 
of study drug (S-649266 or IPM/CS). 
The Microbiological Intent-to-Treat (Micro-ITT) Population included all ITT subjects who had a 
baseline Gram-negative bacterial uropathogen on culture of urine or blood (≥ 105 CFU/mL) that causes 
UTI. This population did not include subjects who had only baseline Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. 
Subjects were not to be excluded from this population based upon events that occurred post 
randomisation (e.g., loss to follow-up). Analyses were performed according to randomised treatment. 
The Microbiological Evaluable (ME) Population Included the Micro-ITT Population who followed 
important components of the study as specified in the protocol with no major protocol violations. This 
population was analysed according to the treatment to which the subjects were randomised. All criteria 
for major protocol violations and subject evaluability were to be established prior to unblinding of the 
study drug. 
Criteria for evaluation were: 
•  A culture available at both Baseline and TOC 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 67/154 
 
 
 
•  An EOT assessment after 5 to 14 days of IV study treatment, unless treatment was assessed a 
failure 
•  Underwent TOC assessment 7 days (± 2 days) after the end of infusion, unless treatment was 
assessed a failure 
•  No major protocol inclusion or exclusion violations 
•  No violations of restrictions for concomitant therapy, including concomitant antibiotic(s) 
effective against Gram-negative bacteria 
•  No violations of coadministration of valproic acid, probenecid, methotrexate, or procainamide 
before EOT 
Safety Population: Included all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study drug; 
this population was analysed according to the treatment that the subjects actually received, rather 
than the treatment to which the subjects were randomized. 
The Pharmacokinetic Concentration Population: Included all subjects who underwent plasma or 
urine PK sampling and had at least 1 evaluable PK assay result for cefiderocol; this population was 
used for the concentration listing, plotting of the concentration-time data, and the concentration 
summary. 
Primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
The composite clinical and microbiological response rate at the TOC was calculated as the proportion of 
subjects with clinical cure and microbiological eradication at the TOC. The number and percentage of 
subjects achieving clinical and microbiological response at the TOC were presented by treatment 
group. 
Subjects who were lost to follow-up or had missing or indeterminate clinical or microbiological outcome 
at the TOC were considered as treatment failures and were included in the denominator for analysis in 
the Micro-ITT Population. If a subject was a treatment failure prior to TOC and the TOC assessment 
was not completed, treatment failure was be carried forward to the TOC visit. 
For the primary efficacy analysis, adjusted estimates of the difference in the rate of responders 
between the two arms was presented along with CIs based on a stratified analysis using Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) weights in the Micro-ITT population. All CIs were two-sided. CMH weights were 
performed with the stratification factor, a specific clinical diagnosis (cUTI with or without pyelonephritis 
vs acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis).  
For the primary analysis, a fixed sequential approach was used; if non-inferiority based on the 20% 
margin could be concluded, non-inferiority inference based on the 15% margin was to be performed. 
The following sensitivity analyses were planned: 
Using a different population, i.e., the ME Population 
Excluding subjects with indeterminate clinical and microbiological outcomes or missing at TOC in the 
Micro-ITT Population 
Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity 
For the primary analysis, a fixed sequential approach was used implying that if non-inferiority based on 
the 20% margin had been concluded successfully, non-inferiority inference based on the 15% margin 
was to be performed. 
No further multiplicity adjustment was applied. 
Missing Microbiological or Clinical Outcome 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 68/154 
 
 
 
For clinical and microbiological outcomes, including sensitivity clinical outcome, subjects who were lost 
to follow-up or had missing or indeterminate clinical outcome or microbiological outcome were to be 
included in the denominator for response rate calculation and thus, were considered as not responders. 
If a subject was a treatment failure prior to the TOC visit (or FUP visit) and the TOC assessment (or 
FUP assessment) was not completed, treatment failure was carried forward to the TOC visit (or FUP 
visit). 
If a TOC assessment was not completed (missing or out of analysis window) and, the subject was a 
treatment failure on or after EOT assessment, the treatment failure was carried forward to the TOC 
visit. Also, if a FUP assessment was not completed (missing or out of analysis window) and, the subject 
was treatment failure on or after EOT assessment, the treatment failure was carried forward to the FUP 
visit. For the assessment at EA visit and EOT visit, imputation for missing will not be performed. 
Missing values for other individual data points were to remain as missing unless otherwise specified. All 
analyses were to be based on observed cases unless otherwise stated. 
Secondary efficacy analyses 
Secondary efficacy analyses were conducted based on the Micro-ITT Population. The ME Population 
was to be used for sensitivity analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints if applicable. The ITT 
Population was to be used for analysis of clinical outcome. 
The microbiologic outcome per subject at the TOC was analysed in the same manner as the primary 
analysis. The same analysis method as described for the primary efficacy endpoint was used also for 
the composite clinical and microbiologic outcome at EA, EOT, and FUP, the microbiologic outcome per 
subject at EA, EOT, and FUP, and the clinical outcome per subject at EA, EOT, TOC, and FUP. The 
outcome was tabulated for each treatment group. The adjusted estimate of the difference in the 
response rate between the two treatment arms along with the adjusted 95% CIs based on the CMH 
weights were presented.

Subjects at sites with Good Clinical Practice noncompliance (11 subjects from 2 sites; 10 of the subjects were 
in the cefiderocol group) were removed from the analysis populations for efficacy (ITT, Micro-ITT, and ME). 
Subjects in the ITT population were excluded from the Micro-ITT population if they had no baseline Gram-
negative uropathogen with ≥ 105 CFU (38/303 of subjects in the cefiderocol group and 28/149 of subjects in 
the IPM/CS group). 
Subjects in the Micro-ITT population were excluded from the ME population if they a) received nonstudy Gram-
negative antibacterial drugs before TOC (8/303 of subjects in the cefiderocol group and 5/149 of subjects in the 
IPM/CS group); b) did not receive 5 to 14 days of infusion unless they were assessed failure 1/303 of subjects 
in the cefiderocol group and 1/149 of subjects in IPM/CS group; or c) had no TOC assessment within the 
window of EOT + 7 (± 2) days unless assessed as failure earlier 15/303 of subjects in the cefiderocol group and 
8/149 of subjects in the IPM/CS group). 
Recruitment 
The first subject´s first visit was 5 February 2015 and last subject´s last visit 16 August 2016. 
Conduct of the study 
Of the major amendments made to the protocol none were made that would be expected to result in 
favour for any of the treatment groups. 
All major protocol deviations were identified before subject unblinding and subjects were excluded 
from the efficacy analyses (see reasons above).

A total of 18/252 subjects in the cefiderocol group and 8/119 subjects in the IMP/CS group had 
positive blood cultures for the baseline uropathogen. 
Few baseline uropathogens isolated from subjects in the IMP/CS group were found non-susceptible to 
IMP/CS (1/23 K. pneumoniae = R [MIC=4 mg/L], 2/2 P. mirabilis = I [MIC=2 mg/L], 1/4 P. aeruginosa 
= R [MIC = 8 mg/L], 2/3 M. morganii = I [MIC= 2 mg/L], 1/1 A. calcoaceticus = R [MIC >8 mg/L]). 
Compliance and exposure to study drug 
Approximately 96% of subjects in each treatment group received 7 to 14 days of treatment. The mean 
and median duration of exposure in the Micro-ITT population were similar in both treatment groups 
(9.6 and 9.0 days, respectively). 
Prior and concomitant exposure to other antibiotics 
A similar number of subjects in the cefiderocol and IMP/CS treatment groups received prior 
antimicrobial medications (9.1% and 10.1%, respectively) and concomitant antimicrobial medications 
(17.1% and 21.0%, respectively) although some differences existed between the treatment groups 
regarding the type of antimicrobial drug. 
Numbers analysed 
See table (E3) above. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The response rate for the primary endpoint at TOC was 72.6% of subjects in the cefiderocol group and 
54.6% of subjects in the IPM/CS group (table below). The adjusted treatment difference (cefiderocol 
minus IPM/CS) met the criteria for noninferiority at the prespecified -20% and -15% margins. In 
addition, the lower limit was above zero which is consistent with superiority of cefiderocol compared 
with IPM/CS. Similar results were achieved when the response rates in the ME population were 
considered (data not shown).

Treatment difference (cefiderocol minus IPM/CS) is the adjusted estimate of the difference in the 
responder rate between the 2 treatment arms. The adjusted difference estimates and the 95% CIs (2-
sided) are calculated using a stratified analysis with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weights based on the 
stratified factor at baseline (cUTI with or without pyelonephritis vs. acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis). 
The P-value is 2-sided and the null hypothesis is that the response rate of cefiderocol is equivalent to that 
of IPM/CS. The P-value is calculated using the adjusted difference and the standard error with Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel weights based on the stratified factor at baseline 
Using the EU-recommended primary endpoint for studies in cUTI and more stringent criterion for 
microbial eradication (<103 CFU/mL instead of <104 CFU/mL) essentially similar results as for the 
primary analysis were obtained (table below).

Due to concerns over the adequacy of the imipenem dose adjustment schema (which followed US 
recommendations current when the study started but later revised), and the fact that a greater 
proportion in the imipenem group (60%) had a dose adjustment vs. the cefiderocol group (45%), the 
applicant provided additional analyses of the primary endpoint according to whether there was dose 
adjustment by renal function and body weight at baseline. The microbiological responses at TOC are 
shown for each treatment group by baseline dose adjustment below.

The applicant also confirmed that there was post-baseline dose adjustment allowed in each treatment 
group and that resistance to imipenem at baseline or emerging on treatment did not explain the 
overall difference between treatments. 
Furthermore, an analysis of those who failed in the primary analysis was provided, which showed 
that most failures reflected lack of reduction in urinary bacterial counts to below the required CFU/mL 
level. 
Incidence of Clinical or Microbiological Failure at EOT and TOC in the cUTI Study 
No pattern of baseline diagnosis, bacterial species or creatinine clearance could be discerned amongst 
those who did and did not fail. 
Ancillary analyses 
Secondary endpoints 
The composite outcome at early assessment and EOT were essentially similar between the treatment 
groups. The difference in favourable response rates in favour of the cefiderocol arm noted at TOC 
remained at follow-up although the favourable response rates were lower for both treatment groups 
(table below).

When the response rates were separated between clinical outcome and microbiological outcome it was 
clear that the composite response rates in favour or the cefiderocol arm at TOC and FU was driven by 
higher microbiological eradication rates. However, a difference in favour of the cefiderocol group in 
clinical response rates were detected at FU possibly indicating that the better sustained microbiological 
eradication at FU translates into a measurable clinical benefit (data not shown).

Subgroup analyses 
The treatment differences in the composite response rate at TOC by different subgroups were 
consistent with the treatment difference in the overall Micro ITT population (table below). Subgroup 
analysis by race was not meaningful because most subjects were categorised as White. 
For subgroups with different baseline renal function status, subjects with and without prior 
antimicrobials, and subjects with bacteraemia the results were consistent with the overall results (data 
not shown).

Title of study: CREDIBLE-CR 
This was a phase 3, randomised, open-label, multicentre study of cefiderocol compared with best 
available therapy (BAT) in adult subjects for the treatment of severe infections caused by carbapenem-
resistant Gram-negative pathogens. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria included the following: 
1.  Hospitalised adults (18 years and older). 
2.  Clinical diagnosis of HAP/VAP/HCAP, cUTI, or BSI/sepsis caused by a Gram-negative pathogen 
with evidence of carbapenem resistance 
Hospital-acquired pneumonia was defined as an acute bacterial pneumonia in a subject 
hospitalized for more than 48 hours or developing within 7 days after discharge from hospital. 
Subjects may have had acute respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation for HAP 
(ventilated-HAP). 
Ventilator-associated pneumonia was defined as an acute bacterial pneumonia in a subject 
receiving mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal (or nasotracheal) tube for a minimum of 
48 hours. 
Healthcare-associated pneumonia was defined as an acute bacterial pneumonia in a subject 
who was hospitalized in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within 90 days of the 
infection; resided in a nursing home or long-term care facility; received IV antibiotic therapy,

chemotherapy, or wound care; or attended a haemodialysis clinic within 30 days of the current 
infection. 
Complicated urinary tract infection was defined as a clinical syndrome characterized by pyuria 
and a documented microbial pathogen on urine culture, accompanied by local and systemic 
signs and symptoms including fever, chills, malaise, flank pain, back pain, and/or 
costovertebral angle pain or tenderness that occur in the presence of a functional or anatomical 
abnormality of the urinary tract or in the presence of catheterization and who required 
hospitalization for the parenteral (IV) treatment of cUTI were enrolled in the study. 
The BSI/sepsis category included bacteraemia or sepsis caused by infections other than 
HAP/VAP/HCAP or cUTI. Subjects were enrolled in the BSI/sepsis group with either: 
a. Documented BSI caused by a carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogen 
OR 
b. Systemic response to infection, meeting the clinical criteria of SIRS and an identified 
infection source (e.g., severe skin infection, intra-abdominal infection) caused by a 
carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogen 
Key exclusion criteria included the following: 
1.  Subjects who needed more than 3 systemic antibiotics as part of BAT for the treatment of the 
Gram-negative infection (subjects with mixed Gram-positive or anaerobic infections may have 
received appropriate concomitant narrow-spectrum antibiotics [e.g., vancomycin, linezolid, 
metronidazole, clindamycin]) 
2.  Subjects with coinfection caused by invasive aspergillosis, mucormycosis, or other highly lethal 
mould 
3.  Subjects who had central nervous system infection (e.g., meningitis, brain abscess, shunt 
infection) 
4.  Subjects with infection requiring > 3 weeks of antibiotic treatment (e.g., bone and joint 
infection, endocarditis) 
5.  Subjects with cystic fibrosis or moderate to severe bronchiectasis 
6.  Subjects in refractory septic shock defined as persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid 
resuscitation or despite vasopressive therapy at the time of Randomization 
7.  Subjects with severe neutropenia, i.e., polymorphonuclear neutrophils < 100 cells/μL 
8.  Subjects with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score > 30 
9.  Subjects who had received a potentially effective antibiotic regimen for the carbapenem-
resistant Gram-negative infection for a continuous duration of more than 24 hours in cUTI, or 
36 hours in HAP/VAP/HCAP or BSI/sepsis during the 72 hours prior to Randomization 
10. Subjects who were receiving peritoneal dialysis. 
The study was conducted at 45 sites. At data cut for the interim analysis subjects had been included in 
10 countries. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomised to receive cefiderocol 2 g q8h administered over 3 h or best available 
therapy (BAT) determined by the investigator for each infection diagnosis. BAT consisted of 1 to 3 
antibiotic agents selected specifically for the carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogen. 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 77/154 
 
 
 
The dose of cefiderocol had to be reduced in subjects with renal impairment. The recommended 
duration of treatment (IV only) was 7 to 14 days but could be shortened to 5 days (cUTI only) at the 
discretion of the investigator. The maximum treatment duration was 21 days. 
A single adjunctive antibacterial agent for HAP/VAP/HCAP or BSI/sepsis subjects could be added. 
Adjunctive therapy was locally sourced by study sites and included only marketed drug products 
available through the investigator’s site pharmacy. Investigational agents, a polymyxin (colistin or 
polymyxin B), and a cephalosporin/carbapenem including combination with β-lactamase inhibitor (e.g., 
ceftazidime/avibactam or ceftolozane/tazobactam) were not permitted as part of adjunctive antibiotic 
therapy. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives were: 
• 
• 
To assess, at test of cure (TOC, defined as end of treatment + 7 days [± 2 days]), the clinical 
outcome of treatment with cefiderocol or BAT in adult subjects with either HAP/VAP/HCAP or 
BSI/sepsis caused by carbapenem resistant Gram-negative pathogens 
To assess, at TOC, the microbiological outcome of treatment with cefiderocol or BAT in adult 
subjects with cUTI caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints were the clinical outcome per subject at TOC in subjects with 
HAP/VAP/HCAP or BSI/sepsis and the microbiological outcome (for Gram-negative pathogen) per 
subject at TOC in subjects with cUTI. 
Clinical cure of HAP/VAP/HCAP and BSI/sepsis was defined as resolution or substantial improvement of 
baseline signs and symptoms (for pneumonia including a reduction in SOFA score and CPIS, and 
improvement or lack of progression of chest radiographic abnormalities and for BSI/sepsis including a 
reduction in SOFA score and eradication of bacteraemia) such that no antibacterial therapy was 
required for the treatment of the current infection. 
For cUTI, microbiological eradication was defined as a urine culture showed the baseline Gram-
negative uropathogen found at entry at ≥105 CFU/mL was reduced to <103 CFU/mL. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the clinical and/or microbiological outcome per subject or per 
pathogen at EOT, TOC and FU for the different infections types, all-cause mortality at day 14 and day 
28, composite endpoint of survival and no change in antibiotic treatment due to either lack of 
therapeutic benefit or drug-related toxicity at TOC, survival time, Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score 
(CPIS) parameters at EOT, TOC, and FU (HAP/VAP/HCAP only) and Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score at EOT, TOC, and FU. 
Sample size 
Approximately 150 subjects were planned to be enrolled in the full study and randomised 2:1 to 
cefiderocol and BAT, respectively.

Randomisation 
Interactive response technology was used for randomisation. Randomisation was performed by the 
stochastic minimization method using their infection site (HAP/VAP/HCAP, cUTI, and BSI/sepsis), 
APACHE II score (≤ 15 and ≥ 16), and region (North America, South America, Europe, and Asia-
Pacific) as allocation factors. To avoid deterministic allocation based on the ongoing allocation results, 
probabilistic allocation was incorporated. 
The randomisation was stratified according to the subject´s clinical diagnosis (HAP/VAP/HCAP, cUTI, 
and BSI/sepsis). The randomisation system was designed such that the population with HAP/VAP/HCAP 
would have approximately 50% of randomised subjects; cUTI was limited to no more than 30% of 
randomised subjects, and the remainder of subjects was enrolled under the BSI/sepsis diagnosis. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study used an open-label design. 
Statistical methods 
No inferential testing was performed. Only descriptive statistics were provided. i.e. each response rate 
was provided with the 95% confidence interval (CI) by treatment group. 
Analysis populations 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
treatment 
Microbiological Intent-to-treat (Micro-ITT) population: all subjects in the ITT population who 
had a baseline Gram-negative pathogen from an appropriate clinical specimen 
Carbapenem-resistant Microbiological Intent-to-treat (CR Micro-ITT) population: all subjects 
in the Micro-ITT population whose baseline Gram-negative pathogen was carbapenem-resistant 
(primary efficacy population) 
Carbapenem-resistant Microbiologically Evaluable (CR-ME) population: includes all subjects in 
the CR Micro-ITT population who followed important components of the study as specified in the 
protocol with no major protocol violations 
Analysed for safety: 
• Safety population: all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment 
(identical to the ITT population for this interim report) 
Analysed for Pharmacokinetics (PK): 
• PK concentration population: all subjects who had plasma sampling and had at least 1 evaluable 
PK assay result for cefiderocol 
Below are the analyses as described in the CSR that according to the applicant are those described in 
the SAP for this interim report (ver 2.2, dated 29 Oct 2018), prepared by the sponsor. Descriptive 
statistics are provided. 
Primary efficacy analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 79/154 
 
 
 
For the CR Micro-ITT population, the clinical outcomes at TOC were summarized and clinical cure rates 
and the 95% CIs were calculated by treatment group (cefiderocol or BAT) for subjects with 
HAP/VAP/HCAP or BSI/sepsis, separately. The clinical response rate was calculated as the proportion of 
subjects whose clinical outcome was clinical cure at TOC. 
The microbiological outcomes at TOC were summarized and microbiological eradication rates and the 
95% CIs were calculated by treatment group (cefiderocol or BAT) for the subjects with cUTI. The 
microbiological response rate was calculated as the proportion of subjects whose baseline Gram-
negative uropathogen(s) were eradicated at TOC. 
The following supplemental analyses were performed for the primary efficacy endpoint: 
• the primary analyses were carried out using different subject populations (Micro-ITT and CR-ME 
populations) 
• for subjects with cUTI in the CR Micro-ITT, Micro-ITT, and CR-ME populations, supplemental analyses 
for the microbiological outcome were carried out changing the eradication criteria for cUTI 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Descriptive statistics for all efficacy parameters are provided. The secondary endpoints of clinical 
response rates and microbiological response rates by treatment group and the 95% CIs were 
calculated. 
Supplementary clinical outcomes (to address indeterminate clinical outcomes) per subject and per 
pathogen were summarized and the cure rate and its 95% CI were calculated. 
Supplementary microbiological outcomes (to address indeterminate microbiological outcomes) per 
subject and per pathogen were summarized and eradication rate and its 95% CI were calculated. 
Composite clinical and microbiological response rates by treatment group and the 95% CIs were 
calculated. 
Analyses of all-cause mortality and survival time were performed. 
The SOFA and CPIS scores by infection site as relevant were summarized by time point. 
The response rate of a composite endpoint of survival and no change in antibiotic treatment due to 
either lack of therapeutic benefit or drug-related was compared between treatment groups by infection 
site (HAP/VAP/HCAP, cUTI, or BSI/sepsis) at TOC.

Twenty subjects were excluded from the Micro-ITT population (N = 130), which was used for 
supplementary analyses, due to no appropriate baseline Gram-negative pathogen. 
b 
Twelve additional subjects were excluded from the CR Micro-ITT population (N = 118), which was the 
primary efficacy analysis population, due to no confirmation of carbapenem resistance by central laboratory. 
c 
Thirtyeight additional subjects were excluded from the CR-ME population (N = 80), which was used for 
supplementary analyses, due to violations of restrictions for concomitant therapy, major protocol inclusion or 
exclusion violations, treatment uncompliance, and no TOC assessment within EOT + 7 (± 2) days. 
Recruitment 
The first subject was enrolled 7 September 2016. 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was amended 3 times. Of the major amendments made to the protocol none were made 
that would be expected to result in favour for any of the treatment groups.

Gram-negative pathogens are based on data from the central microbiology laboratory (if available). 
Blood cultures positive for Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens (regardless of diagnosis) 
were identified in 22/80 of the subjects in the cefiderocol group and 13/38 in the BAT group in the CR 
Micro-ITT population. Among them, A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae were each observed in 10/22 of 
subjects in the cefiderocol group and 6/13 and 5/13, respectively in the BAT group.

Baseline study drug regimen 
In the cefiderocol group, 66/80 of subjects received cefiderocol monotherapy and 14/80 received 
adjunctive therapy, whereas in the BAT group, 10/38 of subjects received monotherapy. In the BAT 
group, 25/38 of subjects received a colistin-based regimen, of which 6 received colistin only. The 
remaining 13/38 of subjects in the BAT group received a noncolistin-based regimen, of which 4 
received noncolistin-based monotherapy. 
Exposure to study drug 
The mean duration of exposure in the CR Micro-ITT population for subjects with pneumonia or 
BSI/sepsis was one day shorter in the cefiderocol treatment group (11.4 days [range 2 to 22 days]) 
compared to for subjects in the BAT group (12.6 days [range 2 to 22 days]). The mean duration of 
exposure to cefiderocol for subjects with cUTI were 11.9 days (range 2 to 29 days) and fot BAT 7.4 
days (range 6 to 11 days). 
Prior and concomitant exposure to other antibiotics 
As noted in the table above nearly all subjects had received prior antimicrobial therapy within 2 weeks 
prior to randomisation. Prior antibacterial agents included agents with activity against aerobic Gram-
negative pathogens e.g. carbapenems, cephalosporins, ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-
avibactam, colistin, fosfomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, quinolones, aminoglycosides and tigecycline. 
Excluding BAT/adjunctive antibiotics, the majority of subjects received “other antibacterials” as 
concomitant medications. The concomitant medications were reported to be used for other infections 
such as meningitis after brain surgery, or surgical procedures. 
The concomitant antibacterial agents used included agents with activity against Gram-negative 
pathogens e.g. colistin, polymyxin, fosfomycin, carbapenems, cephalosporins, ceftazidime-avibactam, 
piperacillin-tazobactam, tigecycline, quinolones, aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. 
Numbers analysed 
See table above. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The clinical outcome for HAP/VAP/HCAP and BSI/sepsis and microbiological outcome for cUTI at TOC 
were the primary endpoints. About half of the subjects with HAP/VAP/HCAP and somewhat lower of 
subjects with BSI/sepsis in both treatment groups achieved clinical cure. Half of the subjects with cUTI 
in the cefiderocol group and 20% in the BAT group achieved microbiological eradication (table below).

In line with the higher favourable clinical response rate compared to the microbiological response the 
clinical outcome per pathogen at TOC were higher in the respective treatment groups for some of the 
pathogens (data not shown). 
Taking the MIC into account it can be noted that for subjects with A. baumannii microbiological 
eradication at TOC occurred only in 9 subjects with whose A. baumannii isolates had MIC values for 
cefiderocol of 0.06 to 1 mg/L. Subjects with failure to achieve eradication had isolates with MIC values 
evenly spread over the range of MIC values detected (0.06 to 16 mg/L). For P. aeruginosa the isolates 
of the 2 subjects who had microbiological eradication had cefiderocol MIC value of 0.06 and 4 mg/L 
whereas the 15 subjects that did not achieve eradication had MIC values ranging from 0.06 to 2 mg/L. 
The 16 subjects in the cefiderocol group with microbiological eradication of K. pneumoniae had MIC 
values ranging from ≤ 0.03 to 4 mg/L whereas the subjects that did not achieve eradication had MIC 
values ranging from 0.06 to 4 mg/L.

Similar mortality rates were noted in the ITT population with one additional death recorded at day 14 
(and subsequently at day 28) in both treatment groups in the HAP/VAP/HCAP stratum and one 
additional death at day 28 in the cefiderocol group in the cUTI stratum. 
Overall there were 39 deaths recorded until end of study, 30 deaths in the cefiderocol group and 9 
deaths in the BAT group. Eighteen of the deaths in the cefiderocol group were among subjects with 
pneumonia, 9 subjects had BSI/sepsis and 3 subjects were treated for cUTI. In the BAT group four, 
three and two subjects each were treated for pneumonia, BSI/sepsis and cUTI, respectively. 
Subgroup analyses 
Although the study size was small which makes subgroup analyses less valuable some of the analyses 
are noted (CR micro-ITT population): 
Clinical cure rates and microbiological eradication rates were essentially similar across treatment 
groups in the subgroups examined.

All-cause mortality at day 28 were higher in the cefiderocol group for patients treated for 
HAP/VAP/HCAP (32.5% vs. 15.8%) and BSI/sepsis (30.4% vs. 21.4%) for subjects infected with non-
fermenters (36.7% vs. 20.0%).

Supportive study 
APEKS-NP 
The APEKS-NP study was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, active-
controlled study to compare all-cause mortality, clinical and microbiological outcomes of treatment 
with cefiderocol or meropenem in adult subjects with documented HAP/VAP/HCAP caused by Gram-
negative pathogens. This study was not intended to form the basis for the indication applied for. 
However, the results of this study were requested by the CHMP because of the imbalance in mortality 
noted in the interim analysis of the CREDIBLE-CR study attributable to the subset of subjects with 
HAP/VAP/HCAP and the concern of low ELF penetration of cefiderocol. 
Methods 
Approximately 300 subjects were planned to be randomised (1:1) to receive either cefiderocol 2 g 
administered IV over 3 hours every 8 hours (q8h), or meropenem. Randomisation was stratified using 
infection diagnosis (HAP/VAP/HCAP) and APACHE II score (≤ 15 and ≥ 16) as allocation factors.

Subjects with reduced renal function, augmented renal clearance, or who were on various forms of 
haemodialysis had their doses of cefiderocol or meropenem adjusted. Linezolid was administered for at 
least 5 days to subjects in both arms to provide coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA), to maintain the study blind and, in the cefiderocol group, to provide coverage for 
Gram-positive bacteria. Sequential oral antibiotic (step-down) therapy was not permitted by the 
protocol. Systemic antibiotics, other than linezolid, meropenem, and cefiderocol, were not permitted 
from randomisation until TOC. Aerosolised antibiotics were not permitted from randomisation until 
after TOC. 
The subjects´ clinical status were evaluated at Early Assessment (EA) at Day 3 to 4, End of Treatment 
(EOT), Test of Cure (TOC) at EOT + 7 days, Follow-up (FUP) at EOT + 14 days, and End of Study 
(EOS) at EOT + 28 days. 
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population was the primary population for efficacy. The mITT 
population included all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, who either had 
evidence of an infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by a Gram-negative pathogen based on 
either a culture, Gram stain, or other diagnostic test, or a lower respiratory tract infection, but culture 
or other diagnostic tests did not provide a microbiological diagnosis. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was all-cause mortality at Day 14 calculated as the proportion of 
patients who experienced mortality regardless of the cause at or before Day 14 since first infusion of 
study drug. The clinical and microbiological outcomes per subject, and per pathogen, at the EA, EOT, 
TOC and/or FUP visits were secondary endpoints. 
The study design and the primary objective were based on the hypothesis that cefiderocol is 
noninferior to meropenem; established based on a 12.5% noninferiority margin, which was discussed 
and agreed with the US FDA. 
Results 
A total of 148 subjects treated with cefiderocol and 150 treated with meropenem comprised the ITT 
population. Of these 298 subjects, 292 were eligible for inclusion in the mITT population (145 in the 
cefiderocol group and 147 in the meropenem group). Exclusion from the mITT population was due to 
pneumonia caused only by Gram-positive bacteria (for 3 subjects in the cefiderocol group and 3 
subjects in the meropenem group). Of the subjects included in the mITT population, a total of 123 had 
VAP, 119 had HAP and 50 had HCAP and were equally distributed in the 2 treatment groups. 
The populations across the APEKS-NP study and patients with pneumonia in the CREDIBLE-CR study 
were generally similar with regard to age, gender distribution, APACHE score, creatinine clearance, and 
type of pneumonia with the majority of subjects in both studies requiring ventilation (74.6% in 
CREDIBLE-CR and 59.7% in APEKS-NP). It is noted, however, that the proportion of subjects with 
treatment failure was 64.2% in the CREDIBLE-CR study and 32.6% in the APEKS-NP study, and the 
proportion of subjects with A. baumannii was 55.2% in the CREDIBLE-CR study and 15.8% in the 
APEKS-NP study (see below).

In summary, the APEKS-NP study showed that cefiderocol was noninferior to meropenem for all-cause 
mortality at Day 14. The microbiological eradication rates and clinical cure rates were generally similar 
for cefiderocol and meropenem at TOC, with activity against the major causative pathogens. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In line with CHMP guidance for agents that are expected to address an unmet medical need the 
Applicant has conducted an abbreviated clinical programme to support the proposed indication 
treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative bacteria in adult patients with limited treatment 
options. 
In the initial submission, one phase 2 study in cUTI/pyelonephritis (APEKS-cUTI) and one phase 3 
study in different infection types caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens 
(CREDIBLE-CR) were the main clinical studies. The APEKS-cUTI study was conducted in an atypical 
population with cUTI and therefore cannot establish the efficacy of cefiderocol for the treatment of the 
target carbapenem-resistant organisms. It provides a comparison of the efficacy of cefiderocol vs. an 
approved carbapenem and useful safety and PK data. The CREDIBLE-CR study can only be regarded as 
supportive of efficacy for the intended indication because of its limited size. Therefore, the possible 
ability of cefiderocol to meet an unmet need i.e. treatment of carbapenem-resistant organisms 
expressing β-lactamases, particularly Ambler Class B or D enzymes - is based mainly on in-vitro data, 
on nonclinical efficacy data to determine PK/PD targets and on clinical PK data indicating that relevant 
PK/PD targets are met with the 2 g q8h regimen when using 3-h infusions. It is important to note that 
these data are pivotal to the application. 
During the assessment, the CHMP requested the Applicant to provide the results from a recently 
completed phase 3 study in HAP/VAP/HCAP (APEKS-NP). The results of this study were asked for 
because of the imbalance in mortality noted in the interim analysis of the CREDIBLE-CR study, which 
caused some concern regarding the efficacy of cefiderocol in the subset of subjects with 
HAP/VAP/HCAP. This potential concern was supported by the low ELF penetration of cefiderocol 
documented in healthy subjects. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
APEKS-cUTI 
The APEKS-cUTI study included hospitalised adult subjects with cUTI with or without pyelonephritis or 
acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis with evidence of pyuria and a positive urine culture that contained 
≥105 CFU/mL of a Gram-negative uropathogen likely susceptible to IMP. There was a 30% cap for 
acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were acceptable. 
Subjects were randomised to cefiderocol 2 g q8h administered over 1 h or IMP/CS 1 g q8h for (5) 7 to 
14 days. The choice of comparator and treatment duration was reasonable. According to the product 
information for IMP/CS in EU countries it is recommended that infections suspected or proven to be 
due to less susceptible bacterial species (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and very severe infections 
should be treated with 1000 mg q6h. However, because of the renal elimination of IMP/CS and 
subsequent accumulation in urine the 1000 mg q8h IMP/CS is acceptable. Nevertheless, in this study 
the imipenem dose was adjusted in accordance with baseline CrCL and body weight in line with US FDA 
recommendations that were current when the study started but later amended. When compared to the 
EU SmPCs for imipenem, there was concern that the dose adjustment schema could have led to under-
dosing in some subsets.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of microbiological eradication and clinical response 
outcomes at the TOC in the Micro-ITT population. The current CHMP guidance recommends primary 
efficacy endpoint in cUTI studies is microbiological eradication (defined as a reduction to <103 CFU/mL) 
at TOC. However, the antibacterial guideline is under revision. In the draft guideline it is proposed to 
change the primary endpoint to a combination of clinical and microbiological (defined as a reduction to 
<103 CFU/mL) success rate. The Applicant has presented results also according the current CHMP 
recommendation. 
The sample size was dimensioned to meet FDA requirements and is also acceptable to the CHMP. 
Initially, approximately 250-300 subjects were to be enrolled and randomised (2:1) with the 
estimation of the sample size based on a non-inferiority margin of 20%. The sample size was then 
clarified to approximately 300 subjects when an analysis using a non-inferiority margin of 15% was 
incorporated (amendment 1, protocol Version 2 05 Aug 2015). Further amendments increased the 
sample size to increase the safety database; from 300 to 400 (amendment 2, protocol version 3 30 
Nov 2015) to be able to provide the majority of subjects for the safety evaluation of the drug and 
again from 400 to 450 (amendment 3, protocol version 4 26 Apr 2016) to have a total of 300 subjects 
treated with cefiderocol. These changes were all made to meet FDA requirements. 
The randomisation was stratified according to the subject´s clinical diagnosis and region where region 
was added with protocol amendment 1 (05 Aug 2015), i.e. 6 months after start of recruitment (the 
first subject´s first visit was 5 February 2015). With each increase in the sample size the expected 
number of subjects with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis was re-calculated; the limit of 30% was 
however kept throughout the study. 
Study treatments were dispensed and administered in a double-blinded fashion. The methodologies for 
these procedures were acceptable. 
The statistical analysis plan was overall appropriate. Multiplicity considerations concerned only the 
primary endpoint and were implemented in that non-inferiority was initially to be concluded based on a 
NI margin of 20% and, if shown, based on a tighter margin (15%) according to a regulatory (/FDA) 
requirement. The primary analysis was performed on the micro-ITT population with sensitivity analyses 
performed on the ITT and the ME populations. 
Four-hundred ninety-five subjects were screened and 452 enrolled in a 2 to 1 ratio to receive 
cefiderocol or IMP/CS. Over 90% of the subjects in both treatment groups completed the study and 
completed treatment with similar rates in both groups for reasons of study and treatment 
discontinuation. 
Eleven subjects (10 of these were in the cefiderocol group) were removed from the analysis 
populations for efficacy because of GCP noncompliance at 2 study sites. Sixty-six subjects were 
excluded from the primary analysis population (Micro-ITT population) as they had no baseline Gram-
negative uropathogen with ≥ 105 CFU. 
Demographic and baseline subject characteristics were generally comparable for the treatment groups, 
although there were somewhat more males in the cefiderocol treatment group. 
Compliance and exposure to study drug and prior and concomitant exposure to other antibacterial 
agents were well balanced between the treatment groups although fewer concomitant antibiotics were 
used in the cefiderocol group. 
CREDIBLE-CR 
The CREDIBLE-CR study included hospitalised adult subjects with HAP/VAP/HCAP, cUTI and BSI/sepsis 
caused by a Gram-negative pathogen with evidence of carbapenem resistance. The BSI/sepsis 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 100/154 
 
 
 
infection category could include subjects with other infection types e.g. ABSSSI and cIAI. Infections in 
the CNS and infections requiring more than 3 weeks of antibiotic treatment such as bone and joint 
infections and endocarditis were excluded. However, because infections of unknown origin were 
acceptable for inclusion in the BSI/sepsis category, infections not suitable for evaluation could anyway 
be included (see below). HAP/VAP/HCAP, cUTI and cIAI are infection types most likely to be caused by 
pathogens of interest for the sought indication. Overall the inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
acceptable. 
The study compared cefiderocol 2 g q8h administered over 3 h and BAT (1 to 3 antibacterial agents). A 
single adjunctive antibacterial agent for HAP/VAP/HCAP or BSI/sepsis subjects was allowed. This was 
agreed by the CHMP before study initiation because investigators may not be willing to use 
monotherapy when MDR organisms are anticipated, especially in HAP/VAP. The recommended 
treatment duration was 7 to 14 days (minimum 5 days for cUTI and maximum 21 days for all infection 
types). 
The study primarily compared the clinical outcome at TOC in subjects with HAP/VAP/HCAP or 
BSI/sepsis and the microbiological outcome per subject at TOC in subjects with cUTI in the CR Micro-
ITT population in line with CHMP recommendations. 
The sample size was driven by feasibility and not by statistical considerations. The study size was 
discussed and agreed during scientific advice. 
Study subjects were randomised to receive cefiderocol or BAT regimen and the randomisation was 
stratified according to infection types with an aim to include approximately 50% HAP/VAP/HCAP and 
not more than 30% cUTI and remainder BSI/sepsis. The aim to avoid a deterministic allocation of 
treatment is appreciated. 
No inferential testing was planned. The descriptive nature of the final analysis is acknowledged. The 
planned sample size for the entire study was 150 subjects (~100 in cefiderocol group, ~50 in BAT 
group). 
A total of 258 subjects were screened and 152 enrolled in a 2 to 1 fashion to receive cefiderocol or 
BAT. A lower number of subjects in the cefiderocol group completed the study compared to the BAT 
group. The difference was mainly attributable to a higher number of deaths in the cefiderocol group. 
Because of the limited size of the study, differences in the between group baseline demographic and 
diseases characteristics are noted, but these differences were in general less than 10%. 
Subjects with HAP/VAP/HCAP represented approximately 50% of the subjects in both treatment 
groups; approximately 30% of the subjects had BSI/sepsis (25% vs 37%) and approximately 15% of 
the subjects had cUTI (21% vs. 13%). Among subjects within the BSI/sepsis category patients 
included seems generally not to have had infections in need of >3 weeks antibacterial treatment. 
Almost all subjects had moderate to severe disease severity. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter 
baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the major pathogens in 
subjects overall. 
In the cefiderocol group, 66/80 of subjects received cefiderocol monotherapy (14/80 received 
adjunctive therapy), whereas in the BAT group, 10/38 of subjects received monotherapy. In the BAT 
group, 25/38 of subjects received a colistin-based regimen. 
The mean duration of exposure for subjects with pneumonia or BSI/sepsis were one day shorter in the 
cefiderocol treatment group (11.4 days) compared to for subjects in the BAT group (12.6 days). The 
mean duration of exposure to cefiderocol for subjects with cUTI were 11.9 days and for BAT 7.4 days. 
Assessment report

Nearly all subjects had received prior antimicrobial therapy within 2 weeks prior to randomisation. 
Many subjects achieved concomitant antibacterial agents in addition to cefiderocol ± adjunctive 
therapy and BAT regimen. The concomitant antibacterial agents used included agents with activity 
against Gram-negative pathogens also including agents that could be active against CR nonsusceptible 
pathogens. 
APEKS-NP 
The APEKS-NP study was a Phase 3 study to compare all-cause mortality, clinical and microbiological 
outcomes of treatment with cefiderocol or meropenem in adult subjects with documented 
HAP/VAP/HCAP caused by Gram-negative pathogens. 
Approximately 300 subjects were planned to be randomised (1:1) to receive either cefiderocol 2 g 
administered IV over 3 hours every 8 hours (q8h), or meropenem. 
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population was the primary population for evaluating efficacy. The 
mITT population included all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, who 
either had evidence of an infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by a Gram-negative pathogen 
based on either a culture, Gram stain, or other diagnostic test, or a lower respiratory tract infection, 
but culture or other diagnostic tests did not provide a microbiological diagnosis. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was all-cause mortality at Day 14 calculated as the proportion of 
patients who experienced mortality regardless of the cause at or before Day 14 since first infusion of 
study drug. The clinical and microbiological outcomes per subject, and per pathogen, at the EA, EOT, 
TOC and/or FUP visits were secondary endpoints. 
The study design and the primary objective were based on the hypothesis that cefiderocol is 
noninferior to meropenem; established based on a 12.5% noninferiority margin, which was discussed 
and agreed with the US FDA. 
A total of 148 subjects treated with cefiderocol and 150 treated with meropenem comprised the ITT 
population. Of these 298 subjects, 292 were eligible for inclusion in the mITT population (145 in the 
cefiderocol group and 147 in the meropenem group). Exclusion from the mITT population was due to 
pneumonia caused only by Gram-positive bacteria (for 3 subjects in the cefiderocol group and 3 
subjects in the meropenem group). Of the subjects included in the mITT population, a total of 123 had 
VAP, 119 had HAP and 50 had HCAP and were equally distributed in the 2 treatment groups. 
The populations across the APEKS-NP study and patients with pneumonia in the CREDIBLE-CR study 
were generally similar with regard to age, gender distribution, APACHE score, creatinine clearance, and 
type of pneumonia with the majority of subjects in both studies requiring ventilation (74.6% in 
CREDIBLE-CR and 59.7% in APEKS-NP). It is noted, however, that the proportion of subjects with 
treatment failure was 64.2% in the CREDIBLE-CR study and 32.6% in the APEKS-NP study, and the 
proportion of subjects with A. baumannii was 55.2% in the CREDIBLE-CR study and 15.8% in the 
APEKS-NP study. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
APEKS-cUTI 
The response rate for the primary endpoint composite of clinical outcome and microbiological outcome 
at TOC in the Micro-ITT population was 72.6% of subjects in the cefiderocol group and 54.6% of 
subjects in the IPM/CS group. Noninferiority at the prespecified -20% and -15% margins were met. In 
addition, the results were consistent with superiority of cefiderocol compared with IPM/CS. Similar 
analyses in the ME population confirmed the results. 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 102/154 
 
 
 
Using the EU-recommended primary endpoint for studies in cUTI (microbiological eradication at TOC in 
the Micro-ITT population) and more stringent criterion for microbial eradication (<103 CFU/mL instead 
of <104 CFU/mL) essentially similar results were obtained. 
At baseline, 114/252 (45%) cefiderocol and 71/119 (60%) imipenem patients had dose adjustments 
based on baseline renal function and body weight. In this 2:1 randomisation study, the combined 
response rates at TOC in the cefiderocol group were lower in each dose adjustment group vs. the 
unadjusted dose group. However, the cefiderocol dose adjustment schema in this study was not the 
same as that sued in CREDIBLE-CR or APEKS-NP and is not that in the final SmPC. In the imipenem 
group, the two largest dose adjustment groups showed lower response rates vs. the unadjusted group. 
Thus, while the overall comparison gave rates of 54.2% for unadjusted vs. 50.7% for adjusted, the 
rates for the two largest groups (n=61 of the 71 with adjusted doses) were lower than for the 
unadjusted dose group (41.7% and 48.6% vs. 54.2%). Overall, the conclusion on superiority is 
considered unsafe. The study had 2:1 randomisation and used imipenem dose adjustments that are 
not in line with the revised recommendations in the US and the existing recommendations in the EU. 
However, the applicant did not claim an indication for treatment of cUTI. Therefore, this conclusion 
does not impact on the overall conclusions on the dossier. 
When the response rates were separated between clinical outcome and microbiological outcome it was 
clear that the composite response rates in favour or the cefiderocol arm at TOC and FU was driven by 
higher microbiological eradication rates. 
The treatment differences in the composite response rate at TOC by different subgroups were 
consistent with the treatment difference in the overall Micro ITT population. 
CREDIBLE-CR 
The clinical cure rates and microbiological eradication rates at TOC in the CR Micro-ITT population were 
similar for the cefiderocol and BAT treatment arms. Moreover, with regards the main pathogens 
studied (A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa), clinical and microbiological success rates 
were essentially similar at TOC although some numerical differences are noted which is likely an effect 
of the low number of each pathogen. For example, a somewhat lower clinical cure rate at TOC against 
A. baumannii is noted for cefiderocol compared with BAT. However, this difference changes in favour of 
cefiderocol at follow-up. 
The imbalance in mortality observed in the interim analysis remains in the full dataset. The overall all-
cause mortality at day 28 was higher in the cefiderocol group than in the BAT group. However, the 
imbalance is evident in both the HAP/VAP/HCAP and BSI/sepsis subsets, not just in patients with 
pneumonia. This update vs. the interim dataset does not suggest that the mortality difference in 
CREDIBLE-CR is driven by poor efficacy of cefiderocol in HAP/VAP per se. 
The difference in mortality rates between the cefiderocol and BAT treatment groups in the CREDIBLE-
CR study is unexplained although there are some indications of imbalances between the treatment 
groups responsible for a minor part of the difference, e.g. history of septic shock among subjects with 
A. baumannii infection. However, the mortality rate in the cefiderocol group was also higher than the 
mortality rate in the BAT group for subjects with A. baumannii who did not have a history of shock. 
Therefore, shock does not alone explain the difference in mortality. 
The CHMP considers the data point to a possible problem for cefiderocol in the treatment of 
Acinetobacter spp., with or without shock. Although there were no difference noted in mortality 
between the treatment groups in the APEKS-NP study with regards subjects infected with A. 
baumannii, the data from the typical HAP/VAP study population and from the UTI study cannot be used 
to rule out a real problem for cediferocol vs. carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter. It is considered 
relevant to inform the prescribers of the imbalance in mortality in the CREDIBLE-CR study and 
Assessment report

association between mortality and infection with Acinetobacter in the cefiderocol treatment arm. At the 
request of CHMP, an adequate warning mentioning the imbalance in mortality was included in section 
4.4 of the Fetcroja SmPC. 
APEKS-NP 
The APEKS-NP study showed that cefiderocol was noninferior to meropenem for the treatment of 
HAP/VAP/HCAP for all-cause mortality at Day 14 (the FDA-recommended primary endpoint). The EU-
recommended primary endpoint for a HAP/VAP study (HCAP should not be included) is clinical outcome 
at TOC using an NI-margin of -12.5%. This was just met since the clinical cure rates at TOC were 
64.8% for the cefiderocol group (94/145) and 66.7% for the meropenem group (98/147), with a 
treatment difference of -2.0 (95% CI: -12.5, 8.5). However, the study was not sized for the primary 
evaluation of non-inferiority with regards this endpoint. Overall, the clinical cure rates and the 
microbiological eradication rates were similar for cefiderocol and meropenem at TOC, and essentially 
similar success rates were noted against the major causative pathogens, including K. pneumoniae, P. 
aeruginosa, A. baumannii and E. coli. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall it is important to note that the pivotal data for the assessment of efficacy and the adequacy of 
the dose of Fetcroja for the intended indication are the in-vitro data, the nonclinical efficacy data to 
determine PK/PD targets and clinical PK data indicating that relevant PK/PD targets are met. Although 
the clinical programme was in line with CHMP guidance for agents with an aim to address an unmet 
medical need, the studies were not designed to establish the efficacy of cefiderocol for the treatment of 
the target carbapenem-resistant organisms and can only be regarded as supportive. This is because 
infections caused by carbapenem-resistant organisms were not specifically studied in the cUTI study 
and the CREDIBLE-CR study was too small to draw definitive conclusions on efficacy. 
Efficacy data from the APEKS-NP study and from patients with pneumonia in the CREDIBLE-CR study 
support the use of cefiderocol for the treatment of lung infections. Therefore, with regards to efficacy, 
there is no need to restrict the proposed pathogen-specific indication to exclude treatment of lung 
infections. 
The imbalance noted in mortality in the CREDIBLE-CR study is still unexplained. It is considered 
relevant to inform the prescribers of the imbalance in mortality in the CREDIBLE-CR study and 
association between mortality and infection with Acinetobacter in the cefiderocol treatment arm. At the 
request of CHMP, an adequate warning mentioning the imbalance in mortality was included in section 
4.4 of the Fetcroja SmPC. 
Development of resistance is regarded as efficacy concern and should be closely monitored during the 
post-marketing period. Any information that becomes available to the Applicant on emerging 
resistance, changing patterns of resistance or new mechanisms of resistance to the antibacterial agent 
should be notified promptly to EU regulators with a discussion of the possible implications for section 
5.1 of the SmPC. The Applicant should follow up and report this issue in the Periodic Safety Update 
Reports. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Sources of safety data 
The key clinical safety data package supporting this application consists of: 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 104/154 
 
 
 
•  A completed pathogen-based, open-label, Phase 3 study including 152 subjects with 
carbapenem-resistant, Gram-negative infections comparing cefiderocol with best available 
therapy (BAT) (CREDIBLE-CR). 
•  A completed Phase 2 study in subjects with complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) testing 
noninferiority of cefiderocol (n=300) versus imipenem and cilastatin (n=148) (IPM/CS) 
(APEKS-cUTI). 
•  A randomised, double-blind, Phase 3 study (Study 1615R2132, hereafter referred to as the 
APEKS-NP study) including 300 subjects with carbapenem-sensitive nosocomial pneumonia 
(hospital-acquired pneumonia [HAP]/ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]/healthcare-
associated pneumonia [HCAP]) due to Gram-negative pathogens. APEKS-NP was requested by 
the CHMP because of the imbalance in mortality noted in the imbalance in mortality noted in 
the interim analysis of CREDIBLE-CR attributable to the subset of subjects with HAP/VAP/HCAP 
and the concern of low ELF penetration of cefiderocol. The study was ongoing at the 1st round 
of this application, the results has been briefly presented within the 2nd round. 
The most directly relevant dataset for the indication and target population applied for is that from 
CREDIBLE-CR. However, double-blinded, direct comparison to a single, authorised monotherapy, as 
well as use of a faster infusion rate mean that the APEKS-cUTI dataset are still of value in the overall 
assessment of the safety profile, along with safety data collected in the Clinical Pharmacology studies. 
The Applicant also presented pooled safety data summaries. As the study populations, target 
organisms and comparator regimens differed considerably between the two studies, the safety 
outcomes are not directly comparable. Furthermore, there was no pre-specified SAP for pooling of data 
from these studies. Therefore, individual study data rather than pooled data are considered here. 
Additional supportive data come from 6 completed clinical pharmacology studies (also not pooled): 
o  Single-and multiple-ascending dose study (R2111) 
o 
Intrapulmonary (BAL/ELF) PK study (R2112) 
o  Renal impairment study (R2113) 
o  Mass balance study (R2114) 
o  Drug interaction study (R2115) 
o  Thorough QT/QTc study (R2116) 
The Compassionate Use data to date (14 patients as of 15 Aug 2018) comprise a tabulated listing of 
heterogeneous subjects with insufficiently detailed information. These will not be further discussed.

ARC = augmented renal clearance; BAT = best available therapy; BMI =  body mass index; cUTI = complicated 
urinary tract infection; max = maximum; min = minimum; SD =  standard deviation 
a  Creatinine clearance is calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula based on data from the central laboratory. 
APEKS-cUTI enrolled hospitalised male and female subjects at least 18 years of age with symptomatic 
cUTI with (26.8%) or without (46.9%) pyelonephritis, and uncomplicated pyelonephritis (26.3%). Most 
subjects (71.4%) were classified as having moderately severe disease. The baseline disease 
characteristics, including relative proportions of different infection types, severity of infection, duration 
of cUTI prior to randomisation, reasons complicating cUTI and medical history were similar between 
the treatment groups. The most frequently reported prior infection history was cUTI (around a third in 
both treatment groups). Overall, 18.7% of cefiderocol and 20.3% of IMP/CS subjects received 
concomitant antimicrobials (most frequently fluoroquinolones and nitrofurantoin derivatives), while 
82.9% of cefiderocol and 84.0% of IMP/CS subjects received concomitant non-antimicrobial 
medications.

Of the subjects enrolled in the APEKS-NP, 125 (41.9%) had ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), 
121 (40.6&) had hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and 52 (17.4%) were diagnosed with healthcare-
associated pneumonia (HCAP). 
CREDIBLE-CR enrolled hospitalised male and female subjects at least 18 years of age with 
HAP/VAP/HCAP (45%), BSI/sepsis (31%) or cUTI (24%) caused by a carbapenem-resistant Gram-
negative pathogen. There were slightly more cUTI patients in the cefiderocol group in the Safety 
Population. More subjects had severe baseline disease in the cefiderocol group. Other baseline disease 
characteristics, including Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score, Clinical Pulmonary Infection 
Score, APACHE II score, and past medical history were similar between the treatment groups.  
BAT was not defined as one single active comparator drug or regimen, but 1 to 3 antibiotic agents 
selected as per local standard of care. Furthermore, subjects with HAP/VAP/HCAP or BSI randomised to 
cefiderocol were permitted to receive a second Gram negative antibiotic (not polymyxins or 
cephalosporin/beta-lactam inhibitor combinations) at the discretion of the investigator, and subjects in 
either group with mixed Gram-positive or anaerobic infections may have received appropriate 
concomitant narrow spectrum antibiotics (e.g., vancomycin, linezolid, metronidazole, clindamycin). 
This led to a diverse range of regimens used, which further confounds the comparison of safety events. 
Patient exposure 
Across the clinical programme, 761 subjects have been exposed to single doses of cefiderocol from 100 
mg to 4g, or multiple doses of up to 2g for up to a maximum of 21 days, including 212 healthy 
subjects or volunteers with renal impairment who received single doses of cefiderocol from 100 mg to 
4 g or multiple doses of 1 g or 2 g q8h for 10 days, and 14 patients treated under compassionate use. 
A total of 435 subjects in the clinical safety and efficacy studies who received the proposed dose of 2g 
q8h for multiple doses, generally for 7 to 14 days.

The safety database for the proposed therapeutic dose of 2g iv over 3h q8h in subjects with CR-
organisms and limited therapeutic options comes solely from the CREDIBLE-CR study and is therefore 
limited (101 subjects with complete data). However, such a dataset could in principle provide sufficient 
safety reassurances, complemented by data in healthy volunteers and cUTI subjects, to support the 
application, in accordance with the limited clinical development programme agreed with CHMP at the 
time of Scientific Advice in view of the potential to meet an unmet clinical need. The remainder of the 
safety database comprises mostly subjects receiving 1 h infusions in the Clinical Pharmacology studies 
and in APEKS-cUTI, but it is reasonable to expect that a slower, 3 h infusion rate will not adversely 
affect tolerability.

Overview of AEs in APEKS-NP study (Safety populations) 
2.6.1.1.  Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) 
Clinical Pharmacology studies 
TEAEs occurred infrequently in Clinical Pharmacology studies, were mostly mild in severity and almost 
all resolved spontaneously without intervention. No severe or serious AEs were reported. There were 
no dose-dependent trends in the frequency or type of TEAEs observed.  
Phase 2/3 studies 
The frequency of TEAEs was notably higher in CREDIBLE-CR, in which almost all subjects reported at 
least 1 TEAE, than in APEKS-cUTI. This is consistent with more severe clinical condition of the enrolled 
study population. The most frequently reported TEAEs for cefiderocol across both studies belong to the 
Gastrointestinal Disorders and Infections and Infestations SOCs. 
The overall frequency of TEAEs was slightly lower for cefiderocol than IMP/CS in APEKS-cUTI. The 
Preferred Terms reported were similar/overlapping between treatment groups and the absolute 
frequencies of most individual terms were low. Severe TEAEs were infrequent (2% cefiderocol group 
and 3.4% IMP/CS group). No severe TEAE Preferred Terms were reported for more than 1 subject in 
either treatment group. The severe TEAEs reported were anaemia, cardiorespiratory arrest, 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, melaena, pneumonia, ALT increased, AST increased, gout, dyspnoea, 
and pleural effusion in the cefiderocol group. 
In the APEKS-NP study most of the subjects in the cefiderocol group and meropenem group 
experienced at least 1 TEAE (87.8% [130/148] and 86.0% [129/150], respectively). Specifically, the 
most common TEAEs were urinary tract infection in the cefiderocol group (in 15.5% [23/148] of 
subjects compared with 10.7% [16/150] in the meropenem group) and hypokalaemia in the 
meropenem group (in 15.3% [23/150] of subjects compared with 10.8% [16/148] in the cefiderocol 
group). 
The overall frequency of TEAEs was similar for cefiderocol and BAT in CREDIBLE-CR. Diarrhoea was the 
most commonly reported AE in the cefiderocol group (18.8% [19/101] of subjects), while 
hyperkalaemia was the most commonly reported AE in the BAT group (12.2% [6/49] of subjects). The 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 111/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
small study size and low absolute frequencies of most Preferred Terms means only an approximate 
comparison between the treatment groups is possible. Some TEAEs were reported more frequently for 
cefiderocol, while others were reported more frequently for BAT. This is possibly a reflection of the 
heterogeneous nature of the treatment(s) received in the both groups and the open-label study design, 
which may impact how TEAEs are reported. 
The higher incidences of diarrhoea and elevated liver transaminases with cefiderocol treatment is 
discussed in the section on Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs). 
The higher incidences of cardiac arrest, and pneumonia in the cefiderocol group in CREDIBLE-CR are 
discussed in section 4.4. Serious adverse events and deaths.  
Chest pain was reported in 5.9% (6/47) of subjects in the cefiderocol group and 0 subjects in the BAT 
group, affecting subjects with all infection types. These events were reviewed. The majority of cases of 
chest pain were considered by the investigator to be noncardiovascular in nature and not related to 
cefiderocol. One subject had a medical history of myocardial infarction 3 months before randomisation, 
and the TEAE of chest pain was treated with nitroglycerin, oral isosorbide nitrate, and diltiazem.  The 
remaining subjects experienced chest pain that recovered with no treatment and while continuing to 
receive the study drug or recovered after administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or 
opioids, suggesting a noncardiovascular nature for the chest pain.

The frequency of treatment-related TEAEs was similar between comparative treatment groups in 
CREDIBLE-CR and between comparative treatment groups in APEKS-cUTI. The overall frequency of 
treatment-related TEAEs was higher in CREDIBLE-CR. The incidence of each treatment related TEAE 
(Preferred Term) was low across both studies. No individual treatment-related TEAE was reported in 
>2 subjects in CREDIBLE-CR or >4 subjects in APEKS-cUTI.  
The types of TEAEs reported by the investigators as treatment-related were generally similar in the 
CREDIBLE-CR and cUTI studies. The most frequently reported SOCs were Gastrointestinal disorders 
and Infections and infestations. Diarrhoea (2% [2/101], ALT increased, and AST increased were the 
most commonly reported treatment-related AEs (3% each; 3/101 subjects) in the cefiderocol group; 
while acute kidney injury were the most commonly reported treatment-related AE in the BAT group 
(8.2%; 4/49 subjects), in CREDIBLE-CR. 
2.6.1.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
Cefiderocol is a cephalosporin. Known effects for these drugs include C. difficile related adverse effects 
and diarrhoea, hypersensitivity including rash, seizures and epilepsy, liver-related adverse effects 
including liver biochemistry and clotting tests, and bone marrow suppression. These events were 
closely monitored during the studies. In addition, since cefiderocol is a siderophore antibiotic, potential 
effects on iron transport were investigated in the Phase 2/3 studies. 
•  Clostridium difficile-related AEs 
In CREDIBLE-CR, the incidence of TEAEs related to C. difficile was low, with only 4 subjects 
experiencing C. difficile-related TEAEs (including preferred terms of C. difficile infection and 
pseudomembranous colitis), of which 3 (2.9%) treated with cefiderocol and 1 (2.0%) treated with BAT. 
The incidence of diarrhoea was 18.8% (19/101) of subjects in the cefiderocol group and 12.2% (6/49) 
of subjects in the BAT group. The majority of the TEAEs of diarrhoea were mild in severity; none was 
severe, and none led to discontinuation of study drug.  
In APEKS-cUTI, 0.3% (1/300) of subjects in the cefiderocol group had a TEAE related to C. difficile 
compared with 3.4% (5/148, of which 2 were SAEs) of subjects in the IPM/CS group. Diarrhoea was 
reported for 4.3% (13/300) of subjects in the cefiderocol group compared with 6.1% (9/148) of 
subjects in the IPM/CS group. All TEAEs of diarrhoea were considered to be mild or moderate. Two

subjects, 1 in each treatment group had diarrhoea that was an SAE. One subject, in the cefiderocol 
group was discontinued due to a nonserious TEAE of diarrhoea.  
In APEKS-NP, the incidence of TEAEs related to C. difficile was low, with 8 subjects experiencing C. 
difficile-related TEAEs (including preferred terms of C. difficile infection), of which 4 (2.7%) treated 
with cefiderocol and 4 (2.7%) treated with BAT. 
C. difficile-associated diarrhoea is listed as an ADR in SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8, which is appropriate. 
•  Hypersensitivity and rash 
Mild and moderate TEAEs relating to rash were reported very infrequently in the Clinical Pharmacology 
studies. All resolved spontaneously without intervention. One subject with moderate renal impairment 
in the renal impairment Study R2113 reported a TEAE of moderate urticaria that was considered by the 
investigator to be related to the study drug and that led to discontinuation of the study drug and 
premature withdrawal from the study. 
No SAEs related to rash/hypersensitivity were reported in the either CREDIBLE-CR, APEKS-NP or 
APEKS-cUTI. The high frequency of hypersensitivity seen in CREDIBLE-CR is perhaps unsurprising, 
given the multiple medications received by these clinically unwell subjects, including in many cases 
multiple antibiotics. Given this is a known class risk, a causal relationship is a possibility for some 
events. 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including warnings regarding previous hypersensitivity to other beta-lactam 
antibiotics, are listed as an ADR in SmPC sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8, which is appropriate.

•  Seizures 
In CREDIBLE-CR, in the cefiderocol group, 1 subject experienced 3 mild TEAEs of seizure. The subject 
had hypoglycaemia associated with haemodialysis, which was considered as the cause of seizures. In 
the BAT group, 1 subject experienced a treatment-related SAE of status epilepticus.  
In APEKS-cUTI, in the cefiderocol treatment group, 1 subject with a medical history of epilepsy had a 
moderate TEAE of epilepsy.

• 
Liver function 
In CREDIBLE-CR, ALT increased was reported in 6.9% (7/101) of subjects in the cefiderocol group 
(affecting subjects with all infection types) and 0 subjects in the BAT group. Other TEAEs reported 
were AST increased 7.9% (8/101),and blood ALP increased 2.0% (2/101); and hepatic cirrhosis, 
hepatic failure, hepatic function abnormal, hepatitis, GGT increased, INR increased and liver function 
test abnormal for 1 subject each in the cefiderocol group (affecting subjects with all infection types), 
all vs 0 subjects in the BAT group. Underlying disease or concomitant medication existed as 
confounding factors or alternative aetiology was suggested by the Applicant for most of the subjects, 
although the events for 2 subjects were considered related to cefiderocol by the investigators.  
In APEKS-cUTI, liver events were reported for 0.7% (2/300) subjects treated with cefiderocol and 
0.7% (1/148) of subject treated with IPM/CS.  
Cephalosporins have been reported to affect liver function. Effects on liver enzymes are listed as an 
ADR in SmPC section 4.8, which is appropriate. 
•  Bone marrow suppression 
In CREDIBLE-CR, as per the interim CSR, the most commonly reported TEAE that could suggest bone 
marrow suppression was anaemia (7.9% [8/101] of subjects in the cefiderocol group and 4.1% [2/49] 
of subjects in the BAT group). All other TEAEs that could suggest bone marrow suppression were 
reported for ≤ 2 subjects in each treatment group and were similar between treatment groups. None 
of these TEAEs led to discontinuation of study treatment. Severe infection itself can affect bone 
marrow function, which complicates conclusions regarding causality. However, given the known class 
effect of bone marrow suppression, non-clinical findings of decreased red cell parameters, and 
frequency of this category of TEAEs in CREDIBLE-CR, a causal relationship remains a possibility. 
Transient decrease in haemoglobin was noted in cefiderocol treated subjects in both CREDIBLE-CR and 
APEKS-NP studies.  
In APEKS-cUTI, reported TEAEs included anaemia (1 subject in each group), haemorrhagic anaemia (1 
cefiderocol), iron deficiency anaemia (1 cefiderocol), and haematocrit decreased (1 IPM/CS). 
• 
Iron homeostasis 
TEAEs related to iron homeostasis were very infrequent across the Phase 2/3 studies. Overall, there is 
no indication from the Phase 2/3 safety data that cefiderocol systemically impacts iron chemistry 
values in the target population at therapeutic doses. However, one subject in CREDIBLE-CR 
experienced deranged iron chemistry values following an incorrect dose of cefiderocol,).

Fewer SAEs were reported with cefiderocol than IMP/CS in APEKS-cUTI and APEKS-NP. Individual 
Preferred Terms were generally reported by one or a few subjects, therefore robust comparison of the 
groups is limited. All specific SAEs were reported for 1 or 2 subjects in a treatment group, and no 
notable differences between groups were observed for any preferred term. The most frequently 
reported SAE in APEKS-cUTI was C. difficile colitis, affecting 1/300 (0.3%) in the cefiderocol group and 
2/148 (1.4%) in the IMP/CS group.

The frequency of serious AEs was notably higher in CREDIBLE-CR, which is consistent with more 
severe clinical condition of the enrolled study population. The overall rate of SAEs was approximately 
similar between the cefiderocol group (49.5% [50/101] of subjects) and the BAT group (46.9% 
[23/49] of subjects), where the final data shown a similar frequency of septic shock (11.9% [12/101] 
of subjects) and BAT (12.2% [6/49] of subjects). However, the higher incidences specifically of cardiac 
arrest (4.0% [4/101] subjects in the cefiderocol group and two subjects in the BAT group), and 
pneumonia (5.0% [5/101] subjects in the cefiderocol group and one subjects in the BAT group) in the 
cefiderocol group in CREDIBLE-CR are further discussed below in relation to a higher rate of fatal SAEs 
in the cefiderocol group. 
2.6.1.4.  Deaths 
APEKS-cUTI 
One death, in a subject treated with cefiderocol, was reported in APEKS-cUTI. On Day 7 of cefiderocol 
treatment, the subject, a 76-year-old white male with a complex past medical history had an SAE of 
cardio-respiratory arrest of unknown cause, that was not considered by the investigator to be related 
to study drug. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was unsuccessful, and the subject died on the same day. 
The subject had not previously reported any TEAEs since starting study medication. 
APEKS-NP 
The primary objective of this study was to compare all-cause mortality between the 2 study treatments 
at Day 14 after start of study drug therapy in the mITT population. Cefiderocol was non-inferior to 
meropenem as the difference between treatment was 0.8% with 95% CI of -6.6, 8.2%. All-cause 
mortality rates for the mITT population at Day 14 were 12.4% (18/145) for cefiderocol and 11.6% 
(17/146) for meropenem. In the safety population, there were 74 subjects who experienced SAEs with 
a fatal outcome in the study, 39 (26.4%) subjects in the cefiderocol group and 35 (23.3%) subjects in 
the meropenem group. Overall, the frequency of SAEs leading to death was 49 events in 39/148 
(26.4%) subjects in the cefiderocol group and 50 events in 35/150 (23.3%) in the meropenem group.

Survival Time up to End of Study (modified Intent-to-Treat Population 
CREDIBLE-CR 
In the interim report (15 Aug 2018) the mortality analysis showed that a total of 27 subjects died of 
which 21 were treated with cefiderocol and 6 of them treated with BAT. This imbalance in mortality 
rate was also observed when the final data of the study was analysed, where a total of 43 subjects 
experienced SAEs with a fatal outcome with onset before the End of Study; 34 (33.7% of 101 
subjects) in the cefiderocol group and 9 (18.4% of 49 subjects) in the BAT group. In the final data set 
for CREDIBLE-CR, 50 subjects are known to have died, 36 of 101 (35.6%) treated with cefiderocol and 
14 of 49 (28.6%) treated with BAT. The applicant claims that 7 of the subjects (2 from the cefiderocol 
group and 5 from the BAT group) died after study completion and these were not collected in a 
systematic way and detailed mortality data for these subjects is not included in the study database. 
The 7 subjects were: 2AA001 (died on Day 89, cause of death not available) and 3HK002 (died due to 
urosepsis) in the cefiderocol group, and 3HN001 (died on Day 43 due to sepsis), 3HJ001 (died due to 
septic shock), 3HJ004 (died on Day 108 due to cardiopulmonary arrest), 3HM003 (sudden cardiac 
death), and 3FG010 (died Day 53 due to septic shock and cardiac arrest) in the BAT group.  
In contrast to the interim report where the imbalance was mainly noted in the HAP/VAP/HCAP groups, 
the imbalance in mortality was seen for subjects with BSI/sepsis (36.7% for cefiderocol and 17.6% for 
BAT) as well as those with HAP/VAP/HCAP (42.2% for cefiderocol versus 18.2% for BAT) in the final 
dataset.

Subjects with Adverse Events Leading to Death by System Organ Class 
and Preferred Term Safety Population 
The most common SAE leading to death by preferred term was septic shock, reported in 10.9% 
(11/101) in the cefiderocol group compared with 6.1% (3/49) in the BAT group. Other SAEs leading to 
death that were reported in ≥2 subjects in either treatment group and that were reported more 
frequently in the cefiderocol group than in the BAT group were pneumonia (5.0% [5/101] vs. 0% of 
subjects), sepsis (3.0% [3/101] vs. 0% of subjects) and bacteraemia, oliguria and respiratory failure 
(each reported in 2.0% [2/101] vs. 0% of subjects).

Six of the 7 subjects who died of pneumonia/pneumonia bacterial/pneumonia aspiration had 
pneumonia as diagnosis for inclusion in the study. 
Host and pathogen factors 
The impact of potentially relevant host and pathogen factors on mortality has been further 
investigated. All deaths in the CREDIBLE-CR final dataset and in the APEKS-NP study have been 
investigated for the following potentially relevant host and pathogen factors: age, sex, race, region, 
diagnosis, renal function at baseline, hepatic impairment (CREDIBLE-CR only), Acute Physiology and 
Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score at baseline, baseline pathogen and MIC, medical history, 
clinical outcome, microbiological outcome, and treatment duration. In addition, as the CREDIBLE-CR 
study was an open-label study, all deaths in this study were reviewed by a blinded adjudication 
committee who were asked to determine cause of death as attributable to the Gram-negative infection 
for which the subject was enrolled in the study or attributable to some alternative reason.

Among the subjects treated with cefiderocol 42/101 (41.6%) subjects in the cefiderocol group and 
17/49 (34.7%) subjects in the BAT group had infection with Acinetobacter spp. There were 29 subjects 
in the cefiderocol group and 10 subjects in the BAT group with HAP/VAP/HCAP, and 12 subjects in the 
cefiderocol group and 7 subjects in the BSI sepsis group with Acinetobacter spp. infection; there was 
only 1 subject (in the cefiderocol group) with cUTI who had Acinetobacter spp. Overall for subjects with 
Acinetobacter spp., the 28-day mortality was 38.1% in the cefiderocol group and 17.6% in the BAT 
group, and at the end of study was 50.0% in the cefiderocol group compared with 17.6% in the BAT 
group. For subjects without Acinetobacter spp., the mortality rates were similar in the 2 groups 
(15.3% for cefiderocol and 18.8% for BAT for 28-day mortality; 22.0% for cefiderocol and 18.8% for 
BAT at end of study). Results were similar for HAP/VAP/HCAP and for BSI/sepsis.

•  Haematology 
In CREDIBLE-CR a slightly greater percentage of subjects in the cefiderocol group than in the BAT 
group had a decrease in haemoglobin ≥ 1.5 g/dL (27.8% [27/101] versus 24.5%12/49], respectively). 
In APEKS-NP study a higher proportion of subjects with decreases ≥ 1.5 g/dL in haemoglobin at the 
end of treatment was observed for the cefiderocol groups (29.4%) compared to meropenem (21.8%). 
Cefiderocol subjects in CREDIBLE-CR also experienced anaemia as a TEAE (8 [7.9%]) more frequently 
than BAT (2 [4.1%]).

The incidence of elevated liver enzymes was higher for cefiderocol in CREDIBLE-CR and is reflected in 
the higher reporting rate of liver-related TEAEs in this group (see also section on adverse events of 
special interest). Changes in liver enzymes were generally mild or moderate severity and recovered 
when treatment with cefiderocol was discontinued. These effects are listed as ADRs in SmPC section 
4.8. Review of biochemical data and relevant clinical data did not identify any subjects who met the 
criteria for Hy’s law in either CREDIBLE-CR or APEKS-cUTI.  
The imbalance between the 2 treatment groups in the incidence of PT-INR >1.5 in APEKS-cUTI is 
largely explained by the use of concomitant anticoagulant therapy in 15/20 cefiderocol-treated 
subjects who met this criterion and 2/3 IMP/CS-treated subjects who met the same criterion. Excluding 
such subjects, the number of non-anticoagulant associated events are 5 (1.67%) for cefiderocol and 1 
(0.68%) for IMP/CS. 
•  Vital signs 
Overall, the clinical data do not suggest any trends or systematic effect of cefiderocol on vital signs. 
•  Electrocardiogram 
Findings from the non-clinical programme included QTc prolongation in monkeys (NOEL 300 mg/kg/d, 
safety margin 8x). There were no treatment-related or dose-dependent trends in ECG measurements 
in the Clinical Pharmacology studies. Results of a well-conducted Thorough QT/QTc Study R2116 
indicate that cefiderocol does not prolong QT at supratherapeutic doses up to 4g over 3h 
(corresponding to Cmax and exposure at least double that expected for the proposed therapeutic 
dose). Thus, it is concluded that the non-clinical findings at extremely high doses are unlikely to be 
relevant to clinical use of the approved dose. 
In CREDIBLE-CR, ECG measurements were only routinely made at Screening for safety assessments. 
The limited data available did not suggest an effect of cefiderocol on ECGs. In the Cardiac Disorders 
SOC, the incidence of TEAEs  (bradycardia: 3.0% and 6.1%, respectively; atrial fibrillation: 2.0% and 
2.0%, respectively; tachycardia: 1.0% and 4.1% respectively and atrial flutter and sinus tachycardia 
were each reported in 1 subject in the BAT group and no subjects in the cefiderocol group) did not 
suggest an effect of cefiderocol associated with cardiac disorders.  
In APEKS-cUTI, following DSMB concerns that ECG data appeared to be outside physiological limits, 
copies of all ECGs were obtained and sent to an independent cardiologist who was asked to perform a 
blinded reading and reinterpretation of all available ECGs. The parameters derived from manual 
centralised reading by an independent cardiologist were considered the reliable dataset. The data did 
not indicate systematic QT prolongation with cefiderocol.

Safety in special populations 
•  Race 
The impact of potentially relevant host factors such as race and gender were evaluated further with 
respect to the imbalance in mortality. Even though the frequency of mortality was slightly higher in the 
Asian population in the CREDIBLE-CR, the sample size is limited, and this difference was not seen in 
APEKS-NP.  
•  Renal impairment 
In the renal impairment Study R2113, no other type of dialysis than intermittent haemodialysis was 
studied. 
Subjects with creatinine clearance <21 mL/min, oliguria (<20 mL/hour over 24h) or receiving 
haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or haemofiltration were not eligible for enrolment in APEKS-cUTI. 
Over half of subjects had some degree of renal impairment, although very few had severe impairment 
(8 (2.7%) cefiderocol, 7 (4.7%) IMP/CS) and none had augmented renal clearance. Cefiderocol dosing 
was adjusted for bodyweight and creatinine clearance (calculated from Cockcroft-Gault equation), but 
this did not include augmented renal clearance or renal replacement therapy.  
Subjects on peritoneal dialysis were not eligible for enrolment in CREDIBLE-CR. The majority of 
subjects had altered renal function (either augmented or impaired). Greater proportions of subjects in 
the cefiderocol group had moderate or severe renal impairment (moderate 22.8% vs 16.3%; severe 
19.8% vs 14.3%). Cefiderocol dosing was adjusted for creatinine clearance and BSA-adjusted 
creatinine clearance (calculated from Cockcroft-Gault and MDRD equations), including augmented renal 
clearance and renal replacement therapy. 
There was no notable trend in the overall frequency of TEAEs with regard to renal function in either 
individual study. Of the fatal SAEs reported in the cefiderocol group in CREDIBLE-CR, the 3 events of 
cardiac arrest occurred in subjects with moderate (2) or severe renal impairment (1), while the 3 
events of pneumonia occurred in subjects with mild (2) or moderate (1) renal impairment and the 6 
events of septic shock were distributed across the full spectrum of renal impairment.  
•  Hepatic impairment 
No dedicated studies in subjects with hepatic impairment have been conducted for cefiderocol, given 
that the primary route of elimination is renal excretion of unchanged drug. Subjects with AST, ALT, ALP 
or total bilirubin >3x ILN were not eligible for enrolment in APEKS-cUTI, however similar exclusions 
were not applied in CREDIBLE-CR.  
No dose adjustment for hepatic impairment is proposed by the Applicant, as cefiderocol PK is not 
expected to be affected. 
• 
Pregnancy and lactation 
No pregnancies with cefiderocol have been reported up to the data cut-off date for this submission of 
15 Aug 2018. The safety of cefiderocol in pregnancy and lactation, and effects on human fertility, are 
not known and as such this is considered Missing Information. Conclusions from the pre-clinical data 
and the lack of human data need to be adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
•  Age and gender 
The mean age of subjects enrolled in both CREDIBLE-CR and APEKS-cUTI was >60 years, reflecting 
the incidence of the respective indications in the older population. Therefore, the extent of exposure of 
Assessment report

older subjects as a proportion of subjects enrolled across the Phase 2/3 studies is reasonable. 
Approximately equal numbers of male and female subjects were enrolled across the Phase 2/3 studies. 
TEAE data per study categorised by age and gender, and listed by SOC and PT, presented in the 
Applicant’s Integrated Summary of Safety, indicate no notable trends with age or gender in the 
respective studies in the total frequency of TEAEs. Absolute numbers in the oldest age categories and 
for individual Preferred Terms make more granular assessment difficult, but no safety signal for any 
individual Preferred Term for cefiderocol treatment is noted. In CREDIBLE-CR, 37% of the subjects 
were at the age 18 to <65 and 64% were ≥65 years of age.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Clinical Pharmacology studies 
Of the 236 subjects included in the size clinical pharmacology studies, 3 subjects discontinued study 
treatment prematurely due to AEs (moderate pyrexia, moderate urticaria, mild hepatic enzymes 
elevated).

Phase 2/3 studies 
In CREDIBLE-CR, a greater percentage of subjects in cefiderocol group (9.9% [10/101]) than in the 
BAT group (6.1% [3/49]) experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment. The 
difference is largely due to the higher mortality rate in the cefiderocol group. Septic shock leading to 
discontinuation occurred in 4 subjects in the cefiderocol group and 0 subjects in the BAT group; both 
events were SAEs. No other TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment occurred in more than 
1 subject.  
Reasons for discontinuation from CREDIBLE-CR study (including after successful completion of study 
treatment) included lost to follow up (0.7% (1/150), 1 subject was in the cefiderocol group), 
withdrawal by subject (2.0% [3/150], 1 subject in cefiderocol group and 2 in the BAT), and death 
(overall 25.7% (39/150), 29.7% [30/101] in the cefiderocol group and 17.6% [9/49] in the BAT 
group). 
In APEKS-cUTI, 1.7% (5/300) of subjects in the cefiderocol group and 2.0% (3/148) of subjects in the 
IPM/CS group had TEAEs leading to discontinuation from treatment or premature withdrawal from the 
study. No TEAE that led to discontinuation was reported in > 1 subject. 
In the APEKS-NP, 27.3% (82/298) discontinued the study. Reasons included withdrawal by subject 
1.7% (5/298) 2 subjects in cefiderocol group and 3 in the meropenem, and death 24.3% (overall 
73/298, 26.4% [39/148] in the cefiderocol group and 22.4% [34/150] in the meropenem group).  
2.6.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database for cefiderocol is based on one completed phase 2 trial (APEKS-cUTI) and two 
completed phase 3 trials (CREDIBLE-CR and APEKS-NP). APEKS-cUTI included subjects with 
complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) testing noninferiority of cefiderocol (n=300) versus imipenem 
and cilastatin (n=148) (IPM/CS). CREDIBLE-CR included subjects with carbapenem-resistant, Gram-
negative infections and compared cefiderocol (n=101) with best available therapy(n=49) (BAT). 
APEKS-NP was requested by the CHMP because of the imbalance in mortality noted in the imbalance in 
mortality noted in the interim analysis of CREDIBLE-CR attributable to the subset of subjects with 
HAP/VAP/HCAP and the concern of low ELF penetration of cefiderocol. The study included carbapenem-
sensitive HAP/VAP/HCAP subjects treated with cefiderocol (n=148) and meropenem (n=150). All 
subjects treated with cefiderocol received the recommended dose of 2 g q8h. 
A thorough QT/QTc study conducted in healthy volunteers indicates no clinically significant effect of 
cefiderocol on the QT interval in humans at supratherapeutic doses up to 4g over 3 hours, and this is 
supported by ECG findings from APEKS-cUTI. 
Within both individual CREDIBLE-CR, APEKS-NP and APEKS-cUTI studies, the overall incidence of 
TEAEs, severe TEAEs and SAEs was similar to the comparator group. The most frequently reported 
TEAEs for cefiderocol across clinical studies belong to the Gastrointestinal Disorders and Infections and 
Infestations SOCs. The frequency of TEAEs, severe TEAEs and SAEs was (not unexpectedly) highest in 
CREDIBLE-CR, which enrolled the most clinically unwell study population and in which most subjects 
(92%) reported at least 1 TEAE, 38.6% reported a severe TEAE and 42.6% reported an SAE.  
The most frequently reported individual Preferred Terms for cefiderocol in CREDIBLE-CR were 
diarrhoea, vomiting, ALT increased, chest pain, decubitus ulcer, dyspnoea, pyrexia, septic shock, 
agitation, anaemia, AST increased, constipation and nausea, all reported in >10% of subjects receiving 
cefiderocol. The small study size, heterogeneity of treatments received in each treatment group and 
low absolute frequencies of most Preferred Terms means only an approximate comparison between the 
treatment groups in CREDIBLE-CR is possible.

The most frequently reported individual Preferred Terms for cefiderocol in APEKS-cUTI were ALT 
increased, AST increased, CK increased, WBC increased, diarrhoea, pyrexia and rash, all reported in 
>10% of subjects receiving cefiderocol. 
The adverse effects of cephalosporins are well known and these events were monitored closely as 
AESIs in the clinical studies. These adverse effects included C. difficile-related diarrhoea, 
rash/hypersensitivity, seizures/epilepsy, liver-related adverse effects including liver biochemistry and 
clotting tests, and bone marrow suppression. All of these known class effects were reported, though at 
low frequency, in the Phase 2/3 studies, with no unexpected findings. Liver chemistry effects were 
generally mild or moderate and reversible, and no subject met the criteria for Hy’s law. C. difficile-
associated diarrhoea, hypersensitivity, seizures (class effect) and effects on hepatic enzymes are 
described in SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8, which is appropriate. 
The most notable safety finding is the higher incidences of fatal SAEs, of cardiac arrest, septic shock 
and pneumonia in the cefiderocol group in CREDIBLE-CR, which are reflected in a higher total mortality 
rate in the cefiderocol group. It was noted that there was no imbalance in mortality rate in the APEKS-
NP study. In total, 43 subjects experienced SAEs with a fatal outcome with onset before the End of 
Study; 34 (33.7% of 101 subjects) in the cefiderocol group and 9 (18.4% of 49 subjects) in the BAT 
group. The most notable difference in SAEs leading to death between the two treatment groups was 
septic shock (10.9% [11/101] cefiderocol group vs 6.1% [3/49] BAT). The imbalance was seen for 
subjects with BSI/sepsis as well as those with HAP/VAP/HCAP. To investigate the imbalance in 
mortality further, the impact of potentially relevant host and pathogen factors on mortality has been 
further evaluated. At that analysis, a higher rate of Acinetobacter spp infections was noted in the 
cefiderocol group compared to the BAT group. Overall for subjects with Acinetobacter spp., the 28-day 
mortality was 38.1% in the cefiderocol group and 17.6% in the BAT group, and at the end of study 
was 50.0% in the cefiderocol group compared with 17.6% in the BAT group. 
The difference in mortality rates between the cefiderocol and BAT treatment groups in the CREDIBLE-
CR study is unexplained although there are some indications of imbalances between the treatment 
groups responsible for a minor part of the difference, e.g. history of septic shock among subjects with 
A. baumannii infection. However, the mortality rate in the cefiderocol group was also higher than the 
mortality rate in the BAT group for subjects with A. baumannii who did not have a history of shock. 
Therefore, shock does not alone explain the difference in mortality. 
The possibility that this is an efficacy problem is raised and discussed in the section of clinical efficacy. 
There is no indication of a specific safety issue with respect to causes of death. Furthermore, data from 
the cUTI and HAP/VAP setting are reassuring in this regard. 
2.6.3.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
With the exception of the unexplained imbalance in mortality rate observed in CREDIBLE-CR, the 
safety profile of cefiderocol is as what can be expected for cephalosporines. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
This product does not have any safety concerns in the RMP. Therefore, no additional 
pharmacovigilance activities or additional risk minimisation measures are in place.  
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.13 is acceptable.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 14.11.2019. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. The PRAC agreed that the Data 
Lock Point for the first PSUR is 14 November 2020. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of cefiderocol with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers cefiderocol to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons:  
The QRD group accepted the request for minimum particulars for the vial label, including the short 
term for the pharmaceutical form. According to the outcome the applicant had been requested, 
depending on the space, to include the statement ‘Dilute before use’ or “For IV use after reconstitution 
and dilution” on the vial label, as well as the statement "for single use only”. However, due to the 
limited space none of the above statements could fit without significantly compromising the readability 
of the vial label. 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included 
in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website and translated in all languages but will appear 
in grey-shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.

2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Fetcroja (cefiderocol) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Fetcroja is proposed by the Applicant to be indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic 
Gram-negative bacteria  in adult patients with limited treatment options. 
Multi drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative organisms such as carbapenem-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii play an increasing role as pathogens in various 
types of infection most importantly hospital-acquired including ventilator-associated pneumonia 
(HAP/VAP), complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and complicated intra-abdominal infections 
(cIAI) but also other types of infections can be caused by these pathogens. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Beta-lactam antibacterial agents are commonly used to manage infections when they involve Gram-
negative pathogens. Increasing resistance to beta-lactams, including the carbapenems, has led to 
some organisms being effectively untreatable or treatable only with resource to colistin with or without 
other agents to which they remain at least partly susceptible. A few antibacterial agents addressing 
carbapenem-resistance have been made available during the past years but none of them are active 
against class B beta-lactamases and have no or limited activity against class D beta-lactamases. The 
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimate that nearly 700,000 infections 
and 33,000 deaths in the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) in 2015 are a consequence of MDR 
bacterial infection (Cassini et al. 2019). The burden had increased since 2007. Carbapenem-resistance 
(CR) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter spp. contributed 
significantly to the number of estimated deaths whereas the numbers of deaths estimated to be caused 
by infections caused by CR Escherichia coli was lower. In 2013 to 2014, the Klebsiella pneumoniae 
carbapenemase (KPC) and oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48) was the most widely disseminated 
carbapenemases across Europe (Grundmann et al. 2017). Metallo-beta-lactamases such as New-Dehli 
metallo-betalactamase (NDM) and Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) were detected 
to a lesser extent. In summary, there remains an unmet medical need for additional antibacterial 
agents addressing carbapenem-resistance in Gram-negative organisms. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
APEKS-cUTI was a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study of cefiderocol compared with 
imipenem/cilastatin (IMP/CS) in hospitalised adult subjects with cUTI/acute pyelonephritis caused by 
Gram-negative pathogens. There was no requirement in this study that the infections should be caused 
by carbapenem-resistant pathogens. This study was not designed to support an indication for 
treatment of cUTI. 
CREDIBLE-CR was a phase 3, randomised, open-label, multicentre study of cefiderocol compared with 
best available therapy (BAT) in adult subjects for the treatment of severe infections (HAP/VAP/HCAP, 
cUTI and BSI/sepsis) caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The study can only 
be regarded as supportive of efficacy for the intended indication because of its limited size. 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 146/154 
 
 
 
 
 
APEKS-NP was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study of cefiderocol compared with 
meropenem in hospitalised adult subjects with HAP/VP/HCAP caused by Gram-negative pathogens. In 
line with the APEKS-cUTI study, there was no requirement in this study that the infections should be 
caused by carbapenem-resistant pathogens. This study was not intended to form the basis for the 
indication applied for. However, the results of this study were requested by the CHMP because of the 
imbalance in mortality noted in the interim analysis of the CREDIBLE-CR study in the subset of 
subjects with HAP/VAP/HCAP, and the concern of low ELF penetration of cefiderocol. This study was not 
designed to support an indication for treatment of HAP/VAP. 
The possible ability of cefiderocol to meet an unmet need i.e. treatment of carbapenem-resistant 
organisms expressing β-lactamases, particularly Ambler Class B or D enzymes, is based mainly on in-
vitro data, on nonclinical efficacy data to determine PK/PD targets and on clinical PK data indicating 
that relevant PK/PD targets are met with the 2 g q8h regimen when using 3h infusions. It is important 
to note that these data are pivotal to the application. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the APEKS-cUTI study the results for the composite endpoint of microbiological eradication and 
clinical cure per subject at TOC in the Micro-ITT population were 72.6% (n/N; 183/252) in the 
cefiderocol group and 54.6% (n/N; 65/119) in the IMP/CS group. The adjusted treatment difference 
was 18.6% (95% CI, 8.2, 28.9). Noninferiority at the prespecified -20% and -15% margins were met. 
Using the EU-recommended primary endpoint for studies in cUTI (microbiological eradication at TOC in 
the Micro-ITT population) and more stringent criterion for microbiological eradication (<103 CFU/mL 
instead of <104 CFU/mL) essentially similar results were obtained. 
In the CREDIBLE-CR study clinical cure per subject (for subjects with HAP/VAP/HCAP and BSI/Sepsis) 
and microbiological eradication per subject (for subjects with cUTI) at TOC in the CR Micro-ITT 
population were evaluated. The clinical cure rate for subjects with HAP/VAP/HCAP were 50.0% (n/N’, 
20/40; 95% CI, 33.8, 66.2) in the cefiderocol group and 52.6% ((n/N’, 10/19; 95% CI, 28.9, 75.6) in 
the BAT group. The clinical cure rate for subjects with BSI/sepsis were 43.5% (n/N’, 10/23; 95% CI, 
23.2, 65.5) in the cefiderocol group and 42.9% ((n/N’, 6/14; 95% CI, 17.7, 71.1) in the BAT group. 
The microbiological eradication rate for subjects with cUTI were 52.9% (n/N’, 9/17; 95% CI, 27.8, 
77.0) in the cefiderocol group and 20.0% (n/N’, 1/5; 95% CI, 0.5, 71.6) in the BAT group. 
In the APEKS-NP study noninferiority of cefiderocol compared with meropenem was demonstrated for 
the treatment of HAP/VAP/HCAP for all-cause mortality at Day 14 (the FDA-recommended primary 
endpoint). The EU-recommended primary endpoint for a HAP/VAP study (HCAP should not be included) 
is clinical outcome at TOC using an NI-margin of -12.5%. This was just met since the clinical cure rates 
at TOC were 64.8% for the cefiderocol group (n/N’, 94/145) and 66.7% for the meropenem group 
(n/N’, 98/147), with a treatment difference of -2.0 (95% CI: -12.5, 8.5). However, the study was not 
sized for the primary evaluation of non-inferiority with regards this endpoint. 
Based on plasma probability of target attainment (PTA) simulations using relevant PDTs (up to 100% 
fT>MIC), derived from neutropenic murine thigh and lung model studies against major target 
pathogens, the doses of cefiderocol in different renal function categories are satisfactory (PTA >90%) 
for the treatment of infections caused by pathogens having MICs up to 2 mg/L. These PTA simulations 
suggests that the dose is sufficient to cover the majority of target pathogens. 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 147/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Since the sample size in the CREDIBLE-CR study is limited, it does not form a basis for concluding on 
the efficacy of Fetcroja for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative bacteria  in adult 
patients with limited treatment options. Moreover, the APEKS-cUTI and APEKS-NP studies cannot either 
support the efficacy evaluation for the intended indication, although the studies lend support of the 
efficacy of cefiderocol for the treatment of cUTI and HAP/VAP/HCAP caused by carbapenem-susceptible 
organisms. 
As this application relies on a limited clinical programme, the PK/PD package, including in vitro data, 
determination of a non-clinical PK/PD target and PTA simulations using clinical PK data, are pivotal to 
the application. 
As noted above, based on plasma PTA simulations, the doses of cefiderocol in different renal function 
categories are satisfactory for the treatment of infections caused by pathogens having MICs up to 2 
mg/L. An adequate dose for the treatment of infections caused by pathogens with MICs of up to 2 
mg/L will include most species within the spectrum of cefiderocol. When only carbapenemase-
producing pathogens are considered, which are the main targets for cefiderocol, the MIC90s are 
somewhat higher, in general 4 mg/L and highest (8 mg/L) for the subsets of NDM-producing 
Enterobacteriaceae and OXA-24/40-like carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii. Therefore, PK-PD 
analyses predict that a minor subset of target organisms with high MIC values may not be treatable 
with cefiderocol at the recommended doses. 
The imbalance in mortality observed in the interim analysis of the CREDIBLE-CR study is maintained in 
the full dataset. However, the imbalance is evident in both the HAP/VAP/HCAP and BSI/sepsis subsets, 
not just in HAP/VAP/HCAP patients. This update vs. the interim dataset does not suggest that the 
mortality difference in CREDIBLE-CR is driven by poor efficacy of cefiderocol in HAP/VAP per se. As 
mentioned above, the non-inferiority of cefiderocol compared with meropenem in the APEKS-NP study 
lend further support that cefiderocol could be used for the treatment of infections in the lungs within 
the proposed pathogen-specific indication. 
The difference in mortality rates between the cefiderocol and BAT treatment groups in the CREDIBLE-
CR study is unexplained, although there are some indications of imbalances between the treatment 
groups responsible for a minor part of the difference, e.g. history of septic shock among subjects with 
A. baumannii infection. However, the mortality rate in the cefiderocol group was also higher than the 
mortality rate in the BAT group for subjects with A. baumannii who did not have a history of shock. 
Therefore, shock does not alone explain the difference in mortality. 
The data indicate to a potential problem for cefiderocol in the treatment of Acinetobacter spp., with or 
without shock. Although there were no difference noted in mortality between the treatment groups in 
the APEKS-NP study with regards subjects infected with A. baumannii, the data from the typical 
HAP/VAP study population and from the cUTI study cannot provide reassurance with respect to a real 
efficacy problem for cediferocol vs. carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In subjects with cUTI, cefiderocol demonstrated a comparable safety profile to an authorised active 
comparator, imipenem-cilastatin. Severe or serious AEs were infrequent (2% and 4.7% respectively). 
The most frequently reported individual Preferred Terms for cefiderocol in APEKS-cUTI were ALT 
increased, AST increased, CK increased, WBC increased, diarrhoea, pyrexia and rash, all reported in 
>10% of subjects receiving cefiderocol.  
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 148/154 
 
 
 
 
 
In subjects with CR-infections, the overall incidence of TEAEs, severe TEAEs and SAEs was similar 
between cefiderocol and BAT. Most subjects (94%) reported at least 1 TEAE, 37% reported a severe 
TEAE and 47% reported an SAE. The most frequently reported individual Preferred Terms for 
cefiderocol in CREDIBLE-CR were diarrhoea, vomiting, ALT increased, chest pain, decubitus ulcer, 
dyspnoea, pyrexia, septic shock, agitation, anaemia, AST increased, constipation and nausea, all 
reported in >10% of subjects receiving cefiderocol. There was no relevant difference for the reported 
TEAEs in subjects included the APEKS-NP study compared to CREDIBLE-CR. 
The most notable safety finding is the higher incidences of fatal SAEs in the cefiderocol group, 
specifically septic shock (10.9% [11/101] of subjects) and BAT (6.1% [3/49] of subjects) and 
pneumonia (5.0% [5/101] subjects in the cefiderocol group and no subjects in the BAT group). These 
are reflected in a higher total mortality rate in the cefiderocol group. In total, 43 subjects in the 
CREDIBLE-CR study died, of which 33.7% (34/101) were treated with cefiderocol and 18.4% (9/49) 
were treated with BAT. 
For the APEKS-NP study no imbalance in mortality rate was observed. 
Known adverse effects of cephalosporins (C. difficile-related diarrhoea, rash/hypersensitivity, 
seizures/epilepsy, liver-related adverse effects including liver biochemistry and clotting tests, and bone 
marrow suppression) were reported infrequently, in both CREDIBLE-CR and APEKS-cUTI. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The imbalance in mortality rates observed in CREDIBLE-CR is still unexplained. Even though septic 
shock was the more commonly reported SAE resulting in death among the subjects treated with 
cefiderocol compared to BAT, this difference is not sufficient to explain the imbalance in mortality. The 
causes of death in the CREDIBLE-CR study varied and included worsening and/or complications of 
infection and underlying conditions. Thus, no specific safety problem has been identified as causative 
of this observed imbalance and it seems more likely that the underlying cause is related to the efficacy 
of cefiderocol in certain types of host-pathogen settings. Some uncertainty on whether the different 
mortality estimates reflect a safety issue for cefiderocol remains.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Despite recent advances in the development of antibacterial agents, there is still an unmet need of 
antibacterial agents with an acceptable safety profile that are active against carbapenem-resistant 
Gram-negative organisms especially against organism producing Class B and Class D carbapenemases. 
The microbiology data indicate that cefiderocol is active against important Gram-negative organisms 
including Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and S. maltophilia and stable to all classes 
of beta-lactamases. Cefiderocol seems moreover not adversely affected by efflux pumps or loss of 
outer membrane porins. Therefore, Fetcroja could provide useful alternative for the treatment of most 
infections due to carbapenem-resistant aerobic Gram-negative bacteria. 
Even though non-inferiority of cefiderocol compared with IMP/CS was met in the APEKS-cUTI and 
APEKS-NP studies, the efficacy of cefiderocol for the intended indication was not established in these 
studies because the target organisms of the indication was not specifically studied. Moreover, the 
sample size of the CREDIBLE-CR study conducted in subjects infected with target pathogens was too 
small to conclude on the efficacy of cefiderocol and to justify the dose. 
Because of the limited size of the clinical programme, a robust PK/PD package to support the adequacy 
of the dose cefiderocol is pivotal. Based on plasma PTA simulations, the doses of cefiderocol in 
different renal function categories are sufficient for the treatment of infections caused by pathogens 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 152/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
having MICs up to 2 mg/L. An adequate dose for the treatment of infections caused by pathogens with 
MICs of up to 2 mg/L will include most species within the spectrum of cefiderocol. 
There were initial concerns that the dose may be insufficient, especially for the treatment of infections 
in the lungs because of the low ELF penetration. The imbalance in mortality observed in the interim 
analysis of the CREDIBLE-CR study remains in the final dataset and is evident in both the 
HAP/VAP/HCAP and BSI/sepsis subsets. This update vs. the interim dataset does not suggest that the 
mortality difference in CREDIBLE-CR is driven by poor efficacy of cefiderocol in HAP/VAP per se. As 
commented above, the non-inferiority of cefiderocol compared with meropenem in the APEKS-NP study 
lend further support that cefiderocol could be used for the treatment of infections in the lungs within 
the proposed pathogen-specific indication. 
The imbalance noted in mortality in the CREDIBLE-CR study is still unexplained. The data indicate to a 
potential problem for cefiderocol in the treatment of Acinetobacter spp., with or without shock. 
Although there were no difference noted in mortality between the treatment groups in the APEKS-NP 
study with regards subjects infected with A. baumannii, the data from the typical HAP/VAP study 
population and from the UTI study are not relevant to rule out a real problem for cefiderocol vs. 
Acinetobacter. It is considered crucial to inform the prescribers of the imbalance in mortality in the 
CREDIBLE-CR study and association between mortality and infection with Acinetobacter in the 
cefiderocol treatment arm. 
In clinical studies, the overall safety profile of cefiderocol was similar to that of the relevant active 
comparator (IMP/CS in cUTI and BAT in CR Gram-negative infections), with the notable exception of a 
currently unexplained numerical imbalance in all-cause mortality between treatment groups in 
CREDIBLE-CR. A similar imbalance was not observed between treatment groups amongst cUTI patients 
in APEKS-cUTI. Furthermore, no imbalance in mortality was observed in the APEKS-NP study. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall nonclinical and clinical data support the ability of cefiderocol to address an unmet need. 
The balance of benefits and risks is considered positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Fetcroja is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Fetcroja is not similar to Cayston, TOBI Podhaler, 
Bronchitol, Kalydeco and Symkevi within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Fetcroja is favourable in the following indication: 
Assessment report  
EMA/136096/2020  
Page 153/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fetcroja is indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in adults 
with limited treatment options (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that cefiderocol is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.
